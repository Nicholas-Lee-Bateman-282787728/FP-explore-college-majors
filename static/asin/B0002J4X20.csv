The modern day conveniences of life and the hustle and bustle of work sometimes fog our eyes to the constantly moving world.  Thankfully we have films like Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring, to help guide us back to our roots.  Through each season, director Ki-duk Kim shows us the journey of one young boy as he learns life through the hands and mind of an older monk.  Through events that are beyond his control, this young boy learns about love, lust, jealousy, hatred, and eventually rage.  He makes choices that ultimately effect his life causing turmoil and distress, yet somehow continually finds his way back to the floating house on the lake where his journey began.  It is during his final visit home he learns of his final journey in life.  As a new soul is handed to him, he embarks on a final journey using his master's lesson, to pay homage to the life he has lead.When I watched this film the first story that came to mind was that told by Trina Paulus in ""Hope for the Flowers"".  It is the story of two caterpillars that embark on a journey into butterflies.  Along the way they experience a full range of emotions that are attached to life and death.  In the end, they become two of the most beautiful creatures in the world.  This is how I viewed this entire film.  I felt as if I was watching a young caterpillar (the young boy) experience life and journey along the path to become the beautiful butterfly.  The beauty of the scenes and the simplicity of this story not drenched in words only kept this image vibrant.  The spiritual themes of this film are present, but not bold.  They are not hitting you in the face and forcing you to understand, but instead showing you and demonstrating the power of those willing to believe.  This is a quiet film that leaves much up to our imagination.  We never leave the valley that surrounds the lake, we never know what year is currently going on outside of the forest, and we are meant to understand that this story could take place anytime.  Kim gives us themes that can be used to express any period of time and is especially poignant in today's terror filled world.I loved everything about this film.  From the simplicity of the opening doors to introduce each scene to the stunning and hypnotic ending that makes you believe in the human spirit.  If you walk away with anything from this film, I hope it is hope.  Hope for everything on this planet, and especially a hope for our fellow man.  Mistakes are made to learn by.  Take these errors and accept them to move closer to the world you have always dreamed about.  Be that young boy that is able to transform into the man he desires.  See this movie, and feel a warmth like no other.  This is quite possibly one of the best films of the year.

836689,A2HL7R8R23NERT,B0002J4X20,Bart King,"[2, 3]","(This review's title is the Korean pronunciation of the movie.) If Korea had had PBS programming during Confucian times, this elegant and beautiful fable might have been the result.As its English title suggests, the film's organizing structure are the seasons, with Buddhism and sublimation with nature as the underlying motifs. Virtually no characters have names (beyond a title like ""Master""), and one character drives the anonymous ""every person"" message home by being literally faceless.But while this serene movie deals with spiritual themes, it has its lighthearted moments as well, especially in the first half. To a Western observer, these can constitute perhaps unintended hilarity. *SPOILER ALERT* The attempts of the randy young Buddhist monk to master his desires, despite his Master's warning that lust leads to greed, then to possessiveness, then to murder are a mite silly. Also smirk-worthy was the willingness of the Korean police officers to spend a day with an armed murderer so that he could do some therapeutic whittling.Frankly, I think it's safe to say that a ""typical"" Westerner would not ""get"" this film without a primer on Buddhism beforehand. Without it, the movie seems inexplicably simple. On the other hand, if one were to mute the film and let the gorgeous scenes play out, this might provide a sort of education right there for even the most culture-bound among us.",4,BOM YEOREUM GAEUL GYEOUL GEURIGO BOM,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1397,"['review', 'title', 'Korean', 'pronunciation', 'movie', 'Korea', 'had', 'had', 'PBS', 'programming', 'Confucian', 'times', 'elegant', 'beautiful', 'fable', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'result.As', 'English', 'title', 'film', 'organizing', 'structure', 'are', 'seasons', 'Buddhism', 'sublimation', 'nature', 'underlying', 'motifs', 'Virtually', 'characters', 'have', 'names', 'title', 'Master', 'one', 'character', 'anonymous', 'person', 'message', 'home', 'being', 'literally', 'faceless.But', 'serene', 'movie', 'deals', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'well', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'Western', 'observer', 'can', 'constitute', 'perhaps', 'unintended', 'hilarity', 'ALERT*', 'attempts', 'randy', 'young', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'master', 'desires', 'Master', 'warning', 'greed', 'then', 'possessiveness', 'then', 'murder', 'are', 'mite', 'silly', 'Also', 'smirk-worthy', 'was', 'willingness', 'Korean', 'police', 'officers', 'spend', 'day', 'armed', 'murderer', 'so', 'could', 'do', 'therapeutic', 'whittling.Frankly', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'typical', 'Westerner', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'film', 'primer', 'Buddhism', 'beforehand', 'movie', 'inexplicably', 'simple', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'were', 'mute', 'film', 'let', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'might', 'provide', 'sort', 'education', 'right', 'there', 'even', 'most', 'culture-bound']",N/A
836690,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0002J4X20,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","My first viewing of the film was disappointing. I was not in the mood.The second time, I was immediately entranced by the premise of a floating monastery, in a small lake in modern South Korea. The entire movie takes place within the confines of an approximately 1 square mile surrounding the floating house / temple / ashram. I'm amazed at the detail to which the Buddhists within the story (and the art directors who dressed the set) decorated the skiff, the house, and the symbolic door through one passes to reach the landing at which the skiff is tied up when travelling from the dwelling to the shore. The surrounding land seems to have little value for agriculture or livestock. It is probably a preserve owned by the Buddhists, or set aside as a preserve by the state.As you may guess from the title, the film is divided into five periods; however, they are not the five seasons of two adjoining years. They represent the four seasons of a man (not a big spoiler. You discover that as soon as the ""Summer"" episode starts), focusing on the very young trainee who appears in the opening segment. The first Spring goes pretty much as you might expect, but at the beginning of the second season, the action takes a dramatically unexpected twist, which will keep you involved with the plot from then onwards.If you have any fondness at all for ""art films"" which rely almost exclusively on ideas and the stages in one's life, be patient until ""Summer"" comes along, and you will be rewarded.Even though Wikipedia calls it a monastery, I think that is a misnomer, because there is only one monk living there, with one student. It is more like a ""hermitage"" or an ""ashram"" (although that is a Hindu term.) A quick check of Buddhist monasticism says that there is a fairly broad latitude in which a lot of variety may be found. We must also remember that this film takes place in modern South Korea, even though there are only a few hints to that fact.I might warn you that the Wikipedia article on the film has a few inaccuracies about details of the plot.There must be a special artistry to making a film with very little dialogue, and at the same time, I suspect that such a movie, like this one, which has very few characters, and usually only two characters on the screen for long stretches, can be quite boring to some. I started watching this several weeks ago, and turned it off shortly after it began, since, at the time, I was really more interested in action, or some kind of police procedural, where I didn't have to think too much. This time, when I turned it on, being less sleepy and more attentive, I found it perfectly delightful.

836691,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0002J4X20,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 7]","A recent blockbuster film, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, blew my mind with its sumptuous cinematography, settings, and costumes. It was pure eye-candy, through and through. Looking at the cost of production, $85 million, one can easily see the care director Rob Marshall took with each and every shot. Now let's move on to SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER ...AND SPRING (SSFWAS), director Ki-duk Kim's sparkling success.Shot in one location on a high mountain lake in Korea, and using only a handful of actors/actresses, SSFWAS accomplishes the same wondrous scenery with only a fraction of the GEISHA budget.The story is that of a monk and a young boy in training to become a monk. They live in a monastery that floats, raft-like, on a pristine mountain lake. The monk teaches the boy life lessons: how to pray, caring for one's home, and treating nature's creatures with respect. We view their experiences through the title's seasons, sometimes leaping a few years ahead, watching the boy grow, mature, and learn how tough life can be. As the story progresses, the boy battles his demons, learns by hard example, then comes full-circle to become the very thing he so recklessly tossed away (his faith in God/Buddha and his trust in his old mentor, the monk).The script is a simple one, not delving into side-plots, but giving us a glimpse at how extraordinary life truly is. This isn't just the life of a boy and his master, though. This is everyone's life with all its trials, follies, and triumphs.But through all of this simplicity there's the camera work. It is (to use a cliche) breathtaking. The changes in season are stunning, and the lighting, angles and scope of the landscape are visually perfect.It's also interesting to note that the film is only 103 minutes long and has maybe 30 lines of dialogue. The scenery tells the story more often than anything the actors say, which is also impressive.Not surprising, the movie is slow but viewers probably won't notice because of the oohing and ahing most will do while sitting drinking in every lush scene.",4,Drink In The Seasons Of Life,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,2051,"['recent', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'MEMOIRS', 'A', 'GEISHA', 'blew', 'mind', 'sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'settings', 'costumes', 'was', 'pure', 'eye-candy', 'Looking', 'cost', 'production', '85', 'million', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'care', 'director', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'took', 'shot', 'Now', 'let', 'move', 'SPRING', 'SUMMER', 'FALL', 'WINTER', 'SPRING', 'SSFWAS', 'director', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'sparkling', 'success.Shot', 'one', 'location', 'high', 'mountain', 'lake', 'Korea', 'using', 'only', 'handful', 'actors/actresses', 'SSFWAS', 'same', 'wondrous', 'scenery', 'only', 'fraction', 'GEISHA', 'budget.The', 'story', 'monk', 'young', 'boy', 'training', 'become', 'monk', 'live', 'monastery', 'raft-like', 'pristine', 'mountain', 'lake', 'monk', 'boy', 'life', 'lessons', 'how', 'pray', 'caring', 'one', 'home', 'treating', 'nature', 'creatures', 'respect', 'view', 'experiences', 'title', 'seasons', 'sometimes', 'leaping', 'few', 'years', 'ahead', 'watching', 'boy', 'grow', 'mature', 'learn', 'how', 'tough', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'story', 'boy', 'demons', 'learns', 'hard', 'example', 'then', 'full-circle', 'become', 'very', 'thing', 'so', 'recklessly', 'tossed', 'away', 'faith', 'God/Buddha', 'trust', 'old', 'mentor', 'monk', '.The', 'script', 'simple', 'one', 'not', 'delving', 'side-plots', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'how', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'truly', ""n't"", 'just', 'life', 'boy', 'master', 'though', 'everyone', 'life', 'trials', 'follies', 'triumphs.But', 'simplicity', 'camera', 'work', 'use', 'cliche', 'breathtaking', 'changes', 'season', 'are', 'stunning', 'lighting', 'angles', 'scope', 'landscape', 'are', 'visually', 'perfect.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'film', 'only', '103', 'minutes', 'long', 'maybe', '30', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'scenery', 'story', 'more', 'often', 'anything', 'actors', 'say', 'also', 'impressive.Not', 'surprising', 'movie', 'slow', 'viewers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'oohing', 'ahing', 'most', 'will', 'do', 'sitting', 'drinking', 'lush', 'scene']",N/A

Once grown, the young monk leaves his temple and his master for the love of a young girl, only to return many years later seeking sanctuary after having murdered the object of his affection.  Following his incarceration and the death of his master, the former monk returns once more to single-handedly rebuild the temple and his life.  Donning the robes once more, he takes on a young orphan, and so the story, and the cycle of life, begins again.""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring"" is exquisitely filmed, with great attention paid to color and composition.  There's not a lot of dialog, but it really isn't necessary.  The plot is simple enough that Kim can rely on visuals and music to tell his story.  Unfortunately, he didn't pay as careful attention to script, casting and acting.  There are a couple of improbable hiccups in the plot, such as the master learning of his apprentice's criminal behavior through a newspaper used as wrapping he brings back from a visit to a town market.  Four different actors play the main character at different points in his life and the last two look nothing like each other or like the first two.  And in such a quiet and understated film, the over-emoting of the the third actor is jarring.Still, this is a well conceived film that touches on themes relevant to all but saints and bodhisattvas.

But the themes that it engages, such as desire as the cause of suffering, possessiveness, anger, sin, redemption, loss of innocence, wisdom, and the like are universal experiences. The film passes through the four seasons of the year, an obvious metaphor for the developmental stages of the two characters. In each successive season the characters are about a decade older, so that in circular fashion the ten-year old apprentice at the beginning of the film is the new elder at the end, complete with his own young apprentice.

The acting was good, the dialogue was kept to a minimum, and the symbolism was effective and not too difficult to grasp. The first half of the film is better than the second half; the introduction of the detectives into the pristine, pure temple and the environment that surrounds it felt a bit awkward. However, having only two detectives show up made the story more believable than if helicopters arrived to capture the murderer. In other words, interference from the outside world was present but not in a way that hurt the film. As for the woman who shows up with the baby (and future disciple), it is probably not terribly important who she is. An interesting aspect of the film is that none of the characters have names, except for Detective Choi. One thing I'd like to correct is the term ""cycle."" I've seen reviews on this site that say everything is cyclical from the perspective of Buddhism. This is and isn't true; things are cyclical but not in a predictable fashion. Samsara operates in a cyclical manner but not with the predictablity of a 1950s cowboy movie or a professional wrestling match. One of the ideas in Buddhism is to abandon preconceptions. With this said, it's important to understand that there was nothing ""written in the stars"" that demanded that things start all over again in the second spring; it's just convenient for our minds that the symbolism be there. Seon Buddhism abandons the idea of fate and destiny; at any given second, anything can happen. That is the only way in which I disagree with others' reviews on Amazon.com.

Kim Ki-Duk works magic with only a few props in the ethereal, exquisite ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring,"" a movie that transcends its own simplicity. Beautiful, well-acted and quietly poetic, this Korean film is a movie to remember.Somewhere in a secluded spot, surrounded by tall mountains, is a beautiful little lake, and a small Buddhist monastery floats in the middle of it. Two monks live in it -- an elderly man (Oh Young-su), and a very young boy. The boy is full of the usual hijinks and mischief, but the old monk teaches him lessons that shape him as he grows to manhood.The young boy (Kim Young-min) learns that his childish cruelty has terrible consequences, and that if he kills anything, he will carry that ""stone"" with him for the rest of his life. Then, as he reaches adolescence, a young girl (Ha Yeo-jin) enters their lives -- and his heart. Filled with lust and love, the boy leaves for the outside world. But the world -- and a murder -- drives him back to where he started, to find death or redemption...""Spring"" is steeped in Buddhist teachings, but in a sense those teachings are truly universal -- all the more obvious because Kim is not a Buddhist, but a Catholic. The love of life, dangers of desire, mistakes and the danger of repeating them, and the cycles of death and birth are at the core of ""Spring,"" and it's impossible not to be touched by those ideas being woven into a simple, straightforward plot.The seasons parallel that of the younger monk's life, taking him from childhood to old age. It's a simple idea, but a good one. Director Kim Ki-duk (who has a starring role) gives an almost unearthly feel to the beautiful landscape, the dramatic scene on the snowy mountains, and especially to the beautiful little two-person monastery in the middle of a lake. The sight of it is almost unreal.Oh Young-su does an excellent job with the old monk, who has the wisdom the younger man sorely lacks. His past is a mystery; the problems his disciple encounters make you wonder what caused him to stay in seclusion. Kim himself plays the mature younger man, giving a startlingly nuanced performance as the character tries to atone for his sins, and takes the place where he is most needed.With a single set and only a few actors, Kim Ki-Duk crafts a meditative masterpiece in ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...

836707,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0002J4X20,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER ... AND SPRING (original Korean title ""Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom"", 2003) is that famous yet elusive film everyone's been pondering for eight or more years. You know, that Buddhist monk movie with the tiny temple that floats in the middle of a tiny mountain lake. No, this isn't WHY HAS BODHIDHARMA LEFT FOR THE WEST?, but I sometimes wish it were.This is a film that I absolutely adore. In spite of some sex scenes that frankly disgusted me for their lack of necessity, it's a cherished work of art. Written and directed by Kim Ki-Duk, filmed on location at Ju WangSan National Park, CheongSong-Gun County, Gyeong SangBuk Do Province, Korea ... well, that's a whole paragraph for the location alone! Well worth it: it's a fairy land of beautiful, unhindered nature.In this midst lives the Holy One (Oh Young-Su), an old Buddhist priest with a young boy in his care, serving as a novice monk. At this starting point, in the SPRING section, the boy is innocent, free and anxious to learn. And does he learn about compassion and cruelty!While he's tying rocks to innocent creatures on the mainland, a beautiful chant is heard and I've seen requests asking what it is. It is the ""Heart Sutra"", the central Scripture of the Buddhist faith. It is in Korean, the ""Banya Baramilta Shing-Yo"". I think I know the priest who chants it.In the SUMMER, the boy is a teen. A weird lady and her daughter appear, to see if the Holy One can cure the daughter. Some hanky-panky between the boy and this girl certainly cures her. The Holy One simply says, ""These things happen naturally."" Love's cruel sting causes the boy to abandon the tiny floating temple to follow the girl. What bothers me is one of several stupid mysteries: why did the girl's mother take off and leave her daughter at the temple?FALL: Holy One is alone and as placid as ever. He glances at a newspaper he picked up in town and immediately recognizes the boy - now 30. Now he's a fugitive after murdering his wife - the girl with whom he eloped all those years earlier. The concern that lines the Holy One's face gives way to preparations. He knows the boy is returning. He does, and his howls of insanely angry pain demonstrate that he is as selfish as when he murdered his two-timing wife.After being accepted as a novice monk, Holy One beats him silly (no Buddhist priest would EVER do that) then forces him to use the murder knife to carve the Heart Scripture onto the deck-porch of the temple. The carving and subsequent painting of the characters is one of my favorite scenes, though here again, I cannot fathom the savage beating Holy One administers to this kid. Perhaps ""it's the right medicine""?The cops find the young buck in no time, though they allow him one more day and night at the temple. They have to take him in, but before he goes, the Holy One ordains him. Now they have to treat him differently, because, well, the Holy One has ordained him priest ... which also means he's been marked as the Holy One's successor. This is meaningful.When the rowboat departs with the newly minted priest and the cops, Holy One uses his powers to stall the boat for a few seconds. He loves the young priest and cannot bear to see him leave again. When the party disembark at the outer gate across the lake, Holy One causes the boat to return by itself. That is one holy man! Buddhists aren't supposed to use their Jedi-like powers! Contrary to many critiques I've read, the empty boat does NOT clearly show a filament pulling it along: that is the boat's own mooring rope. It's a cool special effect, one of many dazzling effects.The Holy One then commits suicide by cremating himself in the little rowboat, to atone for whatever it is he thinks he needs to atone for ... I don't know.WINTER is cold and snowy. A 50-year-old monk (could THIS be Kim Ki-Duk??) appears at the edge of the lake. He walks to the temple. Of course it is our brave boy, turned middle-aged priest. Apparently he's out of jail, God knows why, and he settles into the temple. Here a weird thing occurs after he finds the Holy One's ashes and works to make his own atonements. An odd lady with her face hidden in a shawl appears and leaves a baby with him.We do not know who the hell this is ... at least I don't. Is it his former mother-in-law? Is she someone else? She falls through the ice as she departs, unbeknownst to the priest. He finds her the next day, and all I can say is she got the shortest funeral in history. While the priest gets a new baby boy, an ancient martial arts instruction manual the Holy One left behind, and some other funny things.Ah, the whole thing is a cheap representation of reincarnation and karma. Why make it so obvious, which robs it of its poetry? The priest becomes enlightened, raises the boy, and ...... AND SPRING. The temple and grounds around the lake are fresh and new again, the priest is there and the boy is the same actor as the boy in the beginning, though clearly not the same boy. Or is he? When we look at the priest, gosh, he sure looks exactly like a younger version of the Holy One, who ages about 15 or 20 years during his screen time.There is no way I will move beyond the name of the actor who plays the Holy One. The credits are a headache due to their imprecise nature, and the subtitling is good, but then the lines are few and far between. One does see that the Kim Family members play all the juicy roles in this, except for the Holy One.Get this. It teaches Buddhism, at least in its Korean form, is a work of pure art, and is a wonderful classic. Otherwise people wouldn't be talking about it to this day, bemoaning the fact that they can't recall anything about it and therefore can't get the DVD. So GET IT!

It is an artificial pond which looks like a lake and reflects the mountains like a mirror. The scenery calms the mind and soothes the soul, the camera's eye glides gradually to a small lake hidden between mountains, on which floats a beautifully painted and carved Buddhist temple. The misty mountains and tall peaks hide an inner beauty far from the ordinairy. An elderly monk tends to his prayers and then goes about his daily chores in meditation and silence. He is accompanied by a young boy, a student, a ""monk-in-training"" who likely will inherit this peaceful lifestyle. ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring"" makes the viewer awesomely quiet and silent, absorbing the landscapes created by nature. The viewer is spellbound, waiting, anticipating - what is next? A young monk, about aged 7 or so is watched closely by the Master. He engages in boyish pranks, which harm some small helpless creatures. The Master is dismayed but uses the experience to teach the young monk a lesson he will not soon forget about ""compassion."" It is now ""Spring"" ...Time passes, and the young monk is now an awkward teenager. He tends the Buddhist temple with care and occasionally rows a boat to a gate which leads to a path - a path to the outside world, the mountains are like a wall from ordinairy civilization. From seemingly nowhere, a mother and her ill-looking teenaged daughter arrive at the temple. The mother has sought healing from many sources but nothing has cured her daughter, she asks the Master for help, she has nowhere else to turn. The elderly monk accepts the young lady as a guest. She participates in the simple life of the temple. The teenaged monk and she eye each other warily - and inevitably - teenage passions are aroused, some of which are expressed and others that are repressed. The Master of the temple is witness to these changes.The film continues to reveal ""seasons"" of life, the young monk as an adult wrestles with his feelings, leaves the monastery and joins life in the outside world. Lust, desire, control, and anger lead to unexpected behaviors. The young monk returns to the temple, without explanation but among his belongings, the Master discovered a newspaper article. The young adult monk engages in painting out specific Buddhist sutras on the deck of the temple. This film symbolically reveals subtle life-altering experiences which are densely packed with meaning. There are suspense-filled moments that reveal intense emotions of shock, sadness, and revelation within the sphere of the idyllic floating Buddhist temple that is tucked between lush green, peaked and misty mountains. The impact of the lessons learned within this film are vast and deeply meaningful. This is a most highly recommended viewing experience.

Actions always speak louder than words and this film is no exception because few words are spoken throughout the movie.The THEME is one of life, with WISDOM being the core. When man lives as the world lives, he ultimately suffers from the world's ways. But a simple life filled with spiritual enlightenment brings the peace that so many people hunger for and never attain.The relationship between the young man and his 'Master' involves much respect of the elder. The Master always disciplines his student with intent of making him a better man, much like a parent would want for his or her child but often giving in rather than admonishing. Parents can learn a valuable lesson from this movie. If we teach well and set the example, not only will our children follow suite, but they, in turn, will pass wisdom and discipline on to the next generation, as this film implies.I recommend watching this movie.

With minimalist means, sets, effects, and dialogue, Director Ki-duk Kim leads us on a journey of the human condition, of the cycle of life using the metaphor of the seasons, and of the struggle for spiritual awakening that must come from within. Set on a floating Buddhist monastery in the middle of a lake surrounded by mountains and mists, an old monk (Yeong-su Oh) is first seen in Spring, observing his young monk in training (Jong-ho Kim - an orphan left at his doorstep?) observing nature and imposing his own boyish powers over fish, frog, and snake. Quietly the old monk teaches his pupil a lesson of life in restraining the boy just as the boy restrained the animals: lesson learned, scene fades. Summer finds the child as a youth (Jae-kyeong Seo), this time his lesson involves passion for a young girl (Yeo-jin Ha) brought to the monastery for physical and spiritual healing. After a series of sexual liaisons and the development of love, the old monk pronounces the girl healed, returns her to her mother, and the devastated youthful monk leaves the monastery to learn life's lessons in  the outside world. Autumn finds the old monk receiving word that the now adult runaway (Young-min Kim) has murdered his unfaithful wife and seeks hiding in the monastery. The old monk once again must teach the young man control of his rage and the need to atone for his deeds and after a visually beautiful act of contrition. With wisdom yet in deep sadness the old monk fades into the ether of the spiritual world. Winter comes, the lake is frozen, the monastery deserted and we see the grown man (Ki-duk Kim himself) walking across the ice to return to the monastery of his childhood and youth. Slowly he plays out acts of contrition, carrying the returned Buddha to a mountaintop while encumbered by a self-imposed restraining stone dragging behind him. Returning to the monastery he begins his won life of teaching. Spring returns and the monk has a ward with whom to share the secrets of living. There is no way to 'give-away' the ending as there is no ending. Kim's view is that life is a cycle, and unbroken circle that may have diversions and branches but always comes round again if the spirit is receptive. The musical score (it sounds coarse to call it that) is atmospheric and moody and exactly right. The acting is uniformly superb, each actor creating indelible impressions not likely to leave the mind's eye. The setting on the lake is simple, breathtakingly beautiful, and magnificently photographed as it moves from season to season. With very few props (the monastery and the boat and the gates that open into the World Beyond) the message of the film is left in the sensitive faces of the characters as inspired by Kim.

At the time there were only two other people in the whole theater, but I must say that it made much more of an impression on me than any other film I've seen this year.  Elegantly simple and beautifully photographed, it tells the story of a Buddhist monk who lives at an isolated cabin retreat and a young boy (presumably an orphan) who has been placed under his care.  Each of the seasons represents a phase of the boy's life, which by the end has come full circle.  It would be easy for a film like this to become too sentimental or navel-gazing for its own good, but for the most part Ki-duk Kim pulls it off very well.  Some of the scenes, from the animals struggling with the stones tied to them to the monk covering his face with Buddhist sutras, will remain etched in your mind for a long time.  Some have unfairly criticized the film's Buddhist themes because the director has stated he is a Christian, but is that really relevant?  From what I remember, there are no direct references to God, and the Buddhist elements aren't even played up too heavily considering its premise.

The team of cinematographer, Dong-hyeon Baek, and director, Ki-duk Kim, use stunning imagery to tell their version of the circle of life.The strength of the movie lies in its ability to tell a tale with imagery instead of dialog. If you're one to get antsy in a Kubrick film due to his long drawn out shots, you likely will hate this movie. However, if you have patience and appreciate a director who doesn't seem to think the movie masses suffer from ADD, you'll appreciate the time the director gives you to reflect on the beauty of the story's natural settings.The actors perform well. The door that opens at the beginning of each one of the five seasons could be interpreted as a gate, linking the two worlds: our world and their world. To go-in and go-out in the idyllic space where the hermitage floats every people must go through this gate. In fact the film is a very simple allegory about the cyclic evolving life. The beginning and the final of the film encloses a cycle. Kim takes the characters in a more mature direction than many of the other tales, and does it with a better eye than most. The hut in which the central characters reside is located in the middle of a woody mountain lake. The lake and the surrounding woods play as important characters as the actors. The changes in the lake and the land through the seasons reflect the changes within the boy monk.If you have the patience to meditate on the wondrous imagery of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring, check it out.

Zhang Yimou can visually represent the seasons well beyond that shown here (see his ""The Road Home"").The acting is also problematic: the two boys, when each in different ""seasons"" are being cruel to various animals, ""giggle""; it is as if they know they are doing wrong, and the director felt that needed to be broadcast so the viewer didn't miss the fact that they knew it was wrong.  The story, though, indicates that they are both too young to realize they are being cruel, or doing wrong, so they wouldn't be essentially snickering with guilty pleasure as if believing they are getting away with fooling the adult monk.As well, their acting is not in either case convincing: each is obviously acting -- ""faking"" the ""evil""-sounding giggling.I've been a student of Buddhism for decades; this doesn't achieve the sublimity or subtlety implied by the DVD artwork, and the rave reviews here.In short: much too obvious and somewhat heavy handed handling of that which should have been delicate.  At least as delicate as the actress who, by sheer coincidence, with her mother, showed up out of nowhere, without explanation, with some unknown illness, became ""pliant,"" and thereby became the means for the main character to ""learn a lesson the hard way"".  The ultimate consequences for her are inexplicably irrelevant.  Sexism according to which women are mere props?And another convenient coincidence: the monk warned the main character, about that relationship: ""Lust leads to the desire to possess.  And the desire to possess leads to murder.""  Not too much leaping to extremes in that, eh?  And, sure enough, years later the monk is reading a newspaper -- the only time in the film he happens to do so, with no explanation where he got it -- and sees the main character's photo, and a report that he's being sought for killing the woman.  Karma is one thing, but predicting it in advance is a bit much, when Buddhism puts one's fate not in the stars but in one's own hands.Worse, though, as others have noted, Buddhism does not use violence in any degree -- especially as a ""teaching"" method.I wish I could overlook those flaws, but they are simply too blatant to be ignored.",3,Disappointing --,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,2267,"['visually', 'attractive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'spectacular', 'up', 'material', 'intended', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'can', 'visually', 'represent', 'seasons', 'well', 'shown', 'here', 'see', 'Road', 'Home', '.The', 'acting', 'also', 'problematic', 'two', 'boys', 'when', 'different', 'seasons', 'are', 'being', 'cruel', 'various', 'animals', 'giggle', 'know', 'are', 'doing', 'wrong', 'director', 'felt', 'needed', 'be', 'broadcast', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'fact', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong', 'story', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'realize', 'are', 'being', 'cruel', 'doing', 'wrong', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'essentially', 'snickering', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'believing', 'are', 'getting', 'away', 'fooling', 'adult', 'monk.As', 'well', 'acting', 'not', 'case', 'convincing', 'obviously', 'acting', 'faking', 'evil', '-sounding', 'giggling.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'student', 'Buddhism', 'decades', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'sublimity', 'subtlety', 'implied', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'rave', 'reviews', 'here.In', 'short', 'much', 'too', 'obvious', 'somewhat', 'heavy', 'handed', 'handling', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'delicate', 'least', 'as', 'delicate', 'actress', 'who', 'sheer', 'coincidence', 'mother', 'showed', 'nowhere', 'explanation', 'unknown', 'illness', 'became', 'pliant', 'thereby', 'became', 'means', 'main', 'character', 'learn', 'lesson', 'hard', 'way', 'ultimate', 'consequences', 'are', 'inexplicably', 'irrelevant', 'Sexism', 'according', 'women', 'are', 'mere', 'props', 'convenient', 'coincidence', 'monk', 'warned', 'main', 'character', 'relationship', 'Lust', 'desire', 'possess', 'desire', 'possess', 'leads', 'murder', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'leaping', 'extremes', 'eh', 'sure', 'enough', 'years', 'later', 'monk', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'only', 'time', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'explanation', 'where', 'got', 'main', 'character', 'photo', 'report', 'being', 'sought', 'killing', 'woman', 'Karma', 'one', 'thing', 'predicting', 'advance', 'bit', 'much', 'when', 'Buddhism', 'one', 'fate', 'not', 'stars', 'one', 'own', 'hands.Worse', 'though', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Buddhism', 'not', 'use', 'violence', 'degree', 'especially', 'teaching', 'wish', 'could', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'blatant', 'be', 'ignored']",N/A

Much of the acting is strong.  For the pristine beauty of the location and of the filming palette I give it 5 stars, at least.The faults of the movie however are many.  First, the behavior of the so-called ""Master"" is not accurate to Buddhist principles (see the set of ethical principles, The Shila or Sila, followed by most sects).  So ignore all the reviews which celebrate the Buddhist teaching value of this movie.The master is violent, both physically (beating the arhat) and emotionally.  Instead he should follow the Shila of acting in no harmful way.What we get it seems is the directors personal fantasy of sensationalism, including his own participation as an actor: his bad taste of showing off his martial arts skills, which has no bearing at all on the actual storyline nor the ""spiritual"" content of the movie.  And of course, since his face first appears as the ""Winter"" incarnation of the main character's life of seasons, the viewer is left wondering who this man is (he bears no resemblance to the earlier younger actors).  One viewer even thought he was one of the police detectives seen in the previous Fall tableau!The first season (Spring tableau) is the most beautiful and moving, the main character as a boy protege, with the Master teaching him by example of the boy's cruelity to other senitent creatures. The movie goes down, down, down as it regresses to the non sequitor ending.  Some viewers see ""non sequitor"" as perfectly Zen Koan like, but since it bears little or no relationship to earlier events, it seems more like the director drifted into Hollywood expectations of kitschy cliches instead. Leaving so many unanswered questions regarding narrative direction as to make one laugh aloud.Don't buy this movie.  It's just bad.  An example of a director enjoying the ""creativity"" of his own flaky fantasies rather than a profound Buddhist testament.

As a young teen he is introduced to a young girl who's mother brought her to the floating monastery because of an illness.

836726,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002J4X20,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[126, 137]","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring ushers the audience into silent solitude through meticulously planned cinematography that maximizes the effect of the natural environment.  The environment is essential to the story as it takes place in an idyllic valley that is untouched by the continually modernizing civilization.  In the middle of the valley is a small lake in which a small floating monastery drifts by the forces of the nature.  This has an allegorical meaning as it supports the notion that everything is part of a greater plan in which individuals can make small ripples that will affect the individual throughout life.Each frame is carefully planned as color, form, and movement come together into a meaningful expression of either spiritual, moral, existential meaning, or a personal meaning which rests behind the eye of the beholder.  The film becomes a sequential succession of spiritual or existential paintings that are rapidly exchanged before the viewers' retina.  The mise-en-scene is exceptionally significant as Ki-duk Kim has left nothing to chance, yet everything is based on chance.  This visual oxymoron is very much like the chaotic expression which nature expresses itself within each season.The story is split into the four seasons as it begins and ends with spring as the title suggests.  The beginning takes place in the spring as an old monk cares for a young boy who discovers the consequence of guilt the hard way as he torments a fish, a frog, and a snake.  The shots have symbolic meaning, yet the many frames offer much room for personal interpretation as the boy deals with everyday life under the supervision of the monk.Summer opens the door to love, affection, and desire as the young boy has become a young man.  This begins with the old monk who receives a young woman that is sick.  The mother of the young woman requests that the monk help to cure her daughter that seems to suffer from some sort of restless melancholic ailment.  The young woman and the young man playfully begin a romantic relationship that leads them into a physical relationship.  This relationship drives the young man to give up a life in the small monastery as he sneaks away an early morning.Fall is the season when the woods change from green to an explosion of color.  Ki-duk Kim use this natural phenomenon of the seasons to a full effect as the season displays the aftermath of a vengeful strikeout from the young man who now is a man in his 30s.  The man now has to learn the consequences of his actions through a painful internal crisis, in which he seeks moral and spiritual redemption by returning to the tranquility of the valley.Winter follows fall and the man is now in his 40s, as he once again returns to the monastery in order to take over for the former monk.  It becomes a time for spiritual search and moral purging for the man who tries to fill the shoes of his former teacher and guide.  This means that he must find a way to deal with his past, present, and future by rigorously following a rough and narrow path.When spring returns the film brings the audience in a full circle as it returns to where the film once started.  The cyclical message is a fundamental cornerstone of Buddhism and the message that the film portrays.  However, it does not mean that things will be the same in the future as each ripple created will cause some change in the environment, which is skillfully depicted through the use of the animals that Ki-duk Kim incorporates into each season.  In the initial spring there is a dog and as summer comes along it brings a rooster while a cat enters with the fall.  A snake appears in the winter as and as the spring returns it brings the audience a turtle.  These animals also represent the end of men's lives as they could be reincarnations of other human's, which is a result of the ripples they once created.",5,Allegorically Introspective and Cyclically Brilliant Cinema,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,3884,"['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'ushers', 'audience', 'silent', 'solitude', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'cinematography', 'effect', 'natural', 'environment', 'environment', 'essential', 'story', 'place', 'idyllic', 'valley', 'untouched', 'continually', 'modernizing', 'civilization', 'middle', 'valley', 'small', 'lake', 'small', 'floating', 'monastery', 'drifts', 'forces', 'nature', 'allegorical', 'meaning', 'notion', 'everything', 'part', 'greater', 'plan', 'individuals', 'can', 'make', 'small', 'ripples', 'will', 'affect', 'individual', 'life.Each', 'frame', 'carefully', 'planned', 'color', 'form', 'movement', 'come', 'together', 'meaningful', 'expression', 'spiritual', 'moral', 'existential', 'meaning', 'personal', 'meaning', 'eye', 'beholder', 'film', 'sequential', 'succession', 'spiritual', 'existential', 'paintings', 'are', 'rapidly', 'exchanged', 'viewers', 'retina', 'mise-en-scene', 'exceptionally', 'significant', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'left', 'nothing', 'chance', 'yet', 'everything', 'based', 'chance', 'visual', 'oxymoron', 'very', 'much', 'chaotic', 'expression', 'nature', 'season.The', 'story', 'split', 'four', 'seasons', 'spring', 'title', 'beginning', 'place', 'spring', 'old', 'monk', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'consequence', 'guilt', 'hard', 'way', 'fish', 'frog', 'snake', 'shots', 'have', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'many', 'frames', 'offer', 'much', 'room', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'boy', 'deals', 'everyday', 'life', 'supervision', 'monk.Summer', 'door', 'love', 'affection', 'desire', 'young', 'boy', 'become', 'young', 'man', 'old', 'monk', 'who', 'young', 'woman', 'sick', 'mother', 'young', 'woman', 'monk', 'help', 'cure', 'daughter', 'suffer', 'sort', 'restless', 'melancholic', 'ailment', 'young', 'woman', 'young', 'man', 'playfully', 'begin', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'physical', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'young', 'man', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'small', 'monastery', 'away', 'early', 'morning.Fall', 'season', 'when', 'woods', 'change', 'green', 'explosion', 'color', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'use', 'natural', 'phenomenon', 'seasons', 'full', 'effect', 'season', 'aftermath', 'vengeful', 'strikeout', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'man', '30s', 'man', 'now', 'learn', 'consequences', 'actions', 'painful', 'internal', 'crisis', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'redemption', 'returning', 'tranquility', 'valley.Winter', 'fall', 'man', 'now', '40s', 'once', 'again', 'returns', 'monastery', 'order', 'take', 'over', 'former', 'monk', 'time', 'spiritual', 'search', 'moral', 'purging', 'man', 'who', 'fill', 'shoes', 'former', 'teacher', 'guide', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'rigorously', 'following', 'rough', 'narrow', 'path.When', 'spring', 'film', 'audience', 'full', 'circle', 'where', 'film', 'once', 'started', 'cyclical', 'message', 'fundamental', 'cornerstone', 'Buddhism', 'message', 'film', 'portrays', 'However', 'not', 'mean', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'future', 'ripple', 'created', 'will', 'cause', 'change', 'environment', 'skillfully', 'depicted', 'use', 'animals', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'season', 'initial', 'spring', 'dog', 'summer', 'rooster', 'cat', 'enters', 'fall', 'snake', 'winter', 'as', 'spring', 'audience', 'turtle', 'animals', 'also', 'represent', 'end', 'men', 'lives', 'could', 'be', 'reincarnations', 'other', 'human', 'result', 'ripples', 'once', 'created']",N/A

Known as a bad boy director in Asian cinema for films about prostitution (The Isle) and violence (Bad Guy), here he focuses on the tenets of Buddhism.  The verbal language of the film is so sparse, that it really translates beautifully to an international audience.  The cinematography and images used are profoundly beautiful and give a sense of timelessness to the picture.  For audiences in the United States used to Hollywood formulas where chains of events unfold quickly, this requires patient adjustment, but is well worth the wait.  The images of the floating house in the middle of the lake, the impermanence of life as well as its abundance, and the gorgeous natural setting of mountains and water make this a handsome film.  While some of the images left me puzzled such as the mother who hides her face underneath a purple scarf, it leaves room for interpretation such as the doorways that seemingly stand without walls.  All of the actors deliver powerful emotional performances.  The spiritual Buddhist devotions frame the film. Its intense human emotions of desire, anger and longing drive the film forward.

The Wise One's temple hut on the lake - more or less the physical heart of the film's story - is treated like heaven's courtyard, with stupefying cinematography to linger in your mind long after. The alluring mystery of land and water, gorgeously invoked, enshrines with perfect balance a brutally real story of redemption and acceptance. Through each season's segment, director Kim Ki-Duk frees a vital flow that deeply mirrors the Buddhist essence. Best, it's a spiritual film that miraculously escapes becoming a moral fable. The conscious absence of sentimentality leaves truth alive and real, and points silently to cinema's inherent art to reveal the Buddhist aesthetic. It's a beautiful movie, well worth the time and money. Not Buddhist? you'll love it anyway because truth is fecund, but for Buddhists the film offers unique lessons without distraction, and that's refreshing. The winter scenes of ice and snow (including a waterfall frozen in full plunge!) are among the most pungent, and beautiful, and contain as well key elements of the story itself.

Well, it turns out that's not the case, but it's still a good movie. In fact I don't put this near the level of Vertical Ray in any way, from performances to music to ""the look"" of it, etc...As for the meat of the movie itself and the characters, I like it more as it goes along. The parts of the movie where everything... the actors, the cinematography, the emotional content, etc... all really come together are in the ""Fall, Winter...and Spring"" sections of the movie...particularly from late Fall through Winter.I guess where I would mainly fault this movie is for the first and third people playing the young monk. I had problems getting myself to care at all about what happened to him during these two actors time inhabiting the role. I thought the little kid was just flat-out annoying. The teen-years kid was good, though. Particularly his interactions with the girl. Those moments were good at capturing quiet teenage awkwardness, which of course is intensified in his case since he seems to have always lived in the middle of a lake with an old man. That's not the peak scenario for learning how to be sociable with the ladies. Then the third guy (age 30) as the monk... he was rather melodramatic. He could be on a soap opera.This movie is still very much worth your time, though. There are some very nice shots, and the old master is the core of the movie, at least for me. I quite liked his performance.This is a movie that will make you think, but it doesn't direct you as to what to think about. It's very respectful of the audience in that way. It doesn't assume you need your hand held to have an emotional response or to think about something. It's sort of just a vague spark meant to send your mind wherever it may go.

It was an excellent film that emphasized on the actions and expressions of the actors, rather than the spoken word.  However, when words were spoken, they came out like a loud roar as if each character awoken from their repressive experiences.Yes, the film is chronologically structured,with its emphasis on the four seasons, which allows the audience to understand the meaning of the story in a less complex manner.  With the change of seasons and the growth of the main characters, as played by Ki-duk Kim and Yeong-su Oh, there exists a relationship that appears complex, but simple at the same time between Master and student.  As part of the student's life there are extreme lessons that he has been faced to deal with as a child, a young man who displays his natural growth, and eventually as a Master.This is a film about the lessons in life that an individual experiences.  It's about the good as well as the bad.  But for the most part, it's about growth.  The landscape captures the moments quite well with its serene nature, and its connections with nature:  the forest, the lake, the waterfall, the rooster, the cat, the snake, and a host of other creatures are very suggestive to the symbolism that derive from Eastern culture.I highly recommend this film for its beauty and its untiring narrative of ""coming of age.""

836746,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B0002J4X20,shaun brammer,"[3, 3]","I have always loved minimalist films, they are a true test of talent. Working with so little, trying to show so much. These are the types of films that some people will never get, but others will understand them instantly. Regardless of whether one &#8216;gets&#8217; it or not, everyone pauses for a moment to think about the film. Asia, especially Japan and Korea, have made some great minimalist films over the decades. I discovered one of these gems from South Korea directed by Ki-duk Kim called, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring. I found it quite easy to get lost in this film.This film has one setting, Jusan Pond, a remote body of water nestled in a valley of verdant nature in the Korean countryside. In a small Buddhist temple, that floats upon the surface of the pond, an old monk, played by Yeong-su Oh, raises a young boy. The film shows the boy at different times of his life and during the succession of seasons. Each time the season changes there seems to be a new lesson to learn about life, though each season ties together into one lifetime. So, in summer, the master&#8217;s charge is a small child, played by, Jong-oh Kim and he has to learn the lesson ofloss, from his old master. When spring comes he is a young man, played by, Jae-kyeong Seo, who falls in love and suffers because he has not learned the lesson of lust vs. love. In fall, he is an adult, played expertly by Young-min Kim, who seeks the temple as a refuge from his crimes he has committed in the world. In winter he is much older, and now played by the director himself, and comes back to claim the now empty temple as his own and repeats the cycle by becoming a care taker of life himself.This is one of the few films in the world were the setting is also a character. The small wooden temple floats on a clear pond with the surrounding mountains full of trees growing from their rocky faces. The beauty of this small place speaks volumes and compliments the scenes when the student learns the lessons taught by his old Buddhist master. There is a quiet magic that occurs as each season changes and the doors that stand at the edged of the pond open and close with each changing scene. Each of the seasons is majestic in it&#8217;s beauty and the temple, while created just for the film, is aged to match the passage of time and seems to belong floating on that small pond for all eternity.The acting is wonderful. While the master remains the calm teacher, the child goes through so many fits of emotion. He is swayed by the suffering he finds himself the author of. The young actor truly seems troubled by the fate of the woodland creatures. He is swayed by the quite beauty of a young woman, played by Yeo-jin Ha, who comes to the temple to stay for health reasons. He becomes confused and puppy like in his affection. His passion for her causes him to leave the temple. He is swayed by his rage and when he returns from the world seeking refuge he is broken and hurting. The scenes delivered by Young-min Kim as he smashes the ponds surface while in blinding tears is moving. When the police come to take him away from the valley to face his crimes, the old monk gives him a last lesson. There is powerful scene of the young monk carving a sutra into the wooden deck of the temple to drive away his over powering emotions. When the director becomes the adult and returns to the temple to take his masters place, you see him reteach himself his master&#8217;s lessons and restores the temple. At the end, becoming a caretaker for another lost child like himself.The movie is a look at life, loss, and suffering. It is a present day Buddhist fable that bridges the modern world with the ancient past were a temple like this one could exist. Many times during the movie I was lost in the peace of the old master&#8217;s face. I wanted to close my eyes and feel the wind that moved the tiny temple from shore to shore. There were many powerful scenes, like the placing of a Buddhist statue at the summit of one of the mountains overlooking the pond, near the end of the movie. I really can not say enough good things about this film. It spoke of the need to protect nature, to care for one another, and to care for yourself. To not allow yourself to be swayed by your passions, but by your compassion. I could easily call this a religious movie, but it doesn&#8217;t preach, it just shows you what can happen, and how to heal the suffering caused, by living blindly. I recommend you watch this movie without interruptions, on a day when you have time to reflect afterwards. Allow yourself to be lost along the shores of Jusan Pond. This is not a movie to think through, just experience and feel, to take in and breathe out.

The extreme of the young boy's fall from being guilt ridden over his role in killing various animals to ultimately killing a human being as an adult is a stretch.  And the manner in which the teacher, completely cut off from civilization, finds out that his former pupil killed is equally far fetched.Another shortcoming was the actors chosen to represent the boy at various stages in his life.  The actor chosen for Fall looked nothing, and I mean nothing, like either the late teen/early adult version of the protagonist or the slightly later in life version of himself in Winter.  The selection of the Fall actor was all the worse for the film in that the guy couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Also, if you are among those who are titillated by warnings of strong sexual content then let me give you a warning myself.  The sexual scenes consist of nothing more than repeated showings of a naked man's behind thrusting up and down on a woman who looks like she is about 13 years old.For a similarly beautiful but better Korean film, I would recommend passing this up and purchasing ""Chihwaseon"" instead.",1,One Viewing Enough,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1457,"['director', 'Ki-Duk', 'Kim', 'redeemed', 'indescribably', 'bad', 'film', 'Isle', 'effort', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anything', 'more', 'rental', 'one', 'time', 'viewing.I', 'enjoyed', 'minimalist', 'nature', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'story', 'overall', 'characters', 'extreme', 'young', 'boy', 'fall', 'being', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'role', 'killing', 'various', 'animals', 'ultimately', 'killing', 'human', 'being', 'adult', 'stretch', 'manner', 'teacher', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'civilization', 'out', 'former', 'pupil', 'killed', 'equally', 'far', 'fetched.Another', 'shortcoming', 'was', 'actors', 'chosen', 'represent', 'boy', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'actor', 'chosen', 'Fall', 'looked', 'nothing', 'mean', 'nothing', 'late', 'teen/early', 'adult', 'version', 'protagonist', 'slightly', 'later', 'life', 'version', 'Winter', 'selection', 'Fall', 'actor', 'was', 'worse', 'film', 'guy', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'wet', 'paper', 'bag.Also', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'titillated', 'warnings', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content', 'then', 'let', 'give', 'warning', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'consist', 'nothing', 'more', 'repeated', 'showings', 'naked', 'man', 'thrusting', 'up', 'down', 'woman', 'who', '13', 'years', 'old.For', 'similarly', 'beautiful', 'better', 'Korean', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'passing', 'up', 'purchasing', 'Chihwaseon', 'instead']",N/A

If you know Kim Ki-Duk, his early films were more grim and more about exploring the darker side of humanity(which I personally prefer). However, this film is completely different than his previous films. This one is more poetic, quiet, and visually beautiful. One thing I will point about this film that is unarguable is the cinematography and the location: it is just beautiful scenery with amazing cinematography. And for those thinking that this film is about Buddhism, it's the complete opposite. It's actually delving into the main character's struggle between his ""Earthly"" urges and his devotion to his religion. You see more of the human-side of the character, often losing to the earthly desires and urges, opposite to following his belief(which I find it way more interesting). He goes against just about everything that's against Buddhism and even disowns his religion at one point. But this film does not go too much into the religious aspect; rather, you see a person who devoted his life to a certain belief and you're just seeing his struggles. Even if you aren't focusing on the story, the visual aspect alone is a definite reason to watch this film. Even if the story doesn't compel you, the visual aspect definitely will(especially if you appreciate brilliant cinematography). This is one of Kim Ki-Duk's finest film and I'd say this is a must check out for Kim Ki-Duk fans, or just any cinema lovers/appreciators.",5,Journey of a Man,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,1546,"[""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'artistic', 'success', 'personal', 'opinion', 'know', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'early', 'films', 'were', 'more', 'grim', 'more', 'exploring', 'darker', 'side', 'humanity', 'personally', 'prefer', 'However', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'previous', 'films', 'one', 'more', 'poetic', 'quiet', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'point', 'film', 'unarguable', 'cinematography', 'location', 'just', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'thinking', 'film', 'Buddhism', 'complete', 'opposite', 'actually', 'delving', 'main', 'character', 'struggle', 'Earthly', 'urges', 'devotion', 'religion', 'see', 'more', 'human-side', 'character', 'often', 'losing', 'earthly', 'desires', 'urges', 'opposite', 'following', 'belief', 'find', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'everything', 'Buddhism', 'even', 'disowns', 'religion', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'religious', 'aspect', 'rather', 'see', 'person', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'certain', 'belief', ""'re"", 'just', 'seeing', 'struggles', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'focusing', 'story', 'visual', 'aspect', 'alone', 'definite', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'Even', 'story', ""n't"", 'compel', 'visual', 'aspect', 'definitely', 'will', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'one', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'finest', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'fans', 'just', 'cinema', 'lovers/appreciators']",N/A

If you are addicted (or conditioned) to only appreciate hollywood's 'lowest common denominator' style of film-making. filled with non-stop action, then this movie may bore you to tears. There's not one car chase scene in it. However, this is an exquisite piece of filmaking.This is a different kind of film making altogether... as different from mainstream movies as the title suggests it is. First off, there is almost no dialog in it. It communicates almost entirely-or almost two hours-through very skillful, stunning visuals. And it's a fascinating story that examines the various 'seasons' that span the course of an individuals life. In this case, they are spent almost entirely in isolation in nature.Visually, the film is breathtaking, the location being a mountain lake set high in an alpine environment surrounded by scenic mountain peaks of undefiled nature.  The slow relaxed pace in which the film unfolds is like a long relaxed walk in the woods... you begin to notice the DETAILS that give such an experience meaning.There's not much more I wish to add, except that it's quite memorable and it moved me to great emotion.

The concept is clever, the acting is subtle, but strong, and the scenery is georgous!  Additionally, the presentation of religion, in this case Buddhism, in a manner that is pervasive, yet unobtrusive, earns big points from me, as a chaplain.As an aside, one reviewer faulted the FALL portion of the film, suggesting that the young fallen monk character was too extremely different in appearance and character from what he was in the other portions.  To the contrary, this scene was his low point--he had left the faith for the allure of desire (aka lust or romantic style love), and it had destroyed the personality Buddhism was supposed to instill in him.  He needed to be out of character in this scene (showing extreme emotions and ragged appearance).In spite of my praise for this production, I must say...wow is this film slow!  Film makers need to come off the mountain occasionally, and remember that most movie goers have children, busy lives, and often approach a movie desiring to relax and enjoy the literary ride, as much as to learn and be challenged.  The lack of dialogue, the extreme passive and calm ambiance of most of the film, meant that my Korean wife (who would be most able to appreciate the cultural and asthetic points of the film) fell asleep before it ended.  Only my stubborn heritage kept me awake.Bottom-line:  This is a quality production, sure to earn high marks from critics with an eye for the artistic.

Although both genres are useful and pleasant, intimate movies like this one will only draw a small crowd of avid movie fans. With a storyline that fits on a third of a regular-sized paper sheet, it's not in the plot that the main merit of this movie resides. After all, it's only about the tough yet simple life of a young boy in the hands of a priest on a tiny, isolated artificial island, his discovery of the outside world, of love, and his closing the circle with himself in the end. Simple. Yet, there is such an explosion of poetry in the pictures, the landscapes, acting, characters, colors, the shooting style is of such a pristine beauty that the movie, although slow-paced, quickly catches the attentive viewer's interest.

836755,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0002J4X20,Turfseer,"[2, 5]","Warning: This review may contain spoilers--'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring', an offbeat film from Korea can best be described as a fable. It focuses on a Buddhist monk who lives in a 'monastery' (actually a small house in the middle of a lake) cut off from civilization. The film has five sequences, each set in successive seasons of the year. However, the action does not occur one season after another--there are gaps in years between each season.In the first 'Spring' sequence, the monk (who appears to be in his 60s) is mentoring an apprentice, a young boy who appears to be no more than 10 years of age. The boy takes delight in attaching a stone to various creatures he finds in the lake: a fish, a frog and a snake. The monk is appalled by the boy's cruelty and decides to teach him a lesson by attaching a rock with some rope around his back while he sleeps. He orders the boy to find the creatures, untie the stones from them and then he will remove the rock. Foreshadowing violence to come, the monk warns the boy that if any of the creatures dies, this will weigh heavily upon his heart for the rest of his life. Sure enough, when the boy returns, the fish is dead and it appears that the snake might be dead too; he is able to find the frog and remove the string and stone from that creature.In the next 'Summer' sequence, a mother leaves a young woman with the Monk as she is suffering from some sort of physical malady which is not made clear. The monk indicates that her physical problems will go away once she deals with the afflictions of her soul. The boy, now a young man of about twenty, takes a sexual interest in the young woman who initially rebuffs him. We never learn anything about this young girl's personality and for some reason she eventually gives in to the Young Adult Monk's advances and has sex with him on a number of occasions. When the old Monk finds out about this, he banishes the girl from the monastery but the Young Adult Monk has fallen in love with her and leaves the island to pursue her. Before he leaves, the Old Monk warns the Young Adult Monk that lust can only lead to murder.In the third 'Fall' sequence, the Old Monk has just returned with provisions he has obtained off the island. While unwrapping a newspaper which contains his lunch, he notices an article stating that his former pupil has murdered the girl that he had years before fallen in love with and was now wanted by the authorities. The former pupil now shows up at the island and makes it clear to the Old Monk that he killed his wife due to her infidelity and that he was still full of rage. In response, the Old Monk paints numerous cryptic characters on the deck of the house and orders his former pupil to carve out the letters one by one with a knife. He explains this will help him overcome his rage. Meanwhile, two detectives appear on the scene and take the Old Monk's former pupil away (presumably out of respect for the reputation of the Old Monk, they wait until daybreak to allow the former pupil to finish carving the letters before he's taken into custody). Later, the Old Monk commits suicide through self-immolation, while sitting inside a rowboat on the lake.Years pass when we arrive at the fourth ""Winter"" sequence. The former pupil is now much older and presumably has been released from prison. He returns to his old haunts on the island and once again takes up the disciplined practice of Buddhism which he rejected as a youth. A mysterious woman (her face covered with a shroud) walks across the iced-over lake and leaves an infant in the new monk's care. She mysteriously falls through a hole in the ice and drowns. In an apparent act of repentance for past sins, the new monk attach's a stone to his back and climbs up a mountain overlooking the island.Finally, there is a coda to the movie--a fifth sequence: spring again! Now life has come full circle. The pupil has now become the master and is teaching the young boy who earlier had been left in his care by the mysterious woman.Despite the film's originality, troubling questions remain. The young woman who has been brought to the Old Monk to be healed ends up becoming the sexual object of the Young Monk. Even though it's clear that the Old Monk knows that there are highly unethical things going on, he does nothing to prevent his charge from taking advantage of her. His response is to merely banish her from the island. He could have drawn boundaries from the beginning preventing his former pupil from acting the way he did. More troubling is the girl herself. What is it about the Young Monk that attracts him to her? For someone who's had no experience with women, most women would not be attracted to such a bumbling novice. We just don't know enough about the young woman to make us believe that she would take up so easily with the Young Monk.More troubling is the idea that former pupil would end up a murderer. After all that good work the Old Monk does with the kid, apparently not enough of his good advice sinks in. Why exactly does the Young Monk become so jealous that he would resort to killing the woman he has fallen in love with? Most people do not become obsessed as the Young Monk does and the film's creator never explains why. Instead, there's a simple suggestion that everything here is predestined. Still, 'SSFW..and Spring again' features beautiful cinematography and gets high marks for being an original story which will keep your interest to the end.",3,Original story with troubling questions

It is as if they sense the nuance in the red of autumn leaves and the frailty of tree branches in winter, absorbing their visual, emotional weight.  Even in Japan, they believe everything from rocks to river streams are inhabited by ""kami,"" or spirits.Director Kim Ki-Duk has successfully emphasized each season's importance by using their qualities as parallels to a young man's life, from boyhood to a troubled adulthood, as well as his relationship with an old monk who he grows up with on a raft temple at the center of a pristine Korean lake, in which the entirety of the film takes place.  Often times, the subtle details of the natural backround speak louder than the few words found in Kim's accomplished minimalist screenplay.Also, each season encompasses a moral theme.  For instance, ""Summer"" tells of how the film's central character, now a teenager, is sexually awakened by a sickly girl his age who comes to be healed by the old monk.  However, their relationship is carelessly founded upon lust, since the boy has never encountered a woman before, and is more curious than wise.  By the end of this canto of Kim's tone poem, the old monk recognizes their far from discreet sexual adventures, and scolds him, saying, ""Lust leads to the desire to possess, and that leads to murderous intent.""  I should not elaborate on this or the other seasons any more so than what I've already written, because like a flower's progressive blooming, it is not as spectacular heard as it is experienced first hand.Some have complained this film is too simplistic.  In many ways, the structure is quite simple, but for effect.  It is a fable that must be expressed in a form at ease with itself and how it tells a story.  In fact, the abstract qualities make 'Spring, Summer' stronger as a whole, becoming more accessible and applicable to your personal life.  With each scene and situation, you are able to catch a glimpse of yourself beneath the lake or in the eyes of an old man who may lose touch with a young flame carefully kindled through his adulthood.  However, though the simplicity makes watching it a more moving experience, it unfortunately makes it less memorable as the days after viewing pass by.The lack of complexity sometimes causes pieces of the film to fade quickly, because, depending on who you are, you may not be able to identify with such broad themes as well as you might with a better universalized film.  Technically, though, 'Spring, Summer' is a wonder; it contains beautiful cinematography, a powerful underscore, and art direction that perfectly complies with the demand for concise, cohesive symbolism.  The direction is also minimalist, much like the screenplay, and adds a quiet efflorescence that grows endearing and leaves you breathless by the film's end.Ultimately, 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring' is a cinematic beacon of hope, not only in message, but in its art form, as well.  It both celebrates the cyclical patterns of life that encourage us to keep going and contributes to a growing reaffirmation that cinema still has its artistic center and may not die out under the heavy, artificial light of those ""of-the-moment"" big-budget duds.",5,A brilliant work of cinematic art not to be missed!,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,3327,"['poetry', 'art', 'religion', 'day', 'life', 'seasons', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'integral', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'Korea', 'Asian', 'cultures', 'sense', 'nuance', 'red', 'autumn', 'leaves', 'frailty', 'tree', 'branches', 'winter', 'absorbing', 'visual', 'emotional', 'weight', 'Even', 'Japan', 'believe', 'everything', 'rocks', 'river', 'streams', 'are', 'inhabited', 'kami', 'spirits.Director', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'successfully', 'emphasized', 'season', 'importance', 'using', 'qualities', 'parallels', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'boyhood', 'troubled', 'adulthood', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'old', 'monk', 'who', 'up', 'raft', 'temple', 'center', 'pristine', 'Korean', 'lake', 'entirety', 'film', 'place', 'Often', 'subtle', 'details', 'natural', 'backround', 'speak', 'louder', 'few', 'words', 'found', 'Kim', 'accomplished', 'minimalist', 'screenplay.Also', 'season', 'moral', 'theme', 'instance', 'Summer', 'tells', 'how', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'now', 'teenager', 'sexually', 'awakened', 'sickly', 'girl', 'age', 'who', 'be', 'healed', 'old', 'monk', 'However', 'relationship', 'carelessly', 'founded', 'upon', 'lust', 'boy', 'never', 'encountered', 'woman', 'more', 'curious', 'wise', 'end', 'canto', 'Kim', 'tone', 'poem', 'old', 'monk', 'far', 'discreet', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'saying', 'Lust', 'desire', 'possess', 'murderous', 'intent', 'should', 'not', 'elaborate', 'other', 'seasons', 'more', 'so', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'written', 'flower', 'progressive', 'blooming', 'not', 'spectacular', 'heard', 'experienced', 'first', 'hand.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'too', 'simplistic', 'many', 'ways', 'structure', 'quite', 'simple', 'effect', 'fable', 'must', 'be', 'expressed', 'form', 'ease', 'how', 'story', 'fact', 'abstract', 'qualities', 'make', ""'Spring"", 'Summer', 'stronger', 'whole', 'becoming', 'more', 'accessible', 'applicable', 'personal', 'life', 'scene', 'situation', 'are', 'able', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'lake', 'eyes', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'lose', 'touch', 'young', 'flame', 'carefully', 'kindled', 'adulthood', 'However', 'simplicity', 'watching', 'more', 'moving', 'experience', 'unfortunately', 'less', 'memorable', 'days', 'viewing', 'pass', 'by.The', 'lack', 'complexity', 'sometimes', 'pieces', 'film', 'fade', 'quickly', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'such', 'broad', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'better', 'universalized', 'film', 'Technically', ""'Spring"", 'Summer', 'wonder', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'powerful', 'underscore', 'art', 'direction', 'perfectly', 'demand', 'concise', 'cohesive', 'symbolism', 'direction', 'also', 'minimalist', 'much', 'screenplay', 'quiet', 'efflorescence', 'endearing', 'breathless', 'film', 'end.Ultimately', ""'Spring"", 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'cinematic', 'beacon', 'hope', 'not', 'only', 'message', 'art', 'form', 'as', 'well', 'cyclical', 'patterns', 'life', 'encourage', 'keep', 'going', 'contributes', 'growing', 'reaffirmation', 'cinema', 'still', 'artistic', 'center', 'may', 'not', 'die', 'out', 'heavy', 'artificial', 'light', 'of-the-moment', 'big-budget', 'duds']",N/A

The master knows the young boy, student, rebel, master are the seasons -- not only of nature but of human nature in particular. It inspires some questions however: what does this say of the role of women? Why does murder necessarily follow possession? Must all of us carry a stone in our hearts from our youth? If a master knows all of this is there no way to teach the young apart from them learning the lessons for themselves? Perhaps that is what the movie intends to do. Other questions: who is the snake? The frog lives, but the fish and snake both die. Why does the loss of the snake cause the most tears?I cannot think of another movie that does this and does it so well.

An elder Buddhist monk raises a younger monk with a quiet and unobtrusive wisdom. The scene is set in a small floating monastery where the two live alone but for one animal companion, the choice of animal changing with each season, adding layers of intriguing symbolic meaning. Surrounding the floating monastery is a lake set among mountains.Beginning in the spring of the boy's life, when he is a child learning about the world around him and within him, the wise older man watches the naive young boy engage in lessons proffered by nature. He lets the boy learn on his own, watching from a distance, and only steps in when it is time to do so. In perhaps the film's most profound statement, he watches as the boy, chuckling to himself, ties string around a fish he catches in the lake, and attaches it to a stone. The child takes joy in the struggling of the fish when he releases it back into the water, where the fish is unable to swim freely. The boy repeats this with a frog, with a snake, gleefully tormenting his fellow creatures. From the woods above the shore of the water, the elder monk watches. He is a silent observer, allowing the boy to engage in his mischief. It is only at night, when the boy sleeps, that the monk ties a rock to the boy's back, precisely as the boy did with the tiny creatures. When the boy wakes upon morning, he finds himself weighed down with the rock, and when he questions the elder man, is told that the rock will not be removed until the boy removes the stones he tied to the creatures the day before. Should he not have rescued the creatures in time, the stone will then be a weight the boy must carry in his heart ever after.The boy seeks out the creatures he has tormented. He finds the little fish dead in the water, still tied to its stone. Teary eyed, he buries it. The frog, though exhausted from its added weight, survives. The snake, however, the boy finds bloodied and dead, attacked by other creatures while unable to escape, and the boy sobs with regret for what he has done.This is but the first of many lessons the boy must learn as he grows into a man over the course of the seasons of his life and the life around him. There are lessons of love and lust as the manchild, and then the adult man, confuses the two; there are lessons of violence and retribution; lessons of penitence and forgiveness; lessons on dealing with one's own emotions and inner turbulence; lessons of honor and death and rebirth. There is a repetition of the stone tied to the man as he reaches a higher level of understanding, once the elder monk has died, and this time the man has tied the stone to himself as he presses to reach for a higher level of endurance, wisdom, and reverence.While seemingly simple, this wonderful film is in actuality complex and rich with beauty and symbolism, cutting to the core of a man's nature and the nature of life. It can be watched many times over to enjoy fully its intricacies. It is subtitled, yet one can watch it, and perhaps even should--at least once--without the words, for there are few, and the images convey all that must be understood.Perhaps the greatest skill in movie-making is not the amount of special effects incorporated in its making, as to what level of beauty and wisdom one can bring to the screen without anything other than a director's fine eye and profoundly simple yet wise insights.Highly recommended.",5,Simple Pleasures and Profound Lessons,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,3743,"['age', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'not', 'entirely', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'high', 'adventure', 'action', 'action', 'scenes', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'respite', 'view', 'Korean', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'simplicity.Korean', 'director', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'created', 'film', 'centered', 'seasons', 'man', 'life', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'seasons', 'nature', 'elder', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'younger', 'monk', 'quiet', 'unobtrusive', 'wisdom', 'scene', 'set', 'small', 'floating', 'monastery', 'where', 'two', 'live', 'alone', 'one', 'animal', 'companion', 'choice', 'animal', 'changing', 'season', 'adding', 'layers', 'intriguing', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'Surrounding', 'floating', 'monastery', 'lake', 'set', 'mountains.Beginning', 'spring', 'boy', 'life', 'when', 'child', 'learning', 'world', 'wise', 'older', 'man', 'naive', 'young', 'boy', 'engage', 'lessons', 'proffered', 'nature', 'boy', 'learn', 'own', 'watching', 'distance', 'only', 'steps', 'when', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'perhaps', 'film', 'most', 'profound', 'statement', 'boy', 'chuckling', 'ties', 'string', 'fish', 'lake', 'stone', 'child', 'joy', 'struggling', 'fish', 'when', 'back', 'water', 'where', 'fish', 'unable', 'swim', 'freely', 'boy', 'frog', 'snake', 'gleefully', 'tormenting', 'fellow', 'creatures', 'woods', 'shore', 'water', 'elder', 'monk', 'watches', 'silent', 'observer', 'allowing', 'boy', 'engage', 'mischief', 'only', 'night', 'when', 'boy', 'sleeps', 'monk', 'rock', 'boy', 'back', 'precisely', 'boy', 'did', 'tiny', 'creatures', 'When', 'boy', 'morning', 'weighed', 'down', 'rock', 'when', 'questions', 'elder', 'man', 'told', 'rock', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'removed', 'boy', 'stones', 'tied', 'creatures', 'day', 'Should', 'not', 'have', 'rescued', 'creatures', 'time', 'stone', 'will', 'then', 'be', 'weight', 'boy', 'must', 'carry', 'heart', 'ever', 'after.The', 'boy', 'out', 'creatures', 'tormented', 'little', 'fish', 'dead', 'water', 'still', 'tied', 'stone', 'Teary', 'eyed', 'frog', 'though', 'exhausted', 'added', 'weight', 'snake', 'however', 'boy', 'bloodied', 'dead', 'attacked', 'other', 'creatures', 'unable', 'escape', 'boy', 'sobs', 'regret', 'what', 'done.This', 'first', 'many', 'lessons', 'boy', 'must', 'learn', 'man', 'course', 'seasons', 'life', 'life', 'are', 'lessons', 'love', 'lust', 'manchild', 'then', 'adult', 'man', 'two', 'are', 'lessons', 'violence', 'retribution', 'lessons', 'penitence', 'forgiveness', 'lessons', 'dealing', 'one', 'own', 'emotions', 'inner', 'turbulence', 'lessons', 'honor', 'death', 'rebirth', 'repetition', 'stone', 'tied', 'man', 'higher', 'level', 'understanding', 'once', 'elder', 'monk', 'died', 'time', 'man', 'tied', 'stone', 'reach', 'higher', 'level', 'endurance', 'wisdom', 'reverence.While', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'wonderful', 'film', 'actuality', 'complex', 'rich', 'beauty', 'symbolism', 'cutting', 'core', 'man', 'nature', 'nature', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'intricacies', 'subtitled', 'yet', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'perhaps', 'even', 'should', 'least', 'once', 'words', 'are', 'few', 'images', 'convey', 'must', 'be', 'greatest', 'skill', 'movie-making', 'not', 'amount', 'special', 'effects', 'incorporated', 'making', 'what', 'level', 'beauty', 'wisdom', 'one', 'can', 'bring', 'screen', 'anything', 'other', 'director', 'fine', 'eye', 'profoundly', 'simple', 'yet', 'wise', 'insights.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
