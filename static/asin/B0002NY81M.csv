841721,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B0002NY81M,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[16, 17]","Ellen: The Complete Season One might as well be considered completely seperate from the rest of the series.  When the first season originally aired, it was titled 'These Friends of Mine' and was much more Seinfeldish than it grew to be by the second, and especially third seasons.  In the first season, Ellen has not come out of the closet yet (that is still 3 seasons away).  It is kind of weird seeing her dating men, as you can totally see there is no chemistry there at all.  Also, later series regulars Joely Fisher and Jeremy Piven have not yet joined the cast.  There are two other female friends featured here that are inexplicably gone by the end of these 13 episodes and never return.  Joely Fisher is then first introduced in the first episode of Season 2 with no explanation as well.With that being said, even though there are major differences between this first season and the rest of the series, it is still a great, funny show.  Ellen truly is a comedic genius and she works well with this first season cast (though I must say she has much better chemistry with the later casts).  Amazon Marketplace has this set for sale pretty cheap; it's definitely worth a look, whether you are a current Ellen fan, or new to the series.  The DVDs do not have many special features; there is a commentary or two (with Ellen herself conspicuously absent) and some biographies and that's about it.  But you do get 13 pretty darn funny episodes!

I think Ellen Degeneres is the funniest person on the planet, but this sitcom has only moments of her ""funnyness."" This show reminds me SO MUCH of Three's Company, where the entire ""dilemma"" in each episode can be resolved by one character simply telling the truth. It actually gets annoying sometimes. There's only one John Ritter, so that kind of comedy doesn't bother me when I'm watching Joyce DeWitt and John Ritter. But it just didn't seem to work here.

841724,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B0002NY81M,David Seaman,"[0, 0]","Marlens and Black created the sit-com ""Ellen"" in 1990 starin g the gifted ellen DeGeneres. It became famous (and historical) because it was the first TV show where the central character came out and decalred her homosexuality on screen. Ellen became an importyant part of television histyory, paving the way for ""Will & Grace"" and ""Modern Family"" but that's not what this review is about.As with any series (with the possible esception of ""fasier"") this series began with a rocky start. In fact, tyhe chacraters and writingh eeally didn;ty fall into place until halfway through season one. Season one was a ""fast jobv"" network mid-year5 pick up and it took some time for the producers and writers to see what it is that Ellen is capoable of doing. They shifted from the script wored for word to allowing the camera to roll as Degeneres would improvise one of her now famous rambles. This season includes the spectacular t4easer in which Ellen puyts the jug of water on the cooler in her kitchen , spilling gallons of water everywhere and, when it was done3, settlped back and sai8d, ""There. That's done."" The scripts began edging toward farce and where none of them hit Feydeau, the cast stayed in character as Ellen took ordinary situations and made them funny as hell. By tyhe end of season one it's clear that this was a find as remarkable as Lucille Ball andMary Tyler Moore.The supporting cast is fgine here and where most of them were replaced for the se4cond season I am not certain this was a wise choice. Maggie Wheeler was a better ""Paige"" character than Paige was, but in the same token she;d have been forgotten here and then Marta Kaufman ansd David Crane would never hjave put her on "":Friends"" as the remarkable and nev er to be forgotten Janice. It's nice to see this beautiful woman use her real voice, her real comedic ckills in a subtle way and her character has developed beautifully by the end of the season. Audrey is introduced in this season as a married negatyive irritant whom Ellen dislikes and then reapperas in season two as the single, pink encrusted multyi-milliopnaire that we grew to love. Ayre GRossis remarkable from day one and indeed one of the sad points of the show was his decisiopn to leave. (Jeremy Priven made a damned good replacement bringing a new dynamic)Season one focuses a great deal on Ellen and dating (indeed, one suitor calls her from the toilet ruining any cyance of her ever seeing him again.) Ass time went by it became clkear that not only was the actress tyired of being closetetd but she'd be damned if her character would also. But all things have a start and season one of Ellen, though not as weak as season five, is a good start. The brilliance of this show falls in seasons two through four buty one and five work as nice bookwends. If you;ve limited money, skip this season and buy the others, but in truth, there is a great deal of above average comedy and writing on this disc. And Degeneres made sacrificesw for mankind. For that alone, we all need to be aware. The laughs are simply a bonus.",4,A bumpt start but brilliance by episode six,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,3061,"['Marlens', 'Black', 'created', 'sit-com', 'Ellen', '1990', 'starin', 'g', 'gifted', 'ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'became', 'famous', 'historical', 'was', 'first', 'TV', 'show', 'where', 'central', 'character', 'came', 'out', 'decalred', 'homosexuality', 'screen', 'Ellen', 'became', 'importyant', 'part', 'television', 'histyory', 'paving', 'way', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Modern', 'Family', 'not', 'what', 'review', 'about.As', 'series', 'possible', 'esception', 'fasier', 'series', 'began', 'rocky', 'start', 'fact', 'tyhe', 'chacraters', 'writingh', 'eeally', 'didn', 'ty', 'fall', 'place', 'halfway', 'season', 'one', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'fast', 'jobv', 'network', 'mid-year5', 'pick', 'up', 'took', 'time', 'producers', 'writers', 'see', 'what', 'Ellen', 'capoable', 'doing', 'shifted', 'script', 'wored', 'word', 'allowing', 'camera', 'roll', 'Degeneres', 'would', 'improvise', 'one', 'now', 'famous', 'rambles', 'season', 'spectacular', 't4easer', 'Ellen', 'puyts', 'jug', 'water', 'cooler', 'kitchen', 'spilling', 'gallons', 'water', 'everywhere', 'when', 'was', 'done3', 'settlped', 'back', 'sai8d', 'done', 'scripts', 'began', 'edging', 'farce', 'where', 'none', 'hit', 'Feydeau', 'cast', 'stayed', 'character', 'Ellen', 'took', 'ordinary', 'situations', 'made', 'funny', 'hell', 'tyhe', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'clear', 'was', 'find', 'as', 'remarkable', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'andMary', 'Tyler', 'Moore.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fgine', 'here', 'where', 'most', 'were', 'replaced', 'se4cond', 'season', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'wise', 'choice', 'Maggie', 'Wheeler', 'was', 'better', 'Paige', 'character', 'Paige', 'was', 'same', 'token', 'd', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'here', 'then', 'Marta', 'Kaufman', 'David', 'Crane', 'would', 'never', 'hjave', 'put', 'Friends', 'remarkable', 'nev', 'er', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Janice', 'nice', 'see', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'real', 'voice', 'real', 'comedic', 'ckills', 'subtle', 'way', 'character', 'developed', 'beautifully', 'end', 'season', 'Audrey', 'introduced', 'season', 'married', 'negatyive', 'irritant', 'whom', 'Ellen', 'dislikes', 'then', 'reapperas', 'season', 'two', 'single', 'pink', 'encrusted', 'multyi-milliopnaire', 'grew', 'love', 'Ayre', 'GRossis', 'remarkable', 'day', 'one', 'indeed', 'one', 'sad', 'points', 'show', 'was', 'decisiopn', 'leave', 'Jeremy', 'Priven', 'made', 'damned', 'good', 'replacement', 'bringing', 'new', 'dynamic', 'Season', 'one', 'great', 'deal', 'Ellen', 'dating', 'indeed', 'one', 'suitor', 'toilet', 'ruining', 'cyance', 'ever', 'seeing', 'again', 'Ass', 'time', 'went', 'became', 'clkear', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'actress', 'tyired', 'being', 'closetetd', ""'d"", 'be', 'damned', 'character', 'would', 'also', 'things', 'have', 'start', 'season', 'one', 'Ellen', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'weak', 'season', 'five', 'good', 'start', 'brilliance', 'show', 'seasons', 'two', 'four', 'buty', 'one', 'five', 'work', 'nice', 'bookwends', 've', 'limited', 'money', 'skip', 'season', 'buy', 'others', 'truth', 'great', 'deal', 'above', 'average', 'comedy', 'writing', 'disc', 'made', 'sacrificesw', 'mankind', 'alone', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'laughs', 'are', 'simply', 'bonus']",N/A

THe first episode was not that great, and I guess I had to get into this humour of already 10 years ago, which seems already dated, but already after the second episode I feel in love with it. It's incredibly hilarious, and if what I read here it's true, it's even better later!Buy it, you won't regret it!I didn't!",5,Hilarious,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,472,"['had', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Ellen', 'not', 'English', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'mostly', 'dubbing', 'how', 'can', 'dub', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'THe', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'guess', 'had', 'get', 'humour', 'already', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'already', 'dated', 'already', 'second', 'episode', 'feel', 'love', 'incredibly', 'hilarious', 'what', 'read', 'here', 'true', 'even', 'better', 'later', 'Buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'did', ""n't""]",N/A

Immediately I fell in love with the show. It will have you laughing the whole time. The first couple season have different characters in them and at first I didn't like them, but once you give them a chance you will. Each season gets better.The first season has some great episodes in them. Like I said, they get better with each season. By the third season... you'll be laughing until your stomach hurts.I bought this used only because all of the seasons are really expensive!!! I will someday bite the bullet and buy them all. I love the show that much and it stopped playing on cable tv.With that said... I bought mine used from HASTINGS. The shipping was crazy fast and the box wasn't that tore up. When I looked to see if the cd's had scratches... they didn't, not one. When I went to play the dvd's, the picture was blurry in spots and where the straight lines were there were zig zags. I think that when HASTINGS cleaned it... it messed with the picture. I didn't pay too much for it but when you get something you want it to play good. :( I usually always order from HASTINGS but Idk about that anymore.",4,The 1st season is good...,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1259,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Ellen', 'never', 'miss', 'day', 'time', 'talk', 'show', 'never', 'new', 'had', 'sitcom', 'came', 'tv', 'one', 'day', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'Immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'whole', 'time', 'first', 'couple', 'season', 'have', 'different', 'characters', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'once', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'season', 'better.The', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'episodes', 'said', 'get', 'better', 'season', 'third', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'stomach', 'hurts.I', 'bought', 'used', 'only', 'seasons', 'are', 'really', 'expensive', 'will', 'someday', 'bite', 'bullet', 'buy', 'love', 'show', 'much', 'stopped', 'playing', 'cable', 'tv.With', 'said', 'bought', 'mine', 'used', 'HASTINGS', 'shipping', 'was', 'crazy', 'fast', 'box', 'was', ""n't"", 'tore', 'up', 'When', 'looked', 'see', 'cd', 'had', 'scratches', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'one', 'When', 'went', 'play', 'dvd', 'picture', 'was', 'blurry', 'spots', 'where', 'straight', 'lines', 'were', 'were', 'zig', 'zags', 'think', 'when', 'HASTINGS', 'cleaned', 'messed', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'get', 'something', 'want', 'play', 'good', 'usually', 'always', 'order', 'HASTINGS', 'Idk', 'anymore']",N/A
