984354,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F7CECK,A Customer,"[3, 4]","In The Libertine, director Laurence Dunmore brings to life the Restoration period, the court of King Charles 11 in all its glory. In this world, full of mud and rain and dirt and licentiousness, and where hedonism has never looked so miserable.Johnny Depp who plays John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester  - a voluble misanthrope for whom the pursuit of physical pleasure is de rigueur  - has certainly injected some bite into his character. Wilmot is a devilishly wicked man doesn't so much as engage in ribaldry as send it up even while partying through London's brothels with his goblet-swinging, wench-hunting collection of playwright friends.Set in 1675, The Libertine revolves around, Wilmot's affair with actress Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton) and with Charles II (John Malkovich). Best friends from childhood, Charles requests that John write him a play to help court the French ambassador, apparently the King is hurting for money, and neither Louis nor the British Parliament, under the current state of affairs will help him out.Meanwhile, Wilmot strikes up a friendship with Barry. She's a sixteenth century version of a B-grade actress; in fact she's so bad that in her first scene she's booed off the stage and bombarded with rotten vegetables.  But she's sassy, and is dedicated to her art, and is also uninterested in anything the earl has to offer. Naturally he falls in love after helping her find her true passion as an actress.This final passion proves both his deliverance and his ruin. It doesn't help that he dips his quill without regard to social propriety, and when puts on a pornographic play offending both the King and his consorts, he becomes frightened for his health and his safely. For most of the final part of the film Wilmot is spent - ravaged by the pox - and wasting away, much to the chagrin of his long-suffering wife and loyal wife (Rosamund Pike).The art direction is absolutely gorgeous and the film really makes you believe you are living in the grim and stodgy murkiness of 17th century London. But sometimes this faux-realism of handheld cameras, muddy streets, and dingy castle hallways gets in the way of the story and at times it's just too hard to figure out what is going on.Also, I would have liked for Dunmore open the settings up more so that the action isn't so self-contained and inwardly directed, consequently there are large parts of the film that film that feel leaden and monotonous. Depp does indeed give a bravura performance, he really manages to capture Wilmot's single-handed defiance of authority, but again, I couldn't help thinking it was one of those acting feats where he's crying out for Oscar.Mercurial and refreshing in her ability to cut through what is basically a Johnny Depp vehicle is the great Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry, the courageous actress-in-training who really craves the love of an audience more than the love of a man. She's a shrewd and calculating temptress who doesn't need the endorsement of a man and who's more than prepared to sell out Wilmot to the King if she can achieve her dream of gaining notoriety on the stage.With all its faults, The Libertine is still an entertaining movie. It's often ribald and irreverent and Dunmore has created a world where carnality is signified by acres of inflated and bursting at the seams bosoms and by dialogue that is mostly made of profanity and vulgarity.Yet with all its references to sex, The Libertine is a remarkably sexless enterprise, in fact it's funnier than anything else. When Wilmot and his colleagues' talk about their exploits, it really is mostly just talking, perhaps it's a definite sign that the Restoration period has seen better days.

984356,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000F7CECK,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[13, 15]","John Wilmot, the second Earl of Rochester, was born in Oxfordshire in April 1647 to a Parliamentarian and Puritan mother and an alcoholic Royalist with Irish blood, named Earl of Rochester 1652 while Charles II (played by John Malkovich) was still in exile. Wilmot inherited his father's military skill, as he became a hero for special prowess demonstrated in a navy battle against the Dutch.He was also something of a literary genius, whose poetry posthumously gained such admirers as Daniel Defoe, Alfred Lord Tennyson and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. William Hazlitt wrote that Rochester's ""verses cut and sparkle like diamonds,"" while ""'his contempt for everything that others respect almost amounts to sublimity."" Francois-Marie Arouet de Voltaire praised his satire.Unfortunately, this film tells nothing of Rochester's father, military accomplishment or literary genius.  Rather Johnny Depp plays Rochester as Samuel Johnson described him: ""in a course of drunken gaiety and gross sensuality,... an avowed contempt of decency and order, a total disregard to every moral, and a resolute denial of every religious observation....""Viewers meet his wife, Elizabeth Malet (aptly played by Rosamund Pike), whom he married in 1667, two years after attempting her abduction by coach and horsemen. We also see his terrible death of syphilis in 1680, as the film shows it, with a newfound faith in the church-and his wife, mother and a clergyman at his side.In between, Rochester carouses with what Andrew Marvell called his ""Merry Gang"" in tow. His real-life companions included Henry Jermyn, Charles Sackville (later Lord Buckhurst and Earl of Dorset), John Sheffield (Earl of Mulgrave), Henry Killigrew, Sir Charles Sedley, playwright George Etherege and George Villiers (Duke of Buckingham), some of whom are well-depicted here.He also bounces back and forth between the muddy country roads, where he for a time was banished for his lewdness, and drunken stupors in the muddy streets of London, when he was not wooing Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton), the famous Restoration actress, whom he tutored during her early career.If you like period pieces, this will be sure to titillate you, as will Depp's outstanding performance. The film is chock full of elaborate costumes, staging and realistic period scenery. But it's hardly the greatest film I've ever seen. And if you want something more uplifting, stick with Rosamund Pike's rendition of Jane in the latest film production of Austen's Pride and Prejudice.--Alyssa A.

984360,ABEHFS0L7J9NO,B000F7CECK,Angie,"[28, 32]","I'm a Johnny Depp fan. He did a great job at playing John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester. But, the movie wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I knew the subject matter going in. That wasn't the problem. To me, the movie wasn't dark enough. There wasn't any motivation as to why John Wilmot was so obsessed with sex and drinking to the point of self-destruction. Johnny Depp did a great job of letting us know something was rattling around in his head. But the dialogue and visual images weren't there to back it up and left a lot open for guessing.But, thanks to the magic of DVD, people can figure out that internal motivation by watching the deleted scenes and comments. I think the director should have left in the flashbacks from early in John Wilmot's life. The dark subject matter doesn't bother me or I wouldn't have been watching a movie like this. The decision to leave them out struck me as an interesting edit because one of the players in the special features segment of the DVD described how John Wilmot was a brilliant writer, and ahead of his time. If that is part of the reason they're making the movie, to showcase an artist that wasn't afraid to write the King of England a pornographic play, then why was the director was afraid of being honest to the character?I enjoyed this movie more after I watched the special features.

984363,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000F7CECK,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 8/07Rate: 68/07: Once again, Johnny Depp gives an unusual performance, but as often as possible, he does not achieve depth for his character. That's the biggest flaw Johnny Depp has, and that's what sets him apart from Brandos, De Niros, and Hoffmans. Looking at the film as whole, The Libertine has its own merits but remains two levels below Amadeus. In fact, I find The Libertine too similar to Amadeus, so similar that I have to file the picture in ""I've seen it already"" category. Yet the writing, if not too vulgar and too witty, and the cinematography (much of it and I didn't mind the bleeding green view) are adroitly done. For the dialogue, I could have been fooled into thinking that the writer (Stephen Jeffreys) read a Scrabble dictionary and plucked fancy words out of it. Still, I can give The Libertine a second viewing for reevaluation and see how it stands against time. While Johnny Depp is the tour-de-force of the cast, everybody else was never on equal footing with him as they lagged behind in terms of naturalness, fluidity, and characterization. John Malkovich seems to be out of his touch since I could remember him doing much supreme job when he performed as Valmont in Dangerous Liaisons. Perhaps he was never a great actor to start with. I do love the introduction, and I love the way how The Libertine ended especially when Johnny Depp slowly fades out and saying at the same time, ""Do you like me now? Do you...like me now?"" When he introduced himself at the outset of the picture, Johnny Depp warned the audience that they might not like him. Well, to be frank with you, it's too hard to dislike him. That's probably why the film didn't ultimately work. If it was Tom Roth, that could have been perfect for The Libertine. As a matter of fact, there is a serious possibility that Johnny Depp studied Tim Roth's performance of Rob Roy and made a pastiche out of his work for Wilmot's character. Sadly, it didn't work very well. Another ""probably"" is Johnny Depp may have studied Laurence Olivier's performance from Richard III. Regardless, I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and I applaud his impressive repertoire of films as odd as they are. But he has to strive much harder for deeper characterization. Until that performance brings out the depth in him, Johnny Depp will always be stuck beneath a glass ceiling. The Libertine is a great, great example of why his performance was just full of hollowness yet attractive. Thinking back what was so impressive about The Libertine, it was the point of transformation that John Wilmot went from being a ruthless earl to hapless lecherous drunk. It was that point where Johnny Depp got the better of himself. He was more improved and more dramatic than the first half of the picture, but he showed reminiscence of what Daniel Day-Lewis did as Christy Brown in My Left Foot. I could have sworn that I saw an image, for a good minute, of Johnny that's just too eerily similar to Day-Lewis' Christy Brown. Oddly, The Libertine speaks of sex, pornography, Dionysian feast, and ogre of men and women committing heinous acts, but the movie shows nearly none of it (they were superbly blurry and murky). I mean, what the heck? Did Eyes Wide Shut do that better already? Oh! Oh! What about The Wicker Man? I haven't seen Caligula yet, but I can imagine it being in the upper echelons of that graphic display. What I think should have been ameliorated about The Libertine...well, much of the picture was fine...but it needs more out of Johnny in terms of depth while the relationship between John Wilmot and Lizzie Barry desires more structuring and ramifications. The meaner Johnny is, the better. At the same time, fewer similarities to Amadeus would be appreciated.

Not liking it doesn't mean I wasn't impressed, and it was interesting to be given some insight into the miserable life of John Wilmot, whose writings and other doings had not attracted me greatly in the past. A person somewhat resembling the divine Marquis de Sade, the pair of them strike me as self-haters and life-haters. Although I see their point, there's no percentage to it: since we're here, we might as well make the best of it and try to be pleasant to each other, as well as ourselves. Life's a jest and all things show it, so let's have a laugh now and then. What this film demonstrated is that there was precious little humour or good-nature in the debauched and dissolute life-style surrounding Charles II: it was basically depressing and vacuous. Was that what Rochester was protesting against? Or was he merely lashing back at his prim and proper mum? The Cavaliers had been wrong, but wromantic; and the Puritans had been right, but repulsive. The Restoration, however, is shown here as both unromantic, because it totally lacked any sense of honour, and also poxily repulsive. Yes, the film was creatively shot, rather well-acted, and the script makes you think. The Director's commentary well communicates the thought behind the product. I can't give it less than 4 stars, but I still didn't like it.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 7]","Watching this sumptuously filmed movie, one gets the sense that more time went into cinematography, lighting, and camera angles than the story itself. Watching the DVD's extra features confirms some of those suspicions, as the film took over seven years to make (due to financial woes and other problems).If you've read English literature and history, you are no doubt familiar with the drinking and debauched behavior of Sir John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester. His raunchy writings and lifestyle planted him in an early grave but posthumously spun a web of literary notoriety. Some considered him a man ""ahead of his time."" Others thought him a shallow defiler of women who simply had a gift with his quill (both quills ...ahem!) Whatever your historical take on the man, he certainly was ""interesting."" But that's where trying to make a film out of such a life fails. ""Interesting"" is not enough ...even when accompanied by great camera work.Johnny Depp plays John Wilmot and does so in his usual deft manner. He's creepy, delivers lines like a razor, and immerses us in this unsettled man's life. But the story is only entertaining thanks to Depp's portrayal. The rest of the film is bland and slow, accompanied by a love story that makes no sense.For some (as mentioned previously), the excellent lighting, dizzying camera pans of the theater, and dark sets will make this film pure eye-candy. And it is. But there needs to be more than just good filming; there needs to be a story we can grasp that is believable and filled with angst.

Johnny Depp gives an incredible performance as Rochester as do Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry and John Malkovich as Charles II.The story of the John Wilmot,Second Earl of Rochester ,is not the story of a likable character. Wilmot was a man of great talent who persisted in throwing it all away. His drunken binges are perhaps more well known than the body of literary work he produced before dying at the age of thirty-three. The film takes multiple viewings to follow its plot structure for those not familiar with the historical characters. Based on Stephen Jeffrey's play the film comes off as more theatrical than realistic.There is much to like about the film but also much to dislike. The production design  by Ben Van Os and costume design by Dien Van Straalen evoke the Restoration period quite well. The cinematography by Alexander Melman is unique in that it is mostly handheld and is lit with natural and candlelight rather than more modern source lighting.The story is more suited to those who know something of the period and its characters. Wilmot was not a very likable character but was one that was fascinating all the same.

In our world of PC and positive, happy-happy fakery it is actually refreshing to see someone go all-out in destructive living.  Though we may not envy his way of life, we all have a bit of John Wilmot in us that would like to come out far more than we let it.  At least for me.Depp is brilliant, as usual.  His Depp-ness is lost in the character, and from the gripping opening monologue you will be hooked.  Samantha Morton is an added highlight to this mature film.

984376,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,B000F7CECK,Carlos Rodriguez,"[6, 6]","The Libertine, is not your average movie, it is a special kind of film from the genre that it represents. I had wanted to see this movie for a long time after several failed attempts from the studio that distributed it is finally here and all I can say is that I'am glad that I finally got to see it. This movie is brilliant in every way I thought. The film's dark tones is perfect for the period which is the 17th century if I'am not mistaking. The costumes that the actors wear in the movie are great and of the time. The writing and directing of the film is exquisite. However the main reason why anyone would want to go see ""The Libertine"" is because of the brilliant acting. Everyone in the cast did a very good job the supporting actors were all believable in their roles and John Malkovich as always did a splending job this time in the role of King Charles II, Now, the real reason to see this movie is because of one actor and one actor only, JOHNNY DEPP. He is beyond spectacular and his performance is above all surreal and extraordinary. As a huge Depp fan that I'am I've always loved Johnny's movies because he is an actor of innate talent and wisdom. He has done some great work in the past (Blow, Donnie Brasco, The Ninth Gate, Before Night Falls and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory to name a few.)The Libertine is thus far his greatest performance capture on film I believe and the transformation that his character John Wilmot,(The Earl of Rochester) undergoes towards the end of the movie is beyond belief. The make-up that they used on his face is incredible and completely believeable. The Oscar should of been given to Johnny for his masterful performance. I cannot conceive that he wasn't even nomiminated in the Best Actor category at this year's ceremony. If Johnny Depp ever deserved an Academy Award for his acting is definately in this film. I saw Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote and he gave a superb performance and he was indeed Truman Capote and although I was happy that he won the Oscar for Best Actor for a role which was complicated enough, I believe that Johnny was cheated out of the Best Actor category because after seeing him in ""The Libetine"" his performance although entirely different from Hoffman's naturally (two different roles altogether) should of won because the Earl of Rochester was far more complicated and misunderstood than Truman Capote ever was. Now, that being said forget that Johnny didn't win (his Oscar will eventually come to him) go and see the movie. You will really enjoy it I think and if you don't well I won't criticize you because everyone has their own opinion and are allowed not to like a movie if they choose to go that route. If you like Johnny Depp as an actor you will love him in ""The Libertine"" and if you don't like him, well... if you go see this film his performance will probably change your mind. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD as I will be purchasing a copy of this fantastic and startling movie. Five stars is not enough, I would give it ten if there were ten to give. The Libertine will blow your mind from beginning to end and we have the acting brilliance of an actor like Johnny Depp to thank for that.

984378,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000F7CECK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","This film captures the atmosphere of 17th Century London during the Restoration of Charles II. Filmed in mist and candle light and fog, the film transports you to the 1680s.  John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, played wonderfully by Johnny Depp, is the subject of a dark play driven by the Nihilism and atheism of the poet and playwright.  Wilmot demonstrates his skills in a wild orgy satire equating the sexual appetite of Charles II with political power. We are also treated to his sarcastic and sadistic iconoclastic personality that provides the entertainment in this bleak world-view of a highly self-destructive and talented man. With his exceptional intelligence, wit, and verbal skills, Wilmot can cut through any joy or inspiration to find the base and futile.John Wilmot, as a young man, abducts a beautiful and rich 18 year old heiress as his wife. He is pardoned and their life together becomes one of extreme frustration for his wife. Nothing she can do will impact his actions and nothing she can say will penetrate his thoughts. This part of the film is very good and his elegant and caring wife is in many ways the moral compass or anchor for the film by which we can see the pain Wilmot brings to him and to others. His Nihilism is insightfully self centered and egotistical, which may be a subtle commentary on those who adopt this philosophy of existence and social order (or lack thereof). To some degree Wilmot acts as a spoiled child trying to find the limits of his own behavior. He writes an outlandish and obscene play for the court of Charles II and whereas Charles II could have inflicted great punishment on Wilmot, he doesn't and notes that he is condemning Wilmot to be Wilmot.Wilmot has around him artists of a wild streak who are his fair weather and back-stabbing literary companions.  Into this group comes a handsome young 18 year old man who is drawn to this dark group and especially to John Wilmot. Gradually during the film you see that Wilmot is bi-sexual and this young man becomes a boy-toy who pays a tragic price for being a handsome moth circling a heartless flame.However it is Wilmot's relationship to a young ambitious actress that provides wonderful dialogue around the theme of artifice and reality as Wilmot becomes her acting coach. Samantha Morton plays actress Lizzy Barry, who becomes a great actress through her emotional encounters with John Wilmot. It is Wilmot's gift to cut to the quick whenever he sees vulnerability or false illusions, a skill that an acting coach could put to great use. He cuts through Lizzy's self protective veneer which she uses when acting to spear her pain and vulnerability. It is to her credit that she allows the veil to fall and for her vulnerability to emerge, and yet to have the strength of the artist to use this insight to apply to her art. As he gradually disintegrates and self destructs, she emerges triumphant through her self-control and burning ambition to succeed. He has chosen to mock success and she has chosen to embrace it. He sees worldly success as a joke at best and an illusion. She sees his cynicism as fruitless and self-defeating.The film is full of beautifully designed scenes such as the Earl and Countess having a portrait painted in her palatial home and the mad-house atmosphere of the London theater crowd.Wilmot's wild life catches up with him as the symptoms of syphilis begin to destroy his features and his nose begins to rot off. He loses control of his legs and must walk on crutches. In this sorry state he enters the house of Parliament and argues for the right for Charles II to name his brother, James, as the future king. Yet history tells us that James II was a disastrous king, forced to abdicate to his son-in-law and daughter, William and Mary. Maybe this support for the king in the eleventh hour was a last effort to instill chaos and create a legacy of confusion, something that Wilmot would have greatly enjoyed.",4,A dark and self-serving view of self and the world,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,3952,"['film', 'atmosphere', '17th', 'Century', 'London', 'Restoration', 'Charles', 'II', 'Filmed', 'mist', 'candle', 'light', 'fog', 'film', '1680s', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'subject', 'dark', 'play', 'driven', 'Nihilism', 'atheism', 'poet', 'playwright', 'Wilmot', 'skills', 'wild', 'orgy', 'satire', 'equating', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'Charles', 'II', 'political', 'power', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'sarcastic', 'sadistic', 'iconoclastic', 'personality', 'entertainment', 'bleak', 'world-view', 'highly', 'self-destructive', 'talented', 'man', 'exceptional', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'verbal', 'skills', 'Wilmot', 'can', 'cut', 'joy', 'inspiration', 'find', 'base', 'futile.John', 'Wilmot', 'young', 'man', 'beautiful', 'rich', '18', 'year', 'old', 'heiress', 'wife', 'pardoned', 'life', 'together', 'one', 'extreme', 'frustration', 'wife', 'Nothing', 'can', 'do', 'will', 'impact', 'actions', 'nothing', 'can', 'say', 'will', 'penetrate', 'thoughts', 'part', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'elegant', 'caring', 'wife', 'many', 'ways', 'moral', 'compass', 'anchor', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'pain', 'Wilmot', 'others', 'Nihilism', 'insightfully', 'self', 'centered', 'egotistical', 'may', 'be', 'subtle', 'commentary', 'who', 'adopt', 'philosophy', 'existence', 'social', 'order', 'lack', 'thereof', 'degree', 'Wilmot', 'spoiled', 'child', 'trying', 'find', 'limits', 'own', 'behavior', 'outlandish', 'obscene', 'play', 'court', 'Charles', 'II', 'whereas', 'Charles', 'II', 'could', 'have', 'inflicted', 'great', 'punishment', 'Wilmot', ""n't"", 'notes', 'condemning', 'Wilmot', 'be', 'Wilmot.Wilmot', 'around', 'artists', 'wild', 'streak', 'who', 'are', 'fair', 'weather', 'back-stabbing', 'literary', 'companions', 'Into', 'group', 'handsome', 'young', '18', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'drawn', 'dark', 'group', 'especially', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Gradually', 'film', 'see', 'Wilmot', 'bi-sexual', 'young', 'man', 'boy-toy', 'who', 'tragic', 'price', 'being', 'handsome', 'moth', 'circling', 'heartless', 'flame.However', 'Wilmot', 'relationship', 'young', 'ambitious', 'actress', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'theme', 'artifice', 'reality', 'Wilmot', 'acting', 'coach', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'actress', 'Lizzy', 'Barry', 'who', 'great', 'actress', 'emotional', 'encounters', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Wilmot', 'gift', 'cut', 'quick', 'whenever', 'vulnerability', 'false', 'illusions', 'skill', 'acting', 'coach', 'could', 'put', 'great', 'use', 'Lizzy', 'protective', 'veneer', 'when', 'acting', 'spear', 'pain', 'vulnerability', 'credit', 'veil', 'fall', 'vulnerability', 'emerge', 'yet', 'have', 'strength', 'artist', 'use', 'insight', 'apply', 'art', 'gradually', 'destructs', 'triumphant', 'self-control', 'burning', 'ambition', 'succeed', 'chosen', 'mock', 'success', 'chosen', 'embrace', 'worldly', 'success', 'joke', 'best', 'illusion', 'cynicism', 'fruitless', 'self-defeating.The', 'film', 'full', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'scenes', 'such', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'having', 'portrait', 'painted', 'palatial', 'home', 'mad-house', 'atmosphere', 'London', 'theater', 'crowd.Wilmot', 'wild', 'life', 'up', 'symptoms', 'syphilis', 'begin', 'destroy', 'features', 'nose', 'begins', 'rot', 'off', 'control', 'legs', 'must', 'walk', 'crutches', 'sorry', 'state', 'house', 'Parliament', 'argues', 'right', 'Charles', 'II', 'name', 'brother', 'James', 'future', 'king', 'history', 'tells', 'James', 'II', 'was', 'disastrous', 'king', 'forced', 'abdicate', 'son-in-law', 'daughter', 'William', 'Mary', 'Maybe', 'support', 'king', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'was', 'last', 'effort', 'instill', 'chaos', 'create', 'legacy', 'confusion', 'something', 'Wilmot', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'enjoyed']",N/A
984379,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000F7CECK,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 9]","John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester (Johnny Depp), begins ""The Libertine"" by saying to the audience, ""Allow me to be frank at the commencement: you will NOT like me."" He goes on to say that he doesn't want to be liked. True enough; his debauchery and shamelessness would leave a lot to be desired if one were actually in his presence. But when viewed from a distance (a.k.a. the audience's perspective) his bold, uncompromising attitude is an incredibly fascinating sight to behold. Rarely do we encounter anyone who's willing to be so unapologetically blunt with his or her thoughts and feelings. While most would rather not be exposed to such straightforwardness, you have to admit that it's somewhat refreshing to have someone tell it like it is, even if it's unpleasant.I'm sure that Rochester got his wish by the end of the movie; I certainly did not end up liking him. But to a degree, I did admire him. He lived his life exactly how he wanted to live it, and never mind the consequences. Even when his freewheeling sexual appetite costs him his health (he was practically eaten alive by Syphilis) as he goes on a self-destructive binge of women and alcohol, I still got the feeling that he knew exactly what he was doing. He talked about nothing other than sexual desire, and there never seemed to be a moment when he wasn't sipping wine from a metal goblet. He's definitely not a sympathetic character, and if the first few lines of the film are to be taken at face value, then that's the last thing he wanted himself to be.This historical drama set in late 1600s England (based on the play by Stephen Jeffreys) shows Rochester as a scandalous, radically liberal poet and playwright. His work is absolutely loaded with insights and opinions on sex and pleasure, every line laced with risqu' words and descriptions. King Charles II (John Malkovich) needs Rochester to produce a new play; Charles is down on his cash and feels that presenting an artfully written piece will win him favor with the French and British governments. The only problem is that Rochester has his own ideas about artfully written pieces (only someone like him could think up a poem while receiving oral sex), and if there's one thing he won't do, it's conform to someone else's set of rules. What other kind of person would hang around with unsavory groups of people like prostitutes and schemers?He ultimately writes a play that includes graphic representations of intercourse, and he goes so far as to involve the audience by distributing fake penises. (It was one of those scenes that had me continually saying to myself, ""Oh my God""; you couldn't get away with that today, let alone in the late 1600s.) A French nobleman who attends this performance turns to Charles and says with a humorous air, ""That's very amusing, because in France he would be executed for this."" Charles, of course, isn't anywhere close to amused, nor should he be. However, I couldn't help but wonder what he expected out of Rochester. Charles had banished him for the exact same offense only three months earlier. Isn't this an obvious indication that he's unwilling to change?The other side of the story involves Rochester's love affair with Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton), an actress who ignites his fascination. He first sees her as she gives a performance (which was cut short when the audience booed her off stage while throwing fruit). Immediately we assume that his thoughts are merely lustful, but that ends up being only partially true. He seems genuinely taken by her personality, which isn't that far removed from his own; she's certainly not boozy or sexually unrepressed, but she is willing to speak her mind, even to her professional superiors.He resolves to make her the greatest and most envied actress London has ever seen. He pushes her hard during rehearsals, making her repeat the same lines until she gets them just right (which, apparently, took twenty or more tries). I found their interactions during those scenes to be very cleverly structured, each line bringing subtle yet meaningful ideas to the surface where the audience can take them in. It then becomes an interesting method of interpretation, getting you to try and figure out what exactly the two are saying to each other. There is deeper attraction brewing, a fact that makes character judgments all but impossible.This is especially true of Rochester's wife (Francesca Annis). She's well aware of her husband's unpopular ideals and unabashed infidelity, and she certainly doesn't approve of how he lives his life. But she does still care for him, and she shows her compassion the most towards the end of the film as he grows weaker and weaker from disease and alcoholism. I suppose part of that has to do with the seduction that brought her to him in the first place; an early scene in which they travel by coach shows her recalling how he was able to win her over (during which he manually stimulates her).This is but one level of character complexity that pleasantly surprised me about ""The Libertine"" (truth be told, a lot of things about this movie surprised me, including Johnny Depp's brilliantly dark performance). While its heavy-handed material may turn some viewers off (so to speak), it still is a thought provoking and oddly witty portrayal of human behavior. Notions of sex were frowned upon during that period of history, and exposing the fact that humans are sexual beings would be an ostracizing and humiliating ordeal. Even though John Wilmot was depraved and lacking in good judgment, he was still willing to challenge such censorship. You can't help but admire someone like that, even if they don't want to be admired. Likewise, you can't help but enjoy this film, even if certain people don't want you to enjoy it.",4,Sexual Reeling,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,5782,"['John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'Johnny',

984380,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000F7CECK,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 11]","This film, like so many others, takes the stance that sex is a great thing to sell a film with, but other than that it is totally evil. The film finds Johnny Depp playing the Earl of Rochester, a playwright in 17th Century London. After writing a play that greatly affects the king, he is driven into exile. From there he comes down with an especially nasty STD and suffers greatly. The end. The film makes the point that while real life is arbitrary, art makes sense. From there director Laurence Dunmore tries to live up to that idea. There is no doubt that the Weinsteins thought that the sight of Johnny Depp sleeping his way through Restoration England would sell tons of tickets. They even dressed him up as a flamboyant earl, because we all know that that flamboyant pirate worked wonders. The question I have is why does his debauchery have to lead directly to death? The last half hour of the film was by far the most boring, so why even include it? Well because art makes sense, of course. And if you are going to spend a movie playing with Samantha Morton's heaving bosoms then you have to pay the piper, it simply makes sense. If art always made this much sense then the last episode of ""Sex and the City"" would have had all four of our female friends dying from AIDS. And I certainly hoped none of us felt even an ounce of smugness from seeing ourselves as so much more cosmopolitan than this society considering that we had our own sexual witch hunt not ten years ago.The film itself is decent. I'm sure that Depp was trying very hard for his third straight Oscar nomination, but the Academy wasn't biting. His acting is fine, and everybody else is just kind of there. Most of the characters personalities are undetectable, and the script is filled with speechifying and prehistoric politics. Not one scene stood out to me as crucial, or even somewhat important. I know that the film was trying to be a different kind of costume drama, but it really wasn't different at all. Sure, there was some sex peppered in, and a few scenes were successfully shot with a handheld camera. But stuffiness still ruled. And it looks as though more attention was paid to the sets and costumes than to the writing and directing. I did enjoy the visit to the theatre world of that time and place. It didn't give you a sense of history, but it gave you a real sense of atmosphere. The audience was made up of hoodlums and hooligans, and the theatres themselves were the exact opposite of lavish.To me the most amusing thing about this film was imagining those girls who went to see their heartthrob, Johnny Depp, walking out of the theater. The joke here is really on them because by that point they may never want to look at him again. And just like in ""Alfie"" (a far superior film) our hero goes from stud muffin to chump as he gets to get dissed for his looks. Of course that is not how it really goes. Hugh Hefner and the Rolling Stones still get all the young girls they want, so ""The Libertine"" is really just peddling a female fantasy. Since they can't have Johnny Depp, they want nobody to have him. The problem with that is to believe the moral of this story you'd also have to believe in Bush's abstinence only education. As the film points out it is very easy to oppose something, it's just too bad that they decided to waste their time opposing sex. **3/4",3,Those Who Have Sex Are Doomed To Pay For It,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,3362,"['film', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'stance', 'sex', 'great', 'thing', 'sell', 'film', 'other', 'totally', 'evil', 'film', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'playing', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'playwright', '17th', 'Century', 'London', 'writing', 'play', 'greatly', 'king', 'driven', 'exile', 'down', 'especially', 'nasty', 'STD', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'end', 'film', 'point', 'real', 'life', 'arbitrary', 'art', 'sense', 'director', 'Laurence', 'Dunmore', 'tries', 'live', 'up', 'idea', 'doubt', 'Weinsteins', 'thought', 'sight', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'sleeping', 'way', 'Restoration', 'England', 'would', 'sell', 'tons', 'tickets', 'even', 'dressed', 'up', 'flamboyant', 'earl', 'know', 'flamboyant', 'pirate', 'worked', 'wonders', 'question', 'have', 'why', 'debauchery', 'have', 'lead', 'directly', 'death', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'boring', 'so', 'why', 'even', 'include', 'Well', 'art', 'sense', 'course', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'movie', 'playing', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'heaving', 'bosoms', 'then', 'have', 'pay', 'piper', 'simply', 'sense', 'art', 'always', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'then', 'last', 'episode', 'Sex', 'City', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'four', 'female', 'friends', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'certainly', 'hoped', 'none', 'felt', 'even', 'ounce', 'smugness', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'cosmopolitan', 'society', 'considering', 'had', 'own', 'sexual', 'witch', 'hunt', 'not', 'ten', 'years', 'ago.The', 'film', 'decent', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Depp', 'was', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'third', 'straight', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'was', ""n't"", 'biting', 'acting', 'fine', 'everybody', 'else', 'just', 'kind', 'there', 'Most', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'undetectable', 'script', 'filled', 'speechifying', 'prehistoric', 'politics', 'Not', 'one', 'scene', 'stood', 'out', 'crucial', 'even', 'somewhat', 'important', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'different', 'kind', 'costume', 'drama', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'different', 'Sure', 'was', 'sex', 'peppered', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'successfully', 'shot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'stuffiness', 'still', 'ruled', 'more', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'sets', 'costumes', 'writing', 'directing', 'did', 'enjoy', 'visit', 'theatre', 'world', 'time', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'sense', 'history', 'gave', 'real', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'audience', 'was', 'made', 'hoodlums', 'hooligans', 'theatres', 'were', 'exact', 'opposite', 'lavish.To', 'most', 'amusing', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'imagining', 'girls', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'heartthrob', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'walking', 'theater', 'joke', 'here', 'really', 'point', 'may', 'never', 'want', 'look', 'again', 'just', 'Alfie', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'hero', 'stud', 'muffin', 'chump', 'get', 'dissed', 'looks', 'course', 'not', 'how', 'really', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'still', 'get', 'young', 'girls', 'want', 'Libertine', 'really', 'just', 'peddling', 'female', 'fantasy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'want', 'nobody', 'have', 'problem', 'believe', 'moral', 'story', ""'d"", 'also', 'have', 'believe', 'Bush', 'abstinence', 'only', 'education', 'film', 'points', 'very', 'easy', 'oppose', 'something', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'decided', 'waste', 'time', 'opposing', 'sex', '**3/4']",N/A

After King Charles II lifts the banishment from London on Wilmot, he hopes the poet will return to the stage with a masterpiece. Wilmot simply wreaks havoc and continues to be his own worst enemy. Depp is splendid, and though Wilmot's character is despicable, we can't stop watching. When the witty Wilmot gets turned on his head by a strong willed actress struggling to tap into her talent on the stage, the wall around the poet's heart begins to wilt. Elizabeth Barry helps mine Wilmot's depth of emotion, but in the end he cannot possess his muse and he's losing his life.

984382,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,B000F7CECK,"Christina ""Lisa""","[5, 5]","There is a lot to relish in this movie, even in its darkness and imperfection.  It doesn't romanticize the opulence of the wealthy few, but it accentuates the change in social tide as England started to grow into its opulent thoughts on the rights of people. It reflects a time when cavaliers and roundheads had lost and passed into history, leaving behind new problems with which these characters need to deal.  What Charles II ordains as progress and legacy are only a fancy sun dial and immature tropical fruit to us.  A chill ran up my spine when the female stage manager has to coach a young female actor about bowing to an audience that might just go back and make it illegal for women to act on stage. Taking the arts out from the control of the church and from the patronage of royalty and bringing it out to the province of everybody else is no baby pineapple. No matter how decadent, regular people are trying to immortalize their time through writing and presenting it to larger audiences.The cast is interesting.  None of the women are forced to play stereotypes of the time.  The actors created characters that didn't sound like their actorly selves.  Malkovich didn't sound or act like himself. To me, he was Charles II. Depp has turned me into a fan with his versatility, modulating to this drunken libertine with more subtlety than the pirate role.  He gets it! Samantha Morton and Rosamund Pike are fiercely quiet but strong. Maybe the men are a little less interesting because they fulfill the stereotype of drinking, buying sex, talking about writing and not seeming to do much else.  The production is still first rate.That said, my problem is that the story is missing some things, like the transitions.  Is it the writer or an overactive editor?  How does love grow in this story? There is some sense of the passage of time, but not enough. It is like there is only so much money in the movie production for showing the archs.  Either the writer didn't write it or the editor snipped it.The Libertine is still worth seeing because it provokes a lot of thought about life, death, history, change.  I watched it after watching Domino with Keira Knightly.  These two movies are very baroque in their own ways, exploring the same sexualty and cosmic questions.  The Libertine is not so violent, but the cynicism and sex are as pathological. You might want to have a look at Stage Beauty with Claire Danes and Billy Crudup that has a similar story to Libertine but a different angle.  It also has some problems, but who doesn't?  Most movies have something worth seeing if they respect their audience.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[4, 5]","I had never heard of John Wilmot, the Second Earl of Rochester, until I stumbled upon this little period piece of celluloid.  Johnny Depp (and I can think of no other actor more gifted to play the role) brings the lecherous Earl to scandalous life in the brooding, dark film, THE LIBERTINE.The good Earl appears in a shadowy monologue to begin the story, warning that you as the viewer will not like him.  And he's quite right--Wilmot's qualities, if they can be called qualities, are his numerous vices.  From boozing to womanizing to down-in-the-gutter debauchery, the Earl wistfully wastes his brief life, leaving both the audience and himself to ponder what could have been, had the Earl's considerable talents been applied constructively.Depp (as always) steals every scene in which he appears, yet the surrounding cast is very good.  John Malkovich plays shallow King Charles II; the monarch, for very shaky reasons, believes the Earl will write a literary masterpiece as a tribute to his reign (when the very opposite takes place).  And Samantha Morton is a most convincing Lizzie Barry, a stage actress who becomes a lust interest for Wilmot.  All the cast plays off one another quite well, yet the pending gloom and doom hang over the Earl's story like a coffin's shroud.THE LIBERTINE is dark, unhappy, dirty, and uncomfortable; the outdoor scenes, where the muck and mud bury people to their ankles, are no accident.  As an interesting aside (and somewhat of a spoiler), I was astonished at Depp's appearance as his character continues to succumb to squalor and disease.  He began to look like (and I'm serious) a thin Kevin Bacon.  And I don't like that, either.--D.

984390,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000F7CECK,Doug Anderson,"[15, 17]","Rochester, who died at the age of 33, spent his early years pursuing pleasure and circulating (though not publishing) satiric verse and his latter years suffering the consequences of these pursuits. When the film begins Rochester is already suffering the effects of a syphillis that is rapidly devouring his body and will eventually devour his face. The opening and closing monologues (that cleverly mimic the stage conventions of the day) are delivered not to a Restoration audience but to us. Despite his brilliant beginning as a satirist of the first rank in a moment in time when satiric verse was the mode of choice for cultivated libertines and wits, as the film opens, Rochester, who is apparently speaking from the grave of the dark, dank and putridly-hued London of the 1670's, is not interested in offereing us his verse but his very soul and this film, like its main character, dares you to turn away.For the libertines the London social world of the 1670's was an endless round of drinking, theatre going, debauchery and riot. Some libertines like Rochester were nobles who served the King in whatever capacity the King chose (Rochester served in the navy, as well as waited on the King); in this the court, however, the King himself was, privately, a libertine as well and so it was very difficult for him to discipline those around him. Rochester, with his lightening quick and profane wit, was this dissolute world's biggest celebrity. What Rochester did in real life became the stuff of Restoration theatre. His friends included the dramatists William Wycherley and George Etherege whose most famous character, Dorimant, was based upon his manners, habits, and appetites. He was also friends with his employer the King who regularly banished him for his misdeeds (though usually not for long).A look at Rochester's poems will show that he was seemingly interested in only two things: drinking and swiving. But this is somewhat deceptive. Rochester seemed to pride himself on the insatiability of his appetite for both but he was also very interested in writing from a variety of perspectives(sometimes adopting a female persona) and though on the surface his verse seems like just a bunch of bawdy limericks, it actually offers a penetrating glimpse into the workings of a fascinating mind that is complex and conflicted about his own and other's social, sexual and spiritual identities. The film really only scratches the surface  and gives you that part of Rochester that lends itself to film, that is to dramatization/visualization. In some respects, however, the vulgar exploitative nature of  cinema in many ways seems like the perfect vehicle with which to tell this story which is about salacious scandal, the art of maintaining and/or destroying reputations (which are usually just facades anyway), and the public's fascination with the private lives (the more corrupt the better) of public figures.  Rochester fascinates because he seems to see through the vice and folly of power and though he is never quite above it, he seems capable of distancing himself from it (at times he would disappear from court and spend weeks writing in the country). He seems to be aroused by the juxtaposition of high society's penchant for glamourous excess/decadence and the equally potent and seductive allure of the lewd and brutal underworld. His own poetry seems to speak simultaneously from the upper and lower echelons of London (and his favorite location in which to set his poetry was St. James Park, a notorious site of carnivalesque intrigue and sexual liberty). Depp, with that eternally boyish glint in his eye, who charms with every grin, seems like someone who probably knows more about the former world, but he is someone that we believe may be sympathetic and therefore receptive (at least imaginatively) to the seductive force of the latter world.Malkovich also offers a convincing portrait of a troubled King who wants to be perceived as a leader but who cannot seem to ween himself from his own appetite for young girls. The public knows the King is weak and they suspect him of secretly being a Catholic. What the King really wants from his friend Rochester is a piece of theatrical propaganda that will transform his reputation if not his actual person. But Rochester is not one to blush in the face of facts and his talent is to tell things like they are so he not only refuses to lie but he will tell the truth in as theatrical and bawdy a fashion as possible. And instead of offering the public a respectable version of their ""protestant"" King, Rochester offers them a portrait of a lascivious fool and his equally lascivious court of hangers on. His play, Sodom (which involves onstage nudity and live lewd acts), does not amuse the King. It does amuse the visiting French ambassador however!What we get in the film is Rochester's lifestyle most of all--the drinking, whoring, and cavorting. We also get glimpses of the inner life--the ennui, the despair, the boredom of one who is trapped in a society (and humanity as he perceives it) that he, sometimes, views as insipid and ridiculous.  But what makes the film watchable is that we also get Rochester's humor and feel for common humanity: the scene where Rochester is having his portrait painted (replete with monkey companion) is splendid comedy and his friendship with his servant, Allcock, seems genuine. There are just enough moments of light humor that we find that we do like him after all and even might feel like we kind of understand him as well. As Rochester well knew those surrounding the court and occupying high social positions often feign superiority and comfort themselves with decorous public masks while living debauched lives, but, to his credit Rochester is who he is in private and in public. It is not quite clear why his very Christian wife loves him, however, and that is one weakness of the film. His wife was the wealthier of the two and Rochester's idea of courtship was to kidnap her. This caused a scandal and did not immediately result in their marriage (they would marry two years later)but they both liked to relive that intitial encounter when they rode in their carriage between London and their country estate. Ultimately we know very little of her, and his children, who he apparently was very affectionate with, are entirely absent from the film. Instead the film focuses on his many mistresses, one of which was the stage actress Elizabeth Barry.Rochester's interest in the theatre was genuine (he loved disguises his whole life; Dr. Bendo being his most elaborate) and even though he could not apparently write a succesful drama his service to the King required him to play many roles (including flatterer, sycophant, cynic, satirist). He also trained an actress who would eventually become one of his mistresses. Apparently he took on the task of training a talentless actress on a bet. Just what the training of this actress might mean in the larger scheme of things is not exactly clear. Perhaps his empathy with women was genuine (even though much of his verse seems to be misogynistic) and he wished to do at least one productive thing in his otherwise destructive life. He seems to have been drawn to the actress Elizabeth Barry's youth perhaps because he had none left of his own.  The stage was a place of transformation and perhaps the attraction to both stage and Elizabeth Barry was an attraction to the possibility that he could somehow transform and/or reform himself. Actresses at this time were considered to be little more than prostitutes and often Rochester considered authors to be little more than prostitutes as well and so perhaps the mutual attraction was also a mutual understanding and identification (at least on Rochester's part).In the end, according to the film, Rochester repented of his sins and made his peace with God as well as with his King and country. But no one really knows what Rochester's last thoughts were. The accounts of the death bed conversion were circulated by the priest and Rochester's very devout wife (ironically she converted to Catholicism at Rochester's request soon after they wed) who also took it upon herself to burn many of his drawings and writings so whether this version of her husbands's final moments was the real version or her own fictional account of things as she would like them to have been (and as she would  like him to appear in historical accounts) is anyone's guess.As period films go this is not your usual fare. And as character portraits go this one is not going to be displayed in a public cinema for all to see (if it came to a theatre near you at all it probably did not stay long or garner much attention). If you are a person who likes to hear subversive sides of history, and you do not shy away from the unconventional character study, this just might be your period and character sketch.",4,Fascinating

A kind of revisionist cinema(cf. ""Kinsey"") after an original play.""The Libertine"" portrays a worthless aristocratic rake of 17th century England as a victim of his times, scoffing at everyone's truth but his own.  Once, again, a director, writer and producer have gotten together to ""see"" themselves into poor John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester:  a man struggling to assert his artistic side against a sea of hypocrisy only to be confounded by his failure to make sense of things - and of course his baser instincts.  Tragedy?  Hardly.  As a very sage person said to me once:  ""At some point, you have to take responsibility for what you do.""  Wilmot was hardly a ""victim,"" although that is the sense the film attempts to portray:  an existentialist drunk and lecher who wanted to hold the hypocrisy of his age up to it and suffered as a result.  This chap squandered every advantage given to him.There are to be sure a few good things about this movie:  the acting of Samantha Morton, Richard Coyle and, above all, John Malkovich was very good.  Johnny Depp, on the other hand, showed very little range nor was he convincing as other than trying to portray the Wilmot his director wanted.  Too bad:  great actor at times.  (Certainly not in the stupid ""Pirates"" movies.  God, please stop them!) The actor who has real insight into debaucheree - and who should have played Wilmot - is Robert Downey Jr.If you're interested in atmosphere - and for some reason like images of squalid London in the 17th century - try ""Stage Beauty,"" which in some ways is remarkably similar.  The big difference is that Wilmot' story,unlike that of the fictionalized Ned Kynaston, should never have come to the screen.  In fact, as Johnny-as-Johnny says at the beginning:  we won't like him - and we don't.This movie should simply have not have been made.  It was clearly a box office disaster, even at ""art houses.""

Most scenes take place in the night, lit up only by candles and torches. The camera constantly concentrates on the more shabby elements of 17th century life such as omnipresent mud and dirt leaving the audience hardly craving to be immediately transported to that period. One cannot fail to notice that the director, Laurence Dunmore, paid a lot of attention to the detail, the movie is quite exemplary in its attempt to restore the reality of late 17th century England, especially the life at the court and in theatres.The movie offers two great performances - Depp and Malkovich - and yet it is most probably addressed to a rather select audience of people who are genuinely interested in Rochester and his times. Most others will probably find too gloomy to keep them attracted until the end.",4,The Return of the Rake,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,1327,"['movie', 'rather', 'loose', 'retelling', 'final', 'years', 'life', 'John', 'Wilmot', '2nd', 'earl', 'Rochester', 'based', 'play', 'Stephen', 'Jeffreys', 'Rochester', 'courtier', 'poet', 'who', 'become', 'quintessential', 'example', 'Restoration', 'libertine', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'dynamics', 'two', 'characters', 'keeps', 'movie', 'alive.The', 'story', 'Rochester', 'downfall', 'poet', 'gradually', 'alcohol', 'venereal', 'disease', 'presented', 'rather', 'gloomy', 'way', 'Most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'lit', 'up', 'only', 'candles', 'torches', 'camera', 'constantly', 'more', 'shabby', 'elements', '17th', 'century', 'life', 'such', 'omnipresent', 'mud', 'dirt', 'leaving', 'audience', 'hardly', 'craving', 'be', 'immediately', 'transported', 'period', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'notice', 'director', 'Laurence', 'Dunmore', 'paid', 'lot', 'attention', 'detail', 'movie', 'quite', 'exemplary', 'attempt', 'restore', 'reality', 'late', '17th', 'century', 'England', 'especially', 'life', 'court', 'theatres.The', 'movie', 'offers', 'two', 'great', 'performances', 'Depp', 'Malkovich', 'yet', 'most', 'probably', 'addressed', 'rather', 'select', 'audience', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'Rochester', 'times', 'Most', 'others', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'too', 'gloomy', 'keep', 'attracted', 'end']",N/A

This is proven, once again, in ""Libertine"" where Johnny portrays John Wilmot, who  was the rather nasty 17th century Earl of Rochester in England, most brilliantly.Depp, as Wilmot warns the audience at the beginning of the movie while looking directly into the camera lens that the viewing audience will not like him too much.  True enough, after viewing Johnny Depp give a very brilliant, Academy Award worthy performance as Wilmot, one really indeed finds him hard to like.  Depp's performance in this film is astounding.  Early on in the film, Depp, as Wilmot, is a dashing debaucher that drinks far too much and is always fornicating or trying to fornicate with anyone while, at the same time, he is ""anti-establishment"" fighting with the king (wonderfully acted by John Malkovich who is fascinated by him) but also seems to be sensitive to the plights and hardships of the so-called underclass.  Depp then shows most brilliantly, Wilmot's fall from a dashing debaucher to a wetting on himself individual that becomes a horrid looking victim of syphilis (no penicillin).I enjoyed this film mainly because of Depp's acting skills plus all of the acting in the film is wonderful. (Be forewarned that there are not any of the characters in the film that are too likeable) In addition, I enjoyed this film because it showed England in the 1600s as I suppose it really was--heavely wigged, crime ridden, with  bad  muddy roads, very unsanitary, dirty, everyone  seeming to need a  bath,  etc.Don't pop this DVD into the player gathering the kiddies around with a bowl of popcorn expecting Johnny Deep to come swinging from a rope on a ship being cuddly.

Perhaps we were not meant to, which would explain the line ""I do not want you to like me"".  Rochester was a man who tried his best to purposefully be different and not understood; but because he was a man of high rank and station, he was expected to act a certain way...and to him that was boring.  Most people excused his impertinence, but over time they grew impatient with him, including his wife, mother and the king himself. The more they pushed him to conform, the more he willfully rebelled --practically damaging his own social reputation.  Rochester claims this a sickness of his.  Others say he's mad.Rochester is not a madman. Today we would simply say he's frustrated. He enjoyed all of life's pleasures and perversity.  Yet, he was in a position where he could not display those desires openly as he wanted, much like a General secretly wishing to star in his own Porn film.  It was simply not done. Therefore, the one outlet that Rochester could express his passions and eccentricities was in the theater via his conduit, Mrs. Barrie, an unkown starlet whom he groomed to be the greatest stage actress of her time.  Through her, he vicariously wielded his freedom to feel and live as he truly wanted.Thankfully, this movie did not turn into another sappy rennaissance sexual ""Casanova"" smitten by a virtuous woman.

Based on the highly regarded play of the same name by Stephen Jeffreys who thankfully transferred his poetry to the screen in a brilliant screenplay, THE LIBERTINE glows with a sense of history, of social conscience, of the tawdry court of King Charles II in England, and relates the brief but scandalous yet ultimately poetic life of John Wilmot, the second Earl of Rochester (1647 - 1680). Laurence Dunmore directs with a pace that is rapid and sure and a feeling for the story that is uncannily real. The film may bit a bit heavy for some viewers, but for those who cherish the English language written and spoken like Shakespearean poetry this film is a brilliant work.Johnny Depp as the Earl of Rochester delivers a dazzling portrayal complete with utter debauchery, incessant drinking, crude antics, razor sharp observations about life and the senses that marked the 33-year life of his character. From the open monologue about why he does not want to be liked to the closing recapitulation, Depp is immersed in this character, delivering a bravura performance bathed in Depp's gift to say as much with his eyes and his body language as with his delivery of lines.  As King Charles II  John Malkovich gives his finest role to date, stepping down from his original habitation in the role of John Wilmot he created on the Steppenwolf stage to offer a King riddled with problems of a kingdom at odds with history and rampant with social disease.  Rosamund Pike is radiant as Wilmot's frustrated and neglected wife and Samantha Morton brings the actress Lizzie Barry to life as the only woman Wilmot seemed to love - or was it really the theater he loved, the venue where he could allow his true motivations to be experienced instead of being trapped in the body ruled by libido in which he lived, eventually dying of the Great Pox (syphilis) in a wretchedly distorted body yet able in his last days to support the monarchy in an unexpected, highly dramatic appearance before Parliament.The large and impressive supporting cast includes cameos by Paul Ritter, Stanley Townsend, Francesca Annis, Tom Hollander, Johnny Vegas, Richard Coyle, Hugh Sachs, Tom Burke, Rupert Friend, Billy Downs, Kelly Reilly, Trudi Jackson, and Claire Higgins.  The costumes and scenery, lighting and camera work are some of the finest we've seen in period pieces.  And the musical score by Michael Nyman is superb, worth owning as a CD if it becomes available.There is an added feature on the DVD about the making of the film and watching it, with all the energy and love from the entire crew. Seeing this kind of banter form a group committed to making a fine independent film only serves to whet the appetite to immediately watch this excellent movie again.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

984402,AF8XXTXR6MNL4,B000F7CECK,In the Middle of the Road,"[13, 13]","Depp is a fine actor at almost anything, but so are many of the others in this film, e.g. the great John Malkovich. You'll either hate it or love it. In that sense, and only that sense, it is akin to Moulin Rouge. No one was lukewarm about it. Depp is developing of range that exceeds even his early promise.What makes this film difficult is that the film begins darkly and it never lets up. Depp's character warns you at the beginning, but is he serious? Yes. The sun doesn't shine every day. Wilmot/Rochester WAS a real libertine, a nihilist who had difficulty understanding what anything meant and understanding it all too well. He was unhappy when he got what he wanted and frustrated because in the end he got almost nothing of what he wanted.His sexual appetites were voracious in the extreme - women, men and probably anything else that stopped long enough for him to charm for the moment or seize by force.FWIW, I also admired Restoration. Downey shares with Depp the ability to pull almost anything off. And the period is a rich area to mine. Diffferent films. This is definitely not a comedy.You can see a stage play as its bones if you choose, but it is a script of the mind rather than of place. As to how closely it follows Wilmot's actual life, it may take liberties, but thematically not many, whether the abduction of his wife or his speaking for Charles II in something of a noble act near the end of it.Did this lifelong atheist renounce atheism on his deathbed? No one knows (or cares) but his mother harassed him as did the bishop who needed a trophy soul. But there are athiest in foxholes and Wilmot most likely died that as one.The Restoration was among other thjings a turn against the religious extremism of the Dissenters, AKA Puritans, Parliamentarians. But Wilmot's mother was by family a Puritan and parliamentarian; his father was a Royalist and military commander who spent much of he last years of his life out of the country. Was Rochester a great writer or a hack? Probably some of both. He wrote in a period that does not readily carry over to a popular audience. Shakespeare was as great as they come, but no ones queues up to see films of his plays.There is in any event, no place in the film where you are likely to find Depp's character appealing, except that Depp has the ability to extend himself such that you can glimpse the charm and wit of Rochester. His life makes all the more remarkable and appealing, for a moment, his courageous speaking for his friend and king.Was it wise in the end? Perhaps not. But it was wise for Wilmot himself.

This movie is not for the faint or heart or the shallow of mind nor the ignorant.With such a vast contrast in the reviews there is only two sides, those who didnt understand the plot, the times or the character and thus hated the movie and the other is those whose minds allowed them to go beyond the graffic immorality into a quite profound view of life, politics, pleasure, and religion. One of King Solomon's books in the bible ""Ecclesiastes"" came to mind more than once when contemplating this film""The Libertine was from the beginning a work of art. People may not understand it as I Jameson Thottam see it as an actor's movie. You need to understand the obstacles of playing a character like Rochester, and for once not having to be the gorgeous leading man that Hollywood wants you to be. The character development was flawless on Depp's part. When he was diseased in the end it was almost like his disease and Rochester became a mask and he acted through it. I was entranced throughout. Even the look of the movie was perfect. I have watched it so many times already, I was amazed.This was Johnny Depp's most complex role and he executed with a unique flare and a soulful brilliance. The writing, character development and directing were outstanding. Where ""Quills"" detailed the life and soul of a madman, ""The Libertine"" gives us a glimpse into the life of a true iconoclast. The Second Earl of Rochester is the amoral narcisist we all secretly wish we (including Jameson Thottam) could be.""If you go expecting the lovable Jack Sparrow, you will be disappointed.

984405,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B000F7CECK,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[7, 9]","It is very easy to become immersed in the exquisite performance turned in by Johnny Depp as John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester in ""The Libertine"".  And make no mistake.  It is, in this writer's opinion the best of Depp's career.  To portray an utterly irredeemable, repulsive and unapologetic character yet still manage not to alienate the audience requires nothing less than pure acting genius.  John Wilmot is indeed irredeemable, repulsive and unapologetic.  He is these things and more (or less depending on your perspective).  He is utterly and shamelessly addicted to sex, drink, perversion and all things dastardly.  He is also openly contemptuous of the monarchy to which he belongs and the charade of hypocrisy that it represents.  Perhaps we are drawn to Depp's character because he embraces these behaviors and their consequences rather than indulging in them with secrecy, embarrassment and shame.  What we feel for the Earl is very complex.  Not quite hatred, not quite pity.  But something mercurial that exists in between the two.However, The Libertine is so much more than just a vehicle for the tremendous acting mastery that Depp possesses.  It is in fact, endowed with several unique and compelling character studies.  There is the besmurched yet sentimental and tolerant King Charles II of England played by John Malkovich who, despite repeated insults and disappointments at the hands of his Earl, continues to give John Wilmot reprieves in the hopes that the Earl might finally produce some endearing body of literary work that would favor the King's administration.There is the maddeningly devoted wife of the Earl, Elizabeth, who continues to stand by her husband not simply out of duty as was expected in that era, but also out of genuine and unflinching love, despite the many ways in which he humiliates tortures and scorns her.Then there is the Earl's muse, the poor, plain but supremely talented stage actress Livvie Berry, who is at once repelled by and drawn to the Earl, despite her misgivings about his notorious repuation and obvious infatuation with her.  While Livvie is very far from the most sultry of vixens in which the Earl has indulged, he finds himself infatuated with her intelligence, her overwhelmingly defiant personality and the singular purpose with which the actress comports herself in achieving her one desire.  That is to be the most adored actress in England.  She is intelligent, strong and to the Earl's pleasant surprise, not simply another shallow conquest of the flesh.  Livvie Berry is perhaps the most intriquing character in the entire film.  Her's is one that indeed warrants a film all her own.The Libertine is a film that will go largely unappreciated by the mainstream viewing public because of it's period setting and graphic subject matter.  This however does not diminish the fact that it is a tremendous accomplishment in film.  Combined with the fact that it is also blessed with complex and uncommon characters who are portrayed exquisitely by an exceedingly talented cast, the film will 10 years from now still be viewed as a relevant commentary on several fronts whether sexual, moral, political or romantic.",5,Exquisite,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,3178,"['very', 'easy', 'become', 'immersed', 'exquisite', 'performance', 'turned', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'Libertine', 'make', 'mistake', 'writer', 'opinion', 'best', 'Depp', 'career', 'portray', 'utterly', 'irredeemable', 'repulsive', 'unapologetic', 'character', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'not', 'alienate', 'audience', 'nothing', 'less', 'pure', 'acting', 'genius', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'indeed', 'irredeemable', 'repulsive', 'unapologetic', 'things', 'more', 'less', 'depending', 'perspective', 'utterly', 'shamelessly', 'addicted', 'sex', 'drink', 'perversion', 'things', 'dastardly', 'also', 'openly', 'contemptuous', 'monarchy', 'charade', 'hypocrisy', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'drawn', 'Depp', 'character', 'behaviors', 'consequences', 'rather', 'indulging', 'secrecy', 'embarrassment', 'shame', 'What', 'feel', 'Earl', 'very', 'complex', 'Not', 'quite', 'hatred', 'not', 'quite', 'pity', 'something', 'mercurial', 'two.However', 'Libertine', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'vehicle', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'mastery', 'Depp', 'fact', 'endowed', 'several', 'unique', 'compelling', 'character', 'studies', 'besmurched', 'yet', 'sentimental', 'tolerant', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'England', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'repeated', 'insults', 'disappointments', 'hands', 'Earl', 'give', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'hopes', 'Earl', 'might', 'finally', 'produce', 'endearing', 'body', 'literary', 'work', 'would', 'favor', 'King', 'administration.There', 'maddeningly', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Earl', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'stand', 'husband', 'not', 'simply', 'duty', 'was', 'expected', 'era', 'also', 'genuine', 'unflinching', 'love', 'many', 'ways', 'tortures', 'scorns', 'her.Then', 'Earl', 'muse', 'poor', 'plain', 'supremely', 'talented', 'stage', 'actress', 'Livvie', 'Berry', 'who', 'once', 'repelled', 'drawn', 'Earl', 'misgivings', 'notorious', 'repuation', 'obvious', 'infatuation', 'Livvie', 'very', 'far', 'most', 'sultry', 'vixens', 'Earl', 'indulged', 'infatuated', 'intelligence', 'overwhelmingly', 'defiant', 'personality', 'singular', 'purpose', 'actress', 'achieving', 'one', 'desire', 'be', 'most', 'adored', 'actress', 'England', 'intelligent', 'strong', 'Earl', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'not', 'simply', 'shallow', 'conquest', 'flesh', 'Livvie', 'Berry', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intriquing', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'indeed', 'warrants', 'film', 'own.The', 'Libertine', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'largely', 'unappreciated', 'mainstream', 'viewing', 'public', 'period', 'setting', 'graphic', 'subject', 'matter', 'however', 'not', 'diminish', 'fact', 'tremendous', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'Combined', 'fact', 'also', 'blessed', 'complex', 'uncommon', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'exquisitely', 'exceedingly', 'talented', 'cast', 'film', 'will', '10', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'be', 'viewed', 'relevant', 'commentary', 'several', 'fronts', 'sexual', 'moral', 'political', 'romantic']",N/A
984406,A106016KSI0YQ,B000F7CECK,Jay Dickson,"[21, 22]","The Restoration was one of the most exciting and decadent periods in English history, marked by great debauchery, great artistic achievement, and great fun. Films covering this period tend to do very well with the first two parts of this but weakly on the third: there seems to be instead an imperative to moralize about the Restoration, to suggest that all this extramarital sex and boozing and cursing had to come at a great price to the human soul. THE LIBERTINE is one of the most insistent films on this moralistic equation, focusing as it does on the last years of the Earl of Rochester, one of the greatest Restoration poets and wits who died at age 33 of alcoholism and syphilis. (The film emphasizes this decay, showing Rochester at the end with a rotting nose and supporating scabs, balancing awkwardly on two canes.) Although Rochester and his friends were dubbed ""The Merry Gang"" by Andrew Marvell, they show about as little merriness as possible in director Laurence Dunmore's vision: as the DVD's highly intriguing and innovatively edited documentary ""Capturing the Libertine"" shows, several of the film's best jokes were left out altogether, presumably because they would alter too much the overall dark tone Dunmore adopts. (The best of these jokes, by the way, involves Rochester's servant and a pineapple.)The film has a very distinctive look to it: partly to emphasize the aura of menace and decay, but also as a cost-cutting measure, all of the outdoor scenes are obscured by thick dark smog and all of the indoor scenes are candlelit. Johnny Depp does terrific things as Rochester, although the screenplay requires him to be constantly foul-tempered and temperamentally anhedonic. Oddly, his foils of Charles II and the playwright George Etheredge are played by two actors who usually play Rochester-types on film, John Malkovich and Tom Hollander. Malkovich shines playing what is for him a very different type, the willful but somewhat dull-witted Stuart king. Samantha Morton acts superbly as Rochester's actress proteg&eacute; Elizabeth Barry, but unfortunately is not very charismatic; Rosamund Pike, ideally cast as a Restoration beauty, is much more appealing as Rochester's heiress wife Elizabeth Malet. The film is intelligently directed, but the screenplay just doesn't hang together. It's often hard to know what kind of point there is to all this other than that things fall apart and the center cannot hold, especially since several characters (such as Rochester's friend? lover? Billy Downs) are left underwritten and underexplained.",3,Got your nose!,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,2568,"['Restoration', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'decadent', 'periods', 'English', 'history', 'marked', 'great', 'debauchery', 'great', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'great', 'fun', 'Films', 'covering', 'period', 'tend', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'third', 'there', 'be', 'instead', 'imperative', 'moralize', 'Restoration', 'suggest', 'extramarital', 'sex', 'boozing', 'cursing', 'had', 'come', 'great', 'price', 'human', 'soul', 'LIBERTINE', 'one', 'most', 'insistent', 'films', 'moralistic', 'equation', 'focusing', 'last', 'years', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'one', 'greatest', 'Restoration', 'poets', 'wits', 'who', 'died', 'age', '33', 'alcoholism', 'syphilis', 'film', 'decay', 'showing', 'Rochester', 'end', 'rotting', 'nose', 'supporating', 'scabs', 'balancing', 'awkwardly', 'two', 'canes', 'Rochester', 'friends', 'were', 'dubbed', 'Merry', 'Gang', 'Andrew', 'Marvell', 'show', 'as', 'little', 'merriness', 'possible', 'director', 'Laurence', 'Dunmore', 'vision', 'DVD', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'innovatively', 'edited', 'documentary', 'Capturing', 'Libertine', 'several', 'film', 'best', 'jokes', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'altogether', 'presumably', 'would', 'alter', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'dark', 'tone', 'Dunmore', 'adopts', 'best', 'jokes', 'way', 'Rochester', 'servant', 'pineapple', 'film', 'very', 'distinctive', 'look', 'partly', 'emphasize', 'aura', 'menace', 'decay', 'also', 'cost-cutting', 'measure', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'obscured', 'thick', 'dark', 'smog', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'candlelit', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'terrific', 'things', 'Rochester', 'screenplay', 'be', 'constantly', 'foul-tempered', 'temperamentally', 'anhedonic', 'Oddly', 'foils', 'Charles', 'II', 'playwright', 'George', 'Etheredge', 'are', 'played', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'usually', 'play', 'Rochester-types', 'film', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'what', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'willful', 'somewhat', 'dull-witted', 'Stuart', 'king', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'superbly', 'Rochester', 'actress', 'proteg', 'eacute', 'Elizabeth', 'Barry', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'charismatic', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Restoration', 'beauty', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'Rochester', 'heiress', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Malet', 'film', 'intelligently', 'directed', 'screenplay', 'just', ""n't"", 'hang', 'together', 'often', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'point', 'other', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'center', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'especially', 'several', 'characters', 'such', 'Rochester', 'friend', 'lover', 'Billy', 'Downs', 'are', 'left', 'underwritten', 'underexplained']",N/A

984410,A64PKVY0MSBWR,B000F7CECK,"J. Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[0, 0]","I like watching movies with Johnny Depp simply because he's so fascinating to watch. One of the most photogenic actors of our time, it's hard to take your eyes off him. Plus, he's one of those actors who can inhabit a character and make that character very real for the audience. For this reason, I'm glad he's finally been recognized as the fine actor he is and is appearing in quite a few films. It's also a somewhat perverse pleasure to see an actor as gifted in the looks department as Depp, so often playing physically and spiritually deformed, grotesque characters.There are lots of things to enjoy about this film. The casting of Johnny Depp as the brilliant and handsome John Wilmot, second Lord of Rochester. Samantha Morton as the plain but passionate actress Elizabeth Barkley, and John Malkovich as the scheming, embattled Charles II. Plus the sets and costumes are as rich and sumptuous as you could wish for a drama taking place in 1670's England.But I spent a lot of the time feeling really confused by what was going on and why it was important. I usually consider myself a fairly intelligent, well-read person but I felt like a complete dunce trying to understand The Libertine. The main plot points are easy to understand: John Wilmot is a popular, wealthy wit in London's social and cultural scene during a period with more than its share of literary wits and satirists. Charles II brings Wilmot back to London because he's hoping someone of Wilmot's literary genious can create a play that will elevate Charles' monarchy in the eyes of Europe and legitimize his claim to the throne.Unfortunately, Wilmot doesn't play along. He seems to, on one hand, be an absolute poster child for Restoration England with its excesses and debauchery. On the other hand he is filled with loathing for himself, his friends, and the society in which he fits so well.Early on in the plot he falls in love with a plain actress and coaches her into the toast of the London stage. She becomes his muse and inspiration to write the play Charles II so badly wants. The play, unforntunately, is Wilmot's inspired take on Charles court and the king, humiliated in front of the French ambassidor, is not amused. Wilmot is banished again and this time, mortally ill with syphillis and damaged from alcohol abuse, he becomes a disgusting characature of his former glorious self.There is one final, wonderful scene when Wilmot redeems himself to the King and perhaps to himself. He finally takes action for something he believes in.Still with zillions of characters swirling around in the film and seemingly endless intriguing and positioning by those characters, I spent too much time trying to figure out who was who, what were they trying to do, and whether I should care.A gorgeous film about a fascinating character well-played by Johnny Depp but too muddled at times to be truly enjoyable.",3,Amazing performance by Johnny Depp but story is too confusing to fully enjoy,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2885,"['like', 'watching', 'movies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'simply', 'so', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'One', 'most', 'photogenic', 'actors', 'time', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'inhabit', 'character', 'make', 'character', 'very', 'real', 'audience', 'reason', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'been', 'recognized', 'fine', 'actor', 'appearing', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'also', 'somewhat', 'perverse', 'pleasure', 'see', 'actor', 'gifted', 'looks', 'department', 'Depp', 'so', 'often', 'playing', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'deformed', 'grotesque', 'are', 'lots', 'things', 'enjoy', 'film', 'casting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'brilliant', 'handsome', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'second', 'Lord', 'Rochester', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'plain', 'passionate', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Barkley', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'scheming', 'embattled', 'Charles', 'II', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'rich', 'sumptuous', 'could', 'wish', 'drama', 'taking', 'place', '1670', 'England.But', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'feeling', 'really', 'confused', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'why', 'was', 'important', 'usually', 'consider', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'well-read', 'person', 'felt', 'complete', 'dunce', 'trying', 'understand', 'Libertine', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'easy', 'understand', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'popular', 'wealthy', 'wit', 'London', 'social', 'cultural', 'scene', 'period', 'more', 'share', 'literary', 'wits', 'satirists', 'Charles', 'II', 'Wilmot', 'back', 'London', 'hoping', 'someone', 'Wilmot', 'literary', 'genious', 'can', 'create', 'play', 'will', 'elevate', 'Charles', 'monarchy', 'eyes', 'Europe', 'legitimize', 'claim', 'throne.Unfortunately', 'Wilmot', ""n't"", 'play', 'along', 'one', 'hand', 'be', 'absolute', 'poster', 'child', 'Restoration', 'England', 'excesses', 'debauchery', 'other', 'hand', 'filled', 'loathing', 'friends', 'society', 'so', 'well.Early', 'plot', 'love', 'plain', 'actress', 'toast', 'London', 'stage', 'muse', 'inspiration', 'write', 'play', 'Charles', 'II', 'so', 'badly', 'play', 'unforntunately', 'Wilmot', 'inspired', 'take', 'Charles', 'court', 'king', 'humiliated', 'front', 'French', 'ambassidor', 'not', 'amused', 'Wilmot', 'banished', 'again', 'time', 'mortally', 'ill', 'syphillis', 'damaged', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'disgusting', 'characature', 'former', 'glorious', 'self.There', 'one', 'final', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'when', 'Wilmot', 'King', 'perhaps', 'finally', 'action', 'something', 'in.Still', 'zillions', 'characters', 'swirling', 'around', 'film', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'intriguing', 'positioning', 'characters', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'should', 'care.A', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'fascinating', 'character', 'well-played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'too', 'muddled', 'times', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

You won't find a similar persona here.THE LIBERTINE is a dark film that the studio wisely decided to release only after the Christmas holiday season. In it, Depp plays John Wilmot, the second Earl of Rochester (b. 1647 - d. 1680), whose life of debauchery was a public scandal even in a society that tolerated the loose morality of King Charles II and his court. Ironically, as the film makes a point of depicting, Charles (John Malkovich) reluctantly, but regularly, banished Rochester from the royal presence for the liberties the latter took in lampooning the former's free-wheeling lifestyle.THE LIBERTINE is a depressing affair mainly because there's nobody in it to like. Moreover, neither Wilmot nor the viewers' sensitivities are spared the ravages of tertiary syphilis, the disease that ultimately kills the Earl; the film is a great argument for the advent of penicillin. Only Rosamund Pike as Rochester's long-suffering wife may gain audience sympathy. Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton), the struggling actress whose career Rochester takes upon himself to further, apparently for uncharacteristically altruistic reasons, matter-of-factly accepts his help but remained unengaging to this viewer. The gloom is enhanced by a cinematography accomplished in somber, washed-out tones, particularly brown and dark green, with lots of shadows and murky candle light. Even the daylight is muted, as if in winter.Now having said why THE LIBERTINE isn't light and airy, I have to also say that it's a powerful display of Depp's superlative talent. If the film wasn't so bleak, I'd expect a stampede to nominate Johnny for an Oscar. Rochester's two monologues for the camera, at the beginning and the end, the latter as his face recedes into darkness, are but hints of the excellence in between.At one point in the movie, Rochester says (if I remember correctly): ""Life isn't a sequence of 'urgent nows', but a listless trickle of 'why should I?s'."" The tragedy for Rochester is that, at least in this screenplay, answers to the latter are piteously few. However, your answer to the question when contemplating seeing the movie should be: ""Because Johnny Depp is as good as you'll ever seem him.""",4,No holiday season fare here,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,2320,"['go', 'THE', 'LIBERTINE', 'envisioning', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'previous', 'role', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'forget', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'similar', 'persona', 'here.THE', 'LIBERTINE', 'dark', 'film', 'studio', 'wisely', 'decided', 'release', 'only', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season', 'Depp', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'second', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'b', '1647', 'd.', '1680', 'life', 'debauchery', 'was', 'public', 'scandal', 'even', 'society', 'tolerated', 'loose', 'morality', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'court', 'Ironically', 'film', 'point', 'depicting', 'Charles', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'reluctantly', 'regularly', 'banished', 'Rochester', 'royal', 'presence', 'liberties', 'latter', 'took', 'lampooning', 'former', 'free-wheeling', 'lifestyle.THE', 'LIBERTINE', 'depressing', 'affair', 'mainly', 'nobody', 'like', 'Moreover', 'Wilmot', 'viewers', 'sensitivities', 'are', 'spared', 'ravages', 'tertiary', 'syphilis', 'disease', 'ultimately', 'Earl', 'film', 'great', 'argument', 'advent', 'penicillin', 'Only', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Rochester', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'may', 'gain', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Elizabeth', 'Barry', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'struggling', 'actress', 'career', 'Rochester', 'further', 'apparently', 'uncharacteristically', 'altruistic', 'reasons', 'matter-of-factly', 'help', 'remained', 'unengaging', 'viewer', 'gloom', 'enhanced', 'cinematography', 'accomplished', 'somber', 'washed-out', 'tones', 'particularly', 'brown', 'dark', 'green', 'lots', 'shadows', 'murky', 'candle', 'light', 'Even', 'daylight', 'muted', 'winter.Now', 'having', 'said', 'why', 'LIBERTINE', ""n't"", 'light', 'airy', 'have', 'also', 'say', 'powerful', 'display', 'Depp', 'superlative', 'talent', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bleak', ""'d"", 'expect', 'stampede', 'nominate', 'Johnny', 'Oscar', 'Rochester', 'two', 'monologues', 'camera', 'beginning', 'end', 'latter', 'face', 'darkness', 'are', 'hints', 'excellence', 'between.At', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Rochester', 'remember', 'correctly', 'Life', ""n't"", 'sequence', ""'urgent"", 'nows', 'listless', 'trickle', ""'why"", 'should', 's', 'tragedy', 'Rochester', 'least', 'screenplay', 'answers', 'latter', 'are', 'piteously', 'few', 'However', 'answer', 'question', 'when', 'contemplating', 'seeing', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'as', 'good', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'seem']",N/A
984413,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000F7CECK,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","""The Libertine"" I believe came out sometime last year; I say I belive because it says 2005 on the back, but I heard nothing about it. The only reason I decided to check it out was because Johnny Depp was in it and it seems everytime I see another one of his movies he never ceases to surprise me. Johnny Depp is almost the definition of a character actor. He's able to play so many different characters and in each one he becomes the character, he's always believable. Look at his resume': He's played Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Willy Wonka, Mort Raimey ('Secret Window'), J.M. Barrie, Jack Sparrow, Gilbert Grape, Ichabod Crane, and now John Wilmot. In this movie, dare I say it, Depp gives one of his finest performances. The movie opens with Depp talking directly to the camera; He introduces himself. He's John Wilmot, the second Earl of Rochester and he warns us ""You will not like me."" Actually, it's quite the opposite at the end. Turns out he's a very sympathetic character actually. Johnny (this is the character's name for the record) has been banished from London for a year because he said the word 'c**t' in front of King Charles II (John Malkovich, who's amazing as always and is also the producer). After an unsufficient amount of time of being banished, he's beckoned back to write a play as an introduction to a person who will be visiting from France. Meanwhile, Johnny falls in love with a young actress named Elizabeth Barry (Two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton, Best Actress 'Sweet & Lowdown' & 'In America'). Since you can find this out from reading the back cover; After Johnny writes the play, he is banished from higher society and we watch his downfall. This is where Depp truly hits his stride. Depp's transformation from the beginning of the movie to the end is incredible. In the beginning, he looks like Johnny Depp. At the end, he looks like Marilyn Manson mixed with a character from The Exorcist. The makeup here is Oscar worthy. The performances by the lead actors Depp, Morton, and Malkovich are all incredible as well...As I said though, this movie was so overlooked, any nominations would've been impossible. The movie is very different looking as well, it's very grainy at times but it works for the material somehow and it's not at all bothersome. This movie is not for everybody, I've already read several reviews from people who hated it. But the movie is pretty damned original and it had my eyes glued to the screen throughout. This is also one of the best movies I've seen in a while, set in this era.GRADE: A-",5,A Great Movie; Not For Everyone,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2560,"['Libertine', 'believe', 'came', 'out', 'sometime', 'last', 'year', 'say', 'belive', '2005', 'back', 'heard', 'nothing', 'only', 'reason', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'everytime', 'see', 'one', 'movies', 'never', 'surprise', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'almost', 'definition', 'character', 'actor', 'able', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'one', 'character', 'always', 'believable', 'Look', 'resume', 'played', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Mort', 'Raimey', 'Window', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'now', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'movie', 'dare', 'say', 'Depp', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'movie', 'Depp', 'talking', 'directly', 'camera', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'second', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'will', 'not', 'Actually', 'quite', 'opposite', 'end', 'out', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'actually', 'Johnny', 'character', 'name', 'record', 'been', 'banished', 'London', 'year', 'said', 'word', 'c**t', 'front', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'amazing', 'always', 'also', 'producer', 'unsufficient', 'amount', 'time', 'being', 'banished', 'beckoned', 'back', 'write', 'play', 'introduction', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'France', 'Meanwhile', 'Johnny', 'love', 'young', 'actress', 'named', 'Elizabeth', 'Barry', 'Two-time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Sweet"", 'Lowdown', ""'In"", 'America', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'Johnny', 'play', 'banished', 'higher', 'society', 'watch', 'downfall', 'where', 'Depp', 'truly', 'stride', 'Depp', 'transformation', 'beginning', 'movie', 'end', 'incredible', 'beginning', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'end', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'mixed', 'character', 'Exorcist', 'makeup', 'here', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'Depp', 'Morton', 'Malkovich', 'are', 'incredible', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'though', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'overlooked', 'nominations', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impossible', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'looking', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'grainy', 'times', 'material', 'somehow', 'not', 'bothersome', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'pretty', 'damned', 'original', 'had', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'set', 'era.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

In this film Depp plays the Earl of Rochester, who is a very intresting historical figure. During the special features one of the writers commented that in most historical dramas writers have to add something to hollywoodize it and make it more exciting, in Rochester's case things needed to be cut. This film is not for the small or closed minded. Many parts of it can be found offensive, not surprisingly immoral or socially unacceptable - but it is an amazing and unique film addressing issues not often attempted in film. The opening and closing monologues done by Johnny Depp alone are worth seeing the film, they are phenomenal. At first Johnny Depp is leaned back in a chair all you see is black on the screen, he begins to talk and leans forward basically telling his audience that you will not like me, that men will envy me and women will want to be me (this is hard to argue with!). Johnny Depp's range as an actor is greatly tested, and he once again stretches and tests his limits as an artist. All of the supporting characters are very well chosen and perform beautifully. I was especially fond of John Malkavich and Rosmund Pike's performance. The film is done in many dark colors, mostly grays and browns. It does not try at all to romanticize the era or its character.

But the way he delivered many of his lines got to be annoying. I've decided that that was his idea of Wilmot as a most-of-the-time-halfway-to-drunk person. But he delivered his lines the same way in scenes where I wasn't sure Wilmot was supposed to be drunk. But at the end of the film, Wilmot claims to his wife that he has been drunk for most of the previous 5 years -- roughly about the span of time covered in the film -- sooooo, OK, he was drunk all the time and so slurred his words like that all the time. Fair enough.But I didn't come back to watch this time and again for Johnny, but to watch nearly everybody else in their parts. This is just about the best supporting cast I've ever seen. I already loved Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander and knew they were both capable of excellent work and they absolutely live up to their talents. This is the only thing I've ever seen Samantha Morton do (except for watching ""Max and Ruby"" with my preschoolers; she was the original voice of Ruby) and she is SO breathtaking. I could watch her ""Lizzie acting"" scenes forever and never get tired of them. It made me feel sad that I can't actually go to a theater and SEE her play the roles her character was acting in the film. I wanted even more of her; there's just not enough of Lizzie in this film. And Johnny Vegas! Who knew??? He was fantastic as Charles Sackville and I will forever wonder what ""the full wibbly-wobbly"" is.  ;-) And, of course, John Malkovich, like Pike and Hollander, is ALWAYS good and he is here SO good yet again. I barely recognized Kelly Reilly; it was too big a change from her Mary Morstan Watson or Caroline Bingley characters for me to even recognize her until about the 3rd time I saw it. Rupert Friend was fine; he had such a small part here that I didn't get much of an impression. He's got some amazing cheekbones, and he DID do an EXCELLENT dying scene.I don't think the prologue/epilogue does much for the film. I just don't see why the audience needs either one. We are charged with deciding whether or not we'll ""like"" John Wilmot, even though that's not something the audience needs to be reminded to do. It's jarring and doesn't add anything meaningful to the film. Perhaps it played better on stage; I wouldn't know.Did this film get the promotion it deserved when it came out and I just wasn't paying attention? Because I never heard of it until just a couple of years ago. Sandwiched in between the first 2 ""Pirates"" films maybe it just got lost in the kerfuffle.This is ""R"" for a very good reason. I normally don't pay much attention to a film's ratings, (it's not how I judge a film's merits) but in this case I would really recommend the kids under 17 (or at least under 12) not be awake or at home when you're watching. I kept wondering what they had to cut OUT to keep it from being NC-17!

That's when I began observing his body of work. Over time, I have come to believe that he is quite possibly the finest American actor working today. He has taken quirky roles in offbeat films and made each one a signature piece of work. (His was by far the most interesting character in the drear CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, a film which had none of the charm of Gene Wilder's WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.) Depp finds the humanity inside each of his characters' eccentricities and makes us care about such oddballs as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and, in THE LIBERTINE, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, who was a mainstay of the hedonistic Restoration court of Charles II. Depp warns us at the outset that, ""You will not like me.""The real Wilmot was an alcoholic, whoremongering, drug-taking, likely bisexual poet and playwright, whose talent was obscured by his unbridled debauchery. Dying at thirty-three from rampant syphilis, Wilmot had spent years out of Royal favor for cruelly lampooning the King in verse and on stage. The Restored Charles, whose father had been beheaded in the Glorious Revolution, was, not unexpectedly, quite touchy on the subject of Royal respect (even though he was an amazingly prolific seducer of women from whose numerous illegitimate progeny came Princess Diana, Sarah, Duchess of York, and Camilla Parker Bowles, among many others).Depp brings Wilmot back to life with a deft hand. Although we are given many opportunities to view the various excesses that Wilmot was so fond of, Depp's character is not merely a slobbish one-dimensional barfly and sexual epicurean in noble finery. Depp is able to project Wilmot's inner essences, and we come away with a view of a man who lived life on the edge even as he observed it with a jaundiced eye and treated all those around him to a constant shower of vitriol, knowing that most of them deserved no more. He largely spared the women he loved (as opposed to slept with) the acid that was rotting him from within, but was unable to spare them the consequences of their love for him.A 21st century man in the 17th, Wilmot is a strangely familiar person, the type of instant celebrity that Hollywood revels in today. Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse. Well, two out of three ain't bad, and in THE LIBERTINE Johnny Depp touches the tragedy that makes up that style of life. No, you will not like John Wilmot, but you will understand him.",4,"""Do you like me now?""",1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,2590,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'lived', 'worked', 'personal', 'radar', 'years', 'one', 'day', 'realized', 'enjoyed', 'virtually', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'began', 'observing', 'body', 'work', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'quite', 'possibly', 'finest', 'American', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'taken', 'quirky', 'roles', 'offbeat', 'films', 'made', 'one', 'signature', 'piece', 'work', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'drear', 'CHARLIE', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'film', 'had', 'none', 'charm', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'WILLY', 'WONKA', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'Depp', 'humanity', 'characters', 'eccentricities', 'care', 'such', 'oddballs', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'THE', 'LIBERTINE', 'John', 'Wilmot', '2nd', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'who', 'was', 'mainstay', 'hedonistic', 'Restoration', 'court', 'Charles', 'II', 'Depp', 'outset', 'will', 'not', 'real', 'Wilmot', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'whoremongering', 'drug-taking', 'likely', 'bisexual', 'poet', 'playwright', 'talent', 'was', 'obscured', 'unbridled', 'debauchery', 'Dying', 'thirty-three', 'rampant', 'syphilis', 'Wilmot', 'had', 'spent', 'years', 'Royal', 'favor', 'cruelly', 'lampooning', 'King', 'verse', 'stage', 'Restored', 'Charles', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'beheaded', 'Glorious', 'Revolution', 'was', 'not', 'unexpectedly', 'quite', 'touchy', 'subject', 'Royal', 'respect', 'even', 'was', 'amazingly', 'prolific', 'seducer', 'women', 'numerous', 'illegitimate', 'progeny', 'came', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Sarah', 'Duchess', 'York', 'Camilla', 'Parker', 'Bowles', 'many', 'others', '.Depp', 'brings', 'Wilmot', 'back', 'life', 'deft', 'hand', 'are', 'given', 'many', 'opportunities', 'view', 'various', 'excesses', 'Wilmot', 'was', 'so', 'fond', 'Depp', 'character', 'not', 'merely', 'slobbish', 'one-dimensional', 'barfly', 'sexual', 'epicurean', 'noble', 'finery', 'Depp', 'able', 'project', 'Wilmot', 'inner', 'essences', 'come', 'away', 'view', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'edge', 'even', 'observed', 'jaundiced', 'eye', 'treated', 'constant', 'shower', 'vitriol', 'knowing', 'most', 'deserved', 'more', 'largely', 'spared', 'women', 'loved', 'opposed', 'slept', 'acid', 'was', 'rotting', 'was', 'unable', 'spare', 'consequences', 'love', 'him.A', '21st', 'century', 'man', '17th', 'Wilmot', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'person', 'type', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'Hollywood', 'revels', 'today', 'Live', 'fast', 'die', 'young', 'leave', 'good-looking', 'corpse', 'Well', 'two', 'three', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'THE', 'LIBERTINE', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'tragedy', 'up', 'style', 'life', 'No', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'will', 'understand']",N/A

In the newly released (though filmed in 2004) film ""The Libertine"" Johnny Depp plays John Wilmot, the 2nd Earl of Rochester, probably the second most debauched man in history after the Marque De Sod.  The comparisons have already been made between this film and ""Quils"" and they are accurate.  Reviewers seem utterly confused by this movie and there is also ample reason to be confused.  So, what can I say about it?  Should I say you should see it?  I don't know, who are you?It is not Captain Jack by any stretch of the imagination.  This is not a date flick, it is an historical picture steeped in deep grey fog and grainy film stock.  It is bleak from the word go, and true to Wilmot's tastes, rather crude in it's authentic approach to women, men, and sex.  In the film, Wilmot demands you not to like him and it is almost impossible to do so, apart from the few glimmering bits of wit that get tossed around between his horrid world view.  The film asks us to see the world of Charles II's rule not through the rosy glasses of history, but through the filth and muck it was trying to cover.  Mud is everywhere present, almost as if you couldn't escape it.  So too is fog, a metaphore for the way in which Charles' rock star like presence cast its shadow over history.It is a demanding film.  Few in the theater were comfortable at all, unless they were of a deviant mind (me) and knew the source material (me again) and some of the historical background (me three).  There is no happy ending, there is only a moment of brutal truth and vague heroics in the House of Lords at the end of Wilmot's short life, and then he dies.  The opening and closing speaches by Depp are sheer genius and Stephen Jeffereys who wrote both the play and the screenplay stick close to the style of speach of the period.  It is both stagy and gritty in realism.Never a big fan of John Malchovich, he does however turn in (with Depp) an Oscar worthy performance as Charles II (he played Wilmot in the stageplay and co-produced this film).  However, neither shall get their day because of the haphazard way in which this rather odd movie has been released.  It was technically considered for the Oscars we just saw on Sunday ... not that you would know it.My quote in the headlines, sadly, is one of the great lines in the play that did not make it into the film.  I fear it would go over everyone's head.  Which is sad, because the whole film will go over everyone's heads.",5,I've been drunk for 3 years ...

984420,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F7CECK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","When I expressed a strong sense of identification with the title character of ""The Libertine,"" my wife immediately took issue.  Since I restrict my lyricism to parody and nonsense verse, have never been drunk and indeed refrain from strong drink, and avoid dalliances by virtue of sitting in front of a computer all day let alone by extant morality, she did not see any grounds for comparison.  But the story of John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester, is that of a wasted life, and I just admitted to sitting in front of a computer all day and writing reviews while by bookshelf has a growing collection of successful books that bear an eerie resemblance to things I had contemplated writing.  Even with such a barren legacy, I have reason to believe I am ahead of John Wilmot, but the comparison remains an uncomfortable one, as well it should.Today the term ""libertine"" is most commonly taken to be a disparaging term used to describe a freethinking on religious matters.  But the character that Johnny Depp plays harkens back to those who were unrestrained by either convention or morality, and who led a dissolute life.  There is little doubt that John Wilmot is such a creature, but unlike the rest of his crowd he clearly takes no pleasure in taking such pleasures.  If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the opening monologue in which the title character speaks directly to the audience and tells us point blank, ""You will not like me.""  However, this is not an educational bio-pic, and if anything the desired effect is the catharsis of Greek tragedy, where fear and pity are to be exorcised by the viewer.  This is not a film to be enjoyed, but it is not so devoid of interest and value that it must be endured.  All things considered, I suppose it is closer to being a morality play than anything else, an estimation that seem patently obvious when you have a character who does of syphilis and probably a few other forms of venereal disease.Rochester's curse is that he is brilliant and that while his fellow libertines are happy to enjoy his pornographic verse, King Charles II (John Malkovich) expects more.  The monarch rightly points out that being for something is a lot harder than being against everything, and he provides yet another opportunity to Rochester to fulfill his promise.  There is an inherent paradox to the character in that while the king wants Rochester to be for him what Shakespeare was for Queen Elizabeth, and while others constantly allude to his intelligence and creativity, our anti-hero cannot do anything to prove them right because, well, that would prove them right, a state of affairs that will simply not do.  The problem is that the glimpses of the genius may well be insufficient because they are often couched in obscenity, pornography, and every other aspect of a dissolute existence Rochester can come up with.There are not that many films about the England of Charles II, but among that small number are two person favorites in ""Restoration"" and ""Stage Beauty.""  We had just watched the latter again last week, so while it is believed that the story of Rochester teaching Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton) to act are considered apocryphal (it first circulated after his death), we were obviously familiar with the fact that Charles II changed the laws and allowed women to perform on the stage.  But this portrayal of Charles II is one of the most somber we have seen in film to date, the cocker spaniels are not as obtrusive, and in the scene at the House of Lords in the last act the shadow of what would happen with the Glorious Revolution that would follow the king's death casts as much of a shadow as the regicide of his father.  Still, the scenes between Rochester and Barry provide one of the few times in the main part of the film where the earl is not dissolute and so it becomes a foundation for understanding the character even as the relationship undoes him body and soul (but not in that order).The performance by Depp is the centerpiece of the film and one of his best.  We may not like his character, but we sure are going to watch absolutely everything he does from start to finish.  Malkovich played the role of Rochester in the Steppenwolf Theater production of Stephen Jeffreys' play over a decade ago and first came up with the idea of having Depp do the movie role.  He is also one of the producers of the film, so he gets a large share of credit for seeing the production through.  This is Laurence Dunmore's first film as a director, apparently having been recommended by Depp on the basis of some commercial work.  As you would expect from such a period piece, they are a bevy of recognizable faces in the supporting cast, with a trio of them, Rosamund Pike as Elizabeth Malet, Tom Hallander as George Etherege, and Rupert Friend as Billy Downs, who would all go on to be in the most recent version of ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Personally, I always take delight in seeing Francesca Annis (""Lillie"") again (she plays the Countess), but the big surprise was that I did not recognize Richard Coyle (""Coupling"") as Alcock.  You can also spot Freddy Jones as Betterton and Stanley Townsend as Keown, also fleshing out the solid supporting cast.",4,"Johnny Depp as John Wilmot, the second earl of Rochester and the great

He's able to make us not like him while wanting to watch him.  John Malkovich's Charles II likewise did not add to his Oscar nominations (""Places in the Heart"" [84] & ""In the Line of Fire"" [93]), but he does an admirable job of playing hedonist & politician.  Samantha Morton as the actress Elizabeth Barry shows great character growth from waif to star of stage.  While this film also did not add to her Oscar nominations (Supporting actress ""Sweet & Lowdown"" [99] & Best Actress ""In America"" [03]), Samantha Morton does an excellent job of showing the status of women on the stage during the period.

But I had paid my admission fee and also was wondering how it would all turn out.  When the film was over, I was sorry I stayed.I was intrigued by the film because it is based on the true story of the Earl of Rochester, who died at the age of 33 of  venereal disease.  By that time his nose had been eaten away by the disease and he attended parliament wearing an artificial silver nose. I guess that is sort of sick, but I was intrigued, especially since Johnny Depp was cast in the lead and John Malkovitch was cast as King Charles.  Samantha Morton is Depp's love interest, a young actress who should have known better.  And yes, he also does have a wife who makes a brief appearance.The film, however, is all about the relationship between the libertine and the king.  The king is amused when the rouewrites obscene poetry and flaunts all convention.  But he is not so amused when the libertine's mocking wit is turned on the king. These are two good actors and they play their roles well.

Johnny Depp's performance as John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester in Restoration England, is nothing short of a tour de force, the decadent, depraved Wilmot a universe apart from the quirky Captain Jack Sparrow of Pirates of the Caribbean. A man in search of inspiration, jaded by the pleasures of his senses, Wilmot exclaims, ""What is in my mind is always more interesting than what is happening in the world."" Only in the theater does his blood stir, the magic combination of creativity and talent that offers moments of ecstasy. Wilmot does not enjoy his ennui, receives no satisfaction from the gluttony of his senses, yet he is driven to satisfy his urges, to slake the thirst once awakened.Serving as a muse for the aspiring actress, Elizabeth Barry (a brilliant Samantha Morton), it is through their intemperate relationship that Barry blossoms on the stage and Wilmot surpasses even his own excesses. Commanded by Charles II (John Malkovich) to write a masterpiece for the visiting French Ambassador, Wilmot immerses himself in a performance that Charles declares ""a pornographic representation of the court"", insulting the King and bringing about his own ruin. On the run, Wilmot makes his way in the streets; cornered, confronted by the king, even banishment is denied the offender: ""I condemn you to be yourself for the rest of your days."" Drunkenness and debauchery haunt Wilmot to the end of his syphilitic life at only thirty-three, his brilliance snuffed out by the very decadence that fuels the quest to stimulate passion.From the opening monologue (""You will not like me. I do not want you to like me.""), until the end of the film, Wilmot's beauty destroyed by disease, his spirit shines just as intensely and provocatively, unrepentant. This is, after all, Restoration England, Europe consumed by concupiscence and public displays that resemble scenes from Hieronymus Bosch. The grainy film and smoky scenes, mud-sludged streets are recreated in uncomfortable detail, dragging the viewer into the muck of a civilization dedicated to its own narcissism. This creative endeavor is not only a descent into Hell; it is a journey through it, a transcendent experience for anyone willing to immerse himself in the film. No, we do not like this character, but in the end Wilmot is heartbreaking, a victim of his basest urges who exists in a prison of despair. Complex, challenging, beautifully writ, this is not fare for all, the language ribald and offensive, but true to the era, a painful, haunting slice of the human psyche at its most vulnerable. In the closing monologue, Wilmot asks, ""Do you like me now?"" Without reservation.

984432,A1URVCR4OMLG0O,B000F7CECK,N. Chevalier,"[4, 4]","Back in 1698, a petulant cleric named Jeremy Collier attacked what he saw as the lack moral fibre in the theatre, and set off a decade-long debate about public morals, sex, religion, and plays.  Collier would have loved *The Libertine*, since it does for the 17th century what the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* did for war--revealed its visceral repulsiveness.  Ostensibly a film about the debauched genius, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, the film is really a safe-sex morality play for the 21st century, the squalor and mud of 1675 operating as a metaphor for the filth of Rochester's own sexual excesses.  The historical Rochester did indeed die at the age of 33 (in 1680) of syphillis, albeit so repentant by the end that Bishop Gilbert Burnet, his confessor, wrote a biography of him shortly after his death praising his saintliness.  But Rochester was more than just booze and women, and it must be remembered that his legend was bigger than the reality: virtually every pornographic poem written between 1660 and 1680 was attributed to him.  But Rochester was also capable of conventional poetry: his best work, ""A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind,"" displays the true level of his genius more than ""Signior Dildo""--although for Rochester, the two are probably inseparable.But that's all tangential to the film; and that's part of the problem.  Johnny Depp's Rochester is a man with a hangover--bored by his debaucheries, sick of being an aristocrat, desperately looking for some meaning to his life.  He thinks he finds it in Elizabeth Barry, whom he coaches in acting and eventually claims to love. But his past sins catch up with him: he alienates her, the King (yet again) and his family, and we watch him literally rot away until his death.  Yet, mesmerising as Depp's performance is, the backdrop to his and Samantha Morton's scenes together is unrelenting gloom and mud.  The portrayal of Rochester's friends is no better: Sir George Etherege wrote one of the most celebrated comedies in English--yet he is portrayed here as a colossal bore, and the brief glimpse we have of *The Man of Mode* in the film makes it seem as stiff and unfunny as a Dryden tragedy.  His sidekick, Sir Charles Sedley (I think it's him), is here portrayed as a repugnant, fat oaf.  The overall effect is that these people were all disgusting pigs, and Rochester is the chief pig among them.  There is, therefore, none of the delight in wit and artifice that defined high Restoration culture, nothing of the striking contrast between the beauty of theatre, art, and music and the grubbiness of daily life.  Rochester celebrated both, although the film prefers to show him only playing in the dirt.Despite its shortcomings in presenting the Restoration, the film is an interesting study in moral lessons, and is primarily watchable for its performances by Depp, especially in the latter stages, when his horribly debilitated by syphillis, and by Samantha Morton as the ambitious Elizabeth Barry (who really was almost thrown out of Betterton's company at the start of her career).

It's only a question of time before his flesh gives out from his excesses.  At one point it seems that he finds something real to care about besides self-loathing in the actress, Lizzie Berry...but perhaps it's just that she won't give herself to him completely to him that keeps him on the hook.

My copy of ""Libertine"" went to the used DVD store this morning.  I made a special trip because the thing might infect my other discs.The strange thing is, this should never have happened.  The life of John Wilmot, the 2nd Earl of Rochester, is a fascinating subject for a film.  Rochester, virtually the most decadent man in a decadent age, epitomized Restoration England's rejection of Puritan tyranny.  Unfortunately, you would never realize this from the film - in which Charles II and his world exist virtually in an historical vacuum.  In fact, just about the only time actual history intrudes upon the film is the scene - incidentally far and away the best scene in the film - in which Rochester (largely incapacitated by his galloping syphilis) appears in the House of Lords and contrives the passage of a bill that will assure the accession of Charles II's brother, James II.  (This of course assured the accession of William III and Mary II, not quite what Charles had wanted.)Rochester, a brilliant poet and playwright, could have been a great ornament to Charles II's court had he not chosen to alternate between defying the megalomaniacal king and vilifying him.  This aspect of their relationship isn't exactly ignored in the film, although when it appears it appears to come from nowhere rather than having a history.  The film opens with a monologue by Depp, which pushes the point that Rochester's rather unlikable character is primarily a deliberate pose.  This unwonted diluting of his personal tragedy is only the first misjudgement of many that tie ""Libertine's"" shoelaces into such an awful knot.  We then progress to Rochester's position at court, which is shown to be precarious.  Rochester's main concerns at the moment are a new production requested by the king and an actress, a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of his, Elizabeth Berry.The production, once staged, is obviously intended to represent the entertainment that so offended the king as to provoke a break between him and the abrasive Rochester.  It's hard to judge the historical accuracy of the film's representation of that event, which seems a bit much.  However, one would have to go some in order to scandalize what was without doubt the most dissolute court in Europe.  In disgrace, Rochester disappears for a time, taking Miss Berry with him.  The film, alas, doesn't inform the viewer about actresses during the Restoration.  For one thing, until about this period women weren't allowed on the stage.  In fact, nobody was allowed on the stage during the Puritan tyranny (the ""Commonwealth"").  ""The Libertine"" doesn't even mention that Charles II's primary mistress, Nell Gwyn, was herself a well-known actress.When Rochester reappears, he is much ravaged by terminal syphilis.  Wearing a false nose and barely walking with 2 canes, he aids the king during the crisis over the succession.  He eventually dies - probably not much more frustrated than the audience.Generally speaking, it takes bad actors to make a really bad picture.  In this case, however, the genuine excellence of the cast throws the great awfulness of this film into high relief.  Rochester is played by Johnny Depp -- who, if anyone could, might have saved this thing.  He plays the part with enormous verve and sincerity, as he always does.  Alas, all he does here is manage to highlight the banality and stereotypicality of the script.John Malkovich, whose understated sophistication doesn't always endear him to viewers, is the perfect foil for Depp as Charles II.  Malkovich, in full makeup, is shown as a perfect descendent of the supremely ugly James I (but, of course, Charles - unlike James - was partial to women) (hence the later references to the era of ""good King Elizabeth and good Queen James"").  His performance is absolutely spot-on, even to the extent that he's frequently able to upstage Depp.I've not run across the obviously talented Samantha Morton before.  She tends to appear in films that, were I to watch them, would have me thinking, ""Gee, I could be watching the `Toon Channel instead!""  Here, her performance as Elizabeth Berry is first-rate.Other performances become increasingly minor, but I can't say that any of them was badly done.  Notwithstanding, these valiant efforts are swallowed up in this great sprawling confusion of a film.  It's difficult to say which is the murkier aspect of this:  the photography or the combined results of script and editing.Much of the problem with the film's photography is that it appears to be a failed attempt to use natural lighting - including candle light.  The result is mostly varying degrees of off-focus dimness.  One constantly has to squint to make sure that one's eyes are working properly and what's wrong is on the screen.The script may have been, at the beginning, a model of orderly logic.  Once processed into a final product, however, the result is jumbled and more non-linear than any storyline should be.  While the general development of things is more or less evident, following motivations and the order of events can often be frustrating.If you want to experience a well-made film set in this same period, one that develops its themes with great force and clarity, watch ""Restoration"".  This reminds me of another problem with ""Libertine"".  ""Period"" films often benefit greatly from scores featuring music of the same period.  Unlike ""Restoration"", which gives us an auditory feast of Purcell and other musicians of the era, ""Libertine"" gives us hardly anything - and certainly not the glorious music of the reigns of the late Stuarts.  It may be of interest to note that it was Purcell who wrote incidental music to a play by Thomas Shadwell called ... wait for it ... ""The Libertine"".

The Sexual Revolution wasn't the first time that society rebelled against a prudish religiosity and celebrated sexuality. The Libertine depicts the Restoration when England chose the monarchy over the puritans and ushered in an era of sexual freedom that was both liberating and a little sleazy.Unlike the Robert Downey movie, this movie depicts the Restoration in all of its horrifying glory. Through John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, this movie gives us a Restoration which is sleazy, dirty, really fun and very dangerous. Wilmot was a great writer who couldn't be bowdlerized and often upset his patron Charles II. His last minute conversion to faith provided a wealth of material for preachers.As the protagonist, Johnny Depp is mesmerizing. Granted, the man loves playing writers (and yet is one of the few actors who hasn't actually tried to be a writer) but this is an especially mesmerizing writer who knew that he could get away with everything and pushed the limits to the point where he couldn't get away with it. Yet, his main focus is still the art of the theater so even though favorite scenes may be the Senor Dildo song, it's the mentoring of Samantha Morton's actress that provides the emotional center.This is a movie that is both beautiful and horrifying in equal measures. I have watched it dozens of times and still love it. While it might not be for everyone (it was pretty widely panned by critics) if you're predisposed to love strange movies about writers who push the boundaries, you will love this movie.",5,Mesmerizing movie about sleazy wonderful people.,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1892,"['movie', 'known', 'movie', 'where', 'Depp', 'syphilis', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'critics', 'would', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'When', 'watch', 'historical', 'dramas', 'tend', 'watch', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Victorian', 'movies', 'where', 'everyone', 'very', 'uptight', 'history', 'lot', 'more', 'racy', 'give', 'credit', 'Sexual', 'Revolution', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'society', 'rebelled', 'prudish', 'religiosity', 'celebrated', 'sexuality', 'Libertine', 'Restoration', 'when', 'England', 'chose', 'monarchy', 'puritans', 'ushered', 'era', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'was', 'liberating', 'little', 'sleazy.Unlike', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'movie', 'movie', 'Restoration', 'horrifying', 'glory', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'movie', 'Restoration', 'sleazy', 'dirty', 'really', 'fun', 'very', 'dangerous', 'Wilmot', 'was', 'great', 'writer', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bowdlerized', 'often', 'upset', 'patron', 'Charles', 'II', 'last', 'minute', 'conversion', 'faith', 'provided', 'wealth', 'material', 'preachers.As', 'protagonist', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'mesmerizing', 'Granted', 'man', 'playing', 'writers', 'yet', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', ""n't"", 'actually', 'tried', 'be', 'writer', 'especially', 'mesmerizing', 'writer', 'who', 'knew', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'pushed', 'limits', 'point', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'main', 'focus', 'still', 'art', 'theater', 'so', 'even', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'Senor', 'Dildo', 'song', 'mentoring', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'actress', 'emotional', 'center.This', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'horrifying', 'equal', 'measures', 'have', 'watched', 'times', 'still', 'love', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'was', 'pretty', 'widely', 'panned', 'critics', ""'re"", 'predisposed', 'love', 'strange', 'movies', 'writers', 'who', 'push', 'boundaries', 'will', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

984455,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000F7CECK,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[93, 102]","England, 1675. John Wilmot (Johnny Depp), the Earl of Rochester, finds his banishment lifted by King Charles II (John Malkovich). The King banished Wilmot a few months earlier for writing a poem critical of the Monarchy, but now Charles finds himself in a predicament. After fifteen years of increased personal, sexual and artistic freedoms, the British people are now dealing with disease, warfare and natural disaster. They aren't happy and this is testing Charles' reign. Charles decides Wilmot will write a play. However, Wilmot views his return to society as license to drink as much as he wants, sleep with as many people as possible and the King be damned.""The Libertine"", directed by Laurence Dunmore and written by Stephen Jeffreys, based on his own play, is a very good film, for the most part.The film opens with Depp in darkness and shadow, holding a wine glass, moving towards the candlelight and into our view. Wilmot informs us ""You will not like me"". As he continues, he announces ""Ladies, I am up for it all the time."" This scene is already one of the most memorable in recent film. Because it is Johnny Depp, many women (and for that matter, some men) will swoon as soon as he appears onscreen, but as he begins to warn us, he further cements our memory of this character. His frank and open manner is very memorable.Sure enough, as the film progresses, we don't like Wilmot. It is a testament to Depp's skill as an actor that we don't really care. Depp's portrayal is interesting and challenging, both of which more than make up for the lack of a likable hero in the story. Wilmot enjoys all of the pleasures of living in society and enjoys them well. As he and his wife ride back to London, he fondles her as she recounts how they initially met, a strangely erotic story portrayed in a charged way. In London, he immediately revisits a favorite bordello. Soon, he meets Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton), an actress who attracts his attention and receives his guidance. A good example of his uninhibited nature is displayed when Wilmot meets the man who will eventually become his new valet. After setting a test for the subject, Wilmot is surprised to learn the man's name is Allcock. Very fitting for the playwright. All the while, he drinks, and drinks, and drinks. Depp manages to make all of this carousing and carrying on seem entirely natural.Later, when Charles calls upon John to write the play, for a visit from the French Ambassador, he pens a work about Charles, as only Wilmot can. But that is best left to your discovery.What I didn't get from the film, or Depp's performance, was evidence of why Wilmot is remembered today as a good writer. During a few scenes, he creates some interesting verbal word play, but the one play we get a glimpse of is clearly designed to offend the monarch and little else. The work seems amateurish, even childish in execution, so it doesn't work as a testament to his ability as a writer.""The Libertine"" is strangely beautiful to watch. I suspect the movie was filmed using high definition video and available light. As all lighting during this period is provided by candle, light sources are inconsistent, flickering, allowing more dark to seep into the frame. Because of this same lack of light, the film has a very grainy look and all objects are drained of color imbuing a sepia tone throughout. As you watch the story, you get the sense of reading an old book, or looking at old drawings torn from a 17th Century manuscript. The look of the film is further enhanced by attention to detail in both costumes (suitably elaborate) and scenery (suitably muddy and dark). The look of the film is entirely successful, capturing details of London during the Seventeenth Century.Samantha Morton and John Malkovich are both good, restrained and believable, providing a nice counterpoint to Depp's more theatrical performance. Malkovich doesn't scream or rant, as you might expect, giving his portrayal of Charles II more believability, more vulnerability. Charles II was vulnerable during this period, so it works. Morton brings a quiet power to her performance. Manipulated by Wilmot and Charles, she seems a pawn throughout. But as we watch her performance, we begin to question that, and realize perhaps she is stronger than we initially thought.""The Libertine"" is a very good film, featuring a memorable, uninhibited performance by Depp. But it doesn't fulfill its initial promise to convince us of why Wilmot is still remembered to this day. A late scene in the film shows a number of his writings and drawings being destroyed by a family member. Why was he remembered as a great writer? How was he remembered? Through word of mouth? How were his writings remembered?Hopefully, the film will not suffer the same fate as its `hero'.",4,Depp At His Best.,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,4798,"['England', '1675', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'banishment', 'lifted', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'King', 'banished', 'Wilmot', 'few', 'months', 'earlier', 'writing', 'poem', 'critical', 'Monarchy', 'now', 'Charles', 'predicament', 'fifteen', 'years', 'increased', 'personal', 'sexual', 'artistic', 'freedoms', 'British', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'dealing', 'disease', 'warfare', 'natural', 'disaster', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'testing', 'Charles', 'reign', 'Charles', 'Wilmot', 'will', 'write', 'play', 'However', 'Wilmot', 'return', 'society', 'license', 'drink', 'as', 'much', 'sleep', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'King', 'be', 'damned', 'Libertine', 'directed', 'Laurence', 'Dunmore', 'written', 'Stephen', 'Jeffreys', 'based', 'own', 'play', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'most', 'part.The', 'film', 'Depp', 'darkness', 'shadow', 'holding', 'wine', 'glass', 'moving', 'candlelight', 'view', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'Ladies', 'am', 'up', 'time', 'scene', 'already', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'recent', 'film', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'many', 'women', 'matter', 'men', 'will', 'swoon', 'as', 'soon', 'onscreen', 'warn', 'further', 'cements', 'memory', 'character', 'frank', 'open', 'manner', 'very', 'memorable.Sure', 'enough', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Wilmot', 'testament', 'Depp', 'skill', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Depp', 'portrayal', 'interesting', 'challenging', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'likable', 'hero', 'story', 'Wilmot', 'pleasures', 'living', 'society', 'well', 'wife', 'ride', 'back', 'London', 'how', 'initially', 'met', 'strangely', 'erotic', 'story', 'portrayed', 'charged', 'way', 'London', 'immediately', 'favorite', 'bordello', 'Soon', 'Elizabeth', 'Barry', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'actress', 'who', 'attention', 'guidance', 'good', 'example', 'uninhibited', 'nature', 'displayed', 'when', 'Wilmot', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'new', 'valet', 'setting', 'test', 'subject', 'Wilmot', 'surprised', 'learn', 'man', 'name', 'Allcock', 'Very', 'fitting', 'playwright', 'while', 'drinks', 'drinks', 'Depp', 'make', 'carousing', 'carrying', 'seem', 'entirely', 'natural.Later', 'when', 'Charles', 'John', 'write', 'play', 'visit', 'French', 'Ambassador', 'work', 'Charles', 'only', 'Wilmot', 'can', 'best', 'left', 'discovery.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'Depp', 'performance', 'was', 'evidence', 'why', 'Wilmot', 'remembered', 'today', 'good', 'writer', 'few', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'verbal', 'word', 'play', 'one', 'play', 'get', 'glimpse', 'clearly', 'designed', 'offend', 'monarch', 'little', 'else', 'work', 'amateurish', 'even', 'childish', 'execution', ""n't"", 'work', 'testament', 'ability', 'writer', 'Libertine', 'strangely', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'suspect', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'using', 'high', 'definition', 'video', 'available', 'light', 'lighting', 'period', 'provided', 'candle', 'light', 'sources', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'flickering', 'allowing', 'more', 'dark', 'seep', 'frame', 'same', 'lack', 'light', 'film', 'very', 'grainy', 'look', 'objects', 'are', 'drained', 'color', 'imbuing', 'sepia', 'tone', 'watch', 'story', 'get', 'sense', 'reading', 'old', 'book', 'looking', 'old', 'drawings', 'torn', '17th', 'Century', 'manuscript', 'look', 'film', 'further', 'enhanced', 'attention', 'detail', 'costumes', 'suitably', 'elaborate', 'scenery', 'suitably', 'muddy', 'dark', 'look', 'film', 'entirely', 'successful', 'capturing', 'details', 'London', 'Seventeenth', 'Century.Samantha', 'Morton', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'are', 'good', 'restrained', 'believable', 'providing', 'nice', 'counterpoint', 'Depp', 'more', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'Malkovich', ""n't"", 'scream', 'rant', 'might', 'expect', 'giving', 'portrayal', 'Charles', 'II', 'more', 'believability', 'more', 'vulnerability', 'Charles', 'II', 'was', 'vulnerable', 'period', 'Morton', 'quiet', 'power', 'performance', 'Manipulated', 'Wilmot', 'Charles', 'pawn', 'watch', 'performance', 'begin', 'question', 'realize', 'perhaps', 'stronger', 'initially', 'thought', 'Libertine', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'featuring', 'memorable', 'uninhibited', 'performance', 'Depp', ""n't"", 'fulfill', 'initial', 'promise', 'convince', 'why', 'Wilmot', 'still', 'remembered', 'day', 'late', 'scene', 'film', 'number', 'writings', 'drawings', 'being', 'destroyed', 'family', 'member', 'Why', 'was', 'remembered', 'great', 'writer', 'How', 'was', 'remembered', 'word', 'mouth', 'How', 'were', 'writings', 'remembered', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'hero']",N/A

He's a little witty, sure, but then he gets syphilis and man does the pretty fade fase. So it's the Johnny Depp with Syphilis movie.When I borrowed it from my library, I discovered that I loved it. Depp is a 17th century poet who is part of King Charles II's court but an annoying part - the part of the court that Charles would just assume kill as make into the Shakespeare of Restoration. Call itRestorationwithout the main character becoming a Puritan and saving his baby from the Fire of London.Depp's Lord Rochester is a talented poet with a bigger talent for sex and shenanigans. His life is a party and he's enjoying it to the fullest. He has a wife with whom he recites fond stories of kidnapping her. He gets involved with Samantha Morton's actress and trains her how to act while falling in love with her. Eventually he has to flee London but it doesn't help him. When he returns his body is wracked with diseases and his nose is falling off.That is a terrible way of describing the movie. The storyline is one thing as it discusses the limits of what you can do when you have a lifestyle that cannot support your health and well being. His venom spewed attempts at reconciliation and redemption toward the end are sad because he has become a man who needs people long after those people even wanted him around.The best part of the movie is the set - both elegant and dirty.

But we know the list of the characters he had played in the past, and most of them shared a lot of idiosyncratic traits which could be easily off-putting by the hand of other less talented actors. Now, in `Libertine' Depp shows another example of his unique gift as an actor who manages to make us like one of the most debauched characters in real life, one John Wilmot or Earl of Rochester.I don't know anything about the person Depp plays, and probably you don't have to either. The life of poet/dramatist/quack doctor, anti-hero John Wilmot, based on the play by Stephen Jeffreys, follows the self-destructive course of almost every doomed artist: women, drink, and early death.Despite the dedicated and electrifying acting from Depp, the very raw and emotionally-charged performance from Rosamund Pike as his loving wife, and the convincing locations with mud, mud, mud and the great production designs by Ben van Oz (`Girl with a Pearl Earring'), the film somehow refuses to get truly involving except for several touching moments.Perhaps John Malkovich's portrayal of King Charles II who offers occasional help (with some contempt) is a bit detached and looks cold. Or Samantha Morton's actress Elizabeth, the only possible one who can offer the chance for the salvation of Rochester's soul, is slightly icy and a little too modern. Or the film's photography is too `natural,' sometimes too murky, and the camera is often too shaky and even out of focus.But most of all, the life story of Earl of Rochester, according to the film, looks like assorted from the various episodes that had been seen in other bio-pics like `Total Eclipse.' Not that the film depends on the stock characters and clich?d ideas, but the film is often episodic, the material definitely needs more sophisticated treatment and better storytelling to present the complexity of this artist. Only Johnny Depp seems to know the complicated nature of this character, establishing surprisingly sympathetic portrait of this hopelessly egotistic poet.",3,Depp Delivers Superb Acting: Murky and Shaky Camera Only Damages It,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2137,"['film', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'solemnly', 'camera', 'looking', 'eye', 'will', 'not', 'know', 'list', 'characters', 'had', 'played', 'past', 'most', 'shared', 'lot', 'idiosyncratic', 'traits', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'off-putting', 'hand', 'other', 'less', 'talented', 'actors', 'Now', 'Libertine', 'Depp', 'example', 'unique', 'gift', 'actor', 'who', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'debauched', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'person', 'Depp', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'poet/dramatist/quack', 'doctor', 'anti-hero', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'based', 'play', 'Stephen', 'Jeffreys', 'self-destructive', 'course', 'almost', 'doomed', 'artist', 'women', 'drink', 'early', 'death.Despite', 'dedicated', 'electrifying', 'acting', 'Depp', 'very', 'raw', 'emotionally-charged', 'performance', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'loving', 'wife', 'convincing', 'locations', 'mud', 'mud', 'mud', 'great', 'production', 'designs', 'Ben', 'van', 'Oz', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'film', 'somehow', 'get', 'truly', 'involving', 'several', 'touching', 'moments.Perhaps', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'portrayal', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'who', 'occasional', 'help', 'contempt', 'bit', 'detached', 'cold', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'only', 'possible', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'offer', 'chance', 'salvation', 'Rochester', 'soul', 'slightly', 'icy', 'little', 'too', 'modern', 'film', 'photography', 'too', 'natural', 'sometimes', 'too', 'murky', 'camera', 'often', 'too', 'shaky', 'even', 'focus.But', 'most', 'life', 'story', 'Earl', 'Rochester', 'according', 'film', 'assorted', 'various', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'bio-pics', 'Total', 'Eclipse', 'Not', 'film', 'stock', 'characters', 'clich', 'd', 'ideas', 'film', 'often', 'episodic', 'material', 'definitely', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'treatment', 'better', 'storytelling', 'present', 'complexity', 'artist', 'Only', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'know', 'complicated', 'nature', 'character', 'establishing', 'surprisingly', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'hopelessly', 'egotistic', 'poet']",N/A

For some reason, I was more amused with the fact that half the cast of Pride and Prejudice and Pirates of the Caribbean were in this film, than I was with anything that happened in the film.

It *is* a historical drama, and no doubt a lot of the film is guesswork, although much is documented: the mores of the times, the political situations, the ornate dress and speech, the theater, in which actresses at the time were prostitutes, and had only recently been allowed on the stage at all.  Recall that in Shakespeare's day, only men acted, with boys taking the women's parts.  So the movie is of great interest as a historical piece.  Do not watch it for the story.  It is a sad one, with not much happening except the dissolution of a young man, whose drinking no doubt hastens his death.

This is an actor with astounding range and creativity. His willingness to take on the most challenging (if not, one might think, by Hollywood standards, downright undesirable parts, then making them so) roles, making each one uniquely his own, has earned my respect.The Libertine, with Depp playing the part of John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, in 17th century England, brings us into the life and psyche of a man who devoted himself to debauchery. He was not ashamed of it. Indeed, he seemingly thrived on his own dark reputation, relishing the sensation (word play intended) he caused.The movie, directed by Laurence Dunmore, opens on a dark screen, with Depp - John Wilmot - emerging momentarily from the shadows to announce to his viewers in a kind of stunning intimacy: ""You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled."" At least in speaking for the ladies, if I may, he's right. Wilmot is the ultimate con-artist, the ladies' man who breaks hearts, uses women for his pleasure, then leaves them behind once he has gotten his. To him, women exist only to provide him all sensual pleasures.To live such a life, however, in whatever century, and despite a man's every effort to deny to himself his own greater humanity, leads to depression, and Wilmot is no exception. When he isn't doing ""the act,"" he is finding himself in the bottle. His one redeeming quality is his writing talent. For this, he is hired by  King Charles II, played by John Malkovich, to produce theatre to gain popularity for the King.Even a libertine such as Wilmot, however, has a heart buried in there somewhere, and his is brought to surface by an actress named Lizzy Barry. She is far from a beauty, but, ironically, in this woman it is not her physical attractiveness that wins Wilmot's heart; it is her fiery personality, her independent spirit, and perhaps even her unwillingness to be taken in by Wilmot's charms.If there is any measure of an awakening in the character of Wilmot, it is squashed by his self-destruction, finally appearing in the form of syphillis, leaving him horribly disfigured and crippled. Depp plays brilliantly a scene in which Wilmot seems to wish to make things right with the King, although even in this he is self-serving, seeking only his own redemption.A stunning, if at times deeply disturbing, movie. Not for those who are easily offended, although if any storyline proves what one sows, one reaps, surely this one does. It is worthwhile if only to witness one of Depp's most remarkable performances to date.",5,"The Sowing, The Reaping",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2726,"['new', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'film', 'main', 'lead', 'secondary', 'role', 'even', 'somehow', 'become', 'main', 'attraction', 'am', 'ever', 'more', 'impressed', 'actor', 'astounding', 'range', 'creativity', 'willingness', 'take', 'most', 'challenging', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'downright', 'undesirable', 'parts', 'then', 'making', 'so', 'roles', 'making', 'one', 'uniquely', 'own', 'earned', 'respect.The', 'Libertine', 'Depp', 'playing', 'part', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'Earl', 'Rochester', '17th', 'century', 'England', 'life', 'psyche', 'man', 'who', 'devoted', 'debauchery', 'was', 'not', 'ashamed', 'Indeed', 'seemingly', 'thrived', 'own', 'dark', 'reputation', 'relishing', 'sensation', 'word', 'play', 'intended', 'movie', 'directed', 'Laurence', 'Dunmore', 'dark', 'screen', 'Depp', 'John', 'Wilmot', 'emerging', 'momentarily', 'shadows', 'announce', 'viewers', 'kind', 'stunning', 'intimacy', 'will', 'not', 'gentlemen', 'will', 'be', 'envious', 'ladies', 'will', 'be', 'repelled', 'least', 'speaking', 'ladies', 'may', 'right', 'Wilmot', 'ultimate', 'con-artist', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'hearts', 'women', 'pleasure', 'then', 'once', 'gotten', 'women', 'exist', 'only', 'provide', 'sensual', 'pleasures.To', 'live', 'life', 'however', 'century', 'man', 'effort', 'deny', 'own', 'greater', 'humanity', 'depression', 'Wilmot', 'exception', 'When', ""n't"", 'doing', 'act', 'finding', 'bottle', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'writing', 'talent', 'hired', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'produce', 'theatre', 'gain', 'popularity', 'King.Even', 'libertine', 'such', 'Wilmot', 'however', 'heart', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'brought', 'surface', 'actress', 'named', 'Lizzy', 'Barry', 'far', 'beauty', 'ironically', 'woman', 'not', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'Wilmot', 'heart', 'fiery', 'personality', 'independent', 'spirit', 'perhaps', 'even', 'unwillingness', 'be', 'taken', 'Wilmot', 'charms.If', 'measure', 'awakening', 'character', 'Wilmot', 'squashed', 'self-destruction', 'finally', 'appearing', 'form', 'syphillis', 'leaving', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'crippled', 'Depp', 'brilliantly', 'scene', 'Wilmot', 'wish', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'King', 'even', 'self-serving', 'seeking', 'only', 'own', 'redemption.A', 'stunning', 'times', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'Not', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'storyline', 'what', 'one', 'one', 'reaps', 'surely', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'only', 'witness', 'one', 'Depp', 'most', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'date']",N/A

Cold, dark, foggy. For a movie to do that it is well delivered. The musical score ran thru my head the entire next day also.I would have liked more on the actual history of Wilmot ie, his military background, family history etc. But will take the story as delivered.Depp was great.
