I love Dragon Ball Z. but theirs something i have to address and that's the very fact that this movie has a time paradox. here are the examples. watching this movie due to gohan's appearance and a few other indicators that this movie takes place before planet namek and the battle with frieza because turles even states that ""with the tree of might he will be even more powerful than frieza"" present tense frieza is still alive. so if this is the case and Goku knows both the spirit bomb and kei-o-ken which he learned before coming back from the dead to fight vegeta while Piccolo, Chiaotzu, Tien and Yamcha were all dead then why are they in this movie? its like the writer wasn't keeping the movie in the same universe as DBZ but thats debunked because ""The Dead Zone"" was apart of the DBZ universe since theirs an arch in the show about Garlic Jr. returning from the dead zone. the reason this problem has pushed the movie so far back for me is because its false information like it never even happened in the DBZ universe and having to think about this every time i watch this that one huge problem sticks out detracting from enjoyment.",2,Time Paradox. seriously!,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,1183,"['rating', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'love', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z.', 'something', 'i', 'have', 'address', 'very', 'fact', 'movie', 'time', 'paradox', 'here', 'are', 'examples', 'watching', 'movie', 'due', 'gohan', 'appearance', 'few', 'other', 'indicators', 'movie', 'place', 'planet', 'namek', 'battle', 'frieza', 'turles', 'even', 'tree', 'might', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'frieza', 'present', 'tense', 'frieza', 'still', 'alive', 'so', 'case', 'Goku', 'spirit', 'bomb', 'kei-o-ken', 'learned', 'coming', 'back', 'dead', 'fight', 'vegeta', 'Piccolo', 'Chiaotzu', 'Tien', 'Yamcha', 'were', 'dead', 'then', 'why', 'are', 'movie', 'writer', 'was', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'movie', 'same', 'universe', 'DBZ', 'thats', 'debunked', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'was', 'apart', 'DBZ', 'universe', 'arch', 'show', 'Garlic', 'Jr.', 'returning', 'dead', 'zone', 'reason', 'problem', 'pushed', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'back', 'false', 'information', 'never', 'even', 'happened', 'DBZ', 'universe', 'having', 'think', 'time', 'i', 'watch', 'one', 'huge', 'problem', 'sticks', 'out', 'detracting', 'enjoyment']",N/A
