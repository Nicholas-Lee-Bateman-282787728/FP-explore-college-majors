941535,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000BF0DFQ,Happy Reader,"[3, 3]","This is Set Four out of six total Collection Sets. Set 4 has six ""Inspector Morse"" episodes. The first three first aired as the last episodes, in the same order, in BBC Series 5. (The BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) The last three episodes are the beginning of BBC Series 6.[Note: You don't want to confuse the six ""Collection Sets"" with a newer run of ""Inspector Morse"" DVD's, called simply ""Sets"". There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. Each ""Set"" has only three episodes on three discs.]Episodes:Who Killed Harry Field - first aired March 1991Greeks Bearing Gifts - aired March 1991Promised Land - aired March 1991Dead on Time - aired February 1992Happy Families - aired March 1992The Death of the Self - aired March 1992WHO KILLED HARRY FIELD?:Harry Field is in his commodious studio, surrounded by paintings finished and unfinished, starting his second bottle of booze. Someone calls, but doesn't leave a message. Someone drives up, but leaves without knocking. We find, after a couple scenes, that good old Harry irritates a lot of people.A few days later, Morse and Lewis are called to the scene near a bridge. It's the body of a man with no identification, but paint under his nails. When they figure out it's Harry, Morse and Lewis visit the studio. Morse is contemplative, maybe because he's been having trouble sleeping: ""Here we are again, Lewis. Putting together the last moments of a complete stranger's life. Showing more concern for him than we would when he was alive.""The next day, in one of my favorite scenes ever, Lewis gets into the office to find Morse positively chirpy. He's holding heraldry plaques and plans from Harry's studio. Morse laughs, ""I think I might have got on with Harry Field!"" He reads from a plaque,"" 'Ventosa Vere Restabit'. That's translated by Harry for a Mr. and Mrs. Parker of Ohio as 'Springtime brings respite from wintery storms.' Of course, in Latin, the letter V is pronounced W. Therefore this motto would read 'When toes are weary, rest a bit.'"" And Morse GIGGLES! He explains to a puzzled Lewis, ""He was making it up! Joke genealogy. Heraldry. Seems Harry had a sideline.""Then they find out that Harry had a dark side, too.Trivia: This episode was written by Geoffry Case, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Excellent acting, including Geraldine James as Harry's wife, Helen. It's in this episode that Lewis first broaches the subject of trying for a promotion.GREEKS BEARING GIFTS:Young Nicos Capparis is expecting a guest in his 2nd floor flat. He speaks Greek with the 1st floor tenants, the elderly Papas', as he lets in his guest, but they don't really see who's going up the stairs with him. Too bad, because that same someone, wearing black leather gloves, strangles Nicos and slips out unseen.In the meanwhile, Sergeant Lewis and his wife Valerie are trying to have dinner at the Greek restaurant, The Acropolis. Service is incredibly slow, and Lewis finds out why. Nicos was the chef.One of the snapshots in the murdered man's living room is of Nicos' sister, Maria, and her new baby. Another photo is of an ancient sailing ship. Morse and Lewis follow up on both of those. It turns out that the ship is a best-guess reproduction of a B.C.E. trireme, built as a co-operative venture between England and Greece. And in tracking it down, Morse encounters a ""marriage made in heaven"". Or is it?Trivia: This episode was written by Peter Nichols, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This is the only Inspector Morse episode where Lewis's wife has lines: She has been taking Greek language lessons, and practices by ordering for Lewis and herself at The Acropolis.I am fond of this episode due to my nerdy interest in ancient history. I remember newspaper and magazine articles about the real-life trireme reproduction, used to carry the Olympic torch-bearer on one leg to Athens for the 2004 Summer Olympics. As is briefly explained in the Morse episode, nobody was really sure how a trireme worked, as it's only mentioned/shown in a few extant writings, carvings, and pottery illustrations, though it was probably the most common, powerful and maneuverable warship of the 500 B.C.E's. I recommend the extensive entry for ""trireme"" in wikipedia for further detail.PROMISED LAND:We start out watching people show up for Pete Matthew's funeral. But why are men with walkie-talkies and cameras hiding behind gravestones? And among them are Chief Inspector Morse and Chief Superintendent Strange! Strange is worried. Pete died in prison of AIDS, after being fingered by Kenny Stone as the get-away driver in a robbery that ended with a policeman killed. New evidence has come up indicating Pete was NOT the driver. Pete was convicted solely on Kenny's evidence, so Morse needs to meet with Kenny for ""clarification"" of his testimony. Kenny and his wife, Anne, have been set up in Australia as Mike and Anne Harding, under the witness protection program. Morse insists Lewis has to accompany him to Hereford, New South Wales, Australia, because ""I can't carry my own bags, can I?""Something is up in Hereford, though. Anne's mother has been scared into a stroke or heart attack, nobody's seen Kenny/Mike for days, and then their teenage daughter, Karen, is kidnapped. It looks like their cover has been blown. Tension mounts to an poignant end, with Morse reeling under guilt.Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This is one of only two ""Inspector Morse"" episodes that has scenes filmed outside of England.DEAD ON TIME:A repairman is fixing the phone wiring in a fine house. When he's done, Henry Fallon, confined to a wheelchair, calls his wife Susan, to tell her the phones are working now. Next, we see him dead from a bullet to the head, an apparent suicide at his desk, discovered by his son-in-law, Peter Rhodes. When Morse enters the room, he sees a photo of Henry's wife, Susan, on the desk, and he goes very very still.It is apparent that Morse and Susan knew each other. And it must have been serious. At first, she is concerned with not giving the totally disconcerted Morse false hope. She tells him, ""When Henry's things get sorted out, I shall be going away from here. I think you should know that."" Just how she does that will break Morse's heart a second time. But before then, she does have dinner with him at his house. And more than dinner?But here are Morse's questions: Was Henry's death a suicide? And was the death of Peter's wife, who was Henry and Susan's daughter, an accident?Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. In this episode, we really get a look at Morse the man, not Morse the police officer. And with the sad ending, Lewis really has his back.In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Joanna David, who plays Susan Fallon, talks about Susan's dinner at Morse's house. ""There's a commercial break just at the crucial moment, so that the world watching it will be able to form their own opinion, whether they did or whether they didn't ""do it"", as it were. You asked me what I thought. Well, I think that they DID."" The next morning, at the station, Morse does have an uncharacteristic peaceful happiness about him.HAPPY FAMILIES:It's Lady Emily Blacombe's birthday. Her friends and family are singing ""Happy Birthday"", but nobody, including Emily, looks the least bit happy. Her friend, Margaret Cliff, says, ""Everyone you love is here."" Emily cries, ""Not everyone"", which is greeted by rolling eyes and worse by her husband and sons.And what a husband and sons. Sir John is head of Curzon Engineering, one of the largest in England, and he got there by marrying the boss' daughter in exchange for his impoverished title. The sons, Harry and James, work with their father and live at home, spoiled rotten. They can't wait to leave the birthday party, Sir John calling a conference with his sons. Harry has discovered James doing something fraudulent with the company, and he is furious that their father wants to cover it up.The next we see, Sir John is dead, his head bashed in, lying on the kitchen pantry floor. This is a very high-profile case. To make the pressure worse, a pushy reporter has decided to report the case through Morse. The first story appears benign, ""Gentleman Cop Hunts Top Man's Killer"", but it gets nasty from there. To the viewers' and Morse's dismay, Morse actually starts to worry about what the newspapers will say.Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.DEATH OF THE SELF:A group of people stand around a fire, a beautiful Italian mansion in the background. As in a ritual, each person throws something on the fire, ending his/her comment with, ""I burn the past."" One of them is opera soprano Nichole Burgess, expatriate Brit living in Italy, who hasn't been seen in concert for years due to a breakdown. She throws a shawl on the fire, saying, ""No more uncertainty, no more fear. I burn the past."" The group leader, Russell Clark, sends everyone to walk in the woods, reflecting on their new freedom. One of the participants is an English novelist, May Lawrence, who, unfortunately, manages to skewer herself on a tree spike.Back in England, at the Oxford inquest, May's husband acts and responds very oddly, including skipping the country back to Italy without completing the inquest. Given the husband's garbled talk of being pressured to do something and how sorry he is, the coroner demands a follow-up. Morse and Lewis head to Vicenza, Italy. Morse has a particular glint in his eye at the thought of meeting Russell Clark again. Clark was a con man extraordinaire when Morse put him away for three years for fraud.The Italian police are sure May's death was an accident, and resent Morse and Lewis poking around. It's not just the death. Morse cannot believe that Russell has gone straight. Fleecing rich people with psychobabble gobbledy-goop doesn't have the high stakes a man like Russell craves. And Morse gets to meet Nichole, whose recordings he owns. Can Russell do one good thing, and get her back on the stage?Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This is the 2nd of the only two episodes of ""Inspector Morse"" that were filmed outside of England. Russell Clark is played by Michael Kitchen, proving he can play sly and sinister as well as an honest copper. I highly recommend him inFoyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day, another extraordinary mystery series.Frances Barber plays Nichole Burgess, with Janis Kelly dubbing the opera singing. In an intimate night-club setting, Burgess sings as Gilda, from Verdi's opera ""Rigoletto"". The opera at the end of the episode is Puccini's ""Turandot"", with Burgess in the role of the slave girl, Liu. They shot it at the Roman amphitheater in Verona, now used now as an outdoor opera house,In ""The Story of Morse"" a 50 minute documentary special, Frances Barber talks about the final scene from ""Turandot"". They filmed Frances actually singing the opera with her own voice. In the audience, the entranced Morse watches Nichole Burgess' big comeback, with tears in his eyes. Frances laughs about the memory. Her opera singing was very bad, and John Thaw teased her mercilessly that it was her singing that actually made him cry.",5,Episode Synopsis of Convoluted Intelligent Episodes!
