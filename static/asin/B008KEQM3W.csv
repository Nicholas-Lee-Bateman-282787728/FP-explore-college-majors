1569111,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008KEQM3W,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 12]","I'm not sure that I was expecting a good movie, since this looked so bland and stupid in the trailer, but then again my wife thought it was hilarious when she went to see it in the theaters with her girlfriends and so I gave it a shot.  There came a point where I decided I was only finishing it so that I could write a nasty review about it; it's that bad.My issue with movies like this is that they come across so un-genuine that they lose any and all credibility.  The actors are all atrocious, with not one performance feeling inspired or even remotely authentic and the jokes are a tired list of regurgitated scenarios and one liners that don't hit but maybe once every thirty minutes.  This hodgepodge of baby-related storylines is borderline insulting in the overboard, nonsensical way it paints parenthood and the pursuit of.  And please, I beg of you, stop casting Chris Rock in movies.  Whoever convinced you that it was a good idea should be fired.  He's not funny anymore.  His humor hasn't changed since the late 90's and he is no longer relevant.  Forget about him.To spell out the different storylines would take all day, since there are too many of them and they are all sort of carbon copies of each other with fragments of difference to give them seeming life, but basically you have five couples with baby on the brain.  Two couples have an accidental pregnancy, two couples are competing throughout their pregnancy and one couple has to adopt.  The acting is what ruins a lot of this, with Matthew Morrison mugging his way through every line (why is he always trying to be `warm' and `seductive' to the point where he's creepy?), Quaid falling on his face and the entire list of female performers hamming it up in a way that insults their talent.  Oh yeah, and Chris Rock being Chris Rock, complete with outdated rap music to accompany his entrance.  But it's not only the actors.  The writing is pathetic.  The jokes are expected and the development of character is a mess.  Also, miscarriages are not funny so don't put them in a comedy.At the end of the day, I hated this.  It tries to throw way too many ideas out there that it becomes a muddled mess with barely a sliver of anything to tell the storylines apart, other than different faces doing the yelling.  Parenthood is a beautiful thing.  It isn't always easy, and pregnancy sure isn't a cakewalk (the wife's been pregnant three times, all different with their unique set of difficulties) and yet something about `What to Expect When You're Expecting' feels so false and one-note.",1,Not sure what I was expecting...,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2560,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'expecting', 'good', 'movie', 'looked', 'so', 'bland', 'stupid', 'trailer', 'then', 'again', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'theaters', 'girlfriends', 'so', 'gave', 'shot', 'came', 'point', 'where', 'decided', 'was', 'only', 'finishing', 'could', 'write', 'nasty', 'review', 'bad.My', 'issue', 'movies', 'come', 'so', 'un-genuine', 'lose', 'credibility', 'actors', 'are', 'atrocious', 'not', 'one', 'performance', 'feeling', 'inspired', 'even', 'remotely', 'authentic', 'jokes', 'are', 'tired', 'list', 'regurgitated', 'scenarios', 'one', 'liners', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'maybe', 'once', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'hodgepodge', 'baby-related', 'storylines', 'borderline', 'insulting', 'overboard', 'nonsensical', 'way', 'parenthood', 'pursuit', 'please', 'beg', 'stop', 'casting', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'movies', 'Whoever', 'convinced', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'fired', 'not', 'funny', 'anymore', 'humor', ""n't"", 'changed', 'late', '90', 'no', 'longer', 'relevant', 'Forget', 'him.To', 'spell', 'different', 'storylines', 'would', 'take', 'day', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'sort', 'carbon', 'copies', 'other', 'fragments', 'difference', 'give', 'seeming', 'life', 'basically', 'have', 'five', 'couples', 'baby', 'brain', 'Two', 'couples', 'have', 'accidental', 'pregnancy', 'two', 'couples', 'are', 'competing', 'pregnancy', 'one', 'couple', 'adopt', 'acting', 'what', 'lot', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'mugging', 'way', 'line', 'why', 'always', 'trying', 'be', 'warm', 'seductive', 'point', 'where', 'creepy', 'Quaid', 'falling', 'face', 'entire', 'list', 'female', 'performers', 'hamming', 'up', 'way', 'insults', 'talent', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'being', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'complete', 'outdated', 'rap', 'music', 'accompany', 'entrance', 'not', 'only', 'actors', 'writing', 'pathetic', 'jokes', 'are', 'expected', 'development', 'character', 'mess', 'Also', 'miscarriages', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'comedy.At', 'end', 'day', 'hated', 'throw', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'ideas', 'out', 'there', 'muddled', 'mess', 'barely', 'sliver', 'anything', 'tell', 'storylines', 'apart', 'other', 'different', 'doing', 'yelling', 'Parenthood', 'beautiful', 'thing', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'pregnancy', 'sure', ""n't"", 'cakewalk', 'wife', 'been', 'pregnant', 'three', 'times', 'different', 'unique', 'set', 'difficulties', 'yet', 'something', 'What', 'Expect', 'When', ""'re"", 'Expecting', 'feels', 'false', 'one-note']",N/A

Is there no place for movies that adopt this sort of plot style? Are such movies inherently bad? I think the movie did a fantastic job of developing each couple's situation, portraying a wide variety of issues that families face, and very touchingly deals with very emotional issues like miscarriage and problems with C-sections. To my mind, everyone's acting is really good, and criticism of this movie is a perfect example of the social pressure for critics not to like everything, and to start disliking what they've heard others criticizing. The movie conveys numerous important messages well, portrays people's emotional struggles well, and keeps overall a positive atmosphere that brings relationships to what seem like realistic reconciliations.I took off a star, though, for the movie's reliance upon wealth to make everything remain positive. Jennifer Lopez' character's situation, and the situation of the food-truck couple, are insufficiently differentiated from those of the TV and racing stars and their families. How are they getting healthcare? How are the former going to save for college or retirement, something Chris Rock's character jokes about but the gravity of which is insufficiently conveyed for other characters?

The reason I docked points is because when movies have a surplus of characters that they jump around to, it's hard to care about them as much. And the story line becomes slightly chaotic. Like 'Valentines Day', that movie sucked. But this one did much better than that movie switching stories yet linking all the people, as well as making you care about them- at least to a degree. Heck, I must have cared because I even had a few tears at a couple parts. There were a few lol moments. Like when the daddies come on screen to 'bad a' music with their strollers and expressions.

Also, they did a good job at showing different baby experiences. Kudos for that.

It does a good job demonstrating that the Hollywood, romanticized notion of a ""perfect pregnancy"" is possible but only one of several possibilities. Some women will breeze through their 9 months and come out the other end no worse for the wear. For this movie, Brooklyn Decker sneezed and her baby came out. If only all labors were this easy! Elizabeth Banks had a much rougher time, experiencing all of the negatives associated with childbearing.There was also the nontraditional version of a couple deciding to adopt. It was nice they provided some variety, but I was thinking they could have just as easily used a gay or lesbian couple to fill these roles. Perhaps the creators feared some sort of backlash, but it would have been a good place for its use and not changed the story one iota.If you go into this movie hoping for tips on dealing with your pregnancy, good luck. This was more of a reflection on pregnancies in general and the gambit of experiences for these couples.

1569219,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B008KEQM3W,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","What to Expect when you're Expecting hits a home run from the title on.  Like Sex and the Single Girl in the 1960s, Hollywood can't resist a self help book of any kind--that's nearly all they read there--so they buy the rights to the title and then invent a plot or narrative to give moviegoers perhaps more of a treat.  Woody Allen made Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) into a sort of Laugh-In of brief sight gags and sketches.  Even Mean Girls started out as a self=help book.  So, it's a whole genre filled with built-in history.  We speculated that the screenwriters of Expecting originally envisioned the whole movie initially as the full length story of Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison's characters, a reality TV trainer and a professional dancer, but actually as the movie wore on I got to dislike it every time they showed up with their story about whether or not their son should get circumcized.  Mr. Shoe wanted it, but Cameron Diaz no way.  It was a story that never made sense, well maybe it made sense but it is executed as though it were a heavy issue, like the passion of Christ in an Ingmar Bergman film.  Anyhow, Mr. Shoe had enough scenes so he must have felt like he was still playing Shue in the old days when he was married to that deceptive lying wife of his on Glee.We did notice a lot of gay leading men in this movie!  Most of them were able to play heterosexuals more or less adequately.  Maybe when the Cameron Diaz plot was getting too grim, producers thought they might as well have a second string to their bow and they asked Elizabeth Banks to come on and play a gorgeous woman with a schlubby dentist husband (Ben Falcone).  She is a heavily conflicted character, just like Cameron Diaz, and maybe the only reason why her story is a little lighter than Cameron Diaz' is that it's not a  debate about circumcision.  She is the daughter in law of elderly Dennis Quaid, a wealthy and famous race car driver with more money than sense.  Quaid himself is about to have twins with his young wife, played by model Brooklyn Decker.  The joke is that Banks, carrying only one child and heavily invested in the myth that pregnancy is a sacred state of being, looks infinitely heavier and more bedraggled than the one having twins who wears six inch heels and is still horny for Dennis Quaid.  Banks is an especially good actress, but I found Ben Falcone trying, like if you really wished for a new, chubby version of Hank Azaria really hard every night and made sacrifices to Pan, you might open your front door one day and there Ben Falcone would stand with a bacon wrapped hot dog in each hand.Those who read my reviews will already know my next sentence, which would have been something to the effect of, ""Despite her reputation as a bad or indifferent actress, Jennifer Lopez delivers the best performance in the movie.""  I say this every time around, but it never stops offending some people who can't see the forest (Ethel Barrymore-like greatness as an actress) for the trees (her image and her allegedly awful personality).  But there you go.  Paired not so much with Rodrigo Santoro as her selfish husband as with Wendi McClendon Covey as Kara, her boss at the aquarium.  Do I believe Jennifer Lopez as a struggling photographer?  She is one who makes tangible the drive people have to photograph others and dolphins.  Very much so, and her trip to Ethiopia, while not really fitting in with the rest of the movie, should have been an IMAX travelogue all by itself.  It is more stirring than, what was that movie with Klaus Kinski pulling an opera house over a mountain with vines and native labor?Let's see, who else--Chace Crawford and Anna Kendrick.  I'm looking at that name ""Chace Crawford"" and wondering what part of it I got wrong because it just looks wrong.  As a pair of food truck entrepreneurs who once tried dating in high school, the two try to act serious but the gravity of the situation seems beyond either of them.

But most of their lines feel almost tele-prompted, because the dialogue is written in such a fake-feeling voice. I think part of the problem is that it's very cliche - it's like someone made a checklist of every theme you want to hit in a pregnancy-themed movie and made sure each one got into the script. Crazy hormones, check. Husband sympathetic weight-gain, check. Hemorrhoids, check. Doubtful father, check. Then they add in a men's club starring Chris Rock - I guess to appeal to the guy demographic - and completely waste his comedic talent on stiff dialogue.There is some cute stuff with Cameron Diaz's character, who is a TV weight-loss coach (ala The Biggest Loser type thing) and meets her partner on a Dancing With the Stars copycat show.

Lo and Jennifer Aniston always seem to be playing the same role over and over again with just different backdrops and scenarios. However, What to Expect When You're Expecting (WTEWYE) is a boring movie, about boring people having to make boring decisions. Some audiences have argued that for parents or soon-to-be-parents this was exciting and interesting and relatable. I guess being pregnant or a parent must be really boring then, because that's exactly what this movie was: a star studded cast of lollipops trapped in a borefest without any substance.All the actors are severely underutilized because let's face it, it is impossible to squeeze in character development and plot of 12 couples into something under 2 hours. Most of the women don't even look pregnant, they look like they were holding a basket ball under their shirts.Watching this movie would be like being the fly on your next door neighbor's wall who are expecting a baby. It is as exciting and intriguing.  Nothing but a bunch of mundane, every-day, seriously boring plot lines - and I am using the term ""plot"" loosely, as clearly this movie doesn't even have a plot -  with ""characters"" that are uninspiring and boring. Really, come to think of it, I think this is one of the most boring movies I have seen and I have a high boredom tolerance.This movie was made to sell by employing a bunch of A lister hotties and pretty boys.

I think they have a placeholder or boilerplate for this type of movie in Hollywood and every now and then they take out the script, dust if off, make it conform to contemporary culture, cast with a horde of A- listers and hit go.Just replace every character there with someone like Jennifer Aniston, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, a couple of hunky, up-and-coming Hollywood hunks like Liam Hemsworth, or Chris Pine or a main cast from a prime time TV shows like Andrew Lincoln or something and it would be the exact same movie.

With an attractive group of actors, some of which have been very good, I was looking for a little light hearted comedy.  The story involves 4 couples trying to have a baby, another who wasn't and another foursome that has already done it.  Some know each other, some don't but eventually cross paths at some point.For the been-there-done-that group, it is dominated by 4 men who have been relegated to regular walks in the park with their brood.  I think the biggest laugh I got from the movie was when the men come marching down the sidewalk, four abreast in their pimped out strollers (complete with portable fans).  In slow motion of course.  Chris Rock as Vic is the defacto leader of the group and gets most of the good lines.Other couplings include Brooklyn Decker and Dennis Quaid (a former NASCAR champion).  His character is also the father of Ben Falcone's character who is married to Wendy (Elizabeth Banks).  None of those couplings make any sense.  Banks actually is pretty good as the champion of breast feeding and manages to get a few laughs.  The other pairs are Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison (yawn) and Rodrigo Santoro (a Mark Anthony look-a-like) and Jennifer Lopez.  Then there is Chace Crawford and Anna Kendrick who aren't really together and certainly aren't looking to get preggers.The biggest issue with the film is that it works just like every other romcom you can think of coming out of Hollywood.  You can guess the punch lines and certainly the outcomes.  There are too many characters and the comedy is hit or miss.  Mostly misses.

It's the hilarious comedy that follows five couples on their way to becoming parents. It features the wonderful talent of Chris Rock, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks and many other A-listers.I laughed through this whole movie! The comedy is on point and hilarious and the acting is fantastic. I love that it is from the perspective of many different couples who have different stories and views on what they are going through.My favorite character is Wendy, played by Elizabeth banks, because she has such an organized plan of how her pregnancy and labor will go but she ends up having an extremely difficult pregnancy. She tries to pull herself together, but she falls apart and it is hilarious.My favorite scene is actually when Wendy has her breaking point. It's so funny! I also love that they have the dad's club in this movie because it shows the wacky perspective of a father on parenting and all of the dad scenes made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt.I suggest this movie for ages 13 and up because of mature content and language.

And if there is anyone out there who truly believed that Ben Falcone was the son of Dennis Quaid,raise your hands.I thought so,not one.The film is totally uneven,jumping from one story to another.And all the couples of course have to have some discourse running through their relationships.The discourse,of course,will take time to resolve,but in the end all will be well,and it is.And in between it all,let's play up the moronic and dysfunctional relationship of all the Central Park fathers and make it look like it is all really funny.Oh yes,and don't forget,let's really show how extreme the pregnancies can be,but make sure they are not what the audience would expect from each of them.That will give it more punch and hilarity.This is like Hollywood 101 here,but done sooo poorly.I could do a paper on this subject,but the lack of REAL and funny humour,and what passes for so-called humour,in movies these past few years.Jokes are so shallow and real gags are becoming non existent.""Humour these days seems to have been written by a bunch of frat boys high on something or drunk on anything.I don't know who is worse;the ones who write this tripe or the ones who are putting it in their movies THINKING it is funny.This movie,as do many others of their ilk,stand as anathema to what true humour is all about.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes and the trailer.All in all a very big disappointment,involving a good cast with so very little to work with.The majority of the"" humour"" falls flat and the pace and unevenness of it has the film working against itself every second that ticks by.",2,What can you expect?,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,3311,"['What', 'expect-when', ""'re"",

But the entire movie seemed over blown and somewhat cartoony, so it wasn't so bad.The dad Dudes cracked me up. I'm pretty sure most men are as bad at taking care of their kids as these guys. But the Chris Rock character is a hoot. His oldest kid dragging a dead cat out of a bush gave me a good laugh out loud.

Baby-crazy author and advocate Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) gets a taste of her own militant-mom advice when pregnancy hormones ravage her body, while her husband, Gary ( Ben Falcone), struggles not to be outdone by his competitive alpha-Dad (Dennis Quaid), who is expecting twins with his much younger trophy wife, Skyler (Brooklyn Decker).Photographer Holly (Jennifer Lopez) is prepared to travel the globe to adopt a child, but her husband, Alex (Rodrigo Santoro), isn't so sure, and tries to ease his panic by attending a ""dudes"" support group, where new fathers get to tell it like it really is.  And rival food truck chefs Rosie (Anna Kendrtick) and Marco's (Chance Crawford) surprise hook-up results in an unexpected quandary.Though each of the characters has a good scene of two, there are far too many charascters to contend with.

You talk to people who've been there. Expert or not, they'll have advice you can actually relate to.In the beginning of the film, we're introduced to a cast of characters too numerous to list. Among them, however, are Holly and Alex (played by Jennifer Lopez and Rodrigo Santoro) who are beginning the arduous task of adopting a child from abroad after experiencing great difficulty conceiving. Also, we're shown the final episode of a Dancing with the Stars type of show and as one of the winning contestants, Jules (played by Cameron Diaz) becomes nauseous and throws up which, in this film anyway, can only mean one thing. Holly (Lopez) is concerned that, even with the wait they have ahead of them, Alex (Santoro) won't be ready for the challenges of parenting and isn't excited about the prospect. To help him, she sets him up with The Dudes Group, men with children and pregnant wives who tell the truth, offer advice, and commiserate. One of the founding principles of the group is that they do not tell wives or girlfriends what takes place during group meetings. Another, told to us by Gabe, a man who has children already is that they don't pass judgment. Even as one child, who's father is played by Chris Rock, welcomes Alex to the group by hitting him with a stick and seems to find an accident around every corner.Now, even as someone who's never been expecting, the book of the same name was something I'd heard of before and as a result I would've known what this movie was about even without seeing the trailer. And, as was the case with He's Just Not That Into You, another movie based on an eponymous self-help book, there isn't much to see here. The characters themselves are exaggerated and the connections between them strain credibility and imagination. It isn't offensive, though I might feel differently if I had or was going to have children, but it isn't that entertaining either. There are some cheap laughs and shallow dramatic moments, but nothing that funny or insightful. If you are about to have children, skip the movie, read the book.

I found Elizabeth Banks character pretty funny, especially with how miserable she felt during her pregnancy.  Her completely losing it was pretty good.  Overall it wasn&#8217;t a great movie, but it was worth watching.  I recommend anyone who enjoys a good comedy with female leads to check it out.T.S.
