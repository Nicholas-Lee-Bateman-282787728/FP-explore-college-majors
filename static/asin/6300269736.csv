235228,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6300269736,Andre Dursin,"[8, 9]","Kicking things off for the Warner Archive on Blu-Ray is Sidney Lumet's 1982 filming of Ira Levin's play DEATHTRAP, which was last seen on DVD in an early-format, full-screen release housed in one of the label's old ""snapper"" cases. Fans of the film have had to make do with that release for far too long, but can now dispose of it courtesy of the Archive's super 1080p BD package. By this point, Warner Home Video's catalog discs are seemingly more consistent than any other label, marked by crisp, satisfying detail and a notable lack of DNR processing. ""Deathtrap""'s only occasional flaws are a few speckles in the print; for the most part, it's pristine, and the clear DTS MA mono audio delivers the film's pungent dialogue effectively.""Deathtrap"" is an odd, twisty thriller that Jay Presson Allen adapted from Levin's play. Michael Caine is diabolical as the frustrated playwright who requests (at least it seems on first glance) the assistance of one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) after his latest work fails spectacularly; Dyan Cannon plays Caine's wife, but there's more - much more - to this story than initially meets the eye. Allen's script opens up Levin's play a bit for the screen and the ensemble plays it to a hilt under Lumet's direction, though it's hard to envision the film having much potential for repeat viewing.The disc's sole extra is the theatrical trailer; it would've been nice if some excised material, added to CBS' initial network broadcast of the picture, had been included as an extra, but fans will likely be perfectly content with seeing the picture in widescreen (never mind HD!) at last.",3,A Solid Blu-Ray Debut for the Warner Archive,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1636,"['Kicking', 'things', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Blu-Ray', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1982', 'filming', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'play', 'DEATHTRAP', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'DVD', 'early-format', 'full-screen', 'release', 'housed', 'one', 'label', 'old', 'snapper', 'cases', 'Fans', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'release', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'can', 'now', 'dispose', 'courtesy', 'Archive', 'super', '1080p', 'BD', 'package', 'point', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'catalog', 'discs', 'are', 'seemingly', 'more', 'consistent', 'other', 'label', 'marked', 'crisp', 'satisfying', 'detail', 'notable', 'lack', 'DNR', 'processing', 'Deathtrap', 'only', 'occasional', 'flaws', 'are', 'few', 'speckles', 'print', 'most', 'part', 'pristine', 'clear', 'DTS', 'MA', 'mono', 'audio', 'film', 'pungent', 'dialogue', 'effectively', 'Deathtrap', 'odd', 'twisty', 'thriller', 'Jay', 'Presson', 'Allen', 'adapted', 'Levin', 'play', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'diabolical', 'frustrated', 'playwright', 'who', 'least', 'first', 'glance', 'assistance', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'latest', 'work', 'spectacularly', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'Caine', 'wife', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'initially', 'eye', 'Allen', 'script', 'up', 'Levin', 'play', 'bit', 'screen', 'ensemble', 'plays', 'hilt', 'Lumet', 'direction', 'hard', 'envision', 'film', 'having', 'much', 'potential', 'repeat', 'viewing.The', 'disc', 'sole', 'extra', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'excised', 'material', 'added', 'CBS', 'initial', 'network', 'broadcast', 'picture', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'extra', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'perfectly', 'content', 'seeing', 'picture', 'widescreen', 'never', 'mind', 'HD', 'last']",N/A

He takes his manuscript to the house of established playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) to get his valued opinion. Bruhl thinks that the play could be a winner but doesn't let Anderson know this as he wants to get a part of it for himself as his latest play has just flopped and been savaged by the critics. Bruhl is going through a dry patch and can't come up with any new ideas and sees &quot;Deathtrap&quot; as a way of making some big money and offers Anderson the benefit of his expertise by helping him finish the play and polish it up and they can then form a partnership. Anderson thanks Bruhl for his advice but says he prefers to keep the play himself as he had put a lot of work into it and while he appreciates Bruhl's offer of help he wants to leave the play as it is. Bruhl realises the young writer is not going to co-operate so he has to think up an alternative plan. Will he murder Anderson and then claim the play is his or will he just let him walk away? Bruhl's wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) knows her husband is desperate and is capable of murder so she does everything she can to talk him out of any criminal intentions and to let Anderson go. What happens next is totally unexpected and shock follows shock in the amazing plot twists that follow. Further complications occur when next door neighbour Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth) calls at the house as she is a psychic and is fearful that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in that house. She wanders around the room uninvited (much to the horror of the Bruhls) touching various objects and receiving vibrations which gives her clues as she puts together her thoughts and conclusions.Some favourite lines from the film:Dyan Cannon (to Michael Caine): &quot;I think that you're thinking that after last night you actually would kill to have another hit play&quot;.Caine (to Cannon): &quot;Do you know know what this play would net its author in today's market? Between 3 and 5 million dollars . . . . now if that isn't a thinking man's motive for murder I don't know what is&quot;.Caine (to Cannon): &quot;I do believe that you two thought I was going to take that mace and do a Vincent Price didn't you?&quot;.Caine (to Christopher Reeve): &quot;Here we are Clifford, uncuff yourself.

235234,A2GYX971VETQBV,6300269736,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[2, 2]","All I can say is: DEATHTRAP is a steal at this price.  When I saw it selling for less than $10, I decided to check it out.  I had heard a lot about the film and, in particular, that it held up to the likes of SLEUTH.  Of course, I was also very familiar with Sidney Lumet's work and was eager to see how he adapted this stage play for the big screen.  He has succeeded in spades.  While I personally enjoy the storyline and charm of SLEUTH more, DEATHTRAP was equally entertaining.  While many stage plays suffer when directors try to import the witty dialogue into a world of fast-moving sets and drama, Lumet decides to set back and let his actors earn their paycheck.  The entire film takes place on one set (besides a minor change that I cannot mention in any detail because it would ruin the story) and Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve deliver captivating performances.  While some commentators have faulted DEATHTRAP for its lack of scenery and on the grounds that it ""feels like a play,"" I would argue that the film actually succeeds because of these elements.  Of course it ""feels like a play.""  It is a play.  Had Lumet tried to film this murder mystery in a more ""cinematic"" way, the movie would have sacrificed the delicious dialogue and performances it has to offer.Like any good mystery play, DEATHTRAP offers an endless series of twists and turns-while some are predictable, particularly for an experienced audience, they never cease to entertain and the film manages to retain a sense of believability.

235235,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6300269736,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 3]","In the early 1980's, I saw a stage production of Ira Levin's ""Deathtrap."" It was a theatre-in-the-round presentation, with very little space between the actors and the audience. The production was truly one of the most intense and frightening theatrical experiences of my life. Director Sidney Lumet's 1982 film is a reasonably faithful adaptation of Levin's play; with a screenplay by Jay Presson Allen and production design by Tony Walton. But ""Deathtrap"" truly belongs on stage. Film, being a different medium of course, lacks the immediacy of the stage. What's missing from the film is a sense of immediate danger/terror. Thus, the overall impact of ""Deathtrap"" is considerably lessened on film. The lack of direct chills is compensated for by the two fine central performances of  Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve.Michael Caine is full of murderous menace as washed-up playwright Sidney Bruhl. Bruhl needs a hit play, badly-- and he knows his former student Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) has written a sure-fire hit thriller. Dyan Cannon is obligated to give a hysterical performance as Sidney's clueless wife Myra. She screams hysterically and she laughs hysterically. Cannon should not be faulted. It's essential  the audience knows Myra is a nervous, easily frightened type. Because, without giving too much away, the plot that initially unfolds turns out to be a plot by Sidney and Clifford to scare Myra literally to death. Irene Worth is also featured in the cast as Helga Ten Dorp, the psychic next door. But the film depends on the chemistry between Caine and Reeve. Christopher Reeve, who more than holds his own opposite Caine,  convincingly plays against type as Clifford, the gay, arrogant, sociopathic student playwright who would just as soon kill Sidney as kiss him.",3,"FILM VERSION OF ""DEATHTRAP"" LESS FRIGHTENING THAN STAGE VERSION",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1797,"['early', '1980', 'saw', 'stage', 'production', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'Deathtrap', 'was', 'theatre-in-the-round', 'presentation', 'very', 'little', 'space', 'actors', 'audience', 'production', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'frightening', 'theatrical', 'experiences', 'life', 'Director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1982', 'film', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Levin', 'play', 'screenplay', 'Jay', 'Presson', 'Allen', 'production', 'design', 'Tony', 'Walton', 'Deathtrap', 'truly', 'stage', 'Film', 'being', 'different', 'medium', 'course', 'immediacy', 'stage', 'What', 'missing', 'film', 'sense', 'immediate', 'danger/terror', 'Thus', 'overall', 'impact', 'Deathtrap', 'considerably', 'lessened', 'film', 'lack', 'direct', 'chills', 'compensated', 'two', 'fine', 'central', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Christopher', 'Reeve.Michael', 'Caine', 'full', 'murderous', 'menace', 'washed-up', 'playwright', 'Sidney', 'Bruhl', 'Bruhl', 'hit', 'play', 'badly', 'former', 'student', 'Clifford', 'Anderson', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'written', 'sure-fire', 'hit', 'thriller', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'obligated', 'give', 'hysterical', 'performance', 'Sidney', 'clueless', 'wife', 'Myra', 'screams', 'hysterically', 'hysterically', 'Cannon', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'essential', 'audience', 'Myra', 'nervous', 'easily', 'frightened', 'type', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'plot', 'initially', 'out', 'be', 'plot', 'Sidney', 'Clifford', 'scare', 'Myra', 'literally', 'death', 'Irene', 'Worth', 'also', 'featured', 'cast', 'Helga', 'Ten', 'Dorp', 'psychic', 'next', 'door', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Caine', 'Reeve', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'who', 'more', 'own', 'opposite', 'Caine', 'convincingly', 'type', 'Clifford', 'gay', 'arrogant', 'sociopathic', 'student', 'playwright', 'who', 'would', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'kill', 'Sidney', 'kiss']",N/A

It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who authored such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and under Sidney Lumet's direction it translates to the screen extremely well.DEATHTRAP is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss, for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous.  But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery plays, but these days he seems to have lost his touch.  After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a play he has written.  It is called &quot;Deathtrap,&quot; and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit.  Just the sort of hit that would revive his career... indeed, a hit to die for.  And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible.Like Anthony Shaffer's equally twisty SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen--to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers.  Still, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it makes a more-than-respectable showing on the screen.  Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine.  Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career.  If you can't see it in a first-rate theatrical production, this will more than do until one comes along.Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer the film in its original ratio--it's pan and scan here, and that's a clear strike against the DVD so far as I'm concerned.  And sadly, although this is an ideal subject for them, there are no bonuses of any kind.  But even so it is DEATHTRAP, and it is DEATHTRAP very expertly done, the perfect movie to curl up with on a dark and stormy night.

I finally purchased the DVD to give it another  go and came away almost as pleased.Caine gives his usual  wonderful performance as a playwright who has run out of hits and Reeve is  better than I've ever seen him, before or since, as an aspiring playwright  seeking Caine's guidance.  Cannon is irritating as Caine's wife, but she's  supposed to be, so I do not feel that her performance weakens the piece at  all.The Plot: Reeve approaches Caine with his first attempt at a  play, seeking his idol's criticism.  Caine finds the play to be incredible,  a surefire hit, and, desperate for such a hit for himself, begins scheming  (as only Michael Caine can scheme) ways to get Reeve out of the picture and  claim the play, DEATHTRAP, as his own.  From this point the picture starts  on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't let up until the end.  Fiction and  reality cross and blur again and again making for a delightfully dark  comedic thriller.My only real criticism of DEATHTRAP is its  similarity to SLEUTH, another great twisted thriller also starring Michael  Caine.  While both films on their own are incredible, fans of SLEUTH may  find DEATHTRAP a bit less satisfying - there simply aren't as many  surprises.  But this is certainly not a reason to avoid this film, as it is  a genuine treasure.The DVD has a minimum of features - no  trailer, just a chapter search selection (which is more than SLEUTH had!)  and, unfortunately, the film is presented full-screen as opposed to  widescreen.  This did not bother me as the entire film has a claustrophobic  feel to it as the action generally occurs in close quarters.  Still, if the  film was originally widescreen, I'd rather see the director's original  vision.  And speaking of direction, Lumet was marvelous as usual.  After  all, in the film itself, DEATHTRAP is described as a play &quot;so good,  even a gifted director couldn't hurt it.&quot;  And at the bargain price  this is one DVD you should snatch up right away.",4,"It's no SLEUTH, but it ain't bad...",964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,2079,"['first', 'saw', 'DEATHTRAP', 'television', 'well', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'stuck', 'ever', 'finally', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'give', 'go', 'came', 'away', 'almost', 'pleased.Caine', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'playwright', 'who', 'run', 'hits', 'Reeve', 'better', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'aspiring', 'playwright', 'seeking', 'Caine', 'guidance', 'Cannon', 'irritating', 'Caine', 'wife', 'supposed', 'be', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'performance', 'piece', 'all.The', 'Plot', 'Reeve', 'Caine', 'first', 'attempt', 'play', 'seeking', 'idol', 'criticism', 'Caine', 'play', 'be', 'incredible', 'surefire', 'hit', 'desperate', 'such', 'hit', 'scheming', 'only', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'can', 'scheme', 'ways', 'get', 'Reeve', 'picture', 'claim', 'play', 'DEATHTRAP', 'own', 'point', 'picture', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'end', 'Fiction', 'reality', 'cross', 'blur', 'again', 'again', 'making', 'delightfully', 'dark', 'comedic', 'thriller.My', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'DEATHTRAP', 'similarity', 'SLEUTH', 'great', 'twisted', 'thriller', 'also', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'films', 'own', 'are', 'incredible', 'fans', 'SLEUTH', 'may', 'find', 'DEATHTRAP', 'bit', 'less', 'satisfying', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises', 'certainly', 'not', 'reason', 'avoid', 'film', 'genuine', 'treasure.The', 'DVD', 'minimum', 'features', 'trailer', 'just', 'chapter', 'search', 'selection', 'more', 'SLEUTH', 'had', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'presented', 'full-screen', 'opposed', 'widescreen', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'entire', 'film', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'action', 'generally', 'close', 'quarters', 'Still', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'widescreen', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'director', 'original', 'vision', 'speaking', 'direction', 'Lumet', 'was', 'marvelous', 'usual', 'film', 'DEATHTRAP', 'described', 'play', 'quot', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'gifted', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'it.', 'quot', 'bargain', 'price', 'one', 'DVD', 'should', 'snatch', 'up', 'right', 'away']",N/A

In the film Michael Caine plays Sydney Bruhl, a once great playwright who is desperate for a hit yet whose mastery of suspense and characterization has sadly fallen by the wayside. After suffering another opening night stiff he falls into a deep depression, gets drunk, and finally wanders back home to his sympathetic yet ingenuous wife, Myra (a sweetly quirky Dyan Cannon). She tries to cheer him up, but the man is livid: on top of all his recent bad luck he has just received a copy of a new play by a first time writer (a student of his nontheless) named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve in one of his finest performances) who has put together a whopper of a murder mystery that Sydney knows would be an instant smash. So he decides to invite Mr. Anderson to his home, offer him a drink, make conversation, give a few pointers and suggestions about his work, then murder him, bury his body in the back yard, steal the play, and use it as his own comeback production (and no, I haven't given away any of the movie's deliciously wicked surprises).

The stagey atmosphere of Ira Levin's Broadway hit has been alleviated by director Lumet who seems to specialize in film settings that are seemingly impossible to bring to life (i.e. the Calais Coach cars where the ""MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS"" takes place) yet which he is able to fashion with a masterful touch that never seems intrusive or obtrusive to the average film goer. ""DEATHTRAP"" is equally effective and guaranteed to satisfy even the most demanding of mystery buffs. ULTIMATE LAUGH-OUT-LOUD MOMENT: not to give too much away, but I wonder how hard it was for Caine and Reeve to keep a straight face in several of their ""close up"" scenes together!
