592239,A32MCD01AP5JP5,B00005JKXE,Anthony Peak,"[0, 2]","There's a very definite crowd that will hate this movie, this rant isn't for them. Kung Pow! will most likely be loved by any loyal fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's also great for fans of Monty Python, Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura, etc. Basically, it's stupid comedy. I'm talking, /really/ stupid comedy. That's why it's so funny, and some people just won't get this.So, what's Kung Pow! all about? Well, Writer/Director/Lead Actor Steve Oedekerk basically takes an old, unknown, laughably bad 70's kung fu movie and one ups MST3K by not only making fun of it, but throwing out the dialogue and sound. They redubbed the entire thing. They digitally added several characters, including the main character, into the film. Everything is then mercilessly hacked and ducted taped together to form one hilarious story.The jokes are certainly hit and miss, but that's to be expected in this type of film. More or less, it's a great comedy with a lot of action. The story, although very fragmented, is rather entertaining as well. It does manage to keep a sense of continuality though all the random fun. The end of the film, although unusual, will be well known to any anime fan. Suffice to say it's almost like watching Kung Pow! 2 in 30 seconds. It's very entertaining.So what else do you need to know? Go rent it! Keep an eye out for WimpLo, a great MST3K style humiliated character. ""We purposely trained him /wrong/, as a joke!"" The cow scene isn't nearly as lame as it seems in the previews. The cow itself is actually quite well modeled, and animates smoothly. It's somewhere around 5x-10x the detail of the Black & White cow, if that helps anyone. Have fun, and keep the scoffing movie critics out of the room while watching.

592251,A1ART5LIGLOVZO,B00005JKXE,"Chris ""Metal Reviewer""","[1, 1]","First off, I have read all the one-star reviews and you guy's are missing the whole point of the movie. You say that the movie is bad because of the acting, well guess what, its supposed to be! Now, I do think that martial arts movies and comedy do not mix well together, which is probably why the movie ended up with such bad results, but somehow, the plot is so stupid and simple, that it makes it incredibly funny. The stupid one-star reviewers are obviously incredibly high because I guess they thought that this was supposed to be a real martial arts movie, when actually, that was just the premise. The producer chose a crappy martial arts movie, added a couple of characters and extra scenes, and turned it into a comic masterpiece. There is even a dumb f*ck on here who said and I quote, ""punching a hole through a person is incredibly unrealistic. I know it's a movie, but it overdoes it"" or something like that. Please, how many movies have been unrealistic? Just about every horror movie, alien movies, movies like the sixth sense, and pretty much any action/adventure movie. Face it, movies are practically made to be unrealistic, unless they are movies based on a true story. So to say that kung pows fighting scenes are too unrealistic is like saying that the dawn of the dead is a true story. Now aside from all the douchebag, retarded one-star reviewers, this movie has got to be one of the funniest movies ever. I have watched a lot of comedies (probably because comedy is my favorite genre of movie), and the only movie that has been funnier than this one is South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and Team America: World Police. Now let me prewarn any people reading this review, this is not a martial arts movie, so don't expect to see much of anything in this movie that you would see in a real martial arts movie. Also, if you do not like movies that poke fun at martial arts movies, don't watch this. I must give this movie a 5/5.

I spent most of the 80-something minutes laughing, so how bad could it have been..?Writer/Director Steve Oedekerk stars as ""The Chosen One"" (raised in a ditch by ""Various Rodents..), chosen for WHAT we never learn. We Do know that the mark of The Chosen One is a bizarre face that sits on the tip of his tongue, and the the evil Master Pain, A.K.A. ""Betty"", wants him dead. That's pretty much it, plot-wise. The really amazing part of the movie is this: It's an old Hong-Kong action movie, with Oedekerk digitally inserted; kind of a Zelig/What's Up Tiger Lilly?/Forrest Gump mish-mash. (Stick around for the credits and you'll see scenes from the original, and see how they put Oedekerk into the action.)The BIG problem with Kung-Pow IS Oedekerk. He looks like your next-door neighbor; not someone who should be on the big-screen. I just didn't think HE was that funny.

In particular, I've always loved the many many Wu Tang movies, many of which were completely insane but in a way that you grew to love.""Kung Pow - Enter the Fist"" is an obvious spoof of the worst of the genre, using - funnily enough - a rather serious and rather good movie, ""Tiger and Crane Fists aka Savage Killers"" - for inspiration and lifting entire scenes from that movie.  The director, writer, and star obviously knows the genre quite well and pokes fun at many of the things you would ordinarily find funny anyway while watching a typical, lesser grade wuxia film.If you know the genre, you might find this film quite clever.  Indeed, you will 'get' many of the jokes and genre nods.  However, I am not sure that the fact that you will 'get it' will make the film a winner for you.  It 'is' a clever film but it is hardly ever as funny as the real thing is.  Frankly, I would much rather watch one of the original films, badly dubbed, and laugh at that.  Which is, funnily enough, what I did once I got halfway through ""Kung Pow.""Again, that isn't to say that the film is bad -- it is funny in a very silly way, but it is hardly a winner.  There are some giggle moments but no laugh-out-loud moments for me.  Most of the humor comes from the concept itself, which gets old about 10 - 15 minutes in.  Yes, the originals were badly dubbed, the camera often panned funnily on the faces of the protagonists, the sound effects were ludicrous at times -- we get it.  But after about 10 minutes, it isn't really funny anymore and you find yourself wanting to see the originals and laugh at the often unintentionally funny segments of those movies.  Or watch ""Drunken Master,"" which has many of these conventions but is legitimately funny within the concept of the movie (and the English version 'is' badly dubbed).Could have been better.  As it is, a decent spoof.  If the wuxia classics ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"" or ""The One Armed Swordsman"" get 5 stars in my book, this one could never possibly get 5 or 4 stars.

Normally, I simply forget about the movie and move on to the next one.  But this one really irked me because I had expected it to be so much better.  The &quot;dubbing&quot; grows tired very quickly as a gag, as do the repetitive fight scenes that employ the &quot;thousand meaningless blows&quot; kung fu fighting style.  Some of the sight gags and dialogue are a bit amusing in the beginning, but I found myself waiting and waiting for the real humor to begin.

The film received some genuine laughs from me, and I wasn't being ironic or facetious.  It knows it's ridiculous and embraced itself, for which I came to accept its kung-fu oddities.  The story of The Chosen One (Steve Oedekirk) wanting vengeance against the evil man named Betty was amusing enough, and the digital effects used to insert actors into an old movie was almost seamless.  Although it's easy to compare this movie to Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" (which also used the premise to splice an old Asian movie and include new scenes by an American actor/director), its humor and aimless direction reminded me of ""Sealab 2021"" as well as other pre-Adult Swim shows; maybe that's why I'm in good terms with ""Kung Pao"" since I like the early Adult Swim programs.  It had promise, but then it had stupidity.Firstly, I would appreciated it if didn't start the movie off with a disclaimer saying it used the original Chinese wushu movie and how it was used make to include American content.  That's not necessary, the magic of the film is to not how it works, even if it's obvious.  Matter of thought, I don't like how self-aware or self-referential the movie tried to be.  The narrator got on my nerves whenever he commented on how outrageous or stupid a specific scene happened: ""Did you see that?  He punched a hole through the guy's chest, that's impossible""...yeah, I know that's impossible, it's not funny when you (narrator) say it; leave the comments to the audience.  These things only distract the film's uncertain nature.The strength that lies within its chi is its effective uses with and around the original material.  How the film was dubbed was deliberately blatant, not exactly original, but it had a couple of good jokes, particularly one with the dog.  It does rely on obvious parodies and gags, but they work: stuff like the constant crazy zoom during the fight with the The Chosen One vs a band of warriors, fighters hitting Betty's crotch and he felt nothing, and the yokel love-interest yelling 'Chosen One' when he's running at the distance again and again; humor through repetition, I say.  It had some really clever moments, like escaping from a trap by simply reversing yourself, but the film's not clever enough.  I'm not saying it should be funny and smart; 'smart' isn't always synonymous with 'clever', and evenstupid comedy can be clever.What holds the film back is the added content itself.  A few scenes were good like the entire baby sequence, but then it borderlines on the absurd.  THe fact that in one scene, The Chosen One was fighting against a kung-fu mastering cow (the allusion of Steve Oedekerk making ""Barnyard"" in the future was made clear). It's too goofy to be funny, moments like that stick out for their immature nonsense.  Half of the jokes in the dub script consists of people making silly noises; that was cute for a few times, but the ""wee-oo-wee-oo"" running gag eventually reachedJackovasauruslevels of irritation.  And then there's that guy playing pop songs with a boombox, which felt out of place.  Finally, the tongue...I was just creeped out with that thing than I was laughing at it.  All of these are funny for six-years-olds and I'm not exactly a child at heart.The off-the-wall slapstick and lazy script lead ""Kung Pow"" into bad habits.  At the same time, it is nicely-made effort and it does have a creative edge.  I did enjoy this movie to some degree, and it's worth a look for those who want a little non-sequitor in their kung-fu spoof.",3,"Too Much Licks, Not Enough Kicks",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3582,"['was', 'THIS', 'close', 'giving', 'Kung', 'Pow', 'Enter', 'Fist', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'received', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'ironic', 'facetious', 'ridiculous', 'embraced', 'came', 'accept', 'kung-fu', 'oddities', 'story', 'Chosen', 'One', 'Steve', 'Oedekirk', 'wanting', 'vengeance', 'evil', 'man', 'named', 'Betty', 'was', 'amusing', 'enough', 'digital', 'effects', 'used', 'insert', 'actors', 'old', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'seamless', 'easy', 'compare', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'What', 'Up', 'Tiger', 'Lily', 'also', 'used', 'premise', 'splice', 'old', 'Asian', 'movie', 'include', 'new', 'scenes', 'American', 'actor/director', 'humor', 'aimless', 'direction', 'reminded', 'Sealab', '2021', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'pre-Adult', 'Swim', 'maybe', 'why', ""'m"", 'good', 'terms', 'Kung', 'Pao', 'like', 'early', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'programs', 'had', 'promise', 'then', 'had', 'stupidity.Firstly', 'would', 'appreciated', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'movie', 'disclaimer', 'saying', 'used', 'original', 'Chinese', 'wushu', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'used', 'make', 'include', 'American', 'content', 'not', 'necessary', 'magic', 'film', 'not', 'how', 'even', 'obvious', 'Matter', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'self-aware', 'self-referential', 'movie', 'tried', 'be', 'narrator', 'got', 'nerves', 'whenever', 'commented', 'how', 'outrageous', 'stupid', 'specific', 'scene', 'happened', 'Did', 'see', 'punched', 'hole', 'guy', 'chest', 'impossible', 'yeah', 'know', 'impossible', 'not', 'funny', 'when', 'narrator', 'say', 'leave', 'comments', 'audience', 'things', 'only', 'distract', 'film', 'uncertain', 'nature.The', 'strength', 'chi', 'effective', 'uses', 'original', 'material', 'How', 'film', 'was', 'dubbed', 'was', 'deliberately', 'blatant', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'had', 'couple', 'good', 'jokes', 'particularly', 'one', 'dog', 'rely', 'obvious', 'parodies', 'gags', 'work', 'stuff', 'constant', 'crazy', 'zoom', 'fight', 'Chosen', 'One', 'band', 'warriors', 'fighters', 'hitting', 'Betty', 'crotch', 'felt', 'nothing', 'yokel', 'love-interest', 'yelling', ""'Chosen"", 'One', 'when', 'running', 'distance', 'again', 'again', 'humor', 'repetition', 'say', 'had', 'really', 'clever', 'moments', 'escaping', 'trap', 'simply', 'reversing', 'film', 'not', 'clever', 'enough', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'smart', ""n't"", 'always', 'synonymous', ""'clever"", 'evenstupid', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'clever.What', 'film', 'back', 'added', 'content', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'entire', 'baby', 'sequence', 'then', 'absurd', 'THe', 'fact', 'one', 'scene', 'Chosen', 'One', 'was', 'fighting', 'kung-fu', 'mastering', 'cow', 'allusion', 'Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'making', 'Barnyard', 'future', 'was', 'made', 'clear', 'too', 'goofy', 'be', 'funny', 'moments', 'out', 'immature', 'nonsense', 'Half', 'jokes', 'dub', 'script', 'people', 'making', 'silly', 'noises', 'was', 'cute', 'few', 'times', 'wee-oo-wee-oo', 'running', 'gag', 'eventually', 'reachedJackovasauruslevels', 'irritation', 'then', 'guy', 'playing', 'pop', 'songs', 'boombox', 'felt', 'place', 'Finally', 'tongue', 'was', 'just', 'creeped', 'out', 'thing', 'was', 'laughing', 'are', 'funny', 'six-years-olds', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'child', 'heart.The', 'off-the-wall', 'slapstick', 'lazy', 'script', 'lead', 'Kung', 'Pow', 'bad', 'habits', 'same', 'time', 'nicely-made', 'effort', 'have', 'creative', 'edge', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'degree', 'look', 'who', 'want', 'little', 'non-sequitor', 'kung-fu', 'spoof']",Kung Pow!

Litton,"[15, 21]","There's not much I can say about writer-director Steve Oedekerk's ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" a spoof on the kung-fu movies of an era gone by that contains jokes, gags, and humor ranging from chuckle-inducing to all-stops-outs belly laughs. As a humorous play on a overly cheesy film genre that only gets goofier with age, the film follows all the necessary rules; the good news is that unlike such a film as, say, ""Scary Movie,"" you don't necessarily have to be acquainted with movies of this sort to appreciate Oedekerk's brand of humor.Using the elements of the digital age to insert himself as a character in the 1976 Hong Kong film ""Tiger and Crane Fist,"" Oedekerk plays The Chosen One, whose family life was stripped from him in his infant years at the hands of Master Pain, who, in the present, adopts the name ""Betty."" Chosen One returns after many years, bent on exacting revenge against Betty.A pretty lame setup, considering the fact that it was the plot of an actual film. What Oedekerk has done is removed the film's main hero and placed himself and various new characters into the film, all the while providing the replacement voices in the redubbiing process.All of this is corny and cheesy, to be sure, but what is most surprising about the movie is how funny it can actually be if you can get into it. The spoofs of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lion King"" aren't exactly fresh, but they still manage a good deal of hearty chuckles. The bigs laughs come from the Oedekerk's voicing of his character's lady-love, who spends much of her time running around yelling ""wee-ohh;"" the narration of the story, at times, provides humorous commentary on the present situation, and was I the only one who got a kick out of the tongue gag?What's most enjoyable about a movie like ""Kung Pow"" is that its dialogue fits right in with the body language and movements of its characters; at one point, a highly-revered master breaks into a coughing fit during the middle of a discussion. Oedekerk's solution? Insert a fly that will enter his mouth. This, and many of the movie's sight and sound gags, are cheap in their construction and execution, but still manage to provide one with a well-spent 80 minutes of almost-continuous laughter.

592269,A3MOHNZBTDGRRJ,B00005JKXE,"D. Phillips ""Film fanatic and librarian""","[6, 11]","Steve Oedekerk's (he was responsible for the Ace Ventura movies) name will never be associated with subtlety or wit but still the idea of this goofy guy in the middle of an old Hong Kong action film sounded promising.  I was thinking that something wonderfully goofy like Young Frankenstein or The Life of Brian or maybe like What's up, Tiger Lilly (which is the film this oddity most resembles) would result.  Unfortunately, despite some amazing technical work that is worth seeing, the viewer is left seeing a promising comic idea whither and die an excruciating death.There is some good here.  Steve Oedekerk obviously spent a lot of time getting fit and learning to move well.  He sometimes has something close to grace in some of his comic pratfalls. It's also obvious, from the director's commentary, that he has a lot of affection for and knowledge about this genre. This shows in the amazing way that Mr. Oedekerk is inserted into the old scenes and the way he matches them with new footage almost seamlessly.  The old film footage looks wonderful and must have required a monstrous effort to restore to this level.Unfortunately all this good work is also undone by Oedekerk who sabotages it relentlessly.  One of his first errors is being the voice for almost every single character on screen.  This is funny for the old master of the temple but works horribly for the female romantic lead (he often has her squealing in a high pitched pig voice).  It also becomes monotonous because the voices often sound like the same person with a limited vocal range trying (and failing) for different effects.Oedekerk also keeps on with his few good routines well after the laughter has died out on everyone's lips.  Witness the rushing camera zooms in his second big fight of the film.  Funny at first and then it becomes old and stale.  Also Oedekerk has to underline every funny act as if we couldn't get it without a repeated double take or a camera pressed relentlessly right into the joke.And then there is the humor which is, as expected, juvenile and sophmoric but shows not even the cleverness of Adam Sandler and it doesn't go anywhere.  For example, the story.  It begins with a legend of The Chosen One (who bears the mark of a talking tongue) who must avenge his family's death at the hands of a dictatorial bully who is working for a mysterious council that fears him.  In the middle of this with no relation to anything in the genre Oedekerk inserts a fight with a lactating cow.  Probably because his comic imagination was so limited he couldn't think of anymore funny stuff to do with the film without inserting a complete non sequitur that contributes nothing but a bizarre sight gag (although maybe the milk shooting is the best parody of The Matrix I have yet seen but aren't these Matrix references getting a bit stale??) and then disappears almost completely without a trace.  My recommendation would be to see the film only if you are a big fan of Steve Oedekerk or love Martial Arts parodies.  People who enjoy good comedy would be wise to steer clear.The DVD is a pretty nice package.  There is an okay director's commentary featuring Oedekerk and the film's producer and film editor(!) and an alternate soundtrack where you can hear the actual actor's voices and what they were saying before Oedekerk overdubbed them.  All this stuff was actually scripted by Oedekerk and doesn't really make much sense (all the original martial arts film sequences are in Mandarin) but it is funny and it is a relief to get away from his voice. There is a brief promotional featurette and some nice brief features on the special effects of the film.  The transfer looks great. I'm sure getting the two films to match well was a challenge at every point in the process and the colors look full and natural and the grain is appropriate to this film genre and actually enhances the viewing experience.In conclusion, good DVD package, good technical work, bad film.",2,Wasting Technology,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,3969,"['Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'was', 'responsible', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'movies', 'name', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'associated', 'subtlety', 'wit', 'still', 'idea', 'goofy', 'guy', 'middle', 'old', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'film', 'sounded', 'promising', 'was', 'thinking', 'something', 'wonderfully', 'goofy', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'Life', 'Brian', 'maybe', 'What', 'up', 'Tiger', 'Lilly', 'film', 'oddity', 'most', 'resembles', 'would', 'result', 'Unfortunately', 'amazing', 'technical', 'work', 'worth', 'seeing', 'viewer', 'left', 'seeing', 'promising', 'comic', 'idea', 'whither', 'die', 'excruciating', 'death.There', 'good', 'here', 'Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'obviously', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'getting', 'fit', 'learning', 'move', 'well', 'sometimes', 'something', 'close', 'grace', 'comic', 'pratfalls', 'also', 'obvious', 'director', 'commentary', 'lot', 'affection', 'knowledge', 'genre', 'amazing', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Oedekerk', 'inserted', 'old', 'scenes', 'way', 'new', 'footage', 'almost', 'seamlessly', 'old', 'film', 'footage', 'wonderful', 'must', 'have', 'required', 'monstrous', 'effort', 'restore', 'level.Unfortunately', 'good', 'work', 'also', 'undone', 'Oedekerk', 'who', 'relentlessly', 'One', 'first', 'errors', 'being', 'voice', 'almost', 'single', 'character', 'screen', 'funny', 'old', 'master', 'temple', 'horribly', 'female', 'romantic', 'lead', 'often', 'squealing', 'high', 'pitched', 'pig', 'voice', 'also', 'monotonous', 'voices', 'often', 'sound', 'same', 'person', 'limited', 'vocal', 'range', 'trying', 'failing', 'different', 'effects.Oedekerk', 'also', 'few', 'good', 'routines', 'well', 'laughter', 'died', 'out', 'everyone', 'lips', 'rushing', 'camera', 'zooms', 'second', 'big', 'fight', 'film', 'Funny', 'first', 'then', 'old', 'stale', 'Also', 'Oedekerk', 'underline', 'funny', 'act', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'repeated', 'double', 'take', 'camera', 'pressed', 'relentlessly', 'right', 'joke.And', 'then', 'humor', 'expected', 'juvenile', 'sophmoric', 'not', 'even', 'cleverness', 'Adam', 'Sandler', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'example', 'story', 'legend', 'Chosen', 'One', 'who', 'mark', 'talking', 'tongue', 'who', 'must', 'avenge', 'family', 'death', 'hands', 'dictatorial', 'bully', 'who', 'working', 'mysterious', 'council', 'middle', 'relation', 'anything', 'genre', 'Oedekerk', 'fight', 'lactating', 'cow', 'Probably', 'comic', 'imagination', 'was', 'so', 'limited', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'anymore', 'funny', 'stuff', 'do', 'film', 'inserting', 'complete', 'non', 'sequitur', 'nothing', 'bizarre', 'sight', 'gag', 'maybe', 'milk', 'shooting', 'best', 'parody', 'Matrix', 'have', 'yet', 'seen', 'are', ""n't"", 'Matrix', 'references', 'getting', 'bit', 'stale', 'then', 'almost', 'completely', 'trace', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'love', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'parodies', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'steer', 'clear.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'nice', 'package', 'okay', 'director', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'Oedekerk', 'film', 'producer', 'film', 'editor', 'alternate', 'soundtrack', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'actual', 'actor', 'voices', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'Oedekerk', 'overdubbed', 'stuff', 'was', 'actually', 'scripted', 'Oedekerk', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'original', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'sequences', 'are', 'Mandarin', 'funny', 'relief', 'get', 'away', 'voice', 'brief', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'nice', 'brief', 'features', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'transfer', 'great', ""'m"", 'sure', 'getting', 'two', 'films', 'match', 'well', 'was', 'challenge', 'point', 'process', 'colors', 'look', 'full', 'natural', 'grain', 'appropriate', 'film', 'genre', 'actually', 'viewing', 'experience.In', 'conclusion', 'good', 'DVD', 'package', 'good', 'technical', 'work', 'bad', 'film']",Kung Pow!

SHAME ON YOU!! Here's how I ""stumbled"" into ""The Fist"" and imediatley laughed my (expletive) off!!I was looking for ""Big Trouble in Little China"" on DVD when I found it packaged in a 2-pack with ""Kung Pow; Enter the Fist"". The 2-pack was $$ more than BTiLC all by itself. I actually hesitated. I thought ""do I really want to spend 2 bucks extra for a film I had'nt even concidered buying?"" I decided to take the plunge. To this day it is still my crowning achievement in DVD purchasing savvy. This said, my expectations for this film were ZERO!The first time I watch ""Kung Pow"" I was eating lunch (turkey on Italien with mustard and a pickle). I giggled, pretty much non-stop, through the first 20 minutes. Then, I just smiled amusingly for about 20 minutes. Then I laughed so hard I nearly choked on my sandwich (seriously). Dispite this trauma, I continued to laugh myself to tears. The cause of this disgusting display was an out-of-the-blue moment were Ling(?), the female lead with the voice of Miss Piggy, inexplicably ""quacked"" like a duck with strep throat. Now, the whole film is not funny. Some scenes just try too hard. But, overall, I enjoyed myself enough that in retrospect, I would certainly have paid regular price for it.So why the discrepancies in reviews? Why the ""all or nothing""?I still have not figured it out. I loaned my DVD to a co-worker, insisting it is the funniest thing I've seen in recent memory. He said it was ""sophmoric"" and painfull to watch. I responded ""OF COURSE IT'S SOPHMORIC!! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT!?"" This from a person who is a Monty Python geek!? Now, I love the ""Holy Grail"" but I did not, EVER, laugh hard at that film. Holy Grail elicited chuckles but never good, from the gut, belly laughs as Kung pow did. Now don't think I'm comparing the 2 as films, I'm comparing their ability to make me laugh (which admittedly is not difficult).Is this a stupid movie? Of course!Is this a great film? Of course not!!Is there a story, great acting, breathless imagery... ...a point? OF COURSE NOT!!!If you expect any of those things, bow out now.

If you think the main villain having a girls name is hilarity incarnate, buy the DVD. Just don't come crying to me if it stinks.I did however give this turkey 2 stars. Why is thatThis is perhaps the most original concept for a film in the last few years. While the market is saturated with formulaic junk that is guaranteed to make good at the box office, Steve Oedekerk, like Tom Green (FREDDY GOT FINGERED), risked having a bomb on his hands when he released this film. If you're not a fan of 70's Hong Kong chop-socky, and nobody explained this films concept to you, you would think it was just a bad bad attempt at spoofing a genre.But this is both a spoof and a sincere homage to the chop-socky of days past, before Jackie Chan killed off the Hong Kong chop-socky scene forever when he migrated to Hollywood and started making action-comedies with Chris Tucker and Owen Wilson.Now the problem here is with the comedy element. Quite simply, few of the jokes here are remotely funny unless you're 12 years old. Perhaps that was the intended demographic and perhaps it wasn't. Either way, if you are reasonably intelligent and old enough to see this film without your parents, you'll probably find yourself groaning, rather than laughing at the jokes..... Now if you've gone and spent your money on something, you want to convince yourself that it was worth it. I know what that's like.

You might be thinking, ""Is this one of those films that would work as a five-minute skit but nothing longer?"" The answer is no. This film made me laugh out loud throughout. The picture is not very crisp, but since it was a 1970's film from Japan, you can't expect much. Steve Oedekerk intentionally shot his parts on bad film, and everything blends.

592277,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00005JKXE,General Breadbasket,"[2, 2]","The martial arts comedy ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" is like a film remix. Two Hong Kong films from the 1970s have been spliced together with new footage, so it now stars director Steve Oedekerk, who also dubs everyone in silly voices (including himself). It's an entertaining, silly film, and I know here in Australia it's already something of a quiet classic among the DVD rental crowd.Steve Oedekerk plays the chosen one, a young man raised by rodents, who has a talking tongue named Tonguey and a dog named Dog, and a young man who seems to attract trouble. The biggest cause of the trouble is a Mr ""Betty"" Pain, a man whose iron claws, triangular studs and boombox tunes make him virtually invincible. To top it all off, he is a master magician, and can make his associates clothes change colours halfway during a scene. To defeat him, the Chosen One must reach the next level, so he trains and the local dojo. He trains hard, and is an impressive fighter, but will he be able to stop Betty?Dubbing an old film with your own voice seems like such an obvious and funny concept I'm suprised it hasn't been done in a feature film like this before. Steve Oedekerk has a lot of fun playing with the dubs, camera angles, battle scenes and martial art film cliches. The new footage fits in really well. There is a bit of computer animation, but it is given the weathered treament along with the old footage, which is a really good look I think. It's a very, very quotable film. My favorite scene would probably have to be the intermission, where the characters recommend snacks for the viewers to eat from the lobby. ""I have Chosen the large tub"" says the Chosen One. ""My nipples look like Milk Duds"" says Wimp Lo. ""I hope they have Icies!"" the pretty Ling says. One of the martial arts masters makes a comment about yellow popcorn, but I won't repeat that here. That reminds me, the film does get a little crude at times, and a little bloody (in a silly way), but it's not too bad.The ""Chosen"" Edition is the one to get, as it includes features (like the audio modes) which are just as funny as the film, and give you an idea of how the film(s) was mixed together.I'd recommend this film to people who like to laugh at bad films (though this is a good film).

In fact I was so shocked at how well done the effects were since the rest of the movie was so purposely done poorly.

Such is the case in &quot;Kung Pow: Enter The Fist&quot;.  It's clear that Steve Oedekerk and crew prided themselves on this movie making little or no sense at all.  Oedekerk had himself digitally inserted into dozens of existing scenes from other older movies simply because he could and it looked ridiculous.  It made for a refreshing and funny experience.  Now, for the DVD of this film:  Nice selection of extras, delete scenes, commentary and the like.  But the best part is they were able to offer the viewer something totally unique to this silly little film:  The original audio tracks from the 1970's kung-fu movies they &quot;borrowed&quot;.  This track includes Oedekerk's original dialogue(which he naturally replaced later with his own selection of silly  voices for the dialogue).  The &quot;original&quot; recordings he made had him saying utter nonsense, thus allowing the dub over later to look like an authentic kung-fu movie.  Simple yet quite effective.  Another gem on there is the sixth &quot;English&quot; track.  I use it in quotes because this track is just someone reading the dialogue with a British accent!  This is just a great example of some movie makers who were just out to have some fun.

592290,A1E8ZHGZSMV3E0,B00005JKXE,JustinK,"[3, 3]","I always read negative reviews first at Amazon.com. If the negative reviews have no substance, and their critiques sound overly-biased or misunderstanding, then I figure that the product is probably good enough to try. For Kung Pow, I don't think that most of the people who gave negative reviews really ""get it"".People were slamming the acting, the production levels, etc. Hello!? It's suppose to be bad and cheesy! That's what makes movies like Red Neck Zombies, Evil Dead 2, etc. great movies. They are corny, and they don't try to fool anyone into thinking that they are anything else. Being bad is what makes this movie good. Oederick (sp?) is also a perfect (if convenient) lead for this movie as well. You don't WANT Will Smith or Jim Carey or someone like that in a movie like this. The character's ""blandness"" (straightness) is what keeps the movie together. The movie itself is charismatic and attention-getting, for the lead character to be overly-developed would have simply caused confusion and made the project fall flat on it's face.If you don't like over-the-top movies, then of course you won't like this one. But if you are the type of person that doesn't like that kind of movie, giving a negative review and calling it dumb would be like someone who hates rap giving a negative review for a rap album. It's very misleading.Personally, I laughed quite a bit while watching this movie. Some of the set-ups for jokes were brilliant, and many of the jokes hit their mark perfectly. A good example is when Wimp-lo and the girl he likes are first introduced, and Wimp-lo walks up to a guy and asks him a question, and then you see the guy's lips moving for like 10 seconds, with a short 1 second ""I don't know"" dubbed in at the end. Yeah, it's been done a hundred times; but then again so have most concepts/jokes. It's all about delivery, performance, etc. And in this case, Kung Pow hit the nail right on the head; the timing was absolutely perfect, and it made what could have been a stale ""I've already seen that"" joke into a very funny ""I'm gonna rewind that and watch again"" joke. This is a small example, but I think it is representative of the whole movie. You either ""get it,"" and can laugh along; or you don't ""get it"" and insist that the movie is bad.I don't think people realise how they sound when they say that this movie has bad acting, production, etc. This is like the people who say rather proudly to wresting fans: ""You know that Pro wrestling is fake, right?"" (fwiw, I don't watch pro wrestling, I just think it's a good example). Gee, really? Who knew? This is so condescending that it's hard to say anything at all in response. Actually it's scripted and not ""fake"" per se, but that's another discussion. Anyway, it's the same thing with these types of movies. Saying that they are ""bad"" is doing nothing more than stating the obvious. It never claimed to be anything else.

Seems the video portion of the original was surprisingly adaptable for this purpose. If you thought that CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was a cinematic gem, then you might find tinkering with martial arts films like this to be a sacrilege. But if you thought CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was overrated, then you just might think it could stand some of the same treatment that created this present spoof. Those who like farce should find a lot of laughs in KUNG POW! ENTER THE FIST. For those of us who find martial arts films to be a hit-and-miss proposition, a spoof like this can be a refreshing diversion. It had me thinking what other films I might like to see twisted this way, not necessarily with total disrespect for the originals. I thought of Jackie Chan movies, for example. I really sort of like Jackie, but surely I'm not alone in finding that plot lucidity is sometimes not the strong suit in his movies. So it got me to wondering if any of his might be given this sort of treatment and maybe even produce sometimes a movie more coherent than the original. But for that matter, why limit it to the martial arts genre? It's equally intriguing to wonder what this kind of re-dubbing might do with THE VIRGIN SUICIDES or VANILLA SKY or INSOMNIA. Maybe even WHAT DREAMS MAY COME or MEET JOE BLACK?

Unlike the mass of crappy parody movies that are produced these days, this movie is actually very funny. If you are into the Japanese Martial Arts genre, you need to pick this one up. This movie is a parody of that specific genre. Luckily, you do not actually have to known anything about the movies it is spoofing to find this movie laugh-out-loud funny. Even if you hate martial arts movies, you will enjoy this one.The movie starts in a small village. Master Pain and his group of thugs enter a home looking for a baby. The baby could affect their evil plans in the future if he is not stopped now. After the baby takes down most of the gang, Master Pain burns down the home in hopes to kill the child. Unfortunately, the baby narrowly barely escapes the flames. His family has been killed, so he is raised by the local wildlife.The baby would become known as ""The Chosen One."" Chosen One will be forced to fight off Master Pain's henchmen for the rest of his life. However, after growing into an adult, he encounters Pain in a nearby village. Chosen One now seeks revenge on Pain, who will change his name to Betty. ""Isn't Betty a woman's name"" is the question running through your and Chosen One's mind. Betty is still a force to be reckoned with despite his feminine name.This is not a intelligent comedy. Kung Pow expects you to lose about 20 IQ before viewing it. There is nothing wrong with a stupid (in a funny way) comedy every now and then. Some of the jokes are insanely humorous; other jokes are lukewarm stupid comedy. All of it mixes fairly well together. You will see references toThe Lion KingandThe Matrixat certain points of the movie that will make you laugh. The other idiotic characters will have you laughing for a long time.The only problem with this film is that the video quality is low sometimes. Kung Pow takes pieces from other Japanese movies that originally played in the 70s. I enjoy this idea, but some might get annoyed by it. The ending credits show how they achieved this in more detail.I wish a sequel were made for this movie. There is plenty of reference to the making of a sequel in this film, but no sequel has been made to my knowledge.

It is a dumb movie, nearly tragically so, but despite my personal cynicism, I found myself laughing right out loud. Perhaps the reason this movie seems funny is that Kung Pow is almost as stupid as most  of the martial arts movies themselves. Stupid begets stupid, but at least Oedekerk employed creative and entertaining stupidity.Do not mistake my meaning here, as I was entirely entertained watching this movie. If the viewer can appreciate &quot;ludirous as art&quot;, they will find this an entertaining movie. With wild abandon, Oedekerk unleashes his wit on everything in sight, particularly other movies, such as the Matrix.Personally, I do not see this movie being any more, nor less ludicrious, than many Jett Li movies or those of Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Lets be ruthlessly honest. Some of the traditional martial art flicks are really insipid, and Oedekerk lampoons them with ruthless satire and deadly accurate humor.I suspect those who are fans of foreign karate pictures may be highly upset with Oedekerk and regard this movie with a hypercritically jaundiced eye. For others who regard most martial arts flicks as absurd, if not ridiculous, they will be thoroughly entertained as Oedekerk renders his parody with black belt humor.It isn't a movie that is going to appeal to everybody. It isn't a movie that will enhance your baseline I.Q. It is a dumb movie. Dumb, funny, silly, and even ridiculous.

Personally, I don't think I would've enjoyed this movie nearly as much if I hadn't been watching kung-fu for so long. But not just kung-fu, bad kung-fu. I only own the good stuff but I've seen enough bad ones to get alot of the jokes going on in this movie. Basically, this movie almost killed me. I laughed so hard for so long, I almost couldn't breath. I hadn't seen anything so funny in a long time and it's been almost as long since.Suprisingly though, I didn't see this in the movie theater. I remember the previews for it and thought it was just going to be stupid. I was dead wrong. I ended up renting it shortly after it came out on video and still didn't expect much. Not long into it, I was in tears. My girlfriend thought I had lost my mind as she had never seen me lose it like that. I agree as it's rare that anything can crack me up like this movie did. Coincidentally, the next movie on my list that has such an effect on me is 'Ace Ventura:When Nature Calls', which is also directed by Steve Oedekerk who stars in and directs 'Kung Pow'. Although Jim Carrey was fantastic in the last 'Ace', I think the teaming of the 2 made it comedy magic.The funniest things about this film are that Oedekerk really knows and gets kung-fu films. He knows exactly what's funny about them. The things that all kung-fu movie watchers chuckle at when watching a particularly bad one. Even the better ones have some, what?, moments in them that can only be explained as bad writing or bad translation. Here, Oedekerk focuses on those and makes them the focus of almost all the characters dialog and personalities. I guess as most any spoof goes, you have to know the original material for it to hit on that deeper level and 'Kung Pow' is an absolute bullseye shot at kung-fu.For me, one of the better aspects about Oedekerks' films is that they're basically clean. He doesn't indulge in cussing to make dialog funnier or gratuitous nudity for cheap thrills like today's comedies. No, he just sticks close to the source of silliness and doesn't get side tracked. Kung Pow never tries to be serious or anything other than an 81 min. joke. Because of that, this movie totally succeeds.The audio and video aren't really worth mentioning here as it's not the type of movie that you'll care as long as it works and it does. The picture is clean, colorful and bright and the audio is clear and discernable on all levels. You'll be having so much fun, you'll forget to check anyways. Personally, I don't think I could watch it just to check the sources. Other than that, the graphics and edits are cheesy but perfect here for what it's doing. Even though it looks fake, the cow is hilarious!!! The dubbing over the old film footage is also crazy funny. It reminds me of an old show called 'Putting on the Hits', where actors would improv voice overs for old films. It used to crack me up and it works here too as the majority of the movie is an old kung-fu movie dubbed with new dialog.I'm not sure how well this movie will do for people who don't watch kung-fu but I can positively guarantee that it'll have the fans in stitches. So for the casual fan of comedies, give it a rent. For the kung-fu fan, buy it now and watch it immediately.

This movie is a low budget film; it was meant to be a spoof; and shouldn't be taken seriously. Some people will say that their level of intelligence is above that of Oedekerks and Kung Pow is a disgrace for what theatres allow now. What is with these people? They adhere to some belief that if they would be embarassed to show the movie to their mother then it is bad and should ruin everyone else's fun by saying it's not funny; when really they aren't able to enjoy the movie for what it is because of these standards. I think Oedekerk was hilarious in the movie and the writing [or what sounded almost as improv] was top-notch; however, by the film's end I was tired of the dubbing and the purposely delayed reaction between Oedekerk and what he is saying.We all like to make fun of Jackie Chan movies or whatever, but basing a movie on spoofing another type of movie? It's hilarious for the first part of the movie, then it just gets redundant. I especially got tired of Oedekerk's voice and the shotty job at acting, if that's what they call it.

We missed it in the theatre, so it ended up being rental material. I'm glad we rented it, as it's not worth movie tickets.I didn't know the movie was a partial rehash of a 1970s kung fu flick, so I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out which parts were from the original movie, and which parts had been put in. After that the gags and the movie itself got old.I like parodies of movies, but this movie used the same gags over and over. The lips not matching up was funny for the first 10 minutes, but when they go so far as to make the dog bark follow 10 or 15 seconds after he makes the barking motion, it's no longer funny. Master Pain renaming himself Betty just doesn't make sense. Maybe if he'd worn nylons or lipstick, or did something even remotely feminine it would have tied in. The guy with the stereo dancing to Sir Mix A Lot and other songs didn't make any sense either, I'd never seen anyone even remotely like it in a kung fu movie, so it didn't fit into the parody.I have to give the movie 2 stars though, the first is for the cow. The CG cow was really well done; it didn't look dodgy or mechanical or really fake. The milk shooting out of its udder was a bit much, but the CG work on the cow was really well done.The second star is for the splicing of Oedekerk into the original movie. The blue screen work was well done, he's put into the scenes well enough that you can't automatically tell which scenes were from the original film and which were filmed for this film.
