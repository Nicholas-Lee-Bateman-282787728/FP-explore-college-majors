974010,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ELJA6K,Grady Harp,"[17, 19]","Claire Denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story, that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will.Ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film is the older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life.  He has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him, but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to Tahiti via Japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a Tahitian women years ago.What Denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, man's interaction with people vs animals, etc.  Much of the time the 'film' doesn't make sense, but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures.  Life is sort of like that: we look, see, observe, integrate, process, and make of it what we will.In using this form of film making (much as she did in the strangely beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique.  Whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information.  This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little.  Perhaps watching again will change that.

974011,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B000ELJA6K,June Bug,"[2, 4]","Multiple characters get introduced during the first half hour. As you observe their activities you are wondering how their lives intersect in a meaningful connection.  Guess what?  You have many more questions than answers. There a few deaths that make no sense or lend value to the dying man's quest.  His character is not only flat, as more is revealed, you are less interested in his problem and appalled at his solution.This story meandered with no hope interweaving past and present, dream and reality, lots of symbolism (which I generally like) but instead I was both bored and confused.  If you enjoyed ""Tree of Life"" this may be something you'd enjoy. For me, the story itself and the manner in which it was told was waste of my time.  This got some great reviews and some of the cinematography was quite nice, but there was one scene which made me laugh (unintended by the director I'm sure).  A ship was in body of ""water"" and there was an animation screen behind it which wobbled around to portray the ship rolling on the sea (I thought I was watching a 50's movie, it was so contrived).For those who like artsy pieces, who like to draw their on conclusions, have at it.
