She is a master of the bokken (wooden sword), and current champion of her school at &#34;street fighting&#34; using it. Her fiercest rival is the president of the flower arranging club, with whom she competes for the affections of the captain of the kendo team.You might think that her fighting at school would get her into trouble, but this is Daimon Academy, the &#34;real bout high school&#34; of the title, where fighting is encouraged, with cheerleaders, an announcer full of energy and bounce, and the school principal giving play-by-play commentary.Sadly, it goes a bit downhill after that. Rather than continuing to explore the dynamics at the school, they seemed to feel it was necessary to introduce an almost unrelated plot. Pity.

694422,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B0000639HK,Amber,"[3, 5]","This was a waste of money for me. I read and loved the graphic novels, so I figured that I would like this just as much. NOT! This was a major disappointment.The storyline of the manga was fast-paced, humorous, and very entertaining. Although it occasionally became difficult to distinguish what was going on, on the whole it was a lot of fun to read.Unfortunately, that same fun storyline was mangled and then dropped by the anime writers. Now, instead of centering on the K-Fights and high school life, it focuses on an interdimensional adventure that doesn't play out. Ryoko is perfect as a fighter, but it is difficult to see the slightly conceited, sword-wielding samurai beauty as fighting dragons and talking to princesses. And there is not even any background given on why this dimension and its ruler need her help.Then another new character comes in, and OF COURSE he knows all about this other dimension, the fight with the dragon, and the talk with the princess. I have one question--who is he, and how does he know all that? The fight with the dragon was a private affair with Ryoko, the dragon, and the princess. So where was he? *sighs* This is yet another thing in this new storyline that doesn't mesh.On the other hand, the characters are wonderful. Ryoko is my favorite, with her rival Azumi following in an extremely close second. Both girls are awesome fighters, and really fun characters. Shizuma didn't get much of a chance to shine here, but from what I can tell he is exactly the same as he was in the manga. The reporter is still a creepy little stalker with a thing for Ryoko, although his English voice actor is the person who played Tai from Digimon (its impossible for me to watch RBHS without thinking--&quot;Hey, that's Tai!&quot;) And just like in the manga, Ryoko's best friend is kicked out of the picture by the arrival of Shizuma.The art is beautiful. Colors are bright and easy to look at, and the movement could not be smoother. The fight scenes are the only reason I watch this dvd anymore--those scenes are wicked cool! So there is one redeeming factor.The voice acting is great in both versions. I think the English is better. The girls are not high and squeaky, and there is a wider range of emotions. In fact, I find their voices rather soothing.I feel I should mention that my computer's dvd player has a problem with this dvd, making the soundtrack skip and jump. This is very disconcerting for a dvd.Although I like the voices, the art, and the characters, I still don't like this anime, mainly because of the warped storyline. It has been more than a year since I have watched this, and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.",3,Please read the books instead!,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2687,"['was', 'waste', 'money', 'read', 'loved', 'graphic', 'novels', 'figured', 'would', 'like', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'NOT', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment.The', 'storyline', 'manga', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'humorous', 'very', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'became', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'whole', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'read.Unfortunately', 'same', 'fun', 'storyline', 'was', 'mangled', 'then', 'dropped', 'anime', 'writers', 'Now', 'instead', 'centering', 'K-Fights', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'interdimensional', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'Ryoko', 'perfect', 'fighter', 'difficult', 'see', 'slightly', 'conceited', 'sword-wielding', 'samurai', 'beauty', 'fighting', 'dragons', 'talking', 'princesses', 'not', 'even', 'background', 'given', 'why', 'dimension', 'ruler', 'help.Then', 'new', 'character', 'OF', 'COURSE', 'other', 'dimension', 'fight', 'dragon', 'talk', 'princess', 'have', 'one', 'question', 'who', 'how', 'know', 'fight', 'dragon', 'was', 'private', 'affair', 'Ryoko', 'dragon', 'princess', 'So', 'where', 'was', '*sighs*', 'yet', 'thing', 'new', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'mesh.On', 'other', 'hand', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Ryoko', 'favorite', 'rival', 'Azumi', 'following', 'extremely', 'close', 'second', 'girls', 'are', 'awesome', 'fighters', 'really', 'fun', 'characters', 'Shizuma', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'chance', 'shine', 'here', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'exactly', 'same', 'was', 'manga', 'reporter', 'still', 'creepy', 'little', 'stalker', 'thing', 'Ryoko', 'English', 'voice', 'actor', 'person', 'who', 'played', 'Tai', 'Digimon', 'impossible', 'watch', 'RBHS', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Hey', 'Tai', 'quot', 'just', 'manga', 'Ryoko', 'best', 'friend', 'kicked', 'picture', 'arrival', 'Shizuma.The', 'art', 'beautiful', 'Colors', 'are', 'bright', 'easy', 'look', 'movement', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'smoother', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'dvd', 'anymore', 'scenes', 'are', 'wicked', 'cool', 'So', 'one', 'redeeming', 'factor.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'versions', 'think', 'English', 'better', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'high', 'squeaky', 'wider', 'range', 'emotions', 'fact', 'find', 'voices', 'rather', 'soothing.I', 'feel', 'should', 'mention', 'computer', 'dvd', 'player', 'problem', 'dvd', 'making', 'soundtrack', 'skip', 'jump', 'very', 'disconcerting', 'dvd.Although', 'like', 'voices', 'art', 'characters', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'anime', 'mainly', 'warped', 'storyline', 'been', 'more', 'year', 'have', 'watched', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",Real Bout High School: Enter the Samurai Girl - Volume 1

While I am a huge fan of Street Fighter, most fighting animes don't have any plot, and don't do well at all. I had heard good things about the series, and I had happened to go shopping a day or two after it came out, saw that there was only one copy left, and decided to give it a go.""Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School"" is about a girl named Ryoko Mitsurugi who is titled as the best fighter at the school, and Is always being challenged by different teams or people -- and these fights are actually encouraged by the school board. In the first episode, Ryoko finds a necklace that transports her into an alternate realm to defeat monstors. She later returns and tries to figure out what she had just experienced. Ryoko's rival is Azumi Mitsurugi, and they're always arguing over a guy named .  Although they are rivals, Azumi tells Ryoko that she can learn to advance her skills by becoming the apprientance of a mysterious man named Tessai Onizuka, who teaches her to use her weapon as a sword, and as a stick.The animation is extremely good for a television series, and there weren't any noticable jumps or rainbows around charectors.  Shading is done wonderfully, and colors are bright and brilliant.The sound is just your classic TV stereo sound.The menus were done very well and creatively.  The menu looks like an actuall fighting video game match going on between Ryoko and Azumi.  The sub-menus look like options menus and select-a-charector type menus.There are four episodes on the disc.  ""Enter the Samauri Girl"", ""The Strongest Man Joins the Fight"", ""Enter the Way of the Swordsman"", and ""The Girl with the Deep Black Eyes"".Some of the english voice actors on Real Bout High School have worked on previous shows like Cowboy Bebop and Rayman Earth, so they should be recignizeable.Some extras include four ""Special End Corners"", which are little extras hosted by the two main Japanese voice actresses.The first four episodes are very good, and the show is promising.

While the basic plot is rather hackneyed (super-skilled kendo girl fits in the school league, but also finds a pendant that makes her punk demons in another world from time to time), the characters are actually pretty likeable, even if they are common anime archtypes. The show does a good job of keeping the mood light without becoming completely flippant, and the episodes really fly by. The fight scenes are the definite standouts, with great choreography and pacing, but the other scenes of character and plot building are also done well enough to hold your interest.The dialogue is actually pretty fast and witty, and the translation is pretty good, which certainly helps matters. Visually, the show has nice production values, with well-articulated motion and vibrant, clean colors. Character designs are also very well done.

Unfortunately, the show couldn't finish the race.  This volume is an utterly unsatisfactory way to end the show.First, out of the three episodes on this disc, there's probably a full episode's worth of flashback.  That is inexcusable on a 13 episode series like this, and even more that it is all on one volume--a third of this disc is flashbacks.  Bleh.Second, the storyline falls completely apart.  The battle promised in Episode 12's title never occurs, and the real climax of the series is all but off-screen.  There is also no resolution to the (admittedly silly) romantic subplot.Finally, nothing which does happen on-screen makes much sense.  We never see the connection between Miyuki's mystical powers and the events around her; we never see what Gates really is (mafia boss or demon or both); we never learn why Ryoko suddenly gets some magical powers of her own.  The explanations, such as they come, are in almost nonsensical one-liners--you just can't put them together to assemble anything.Ryoko's adventures thus come to a disappointing ending.  The standard anime excuse for a failed ending--you can go read the manga (comic)--doesn't even help here: the comic tells an entirely different story, which has none of the supernatural elements of the anime.I guess if you like the show up until now, you probably want to see the end, but beware: you'll be disappointed.
