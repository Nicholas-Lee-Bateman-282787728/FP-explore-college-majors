Part of this is that they want Jennifer Aniston to be cast, as usual, as the wholesome girl next door.The critics saw all the surprises ahead of time. I really didn't and I enjoyed them. (If you figured out the twists in A Beautiful Mind, you can guess this, too.)Another possible reason for the tepid reviews is that it is an upsetting movie with several horrific scenes of violence.  No doubt about it, it simply isn't a likable movie; if you were to take your kids --dont!--  they'd have nightmares.Financial advisor Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) and ad guy Charlie Schine (Clive Owen) have an illict affair after a chance meeting on a commuter train. But it doesn't go smoothly and soon they are victims of an extortion plot.As usual, the advertising agency scenes are off the mark. What is a ""commercial executive?"" Even though we see Charlie at work what exactly does he do? (Even What Women Want -- a much better film -- went wrong here.)  Even worse, there is no there there to the financial advisor scenes. So both characters' jobs are Hollywood hooey.Both the main chracters are in a complete bind between family conflicts  -- Charlie has a sick child -- high-pressure jobs, their shared secret, and their shared victimhood.As in all the Hitchcock films, the victims can't go the police. (Remember how threatening the police officer is to Marion Crane -- Janet Leigh -- in Psycho?)Surely this is no Hitchcock masterpiece, but it is an entertaining and twisty thriller.The screenwriter Stuart Beattie also wrote the far better Collateral.  Maybe the more you liked Collateral, the less you will like Derailed?Even with two well-known stars, there is zero anticipatory buzz about this movie.  We all know Jennifer Aniston from Friends on TV, but Mr. Owen has been in many excellent films: Sin City, Closer, The Bourne Identity, Gosford Park, Croupier.Rappers RZA and Xzibit are well-cast supporting players. Vincent Cassel captures the essence of the chameleon-like villain. You want to throttle him throughout the picture.Did the studio that released this picture have little faith in it? The marketing budget and the short marketing time frame -- a few weeks in advance, not months -- suggest that's true.  Maybe their dismissive attitude was conveyed to the critics.",4,Much better than they say,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,2355,"['are', 'critics', 'especially', 'writing', 'reviews', 'collected', 'online', 'Part', 'want', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'be', 'cast', 'usual', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'door.The', 'critics', 'saw', 'surprises', 'ahead', 'time', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'figured', 'out', 'twists', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'can', 'guess', 'too', 'possible', 'reason', 'tepid', 'reviews', 'upsetting', 'movie', 'several', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'violence', 'doubt', 'simply', ""n't"", 'likable', 'movie', 'were', 'take', 'kids', 'dont', ""'d"", 'have', 'nightmares.Financial', 'advisor', 'Lucinda', 'Harris', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'ad', 'guy', 'Charlie', 'Schine', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'have', 'illict', 'affair', 'chance', 'meeting', 'commuter', 'train', ""n't"", 'go', 'smoothly', 'soon', 'are', 'victims', 'extortion', 'plot.As', 'usual', 'advertising', 'agency', 'scenes', 'are', 'mark', 'What', 'commercial', 'executive', 'Even', 'see', 'Charlie', 'work', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', 'Even', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'Even', 'worse', 'there', 'there', 'financial', 'advisor', 'scenes', 'characters', 'jobs', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'main', 'chracters', 'are', 'complete', 'bind', 'family', 'conflicts', 'Charlie', 'sick', 'child', 'high-pressure', 'jobs', 'shared', 'secret', 'shared', 'victimhood.As', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'victims', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'Remember', 'how', 'threatening', 'police', 'officer', 'Marion', 'Crane', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Psycho', 'Surely', 'Hitchcock', 'masterpiece', 'entertaining', 'twisty', 'thriller.The', 'screenwriter', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'also', 'wrote', 'far', 'better', 'Collateral', 'Maybe', 'more', 'liked', 'Collateral', 'less', 'will', 'like', 'Derailed', 'Even', 'two', 'well-known', 'stars', 'zero', 'anticipatory', 'buzz', 'movie', 'know', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Friends', 'TV', 'Mr.', 'Owen', 'been', 'many', 'excellent', 'films', 'Sin', 'City', 'Closer', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Croupier.Rappers', 'RZA', 'Xzibit', 'are', 'well-cast', 'supporting', 'players', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'essence', 'chameleon-like', 'villain', 'want', 'throttle', 'picture.Did', 'studio', 'released', 'picture', 'have', 'little', 'faith', 'marketing', 'budget', 'short', 'marketing', 'time', 'frame', 'few', 'weeks', 'advance', 'not', 'months', 'suggest', 'true', 'Maybe', 'dismissive', 'attitude', 'was', 'conveyed', 'critics']",N/A

641887,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JOL4,A Customer,"[3, 3]","It's lurid, melodramatic and violent, it defies logic, and you really have to suspend disbelief at most of what you are watching, but Derailed is a serviceable, quite exciting genre thriller that hits all the right notes and is mostly worth watching for the sexy chemistry between Clive Owen and Jennifer Anniston. Thriller fans will enjoy this movie, as it has a slick, polished sensibility and a plot that just races along, but don't expect it to be without fault.Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is having a rough time lately. Charles and his wife Deanna (Melissa George) are stressed in their marriage. Both have been working constantly to save extra cash for their ailing daughter who has Type 1 Diabetes requiring her to have a home dialysis machine and undergo other expensive treatments. One confusing morning, after leaving home Charles forgets to take enough money to pay for his train fare.Lucky though, there is the generous and sexy yuppyish Financial Advisor Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Anniston) to buy a ticket for him.  Soon they develop a train riding relationship, and benign pleasantries turn into having lunch, which turns into drinks after work. The accelerated flirtation eventually culminates in attempted infidelity. Soon they find themselves making out and going to a seedy hotel for a secret romp.Their tryst is thwarted when a French-accented thug breaks into their room and enacts, with theatrical relish, the worst nightmare of guilt-ridden, well-heeled adulterers. Blaming the whole thing on getting mugged Charles tries to put it behind him when he gets a call at home from his attacker, Philippe Laroche (Vincent Cassel), who begins a game of blackmail needing $20,000 or things will be taken further.Directed by Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m from a vaguely familiar screenplay by Stuart Beattie, the film ushers in every twist and turn with a kind of unsubtle foreboding, but that's half the fun of the movie. The shocks and plot twists come with a shocking intensity with Hfstr&ouml;m accomplishing the difficult task of making Owen seem ineffectual and lumpish and Anniston sharp and grim, he's also made Vincent Cassel's slick, versatile, multilingual arch-villain LaRoche improbably florid and cartoonish.Rather than nail its characters to the bed they've made, Derailed spins off into reprehensible mastermind territory, all the while slogging through a predictable rehash of the cinematic dangers of cheating on your wife - especially if you happen to be an upper-middle-class executive, your wife a gorgeous blond schoolteacher and your daughter a vulnerable, sickly waif whose fourth kidney transplant you've scrimped and saved for.Yet the film is always compelling, and imminently watchable and it's interesting seeing Owen and Anniston together; they have the type of relationship that achieves a pulpy, darkly driven passionate intensity that commands an equally hammering denouement for them both.

641888,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00005JOL4,Adam Craig,"[0, 1]","Things have really changed in Hollywood in the last decade.  I can remember back about 7 or 8 years ago, when the thriller/suspense genre was one of the most successful types of movie to make.  When Michael Douglas was in his heyday with films such as Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, A Perfect Murder, and others, those were the days of the Hollywood thriller.  Regretfully, since the genre was so popular, most original ideas have long since been done and redone.  Derailed is one of the best thrillers that I have seen since the ""heyday"" of Hollywood thrillers.To not give anything away, I will keep the summary to a minimum.  Charles Schine is a mid-level executive at a commercial marketing firm.  He has a strained relationship with his family due to outside, uncontrollable circumstances.  Charles meets Lucinda Harris one day on the train to work, seemingly an act of fate.  Everything is going normally, with Charles and Lucinda about to commit adultery, until they are interrupted by an armed man with extremely bad intentions.  After the initial incident, Charles is sucked into a game with the perp, otherwise known as La Roche, that involves giving away his family's life savings to keep his mistakes a secret.While the movie definitely goes by the classic thriller formula, that, in part, is what makes it so enjoyable.  It does a great job of making you despise the villain, and Clive Owen is great as the sad, yet well-meaning and genuine husband.  Jenifer Aniston gets second billing in the film, but her role takes a back seat to Owen once the bad things start to happen.  Not only does the film do a great job of getting the viewer involved and caring about the main character, but it also makes sure to make the ending as enjoyable as possible.  The addition of a couple of good twists only serves to make the movie better to look back on once you've watched it the first time.  In fact, I would say that the ending of the film makes it worth watching the movie a second time to see what you can catch that might actually clue you in as to what is actually going on.  In short, this movie was a huge surprise to me.  I wasn't expecting too much, but it turned out to be a great throwback to the amazing thrillers of days gone by.",5,A classic Hollywood thriller,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,2250,"['Things', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'decade', 'can', 'remember', 'back', '7', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'thriller/suspense', 'genre', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'types', 'movie', 'make', 'When', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'heyday', 'films', 'such', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'others', 'were', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'Regretfully', 'genre', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'most', 'original', 'ideas', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'done', 'redone', 'Derailed', 'one', 'best', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen', 'heyday', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers.To', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'keep', 'summary', 'minimum', 'Charles', 'Schine', 'mid-level', 'executive', 'commercial', 'marketing', 'firm', 'strained', 'relationship', 'family', 'due', 'outside', 'uncontrollable', 'circumstances', 'Charles', 'Lucinda', 'Harris', 'one', 'day', 'train', 'work', 'seemingly', 'act', 'fate', 'Everything', 'going', 'normally', 'Charles', 'Lucinda', 'commit', 'adultery', 'are', 'interrupted', 'armed', 'man', 'extremely', 'bad', 'intentions', 'initial', 'incident', 'Charles', 'sucked', 'game', 'perp', 'otherwise', 'known', 'La', 'Roche', 'giving', 'away', 'family', 'life', 'savings', 'keep', 'mistakes', 'secret.While', 'movie', 'definitely', 'classic', 'thriller', 'formula', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'despise', 'villain', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'great', 'sad', 'well-meaning', 'genuine', 'husband', 'Jenifer', 'Aniston', 'second', 'billing', 'film', 'role', 'back', 'seat', 'Owen', 'once', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'getting', 'viewer', 'involved', 'caring', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'sure', 'make', 'ending', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'possible', 'addition', 'couple', 'good', 'twists', 'only', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'look', 'back', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'ending', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'catch', 'might', 'actually', 'clue', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'short', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'surprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'throwback', 'amazing', 'thrillers', 'days', 'gone']",N/A

Something clicks between the two, and before you know it, they're showing off pictures of their kids and agreeing to meet again.  A couple of meetings later it progresses to a surreptitious assignation (that's my two big words for this review) at a seedy hotel, and all seems to be smooth sailing.""Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,Waiting to take you away.Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,And you're gone""Unfortunately, and just a bit too soon, they learn the hard way that seedy hotel door locks can't be trusted, and from here on in, Charles finds himself in deep you-know-what, as an intruder calculatedly takes him for everything he's got.  Lucinda begs him not to involve the police, even though she got the worst of the attack, so Charles tries to tackle the problem himself, with a little help from a friend.Other verses of the song hint at the predictable twist, so I won't go into those, but suffice to say, the improbable and implausible ending totally derails an otherwise entertaining movie.I'd say this one is a definite rental, especially if you're a fan of Owen or Aniston.

641893,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B00005JOL4,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[6, 7]","Chris Schine is an everyday man. Stuck in his own life in which his daughter suffers from Type 1 Diabetes and him and his wife barely even utter a word of affection to each other. On his way to work one day, Chris misses his usual train, leading him to take the train that would derail his life. In his haste to leave the house, he forgets that he does not have enough money to pay for a train ticket when the conductor comes around asking for them. Enter Lucinda Harris, attractive business woman and intelligent banker, who does Chris a favor by paying for his ticket, starting up a relationship of crime, greed, sex, and violence.My initial reaction of the film was astonishment, but in hindsight, Derailed doesn't really break any new ground. There are a few twists, turns and surprises throughout, yet the film relies too much on these few moments. Hafstrom attemps to direct an Alfred Hitchcock-esque film, but does not have the script strength to deliver. What sets the Hitchcock thrillers apartfrom other thrillers is not their twists and turns, but their ability to intrigue both visually and intellectually between the surprises. Too much of the movie is lacking thrills for it to be a great thriller.Clive Owen is the stand-out actor with his role as Christopher Schine. A average, but not to average business man. There is a dorky and goofy allure in Owen's face that is able to be related to by the common person. I'm not a fan of Jennifer Aniston's role as Lucinda Harris. Aniston doesn't carry the mystique that would have been a better fit for the character. These type of roles are for Demi Moore, not good old Rachel from Friends! Aniston much better fits the laid back cute and quirky girls she has played in Bruce Almighty and Office Space and really is not believable as the manipulative Lucinda. On the supporting side of the cast, the RZA was a unexpected gem of an add to the cast. Not only does he serve as a little comedy relief within the film, but also does a terrific job of getting the audience to feel for him, and impressing me in the process.The first twenty or so minutes of the film play out like a standard forbidden romance, and in a taboo type of way, is actually pretty sexy. And then comes the sound of a gun being cocked, and the twists continue. The whole theme of the script does not make this a very likable film, but is kind of like a train wreck that you can't take your eyes off of. You know that the ending is not going to be pretty, and that someone is gonna wind up hurt or killed, but you need to stay around to see the aftermath.Derailed is definitely worth a watch, but that doesn't mean that it is a definitive film. The whole situation in the film is much ado about nothing. Who really cares who some depressed business man is screwing around with? Who cares who is back-stabbing who and why they are doing it? There may not be anyone that cares, but that dosen't mean that there are not people that would be entertained by it.

I mainly went to see it because Jennifer Aniston was in it, and althought she isn't in the movie much (I also too agree the person on the cover art looks NOTHING like her), Clive Owen was a fantastic actor in it. I think it was nice to see Jennifer playing a non-girl-next-door role, and she plays the role rather greatly. It's not something she would normally do at all (If you are expecting a F.R.I.E.N.D.S Rachel Green type-act from her, get that thought out of your head. Look at the cover art, for God sake.), but it is very great to see her do something more haunting and eerie. As for the plot, I thought it was rather cunning and clever, despite Lucinda (Aniston) doing the same cun over again. I'd also suggest you watch Jennifer's other current film, Rumour Has It.

Charles is bored with life, saddled with a very sick daughter, and having a difficult time at work.  He is thrilled that someone as beautiful as Lucinda could be interested in him and before long the two are headed to a hotel.  Just as they are about to consummate their relationship, a thug (Vincent Cassel) bursts into the room, robs and beats Charles and rapes Lucinda repeatedly.  Ashamed, shaken, and badly hurt, Charles is shocked when the villain not only calls him and demands blackmail money but also shows up at his home.  Charles pays the blackmail but enough is not enough.  The villain, sensing Charles' weakness and inability to fight back, increases his demands.There are twists and turns that will keep the viewer on the edge of his seat.  I won't, of course, reveal what happens, but the first twist is not the last and this story will not let you relax.  It's terribly violent, unnerving from start to finish, but worth seeing.

Charlie gets on the commuter train one day and oops, the wife took all the cash from his wallet and he can't pay the fare.  In steps Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) to pay Charlie's fare.  Lucinda is looking hot in her 3-inch heels and black sheer nylons and all the men on the train are checking her out.  Charlie can't believe his luck.  Next thing we know, Charlie is lying to his wife and Lucinda is lying to her husband so these two can hook up and commit adultery with one another.  But just when they are about to get it on, a thug breaks into their seedy hotel room and robs them both, pistol-whipping Charlie as he tries to protect Lucinda from being raped.For the next 40 minutes, we see Charlie's life unravel as he is blackmailed by the French-accented LaRoche (Vincent Cassel).  But the real movie doesn't begin until a full 60 minutes into the story; the first hour is only the setup.If you like Clive Owen (and I do), this can be a tough movie to watch.  Charlie is a chump physically in this movie, as he tries to do whatever LaRoche tells him to do, instead of going to the cops and putting an end to his terror.  But Charlie is desperately trying NOT to destroy the lives of his family or Lucinda, so he feels powerless to do anything but be victimized by LaRoche.Hang in there: the first 60 minutes is only the setup for the real movie.  And believe me, you will be cheering Charlie (and loving Clive all over again) when you see where the film is headed.There are some plot twists in this flick, and while I think they could have revealed things a bit sooner than they did, it's just as satisfying when the real situation is revealed. Some reviewers thought the movie was predictable and perhaps that's true, but it's still fun to wait and see if you're right about what you think is going on.  Even if you are right, I can guarantee that you'll be surprised by the final revelation.As I said, this isn't Clive's best work, but that isn't his fault; there are problems with the pacing.  He portrays a man in an interesting moral dilemma, one that nobody wants to find himself in.  In Charlie's place, what would you do?  Keep in mind that running to the cops isn't an option.  How's it all going to end?  And what's the story with Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston)?  You'll find out.Giancarlo Esposito (Detective Lee) is as cute as ever, although he has a small role.  Winston is played by rapper RZR and he will endear himself to you, foul language and all.I definitely recommend Derailed for a good matinee.

Don't want to spoil the plot, but she's a twisted sister in this thriller as she lures Clive Owen into a honey trap that goes horribly wrong for everyone involved, especially Owen, who finds himself blackmailed, haunted by his own stupidity, and out of money to care for his ailing daughter. Granted this is straight up Hollywood formula, but it's well done and very, very well acted. Aniston deserves credit for playing her character perfectly, just enough sweet with a whole lot of subtlety. Forget the characters you've seen Jennifer Aniston play because she earns high marks for stepping into this role, which is not what too many people expect.

641921,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JOL4,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 1]","Swedish director Hafstrom (Evil) gives a striking visual sheen to this simplistic thriller, essentially a variation on Fatal Attraction, with exactly the same themes.Charles (Owen) is an overworked Chicago ad-man with a wife (George) and daughter (Timlin) in the suburbs. Much of his attention has gone toward earning money to pay for the daughter's kidney transplant, straining his marriage as a result. So he's vulnerable when he meets the flirty Lucinda (Aniston) on a commuter train. But just as they begin a tentative affair, they're assaulted by the French thug Laroche (Cassel), who turns into a menacing extortionist and threatens to destroy Charles' entire life.The plot is both preposterous and predictable--alert viewers will see the twists coming. So it's the central issues that keep us gripped, asking as things get increasingly tense, ""What would I do here?"" The problem is that all of the characters make such bad decisions that it's difficult to feel any sympathy at all, no matter how engaging the performances or how stylishly the film looks.There's a nice Hitchcockian vibe running through this wronged-man story, and Owen plays Charles with a surprisingly energetic charm, balanced by Aniston's sexy fragility and Cassel's kinetic viciousness. From the moment they come together, these three seem locked in a death struggle, with increasingly threatening situations in which no one's remotely innocent. It's also nice to see Aniston play a darker, murkier character than normal (to match her darker, murkier hairdo).Hafstrom has some superb jolts up his sleeves, and even gives the supporting cast character-defining scenes. Esposito is fascinating in the under-written detective role; RZA is surprisingly effective as Charles' ex-con coworker; Conti is rarely seen as Charles' boss; Xzibit is pretty bad as Laroche's sidekick.Gaping plot holes are plentiful, but not too glaring, although Beattie's script cheats by withholding some key information to make way for one last twist. The strangest thing, though, is how the filmmakers skip over the potential subtext (race/class issues) to make what's essentially a shallow, pointless thriller. Like a one-night stand, it's gripping while it lasts, but will be hard to remember in the morning.",3,"Thrilling, but VERY familiar",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2262,"['Swedish', 'director', 'Hafstrom', 'Evil', 'striking', 'visual', 'sheen', 'simplistic', 'thriller', 'essentially', 'variation', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'exactly', 'same', 'themes.Charles', 'Owen', 'overworked', 'Chicago', 'ad-man', 'wife', 'George', 'daughter', 'Timlin', 'suburbs', 'Much', 'attention', 'gone', 'earning', 'money', 'pay', 'daughter', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'straining', 'marriage', 'result', 'vulnerable', 'when', 'flirty', 'Lucinda', 'Aniston', 'commuter', 'train', 'just', 'begin', 'tentative', 'affair', ""'re"", 'assaulted', 'French', 'thug', 'Laroche', 'Cassel', 'who', 'menacing', 'extortionist', 'destroy', 'Charles', 'entire', 'life.The', 'plot', 'preposterous', 'predictable', 'alert', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'twists', 'coming', 'central', 'issues', 'keep', 'gripped', 'asking', 'things', 'get', 'increasingly', 'tense', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'here', 'problem', 'characters', 'make', 'such', 'bad', 'decisions', 'difficult', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'matter', 'how', 'engaging', 'performances', 'how', 'stylishly', 'film', 'nice', 'Hitchcockian', 'vibe', 'running', 'wronged-man', 'story', 'Owen', 'Charles', 'surprisingly', 'energetic', 'charm', 'balanced', 'Aniston', 'sexy', 'fragility', 'Cassel', 'kinetic', 'viciousness', 'moment', 'come', 'together', 'three', 'seem', 'locked', 'death', 'struggle', 'increasingly', 'threatening', 'situations', 'one', 'remotely', 'innocent', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Aniston', 'play', 'darker', 'murkier', 'character', 'normal', 'match', 'darker', 'murkier', 'hairdo', '.Hafstrom', 'superb', 'jolts', 'up', 'sleeves', 'even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'character-defining', 'scenes', 'Esposito', 'fascinating', 'under-written', 'detective', 'role', 'RZA', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Charles', 'ex-con', 'coworker', 'Conti', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Charles', 'boss', 'Xzibit', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Laroche', 'sidekick.Gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'plentiful', 'not', 'too', 'glaring', 'Beattie', 'script', 'cheats', 'withholding', 'key', 'information', 'make', 'way', 'one', 'last', 'twist', 'strangest', 'thing', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'skip', 'potential', 'subtext', 'race/class', 'issues', 'make', 'what', 'essentially', 'shallow', 'pointless', 'thriller', 'one-night', 'stand', 'gripping', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'remember', 'morning']",N/A

641933,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,B00005JOL4,D. Scott,"[1, 1]","Points about this video:Violence:While this movie certainly earned its R rating, it's not as violent as I feared it would be.  It's not on the level of ""Pulp Fiction,"" even in the unrated version.  There are a few fistfights and gunfights and the infamous rape scene, but all of these scenes are relatively brief, and they aren't more explicit than necessary.  You'll cringe a few times, but you won't have to watch through your fingers.Acting:The acting in ""Derailed"" is fine.  But even though I love Jennifer Aniston, I have to agree with some critics who say she was a bit miscast.  This is not at all a criticism of her acting.  Her persona just didn't fit at any point during the movie.  She did a great job with what she had, and she proved beyond a doubt that she can handle dramatic roles, but it just wasn't the right role for her.Plot and script:The plot is fine; you can imagine something like this really happening.  There are numerous technical mistakes in the film, but these can be overlooked.  The characters do dumb things, but this, too, is something you can usually overlook in a film.  But what you can't overlook is when characters do things that just don't make sense, things that you can be fairly certain no one would do in reality.  That's where it snaps you out of your suspension of disbelief.  Instead of wanting to yell at the screen, ""No, don't do that!"" you want to scream, ""Oh, right!  Like as if he'd do THAT.""Editing:The editing on this film is a mess.  Some scenes that would have really helped explain the characters' motivations are cut, and other scenes that seem to have no purpose are left in.DVD features:They could have done a lot more with this one.  There is not a director's commentary track, which would have been really nice.

I always find myself thinking of them as Rachel, Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Ross and Joey.  That said, I managed to get through this movie all right, and was even able to separate Jennifer Aniston's character in this movie from Rachel Greene by the time the end credits rolled.  Woohoo!After getting over my initial feeling after watching this movie, which was that I hated it, I'm actually finding myself recommending it to people.  It wasn't that bad really.  The story was good, but I did figure things out pretty early on...  That wasn't so bad though, because it just made me enjoy the ending that much more!  When you watch, you should know what I mean because a lot of people I've talked about this movie with have agreed with me on this.As far as the acting goes for this movie, I didn't think it was that great.  I'm not really a fan of Jennifer Aniston.  Yes, I liked Friends, but not because of her.  I seriously just don't think she's cut out for acting in feature films.  Maybe if she hadn't spent so many years on my TV screen as Rachel Greene I'd feel differently...  So I guess if you don't watch Friends, you may very well think she's the greatest actress ever!  As for Clive Owen, I think I've only seen him in one other movie and I just don't get the feeling that he's ever really ""in"" to playing the roles for which he was cast.In this type of movie though, I don't think the talent levels of the actors is very important.  It's the story that matters most, and like I said, I liked the story.I would recommend this as a rental possibility, not for purchasing.

This is no hard task considering that the characters are everyday people. Charles shrine had a simple life as a comercial executive. He had a loving wife, a dog named beanie, and a daughter who has diabetes. Everyday he would catch his train on time until one day he accidently missed the one he always takes. Oddly enough, when he boards the next train he is short on cash and forgot to buy a ticket. Thankfully, a woman a few rows ahead of him pays for him--This is where the two characters come together and eventually start another little train in motion. A train of intrigue and friednship and . . .possibly . . .adultry.The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was that it was formulated in the same way as THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT in where the hits and the shocks just keep coming. It makes you sympathize with Charles and even gets you in suspense from one event to the next. The villian is perfectly illustrated in this tense thriller as a man who wants the dough no matter who you are and will keep asking until eventually he gets paid. But this movie is far beyond blackmail, adultry, and a foolish man who should have looked the other way when another passenger paid for his ticket. In fact, he should've gotten off the train in the first place. But, be aware, there are a lot of shocking twists in this movie.As for the plot, I disagree with some of the other reviewers and say that this is a Hitchcock plot with a modern feel. Two people, meeting on a train, who end up in a world of trouble that they can't get out of. I mean, come on, that's hitchcock.However, this movie was done surprisingly well and I'm shocked that it only made 30 million at the box office. It will probably become one of those sleeper hits on dvd. This movie makes you want to read the book by james seigal just to see if all the peices fit or if the characters were drawn up right.It's really worth a look.This thriller proves that even though ordinary people misses their train; Fear arrives just on time.Enjoy!",5,An Edge of your seat thriller that goes for the gut.,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,2133,"['When', 'watching', 'DERAILED', 'written', 'James', 'Seigal', 'author', 'book', 'have', 'get', 'fully', 'characters', 'viewing', 'hard', 'task', 'considering', 'characters', 'are', 'everyday', 'people', 'Charles', 'shrine', 'had', 'simple', 'life', 'comercial', 'executive', 'had', 'loving', 'wife', 'dog', 'named', 'beanie', 'daughter', 'who', 'diabetes', 'Everyday', 'would', 'catch', 'train', 'time', 'one', 'day', 'accidently', 'missed', 'one', 'always', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'when', 'next', 'train', 'short', 'cash', 'forgot', 'buy', 'ticket', 'Thankfully', 'woman', 'few', 'rows', 'ahead', 'pays', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'eventually', 'start', 'little', 'train', 'motion', 'train', 'intrigue', 'friednship', '.possibly', '.adultry.The', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'formulated', 'same', 'way', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'where', 'hits', 'shocks', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'sympathize', 'Charles', 'even', 'suspense', 'one', 'event', 'next', 'villian', 'perfectly', 'illustrated', 'tense', 'thriller', 'man', 'who', 'dough', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'keep', 'asking', 'eventually', 'paid', 'movie', 'far', 'blackmail', 'adultry', 'foolish', 'man', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'passenger', 'paid', 'ticket', 'fact', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'off', 'train', 'first', 'place', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'lot', 'shocking', 'twists', 'movie.As', 'plot', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'Hitchcock', 'plot', 'modern', 'feel', 'Two', 'people', 'meeting', 'train', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'world', 'trouble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mean', 'come', 'hitchcock.However', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'well', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'only', 'made', '30', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'probably', 'become', 'one', 'sleeper', 'hits', 'dvd', 'movie', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'james', 'seigal', 'just', 'see', 'peices', 'fit', 'characters', 'were', 'drawn', 'up', 'right.It', 'really', 'look.This', 'thriller', 'even', 'ordinary', 'people', 'misses', 'train', 'Fear', 'just', 'time.Enjoy']",N/A

Aniston's role is different from her friends' role.  Cox in the TV series Dirt and Aniston in this movie can definitely relate to each other.  The guy who plays LaRoche, whose role is probably the hardest, plays multiple personalities and the twists in the movie are cool.

His style is tight, tense, and he is in love with  quirky camera angles that keep the viewer on edge.What begins as seemingly a little light comedy romance on a train in Chicago where ad exec Charles Schine (Clive Owen), married to Deanna (Melissa George) and father a young daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) who suffers form renal failure and is on dialysis, quite by serendipity is rescued from a lack of ticket by the beautiful, smart, classy Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) who is also married and also has a beloved daughter.  What develops is an intellectual repartee that evolves slowly but insidiously into passion and the two find themselves checking into a seedy hotel for a tryst, a grand mistake because in medias res their room is crashed by a smarmy Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) who begins his blackmail of the affair by beating Charles and raping Lucinda.  After LaRoche leaves with their wallets, Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, as it would destroy her marriage.The manner in which the blackmail is drawn out with repeated threats and confrontations with both LaRoache and his hit man Dexter (Xzibit), Charles' confiding in an ex-con Winston (RZA) who proceeds to help Charles, and Charles' eventual loss of the money saved for his daughter's medical treatment make for the cat and mouse chase and game in which the true identity of each of the 'players' is revealed and Charles learns his lesson the hard way.To say more would disrupt the flow of the story for those who don't identify con games easily.  Clive Owen is magnetic and though Jennifer Anniston doesn't have a lot of screen time, when she is on she proves she can step into roles much different than previous fluffy ones.

The casting is appropriate, the acting is pretty good (though not great) throughout, and the script continually adds little unexpected twists that keep you guessing.And yet...there's just not much thrill to this thriller.  The easy-going pace that sets up the beginning somehow never shifts into heart-pumping, edge-of-your-seat tension that the term ""thriller"" demands.  It tries here and there, but many of those aforementioned twists come only after waiting a little too long for something interesting to happen.  Even the few attempts at humor all fall flat.In addition, while the acting is generally good, the characters are two-dimensional, which I again lay at the feet of Director Mikael Hafstrom.  This is supposed to be his ""vision,"" and he repeatedly fails to take steps that would make these characters more believable.  So, for example, by the time Clive Owen's ridiculously weak character has finally ""had enough"" and decides to take unlikely measures to fix things, it's hard to care what he does or believe that he doesn't just wimp out again.All in all, it's not bad.

The film was made in 2005, but we are now living in a time when an African-American stands the best chance than ever of becoming the president.Other than its portrayal of blacks, the film has a very simple plot and nothing comes as too much of a suprise.  It has its moments but mostly on the level of a cheaply made TV police drama.From the first scene on the train, it's easy to figure that Jennifer Anniston's character is up to something.  The way she talks to the man on the train is indicative of a woman who is a practiced seductress.  Then we wonder where she got her experience.The robbery/rape scene seems strange from the beginning.  My initial thoughts were: why is he doing that?  What kind of criminal would do something so stupid?Jennifer Anniston's character says somewhere in the film ""we never appreciate or value what we have"".

641949,A457S8SW690NM,B00005JOL4,hi,"[2, 2]","I actually read the brilliant novel Derailed by James Siegel before going to see this movie. The movie stays fairly true to the movie but changes some aspects. The book and the movie are both excellent. The problem I am facing right now is that I am at a loss why everyone dissliked this movie. For all of you that say that you saw the twist coming, well good job, because I have no idea how that is possible. You might as well join the FBI and hunt down killers' next moves if you're that bright. Sure, when I saw the movie, I saw it coming..but only because I READ THE BOOK FIRST! I thought that the plot twists were ingenious and really made the movie so much better.Derailed's plot for one is outstanding. It's kind of like a hitchcock movie..only a newer version. Charles (Clive Owen) is a good guy. He's a good worker with a wife and a little daughter. His daughter has diabetes which makes his life sad at times but still wonderful. His daughter is wonderfully cast.He misses his regular train to work...gets on the next one but figures out that his wife has taken all of his moeny. So a sexy woman named Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) pays for him. She is also married and has a daughter. They are infatuated with each other and start breaking their vows. They go to a hotel room to do you know what until a man named La Roche (Vincent Cassel) breaks in, steals their money and rapes Lucinda before the helpless Charles who's been beating up. This man decides then to blackmail them, figuring that they don't want to telly their spouses what they have done. He figured right. What comes next is an unpredictable thriller with a brilliant finale.Don't listen to people, this movie is unpredictable and really awesome. I've also had enough of people saying that Clive Owen's character is too weak in the movie. First of all, he's not Arnold. Secondly, it's realistic...he's getting the crap beaten out of him and is scared. That's his character for the movie and he develops throughout.The cast for one is outstanding notably Vincent Cassel who brings Laroche to life with extreme vivacity.After having read the book, this movie trully brought it to life and the cast was just as I pictured. The two leads are good and RZA surprisingly is really good.So please watch this awesome thriller with some huge twists that is a new kind of Hitchcock movie. And to tell you the truth, it's one of my faves of the year and one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.

It starts off promisingly enough but unfortunately takes a right turn into stupidville very quickly.  Charles is married with a teenaged diabetic daughter.  He and his wife have been saving for years for special organ rejection drugs they hope will be developed before it's too late to facilitate a successful kidney transplant for her.One morning Charles meets Lucinda (Jennifer Anniston) on the commuter train and they seem mutually smitten.  Things heat up between them in a matter of days and Charles takes measures to begin an affair with her.  Derailed becomes a highly predictable and insulting film from this point on.  Anyone who can't predict where the story is going at this point should probably get to a doctor quickly because they have suffered brain damage.Without divulging spoliers to those who plan to see this hunk of garbage, simply heed the following warning.  Charles,(apparently intelligent enough to be an advertising executive for 10 years) routinely displays the kind of stupidity in Derailed that is usually reserved for teenagers in slasher films.  At every possible turn we are forced to endure one stupid move after another.  Of course these moves are required of Charles because without them, the movie would have been over in about 45 minutes.Alas, the ending can't even save this picture.  It is as predictable and hackneyed as the rest of the film.  Some may actually like this film, but only because they don't know there are better films out there in this genre.

So it was a pleasant surprise when I finally did see it because it is really pretty good. I was also surprised by both of the twists at the end. Of course, the whole premise of the movie is that Charles Schine (played by Clive Owen) doesn't go to the police, which is an amazingly bad decision, but it's like those horror movies when the only sensible thing is for all the characters to stick together and then the first thing that happens is one of them goes wandering off. It's part of the deal with this type of movie, and if you don't buy it you shouldn't watch it. The one aspect of this movie that I thought was absolutely true to life was the effect that caring for a chronically critically ill child has on a marriage. The pressure on Charles to care for his family by making a lot of money, the constant monitoring that is done by the parents, and the frequent crises, all provide a convincing portrait of a once-successful marriage that has devolved into a partnership whose primary purpose is to keep their daughter alive. Clive Owen really embodies a fundamentally decent family man who is looking to forget his worries by embarking on an affair with the extremely attractive stranger on the train.

After the initial character development and getting to know Charles Schine's (Clive Owen's) character and his family, the story unfolds and suddenly takes full speed.Personally, Clive at times seems to be miscast in this picture because he looks like he could beat the crap out of somebody, when he isn't suppose to look that way. Jennifer Aniston gives us another showing that she can be a dramatic actress and sheds the ""Friends"" image that she has had for 10 years. Jennifer is very believable in this role. She handles her tough scene's very well proving to us that she's Oscar worthy, but not in this film. Vincent Cassell (""Ocean's Twelve"") and hip-hop artist and producer RZA as Winston both done a great in this film as well as  Tom Conti (so brilliant in ""Reuben, Reuben"").There are a lot of unnecessary events in this movie that just don't give the plot enough leg to stand on. It's a pretty good mystery that provides a nice twist near the end, but clues and events leading to it (which is obviously the -point- of it) are badly placed, hence making the climax almost every bit anti-climactic. It's hard to believe that Owen's wife would put up with a lot of the nonsense that he pulls to save his skin. To add to that, how the drama ended in the movie was simply unnecessary and a complete overkill. Rome's conspirators might as well have killed Anthony with Caesar.This movie succeeds only on the level of the performances and the effectiveness of the tension in many scenes. It's got a lot of edge of your seat moments, but afterwards when you think about what's happened in this film, you'll be scratching your head.I do recommend this film and I appreciate the way it makes you feel.

They barely get their clothes off in a seedy hotel when a crazed blackmailer bursts into the room, beats Owen up, rapes Aniston, and escapes with money, wallets, and the keys to the pair's personal lives. Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, and he rather inexplicably complies, putting his family and most importantly his sick daughter, at great risk. Unlike some other viewers, I found it hard to swallow Charles' failure to go to the cops and end the nightmare--why is he putting the wishes of a woman he barely knows above the safety of his family, whom he truly loves? Vincent Cassel as the blackmailer is truly menacing, and gives the best performance of the film.There's a twist about two-thirds of the way through that I didn't see coming and otherwise rescued this rather ho-hum story.

You're a married man who's about to have an affair with a woman you barely know, and the two of you are brutally attacked before you consummate the relationship.  You're beaten half to death and she's cruelly raped.  She doesn't want to go to the police because she's afraid her reputation will be damaged, and you cave because you don't really want your wife to know what you were up to.  But time passes, and now your assailant wants to bleed you dry in exchange for his silence, to the tune of over $100,000, which you and your wife have been saving so that you can pay for some expensive, life-saving medicine your kid desperately needs.  So what do you do?Well, personally, I'd go ahead and contact the police anyway, tell them the story, but claim the woman was a totally anonymous pick-up that I'd never seen before and haven't seen since.  Then I'd have the cops bust the blackmailer when he came to pick up the money he was trying to extort.  End of story!  Ah ... but you see, that's exactly the problem the makers of ""Derailed"" were faced with.  If they had been interested in logic or believability, then their film would have been over in about forty minutes.  They should have scrapped it, but no.  Sadly, their solution was to pad the script with an extra hour's worth of ""plot"" that is, frankly, nonsensical garbage that ends up being an insult to the audience's intelligence.  And in the end, the film limps to a silly and unsatisfactory conclusion.Even in the face of such absurdity, cast members Clive Owen, Vincent Cassel, Xzibit, and RZA give it their best shot.  You can tell they're trying.  On the other hand, leading lady Jennifer Aniston seems uncomfortable throughout the entire movie.  But maybe her detached performance isn't an indictment of her acting ability; instead, maybe she realized that she had made a mistake in accepting what is basically an unplayable role, and decided not to waste her energies.  I, for one, could hardly blame her.The blu-ray transfer of this unfortunate mess offers lackluster visuals that often seem unnaturally muted, but the audio is generally crisp.

641977,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JOL4,Kevin Killian,"[2, 2]","I wrote a review several years back of Siegel's novel DERAILED and at that time never guessed that the main characters would be played by Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston!  If you ask me Aniston leaped at the chance to play the part because she saw it ss allegory for the way Brad Pitt got ensnared by the conniving, manipulative Angelina Jolie.  Seen in this light, the movie DERAILED gets a lot more interesting.Why oh why put Clive Owen in the part of a harried Chicago commuter?  And why cast Australian sex bomb Melissa George as his wife, a substitute teacher?  Where does she teach, Melbourne High?  Nevertheless the two work well together, even though going in, and hacing read the book, I envisioned Aniston as the wife and George as the homewrecker.  Jennifer seems to be relishing playing Jolie onscreen, she even sticks out her upper lip a bit in imitation of her rival's famous pout.Why have Vincent Cassel play the blackmailer?  Fans of the book will remember that this guy is not French in the least!  Oh well, it is movie shorthand nowadays that France = evil, and Cassel is having a grand old time up there channelling Satan--the French Satan of Victor Hugo's verse drama.  It must be a difficult thing to be Vincent Cassel, to be all things to all people but in the USA to find work only as a French skeeze.  Warning, this movie has some intense CBT along the lines of CASINO ROYALE but worse, when Cassel comes to Owen's suburban home and sweet talks his way inside and, questioned by Owen, grabs him by the balls and literally lifts him eighteen inches up the wallpaper, that is one scene that had me squirming with sympathy, strong stuff!",4,Aniston's Scathing Take on the Brad-Angelina Relationship,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1658,"['wrote', 'review', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'Siegel', 'novel', 'DERAILED', 'time', 'never', 'guessed', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'ask', 'Aniston', 'leaped', 'chance', 'play', 'part', 'saw', 'allegory', 'way', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'got', 'ensnared', 'conniving', 'manipulative', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Seen', 'light', 'movie', 'DERAILED', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting.Why', 'oh', 'why', 'put', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'part', 'harried', 'Chicago', 'commuter', 'why', 'cast', 'Australian', 'sex', 'bomb', 'Melissa', 'George', 'wife', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'Where', 'teach', 'Melbourne', 'High', 'Nevertheless', 'two', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'even', 'going', 'hacing', 'read', 'book', 'envisioned', 'Aniston', 'wife', 'George', 'homewrecker', 'Jennifer', 'be', 'relishing', 'playing', 'Jolie', 'onscreen', 'even', 'out', 'upper', 'lip', 'bit', 'imitation', 'rival', 'famous', 'pout.Why', 'have', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'play', 'blackmailer', 'Fans', 'book', 'will', 'remember', 'guy', 'not', 'French', 'least', 'Oh', 'well', 'movie', 'shorthand', 'France', '=', 'evil', 'Cassel', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'up', 'there', 'channelling', 'Satan', 'French', 'Satan', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'verse', 'drama', 'must', 'be', 'difficult', 'thing', 'be', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'be', 'things', 'people', 'USA', 'find', 'work', 'only', 'French', 'skeeze', 'Warning', 'movie', 'intense', 'CBT', 'lines', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'worse', 'when', 'Cassel', 'Owen', 'suburban', 'home', 'sweet', 'talks', 'way', 'questioned', 'Owen', 'grabs', 'balls', 'literally', 'eighteen', 'inches', 'wallpaper', 'one', 'scene', 'had', 'squirming', 'sympathy', 'strong', 'stuff']",N/A

641979,A356RFKNIG043B,B00005JOL4,K. Swanson,"[1, 1]","This film is great if you like being told how to feel, and have never seen a decent work of this ilk such as Matchstick Men. If pointless violence and rape scenes are your bag, you'll love it even more. But if you appreciate intelligence and subtlety, stick to Hitchcock and the real thriller masters.[Spoilers coming] The whole thing is so incredibly manipulative: we're told what to feel constantly via foreboding music and hackneyed camera shots stolen from Hitch, but with none of his finesse or humor. The ending makes it even worse; there is absolutely nothing remotely believable about the final killing of LaRoche. Nothing. ""I was on my way to the bathroom and he jumped me."" Oh really? In the back of the prison laundry room? Ridiculous.But then again, this film is full of plot holes you could drive a truck through. Owens tells his wife everything, and his lawyer, but the cops never connect the dots? His wife just forgives him for an affair and a murder? He happens to be in a hotel room next to the killings, while he's still a suspect in the other killing, and the cops never put it together? Etc.And when Aniston, a mediocre actress well out of her puddle-deep depth here, tells the taxi to stop, it's raining hard and the wipers are on. It stops, and one second later, presto! No rain, no wipers. It's magic! No, it's a lousy continuity man on set, and a crummy editor, and a sloppy director.But that's par for this course. My only question is why Owens, who is talented and the only thing (with Cassel) holding this together, took this role.

There seems to be a groundswell of reviewers who want to sink her. Reminds me of Cruise. Yet, they both do excellent work. Perhaps Ms. Aniston is seen as taking Julia Roberts place in terms of 'wholesomeness' and there's resentment afoot.I took away a star because Charlie Shine has everything going for him, beatiful family, true, a sick little girl, $700,000 dollar home, life is OK. So let's complicate life exponentially by hopping in the sack with an utter stranger you just met. Why is he so sad? What's wrong?If I'm going to go with something unbelievable, I'll take Michael Douglas sleeping with Glenn Close in FA. At least he made no bones about having a great life. Here, Clive Owen's marriage is in trouble but we never know why. It just didn't hang together for me.Victor Cassel. Brrr. Good villain. All in all, an enjoyable movie. It could have had more marketing muscle. There is one other thought. Is there something wrong with saying that possibly ""rappers"" lack acting skills?Way, Way back in the day, Hollywood would put the latest teen idol in a movie to act with John Wayne, Gregory Peck, whomever. We had Frankie Avalon in Navarone, Ricky Nelson in several of the Rio movies, and Glen Campbell in Rooster Cogburn. You know what? They were terrible. Frankie breaking into song at a Greek wedding surrounded by Nazis who want to slit their throats wasted the 60 previous minutes Peck and Niven worked for to make the movie suspenseful.

641983,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOL4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","It was ironic that we watched ""Derailed"" tonight because we saw ""Inside Man"" this afternoon.  One is a Clive Owen movie where we could never figure out what was really going on and the other was one where things clicked into place early on and we were getting tired for the hero to catch up.  To be clear, Derailed"" is the second movie.  It is not that this movie is predictable in terms of the action, but that the twist is rather obvious (so obvious that I was wondering if it was a red herring, but, no, it was not).  However, once Owen's character finally gets the big clue, this movie gets fairly interesting and actually end up redeeming itself more than I thought it would.All I remembered about this movie was the bit from the trailer about Owen betting Jennifer Aniston that he can kiss her without touching her lips.  So when I started to watch it I really had no clue what it was going to be about.  When we meet Charles Schine (Owen), he is having a bad time across the board.  His daughter, Amy (Addison Timlin) has the worst type of diabetes; her third kidney transplant has failed and her only hope is a drug the FDA has yet to approve.  At work he has lost a big account.  To top things off, when Charles gets on the commuter train he discovers his wife has borrowed money from his wallet and he cannot pay the $9 fare.  A beautiful woman, Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), pays for his ticket, and he goes from checking out her gams to engaging her in conversation on a train, in a bar (for the bet), and eventually in hotel room.Then something bad happens.If you do not know what the bad thing is you will be able to survive this review with your innocence intact (but if you watch the trailer on the DVD, forget about it).  Charles has to deal with the consequences of what happens and having made one bad decision he has to choose to keep making additional mistakes.  Now, for the sake of this argument forget about the film's obvious twist and just look at the situation from his perspective.  I insist there comes a point where the madness clearly stops because we are in that territory where a father would rather be dead then do what Charles does.  At that point I was extremely unforgiving of the character, screenwriter Stuart Beattie (""Collateral""), director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m (""Leva livet""), and was thinking I might have to check out the original novel to see how culpable James Siegel was in all this.However, then we get to the part of the film where Charles goes from playing defense to going on the offense.  My immediate thought was that this was going to be too little, too late, but I was rather surprised.  What I appreciated was that Charles continues to make mistakes, so there is no sudden transformation from sinner to saint.  I also like the fact that this film recognizes that Charles is playing with such unclean hands that he does not deserve to walk away without paying a price.  By the time this one is over I was actually thinking that we were supposed to figure out the twist, because it is part of the set up for how the endgame plays out, because a lot of what happens is really playing with out expectations.  By definition, that is what a thriller is supposed to do.Final aside: It would be interesting to see this story played out from the aftermath of the bad thing without either the twist or the continuing series of bad things that happen.  It would not longer be a thriller, but it would still be a compelling story played out with these characters.  Certainly there was enough for Charles and Lucinda to live with at that point.",4,One bad move can derail your life.

Sitting through this once was a pain enough, but I can't imagine anyone subjecting them to repeat viewings of this travesty.The good - Clive Owen is fantastic in a very poorly written role as a husband who wants to cheat on his wife with a stranger he meets on the train. Vincent Cassel is passably average as the villain of the piece - a `French' sounding person who insists on using clich&eacute;s and more clich&eacute;s to harass Owen and his pretty family (all of whom are blond in the most blatantly Aryan way imaginable)The bad - Jennifer Aniston. Need I elaborate? This woman can sink a ship simply by phoning in her existence. Never has the aging tart looked or sounded more pathetic, and her entire appearance is only what I can call `doggish'. They even give her some lines. Imagine that. She plays a woman on a train whose job it is to seduce unsuspecting men by taking them to hotel rooms, and then getting her boyfriend (Cassel) to torment them. She is the actual villain in this sordid Bollywood saga, and here she portrays a woman who is molested (though she actually isn't). Tedious.The Ugly - Jennifer Aniston. Nuff said.Final Views - This is not so much a movie as it is a trainwreck (the `Derailed' title makes sense in more ways than one). Many say that the plot is `absurd', but I just think its `unbelievably bad'. That said, the `happy ending' wasn't that much of an ending - everyone pretty much dies, though the more intelligent ones among us might actually take pleasure of the scenes where Aniston bleeds herself to a bloody, slow death after being accidentally shot. And then you remember its just a movie.Avoid at all cost. For a far better film, watch Angelina Jolie in ""Beyond Borders"".

641990,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00005JOL4,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 5]","Stephen Colbert has included Clive Owen in his list of ""Things That Are Trying To Turn Me Gay,"" and indicates that Mr. Owen is only a little less successful than baby carrots.  I sympathize with Mr. Colbert.  I'd buy and watch anything Clive Owen has done, even that series of high-octane BMW commercials he did back in 2001 and 2002.  There's something about his snarly amiability, his capacity to take the conventionally wry Leading Man attitude and give it a dose of sheltered vulnerability that plays like snarky ambivalence.  But mostly I just want him to hold me.Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Okay, well, all of that having been said, this movie?  Not very good.""Derailed"" is, indeed, a clever little thriller, but it's too big for its britches.  The story sprawls so much that its contrivances seem awkward, and its twists seem more like flow-stopping kinks.  Penned by Stuart Beattie after the man had already given us ""Collateral"" and the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Derailed"" lacks the tight plotting and character-driven nuances of either of those movies.Our story follows a fellow named Charles Schine (Clive Owen) who chances to meet a lovely stranger named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his train ride to work.  The two flirt with that sort of soft-toned abrasiveness that comes so easily to the executives of the World of Moviedom (both Schine and Harris' jobs are your typically ill-defined filmic pablum; what they do never matters as much as the fact that its lucrative).  Before they know it, they're slumming it in a moth-eaten motel room and gettin' it on, as they say.Unfortunately, the only one who gets it off, as they say, is the guy who breaks into their room, robs them, and then does unspeakable things in the interim.  The encounter is, indeed, hard to watch, stomach-churning, even if the robber (Vincent Cassel packing his chops with as much cheese as he can) keeps uttering the sort of unimaginative drivel that most movie villains utter in the midst of their bad behavior.  Ah, but can I blame a low life like this for being uncreative?Yes, I can, actually.  Our low life, LaRoche, is actually pretty smart, because the hotel room is just the beginning.  LaRoche, realizing he's attacked a couple of very soft, very wealthy targets, cranks things up a notch, turns the screws, puts the pressure on, ups the ante, hits close to home, ADD METAPHOR HERE.What really ruins ""Derailed"" is its schizophrenic pacing.  Owen is at his greatest when his character has reached an interlude, when a decision must be made.  You can see the dark calculus of his thoughts on his well-angled face, and when he reaches his conclusion, the actions he takes are just an extension of those ruminations.  However, in ""Derailed,"" those moments seem to last forever.  Furthermore, Owen's character is so stupid, so weak, and so spineless, it's hard, by the end, to care what happens to him and his wife and his Dying Daughter (who could be cured by a miraculous new drug that costs as much as Tanzania, apparantly, and for which the Schine's have been saving for seven years; this is known as an Emotional Plug-in).It's great that Owen plays against type in this movie; I'm not faulting him for that.  I am, however, faulting the film for the character it has chosen to place at its center.  Schine's transgressions are understandable, I suppose, and so is his habit of burying all of his problems under a pile of money.  But his actions at the end, the logical leaps he makes in the interim, it's all choreographed inconvenience.  From the cops who inexplicably berate him for not buying a hooker, to LaRoche's perpetually-scowling partner-in-crime (Xzibit, who uses the same facial expression in every frame of the film), to Schine's mail boy, Winston Boyko, an ex-con who still steals from time to time and even has, as a keepsake, the first shiv he ever used to stab someone with (played with companionable charm by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan): it's all hokey and eye-rolling.Of course, the entire movie would fail to exist if Schine would do the one sensible thing and go to the cops, but the script takes great pains to explain why he shouldn't, wouldn't, and doesn't do this.  I never really bought it.  In fact, the further along the film went, the less I bought.  Too much of the movie tries to be clever, tries to circle around into itself.  Its a pile of plot-threads, a tangled mess of consequences and coincidences, and even the great Clive Owen can't save it.But he can still hold me whenever he wants.",2,Train Wreck,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,4522,"['Stephen', 'Colbert', 'included', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'list', 'Things', 'Are', 'Trying', 'Turn', 'Me', 'Gay', 'Mr.', 'Owen', 'only', 'little', 'less', 'successful', 'baby', 'carrots', 'sympathize', 'Mr.', 'Colbert', ""'d"", 'buy', 'watch', 'anything', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'done', 'even', 'series', 'high-octane', 'BMW', 'commercials', 'did', 'back', '2001', '2002', 'something', 'snarly', 'amiability', 'capacity', 'take', 'conventionally', 'wry', 'Leading', 'Man', 'attitude', 'give', 'dose', 'sheltered', 'vulnerability', 'snarky', 'ambivalence', 'mostly', 'just', 'want', 'hold', 'me.Ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'Eh', 'Okay', 'well', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'Not', 'very', 'good', 'Derailed', 'indeed', 'clever', 'little', 'thriller', 'too', 'big', 'britches', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'contrivances', 'seem', 'awkward', 'twists', 'seem', 'more', 'flow-stopping', 'kinks', 'Penned', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'man', 'had', 'already', 'given', 'Collateral', 'first', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Derailed', 'tight', 'plotting', 'character-driven', 'nuances', 'movies.Our', 'story', 'fellow', 'named', 'Charles', 'Schine', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'meet', 'lovely', 'stranger', 'named', 'Lucinda', 'Harris', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'train', 'ride', 'work', 'two', 'flirt', 'sort', 'soft-toned', 'abrasiveness', 'so', 'easily', 'executives', 'World', 'Moviedom', 'Schine', 'Harris', 'jobs', 'are', 'typically', 'ill-defined', 'filmic', 'pablum', 'what', 'do', 'never', 'matters', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'lucrative', 'know', ""'re"", 'slumming', 'moth-eaten', 'motel', 'room', 'gettin', 'say.Unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'off', 'say', 'guy', 'who', 'room', 'robs', 'then', 'unspeakable', 'things', 'interim', 'encounter', 'indeed', 'hard', 'watch', 'stomach-churning', 'even', 'robber', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'packing', 'chops', 'as', 'much', 'cheese', 'can', 'keeps', 'uttering', 'sort', 'unimaginative', 'drivel', 'most', 'movie', 'villains', 'utter', 'midst', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Ah', 'can', 'blame', 'low', 'life', 'being', 'uncreative', 'Yes', 'can', 'actually', 'low', 'life', 'LaRoche', 'actually', 'pretty', 'smart', 'hotel', 'room', 'just', 'beginning', 'LaRoche', 'realizing', 'attacked', 'couple', 'very', 'soft', 'very', 'wealthy', 'targets', 'cranks', 'things', 'up', 'notch', 'screws', 'pressure', 'ante', 'close', 'home', 'ADD', 'METAPHOR', 'HERE.What', 'really', 'Derailed', 'schizophrenic', 'pacing', 'Owen', 'greatest', 'when', 'character', 'reached', 'interlude', 'when', 'decision', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'can', 'see', 'dark', 'calculus', 'thoughts', 'well-angled', 'face', 'when', 'conclusion', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'extension', 'ruminations', 'However', 'Derailed', 'moments', 'seem', 'last', 'forever', 'Furthermore', 'Owen', 'character', 'so', 'stupid', 'so', 'weak', 'so', 'spineless', 'hard', 'end', 'care', 'what', 'wife', 'Dying', 'Daughter', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'cured', 'miraculous', 'new', 'drug', 'as', 'much', 'Tanzania', 'apparantly', 'Schine', 'have', 'been', 'saving', 'seven', 'years', 'known', 'Emotional', 'Plug-in', '.It', 'great', 'Owen', 'type', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'faulting', 'am', 'however', 'faulting', 'film', 'character', 'chosen', 'place', 'center', 'Schine', 'transgressions', 'are', 'understandable', 'suppose', 'so', 'habit', 'burying', 'problems', 'pile', 'money', 'actions', 'end', 'logical', 'leaps', 'interim', 'choreographed', 'inconvenience', 'cops', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'berate', 'not', 'buying', 'hooker', 'LaRoche', 'perpetually-scowling', 'partner-in-crime', 'Xzibit', 'who', 'same', 'facial', 'expression', 'frame', 'film', 'Schine', 'mail', 'boy', 'Winston', 'Boyko', 'ex-con', 'who', 'still', 'time', 'time', 'even', 'keepsake', 'first', 'shiv', 'ever', 'used', 'stab', 'someone', 'played', 'companionable', 'charm', 'RZA', 'Wu-Tang', 'Clan', 'hokey', 'eye-rolling.Of', 'course', 'entire', 'movie', 'would', 'fail', 'exist', 'Schine', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'sensible', 'thing', 'go', 'cops', 'script', 'great', 'pains', 'explain', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'do', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'fact', 'further', 'film', 'went', 'less', 'bought', 'Too', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'clever', 'tries', 'circle', 'around', 'pile', 'plot-threads', 'tangled', 'mess', 'consequences', 'coincidences', 'even', 'great', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'it.But', 'can', 'still', 'hold']",N/A
641991,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JOL4,Mark,"[3, 3]","The first half of the movie is extremely impressive.  Clive Owen does a good job at playing the ""man of mystery"" or more of a darker character, and Jennifer Aniston does very well as Lucinda, and she also has an air of mystery to her character.  Before I get to the analysis, let's have a brief plot summary.  Owen plays Charles, a man with a life that's falling apart.  His daughter has diabetes, and he and his wife have been saving up for another kidney transplant with a better drug.  He has just gotten thrown off of the biggest account at his work, where he does something with commercials.  His wife takes his money out of his wallet and Charles naturally forgets to go to an ATM; enter a new, sleek and sexy Aniston.  She pays for Charles' train ticket (which I don't understand. Why doesn't he have to buy a ticket before getting on the train?).  One drink leads to another, another drink leads to a kiss, and the kiss leads to a grungy hotel room, like we've seen in so many movies.  Just as they are about to engage in certain activities, a mugger, played by Vincent Cassel (Ocean's 12), steps in, knocks Charles unconscious, takes their money, and rapes Lucinda.  After this ordeal, Lucinda convinces Charles not to tell the police, for fear of ruining both of their marriages.  The whole ordeal isn't over, however, since the mugger, whose real name is Phillipe, threatens to tell Charles' wife about the affair unless he gives him money.  This is the point where everything starts to take a dip in plot.  The movie stays interesting throughout the next course of events, of which I won't mention, but the end becomes so much like every thriller I've ever seen.  There is one twist, and then another, and the movie ends, a bit unsatisfactory.  There are two really good performances in this film, one by Cassel, who plays that French suave character very well, and the other, probably best, performance is that of the rapper RZA, who plays a co-worker of Charles.  He teams up with Charles to try to scare Phillipe.  His views on everything seem so real and truthful, and RZA really plays the part well.  As a film, though, I have to take away points for the mainstream ending, even if it isn't predictable, and the title suggests that there is a downfall (or derailment) in the main character's life, of which there is no such instance.  All in all, the movie is not bad, at least for a reccomendation, but it really isn't the best thriller I've ever seen.",3,A pretty decent thriller,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2470,"['first', 'half', 'movie', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'man', 'mystery', 'more', 'darker', 'character', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'very', 'well', 'Lucinda', 'also', 'air', 'mystery', 'character', 'get', 'analysis', 'let', 'have', 'brief', 'plot', 'summary', 'Owen', 'Charles', 'man', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'daughter', 'diabetes', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'saving', 'up', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'better', 'drug', 'just', 'gotten', 'thrown', 'biggest', 'account', 'work', 'where', 'something', 'commercials', 'wife', 'money', 'wallet', 'Charles', 'naturally', 'go', 'ATM', 'enter', 'new', 'sleek', 'sexy', 'Aniston', 'Charles', 'train', 'ticket', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Why', ""n't"", 'have', 'buy', 'ticket', 'getting', 'train', 'One', 'drink', 'drink', 'kiss', 'kiss', 'grungy', 'hotel', 'room', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'Just', 'are', 'engage', 'certain', 'activities', 'mugger', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Ocean', '12', 'steps', 'knocks', 'Charles', 'unconscious', 'money', 'Lucinda', 'ordeal', 'Lucinda', 'convinces', 'Charles', 'not', 'tell', 'police', 'fear', 'ruining', 'marriages', 'whole', 'ordeal', ""n't"", 'however', 'mugger', 'real', 'name', 'Phillipe', 'tell', 'Charles', 'wife', 'affair', 'money', 'point', 'where', 'everything', 'take', 'dip', 'plot', 'movie', 'interesting', 'next', 'course', 'events', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'twist', 'then', 'movie', 'bit', 'unsatisfactory', 'are', 'two', 'really', 'good', 'performances', 'film', 'one', 'Cassel', 'who', 'French', 'suave', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'rapper', 'RZA', 'who', 'co-worker', 'Charles', 'up', 'Charles', 'try', 'scare', 'Phillipe', 'views', 'everything', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'truthful', 'RZA', 'really', 'part', 'well', 'film', 'have', 'take', 'away', 'points', 'mainstream', 'ending', 'even', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'title', 'downfall', 'derailment', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'such', 'instance', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'least', 'reccomendation', 'really', ""n't"", 'best', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

It got slated left, right & centre - the film also started a rumour that Clive Owen & Jennifer Aniston were having an affair while she was still with Brad, especially since she was out pictured not wearing her wedding ring. A couple of months later, her & Brad announced their divorce, but not because of her infidelities.Derailed is a sort-of thriller, not starring Jean Claude Van Damme, but instead the afore-mentioned Clive & Jennifer. I hate Clive Owen with a passion, but thankfully he was working alongside Jennifer in this. Who's cool. Everyone says she can't play any other character but Rachel, which yes, is true, but what do you expect when you're stuck playing the same character for 10+ years? In this, she's actually playing Rachel again, but this time a much darker version.The film is quite brutal, and you genuinely feel for the characters, especially Lucinda (Jennifer) during the rape scene. Even if it does turn out to be a farce in the end. I read the book, but it was about a year ago, when Derailed was actually being filmed, and I honestly don't remember much about it now, but I certainly didn't remember the twist! The twist completely threw me, as I wasn't expecting it, although I was expecting something to happen. But my problem with Derailed is Jennifer's character does disappear for long periods of time, and we're left with Clive's miserable, one expression face.The cast are quite good, although Melissa George is seriously underused.

One day he meets a leggy Lucinda on the train through a mix-up with his train ticket.  The two start-up a conversation and pretty soon are meeting each other on the train.  Lucinda tells Charlie she is in an unhappy marriage and Charlie who is married himself debates having an affair with her.  Of course the temptation is too great for him so they schedule a daytime tryst in a downtown, shady hotel.  Almost immediately after they enter the room and begins some passion, they are surprised by a mugger who robs Charlie and rapes Lucinda.  Both of them not wanting their spouses to find out, decide to say nothing to the police.The mugger (Mr. Vasquez), aware that they will take no action against him starts to blackmail Charlie to get whatever additional wealth that he has.

Anniston wasn't all that wholesome in 'Friends'.  So that's a crazy statement all on its own.  Derailed-in a word is 'transparent'.  It was painfully obvious Lucinda was involved from the moment she uttered the words ""Some people don't appreciate what they have.""Plus how many Parisan thieves in expensive suits roam Chicago pulling hotel robbery jobs?  Plus Lucinda boast about her high-profile job and her being married to a broker--yet, the thief isn't asking money from her, too?  That was highly suspect.Charles' character was so weak I was stunned.  Plus, he was supposedly smart, but showed no ability to sit still for a minute and truely think about what was going on.  He was too busy reacting.  When his friend was shot, why didn't he flag down the police?  He didn't shoot the guy.

Basically, married ad exec Charles (played by Clive Owen) bites off a bit more than he can chew when he decides to embark on a dalliance with the dark and mysterious Lucinda (also married, and played by Jennifer Aniston) after a chance encounter on the commute in to work. Just as they're about to start on their very first journey into passion in a seedy hotel room, in breaks a violent stranger (played by Vince Cassel) and poor hapless Charles' life is never the same again.Sounds intriguing. Tell me more.Well, I adore Jennifer Aniston and I think Clive Owen is pretty cool too. What's more I'd already read the James Siegel book the movie is based on and had found it to be an absolute page-turner. It was literally impossible to put down. So I was really looking forward to seeing this on screen.Uh-oh. I hear a 'but' coming on.Yeah, well. It was a bit of a let down. It's a very well produced and well-directed film and the leads give some great performances (although there's absolutely zero chemistry between them). Vince Cassel has certainly grown up since the last time I saw him (in the classic French movie ""La Haine""Collector Edition 10 Years) and he seems to be having great fun acting the baddie. I just felt the screenplay adaptation wasn't quite as slick as the book's very original (and complex) plot was, and disappointingly for me, the character I was expecting Xzibit to play was moved sideways and played by Cassel instead - I suspect, to avoid certain sensibilities being affronted. RZA put in an unexpectedly good performance though.But most importantly, Aniston just didn't convince me as the evil femme fatale she was supposed to be playing, even though she certainly dressed the part and had her hair darkened to boot. Maybe it's her ten years as Rachel on ""Friends"". Or her ditzy 'good girl' roles in movies likeShe's the One,Picture Perfect,The Object of My Affection,Along Came Polly (Widescreen Edition), and of course,The Good Girl. She's tried valiantly to stave off being typecast but in my view she may just have to try a bit harder.So, no good then?Oh, I wouldn't go that far. It didn't do very well at the box office, probably mainly due to the convoluted plot and maybe partly because Aniston just isn't the box office draw she'd like to be just yet. But it's definitely an entertaining thriller if you're prepared to concentrate, even if you've read the book. Moreover, if you're a Jennifer Aniston fan like I am, you'll love it. I don't get the Hitchcock references critics and some amazon reviewers have alluded to but I'm a philistine where that kind of thing is concerned. I just watch these things.

In his native Sweden, he made Ondskan, which won worldwide acclaim. Hollywood imported him and, as Hollywood seems to do to so many of its imports, crippled him; the result of his first collaboration with the Hollywood regime is Derailed, a pale, derivative film that manages to take some of the best actors of its generation and utterly waste them.Clive Owen plays Charles Schine, a guy with a good job and a not-so-happy family-- his daughter suffers from a chronic illness. Still, he and his wife and daughter try to take things as they come. One day, he finds himself short of cash on the train, and is rescued by Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a financial planner at a nearby banking firm. The two strike up a friendship that seems to want to progress into something more, despite their efforts to resist. They finally break down one night and head for a local fleabag hotel, where they're mugged by LaRoche (Vincent Cassel), a scruffy-looking guy who makes off with Schine's identification, using it to blackmail Schine.The plot should sound familiar, and it is; all the twists and turns here you've seen many, many times before. Both Owen and Cassel have done much, much better work in the past; Cassel is hopelessly adrift in this role, while Owen only manages to get his teeth into it on an intermittent basis. (Aniston, surprisingly, outshines them both.) But then, that may be less a fault of the actors than it is Stuart Beattie's anemic script; I don't know whether to place the blame for it being a second-rate David Mamet clone on Beattie or the James Siegel novel from which Beattie's script was adapted, but rest assured someone in the house is a big, big David Mamet fan. And, of course, you can't have a thriller these days without having a big, utterly predictable twist ending.

642029,A3FNZQU6KBXWLM,B00005JOL4,Scott Delo,"[2, 3]","I read the novel this film was based on and couldn't put it down. I finished the 400 page book in a few days, which is fast for me since I usually take a few weeks to finish a novel. I went to the movie hoping to find they had done the story justice but that wasn't the case.The story deals with a  forty-something ad executive from New York who misses his train into the city and has to take the next train. On that train he meets the woman of his dreams. The man is troubled, with a sick daughter at home and problems at the office, and the woman is a sympathetic ear and a beautiful set of eyes. They meet for lunch and a relationship begins. Just as they plan to consummate their relationship in a seedy hotel room, a man breaks into the room to rob and assault them. The man starts to blackmail them and a cat and mouse game ensures.I think the main reason the movie didn't work for me was that the characters were horribly miscast. Clive Owen is way too young, handsome and fit to play the main character, Charles Schine. Charles was meant to be overweight, balding and a little insecure. He's the everyman the viewer is supposed to identify with. The actress playing Charles's wife was even more ludicrous. She can't be over thirty, which means she must have had their teenaged daughter when she was twelve. Jennifer Aniston wasn't right for the part of the woman on the train, Lucinda. Angelina Jolie or Monica Bellucci would have been a better choice, someone sexy, exotic and somewhat dangerous. She was supposed to represent forbidden fruit that is too good to pass up. A guy as good looking and successful as Owen could have picked up a woman like Aniston on his own and the woman who played his wife was at least as good-looking as Aniston. Worst of all was how they switched the villain from a black, Hispanic guy to a skinny French guy. I understand Hollywood's need to be politically correct but maybe they should have just made him Hispanic. The book made this character menacing to the point of being almost larger than life. He also had a foreign quality that unnerved Charles. Vasquez quite literally scared Charles out of his wits and I was scared too.

Charles is about to hail a cab back when she decides to go ahead. Taking a room at a seedy hotel nearby, they make their way upstairs. Just as they are about to consummate the affair, Laroche (Vincent Cassel, ""Read My Lips"") breaks into the room with a gun, threatening to rob them. But he quickly realizes his two victims are married people are about to have an affair. Laroche threatens to tell Charles' wife unless Charles pays him off. The only money Charles has is the money they have been saving for Amy's new medicine.""Derailed"" wants to be a cross between ""Fatal Attraction"" and any David Mamet film about a con. But the two types of films don't mesh. Here's why.In most of Mamet's films, like ""House of Games"" or ""The Spanish prisoner"", as the con progresses, characters may get killed, but in the end, these deaths are faked. Joe Mantenga walks in on the group of con artists and everyone, including the people who ""died"", is sharing a drink. The con men don't want to kill people, they just want the mark's money. This attitude is entirely consistent with the story's breezy tones, allowing the audience to chuckle at the final reveal. ""So that's how they did it!"" Then the mark sets about getting his money back, getting even.But director Mikael Hafstrom is going for something grittier in ""Derailed"". People get killed; people who are involved in the con and people who aren't. These deaths, and a particularly troubling act in the hotel room when Laroche enters, take the film to a darker place that it can't return from. Worse yet, none of the characters ultimately care that anyone was killed, making their deaths pointless. The violence only advances the plot in one way, to draw Charles further into the mess. Mamet's films accomplish the same thing by making the mark believe he is involved in a crime that never happened.Once the con is revealed, it doesn't prove to be all that interesting or original. So the next thing to grasp onto, as a reason for showing any interest in this film, is the two leads. Owen is okay, but his character is ultimately very weak. Really, he should have put up more of a battle against Vincent Cassel's character. They are more or less the same size and stature. Why didn't he land a good punch? I understand that Laroche has a gun pointed at him, but he simply cowers in the corner as Laroche torments Lucinda (Aniston). And Lucinda is fairly uninteresting. She claims that she never sees her husband, yet is concerned that he will find out about the affair. So why is she so interested in going to a seedy hotel room with Charles in the first place? Jennifer Aniston really brings little to the role. Initially, she doesn't even seem to be attracted to Charles. And after Laroche begins blackmailing Charles, Lucinda fades into the background becoming a secondary character.Cassel is over the top, showing far too much relish in the lines spouting from his mouth. It almost seems like he is exaggerating his own accent, for purely villainous reasons. Cassel is actually French, yet his performance reminds me of a bad American actor doing a bad impression of a French accent. A disappointing effort from this usually dependable person. And rapper, ""Pimp My Ride"" host, and burgeoning movie star (yes, I'm being sarcastic) Xzibit plays Laroche's henchman, complete with Peter Lorre stereotype, repeating things that Laroche says, simply to prove that he is a tough guy as well. ""Yeah, give us the money Charles.""The story of ""Derailed"" is filled with the main characters, particularly Charles, making bad decisions. If at some point, he said I have to go to the police anyway, despite what Lucinda and Laroche want, the troubles would probably go away. If he had bothered to say ""maybe I shouldn't ask the ex-con who works in my office to come and help me scare Laroche"" things would have been different. If he had bothered to make any sane, rational decisions, the story would, in fact, not exist. So, we have a story about a man and woman, filled with them making bad decisions. How interesting! Again, being sarcastic.In the early part of the film, much screen time is devoted to set up Charles' life at home. Yes, he has a hard life. His wife is busy and harried about all of the problems in their life. He has the sick daughter. We get it. But we also get the sense that he loves them and they return this love. Maybe not all the time. But there is reciprocation there. There are problems. But a lot of people have problems. So why does this prompt him to want an affair? By the way, they never get the chance to consummate the affair. So don't expect any shots of Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston getting hot and heavy. Just as they are about to get `busy', Laroche breaks in, putting an end to the tryst. As if that weren't enough, there are a couple of scenes with the family dog. These seem to be added for no other reason than to get certain people in the audience to ooh and aah. Oooooh, how cute. Look how cute.The production values of this film are also strange. More than a handful of scenes are set at the seedy hotel. The hotel looks like a set because it is so seedy and so over the top. Watching the end credits, there were a number of credits duplicated, listed between the US and the UK. I suspect that the scenes in the hotel were shot in England, on a soundstage. Why this was done, I'm not sure, but it gives the film a fake look which further detracts from any efforts to make any aspect of the film appear real.""Derailed"" is a completely unsuccessful film. If you are caught in a theater and subjected to it, a number of the people in the audience may cheer at certain points. These are the same people who laugh at the cute shots of the dog, who think Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston going to a seedy hotel for an affair is romantic, and retribution is best served with a 6 inch long ivory shiv.",2,De-readful,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,6723,"['Charles', 'Schine', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'day', 'downtown', 'Chicago', 'job', 'ad', 'agency', 'wife', 'Deanna', 'Melissa',

642041,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JOL4,Tom Benton,"[1, 1]","""Derailed"" was Swedish filmmaker Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m's first American picture. It stars Clive Owen as a man who is having an affair with a woman he met on a train, played by Jennifer Aniston. He's about to have an affair, anyway - because before they can get down to it, a man bursts into their hotel room, takes all their money, beats up Clive, and then rapes Aniston. When Owen returns home, the man calls him and demands $20,000, or he'll tell Owen's wife about the affair. Owen delivers, gets punched again, end of story.Or so Owen thinks. But then the man calls him again, this time demanding $100,000; earlier in the film it's established that Clive has been saving that money for seven years to pay for a new drug for his diabetic daughter. Yet again, he has no choice but to pay up. But Owen needs that money for his daughter, and finally he decides to turn the tables. However, things are not as they seem.Despite the harsh reviews it received upon its release, ""Derailed"" is not a train wreck. There are just as many good things as there are bad. Ultimately, it's a mostly dull movie with a few moments of genuine excitement toward the end. If you can make it that far, well done. You will be rewarded. Unfortunately, many people won't make it that far, because there's just no life in the picture. Owen is trying hard, but he can't hold the picture up on himself alone. Aniston is lukewarm in her scenes. The blackmailer, played by Vincent Cassel, is thoroughly hateable, but Cassel doesn't bring anything new to the role.The transition to American films for foreign directors can be hard even for the best of them (look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Alien: Resurrection,"" or ""Hard Target"" by John Woo). Under the circumstances, Hfstr&ouml;m does well. It's clear that he has style, but either not enough or not the right style for this particular film. Toward the end of the movie he lets loose and crafts a few thrilling scenes, but the rest of the movie is a dully-colored drama about people we don't care about in a situation that's nothing new.After all, Owen isn't like Lester Burnham in ""American Beauty."" He has a family he loves, and although it's lacking the romance it once had, he's not unhappy. He still kisses his wife, he still helps his daughter with her schoolwork. When he decides to have the affair with Aniston, they both know it's wrong. But they're turned on, and so they do it anyway. There's nothing special about these characters, and nothing to make us sympathize with them. The ""couple having an affair gets blackmailed"" routine is getting very stale. There have been a wealth of wannabe-seductive affair movies in the last decade, and ""Derailed"" offers little new.So in the end, is ""Derailed"" worth watching? Sure. You could do better, but you could also do worse. The twists which begin appearing about 3/4 of the way through the film are worth sitting through the first three parts for, if you can do so. As a drama, ""Derailed"" is stale and uninteresting, and as a thriller, Derailed offers a few scenes of excitement and a whole lot of the same old stuff. Ironically, the downfall of ""Derailed"" is that it stays on the track and never goes off in some interesting and foreign direction.",3,Blood on the tracks,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,3223,"['Derailed', 'was', 'Swedish', 'filmmaker', 'Mikael', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'first', 'American', 'picture', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'man', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'met', 'train', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'affair', 'anyway', 'can', 'get', 'down', 'man', 'hotel', 'room', 'money', 'up', 'Clive', 'then', 'Aniston', 'When', 'Owen', 'home', 'man', '20,000', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Owen', 'wife', 'affair', 'Owen', 'delivers', 'punched', 'again', 'end', 'story.Or', 'so', 'Owen', 'thinks', 'then', 'man', 'again', 'time', 'demanding', '100,000', 'earlier', 'film', 'established', 'Clive', 'been', 'saving', 'money', 'seven', 'years', 'pay', 'new', 'drug', 'diabetic', 'daughter', 'again', 'choice', 'pay', 'up', 'Owen', 'money', 'daughter', 'finally', 'turn', 'tables', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'seem.Despite', 'harsh', 'received', 'release', 'Derailed', 'not', 'train', 'wreck', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'bad', 'Ultimately', 'mostly', 'dull', 'movie', 'few', 'moments', 'genuine', 'excitement', 'end', 'can', 'make', 'far', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'far', 'just', 'life', 'picture', 'Owen', 'trying', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'picture', 'up', 'alone', 'Aniston', 'lukewarm', 'scenes', 'blackmailer', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'thoroughly', 'hateable', 'Cassel', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'role.The', 'transition', 'American', 'films', 'foreign', 'directors', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'even', 'best', 'look', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'Hard', 'Target', 'John', 'Woo', 'circumstances', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'well', 'clear', 'style', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'right', 'style', 'particular', 'film', 'end', 'movie', 'loose', 'few', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'rest', 'movie', 'dully-colored', 'drama', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'situation', 'nothing', 'new.After', 'Owen', ""n't"", 'like', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'American', 'Beauty', 'family', 'lacking', 'romance', 'once', 'had', 'not', 'unhappy', 'still', 'wife', 'still', 'daughter', 'schoolwork', 'When', 'have', 'affair', 'Aniston', 'know', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'turned', 'so', 'do', 'anyway', 'nothing', 'special', 'characters', 'nothing', 'make', 'sympathize', 'couple', 'having', 'affair', 'blackmailed', 'routine', 'getting', 'very', 'stale', 'have', 'been', 'wealth', 'wannabe-seductive', 'affair', 'movies', 'last', 'decade', 'Derailed', 'little', 'new.So', 'end', 'Derailed', 'worth', 'watching', 'Sure', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'worse', 'twists', 'begin', 'appearing', '3/4', 'way', 'film', 'are', 'worth', 'sitting', 'first', 'three', 'parts', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'drama', 'Derailed', 'stale', 'uninteresting', 'thriller', 'Derailed', 'few', 'scenes', 'excitement', 'whole', 'lot', 'same', 'old', 'stuff', 'Ironically', 'downfall', 'Derailed', 'track', 'never', 'off', 'interesting', 'foreign', 'direction']",N/A

642044,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOL4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Swedish director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m (`Evil') made Hollywood debut with this Hitchcock-type thriller starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston. It starts with fairly convincing portrait of a family man Charles played by Owen, who borrows $ 9 for train fare on his way to the office from another passanger Aniston plays. Their meeting on the commuter's train leads to a secret tryst at a seedy Chicago hotel, where things get terribly wrong.I mentioned the name of Hitchcock, but if you are an avid fan of his works or other thrillers, it is not difficult for you to predict what will happen to Charles in the film's next one hour. Vincent Cassel appears as gun-wielding villain whose unashamed overacting helps the film throw away any credibility built around the characters Owen and Aniston created, and bring us from realistic descriptions of married company executives to another world of potboilers and cheap thrills.As noir-ish thriller it is fairly good although it lacks real suspense. Some pieces of the puzzle - like illness of Charles's daughter or his career as teacher - are too conveniently fit in the convoluted story. The film surely keeps the ball rolling, but its drawn-out conclusion is hugely disappointing (with David Morrissey, yet another thankless job in B-thriller). There are some nice works from RZA and Giancarlo Esposito, whose interesting characters are wasted in this maze.I confess I enjoyed watching `Derailed' as a kind of guilty pleasure, like reading a paperback at airport, turning pages thinking `So what's next?' Though `Derailed' is set in Chicago, I know it is not about real Chicago and its people. Still Clive Owen made me feel otherwise just for a while in the film's opening that promised something different. As it turned out, I was wrong, but that's no surprise for the film is `Derailed.'",3,Fairly Good Thriller That Was Derailed Before It Reached the Ending (No Spoilers),1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1834,"['Swedish', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'Evil', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'debut', 'Hitchcock-type', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'family', 'man', 'Charles', 'played', 'Owen', 'who', '9', 'train', 'fare', 'way', 'office', 'passanger', 'Aniston', 'meeting', 'commuter', 'train', 'secret', 'tryst', 'seedy', 'Chicago', 'hotel', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'terribly', 'wrong.I', 'mentioned', 'name', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'avid', 'fan', 'works', 'other', 'thrillers', 'not', 'difficult', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Charles', 'film', 'next', 'one', 'hour', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'gun-wielding', 'villain', 'unashamed', 'overacting', 'film', 'throw', 'away', 'credibility', 'built', 'characters', 'Owen', 'Aniston', 'created', 'bring', 'realistic', 'descriptions', 'married', 'company', 'executives', 'world', 'potboilers', 'cheap', 'thrills.As', 'noir-ish', 'thriller', 'fairly', 'good', 'real', 'suspense', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'illness', 'Charles', 'daughter', 'career', 'teacher', 'are', 'too', 'conveniently', 'fit', 'convoluted', 'story', 'film', 'surely', 'ball', 'rolling', 'drawn-out', 'conclusion', 'hugely', 'disappointing', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'yet', 'thankless', 'job', 'B-thriller', 'are', 'nice', 'works', 'RZA', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'wasted', 'maze.I', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Derailed', 'kind', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'reading', 'paperback', 'airport', 'turning', 'pages', 'thinking', 'So', 'what', 'next', 'Derailed', 'set', 'Chicago', 'know', 'not', 'real', 'Chicago', 'people', 'Still', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'made', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'just', 'while', 'film', 'opening', 'promised', 'something', 'different', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'surprise', 'film', 'Derailed']",N/A

642046,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00005JOL4,Wanda B. Red,"[3, 5]","First, there is the contrived thriller plot, which drags on way too long, lacking in the energy it takes to manage the required twist at the end. Second, Melissa George (who reminds me of the young Sharon Stone) and Jennifer Aniston should have traded parts. The sultry George would have been much better as the adulterous Lucinda (what a great name), while Aniston, who really does better in the girl-next-door parts, was custom-made for Charles' wife Deanna. I understand that Aniston has more star power and probably wanted the bad-girl role as a stretch, but someone should have warned her off it.As it stands, Aniston just cannot be brought to deliver in her flirtatious part with any believability, a problem that undermines the film's very premises. She seems unable to decide whether to play the part with Hepburn-like wit or Taylor-like seething sexual steam (which unfortunately she does not possess). Of course, the script doesn't give her much guidance; her woodenly delivered ""I think I want to f*** you"" is a case in point. How was she supposed to say this line? It's anyone's guess. Also, it is just very hard to believe that the madly handsome Clive Owen would risk everything for Lucinda, especially when he has the smoldering Deanna waiting at home. Owen as Charles brings some power and intelligence to the task, but he is just not given enough to work with, and he does a pretty poor job of tamping down his irrepressible British accent.The film is mildly entertaining, and just a little scary.

I was very very much into this film, it held my attention so much tighter than any other film I have seen this year... and that's coming from someone who, SADLY and I'm Ashamed to say... was not really sure what to expect from Jennifer Aniston... don't get me wrong, she's an awesome actress... but the media and typecasts tend to put people into these little barrels of capability and it stings the audience sometimes!  But, like some of the other reviewers... I think we really, really have to give Jennifer her props on this becuase she showed what she is Truly capable of... and again, I am not downplaying anything she's done in the past because I happened to LOVE her in Leprechaun lol... a corny lil flick years back... and Camp Cucamonga (ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS) but what I'm saying is, she did her thing... she has MORE talent than I think she's been given the opportunity to display and I'm a fan, I can call myself a fan now... although looking back I've probably always been one, especially with Camp Cucamonga!!! but aside from that, the ENTIRE CAST of this film did a great job... I was a little disturbed at Rza's role, he gives me goosebumps, lol... but he did his thing as well...

642050,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JOL4,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","2005's ""Derailed"" tells the story of a man (Clive Owen) who's obviously lost passion for his wife and is dealing with the stress of a daughter with serious medical problems. On the train to work he starts a relationship with a woman (Jennifer Aniston) which slowly veers toward adultery. Things go from bad to worse. Vincent Cassel is featured as the love-to-hate villain.I mainly judge films by whether or not they pull you in and hold your attention. ""Derailed"" does this in spades. I was also impressed with the writing. Although another reviewer panned the writing as ""unbelievable tripe"" and ""horribly written"" the story struck me in a totally opposite manner. Okay, maybe parts of the story are unbelievable, in particular the ending's prison surprise, but how many movies today are truly believable? Some have criticized the story as predictable but I was surprised and impressed by the turns the film takes. And I never saw it coming.I'm not going to say anymore because the less you know the better.

642051,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,B00005JOL4,Zack H.,"[4, 5]","The critics disliked this film, and I heard that it was horrible, even one of the worst films of 2005, so I avoided this film when it was in cinemas. However, before I seen this film, I believed (and still do believe) that Clive Owen is an actor who can give a great performance, just watch Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" (one of the best films of 2004, in my opinion) to see how great of a performance he can give. Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand, had yet to impress me with her ""same character"" performances.""Derailed"" is about a man, Charles (Owen) and a woman, Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married, who meet on a train, and eventually fall in love with each other. So they wind up in a hotel, and decide to get a room, and then they begin to have an affair with each other. Soon after they get a room, they're interrupted by the bad guy, a french villian named Philippe (Vincent Cassel) who kick's Charles' butt, steals Charles' wallet, and leaves him unconscious, and then he decides to rape Lucinda. He decides to blackmail Charles, and Charles decides that the only way he can stop the bad guy from terrorizing him and his family, as well as keeping his affair a secret is by giving into Philippe's demands.Pros:-Jennifer Aniston has attempted to climb out of her ""Friends character"" shell, finally.-Those looking for a great popcorn movie, plenty of action, or violence will most likely be satisfied.-Excellent performances from Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel.-The rap stars performances in this film DO NOT RUIN THE MOVIE (for once).-Plenty of plot twists.-Good character development (especially Aniston's character).-You'll be cheering Clive Owen's character on in the last half hour of the film (and trust me, it's worth seeing).Cons:-The film's adverts practically give away the plot twists, so when you watch the film, you most likely know what is going to happen BEFORE it happens!-The film is too predictable, and if you want to enjoy most of the plot twists, chances are, you'll have to leave your brain at the door.-Jennifer Aniston's performance in the movie was somewhat difficult to believe, I felt like she was miscast.-Clive Owen looked like he could kick the french villian's butt at anytime, but instead, his character took all of the punches.-This movie would've been over in 15 minutes if Owen's character had a spine and common sense.-I couldn't believe all of the stuff Owen's character lets the bad guy get away with.-All Owen's character did around the bad guy was whimper and exclaim, ""Take all my money, please don't kill me"". COME ON! It's CLIVE OWEN! He was NOMINATED for the James Bond role!-This film has plot holes out the wazoo!-Before seeing the movie, I already knew who the bad guys were.I advise those who expect to see a ground-breaking thriller to avoid this film, because chances are, they'll be disappointed. If you're a fan of Clive Owen or Jennifer Aniston, popcorn action flicks, or a thriller film aficionado, this is worth at least a rental. Two stars for the excellent acting by most of the lead cast, and the ""keeps you on the edge of your seat"" ending.",2,"Derailed, indeed. *SPOILERS*",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,3103,"['critics', 'disliked', 'film', 'heard', 'was', 'horrible', 'even', 'one', 'worst', 'films', '2005', 'avoided', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'cinemas', 'However', 'seen', 'film', 'believed', 'still', 'do', 'believe', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'just', 'watch', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Closer', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2004', 'opinion', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'performance', 'can', 'give', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'yet', 'impress', 'same', 'character', 'performances', 'Derailed', 'man', 'Charles', 'Owen', 'woman', 'Lucinda', 'Aniston', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'who', 'meet', 'train', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'wind', 'up', 'hotel', 'decide', 'get', 'room', 'then', 'begin', 'have', 'affair', 'other', 'Soon', 'get', 'room', ""'re"", 'interrupted', 'bad', 'guy', 'french', 'villian', 'named', 'Philippe', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'kick', 'Charles', 'butt', 'steals', 'Charles', 'wallet', 'unconscious', 'then', 'rape', 'Lucinda', 'blackmail', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'stop', 'bad', 'guy', 'terrorizing', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'affair', 'secret', 'giving', 'Philippe', 'demands.Pros', '-Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'attempted', 'climb', 'Friends', 'character', 'shell', 'finally.-Those', 'looking', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'violence', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'satisfied.-Excellent', 'performances', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Vincent', 'Cassel.-The', 'rap', 'stars', 'film', 'DO', 'NOT', 'RUIN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'once', '.-Plenty', 'plot', 'twists.-Good', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'Aniston', 'character', '.-You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cheering', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'character', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'trust', 'worth', 'seeing', '.Cons', '-The', 'film', 'adverts', 'practically', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'twists', 'so', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', '-The', 'film', 'too', 'predictable', 'want', 'enjoy', 'most', 'plot', 'twists', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'have', 'leave', 'brain', 'door.-Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'believe', 'felt', 'was', 'miscast.-Clive', 'Owen', 'looked', 'could', 'kick', 'french', 'villian', 'butt', 'anytime', 'instead', 'character', 'took', 'punches.-This', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', '15', 'minutes', 'Owen', 'character', 'had', 'spine', 'common', 'sense.-I', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'stuff', 'Owen', 'character', 'bad', 'guy', 'get', 'away', 'with.-All', 'Owen', 'character', 'did', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'whimper', 'exclaim', 'Take', 'money', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'COME', 'ON', 'CLIVE', 'OWEN', 'was', 'NOMINATED', 'James', 'Bond', 'role', '-This', 'film', 'plot', 'holes', 'out', 'wazoo', 'seeing', 'movie', 'already', 'knew', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'were.I', 'advise', 'who', 'expect', 'see', 'ground-breaking', 'thriller', 'avoid', 'film', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'popcorn', 'action', 'flicks', 'thriller', 'film', 'aficionado', 'worth', 'least', 'rental', 'Two', 'stars', 'excellent', 'acting', 'most', 'lead', 'cast', 'keeps', 'edge', 'seat', 'ending']",N/A
