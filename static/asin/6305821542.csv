This DVD shines with thoughtfully designed chapters  (which allow you to jump past the intros, intermissions, and credits  straight to the content) and the highest quality video and sound.  The  picture is crisp, with the deep reds and blues that were clearly intended  for its presentation.In this particular series, after wrapping up the  cliffhanger (literally) from the end of Volume 2, a new character foil is  introduced in the chronicle of Vash the Stampede.  Wolfwood, whose history  is only hinted at, develops a comraderie with Vash that yields mutual  curiousity and occasional sparks between the two.  Overall, you'll be left  with the traditional Trigun feel - tough times, mostly nobody got hurt, and  hidden internal turmoil on the part of Vash.  More clues are dropped about  his origins...and more allusions to a love interest...Thumbs up!",5,What's New in Volume 3,965174400,"08 2, 2000",2000,950,"['Trigun', 'entertain', 'Pioneer', 'deliver', 'highest', 'quality', 'product', 'DVD', 'thoughtfully', 'designed', 'chapters', 'allow', 'jump', 'intros', 'intermissions', 'credits', 'straight', 'content', 'highest', 'quality', 'video', 'sound', 'picture', 'crisp', 'deep', 'reds', 'blues', 'were', 'clearly', 'intended', 'presentation.In', 'particular', 'series', 'wrapping', 'up', 'cliffhanger', 'literally', 'end', 'Volume', '2', 'new', 'character', 'foil', 'introduced', 'chronicle', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'Wolfwood', 'history', 'only', 'hinted', 'comraderie', 'Vash', 'mutual', 'curiousity', 'occasional', 'sparks', 'two', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'traditional', 'Trigun', 'feel', 'tough', 'times', 'mostly', 'nobody', 'got', 'hurt', 'hidden', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'part', 'Vash', 'More', 'clues', 'are', 'dropped', 'origins', 'more', 'allusions', 'love', 'interest', 'Thumbs', 'up']",N/A

This volume though introduces the character of Wolfwood, a man who becomes a major player later in the series.And Between the Wasteland and the Sky- Concludes the two part series of Vash's adventures on the runaway sand train. He again has to decide between killing and the personal ideals he seems to have set up.Murder Machine- Nicholas D. Wolfwood is introduced in this episode. A cross toting, chain smoking, child loving priest who can't stand to see a child suffer and is amazingly good with a gun. Vash and Wolfwood team up to save some lost children from killer spider robots. This episode also raises some more questions about Vash as he somehow seems to shoot several robots without a gun.Quick Draw- Vash and Wolfwood get entered in a quick draw contest and must draw against each other to prevent the death of a young mother. The beginning sequence is one of the funniest in the series as Vash proceeds to get his day underway and the events therein.This is one of the best disks in the series as it's before the action gets more serious and still has some of the same light hearted tone as Vash and Wolfwood bicker back and forth and Wolfwood flirts with Milly.

This is one of the most intense, funniest, wittiest, clever, and somewhat original series I have ever seen!  It has an extremely catchy soundtrack and you'll have all the tunes stuck in your head for weeks.  The new character introduced in this DVD, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, is a well-conceived, well-designed, good humored, likeable character, just as Vash is.  He is a priest who obviously has some past he (like Vash) is trying to atone for, but I won't go any farther than that.  More adventure, laughs, mystery, drama, and good times await you in this next DVD of Trigun!

Vash meets a rather jovial priest in his travels, but of course nothing is as it seems.  The first episode on this DVD, however, is the conclusion of the two-part series that began on &quot;Lost Past&quot;.This is probably the last of the DVDs that is totally devoted to slapstick comedy.  The rest of the series has comedy in it, but just not as much.  But the story makes up for that at least ^_^.Unforunately the DVDs still don't include very many extras.  Just a few weapon designs in this one I think.  Pioneer should have followed Bandai's lead.
