667177,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,B00005N914,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[20, 21]","Based on the novel by Luanne Rice, this positive family film deals with some hard issues: abortion, childhood disability, single parenting, grieving the death of a spouse and father, domestic violence, and substance abuse. That doesn't sound like a great mix for family entertainment, but although realistic, it is tastefully done. It is also is completely clean without swearing and doesn't dwell on the unhappy scenes. It has some good messages with a happy ending, and all the loose ends are nicely resolved. Probably the main theme of the story is the value of human life, but also that when you truly love someone you are willing to give of yourself.Dianne Parker (Kimberly Williams) and Mark McCune (Eric Close) marry and are expecting their first child. When they find out that their unborn child will be severely disabled, Mark urges Dianne to have an abortion. She refuses and Mark abandons the family leaving her to be a single parent. Mark's brother, David (Campbell Scott), is a friend of Dianne's who has been secretly in love with her since before she was married to his brother. He is conveniently a pediatrician and is a great help to Dianne. Worried for Dianne's heath because she is overworking herself, he arranges for Amy (Alexa Vega) to work as a mother's helper over the summer. Amy has a very bad home situation and her mother is an alcoholic. Amy develops a strong friendship with Julia, Dianne's daughter, to the point where they can almost read each other's minds.This movie has superb acting by all the cast, especially young Alexa Vega and Kimberly Williams. Alexa really steals the show! I also noticed that twin girls (Amanda & Caitlin Fein) play the part of Julia. If they are not disabled (and even if they are) they did some pretty good acting. The most disturbing scenes are those that involve Amy's mother's abusive boyfriend, especially the one in which he tries to kill Amy's puppy. It all turns out okay, but parents should be warned that it is pretty frightening. It is also disturbing when Julia has seizures and children may need some explanation before viewing the film. Amy's mother gets help and we realize by the end that Amy and her mother will have a good future together.I would strongly recommend this movie, but better get out the Kleenexes before the climax!

667182,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,B00005N914,Paul Sayles,"[9, 10]","I've seen this movie several times.  It was at the most recent viewing that several thoughts came to mind.  I worked in a major medical center for several years and on occassion my clinic would see children who were severely disabled.  I would think what kind of life were the kids and their parents having - spending many days in the hospital.  I still don't know if I have an answer but the film has me thinking about it again.  I can empathize with the husband not being able to deal with the catastrophy (from his viewpoint) of a disabled child.  My ex-wife was diagnosed with a possible cancer (ultimately found to be not a cancer). When she was describing how she was feeling (very very scared) I didn't know what to say so ultimately just sat there like a dope and looked at her.  Not my best performance as a husband.  This movie brought that scene in my own life back very vividely.  Watching the mom's helper after she had been injured in a car accident apologizing for not being able to take care of Julia and Julia's mom and her alcoholic mother brought back other memories of my alcoholic father and how at the age of 12 I was trying to figure out ways to make him not drink.  I never did come up with a solution but seeing the torment in the child (who was apparently younger than me) brought the moments of over 40 years ago back to me.  So for me, this movie was thought provoking on many issues about my own life.  I'm not sure that this is a movie for everyone.  Some have said it has a good ending.  I'm not sure.  There is a pending death and you won't if Amy's mom says sober.  There are uncertainties in this movie just like in real life.  But at the conclusion you are at least hopeful that things will work out ok for everyone.  Ultimately this was a hard movie for me to watch but at the same time it was beneficial.

667183,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005N914,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","Follow the Stars Home, based on the book of the same name by Luanne Rice, is the story of Dianne (Kimberly Williams), a young woman in love with handsome sailor Mark McCune (Eric Close). The two begin a whirlwind courtship and marriage, but when Dianne discovers that the baby she is carrying will be born with severe neurological and physical disabilities, Mark walks out, leaving Dianne to raise Julia (Amanda and Caitlin Fein) alone, with only her mother to help her.Mark's brother David (Campbell Scott), a doctor, offers to help Dianne raise Julia by providing medical checkups and support, and is worried about Dianne's health as sole caretaker. Meanwhile, Amy (Alexa Vega, Spy Kids) a girl from a troubled home, becomes a ""mother's helper"" to Dianne and her mother.The rest of the film plays out as a more-or-less formulaic story, with the prerequisite dose of angst, guilt, hospital visits, abusive boyfriends, and self-pity thrown in, before the (anticlimactic) conclusion. However, Dianne fails to fall into the ""martyred mother of a handicapped child"" camp. I personally know several acquaintances who have handicapped children (one has a daughter with lissencephaly who is nonverbal, cannot sit up, crawl, or roll over, and has multiple seizures every day), and Dianne's steadfast devotion to Julia at the expense of her own health (and occasionally happiness) rings true. It takes a great deal of courage and love to be a lifetime caretaker of a severely handicapped child, and Kimberly Williams' portrayal was one of the best things about the movie.Mark's role as the now-you-see-him, now-you-don't ex was less successful; his limited dialogue doesn't really allow much in the way of character development, and his subsequent appearances felt forced and unnecessary. David fares better as the loyal ""fifth wheel"" whose feelings for Dianne are largely ignored throughout most of the movie, yet he still gives his time to help Julia. Stage actress Blair Brown as Hannah, Dianne's mother, brought a degree of strength and wisdom that served as a direct counterpoint to Amy's drunken mother Tess (Roxanne Hart).Follow the Stars Home is generally family-friendly, with the exception of Tess's physically abusive boyfriend (there is a scene involving animal cruelty as well as physical violence towards a child). However, the slow pace and adult plot will likely bore younger audiences.Overall, this was a decent enough love story about mothers and daughters, second chances, and learning to trust that should appeal to fans of the original novel, and fits in well with the usual Hallmark Hall of Fame demographic.",4,"Formulaic tearjerker, but a heartwarming one",1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,2622,"['Stars', 'Home', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Luanne', 'Rice', 'story', 'Dianne', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'handsome', 'sailor', 'Mark', 'McCune', 'Eric', 'Close', 'two', 'begin', 'whirlwind', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'when', 'Dianne', 'baby', 'carrying', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'severe', 'neurological', 'physical', 'disabilities', 'Mark', 'out', 'leaving', 'Dianne', 'raise', 'Julia', 'Amanda', 'Caitlin', 'Fein', 'alone', 'only', 'mother', 'help', 'her.Mark', 'brother', 'David', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'doctor', 'help', 'Dianne', 'raise', 'Julia', 'providing', 'medical', 'checkups', 'support', 'worried', 'Dianne', 'health', 'sole', 'caretaker', 'Meanwhile', 'Amy', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'girl', 'troubled', 'home', 'mother', 'helper', 'Dianne', 'mother.The', 'rest', 'film', 'out', 'more-or-less', 'formulaic', 'story', 'prerequisite', 'dose', 'angst', 'guilt', 'hospital', 'visits', 'abusive', 'boyfriends', 'self-pity', 'thrown', 'anticlimactic', 'conclusion', 'However', 'Dianne', 'fall', 'martyred', 'mother', 'handicapped', 'child', 'camp', 'personally', 'know', 'several', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'have', 'handicapped', 'children', 'one', 'daughter', 'lissencephaly', 'who', 'nonverbal', 'can', 'not', 'sit', 'up', 'crawl', 'roll', 'multiple', 'seizures', 'day', 'Dianne', 'steadfast', 'devotion', 'Julia', 'expense', 'own', 'health', 'occasionally', 'happiness', 'true', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'love', 'be', 'lifetime', 'caretaker', 'severely', 'handicapped', 'child', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'portrayal', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'movie.Mark', 'role', 'now-you-see-him', 'now-you-do', ""n't"", 'ex', 'was', 'less', 'successful', 'limited', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'much', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'subsequent', 'appearances', 'felt', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'David', 'better', 'loyal', 'fifth', 'wheel', 'feelings', 'Dianne', 'are', 'largely', 'ignored', 'most', 'movie', 'yet', 'still', 'time', 'help', 'Julia', 'Stage', 'actress', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Hannah', 'Dianne', 'mother', 'brought', 'degree', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'served', 'direct', 'counterpoint', 'Amy', 'drunken', 'mother', 'Tess', 'Roxanne', 'Hart', '.Follow', 'Stars', 'Home', 'generally', 'family-friendly', 'exception', 'Tess', 'physically', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'scene', 'involving', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'violence', 'child', 'However', 'slow', 'pace', 'adult', 'plot', 'will', 'likely', 'bore', 'younger', 'audiences.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'story', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'second', 'chances', 'learning', 'trust', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans', 'original', 'novel', 'fits', 'well', 'usual', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'demographic']",Follow the Stars Home VHS

667185,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B00005N914,susannah,"[2, 2]","I have read the book and seen the film, and they are just okay. Kimberly Williams indeed is devoted to her severely disabled child, if a little unrealistically. NEVER a snarky, exhausted, angry moment from either her or her mother, not even one, and never a hair out of place either. In direct contrast to ""good mom"" is ""bad mom,"" Amy's mother. While Alexa Vega does shine here, she is indeed a very good young actress, Amy's story makes my blood boil.  Yes, her mother is a depressed, grieving widow but also completely emotionally neglecting her young daughter and the one who brought Buddy into the house even though she knows he mistreats Amy. Buddy was a bit sanitized in the film, as in the book he beats the puppy and Amy badly and then takes them to the bridge, where he throws the puppy off. Amy jumps off both to save the puppy and to escape Buddy, who is about to rape her. In book and film Buddy has endangered her child's life, yet all Amy's mother has to do is go to rehab, no legal consequences whatsoever, and all is well. I thought the scene between Dianne and Amy's mother ludicrous, when she was attempting to justify her behavior by saying, "" I drink to be able to sleep."" I wanted Dianne to stop looking sympathetically at her and tell her firmly that it was time for her to wake UP, that her boyfriend nearly killed her daughter.I feel this ""permissible amnesia"" sends a bad message, that no matter what you do or let someone else do to your child, to the point of murder, all that is necessary is to go to rehab, have every right to demand your child back, and supposedly live happily ever after.",2,The film is okay,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1619,"['have', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'okay', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'indeed', 'devoted', 'severely', 'disabled', 'child', 'little', 'unrealistically', 'snarky', 'exhausted', 'angry', 'moment', 'mother', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'never', 'hair', 'place', 'direct', 'contrast', 'good', 'mom', 'bad', 'mom', 'Amy', 'mother', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'shine', 'here', 'indeed', 'very', 'good', 'young', 'actress', 'Amy', 'story', 'blood', 'boil', 'Yes', 'mother', 'depressed', 'grieving', 'widow', 'also', 'completely', 'emotionally', 'neglecting', 'young', 'daughter', 'one', 'who', 'brought', 'Buddy', 'house', 'even', 'Amy', 'Buddy', 'was', 'bit', 'sanitized', 'film', 'book', 'puppy', 'Amy', 'badly', 'then', 'bridge', 'where', 'puppy', 'off', 'Amy', 'save', 'puppy', 'escape', 'Buddy', 'who', 'rape', 'book', 'film', 'Buddy', 'endangered', 'child', 'life', 'yet', 'Amy', 'mother', 'do', 'go', 'rehab', 'legal', 'consequences', 'whatsoever', 'well', 'thought', 'scene', 'Dianne', 'Amy', 'mother', 'ludicrous', 'when', 'was', 'attempting', 'justify', 'behavior', 'saying', 'drink', 'be', 'able', 'sleep', 'wanted', 'Dianne', 'stop', 'looking', 'sympathetically', 'tell', 'firmly', 'was', 'time', 'wake', 'UP', 'boyfriend', 'nearly', 'killed', 'daughter.I', 'feel', 'permissible', 'amnesia', 'bad', 'message', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'child', 'point', 'murder', 'necessary', 'go', 'rehab', 'have', 'right', 'demand', 'child', 'back', 'supposedly', 'live', 'happily', 'ever']",Follow the Stars Home VHS

The story setup, the arc of the plot, the characters and acting are all exemplary, but I had a real problem with the editing.

Not that car wrecks are ever expected, but in this case there was no setting of the scene at all: One moment two characters are talking in one place, and the next they're someplace else entirely and caught up in a muddle of jarring sounds and incomprehensible camera moves.
