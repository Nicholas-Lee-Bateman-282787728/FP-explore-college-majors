It's a shame, since Penn and Hutton give great performances (especially Penn).  The movie has a strong start, develops the  relationship between Hutton &amp; Penn's characters well, and offers  first-rate tension in their half-baked spy escapades.  However, just as  their plans unravel, so does the film as it devolves into Hollywood shtick.  Worst is Hutton's relationship: Lori Singer's portrayal of H's girlfriend  is so wooden she barely furrows her brow when H breaks up with her.My  biggest beef is with Pat Metheny's score.
