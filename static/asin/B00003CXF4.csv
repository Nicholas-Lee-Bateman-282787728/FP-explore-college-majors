523766,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CXF4,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","This film reminded me of going to the zoo.  Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life, freedom, and food, only when they arrive (like animals in zoo); they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation.  Food will be served at your captor's convenience, your captors determine the chain of command as well, and finally, nobody can leave once they arrive. After WWII, under Stalin's regime, Russia invites all defectors back to their homeland, but it is a trick.  Est-Ouest tells the story of one family's plight to escape a country that has transformed into a wall-less prison.  With the KGB watching their every move, our heroes must risk everything to see the light of freedom once more.  Living in a post 9/11 world, one cannot help but begin to see the similarities between what Alexei and Marie and the Arab world in America.  While not quite as harsh, we constantly are reminded about the vengeful eye of our government and the illustrious Patriot Act.Est-Ouest is one of those films where you could either be excited and happy by the results or be bursting into an emotional sea of tears.  From the opening credit sequence until the darkened words crept back on the screen, this film captivated me.  With the powerful acting, the intense story, and the brilliant work behind the camera, Est-Ouest will pull hard on your emotions and not release you until the very end.  Director R&eacute;gis Wargnier has done a superb job of bringing the history of the characters, as well as the land, straight into your hearts.  He does this with some of the most common techniques and a very simple story.  This is a story about love and freedom.  He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film.  There is this feeling of being in a non-barred cage, unable to escape, unable to be free due to the vengeful eye of your comrades.  Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters, from the beginning until the end, because they are no different than you are I.  They are placed in a situation like no other, yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.From our initial meeting with Alexei and Marie on the boat heading to Russia, we are bombarded with a sense of pride, love, and fear all at once.  We are unfamiliar with the relationship between Alexei and Marie, but immediately take it as a loving one.  Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals ... or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think.  Est-Ouest is more than just a story about escaping to freedom, it is a contrast between patience and immediate self-sacrifice.  Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately, she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom, while Alexei does as well, just not quite as quickly.  He understands the rules of the nation, and slowly sets in motion a plan that will give his wife all that he has promised.  It took me until the end of the film to see this contrast between immediate escape and patience.  While I thought that it was a great message to show, I felt as if the timing was a bit off throughout the film.  I had trouble following the timeline, while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events, the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son.  I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.The acting was gorgeous. Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire had such a powerful connection on screen that I could not keep my eyes off them.  When they were together you wanted them to be, and when they were apart, you dreamt of them being back together.  You cannot say that of many film characters.  The late Sergei Bodrov Jr. reminded me of a Russian Brad Pitt.  The way he carried himself and acted in this film was similar to that of Mr. Pitt.  Together these three key players brought this film to life.  While somehow Catherine Deneuve received top billing as well, she didn't seem to carry as much of the weight that I had hoped that she would.  While she was vital to the story, I felt she could have brought more to her character.  The depth behind her words just wasn't there or just didn't seem to match the emotion of everyone else.The only other negative aspect that I have with this film was that I felt the story seemed incomplete.  There were moments where we were given a nibble to enjoy, but never fully developed those nibbles into bites.  There were elements of the story that needed to be developed further, such as the relationship between Sasha and Marie.  While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up.  It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end, but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.Overall, I thought this was a very tight drama.  There were some flaws with may have caused it to loose its Oscar win in 1999, but nonetheless, the good did outweigh the bad.  The characters were intense, the story (outside of the loose ends) was captivating, and being able to see a darker side of the world was thrilling.  Simply put, this was a story about freedom and love, and those are themes that transcend throughout history.  Est-Ouest is a story for seeing the destructive nature of Stalinism and its impact on humanity.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Mother Russia's cold hand of freedom.,1125878400,"09 5,

523767,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00003CXF4,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[7, 7]","Regis Wargnier (who also directed the marvelous &quot;Indochine&quot;) gives us a wrenching story of a man who returns to the post-war Soviet Union with his French wife and son, and finds himself in the midst of a Stalinist nightmare. There is much pathos to the tale, but it's also a heart-pounding thriller at times. I haven't been so caught up in a film in many years.The cinematography (Laurent Daillant) is terrific and the score (Patrick Doyle) gorgeous. The cast, down to the last bit player is exceptional. Sandrine Bonnaire and Serguei Bodrov Jr. are absolutely superb, and Oleg Menchikov ! He was fabulous in &quot;Prisoner of the Mountains&quot; and &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot;, but here gives a subtle, many layered portrait of a man trapped by fate...perhaps his best and most astounding performance of all.A complex story that spans a decade, the editing is so good that the pieces fit seamlessly and the pacing flows...however, it's a film that should be seen more than once, as a lot falls into place on subsequent viewings.This is one I'm glad I own...for its glimpse into a period of history, its brilliant performances, and the sheer beauty of what a film can be when at its best.

523768,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00003CXF4,Andy Orrock,"[2, 2]","You'd never guess it from the usual misleading US release VHS/DVD cover box, but this movie is all about Oleg Menchikov's incredible lead performance.  Yet, he's pushed far into the background on the cover, with Catherine Deneuve's beautiful face taking up at least 50% of the montage.However, those looking for a good Catherine Deneuve movie may be in for a disappointment.  While her role is certainly vital, her screen time is about 10% of the film, at the most.The story is what drives this film.  It seems incredible...too bleak and far-fetched to be real; but, the story is based on real events.  Menchikov's performance is what seals the deal.  I had seen him excel in the Academy Award-winning ""Burnt By the Sun,"" and figured he was worth another shot.And how.  Just when you think you've got him figured out here - he reveals his hand to fool everyone in the film...as well as everyone watching.  It's a spine-tingling cinematic moment.This is far from a light, pick-me-up type of film.

523769,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00003CXF4,Anyechka,"[4, 4]","It's a shame this wonderful film seems to have gone out of print.  Though not based on a true story, there were many people like Dr. Aleksey Golovin and his wife Marie, Sasha Vasiliyev, and Gabrielle living in the decade immediately after WWII.  The film opens with an extended shot panning over the waves, setting up the important recurring motif of water in the story.  A boatload of Russian-born natives are returning to their homeland from France, having accepted the invitation by Stalin to any ex-patriates who left in 1917 to come home, with no hard feelings, and to start over again in rebuilding the nation.  Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Russian history would know they were walking right into a trap, but the people on the boat sincerely believed that things would be different now.  As it turns out, only Aleksey, Marie, and their young son Seryozha are spared execution or imprisonment after debarking, although Marie is initially accused of being a foreign spy.  Immediately she realises that coming there was a mistake, and doesn't seem to fully grasp the danger she's putting herself in by trying to leave or even by thinking she can leave.  She never fully gets used to their life in a cramped apartment in Kiyev, and befriends young Sasha, who moves into their room after the arrest and death of his grandmother Anastasiya, who raised him after his parents were arrested and executed as ""enemies of the people"" a decade earlier.  Sasha, a promising young swimmer, also is longing to escape to freedom in the West, and this idea of freedom is so important to him that he'll go to any lengths to achieve it, even if he might be risking his life.  The Golovins' marriage has become troubled, and after Aleksey has begun an affair with Olga, one of the many people in the apartment, Marie begins her own affair with Sasha, who is over ten years her junior.  (I wish there were more depictions of romances like this in the movies, an older woman with a much-younger man.)  They decide that Sasha will defect first, and then manage to get in touch with Marie's family back in France, who will arrange for her to escape.  They're also being helped by Gabrielle, a left-wing French actress who is touring in the Soviet Union and putting herself on the line as well to help them to escape.  Being the Soviet Union, of course, particularly in this ten-year period after WWII, things don't work out exactly according to their plans, but the dream of freedom remains, and even persecution and a term in the GULAG don't stop Marie's plans to somehow, someday, escape, no matter what the cost.This film, although it was directed by a Frenchman, really has the feeling of being a Russian film.  The constant fear, paranoia, deprivations, and lack of privacy are keenly felt, as are the working and living conditions in the Soviet Union at this time.  This was also a multi-lingual production; the languages spoken by the cast and crew were French, Russian, Bulgarian, English, and Ukrainian, and most of the film was shot in Kiyev, Ukraine, and Sofia, Bulgaria.  The actors used are also wonderful.  Aleksey is played by Oleg Menshikov, one of the finest young Russian actors working today.  He speaks all of his French lines so well and fluently that one would never suspect, until hearing the audio commentary, that he really had to memorise all of those lines phoenetically and doesn't speak or understand a word of French.  Marie is Sandrine Bonnaire, who is very popular in France and a masterful actor.  Gabrielle is played by Catherine Deneuve, who is quite a legend in France.  And Sasha is played by Sergey Bodrov, Jr., who was one of Russia's best and most popular rising stars in the Nineties and early Aughts.  (He was also quite handsome.)  Sadly, he was killed in an avalanche in September 2002 while shooting his latest movie.  Sergey was very effective and convincing as young Sasha, going through all of the emotions the character had to go through, even when, as is pointed out in the commentary, he had to do something that was totally against his nature in real life, like get really angry and confrontational.  Extras are an audio commentary by director R&eacute;gis Wargnier and screenwriter Sergey Bodrov, Sr., trailers, and talent files for Sandrine Bonnaire, R&eacute;gis Wargnier, and Catherine Deneuve.  The soundtrack is also incredibly masterful, powerful, and moving.This is a highly-recommended film for not only those interested in Russian history but also for anyone who appreciates a good suspenseful historical drama.  It's about the lives of individual people and how they were affected by what was going on in the Soviet Union in these terrifying years of stepped-up repression and fear, after the brief lull in terror and paranoia that had taken place during WWII, making daily life in the Soviet Union as tenuous and nightmarish as it had been during the Thirties.  And though it does have many authentic Russian touches, it does have a number of French touches as well, reminding the viewer that it's also the story of a Frenchwoman trapped in a world not her own, something which also gives it a somewhat lighter touch that one might expect from a Russian film.  As the title implies, this film truly is a blending of East and West in more ways than one.",5,A powerful drama,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,5308,"['shame', 'wonderful', 'film', 'have', 'gone',

It had such an emotional impact that at least one lady  was overwhelmed and required physical assistance leaving the theatre when  it ended.  &quot;East-West&quot; is a stunningly open  Russian/French-produced film about life in post-war USSR.  Although the  characters are composites, the story is based on cruel historical events.  When Stalin &quot;welcomes back&quot; all expatriated Russians, Alexei is  overjoyed to leave his long self-exile in France and sail to his beloved  homeland.  Aboard ship, he and his fellow passengers celebrate their  imagined homecoming to the glorious &quot;Workers' Paradise&quot;.  None of  them has any idea of the brutal changes which have occurred under  &quot;Uncle Joe's&quot; regime.  Only betrayal awaits them.  Upon the  instant of their arrival, they are thrust into a nightmare of  totalitarianism from which there is seemingly no escape.  Many of the  returning countrymen are arrested or executed as &quot;traitors of the  state&quot;.  Alexei, as a physician, is considered valuable and spared,  although his French wife comes under immediate suspicion and surveillance.  How their sudden culture shock, loss of human rights, miserable living  conditions, persecution, and bleak future inexoribly erode their marriage  is heart-breaking.  The film would be overwhelmingly depressing, but love,  hope, heroism, and sacrifice can prevail even under the iron hand of  Stalin.  I highly recommend this video.

Unrecognizable from her half wit Sophie fromLa C&eacute;r&eacute;monie (1995) as well as the sleuth in Chabrol's Au coeur dumensonge, she's radiantly beautiful here. Only later, watching somescant pictures at IMDb, did I realize that her nose, for instance,isn't exactly ""nice"". Good for her, her smile erases our rationality:).I found the film surprising, specially since the couple of maincharacters don't perform according to expectations. Aleksei, while thehonest bright physician, falls in the clutches of a believable Olga (asTatiana Doguileva) without much ado. And Marie is not immune to Russiancharm either, forgetting her son at her charge to boot.What I really didn't like is the heroic format of Catherine Deneuve'sactress turned ""freedom fighter"" Gabrielle Develay. As if the director,writer etc. had to erase with one elbow what had been (well) writtenwith the other one, this character comes out of the blue to be the only""hope of liberty at western capitalism"".

Besidesthe tricks for a Disney movie, the ""last minute efforts"", the stupidestguards on earth etc, I suspect the KGB didn't run the country or killmore than 20 million people and could have not realized that, forinstance, once Marie first gave sure signs of ""dissidence"" and then didwhat she did (Sasha), she wasn't going to try more mischief. So Sasha'sstory, from his swimming talents (like a bad Hollywood movie), thestate official realizing his family had all been traitors and him beinglet free to wander in the country, then his standing at the FrenchEmbassy like if somebody in his condition could really barter foranything (there were millions of people in the same condition).The dismal housing problems are accurately depicted, as well as thetroubles of ""too many people living under a single roof"". Of course,like in all big productions, visuals are fine (like Sasha's training ata beautiful cold river), as the epoch (the buildings, cars, clothing,the already mentioned crowded flat, even the ""expensive Bulgarianhotel"" looks, well... Sovietic and fadish!). The opulent interiors shotin drab color as jotix100 from New York writes at IMDb. Ah, the pettythiefs who ""find chicken around the corner"" and jewellry from arelative are sympa, they add some naive contrast to the dire Sovietconditions.

There is great revelry and a bit of nervous tension among the group on the voyage, but a general lighthearted optimism prevails.  The mood shifts when the passengers debark in Odessa, are immediately accused of being spies, and marched off to an uncertain fate.Alexei, the husband and father of our emigres from France, is a doctor and quite savvy politically.  He realizes almost admittedly his foolishness in returning to the Soviet Union and immediately takes steps to ensure his family's survival.

It's an odd dichotomy, unless one reflects how many card-carrying Communists there are in Tinseltown and how few Voelkischer Beobachter (the Nazi party paper) subscribers there were.The French have proven in recent years that they are superior in at least one regard to their American counterparts (all right, they're also far better at surrendering): they are able to view the legacy of Communism without flinching.

Alexei, a Russian practicing medicine in France, decides to accept the offer, and is accompanied by his trusting Parisian wife, Marie, and their son, Sergei. There's singing and goodwill aboard the ship bound for Odessa, but ... uh-oh ... those aren't beribboned girls bearing flowers on the quay when the ship docks. Those are soldiers and commissars, and the expats are divided ... some to the left, some to the right ... to be subsequently interrogated, charged as imperialist spies, or even shot. Welcome home to Mother Russia, comrades!Alexei and his family are transported to Kiev, where they live in a crowded collective tenement with thin walls and friendly, but watchful, locals. (The aging and sympathetic babushka serving as house supervisor is soon hauled off by local police muscle for speaking French to Marie. So much for a carefree atmosphere.) Sergei is assigned to a local factory to look after the workers' health. Marie irons shirts for the Soviet Army Chorus, Band and Dance Ensemble. Thus begins a decade-long dream of escape back to France.EAST-WEST stars Oleg Menchikov as Alexei, who, being Russian, realizes the only way to remedy his poor choice of family outings is to work surreptitiously and slowly within the system. Marie, played by Sandrine Bonnaire, being  more impatient and less subtle, is constantly rocking the boat with her self-centered breakout schemes. Both Oleg and Sandrine are wonderful in their respective parts, as are Serguei Bodrov, Jr. and Catherine Deneuve as the Russian swimmer Sacha and left-wing French actress Gabrielle respectively, who are the family's tenuous links to the West.

But instead of a man, a woman, and a child, the story revolves around a man, a woman, a child--and another man.Shortly after the war, Alexei (Oleg Menshikov, ""Prisoner of the Mountains""), his wife Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), and their son travel to Russia from France to make a new life for themselves. They quickly find that the situation in Alexei's homeland isn't quite as advertised and that they can't leave. Sacha (Sergie Bodrov, Jr., ""Brother"") is a young athlete who lives in the same overcrowded apartment complex.

Inevitably, Marie and Alexei grow apart as Sacha and Marie grow close, but one of the three is harboring a secret that won't be revealed until the end.The film does double-time as a thriller in that, at any time, any of these characters could be imprisoned or killed--including French actress, Gabrielle (Catherine Deneuve, star of Wargnier's Oscar-winning ""Indochine""). She befriends Marie during a tour of Russia and offers to help her and Sacha make their getaway.At its worst, ""East-West"" threatens to strain credibility, but Wargnier's assured direction and the sympathetic performances he elicits from his first-rate cast make for a believable and compelling drama.

Like their cousins the Nazis, communists believed  that if you smash culture (no more dead white males, anyone?) and society (family, courtesy, chivalry, faith) to bits and scrap archaic notions like truth and respect for human dignity you can build Utopia. The death toll of the various communist societies totaled something on the order of a tenth of a billion people. The cost to the human spirit of those forced to live under this horrid system is beyond calculation. By focussing on the tale of a French woman whose idiot husband believed the lies of the Soviet government and transported her and her child into this hell, we feel the full impact of the assault.

The year is 1946.  He's a Russian doctor and happily married to a French wife. They've been living in France.  But now they learn that Stalin has invited all Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s to come back to the great Soviet Union.  They decide to go with their young son.From the moment they set foot in Russia, it's horror all the way.  They've been tricked.  Most of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s are executed.  But the doctor and his family are spared because his profession is essential to the country.  They are forced to live as other Russians do now - in a small apartment with four other families.  They are constantly watched.  And the French wife is treated suspiciously because she is a foreigner.  Life is hard, not only because some basic necessities are no longer there, but mostly because of the lack of privacy and the constant harassment.  There are strains on their marriage.  They argue.  They make up.  They both get involved romantically with others.  Life goes on.Sandrine Bonnaire is cast as the wife. Oleg Menchikov is the husband.  And Catherine Deneuve is cast as a traveling French actress who does what she can to help the couple. Years pass. A young swimmer escapes the Soviet Union with the wife's help.  Punishment follows.  The audience sees the physical changes in the couple, a spirit of resignation.  But yet there is still hope to get out.  How this all plays out keeps the tension high as we follow the couple over a lifetime.  It's all very sad.  And very interesting.I enjoyed the snapshot of life in the Soviet Union because I had never seen it depicted so clearly before.  And the acting and  cinematography was consistently good.  The screenplay held it all together and I was never bored.The DVD didn't have extra features but the transfer was good and the subtitles in French and Russian easy to read.

It starts in year 1946 with a premise that all Russian expatriates living abroad since year 1917 (October Revolution) were invited for re-patriation back to Russia.  We see a group of Russians leaving France with great hopes of reconnecting with their fatherland, offering new government their skills, talents and love for the country in an effort to build a new society after the devastating war.  We know that this bait will end badly from the start.  As these naive citizens step on the Russia soil the tragedy hits: elderly are separated from the young, families are being divided and before we know it a young French man of Russian decent is shot to death from the back by the eager Russian soldier.  Main protagonist of this story is a doctor who with wife and a young son gets rude awakening of what is the future for his family.  Deeply devoted to his wife, he will do whatever it takes top protect his family.  As time passes and the differences and tension between the couple increases, wife is becoming more determined to escape Russian and get back to France.  In the process and circumstances around them, she establishes relationship with a young Russian man who happens to live in the same apartmens with her family.  Without desclosing the plot, we learn about two people so desparate for freedom and nothing to loose that will do anything to reclaim it.  Over a period of 10 years lives of all of them are so profoundly changed that is hard to believe how can anyone endure such oppresion.  It will take another 30 years after their escape until borders are open again and Russian citizens can choose to stay or immigrate to any country of their choice.

523788,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00003CXF4,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 3]","EAST/WEST(1999) Directed by Regis Wargenier.  Score by Patrick Doyle.Starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and Catherine Deneuve.In 1946, Communist Russia announced a general amnesty for all Russian emigres who had left the country before the Second World War and said they could now return in peace.  This was, of course, a lie.  Most of those who foolishly accepted this offer were immediatley arrested as spies, tortured and then either shot or sent to the Gulag to die a lingering death.This French film tells the story of one couple, a Russian physician and his French wife who, because the Reds need competent doctors, are spared and sent to ""live"" in Kiev.  However though trapped deep in the hell of the Socialist Worker's state, they are determined to somehow escape.One does.While perhaps ten minutes too long(The film is 125 minutes) and vaguely dishonest in showing a ""leftist"" actress(The film must repeat this five times) helping the couple where, in reality ala Jane Fonda, such a person would have denounced them immediately to the NKVD, this is a superb, highly intellegent and informed film. A French version of a similar story told in the American Clark Gable film NEVER LET ME GO, it is interesting to see such a picture made albeit fifty years after the first.  We are not talking courage here and the producers obviously had to bow to the Liberal commisars in promoting the myth that ""leftists"" were two fisted Anti-communists.But still some truth if however late is always welcomed and there is no statute of limitations on a good historical film.  The script(mostly by Russians--which explains much with contributions by a Frenchman which explains something else) and direction is extremely good in depicting life in the Worker's Paradise. So much so that even though there is a nominal happy ending, the film leaves one depressed over the millions of people trapped in a society where if one was not physically liquidated then one's soul would be and your life would be utterly wasted.  The waste. The utter horrible waste of the great Russian experiment in socialism smothers the viewer.The film's period feel is well nigh perfect. The score by Doyle is exceptional especially the opening credit theme. The acting especially by the two leads is very good.  I have never understood the allure of Deneuve and, in the smallish support part of the two fisted Anti-communist ""leftist"" who aids the couple I still don't.  The film does not suffer from any of the symptoms of modern film disease. No graphic sex, language or violence. Except for the anti-communist ""leftist"", there is no silly liberal propaganda. The word communism is actually mentioned if only once or twice. There is no CGI cartoons running about unless it was some backgrounds. Except that it is in color, the film could easily have been made somewhere between 1946 and 1975. It is that good.This is just a solid harrowing and close to brilliant historical epic about a subject that has historically been neglected and lied about in the artistic community.

523789,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXF4,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 10]","Though &quot;East-West&quot; (originally &quot;Est-Ouest&quot;) looks very political at first sight, the fact is that it handles with much universal theme, which surely moved the voters of the Academy and the Golden Globe Award to give it a deserved nomination for Best Foreign Film in 2000.  For all its apparent flaws, the film does not fail to move your heart in the end, making you think about how much people can take under the severest conditions to protect what you love.After WW2, many exiles from Russia came back to their native country, and among them a doctor Alexei (OlegMenchikov, popular Russian actor) and his wife Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire).  But as they land on the harbor of Odessa, they learn that everything is a lie.  Deprived of her passport, and suspected as a spy sent from the West, Marie decides to return to France.  While she survives the unhappy life in Kiev, being gradually estranged from Alexei, and her secret plans all end in disastrous results, her husband seeks for another solution.  It soon becomes clear to them that it takes much longer time than they first expected.&quot;East-West&quot; at its best shows the assured view on a family in this extreme situation, and their reaction to the harsh moment of reality.  Real history gives strong support as a backgraond, but what we are impressed with is Marie's desperate and even manipulating ways of facing the reality, and Alexei's more comlicated, apparently cowardly action to autocratic rules during the Cold War.  The changing relations between the husband and the wife is fastened by Bonnaire's strong performance, which suitably matches Menchikov's seemingly calm, resigned face.  Those two actors with a good story is the best virture of the film.There are flaws in this film, some say, and in fact the script seems sometimes melodramatic.  Some reviewers might complain the loss of credibility at several points, but as I don't know much about the facts about the historical events, I can't criticize those moments when we see a Russian soldier killing an innocent victim on the spot at Odessa, or a KGB officier torturing Marie tearing her passport apart.  It is certain that Russian bureaucrats look like caricature, but how could I know?  Let me say this way: the film IS melodramatic, but for all that the film does not fail to grab your heart.Whatever the complaint may be, the last scene pays off.  And pays off very much.  The film might have been better if it had taken a little longer time to bring everything to this conclusion.  (I imagined there might be a longer director's cut somewhere in studio.)  But, remember, the emotional power of &quot;East-West&quot; is beyond a doubt.  Helped by the grand score of Patrick Doyle (&quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;) and moody photography of Laurent Dailland, &quot;East-West&quot; is a triumph.A Russian swimmer Sacha, one of the key characters of the film, is played by Serguei Bodrov Jr., son of Serguei Bodrov, co-writer of this film and director of &quot;Prisoner of the Mountains&quot; and &quot;The Quickie.&quot;",4,Just For Love: Stunning Epic behind Pitiless History,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,3106,"['Though', 'quot', 'East-West', 'quot', 'originally', 'quot', 'Est-Ouest', 'quot', 'very', 'political', 'first', 'sight', 'fact', 'much', 'universal', 'theme', 'surely', 'moved', 'voters', 'Academy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'give', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '2000', 'apparent', 'flaws', 'film', 'not', 'fail', 'move', 'heart', 'end', 'making', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'can', 'take', 'severest', 'conditions', 'protect', 'what', 'love.After', 'WW2', 'many', 'exiles', 'Russia', 'came', 'back', 'native', 'country', 'doctor', 'Alexei', 'OlegMenchikov', 'popular', 'Russian', 'actor', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'land', 'harbor', 'Odessa', 'learn', 'everything', 'lie', 'Deprived', 'passport', 'suspected', 'spy', 'sent', 'West', 'Marie', 'return', 'France', 'unhappy', 'life', 'Kiev', 'being', 'gradually', 'estranged', 'Alexei', 'secret', 'plans', 'end', 'disastrous', 'results', 'husband', 'seeks', 'solution', 'soon', 'clear', 'much', 'longer', 'time', 'first', 'expected.', 'quot', 'East-West', 'quot', 'best', 'assured', 'view', 'family', 'extreme', 'situation', 'reaction', 'harsh', 'moment', 'reality', 'Real', 'history', 'strong', 'support', 'backgraond', 'what', 'are', 'impressed', 'Marie', 'desperate', 'even', 'manipulating', 'ways', 'facing', 'reality', 'Alexei', 'more', 'comlicated', 'apparently', 'cowardly', 'action', 'autocratic', 'rules', 'Cold', 'War', 'changing', 'relations', 'husband', 'wife', 'fastened', 'Bonnaire', 'strong', 'performance', 'suitably', 'Menchikov', 'seemingly', 'calm', 'resigned', 'face', 'two', 'actors', 'good', 'story', 'best', 'virture', 'are', 'flaws', 'film', 'say', 'fact', 'script', 'sometimes', 'melodramatic', 'reviewers', 'might', 'complain', 'loss', 'credibility', 'several', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'facts', 'historical', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'moments', 'when', 'see', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'killing', 'innocent', 'victim', 'spot', 'Odessa', 'KGB', 'officier', 'torturing', 'Marie', 'tearing', 'passport', 'apart', 'certain', 'Russian', 'bureaucrats', 'look', 'caricature', 'how', 'could', 'know', 'Let', 'say', 'way', 'film', 'IS', 'melodramatic', 'film', 'not', 'fail', 'grab', 'heart.Whatever', 'complaint', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'scene', 'pays', 'off', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'taken', 'little', 'longer', 'time', 'bring', 'everything', 'conclusion', 'imagined', 'might', 'be', 'longer', 'director', 'cut', 'somewhere', 'studio', 'remember', 'emotional', 'power', 'quot', 'East-West', 'quot', 'doubt', 'Helped', 'grand', 'score', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'quot', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'moody', 'photography', 'Laurent', 'Dailland', 'quot', 'East-West', 'quot', 'triumph.A', 'Russian', 'swimmer', 'Sacha', 'one', 'key', 'characters', 'film', 'played', 'Serguei', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'son', 'Serguei', 'Bodrov', 'co-writer', 'film', 'director', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'Mountains', 'quot', 'quot', 'Quickie.', 'quot']",East-West
