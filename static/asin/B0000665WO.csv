You can actually see some noise lines at the bottom constantly throught the whole opear. Of course the video and audio quality is very bad. I cannot understand the people who are giving more than one stars for this product either. The performance itself is not actually bad. But it is not good enough to justify the suffering from bad quality video and audio. I rented it from local library. I watched it skipping a lot, and immediately returned it. Buy some good CD for this opera (or LPs - which I have a couple of performances). It's much more enjoyable.",1,This is a bad transfer from an old VHS tape.,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,666,"['fully', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Dr.', 'Elizer', 'DVD', 'bad', 'transfer', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'noise', 'lines', 'bottom', 'constantly', 'throught', 'whole', 'opear', 'course', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'very', 'bad', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'more', 'one', 'stars', 'product', 'either', 'performance', 'not', 'actually', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'justify', 'suffering', 'bad', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'rented', 'local', 'library', 'watched', 'skipping', 'lot', 'immediately', 'returned', 'Buy', 'good', 'CD', 'opera', 'LPs', 'have', 'couple', 'performances', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable']",N/A

It is certainly not this one.  I purchased a VHS of the 1986 Parma ""Faust"" with Alfredo Kraus and the cast noted above.  It most emphatically cannot be the one to which my fellow reviewers are referring.  To begin with, I found the picture, even on VHS, to be vastly superior to many other live performances.  State of the art it's not, but it's perfectly watchable, and, at times, pretty darn good.  Moreover, I found the sound to be good enough to dub onto C.D. directly from the VHS.  Since Alfredo Kraus never recorded Faust commercially, I wanted this performance in a CD format as well as a VHS one.  With that established, I would like to say that tenor Kraus, soprano Gonzales, and bass Guiselev are all excellent.  The entire ballet sequences are included here, and, as I have already said, I can't understand that which the other reviewers are referring.  Is it possible that Amazon accidently posted these reviews to the wrong performance? They give the year as 1957, which is obviously incorrect.  Alfredo Kraus didn't incorporate the role of Faust into his repertoire until much, much, later (probably the mid 1970's).  I found this performance visually satisfactory and musically excellent. My only reservation is that there is some minor peaking in some of the louder passages ------- but no distortion.  Again I reiterate -------- this cannot be the same performance eluded to in the previous postings. I believe that these reviews were posted incorrectly.",4,THERE'S A MISTAKE - THIS IS A 1986 PERFORMANCE FROM PARMA,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1613,"['have', 'idea', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'page', 'are', 'talking', 'do', 'even', 'know', 'performance', 'are', 'alluding', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'purchased', 'VHS', '1986', 'Parma', 'Faust', 'Alfredo', 'Kraus', 'cast', 'noted', 'most', 'emphatically', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'are', 'referring', 'begin', 'found', 'picture', 'even', 'VHS', 'be', 'vastly', 'superior', 'many', 'other', 'live', 'performances', 'State', 'art', 'not', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'times', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Moreover', 'found', 'sound', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'dub', 'C.D', 'directly', 'VHS', 'Alfredo', 'Kraus', 'never', 'recorded', 'Faust', 'commercially', 'wanted', 'performance', 'CD', 'format', 'as', 'well', 'VHS', 'one', 'established', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'tenor', 'Kraus', 'soprano', 'Gonzales', 'bass', 'Guiselev', 'are', 'excellent', 'entire', 'ballet', 'sequences', 'are', 'included', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'referring', 'possible', 'Amazon', 'accidently', 'posted', 'reviews', 'wrong', 'performance', 'give', 'year', '1957', 'obviously', 'incorrect', 'Alfredo', 'Kraus', 'did', ""n't"", 'incorporate', 'role', 'Faust', 'repertoire', 'much', 'much', 'later', 'probably', 'mid', '1970', 'found', 'performance', 'visually', 'satisfactory', 'musically', 'excellent', 'only', 'reservation', 'minor', 'peaking', 'louder', 'passages', 'distortion', 'Again', 'reiterate', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'performance', 'eluded', 'previous', 'postings', 'believe', 'reviews', 'were', 'posted', 'incorrectly']",N/A

This DVD, however, is a 1986 production of Charles Gounod's grand French opera based on the first part of Goethe's work.  It was recorded ""in house"" by the theatre and not really intended for broadcast or release.  It's in color, but the lighting and camera movement is not of broadcast quality.  The sound, however, is surprisingly good and is in true stereo.  It seems to be a complete rendering of the opera, including the ballet.Despite its flaws, this is the best version of Gounod's ""Faust"" currently available.  The only other one, the 1985 Vienna production with Ariaza and Raimondi, has better video but is, in my opinion, a weaker production and leaves out the ballet.  I hope we will get a more recent, and hopefully complete, rendering on DVD at some point.Update 2012:  There's now a good recent version of ""Faust"" on DVD, the 2012 Royal Opera production with Gheorghiu and Terfel.",3,"Good, but outdated",1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,1000,"['reviewer', 'confusing', 'one', 'many', 'film', 'versions', 'Faust', 'done', 'straight', 'drama', 'DVD', 'however', '1986', 'production', 'Charles', 'Gounod', 'grand', 'French', 'opera', 'based', 'first', 'part', 'Goethe', 'work', 'was', 'recorded', 'house', 'theatre', 'not', 'really', 'intended', 'broadcast', 'release', 'color', 'lighting', 'camera', 'movement', 'not', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'sound', 'however', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'true', 'stereo', 'be', 'complete', 'rendering', 'opera', 'including', 'ballet.Despite', 'flaws', 'best', 'version', 'Gounod', 'Faust', 'currently', 'available', 'only', 'other', 'one', '1985', 'Vienna', 'production', 'Ariaza', 'Raimondi', 'better', 'video', 'opinion', 'weaker', 'production', 'out', 'ballet', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'recent', 'hopefully', 'complete', 'rendering', 'DVD', 'point.Update', '2012', 'now', 'good', 'recent', 'version', 'Faust', 'DVD', '2012', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'production', 'Gheorghiu', 'Terfel']",N/A
