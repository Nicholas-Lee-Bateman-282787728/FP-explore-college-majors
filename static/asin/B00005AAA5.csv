While the first movie was a little over the top what with its focus on letterbombing, this sequel covers the frightening new crime of identity theft. Michael Madsen is terrific as the criminal, but Lou Gossett really shines as the cliched but true character of a lawman who has seen it all.",4,Better than the First!,992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,367,"['second', 'underrated', 'series', 'U.S', 'Postal', 'Inspectors', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'what', 'focus', 'letterbombing', 'sequel', 'frightening', 'new', 'crime', 'identity', 'theft', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'terrific', 'criminal', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'really', 'cliched', 'true', 'character', 'lawman', 'who', 'seen']",N/A

I bought both based on reviews here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. Quite the contrary in fact. I found both movies very enjoyable entertainment. The acting is great, and the story, directing, and camera work are first rate. This movie revolves around identity theft. A ring of identity thieves is uncovered when one accidentally dies in a car accident. The investigation unfolds to a leader that is not only smart but deadly. I truly wish this had been a TV series or they made more movies. I think there are many more stories that could be told about the United States Postal Inspectors. This is another Showtime movie with good production values. Excellent quality DVD and great replayability.",4,The Inspectors 2,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,802,"['Great', 'follow', 'up', 'Inspectors', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'catch', 'one', 'bought', 'based', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'contrary', 'fact', 'found', 'movies', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'movie', 'around', 'identity', 'theft', 'ring', 'identity', 'thieves', 'uncovered', 'when', 'one', 'accidentally', 'car', 'accident', 'investigation', 'leader', 'not', 'only', 'smart', 'deadly', 'truly', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'TV', 'series', 'made', 'more', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'United', 'States', 'Postal', 'Inspectors', 'Showtime', 'movie', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'Excellent', 'quality', 'DVD', 'great', 'replayability']",N/A

IT goes away from the old cliche of &quot;expert investigator with a novice investigator&quot;.Instead of it, both Gousset and Silverman has solid roles and the chemistry between them is amazing. Madsen plays a terrific bad guy, also withou customary cliches.

576392,A3N1H8BSULHP3U,B00005AAA5,Nikki S.,"[0, 0]","This was a great movie!  It was suspense, action, and comedy all rolled into one.  The two main characters have a great rapport, and the plot is very realistic.  Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the U.S. and something we are all easily susceptible to.  If nothing else, this movie will teach you to buy a shredder to dispose of all your junk mail.  :-)I also enjoyed the first Inspectors movie, but found this one to be alot more interesting.  The Postal Inspection Service is a fascinating agency - they are a federal law enforcement agency, equal to the FBI and DEA in power and prestige.  Though smaller in size (only about 2000 agents nationwide), they have the highest conviction rate and have been in existence longer than any other federal agency.If you are interested in the Inspection Service, I would also recommend the Discovery Channel documentary titled ""The Feds - U.S. Postal Inspectors.""  Its a little hard to find and only available on VHS at this point, but very interesting.  One of the stories told in the documentary was the inspiration for the first Inspectors movie.",5,Better than the first one!,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1103,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'suspense', 'action', 'comedy', 'rolled', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'great', 'rapport', 'plot', 'very', 'realistic', 'Identity', 'theft', 'fastest', 'growing', 'crime', 'U.S.', 'something', 'are', 'easily', 'susceptible', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'will', 'teach', 'buy', 'shredder', 'dispose', 'junk', 'mail', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Inspectors', 'movie', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'alot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Postal', 'Inspection', 'Service', 'fascinating', 'agency', 'are', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'equal', 'FBI', 'DEA', 'power', 'prestige', 'Though', 'smaller', 'size', 'only', '2000', 'agents', 'nationwide', 'have', 'highest', 'conviction', 'rate', 'have', 'been', 'existence', 'longer', 'other', 'federal', 'agency.If', 'are', 'interested', 'Inspection', 'Service', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Feds', 'U.S', 'Postal', 'Inspectors', 'little', 'hard', 'find', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'point', 'very', 'interesting', 'One', 'stories', 'told', 'documentary', 'was', 'inspiration', 'first', 'Inspectors', 'movie']",N/A
