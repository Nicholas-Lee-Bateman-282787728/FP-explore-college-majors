My sister and I first watched this when I was in high school in the 90s and I immediately fell in love with the Village People.

It also has so many lines that you just can't help repeating (""I didn't invent it, I'm just in it!"" ""Leathermen don't get nervous, leathermen don't get nervous!"", etc).

349423,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,6302990106,Charles S. Houser,"[2, 4]","It pains me not to give this movie five stars. What a magnificent failure! What fluff and froth! The perfect movie to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon...or at 2:00 am when you find yourself suddenly awake and incapable of going back to sleep. CSTM is ""quicker picker-upper"" Nancy Walker's sole directorial effort (she's quoted on the DVD extra, ""The Village People Story,"" as defining movies as ""nothing but little pieces of ... snipped together""). Like Mae West's 1978 box office dud, ""Sextette,"" CSTM has just about everything you'd expect to find in a camp classic (beautiful men, clever women, music, over-produced self-spoofing dance numbers, costumes, costumes, and more costumes)...everything except wit, that is. But camp humor is most successful when directed against a staid and self-satisfied oppressive regime. And CSTM (like ""Sextette"" before it) was conceived when disco was thriving, acceptance of gay and bi culture was at its peak, and most people still believed ""whatever people did was okay as long as they didn't hurt anyone."" Double entendres just don't have a reason to exist when there is no moral overlord to subvert. By the time CSTM was released in 1980, disco was as dead as Duncan in Act 2, Scene 3 of ""Macbeth."" A year later, rumors of a ""gay cancer"" would change the mood of the gay community forever (in fact, a decade later AIDS would take the life of Jacques Morali, one of CSTM's creators).One wonders who Walker turned to for advice while making this film. It is a veritable Cornell box of filmic allusions (one thinks immediately of her own explanation of what she was doing). In defter hand, say Truffaut's, these efforts might be considered homages. But in Walker's, they seem to be more the bold thievings of a street Arab desperate to grab anything that might be sellable. Among the plundered are: Busby Berkeley (especially, ""The Gang's All Here""), Howard Hawks (compare the YMCA number with Jane Russell's efforts to play games with the Olympic team in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""), ""My Sister Eileen"" (does anyone in Greenwich Village have an apartment the size of the ones in these two movies?), and every Mick and Judy ""gee, it would be swell to put on a show"" MGM musical. And then there's Marilyn Sokol, who turns in a fine performance in the Nancy Walker role of the homely-but-horny sidekick of the beautiful blonde lead. The Village People were great just being themselves. The only real disappointment was Bruce Jenner. He's not an actor and he has a high nasal voice that seems at odds with his athletic physique. One wonders if co-star Valerie Perrine wasn't speaking to Jenner the actor, rather than to his character, when she said, ""It takes more than a pretty face.""My one remaining question is, if ""Can't Stop the Music"" is finally out on DVD, can ""Valley of the Dolls"" be far behind?

349424,AOG3PL8VB0Q6O,6302990106,Christopher,"[0, 0]","Camp is tricky. It's often difficult to separate the creator of the joke from the subject. ""Can't Stop the Music"" is camp, and the Village People are camp, so it might seem  a perfect match. But this is a funny movie because it's bad, while the Village People were generally a funny group because they were entertaining.I have a nostalgic affection for the Village People. They parodied the clone culture of the 70's--the first out, proud, masculine gay culture America had seen--but they were also the visual embodiment of it. They were camp in the truest sense, in that they (or more accurately, their creator, Jacques Morali) conveyed something important through frivolity and playfulness. To paraphrase Christopher Isherwood, they weren't making fun of something, they were making fun *out of* something.And watching them here, they're still entertaining. Arlene Phillips' choreography works well and the songs themselves are enjoyable--the movie flopped, but the sountrack did a lot better, much like ""Xanadu."" If you're watching for the numbers, it's pretty good.But the movie is also a lot like porn: if it gives you what you want, it also gives you a lot of what you don't, all of it as ineptly as possible. It has the Village People, some good character actors, and even a few good jokes (better than the first 15 minutes would lead you to expect). But it's a  mess. Almost no plot point is motivated by logic. Characters make contradictory decisions just to keep things rolling. Alan Carr hired an almost entirely inexperienced cast and then put them in the hands of Nancy Walker, an almost entirely inexperienced director. So they screech their lines and overplay their scenes. It's not the performers' fault. Maybe it's not Walker's fault. But watching the movie is like watching Paula Prentiss' android replacement go berserk near the end of ""The Stepford Wives"": a machine built for pleasure has flown hopelessly out of control, and doesn't look like it would have provided much pleasure to begin with.It's scitzoid. The whole movie has a weird sexual/non-sexual vibe. Early on, the movie plays up hot times, with disco dancing staged to look like sex. But then the middle section veers towards the chaste and innocent. Gutenberg supposedly wants roommate Perrine, but he half-grabs her with a nervous joke, like a 13 year old trying to touch a girl for the first time. When she asks what happened to his stewardesses (in the 70's sleeping with stewardesses was the generic swinger image), he says he's given up sex for his music. But he's just  hit on her. The Village People become babes in the woods; they aren't straight, and they aren't gay, they're just amorphously hanging out. A Perrine and Bruce Jenner hetero love story starts and stops, for no real reasons (and more contradictions: he's getting divorced and wants to live freely, but he chases her even if he does't like how she lives, and suddenly at the end proposes marriage...did the divorce ever go through?). Still, there are lots of gay stereotypes: references to Garbo, to Micky-Judy musicals, shots of half-naked young men, and two, count 'em, two hovering, smothering mothers (their sons are so embarrassed but still love them) who solve all the movie's problems.The ""what are they trying to say"" chaos becomes mindboggling if you bother to think about it. The finale is set at a San Francisco bash BUT it's hosted by prim, conservatively dressed ladies BUT it takes place at a supposedly wild disco one character describes as ""one of the kinkiest things I've ever seen"" BUT we never see anything kinky.Carr actually took over direction for the YMCA number, and then it really does become porn. If you want to see a lot of anonymously sexy men naked and/or flexing, you get your fill. I got no problem looking at beautiful men, but the scene misses the point of the song: it kills the joke, and oddly enough doesn't relate the  content (which encourages a young man to stop sulking and find his place in the gay community; it's a joke, but it's also about finding yourself. The staging for the movie is just a sausage fest.)You can't help laughing and enjoying the mess of it, but it's also one of those no-win bad movie situations: only Alan Carr would have made a Village People movie, but almost anyone else could have made a *good* Village People movie. Still, you can enjoy the songs and the silliness. The movie's a botch, but it works in spite of itself. I have to admit I enjoy it.",4,"In a weird way, it's enjoyable",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,4475,"['Camp', 'tricky', 'often', 'difficult', 'separate', 'creator', 'joke', 'subject', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Music', 'camp', 'Village', 'People', 'are', 'camp', 'might', 'seem', 'perfect', 'match', 'funny', 'movie', 'bad', 'Village', 'People', 'were', 'generally', 'funny', 'group', 'were', 'entertaining.I', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'affection', 'Village', 'People', 'parodied', 'clone', 'culture', '70', 'first', 'out', 'proud', 'masculine', 'gay', 'culture', 'America', 'had', 'seen', 'were', 'also', 'visual', 'embodiment', 'were', 'camp', 'truest', 'sense', 'more', 'accurately', 'creator', 'Jacques', 'Morali', 'conveyed', 'something', 'important', 'frivolity', 'playfulness', 'paraphrase', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'were', ""n't"", 'making', 'fun', 'something', 'were', 'making', 'fun', 'of*', 'something.And', 'watching', 'here', ""'re"", 'still', 'entertaining', 'Arlene', 'Phillips', 'choreography', 'well', 'songs', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'flopped', 'sountrack', 'did', 'lot', 'better', 'much', 'Xanadu', ""'re"", 'watching', 'numbers', 'pretty', 'good.But', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'porn', 'what', 'want', 'also', 'lot', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'as', 'ineptly', 'possible', 'Village', 'People', 'good', 'character', 'actors', 'even', 'few', 'good', 'jokes', 'better', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'would', 'lead', 'expect', 'mess', 'Almost', 'plot', 'point', 'motivated', 'logic', 'Characters', 'make', 'contradictory', 'decisions', 'just', 'keep', 'things', 'rolling', 'Alan', 'Carr', 'hired', 'almost', 'entirely', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'then', 'put', 'hands', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'almost', 'entirely', 'inexperienced', 'director', 'screech', 'lines', 'overplay', 'scenes', 'not', 'performers', 'fault', 'not', 'Walker', 'fault', 'watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'android', 'replacement', 'go', 'berserk', 'end', 'Stepford', 'machine', 'built', 'pleasure', 'flown', 'hopelessly', 'control', ""n't"", 'look', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'much', 'pleasure', 'begin', 'with.It', 'scitzoid', 'whole', 'movie', 'weird', 'sexual/non-sexual', 'vibe', 'Early', 'movie', 'up', 'hot', 'times', 'disco', 'dancing', 'staged', 'look', 'sex', 'then', 'middle', 'section', 'veers', 'towards', 'chaste', 'innocent', 'Gutenberg', 'supposedly', 'roommate', 'Perrine', 'nervous', 'joke', '13', 'year', 'old', 'trying', 'touch', 'girl', 'first', 'time', 'When', 'what', 'happened', 'stewardesses', '70', 'sleeping', 'stewardesses', 'was', 'generic', 'swinger', 'image', 'given', 'up', 'sex', 'music', 'just', 'hit', 'Village', 'People', 'become', 'babes', 'woods', 'are', ""n't"", 'straight', 'are', ""n't"", 'gay', ""'re"", 'just', 'amorphously', 'hanging', 'out', 'Perrine', 'Bruce', 'Jenner', 'hetero', 'love', 'story', 'starts', 'stops', 'real', 'reasons', 'more', 'contradictions', 'getting', 'divorced', 'live', 'freely', 'even', 'how', 'suddenly', 'end', 'marriage', 'did', 'divorce', 'ever', 'go', 'Still', 'are', 'lots', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'references', 'Garbo', 'Micky-Judy', 'musicals', 'shots', 'half-naked', 'young', 'men', 'two', 'count', 'two', 'hovering', 'smothering', 'mothers', 'sons', 'are', 'so', 'embarrassed', 'still', 'love', 'who', 'solve', 'movie', 'problems.The', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'chaos', 'mindboggling', 'bother', 'think', 'finale', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bash', 'BUT', 'hosted', 'prim', 'conservatively', 'dressed', 'ladies', 'BUT', 'place', 'supposedly', 'wild', 'disco', 'one', 'character', 'one', 'kinkiest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'kinky.Carr', 'actually', 'took', 'over', 'direction', 'YMCA', 'number', 'then', 'really', 'become', 'porn', 'want', 'see', 'lot', 'anonymously', 'sexy', 'men', 'naked', 'and/or', 'flexing', 'get', 'fill', 'got', 'problem', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'men', 'scene', 'point', 'song', 'joke', 'oddly', 'enough', ""n't"", 'relate', 'content', 'young', 'man', 'stop', 'sulking', 'find', 'place', 'gay', 'community', 'joke', 'also', 'finding', 'staging', 'movie', 'just', 'sausage', 'fest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'enjoying', 'mess', 'also', 'one', 'no-win', 'bad', 'movie', 'situations', 'only', 'Alan', 'Carr', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Village', 'People', 'movie', 'almost', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'made', '*good*', 'Village', 'People', 'movie', 'Still', 'can', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'silliness', 'movie', 'botch', 'spite', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoy']",N/A
349425,A231ZCJGWZA38A,6302990106,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[31, 31]","Considering that this movie has managed, as a result of its incredibly dismal box office record back in 1980, to end any ideas that Hollywood  might have about future movie musicals, it's a mystery that Criterion  hasn't picked this up for remastering and augmentation with countless extra  features (both the director and the producer have since passed away, so the  time is right...hello, Criterion! ).  Besides, if they can release that  awful sci-fi flick &quot;Armageddon&quot; on a double-DVD set, they can  surely strike gold with this movie.What more can be said about this  ill-timed disco musical fantasy/biography that hasn't already been  mentioned?  I remember paying to see this in a theater where I was the only  soul in attendance!  It was pretty bad then, and it's just as bad now, if  not worse.The film retells the formation of the Village People.  They star as themselves (before the big 1980/1981 personnel change, anyway)  and are accompanied by Steve Guttenberg who's terrible, Valerie Perrine  who's even worse, and Bruce Jenner before his face-feminizing plastic  surgery.  The storyline is pure fantasy (it IS a musical, isn't it?), and  the acting is really bottom-of-the-barrel--it's no wonder I haven't seen  any of these people ever do anything else--.  Ahh, but there's the sweet  disco music that more than makes up for the actors' shortcomings!That  this movie was directed by Nancy Walker (of &quot;Rhoda&quot; fame) should  tell you something.  Some moments are so bad, you'll be screaming in  disbelief.  The scene in which the construction worker dreams of being  attacked by beautiful women is hilarious (yeah, like we believe that one!).  The YMCA scenes will cause your jaw to drop...the slow motion, the split  screen, the mirrored images, and the Esther Williams-like pool plunge must  be seen to be believed!  The musical milk commercial that seems to go on  forever.  The baton-on-fire-twirling mustached man in tight gold lame  shorts who proudly states, &quot;James is my name, and flaming's my  game!&quot; (I kid you not!).  And, as someone else mentioned, Valerie's  non-melting double-scoop ice cream cone whose chocolate and vanilla flavors  switch positions randomly and which can be easily waived about with no fear  of falling to the ground.  And it goes on and on...the fun never ends.  Amazing!So, now that I've railed on and on about the movie, why did I  give it 5 stars?  For the simple reason that no movie could have purposely  been done with the idea that it would end up this bad.  Somebody somwhere  definitely thought this was a commercially feasible movie.  That alone  deserves five stars.  But the fact that you will be on the floor laughing  your head off when you see this is enough.

349428,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,6302990106,Dave Beards,"[7, 9]","I dinstictly remember when 'Can't Stop The Music' was released in Australia. The popularity of The Village People and disco music in general was at an all time, so it's not surprising that the movie reached number 1 at the Australian box office. I was eight years old, and the Village People were my favourite group. When I got to see my heros on the big screen I was elated - I remember walking out of the cinema feeling so happy and wonderful for days after. I still have my copy of the soundtrack record all these years later....So it is with saddness that now, rediscovering the Village People once again through CD and DVD, that I read such bad reviews and comments about this movie. Is it a 'good' movie?? Depends on how you define 'good' - sure the movie has hamy acting, a paper thin plot, many continuity errors and a real sense of fantasy about it, but it also has the wonderful theme that dreams can come true. Can't Stop The Music also captures a period in history (1980) where there was still a shred of innocence left before the emotional and financial corruption of the 80's really came into prominence.The movie will certainly appeal to many gay men such as myself. There are many subtle (and some not so subtle) gay references that Can't Stop The Music could be called the ultimate gay musical! I can certainly relate the overall campiness of the movie, as well as look longingly towards an era where body hair was actually considering desirable on a gay man!For such a commercially unsuccessful movie, it is wonderful to see that effort has been made to release Can't Stop The Music on a well packaged DVD. Firstly we get a remixed audio soundtrack to take full advantage of home theatre systems, a high quality, clean widescreen transfer and good packaging. However the extras are somewhat disappointing. We get the usual trailer (which is interesting from a historical perspective to see how films were promoted in 1980), a photogallery (which includes not only the usual promo shots, but some candid shots of the Village People on the set) and a 'photoessay' which is a series of static text screens describing the Village People story accompanied by a few photographs. Whilst the extras are interesting (and considering the age and lack of commercial success of the film it is amazing we get anything at all), I think more effort could have been put into providing something extra special to the fans of the movie. The E! Network did a behind the scenes' special about the Village People in 2000 with recent interviews so it would have been nice to get at least an edited version of that. But kudos to the distributors for at least attempting to provide a decent set of extras.This movie has no drugs, violence, death or negative imagery-  just good, clean, campy fun.

In the lead role is a miraculously flame-retardant Steve Guttenberg, whose film career survived this Discossault against all logic. The acting career of Bruce Jenner, whose ill-advised sashay through the village in shorty-shorts and a half-shirt will forever live in infamy? Not so much. Hindsight, as poor Bruce no-doubt laments to this day, is indeed a beyotch.What is perhaps most remarkable about this film (aside from the blizzard of blow that had to have been trucked in for the shoot) is that first-and-last-time director Nancy Walker - yes, THAT Nancy Walker - manages to create what is arguably the gayest film ever made, without ever actually broaching the subject. Indeed, the mind-bogglingly homoerotic YMCA sequence alone has the power to elevate the legendary Walker to the loftiest of honorary homo heights. The sequence, which features all of the can't-even-act-it-away group trying to play it straight in a hot tub with a topless Valerie Perrine, is so queer that if one were to come across a crystalled pink leprechaun face down in a rainbow sling at a Montreal bathhouse, snorting poppers and greased halfway up his back in liquified Crisco, you *might* be in the neighborhood.Rent, don't buy this DVD, and play with care around small animals, impressionable children, and bi-curious clergy.

349432,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302990106,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There was a strange, off-kilter period of cinematic eclipse from 1979-80 which saw the successive releases of four pictures that rank among the campiest in the history of film, all reflecting some connection to  the then-popular roller skating craze - 1979's Skatetown, U.S.A. andRoller Boogie, 1980'sXanaduand this travesty. The latter two were expensive major studio productions, but this one has the distinction of the megalomania of producer Allan Carr, who later torpedoed his career by producing one of the worst Oscar ceremonies with Rob Lowe and Snow White rocking out in their infamous duet of ""Proud Mary"". This is the base level of misguided sensibilities that runs rampant in this 1980 musical fiasco co-written by Carr and Bronte Woodard (who teamed far more fruitfully on 1978'sGrease) and directed by Rhoda Morgenstern's mother, actress Nancy Walker, a former musical performer decades earlier. None of these qualifications matter much because the final product is just a mess with a musical soundtrack decidedly inferior toXanadu.Apparently inspired by nave but exuberant pre-WWII-era Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musicals such as 1939'sBabes in Arms, the inane plot concerns Jack Morrell, an aspiring pop composer waiting to be discovered when he lands a gig as the house DJ at a Manhattan hotspot. He also house sits for Samantha Simpson, a former superstar model, who tries to get Jack a record deal through her various contacts in the music business. But Jack first needs to record a demo, so he and Samantha recruit a motley group of male singers in costumes presumably reflecting some kind of vocational guidance, and the Village People is formed. The group struggles through a recording session after which Samantha decides to have them perform with her in a milk commercial. The sponsors disapprove of the final product, so they all go to the gay nirvana of San Francisco where the group becomes an audience hit performing the thudding title tune at a charity fundraiser. Believe it or not, that's the story, but it only serves as an excuse to connect the elaborate and rather surreal musical numbers.I'm not sure what possessed Walker to direct this movie or what she exactly did other than move out of the way since the story is so disjointed and the editing quite sloppy. Not only do we have the non-performances of the Village People, but we have a young Steve Guttenberg acting suspiciously hyper-kinetic as Jack and Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner wooden in an inconsequential role as uptight lawyer Ron White, who falls for Samantha. Frankly looking too mature to be a just-retired model, Valerie Perrine is the only one that seems relaxed onscreen as Samantha. Other odd casting choices include Gypsy Rose Lee's little sister June Havoc as Jack's contract-negotiating mother, Broadway luminary Tammy Grimes as a tyrannical talent agency head, and Barbara Rush as Ron's socialite mother. They all join in on the final production number for no rational reason, but then again, there is no common sense found here. Just take a look at the infamous ""Y.M.C.A."" number, the silliest gay-oriented musical montage since Jane Russell cavorted with an army of asexual, half-naked athletes inGentlemen Prefer Blondes.

The concept alone would have sent him reeling.  He seemed to have that kind of creative mind.  I'm sure he would have run right out and started his own musical version of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""What detracts from the movie is that much of the film is dubbed.  Apparently, poor sound quality or noise on the set during filming prompted the need to have the actors re-record their dialog.  Dialog dubbed in a recording booth never sounds as spontaneous as on the set.  Dubbing is done during post-production -i.e., after the principle photography is completed and the participants have seen a rough version of the film.  This may account for the lackluster dubbing performances.  When the greater part of a movie is dubbed, and the dubbed performances are bad, the entire movie seems out of whack.  ""Can't Stop the Music"" is one film that is out of whack.After the success of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease,"" producer Allan Carr must have thought he could not fail.  He was wrong.  This movie, unlike ""SNF"" and ""Grease,"" bombed badly in the United States.  But three things prevented ""SNF"" and ""Grease"" from bombing:  a good script, terrific acting and wonderful choreography.  ""Can't Stop the Music"" lacks all three of these.[Carr again tried to produce another hit with ""Grease 2.""  This movie had great acting and terrific choreography (Pat Birch, the choreographer for the first ""Grease"" created the dance sequences for ""Grease 2"" as well).  ""Grease 2"" lacked one important ingredient:  A good script.]Because David Hodo (""Construction Worker"") was the more commercially appealing member of the Village People, he was given a solo (written in as a daydream sequence).  The number should have been cut from the film.  The grinding dance moves where the audience is treated to close-ups of the front of Hodo's tight jeans seem nothing more than gratuitous.Valerie Perrine (known mostly for her role as Lex Luther's girlfriend in the ""Superman"" films) plays the female lead in the film.  The role was supposed to go to Olivia Newton-John, but Lovely Livvy apparently asked for too much money.  When she turned down producer Allan Carr (who had tagged her to play Sandy in ""Grease""), he reportedly said, ""She can act, but she ain't no Barbra Striesand.""  (Instead, ONJ went on to star in a vehicle that promoted her own music.  The film, ""Xanadu,"" bombed; but its soundtrack went triple platinum).  Amazingly, Perrine agreed to allow herself to be filmed in a state of partial nudity (in the sauna during the ""YMCA"" sequence), something Newton-John certainly would not have considered.Bruce Jenner turned in a rather good comical performance, despite the material he was asked to perform.  Given that the film includes a scene in a gym with many men clad in skimpy gym shorts, I'm sure Jenner was asked to do the film because of his famous ""crossing the yellow line in the Olympics"" photograph plastered on Wheaties cereal boxes.  The photo shows Jenner in tiny red shorts that leave little to the imagination (hence his popularity).  If it was his body that got him the role, then so be it.  That kind of thing still goes on today.Steve Guttenberg never before (nor has he since) turned in such a bad performance as an actor.  He is so over the top in his delivery that his jugular vein looks like it may burst every time he delivers a line.  I suspect that his performance on film is not entirely his own fault.  Many times, actors' performances are dependent upon the director's ability to elicit good performances.  Director Nancy Walker had more than her share of difficulties in this area, the foremost being that the majority of the cast were not professional actors.Nancy Walker (perhaps better known as ""Rosie"" in Bounty's papertowels The Quicker-Picker-Upper ads and as ""Ida Morganstern,"" Rhoda's mom) had enormous success as a director with the film ""Rabbit Test"" starring Billy Crystal.  This may have been the reason she was handed the reins for this project.  Unlike ""Rabbit Test,"" where she essentially had control over all aspects of the film-making process, she had to contend with drug use on the set and the enthusiastic egos of her producers (Carr and Stigwood).  ""Can't Stop the Music"" is plagued with ""too many hands spoil the creative soup,"" resulting in a film that, stylistically, is all over the place.Carr tried to recreate the nostalgic magic of ""Grease"" by giving roles to veteran actors, who seem oddly out of place in the setting of ""Can't Stop the Music.""  Where the audience could easily connect the likes of Eve Arden, Joan Blondell and Sid Caesar to the 50s setting in ""Grease,"" the audience is hard pressed to figure out two things about the veteran actors in ""Music"":  One, who are they?; and Two, what is their connection to the disco era?Over time, some movies that fail when they are first released find their niche of commercial popularity. 1939's ""Wizard of Oz,"" for example, bombed when it was released in theaters.  ""Rocky Hill Picture Show"" (also a musical) didn't find mass appeal until long after it failed at the box office.  It appears that some executive at Paramount Pictures believes that ""Can't Stop the Music"" will someday find its niche and may even recoup some of the enormous financial losses the film incurred.  The very fact that this DVD has not been deleted from the Paramount catalog seems to support the argument that Paramount is determined to make their money back.I purchased this DVD for one reason only:  As awful as the movie is, it's fun to watch.  It has a terrific soundtrack that brings me back to my teenage years, a time when disco music was proudly known as ""disco music.""  The music in this film evokes memories of more innocent and naive days.  Those days are days I long for and this movie allows me to go there, if only in my imagination.  Musical Fantasies are prone to do that to people.",2,"""Can't Stand the Movie""",1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,5983,"['Ed', 'Wood', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'loved',

Still, I found their ""Can't Stop the Music"" film, a cheesy, campy musical of sorts to be all right.Steve Gutenberg plays an aspiring musician in New York, at the beginning of the 1980s. It's time for a fresh new sound on the radio to go with the fresh new decade, he's sure it's time! He's sure he's got that fresh new sound too, in his home studio. Shame he can't sing. His ex-supermodel roomate suggests he gets some singers from the community. There's that guy dressed as an Indian whose a good friend of theirs, for instance, and there's bound to be (and is) others like him with just as much talent. When they all get to their apartment, they can all make a night of it to. And so (according to the plot of the film) the Village People are born, the rest of the film shows their rise to fame, eventually hitting it big in San Francisco. Expect lots of musical numbers, including a couple of big hits like ""YMCA"".Now I'm a bit of a fan of tacky and campy, and that's what made some scenes appealing, but other parts of this film was a bit tacky and campy even for me (the whole ""milkshake"" commercial thing, for instance). Plus, the plot is pretty silly, as you might have noticed. I did like the look of the film though, which is more the style of the time more than anything deliberate. They sure don't make (or can't get away with making) films like this anymore. The music was so so, I was expecting a few more hits, but never mind.It's no ""Hard Day's Night"" in terms of a music film, and not quite ""Xanadu"" in terms of a camp classic, but it's still worth a look if you're at all interested in either of those styles.",3,"""That's Where We Live!

349444,ACNKNZSZQGZ5Q,6302990106,John Moulis,"[3, 3]","What do you remember about the 1970s?  The end of the Vietnam War and the TV footage of the evacuation from Saigon?  The Watergate Affair and the resignation of Richard Nixon?  The Energy Crisis and the Arab oil embargo?  Or do you remember hot sweaty nights on the disco floor and waking up with a different person each morning?  For many of us it is the latter.  The late 1970s were like a huge party which should have lasted forever.  As we all know it didn't, brought to a shuddering halt by Reaganism and AIDS.  Can't Stop the Music came out at the tail end of the disco craze and ushered in the 1980s - a campy, over-the-top monument to a golden era.  The centerpiece of the film is undoubtedly the YMCA segment, a huge production number featuring attractive young men in the gym, wrestling, working out and performing acrobatics in the pool - a remarkable Busby Berkeley style masterpiece featuring flashes of full-frontal nudity and which was replayed over and over on prime time television in Australia.  That was largely the reason why the film was a huge hit in Australia while it bombed spectacularly everywhere else.  Most of the other production numbers are entertaining as well - Magic Night, Samantha, David Hodo's solo number I Love You To Death, The Ritchie Family's performance of Give Me A Break, Listen to the Sound of the City (played over the opening titles) and the title track which provides the climax and ends the film.  The only poor segment is The Milk Shake featuring kids dressed as the Village People and a boring, almost tuneless song.  Believe it or not this was actually used as a legitimate ad for milk on US and Canadian television.  The plot of the film is weak, almost non-existent and provides a fictionalised account of the Village People story.  The acting is terrible and is merely a method to link the production numbers.  There are no g-a-y references and the film has a sanitised look about it apart from the YMCA segment.  Some of the actors are good, others not so good.  Olympic gold medallist and all-round hunk Bruce Jenner playing a straight accountant, the buxom Valerie Perrine playing the object d'esire, a young Steve Guttenberg (the only person to emerge from the film unscathed) who went on to have a successful film and TV career, and a rather seedy character who, it is implied, has a coke problem.  The Village People themselves were dropped by their record company shortly after the film and moved to RCA where they attempted to change their image in line with the 'new romantic' craze.  The album Renaissance was released and bombed badly, costing them their international following.  Realising their mistake they told the media that the album was only intended to be a one-off experiment.  But it was too late.  The group retired to the cabaret circuit and played dinner dates at Hilton Hotels around the world.  A word of warning about this DVD - it is in extreme wide screen and much of the action happens on the edge of the picture so zooming in to avoid the thick black bars on the top and bottom is not recommended.  It is best viewed on a large plasma TV in a home theatre.  The digital transfer is good and is worth buying for the 1970s look more than anything else - Bruce Jenner in a t-shirt cutoff showing his hairy torso must be seen to be believed.  Every generation has its classic films - one generation had Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.  Another generation had Star Wars.  The disco generation has Can't Stop the Music.

I suppose I should be happy with CSTP as next to it my favorite Disco Movie, Thanks God It's Friday, comes out looking like a cinematic masterpiece.Based VERY LOOSELY on how the late J. Morali founded the Village People, this trash-fest is best viewed on something (perhaps as a true salute to the 70's). Neil Bogart, the head of the Village People's record label, Casablanca,  knew he could get more milage out of this group by whitewashing their gay identity, and while it helped to sell records (YMCA, In The Navy) it was so unbelivable in this movie that even theatre goers in Idaho knew they were being hustled.The acting in this movie defies any attempt to critique it, and we are treated to Bruce Jenner running around 1979 NYC wearing come___me cut off shorts, and a too tight cutoff t-shirt. We are also lead to belive that Valarie Perrine was the real Farah Fawchet, and that Steve Guttenburg could really dance, skate, DJ, not to mention act.The musical numbers could have single handly ended the movie musical. Milkshake, and I Love You To Death MUST be seen to understand.  The final musical number, the title track,  was actually taken from a a real Village People concert in late '79, and was probally the last time that the Village People were backed by a live band.Had this movie been released the same year that it was filmed (1979) it would have no doubt done better at the box office, by 1980 public tastes had already changed, and by then this movie was just to....beyond.",5,"Beyond Camp, Beyond Trash, Beyond Taste, It's Just Beyond...",1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1600,"['gave', 'little', 'long', 'gem', 'turkey', '5', 'stars', 'credit', 'actors', 'just', 'getting', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'CSTP', 'next', 'favorite', 'Disco', 'Movie', 'Thanks', 'God', 'Friday', 'out', 'looking', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece.Based', 'VERY', 'LOOSELY', 'how', 'late', 'J.', 'Morali', 'founded', 'Village', 'People', 'trash-fest', 'best', 'viewed', 'something', 'perhaps', 'true', 'salute', '70', 'Neil', 'Bogart', 'head', 'Village', 'People', 'record', 'label', 'Casablanca', 'knew', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'milage', 'group', 'whitewashing', 'gay', 'identity', 'helped', 'sell', 'records', 'YMCA', 'Navy', 'was', 'so', 'unbelivable', 'movie', 'even', 'theatre', 'goers', 'Idaho', 'knew', 'were', 'being', 'hustled.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'attempt', 'critique', 'are', 'treated', 'Bruce', 'Jenner', 'running', 'around', '1979', 'NYC', 'wearing', 'come___me', 'cut', 'off', 'shorts', 'too', 'tight', 'cutoff', 't-shirt', 'are', 'also', 'lead', 'belive', 'Valarie', 'Perrine', 'was', 'real', 'Farah', 'Fawchet', 'Steve', 'Guttenburg', 'could', 'really', 'dance', 'skate', 'DJ', 'not', 'mention', 'act.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'could', 'have', 'single', 'handly', 'ended', 'movie', 'musical', 'Milkshake', 'Love', 'Death', 'MUST', 'be', 'seen', 'understand', 'final', 'musical', 'number', 'title', 'track', 'was', 'actually', 'taken', 'real', 'Village', 'People', 'concert', 'late', ""'79"", 'was', 'probally', 'last', 'time', 'Village', 'People', 'were', 'backed', 'live', 'band.Had', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'was', 'filmed', '1979', 'would', 'have', 'doubt', 'done', 'better', 'box', 'office', '1980', 'public', 'tastes', 'had', 'already', 'changed', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'just', '.beyond']",N/A

349452,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6302990106,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 10]","It was 1980. There was no MTV, Jimmy Carter was president, the Iran hostage crisis was continuing, Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign was gaining momentum and personal computers were slowly gaining in popularity.  Popular films included ""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Raging Bull"", ""The Shining"" and ""The Elephant Man"".  It was also the time when the music genre known as ""disco"", that had become extremely popular in the 1970's, was starting to lose luster as radio stations dropped their disco formats and disco clubs earned decreasing revenue. One disco-based film, ""Saturday Night Fever"", had been rather successful at the box office in 1977.  This was followed in 1978 by the far less memorable film ""Thank God It's Friday"".  Still trying to cash-in on disco's weakening popularity, two disco-based films were released in 1980: ""Xanadu"" and ""Can't Stop The Music"".  Each of these films were produced on a budget of approximately $20-million, but whereas ""Xanadu"" earned about $23-million in theaters, ""Can't Stop the Music"" earned a measly $2-million.  Why, you may ask?  Simple: both films were bad, but ""Can't Stop the Music"" went farther--it was truly awful!Imagine, if you a will, the charming & heart-warming story (note: I'm being sarcastic) of an unknown music composer, Jack Morell (Steve Guttenberg), trying to find a musical group to perform his songs.  His female roommate, Samantha Simpson (Valerie Perrine), and an attorney, Ron White (Bruce Jenner), gather together a group of six men from Greenwich Village and voil&agrave;: the very popular disco group known as the Village People was born!  (Yeah, right!)  Based very loosely on Jacques Morali, the man who actually founded the Village People, the film's farcical & unrealistic ""rags-to-riches"" story about the Village People includes performances of the songs ""Y.M.C.A."" (where else: in a gym), ""Can't Stop the Music"" (the song) and ""Milkshake"" (a truly frightening choreographed dance routine with the Village People all wearing white) to name a few.Needless to say, ""Can't Stop the Music"" did exactly that: it hastened the end of the already terminally-ill disco genre, and wasn't particularly helpful to the careers of the Village People themselves.  If you are planning to watch this little gem, I would highly recommend renting it instead of buying it since my overall rating for the film is only 1 star for its dismal acting, poor direction (Nancy Walker, 1922-1992), awful script and less than memorable choreography.  Not surprisingly, Nancy Walker never directed anything else after ""Can't Stop the Music"", and the same can be said for the film's two writers, Allan Carr (1937-1999) and Bronte Woodard (1940-1980).

Brandt,"[72, 80]","...Trust me, my jaw has not dropped in a long time (and that's not a VP-style double entendre), but nearly EVERY scene was jaw-droppingly, eye-poppingly, mind-bogglingly terrible.You know what you're in for when the main titles consist of Steve Guttenberg roller-skating through Manhattan, obstensibly ""listening"" and skate-dancing to the song played over the titles--however, Guttenberg instead seems to be dancing to the voices in his own head, so out of sync is he with the music.Things get even loonier when we're asked to believe that buxom Valerie Perrine was ""the face of the 70's,"" as in that decade's top fashion model. For WHOM? Frederick's of Hollywood? Lauren Hutton she ain't. Throw in Bruce Jenner (!!!) as the--ahem--straight man, camp icons Tammy Grimes and June Havoc, Marilyn Sokol as the very poor man's Eve Arden, and the Village People passing as hetero, and you've got one seriously twisted movie.Let's just rundown the highlights:1) Bruce Jenner (PLAYING A STRAIGHT MAN, I must reiterate), running around New York City in Daisy Dukes and a bare midriff, shrunken tee shirt.2) A group of little boys in full VP drag, including the Leatherman's get-up. (It's for a milk commercial. Don't ask.)3) David Hodo's (the Construction Worker) big solo number, ""I Love You to Death,"" which, to be fair, seems to have been conceived as an intentionally comic parody. (However, the same could be said of the entire film.) At any rate, David can't sing, but he's really hot jumping around in his skintight jeans, while being clawed at by overly-made-up mannequins in Halston knock-offs.4) The ""YMCA"" production number, which is a hysterically inept homage to ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" and ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""--but you do get to see a lot of bare, buffed skin.5) The finale ultimo, with the VP is sequined versions of their uniform drag--prior to going onstage, they're visited by ""special guest star Leigh Taylor-Young.""Needless to say, one must proceed with caution when deciding to buy/watch this trash masterpiece. But for those hardy souls, there is NO other film in my recent memory on which SO much money was spent, with NO redeeming results whatsoever. Every scene is awful. All of the lead ""actors"" are rotten--Perrine and Guttenberg must have been sniffing coke between takes, because each one performs at a disturbingly manic pace.So why the four star review? Because it's irresistible in its own weird way--like a car crash, only vastly more entertaining. It's also a priceless time capsule of an era that was only 20-odd years ago, but seems like a lifetime away.
