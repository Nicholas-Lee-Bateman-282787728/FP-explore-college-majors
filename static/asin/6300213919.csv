209560,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300213919,Acute Observer,"[2, 4]","Mommie Dearest, 1982 filmThis movie was adapted from a book written by Joan Crawford's adopted daughter. You can decide how reliable that combination is. We see Joan scrubbing the kitchen floor (for exercise?). A visitor arrives, she leads him upstairs to the shower. She donates gifts to an orphanage (favorable publicity). She wants a child but can't have one. Can she adopt? The adoption agency rejects her request. Can her manager help? A young baby arrives, she will live a privileged life. Her name is Christina. She grows up. Publicity photographs are taken at a birthday party. There is another child, Christopher. Other presents will be given to the poor orphans. Christina dives into a swimming pool; she must be more competitive.Joan wants a part in a movie. Can her agent do it? Can a young girl compete with an adult? ""Life isn't fair."" Christina is contrary. Joan runs to keep in shape. She will get the part. Christina play acts. Joan acts up and cuts her hair. She meets L. B. Mayer at her favorite restaurant. Later she is angry. Is she getting too old to be a star? Is she crazy? Greg leaves her bedroom. ""Good night and good luck."" Joan cuts up photographs. She is disturbed by the noise of her children playing. Mayer tells her to leave Metro, they will pay off her contract. Styles change. ""I'm sorry now."" She takes it out on her rose bushes. ""Bring me the axe!"" The tree falls. [Symbolism?] Joan practices for a part, ""Mildred Pierce"". Christina doesn't like her meat rare. An Academy Award prize leads to reporters at her home. She thanks her fans. Later she blows up when she finds a wire hanger in Christina's room. [They can rust and stain clothes.]Did Christina scrub the bathroom floor today? ""Do you think its clean?"" [What is wrong with Joan? Declining popularity?] ""Discipline mixed with love works."" Joan tells of her Christmas celebration. Can Christina serve drinks? She is quite extraordinary, says Uncle Ted. Christina is sent to a boarding school. [No baggage?] ""I understand."" We see an older Christina reciting a part. She does well in school. Has she become more rebellious? Tina washes clothes at home. Mommie has financial difficulties, Tina will go on a work scholarship program. Joan is scared. Christina learns more about life. They are caught! Is Joan over-reacting? ""Why did you adopt me?"" Joan throws a tantrum and attacks Christina! Christina is sent to a convent school as punishment and reform.Joan marries a soft drink king. Christina has a new Daddy. Joan moves to an apartment in New York city. Tina asks for help, Daddy obliges. But they must economize. Joan doesn't agree. Her husband dies. The Board asks for repayment of a loan. Joan doesn't agree, she threatens the Board. They misjudged her. Joan visits Tina, who acts in a TV soap opera. Christina has stomach pain (an ovarian tumor), she will be absent from work. Joan fills in, she needs cue cards. While Joan is abed her daughter accepts her award. ""Congratulations, Mommie Dearest."" Next we see Joan in her coffin. She is free. The maid says Joan always loved Tina. But her will does not mentin Christina or Christopher. [Who then?] Did she have the last word? Why was there little about Christopher?The moral of this story is to never disinherit any of your children, especially if your closet is full of skeletons.",3,The Daughter's Recollection,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,3332,"['Mommie', 'Dearest', '1982', 'filmThis', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'written', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'can', 'decide', 'how', 'reliable', 'combination', 'see', 'Joan', 'scrubbing', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'exercise', 'visitor', 'upstairs', 'shower', 'gifts', 'orphanage', 'favorable', 'publicity', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'Can', 'adopt', 'adoption', 'agency', 'request', 'Can', 'manager', 'help', 'young', 'baby', 'arrives', 'will', 'live', 'privileged', 'life', 'name', 'Christina', 'up', 'Publicity', 'photographs', 'are', 'taken', 'birthday', 'party', 'child', 'Christopher', 'Other', 'presents', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'poor', 'orphans', 'Christina', 'swimming', 'pool', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'competitive.Joan', 'part', 'movie', 'Can', 'agent', 'do', 'Can', 'young', 'girl', 'compete', 'adult', 'Life', ""n't"", 'fair', 'Christina', 'contrary', 'Joan', 'keep', 'shape', 'will', 'get', 'part', 'Christina', 'play', 'acts', 'Joan', 'up', 'hair', 'L.', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'Later', 'angry', 'getting', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'star', 'crazy', 'Greg', 'bedroom', 'Good', 'night', 'good', 'luck', 'Joan', 'up', 'photographs', 'disturbed', 'noise', 'children', 'playing', 'Mayer', 'leave', 'Metro', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'contract', 'Styles', 'change', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'now', 'out', 'rose', 'bushes', 'Bring', 'axe', 'tree', '[', 'Symbolism', ']', 'Joan', 'practices', 'part', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'Christina', ""n't"", 'like', 'meat', 'rare', 'Academy', 'Award', 'prize', 'leads', 'reporters', 'home', 'thanks', 'fans', 'Later', 'up', 'when', 'wire', 'hanger', 'Christina', 'room', 'can', 'rust', 'stain', 'clothes', ']', 'Did', 'Christina', 'scrub', 'bathroom', 'floor', 'today', 'Do', 'think', 'clean', 'What', 'wrong', 'Joan', 'Declining', 'popularity', 'Discipline', 'mixed', 'love', 'works', 'Joan', 'tells', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'Can', 'Christina', 'serve', 'drinks', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'Uncle', 'Ted', 'Christina', 'sent', 'boarding', 'school', '[', 'baggage', 'understand', 'see', 'older', 'Christina', 'reciting', 'part', 'well', 'school', 'Has', 'become', 'more', 'rebellious', 'Tina', 'clothes', 'home', 'Mommie', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'Tina', 'will', 'go', 'work', 'scholarship', 'program', 'Joan', 'scared', 'Christina', 'more', 'life', 'are', 'caught', 'Joan', 'over-reacting', 'Why', 'did', 'adopt', 'Joan', 'tantrum', 'attacks', 'Christina', 'Christina', 'sent', 'convent', 'school', 'punishment', 'reform.Joan', 'marries', 'soft', 'drink', 'king', 'Christina', 'new', 'Daddy', 'Joan', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Tina', 'help', 'Daddy', 'must', 'economize', 'Joan', ""n't"", 'agree', 'husband', 'dies', 'Board', 'repayment', 'loan', 'Joan', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Board', 'misjudged', 'Joan', 'Tina', 'who', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'Christina', 'stomach', 'pain', 'ovarian', 'tumor', 'will', 'be', 'absent', 'work', 'Joan', 'cue', 'cards', 'Joan', 'abed', 'daughter', 'award', 'Congratulations', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'see', 'Joan', 'coffin', 'free', 'maid', 'Joan', 'always', 'loved', 'Tina', 'will', 'not', 'mentin', 'Christina', 'Christopher', '[', 'Who', 'then', ']', 'Did', 'have', 'last', 'word', 'Why', 'was', 'there', 'little', 'Christopher', 'moral', 'story', 'never', 'disinherit', 'children', 'especially', 'closet', 'full', 'skeletons']",N/A

Some of this is true and the rest is the director's vision. It's a subjective experience and that's the way I view it. Faye Dunaway's career shouldn't have been savaged the way it was after this movie came out, it's just very difficult playing an everyday version of a person that is so different in tone than many of the films this actress has been in and the way she preferred to be seen in public. Joan Crawford is a film icon and that goes without me saying, but she's the type of icon that wasn't a moldable piece of clay some actors are, she was who she was and you didn't want that, TOUGH!In addition to this, I don't think the film is that good, the people who made it just made it seem half baked and hopeless.

While watching the movie it's good to keep in mind that it is almost totally fiction. True, Joan Crawford was never going to win the mother of the year award. But even Christina Crawford does not like this film, as her mother is presented as a total psycho. The studio did not like her original screenplay based on her novel of the same name, so the studio redid it to suit their liking. The movie paints Christina to be a bitter child of a celebrity. The fact is that through it all Christina loved her mother. And although much of what's depicted in the film did happen, it wasn't to that extent. The wire hanger scene did happen, but not the same night as the bathroom floor scene. All these things took place over the course of several months.

Accusations of it being too campy. too intense or too unfair to the late great Joan Crawford's memory will probably be debated forever.  However, this film has withstood it all admirably and that's why we're welcoming a new release on DVD.It's a shame that according to most reports, Faye Dunnaway has mostly disowned this film.  Apparently she refuses to talk about it publicly.  Perhaps the negativity that surround it is a bad memory for her, which is understandable, however many great works of art are derided or dismissed at their initial release.  Even films like the perennial, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" first saw the light of day as a failure.  It often takes time for people to realize why something is special, or to fully understand something as intense as Dunnaway's portrayal as talented, but tormented Joan Crawford.  I'm hoping one day soon, Faye will embrace it like so many others.The DVD has three great featurettes and an incredibly entertaining audio commentary by John Waters.  Waters repeats often why he's a fan of this movie, why it's not at all true camp and yes, where the flaws of it lie.  However, he's an enthusiastic lover of the final product.  Perhaps through his eyes, the undisputed Master of Camp, people will come to see that this movie, while certainly having ""campy"" moments, stands on its own as a terrific Hollywood film with its own unique rewards.Best revelation of John Water's commentary:  He loves wire hangers!",4,Nobody ever said that life was fair.,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,1637,"['movie', 'fair', 'Only', 'late', 'diva', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'adopted', 'darling', 'Christina', 'really', 'know', 'sure', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'Accusations', 'being', 'too', 'campy', 'too', 'intense', 'too', 'unfair', 'late', 'great', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'memory', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'debated', 'forever', 'However', 'film', 'withstood', 'admirably', 'why', ""'re"", 'welcoming', 'new', 'release', 'DVD.It', 'shame', 'according', 'most', 'reports', 'Faye', 'Dunnaway', 'mostly', 'disowned', 'film', 'Apparently', 'talk', 'publicly', 'Perhaps', 'negativity', 'surround', 'bad', 'memory', 'understandable', 'however', 'many', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'are', 'derided', 'dismissed', 'initial', 'release', 'Even', 'films', 'perennial', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'first', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'failure', 'often', 'time', 'people', 'realize', 'why', 'something', 'special', 'fully', 'understand', 'something', 'as', 'intense', 'Dunnaway', 'portrayal', 'talented', 'tormented', 'Joan', 'Crawford', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'soon', 'Faye', 'will', 'embrace', 'so', 'many', 'others.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'great', 'featurettes', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'audio', 'commentary', 'John', 'Waters', 'Waters', 'repeats', 'often', 'why', 'fan', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'true', 'camp', 'yes', 'where', 'flaws', 'However', 'enthusiastic', 'lover', 'final', 'product', 'Perhaps', 'eyes', 'undisputed', 'Master', 'Camp', 'people', 'will', 'come', 'see', 'movie', 'certainly', 'having', 'campy', 'moments', 'own', 'terrific', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'own', 'unique', 'rewards.Best', 'revelation', 'John', 'Water', 'commentary', 'wire', 'hangers']",N/A

I don't see how else the  performance could be played. It has to be that low-key, because Faye  Dunaway is taking up so much space, with her virtuouso turn as Joan  Crawford. Also, as Pauline Kael noted in her excellent review of the film,  &quot;Scarwid has good low tones in her voice which suggest the ordeals  Tina has been through, and she brings the role a twinkle, a gleam of rude  humor, that seems to sustain Tina through her mother's most fiendish  persecutions.&quot; At the end of the film, her character's unresolved  anger and sorrow is especially pungent to me. And all of you who feel that  doesn't ring true aren't being entirely honest about your relationships  with your own parents! Maybe viewers who appreciate the film only as a  &quot;camp classic&quot;, don't really want to acknowledge the tragic  realism of the material? It IS funny, but then it's horrifyingly funny, and  worse that that.

Of course, the motives of Cristina Crawford are very obvious:  roast her dead mother's memory on a spit for a few bucks.The main thing here is not to take this film as truth. The movie leaves out huge chunks of details about Miss Crawford's life  and strains for credibility at times.  There are even times you find yourself admiring the lead character played by Faye Dunaway.  After all, you have to hand it to Joan Crawford (if even a small fraction of this movie is true)for being a true survivor with a hearty work-ethic who made it in a town notoriously famous for chewing people up and spitting them out.Once you understand the real-life daughter's motives for writing such a book and making such a movie, then you can sit back and enjoy Faye Dunaway and her over the top, but wonderfully acted part.

And the scenes can be taken out of context for viginette fun!The wire hanger sequence.  Everyone knows the scene.  Joan (played to death by Faye Dunaway) beats poor little Christina with a  coat hanger, while her brother (does anyone know why he was strapped into  his bed as if he were being launched into orbit?) is only a few feet away.  But the best moment in that sequence, in my opinion, is when Christina is  sitting on the bathroom floor, covered in powdered cleanser, lost in her  particular brand of pathos.  Absolutely hysterical!Also, the tree.  Look  at Christina's face when Joan screams, &quot;TINA!  BRING ME THE AXE!&quot;  Would YOU give that woman an axe?And the bloody steak.  And the  swimming contest (&quot;I'm bigger and stronger and I will always beat  you.&quot;).  And the underlying &quot;tension&quot; when the radio  personality asks the kids on the air what will happen after he and his crew  leave.  You can almost feel Christina wanting to say something about cans  of Comet and raw meat.Those responsible may well have set out to make a  serious film.  One can only speculate.  What they have given us is some the  best comedy this side of the Atlantic.

I couldn't believe how conspicuously absent the brother was the whole time in the picture after Christina had aged enough to go to boarding school. The first three-fourths of the picture were very well-done, but the last thirty minutes fell flat. When Mommie Dearest ended, I had no idea what the movie was trying to tell me except that I was forced to accept the fact that Joan Crawford was a b**** in real life. I viewed Mommie Dearest a horror picture instead of a drama. Faye Dunaway was the only one who gave a great performance while Diana Scarwid who might have given a much uninspired show. The girl who played Christina Crawford wasn't terrible at all; she came close in giving the best performance possible. One thing bothered me a lot while watching Mommie Dearest was the lack of time identification. That would have been a great asset for me, so I wouldn't get confused with the chronological order. The famous wire hanger part left me clueless. Still, it remains the most memorable of Mommie Dearest. People have described Mommie Dearest as a campy bio-pic, but sadly, I don't see how it is. I thought Mommie Dearest was effective in portraying what was Joan Crawford like, but I was very much so surprised that there wasn't a blip of Bette Davis the whole film. I recall that was a very famous feud between the two women back in the days. Was Mommie Dearest meant to be trashy because Christina Crawford wanted to make her mother to look shamefully bad? Honestly, I have no idea at this point and probably will never. Did Mommie Dearest get made to feature the dresses and set pieces, especially how the interior looks, over the substance of the bio-pic? It seemed like it was. Midway through the film, I think, the focus on Joan Crawford was changed, and Mommie Dearest became Christina Crawford's show. Hm, I thought the movie was about Joan Crawford? Anyhow, I did like many parts about Mommie Dearest: the child abuse, the obsessive-compulsive disorder, the bipolar moods, the gung-ho parenting, the set of rules, the set of non-written rules, the moments surrounding by them, and, of course, Faye Dunaway's performance. But to ask me what the goal of Mommie Dearest is, I don't rightfully know. Regardless, Mommie Dearest had the potential to be the next Sunset Boulevard had the problems been fixed up. Watching Mommie Dearest helped to solve some of the mystery regarding the nun thing in Psycho III since Diana Scarwid was in both films. All in all, Mommie Dearest is an interesting picture that obviously had flaws while at the same time possessing a wonderful performance out of Faye Dunaway.",3,Liked It For Different Reasons.,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,2729,"['Viewed', '1/08Rate', '61/08', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'was', 'totally', 'bad', 'certainly', 'had', 'problems', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'conspicuously', 'brother', 'was', 'whole', 'time', 'picture', 'Christina', 'had', 'aged', 'enough', 'go', 'boarding', 'school', 'first', 'three-fourths', 'picture', 'were', 'very', 'well-done', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'fell', 'flat', 'When', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'ended', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'was', 'forced', 'accept', 'fact', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'b****', 'real', 'life', 'viewed', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'horror', 'picture', 'instead', 'drama', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'much', 'uninspired', 'show', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'came', 'close', 'giving', 'best', 'performance', 'possible', 'One', 'thing', 'bothered', 'lot', 'watching', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'was', 'lack', 'time', 'identification', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'asset', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'confused', 'chronological', 'order', 'famous', 'wire', 'hanger', 'part', 'left', 'clueless', 'Still', 'most', 'memorable', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'People', 'have', 'described', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'campy', 'bio-pic', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'thought', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'was', 'effective', 'portraying', 'what', 'was', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'blip', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'whole', 'film', 'recall', 'was', 'very', 'famous', 'feud', 'two', 'women', 'back', 'days', 'Was', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'meant', 'be', 'trashy', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'wanted', 'make', 'mother', 'look', 'shamefully', 'bad', 'Honestly', 'have', 'idea', 'point', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'Did', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'get', 'made', 'feature', 'dresses', 'set', 'pieces', 'especially', 'how', 'interior', 'looks', 'substance', 'bio-pic', 'seemed', 'was', 'Midway', 'film', 'think', 'focus', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'changed', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'became', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'show', 'Hm', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Anyhow', 'did', 'like', 'many', 'parts', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'child', 'abuse', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'bipolar', 'moods', 'gung-ho', 'parenting', 'set', 'rules', 'set', 'non-written', 'rules', 'moments', 'surrounding', 'course', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'ask', 'what', 'goal', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'do', ""n't"", 'rightfully', 'know', 'Regardless', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'next', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'had', 'problems', 'been', 'fixed', 'up', 'Watching', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'helped', 'solve', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'nun', 'thing', 'Psycho', 'III', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'was', 'films', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'interesting', 'picture', 'obviously', 'had', 'flaws', 'same', 'time', 'possessing', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Faye', 'Dunaway']",N/A

The screenplay could have used a little more ""tightening"" as it emerges as a series of violent vignettes between mother and daughter.  However, the performances and production values are first rate.  The sets are marvelous, Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid are perfect in their interpretations as the battered, abused, misunderstood young and adult Christina.

We don't really understand why.This is the notorious over the top movie from 1981 based on an autobiographical book by Christina Crawford, painting her adoptive mother as a psychotic perfectionist. Faye Dunaway seems like a tired drag queen. This movie takes itself too seriously. The real Joan Crawford slowly became more and more mannish over the years until she developed a swagger and voice that made John Wayne seem like Betty Boop.Dunaway's character quickly becomes a frightening monster, each scene of anger more disturbing than the last. It's surprising that Christina didn't kill this woman or run far, far away.It's like some awful car accident that you try to avoid looking at. The film has become a pathetic dark comedy, a true horror film. You cannot help but laugh at this load of tripe. And then wince.If you want to see the real Joan at her scary best, check out Strait Jacket (William Castle's psycho-with-a-hatchet flick), Johnny Guitar (colorful western with palpable lesbian tension), and Queen Bee (nasty soap melodrama).Just remember, darlings: Life will be fine as long as you keep an immaculately clean home, get your Christmas cards out on time, and smile for the reporters.",3,Eeeeeeeew.

209577,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,6300213919,Ben Adam,"[3, 3]","Mommie Dearest is not everyone's type of movie, to be sure. If you've read the book, you're sure to say that it falls far short of the book. However, there's no way a movie could possibly include everything the book contained; a movie that contained all that content would have run for a half day at least, and no audience would have been that patient. As far as movie adaptations go, Mommie Dearest did an admirable job of capturing as much as it could from the book, which was powerful in itself.If you remember Joan Crawford in her heyday, the movie will hit you where you live because of Faye Dunaway's performance alone. Faye Dunaway IS Joan Crawford. She captures Joan Crawford's gestures, her voice, her mannerisms so perfectly that it is easy to forget that the person on the screen is Faye Dunaway and not Joan Crawford herself. All the others in the film are secondary to her, although Diana Scarwid's portrayal of Christina as an adult is significant as she is the one who is telling the story.Herein lies the weakness of the movie. For persons who knew Joan Crawford and the legend behind her, watching Faye Dunaway's histrionics may conjure up gleeful feelings or outrage, depending on how the viewer felt about Joan Crawford. She had a reputation for being a very tough woman, and those who liked her will feel she was betrayed in this movie; Faye Dunaway's career did suffer as a result of her portrayal in this movie. Those who despised Joan Crawford will cackle with glee over the way this movie turned her into a witch. However, for audiences who knew little about Joan Crawford, the movie will look strange and bizarre, and the performances by Faye Dunaway and Diana Scarwid may make no sense at all. As one thirtysomething viewer said after seeing the film, ""It was the eeriest film I ever saw in my life, more than the Exorcist.""Many people who watch Mommie Dearest claim it is truly awful and will say it has the worst acting imaginable; reviews blasting the film can be found everywhere imaginable. However, how you enjoy the film depends on your viewpoint. The people who love it -- and I am one of those people -- remember Joan Crawford's movies but also remember her as a woman who was known to be a real bitch. She knew everyone thought of her as a bitch, too; when she appeared on I Love Lucy, in one of the rehearsals, she was overheard saying, ""And people say I'M a bitch!"" She was well known to be not an easy person, so when the controversy over Christina Crawford's book and this movie started -- so many people, including adopted brother Christopher -- claimed that none of it was true -- there was the reputation to deal with. This movie certainly makes the most of that reputation. It then makes the film into a very swanky sort of mud wrestling contest, only without the mud. Faye Dunaway's histrionics become incredibly funny when you view the film in such a light, and to a large extent, many have chosen to make Mommie Dearest into a sort of cult film in that vein; it certainly works well that way.Realize when you view Mommie Dearest that how you view it may well be affected by how much you know about the career of Joan Crawford. If you know nothing about Joan Crawford, you may not even want to rate this movie with a half star. If you remember her from movies such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, this movie may well be one of your all-time favorites.There's little question that if Joan Crawford came back from the grave, she would not be pleased by this film. She might even go into the same histrionics that the film displayed. Only then would we really know how true the story is. Even so, it is still fun to imagine that she would.",4,"For Some People, Priceless!",1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3685,"['Mommie', 'Dearest', 'not', 'everyone', 'type', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'sure', 'say', 'far', 'short', 'book', 'However', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'possibly', 'include', 'everything', 'book', 'contained', 'movie', 'contained', 'content', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'half', 'day', 'least', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'patient', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'go', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'capturing', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'book', 'was', 'powerful', 'itself.If', 'remember', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'heyday', 'movie', 'will', 'hit', 'where', 'live', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'alone', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'IS', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'gestures', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'so', 'perfectly', 'easy', 'forget', 'person', 'screen', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'not', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'others', 'film', 'are', 'secondary', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'portrayal', 'Christina', 'adult', 'significant', 'one', 'who', 'telling', 'story.Herein', 'weakness', 'movie', 'persons', 'who', 'knew', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'legend', 'watching', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'histrionics', 'may', 'conjure', 'up', 'gleeful', 'feelings', 'outrage', 'depending', 'how', 'viewer', 'felt', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'very', 'tough', 'woman', 'who', 'liked', 'will', 'feel', 'was', 'betrayed', 'movie', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'career', 'did', 'suffer', 'result', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'who', 'despised', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'will', 'cackle', 'glee', 'way', 'movie', 'turned', 'witch', 'However', 'audiences', 'who', 'knew', 'little', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'will', 'look', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'performances', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'may', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'thirtysomething', 'viewer', 'said', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'eeriest', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'life', 'more', 'Exorcist', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'claim', 'truly', 'awful', 'will', 'say', 'worst', 'acting', 'imaginable', 'reviews', 'blasting', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'everywhere', 'imaginable', 'However', 'how', 'enjoy', 'film', 'viewpoint', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'remember', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movies', 'also', 'remember', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'real', 'bitch', 'knew', 'everyone', 'thought', 'bitch', 'too', 'when', 'appeared', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'one', 'rehearsals', 'was', 'overheard', 'saying', 'people', 'say', ""'M"", 'bitch', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'be', 'not', 'easy', 'person', 'so', 'when', 'controversy', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'book', 'movie', 'started', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Christopher', 'claimed', 'none', 'was', 'true', 'was', 'reputation', 'deal', 'movie', 'certainly', 'most', 'reputation', 'then', 'film', 'very', 'swanky', 'sort', 'mud', 'wrestling', 'contest', 'only', 'mud', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'histrionics', 'become', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'when', 'view', 'film', 'such', 'light', 'large', 'extent', 'many', 'have', 'chosen', 'make', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'sort', 'cult', 'film', 'vein', 'certainly', 'well', 'way.Realize', 'when', 'view', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'how', 'view', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'affected', 'how', 'much', 'know', 'career', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'know', 'nothing', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'want', 'rate', 'movie', 'half', 'star', 'remember', 'movies', 'such', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'little', 'question', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'came', 'back', 'grave', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'pleased', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'go', 'same', 'histrionics', 'film', 'displayed', 'Only', 'then', 'would', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'Even', 'so', 'still', 'fun', 'imagine', 'would']",N/A
209578,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,6300213919,Ben,"[4, 12]","in this travesty.  When the film first came out, all I heard was ""Faye looks just like her!"", ""The sets are to die for!"",  ""She should win an Oscar""!  Faye was so this and so that and she was all over the place.  On magazines and TV shows like she was....Joan Crawford.It's not a good film and poor Faye Dunaway, once one of the ""new breed"" of actors, burned herself at the Hollywood stake.  And we all sat back and watched it happen.  We even bought tickets.In truth, Faye didn't stand a chance.  The scriptwriters turned Joan into a bulldozer and Faye, who really needed a hit film, (her career was sliding) decided that she could bulldoze along with the best of them.The result is an eye-popping, jaw-dropping portrayal of one of Hollywood's most glamorous citizens.  And all of this was taken from Christina Crawford's bitch-fest about her mother.  If that tome wasn't ""bulldozer"" enough, the screenwriter's made damned sure that they would portray Joan as a maniacal and out-of-control fruitcake.  With an axe.  With Bon-Ami.  With (dare I say it?) wire hangers.  Faye took the role and ran.  I think she's still running away from this, as after ""Mommie Dearest"" her career never recovered.  It's ""Baby Jane"" with Faye Dunaway.Joan works and boozes and smokes and sleeps around.  (For me, that's Wednesday).  She wakes up at the crack of nowhere to do awful things with her face (hot water and ice cubes; and I only say ""awful"" because Mancini's soundtrack tells us that it is) and scrubs her fingers furiously....you can hear her moan at the pain....and she keeps on doing it.  She hits the studio before dawn and finally finally finally Faye turns her face to the camera.The sets and wardrobe and makeup are excellent.  Very impressive and indicative of their time.  But....wait.....Faye turns her face to the camera.It's Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford.

This dvd is a must for anyone who has seen this film and loved it or anyone who wants to see it.  Also an excellent way to learn more about Joan Crawfod and more importantly, Faye Dunaway.Dunaway disowns this part and I think I get why. The part took its toll on her emotionally and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest screen performances ever on film. And what did this gifted actress get in return? Bad reviews, jokes and a ""cult"" film on her behalf. Come on, I wouldn't really want to talk about it either.Dunaway did take the time to express some feelings in her book Looking For Gatsby. So I would appreciate it if all you reviewers on amazon who trashed this film or (God help us) Dunaway herself, to read about the time and effort she put into this performance and how she did it. I'm sorry but i'm tired of people laughing at this movie and not taking it seriously. You can't throw descriptions like ""over the top"" at this woman because you lack perspective and appreciation of talent.No one ever tore apart: Al Pacino in Scarface, Marlon Brando in the Godfather/Last Tango in Paris or Anthony Hopkins in Scilence of the Lambs (Hopkins,by the way,felt that her portrayal of Crawford is one of the best performances of all time). But when a woman dares to even come close to Marlon Brando's talent, people make fun of her. Also, Dunaway has made some other incredible films, i can't list them, it would take too long. Check out 3 Days of the Condor. She had to play second fiddle to Robert Redford and stole the show with a touching, sad and heartfelt character. Simply put,stop with the disrespectful reviews.Now, this dvd did an incredible job with the extras. The commentarty with John Waters is hysterical but also very informative and touching in a way. The interviews with Diana Scarwid, Runalta Alda and Frank Yablins gives us even more information, gossip, background stories that help us understand the film and how it was made.I hope this helps people who are interested in the dvd or are fans of Ms. Dunaway.

209585,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6300213919,Byron Kolln,"[10, 13]","Joan Crawford, with her impossibly-arched eyebrows and gargantuan shoulderpads, was a camp icon long before MOMMIE DEAREST even went before the cameras.  Thanks to Faye Dunaway's performance in the film, Joan Crawford rose to the position of camp's High Priestess, and fans wouldn't have it any other way.Joan Crawford's adopted daughter Christina began writing the book ""Mommie Dearest"" shortly before Joan's death and allowed her to read the drafts.  It was for this reason alone that Crawford completely cut Christina out of the will (though Christina manages to leave out this important fact in her many interviews and personal appearances).  The poison-filled tome did manage to destroy the reputation which Joan had carefully guarded and maintained throughout her professional life; but in recent years her films have gradually found their audience once again and Crawford is now looked upon as one of the leading lights of the classic cinema, as she should be.MOMMIE DEAREST recounts the early life of Christina Crawford, growing up as the daughter of the reigning Queen of Hollywood.  There is little doubt that Joan Crawford was a very demanding and strong woman, an alcoholic with deep-seated psychological phobias.  But this does not make her an abuser.In the film version of MOMMIE DEAREST, Faye Dunaway gives a very eerie recreation of Joan Crawford (which spans from 1939's ""Ice Follies of 1939"" to her final days).  Much has been made of the infamous ""NO WIRE HANGERS...EVEEEEER!!!"" scene, and Dunaway has that rare ability to capture much of Crawford's agonies.  Equally-strong is Mara Hobel, who gives a deeply affecting performance as the younger Christina.  Diana Scarwid is memorable as the older Christina.But it must be noted that so many incidents in the film were glossed-over in favour of Hollywood fantasy.  No one will really know what exactly happened in the private relationship of Joan and Christina, but reading between the lines (and being quite aware that much of the book was written with sheer hatred and blinding anger), it becomes very clear that Christina was a little brat who did everything she could to push her mother's buttons.MOMMIE DEAREST remains to this day a feast for the lovers of camp; from Faye Dunaway's one-line zingers, the outrageous clothes of Irene Sharaff, to the mealy-mouthed Christina played by Diana Scarwid.

The film documents the crazed and often barbaric behavior that the fading star exhibited on her two adopted children until her death in 1977. MOMMIE DEAREST is primarily told from Christina's perspective, which paints her mother in a very negative light. Based on other stories that have surfaced in the years following her death, Christina's depiction may not have been far from the truth. Apart from the constant psychological abuse that Crawford imposed on the children, the film's most notorious scene depicts a particularly nasty moment where Joan has a nervous breakdown and viciously beats her daughter with a wire clothes hanger for not hanging her dresses properly. Although it nearly ruined her career, Faye Dunaway is deliciously over-the-top as the conceited and egotistical Queen of Hollywood, with Diana Scarwid putting in a strong performance as well as Christina Crawford.

Christina Crawford's autobiograhical bestseller about her Hollywood upbringing at the hands of her alcoholic, moviestar 'Mommie' Joan Crawford,  was powerful, enfuriating, and heartbreaking. The movie, unfortunately, is  just a mish-mash of overblown acting and there is little continuity between  the scenes. I nearly walked out on this movie when I first saw it, and it's  not much better on the small screen!

The reviews from the critics went beyond scathing, and most of the filmgoers seemed to agree.Not the wife and I. What has now become some truly famous scenes were met with stunned silence that night in the theater. Silence that made our laughing oh-so-conspicuous. We were the only ones laughing and we didn't care. Of course child abuse is a serious subject and wrong, but, this film is so outrageous and campy, so unique and mystfying, so bizarre and strangely entertaining, that child abuse isn't what we were laughing at.....it was simply the feeling of enjoying a rather unique film. Many people claim that Faye Dunaway went over the top with her performance. We didn't think so, in fact, her performance is absolutely amazing in this film. The film itself is highly unusual, but make no mistake, Dunaway is flat out mesmerizing. Sadly, too many people wanted to take this film seriously, and I can understand that, but, once the viewer realizes this isn't a movie to take seriously, then they too can enjoy what it truly is. Now, what it truly is has never been determined, but, if you're willing to go with the flow, this film will baffle, impress, horrify, stupefy, and make you laugh until you collapse. Ultimately, this film has garnered a huge following over the years, and I'm very happy to see that a lot of people finally accepted Dunaway's performance. It is indeed something to behold and cherish.....and laugh at. A one of a kind performance in a one of a kind film. Mommie Dearest turned into something completely different than it's original intentions, so, how can that be so bad when the film is enjoyable on so many strange levels ?

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 1]","&quot;No wire hangers!&quot; forced its way into the American lexion by way of this film treatment of Christina Crawford's best-selling expose about her mother, screen icon Joan Crawford. In what turned out to be a near fatal career move, Faye Dunaway took on the role of the neurotic and self-absorbed Crawford and her never-ending quest to retain her youth and arguable glamour. With that and her own dirt-poor childhood as fodder for insecurity searching for something to have absolute control over, Crawford unleashed her frustration on two of her four adopted children, though this film gives us the low-down between mother and daughter Christina. She and brother Christopher (essentially absent in the film) endure such abuses as after-midnight physicial batterings, being forced to surrender birthday and holiday presents, being sent away and, in a final insult, exclucion from their mother's will. On far too many levels, this film simply doesn't work, and we don't get any real sense of what really haunted the real Crawford. It is only Dunaway's hyper performance and ability to change Crawford from a glamour queen in public to the mother from hell in private that makes the film worth watching. As the adult Christina, actress Diana Scarwid has her moments, but a script that seems to focus on Crawford's demons sacrifices the daughter's own sense of desparation and isolation. In the end, hers comes off as something of a clash between a child of want and a child of privilege. But Dunaway carries this film despite its flaws, and her Crawford makes viewers think of the word matricide. For a truer sense of reality, read Christina Crawford's book of the same title. In it, she is able to capture the souls of both women and which eludes the film.",3,So much for glitz and glamour!,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1760,"['quot', 'No', 'wire', 'hangers', 'quot', 'forced', 'way', 'American', 'lexion', 'way', 'film', 'treatment', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'best-selling', 'expose', 'mother', 'screen', 'icon', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'near', 'fatal', 'career', 'move', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'took', 'role', 'neurotic', 'self-absorbed', 'Crawford', 'never-ending', 'quest', 'retain', 'youth', 'arguable', 'glamour', 'own', 'dirt-poor', 'childhood', 'fodder', 'insecurity', 'searching', 'something', 'have', 'absolute', 'control', 'Crawford', 'unleashed', 'frustration', 'two', 'four', 'adopted', 'children', 'film', 'low-down', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'brother', 'Christopher', 'essentially', 'absent', 'film', 'endure', 'such', 'abuses', 'after-midnight', 'physicial', 'batterings', 'being', 'forced', 'surrender', 'birthday', 'holiday', 'presents', 'being', 'sent', 'away', 'final', 'insult', 'exclucion', 'mother', 'will', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'levels', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'what', 'really', 'haunted', 'real', 'Crawford', 'only', 'Dunaway', 'hyper', 'performance', 'ability', 'change', 'Crawford', 'glamour', 'queen', 'public', 'mother', 'hell', 'private', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'adult', 'Christina', 'actress', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'moments', 'script', 'focus', 'Crawford', 'demons', 'daughter', 'own', 'sense', 'desparation', 'isolation', 'end', 'hers', 'off', 'something', 'clash', 'child', 'want', 'child', 'privilege', 'Dunaway', 'film', 'flaws', 'Crawford', 'viewers', 'think', 'word', 'matricide', 'truer', 'sense', 'reality', 'read', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'able', 'capture', 'souls', 'women', 'film']",N/A

Hustwick,"[0, 1]","We all know that the movie gets a bit campy.But I'm with Faye Duneway -- she deserved a hell of a lot more credit than she's ever received for her blistering performance as a tormented and sadistic Hollywood legend.  Her work here is every bit as good as Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.  I think she out-acts Joan Crawford in ""Mildred Pierce"", for which the latter won the Academy Award.The problem with Mommie Dearest is that the story is infested by exploitative melodrama and truncated scenes.  This has much more to do with the script and direction (along with most of the supporting actors); because of this, the film increasingly feels like it is more of a bludgeoning freak show and less of a character study.  Perhaps that this is why it won all of the Razzies and continues to be maligned, but in my view this misrepresents many of the extremely disturbing issues and child abuse brought up by the film.  Joan Crawford is not portrayed as some comic book villain, but as a manic, deranged, tough and lonely person.  Yes, the writing more often than not hits these points on the head but it still does not take away form the very nuanced and chilling performance.Apparently, in his commentary John Waters condemns the tree chopping and wire hanger scenes as the reasons the film has been treated so unfairly.  Having not listened to his reasoning, I believe his point is that they are too  ""over the top"" and borderline comical.  That's sellout crap from a catty guy who has made light of physical violence in many of this films and loves playing little games about female sadism and demented freaks.  I would disagree with that sentiment, having witnessed firsthand people completely losing their composure and Mommie Dearest is one of the few films to accurately portray this in the movies.

But, really, what else could a film about a movie stare be? At least so that it could hold its star's audience? Why would anyone want to read about Christina Crawford, save for her mother? After all, she was a spoiled brat who suffered, in actuality, nothing more than the typical behavior of an alcoholic and/or bipolar parent (as well as OCD and manic depressive), and fared much better than your typical orphan of the period. That she personalized this, when the reality was obvious, says more about her than her mother, as did the expectation that she could ever be the `star' of a film her mother was in (in reality or spirit). The fact is that while `everyone has a story'- to quote the PC clich&eacute;, few of those stories are worth experiencing. Christina's is actually one of them, save for the fact that her mother was a Hollywood legend. Sans that and she's the snotty kid of the town drunk. Period.Naturally, the film was savaged by the critics, and the studio almost immediately tried to turn the film's fortunes around by re-marketing it as a camp classic, rather than serious drama. It did not work, although the film did make a profit, and in the intervening decades has become a cult favorite amongst gays. Dunaway did, however, get some well deserved kudos, including a nomination as Best Actress from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, for what it's worth. But, the post-release arc of the film has been one of almost constant critical cribbing- especially in a negative vein; and to the point that many online critics flub even basic facts about the film and specific scenes. Mainstream critics fared just as poorly. Critical superstar Roger Ebert lamented: `Mommie Dearest repeats the same basic dramatic situation again and again. Baby Christina tries to do the right thing, tries to be a good girl, tries to please Mommie, but Mommie is a manic-depressive who alternates between brief triumphs and long savage tirades, infecting her daughter with resentment and guilt....'. Yet, this is clearly not so, for much of the film shows the exact opposite- a desperate mother doing any and all things to try to buy her daughter's love. And, the brat often refuses it, or will accept it only on her terms! Recall I noted that Christina is a very unsympathetic character. Just watch the scenes of Christina's birthday party, her watching her mother on the soap opera, and a few others- most notably during the hanger/bathroom scene, when a desperate Joan begs her daughter, after she calls her Mommie Dearest, `When I told you to call me that, I wanted you to mean it.' It's clear that Crawford (at least the filmic version) sublimated a good deal of her real nature (one admittedly not suited for parenting) to try to be a good mother.But, this sublimation of the self, as well as the shared commiseration of mother and daughter, is the essence and major theme of the film. It is also the way the two characters define love- not `conquering all,' but `barely managing to survive.' The odd thing is, though, that decades after the events in the film actually took place (or not), as well as the book and film's shots at immortality, the film's theme remains the same. Not quite worthy of a song, granted; but more than worthy of a looksy. Trust me on that.",3,Better than you think,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,3540,"['film', 'book', 'necessarily', 'one-sided', 'interesting', 'read', 'see', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'bitched', 'director', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'writer/producer', 'Frank', 'Yablans', 'had', 'turned', 'memoir', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'film', 'movie', 'stare', 'be', 'least', 'so', 'could', 'hold', 'star', 'audience', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'read', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'save', 'mother', 'was', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'suffered', 'actuality', 'nothing', 'more', 'typical', 'behavior', 'alcoholic', 'and/or', 'bipolar', 'parent', 'as', 'well', 'OCD', 'manic', 'depressive', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'orphan', 'period', 'personalized', 'when', 'reality', 'was', 'obvious', 'more', 'mother', 'did', 'expectation', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'star', 'film', 'mother', 'was', 'reality', 'spirit', 'fact', 'everyone', ""story'-"", 'quote', 'PC', 'clich', 'eacute', 'few', 'stories', 'are', 'worth', 'experiencing', 'Christina', 'actually', 'one', 'save', 'fact', 'mother', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Sans', 'snotty', 'kid', 'town', 'drunk', 'Period.Naturally', 'film', 'was', 'savaged', 'critics', 'studio', 'almost', 'immediately', 'tried', 'turn', 'film', 'fortunes', 're-marketing', 'camp', 'classic', 'rather', 'serious', 'drama', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'profit', 'intervening', 'decades', 'become', 'cult', 'favorite', 'amongst', 'gays', 'Dunaway', 'did', 'however', 'get', 'well', 'deserved', 'kudos', 'including', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Circle', 'Awards', 'what', 'worth', 'post-release', 'arc', 'film', 'been', 'one', 'almost', 'constant', 'critical', 'cribbing-', 'especially', 'negative', 'vein', 'point', 'many', 'online', 'critics', 'flub', 'even', 'basic', 'facts', 'film', 'specific', 'scenes', 'Mainstream', 'critics', 'fared', 'just', 'poorly', 'Critical', 'superstar', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'lamented', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'same', 'basic', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'again', 'again', 'Baby', 'Christina', 'tries', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'tries', 'be', 'good', 'girl', 'tries', 'please', 'Mommie', 'Mommie', 'manic-depressive', 'who', 'brief', 'triumphs', 'long', 'savage', 'tirades', 'infecting', 'daughter', 'resentment', 'guilt', 'clearly', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'exact', 'opposite-', 'desperate', 'mother', 'doing', 'things', 'try', 'buy', 'daughter', 'love', 'brat', 'often', 'will', 'accept', 'only', 'terms', 'Recall', 'noted', 'Christina', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Just', 'watch', 'scenes', 'Christina', 'birthday', 'party', 'watching', 'mother', 'soap', 'opera', 'few', 'others-', 'most', 'notably', 'hanger/bathroom', 'scene', 'when', 'desperate', 'Joan', 'daughter', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'When', 'told', 'call', 'wanted', 'mean', 'clear', 'Crawford', 'least', 'filmic', 'version', 'sublimated', 'good', 'deal', 'real', 'nature', 'one', 'admittedly', 'not', 'suited', 'parenting', 'try', 'be', 'good', 'mother.But', 'sublimation', 'self', 'as', 'well', 'shared', 'commiseration', 'mother', 'daughter', 'essence', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'also', 'way', 'two', 'characters', 'define', 'love-', 'not', 'conquering', 'barely', 'managing', 'survive', 'odd', 'thing', 'though', 'decades', 'events', 'film', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'film', 'shots', 'immortality', 'film', 'theme', 'same', 'Not', 'quite', 'worthy', 'song', 'granted', 'more', 'worthy', 'looksy', 'Trust']",N/A

Its lunatic brilliance has certainly never been equalled in any movie I'm aware of. To those who wonder why there are no interviews with the cast or filmmakers, I ask: have you really taken a good look at the movie? Who would have the nerve to step forward and admit willing participation in film history's purest unintentional laff-riot? Can you imagine some representative from Paramount phoning Faye Dunaway to ask if she'll reminisce for a few hours on how the studio did its best to humiliate her? I think the original theatrical trailer for this movie tells the whole story; it's even more lurid and crazed than the trailers for 'The Exorcist' or 'The Omen' and you can see right away that the marketing people at Paramount knew the only way they were going to put the film over was to sell it as unchecked exploitation, mainly at the expense of Dunaway, who is made to look monstrously inhuman throughout the trailer's two or three minutes. It's certainly ironic, because the astounding Dunaway is the only reason to see this movie. I've watched this a lot and there are parts where her audacity floors me. I mean, how did she DARE?For myself, I'd love to have asked director Frank Perry if it was the studio's decision to recycle the kitchen set from &quot;Happy Days&quot; in the televised soap opera scene near the movie's end. Did cheapo Paramount really think no one would notice? Another question for Perry: how much of the film was recut by the studio? From the botched and inane editing job on view, I'd say a lot of it. Obviously, a chronicle of this film's production made on the studio's dime could never include anyone saying anything bad about Paramount and without that, I can't imagine the actors or filmmakers would have very much to say. Some enterprising film historian should step forward and write a book. What's Camille Paglia up to these days? Camille would probably note that the actress Alice Nunn, who plays the maid Helga in an introductory scene (she's the first to experience Crawford's cleanliness mania: &quot;You HAVE to MOVE the TREE!&quot;), is none other than infamous deceased truck driver Large Marge from &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure&quot;.",4,Mommie on DVD?

209614,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300213919,Ed Uyeshima,"[9, 11]","Even though she was the first runner-up for the New York Film Critics Award, Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming. To put it mildly, she is certainly watchable. However, every line she utters seems to have an exclamation point, and every gesture feels so grandiose that it's hard to figure out just what empathetic qualities Crawford had to engender her long-standing popularity. The glibly titled 2006 Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD package makes no bones that this is a movie that now caters to its huge gay following. Dunaway's snub in participating (as well as director Frank Perry's death) means having flamboyant director John Waters pinch-hit on the commentary track, and he manages to be both funny and insightful as he shares lots of apocryphal gossip and zingy one-liners to bring a whole new flavor to the execrable film.Among his many errors in judgment, Perry decided to film the story of Crawford's mid-to-late years (or more appropriately, her adopted daughter Christina's version of it) as if the movie was one of Crawford's own overripe films. The problem with his serious-minded approach is that it veers so unpredictably back and forth between soap opera and pure camp that the only consistency is its artifice. The story begins as the movie star's career is in free fall at MGM in 1939 (when she was forced to film a true atrocity called ""Ice Follies of 1939""). Aware of her professional dilemma, Crawford decides to adopt a baby regardless of being a twice-divorced single career woman. With the help of her studio lackey lover Greg Savitt, she adopts a daughter and later a son. Forever the publicity hound, Crawford presents her happy family in the most pretentious manner in front of the Hollywood press, yet hides a streak of cruelty that manifests itself into military-like parenting and savagely violent episodes. Not living up to her mother's exacting standards, Christina is shuttled off to boarding school and then convent school. She grows up to become a struggling young TV actress, as her mother becomes a corporate wife-turned widow slipping deeper into alcoholism.Perry makes a fundamental mistake in switching the film's narrative perspective from Joan to Christina midway through the film. The consequence is that neither of their stories is fully told with any objectivity, especially what could have happened in Crawford's earlier years that would have led to such excessive behavior. Instead, we are given an endless parade of over-the-top moments - the tree chopping, the tile scrubbing, the wire hangers, the out-of-control strangulation -  that the movie is simply too exhausting to keep up with the episodic storyline. With her reasonable resemblance to the movie star in full make-up, Dunaway carries herself confidently within the Crawford public persona and even achieves some remote moments of poignancy in between the shouting matches. Her strenuous efforts at verisimilitude, however, push her into an unsavory, demonic level of commitment to the larger-than-life role. It's too bad that almost everyone else is quite awful by comparison - Diana Scarwid frustratingly wooden as the adult Christina, Rutanya Alda irritatingly earnest in her blind devotion as Crawford's confidante Carol Ann, Steve Forrest looking like aged beef as Savitt and Howard Da Silva merely smarmy as MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer. The one exception is little Mara Hobel, who brings genuine cunning to the younger Christina.The Hollywood Royalty Edition includes three dishy featurettes. The 14-minute ""The Revival of Joan Crawford"" shows the genesis of the movie from Christina's red-hot best seller with contributions from Scarwid, Alda and producer Frank Yablans, who speaks candidly about Dunaway's tempestuous perfectionism. The 14-minute ""Life With Joan"" focuses on Dunaway's total absorption in the part during the stormy production and includes an extended opening sequence that was deleted before release.

209615,AA7W0CFRXF46L,6300213919,elfdart,"[2, 2]","Based on the scathing tell- all memoir of the same name, Mommie Dearest is the story of Joan Crawford's life `behind the scenes' told from the perspective of her adopted daughter Christine. For the record, I haven't read the memoir, nor have I done any extensive research on Joan Crawford. My experience of this family is based solely on this film.The story begins with a successful Crawford wishing she had a child of her own. She has a partner of sorts, a lawyer, and is established in her career, but she is unable to have children and therefore wants to adopt. At first the orphanages will not give her a child because of her somewhat notorious past. Ever persistent, she has her lawyer friend pull some strings and she receives a baby girl, who she names Christina. In the film, Crawford displayed a minor case of OCD and would personally get down on her knees and scrub her floors, even though she had several capable maids. In fact she would closely inspect her maid's work after she had finished to make sure it was done to her satisfaction. This, combined with the fact that her life was always under the eye of the press and the pressures of the film industry, created a sort of bipolar woman who would violently explode arbitrarily depending on her mood. Of course it was her daughter Christina who was made to suffer this. As Christina grew up her mother went from physically and emotionally bullying her, to sending her away to boarding school, to kicking her out of the house without a penny. When she died, Joan disinherits both her and her brother, and Christina ends foreshadowing the writing of her memoir.This story had enormous potential to be disturbing and terrifying. The clip I saw that made me want to watch the film had Faye Dunaway (Crawford) maniacally chopping off her daughter's hair after seeing her play-act in a mirror. With the right stuff, that can be psychologically messed up, but unfortunately Dunaway was the only one who stepped up to the plate. Watching this movie was like watching a small child whining `it's not fair' over and over again. Maybe Dunaway's acting was just too good and she was acting with inexperienced or poor actors, but I felt like every time Christina was mistreated by her mother she was faking her pain. I almost wanted bad things to happen to her because she was ruining what would otherwise have been a wonderful film... even when the actors switched. It felt like the actors playing Christina were trying too hard to be the sweet and innocent victim, while at the same time tried display a spiteful rebelliousness that wouldn't have been found in the innocent girl, and would have evolved into an all out rebellion in anyone who was truly discontented with their situation. So I didn't believe her pain at all and at the end of the movie was happy that her mother left her with nothing... taking my frustration with the actor out on the character.But Dunaway's performance was amazing. In my opinion she carried this movie on her back. She created the perfect combination of insane, power-hungry actress and caring mother. She was fascinating to watch and for her alone would I recommend that anyone watch this movie.",4,good,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,3185,"['Based', 'scathing', 'tell-', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'story', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'life', 'scenes', 'told', 'perspective', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Christine', 'record', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'memoir', 'have', 'done', 'extensive', 'research', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'experience', 'family', 'based', 'solely', 'film.The', 'story', 'successful', 'Crawford', 'wishing', 'had', 'child', 'own', 'partner', 'sorts', 'lawyer', 'established', 'career', 'unable', 'have', 'children', 'therefore', 'adopt', 'first', 'orphanages', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'child', 'somewhat', 'notorious', 'past', 'Ever', 'persistent', 'lawyer', 'friend', 'strings', 'baby', 'girl', 'who', 'Christina', 'film', 'Crawford', 'displayed', 'minor', 'case', 'OCD', 'would', 'personally', 'get', 'down', 'knees', 'scrub', 'floors', 'even', 'had', 'several', 'capable', 'maids', 'fact', 'would', 'closely', 'inspect', 'maid', 'work', 'had', 'finished', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'done', 'satisfaction', 'combined', 'fact', 'life', 'was', 'always', 'eye', 'press', 'pressures', 'film', 'industry', 'created', 'sort', 'bipolar', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'violently', 'explode', 'arbitrarily', 'depending', 'mood', 'course', 'was', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'suffer', 'Christina', 'grew', 'up', 'mother', 'went', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'bullying', 'sending', 'away', 'boarding', 'school', 'kicking', 'house', 'penny', 'When', 'died', 'Joan', 'brother', 'Christina', 'foreshadowing', 'writing', 'memoir.This', 'story', 'had', 'enormous', 'potential', 'be', 'disturbing', 'terrifying', 'clip', 'saw', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'had', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Crawford', 'maniacally', 'chopping', 'off', 'daughter', 'hair', 'seeing', 'play-act', 'mirror', 'right', 'stuff', 'can', 'be', 'psychologically', 'messed', 'up', 'unfortunately', 'Dunaway', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'small', 'child', 'whining', 'not', 'fair', 'over', 'again', 'Maybe', 'Dunaway', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'was', 'acting', 'inexperienced', 'poor', 'actors', 'felt', 'time', 'Christina', 'was', 'mistreated', 'mother', 'was', 'faking', 'pain', 'almost', 'wanted', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'was', 'ruining', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'actors', 'switched', 'felt', 'actors', 'playing', 'Christina', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'victim', 'same', 'time', 'tried', 'display', 'spiteful', 'rebelliousness', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'found', 'innocent', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'evolved', 'out', 'rebellion', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'discontented', 'situation', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'pain', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'mother', 'left', 'nothing', 'taking', 'frustration', 'actor', 'character.But', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'was', 'amazing', 'opinion', 'carried', 'movie', 'back', 'created', 'perfect', 'combination', 'insane', 'power-hungry', 'actress', 'caring', 'mother', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'alone', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

209619,A2BZRU1B3DY7BX,6300213919,GadgetGuy,"[1, 1]","As a film, ""Mommie Dearest"", is a mixed bag. It essentially tells the story of reported child abuse by one of America's top Golden Age of Hollywood stars, Joan Crawford. The film is based on the book of the same title by Miss Crawford's adopted daughter, Christine. Whether the abuse, or all of it, actually happened, has been debated over the years, and this review is making no claims one way or the other.The movie starts out well enough and I basically think it was well crafted, written, and acted (not including the 3 scenes where Faye Dunaway's ""interpretation"" of the scenes have made the film a joke to many). Other than Miss Dunaway's aforementioned 3 scenes), Faye does an amazing job of becoming Miss Crawford. Same goes for Diana Scarwid, Steve Forrest, and the rest of the cast. The production values are top notch, as is the score, set design, lighting, and costuming.This DVD pressing has pretty good quality for a DVD, and is a fairly clean print with mostly saturated colors, nice black levels, and normal film grain (not the overly noisy mess you see lately with some Blu Rays that are claimed to be film grain which is just an excuse to release a noisy, blurry, and sub par product).  The audio is a newly mixed 5.1 Dolby Digital English language soundtrack, an improvement over the mono, though the rear channels could have been utilized a bit more.",3,"Failry well done film that would have been taken more seriously without 3 scenes.

209620,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300213919,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[18, 23]","Given the film's current cult movie status one is tempted to believe the 1981 MOMMIE DEAREST was a critical debacle and a box office fiasco.  That is not really the case.  It is true that critics generally considered the film a failure, but many of them admired certain elements of it; it is also true that box office fell below expectations, but it was not a box office disaster in the same sense as the 1980 HEAVEN'S GATE or the 1981 INCHON.It is also true, however, that audiences howled with laughter at the film when it debuted, and although leading lady Faye Dunaway received a number of critical accolades for her performance as Joan Crawford, she also received an equal number of devastating reviews--and it was these that caught the spotlight.  It was a humiliating experience for an actress particularly noted for her perfectionism, and rumor has it that Dunaway feels the film ended her career as a major film star.  Whatever the case, Dunaway quickly developed a strategic silence about the film that she has maintained for some two decades.Seen today, it is easy to identify the core problems of the film.  The most obvious is the script, which is extremely inconsistent in quality and yet perversely consistent in a style that can only be described as soap opera hot-house to the nth degree.  This is particularly true of the dialogue assigned to Dunaway.  Infamous lines such as ""No More Wire Hangers Ever,"" ""Tina! Bring Me The Axe,"" and ""I'm Not Mad At You, I'm Mad At The Dirt"" have become a staple of every drag queen from Maine to California.But the ultimate disaster here is director Frank Perry.  Joan Crawford was a larger-than-life personality; the role is written to reflect this; Dunaway plays the role as it was written.  But it would seem  Perry sought to heighten the effect: the rest of the cast is extremely, extremely restrained.  This must have seemed like a good idea in theory, but it proves a terrible mistake in actual fact.  No matter what Dunaway does with it, she can NEVER seem less than wildly overwrought in comparison to the rest of the cast, and the effect is very peculiar indeed.The designs and the cinematography also clash in an incredibly bizarre way.  There is absolutely no doubt that everything about the film is exactingly accurate: that is indeed the look of the period, right down to the very last detail.  But the photography is extremely flat, and you are constantly aware that the sets are indeed movie sets, the costumes are movie costumes, and so on.  Yes, it is all beautifully rendered, but you can't buy into it as anything real.The Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD edition offers a good but by no means flawless print of the film and several bonuses.  It is unfortunate that they are not particularly illuminating.  While director John Water's commentary is enjoyable, he approaches the film only as a fan.  Even so, Water does make several telling points: many of the things that Crawford does which seem so odd (bathing the face in ice, for example) are actually commonplace cosmetic necessities for movie stars; many of the things the film treats as abuse were, although carried to wild extremes in the story, typical of child-rearing practices of the 1940s and 1950s.There are also three short documentaries featuring a number of cast members, most notably Diana Scarwid; these are actually entertaining for the fact that those who appear still seem to regard the film as ""a good movie.""  The only really significant interview is with Lypsinka, an artist who has driven Crawford impersonations to the level of wicked satire and high art, and who offers a number of interesting personal insights into the iconography involved.Like the film itself, the bonus package has two great failures.  The first is that Faye Dunaway does not appear in interview or commentary; it would be very interesting to have her own take on the film, its failures, and its afterlife.  Given her sentiment, it is an understandable non-involvement; less understandable, however, that there is not so much as a potted biography of the actress--or indeed of any member of the cast, for there are no written notes of any kind.The second great failure of the bonus package is that it contains no factual information on either Joan or Christina Crawford.  There is no indication here that those who knew both women are sharply divided over the accuracy of the portraits both here and in the book by Christina Crawford from which the film is drawn.  A number of people, including actresses Betty Hutton and June Allyson, supported Christina Crawford's accounts, but an equal number, including actress Myrna Loy and Christina's younger siblings, flatly stated that Christina's accustions were largely fictious.When all is said and done, and in spite of performances and moments that are actually extremely good in isolation, MOMMIE DEAREST is a film that falls under the ""so bad it's good"" category of cult films.  While I am taken aback by the bizarre nature of the movie, I personally find the amusement involved almost as dark as the movie's plot; it is not among my cult film favorites.  Even so, I can understand the appeal it has for others, and I give it three stars on that basis.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,"Mommie Deadly: An Alternate Reality In A Galaxy Far, Far Away",1149724800,"06

(Christina Crawford actually admitted that the movie wasn't to her liking, as it was overly dramatic and not well scripted) Based on the best selling book by Christina Crawford, this movie is Hollywood camp at it's best. It begins in the mid 1930's when Crawford was making &quot;The Ice Follies of 1939&quot; and began thinking of adopting a child. Denied once for being a single parent, a male companion/lawyer helps her achieve her dream of becoming a mother by pulling a few strings in town. Trying her best to be &quot;the perfect mother&quot;, Crawford begins with simple acts of cruelty but labels them as life lessons: Giving Christina's birthday gifts to the orphans (a clear publicty act) to show the act of giving, Cutting off Christina's hair when Joan finds the little girl imitating her in the mirror to show respect, and serving her the same piece of meat that Christina refused to eat for three nights - because EVERYTHING is a contest between these two! Oh, don't forget the part where Christina is beaten with a wire hanger for not using a silk hanger for her dress. And it only gets worse! When she walks in on Joan and one of her many boyfriends, Christina is sent away to private school, where after she meets a boy and is later caught in an innocent encounter, is brought home. After Joan confronts her, the two have a huge cat fight and Joan has to be pulled off of Christina when trying to stranngle her. Joan sends Christina to Catholic school and marries Al Steele, president of Pepsi. He dies after they move to NYC and Christina tries her hand at acting in soap operas. When Christina has ovarian pains and is hospitalized, GUESS who fills in for her 35 year old character? Her 60+ year old mother! THIS IS CAMPY DRAMA AT ITS BEST! Finally, she and Christina make somewhat of a &quot;peace&quot; before Joan dies...at the reading of the will, Christina gets the shock of her life! All in all, this movie is worth watching at least once, although its so horribly dramatic that you shouldn't feel bad if you laugh through the more &quot;serious&quot; parts of it. Faye Dunaway said that this film nearly ruined her career and while that may be so, she gives a GREAT performance as Crawford - look, voice and all! The sets are absolutely beautiful and the costumes are great. Go ahead and buy it. Save it for a day when you're depressed about your childhood.

209632,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300213919,James D. Leverton,"[11, 13]","What exactly went wrong with &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; the legendarily bad 1981 film version of Christina Crawford's scathing literary attack on her film legend mother Joan Crawford?  My God, where do I begin?  This film misses the boat in so many ways it's amazing that, unlike other bad movies, it manages to be enormously entertaining--much more so than many far better movies.  With its histrionic and mesmerizing good/bad performances by Faye Dunaway and Diana Scarwid, its awful, irony-free direction by veteran Frank Perry, and a script which basically connects the dots without offering any insight whatsoever, what could have been a scorching examination of a troubled life turns into campy, though fascinating, hoot that has become an all-time cult favorite.The film actually purports to seriously examine Crawford's dual lives--her carefully choreographed public persona as a caring, generous philanthropist who selflessly adopts homeless children to give them a better life, and her alleged private alter ego, a megalomiacal, nearly psychotic and incredibly vain harridan who only adopts the kids (who she actually comes to despise) to feed her public persona.  (At least, that's what we're to believe if oldest daughter Christina has her way, since the film is based on the biography she wrote after her late mother cut her and brother Christopher out of her will.)  The truth?  We'll never know since Crawford and her cronies are all deceased, and while Christina and Christopher testify to its accuracy, Crawford's younger children (who are MIA in the film, of course) have said it's a load of hooey.  (So did director friend George Cukor before his death, although others have said Crawford's abusive behavior was an unspoken, but open, secret in Hollywood.)The problem is the film doesn't even try to be balanced, and director Perry, who gave us the excellent films &quot;David and Lisa&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife,&quot; unfortunately treats the entire saga as a deadly serious tragedy and exhibits no restraint whatsoever.  So a story which would only have worked if Crawford's tantrums and abuse had been downplayed becomes a laugh riot as Dunaway transforms this legendary beauty into a ranting gargoyle, complete with cold-cream covered face, screaming &quot;No wire hangers!  Ever!!!&quot; and beating young Christina with a can of cleanser.Much has been written about Dunaway's performance, and to her defense, she has herself blamed Perry's ham-fisted direction.  Either way, this performance spectacularly ended the A-list career of probably the biggest female movie star of the late '60's-early '70's.  However, even though she overacts badly in the abuse sequences, Dunaway is often exceptional in other sequences, no more so than in the film's final scenes, when she essays Crawford's deterioration from the top of the movie A-list to pathetic has-been, relegated to bad Z-level horror movies and even ridiculously subbing for her sick daughter in a soap opera, even though she's forty-years too old for the role.  Dunaway is also excellent at conveying the almost transparent hypocrisy of Crawford's public persona.  But what makes the film so fascinating is just as we sense she's entering Oscar territory, out come the wire hangers, cold cream and cleanser and the only award we sense she'll receive is the Golden Raspberry.  And as for the two actresses who play Christina, Mara Hobel is just fine as the young Christina, but then poor Diana Scarwid, who is actually an excellent actress, enters the picture and she becomes Dunaway's young counterpart, outrageously overacting at times and at other times acting with admirable restraint.  The year before, this talented newcomer received an Oscar nomination for &quot;Inside Moves.&quot;  Unfortunately, this film ended whatever chance she had at anything other than a sporadic film career.  So when two fine actresses have their careers derailed by one film, who do you blame?  Frank Perry, take a bow.As for the script, again it is strictly connect-the-dots, moving from one legendary scene to another as Crawford adopts the children, rises to the heights of stardom, exploits the children, feigns illness to win an Oscar, beats the children, marries into the Pepsi empire, berates the entire Pepsi executive board after her husband's death with the film's other great camp line:  &quot;Don't f--- with me, fellas!,&quot; fades into has-been obscurity, tries to sabotage her daughter's happiness and adult career aspirations, etc. etc. etc.  Unfortunately, there is no insight whatsoever into why Crawford is the way she is.  She's just a monster.  It's as simple as that.The best thing that can be said about &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; is that it isn't your typical whitewashed Hollywood biography.  It at least shows a big star with all her warts.  Unfortunately, that's all it shows is the warts, and that's extremely unfair.  I can't believe there wasn't another side to Joan Crawford, that it was all image and illusion.  Christina and the filmmakers would have been well-advised to present one, as it would have helped further their cause.  Instead, we're left with a lot of unintentional laughs and the rubble of what could have been a performance for the ages and a rare, serious look at a devastating national tragedy, child abuse.  Instead, we get a legendarily maligned camp fest.",3,"A fascinating, campy hoot.",1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,5391,"['What', 'exactly', 'went', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'quot',

What with the tiny cast, the cheapo sets (one scene actually recycles the kitchen set from ""Happy Days"") and almost no location shooting, it's very easy to imagine that most of the film's budget went to Dunaway's hair, makeup and wardrobe which are pretty amazing in their authenticity.

Whether she's frantically hacking down her rose bushes in the middle of the night after having been fired by MGM, or beating poor little blonde ringlet Christina (Mara Hobel) with a wire coat-hanger while ghoulishly smothered in white face cream, she pulls out all the stops to give us a most extreme display of drunken, sadistic cruelty and madness, although it is difficult not to laugh when she goes boss-eyed.

It played on cable TV frequently.  This movie is based on Joan Crawford's adopted daughter Christina's autobiography titled ""Mommie Dearest"", which was published in 1978.  Basically this movie is about legendary movie star Joan Crawford's personal turmoil throughout her professional life as a movie star while her career was declining and her bizarre and neurotic behavior while raising her adopted daughter Christina and adopted son Christopher.  Christina alleges that her mother was verbally and physically abusive in her book, and the movie portrays this.  The movie's campiness makes it even more entertaining than it normally would have been, in my opinion.  You'll see Joan Crawford (played brilliantly by Faye Dunaway) go berserk many times throughout the movie, especially since she's a fanatic for cleanliness.  Some of her tirades are plain laugh-out-loud funny, but it's classic stuff.  This movie got mixed reviews when it came out, but has since become a cult classic with many classic lines.  I give it 5 stars all the way.  Faye Dunaway was made up very well to look so much like Joan Crawford.The music is good and is by Henry Mancini.The rock band Blue Oyster Cult's 1981 song ""Joan Crawford"" was inspired by this movie.

The dialogue is awful, the directing is awful, and Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford makeup makes her closely resemble Dr. Frank N. Furter from ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" However, I watched this film again recently, and while it does have several scenes that go so over the top they orbit Jupiter, it isn't that bad of a movie.Faye Dunaway's performance has been maligned over the years, and this is the movie that destroyed her career in one fell swoop. But it is a great performance. Dunaway excels at playing Joan Crawford, a monstrous mother who is frighteningly out of control. A lesser actress might have tried to tone down Crawford, but Dunaway takes the character to extremes that no other sane woman would dare. Her most infamous scenes, the ""no wire hangers . . . ever"" and her midnight garden rampage in which she tells her daughter to ""give me the axe,"" are nevertheless examples of powerful acting. Dunaway digs deep to deliver the intense performance she does, and the child abuse scenes are disturbing because of her. It is the right performance, but it's in the wrong movie. Frank Perry's direction is so off that he changes what could have been a great movie into a camp howler. Fault him for the laughs, not Faye Dunaway.Diana Scarwid also does a decent job as the older Christina Crawford. Character actor Howard Da Silva is also good in his brief role of Louis B. Mayer. Otherwise, the acting is forgettable. ""Mommie Dearest"" does have a lot of laughs in it, and it is a bad movie.

209650,A3165255PFGM4Y,6300213919,J. Travis,"[8, 12]","This three star rating, mind you, pertains only to the extras featured on this DVD. I love the movie, more for Faye Dunaway's amazing performance then the campy script and flawed direction. ""Mommie Dearest"" will remain a camp classic for reasons only obvious to anyone who has sat through it more then once. Faye Dunaway has bitterly denounced this movie, and will go ballistic on any interviewer who brings the film up. It's sad too, because this is her most accomplished performance to date. Even more then ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and her Oscar-winning work in ""Network"". The film released in 1981 to scolding reviews and a bad press release. Apparently director Frank Perry really did intend to make this a full-blown drama, but audiences begged to differ, laughing in the aisles whenever baby Christina got slapped, dissed or tortured by the evil that was Joan Crawford. Dunaway deserved an Oscar for this role, I'm sorry. The fact that she didn't even get a nomination boggles me, because this is something no other actress could have pulled off as skillfully as her. (Dunaway did come in a strong second at the New York Film Critics Circle for Best Actress 1981).If ""Mommie Dearest"" suffers in translation for most critics, the extras on this 'Hollywood Royalty' edition are no exception. We basically have a 45-minute documentary consolidated into three different sections, yet the producers of this DVD want you to believe its ""Three Seperate Documenatries"", when in reality, it's basically the same people on each one, wearing the same clothes, with the same music, AND the same movie clips from Joan Crawford's infamous western in 1954. They couldn't get the ""Mildred Pierce"" clips? Since Faye Dunaway is not part of the interviewed cast, we instead get the has-beens who have not had substantial careers since ""Mommie Dearest"". This includes Diana Scawird- who played the older Christina in the movie, and who you might remember as Michelle Pfeiffer's best friend in the 2000 flick ""What Lies Beneath"". Plastic surgery has not been kind to Ms. Scarwird, who looks like she spent more time stretching her face for the interview then her entire role in the movie. Also on hand is the loyal housekeeper in the movie, but I sadly have forgotten her name and am too lazy to look on the back of the DVD. Suffice it to say, along with the producer of the movie, these three people apparently lived on Mars for the past 25 years, since they all do nothing but praise the movie's ""great script"" and ""wonderful direction"". What trade papers did THEY read? The movie was universally panned for all aspects BUT Dunaway's performance. Even if she won a Razzie, with the exception of a few, most people had no problem with her, but did have a problem with the rest of the movie.The writer and producer really got under my skin. He did have the decency to admit ""I did have a tiff with Faye the first day of shooting, but then it was fine from then on there."" You know what? I smell bull shiiit. Dunaway even noted in her great autobiography she had a terrible time making this movie, that it was an exhausting and agonizing experience. But the people on the DVD 2006 documentary make it seem like it was a walk in the park. Just like the movie, they want you to believe everything is just finnne and dandy.There is one exception. Since I am upset there are no deleted scenes, at least the funny and very insightful John Waters (director of ""Serial Mom"") lets us hear his thoughts on ""Mommie Dearest"" in a very entertaining commentary. Waters seems to be with you in your living room as he talks, he's that fun. He also makes some very important observations during the film, like how many movie stars behave just how Crawford was panned to act, how Christina should be grateful she was adopted by Joan Crawford and not those strict as rocks Nuns. Also, he makes it clear this is a movie gay audiences love, because it's a way to cheer for the bitchy, rich Queen of the Movies who we love more when she's ripping other people to shreds.I'd say if you really liked this movie, buy the DVD.

209653,A2EULQRKC10EOM,6300213919,"K. Coburn ""movie fan""","[6, 10]","I first saw this film on cable a year after it was released. I found it extremely compelling and in no way campy. I was about 11 years old then.Having grown up and now out of the closet, I can sort of understand the campiness and over the top emoting of certain scenes, but I have to ask: doesn't it bother anyone that somehow the subject of child abuse is being used as camp value?I know there are two sides to this coin: those who believe Christina was brave in coming forth about her child abouse and those who think she was just a spoiled, ungrateful brat who did this only because Joan left her nothing in the will and that Joan wasn't around to defend herself. I tend to slightly fall with the latter.I know much has been made about Faye Dunaway's performance. I think it's one of her best. For all those who say it's over the top, I would say: how could you not play a star form the Golden Age of Hollywood and not be larger than life? Look at Cate Blanchette when you first saw her as Katherine Hepburn in ""The Aviator""? She came on like gangbusters until she settled down and we as the audience saw her as Ms. Hepburn I think it would have to do with the direction. Not to put director Frank Perry down, but I think if a much stronger director had been guiding Faye, I don't think she would've received much criticism. I still think it's a great job.The problem with the film is that there's no continuity to the scenes or why Joan's emotions went from one extreme to the other. One minute she's won the Ocar for Mildred Pierce, the next is the (in)famous ""No Wire Hangers"" scene. You don't know what year it was when incidents occured unless you've read the book or followed Joan's career thoroughly.One thing about Joan Crawford: she always remained loyal to her fans. As she said ""They're the ones who really made me!"". I wish more celebrities would remember that in todays age.But there are some very powerful scenes: I've always loved the opening scenes of Joan getting ready for the days work at MGM, obsessively cleaning her hands and face; the cruelty of Hollywood and MGM in particular as Louis B. Mayer (Howard DaSilva) almost casually letting Joan go from Metro as she is dealt the ultimate humiliation off being labled box office poison; the scene where Joan tells Christina she's broke and scared about her financial situation; and of course the scene that is most memorable: Joan facing down the board members of Pepsi after Al Steele (Harry Goaz)has passed on. It's over the top, but in the best way: showing that this woman is not going to be brushed aside so easliy. It's Faye/Joan at her best.I disagree with the Golden Raspberry awards on this picture. I don't think it was the Worst Picture of that year(Endless Love anyone?)and Ms. Dunaway wasn't the Worst Actress. It's not a perfect film, but it's compellingly watchable from beginning to end.I loved the supplementary material presented. John Waters supplied a great audio commentary and the featuretts were very fund. Might I say that both Rutanya Alda and Diana Scarwid looked stunningly beautiful. It's too bad that Steve Forrest and Mara Hobel weren't there to share their thoughts and feelings.It's too bad that Ms. Dunaway won't speak about the film anymore. I don't think she has anything to be embarrassed about. This is one of her best performances and I would indeed say it rates up there with work in Chinatown, Bonnie and Clyde and Network.",4,"Might as well have ""Propery of MGM ""tattooed on my backside",1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,3435,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'cable', 'year', 'was', 'released', 'found', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'way', 'campy', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'then.Having', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'closet', 'can', 'sort', 'understand', 'campiness', 'top', 'emoting', 'certain', 'scenes', 'have', 'ask', ""n't"", 'bother', 'anyone', 'subject', 'child', 'abuse', 'being', 'used', 'camp', 'value', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'coin', 'who', 'believe', 'Christina', 'was', 'brave', 'coming', 'forth', 'child', 'abouse', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'spoiled', 'ungrateful', 'brat', 'who', 'did', 'only', 'Joan', 'left', 'nothing', 'will', 'Joan', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'defend', 'tend', 'slightly', 'fall', 'latter.I', 'know', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'who', 'say', 'top', 'would', 'say', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'play', 'star', 'form', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'be', 'larger', 'life', 'Look', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Aviator', 'came', 'gangbusters', 'settled', 'down', 'audience', 'saw', 'Ms.', 'Hepburn', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'direction', 'Not', 'put', 'director', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'down', 'think', 'much', 'stronger', 'director', 'had', 'been', 'guiding', 'Faye', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'received', 'much', 'criticism', 'still', 'think', 'great', 'job.The', 'problem', 'film', 'continuity', 'scenes', 'why', 'Joan', 'emotions', 'went', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'One', 'minute', 'won', 'Ocar', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'next', 'famous', 'No', 'Wire', 'Hangers', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'year', 'was', 'when', 'incidents', 'occured', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'followed', 'Joan', 'career', 'thing', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'always', 'remained', 'loyal', 'fans', 'said', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'wish', 'more', 'celebrities', 'would', 'remember', 'todays', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Joan', 'getting', 'ready', 'days', 'work', 'MGM', 'obsessively', 'cleaning', 'hands', 'face', 'cruelty', 'Hollywood', 'MGM', 'particular', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'almost', 'casually', 'letting', 'Joan', 'go', 'Metro', 'dealt', 'ultimate', 'humiliation', 'being', 'labled', 'box', 'office', 'poison', 'scene', 'where', 'Joan', 'Christina', 'broke', 'scared', 'financial', 'situation', 'course', 'scene', 'most', 'memorable', 'Joan', 'facing', 'down', 'board', 'members', 'Pepsi', 'Al', 'Steele', 'Harry', 'Goaz', 'passed', 'top', 'best', 'way', 'showing', 'woman', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'brushed', 'aside', 'so', 'easliy', 'Faye/Joan', 'best.I', 'disagree', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'awards', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'Worst', 'Picture', 'year', 'Endless', 'Love', 'anyone', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'was', ""n't"", 'Worst', 'Actress', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'compellingly', 'watchable', 'beginning', 'end.I', 'loved', 'supplementary', 'material', 'presented', 'John', 'Waters', 'supplied', 'great', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featuretts', 'were', 'very', 'fund', 'Might', 'say', 'Rutanya', 'Alda', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'looked', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'too', 'bad', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'share', 'thoughts', 'feelings.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'wo', ""n't"", 'speak', 'film', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'about', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'would', 'indeed', 'say', 'rates', 'there', 'work', 'Chinatown', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Network']",N/A

This movie was intended to be a drama that illustrates that being involved in the life of a movie star is not all peaches and cream.

That is if that were all this movie was about.In fact this movie hits and misses on a number of levels with more hits than misses. So let's focus on those. The film is based on the behind the scenes tell all tale of Hollywood actress Joan Crawford, past her prime and in need of something more fulfilling, she adopts a young baby girl and names her Christina, soon to be followed by a young boy named Christopher. All seems fine and dandy until the real Joan begins to show through as the children start to grow up.When Christina begins to get more attention than Joan at things like her own birthday party, the terrible Joan surfaces, forcing Christina to do things like give away all of the gifts that she gets to the orphans of the world save for one item. But by this time Christina has learned to play the same sort of manipulative games her mother does and works her way into one extra gift.The film focuses on the battles of wills between the two, watching as they pick at each other, fight with one another and eventually come to terms with one another. While Joan as portrayed by Faye Dunaway comes off as a raving lunatic most of the time, Christina (played by Mara Hobel as a child and Diana Scarwid in young adulthood) comes off as a spoiled brat who has just as many problems. Whether or not those were inflicted upon her by Joan is something that could be the topic of a psychiatrist symposium I would imagine, but at the same time the similarities between the two far outweigh the differences.So much for the surface story we as viewers are given. Because not only are we entertained by the story itself, we are given the rare treat of a movie that many have called a camp classic. Its also become a favorite (or so you might hear) of the gay community, thrilled with the over the top antics and make up used by Dunaway making her Joan convincing at one point and way out in left field at others. The penciled in eyebrows and bright red lipstick at times make her look more like a female impersonator than an actress portraying another actress. But somehow she makes it believable at the same time.At the height of her own career when the film was made 25 years ago, Dunaway is said to have campaigned for the role. She does it well but never up to Oscar winning standards. It's more of a People's Choice Awards type performance, where the actor is awarded for making the audience question who the real person behind the character seen on screen is. Her performance is one that makes you want to go out and rent a Joan Crawford movie just to see if the crazy woman seen here was showing any signs of strain in her real movies as well.There is little way that you could walk away from this without knowing the catch phrases that have been repeated ad nauseum since. ""Did you scrub the floor today?!"", ""Why must EVERYTHING be a contest?"" and of course ""No...wire...hangers!"". It seems that these phrases have done more to promote the repetitive viewing of this film than the mere knowledge of subject matter or performances would in another film.The new release of the DVD is called ""The Hollywood Royalty Edition"" and sad but true it not only reflects jokingly on a line from the film but on a time few remember these days. There actually was a time when Hollywood starts were looked upon as the American version of royalty. Back when stars were made by studios and PR men. These days they're more often concerned with the impression they leave as political pundits as opposed to being well crafted actors. It's enough to make you miss the good old days.The new DVD comes complete with the new film as well as a photo gallery, the trailer for the film, three behind the scenes featurettes and a commentary track by the king of camp, director John Waters. What seems to be missing is a track or short on the main actress Faye Dunaway. During one of the extras here we are told that she has for some reason tried to distance herself from this film. Odd since she tried to hard to get the part let alone makeover herself to ""be"" Joan Crawford.What we are left at in the end is not just another Hollywood bio pic, but a movie that goes beneath the surface to the underlying problems of a tortured soul. I never thought of that years ago when I first saw this film. Upon repeated viewing, the campness wears thing and beneath is revealed a woman trapped in her own plastic world, a woman who knew little about how to show/give love and a woman who wanted nothing more than to be loved.",3,YES MOMMIE,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,4646,"['could', 'be', 'shortest', 'summation', 'DVD', 'release', 'ever', 'biographical', 'story', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'were', 'movie', 'was', 'about.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'number', 'levels', 'more', 'hits', 'misses', 'So', 'let', 'focus', 'film', 'based', 'scenes', 'tell', 'tale', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'prime', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'young', 'baby', 'girl', 'Christina', 'soon', 'be', 'followed', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Christopher', 'fine', 'dandy', 'real', 'Joan', 'show', 'children', 'start', 'grow', 'up.When', 'Christina', 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'Joan', 'things', 'own', 'birthday', 'party', 'terrible', 'Joan', 'surfaces', 'forcing', 'Christina', 'do', 'things', 'give', 'away', 'gifts', 'orphans', 'world', 'save', 'one', 'item', 'time', 'Christina', 'learned', 'play', 'same', 'sort', 'manipulative', 'games', 'mother', 'way', 'one', 'extra', 'gift.The', 'film', 'battles', 'wills', 'two', 'watching', 'pick', 'other', 'fight', 'one', 'eventually', 'come', 'terms', 'one', 'Joan', 'portrayed', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'off', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'most', 'time', 'Christina', 'played', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'child', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'young', 'adulthood', 'off', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'problems', 'Whether', 'not', 'were', 'inflicted', 'Joan', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'topic', 'psychiatrist', 'symposium', 'would', 'imagine', 'same', 'time', 'similarities', 'two', 'far', 'outweigh', 'differences.So', 'much', 'surface', 'story', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'entertained', 'story', 'are', 'given', 'rare', 'treat', 'movie', 'many', 'have', 'called', 'camp', 'classic', 'also', 'become', 'favorite', 'so', 'might', 'hear', 'gay', 'community', 'thrilled', 'top', 'antics', 'make', 'up', 'used', 'Dunaway', 'making', 'Joan', 'convincing', 'one', 'point', 'way', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'others', 'penciled', 'eyebrows', 'bright', 'red', 'lipstick', 'times', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'female', 'impersonator', 'actress', 'portraying', 'actress', 'somehow', 'believable', 'same', 'time.At', 'height', 'own', 'career', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Dunaway', 'said', 'have', 'campaigned', 'role', 'well', 'never', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'standards', 'more', 'People', 'Choice', 'Awards', 'type', 'performance', 'where', 'actor', 'awarded', 'making', 'audience', 'question', 'who', 'real', 'person', 'character', 'seen', 'screen', 'performance', 'one', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'rent', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'crazy', 'woman', 'seen', 'here', 'was', 'showing', 'signs', 'strain', 'real', 'movies', 'little', 'way', 'could', 'walk', 'away', 'knowing', 'catch', 'have', 'been', 'repeated', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Did', 'scrub', 'floor', 'today', 'Why', 'must', 'EVERYTHING', 'be', 'contest', 'course', 'wire', 'hangers', 'phrases', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'promote', 'repetitive', 'viewing', 'film', 'mere', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'matter', 'performances', 'would', 'film.The', 'new', 'release', 'DVD', 'called', 'Hollywood', 'Royalty', 'Edition', 'sad', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'jokingly', 'line', 'film', 'time', 'few', 'remember', 'days', 'actually', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'starts', 'were', 'looked', 'American', 'version', 'royalty', 'Back', 'when', 'stars', 'were', 'made', 'studios', 'PR', 'men', 'days', ""'re"", 'more', 'often', 'concerned', 'impression', 'leave', 'as', 'political', 'pundits', 'opposed', 'being', 'well', 'crafted', 'actors', 'enough', 'make', 'miss', 'good', 'old', 'days.The', 'new', 'DVD', 'complete', 'new', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'photo', 'gallery', 'trailer', 'film', 'three', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'track', 'king', 'camp', 'director', 'John', 'Waters', 'What', 'be', 'missing', 'track', 'short', 'main', 'actress', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'one', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'told', 'reason', 'tried', 'distance', 'film', 'Odd', 'tried', 'hard', 'get', 'part', 'let', 'alone', 'makeover', 'be', 'Joan', 'Crawford.What', 'are', 'left', 'end', 'not', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'bio', 'pic', 'movie', 'surface', 'underlying', 'problems', 'tortured', 'soul', 'never', 'thought', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'campness', 'thing', 'beneath', 'revealed', 'woman', 'trapped', 'own', 'plastic', 'world', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'little', 'how', 'show/give', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'loved']",N/A

Faye Dunaway gives all she's got and comes out smelling deliciously rotten as the legendary movie actress Joan Crawford who despises wire hangers and adopted children.  Never an actress has been so frightfully dedicated to a role as Dunaway is throughout this 139 minute gem.  She utterly acts as if her life depends on it, which probably does since she was given the A-list boot after the release of the film. To lovers of high standard bad cinema, however, she will always be the queen of the ball.  Her scene-stealing performance definitely deserves top honors as the biggest bad movie we love moment there is.  In fact, everything in MOMMIE DEAREST deserves the highest praise, from its big budget grade B-movie look to its many jaw-dropping, pleasure-giving sequences (again, wire hangers anyone?).

Sherwin,"[4, 4]","Mommie Dearest tells the story of life in Joan's Crawford's household primarily as seen through the eyes of her adopted daughter Christina. The film has a great cast and the action moves swiftly, keeping your attention at all times. I must confess I cringed at a few scenes that others found funny; but then again in many ways I identified with Christina more than I identified with Joan Crawford! The cinematography is excellent and the choreography is also quite professional. I am surprised that it opened to mixed reviews; perhaps some people mistook some over-the-top scenes as inartistic camp, which, even if it was camp, wasn't that bad at all.When the action starts, we quickly meet Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) who prides herself in being ""Hollywood Royalty"" and having the nicest home in Brentwood. She slaves tirelessly to fight to be a star at MGM studios even though the word on the grapevine is that her career is beginning to go downhill. She is romantically involved with lawyer Greg Savitt (Steve Forrest) who works at MGM; and he tries to get her better movie parts. He also manages to get Joan a baby which she desperately wants to fill a void in her life. Greg has his reservations about Joan's suitability for motherhood as he sees Joan pushing the young Christina (Mara Hobel) too much in swimming pool races and more; but he does nothing about it. Joan even adopts another orphan she calls Christopher but we still see Joan through the eyes of Christina. This makes sense because this movie, as you may well know, is based on Christina's tell-all book about her childhood and adolescence with Joan Crawford for a mother.And life with Joan isn't easy. Joan beats her daughter and flies into rampages over cleaning a bathroom floor that was already quite clean to begin with; and the ""no more wire hangers"" part of the same scene has Joan beating Christina even more when Christina was way too young to take care of herself. When on one occasion Christina accidentally discovers Joan with a man, Joan is so horrified at the negative publicity this could create that she sends Christina off to a boarding school--only to eventually pull an older Christina (Diana Scarwid) back out of the school after an innocent kissing moment with a boy.Joan perceives Christina as wanting everything to be a ""contest;"" is this true? Does Christina see her mother for what her mother really is? Why does Joan adopt a second child if things with Christina weren't always so smooth? What about the effects of Joan's drinking, affairs with a lot of men and being dropped from both MGM and Warner Brothers Studios--just how much tougher will this make their lives? What happens when Christina gets older and is too ill to play her role on a soap opera? No plot spoilers here--watch the movie and find out!I agree with reviewers who write that it's a shame that nobody from the Crawford family cared to participate in the extras that we get on this DVD. Sure, it's great to hear what the producer/screenwriter Frank Yablans and John Waters have to say about the making of the film; but of course this just isn't the same.We'll probably never know for certain just how much truth there is to Christina's book and this movie--but one thing is clear: even if just half of this is true, Joan must have been a very intimidating mother and I assume life with her must have been difficult at least sometimes as Joan Crawford was quite the perfectionist.Overall, Mommie Dearest is a very good film, however true or biased it may be; and I recommend it for fans of Joan Crawford and even for fans of biopics.

I have learned that Faye does not want to discuss this film with anyone--fans or any person interviewing her. Why she doesn't want to discuss the subject of this movie is anyone's guess. Some reports have said that she disowns the movie, she was hurt by the critics, etc. But personally, I feel that Faye was so wonderful in the role and that she did a fabulous job.

Faye Dunaway's performance as Joan Crawford is a shrill, screeching caricature. The script is very, very bad (""I'm not mad at YOU, Helga, I'm mad at the DIRT!!""). And the entire approach of the film is one of exploitation, rather than as an honest portrayal of a notorious case of child abuse.Now, if you can get past the knowledge that the story is allegedly true, the film becomes one of the best campy comedies of all time. Faye Dunaway's performance becomes a comedic masterpiece, topped off by the quirk she has of going crosseyed when she screams in anger (she does that A LOT in Mommie Dearest). Whether she's scolding the maid for leaving dirt on the living room floor, chopping up her rose garden, hitting her daughter with wire hangers and Dutch Boy cleanser or trying to strangle her daughter to death, Dunaway overacts to a comic tee. She snarls, swears, howls and screams like a rabid wolf crossed with a teamster. Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid as, respectively, the child and adult versions of Crawford's daughter, Christina, under the circumstances, give very good performances. But they're completely overshadowed by Dunaway's performance. It's unintentionally, hilariously funny.I know that there's nothing funny about child abuse and that Christina Crawford, if her story is true, deserves great sympathy for the years of trauma she endured. However, Mommie Dearest is so campy and so overdone and so cartoonish that the only way you can endure it is by not taking it seriously.""DON'T @#$%& WITH ME, FELLAS!!!!""",3,Either a complete disaster or a great comedy,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,1769,"['ACTUAL', 'RATING', '*', 'serious', 'drama*****', 'comedyFor', 'who', 'read', 'liked', 'book', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'approach', 'film', 'version', 'utter', 'sincerity', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'movie', 'circumstances', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'shrill', 'screeching', 'caricature', 'script', 'very', 'very', 'bad', ""'m"", 'not', 'mad', 'YOU', 'Helga', ""'m"", 'mad', 'DIRT', 'entire', 'approach', 'film', 'one', 'exploitation', 'rather', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'notorious', 'case', 'child', 'abuse.Now', 'can', 'get', 'knowledge', 'story', 'allegedly', 'true', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'campy', 'comedies', 'time', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'topped', 'off', 'quirk', 'going', 'crosseyed', 'when', 'screams', 'anger', 'LOT', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'scolding', 'maid', 'leaving', 'dirt', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'chopping', 'up', 'rose', 'garden', 'hitting', 'daughter', 'wire', 'hangers', 'Dutch', 'Boy', 'cleanser', 'trying', 'strangle', 'daughter', 'death', 'Dunaway', 'comic', 'tee', 'snarls', 'swears', 'howls', 'screams', 'rabid', 'wolf', 'crossed', 'teamster', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'respectively', 'child', 'adult', 'versions', 'Crawford', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'circumstances', 'give', 'very', 'good', 'performances', ""'re"", 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'unintentionally', 'hilariously', 'know', 'nothing', 'funny', 'child', 'abuse', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'story', 'true', 'great', 'sympathy', 'years', 'trauma', 'endured', 'However', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'so', 'campy', 'so', 'overdone', 'so', 'cartoonish', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'endure', 'not', 'taking', 'seriously', 'DO', ""N'T"", '@', '%', 'WITH', 'ME', 'FELLAS']",N/A

209674,A1D9YFYYY3AZVY,6300213919,Miranda,"[1, 2]","This movie is sometimes rather dismissively referred to as &#34;campy&#34;, but I beg to differ.  It was ground-breaking for its time in terms of its depiction of child abuse, which at the time was still shrouded in secrecy and denial.  Faye  Dunaway is a stunning likeness for Joan Crawford in looks, mannerisms and voice.  It is possible to watch this portrayal and still have some sympathy for the real Joan Crawford, who was faced with sexism and looks-ism in a career which lasted considerably longer than any other major star from that era.  Some portions of the movie do seem a bit over the top, such as the famed &#34;no more wire hangers!&#34; confrontation where Joan Crawford is depicted as a ghoulish looking, face-mask-wearing virago on a rampage.  These over the top moments, however, are more a result of the director's decisions than any flaw in Ms. Dunaway's performance.  Both Diana Scarwid, as the adult Christina Crawford, and the child actress who plays the child Christina Crawford are excellent.  As a bonus, the production hearkens back to the glamor of Old Holywood, and the movie sets are truly beautiful.  And, oh by the way, I do believe Christina Crawford was an abused child- people who knew Joan, including Helen Hayes, confirmed that Joan was cruel to her children.",4,brilliant performance from Faye Dunaway,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,1297,"['movie', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'dismissively', 'referred', '34', 'campy', '34', 'beg', 'differ', 'was', 'ground-breaking', 'time', 'terms', 'depiction', 'child', 'abuse', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'shrouded', 'secrecy', 'denial', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'stunning', 'likeness', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'possible', 'watch', 'portrayal', 'still', 'have', 'sympathy', 'real', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'who', 'was', 'faced', 'sexism', 'looks-ism', 'career', 'lasted', 'considerably', 'longer', 'other', 'major', 'star', 'era', 'portions', 'movie', 'do', 'seem', 'bit', 'top', 'such', 'famed', '34', 'more', 'wire', 'hangers', '34', 'confrontation', 'where', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'depicted', 'ghoulish', 'looking', 'face-mask-wearing', 'virago', 'rampage', 'top', 'moments', 'however', 'are', 'more', 'result', 'director', 'decisions', 'flaw', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'adult', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'child', 'actress', 'who', 'child', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'are', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'production', 'back', 'glamor', 'Old', 'Holywood', 'movie', 'sets', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'oh', 'way', 'do', 'believe', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'was', 'abused', 'child-', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Joan', 'including', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'confirmed', 'Joan', 'was', 'cruel', 'children']",N/A

Keogh,"[10, 22]","I have to say that I'm baffled by the people who actually take this movie seriously and are seemingly offended by those of us who feel it has well-deserved its claim to the title- campiest movie of all time!How bad is this movie?  Well, its star, Faye Dunaway, blames it for destroying her career as an A-list actress and she's probably is correct in that assessment.  Before ""Mommie Dearest"", she was the star of ""Bonnie and Clyde,""  ""Chinatown,"" and ""Network""-  each a bona fide classic of America cinema.  Yet post-""Mommie Dearest,"" her career was reduced to such dreck as ""Supergirl"", ""Dunston Checks In"" and a failed reality TV series.  I think another reviewer summed it up perfectly- it's very bad for an actor's career when audiences laugh at an actor's performance, and rest assured people have been laughing at Ms. Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford for decades.Everyone has a favorite moment from ""Mommie Dearest""- my favorite is when bratty Diana Scarwid's ""Christina"" returns home after getting kicked out of private school because she knew where the find to ""the booze. And the boys!""  Faye's ""Joan"" is being interviewed by a reporter, and Christina humiliates her with ""That is a LIE!""  And that leads to: ""Why can't you show me the respect that I can get from any stranger on the street!?!?""  because, as we all know, Christina is ""not one of your FAAAAAANS!!!""  Now, the look that comes over Faye's face- maniacal, cross-eyed, and tight-lipped- just before she puts her hands around Scarwid's neck never fails to make me laugh!  It's just so over the top!Why one star?  As a camp classic ""Mommie Dearest"" is a five star film.  However, ""Mommie Dearest"" was not made to be a camp classic.  Further, it was not made to destroy the career of Faye Dunaway or derail Diana Scarwid's career just when it was getting off the ground (she's actually pretty talented).  Also, its dramatic scenes were not supposed to make people laugh out loud.  Since, the movie failed so miserably at what it set out to be then I have to give it just one star.

This was clearly meant to be a serious drama, but the underline hysteria and shrill dialogue made for silliness and humor.  ""Wire hangers"" and ""Bring me the axe!"" became instant catch phrases, and even all these years later we still laugh at it.  But, it's really not so funny.Christina Crawford tells her tale of being adopted by none other than movie icon Joan Crawford as an infant.  While she was given a chance at a better life, she was forced to endure the brunt of Joan's violent mood swings, alcoholism, and struggles.  Unable to have her own children, Joan adopted her children not because she really wanted to give back, but as a publicity stunt.  I believe Christina, as many have accused her of lies.  Having several friends whose alcoholism and drug abuse have distroyed their families and severed ties with friends, I have seen it first hand.  I have seen the terrible temper tantrums, the irrational behavior, and physical distruction on material things as well as the bruised faces of spouses and children.  They know full well what they are doing, and maybe they are truly sorry for what they have done, but they are too self centered (like Joan) to change their behavior.  A child has no choice but to absorb it, as they are dependent upon their abusive parent and can't escape.  We have a tendancy to think that this happens only to poor, uneducated, urban or rural people, but it's going on right next door to you in suburbia and even on Millionaire's Row.  It makes you wonder what goes on behind closed doors and how well you really know others.  Who would have ever suspected that a glamourous movie star or those who live in wealth and privilage would also be so dysfunctional?Some things were hyped up and exagerated, to be sure.  Had this movie actually been taken as a serious documentary, it would not have flown too well.  Faye Dunaway was so over the top she came off more as a ham and less as an actress to me.

I had heard stories of Joan Crawford and the way she treated her children, but I never dreamed that she was anything like the way she was portrayed in this movie!Faye Dunaway gives a very haunting performance as the legendary Joan Crawford almost flawlessly. Sometimes you could look at her and notice the truly uncanny resemblance between the two women.What was scariest was Joan Crawford's treatment of her children. I truly felt sorry for them and actually saw Joan Crawford as a calculating and manipulative woman who wanted perfect order no matter what cost. Faye Dunaway screaming, &quot;NO MORE WIRE HANGERS!&quot; while on a tirade through Christina's and Christopher's room is an image that will forever be seared into my mind.I even had the opportunity to read Christina Crawford's book, &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; and it's scarier than the movie.

It is one of the campiest movies ever made (although completely unintentional considering it was suppose to be a serious portrayal of child abuse, ha!).  Faye goes over the top as Joan Crawford in an unforgettable performance.  I'm just gonna make a few comments about other reviews on this site for this movie. Faye's acting was not cheesy, it was over the top. That is a big difference.  Also, for anyone out there that really was abused as a child, well this is not the movie for you. Although, my childhood was not all daisies and lolly pops, and I still find this movie hilarious.  I don't believe that Joan Crawford should get reamed for being a strict parent (yes, some things went too far, but how do we know this actually happened?).  Christina is just trying to cash in because Joan didn't leave her a cent in her will.  Christina coulda been a spoiled little brat who deserved to get beat down, we'll never know. But, one reviewer here had it right, in the 1940's and '50s..PARENTS WERE RUTHLESS when it came to discipline.  I hear stories from that generation that would rival this movie. Also, Joan had a horrible childhood too, some even say that her obession with having no wire hangers in the house is because when she was a young child, her and her single mother lived in the back of a laundry and Joan's job was to hang all the clothes on wire hangers. In the end, it's great entertainment that contains some of the best lines in cinema history (""No Wire Hangers!"", ""Tina, Bring me the Axe!"").

The special features include a commentary from John Waters which is mildly entertaing but could have been richer and much better had he researched actual facts about the film. Instead, he simply muses on the costumes, actors, set decorations, etc. Not bad, but could have been better!Three featurettes (all slightly under 15 minutes) are also included. These could have been combined into one long feature since the participants are practically the same in each. In the first ""A Revival of Joan,"" Frank Yablans discusses how he came on board and his personal vision for the film. He talks about how director Frank Perry was hired as well as the casting for the film. Diana Scarwid (older Christina) and Rutanya Alda (Carol Ann) are also on hand. ""Life with Joan,"" the second featurette features the same participants. Yablans talks about an original opening sequence with Joan on the set of ""Ice Folies of 1939"" in which she cuts her foot but insists on going on with the scene. Rutanya and Scarwid recall working with Faye Dunaway. Rutanya offers some interesting comments about her character - ""Carol Ann"" was actually a combination of three different servants who worked for Joan Crawford during her lifetime. Yablans also discusses the most infamous scenes like the ""no wire hangers"" scene. Director Frank Perry actually cut down the lemon tree as it proved too strenuous a job for Dunaway!Featurette 3 is ""Joan Lives On,"" again with the same interviewees with the exception of female impersonator Lypsinka. They show him in the make-up chair getting made up as Joan and then he shares his thoughts about the film in make-up. Yablans, Scarwid and Alda talk about the films premiere, the reponse from the public, the gay fan base, the publicity campaign and speculates as to why Faye Dunaway has denounced the film.One odd note about all three of these features is that the only footage they show of Joan Crawford is from ""Johnny Guitar.""

Joan Crawford was one of Hollywood's foremost actresses from the 1920s onto the late 50s. Besides her reputation as both a long-lived and brilliant artist, Joan Crawford was also known as a great philanthropist, as well as a charitable,kind-hearted mother to her four adopted children.Yet not long after Crawford's death (1977), along with the deaths of the vast majority of her closest friends and colleagues came the intensely pejorative book and movie, both of which were titled,""Mommie Dearest."" Characterized as an egocentric, abusive, and often bellicose woman, Joan Crawford's good name was forever tarnished by the disparaging words of her eldest adopted daughter, Christina Crawford. Ironically enough, the book was written shortly after Christina learned that she was forever cut out of her mother's will. While praised/pitied by many (including her brother Christopher), Christina Crawford's sordid account of her life as the daughter of a Hollywood icon was publicly denounced by her two younger sisters...only bringing more confusion into the mix.However, despite the severity of the abuse mentioned in the book, ""Mommie Dearest"" the movie (the movie was made in 1981) falls a bit short in its dramatic, as well as its chronological qualities. For example, Christina's brother Christopher is rarely ever shown, Christina's age is inaccurate during several major scenes, and the movie makes it seem like her two younger sisters never even existed. In the film, it's quite obvious that actress Faye Dunaway really tries to offer a strong performance as the overbearing and emotionally disturbed (mother/actress) Joan Crawford. Yet the majority of her acting, as well as the film itself are over-the-top, which unfortunately spoils what should've been a very serious and poignant film.But on the other hand, in its own way this film is still a must-see. Better characterized as the kind of movie you love to hate, ""Mommie Dearest"" delivers chills as well as giggles with its classic, humorous moments like the ""No Wire Hangers"" scene, along with the overly violent destruction of Joan Crawford's rose garden in the ""Box Office Poison"" scene. Whether you like it or not, ""Mommie Dearest"" is a very interesting film.

The rest of us see 'Mommie Dearest', the adaptation from the life story of the daughter of a Hollywood Legend, for what it is - a hilarious mistake. Intended, I am certain, as a harrowing and insightful portrait into the stark effects of alcoholism and child abuse, 'Mommie Dearest' instead manages to keep us rolling in the aisles for almost all of its 2+ hours, thanks in no small part to atrocious acting, lousy writing and some of the most irresponsible fact-interference I've ever seen.The movie opens with Joan Crawford (played really rather well by Faye Dunaway, but since the rest of the picture is so bad, we tend not to notice this) desperate to have a child. Enter the hapless Christina (who was initally named after Joan herself, and later re-named, a fact casually omitted by the scriptwriters) and her appalling collection of platinum-blonde fright-wigs. The professional and personal decline of Ms. Crawford's MGM career begins shortly afterwards, and she sublimates her rage through heavy drinking, heavy-handed discipline and even heavier eyebrows.For a movie based on the personal memoirs of Christina Crawford, it's still a mystery why the screenplay gives her such a small role in the film. This really could have been re-named 'All About  Joan', with more than its fair share of clearly-imagined Christina-free episodes - the Pepsi-Cola board room, Joan's meetings with LB Meyer, and a host of pre-Christina exchanges between Joan and various adoption/childcare employees - leading us to believe that the facts from the original book have been severely dressed up by a number of hackneyed Hollywood writers' cliches. For an autobiographical adaptation, the amount of key scenes that occur without Christina seems unlikely. This is 'Mommie Dearest's first failing as a serious movie, in that it disregards the main character, instead latching onto an over-bearing and flashy secondary character (Joan) for thrills.The second major flaw with this picture is the truly dire quality of acting, displayed by almost all the performers. Dunaway as Crawford is good, for the most part, and Harry Goz's tiny cameo as Alfred Steele, the Pepsi magnate, is well-acted, but the rest of the cast seem, by turns, extraordinarily wooden and overpoweringly camp. Take the actresses playing the part of Christina - Mara Hobel as young Tina is grating and hammy, while Diana Scarwid as Tina the Older is monotonous and frigid. Indeed, so emotionless is Scarwid's performance as the victim of such a dreadful torrent of abuse, that we begin to wonder if the allegations of drug and alcohol abuse extend beyond Crawford to her young daughter. Was Tina high, too? In contrast to this, Scarwid's performances in the more emotional scenes ('I'm-not-one-of-your-FANS', 'Does she? Does she?') seem implausible to the point of ridicule. Similarly horrible performances come in the shape of the sublimely confused Rutanya Alda as Joan's long-suffering maid Carol-Anne, and the absolutely dreadful Steve Forrest as Greg Savitt, a man whose face, much like his acting ability, seems to be composed entirely of wood, and only one emotion.However, it's the contrast between different poles of emotion, so very badly acted, that gives this movie its unintentional success - 'Mommie Dearest' is the original 'So Bad It's Good' picture. The by-now infamous Wire Hanger and Ax sequences take on a ghoulish and comedic twist, with Dunaway chewing up and spitting out every available ounce of scenery, while vole-faced Hobel looks on, inappropriately muttering 'Jesus Christ' at the tender age of eight years old. The fight scene when Joan removes the adult Christina from school is a movie classic; so badly acted, and so poorly scripted, that we end up cheering Joan on, truly hoping that she does indeed strangle the hapless, hopeless Scarwid.All in all, 'Mommie Dearest' is an artistic failure but a comedy triumph. Die-hard Joan fanatics will feel somewhat vindicated, too, by the terrible embellishment of real-life events. The whole plotline smacks of personal vendetta - and, having read the actual book, I can see why... it's full of the 'Poor Me' syndrome - and it fails to pack a dramatic punch of any sort. It's a glamorous, glorious trip down Hammy Lane, and one for anyone who enjoys a good belly-laugh.Except that's not what poor Christina had intended.

209707,AED6KI8T2OEZU,6300213919,rickshayne,"[6, 10]","Unfortunately (for them), some people watch this movie and think it is a biography.LOL!!On the serious side, the movie begins when Joan Crawford's MGM career is nearing the end... and just before she starts her morning routine. :)What you don't get to see it what life was for her before being a movie star, before being a dancer, before being a student who had to work in the school's kitchen to pay for her tuition while the others had fun, and before she was left father-less (not that her mother was a good presence). She was dirt-poor.If you are offended by what you see in this movie (the side that was supposed to be serious- child abuse) then you owe it to yourself to at least learn about the other side of the story. I recommend reading the JC bio book ""The Last Word"", and then you'll see Joan in a different light.Not that it couldn't be in this movie because cc was not around to recall it mind you, because apparently she can remember whole conversations that took place when she was 2 years old...Joan Crawford had to work hard all of her life, ever since she was a child and basically alone. She had to work her a** off to get to where she was and no spoiled children (who may or may not have been affected by that syndrome that adopted children have) was gonna ruin that for her. Nor would she have let it ruin their own lives. Joan was going to raise her children as respectable community people, which she looked up to. So blame society then. Unfortunately this is the only movie/book that showcases parenting without a pink light on, so infamous that no-one, unless researched, will know that back in those days parents were very very strict, they would make JC's portrayal (sans-midnight scrubs) pale.The bed straps were common use and a girl who displayed sign of rebellion was soon put in her place.If you really want to put what serious there could be in cc's book in context, then make some research in the life of the 40s/50s and parenting. Then come back to me and tell me how out of this world this kind of parenting was.To answer some reviewers' post, yes Christina recovered well, in fact she's constantly touring to sell her fiction-novels with drag queens made up like Faye Dunaway which any abused child would never dream of doing, simply for the horror that would be brought back, but hey, anything to sell and make money.The only way you can watch this movie, is for laughs. Period.It's the ultimate camp cult classic that John Waters probably wished he had done.Addendum (08.06.05):It is still incredible as it was the day this was released, how people like this reviewer R.Johnson takes this as reality show.""They should make this into a miniseries to portray Joan faithfully""?

First, I received the scathing, tell-all by daughter Christina Crawford for Christmas that year, and it made for one fascinating read! Then, in 1981, I saw Mommie Dearest on the big screen. Well, of course, they'd changed some things, compressed a few scenes here and there, and paid absolutely no attention to Joan's early life as a struggling actress (and part-time waitress). That's ok, though, cause what they left us with was 100% beef! Faye Dunaway is absolutely stupendous as Joan, though she's nowhere as beautiful as Joan was in her prime (which is when Mommie Dearest, the movie, begins). At times, the make-up is amazing...but there are other moments when it appears outlandish, even (dare I say) frightening. Those lips!  And especially those insane eyebrows! They look like they've been painted on with a magic marker! Be that as it may, her performance is top-notch all the way. Certainly the challenge was a daunting one--Crawford had only been dead a few years, and most modern audiences remember her from horror films, like Trog and Berserk. Dunaway captures Joan's essence just enough to suggest the real thing...and she's the only reason for seeing (and owning) Mommie Dearest. Frankly, I laughed when she started beating the ... out of that obnoxious little actress who played young Christina. The wire-hangers scene was a hoot! And Diana Scarwid, as adult Christina, is so zombie-like, you swear she's on anti-depressants (and this was before anti-depressants were all the rage). Plus, she speaks with a distinct ""twang"" to her voice--what, was Christina a Texan? When Joan freaks out and jumps on Christina, pounding her head into the carpet, I almost lost my jujubes! I can't imagine filming this scene--both actresses must have been busting a gut laughing between takes. As for Joan's near and dear secretary, I have no idea who the actress is--but she wears the most unconvincing ""old lady"" make-up I've ever seen.  All in all, I recommend Mommie Dearest, both as book and film--the the DVD print is really gorgeous. But do we really need to know that Joan was mean, that she drank, and was a floozy who bedded younger men? Heck, she was a STAR! And that's what stars do!  Would we expect any OTHER behavior? People like Joan Crawford were made for the Ages--and Christina's book only added to her mystique.  Joan, here's to you!

And, to me, I don't think she did a bad job playing the unstable film queen Joan Crawford.  In my opinion,  since Hollywood just buried one of it's notorious film icons, not 3-4 years after her death, the wounds were still fresh.  Not to mention Hollywood had a lot of respect for Faye until she took this role.  It was a gamble, a gamble she took and now she has to live with it.  She made (also whoever her agent was then) made the choice to take a role that could continue making her larger than life or ruin it entirely.  I think Hollywood and Faye needs to forgive and forget how this movie ruined certain people's careers and recognize it brought a new lineage of fans to watching Joan Crawford movies & classic movies in general (I being one of them).  True, was this movie over-the-top and overacted: ABSOLUTELY!  But it doesn't mean it's not a deliciously good movie at the end of it all.Now to the serious side of this movie.  Child abuse is a serious issue, but I whether keep things in the context of its time.  Back in those days if a child got fresh with their parents (stable/unstable)--with body language even--they would be reprimanded severely!  I do commend Christina for bringing the issue of child abuse to its attention especially from a social economic standpoint as many are mislead that only people in the ghettos or low-income environments condone physical punishment upon their kids.  However how long is she going to continue to destroy her mother's image?  To me, I feel if you done a book and made a movie that should be enough.  Not to mention if you hate this woman as much as you say -- Why continue to carry her last name?  Why keep talking about her in film bios?  Why try and release a rumored nude video tape on her if you don't want to keep her relevant?  I know if I had it as bad as Christina did the Joan Crawford name and brand would be an afterthought soon as she was cut me off from the will!  All what I'm saying is though I do believe abuse happened with Christina and Christopher, on the other hand, Christina has made a lot of money off the ""Joan Crawford"" name after being cut from the will.Nevertheless I found the movie to be enjoyable.  I know it pissed off many people then and still does now.  We as true entertainment fans will never know the truth since Joan has been gone for 35 years now.

209715,A3AF82E6Y0J0SJ,6300213919,Ryle Shermatz,"[4, 4]","With so many other reviews, what can someone add to ""Mommie Dearest""?  I want to toss my own five stars into the average and offer what I can to persuade interested but uncommitted DVD viewers to take the plunge and experience this AMAZING movie and performance by Faye.Let me volunteer that Joan's ""parenting"" as depicted here rings absolutely true to this viewer.  I was born in 1957 and our dad was fully and unwittingly invested in the ""Mommie Dearest"" method.  So many of the berserk rages depicted in the movie were played out in our home and echoed throughout our neighborhood and indeed, the nation at large, I'm afraid. Maybe we didn't get smacked with wire hangers or flogged & dusted with cans of Comet cleanser, but I promise you, we got it as badly if not worse. We forget today how common abusive households were; no one was ever happy to see a violent domestic ""scene"" in the neighborhood, but no one would intervene to make it stop either.Like our dad, I believe Joan DID want children, and not just to aggrandize themselves.  Unfortunately when it comes to children, theory and vague impulses quickly get buzzsawed by the realities of coping with the dependent and imperfectly developing new human being that is a child.  As ""Mommie Dearest"" painfully reminds us--just WANTING a baby and family is no assurance that you're up to the task.  Oh sure, no one's perfect, and children will challenge you and test you in every way imaginable, but no provocation justifies the insane domestic brutality depicted here--again, TOTALLY credible to me.As John Waters correctly observes in his commentary track, for better or worse, Faye will most likely be remembered with ""MD"" as her ""signature"" role; NOTHING else she ever did in her long career created such a seismic ripple in popular culture! However, Faye should be PROUD of her work here!  We feel Joan's insecurity as she struggles to stay viable as a past-her-prime Hollywood Diva; we see the grit and fire that kept her in the game for so long, as well as how that same vicious intensity and overwhelming vanity made her a bad, BAD parent.  We see how she boils over and lashes out--INSANELY--""Mommie Dearest"" is flat off her rocker!  but we also see that she DID have affection for Christina--even though she was just too high-strung and selfish to ever be a fit parent.  SO MANY difficult and piercing psychological elements are skillfully juggled in Faye's performance!  The queasiness of the story just made it a hard, HARD sell to recognize on its own abundant merits.  Acclaim for Faye in ""Mommie Dearest"" would have been like giving Ralph Fiennes the best actor Oscar for his role as the Nazi camp commandant in ""Schindler's List""!  NOT going to happen!Despite the deserved shellacking Joan's reputation takes here (and she DEFINITELY earned the takedown), I still admire her.  She was a UNIQUE and one-of-a-kind presence in American cinema and culture.  Many of her movies--and her steely charisma--remain powerful, potent, indeed, ICONIC representations of their times.  Joan, I think, mirrored many women's frustrations and sufferings but Joan (unlike most ""surrendered bride"" housewives of the day) had the fire and ammo to shoot back, and still look glamorous while delivering the smackdown.  Oh boy, though--Joan's peculiar ""look"" is wildly unsettling! Those blazing welding-torch eyes and that sharp hatchet face; here's one lady you don't want to ""fork"" with, right?  Faye Dunaway, to me anyway, is SEVERAL degrees of magnitude more beautiful than Joan was, however Faye certainly channels Joan's scalding intensity (and ""look"") VERY successfully.  Hard to imagine anyone else in the part--though (as the EXCELLENT featurettes on this DVD reveal) ANN BANCROFT was the actress originally envisioned for the part.  Ann would have been good--she bore a stronger physical resemblance to Joan--but that's just another intriguing historical ""what if"" footnote, like Jimmy Stewart in ""North by Northwest"" or Ronald Reagan in ""Casablanca"".What we do have instead, is Faye in ""Mommie Dearest""--and what a towering, wrecking ball of a pop-culture artifact it is indeed!  I STRONGLY recommend this movie, but let me say that the experience is greatly enhanced if you've imbibed a little bit of Joan as well.Mildred Pierce (Keepcase)--Joan's Oscar winning part as a ""helicopter parent"" circa 1947 has special resonance here, AND the RIVETING documentary on Joan's life and career on the flip side of the disc provides HUGE insight and back-story.  I would also unconditionally recommendHumoresquewhich, like ""Mildred"" is a jet-black noirish melodrama, likewise generously laced with Joan's unique mint-and cyanide presence.However--you don't HAVE to know Joan Crawford or her work to appreciate ""Mommie Dearest"".  It's a tough, unflinching look at a genuine ""tough cookie"" in Joan, as depicted ASTONISHINGLY here by Faye Dunaway.  This is DEFINITELY not a movie for everyone. But for those of us who understand its historical context and appreciate fearless, high-wire acting as Faye delivers, we have a ferocious portrait of a woman crushed in an avalanche of Dionysian fate.  Today we have a whole vocabulary of clinical euphemisms for her furies; ""bipolar"", ""OCD"", etc.  But Joan's unique story--and Faye's daring performance--remind us and oblige us to confront how these afflictions wound and poison our own lives and times.  If you think you're up for it--""Mommie Dearest"" is not to be missed!",5,Joan Crawford: Eyes Like Welding Torches,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,5468,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'what', 'can',

209717,A2SX6VNPSJPGP7,6300213919,Sean Orlosky,"[0, 0]","&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; is a genuine stunner. I was overwhelmed by the film on first viewing. This dramatic, intensely horrifying biographical portrait of Joan Crawford's maternity is enough to make even the most die-hard Crawford fan cringe.Faye Dunaway (frankly what I believe to have been a performance of Oscar caliber) portrays Crawford. Dunaway has Crawford down to the last inch. In mannerisms, looks, even voice, she IS Joan Crawford. Dunaway's performance lends a very creepy sense of voyeurism to the film because the viewer actually forgets that this is a performance.At any rate, the story begins circa 1939, when Crawford was one of Hollywood's reigning glamour queens. She adopts two babies as a single mother. Flash forward five years. Crawford is sweet to her daughter Christina in front of the cameras. When the bulbs aren't flashing, Crawford is cruel to her daughter (Mara Hobel; I don't know how she endured making this film)... forcing her to give up birthday gifts &quot;...for the less fortunate children...&quot;, locking her daughter in a poolhouse for backtalking, and chopping off Christina's hair in one particularly gruesome scene when the girl is caught staring at herself in a mirror. Other cruelties include forcing the child to eat raw meat and sending the girl to boarding school for mixing a drink for one of Crwaford's boyfriends. In later years, Crawford actually wrestles her daughter to the floor and chokes her mercilessly.It is heartbreaking because in every instance Christina is trying to be a good girl for &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;. Crawford's outlandish behavior manages to scare the blazes out of her children. Just after winning the Oscar, Crawford beats the devil out of Christina when she discovers wire hangers in the girl's closet (a symbol of poverty).They are bizarre and never completely understandable, these turns of events. An older Christina (Diana Scarwid, just great) still finds it hard to come to terms with her mother's erratic behavior after death, when her mother left a cruel statement in her will excluding her children as beneficiaries. This is a story that needs to be told, but it is still nerve-wracking when told. I'm proud of Christina Crawford for having the courage to tell this story. I hope it may even help some people who have suffered this kind of abuse.",5,Shocking and heartbreaking,972691200,"10 28, 2000",2000,2339,"['quot', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'quot', 'genuine', 'stunner', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'dramatic', 'intensely', 'horrifying', 'biographical', 'portrait', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'maternity', 'enough', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'die-hard', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'cringe.Faye', 'Dunaway', 'frankly', 'what', 'believe', 'have', 'been', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'Crawford', 'Dunaway', 'Crawford', 'down', 'last', 'inch', 'mannerisms', 'even', 'voice', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'very', 'creepy', 'sense', 'voyeurism', 'film', 'viewer', 'actually', 'performance.At', 'rate', 'story', 'circa', '1939', 'when', 'Crawford', 'was', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'reigning', 'glamour', 'queens', 'two', 'babies', 'single', 'mother', 'Flash', 'forward', 'five', 'years', 'Crawford', 'sweet', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'front', 'cameras', 'When', 'bulbs', 'are', ""n't"", 'flashing', 'Crawford', 'cruel', 'daughter', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'endured', 'making', 'film', 'forcing', 'give', 'up', 'birthday', 'gifts', 'quot', 'less', 'fortunate', 'children', 'quot', 'locking', 'daughter', 'poolhouse', 'backtalking', 'chopping', 'off', 'Christina', 'hair', 'one', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'when', 'girl', 'caught', 'staring', 'mirror', 'Other', 'cruelties', 'include', 'forcing', 'child', 'eat', 'raw', 'meat', 'sending', 'girl', 'boarding', 'school', 'mixing', 'drink', 'one', 'Crwaford', 'boyfriends', 'later', 'years', 'Crawford', 'actually', 'daughter', 'floor', 'mercilessly.It', 'heartbreaking', 'instance', 'Christina', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'girl', 'quot', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'quot', 'Crawford', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'manages', 'scare', 'blazes', 'children', 'Just', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Crawford', 'devil', 'Christina', 'when', 'wire', 'hangers', 'girl', 'closet', 'symbol', 'poverty', '.They', 'are', 'bizarre', 'never', 'completely', 'understandable', 'turns', 'events', 'older', 'Christina', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'just', 'great', 'still', 'hard', 'come', 'terms', 'mother', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'death', 'when', 'mother', 'left', 'cruel', 'statement', 'will', 'excluding', 'children', 'beneficiaries', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'still', 'nerve-wracking', 'when', 'told', ""'m"", 'proud', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'having', 'courage', 'tell', 'story', 'hope', 'may', 'even', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'kind', 'abuse']",N/A

209722,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6300213919,Silver Screen,"[4, 6]","""Mommie Dearest"" the movie was certainly made to be a serious, thought provoking film (any doubts, check interviews with Christina Crawford made before the film was released).  While the idea may have been to bring child abuse to the forefront (this was 1981), the result was a camp classic that failed horribly.  It is said this movie ruined Faye Dunaway's A-list career and if you watch this film, you will understand why.Never, in her entire movie career, did Joan Crawford herself overact so histrionically.  Where was the director on this film when Ms. Dunaway was chewing the hell out of the scenery?  Did she think that widening her already huge, excessively lined eyes and snarling her far too made up lips was an accurate portrayal of Ms. Crawford?Almost as bad are the two actresses playing Christina.  Mara Hobel played Christina as a child and is passable for most of her scenes, although the scene where she is forced to clean the bathroom and gives her Tara speech of ""I'll never go hungry again"" is way too much for a child.  Diana Scarwid, who has turned in good performances since this bomb of a film, surprisingly enough, is, shall we say, horrible.  It's the inconsistencies that do her in.  She overacts in some scenes, is dull in others to the point of wondering if anyone has checked her pulse lately.  Additionally, I found her constantly changing accent unnerving.  In one scene, although the real Christina was born and raised in California, Ms. Scarwid's distinct Southern twang comes out.  Where was the director?  Where were the editors?The film certainly succeeds in being campy and funny, and there are a few memorable lines in the film (""Don't f*** with me, fellas!"") but don't watch this one thinking it's going to be a serious, thinking film.  Also remember that although it's about Joan Crawford, it doesn't say much about the lady, other than Christina's take on the events of her childhood.  If you want to see Faye Dunaway chopping down a tree in the backyard in a drunken haze, or wandering the halls of her house, slathered in face cream and looking for wire hangers, this is your film.The film also completely neglects Ms. Crawford's youngest daughters -- they are never seen nor mentioned.And while the movie ends with Ms. Crawford's death, and Christina being informed that she has been cut out of the will ""for reasons which are well known to her"", it doesn't show Christina working on her tell-all in order to gain that inheritance one way or the other.As a final note, sadly and ironically enough, Ms. Dunaway was one actress that Ms. Crawford mentioned in an interview as having a good future ahead of her, and with real talent.  Little did she know that some years down the road, Ms. Dunaway would turn in a much ridiculed performance as the great actress herself.",2,Good for Camp,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,2811,"['Mommie', 'Dearest', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'made', 'be', 'serious', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'doubts', 'check', 'interviews', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'idea', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bring', 'child', 'abuse', 'forefront', 'was', '1981', 'result', 'was', 'camp', 'classic', 'failed', 'horribly', 'said', 'movie', 'ruined', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'A-list', 'career', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'understand', 'why.Never', 'entire', 'movie', 'career', 'did', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'overact', 'so', 'histrionically', 'Where', 'was', 'director', 'film', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'was', 'chewing', 'hell', 'scenery', 'Did', 'think', 'widening', 'already', 'huge', 'excessively', 'lined', 'eyes', 'snarling', 'far', 'too', 'made', 'up', 'lips', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'Almost', 'bad', 'are', 'two', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Christina', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'played', 'Christina', 'child', 'passable', 'most', 'scenes', 'scene', 'where', 'forced', 'clean', 'bathroom', 'Tara', 'speech', ""'ll"", 'never', 'go', 'hungry', 'again', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'child', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'who', 'turned', 'good', 'performances', 'bomb', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'shall', 'say', 'horrible', 'inconsistencies', 'do', 'scenes', 'dull', 'others', 'point', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'checked', 'pulse', 'lately', 'Additionally', 'found', 'constantly', 'changing', 'accent', 'unnerving', 'one', 'scene', 'real', 'Christina', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'California', 'Ms.', 'Scarwid', 'distinct', 'Southern', 'twang', 'out', 'Where', 'was', 'director', 'Where', 'were', 'editors', 'film', 'certainly', 'being', 'campy', 'funny', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'lines', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'f***', 'fellas', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'serious', 'thinking', 'film', 'Also', 'remember', 'Joan', 'Crawford', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'lady', 'other', 'Christina', 'take', 'events', 'childhood', 'want', 'see', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'chopping', 'down', 'tree', 'backyard', 'drunken', 'haze', 'wandering', 'halls', 'house', 'slathered', 'face', 'cream', 'looking', 'wire', 'hangers', 'film.The', 'film', 'also', 'completely', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'youngest', 'daughters', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'mentioned.And', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'death', 'Christina', 'being', 'informed', 'been', 'cut', 'will', 'reasons', 'are', 'well', 'known', ""n't"", 'show', 'Christina', 'working', 'tell-all', 'order', 'gain', 'inheritance', 'one', 'way', 'other.As', 'final', 'note', 'sadly', 'ironically', 'enough', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'was', 'one', 'actress', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'mentioned', 'interview', 'having', 'good', 'future', 'ahead', 'real', 'talent', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'years', 'down', 'road', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'would', 'turn', 'much', 'ridiculed', 'performance', 'great', 'actress']",N/A
209723,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300213919,Simon Davis,"[7, 7]","While I have an absolute horror of any kind of child abuse I find that the film version of Christina Crawford's notorious book on growing up in the far from happy household of movie legend Joan Crawford is fascinating and indeed quite addictive viewing. Long adored by the ""camp"", film going community, ""Mommie Dearest"", is undoubtedly remembered for all the wrong reasons and I feel a viewing of it is like watching a multi car pile up in slow motion; you can't stand  to see what's about to happen but you can't take your eyes off it. Being a devoted fan of Joan Crawford and her incredible Hollywood career spanning almost five decades I'm of course horrified at the way both the book and film tore her reputation to shreds. In order to be able to enjoy Faye Dunaway's wild performance as Joan Crawford whether it be total fiction or very close to the truth, I tend to separate this film from the real life movie legend and just go with all the over the top fun that makes ""Mommie Dearest"", such entertaining viewing. Faye Dunaway I believe is incredible in the title role despite it being far removed from how the character was originally planned to be depicted during the film's planning stage. The film certainly has a lavish look to it as befitting a major Paramount production and is filled with first rate period recreation, sensational costumes, and sets. On the camp side of things however it is a film littered with outrageous lines, bizzare laugh out loud dramatics, and two very scary abuse scenes that still send shivers up my spine. ""Mommie Dearest"", makes totally eye opening viewing of the first order and whether or not it accurately depicts the Hollywood Diva in a truthful light, it is essential viewing for any fans of old Hollywood and movie stars in general.Is this story fact or fiction? I guess the majority of us will never really know. Considering the very divided opinions even from close contemporaries of Crawford's I have to assume ""Mommie Dearest"", holds some truths, however over the top they are depicted here, and also contains much that is fiction. The film certainly has remained in the public eye all these years since its release in 1981 because of its outrageous excesses and especially because of the white hot manic performance from Faye Dunaway in the lead role of Joan Crawford. Personally I couldn't imagine any other actress playing this part and Dunaway seems to be one of the few modern actresses that still seems to possess that old ""Movie Queen"", persona that is so apt here. In her performance she is at times savage, frightening, tragic, and yes even in a couple of short instances extremely vulnerable which makes it a riverting viewing experience. Of course the main joy of watching ""Mommie Dearest"", is in witnessing Faye Dunaway uttering some of the campiest and most unforgettably hilarious lines ever in a major motion picture. They alone deservedly earned the film an honoured place in the camp hall of fame. Who can forget Faye/Joan firing off such gems as,""If you can't do something well DON'T do it at all!"",""If you want to clean the floor you need to MOVE the tree!"",""Helga I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the dirt!"". (My favourite),""Tina! Bring me the axe"",""Damm it! I may as well have ""Property of MGM"", tattooed on my backside!""""I might have know you'd know where to find the booze AND the boys""and how could any viewer ever forget their first shocked reaction to the now infamous,""Don't f..k with me Fellas!!""Beside all this the supporting players certainly have their work cut out for them trying to get a look in. Rutanya Alda as the (fictional) loyal personal attendant Carol Ann manages in her calm way to actually make an impression against the Dunaway juggernaut and both Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid who play Christina at different ages make an interesting team in bringing this obviously very complex and troubled character to the screen. The story begins in 1939 during production of one of Joan Crawford's lesser efforts in ""Ice Follies of 1939"", and progresses right through to Joan's death in 1977. Many aspects of her life are noticeably cut out in the film version such as the fact that Joan had two younger children who she also adapted, while Crawford's exit from MGM as depicted in the film is fictional as it was Joan herself who when going through one of her famed ""reinventions"", actually pulled the plug on MGM. Production wise Paramount went all out and spared no expense in bringing ""Mommie Dearest"", to the screen. The period recreation of the eras stretching from the late 1930's right up to the mid 1970's is first rate and the sets recreating Crawford's lavish Hollywood home, the MGM studios, and 1950's New York are certainly among the film's major strong points and often stand out in stark contrast to the rather trashy proceedings on screen,. Special mention I feel also needs to be directed towards famed costume designer Irene Sharaff's magnificent clothes for the film. With a long brilliant designing career in Hollywood already behind her I believe her costumes here rival in magnificence and attention to detail her earlier stunning work on 1963's ""Cleopatra"". Considering the total destruction this film and the earlier book did to Crawford's memory, Sharaff's creations alone certainly did the real life Movie Queen Joan Crawford proud and at least helped preserve her reputation as one of Hollywood's best dressed women during its far off golden age.",4,Infamous Movie Version Of The Highly Sensational Tell-All Biography By Christina

The standard line is wrong -- this is a truly dramatic portrait of a ego-crazed woman and delicately depicts the subtle shadings of her daughter's reactions.  Of course the presentation Dunaway gives is outsized and explosive!  She's portraying an demon-possessed character -- how else would one do it?  But it's not a one-note performance and Dunaway is up to the task of embodying all of the various moods and ages of the part -- as complete a job of acting as anything by DeNiro.Perhaps Diana Scarwid doesn't come off as well, but her acting is at least competent and at best fairly good.  Mara Hobel is marvelous as the young Christina.  These two (and the script) create a solid character that is baffled, proud, crushed, hemmed-in, devoted, and vengeful.  By the time Christina confronts her mother's corpse, the scene creates pathos rather than schmaltz through of our awareness of the daughter's multiple layers of feeling.It may at first glance resemble a cheap horror movie (I'll allow that perhaps it was an unfortunate step to have Dunaway wearing beauty cream in the ""no wire-hangers!"" scene), but in fact it is a tragedy -- as the movie's creators intended.(The above evaluation has been about the movie and has left to one side the controversies about the story's accuracy, which come in two flavors: Crawford-wasn't-really-like-that, or the-movie-doesn't-follow-the-book.  These might be compelling issues for some people, but for me it is enough simply to enjoy a well-made, well-acted movie.)",4,"drama, not just comedy",1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,1713,"['standard', 'line', 'flick', 'unintentional', 'camp', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'acting', 'top', 'critical', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'laughable', 'standard', 'line', 'wrong', 'truly', 'dramatic', 'portrait', 'ego-crazed', 'woman', 'delicately', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'daughter', 'reactions', 'course', 'presentation', 'Dunaway', 'outsized', 'explosive', 'portraying', 'demon-possessed', 'character', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'one-note', 'performance', 'Dunaway', 'up', 'task', 'embodying', 'various', 'moods', 'ages', 'part', 'complete', 'job', 'acting', 'anything', 'DeNiro.Perhaps', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'least', 'competent', 'best', 'fairly', 'good', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'marvelous', 'young', 'Christina', 'two', 'script', 'create', 'solid', 'character', 'baffled', 'proud', 'crushed', 'hemmed-in', 'devoted', 'vengeful', 'time', 'Christina', 'mother', 'corpse', 'scene', 'rather', 'schmaltz', 'awareness', 'daughter', 'multiple', 'layers', 'feeling.It', 'may', 'first', 'glance', 'resemble', 'cheap', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'allow', 'perhaps', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'step', 'have', 'Dunaway', 'wearing', 'beauty', 'cream', 'wire-hangers', 'scene', 'fact', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'creators', 'intended', 'above', 'evaluation', 'been', 'movie', 'left', 'one', 'side', 'controversies', 'story', 'accuracy', 'come', 'two', 'flavors', ""Crawford-wasn't-really-like-that"", ""the-movie-doesn't-follow-the-book"", 'might', 'be', 'compelling', 'issues', 'people', 'enough', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'movie']",N/A

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[4, 6]","A fright-night horror movie, if there ever was one, starring Faye Dunaway in the role she was born to play - Joan Crawford. No other actress alive could have portrayed Joan with the fire and intensity that, much to Faye's chagrin, has rendered her name synonymous with the role. Spawning a zillion one-liners (""It's not you I'm mad at, Helga, it's the dirt."" ""Strap yourself in, Christopher!"" ""No wire hangers, ever!"" ""Tina! Bring me the axe!"" ""Don't f*ck with me, fellas."" And ""You're a lousy excuse for someone who *really* cares,"" among others), the film is not to be taken seriously and is definitely *not* for the faint of heart. In the celebrated ""night raid"" scene, Faye, as Joan, performs what can only be described as American Kabuki. With cold-cream obliterating her features except for the twisted mouth and incendiary eyes, Faye *becomes* the enraged Joan, practically showing us the inside of Joan's brain. The scene of the psycho-somatically bedridden Joan accepting her Oscar for her superlative work on *Mildred Pierce*, as well as the famous ""Christmas broadcast"" scene, are thrillingly realistic, as is the scene where Joan watches Christina pretending to be Joan addressing her fans. Dunaway has said that it took her a long time to shake Joan out of her system. There is no doubt of this, since Dunaway's performance is riveting, and this is her best period for movie roles. Favorite moment: (One of so *many*) A drunken Joan trying to lure her lover back to her, begging him to stay.

209737,A11BCJJG91KVOY,6300213919,"tmp ""snippy reviewer""","[32, 40]","Okay- here is one that will keep you up at night.  Faye Dunaway is deeply scary as Joan Crawford in this way-over-the-top screen adaptation of Christina Crawford's vituperative memoir.  The opening scene sets the camp-fest tone: we are treated to a loooong sequence of Miss Crawford preparing for her movie shoot, which involves her scrubbing her face, elbows, and nails with what appears to be a Brillo pad before dousing them in boiling water and iced alcohol (I defy you not to think ""morning cocktail, Joan?).  At the end of the sequence, her face is revealed to us- Faye Dunaway with big hairy commas for eyebrows.Faye's ferocious, wildly over-the-top performance seems to have been based on the conceit that Joan Crawford never had a moment off screen that she wasn't acting- except perhaps when she was being crazy and beating the kids or chopping down trees.  There are a lot of conflicting reports on the character of Miss Crawford, some painting her as an ogre, some as an angel.  Like most people, she most likely was something in between.  It looks as if Frank Perry told Faye to keep Joan's performances in ""Straight Jacket""' ""Possessed"" and ""Queen Bee"" at the front of her mind at all times, and act accordingly.  Like these movies, she is supported by sub-B movie actors (Steve Forrest?!?), who manage to look like they are in fear for their lives throughout the whole movie.  They should have been afraid for their careers.Nobody can find the abuse of a child funny, but how can you not want to smack the gooey, calculating little Mara Hobel?  The snivelling, robotic Diana Scarwid isn't much better (and her first appearance her southern accent is really jarring: ""ah unduhstaaaaand"")Plus, the movie has a wierdly underpopulated look to it.  For someone who was a star for fifty years, Joan seemed to have nobody around her (maybe it was the ax...).  She runs her house with one nanny/secretary, and one maid whom we see for one scene.  She has one boyfriend, and an ""uncle"" before marrying Al Steele- and we know that Joan was ""popular"".  At the end of her life she is shown drinking her vodka on a lone mattress on the floor of her apartment, watching Tina accept an award for her.  Except for the famous board room scene (which Faye plays like a hungry puma chained  just out of reach of the meat counter) most of her scenes have one or two people in them.  The Oscar win is really funny- she wins the Oscar when she is home ""sick"", then makes a grand speech to the throngs of photographers at the door.  Except there are maybe 10 people total.But this is all nit-picking.  This movie is great in a train-wreck kind of way.  It is so blindingly awful, yet clearly made with the intention of being an IMPORTANT MOVIE, that you can't help but giggle.  Dunaway's wild gamble of a performance neatly derailed an Oscar-winning career; nobody could look at her without seeing Faye-as-Joan (Use the words ""Mommie Dearest"" around her at your peril)  I give it 3 stars for the price of the DVD ([...] retail?  Are you high?) and as for the lack of extras, I doubt you'd get any from Paramount on a movie that the director sued them to stop the advertising campaign for.I demand a directors cut right now!",3,"Fury, thy name is Faye!",996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,3215,"['Okay-', 'here', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'up', 'night', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'deeply', 'scary', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'way-over-the-top', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Christina', 'Crawford', 'vituperative', 'memoir', 'opening', 'scene', 'camp-fest', 'tone', 'are', 'treated', 'loooong', 'sequence', 'Miss', 'Crawford', 'preparing', 'movie', 'shoot', 'scrubbing', 'face', 'nails', 'what', 'be', 'Brillo', 'pad', 'dousing', 'boiling', 'water', 'iced', 'alcohol', 'defy', 'not', 'think', 'morning', 'cocktail', 'Joan', 'end', 'sequence', 'face', 'revealed', 'us-', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'big', 'hairy', 'commas', 'eyebrows.Faye', 'ferocious', 'wildly', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'conceit', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'never', 'had', 'moment', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting-', 'perhaps', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'crazy', 'beating', 'kids', 'chopping', 'down', 'trees', 'are', 'lot', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'character', 'Miss', 'Crawford', 'painting', 'ogre', 'angel', 'most', 'people', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'something', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'told', 'Faye', 'keep', 'Joan', 'performances', 'Straight', 'Jacket', 'Possessed', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'front', 'mind', 'times', 'act', 'accordingly', 'movies', 'supported', 'sub-B', 'movie', 'actors', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'who', 'manage', 'look', 'are', 'fear', 'lives', 'whole', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'careers.Nobody', 'can', 'find', 'abuse', 'child', 'funny', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'want', 'smack', 'gooey', 'calculating', 'little', 'Mara', 'Hobel', 'snivelling', 'robotic', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'first', 'appearance', 'southern', 'accent', 'really', 'jarring', 'ah', 'unduhstaaaaand', 'movie', 'wierdly', 'underpopulated', 'look', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'star', 'fifty', 'years', 'Joan', 'seemed', 'have', 'nobody', 'maybe', 'was', 'ax', 'house', 'one', 'nanny/secretary', 'one', 'maid', 'whom', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'uncle', 'marrying', 'Al', 'Steele-', 'know', 'Joan', 'was', 'popular', 'end', 'life', 'shown', 'drinking', 'vodka', 'lone', 'mattress', 'floor', 'apartment', 'watching', 'Tina', 'award', 'famous', 'board', 'room', 'scene', 'Faye', 'hungry', 'puma', 'chained', 'just', 'reach', 'meat', 'counter', 'most', 'scenes', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'Oscar', 'win', 'really', 'funny-', 'Oscar', 'when', 'home', 'sick', 'then', 'grand', 'speech', 'throngs', 'photographers', 'door', 'are', 'maybe', '10', 'people', 'total.But', 'nit-picking', 'movie', 'great', 'train-wreck', 'kind', 'way', 'so', 'blindingly', 'awful', 'yet', 'clearly', 'made', 'intention', 'being', 'IMPORTANT', 'MOVIE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'giggle', 'Dunaway', 'wild', 'gamble', 'performance', 'neatly', 'derailed', 'Oscar-winning', 'career', 'nobody', 'could', 'look', 'seeing', 'Faye-as-Joan', 'Use', 'words', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'peril', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'price', 'DVD', '[', 'retail', 'Are', 'high', 'lack', 'extras', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'get', 'Paramount', 'movie', 'director', 'sued', 'stop', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'for.I', 'demand', 'directors', 'cut', 'right', 'now']",N/A

Faye Dunaway did a very nice job as Ms.Crawford, I assume she was a very good actress but as a mother, that's debatable. The actors all did a nice job-but the two scenes that infuriated me was the swimming lesson and the cold-heartless 'not a cent' scene towards the end. There were a few funny lines/scenes, but to me, this was almost a melodrama. Joan's mistake was perfection and she thought she could buy Tina's love and to a degree it backfired. If all this is true with the abuse, by today's standards, children's services would have a field day with her. What I find hardest to believe is that Faye's career was severely damaged because of this role, maybe she played the role a little too well, but the critics to me were way too hard on her and the movie. The abuse scenes were a little over the top, but certainly not funny, even with my twisted scense of humor.",4,there's nothing campy about child abuse,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,935,"['good', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'campy', 'funny', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'did', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'Ms.Crawford', 'assume', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'mother', 'debatable', 'actors', 'did', 'nice', 'job-but', 'two', 'scenes', 'infuriated', 'was', 'swimming', 'lesson', 'cold-heartless', 'cent', 'scene', 'end', 'were', 'few', 'funny', 'lines/scenes', 'was', 'almost', 'melodrama', 'Joan', 'mistake', 'was', 'perfection', 'thought', 'could', 'buy', 'Tina', 'love', 'degree', 'backfired', 'true', 'abuse', 'today', 'standards', 'children', 'services', 'would', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'What', 'find', 'hardest', 'believe', 'Faye', 'career', 'was', 'severely', 'damaged', 'role', 'maybe', 'played', 'role', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'critics', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'top', 'certainly', 'not', 'funny', 'even', 'twisted', 'scense', 'humor']",N/A
209739,A1WT1DO4W2UH4F,6300213919,Transatlantique,"[1, 1]","From the description, it seemed as if there would be more extras as I was led in by the customer photos depicting B/W shots of the Ice Follies of 1939.  Those were no where to be found on the DVD, so why were those photos allowed on this product's page when they weren't found with the product?  This brings to mind that there could have been more included like actual interviews with Joan, or rare footage from her career.  The extras included are interesting, but only pertain to the film, and don't include any comments from Fay Dunaway.  It is noted she won't talk about this film.The commentary from John Waters leaves something to be desired in that he rambles and often repeats his personal view of the film.  He does give some good insight in places, but sometimes comes off a bit boring and slightly catty.  I can appreciate his perspective, to a degree, but I expected more for this &#34;Hollywood Royalty&#34; edition.  It would have been nice if there had been another person with whom he was commenting, like the director or Diana Scarwid.  He says he can't imagine who else would have played Joan, but doesn't note that Ann Bancroft was considered first for the role.It would have also been nice to have seen outtakes and extra footage.  The DVD producers often give the buyer just enough to entice them to repeat buy something, but not enough to really make it worth it.  That's common with capitalism.  I would like to have paid less for this than I did.Other than that, this is one of my favourite films.  I own another version on DVD but only bought this one for the extras. The sets alone are wonderful and I had no idea it was all sound staged for interiors.  I love the 30's/40's/50's/early 60's styles, and the mark was hit by the set designers.  I've probably seen this film about 50 times, and know several of the lines.  I haven't read the book, but now might look for a used copy somewhere.  Although I believe, hearing interviews from her other adopted children not depicted in this film, this story is exaggerated.

Running a single-parent household isn't easy, and like many celebrity parents, Joan was deeply flawed on two counts in particular: 1) what was best for Joan was always priority #1 over her children's needs; and, 2) her apparent inability to control her over-the-top emotional outbursts. But are these weaknesses in character so unusual among big stars? What would an adult-aged Lourdes have to say in a written memoir about mommy Madonna, I wonder?Christina Crawford also seems to overlook the fact that Joan was facing a lot of pressure in many areas of her life, pressure that the average person couldn't possibly begin to comprehend.

Or did she really torture her children?How much of the original story do we believe?  While it is an entertaining look at a slice of Hollywood life, could it be excessive in dialogue that is more fictional than fact?While many who will never admit that dysfunctional was a part of life in the 1950s until the early 1970s, or perhaps earlier for the latter, this daughter might have had a better life besides living on any city street if life was that bad.  How much of this story is true?  Maybe all, maybe none!  Should J.C. every adopted--NO!  Should the adopted children bitch--NO!  Should one child have written a book--maybe to gain enough money to sell a book and make a movie--NO!  Hollywood will do anything to make money.Mommie Dearest's daugher--get a life!  There are many more like you still living in the concentration camp life of inhumanity as you came from that have had a worse life that you've had.  I think most of this story is fake, dressed up by Hollywood executives to make it more dramatic--especially knowing it was released several years after Joan Crawford's death.  Hollywood will do anything for a buck!The movie is entertaining; the pretense behind it is fake and only for shock value and profit.  Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for putting out garbage like this.  The star of this film deserves better.  This is crap with a capital ""S.""By the way, scenes with Joan Crawford and her hunk, but no Christine in the scene, how did she accomplish dialogue if she was not even in the room: tape recorder?  Listening at the door?  Something seriously wrong with this flick.  Another Amityville Horror--without the horror--just fake, lies, and make believe.  If they want an audience, they have to add drama even if it isn't true.Mommie Dearest protests the book and movie.  If you don't believe it--there's been some rumblings in the cemetery where she's buried.

Released to coincide with the popularity of the book of the same name, it ended up sending over-acting to a completely different level.Enter Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford, Hollywood star and an adoptive mother of four children whom she likes to abuse away from the limelight (Note: film only mentions two children). Faye Dunaway portrayed Joan in such a camp, over-the-top way that it is impossible to take her seriously!Christina Crawford (the daughter who wrote the book) rejected the film saying that they altered facts.Yet the film has become a classic. Why?  Faye Dunaway's over the top performance, and Crawford's everlasting fan base!This movie is a guilty pleasure.

The cinematography is magnificent, as well as the production design. It's really too bad that the movie is unpopular with mainstream movie audiences. However, it is noted on the DVD extra-materials to be a very popular cult following in the gay community, although I see nothing in the film that remotely ties this to being gay, perhaps one exception that in the supplemental extras there are clips from the original film ""Johnny Guitar"", so Joan looks to be a little on the ""BUTCH"" side of things. Faye Dunaway is not My favorite actress, but this movie is Hers, She owns it flat out. It has made Me wanting to take a closer look at Her other films. Diana Scarwid is amazing as Christina Crawford, not to mention the child actress that portrays Young Christina. Diana also starred in the 1983 film Psycho III, which shows She is a very versatile actress.""No more wire hangers"", just thinking about that scene brings chills down the spine. Warning, this film depicts extreme child abuse, and You will find Yourself getting very angry at the Mother, and Crying for the Daughter. I remember seeing this film with My mother when it first came out in the theaters. I couldn't help but identify with the Christina character, Yes, there are mothers just like Joan!The extra-material supplements are actually quite informative, unfortunately, Faye Dunaway is no where to be seen or heard in any of the featured interviews.
