I only wish Duncan McKay, (played by Hamish) had been more involved.  It was good to see Hector MacDonald, (played by Richard Briers) again, and it was a clever re-introduction. I only wish Alistair Mackenzie, (Archie), and Dawn Steele, (Lexie) had been available for one last hurrah, (so to speak.)  There was a bittersweet ending that will be memorable for all Monarch viewers, I wish that the ends had been tied together a little better. I guess time and finances just didn't permit.  All in all, if you've become a fan of Monarch, you won't feel right unless you pick up this last offering. It still has all of the things we've grown to love about this series, the awesome filming of the Scottish Highlands, the great characters, and the actors who portray them, and the quality we not only expect, but demand.

So while series 7 isn't the classic era of Monarch of the Glen it nevertheless has some great stories, quite a few endearing moments, and great acting. There are few missteps here, the primary one being Duncan's unbelievable return. I really enjoyed the Duncan McKay character but it seemed improbable that a gilly would take off for the big city to be a DJ, so perhaps that story line was destined to fall flat. However, most of the other story lines reach a satisfying conclusion.I'll miss the folks at Glen Bogle quite a bit (including Duncan), but it was nice to have a satisfying farewell.",5,Great Finale,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,689,"['arc', 'series', 'point', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'being', 'considered', 'apex', 'So', 'series', '7', ""n't"", 'classic', 'era', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'stories', 'quite', 'few', 'endearing', 'moments', 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'few', 'missteps', 'here', 'primary', 'one', 'being', 'Duncan', 'unbelievable', 'return', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Duncan', 'McKay', 'character', 'seemed', 'improbable', 'gilly', 'would', 'take', 'off', 'big', 'city', 'be', 'DJ', 'so', 'perhaps', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'destined', 'fall', 'flat', 'However', 'most', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'reach', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.I', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'folks', 'Glen', 'Bogle', 'quite', 'bit', 'including', 'Duncan', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'satisfying', 'farewell']",Monarch of the Glen - Series 7
1086281,A91BK8S5QH98K,B000SINSZS,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[5, 8]","In all honesty, for the first part of this series, I would give it a one star rating.  Maybe even a half-a-star if Amazon allowed for it.  As the plots are very predictable and the characters acting but not really feeling it.  I don't think the writers gave them much to feel and portray in this series.  However, that being said, the final episode redeems it all.  We are treated to the presence of Hector once again in the final episode.  And his presence is proof that the entire series would have fared much better had he stayed with the show.  He just energizes the screen in a one of a kind way.  And the wedding scene between Iona, MacGregor, and Paul has an interesting and exciting turn of events that is thrilling to the heart of any romantic female.  Truthfully, nobody ends up with who I would have picked for them.  Molly doesn't end up with Killwillie, even though he's very much in love with her and nice to her.  To me, Duncan as likeable as he is, just doesn't fit Jess somehow.  And I personally couldn't stand Ewan who is the cook.

I wish Archie and Lexie would have come back for the finale, and Duncan for more than a two word line and a second long appearance. But there is a surprise return that you would never guess in the finale  and that was fun.and a VERY surprising revelation by Golly that I never saw coming. I can never understand why great series such as Monarch of the Glen and Ballykissangel only last 6 or 7 seasons but repetitious shows like Last of the Summer Wine, etc where every episode is just like the last one, with the same antics and the same jokes and the same incidents last forever.

That would have been the right ending for me, for I always rooted for her strong presence, common sense, likeability, self-reliance, and good looks. She made a man of Archie--or in the process of doing so--when he ... left us abruptly,the magic for me was broken at that point. You couldn't keep Lexi there,vulnerable under the constant stares of Paul. And Paul was an intruder, not exactly sincere or totally likeable. The ""Monarch"" should have been Archie, married to Lexi.
