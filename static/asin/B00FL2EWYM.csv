1671915,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00FL2EWYM,Charles Ashbacher,"[2, 2]","As Nazi power rose in Germany in the late 1930's and was a clear threat to engulf the rest of Europe, Jews all across the continent made contingency plans. Some of those plans were implemented before World War II ignited and others not until the bullets and bombs were flying. In the midst of that chaos and danger, a Jewish boy was baptized in the Catholic Church in France and became known as Jean-Marie Lustiger.That boy was the child of Polish-Jewish immigrants to France that had experienced Polish anti-Semitism firsthand. While Jean-Marie's father survived the war due to machinations that are only hinted at in this film, his mother was executed at Auschwitz. That convert was extremely talented and committed to the faith; he became a priest and rose to the rank of Cardinal in the Church.This movie is about the adult life of Jean-Marie Lustiger, it begins right before he is named a Bishop. It is a great honor but it also puts him more in the public spotlight where his Jewish roots are now a matter of public and private debate. Jean-Marie's father was opposed to his conversion and serves as a reminder that he remains a Jew at his ethnic core.The greatest point of the video requires some historical background to understand how complex and significant it was. A small group of Carmelite nuns set up a convent inside the Auschwitz compound, an action that deeply offends the Jews, even though the nuns are trying to aid the poor and pray for all people. John Paul II is now Pope and he is excited about the clear degradation of Communist power in Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe.This sets the stage for an extremely emotional confrontation between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people that want Auschwitz to remain a memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust. People on the Polish side want the memory of the Polish victims to be emphasized as well, so even after 40 years the feelings are raw. It then falls to Jean-Marie to mediate and then aggressively lobby to have the nuns moved away from Auschwitz to a suitable location a short distance away.While the story is real and generally understandable, knowledge of what happened at Auschwitz, the anti-Semitism rampant in Poland in the 1930's, the role of Communism in controlling Poland after the Second World War and some background on the life of John Paul II will improve the viewers understanding of the complexity. While the location of a small convent of nuns determined to do good works may seem trivial, in this context it is not.This is a powerful film and Jean-Marie Lustiger was an extraordinary man. He was forceful, his nickname was the Bulldozer, and he was committed to the Catholic faith. Many people did unusual things in order to survive the Second World War, so the conversion of Jean-Marie should not be criticized. It is what he did as an adult that is astounding and this video demonstrates many aspects of his greatness, even when he is lecturing the increasingly frail Pope John Paul II.",5,"A powerful film about faith, commitment and roots and resolving the conflicts they can generate",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2996,"['Nazi', 'power', 'rose', 'Germany', 'late', '1930', 'was', 'clear', 'threat', 'engulf', 'rest', 'Europe', 'Jews', 'continent', 'made', 'contingency', 'plans', 'plans', 'were', 'implemented', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'ignited', 'others', 'not', 'bullets', 'bombs', 'were', 'flying', 'midst', 'chaos', 'danger', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'was', 'baptized', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'France', 'became', 'known', 'Jean-Marie', 'Lustiger.That', 'boy', 'was', 'child', 'Polish-Jewish', 'immigrants', 'France', 'had', 'experienced', 'Polish', 'anti-Semitism', 'firsthand', 'Jean-Marie', 'father', 'survived', 'war', 'due', 'machinations', 'are', 'only', 'hinted', 'film', 'mother', 'was', 'executed', 'Auschwitz', 'convert', 'was', 'extremely', 'talented', 'committed', 'faith', 'became', 'priest', 'rose', 'rank', 'Cardinal', 'Church.This', 'movie', 'adult', 'life', 'Jean-Marie', 'Lustiger', 'right', 'named', 'Bishop', 'great', 'honor', 'also', 'more', 'public', 'spotlight', 'where', 'Jewish', 'roots', 'are', 'now', 'matter', 'public', 'private', 'debate', 'Jean-Marie', 'father', 'was', 'opposed', 'conversion', 'reminder', 'Jew', 'ethnic', 'core.The', 'greatest', 'point', 'video', 'historical', 'background', 'understand', 'how', 'complex', 'significant', 'was', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'Carmelite', 'nuns', 'set', 'up', 'convent', 'Auschwitz', 'compound', 'action', 'deeply', 'Jews', 'even', 'nuns', 'are', 'trying', 'aid', 'poor', 'pray', 'people', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'now', 'Pope', 'excited', 'clear', 'degradation', 'Communist', 'power', 'Poland', 'rest', 'Eastern', 'Europe.This', 'stage', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'confrontation', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Jewish', 'people', 'want', 'Auschwitz', 'remain', 'memorial', 'Jewish', 'victims', 'Holocaust', 'People', 'Polish', 'side', 'want', 'memory', 'Polish', 'victims', 'be', 'emphasized', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'even', '40', 'years', 'feelings', 'are', 'raw', 'then', 'Jean-Marie', 'mediate', 'then', 'aggressively', 'lobby', 'have', 'nuns', 'moved', 'away', 'Auschwitz', 'suitable', 'location', 'short', 'distance', 'story', 'real', 'generally', 'understandable', 'knowledge', 'what', 'happened', 'Auschwitz', 'anti-Semitism', 'rampant', 'Poland', '1930', 'role', 'Communism', 'controlling', 'Poland', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'background', 'life', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'will', 'improve', 'viewers', 'understanding', 'complexity', 'location', 'small', 'convent', 'nuns', 'determined', 'do', 'good', 'works', 'may', 'seem', 'trivial', 'context', 'not.This', 'powerful', 'film', 'Jean-Marie', 'Lustiger', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'was', 'forceful', 'nickname', 'was', 'Bulldozer', 'was', 'committed', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'Many', 'people', 'did', 'unusual', 'things', 'order', 'survive', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'conversion', 'Jean-Marie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'criticized', 'what', 'did', 'adult', 'astounding', 'video', 'many', 'aspects', 'greatness', 'even', 'when', 'lecturing', 'increasingly', 'frail', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II']",The Jewish Cardinal
1671916,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00FL2EWYM,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","The Jewish Cardinal left me speechless. I can't stop thinking about this film, the amazing camera work, the powerful acting, and the fact that this film is based on a true story. This film is a small masterpiece. I never expected to be so drawn in.The Jewish Cardinal is based on the story of Jean-Marie Lustiger, born to Polish - Jewish parents. He decides at age 13 to be baptized Catholic. Ultimately he is appointed archbishop.This is not necessarily a religious film, that film would be a documentary about Lustiger. The English title suggests a more religious undertone. The more literal translation from French - Le m&eacute;tis de Dieu - is the mixed race of god (metis is somebody of mixed ancestry). Instead this is a film about a man's struggle with what he believes is right and the things that happen around him. The time and place are so critical to this film - the first Polish Pope, the Berlin Wall on the verge of coming down, and a strong movement questioning the reality of the holocaust.Near the end of the film, Lustiger - Father Bulldozer - says, ""I am gods mixed child"". It seemed like that moment encapsulated the film - it is about the conflict between two worlds. Something that is universally powerful.The film is carried by Laurent Lucas as Jean-Marie Lustiger. His performance is so powerful. Even with this power, there is a subtlety in exactly what he says. It is hard to translate; there are certain words and tones that a priest would rarely use. Lucas understood how to emphasize or minimize those words. He made Lustiger come alive, made him more of an everyman. The supporting cast is wonderful.Every shot is carefully framed. The plane of focus was used so many times to reinforce the story. There was a scene with two people and the entire foreground was out of focus and off in the distance the critical character of the moment is in sharp focus. Using these subtle techniques makes the film so much more powerful.The film is not rated. It is presented in French and Hebrew with English subtitles. There is no nudity, violence, or strong language. It is probably acceptable for all viewers.This is an amazing film. At an hour and forty minutes it is exactly the right length. An interesting companion to this film would be Hitler's Children, a film about the descendants of the upper ranks of Hitler's regime and their difficulty living with what their parents did, (Hitler's Children).Film Movement includes a bonus short on the DVD.

1671917,A358AG4MJTFVTS,B00FL2EWYM,E. Simpson,"[0, 0]","This movie is a moving and enlightening look at how the consequences of one man's personal faith experience affect not only his own life and his family's connection but also the public around him. A beautiful faith experience becomes a profound burden because we make the chooser the carrier of our collective agendas and conflicts whether he wants it or not. The challenge for the human at the center of this story is how to transcend the rest of us.As a 14 year old, a young Jewish boy under the pressure of family separation and personal danger finds a deep sense of peace in a Catholic church. The experience is so profound it changes everything about his life, except his sense of himself as a Jew. While he later converts and joins the priesthood on the basis of the power of that experience, his clarity about his own identity never waivers and that is part of what makes this story special. The young man probably anticipated that his private moment of decision would have profound family consequences. But as this film shows, his &#34;private&#34; decision never stopped echoing publicly and in time. In addition to the personal and family consequences driven by his experience of faith, the decision to convert and join the priesthood took on a public meaning with conservative Catholics and a collective meaning for Jews concerned with how the conversion could be played against their community. These were reactions the youngster obviously never anticipated but that the human being has to deal with his entire life.That could be considered the story of how he responds to the negative side of his choice. Against that there is the fact that his personal uniqueness leads to him being present with the right history and influence at just the right moment to deal with what could have become (at the very least) a disturbing challenge to his mother's memory and that of other Jews lost in the holocast. That is a story often found in Jewish history, whether it is the story of Moses or the story of Esther: the Jew who does not forget his or her origins and is positioned as if by magic -- or God -- to serve their people when they are needed. It's a perspective his people hadn't considered but I found it a powerful subtext in the film if one asks, 'why him, why at that time and place?' It's what makes this a film well worth seeing by Christians, Jews, and people who believe in the power of the spirit.",4,A faith experience...and then what?,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,2418,"['movie', 'moving', 'enlightening', 'look', 'how', 'consequences', 'one', 'man', 'personal', 'faith', 'experience', 'affect', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'life', 'family', 'connection', 'also', 'public', 'beautiful', 'faith', 'experience', 'profound', 'burden', 'make', 'chooser', 'carrier', 'collective', 'agendas', 'not', 'challenge', 'human', 'center', 'story', 'how', 'transcend', 'rest', 'us.As', '14', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'pressure', 'family', 'separation', 'personal', 'danger', 'deep', 'sense', 'peace', 'Catholic', 'church', 'experience', 'so', 'profound', 'everything', 'life', 'sense', 'Jew', 'later', 'converts', 'priesthood', 'basis', 'power', 'experience', 'clarity', 'own', 'identity', 'never', 'waivers', 'part', 'what', 'story', 'special', 'young', 'man', 'probably', 'anticipated', 'private', 'moment', 'decision', 'would', 'have', 'profound', 'family', 'consequences', 'film', '34', 'private', '34', 'decision', 'never', 'stopped', 'echoing', 'publicly', 'time', 'addition', 'personal', 'family', 'consequences', 'driven', 'experience', 'faith', 'decision', 'convert', 'join', 'priesthood', 'took', 'public', 'meaning', 'conservative', 'Catholics', 'collective', 'meaning', 'Jews', 'concerned', 'how', 'conversion', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'community', 'were', 'reactions', 'youngster', 'obviously', 'never', 'anticipated', 'human', 'being', 'deal', 'entire', 'life.That', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'story', 'how', 'negative', 'side', 'choice', 'fact', 'personal', 'uniqueness', 'leads', 'being', 'present', 'right', 'history', 'influence', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'deal', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'least', 'disturbing', 'challenge', 'mother', 'memory', 'other', 'Jews', 'lost', 'holocast', 'story', 'often', 'found', 'Jewish', 'history', 'story', 'Moses', 'story', 'Esther', 'Jew', 'who', 'not', 'forget', 'origins', 'positioned', 'magic', 'God', 'serve', 'people', 'when', 'are', 'needed', 'perspective', 'people', 'had', ""n't"", 'considered', 'found', 'powerful', 'subtext', 'film', 'one', 'why', 'time', 'place', 'what', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'Christians', 'Jews', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'power', 'spirit']",The Jewish Cardinal
1671918,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00FL2EWYM,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","According to direct Ilan Duran Cohen in response to his drive for bring the true story of Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger to film, Cohen stated,'Lustiger was always emphatic about his duel identity. In an early interview as Archbishop, he said, ""I was born Jewish, and so I remain, even if that is unacceptable for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope and I believe that Christianity is the means for achieving it.""Lustiger was a champion of interfaith dialogue and ""The Jewish Cardinal"" explores these intricacies of balancing faith, family and identity. In a scene in which nuns settle to build a convent within the walls of Auschwitz (where his mother died in 1943), his Jewishness comes most sharply to the fore and Lustiger finds himself a mediator between the two communities.'A bit of factual data: Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger 17 September 1926 - 5 August 2007 was a French cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Archbishop of Paris from 1981 until his resignation in 2005. He was created cardinal in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. Lustiger was born Aaron Lustiger in Paris, to a Jewish family. His parents, Charles and Gis&egrave;le Lustiger, were Ashkenazi Jews from B&#281;dzin, Poland, and had left Poland around World War I. Lustiger's father ran a hosiery shop. Aaron Lustiger studied at the Lyc&eacute;e Montaigne in Paris, where he first encountered anti-Semitism. Visiting Germany in 1937, he was hosted by an anti-Nazi Protestant family whose children had been required to join the Hitler Youth. Sometime between the ages of ten and twelve, Lustiger came across a Protestant Bible and felt inexplicably attracted to it. On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 the family moved to Orl&eacute;ans. In March 1940, during Holy Week, the 13-year old Lustiger decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. On 21 August he was baptized as Aaron Jean-Marie by the Bishop of Orl&eacute;ans, Jules Marie Courcoux. His sister converted later. In October 1940, the Vichy regime passed the first Statute on Jews, which forced Jews to wear a yellow badge. Although Jean-Marie Lustiger lived hidden in Orl&eacute;ans, his parents had to wear the badge. Lustiger, his father and sister sought refuge in unoccupied southern France, while his mother returned to Paris to run the family business. In September 1942, his mother was deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where she died the following year. The surviving family returned to Paris after the war.Lustiger's father tried unsuccessfully to have his son's baptism annulled, and even sought the help of the chief rabbi of Paris.Written by director Cohen and Chantal Derudder, THE JEWISH CARDINAL relates the true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger (Laurent Lucas) the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who maintained his cultural identity as a Jew even after converting to Catholicism at a young age, later joining the priesthood. Quickly rising within the ranks of the Church; Lustiger was appointed Archbishop of Paris by Pope Jean Paul II (Aurelien Recoing) - and found a new platform to celebrate his dual identity as a Catholic Jew; earning him both friends and enemies from either group. When Carmelite nuns settle down to build a convent within the cursed walls of Auschwitz, Lustiger found himself a mediator between the two communities - and may be forced at last to choose his side.The acting and the setting and the glorious musical scoring enhance this little film well. It is a powerful film to experience not only because of the quality of craftsmanship that produced it, but also because of the profound message the film's subject offers for consideration. We are all one.

1671921,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00FL2EWYM,John D. Cofield,"[10, 10]","This French film with English subtitles is the true story of Jean-Marie, Cardinal Lustiger, who was born Jewish in France in 1926.  After the German invasion of France in 1940 he converted to Roman Catholicism against the wishes of his parents and eventually joined the priesthood.  Rising quickly in the Church hierarchy, he was eventually made an archbishop by Pope John Paul II.  His dual heritage meant that some distrusted him while others saw in him an opportunity to bridge religious and cultural divides. Lustiger himself was conflicted over his role as an obedient son of the Church who remained attached to his Jewish heritage.  The Jewish Cardinal is a superb film which ably depicts Lustiger's struggles.The film begins with Lustiger's appointment as Bishop of Orleans in 1979.  We see his reaction as well as those of his widowed father (his mother died in Auschwitz)and other family members as friends.  There are some excellent scenes depicting Lustiger's meetings with Pope John Paul II, in which many of his inner misgivings about his role surface.  These misgivings continue through the rest of the film, during which we observe Lustiger's roles in such controversies as the planned construction of a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz and the canonization of Holocaust victim Edith Stein.  It is not entirely clear by the end of the film that Lustiger ever fully resolved his inner conflict, but viewers are left with a strong sense of admiration for him.",5,Dual Identity,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,1470,"['French', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'true', 'story', 'Jean-Marie', 'Cardinal', 'Lustiger', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Jewish', 'France', '1926', 'German', 'invasion', 'France', '1940', 'converted', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'wishes', 'parents', 'eventually', 'joined', 'priesthood', 'Rising', 'quickly', 'Church', 'hierarchy', 'was', 'eventually', 'made', 'archbishop', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'dual', 'heritage', 'meant', 'distrusted', 'others', 'saw', 'opportunity', 'bridge', 'religious', 'cultural', 'divides', 'Lustiger', 'was', 'conflicted', 'role', 'obedient', 'son', 'Church', 'who', 'remained', 'attached', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'Jewish', 'Cardinal', 'superb', 'film', 'ably', 'Lustiger', 'struggles.The', 'film', 'Lustiger', 'appointment', 'Bishop', 'Orleans', '1979', 'see', 'reaction', 'as', 'well', 'widowed', 'father', 'mother', 'died', 'Auschwitz', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'Lustiger', 'meetings', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'many', 'inner', 'misgivings', 'role', 'surface', 'misgivings', 'continue', 'rest', 'film', 'observe', 'Lustiger', 'roles', 'such', 'controversies', 'planned', 'construction', 'Carmelite', 'convent', 'Auschwitz', 'canonization', 'Holocaust', 'victim', 'Edith', 'Stein', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'end', 'film', 'Lustiger', 'ever', 'fully', 'resolved', 'inner', 'conflict', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'strong', 'sense', 'admiration']",The Jewish Cardinal
1671922,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00FL2EWYM,Luanne Ollivier,"[2, 2]","Director Ilan Duran Cohen brings us the true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger in his film, The Jewish Cardinal.Film Movement consistently brings award winners to the small screen and this film is no exception - it's an official selection of numerous film festivals.Lustiger was born a Jew in 1926 Poland. He converted to Catholicism at age 14. His mother was killed at Auschwitz in 1942. He rose in the ranks of the church and had the ear of Pope John Paul II.Bare bones synopsis. And they're simply facts. Cohen brings this amazing man's life to....well, life.Lustiger struggled with remaining true to his heritage, while embracing his faith. His dual 'roles' were both despised and embraced within the Church. The confrontation between the Jews and Catholics over Auschwitz and Lustiger's involvement was powerful. And enlightening - I was unaware of this piece of history.Laurent Lucas was brilliant as Cohen, more than aptly portraying Lustiger's enthusiasm, strength, faith,conflict and more. The supporting case was just as wonderful, especially Aurelien Recoing as John Paul. The scenes between these two gave an intimate view of their relationship. And a 'human' view of these two men.To be quite honest, I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. I tend to shy away from religious films. But The Jewish Cardinal was not specifically about doctrine. Instead it brings to light both an important piece of history and the life of a complicated man. I was engaged from start to finish.(The sound track was quite beautiful as well)As, always Film Movement includes a short with their DVD. This time it's an nine minute film called Kosher from director Isabelle Stead. The tie in to the main film is obvious. It's about a lonely young Jewish boy finding a pig - and keeping it for a pet.

1671923,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B00FL2EWYM,Robin Friedman,"[7, 7]","Directed by Ilan Duran Cohen, ""The Jewish Cardinal"" is based upon the life of Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger (1926 -- 2007) who late in this film refers to himself as ""God's Mixed Child"". Lustiger was born Jewish but at age of 14 converted to Catholicism after a strong religious experience. He became a priest and rose in the Church when Pope John Paul II appointed him in succession Bishop of Orleans, Archbishop of Paris, and Cardinal. Lustiger enjoyed a close relationship with Pope John Paul II and advised him on many occasions on important matters.In French with English subtitles, ""The Jewish Cardinal"" offers a moving portrayal of Lustiger, focusing on his difficult position, to himself and others, as ""God's mixed child"". The film begins with his elevation to Bishop in 1979 and proceeds forward in time with many flashbacks to Lustiger's youth. As a child, Lustiger experienced violent anti-Semitism first hand during a stay as an exchange student in Berlin in the late 1930s.  Lustiger's mother had been killed at Auschwitz. His relationship with his non-religious father was strained at best. At the end of WW II, his father tried unsuccessfully to get his son's early conversion annulled. Elements of the Catholic Church opposed Lustiger's elevation.  A passionate man, Lustiger describes himself many times in strongly Jewish terms as, for example, ""born Jewish, and so I remain.""  The film also portrays him as devoted to his Catholicism and to the Church.The movie gradually develops a focus on Lustiger's role in defusing controversy over the establishment of a convent for Carmelite nuns in the mid-1980s. Many found the convent offensive to the memory of the Jews murdered at the camp. Lustiger visited the camp and was overcome with the memory of his mother. The film shows his torment when he could pray neither as a Jew nor as a Christian. Lustiger worked with an initially hostile Polish Cardinal and with negotiators for the Jewish community. After substantial difficulty he helped persuade Pope John Paul II to close and move the convent.The movie is convincingly acted and filmed with the strongest scenes between Lustiger (Laurent Lucas) and the Polish-born Pope (Aurelien Recoing). The recently canonized John Paul II receives a sympathetic presentation, showing his religious devotion, political sensitivities, and genuine friendship with Lustiger, with the two sometimes arguing, but also having swimming races and joking. The film has an appropriate, beautiful musical score which includes music from Schubert and Gluck.The film poignantly shows an individual firm in his Catholic convictions who continued to identify with the Judaism of his birth. The situation could only produce strong internal turmoil. I learned from getting to know Cardinal Lustiger through this film.  The movie will appeal to viewers with a strong interest in religious questions, whether they are believers in a faith, of mixed faith, or of questioning, ambivalent faith.  In the modern world, there are many ways to be ""God's mixed child"".Robin Friedman",5,God's Mixed Child,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,3059,"['Directed', 'Ilan', 'Duran', 'Cohen', 'Jewish', 'Cardinal', 'based', 'life', 'Aaron', 'Jean-Marie', 'Lustiger', '1926', '2007', 'who', 'late', 'film', 'refers', 'God', 'Mixed', 'Child', 'Lustiger', 'was', 'born', 'Jewish', 'age', '14', 'converted', 'Catholicism', 'strong', 'religious', 'experience', 'became', 'priest', 'rose', 'Church', 'when', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'appointed', 'succession', 'Bishop', 'Orleans', 'Archbishop', 'Paris', 'Cardinal', 'Lustiger', 'enjoyed', 'close', 'relationship', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'advised', 'many', 'occasions', 'important', 'matters.In', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Jewish', 'Cardinal', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'Lustiger', 'focusing', 'difficult', 'position', 'others', 'God', 'mixed', 'child', 'film', 'elevation', 'Bishop', '1979', 'proceeds', 'forward', 'time', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'Lustiger', 'youth', 'child', 'Lustiger', 'experienced', 'violent', 'anti-Semitism', 'first', 'hand', 'stay', 'exchange', 'student', 'Berlin', 'late', '1930s', 'Lustiger', 'mother', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Auschwitz', 'relationship', 'non-religious', 'father', 'was', 'strained', 'best', 'end', 'WW', 'II', 'father', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'son', 'early', 'conversion', 'annulled', 'Elements', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'opposed', 'Lustiger', 'elevation', 'passionate', 'man', 'Lustiger', 'many', 'times', 'strongly', 'Jewish', 'terms', 'example', 'born', 'Jewish', 'so', 'remain', 'film', 'also', 'as', 'devoted', 'Catholicism', 'Church.The', 'movie', 'gradually', 'focus', 'Lustiger', 'role', 'defusing', 'controversy', 'establishment', 'convent', 'Carmelite', 'nuns', 'mid-1980s', 'Many', 'found', 'convent', 'offensive', 'memory', 'Jews', 'murdered', 'camp', 'Lustiger', 'visited', 'camp', 'was', 'overcome', 'memory', 'mother', 'film', 'torment', 'when', 'could', 'pray', 'Jew', 'Christian', 'Lustiger', 'worked', 'initially', 'hostile', 'Polish', 'Cardinal', 'negotiators', 'Jewish', 'community', 'substantial', 'difficulty', 'helped', 'persuade', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'close', 'move', 'convent.The', 'movie', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'filmed', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'Lustiger', 'Laurent', 'Lucas', 'Polish-born', 'Pope', 'Aurelien', 'Recoing', 'recently', 'canonized', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'sympathetic', 'presentation', 'showing', 'religious', 'devotion', 'political', 'sensitivities', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'Lustiger', 'two', 'sometimes', 'arguing', 'also', 'having', 'swimming', 'races', 'joking', 'film', 'appropriate', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'music', 'Schubert', 'Gluck.The', 'film', 'poignantly', 'individual', 'firm', 'Catholic', 'convictions', 'who', 'continued', 'identify', 'Judaism', 'birth', 'situation', 'could', 'only', 'produce', 'strong', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'learned', 'getting', 'know', 'Cardinal', 'Lustiger', 'film', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'strong', 'interest', 'religious', 'questions', 'are', 'believers', 'faith', 'mixed', 'faith', 'questioning', 'ambivalent', 'faith', 'modern', 'world', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'be', 'God', 'mixed', 'child', '.Robin', 'Friedman']",The Jewish Cardinal
1671924,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00FL2EWYM,Tommy Dooley,"[2, 2]","Based on the real life story of Jean-Marie Lustiger; a man born to Jewish parents who converted, when he was fourteen, to the Church of Rome. He went on to become a priest in Paris and was then spotted by Pope John Paul II as a rising star who could help invigorate the faith of the French people.He had lost his mother to the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau and his father could not reconcile that his son had turned his back on Judaism. Seen as an apostate by some Jews and a good advert for Catholicism by the Pope he had to struggle with his internal demons. This is compounded when he reaches the lofty heights of Cardinal and gets embroiled in the politics of the former Eastern Union with its Soviet masters.This is a very well made film, stunning performances abound with Aur&eacute;lien Recoing (`Blue is the warmest colour') putting in a convincing performance of the Pope. Though this was actually a made for TV French film, it still has extremely high production values and good attention to period detail. It is a thoughtful, well observed and fairly well balanced view of a man whose life was anything but ordinary. Gr&eacute;goire Leprince-Ringuet as Father Julien is brilliant too but I have a soft spot for him after his performances in `The Snows of Kilimanjaro' and `The Mysteries of Lisbon'.

1671925,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B00FL2EWYM,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[3, 3]","This 100-minute French film covers some key moments in the friendship of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger and Pope John Paul II, who appointed the Jewish convert-priest as archbishop of Paris and his close adviser during the 1980s. The real-life Lustiger, who converted to Catholicism at age 14 and whose entire family except for his dad was killed at Auschwitz, died in 2007.Lustiger, a Catholic prelate who considered himself both Jewish and Christian in a vague way that sometimes offended members of both faiths, makes an intriguing subject for a film. As played by Laurent Lucas, he seethes with anti-authoritarian anger and wild energy, expertly corralled in service of John Paul II's anti-communist realpolitik. There are a few unexpectedly quirky and fun scenes in this movie, which depicts JPII as an iron-willed politician who was at the same time not above wearing white sneakers and jumping into a swimming pool he had constructed at his Castel Gandalfo vacation residence. The offbeat depiction of the Polish pontiff, suggesting the humor and spontaneity behind his public persona, is a highlight of this film as it convincingly humanizes the recently-sainted John Paul II in the early years of his papacy. Many of the fictionalized private scenes between Lustiger and JPII crackle with creative energy.Unfortunately, the film fails to maintain that fresh vibe throughout, ending up as good rather than great because of its uneven plotting. After setting up Lustiger's rise in the church hierarchy, it settles down into a one-issue plot about the controversial presence of a Carmelite convent in Auschwitz under the Communist Polish regime, ignoring nearly all other aspects of his ecclesiastical biography. Character motivations are left vague, but the film suggests JPII allowed the convent to stay there for years as a symbol of resistance to the Communists, only ordering its 1993 transfer as an olive branch to Judaism after the Iron Curtain was torn down. Like many European films, these developments are handled in the talkiest fashion possible, as the film tells more than it shows.Rather than gaining momentum, the film gradually slows to a crawl as the episodic narrative stops in Auschwitz. As a throwaway, the screenplay implies at one point that Lustiger personally convinced JPII to visit the Holy Land in 2000, and there are so many of these loaded and over-simplified statements that the movie's version of history starts to feel vaguely suspect after awhile. The movie also has an unfortunate tendency to alternate moments of self-righteous sincerity (Lucas lacks the gravitas to make Lustiger's inner turmoil entirely accessible to viewers) with cartoonish melodrama, as when a group of Catholic schismatics loyal to Marcel Lefebvre burst into a Parisian church where they start taunting Lustiger with crude anti-Semitic slurs.Overall, I recommend giving the film a look, as it rises to some great moments when it focuses on Lustiger's struggle to be both Catholic and Jewish, but it's not the most memorable thing you'll ever see. The DVD is fortunately loaded with great trailers and extras, including an Israeli short film, to keep one engaged. If you're interested in learning about a religious leader who tried to live in two different faith worlds, you'll probably enjoy it, even if you'll be rolling your eyes at it in spots.",4,Quirky French film on John Paul II's Jewish convert advisor,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,3359,"['100-minute', 'French', 'film', 'key', 'moments', 'friendship', 'Cardinal', 'Jean-Marie', 'Lustiger', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'who', 'appointed', 'Jewish', 'convert-priest', 'archbishop', 'Paris', 'close', 'adviser', '1980s', 'real-life', 'Lustiger', 'who', 'converted', 'Catholicism', 'age', '14', 'entire', 'family', 'dad', 'was', 'killed', 'Auschwitz', 'died', '2007.Lustiger', 'Catholic', 'prelate', 'who', 'considered', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'vague', 'way', 'sometimes', 'offended', 'members', 'faiths', 'intriguing', 'subject', 'film', 'played', 'Laurent', 'Lucas', 'anti-authoritarian', 'anger', 'wild', 'energy', 'expertly', 'corralled', 'service', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'anti-communist', 'realpolitik', 'are', 'few', 'unexpectedly', 'quirky', 'fun', 'scenes', 'movie', 'JPII', 'iron-willed', 'politician', 'who', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'wearing', 'white', 'sneakers', 'jumping', 'swimming', 'pool', 'had', 'constructed', 'Castel', 'Gandalfo', 'vacation', 'residence', 'offbeat', 'depiction', 'Polish', 'pontiff', 'suggesting', 'humor', 'spontaneity', 'public', 'persona', 'highlight', 'film', 'convincingly', 'recently-sainted', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'early', 'years', 'papacy', 'Many', 'fictionalized', 'private', 'scenes', 'Lustiger', 'JPII', 'crackle', 'creative', 'energy.Unfortunately', 'film', 'maintain', 'fresh', 'vibe', 'ending', 'up', 'as', 'good', 'rather', 'great', 'uneven', 'plotting', 'setting', 'up', 'Lustiger', 'rise', 'church', 'hierarchy', 'down', 'one-issue', 'plot', 'controversial', 'presence', 'Carmelite', 'convent', 'Auschwitz', 'Communist', 'Polish', 'regime', 'ignoring', 'nearly', 'other', 'aspects', 'ecclesiastical', 'biography', 'Character', 'motivations', 'are', 'left', 'vague', 'film', 'JPII', 'allowed', 'convent', 'stay', 'there', 'years', 'symbol', 'resistance', 'Communists', 'only', 'ordering', '1993', 'transfer', 'olive', 'branch', 'Judaism', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'was', 'torn', 'down', 'many', 'European', 'films', 'developments', 'are', 'handled', 'talkiest', 'fashion', 'possible', 'film', 'more', 'shows.Rather', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'film', 'gradually', 'crawl', 'episodic', 'narrative', 'stops', 'Auschwitz', 'throwaway', 'screenplay', 'one', 'point', 'Lustiger', 'personally', 'convinced', 'JPII', 'visit', 'Holy', 'Land', '2000', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'loaded', 'over-simplified', 'statements', 'movie', 'version', 'history', 'starts', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'suspect', 'awhile', 'movie', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'alternate', 'moments', 'self-righteous', 'sincerity', 'Lucas', 'gravitas', 'make', 'Lustiger', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'entirely', 'accessible', 'viewers', 'cartoonish', 'melodrama', 'when', 'group', 'Catholic', 'schismatics', 'loyal', 'Marcel', 'Lefebvre', 'burst', 'Parisian', 'church', 'where', 'start', 'taunting', 'Lustiger', 'crude', 'anti-Semitic', 'slurs.Overall', 'recommend', 'giving', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'moments', 'when', 'Lustiger', 'struggle', 'be', 'Catholic', 'Jewish', 'not', 'most', 'memorable', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'DVD', 'fortunately', 'loaded', 'great', 'trailers', 'extras', 'including', 'Israeli', 'short', 'film', 'keep', 'one', 'engaged', ""'re"", 'interested', 'learning', 'religious', 'leader', 'who', 'tried', 'live', 'two', 'different', 'faith', 'worlds', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'spots']",The Jewish Cardinal
