940030,A3ZVT943RJ3J2,B000BC8STW,Ian Martin,"[5, 6]","I've been waiting since the late 80's to see the Chick Corea Elektric Band. The years passed and I had long given up that I'd ever see most of the original members playing together (living in South Africa and then New Zealand doesn't help seeing artists like these either!). What a joy to watch this DVD and see Chick, Frank, Eric, John and Dave stretching out and enjoying themselves. An additional surprise was how recent a recording this is - 2004 at Montreux. This means great sound and lovely clarity of picture. Final surprise is the low price of this DVD. Over two hours of concert, this is great, great value.There is a danger of rating this DVD too highly simply because of the lack of decent live contemporary jazz DVDs. There seems to be such a small selection of recent fusion jazz or even progressive rock concerts - and these are the type of concerts you want to view again and again. (Where are the live DVDs of Tribal Tech, Allan Holdsworth, CAB, Michael Brecker, Dregs, Yellowjackets or Baked Potato concerts etc.)If I look at this objectively, this DVD fails in some critical areas. Yes, the concert is wonderful and I love the wide range of material and a chance for the players to solo to their hearts content. But I watch a DVD to see them - for most of this concert you do not see Chick Corea's hands. It is unbelievable that the film crew could not get a camera behind Chick. Fortunately he comes on stage and straps on his guitar-like keyboard towards the end of the concert otherwise you'd never see his hands up close. (It's like watching a Wimbledon tennis match and only seeing where the ball lands and never seeing the players serve.) Fortunately Gambale, Marienthal and Patitucci get excellent footage so all is not lost. I can't say the same for Weckl. Often the camera angle is directly behind him - don't camera men know that the side drum needs to be seen? There are some appalling calls as to which camera shots are used. During a drum solo where Chick is comping (I think this is called drumming over an ostinato pattern?) the camera focuses on Chick's hands doing almost nothing while arguably one of the world's finest jazz drummers is not shown at all. Often the camera man realises that Dave is doing something fantastic but by the time they focus on him, the fill is long finished. Oh the frustration while watching.We are fortunate that this is such a long concert so they do manage to give Dave Weckl some coverage. Without going to the trouble of literally timing with a stop watch, it's quite clear that Chick and Dave get the least coverage. The camera focuses on the middle of the stage where John Patitucci happens to be standing. This means great coverage of his bass work - and as he is an animated, incredible musician this is not a bad thing. I'd have just liked more of Dave!In spite of these flaws, this is still my favourite contemporary jazz concert DVD. Don't hesitate if you love exciting, live jazz. Watch this DVD and see one of the greatest lineup of jazz musicians of the last two decades.",4,"Great musicianship, excitement plus superb DVD value",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3051,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'late', '80', 'see', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'Elektric', 'Band', 'years', 'passed', 'had', 'long', 'given', 'up', ""'d"", 'ever', 'see', 'most', 'original', 'members', 'playing', 'together', 'living', 'South', 'Africa', 'then', 'New', 'Zealand', ""n't"", 'help', 'seeing', 'artists', 'What', 'joy', 'watch', 'DVD', 'see', 'Chick', 'Frank', 'Eric', 'John', 'Dave', 'stretching', 'out', 'enjoying', 'additional', 'surprise', 'was', 'how', 'recent', 'recording', '2004', 'Montreux', 'great', 'sound', 'lovely', 'clarity', 'picture', 'Final', 'surprise', 'low', 'price', 'DVD', 'two', 'hours', 'concert', 'great', 'great', 'value.There', 'danger', 'rating', 'DVD', 'too', 'highly', 'simply', 'lack', 'decent', 'live', 'contemporary', 'jazz', 'DVDs', 'be', 'such', 'small', 'selection', 'recent', 'fusion', 'jazz', 'even', 'progressive', 'rock', 'concerts', 'are', 'type', 'concerts', 'want', 'view', 'again', 'again', 'Where', 'are', 'live', 'DVDs', 'Tribal', 'Tech', 'Allan', 'Holdsworth', 'CAB', 'Michael', 'Brecker', 'Dregs', 'Baked', 'Potato', 'etc', 'look', 'objectively', 'DVD', 'critical', 'areas', 'Yes', 'concert', 'wonderful', 'love', 'wide', 'range', 'material', 'chance', 'players', 'solo', 'hearts', 'content', 'watch', 'DVD', 'see', 'most', 'concert', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'hands', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'crew', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'camera', 'Chick', 'Fortunately', 'stage', 'straps', 'guitar-like', 'keyboard', 'end', 'concert', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'hands', 'up', 'close', 'watching', 'Wimbledon', 'tennis', 'match', 'only', 'seeing', 'where', 'ball', 'never', 'seeing', 'players', 'serve', 'Fortunately', 'Gambale', 'Marienthal', 'Patitucci', 'get', 'excellent', 'footage', 'so', 'not', 'lost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'Weckl', 'Often', 'camera', 'angle', 'directly', 'do', ""n't"", 'camera', 'men', 'know', 'side', 'drum', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'appalling', 'calls', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'used', 'drum', 'solo', 'where', 'Chick', 'comping', 'think', 'called', 'drumming', 'ostinato', 'pattern', 'camera', 'Chick', 'hands', 'doing', 'almost', 'nothing', 'arguably', 'one', 'world', 'finest', 'jazz', 'drummers', 'not', 'shown', 'camera', 'man', 'Dave', 'doing', 'something', 'fantastic', 'time', 'focus', 'fill', 'long', 'finished', 'Oh', 'frustration', 'watching.We', 'are', 'fortunate', 'such', 'long', 'concert', 'do', 'manage', 'give', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'coverage', 'going', 'trouble', 'literally', 'timing', 'stop', 'watch', 'quite', 'clear', 'Chick', 'Dave', 'get', 'least', 'coverage', 'camera', 'middle', 'stage', 'where', 'John', 'Patitucci', 'be', 'standing', 'great', 'coverage', 'bass', 'work', 'animated', 'incredible', 'musician', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""'d"", 'have', 'just', 'liked', 'more', 'Dave', 'spite', 'flaws', 'still', 'favourite', 'contemporary', 'jazz', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'love', 'exciting', 'live', 'jazz', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'see', 'one', 'greatest', 'lineup', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'last', 'two', 'decades']",N/A

940033,AXEK54VJW359,B000BC8STW,"James A. Pantano ""jackthewhack""","[0, 0]","recently i saw these guys perform at the blue note in new york city. the only  difference was victor wooten played bass instead of john pattitucci. they performed about half as many songs as whats on this dvd and none thankfully from ""to the stars"". ive seen chick perform many many times over the years so after reading these many positive reviews here i picked this dvd up. my critisisms of this dvd are based partly on a comparative and partly on a technical note. right away i was dissapointed in this dvd  because there is so much time devoted to ""to the stars"", an album i did not like. whether studio or live i still dont much care for it. eternal child taken from the eye of the beholder cd (my personal favorite) was performed at the show i saw and was much like it is here, one of chicks best compositions, performed superbly. cta was also performed at the blue note although i thought the blue note performance was much much better. dave weckl had a very lengthy drum solo at the beginning of the song that was amazing. the drum solo intro is lacking on the dvd though the song itself seems a bit to long. another thing i did not care for on the dvd performance was the silly ""audience participation"" sequence. ten minutes of people ""singing"" to chicks keyboard musings was in a word ""wack"". the bands performance on this dvd though is excellent. got a match, spain, and blue miles nicely round out the second half of this dvds songs. on the technical side of things, the visually clarity of the picture is excellent and the lighting is decent. the camera angles and editing are average at best and i feel im being generous with this assumption. too often i find the camera is not showing me what i want to look at. if you love the bass though john pattitucci is in just about every shot. angles of drummer dave weckl are poor. we either see his back or half of his face obscured by drum and cymbal hardware. many times when dave is soloing the camera is all over the place trying to find a decent angle then  sometimes it just zooms in on some other band members facial exspressions. chick doesnt fare that well either, mostly we see weird facial exspressions and some angles from what appears to be the floor just under the piano. i mean it almost seems to me that the camera crew walked in five minutes before the show started and just crouched down where ever. the audio was very good for all the instruments except the drums which were recorded a bit too low in the mix. again if you like the bass it seems to stands out the most. so overall if you try to convince yourself that the price of the dvd is worth it for just a particular song or two or three, or because theres not a wealth of chick corea elektric band performances on dvd then go for it. its not a bad  dvd. its just that im an armchair music video director. and p.s. the reviewer who said the picture and the audio are not in sync is correct. its slight, but i too noticed it, although others who watched it with me said i was ""seeing things"". sure.",3,"ah montreux,  jazz capital of the universe?",1164844800,"11 30,

940034,A5XU9GCSRUNMK,B000BC8STW,Jeff Arenson,"[38, 39]","Chick Corea has been the most important Jazz Musician since Miles Davis, and this DVD shows that he still is just that. Joining Chick are all 4 original members of the Elektric Band. Each memeber of the Elektric band is quite possibly the best performer at his instrument. Eric Marienthal is a great sax player and performs at a top level during this whole set. John Patitucci is an amazing bass player. His standard fingering bass technique is nothing short of greatness; His phrasing and playing on this show that. Dave Weckl is one of the best drummers on the planet and has been for decades. His playing on this DVD is a must hear for drummers. He has taken his virtuosity to a new level. Frank Gambale is one of the best Fusion guitarists alive. His sweep picking technique has been a major influence on guitarists since the mid 1980's and he is spellbinding to hear. Together, they are the most talented group of musicians touring together on the planet. I have never seen a better band.(Some on the same level, but none better) During the 80's/90s this group recorded 4 great Cds together and I saw all of those tours. The decade between those cds and ""To The Stars"" didn't do anything to their compositions, telepathic interplay, virtuosity or live performance.  This DVD captures the band at their most incredible state yet.The DVD is quality with good camera work and sound. The performance totals over 2 1/2 hours!The concert is in two parts. The first part is a live version of the ""Two The Stars"" CD. Like all other CCEB tours, the music is taken to greater heights. The band improvises greatly and on ""Check Blast"", ""Mistress Luck"", and ""The Long Passage"" the band takes turns amazing the audience and each other. All members of the band applaud for each other and Chick has a smile that shows he knows that something special happens when he is playing with these guys. They even do an extended acoustic version of ""Alan Corday"" which is amazing. I found ""To The Stars"" to be a good but not great Corea effort. This version is as amazing as anything that they have ever done. The band then takes a break.As great as the first part of the concert is, the second part is unreal. The band performs music from their 80's/90's tours. ""CTA"" is a Jimmy Heath song that the CCEB have been covering for years and have played during these last reunion tours nightly. This song is unbelievable. Each member of the band takes a solo spot. It is during this set that Dave Weckl takes his drumming to a new level. ""Eternal Child"" is from the ""Eye of the Beholder"" Cd. Once again, the band takes a compostion that I found to be good on Cd and make it great live. The whole band improvises again, and Gambale, Patitucci, and Marienthal are all incredible. (""Not shabby"" in the words of Corea) 'Got A Match?' has always been a concert favorite and this version is awe inspiring. Chick starts out by trading be-bop lines with the audience. Then a great be-bop/jazz incluenced melody is played and improvised over. The whole band's virtuosity is taken to new levels. Most notable is John Patitucci's bass work. He never stops his ""walking"" bass and his solo is incredible. I am glad that Chick was able to get him for this gig. Chick, Marienthal and Gambale all add their own solos and then Chick trades fours with Dave Weckl. There has always been a special level of interplay between these two. They team up, yet again, to inspire each other and the audience. There is a flurry of unison lines by all and then the song ends. This tune is JAZZ fusion and an acoustic version would be amazing. All of Chick's years studying be-bop and jazz come out on this masterpiece. The DVD price is paid in full by this song alone. The first encore is ""Spain"". ""Spain"" has been a Corea concert staple for decades. The intro, based on the adagio movement from the ""concierto de aranjuez""(Rodrigo), is improvised by both Corea and Patitucci. There are definite classical overtones during this part of the song. During the actual song, Marienthal and Gambale provide solos that are short, well phrased and virtuostic. Weckl closes it out with his typical brilliance. ""Blue Miles"" is the closer and the band shows some bluesy influences in the main theme. All performers do their thing again and then the show is over.To sum it up; This is the DVD that Fusion fans have been dreaming of and is now a reality. You will never buy a better Jazz/Rock/Fusion DVD based on Talent of the band. If you are a fan of any of these 5, then you'll want this immediately. As individuals, each member is an absolute revelation on his instrument and as a group this is a truly timeless perfomance.

Very, very recommended.",5,Top-Notch All The Way!,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,439,"['have', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'who', 'fan', 'jazz', 'jazz-rock-fusion', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'guys', 'play', 'incredible', 'fluidity', 'Watching', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'beautiful', 'atmospheres', 'furious', 'burning', 'tempos', 'complex', 'time', 'signatures', 'hard', 'describe', 'few', 'do', 'better', 'CC', 'Electric', 'Band', 'guys', 'are', 'best', 'best', 'top-notch', 'way', 'Very', 'very', 'recommended']",N/A

He must've watched it on a PC DVD player and that tends to lose synchronicity.  But, enough about that.  The concert was all that I hope to have from the Electric Band.  This was way more than adaquate.  The performances given by each musician was nothing but unselfish love and devotion to the fans.  No, and I mean NO punches were pulled in their performances.  The endurance that Dave Weckl has to play using such a physical instrument (Drums) is a testimant to his flawless abilities as a drummer.  I know him personally and I know that he suffers from a injured left shoulder and to play like he does, you'd never know it!!!!I'm very happy to have this in my collection.  I felt the drums could've come up a little more in the mix because at times the keyboards and synth were too loud and overshadowed the rest of the group.  But other than that, it was such a delight to watch and enjoy these guys.  I highly recommend this concert if you are a true fan of Chick and the band.",5,One of the best DVD Concerts ever,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1089,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'guy', 'talking', 'misaligned', 'video', 'audio', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'perfect', 'must', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'PC', 'DVD', 'player', 'lose', 'synchronicity', 'enough', 'concert', 'was', 'hope', 'have', 'Electric', 'Band', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'adaquate', 'performances', 'given', 'musician', 'was', 'nothing', 'unselfish', 'love', 'devotion', 'fans', 'No', 'mean', 'punches', 'were', 'pulled', 'performances', 'endurance', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'play', 'using', 'such', 'physical', 'instrument', 'Drums', 'testimant', 'flawless', 'abilities', 'drummer', 'know', 'personally', 'know', 'injured', 'left', 'shoulder', 'play', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'collection', 'felt', 'drums', 'could', ""'ve"", 'come', 'up', 'little', 'more', 'mix', 'times', 'keyboards', 'synth', 'were', 'too', 'loud', 'overshadowed', 'rest', 'group', 'other', 'was', 'such', 'delight', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'guys', 'highly', 'recommend', 'concert', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'Chick', 'band']",N/A

Now bad news. This DVD has convinced me that cameramen are inherent morons. I fully agree with Alejandro Briceno. It is just beyond any visual logic why they show the jerking head of John Patitucci or the back of Dave Weckl, when Frank Gambale is playing solo. Why they show Chick Corea or Dave Weckl, when John Patitucci is playing solo. Otherwise, greatly recommended.",5,Bravo!,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,505,"['Good', 'news', 'first', 'remarkable', 'perfomance', 'Superb', 'musicianship', 'am', 'most', 'fascinated', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'Frank', 'Gambale', 'playing', 'Now', 'bad', 'news', 'DVD', 'convinced', 'cameramen', 'are', 'inherent', 'morons', 'fully', 'agree', 'Alejandro', 'Briceno', 'just', 'visual', 'logic', 'why', 'show', 'jerking', 'head', 'John', 'Patitucci', 'back', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'when', 'Frank', 'Gambale', 'playing', 'solo', 'Why', 'show', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'Dave', 'Weckl', 'when', 'John', 'Patitucci', 'playing', 'solo', 'Otherwise', 'greatly', 'recommended']",N/A
