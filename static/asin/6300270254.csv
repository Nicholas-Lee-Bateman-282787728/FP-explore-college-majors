236243,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,6300270254,Chad Radford,"[0, 0]","""Of Unknown Origin"" is a fun little horror film about a yuppie who has a problem with an invasive rat that takes roost in his brownstone apartment and causes all kinds of damage and problems.  Things really escalate when his wife and child go out of town on vacation while he stays behind to finish a large, high-profile project at work and take care of his rat problem.  Things escalate as the rat causes more and more damage and seems to get more intelligent as the movie reaches its climax.  Peter Weller's character starts losing it at work because of this demon rat in his home and things spiral way out of control.

Now i have known about this one since it's theatrical release, but this little gem has managed to evade me for a viewing all these years! Thanks to DVD. I finally got to peep it out. I wasn't expecting much. But when the credits rolled I felt all warm and fuzzy for laying out the dough on this title!Most the other reviewers here applaud Weller's performance. And I must say it's maybe even the strongest one I've seen from him.He plays the family guy, whose wife (Shannon Tweed in her screen debut) takes the kid and goes off to vacation at her parent's. Weller's character can not go because he's trying to get a deal through at work that could give him a big promotion. Soon after his wife and kid leave, a pretty big damned rat infiltrates Weller's brownstone abode which he has obsessively renovated painstakingly by hand. Basically Weller is a neat freak! And when the rat begins to vandalize the house as rodent's do... He begins to go nutty and obsessive on how to get rid of it... And soon it's a battle of life and death over which one will be king of the castle!While others associate this film to the likes of Ben and mayhaps even Food of the Gods. I found this film to be rather original! Probably mostly in part to superior characterizations which make the tale work damn good.The ladies will most likely freak out on this one though. Let's just say the big rat get's quite brazen at times trying to take over the house as his territory! If you think you get it bad enough to keep the seat down! Well then... Don't let 'em see this one!I think it's a pretty safe bet that well rounded horror afficandos will be pleased with purchasing this one. All others should try to give it the ole' rental first.",4,Wow!

Great actor.The Bad -- Despite this movie's short running time, things drag on for way too long; so much so that I fell asleep about halfway through for a few minutes, woke up, found that the scene I fell asleep to was repeating, and then went back to sleep until the last few minutes. The worst offense a movie can commit is to bore and this movie did that in spades.By the way, this movie is basically a one-man show -- Peter Weller vs. the rat. The advertising makes it seem like his family is terrorized; they're not; they're only in the movie for a few minutes.The Ugly -- The killer rat. Really. It's ugly. And extremely fake-looking.

236253,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,6300270254,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Let's paint a portrait of our protagonist.  Peter Weller plays a proud father and husband who is an all-round nice guy.  He says good morning to the newspaper stand lady every morning on his walk to his cushy corporate job.  He has a stunning home which was apparently professionally decorated with all accoutrements indicating affluence.  He's also up for a big promotion and, if he gets it, he won't have to struggle paying the mortgage on his gorgeous, recently renovated home.  You know, white people problems.So this movie is essentially about a rat that drives this man insane while his wife and child are out of town.  It starts out with the use of almost humorous ominous shadows.  When they start showing parts of the rat it is always wet and somewhat slimy looking as if it just took a bath in raw sewage.  The rat-cam shots also offer a charming ""rodent's eye-view"" of things.After calling in a work order on some burst pipes, Weller's eccentric plumber has no difficulty diagnosing that a rat was the cause.  Weller sets out some traps which, when he checks them, look like a cartoon surfboard after a shark attack.  This is no ordinary rat, but a super-rat!  Weller accordingly ups his game from the categorical, antiquated mouse trap to devices which more closely resemble mini-bear traps and tiny Spanish Inquisition purification devices.  He also gets into some clearly obsessive, unhealthy research, during which he finds some encyclopedia identifying that the scientific name for rats means ""of unknown origin"".  Is this true?  Don't know.  Don't care.  It works for me.  Weller also finds some of the most vilifying articles and photos of ""rat attacks"" that one could imagine.  With his newfound off-putting trivia Weller horrifies an entire dinner party ranting about disease.Back to the battle on the home front, Weller's traps have been failing.  He moves on to poison, which he purchases from another oddly fanatical anti-rat enthusiast.  Then it's back to the plumber for an awkward strategy session.  Both this vendor and his plumber, whom you would no sooner trust to watch your kids than a homeless crackhead, appear multiple times attesting to how evil, methodical and ferocious rats are.This rat accomplishes a few unreasonable acts of sabotage.  I won't explain how, but the rat actually prevents an exterminator from doing his job and even jeopardizes one of Weller's big accounts at work.  Of course, it didn't do this before cutting the phone lines and the electricity.  My lord, it's like an Al-Queda-trained rat with an MBA.  Rather than simply calling the exterminator back, Weller using some sound problem-solving skills and recruits a stray cat.  If it works in cartoons...right?  This does not work out well for the cat.  The rat even traps Weller with a rat trap.Oh, did I forget to mention that there are numerous battle scenes between Weller and this wily rodent?  The rat-attack scenes are precious.  Imagine a rabid terrier assaulting a mailman--just tearing at his ankles...or in Gremlins when they were leaping onto people's backs. That's about the flavor of it.  The ingenuity of some of the attacks is naturally ridiculous and always result the in destruction of a lot of expensive things.  Realizing that it's time to step up his game again Weller goes all Gangs of New York and engineers a needlessly elaborate weapon.  He even has a brief training montage which includes some Rocky-esque sweaty ab work.In the end, Weller does emerge victorious--I guess.  He smashes the rat while it's hiding in a doll house which unsubtly looks exactly like Weller's house.  I'll bet the director was just so proud of this clever symbolism: that he had to destroy his house to destroy the rat.

He has personally renovated a NY brownstone and is up for an important position at work.  But then two things happen.  First his wife and son go off to Vermont to visit her family.  Second, a very large rat moves in.  What follows is a sort of modern-day retelling of THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (complete with clips from the movie).As Peter becomes aware of the rat and begins to try and deal with it, he slowly becomes obsessed with freeing his home of the unwanted invader.  Obsession grows and Weller sinks deeper and deeper.  Work begins to suffer and his secretary and boss begin to worry about him.  But whatever the hardship, Weller, like the Old Man, will not let up for a moment.  I found the ending of the movie to be quite satisfying with the final lines very neatly tying the whole tale up neatly.Some may think of this as horror, some suspense, and some tragedy.  There are definitely elements of all three involved but any such label would bee to simple for what this movie really is.

Stephen King cites this as one of his all time favorite horror movies.  Of course, whether or not you can actually consider this a horror film is debatable, but what else would you categorize it as?  The plot is quite simple, and that's all part of the appeal.  Buckaroo Banzai himself finds his home invaded by a rat after his family takes off for a few days.  It starts off as an annoying nuisance, but soon turns into obsession as Weller tries to kill the damn thing.  He sorta falls into a sort of temporary insanity that affects his work performance and all those around him(of course I'd go a bit batty if I had to go a few days without Shannon Tweed myself).  It starts out simply enough with some damaged furniture and wiring.  Traps naturally don't work, neither does the exterminator or pretty much any other conventional means. By the time we reach the climax of the film, Weller's decked out in a helmet(with flashlight of course), kneepads and a homemade spiked club ready to enter a duel to the death with the invading rodent, practically destroying his home in the process(you're reminded time and again that Weller practically built the house himself as to make the damage all the more shocking).  We only see the rat in a few quick shots.  These are shots of an actual rat at various angles to give the illusion that it's larger than the average rat.  It's kinda hard to get an idea of how big the rat actually is until one scene where it slips under the covers of Weller's bed.  Then we can see it's about the size of a basketball or small dog.  Like I said before, it's a fun film.  The simple premise, the unintentional quirkiness, and a good performance by Weller all add up to a fun and entertaining time.

It is a suspenseful battle for survival in which the outcome is anything but predictable.Not campy like ""Food of the Gods,"" but more a psychological battle (and yes, a physical one) between a homeowner at wit's end, and a rat that feels he has as much a right to the house as does its human inhabitant.Over the years I have shown this film to unsuspecting guests and watched them literally jump from their seats several times.

236258,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,6300270254,William Dorfer,"[0, 0]","""Of Unknown Origin"" is one of those obscure gems that, usually, only big-time horror fans will find while delving through lists of sleeper classics. The movie stars Peter Weller as an eccentric businessman who struggles to deal with a very cunning rat that's infesting his house. What gives this movie such a kick is that it's able to work on two levels: It works both as an entertaining B-movie in the animal-horror subgenre, but it also works as a gripping psychological thriller. Throughout the movie, Peter Weller's mental stamina is tested in a progressively frustrating battle against the rat, trying to exterminate it as it runs rampant through his house. We see how he becomes hooked on eliminating vermin (see the dinner scene where he goes on about rodents as a delicacy in some countries, a scene I found to be quite funny due to the characters' awkward reactions!). In short, this is an intriguing and entertaining movie about man vs. nature in an urbanized context, well worth the watch if you want something both fun and an underlying psychological case study!
