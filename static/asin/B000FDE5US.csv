I found much of this to be based on a book by A.E. Hotchner, ""Blown Away."" It details the final months of Brian Jones' life. I was surprised by the quality of the set dressings. The wardrobes are very accurate. The scenes in Morocco are fabulous. That's where Anita Pallenberg finally dumped Brian for Keith Richards after Brian had beaten her up for refusing to join an orgy with two Moroccan women he had picked up. The only thing missing is Stones music, which I am sure, was unavilable for licensing and cost reasons. Many books have been written about how Brian died. This film makes it clear he was a victim of some jealous workmen he'd hired to renovate Cotchford Farm, the old house he'd recently bought. They rough-housed in the pool, and Brian drowned. He was not drunk or high, as he had recently cleaned up from drugs out of fear of prison after several drug busts. The resemblances to the real characters are also pretty good here.

988238,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FDE5US,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Knowing nothing about Brian Jones, I am certainly not going to judge the man based on this lurid bio-pic.  Even if the filmmaker had actually made an effort (and he didn't) to portray who this founding member of the Rolling Stones really was, you just can't trust a sensationalistic film like this to get to the truth of the matter.  Frankly, I don't see how anyone could care the least bit about the character as he is portrayed in this film.  All we see here is a pathetic human being who contributes nothing to the Rolling Stones (he won't even show up at the studio), goes on and on about ""the experiment"" to justify his constantly lascivious behavior, fills his body to overflowing with drugs and alcohol, and beats up his girlfriend.  Stoned does not put Jones' important relationship with the band in any context whatsoever, nor does it bother to scratch the surface of who the man really was as a person.  As I said, I knew nothing about Brian Jones going into this film, and I still know nothing about him after having watched it.The only purpose I can discern behind this whole project is a desire to shock the audience and thereby make money.  Take the nudity, for instance.  The full frontal male nudity in the unrated version serves no purpose whatsoever - in fact, the rest of the film's sexual content is actually pretty tame.  Then there's the ""murder"" upon which the entire film is based.  Ruled ""death by misadventure,"" Jones' untimely death is portrayed here as a homicide, pure and simple.  What proof is there that Frank Thorogood, a builder who had been working on Jones' house, committed the act?  Only the suspicions of Jones' girlfriend and Thorogood's alleged ""deathbed confession.""  Certainly, Thorogood may well have murdered Brian Jones, but it strikes me as rather dubious to categorically name him as a killer.Stoned is actually as much about Thorogood as it is about Jones.  True to form, the film tells us next to nothing about this builder who supposedly became a sort of roommate for Jones in the months preceding his death.  Here he is a rather craven creature who finds himself drawn in to the crazy lifestyle of the free-spending musician, only to rebel in a major way when he is cut off economically and personally from Jones.  Not one redeeming characteristic is to be found in this odd little man, but who knows how accurately his character is being portrayed?The film's problems are further exacerbated by its tendency to jump around far too much without establishing the context of each scene.  I don't understand why some scenes actually related to the Rolling Stones are included in this, since the film really tells you next to nothing about the group.  It's also quite peculiar that the soundtrack includes not a single Rolling Stones recording - perhaps the band refused to have anything to do with this whole sordid affair of a film.Obviously, I was under impressed by Stoned, and I am going to try my best to forget everything it told me about Brian Jones because the film doesn't strike me as reliable in its portrayal of the man.",2,"Quite a problematic, disappointing film",1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,3081,"['Knowing', 'nothing', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'judge', 'man', 'based', 'lurid', 'bio-pic', 'Even', 'filmmaker', 'had', 'actually', 'made', 'effort', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'who', 'founding', 'member', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'sensationalistic', 'film', 'get', 'truth', 'matter', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'care', 'least', 'bit', 'character', 'portrayed', 'film', 'see', 'here', 'pathetic', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'nothing', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'studio', 'experiment', 'justify', 'constantly', 'lascivious', 'behavior', 'body', 'overflowing', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Stoned', 'not', 'put', 'Jones', 'important', 'relationship', 'band', 'context', 'whatsoever', 'bother', 'scratch', 'surface', 'who', 'man', 'really', 'was', 'person', 'said', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'going', 'film', 'still', 'know', 'nothing', 'having', 'watched', 'it.The', 'only', 'purpose', 'can', 'discern', 'whole', 'project', 'desire', 'shock', 'audience', 'thereby', 'make', 'money', 'Take', 'nudity', 'instance', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'nudity', 'unrated', 'version', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'fact', 'rest', 'film', 'sexual', 'content', 'actually', 'pretty', 'tame', 'Then', 'murder', 'entire', 'film', 'based', 'Ruled', 'death', 'misadventure', 'Jones', 'untimely', 'death', 'portrayed', 'here', 'homicide', 'pure', 'simple', 'What', 'proof', 'there', 'Frank', 'Thorogood', 'builder', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'Jones', 'house', 'committed', 'act', 'Only', 'suspicions', 'Jones', 'girlfriend', 'Thorogood', 'alleged', 'deathbed', 'confession', 'Certainly', 'Thorogood', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'murdered', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'rather', 'dubious', 'categorically', 'name', 'killer.Stoned', 'actually', 'as', 'much', 'Thorogood', 'Jones', 'True', 'form', 'film', 'next', 'nothing', 'builder', 'who', 'supposedly', 'became', 'sort', 'roommate', 'Jones', 'months', 'preceding', 'death', 'Here', 'rather', 'craven', 'creature', 'who', 'drawn', 'crazy', 'lifestyle', 'free-spending', 'musician', 'only', 'rebel', 'major', 'way', 'when', 'cut', 'off', 'economically', 'personally', 'Jones', 'Not', 'one', 'redeeming', 'characteristic', 'be', 'found', 'odd', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'accurately', 'character', 'being', 'portrayed', 'film', 'problems', 'are', 'further', 'exacerbated', 'tendency', 'jump', 'around', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'establishing', 'context', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'scenes', 'actually', 'related', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'are', 'included', 'film', 'really', 'next', 'nothing', 'group', 'also', 'quite', 'peculiar', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'single', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'recording', 'perhaps', 'band', 'refused', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'whole', 'sordid', 'affair', 'film.Obviously', 'was', 'impressed', 'Stoned', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'best', 'forget', 'everything', 'told', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'film', ""n't"", 'strike', 'reliable', 'portrayal', 'man']",N/A
988239,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B000FDE5US,Danno,"[3, 3]","""Stoned"" is one of the strangest movies I've seen in a while, and I came to it better-prepared than most people. Back in 2005 I read a glowing preview of this film in the British magazine ""Uncut"" and - given that the director had produced ""The Crying Game,"" ""Mona Lisa,"" ""Backbeat,"" ""Interview with the Vampire"" and several other films that either I liked or knew had a solid critical reputation - I hoped for a well-done, low-budget docudrama about the last days of Brian Jones. Instead, what could have been a pretty gripping movie was done in by a confusing directoral style in which incomplete flashbacks predominate. Rather than really being a film about Brian Jones, this is more about how Brian Jones, in his last weeks, sucks a building contractor named Frank Thorogood into his debauched world and proceeds to play cruel and taunting mindgames. It's certainly disturbing, and falls into the ""decadent British millionaire on secluded estate torments and corrupts a flawed outsider"" genre.I wasn't fooled by the marketing at all, because I knew a film about Brian Jones had to be dark. But the advertising for this film (including the DVD cover) almost makes it look like a lighthearted Austin Powers-style sex romp/stoner comedy. This isn't the case - this is a film that has some very graphic scenes, because it is the unrated version, and there really isn't anything funny about a gifted musician's downfall. I also knew there was no way on earth any of the surviving Rolling Stones would have anything to do with this, so I wasn't surprised that not a single Jagger/Richards song appears on the soundtrack and that the characters based on the Rolling Stones would barely be given more than cameos. (Jagger and Richards come across like bland, low-key nice guys when they are given anything to do but stand in the shadows.) If you had a dime for every Rolling Stones fan who rented or bought this DVD thinking it would be about Brian's relationship with the Stones, you'd have more money than this movie earned in its limited release. We do hear soundalike versions of ""Little Red Rooster"" and ""Not Fade Away"" and get to see the actors mime the early 60s Stones fairly convincingly, but that's about it. Not even the Nanker/Phelge quasi-instrumental ""Stoned""!My main problem with the film is that it almost completely lacks focused storytelling. If I didn't already know quite a bit about Brian Jones, I would not have been able to follow this movie at all and I also would not have cared about a character that comes across as an exceptionally meanspirited misognistic bully. It's also hard to have any sympathy for Frank Thorogood as the character seems to be just a middle-aged working class bloke of minimal motivation. Brian's rapid decline and sudden death could have made a compelling character-based film, but this is just a period piece that tries to stretch its thin budget as far as it can go. I was really, really disappointed in this despite what I thought was a spot-on portrayal of Brian Jones in his last months. I wish I could recommend this without caveats, but I can't.",2,"Not bad, just not very good",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,3098,"['Stoned', 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'came', 'better-prepared', 'most', 'people', 'Back', '2005', 'read', 'glowing', 'preview', 'film', 'British', 'magazine', 'Uncut', 'given', 'director', 'had', 'produced', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Backbeat', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'liked', 'knew', 'had', 'solid', 'critical', 'reputation', 'hoped', 'well-done', 'low-budget', 'docudrama', 'last', 'days', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Instead', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'gripping', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'confusing', 'directoral', 'style', 'incomplete', 'flashbacks', 'predominate', 'Rather', 'really', 'being', 'film', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'more', 'how', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'last', 'weeks', 'building', 'contractor', 'named', 'Frank', 'Thorogood', 'debauched', 'world', 'proceeds', 'play', 'cruel', 'taunting', 'mindgames', 'certainly', 'disturbing', 'decadent', 'British', 'millionaire', 'secluded', 'estate', 'torments', 'flawed', 'outsider', 'genre.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'fooled', 'marketing', 'knew', 'film', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'had', 'be', 'dark', 'advertising', 'film', 'including', 'DVD', 'cover', 'almost', 'look', 'lighthearted', 'Austin', 'Powers-style', 'sex', 'romp/stoner', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'case', 'film', 'very', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'unrated', 'version', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'funny', 'gifted', 'musician', 'downfall', 'also', 'knew', 'was', 'way', 'earth', 'surviving', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'would', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'not', 'single', 'Jagger/Richards', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'characters', 'based', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'would', 'barely', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'cameos', 'Jagger', 'Richards', 'come', 'bland', 'low-key', 'nice', 'guys', 'when', 'are', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'stand', 'shadows', 'had', 'dime', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'fan', 'who', 'rented', 'bought', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'Brian', 'relationship', 'Stones', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'money', 'movie', 'earned', 'limited', 'release', 'do', 'hear', 'soundalike', 'versions', 'Little', 'Red', 'Rooster', 'Not', 'Fade', 'Away', 'get', 'see', 'actors', 'mime', 'early', '60s', 'Stones', 'fairly', 'convincingly', 'Not', 'even', 'Nanker/Phelge', 'quasi-instrumental', 'Stoned', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'almost', 'completely', 'lacks', 'focused', 'storytelling', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'quite', 'bit', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'follow', 'movie', 'also', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'character', 'across', 'exceptionally', 'meanspirited', 'misognistic', 'bully', 'also', 'hard', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Frank', 'Thorogood', 'character', 'be', 'just', 'middle-aged', 'working', 'class', 'bloke', 'minimal', 'motivation', 'Brian', 'rapid', 'decline', 'sudden', 'death', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'compelling', 'character-based', 'film', 'just', 'period', 'piece', 'stretch', 'thin', 'budget', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'disappointed', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'spot-on', 'portrayal', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'last', 'months', 'wish', 'could', 'recommend', 'caveats', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A

988241,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000FDE5US,Doug Anderson,"[33, 33]","While I can understand the arguments against this film I personally thought it was really interesting. If you accept that this is not going to be a story about the Rolling Stones career and that it is only going to be a story about the final months of Brian Jones' life then you will not put yourself in a position to be disappointed.Brian Jones was the founding member of the Stones and the one who turned the other guys on to the blues. He was also the acting manager of the band in the early days. However, he was also the first one to get into drugs and while the band spent the majority of its time either on the road touring or in the studio recording Brian spent an increasing amount of time in his stately mansion living like one of the landed gentry, albeit one of the stoned-out-of-his-gourd landed gentry. It was his drug problem that prohibited his touring the US with the rest of the band and it was his drug problem that prohibited his contribution to any album after 1967. The other guys occasionally came around to Brian's country estate to check in and see if he had cleaned up but they always found that he hadn't, so, finally, in 1969 Mick and Keith fired him from the band. Jones could hardly have been surprised. To make matters worse Jones girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, left him for Keith c. 1968.What the film tries to do is give us some idea of what made Brain Jones tick.  He was a restless spirit who looked like an angel but who enjoyed experimenting with the dark side. It was the free-and-experimental-spirited model/actress Anita Pallenberg who turned him on to drugs and many of the films most fascinating sequences are drug-induced fantasy sequences that involve S$M (apparently the sex of choice for rock 'n rollers)and lots of dress up and role playing. Jones loved fashion and shopping and he was always known as something of a fashion icon. However much he loved the blues he also loved North African Jajouka music (which made its way on to a couple c. 1967 Stones albums)and he also loved North Africa. But Brian also had problems. While the other Stones seemed to be able to handle recreational drugs Brian could not. Brian was always trying to test boundaries and accrding to the film it was Brian who insisted that Anita and Keith (who he could tell were attracted to each other) get together. After they had been together Brian beat Anita up and from then on out it was Keith and Anita instead of Brian and Anita.Though a few flashbacks take place when the band was just starting out (and Brian was a fully functioning member of the group) and a few scenes take place in North Africa, the majority of this film takes place inside and on the grounds of Brian's mansion. And most of the time Brian is stoned and just hanging out with his new Swedish girlfriend.The guy who would in 1993 confess to the killing of Brian Jones was hired by a trusted Stones employee to look after Brian. This guy was officially hired as a contractor to do some work on Brian's property but his unofficial duty was to keep drugs away from Brian; he was, in short, what we would today call a personal assistant. The relationship that developed between the two was a kind of friendship but a friendship in which Brian was the master and the assistant the servant. This part of the story is highly speculative because many of the episodes that took place between Brian and his hired assistant were not witnessed by anyone (with the possible exception of Brian's girlfriend who was in and out of Brians life at this time). Apparently, or at least according to this movie, the hired assistant was unsuccessful at keeping Brian clean. In fact the film alleges that Brian lured this guy into a life of drug use. But, as the episode with Anita showed, Brian could be abusive. And apparently, this film argues, he was abusive to his assistant who one night decided to retaliate.If you've ever seen Nicolas Roeg's film PERFORMANCE then you probably have some idea how a Rolling Stone lived during this era. This film is not as artsy or as mysterious or as good as PERFORMANCE, rather this film has a kind of quirky attitude and spirirt that makes it feel less like a 1960's avant-garde film (which would have been more appropriate) and more like a contemporary independent film which is in fact what it is. Brian Jones' life and death only make sense if you place it in the context of the time. The filmamkers try to do that but I don't think we ever really believe that this actor has captured Brian Jones as he was and so the legend remains intact. Still the film does some things well. The actress who plays Anita Pallenberg is brilliant. And the film shows what kinds of things Brian spent his time doing in those last months. It also sheds some light (perhaps mainly based on speculation)on to the strange circumstances that led to his death.I don't think anyone would call this the defintive Brian Jones story, but it has its moments.The music is a real disappointment. Not much in the way of Stones music here. Instead, probably due to copy right infringements, producers use random 60's tunes instead of Jones/Stones music. So instead of hearing ""2,000 Light Years From Home"" during the drug sequences we hear ""White Rabbit.""Not a masterpiece. But worth a look for Brian Jones and Stones fans who know what they are getting when they rent or buy this film. PERFORMANCE is a film you will watch over and over again. STONED is a film you will probably only watch once. You can't really play a Stone. These guys were some of the most charismatic individuals of their time and no one can capture that kind of magnetism with acting.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, and the downward spiral all three can inspire.Brian Jones was the ultimate rock tragedy, dying young, rich and ruined by his own success and the loss of his lover. But the late Rolling Stones founder deserved a better biopic than ""Stoned,"" which focuses on every part of Jones' life that is NOT interesting or insightful.The movie opens with two flashbacks -- Jones being confronted about a girl he got pregnant, and an early Stones show. Then it flips ahead several years to when builder Frank Thorogood (Paddy Considine) is being hired by soon-to-be-ex Rolling Stone Brian Jones (Gregory), to do work on his new mansion and the grounds surrounding it. Soon he's fascinated by the mercurial Jones.Jones himself is lost in memories of his glory days of drugs, sex, jetsetting and exotic music -- and especially his former lover Anita Pallenberg (Monet Mazur), who dumped him for his bandmate Keith (Ben Whishaw). He draws Thorogood into a dangerous game of hedonistic fun, until the degraded builder strikes back at him -- with tragic results.In theory, Jones was the ideal subject for a biopic -- he lived a short, colourful life full of drugs, art and sex. Perfect subjects for a wild movie. Too bad this movie is actually about Frank Thorogood.Unfortunately director Stephen Woolley doesn't seem to realize that nobody really cares about Thorogood, or why he murdered Jones. What people want is Jones -- tortured artist, forlorn child-man, girlfriend-beating sadist. Woolley provides brief glimpses (""You're fun to wind up"") into Jones' psyche, but there's a lot more of Thorogood getting stoned, whining, and jumping on sleeping women.How did Jones start the Stones? How did fame and drugs change him? How did he deteriorate until his bandmates had to kick him out? Nope, don't expect answers. Instead we get about a hundred lingering shots of the swimming pool on Brian's estate -- thank you for that subtle foreshadowing, Mr. Woolley. We had almost forgotten that Jones drowned in the pool.In the end, ""Stoned"" is remarkable more for what it leaves out than for what it contains. Anita, those illegitimate kids, and Jones' musical skills are all sort of pushed to the side so we can see the big bad rock star mess with a country lad. And Woolley NEVER focuses on his relationship with the Stones. It's a shame, because the flashbacks to the Moroccan vacation are the most intense and colourful of the whole movie.Leo Gregory does a fairly good job with Jones' personality (too bad they look totally unalike). But star is Mazur as the dangerous, charismatic Anita; it's a shame the affair is basically dismissed as a longtime S&M; romp. Whishaw and Luke de Woolfson deserve a special shout-out for their portrayals of Richards and Mick Jagger. Neither one has a lot of onscreen time, but they are utterly convincing.""Stoned"" is full of moments that show what the movie could have been, and never was. Instead of a study of a brilliant, manipulative musician, we have a study of how he messed with his gardener.

988244,AS62A5MC52IEH,B000FDE5US,Floyd the Barber,"[2, 5]","Stephen Woolley does a marvellous job of portraying the complex, yet venal child that was Brian Jones.  A truly gifted musician, nevertheless beset by many demons, the movie carefully dissects Jones' progress from troubled teen to Rolling Stones' founder to being pinched out by his addictions.  (And these were more than drugs.)Unlike ""Libertine,"" a pretentious attempt to salvage a worthless subject, Jones is both responsible for and victimized by what happens to him.  He is by turns likable and callous;  a mere child, but also mean abuser of women;  a musical visionary, but a slothful narcissist.  Jones WAS exactly what rock musicians were then:  unhinged and derailed by a conflagration of hedonistic possibilities undreamt of before.  Unlike the odious John Wilmot, who had so many tragic warners, Jones had only enablers who seemed to wish him dead. (Of course, the Stones DID profit from Jones' demise, which came suspiciously closely to his ""resignation"" from the band.)The movie not only holds up the life and death of Jones and the surrounding circumstances, but explores the relationships of people to a troubled, but gifted person.  It pulls no punches and makes no apologies.  Brian is but turns brilliant and brutish, creative and creepy, exhilarating and exasperating.  (It would be no surprise if he was in fact murdered because he seemed to delight in torturing people.)  But what the movie shows so well are that such interactions are very common:  Jones was really just one of the lads after all.  What effects such a person - not just a rock star - can have on others are nicely explored, albeit depressingly.  (There is never any doubt where such a person is headed, although, unlike Wilmot, you do not want Jones to die.)  Brian is what we might like to be for all its wealth, fame and hedonistic possibilities, but, for which, as in all tragedies, a price must be paid.""Stoned"" leaves us asking important questions, just not about Brian Jones or the Stones (who come off surprisingly badly in this), but about ourselves.  And that is the mark of a very good movie.Four stars because of some undervalued productions qualities and the fact that the other Stones are played so reverently.  Their characterizations, wooden and inhuman - hardly talking actually - stand in sharp contrast to the other vivid, powerful acting.  (BTW, the Stones ARE undermined and revealed by the ginger script.  They must be REALLY bad people.)  Very good performances from the principals.

988245,A2T892MU5MMNPA,B000FDE5US,"jbn 63 ""jbn63""","[4, 7]","Stoned was allegedly some twelve years in the making, and it shows.  On the one hand, in the wonderful attention to detail and the sense of real dedication that went into this film, and on the other in a slight tendency to overcook:  the film has at least three endings, and you get the idea that the makers just couldn't bear to part with their baby without putting them all in -- a more laissez faire approach might have made it an easier film for the casual viewer.But so be it, who's complaining about a movie made with blood sweat and tears, teeming with encyclopedic knowledge of the sixties and stuffed with twelve years of serious research into the mythic Brian Jones and his milieu?This film is basically two things.  First, a magnificent and meticulously researched recreation of a small but significant slice of the sixties, and second, a huis clos murder story.The first it does tremendously well.  Jones is first introduced in an American flag shirt and boots, and photos exist of him at Cotchford Farm, the setting for most of the movie, in exactly this dress.  All the make-up, hairstyles, costumes, even use of period film stock are excellent.  Moreover, Leo Gregory does a fantastic job with Jones, and the other actors do very well with the other Rolling Stones and the rest of the entourage, a lot of work going into voices and mannerisms.  Some may disagree here, but it has to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult than recreating some of the most photographed and charismatic characters on the planet, especially those who are still alive.The murder story is both the more interesting and more challenging aspect of the film.  First, it should be said that the filmmakers deserve a lot of credit for bringing the story to the surface in the first place.  It was they who tracked down the two women who dragged Jones from the pool and got them talking after all these years.  They pull together all the evidence and (sometimes conflicting) versions of events and lay out what looks like the most plausible explanation of what really happened.  In a nutshell, this is that Frank Thorogood, a builder just that morning let go by Jones and frustrated by, among other things, a failure to be paid, either lost his temper while alone in the pool with Jones and held him under too long by accident, or, (which would explain why the younger builders were said to have been on the scene by some other witnesses) there was a premeditated intention to teach Jones a lesson and put some pressure on to get paid, probably by menacing him, which likewise got out of hand.It's very well done, it doesn't play fast and loose with the facts and testimony such as they are, it's moving and it captures not only the detail but the spirit of the sixties (although I did wonder about the long/curly haired builder, who has something strangely contemporary about him).  At one point in the director's voiceover it is regretted that they didn't have the budget to recreate the King's Road in all its 60s glory, but frankly, it's good that they didn't, it would only detract.  If you get the earrings and glasses and cars right, you don't need an Austin Powers extravaganza.There is just one weakness, and it's quite a big one.  Paddy Consadine playing Thorogood seems like a good actor rather miscast.  There isn't much readily available about Thorogood, so for all I know it's an accurate portrayal, although we do know he was a Second World War veteran and there is a Sunday Times article which describes him as a ""tall, muscular man"".  Anyway, from a dramatic point of view, you never really believe that this Thorogood has the pent up anger in him that would allow him to even get into a push-fight with Jones, let alone hold him under.  This man is a sloucher rather than a soldier.  He looks apathetic and disengaged throughout, and not only does the alleged murder or manslaughter therefore seem far less credible, but the clash of cultures between Jones, the exemplar of the new generation and Thorogood, the old guard type threatened, disgusted and painfully jealous of the new style, gets misplaced.  And this, about which the director has very eloquently spoken, ought really to be at the heart of the film, resplendent in its symbolism.  It occurred to me that swapping roles with Ralph Brown (the white guy in the Fez in Morocco) might have worked better.I have to say I love this film, I watched it twice in two days and I am so glad it got made.

988246,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FDE5US,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","I'm not really into rock music but I am into biopic films. Woolley has produced some amazing British films over the past two decades, so it's not surprising that he finally turns to directing. But despite some strong acting and a groovy 60s vibe, the film is a mess. ""Stoned"" concentrates on the last weeks in the life of ""Stones""- founder Brian Jones (Leo Gregory), whereby earlier developments are integrated again and again in flash backs. By alcohol and drug craze incapably become to co-operate further as a guitarist with its volumes Brian spends most time partitioned from the external world as well as his Swedish girlfriend Anna Wohlin (Tuva Novotny) in its country house. In order to hold it there under control, route manager Tom Keylock (David Morrisey) sends a friendly building contractor (Paddy Considine) to Brian, in order to implement some work on the house and on his favorite, who loses itself ever more in psychedelischen intoxications and eroticism excesses to watch out. But franc is so fascinated by Brains unusual personality and its out-curving life-style that it in-increases ever more into a mixture from admiration and jealousy. When Brian a further Psycho spiel with its guest floats, it comes to the disaster...At least I think that's the plot. Although the film does offer some interesting insight on the mystery of Brian's death, it takes 84 minutes before it even lets on that there IS a mystery. Given the framing structure of the film, I was led to believe that the flashback story was going to explain the psychological descent of the principal that led him to an excessive lifestyle, hence death style. You know, your basic ""drugs suck"" movie. Turns out it has a completely different story to tell, but takes a very long time to get to it. Too long, in my opinion, and too little energy is expended on the way. The scenes are beautiful to look at, and often dramatically strong, but without an overriding through-line, they feel like unrelated short films featuring the same cast.Even though the cast is interesting to look at, only Considine has a proper character to work with; Frank's an intriguing bundle of hopes and insecurities, plus elusive dark demons. This is really his story, not Brian's. And while Gregory has some excellent moments, he struggles to emerge from the drugged-out wooziness, especially with those cheap-looking wigs. Of the remaining cast, only Mazur and Morrissey get interesting roles, although we never know much about them. The rest barely register at all.  As a director, Woolley has some nice touches in capturing the raw eccentricity of a rock star lifestyle. But he's obviously limited by copyright issues from including any Stones music or focusing on the band's own story. Not to mention the relentless homophobia and a series of weak epilogues.The story unfolds the shocking set of events that led to Jones' premature death at 27. So he joins the league of legends - Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain - who broke on through to the other side at the same age. His story differs in that he didn't self-destruct; though some would argue, after seeing ""Stoned,"" that he chose the water he was in - but not whether to sink or swim.",3,A mildly entertaining biopic that couldn't stay a float,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,3211,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'rock', 'music', 'am', 'biopic', 'films', 'Woolley', 'produced', 'amazing', 'British', 'films', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'not', 'surprising', 'finally', 'directing', 'strong', 'acting', 'groovy', '60s', 'vibe', 'film', 'mess', 'Stoned', 'concentrates', 'last', 'weeks', 'life', 'Stones', 'founder', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Leo', 'Gregory', 'whereby', 'earlier', 'developments', 'are', 'integrated', 'again', 'again', 'flash', 'backs', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'craze', 'incapably', 'become', 'co-operate', 'further', 'guitarist', 'volumes', 'Brian', 'most', 'time', 'partitioned', 'external', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'Swedish', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'Wohlin', 'Tuva', 'Novotny', 'country', 'house', 'order', 'hold', 'control', 'route', 'manager', 'Tom', 'Keylock', 'David', 'Morrisey', 'friendly', 'building', 'contractor', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Brian', 'order', 'implement', 'work', 'house', 'favorite', 'who', 'ever', 'more', 'psychedelischen', 'intoxications', 'eroticism', 'excesses', 'watch', 'out', 'franc', 'so', 'fascinated', 'Brains', 'unusual', 'personality', 'out-curving', 'life-style', 'ever', 'more', 'mixture', 'admiration', 'jealousy', 'When', 'Brian', 'further', 'Psycho', 'spiel', 'guest', 'floats', 'disaster', 'least', 'think', 'plot', 'film', 'offer', 'interesting', 'insight', 'mystery', 'Brian', 'death', '84', 'minutes', 'even', 'mystery', 'Given', 'framing', 'structure', 'film', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'flashback', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'explain', 'psychological', 'descent', 'principal', 'led', 'excessive', 'lifestyle', 'hence', 'death', 'style', 'know', 'basic', 'drugs', 'suck', 'movie', 'out', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'tell', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'Too', 'long', 'opinion', 'too', 'little', 'energy', 'expended', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'often', 'dramatically', 'strong', 'overriding', 'through-line', 'feel', 'unrelated', 'short', 'films', 'featuring', 'same', 'cast.Even', 'cast', 'interesting', 'look', 'only', 'Considine', 'proper', 'character', 'work', 'Frank', 'intriguing', 'bundle', 'hopes', 'insecurities', 'elusive', 'dark', 'demons', 'really', 'story', 'not', 'Brian', 'Gregory', 'excellent', 'moments', 'emerge', 'drugged-out', 'wooziness', 'especially', 'cheap-looking', 'wigs', 'remaining', 'cast', 'only', 'Mazur', 'Morrissey', 'get', 'interesting', 'roles', 'never', 'know', 'much', 'rest', 'barely', 'register', 'director', 'Woolley', 'nice', 'touches', 'capturing', 'raw', 'eccentricity', 'rock', 'star', 'lifestyle', 'obviously', 'limited', 'copyright', 'issues', 'including', 'Stones', 'music', 'focusing', 'band', 'own', 'story', 'Not', 'mention', 'relentless', 'homophobia', 'series', 'weak', 'epilogues.The', 'story', 'shocking', 'set', 'events', 'led', 'Jones', 'premature', 'death', '27', 'So', 'league', 'legends', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'who', 'broke', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'age', 'story', 'differs', 'did', ""n't"", 'self-destruct', 'would', 'argue', 'seeing', 'Stoned', 'chose', 'water', 'was', 'not', 'sink', 'swim']",N/A

It focuses almost entirely on one unproven theory about the events leading up to his death, while the 27 years of his life leading up to those last weeks get short shrift.If you're interested in Brian Jones, you're probably primarily interested in his connection with the Rolling Stones.  The film skims over this.  Though Jones' relationship with his bandmates was hugely important to his life, we see very little of that connection.  While the movie does explore the love triangle between Jones, Keith Richards, and Anita Pallenberg, other aspects of his relationship with Richards are ignored, and the rest of the Rolling Stones are more props than characters.If you're interested in the musical development of the Rolling Stones, forget it.  There are a few out of context glimpses of the band on stage or in the recording studio, but the movie never addresses the band's shift from blues covers to original rock compositions, or properly examines Jones' changing and declining role in the band as Richards and Jagger come to the fore.In short, there's no real depth or coherent structure to any aspect of Jones' life outside of his relationship with Anita Pallenberg and his death.

If Gregory looks nothing like Jones, at least those behind the scenes got more right than I ever hoped for: the guitars, the clothes, the oddly indefinable difference between attraction and repulsion to a beautiful, passionate, selfish, destructive person.  Personally I don't know if Brian was murdered--I guess it makes a better movie premise than a portrait of a young man who was wasted beyond his years.  I read once that after Brian was fired, he contacted Alexis Korner about joining Free At Last; Alexis declined the offer.  To me that's an important part of assessing Brian's final months.  He had burned his flame--it was over--he was an ex-pop star--a shade.  Sure, if he had formed a band, fans would have flocked to see what music he had to offer except for the fact that he had nothing left to offer.  The film does explore this idea when it shows him desperately snorting white powder after he's been fired from the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Corporation, and it is one of the spots where the film is successful. I know he loved the blues, drugs, beautiful women, great guitars, and one historic house.  If only he had loved himself. It's true that there's so much more to this story, but we may have to wait for Ken Burns to make a series about Jones some day.  I'd probably watch that.A few years back I was driving past Cheltenham and stopped for a few minutes, as countless others have, at Brian's grave.  The guitars, the girlfriends, the drugs all had a different perspective standing at the grave with the understanding that this is where it ended.  I remember him for his contribution to bringing the blues to a new level of consciousness, but I forgot to bring a flower with me that day.

Yes, it is unfortunate that there is not Stones' music in the film.  That would have enhanced the energy.  But, still, the intensity of the times is well portrayed here, and I'm going to buy this disc for my ""Sixties Music"" library of films.I was 9 years old when Brian Jones died.  We were on a family trip to Los Angeles, and I remember his drowning was HUGE news and universally perceived as a monumental tragedy.  Even at 9 I loved the Rolling Stones and I was concerned about the impact Jones' death would have on future of the band.  He may have been ejected from the group, but everyone had hoped and presumed they would reunite.  Lots of people today seem to minimize Brian's influence on the band, but I think he was seminal in numerous respects. His distinctive imprint always has been and always will be on the band.Today, I have a 9 year-old daughter.  I can not think of any single musician or band that has the same degree of significance or influence as did the 1969 Rolling Stones (except perhaps The Beatles or the 2008 Rolling Stones).  Madonna or Sting, or any rapper, could die tomorrow and there would be only a very narrow slice of public reaction.  But the Rolling Stones occupy a very profound place in musical and world history. The swath of admiration is vast, and their legacy is now going on five decades. The Stones have earned REAL respect, they aren't a cabaret act or a pop show.  They are extremely talented musicians who have created the soundtrack for many of our lives.  Even today's teens dig the Rolling Stones.  Theirs is an astonishing story.This movie is clearly worthwhile as it gives us a sense of a vital aspect of that history. The band really has been a trinity, Jagger-Richards-Jones as the nucleus and the soul, and with Wood, Wyman, and Watts and all the rest as valuable collaborators and contributors over the decades. This movie tells us a lot about that missing third of the trinity. I thought all the performances were wonderful, and the imagery and general ambience of the movie is pretty much as I've always envisioned it.",5,Definitely Worthwhile for Any Stones Fan,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2183,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'captivated', 'story', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Yes', 'unfortunate', 'not', 'Stones', 'music', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'energy', 'still', 'intensity', 'times', 'well', 'portrayed', 'here', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'disc', 'Sixties', 'Music', 'library', 'films.I', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'died', 'were', 'family', 'trip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'remember', 'drowning', 'was', 'HUGE', 'news', 'universally', 'perceived', 'monumental', 'tragedy', 'Even', '9', 'loved', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'was', 'concerned', 'impact', 'Jones', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'future', 'band', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'ejected', 'group', 'everyone', 'had', 'hoped', 'presumed', 'would', 'reunite', 'Lots', 'people', 'today', 'seem', 'minimize', 'Brian', 'influence', 'band', 'think', 'was', 'seminal', 'numerous', 'respects', 'distinctive', 'imprint', 'always', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'band.Today', 'have', '9', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'single', 'musician', 'band', 'same', 'degree', 'significance', 'influence', 'did', '1969', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'perhaps', 'Beatles', '2008', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Madonna', 'Sting', 'rapper', 'could', 'die', 'tomorrow', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'very', 'narrow', 'slice', 'public', 'reaction', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'very', 'profound', 'place', 'musical', 'world', 'history', 'swath', 'admiration', 'vast', 'legacy', 'now', 'going', 'five', 'decades', 'Stones', 'have', 'earned', 'REAL', 'respect', 'are', ""n't"", 'cabaret', 'act', 'pop', 'show', 'are', 'extremely', 'talented', 'musicians', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'lives', 'Even', 'today', 'teens', 'dig', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Theirs', 'astonishing', 'story.This', 'movie', 'clearly', 'worthwhile', 'sense', 'vital', 'aspect', 'history', 'band', 'really', 'been', 'trinity', 'Jagger-Richards-Jones', 'nucleus', 'soul', 'Wood', 'Wyman', 'Watts', 'rest', 'valuable', 'collaborators', 'contributors', 'decades', 'movie', 'lot', 'missing', 'third', 'trinity', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'wonderful', 'imagery', 'general', 'ambience', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', ""'ve"", 'always', 'envisioned']",N/A
988259,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FDE5US,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 5]","The death of Brian Jones has been one of the greatest tragedies in the rock history even though such names as Mick, Keith, and Charlie (and Ron if you like) represent the legendary rock band the Rolling Stones today. It is only natural that producer-turned-director Stephen Woolley chose the still controversial topic for his debut film because it still intrigues us as an unsolved mystery surrounding the last days of Brian, and it may also give us the key to understanding the eternally lost genius.However, I was pretty frustrated while watching the `fact-based' bio-pic `Stoned' that gives no answer or plausible interpretations to these questions. Yes, as other reviewers have already said, the film uses what is claimed the death-bed confession of Frank Thorogood, an ordinary builder who is hired by Jones to rebuild his estate. Part of the film's story is based on his words, which supposedly support the theory that Brian Jones was really murdered.I don't write the details here, not because it will spoil your fun; but simply because the events up to the death of Jones are so unconvincing, and sometimes dull, full of clich&eacute; usually seen in countless bio-pics of artists. To call someone's death a murder, you need a motive of the killer. They just failed to produce it in `Stoned.'To make matters worse, `Stoned' does not tell you much about Brian Jones as a human. One reason is the script spends too much time about Frank who is influenced by Brian's wild lifestyle, not Brain himself. Not only that; talking about wild, the film shows many full-frontals, SM-like sex scenes, grainy and psychedelic pictures, and drug-addicted guitarist's self-destructive behaviors, but it does not explain why his girlfriends were so attracted to him, or what kind of the role he played in the group when it was first formed, or when he left it. Probably non-fans of the Rollins Stones would not see Brian as very gifted instrument player, or would not understand the importance of the fact that he is one of the first musicians who introduced the African music into Europe.Actors did a good job, but by good job I do not mean they look like their real counterparts. Leo Gregory is acceptable as Jones, but Monet Mazur is much more effective as Jones's girlfriend, Anita, who captures the essence of the 1960s and the time of free love. As to the other members of the Rolling Stones, all I can say is some of them might look like the real ones seen from a certain angle. And if you watch carefully, and you will find even Ian Stewart (of course, he's an actor). The filmmakers, it is true, did a lot of research, and the soundtrack (though including no Rolling Stones' original recording) is fantastic like that of another rock-related bio-pic `Backbeat.'This is no surprise, for director Stephen Woolley once co-produced `Backbeat.' The theme of Brian Jones is perhaps more appealing to us than the fifth member of the Beatles because it is about an untold story of a genius. But by sticking to the murder theory, the film lost the opportunity to tell it.",2,The Story of Brian Jones: They Paint It Black ...

So I got this movie in hopes that it would go through  some of the band's history and growth, coupled with the life and times of brian jones. I was hoping this movie would be a bit more like ""Backbeat"", the movie about the beatles.  But, this movie concentrated specifically on Brian Jones, with really minimal interplay with the rest of the group.  It took a while to figure out who Kieth and Mick were, and the other band members were not even introduced.  THis film concentrated specifically on the life of brian jones and fantasized about his drug consumption as well as his sexcapades.  Based around the purchase Brian Jones made of ""the house on Pooh corner"" (?A.A. milne's house).  It was centered in the time 3 months prior to his death, with flashbacks to the past. the film was set about Jones's manager hiring a builder, frank thorogood, to do some renovations to this house, and in the process overcharging him (As he had kieth richards).  Over the course, a wierd friendship developed, leading to the highly controversial ending (the Frank Thorogood theory).  Again, this movie did more on concentrating on the drugs and women in Jones's life, and left the rest of the Stones out of it. Much of the movie seemed to be contrived to put in more nudity. Why? I wish they would have utilized the time to show the drama in the band created by this lifestyle, and when it tried, just seemed to little. Next thing you know they fire him and a few minutes later (one month total real life), he's dead.  My favorite line in the movie was when Jones' girlfriend Anita stated the line "" You just can't handle the drugs like Kieth and I can, you do to much to often"".  Yeah, Kieth richards Handling drugs well.  Anita did go on to be a long term relationship with Kieth richards, as well as drug buddy.  For the big stones fans, this movie may make more sense and you can fill in the pieces with the band and what part of the band's career was going on at that time, albums etc, but for anybody else who rents this movie, you will find yourself asking for more about the band itself, where are they at in the Stones timeline. But this movie was meant to be about Brian Jones, and it did acomplish that. I wouldn't bust down the door to see this if you are a not a huge stones fan.  The previews where deceiving though, it seemed to make it look like they would show more of the band story. Wrong.
