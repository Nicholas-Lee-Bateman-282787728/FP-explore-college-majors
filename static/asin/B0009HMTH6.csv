905716,A28S3F43F76HSH,B0009HMTH6,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[2, 2]","Tonight I borrowed Hauntings from the library which was produced by The History Channel. I have recently watched other movies produced by The History Channel and loved them! I think that they're a reputable network that has varied tastes in their documentaries. However, I was disappointed by this specific film. A couple of years ago I watched the Unsolved Mysteries' series on ghosts and completely fell in love! So I had high hopes for this documentary and it fell DRASTICALLY short.The film is broken up into three different ghost stories that are told by those who experienced it. Paranormal specialists are then interviewed about the validity of the accounts. Lastly, scholars and skeptics are interviewed to give the other side of the story. Though this was enlightening, it did not give me the chills that I wanted. I found the stories to be weak and boring (not to mention that EVERY single woman had terrible hair!!). The paranormal professionals are wacky and seem unreliable and out of touch while the skeptics look more put together and reliable. Overall, a disappointment. I think I am going to watch the Unsolved Mystery series on ghosts instead.",2,No scary...,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1161,"['Tonight', 'borrowed', 'Hauntings', 'library', 'was', 'produced', 'History', 'Channel', 'have', 'recently', 'watched', 'other', 'movies', 'produced', 'History', 'Channel', 'loved', 'think', ""'re"", 'reputable', 'network', 'varied', 'tastes', 'documentaries', 'However', 'was', 'disappointed', 'specific', 'film', 'couple', 'years', 'watched', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'series', 'ghosts', 'completely', 'fell', 'love', 'So', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'documentary', 'fell', 'DRASTICALLY', 'short.The', 'film', 'broken', 'up', 'three', 'different', 'ghost', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'who', 'experienced', 'Paranormal', 'specialists', 'are', 'then', 'interviewed', 'validity', 'accounts', 'Lastly', 'scholars', 'skeptics', 'are', 'interviewed', 'give', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'was', 'enlightening', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'chills', 'wanted', 'found', 'stories', 'be', 'weak', 'boring', 'not', 'mention', 'EVERY', 'single', 'woman', 'had', 'terrible', 'hair', 'paranormal', 'professionals', 'are', 'wacky', 'seem', 'unreliable', 'touch', 'skeptics', 'look', 'more', 'put', 'together', 'reliable', 'Overall', 'disappointment', 'think', 'am', 'going', 'watch', 'Unsolved', 'Mystery', 'series', 'ghosts', 'instead']",Unexplained: Hauntings

Something along the line of $9.00 would have been much more reasonable.  Three separate ""hauntings"" are presented.  Details of each are shown, followed by efforts to explain the causes.  There are no extras....only the basic 45 minute program.  Recommend that one wait until this comes to the nearest video rental store or, perhaps, acquire it via Netflix.",3,Overpriced,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,497,"['material', 'presented', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'price', 'DVD', 'much', 'too', 'high', 'length', '45', 'minutes', 'total', 'disc', 'Something', 'line', '9.00', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'reasonable', 'Three', 'separate', 'hauntings', 'are', 'presented', 'Details', 'are', 'shown', 'followed', 'efforts', 'explain', 'causes', 'are', 'extras', '.only', 'basic', '45', 'minute', 'program', 'Recommend', 'one', 'wait', 'nearest', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'perhaps', 'acquire', 'Netflix']",Unexplained: Hauntings

905719,A2PA9ACXDNHFID,B0009HMTH6,Scott M,"[0, 0]","I picked this up cheap in a store - used. I was up late and wanted to start watching it. It actaully started to creep me out - so I shut it off and watched the rest the next day. My main two dissapointments - and why I didn't give 5 Stars - It is only 45 minutes long, 2 hours would have fit this documentary better and the short interviews with some PHd's - and other 'experts'. These people's minds are totally closed. We had a PHd in my family (who is now OUT of my life) - who matches these closed-minded - intellectual idiots very well.Still - for me 4 Stars means I really like this DVD.

905720,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0009HMTH6,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","""Unexplained - Hauntings"" was originally aired on the History channel and runs only about 46 minutes. It takes a unique approach to the paranormal occurrences portrayed in that it presents expert arguments for and against these occurrences. There are three case studies covered here - the first is about the Brown family whose house is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a suicide, an elderly man who hasn't found peace in death. The real-life occupants of the house are featured as is the case in all three stories, and these people truly believe the restless spirit of a previous occupant inhabits the house. At the end of the story, various field experts provide their arguments either in support of or against the haunting.The second story is a haunting in New Brunswick. A family experiences disturbing paranormal events and most horrific of all ,the hauntings continue to follow them as they move homes multiple times. Here too, experts weigh in at the end with their theories as to whether they believe in the hauntings or not.The last story is about a family residing in a log cabin in Colorado - they believe their home is a 'portal' to another world where spirits travel through frequently. Here too various field experts - a parapsychologist, a historian, a psychologist etc provide their opinions as to whether they believe the hauntings are authentic or not.Thuogh I found this show interesting, it wasn't as riveting as some other shows especially the ""A Haunting"" series, and also, the price of the DVD here seems too costly for what you get [I watched mine on Netflix]. Other than that, I feel this would engage those who are interested in the paranormal.",3,A look at paranormal phenomena from both sides of the fence,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1670,"['Unexplained', 'Hauntings', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'History', 'channel', 'only', 'about', '46', 'minutes', 'unique', 'approach', 'paranormal', 'occurrences', 'portrayed', 'expert', 'arguments', 'occurrences', 'are', 'three', 'case', 'studies', 'covered', 'here', 'first', 'Brown', 'family', 'house', 'reputedly', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'suicide', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'found', 'peace', 'death', 'real-life', 'occupants', 'house', 'are', 'featured', 'case', 'three', 'stories', 'people', 'truly', 'believe', 'restless', 'spirit', 'previous', 'occupant', 'house', 'end', 'story', 'various', 'field', 'experts', 'provide', 'arguments', 'support', 'haunting.The', 'second', 'story', 'haunting', 'New', 'Brunswick', 'A', 'family', 'experiences', 'disturbing', 'paranormal', 'events', 'most', 'horrific', 'hauntings', 'continue', 'follow', 'move', 'homes', 'multiple', 'times', 'Here', 'too', 'experts', 'weigh', 'end', 'theories', 'believe', 'hauntings', 'not.The', 'last', 'story', 'family', 'residing', 'log', 'cabin', 'Colorado', 'believe', 'home', ""'portal"", 'world', 'where', 'spirits', 'travel', 'frequently', 'Here', 'too', 'various', 'field', 'experts', 'parapsychologist', 'historian', 'psychologist', 'etc', 'provide', 'opinions', 'believe', 'hauntings', 'are', 'authentic', 'not.Thuogh', 'found', 'show', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'riveting', 'other', 'shows', 'especially', 'Haunting', 'series', 'also', 'price', 'DVD', 'here', 'too', 'costly', 'what', 'get', '[', 'watched', 'mine', 'Netflix', ']', 'Other', 'feel', 'would', 'engage', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'paranormal']",Unexplained: Hauntings
