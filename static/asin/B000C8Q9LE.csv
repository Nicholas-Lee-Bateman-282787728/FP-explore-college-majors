955604,A3LKCTONDQHR4,B000C8Q9LE,Brain Andersen,"[0, 0]",Arrived in excellent condition as I have purchased at least a couple of hundred movie only that arrived with DVD loose in the case which I think delivery carrier to rough with package. The science that it is based on is interesting to me as it was in an original fashion of presentation.  Acting was okay a little wooden in a couple scenes  but otherwise well done. I would recommend this movie  to purchase and frequently watch it. I also think it would make good addition to a personal collection as I have added it to mine.,5,Very enteresting premis for disaster,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,526,"['Arrived', 'excellent', 'condition', 'have', 'purchased', 'least', 'couple', 'hundred', 'movie', 'only', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'loose', 'case', 'think', 'delivery', 'carrier', 'rough', 'package', 'science', 'based', 'interesting', 'was', 'original', 'fashion', 'presentation', 'Acting', 'was', 'okay', 'little', 'wooden', 'couple', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'well', 'done', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'purchase', 'frequently', 'watch', 'also', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'addition', 'personal', 'collection', 'have', 'added', 'mine']",N/A

If you like the typical scifi tv movies you will like this one since it seems to go along with how scifi does it movies. Was very predictable. Could have been a lot better. Just very poorly done. I gave 2.50 for it. So i guess I really can't complain much.,2,Not really a disaster movie,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,340,"['movie', 'disappointment', 'when', 'disasters', 'Nothing', 'really', 'like', 'typical', 'scifi', 'tv', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'go', 'along', 'how', 'scifi', 'movies', 'Was', 'very', 'predictable', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'Just', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'gave', '2.50', 'So', 'i', 'guess', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'much']",N/A

Much better, known actors mixed with a good budget and special effects makes this one a great one to watch.

955607,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000C8Q9LE,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","This 1995 made for TV film fails to give the viewer what one expects in a disaster film:  lots of disastrous events!  While a hole in the ozone layer threatening LA is something to fear, the movie doesn't capitalize on it enough to satisfy this viewer.  Aside from a bunch of birds crashing into a window, a horde of bees swarming downtown, and thousands of bugs in a small house, there isn't a whole lot of excitement in this movie.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE's John Corbett stars as Dr. Evan Thorne, a rogue scientist who predicts the ozone hole will cover the skies of LA and bring about ecological destruction; Tom Irwin is his former boss, Dr. Schiffrin, who laughs at Thorne's theory and refuses to back up his story; Josie Bissett is Thorne's sister who also works for the mayor who wants Schiffrin to confirm the speculation; Ben Browder is the sturdy pilot who is also engaged to Bissett; Bradley Whitford is the gungho reporter who follows the story.It's all been done so much better.
