I did late last nite, planning to watch only the opening credits for the music. But I got so caught up that I sat thru the entire thing.Filmed in that boundary between the eras of censorship and openness, this film seems at times to walk on eggshells. While the prostitutes aren't glamourized as they are in, say, PRETTY WOMAN, they are childish and harmless (in fact, many of the Chinese come across as child-like). Plus, there are some melodramatic moments which seem to be a bid for sympathy (eg, Gwennie's letter and the mysterious reason behind Suzie's disappearances). This is only enhanced by the man's implausible virtuousness ('if he can feel that way about them, so should we').Still, the film manages some degree of honesty. And the location shooting is alive with color and alienness, including some authentic Hong Kong and British accents (altho, the too-careful substitution of ""Law-bet"" for ""Robert"" by the Chinese actors comes across as fake).Making the most of the story are the actors. Holden is well cast, as are the British and Chinese supporting players. But, I wonder how watchable this movie would have been without Nancy Kwan in the title role. While she clearly has limits in her acting range (she was a trained dancer, not actor), she was a force of nature as well as a sublime beauty.

The one thing that causes this film to stand out today is the stark differences of the Hong Kong of 1960 and today. I do think William Holden may have been miscast in his role.

Scene takes place in the poorestpart of Hong Kong where Nancy Kwan is a prostitute and William Holden is on leave from his job in the states as a architect wantingto become an artist in Hong Kong China. He meets Nancy Kwan on a ferry in Hong Kong and she is pretending to be a aristocristicperson of some importance which she does throughout the movie (she has a terrible self-esteem problem) and William Holdenhas a tight budget to live off of and rents a room for a month in a brothel hotel where he once again meets Suzie Wong. The Hotelis loaded with U.S. Miltary Sailors, whom seem to be very familiar with Suzie Wong along with all of the other girls who are prostitutesas well. Suzie Wong is uneducated, no family, has a child whom no one seems to know about, except the elderly lady who takes careof her baby. Meanwhile, William Holden, hires Suzie Wong, as a model and paints many pictures of her. Eventually they fail inloveand William Holden cannot handle her life as a prostitute. This is a tender love story altho you will have to see the movie as opposeto someone telling you about it. It is very, very sad that as human beings we have to pretend to be something we are not in order tobe accepted in Society. The description that I have given about this movie does not sound very tasteful, but, what is more importantbeing loved and accepted for who and what you are or as we often do in this country try to become all that we can in order to become accepted.

One is when she says ""you my first man"" and at the end when she says ""I be with you till you say Susie go away"".  William Holden has never been better. Completely believable in this role. Nancy Kwan is a perfect fit and is just beautiful.  I have it on VHS and would love to have a restored DVD as the scenery of Hong Kong is so wonderful.  I just don't know if the DVD is actually restored or remastered. I was in Hong Kong a few years ago and we did a tour of the harbour. Not the same now as it was then but still very colorful. I thought it was so typical of a man that even though he has little money he takes her to a fancy restaurant for dinner where she is terribly uncomfortable just so he can show off to her.

246753,A3BO21YK08SSV8,6301216121,John M Walker,"[14, 18]","Today there are many ""chick flicks,"" but The World of Suzie Wong is a ""romance for guys.""There are two parallel themes in this film: 1) the ""Pygmalion"" theme, and 2) the enchantment of the East.  The Pygmalion theme (which includes Cinderella, My Fair Lady, and Pretty Woman) was old when George Bernard Shaw's play by this name first appeared in 1913. Pygmalion, in classical legend, was the king of Cyprus who fell in love with his own sculpture. Hence the theme of beginning with a raw material (in this case a woman of no great position or education) and to some degree transforming her into she whom you might adore.Theme number two, the enchantment of the East, is magic stuff for those so smitten, which includes your humble correspondent. In this way, this wonderful story (novel and film) is understated. It is barely believable that Lomax's attraction to Suzie would start from nothing and grow so slowly to compelling strength. Lomax must be a man of Quixotic romantic notions or he would not be trying this alternative life style of professional painting. This mixture of desire and fascination is more likely to stormily seize a man's heart, but ""Robert meets Suzie-falls crazy in love-marries Suzie"" would make for a ten-minute film, and that just wouldn't do, would it?Some object to this love theme carrying racist overtones, but in my view the reverse is true. The essence of the message is an absence of racism.  The very fact that in this type of romantic union the protagonists are of unequal social position means that the man is attracted to the woman because of her human qualities, not because of any advantage she can provide to him in terms of social status or wealth. In fact, a man who loves such a woman is often looked down upon socially, which is present in this story. The object of Robert Lomax's love is Suzie Wong for who she is as a woman and how she makes him feel, and he gladly, even cynically disregards the disparagements of those who do not approve.It's also an interesting commentary on the film makers of this approximate vintage that when they wanted to tell the story of interracial romance they often seemed to think they had to attenuate the effect. Both Nancy Kwan and France Nguyen (in South Pacific), for example, were of mixed parentage, (but the female Asian love interests in The Sand Pebbles and Sayonara were not). And Jennifer Jones, while an Academy Award winning best actress, is from Tulsa, Oklahoma; Love Is A Many Splendored Thing really needed a genuine ""Eurasian."" As an added note, in Sayonara, Ricardo Montalban played the role of a Japanese man -- go figure.Anyway, The World of Suzie Wong is so very romantic, and the themes explored here are enduring. I love the novel -- I love the film. I can't imagine anyone but William Holden playing Lomax (although William Shatner [believe it or not] played the stage role). This role belongs to Bill Holden.",5,"A Romance for guys, not a chick flick",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2917,"['Today', 'are', 'many', 'chick', 'flicks', 'World', 'Suzie', 'Wong', 'romance', 'guys', 'are', 'two', 'parallel', 'themes', 'film', '1', 'Pygmalion', 'theme', '2', 'enchantment', 'East', 'Pygmalion', 'theme', 'Cinderella', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'was', 'old', 'when', 'George', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'play', 'name', 'first', 'appeared', '1913', 'Pygmalion', 'classical', 'legend', 'was', 'king', 'Cyprus', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'own', 'sculpture', 'Hence', 'theme', 'beginning', 'raw', 'material', 'case', 'woman', 'great', 'position', 'education', 'degree', 'transforming', 'whom', 'might', 'adore.Theme', 'number', 'two', 'enchantment', 'East', 'magic', 'stuff', 'so', 'smitten', 'humble', 'correspondent', 'way', 'wonderful', 'story', 'novel', 'film', 'understated', 'barely', 'believable', 'Lomax', 'attraction', 'Suzie', 'would', 'start', 'nothing', 'grow', 'so', 'slowly', 'compelling', 'strength', 'Lomax', 'must', 'be', 'man', 'Quixotic', 'romantic', 'notions', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'trying', 'alternative', 'life', 'style', 'professional', 'painting', 'mixture', 'desire', 'fascination', 'more', 'likely', 'stormily', 'seize', 'man', 'heart', 'Robert', 'Suzie-falls', 'crazy', 'love-marries', 'Suzie', 'would', 'make', 'ten-minute', 'film', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'would', 'object', 'love', 'theme', 'carrying', 'racist', 'overtones', 'view', 'reverse', 'true', 'essence', 'message', 'absence', 'racism', 'very', 'fact', 'type', 'romantic', 'union', 'protagonists', 'are', 'unequal', 'social', 'position', 'man', 'attracted', 'woman', 'human', 'qualities', 'not', 'advantage', 'can', 'provide', 'terms', 'social', 'status', 'wealth', 'fact', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'often', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'socially', 'present', 'story', 'object', 'Robert', 'Lomax', 'love', 'Suzie', 'Wong', 'who', 'woman', 'how', 'feel', 'gladly', 'even', 'cynically', 'disparagements', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'approve.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'film', 'makers', 'approximate', 'vintage', 'when', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'interracial', 'romance', 'often', 'seemed', 'think', 'had', 'attenuate', 'effect', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'France', 'Nguyen', 'South', 'Pacific', 'example', 'were', 'mixed', 'parentage', 'female', 'Asian', 'love', 'interests', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Sayonara', 'were', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'best', 'actress', 'Tulsa', 'Oklahoma', 'Love', 'A', 'Many', 'Splendored', 'Thing', 'really', 'needed', 'genuine', 'Eurasian', 'added', 'note', 'Sayonara', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'played', 'role', 'Japanese', 'man', 'go', 'figure.Anyway', 'World', 'Suzie', 'Wong', 'so', 'very', 'romantic', 'themes', 'explored', 'here', 'are', 'enduring', 'love', 'novel', 'love', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'William', 'Holden', 'playing', 'Lomax', 'William', 'Shatner', '[', 'believe', 'not', ']', 'played', 'stage', 'role', 'role', 'Bill', 'Holden']",The World of Suzie Wong VHS

And it does so by exposing the innermost souls of those two people and exposing the condescending, racial commentary of other westerners living in Hong Kong toward the Chinese.

A man and woman see each other, not by the color of their skin, nor by their socio-economic status, but as two people, who love and care for each other; of course, not without its struggles. I have seen this movie many, many, times, and I will view it again.American architect Robert Lomax is an aspiring artist who relocates to Hong Kong for a year to see if he can make a living as a painter. On the Star Ferry en route to Hong Kong Island, he meets Mee Ling, a seemingly proper young woman of lofty social status.  Soon after, Robert seeks inexpensive rooming and crosses paths with Mee Ling, this time at the infamous Wan Chai district.  The rent is the right price, and only after astounding the proprietor by pre-paying the room for an entire month, does he discover what this place is, and the true identity of Mee Ling.  Mee Ling becomes his model for his art work, and he learns that her profession was forced upon her for survival, not choice, lending an understanding to all of the film's viewer's (hopefully) why Mee Ling pretends to be someone else, as her means of coping with life.Robert and Mee Ling fall in love, but not without its travails and misunderstandings, including her many disappearances, which is to care for her secret child.  Like so many love stories, there is a rough part, and they break up, but when Robert realizes his mistake, he searches and finds his ""Susie Wong.""  The sequel to these films, ""The Flower Drum Song"" is well worth watching as well!There are many interpretations of the dynamics of this movie:  How Caucasians looked ""down"" upon Asian women, viewing them as prostitutes....Of sleazy men wanting to get something on the side, using such women, women who often were thrown into a life of prostitution merely to survive.  These are all true....but in all of this, there is also Robert Lomax and Mee Ling that are above these disgusting people.

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[101, 107]","'The World Of Suzie Wong' the romanticized story of a Hong Kong prostitute and an American artist is for some, a simplistic racist view of Chinese, for others, a guilty pleasure. Yes, it is both of those things but it is even more. It is a fine and tender love story of two people from very different worlds who overcome pride and prejudice and embark upon a true human experience. Forty four years after its release this film along with 'Flower Drum Song' are being re-evaluated and embraced by the Chinese American community.  Why? Because beneath the surface of each film they share the common job of telling the story of their time and place with honesty and true humanity and in the case of Suzie Wong, the story is not such a happy one.At first we are presented in `Suzie Wong' a stereotypical view of happy little hookers in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong. But as the story unfolds the veneer of this portrait cracks open to reveal through Suzie just how desperate the lives of these women are.  In a city of over three million crammed onto the island city it is a case of do what you must to survive. In Suzie's case she must compartmentalize her feeling into body, love, and soul and thus protect herself by pretending that she is the daughter of a rich merchant rather than a Wan Chai bargirl.  Though her relationship with Robert they both learn the meaning and cost of love in a world of narrow view and prejudice.The film is very adult and honest in dealing with the subject of the flesh trade and racism in 1960 must have been a bit shocking on several levels. This film must be credited with opening the door to telling more honest stories of Asian's with Asian actors in the major roles. After all, not too many years before we had Jennifer Jones playing a Eurasian in 'Love Is A Many Splendored Thing'. She did a fine job, but still she was miscast.  Here we have Nancy Kwan creating a memorable character, as it should be, by someone of Asian descent.Nancy Kwan is luminous in the role of Suzie. This was a star making turn for her and led to other good roles over the years. She is sexy, with a street-smart veneer that covers her open and trusting heart.  She rises to the many emotional challenges of Suzie and succeeds in carrying the viewer through the film as only an accomplished actress can. The camera falls in love with her, as does the reluctant Robert.William Holden is perfectly cast as the ""pushing forty"" American who has come to Hong Kong to pursue his dream of being an artist. He is a pro who give the role just the feeling of wonder and discovery it needs blended with a certain worldliness that it requires. Together, Kwan and Holden are an intoxicatingly romantic couple that share a chemistry on screen most films of this genre aspire to but few achieve.The supporting cast is filled out by standouts such as Jacqui Chan as Gwennie Lee, Andy Ho as Ah Tong, Michael Wilding as Ben Marlow and Sylvia Simms as Suzie's rival, Kay O'Neill.Geoffrey Unsworth also known for his work on 'Becket', '2001 A Space Odyssey' and 'Cabaret' stunningly photographed Hong Kong for the film. His use of light and color is unsurpassed in capturing the long gone look of the city in 1960. The art direction of John Box is superb.

Refreshingly unlike many other Hollywood hooker sagas -- the kind where Elizabeth Taylor's paid cash to model gowns, or Audrey Hepburn gets $50 for the powder room -- Nancy Kwan seems to know she's playing a whore in Wong.When penniless artist William Holden, who lives atop a sleazy Hong Kong brothel, spies Kwan in the building's pick-up bar, we're told she is the ""most popular girl -- got sex appeal!"" And how: her hot-cha dance routine still registers, decades after the fact, on the Bad Movie Bump 'n' Grind Allure-O-Meter. Holden asks Kwan to his room, but when he says, ""Can't pay much, but I'd like you to pose for me,"" she replies, ""Just sit? No, I lose face. My girlfriends will say, 'You go to gentleman's room and sit? You're slipping!'"" Since there's no story unless she changes her mind, Kwan instantly reconsiders, asking hopefully, ""Take clothes off?"" Curbing his artistic impulses for a moment, Holden takes Kwan off to dinner, during which the spunky prostitute admits hooking is ""dirty,"" but insists, ""I not dirty street girl. Inside, I still good."" To demonstrate this, she offers herself up as dessert--for free. When Holden rejects her, she starts picking up men out in the street. As she chirps, ""Hi, sailor!"" over and over with irresistable neediness in her voice, we can only wonder: How long will it take before Holden falls?Quite a while, thanks to Kwan's trampy behavior. When Holden decks a gob who's called Kwan (accurately) ""a filthy little slut,"" she asks him, ""Do me a favor--let me tell my girlfriends you beat me up."" (He refuses, but Kwan does so anyway, eliciting this from another whore: ""You're very lucky!"") However, when Kwan starts a catfight because she thinks that Holden is flirting with another vixen, she's gone too far. ""I came her to paint,"" Holden snarls at her. ""I can't have you giving me your love on the days that you're free."" Conveniently, fellow tramp-hound Michael Wilding barges in with news he's split with his wife and wants to make Kwan his ""permanent girlfriend."" Kwan gives him the old ""I not dirty street girl"" line, adding, ""If I your regular girlfriend, I never go with another man."" And off she goes with him.Respectable English art expert Sylvia Syms (this crazy film's craziest character, inasmuch as she views Holden as marriage material) starts posing for paintings in Kwan's stead -- at least til Kwan returns to show off her kept-woman wardrobe. ""Take that terrible dress off,"" Holden hollers. ""You look like a cheap European streetwalker."" (Helpfully, he rips the clothes off her -- in the name of the fashion police, mind you, not because he wants her looking like a cheap Eurasian streetwalker.After Wilding's estranged wife samples what he's been learning in Kwan's bed, she wants him back pronto. Holden agrees to break this bad news, and when he does, hang on for Kwan's full meltdown -- a bizarre identity-crisis split that leads, as such things often do, to a happy ending. Suddenly taking on the personality of a demure virgin, Kwan once again cries, ""I not dirty street girl!"" and then says, ""I want to be like nice English girl for you. I go now."" She exits Holden's room, then bounds right back in, announcing, ""It's now tomorrow. You my first man. You believe?"" Strange? Yep, but not as strange as Holden's reply: ""I believe.

246781,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6301216121,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 8]","""The World of Suzie Wong"" would probably be made today with graphic sex, violence and more than a glimpse into the seedy side of prostitution. As it is we get this tale of an American artist (William Holden) who meets a Chinese prostitute (Kwan in her debut) on a Ferry with just the right of modesty and the focus on the characters. She proceeds to steal his heart and not his wallet. She tries to have him arrested when he returns her purse accusing him of stealing it. Set in Hong Kong during the 60's, we see a world long since past in a time when innocence still dominated most of the films made by Hollywood. This is by no means a toothless tale but one that lacks a sense of the reality that we would get today. In a sense, that's good because it allows the film to communicate the emotional distance and anguish of the characters. On the other hand, it also makes it might make it difficult for contemporary audiences to connect with the film. Regardless, it's a very good movie with strong performances from William Holden and Nancy Kwan (in her film debut).The transfer looks a bit grainy and gritty not at all as sharp as some of the older films that Paramount has released to DVD recently. The colors have faded a bit as well although it's unlikely that this film will get the attention or restoration it needs to recapture its former luster. There's the typical analog scars we might expect from a film that's been displayed, beaten up and bruised for such a long, long time but, on the whole, they are minimal. The mono sound is pretty good although flat at times without the any depth.This budget priced DVD has no extras although the film is presented in its original aspect ratio (i.e., widescreen) for the first time in a long, long time. It's a pity as Nancy Kwan is alive and well and probably could have provided an interesting commentary track. Additionally, a documentary looking at the making of a movie with a controversial theme might have benefited the DVD as well.Over all, ""World"" looks pretty decent although not quite as sharp, colorful or vivid as it could be. The presentation is fairly pedestrian and uninspired which is sad considering that this is a film classic.",5,Classic drama finally available on DVD,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2199,"['World', 'Suzie', 'Wong', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'more', 'glimpse', 'seedy', 'side', 'prostitution', 'get', 'tale', 'American', 'artist', 'William', 'Holden', 'who', 'Chinese', 'prostitute', 'Kwan', 'debut', 'Ferry', 'just', 'right', 'modesty', 'focus', 'characters', 'steal', 'heart', 'not', 'wallet', 'have', 'arrested', 'when', 'purse', 'accusing', 'stealing', 'Set', 'Hong', 'Kong', '60', 'see', 'world', 'long', 'past', 'time', 'when', 'innocence', 'still', 'dominated', 'most', 'films', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'toothless', 'tale', 'one', 'sense', 'reality', 'would', 'get', 'today', 'sense', 'good', 'film', 'communicate', 'emotional', 'distance', 'anguish', 'characters', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'might', 'make', 'difficult', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'connect', 'film', 'Regardless', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'William', 'Holden', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'film', 'debut', 'transfer', 'bit', 'grainy', 'gritty', 'not', 'all', 'as', 'sharp', 'older', 'films', 'Paramount', 'released', 'DVD', 'recently', 'colors', 'have', 'faded', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'unlikely', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'restoration', 'recapture', 'former', 'luster', 'typical', 'analog', 'scars', 'might', 'expect', 'film', 'been', 'displayed', 'beaten', 'up', 'bruised', 'such', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'whole', 'are', 'minimal', 'mono', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'flat', 'times', 'depth.This', 'budget', 'priced', 'DVD', 'extras', 'film', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'i.e.', 'widescreen', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'pity', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'alive', 'well', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'Additionally', 'documentary', 'looking', 'making', 'movie', 'controversial', 'theme', 'might', 'have', 'benefited', 'DVD', 'well.Over', 'World', 'pretty', 'decent', 'not', 'quite', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'vivid', 'could', 'be', 'presentation', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'uninspired', 'sad', 'considering', 'film', 'classic']",The World of Suzie Wong VHS
