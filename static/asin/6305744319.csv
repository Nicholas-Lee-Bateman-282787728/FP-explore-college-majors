It is full of great performances Alexis Arquette has never been better. Scott Leet is perfect as Ray Frye The Convict who gets a second chance at life after spending seven years in the joint for Manslaughter . Now out of jail and back on the street Ray is looking to redeem himself somehow, while being endlessly hounded By Two cops (Mickey Rourke,Peter Green). Ray hooks up with Arquette who gives him a job and a place to live.

I hadn't seen it before and after purchasing this I saw on the back cover that actor Bojesse Christopher directed it, who I like a lot from many 80's films, he's pretty cool. Looking at the cover I thought that it would probably be just OK, nothing special like so many other films I've seen in my life time.But this was not the case. Though the feel of it is low budget, it is pretty good. I thought it has a lotta heart about it.Scott Leet to me was pretty incredable. Leet and his love interest was really interesting.

475320,A3K5IMGDCDBCNF,6305744319,"""lecorel@hotmail.com""","[6, 8]","Out in Fifty is a low budget straight to video flick. So what? It does the trick. Boy meets girl in bar; boy accidentally kills girl; boy goes to prision; prision cures boy's ills; girl had husband who is rouge cop and wants revenge when he gets out. Typical plot, sure, but this film has redeeming qualities. The cast is decent and provides some good moments. And some of the cinematography is inspired. And, okay, it's dumb, but good dumb.So basically we are talking about a typical genre film with a few good scenes, and some nifty shots, and it's dumb. I'm not convincing myself to see this movie. But there is a good reason. Why see Out in Fifty? Two words: Mickey Rourke. I won't call it a comeback, but how about a start. Mickey Rourke is an actor. He is so intense, so tortured, he really ruins the rest of the film because no one else can keep pace. Every time he is not in the scene you wish he was. Forget all the stuff he did for the last couple of years and give him another chance. He deserves it. And if we don't, he'll never be in anything else but more Out in Fiftys. He is better than this film.

475321,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6305744319,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","OUT IN FIFTY is a ""noirish"" type film written produced and directed by its two leading actors:  Scott Leet and BoJesse Christopher.  Their film is commendable because they don't follow many of the cliches of this genre.  Leet instills his role of Ray Frye with a quiet passion, and although he'll never win any Oscars, his laid back portrayal almost saves the movie.  Unfortunately, Mickey Rourke, the King of Movie Sleaze, portrays a cop that no police department should ever employ.  He is ruthless, vindictive, judgmental, an alcoholic and drug addict, and he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Bojesse meanwhile has a manic Jim Carrey freneticism that works well for a while in his role as Ray's ""savior.""  However, the subplot with him and his seductive sister-in-law comes out of nowhere, and his wife's involvement (Nina Ofenbock) seems pretty far-fetched.  The film ""boasts"" cameos from Christina Applegate (who has two brief scenes), Balthazar Getty (maybe two minutes) and Alexis Arquette (maybe 30 seconds in a stupid drag role).  The ending is a real downer and it proves the old adage, ""Bad guys win every once in a while.""  Although slow paced, the movie isn't boring, just soulless.",2,BAD GUYS WIN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,1202,"['IN', 'FIFTY', 'noirish', 'type', 'film', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'Scott', 'Leet', 'BoJesse', 'Christopher', 'film', 'commendable', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'many', 'cliches', 'genre', 'Leet', 'role', 'Ray', 'Frye', 'quiet', 'passion', ""'ll"", 'never', 'win', 'Oscars', 'laid', 'back', 'portrayal', 'almost', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'King', 'Movie', 'Sleaze', 'cop', 'police', 'department', 'should', 'ever', 'employ', 'ruthless', 'vindictive', 'judgmental', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'Bojesse', 'meanwhile', 'manic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'freneticism', 'well', 'while', 'role', 'Ray', 'savior', 'However', 'subplot', 'seductive', 'sister-in-law', 'nowhere', 'wife', 'involvement', 'Nina', 'Ofenbock', 'pretty', 'far-fetched', 'film', 'boasts', 'cameos', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'who', 'two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'maybe', 'two', 'minutes', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'maybe', '30', 'seconds', 'stupid', 'drag', 'role', 'ending', 'real', 'downer', 'old', 'adage', 'Bad', 'guys', 'win', 'once', 'while', 'slow', 'paced', 'movie', ""n't"", 'boring', 'just', 'soulless']",Out in Fifty VHS
