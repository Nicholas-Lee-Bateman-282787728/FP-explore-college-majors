I have no idea why they put a horrible picture that is not from the movie on the cover of the DVD, what a waste when the film is full of beautiful images.  I didn't buy this DVD for ages, afraid it wouldn't be the right one, I didn't trust the other photos that had been upload.  I should have.  I was so thrilled to have this film added to my DVD collection, finally.This was one of two movies that my dad would rent for my when I was sick and had to stay home from school, the other was The Last Unicorn.  I loved being sick.For those of you who grew up on this movie, I don't need to sell you on how amazing it is, but for those of you who have yet to have the pleasure of experiencing this film, don't hesitate to buy it.  True, it is dated, but it is classic.  I love the later Disney version of the tale with Ariel, but this one will always have a special place in my heart.  It follows the original Hans Christian Anderson story very closely, with only a few alterations that don't alter the tale in the slightest.  I have a read a couple reviews that caution that this film is not appropriate for younger children due to the 'tragedy' at the end.  Yes, most younger children will cry.  Many adults will cry as well.  It is ok for children to see films where everything doesn't turn out picture perfect.  How sad it would be if they never learned how to handle it when life is sad and difficult.  On the contrary, this film should be mandatory for all children.  The lessons about selflessness, true love, sacrifice, and the true meaning and purpose of life in this story are timeless and are in desperate need in a time when most are only willing to do what benefits them.  What a wonderful experience for parent to experience with their child.  You will absolutely treasure this movie, if you are an adult parent, a child, or a simply a lover of wonderful storytelling and mermaids!",5,Ignore the Cover Art,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2026,"['Yes', 'original', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'remember', 'childhood', 'one', 'Marina', 'Fritz', 'evil', 'cat', 'whole', 'thing', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'put', 'horrible', 'picture', 'not', 'movie', 'cover', 'DVD', 'what', 'waste', 'when', 'film', 'full', 'beautiful', 'images', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'ages', 'afraid', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'other', 'photos', 'had', 'been', 'upload', 'should', 'have', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'have', 'film', 'added', 'DVD', 'collection', 'finally.This', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'movies', 'dad', 'would', 'rent', 'when', 'was', 'sick', 'had', 'stay', 'home', 'school', 'other', 'was', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'loved', 'being', 'sick.For', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'sell', 'how', 'amazing', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'have', 'pleasure', 'experiencing', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'True', 'dated', 'classic', 'love', 'later', 'Disney', 'version', 'tale', 'Ariel', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'original', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'story', 'very', 'closely', 'only', 'few', 'alterations', 'do', ""n't"", 'alter', 'tale', 'slightest', 'have', 'read', 'couple', 'reviews', 'caution', 'film', 'not', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'children', 'due', ""'tragedy"", 'end', 'Yes', 'most', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'cry', 'Many', 'adults', 'will', 'cry', 'as', 'well', 'ok', 'children', 'see', 'films', 'where', 'everything', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'picture', 'perfect', 'How', 'sad', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'learned', 'how', 'handle', 'when', 'life', 'sad', 'difficult', 'contrary', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'children', 'lessons', 'selflessness', 'true', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'true', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'life', 'story', 'are', 'timeless', 'are', 'desperate', 'need', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'are', 'only', 'willing', 'do', 'what', 'benefits', 'What', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'parent', 'experience', 'child', 'will', 'absolutely', 'treasure', 'movie', 'are', 'adult', 'parent', 'child', 'simply', 'lover', 'wonderful', 'storytelling', 'mermaids']",The Little Mermaid: Based on Hans Christian Andersen's Classic Tale

One viewing and you'll see just how much it 'inspired' Disney.  Also, don't let the lame cover art fool you.  Why they didn't go with a cell from the animation I'll never know, but this is vintage anime.The story is not cleaned up like so many other fairy tales have been.  She does, indeed, die in this one.  There is mild nudity, as she doesn't wear a top as a mermaid, though no breasts are seen.

676193,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B00005QW6Q,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[12, 29]","Don't let the cover fool you; this film is anything but a sweet kid's film. In fact, while this is a masterpiece of anime drama, I don't think it's very suitable for small children. And no, it's not because of the bra-less mermaids. I'm no prude and couldn't care less about nudity, so long as it's tasteful. It's the traumatic ending and the senseless suffering of the sweet mermaid that get to me. I saw this when I was a small child (despite warnings from my mother and the lady at the video store), and although I loved it at first, the ending disturbed me so much that it gave me nightmares for years afterwards. Even now at 21, I'm not sure I could bear seeing it again. I really can't understand why so many people who love this version are bashing the Disney movie. Sure Disney sugarcoats things, but what's wrong with softening the environment for kids? Can you honestly tell me that you don't let your kids believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy? I also have to admit that I'm a little (okay, very) annoyed by some of the ""my kids love this movie!"" comments. Granted, I loved it too at one point before the damage set in, but now that I know what it is, I can't even fathom a parent who's seen this movie thinking it would be good for children. When a completely innocent young girl is betrayed by the man whom she gave up everything for, she jumps off a ship, dies of a broken heart, and slowly dissolves into foam. Does what I just described sound anything like a children's film? I know that kids need to learn about the real world, but I don't think they need to know all about cruelty and selfishness when they're little. This movie presents both in their worst forms, and I can say from personal experience that kids don't need this sort of scar on their childhood; I carried it for some time, and it's not pleasant. Trust me, kids will be disillusioned soon enough; let them keep their innocence and fairytale endings for now. Keep in mind, I'm not putting down the movie; I just feel compelled to caution parents about its upsetting content, because I don't want kids to be as negatively affected by it as I was. If you're an adult who enjoys a classic and can take a lot of pain, I recommend this film. Just please take care who you share it with.",3,"Parents, beware",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,2270,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'cover', 'fool', 'film', 'anything', 'sweet', 'kid', 'film', 'fact', 'masterpiece', 'anime', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'suitable', 'small', 'children', 'not', 'bra-less', 'mermaids', ""'m"", 'prude', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'nudity', 'so', 'long', 'tasteful', 'traumatic', 'ending', 'senseless', 'suffering', 'sweet', 'mermaid', 'get', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'warnings', 'mother', 'lady', 'video', 'store', 'loved', 'first', 'ending', 'disturbed', 'so', 'much', 'gave', 'years', 'afterwards', 'Even', 'now', '21', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'bear', 'seeing', 'again', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'version', 'are', 'bashing', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Sure', 'Disney', 'sugarcoats', 'things', 'what', 'wrong', 'softening', 'environment', 'kids', 'Can', 'honestly', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'believe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'also', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'little', 'okay', 'very', 'annoyed', 'kids', 'love', 'movie', 'comments', 'Granted', 'loved', 'too', 'one', 'point', 'damage', 'set', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'fathom', 'parent', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'children', 'When', 'completely', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'betrayed', 'man', 'whom', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'ship', 'dies', 'broken', 'heart', 'slowly', 'dissolves', 'foam', 'what', 'just', 'described', 'sound', 'anything', 'children', 'film', 'know', 'kids', 'need', 'learn', 'real', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'know', 'cruelty', 'selfishness', 'when', ""'re"", 'little', 'movie', 'worst', 'forms', 'can', 'say', 'personal', 'experience', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'sort', 'scar', 'childhood', 'carried', 'time', 'not', 'pleasant', 'Trust', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'disillusioned', 'soon', 'enough', 'let', 'keep', 'innocence', 'fairytale', 'endings', 'now', 'Keep', 'mind', ""'m"", 'not', 'putting', 'down', 'movie', 'just', 'feel', 'compelled', 'caution', 'parents', 'upsetting', 'content', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'be', 'negatively', 'affected', 'was', ""'re"", 'adult', 'who', 'classic', 'can', 'take', 'lot', 'pain', 'recommend', 'film', 'Just', 'please', 'take', 'care', 'who', 'share']",The Little Mermaid: Based on Hans Christian Andersen's Classic Tale

This is the 70's anime version that is based more on the original story then the happy Disney version. The mermaid's name is Marina and her dolphin friend is Fritz. It was great to finally find this movie on DVD. However, I had one problem with it. When the movie first came out, there was some nudity, though it was nothing serious. The mermaids are bra-less. However, in this DVD version, some of the movie appears choppy because they have edited out parts of certain scenes. Having watched the movie about 1000 times when I was a kid, I remember certain scenes to be longer. However, they only cut about 5 total minutes out of the movie and it is still the great animated film that I remember.
