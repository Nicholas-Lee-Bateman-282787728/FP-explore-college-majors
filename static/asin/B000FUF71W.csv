996059,A361LE16VBQDP8,B000FUF71W,Robert Bezimienny,"[8, 8]","Made by BBC Films, this has something of the feel of well made television drama.  The story is simple, and quite familiar, but still manages to raise questions as to how a person's decisions are not radically free - perhaps an obvious point, but one that seems to bear repeating, especially given the context, namely, a released convict from an underprivileged background.  For Ricky, starting afresh means rejecting not just his own past misdeeds, but also his friends - and rejecting his friends (whatever there unfixable faults) is not just difficult, it also comes close to being immoral, so Ricky is truly torn.The influence of family is also well presented, and some of the gaps speak as loud as the presences, for instance the lack of a biological father in his life. The social realities are shown matter-of-factly and the film stops well short of being preachy.Curtis, as the twelve year old brother, is a charismatic figure, as is his friend Rio, but some of the other actors struggle to bring their characters to life - at times it's a little bit too obvious that they are 'acting'.  The camerawork, editing, and music all have a suitably 'realistic' English TV aesthetic.Perhaps not a classic, but worth a look.",3,Universal problems.,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1223,"['Made', 'BBC', 'Films', 'something', 'feel', 'well', 'made', 'television', 'drama', 'story', 'simple', 'quite', 'familiar', 'still', 'raise', 'questions', 'how', 'person', 'decisions', 'are', 'not', 'radically', 'free', 'perhaps', 'obvious', 'point', 'one', 'bear', 'repeating', 'especially', 'given', 'context', 'namely', 'released', 'convict', 'underprivileged', 'background', 'Ricky', 'starting', 'afresh', 'means', 'rejecting', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'past', 'misdeeds', 'also', 'friends', 'rejecting', 'friends', 'there', 'unfixable', 'faults', 'not', 'just', 'difficult', 'also', 'close', 'being', 'immoral', 'so', 'Ricky', 'truly', 'torn.The', 'influence', 'family', 'also', 'well', 'presented', 'gaps', 'speak', 'as', 'loud', 'presences', 'instance', 'lack', 'biological', 'father', 'life', 'social', 'realities', 'are', 'shown', 'matter-of-factly', 'film', 'well', 'short', 'being', 'preachy.Curtis', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'friend', 'Rio', 'other', 'actors', 'struggle', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'times', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'are', ""'acting"", 'camerawork', 'editing', 'music', 'have', 'suitably', ""'realistic"", 'English', 'TV', 'aesthetic.Perhaps', 'not', 'classic', 'look']",Bullet Boy
