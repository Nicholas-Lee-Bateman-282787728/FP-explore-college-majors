Doug Henning helped shape my gateway into the world of performing magic over 30 years ago.  This DVD does NOT disappoint.  Might not be the best for people who must have all the original songs, but for me, it was all about the innocence, positive vibes and magic of Doug Henning.

He died far too young, but his mystique is here, with wonderful feats of wizardry.  The book for this Broadway show is bad, but it tries to hold together the episodes between magic acts. The songs by Stephen Schwartz are good, but not always done to the best advantage, and Didi Conn is adorable in this one.

662055,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,B00005KH3G,Jim Jr,"[21, 22]","This film version of a long running Broadway show is fun from start to finish. The illusions are all great. The levitation on the water jets is truly baffling. Even for a person having a knowledge of magic, these illusions are wonderful. The whole cast seems to be having a great time doing the show and it comes across.Doug Henning is a delight as he was in his TV specials, but is given more of a chance to let an audience get to know him in the sort of silly story that surrounds the illusions. Anita Morris doesn't have a lot to do, but is a very sexy &quot;glamorous assistant&quot;. Seeing Mr. Henning and Miss Morris makes a viewer slightly sad since they are no longer with us.Didi Conn is a comic delight as Doug's unappreciated assistant. She has two delightful songs - &quot;Lion Tamer&quot; and &quot;Where Did The Magic Go&quot;.Comparing the musical numbers in this film to those on the original Broadway cast recording, some numbers have been replaced by new ones for this film. While none are &quot;showstoppers&quot; or that you will be humming when the show is over, they do contribute nicely to the over all fun of the piece.There are no &quot;extras&quot; on the DVD and the sound is a bit fuzzy in a few places during the musical numbers, but the whole show is so much fun that these faults can be overlooked.Once a Broadway show has closed, usually they live on only in sound recordings and the memories of those who saw them, so it is great to have a film of this Broadway hit and a lasting memory of Mr. Henning and Miss Morris.",4,Really Magic and Fun,996105600,"07 26, 2001",2001,1552,"['film', 'version', 'long', 'running', 'Broadway', 'show', 'fun', 'start', 'finish', 'illusions', 'are', 'great', 'levitation', 'water', 'jets', 'truly', 'baffling', 'Even', 'person', 'having', 'knowledge', 'magic', 'illusions', 'are', 'wonderful', 'whole', 'cast', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'doing', 'show', 'across.Doug', 'Henning', 'delight', 'was', 'TV', 'specials', 'given', 'more', 'chance', 'let', 'audience', 'get', 'know', 'sort', 'silly', 'story', 'illusions', 'Anita', 'Morris', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'very', 'sexy', 'quot', 'glamorous', 'assistant', 'quot', 'Seeing', 'Mr.', 'Henning', 'Miss', 'Morris', 'viewer', 'slightly', 'sad', 'are', 'longer', 'us.Didi', 'Conn', 'comic', 'delight', 'Doug', 'unappreciated', 'assistant', 'two', 'delightful', 'songs', 'quot', 'Lion', 'Tamer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Where', 'Did', 'Magic', 'Go', 'quot', '.Comparing', 'musical', 'numbers', 'film', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'recording', 'numbers', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'new', 'ones', 'film', 'none', 'are', 'quot', 'showstoppers', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'humming', 'when', 'show', 'over', 'do', 'contribute', 'nicely', 'fun', 'are', 'quot', 'quot', 'DVD', 'sound', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'few', 'places', 'musical', 'numbers', 'whole', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'faults', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked.Once', 'Broadway', 'show', 'closed', 'usually', 'live', 'only', 'sound', 'recordings', 'memories', 'who', 'saw', 'great', 'have', 'film', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'lasting', 'memory', 'Mr.', 'Henning', 'Miss', 'Morris']",The Magic Show with Doug Henning

Although I had not seen the original production, I know the score well and have performed several of the songs in cabaret and couldn't wait to see the entire production. I know the chances of ever seeing/doing this in community theatre are slight at best. Apparently, I still haven't seen it. The biggest dissappointment is the omission of &quot;Goldfarb Variations&quot;, &quot;Solid Silver Platform Shoes&quot; and (in the &quot;what were they THINKING?&quot; category), &quot;West End Avenue&quot;. It was, however, delightful to see Doug Henning and the incomparable Anita Morris again. Henning's important contribution to the world of illusions is well represented here, and gives a fun reminder of what the 70's were like. I still love this score, although I will forever put my money on the Original Broadway Cast recording. This is a good DVD to have for a collector, but don't expect too much. The story is inane, the jokes vaudevillian, and the acting merely adequate. Nonetheless, how nice to occaisionally see a forgotten show come back to the surface, huh?",2,Could it be Magic?
