It's not about the movie itself which is quite good and considered by many as a classic horror - it's about the edition. First it doesn't even have a menu. But that's a minor misdoing. What's more important - this is a TOTALLY cut version. All the scenes that are loved by viewers and because of which the movie became famous are not here. And I mean ALL.Wait just a little for a new 2-disc Media Blasters' ""Anthropophagous"" edition which has to be a full-verison. And this one...

Those titled movies include the notorious scenes of the fetus getting ripped out of a woman's womb and the self-evisceration and devouring of the zombie's guts at the film's end.  As of this writing, Anthropophagus is not available (to my knowledge) on a US, region 1 DVD.  This heavily cut and edited version is all that is available on DVD (though the uncut versions are purchasable on VHS in NTSC format).Add to the fact that the picture and sound on Grim Reaper is laughably bad and that there are no special features (not even chapter stops- the whole movie runs in one continuous loop, so to jump ahead requires your finger on the fast frame or fast rewind buttons), and what was an effective gross-out, 3 1/2 star gore flick has been transferred into a 1 star ripoff.Perhaps we'll see Anthropophagus in an uncut DVD version by Anchor Bay or Image in the not too distant future.
