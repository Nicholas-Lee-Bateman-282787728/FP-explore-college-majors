Lees,"[0, 0]","Wilde was present at the final dress rehearsal of his play and after watching the performance commented that he thought it was really splendid - indeed, in places it reminded him of a play he'd once written called The Importance of Being Earnest.I had the same feeling after watching this DVD.  The cast is talented and capable but the direction is entirely wrong for Earnest.  The director has interpreted Wilde's lightweight comedy of social manners as though it were realist drama.  As such the vast majority of lines are thrown away and the ridiculousness inherent in Wilde's script - the self-mockery - is largely lost. Only Judi Dench and one or two supporting cast members manage to push past this misdirection to provide moments of truly comic relief.Earnest is a difficult play to stage because it reads better than it sounds; but the same is true of several Noel Coward plays and a good director can bring these off successfully so long as the style is correct.  One can only hope that Earnest will be re-filmed at some point in the future by a director who understands how to interpret this kind of material.

718167,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B00006JDVX,Andrew Raker,"[1, 2]","For being a motion picture production directed toward a large audience (rather than aficionados of British Literature), I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the screenplay and the loyalty to Oscar Wilde's intent. It is true that some changes were made [see below], but as a whole, the film resembled the play quite well.Colin Firth (A&E;'s Pride and Prejudice) and Judi Dench (Cranford) both were quite enjoyable to watch in their roles of Algernon and Lady Bracknell. Rupert Everett and Reese Witherspoon (Miramax's Vanity Fair) additionally performed well in their respective roles.I did experience  2 instances where the DVD skipped. The first instance was just after the butler says, ""I didn't think it polite to listen."" However, the skip was only a few seconds. The second instance where the film skipped was about 2 minutes later for diration of what appeared to be a few frames. Therefore, the skipping was minimal but still something to consider. [PS: I am not certain whether the skipping signifies an inferiority in the DVD itself or if it denotes some problems in the transfer to DVD. If the later is the problem, than hopefully, the DVD will not become worse after I play the DVD numerous times.]For individuals very interested in (or obsessed with) Oscar Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" I have listed below a few aspects about the film which I disliked:1.At 97 minutes, a large amount of dialogue is cut from the production. While the film attempts to keep most memorable lines, the changes and omissions might disconcert a passionate fan of Oscar Wilde because they do mitigate the wit of the original play.2.The setting and pace are changed for quite a large number of scenes. Some of the changes in setting, I believe, enhances the film. Other changes, however, detract. Additionally, by creating a greater visual focus, ever fewer words are spoken, and they even more slowly than in any other adaptation of which I am acquainted. Therefore, the film becomes boring at times, when the quick repartees are not quite so quick as they should be.3.A few elements of the plot are changed from the play, although I suppose one could argue that they are possible conclusions that might be read into the play. For example, in this film adaptation, Lady Bracknell is portrayed as an actress who becomes pregnant with Lord Bracknell's child before the couple's marriage (i.e. that the pregnancy is the impetus for the marriage). Also, in this film adaptation, John Worthing's real name turns out to be John Moncrieff, with John pretending that it is 'Ernest.' I didn't find these changes particularly humorous.In conclusion, while I DO RECOMMEND this 2002 film adaptation, I personally prefer the following made for TV adaptations, which follow the original play more closely:- the 114 minute Consolidated Productions adaptation with Wendy Hiller as Lady Bracknell  [view on YouTube]- the 110 minute BBC 1986 adaptation with Joan Plowright as Lady Bracknell",4,Better than I expected,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,2983,"['being', 'motion', 'picture', 'production', 'directed', 'large', 'audience', 'rather', 'aficionados', 'British', 'Literature', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'screenplay', 'loyalty', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'intent', 'true', 'changes', 'were', 'made', '[', 'see', ']', 'whole', 'film', 'resembled', 'play', 'quite', 'well.Colin', 'Firth', 'A', 'E', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cranford', 'were', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'roles', 'Algernon', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Miramax', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'additionally', 'performed', 'well', 'respective', 'roles.I', 'did', 'experience', '2', 'instances', 'where', 'DVD', 'skipped', 'first', 'instance', 'was', 'just', 'butler', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'polite', 'listen', 'However', 'skip', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'second', 'instance', 'where', 'film', 'skipped', 'was', '2', 'minutes', 'later', 'diration', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'few', 'frames', 'Therefore', 'skipping', 'was', 'minimal', 'still', 'something', 'consider', 'PS', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'skipping', 'signifies', 'inferiority', 'DVD', 'problems', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'later', 'problem', 'hopefully', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'worse', 'play', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'times', ']', 'individuals', 'very', 'interested', 'obsessed', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'have', 'listed', 'few', 'aspects', 'film', 'disliked:1.At', '97', 'minutes', 'large', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'cut', 'production', 'film', 'attempts', 'keep', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'changes', 'omissions', 'might', 'disconcert', 'passionate', 'fan', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'do', 'mitigate', 'wit', 'original', 'play.2.The', 'setting', 'pace', 'are', 'changed', 'quite', 'large', 'number', 'scenes', 'changes', 'setting', 'believe', 'film', 'Other', 'changes', 'however', 'detract', 'Additionally', 'creating', 'greater', 'visual', 'focus', 'ever', 'fewer', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'even', 'more', 'slowly', 'other', 'adaptation', 'am', 'acquainted', 'Therefore', 'film', 'boring', 'times', 'when', 'quick', 'repartees', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'quick', 'should', 'be.3.A', 'few', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'changed', 'play', 'suppose', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'are', 'possible', 'conclusions', 'might', 'be', 'read', 'play', 'example', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'portrayed', 'actress', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Lord', 'Bracknell', 'child', 'couple', 'marriage', 'i.e', 'pregnancy', 'impetus', 'marriage', 'Also', 'film', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Worthing', 'real', 'name', 'out', 'be', 'John', 'Moncrieff', 'John', 'pretending', ""'Ernest"", 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'changes', 'particularly', 'humorous.In', 'conclusion', 'DO', 'RECOMMEND', '2002', 'film', 'adaptation', 'personally', 'prefer', 'following', 'made', 'TV', 'adaptations', 'follow', 'original', 'play', 'more', 'closely', '114', 'minute', 'Consolidated', 'Productions', 'adaptation', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', '[', 'view', 'YouTube', ']', '110', 'minute', 'BBC', '1986', 'adaptation', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Lady', 'Bracknell']",The Importance of Being Earnest

Anna Massey is a great Miss Prism and the same goes for Tom Wilkinson (who seems to appear in everything at some point or other!) as Dr. Chazzuble.

Firth, Everett and Densch deliver the best performances that could possibly be given of this material.  This is the film version of the Oscar Wilde play that was written and first performed more than a century ago.  I only wish it had aged as well as the films we've seen based on Austen's works. Alas, I cannot.  It does not have the same timeless, universal quality to it.  It may also really be closer to a B- or C+ than a solid B.  It is a very slight, frothy comedy, involving Firth and Everett in their foibles from inventing a fictitious person, Earnest.  Although Earnest has enabled them to get away with many things as a built in contrivance numerous times, the tables are about to be turned.  Earnest, in fact, would be best off dead.  That's the setup for what is a high camp comedy that at moments feels like everyone is trying too hard with the material at hand.  However, this does have Firth, Everett and Densch and they do their best to pull as much as they can out of this material.  Surprisingly, Everett and Firth sing a number at the end of the movie together, over the credits, which I really enjoy, &quot;Lady Come Down.&quot;  I bought the DVD; I'd recommend renting it instead.

We laughed the whole time and were captivated by the wit and humor of the lines.  Needless to say, when ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" came to the movie theater we ran to see it.I can not say enough GOOD about this movie.  It was almost line for line from the play, and the characters seemed to be made for their parts.  It took me a while to get used to serious, stone-faced Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) being the playful, funny ""Earnest""/John, but he was wonderful in the part.  As always, Rupert Everett (the cute, wonderful, and funny Arthur in ""Ideal Husband"") lived up to my expectations and BECAME ""Earnest""/Alganon.I would HIGHLY recommend that you watch this movie--over and over!  If you enjoy dry humor and wit, you will love this movie.  You have to listen closely to catch all the puns and one-liners, but they are so funny when you do.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Alganon shows up at John's house and the next 20 minutes of the movie are spent with John trying to get rid of his unwanted houseguest--the lines are classic.

718189,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00006JDVX,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 5]","I gave this DVD version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" four stars. There were two major strengths to the film and one distracting weakness.First, Oscar Wilde's amazingly witty script is wonderful and the use of the one-line 'zinger' is still evident in ""I Love Lucy"", ""All in the Family"", ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Friends"". The contemporary situation comedy is a direct discendent of Wilde's witty comedies. The plot is idiotic and the lines clever - a formula followed for the last 100 years in comedy theater. My favorite line is spoken by Lady Brachnell.  Whne the rich orphan Jack Worthing tells her that he has ""lost both parents""; she responds ""To lose one parent is a misfortune, but to lose both seems careless.""Second, the acting is very good, with Rupert Everett and Colin Firth both demonstrating their considerable talents to be comic actors as well as accomplished dramatic actors. Reese Witherspoon and Francis O'Connor are given amazingly absurd coy lines, and they both perform perfectly. Of course, Judi Dench, as the hateful Lady Brachnell gets to play the semi-villian and thus gets the Cruella DeVille type lines.However there is a weak flaw to the film which is a series of additions, meant to maintain the interest of contemporary audiences, that should have beened edited out. There are scenes of slapstick where Algy runs from creditors, where he arrives at Jack's country estate in a hot air balloon, and where Reese Witherspoon's visions of knights rescuing damsels are superimposed and awkward.  The film would have been better had these items been removed. The most awkard addition is Gwendolen Bracknell's tatoo of the name ""Earnest"" on her rear-end; a total cultural disconnect.None-the-less, the acting is very good and the script is very clever; which makes for an entertaining evening.",4,Witty period piece well done for contemporary audiences,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,1821,"['gave', 'DVD', 'version', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'four', 'stars', 'were', 'two', 'major', 'strengths', 'film', 'one', 'distracting', 'weakness.First', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'amazingly', 'witty', 'script', 'wonderful', 'use', 'one-line', ""'zinger"", 'still', 'evident', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Family', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Friends', 'contemporary', 'situation', 'comedy', 'direct', 'discendent', 'Wilde', 'witty', 'comedies', 'plot', 'idiotic', 'lines', 'clever', 'formula', 'followed', 'last', '100', 'years', 'comedy', 'theater', 'favorite', 'line', 'spoken', 'Lady', 'Brachnell', 'Whne', 'rich', 'orphan', 'Jack', 'Worthing', 'lost', 'parents', 'lose', 'one', 'parent', 'misfortune', 'lose', 'careless', 'Second', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'demonstrating', 'considerable', 'talents', 'be', 'comic', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'accomplished', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Francis', ""O'Connor"", 'are', 'given', 'amazingly', 'absurd', 'coy', 'lines', 'perform', 'perfectly', 'course', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'hateful', 'Lady', 'Brachnell', 'play', 'semi-villian', 'thus', 'Cruella', 'DeVille', 'type', 'lines.However', 'weak', 'flaw', 'film', 'series', 'additions', 'meant', 'maintain', 'interest', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'should', 'have', 'beened', 'edited', 'out', 'are', 'scenes', 'slapstick', 'where', 'Algy', 'creditors', 'where', 'Jack', 'country', 'estate', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'where', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'visions', 'knights', 'rescuing', 'damsels', 'are', 'superimposed', 'awkward', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'items', 'been', 'removed', 'most', 'awkard', 'addition', 'Gwendolen', 'Bracknell', 'tatoo', 'name', 'Earnest', 'rear-end', 'total', 'cultural', 'disconnect.None-the-less', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'very', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'evening']",The Importance of Being Earnest

In one shot, imagine the main players picking lavendar in a stretching field of purple. Also, the rivarlies between the sophisticated Frances O'Connor and the young Reese Witherspoon and the competition between Colin Firth and Rupert Everette are more thoughtfully presented. Furthermore, the ending was more suspenseful, not unlike a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and the way Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) disclosed his real name to the anticipating audience had a more intriguing twist.However, the old one had characters (Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Joan Greenwood, Dorothy Tutin) who looked sinisterly funny and a very comic looking Lady Bracknell (Edith Evans) with a pronounced accent. She captured every scene and is the one to watch in the 1952 movie, just look at the DVD cover. Even the costumes in the 1952 movie looked more conspicuous, colourful and exaggerating. The dialogues in both versions were more or less the same. But I believe the older version has included more of the original dialogues.I would say the 2002 movie is the more pleasing to the eyes and romantic while the 1952 movie is more of a comedy and a play, as Oscar Wilde intended it to be.

Not in the age of Twitter and text messages. It was a real treat to hear and nice to have to exercise my brain. It was a real disappointment that some of the sentences were slurred.

Film and stage are two entirely different beasts, and success in one venue often gives disappointment in the other.  While I generally enjoy live theatre more (especially comedies), I'm happy to report that this is a reasonable adaptation of Wilde's play.  If it ultimately plays better in a live theatre, the director and actors have given us a film that we can enjoy any time, i.e. when we don't have access to a live production.Much has been made in some reviews that Wilde's ""precious language"" has been altered.  This is often considered a cardinal sin with Wilde, as the language IS the play.  Not having studied the play, I can't comment line-for-line on the veracity of the film version, but the rhythm and delivery are perfectly acceptable.  There are pieces drawn from the 4-act version (rarely performed), and some strange fantasy inserts to demonstrate Cecily's flights of fancy, but neither are distracting and, I think, they add to the cinematic quality - a movie needs to be more than just a filmed stage play, after all.The story is set firmly in Victorian England, but continues to carry a resonance with audiences today due to its themes being rooted in universal human nature.  To wit: Algernon and Jack are friends, and each have an alternate life that allows them to escape the duties and stresses of their normal life.  Algy has invented ""Bunbury"", a fictional sick uncle who he has to care for, as a means to avoid unwanted social engagements.  Jack plays the role of Earnest, his own fictional brother, which allows him to be a degenerate when he comes to town to blow off steam.  One thing leads to another and at one point both Jack and Algy are pretending to be Earnest to different people, and both are engaged to different girls without their respective guardians' consent.  Ultimately it is a comedy of manners and social embarassment, at times no more sophisticated than an episode of ""Three's Company"", but it is always very funny.I mentioned the 4-act play (as opposed to the usually performed 3-act version) because there is one curious omission in the film.  In the excised act there is a scene where Cecily and Algy (pretending to be Earnest) are so busy recording the events of their lives in their diaries that they forget to actually LIVE their lives.  It reminds me very much of the current fad of spending so much time tweeting about your life that you aren't really experiencing it.  This scene would add a contemporary satirical twist that Wilde never envisioned, but would serve to emphasize that this is a story of universal human nature.Finally, a word on the performances.  Dame Judith Dench plays Lady Bracknell, the larger-than-life aunt of Algernon (often, at least at the Stratford festival, played by a man in drag).  In every scene that she's in she steals the show, and when she is not present (through much of Act II), the show seems to lose momentum, as if Colin Firth (Jack) and Rupert Everett can't keep up.  They are two actors that I normally enjoy and who can each steal their own films (e.g. Bridget Jones's Diary and My Best Friend's Wedding, respectively), so it's a little disappointing to see.  To sum up, this is a competent production.  The DVD is not particularly interesting (it is relatively bare-bones), but this is not the kind of film that needs a bid DVD box set.  I would still recommend seeing The Importance of Being Earnest live, if possible.

718197,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00006JDVX,Craig Matteson,"[2, 4]","""The Importance of Being Earnest"" was a huge success in its time.  As you listen to the language you can understand why.  The wit and fun of it carry the audience along as if we were running from ride to ride at a verbal amusement park.  Here a brilliant phrase, there sly social commentary, there a bit of romance, back again for a simple joke or an inversion of meaning (much of the play is about one kind of inversion or another).  Oscar Wilde was an easy virtuoso who had total command of his art form however light the purpose.This movie is beautifully done and is quite enjoyable.  There are some strange changes that make no sense to me.  For example, why make Jack the younger brother when in the play he is the older brother?  The changes of chopping up scenes is a bow to movie making and the attention span of modern audiences, but it isn't Wilde.  Also, the play was presented as the present time in 1895.  This movie seems to be Victorian in dress, but later in technology and music.  And what is the tattoo business?  And why do movie makers seem to need to chop language from plays whose glory is precisely their language?  Since we go to the movie FOR the language more than the pictures of these playwrights, why not make the movie just a bit longer and leave us what the author actually wrote?Those quibbles aside, the actors are brilliant, enjoyable, and make watching this movie a delight.That being said, one of the issues in enjoying these popular works from a century or more ago is that we cannot enjoy them exactly as their original audiences did.  Since this was a play of the present time it is clear it is not our present.  We enjoy it with what we know about those times with their manners and customs.  We also enjoy getting to know more about how those people viewed their present.  There is also the delight in the differences between their time and ours as well as the shocking similarities.  These cultural treasures take on additional meanings as they take remain the same but take shifting places in the pantheon as our culture moves beneath them.Very much worth seeing, enjoying, and remembering.",5,Very much worth seeing and enjoying,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2133,"['Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'time', 'listen', 'language', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'wit', 'fun', 'audience', 'along', 'were', 'running', 'ride', 'ride', 'verbal', 'amusement', 'park', 'Here', 'brilliant', 'phrase', 'sly', 'social', 'commentary', 'bit', 'romance', 'back', 'again', 'simple', 'joke', 'inversion', 'meaning', 'much', 'play', 'one', 'kind', 'inversion', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'was', 'easy', 'virtuoso', 'who', 'had', 'total', 'command', 'art', 'form', 'however', 'light', 'purpose.This', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'done', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'strange', 'changes', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'why', 'make', 'Jack', 'younger', 'brother', 'when', 'play', 'older', 'brother', 'changes', 'chopping', 'up', 'scenes', 'bow', 'movie', 'making', 'attention', 'span', 'modern', 'audiences', ""n't"", 'Wilde', 'Also', 'play', 'was', 'presented', 'present', 'time', '1895', 'movie', 'be', 'Victorian', 'dress', 'later', 'technology', 'music', 'what', 'tattoo', 'business', 'why', 'do', 'movie', 'makers', 'seem', 'need', 'chop', 'language', 'plays', 'glory', 'precisely', 'language', 'go', 'movie', 'language', 'more', 'pictures', 'playwrights', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'longer', 'leave', 'what', 'author', 'actually', 'wrote', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'enjoyable', 'make', 'watching', 'movie', 'delight.That', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'issues', 'enjoying', 'popular', 'works', 'century', 'more', 'ago', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'exactly', 'original', 'audiences', 'did', 'was', 'play', 'present', 'time', 'clear', 'not', 'present', 'enjoy', 'what', 'know', 'times', 'manners', 'customs', 'also', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'know', 'more', 'how', 'people', 'viewed', 'present', 'also', 'delight', 'differences', 'time', 'ours', 'as', 'well', 'shocking', 'similarities', 'cultural', 'treasures', 'take', 'additional', 'meanings', 'take', 'remain', 'same', 'take', 'shifting', 'places', 'pantheon', 'culture', 'beneath', 'them.Very', 'much', 'seeing', 'enjoying', 'remembering']",The Importance of Being Earnest

718205,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00006JDVX,Dennis Littrell,"[67, 82]","This is an inventive and artful production of Oscar Wilde's play, but I can confidently say that were Oscar Wilde alive today, he would be appalled at the misuse to which his play has been put.  Indeed I think I feel the ground rumbling as he rolls over in his grave, and yes he is actually spinning in anguish.Oliver Parker, who directed and wrote the screen adaptation, simply misinterpreted the play.  He focused on the ""dashing young bachelors"" when the real focus of the play is Lady Bracknell, the absurd and beautifully ironic representation of the Victorian mind who was then and has been for over a hundred years Wilde's singular creation and one of the great characters of English literature.  She is supposed to steal every scene she is in and we are to double take everyone of her speeches as we feel that she is simultaneous absurd and exactly right.  Instead Judi Dench's Lady Bracknell (and I don't blame Dench who is a fine actress) is harsh and stern and literal to the point of being a controlling matriarch when what Wilde had in mind was somebody who was both pompous and almost idiotic yet capable of a penetrating and cynical wisdom (so like the author's).  Compared to Dane Edith Evans's brilliant performance in the celebrated cinematic production from 1952, Dench's Lady Bracknell is positively one-dimensional.The point of Wilde's play was to simultaneously delight and satirize the Victorian audience who came to watch the play.  This is the genius of the play: the play-goer might view all of the values of bourgeois society being upheld while at the same time they are being made fun of.  Not an easy trick, but that is why The Importance of Being Earnest is considered one of the greatest plays ever written.  This attempt to turn it into a light entertainment for today's youthful audiences fails because this play is not a romantic comedy.  It is more precisely a satire of a romantic comedy.  Its point and Wilde's intent was to make fun of Victorian notions of romance and marrying well and to expose the mercantile nature of that society.  It is probably impossible to ""translate"" the play for the contemporary film viewer since a satire of today's audiences and today's society would require an entirely different set of rapiers.Parker's additions to the play amount to distractions that dilute the essence of the play's incomparable wit.  Most of Wilde's witticisms are lost in the glare of Parker's busy work. Recalling Lady Bracknell as a dance hall girl in her youth who became pregnant before being wed was ridiculous and not only added nothing, but misinterpreted her character.  Lady Bracknell is not a hypocrite with a compromised past.  She is everything she pretends to be and that is the joke.  Showing Algernon actually running through the streets to escape creditors or being threatened with debtor's prison was silly and again missed the point.  Algy was ""hard up"" true and in need of ""ready money"" but his bills would be paid.  Gwendolyn in goggles and cap driving a motor car also added nothing and seemed to place the play some years after the fact.The big mistake movie directors often make when adapting a stage play into a movie is to feel compelled to get the play off the stage and out into the streets and countryside.  Almost always these attempts are simply distractions.  Some of the greatest adaptations--Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951 comes immediately to mind--played it straight and didn't try anything fancy.  Here Parker seems obsessed with ""dressing up"" the play.  What he does is obscure it.On the positive side the costumes were beautiful and Anna Massy was an indelible Miss Prism.  Reese Witherspoon at least looked the part of Cecily and she obviously worked hard.  Rupert Evertt had some moments in the beginning that resembled Wilde's Algernon, but he was not able to sustain the impersonation.My recommendation is that you not bother with this production and instead get the 1952 film starring, in addition to Edith Evans, Michael Redgrave and Margaret Rutherford.  It is essentially true to the play as Wilde wrote it, and is a pure delight.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",3,A misinterpretation of a great play,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,4234,"['inventive', 'artful', 'production', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'play', 'can', 'confidently', 'say', 'were', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'alive', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'appalled', 'misuse', 'play', 'been', 'put', 'Indeed', 'think', 'feel', 'ground', 'rumbling', 'over', 'grave', 'yes', 'actually', 'spinning', 'anguish.Oliver', 'Parker', 'who', 'directed', 'wrote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'simply', 'misinterpreted', 'play', 'focused', 'dashing', 'young', 'bachelors', 'when', 'real', 'focus', 'play', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'absurd', 'beautifully', 'ironic', 'representation', 'Victorian', 'mind', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'been', 'hundred', 'years', 'Wilde', 'singular', 'creation', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'English', 'literature', 'supposed', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'double', 'take', 'everyone', 'speeches', 'feel', 'simultaneous', 'absurd', 'exactly', 'right', 'Instead', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Dench', 'who', 'fine', 'actress', 'harsh', 'stern', 'literal', 'point', 'being', 'controlling', 'matriarch', 'when', 'what', 'Wilde', 'had', 'mind', 'was', 'somebody', 'who', 'was', 'pompous', 'almost', 'idiotic', 'yet', 'capable', 'penetrating', 'cynical', 'wisdom', 'author', 'Compared', 'Dane', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'celebrated', 'cinematic', 'production', '1952', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'positively', 'one-dimensional.The', 'point', 'Wilde', 'play', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'delight', 'satirize', 'Victorian', 'audience', 'who', 'came', 'watch', 'play', 'genius', 'play', 'play-goer', 'might', 'view', 'values', 'bourgeois', 'society', 'being', 'upheld', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'Not', 'easy', 'trick', 'why', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'plays', 'ever', 'written', 'attempt', 'turn', 'light', 'entertainment', 'today', 'youthful', 'audiences', 'fails', 'play', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'precisely', 'satire', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'point', 'Wilde', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'fun', 'Victorian', 'notions', 'romance', 'marrying', 'well', 'expose', 'mercantile', 'nature', 'society', 'probably', 'impossible', 'translate', 'play', 'contemporary', 'film', 'viewer', 'satire', 'today', 'audiences', 'today', 'society', 'would', 'require', 'entirely', 'different', 'set', 'rapiers.Parker', 'additions', 'play', 'amount', 'distractions', 'dilute', 'essence', 'play', 'incomparable', 'wit', 'Most', 'Wilde', 'witticisms', 'are', 'lost', 'glare', 'Parker', 'busy', 'work', 'Recalling', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'dance', 'hall', 'girl', 'youth', 'who', 'became', 'pregnant', 'being', 'wed', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'only', 'added', 'nothing', 'misinterpreted', 'character', 'Lady', 'Bracknell', 'not', 'hypocrite', 'compromised', 'past', 'everything', 'be', 'joke', 'Showing', 'Algernon', 'actually', 'running', 'streets', 'escape', 'creditors', 'being', 'threatened', 'debtor', 'prison', 'was', 'silly', 'again', 'missed', 'point', 'Algy', 'was', 'hard', 'up', 'true', 'need', 'ready', 'money', 'bills', 'would', 'be', 'paid', 'Gwendolyn', 'goggles', 'cap', 'driving', 'motor', 'car', 'also', 'added', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'place', 'play', 'years', 'fact.The', 'big', 'mistake', 'movie', 'directors', 'often', 'make', 'when', 'adapting', 'stage', 'play', 'movie', 'feel', 'compelled', 'get', 'play', 'stage', 'streets', 'countryside', 'Almost', 'always', 'attempts', 'are', 'simply', 'distractions', 'greatest', 'adaptations', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'immediately', 'mind', 'played', 'straight', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'anything', 'fancy', 'Here', 'Parker', 'obsessed', 'dressing', 'up', 'play', 'What', 'obscure', 'positive', 'side', 'costumes', 'were', 'beautiful', 'Anna', 'Massy', 'was', 'indelible', 'Miss', 'Prism', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'least', 'looked', 'part', 'Cecily', 'obviously', 'worked', 'hard', 'Rupert', 'Evertt', 'had', 'moments', 'beginning', 'resembled', 'Wilde', 'Algernon', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'sustain', 'impersonation.My', 'recommendation', 'not', 'bother', 'production', 'instead', 'get', '1952', 'film', 'starring', 'addition', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'essentially', 'true', 'play', 'Wilde', 'wrote', 'pure', 'delight.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",The Importance of Being Earnest

If you know nothing of the play or subsequent movie versions of the play, you might wonder, which is best? Which should I buy? Should I buy both of them?The version of EARNEST released in 1952 stars Michael Redgrave as Worthing (father of Lynn, Vanessa, and Colin Redgrave; grandfather of Miranda and Natasha Richardson, etc.), Dame Edith Evans as Aunt Augusta, Joan Greenwood as Gwendolyn, Margaret Rutherford as the woeful governess, and several other fine stage actors of 1950s England.The 1952 version is 95 minutes long and presented as a stage play with a few outdoors settings.  If you want to see the play as Wilde probably meant it to be seen, this version is the one to buy. The dialogue is snappy and smart, the humor dry and witty, the actors are filled with zest. Not only that, but the 1952 version is a Criterion DVD with `digital transfer' and historical notes.The second version of EARNEST, released in theaters a year or two ago, and listed here, stars Colin Firth as Worthing, Rupert Everett as Algeron, Frances O'Conner as Gwendolyn, Dame Judi Dench as Aunt Augusta, Anna Massey in the Margaret Rutherford role, Reese Witherspoon as Cecily, and Edward Fox as Algeron's underpaid manservant. If Wilde knows about this version, he is probably spinning in his grave in Pere Lachaise.The dialogue (Wilde wrote) is virtually the same in both films, and the actors for the most part are great actors, but something has gone missing from this version. I love Colin Firth, but he is dismal as Worthing. I am ambivalent about Everett but he is the best thing in the newer film (and why I gave it one star). Anna Massey is fine, I loved her as George Sand's mother in IMPROMPTU, but after seeing Margaret Rutherford play the role of the wayward nanny-turned-tutor she's pathetic.The new EARNEST plays like an old record on warped speed compared with the Michael Redgrave film. Wilde's witty dialogue moves so slowly, the repartee is as flat as fallen souffle. On top of that, what is a knight in armor doing in this play? Did the screen play call for this bit of nonsense or did the director decide to borrow elements from a few other films! For example, in several scenes, Firth (Worthing) gives an almost repeat performance of scenes from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I could forgive the ripoff of P&amp;P in BRIDGET JONES because that film is a satire on P&amp;P, but in EARNEST it simply doesn't work.The action in the newer version is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W compared with the Criterion version. Did the director slow the action because he thought &quot;monolingual&quot; Americans would understand the words better?? How stupid, GOSFORD PARK did just fine.

The comedy centers around the men's ill-conceived attempts to conceal their identities.  The script seems faithful to Wilde and very good; but I remember reading the play on my own and finding it even funnier.  Good literature always reads better than it comes across as performed.  No theatre can compare with the perfect theatre of the mind!  I like the cast in general--a competent crew--though I suspect that they failed to fully exploit the humor in the script.  Scenes that should have been hilarious were merely interesting.  A certain dynamic tension was lacking: the actors exercised far too much restraint and should have been much more expressive and passionate, and played each quip for full effect.  Despite my criticism, the movie is a strong and professional effort, better than most period pieces.  The saving grace is Wilde's wit and his aesthetic philosophy, which shines through along with the barest glimmers of class consciousness.  Wilde is never boring and his plays inspire reflection.  If the British legal system of 1895 had not seen fit to crucify this promising playwright, who knows what great works he might have bequeathed us?

The main fault has to lie with the director, who didn't keep a tight rein on the story line, tried to introduce modern day stream of consciousness scenes which didn't seem to belong with a plot of Wilde's at all, and who chose America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon, to play the major role of an English proper schoolgirl. Perhaps she does some fine work in this country (I've never seen any of it), but the only word to describe her work in this film is ""abominable,"" and she really pulls the movie down watching her amateurish high school-like performance while acting with some great, great pros like Dame Judi Dench and Colin Firth (and they alone must be given credit for holding this movie afloat). I like Rupert Everett, but he seems miscast in this film as well, being a little too droopy and flaccid for the character he plays, and his instantaneous falling in love with Firth's ward, Witherspoon, is not at all believable. Perhaps he is playing the character as if he smells money when he is in desperate financial circumstances.The plot in short: Firth is in love with a lady played by Frances O'Connor (adequately), Everett falls in love (maybe) with Witherspoon. Both ladies believe these men are named Earnest because of the subterfuge of the men, and both women adulate that name. When they find out their true names, their passions hang in the air while the women try to figure things out, and Dame Judi Dench tries to throw a monkey wrench in all their plans.The great characteristic of Oscar Wilde's plays is his fabulous wit.  In this film, all of his so original witicisms have been expunged.Try the earlier film version (I believe it was with Michael Redgrave).

I am a fan of both Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon, so despite some of the poor reviews of their acting in this film, I went ahead and purchased the movie. I should've listened to those reviews however, because Firth plays a horrid Jack Worthing! He plays Worthing the same way he played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, which is all wrong for Jack's character. And as much as I like Reese Witherspoon, she just didn't catch the essence of Cecily at all. The dialog - which was sharp and witty in my head reading the play - is just dead in this movie version. Too slow for sure, but it's missing something else, almost like the actors just didn't ""get"" the humor (maybe forgivable for Witherspoon, who is American, but what is Firth's excuse?), or maybe it had to do with the director, I don't know, but the fact remains this movie just doesn't ""work."" The tattoo scene, especially, which is not in Wilde's play, struck me as a bad attempt at perhaps adding a little sex appeal to draw a younger crowd. Was there anything to smile about in this movie version? Rupert Everett played a pretty good Algy, as did Tom Wilkinson as Dr Chasuble and Anna Massey as Miss Prism.

All of the actors in this film capture the spirit and wit and acceptable silliness of the play, and it is well worth while viewing it.Two men think that they need to use false names. One calls himself Earnest whenever he leaves his country home and goes into the city to have fun. The other uses a fictitious name to escape the social affairs that his aunt insists that he attend; he says he has to visit his (fictitious) sick friend. The first is in love with the second's aunt's daughter, who, as previously stated, knows him by the name Earnest. She tells him that she loves him, but could not love him if his name were not Earnest. She even tattoos the name Earnest on her behind. Hence, the importance of being Earnest if she wants her as a wife.There are other humorous and witty elements in the play. The aunt refuses to allow her daughter to marry ""Earnest"" because he is a foundling. Thus ""Earnest"" needs to find out who are his parents. Also, the nephew is curious about ""Earnest""'s eighteen year old ward. He goes to the house of ""Earnest,"" who is known at home as Jack, and claims that he is Jack's brother Earnest.

718234,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00006JDVX,James Hiller,"[3, 4]","Imagine the challenge of tackling adapting a near perfect play for the screen, one known and adored across the world as the pinnacle of comedy. Oliver Parker undertook such a challenge in making ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" into cinematic fare, and the end result is, a new view of brilliance!Starring Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Dame Judi Dench, and Reese Witherspoon, Earnest spins the tale of comical deceit of two friends, Jack and Algernon. Each conspire through the film to woo girls of their choosing by nearly any means possible. The end result is reminiscient of some of Shakespeare's best comedies, one of implausibilities that are so absurb that you believe them all of the more. Perhaps Wilde, in his genuis of paradox, intended for that to happen all along.Parker's adaptation of the play is brilliant in its own right. Taking much from the source text, and translating it to a visual medium, such as film, must have been quite daunting. Parker succeeded quite well, creating a film that doesn't ever work to subsume the originial, but complement it in its own unique way. I think perhaps that Wilde would love this adaptation himself!The acting in this film is superb. First, how can anyone go wrong with Firth, Everett, Witherspoon, and the incomperable Dench, who seethes with her role with an intensity that only she can muster. They handle the comedy with aplomb and naturalness; it sparkles delightful. Reese Witherspoon pulls off her English accent quite well, playing Cicely as young and delightful as she is.Another aspect of this film that is remarkable is the soundtrack. Normally, a soundtrack blends in to accompany the larger piece. In this movie, the soundtrack stands out as a wild, fun accourement to the film. I quite enjoyed the jazzy feel to it, and the scene where Algy and Jack serenade the girls is so bubbly fun that it inspires intense hilarity. I just purchased the soundtrack and look forward it its many hours playing on my computer.The Importance of Being Earnest may be a forgotten gem, but once you unearth it, it sparkles like nothing you've seen on your screen in months.

The added dream sequences to show that the pure Cecily had more on her mind than her studies didn't detract from the actual play, and Reese Witherspoon does an admirable job of portraying her. In fact the best thing about this film is that all of the actors do an admirable job, including Anna Massey and Tom Wilkinson. They bring nuances to the characters of Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble that I've not seen in any other performance.  Massey's portrayal of a spacey Miss Prism, who abides by all of the rules by which a governess must live, but dwells in her head and her idealism so much that she does the improbable. She loses a baby by putting him in her handbag and misplacing it; and though she regrets it, it is the return of her handbag that gets more response from her than the discovery that the baby (now an adult) is safe. Wilkinson makes the audience truly empathize with his shyness. Though this film has been around a good while, I recommend seeing it if you haven't and seeing it again, if you have.

718264,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006JDVX,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is a film where if you do not know the play (which earns five stars), then you would give this movie four stars but if you do it gets only three.  Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play can be laid at the feet of writer-director Oliver Parker, who attempts to make the 19th-century comedy more palatable to a 21st-century audience.  The result can be aptly characterized as one step forward, two steps back.  Parker adds a sense of energy to the interactions of these sedate Victorian characters (there is, believe it or not, hugging in this film between gentlemen), which tends to work against the ideal delivery of Wilde's dry witticisms.On the one hand the addition of a minor sub-plot involving paying an outstanding bill at a London establishment adds to the general sense of confusing regarding Earnest/John/Algy, which aptly fits the skewed way in which the truth functions in this story.  But then Parker decides to add his own joke at the end which totally negates the principle that makes this all work out in the end (I was going to give the film four stars until that point).  Similarly, the quick flashback into how Aunt Augusta met and won Lord Bracknell is nothing more than a cheap laugh because it ""truth"" defies all reason regarding the workings of the British upper class, especially during the Victorian Era.Parker does nicely expand the idea of little Cecily and her fantasy world represented by her dairy and her habit of writing love letters to herself, in terms of her idealized visions of knightly romance.  But while the idea of the servants sitting around playing assorted musical instruments in the kitchen was funny, having John and Algernon serenading Cecily and Gwendolyn on piano and guitar seems a bit forced.  Again, I acknowledge the probability that only those who are familiar with the play and who recognize these changes as changes.The cast does its best work with Wilde's original material.  Colin Firth (Jack) first impressed me as the only Mr. Darcy I have seen in ""Pride & Prejudice"" who managed to make the transition from being proud to being human.  Rupert Everett (Algy) should have at least received as Oscar nomination for stealing every scene he had in ""My Best Friend's Wedding.""  Judy Dench (Lady Bracknell) is as professional an actress as we have today; I always think of the scene in ""Shakespeare in Love"" when Gwyneth Paltrow is about to curtsey instead of bow and Queen Elizabeth just makes her pupil dilate to convey a message.  Her interview scene with Jack best preserves Wilde's original play.  Reese Witherspoon (Cecily) holds her own with the English cast and gets points for tackling Wilde.  Frances O'Connor (Gwendolyn) is the relative newcomer of the cast, but the fact she had a title role in a BBC production of ""Madame Bovary"" is a good sign.  Tom Wilkinson is rather wasted as Dr. Chasuble, but it is nice to see a familiar face, as is the case with Edward Fox who nails his too few lines as Lane.  Anna Massey as Miss Prism completes the main cast and provides the key piece to the big puzzle.Ironically, I enjoyed ""An Ideal Husband,"" Parker's earlier screen adaptation of Wilde play, and was going to suggest it as a better example of the work of Oscar Wilde.

Nevertheless, he made savvy - if sometimes audacious - choices in adapting Oscar Wilde's oft-produced play for the cinema.While most people agree that Ernest is one of the wittiest plays in the English language, I find that stage productions of it have an unfortunate tendency towards being precious: smug actors smirk at one another as they affectedly recite epigrams in between sips of tea (pinkies out, naturally).  Parker's film nicely sidesteps this potential problem by transforming the prototypical English drawing-room comedy into a dynamic, visually rich and marvelously acted film.

Several scenes that took place in one location in the play are now broken up into multiple locations.  The humor comes from the rapid delivery of lines, and breaking up the action actually hampers Wilde's intent.  The scenes that play best and did make me laugh were the ones that kept the action in one location so I could get into the flow of the scene.

The newest film version is pleasant and enjoyable, but it lacks much of the comic timing so necessary to giving proper delivery of Wilde's witty, acerbic lines. Admittedly, the work has lost some of its punch over the years because society has changed so much. The class system may not have entirely disappeared, but it has certainly mutated. Perhaps the movie would have been funnier had the filmmakers put more emphasis on the characters' eccentricities and less on their quaintness.Algy and Jack [Rupert Everett and Colin Firth] are good friends. Algy is an upper-class gentleman with no money, and Jack is a middleclass guy with lots of it. In pursuit of women, Jack uses a different name in the city, while Algy calls himself something else in the country. Algy wants Gwendolyn [Francis O'Connor], but he isn't good enough to suit her mother, Lady Bracknell [Judi Dench]. Jack is after Cecily [Reese Witherspoon], whose guardian happens to be Algy.

I haven't read the original play, so I don't know how accurate it is, but accurate or not, this movie is FUN, ENTERTAING, and WITTY. I'll go over a few of it's best points:1) the cast is brilliant. Rupert Everett especially. And the charaters are great by by themselves- Ms. Prism &#34;Itellectual pleasures await you my child.&#34; Algy- &#34;I can hardly eat muffins in an aggitated manner, can I? The butter would probably get on my cuffs.&#34;  Jack- &#34;... and I don't intend to have a brother, not even of any kind!&#34; The hilarious lines go on...2) the story is clever. Basically it is as follows: Jack Worthing has invented a wayward brother &#34;Earnest&#34; so that he can have fun in the city without anyone knowing; Algy has invented a invalid friend &#34;Bunbury&#34; so that he has a convenient excuse for getting out of social engagements. When Algy learns about this &#34;brother&#34; he goes to Jack's country home, and under the pretence of being &#34;Earnest&#34;, becomes engaged to Jack's ward, Cecily. Jack comes home, and after announcing that &#34;Earnest&#34; is dead, finds Algy there. Gwendolen, the woman who loves Jack but knows him as &#34;Earnest&#34; comes. Pandimonium ensues. The story ends after they sort out who's not &#34;Earnest&#34;, and Jack discovers that his last name is not Worthing.3) it's VERY funny, and the music is great. The humor is abundant, and the music is a ton of fun, even if it's not totally in line with the set time period.This movie is great. I highly recommend it.Jack-- &#34;I really don't care for the name of Earnest, I don't think it suits me at all.&#34;Gwendolen-- &#34;It suits you perfectly!

718293,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B00006JDVX,O Shepard,"[0, 0]","'The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of my favorite plays and I have watched several stage versions over the years. I attended a  badly acted and mediocre stage version a few weeks ago and decided that I needed to watch the film version.  I could not find the Anthony Asquith 1952 version so I watched this one. The 2002 version is not a bad film though it is a reinterpretation. It is definitely much better then the staged version I attended. However it lacks the panache that makes Oscar Wilde's original such a joy to read and see on stage. Under Oliver Parker's direction, the original play has been transformed into a very well made visual adaptation with much of the original words of the play intact. I did not mind very much the many changes the director made to visually hint at the lifestyle that Wilde was satirizing with words.  Some changes, particularly at the very end of the film, might even be seen by some as an improvement. However the changes, visual and eye-catching as they are, seem out of place at times in a play known for delightful wordplay. The addition of such things such as a hot air ballon, a motorcar, and the extravagent  opulence of the rich in Victorian England is overdone and not in keeping with Oscar Wilde's intentions in the stage play.I understand that the intent of this version was to adapt the rigid stage-bound play to the openness of modern film. The original play was set in 3 scenes in 3 acts. Oliver Parker moves the play outside and to various indoor locations to capture the essense of Victorian England. He does this very well.  Visual clues are substituted for much of Wilde's dialogue. In my opinion a bit too much.On a more positive note, the visual interpretation might inspire viewers to read the play or see an original staged version.This is not a bad film. It has the look of a good TV movie and is worth viewing. I suggest that people interst in Oscar Wilde read the play first, then see a good stage production or get the 1952 Anthony Asquith version, then see this film.

Surely, there is more to this than the obvious.""Remember that we are talking about WASPs: White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.  Do emphasize Protestant.  This is the saving grace for American/English cultures for centuries now.  Even with this new deal of Urban Chic, truly democratic in nature, plaid is dominant and rules (smile).  Anyway, in this movie and in life, it is very important to approach problem solving with the earnestness of a saint, which is to be as good as you possibly can while adhering to the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you).  The Bible speaks of Expediency as being the soul of Christianity.  Thus, you do the best you can to achieve the best results for the majority of the people.  In this story, our protagonists all are earnest in love, and are classical WASPs.  Being earnest far outweighs the name Ernest: It is enough for the idealist, when material things don't matter; It comforts the cynical soul; and it causes love to endure and thrive.Lastly, some ladies cherish the name Ernest, while it is notorious to some gentlemen.  And Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench), in all earnestness, being mindful of ""her"" origins, decides that an earnest, gallant rogue is better than any ""mama's boy"" named Ernest, when she manipulates fate by an earnest lie, and facilitates a love match.

He adds excitement to his life by assuming different identities. In town he is ""Ernest the Bachelor"" and in the country ""Jack the Provincial Justice of the Peace."" He maintains a bachelor apartment in Albany and a country estate where he has the responsibility of being guardian to Cecily. He escapes to London by train, to enter his own fantasy world where he can flirt recklessly with Gwendolyn Fairfax who has always imagined she would fall in love with a man named Ernest and give him her undying devotion.It is interesting to note that in a world of society drama, audiences enjoyed seeing images of their own aesthetic paradise on display. In the Nineteenth Century, many Englishmen were in fact living the life of ""Jack"" in the country and ""Ernest"" in the city.Jack seems to falter in the area of romance on numerous occasions and almost seems locked behind a door of somber decorum. Gwendolyn breaks from her chains in a ""metaphysical speculation"" moment. She represents the inner desires of all the characters, yet she is the first to take action in the direction of her dreams. You have to love that she travels with her diary so she always has something sensational to read.In the meantime Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon), a sweet country rose, has built up her own fantasy life complete with knights and the desire to be rescued from her prison and her tutor, Miss Prism.She too desires to find a man named Ernest and willingly makes up entries in her diary and even writes herself love letters from her imaginary knight. In her life, ""the essence of romance is uncertainty."" Yet, she truly almost dreams her knight into life.The story really centers around two couples and the meddling Aunt Agusta who is absolutely entertaining. Judi Dench perfects the role of Lady Bracknell and had played the part before. As Gwendolen's mother she assumes the role of protector of her daughters purity and yet she herself realizes that love transcends social barriers.All the characters are living lives in which they at first seem to be escaping vicariously into their fantasies. The true awakening comes when they take action to bring these ideas to fruition.After Ernest visits London, all the characters end up back in the country where the real fun begins. After Algernon is tempted by thoughts of the innocent and beautiful ward Cecily waiting to be plucked from her country garden, this story becomes a comedy of errors with clever romantic twists. The mischievous Algernon pretends to be Jack's naughty brother and succeeds in convincing Cecily that he is in fact ""Ernest.""Lady Bracknell's refusal to allow Ernest to marry her daughter sets off a series of events which threatens both couples romantic dreams. Suddenly there are two men named Ernest. A name known to ""inspire absolute confidence.""Once Cecily meets Gwendolyn they even read one another's diaries and give their men a delicious little taunting session that is both cheeky and wicked.Oliver Parker includes a poem by Oscar Wilde as a song in this scene to subtly change the atmosphere from conflict to passion.SerenadeThe western wind is blowing fairAcross the dark Aegean sea,And at the secret marble stairMy Tyrian galley waits for thee.Come down! the purple sail is spread,The watchman sleeps within the town,O leave thy lily-flowered bed,O Lady mine come down, come down!-Oscar WildeWilde was known for his wit and penchant for lilies. He was often seen strolling through Picadilly Circus in London wearing a shirt silk, velvet coat, silk stockings and a lily in hand. As a tribute, men and women wore lilies to the performances in London.Director Oliver Parker has added a beautiful touch of flamboyance to this film. This movie is best viewed with an unprejudiced eye. Perhaps it is true that ""Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone."" The less you know about the play the more you might enjoy this film.This movie is a beautiful ripe peach dripping with delicious English wit.Rather Delicious Actually!~The Rebecca Review",5,Wickedly

Unfortunately, the lie gains a life of its own--as that brother, he falls in love with Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor), the daughter of Lady Augusta Bracknell (Judi Dench).When his best friend Algi (Rupert Everett) decides to come to Worthing's country estate, he comes as Ernest and falls for Worthing's ward Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspooon).Of course, both women can only love a man who is Ernest.  Well, particularly poor Gwen who has impulsively tattooed the name of her beloved on her bum.  The ensuing hilarity and confusion of identity will have you laughing through most of the film.""In matters of utmost importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing,"" so says Gwendolen.  And in the end, being earnest is the critical issue.I saw the original film long ago on the suggestion of my mother, who thought the story was one of the funniest she'd ever read.  She was right, of course, but I think this new version is the one I'd pass along to the younger generations.  Firth, Witherspoon, and Dench are standouts--if it's possible to have such a thing in an ensemble cast such as this.I rented this film, but I'm planning on purchasing the DVD.

718311,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006JDVX,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","Writer/director Oliver Parker, who gave us a superb ""Othello"" in 1995 and a very fine ""An Ideal Husband"" in 1999, works his magic yet a third time with ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" a high-spirited adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy of manners.  In adapting the play to the screen, Parker has managed to unshackle the work from its stage confines, allowing the action to occur in many different locales, often out of doors.  This expansion of the play's geography gives the plot a certain looseness and forward momentum that nicely complements the lightning-paced nature of Wilde's original dialogue.The theme of the play is, of course, reflected in the name of the work itself, which, in true Wilde fashion, utilizes a clever play on words to make its point.  The ""earnest"" of the title serves a double function, referring to both the importance of honesty, truthfulness and frankness in human relations and to the fact that two men are displaying anything but those virtues when they commandeer the name Ernest as a pseudonym to advance their own selfish causes.  It is Algy and Jack, the two main characters of the piece, who learn that there is a high price to be paid for dishonesty and deception, for those two vices routinely lead to the kinds of interpersonal complications and misunderstandings from which it is often hard to extricate oneself.  Wilde has fashioned a clever, ingeniously structured plot that employs wit, romance, and gentle social satire to make his point painlessly and effectively.The wonderful cast, which includes Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon, Judi Dench, Frances O'Connor, Anna Massey and Edward Fox, does a superb job hitting just the right note in conveying the lighthearted wit of the text.  Moreover, the film has been sumptuously shot on location in England and boasts exquisite costumes and set design that beautifully reflect the 19th Century period in which the story is set.""The Importance of Being Earnest"" provides both a pleasant diversion for the Wilde aficionado and a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with the author and his works.

718320,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,B00006JDVX,Skywalker,"[0, 0]","Sometimes I ask myself whether this classical piece of English-Victorian comedy, Oscar Wilde's masterpiece and one of the most original and funny theatre plays I know (and I do know some) will ever be adequately turned into a film. Once more, the high potential was destroyed by mistakes which nipped all good intentions in the bud.Just for a starter, one couldn't say that there is anything with this film that doesn't really work. The actors are well-chosen and play well, the costumes rich and exact in detail, the film paces well and never gets boring, and then there are... the settings. These have more than irritated me here. In the original text they change little (we have Algernon's apartment, Jack / Earnest's country house outside and then inside); and although the many different settings in this film almost all look great, they are too much - both too many and too beautiful, making you feel almost as if you were watching a fairy tale.And that is precisely the point: ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is a sociocritical, very exactly observed satire, not a fairy tale or a love story where all that matters is whether the two couples will find one another in the end. The marvellous pictures have an irritating tendency to distract the viewer from the actual content: the brilliant texts and dialogues, the characters portrayed with gentle tease, prejudices, clich&eacute;s and relationships which were so typical for the society Wilde belonged to. While reading the play I laughed much more during one act than here during the whole running time.My guess is that the producers thought that today's viewers will not be in a position to understand the - rather more than less - subtle hints and side blows to the time and society this story is set in. That may be true, but the play did not win anything by being sugar-coated, on the contrary. I suggest everyone who is interested to watch the film once and then to read the text with friends in the different roles, and you will soon see that the whole plot will become much funnier. Or, if you want to save time, just spare yourself this film.

It is still a very good movie and is highly enjoyable. It just doesn't quite make the 5-star list.""An Ideal Husband"" is one of my favorite DVDs. So, when I heard that the same people were making an adaptation of ""Importance of being Earnest,"" I couldn't wait to see it. Then I heard that the cast was going to include some of my favorite actors, so my expectations went up even more.For the most part, the cast does deliver in a big way. Judi Dench, in particular, is marvelous. Firth does a great job and Frances O'Connor is very good.The two other main cast members (Everett and Witherspoon) are a bit of a disappointment. Especially Witherspoon! She is completely mis-cast in this role. She seems too old for the role. And though it seems that she spent long hours with a voice coach to develop an English accent, it doesn't ring true. Her whole presence on the screen has a feeling of wrong-ness that I can't get over. Everett - who was so good in 'Ideal Husband' - does a passable job here, but just does not quite nail it all the way through.As for the other aspects of the film, I give it high marks but not the highest. The direction is very good. It basically suceeds in getting all the comedic timing and pacing right. But the witty Wilde dialogue does not come across with the crispness that I had hoped for. It's ok, but it doesn't grab you the way that it should. Costumes, sets, supporting cast are all excellent. Some of the departures from the original Wilde text are a bit maddening; others though are quite funny (I admit that I laughed out loud at the tatoo scenes).In summary: I enjoyed this film. However, it is not the kind of movie I'm going to watch over and over again. It's pretty darn good, but does not achieve greatness.

Almost perfect performances by GORGEOUS actors and actresses upon beautiful costumes design, greenest of the countryside, and exquisite interior decorations. This Oscar Wilde adaption will no doubt remain timeless for the next three decades at least before another remake emerges in Hollywood.Everything's so agreeable except Reese Witherspoon's cast here... Parker must have been mistaken for Christ sake! Witherspoon is so NOT right for the choice. Her indifferent beauty and bubbly profile are totally incompatible with the rest of the casts - who has got the lordly Englishness. She plays the &quot;ward&quot; of Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) who's kept and schooled in his country house, no wonder.",4,GOOD except some...,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,786,"['Brilliant', 'lovely', 'impeccable', 'casting', 'entire', 'Oliver', 'Parker', 'production', 'team', 'Almost', 'perfect', 'performances', 'GORGEOUS', 'actors', 'upon', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'design', 'greenest', 'countryside', 'exquisite', 'interior', 'decorations', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'adaption', 'will', 'doubt', 'remain', 'timeless', 'next', 'three', 'decades', 'least', 'remake', 'Hollywood.Everything', 'so', 'agreeable', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'cast', 'here', 'Parker', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'mistaken', 'Christ', 'sake', 'Witherspoon', 'so', 'NOT', 'right', 'choice', 'indifferent', 'beauty', 'bubbly', 'profile', 'are', 'totally', 'incompatible', 'rest', 'casts', 'who', 'got', 'lordly', 'Englishness', 'quot', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Worthing', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'kept', 'schooled', 'country', 'house', 'wonder']",The Importance of Being Earnest

The costumes and acting are great & of course you can never go wrong with Judi Dench.  It is a fun romp through the english country side as Rupert & Colin both play the imaginary Ernest.  Very funny with great back ground scenery and clothing of the period.  Very cute film and a definite recommend if you're in the mood for something light and airy.

Oscar Wilde's script is, well, wild.The basic plan is a Shakespearian comedy of mistaken identities and people of unknown origins, later revealed. Throw in a few outstanding actors: Judy Dench as the grande dame, Reese Witherspoon as the sweet young thing (but watch the claws), Frances O'Connor as the thoroughly modern young lady - the list goes on, but the casting was a work of art in itself. Now add Wilde's solemn-faced japes at the moneyed (and sometimes un-moneyed), mannered (sometimes ill-mannered) classes. It's a classic.
