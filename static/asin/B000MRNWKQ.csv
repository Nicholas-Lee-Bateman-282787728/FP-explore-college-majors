Well, what do you get if you take ""Top Gun,"" ""Fright Night,"" and maybe ""The Exorcist"" (my apologies to William Peter Blatty), mix them up and make a movie?  Well, a mess, of course.  But you also get ""Succubus,"" a film that will really suck the life out of you.  And probably about an hour and a half of your time.Shot with an HD camcorder (most likely) bought off this site, the production values are, well, values.  'Cause they surely didn't spend much to get those values.  It is in 16 x 9, but it still streamed cropped through my Roku 1080P box.  The audio is legible but nothing special, and some of the music gave me a chuckle or two.I did get a good laugh out of the Gary Busey character here.  What I want to know is:  what was with the cat litter in the back of his SUV next to the crossbow and silver arrows?  Surely they could have removed the cat litter before shooting, or was that supposed to be comic relief?  Or perhaps do you need cat litter to kill a succubus?  I don't know, and hopefully, I never find out.I needed to watch a movie with a Succubus in it for believe-it-or-not research purposes, and this was the only one that I could find on Amazon that was available through streaming.  So that was why I selected this devilishly-bad film.  Oh, well.  I did get a few laughs, but hopefully I will forget about this movie very soon.  Like now.

If not for sexy Natalie Denise Sperl and her well-chosen tight, body hugging costume, this movie ought to be redone with better research and hotter action.Natalie Denise Sperl plays Lilith the Succubus who comes into a playboy's life and teaches him what commitment really means! If the aim of the movie is a lesson to playboys, it doesn't deliver the message enough.The producers did one thing almost right: the Succubus summoning spell used in the movie mimics an actual spell! It's been modified of course.Summoning such demons are a very easy thing to do. The unfortunate thing that people have to deal with is banishing them. You can't banish Succubi with garlic, guns, nunchakus, cartoon medallions - those last secenes in the movie need to be redone! Looks like someone wanted to rush through the production. Rigid plastic props as wings for Succubus Lilith? Ha, ha, ha!I can produce a better movie than this one!Playboys beware!

The film attempts to make his dad (David Keith) look bad for shutting him out, but Adam is the kid you would want to go play in traffic.

Adam leaves, but Lilith (Natalie Denise Sperl) manages to find him anyway and soon the killings begin.

Our Succubus should have been the hottest woman in the film, but didn't look as good as the bikini eye candy background or support female cast. The top stars were on the screen for only a moment and the whole &#34;Top Gun&#34; scene which was written to support a few cute lines, made no sense outside of that.The film appeared like it was supposed to be a campy comedy-horror film, but for some reason writer/director Kim Bass didn't know how to make a bad film by design, instead made one by accident.Parental Guide: F-bomb.
