As much as I like to see them the way I remember them, it would be great if the sound quality was at least as good as it was on Volumes 2, 3, 4. I found them to be of better quality.

In fact, until this first volume came out, I never even knew it existed.  One day, while searching for a good DVD for my daughter, I decided to give this a try.  What I found was one of the best children's shows around.  ""Davey and Goliath"" are, simply put, two of the best characters you could ever introduce your child to.  This particular volume features four classic episodes and one bonus story.  The four fifteen minute episodes are:  The Kite, Finders Keepers, Blind Man's Bluff, and Stranded On An Island.  ""To The Rescue"" is the special thirty minute bonus story.  Also included is ""Oh, Davey!"" which is a retrospective look back at the making of and the influence of the characters and the stories.Produced by the Lutheran Church in America between 1962 and 1975 and the creators of ""Gumby,"" this series about a young boy and his dog live life by standards set by God.  This Christian based TV series is well worth viewing, no matter what your religion.  Personally, I'm a Catholic, and I see nothing wrong with the moral values young Davey and Goliath teach children.  You see the consequences of doing wrong things like telling lies, stealing, and not sharing.  ""Blind Man's Bluff"" takes on the very serious issue of racism.Unfortunately, a series such as this would find it hard to be placed on television these days for the simple fact that our society has become so caught up in not offending anyone.  How dare you teach Christian morals and values to children!  Watch this wonderful DVD with your children and be prepared to handle any questions the stories may generate.Simply wonderful and recommended to anyone who wants their child to grow up with strong morals and values.",5,A Wonderful Gift For Any Child,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,1741,"['was', 'never', 'familiar', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'fact', 'first', 'volume', 'came', 'out', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'existed', 'One', 'day', 'searching', 'good', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'children', 'shows', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'are', 'simply', 'put', 'two', 'best', 'characters', 'could', 'ever', 'introduce', 'child', 'particular', 'volume', 'features', 'four', 'classic', 'episodes', 'one', 'bonus', 'story', 'four', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'episodes', 'are', 'Kite', 'Finders', 'Keepers', 'Blind', 'Man', 'Bluff', 'Stranded', 'Island', 'Rescue', 'special', 'thirty', 'minute', 'bonus', 'story', 'Also', 'included', 'Oh', 'Davey', 'retrospective', 'look', 'back', 'making', 'influence', 'characters', 'stories.Produced', 'Lutheran', 'Church', 'America', '1962', '1975', 'creators', 'Gumby', 'series', 'young', 'boy', 'dog', 'live', 'life', 'standards', 'set', 'God', 'Christian', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'matter', 'what', 'religion', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'Catholic', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'moral', 'values', 'young', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'teach', 'children', 'see', 'consequences', 'doing', 'wrong', 'things', 'telling', 'lies', 'stealing', 'not', 'sharing', 'Blind', 'Man', 'Bluff', 'very', 'serious', 'issue', 'racism.Unfortunately', 'series', 'such', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'be', 'placed', 'television', 'days', 'simple', 'fact', 'society', 'become', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'not', 'offending', 'anyone', 'How', 'dare', 'teach', 'Christian', 'morals', 'values', 'children', 'Watch', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'children', 'be', 'prepared', 'handle', 'questions', 'stories', 'may', 'generate.Simply', 'wonderful', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'child', 'grow', 'up', 'strong', 'morals', 'values']",N/A

I wondered how my own children would like them and if the show would stand the test of time as I haven't seen it probably since a child.  I am quite happy to say the show did pass both tests.  I sat down with my children, 11, 8, 4 and my grandson 4, to watch volume 1.  Davey & Goliath kept their attention.  The topics covered by the shows are just as current and pertinent today as it was back then.  I found the wit and humor used in the show very good.  My wife did criticize some of the claymation saying she couldn't tell for sure what some of the background things were supposed to be.  So state of the art it may not be but as I told her that is not why people will by Davey & Goliath.  The skits are good and teach children a lesson without them realizing they are being taught.  I like the fact that the show portrays Davey in a nuclear family with a mother & father, I like Davey & Goliath's interaction with and in the community, I like that it shows the children outside playing, flying kites etc.  The show teaches good basic principles of life I can't imagine any parent not wanting their child to pick up on, honesty, respect, being helpful, diversity, for examples. Speaking to diversity for a moment, Davey and his family are White but there are people of color in the show, friends and people in the community.  Kids today definitely have better TV viewing choices than I did as a child with more educational cartoons and Discovery channels and the like but Davey & Goliath bring other aspects of life into the mix.  They are able to entertain your child while conveying to them holsom principles.
