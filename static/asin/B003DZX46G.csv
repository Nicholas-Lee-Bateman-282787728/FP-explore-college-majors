1337557,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B003DZX46G,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 2]","Family Guy is one of those shows famous for randomly flipping your lid.Always the unexpected is discussed and said on everything from ""prom night dumpster babies"" to matricide (on the part of Stewie of course). Now this eigth volume of Family Guy does contain many episodes such as the Miley Cyrus send up ""Hannah Banana"". But possibly because series creator Seth MacFarlane was at this point preparing to launch the first major Family Guy spinoffThe Cleveland Show(the first season of which ran almost paralell to this) he decided it was time to change some of the focus of this show. With episodes such as ""Fox-Y Lady"",""Episode 420"" and ""Family Goy"" there is a concerted attempt to steer this show from less comic satire towards more impassioned social commentary. Where the subjects of Fox News,legalized marjuana and religion would've been the object of tremendous random comedy in the past the treatments of them in this season tend to be more serious to the point of being even mildly preachy. The episodes are all very well written and done but it's a different approch to Family Guy. Of course the concept that Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh are both characters portrayed by Fred Savage is CLASSIC Seth MacFarlane!Also of note in this season is the large amount of ""Brian having romantic issues"" episodes there are. In this season he's portrayed far more in a dysfunctional manner than he was in previous seasons;as a severe alcohalic with shallow views on women and it all culminates in one very compelling scene where Quagmire,a character only portrayed as a one dimentional sex fiend until this point,actually explains VERY intelligently and with intense detail the reasons for his dislike of Brian,of which we all knew nothing about until this time. Quagmire is another character changed during this season. With the  absent Cleavland the ensamble dynamic among Peter's friends and wild antics aren't as evident and Quagmire's character is altered to show what a dysfunctional and tormented character he actually is underneath his sexually devient behavior. Of course this also has one of the series most inventive and hilarious moments in ""Road To The Multiverse"" episode,which is a sure fire highlite of the season as well and also a reminder of the things we liked about Family Guy to start with.Being this all is fairly recent in terms of age it's unclear even now where Family Guy is going. Starting here there seems to be attempts to turn the show toward a more ""dramedy"" direction,giving characters this very weighty sense of depth and dimension that may tend to take a bit away from the shows comic irreverence and wildness. Sort of reminds me of one time in an earlier season where Peter speaks of MASH ""before Alan Alda took over and the show got all dramatic and preachy"". I don't think Family Guy has gotton that way yet exactly and those elements could be mere growing pains while the writers of the show try to deal with the departure of a major character but we'll have to see from here on where the series goes.",4,"Outlandishly Entertaining,Yet Not Quite The Same",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3040,"['Family', 'Guy', 'one', 'shows', 'famous', 'randomly', 'flipping', 'lid.Always', 'unexpected', 'discussed', 'said', 'everything', 'prom', 'night', 'dumpster', 'babies', 'matricide', 'part', 'Stewie', 'course', 'Now', 'eigth', 'volume', 'Family', 'Guy', 'contain', 'many', 'episodes', 'such', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'send', 'up', 'Hannah', 'Banana', 'possibly', 'series', 'creator', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'was', 'point', 'preparing', 'launch', 'first', 'major', 'Family', 'Guy', 'spinoffThe', 'Cleveland', 'Show', 'first', 'season', 'ran', 'almost', 'paralell', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'change', 'focus', 'show', 'episodes', 'such', 'Fox-Y', 'Lady', 'Episode', '420', 'Family', 'Goy', 'concerted', 'attempt', 'steer', 'show', 'less', 'comic', 'satire', 'towards', 'more', 'impassioned', 'social', 'commentary', 'Where', 'subjects', 'Fox', 'News', 'legalized', 'marjuana', 'religion', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'object', 'tremendous', 'random', 'comedy', 'past', 'treatments', 'season', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'point', 'being', 'even', 'mildly', 'preachy', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'done', 'different', 'approch', 'Family', 'Guy', 'course', 'concept', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'are', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'CLASSIC', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'Also', 'note', 'season', 'large', 'amount', 'Brian', 'having', 'romantic', 'issues', 'are', 'season', 'portrayed', 'far', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'manner', 'was', 'previous', 'seasons', 'severe', 'alcohalic', 'shallow', 'views', 'women', 'culminates', 'one', 'very', 'compelling', 'scene', 'where', 'Quagmire', 'character', 'only', 'portrayed', 'one', 'dimentional', 'sex', 'fiend', 'point', 'actually', 'VERY', 'intelligently', 'intense', 'detail', 'reasons', 'dislike', 'Brian', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'time', 'Quagmire', 'character', 'changed', 'season', 'absent', 'Cleavland', 'ensamble', 'dynamic', 'Peter', 'friends', 'wild', 'antics', 'are', ""n't"", 'evident', 'Quagmire', 'character', 'altered', 'show', 'what', 'dysfunctional', 'tormented', 'character', 'actually', 'underneath', 'sexually', 'devient', 'behavior', 'course', 'also', 'one', 'series', 'most', 'inventive', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Road', 'Multiverse', 'episode', 'sure', 'fire', 'highlite', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'reminder', 'things', 'liked', 'Family', 'Guy', 'start', 'with.Being', 'fairly', 'recent', 'terms', 'age', 'unclear', 'even', 'now', 'where', 'Family', 'Guy', 'going', 'Starting', 'here', 'there', 'be', 'attempts', 'turn', 'show', 'more', 'dramedy', 'direction', 'giving', 'characters', 'very', 'weighty', 'sense', 'depth', 'dimension', 'may', 'tend', 'take', 'bit', 'away', 'shows', 'comic', 'irreverence', 'wildness', 'Sort', 'reminds', 'one', 'time', 'earlier', 'season', 'where', 'Peter', 'speaks', 'MASH', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'took', 'over', 'show', 'got', 'dramatic', 'preachy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Family', 'Guy', 'gotton', 'way', 'yet', 'exactly', 'elements', 'could', 'be', 'mere', 'growing', 'pains', 'writers', 'show', 'try', 'deal', 'departure', 'major', 'character', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'here', 'where', 'series']","Family Guy, Volume Eight"

It used to be irreverent, hilarious, off-color; it still is all those things, but now the humor is forced and self-aware.  I direct your attention to the scrolling text of SOMETHING, SOMETHING DARK SIDE for proof (and the fact that this hour-long episode, available on DVD for months, was used as the finale for the most recent season).Still, all is not lost, as this collection shows.  ""Road to the Multiverse"" is clever, with some classic FAMILY GUY moments.  ""Three Kings"" is one of my personal favorite episodes, not merely because I'm a Stephen King fan, but because the first segment (""Stand By Me"") is reminiscent of everything that once made FAMILY GUY great.  Other episodes included here are great, though some--I'm looking at you, ""420""--merely showcase Seth MacFarlane's ever-increasing ego.  Ultimately, the show is still a strong point, and one of the few reasons to turn on your television.  It's still going downhill, of course, and fans will probably discard it in the next season or two.

I can't agree and I say this after three viewings- a different mood and different room for each viewing.Now I've always enjoyed the brilliance of Seth McFarland and ""Family Guy"" but it never really rose above the status of Saturday Night Live in regard to social commentary and humor. Now keep in mind that I am 49 years old so that SNL to me is the Hey Day when Lorne Michaels had the clout to tell NBC execs to shut up and they all ignored the smell of pot coming off the 14th floor of 30 Rock. But ""Family Guy 8"" Is indeed different than it's previous works. It isn't that it is of lower quality however - far from it - it is that it is of a much higher quality than has ever been achieved before. There are many, many inside jokes, but plenty for everyone. Certainly the better informed you are the more you will laugh at these jokes. The characters remain REAL Characters because we continue to love them. Not one of you hasn't formed deep opinions of Brian, Stewie, Peter Lois and even poor Chris and Meg.But Family Guy is, at last, not just taking pot shots at the problems within our socio-political climate, but they're pointing out ways in which things could be better. Little Stewie, requiring a diaper change has more common sense than King George did during his entire presidency. And Stewie's anger is really what ours SHOULD be. This volume pokes fun at everyone, including ""Family Guy"" and Seth McFarland himself. But if you failed to notice that it was also poking light fun at YOU, then you're likely to give this a medicore review. And you have missed the best part of this DVD set.Me? Well I can take it. I can laugh at myself aznd I have no qualms about learning about myself and self-improvement. I think it's healthy to re-think about socio-political events and when a cartoon character can do this for me, well they damn well blow""The FLintstones"" or ""the Simpsons"" out of the water.This one's the best so far, folks. Trust me. And for those of you who reviewed it so quickly, go back and watch it again and again. You'll grow wiser each time and you will laugh every time; laughter is the best way to learn. No expense has been spared, from the hiring of the beswt Hollywood starss, to the copyrights to classic Broadway Melodies for re-writing. Whomever does the sindie lyric writing there could give a run to Steve Sondheim. When Brian presents a very smart and logical reason to legalize pot, McFarland counters it with enough to think about as to why ity's illegal.

Other gems in this bunch are the story of Peter's past life as a founder of the Quahog colony, the condensed re-telling of Stephen King stories: ""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"", and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", Quagmire as a dad, the Star Trek: The Next Generation cast hanging out with Stewie, and a ""Spies Like Us"" spin-off featuring the actual voices of Chevy Chase and Dan Dan Aykroyd.In this set, the evolution of ""Family Guy"" has led to an increase in live-action style camera angles over the shoulder while characters are talking, digital animation, and more fancy computer sequences. The comedic timing is as sharp as ever, the cut-aways more random and hilarious, and the songs are very catchy.Bonus Features:There is commentary on almost every episode by Seth MacFarlane, writers, directors, producers, and other cast members. There are also a bunch of deleted scenes and a full script for the episode ""Road to the Multiverse"" featuring pencil sketches of some of the characters!The Road to Road to the Multiverse featurette talks about the episode being another ""Road To"" Brian and Stewie adventure and how the premise was like the sci-fi television show ""Sliders"" where the characters would ""slide"" to different dimensions all the time. They talk about how they grabbed Disney animators to gain authenticity for the ""Wonderful Day for Pie"" scene.One of my favorite bonus features is Family Guy karaoke where you can literally follow the bouncing ball to the lyrics of Family Guy songs: ""Gotta Give Up the Toad"", ""Left Foot, Right Foot"", ""Road to Rhode Island"", ""Hic-A-Doo-La"", ""You've Got A Lot To See"", ""My Fat Baby Loves To Eat"", ""You Do!"", ""You And I Are So Awfully Different"", ""Buy Me A Rainbow"", ""You Have AIDS"", ""The FCC Song"", ""When We Swing"", ""Shipoopi"", ""Noble Indian Chief"", ""(In God's Eyes) Everybody's Hot"", ""This Is One Fine Day To Be Nude"", ""Evil Monkey Song"", ""My Black Son"", ""Drunken Irish Dad"", ""Prom Night Dumpster Baby"", ""Sodomy"", ""Me & Jesus"", ""I Like Farts"", ""G-Chord"", ""The Handi-Quacks Theme Song"", ""The Pot Song"", ""The Friendship Song"", and finally ""It's a Wonderful Day for Pie.""

I may still rent them from Netflix or something, but I'm glad I waited until the price came down into the mid-twenties on this one before buying it.Family Guy has gone downhill, and badly. What used to be a show that made me burst out laughing in most of its episodes has degenerated into something where the most I'll get out of it is a chuckle and a sense of anger about what these guys have started thinking is funny. To the writers: graphic violence isn't funny. Why is there so much of it? For the record, I liked the graphically violent movie Hot Fuzz, so it isn't the gore per se that bothers me. It's that they try to play it for laughs, and I can't think of a single time that it hasn't been way more gross than funny (incidentally, this is one of the reasons I don't enjoy South Park as much as I could). Even bits that I thought were funny, like the guy who eats the Peppermint Pattie and has to make an arduous journey back home from the frozen mountain top, include this garbage for no reason. When that one ended with the guy engaging in graphic cannibalism, I think I might have even said out loud, ""And we're back to this s@#! again.""Evil Stewie was much funnier than Gay Stewie. Goofy Jerk Peter was much funnier than Completely Stupid Peter. When I watch some of the older episodes, I still laugh out loud, often. Even some of the jokes that I didn't think were all that great back then seem like comedy gold compared to most of the junk in this series.To top it off, the show has become almost unbearably preachy. The episodes about legalizing pot and where Meg finds religion didn't even seem like they were *trying* to be funny. They just felt like somebody on a soapbox ranting. At least when South Park gets preachy (one of the other big reasons I don't like that show), they keep the jokes going. It's telling and sad that one of my favorite moments of this DVD series was when Quagmire lays into Brian and enumerates the many ways that he's a complete jerk.I'm giving this two stars instead of one because there are still some sparks of funny left in the show. But if they can't do better than this, then maybe it's time to hang it up and move on.",2,"No more for me, thanks",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,2243,"['watching', 'volume', '8', 'think', ""'m"", 'done', 'buying', 'Family', 'Guy', 'sets', 'may', 'still', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'something', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'price', 'came', 'down', 'mid-twenties', 'one', 'buying', 'it.Family', 'Guy', 'gone', 'downhill', 'badly', 'What', 'used', 'be', 'show', 'made', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'most', 'episodes', 'degenerated', 'something', 'where', 'most', ""'ll"", 'get', 'chuckle', 'sense', 'anger', 'what', 'guys', 'have', 'started', 'thinking', 'funny', 'writers', 'graphic', 'violence', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Why', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'record', 'liked', 'graphically', 'violent', 'movie', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', ""n't"", 'gore', 'se', 'bothers', 'try', 'play', 'laughs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'way', 'more', 'gross', 'funny', 'incidentally', 'one', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'South', 'Park', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'Even', 'thought', 'were', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'Peppermint', 'Pattie', 'make', 'arduous', 'journey', 'back', 'home', 'frozen', 'mountain', 'top', 'include', 'garbage', 'reason', 'When', 'one', 'ended', 'guy', 'engaging', 'graphic', 'cannibalism', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'said', 'out', 'loud', ""'re"", 'back', 's', '@', 'again', 'Evil', 'Stewie', 'was', 'much', 'funnier', 'Gay', 'Stewie', 'Goofy', 'Jerk', 'Peter', 'was', 'much', 'funnier', 'Completely', 'Stupid', 'Peter', 'When', 'watch', 'older', 'episodes', 'still', 'out', 'loud', 'often', 'Even', 'jokes', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'great', 'back', 'then', 'seem', 'comedy', 'gold', 'compared', 'most', 'junk', 'series.To', 'top', 'off', 'show', 'become', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'preachy', 'episodes', 'legalizing', 'pot', 'where', 'Meg', 'religion', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'were', '*trying*', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'felt', 'somebody', 'soapbox', 'ranting', 'least', 'when', 'South', 'Park', 'preachy', 'one', 'other', 'big', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'keep', 'jokes', 'going', 'telling', 'sad', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'DVD', 'series', 'was', 'when', 'Quagmire', 'Brian', 'many', 'ways', 'complete', 'jerk.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'are', 'still', 'sparks', 'funny', 'left', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'then', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'move']","Family Guy, Volume Eight"

The few clever lines and gags are buried in ridiculous segments and storylines.  The Star Trek actors segment is just silly.  There is nothing clever or funny about it.  They have a 50 year old woman talking and acting like someone who would've been dead for most likely the last 20 years.  Decent episodes like ""Not All Dogs Go To Heaven,"" ""Peter's Progress,"" and ""Hannah Banana"" are ruined by crummy endings.  One episode that is very clever and original is ""Road to the Multiverse.""  ""We Love You Conrad"" is another good one mainly because I like the air-headed Jillian character.  ""Three Kings"" is a fun change of pace and ""Dog Gone"" has its moments (good ones as well as head-scratching ones).  ""Stew-roid"" and ""Jerome Is the New Black"" are the better ones from the mediocre rest.  When a clip showing the Flintmobile on the World's Wildest Police Chases is the highlight of a volume, that is pretty bad.Disc 11. ""Fox-y Lady""--Lois becomes news anchor for Fox News and is put on an assignment to investigate Michael Moore.  Meanwhile, Peter and Chris collaborate on an animated show ""Handi-Quacks.""

Meg is bedridden with the mumps and finds religion from Kirk Cameron's televangelist show.  Brian admits to being an atheist, so in the hopes to cure him, Meg blabs it on the news making Brian Quahog's enemy #1.  The ending where Meg and Brian patch things up is a bit too easy, I think, and the ending is stupid.  It might actually have worked with Bob Newhart and the wife from his first television show in bed ala the last episode of ""Newhart.""  Meanwhile, Stewie kidnaps the Star Trek cast.  That part is lame.  The actors act like kids (note: The actor who played Capt. Picard is the voice of Avery Bullock on American Dad, so the characters are the same).  This episode had potential with the atheist theme, but fell completely flat.3. ""Episode 420""--Brian campaigns for the legalization of pot.  When Lois's father promises the publication of Brian's novel in exchange for him switching sides, will he sell out?4. ""Stew-roid""--Joe's baby girl beats up Stewie so Peter pumps him up with steroids. Stewie: ""It doesn't matter how you find the pot of gold, all that matters is that you beat the leprechauns.""  Connie, the most popular girl in school, goes out with Chris as a challenge.  when he disses her and becomes a jerk like the popular guys, Connie and Meg concoct revenge.5. ""We Love You Conrad""--I like the non-praying mantis (maybe he's an atheist).  Jillian is engaged to a great guy who speaks French (Jillian: ""He also speaks Orange!"" Derek: ""Mandarin, honey."" Jillian: ""Mandolin!"") and Brian is jealous even when he starts dating Lauren Conrad.Disc 26. ""Three Kings""--The Family Guy characters parody Stephen King novels ""Stand By Me"" (with Meg as the dead body), ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Joe's character is crippled in each segment.  An OK change of pace but the ending to ""Misery"" was a bit weak.7. ""Peter's Progress""--Madame Claude tells Peter and the gang who they were in a past life.  She tells the story of 17th or 18th century England when Peter was the founder of Quahog.  Lois's character is called Lady Redbush (ha!).  King Stewart the Turd exiles Griffin Peterson to America so he could marry Lois Redbush.  The ending was stupid.8. ""Road to the Multiverse""--Clever episode where Brian and Stewie visit parallel universes that show Family Guy in such styles as The Flintstones, Robot Chicken, and Disney.9. ""Family Goy""--Lois finds out her mother is Jewish.  At first Peter embraces Judaism until the spirit of his strict Catholic father tells him he will BURN!!! I n this uncensored episode, you get to see Peter's...um...peter.10. ""Spies Reminiscent of Us""--Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase move into Cleveland's old house and Brian and Stewie find out they're actually spies.  Meanwhile, to prove he's funny, Peter and the gang start an improv act.  This episode is lame.11. ""Brian Has a Brand New Bag""--This episode is embarrassingly bad.  Brian dates a 50 year old and his family gives him grief about it.  It makes no sense.  She was 50 in 2009 when the show aired, so she was born in 1959.  She spent her adolescence probably watching the Brady Bunch and her late teens at the discos.  She wouldn't use old fashioned words like ""chesterfield.""  They make her character as though she was born in the 1910s.  Ridiculous!Disc 312. ""Hannah Banana""--Stewie has to see Miley Cyrus in concert and threatens Brian's brothers and sisters to get him in (that was pretty funny).  Chris captures the evil monkey and he becomes a father figure.  The end of the Miley Cyrus thing was a bit much.13. ""Quagmire's Baby""--The Flintstone police chase clip might be the highlight of this entire volume.  Quagmire's baby girl is left on his doorstep and she is cramping his style.  Meanwhile, Stewie experiments with cloning.  The Quagmire/baby thing was unoriginal.14. ""Jerome is the New Black""--The gang thinks they've found a replacement for Cleveland until Peter finds out he once slept with Lois. Also, Quagmire lets Brian have it!  Dang!15. ""Dog Gone""--Brian is excited about being honored by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence until he finds out the ""Special"" is for ""special ed.""  He gets drunk and hits and kills a dog.  He buries the carcass but is racked with guilt.  When he confesses, he is alarmed that no one cares and starts a movement for animal rights.  The meeting is lame.  They end up wanting to eat Brian, whatever!  Anyway, it is up to Stewie to make Brian see he has value to his family.  Meanwhile, Consuela (""need more lemon pledge"") becomes the Griffin's maid and drives Peter nuts.",3,"""This is a bigger ripoff than shrunky dinks""",1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,6055,"['volume',

I'm one of those people who sees enough violence on the news, and hears a lot of profanity in real life, that I prefer to watch the show in its televised format, which thankfully, is still available on the discs. I know, I sound like one of those few oddball fans, and you're probably thinking, &#34;Well, why do you watch the show, then?&#34; Because I do enjoy a lot of the sight gags and the humor. I love Seth MacFarlane's 80's references and Star Wars parodies, too. It's just that sometimes he goes a bit too far with the subject matter, so I either just look away, or like I said, watch the televised versions. I still enjoy the show, I just feel that he's taken a lot of liberties with the franchise now, and what he can do with it. Here's a sample of the episodes listed on the discs: Fox-y Lady, Lois gets a job newscasting for FOX, We Love You Conrad, Brian dates Lauren Conrad, Family Goy, Peter discovers that Lois is Jewish, and Hannah Banana, Stewie and Brian find out that Miley Cyrus is not all that she appears to be. I do like the show, I just wish that the violence wasn't so extreme sometimes. There's even an episode that I'm surprised there wasn't a PETA uprising because of it. Yes, it's THAT bad.

A good example would be the episode ""Road to Multiverse"" which is one of the greatest Family Guy episodes in recent years. I have noticed that the cursing in this show has become more relevant.

I think Family Guy has gone a little downhill yes but I still like it for what it is. Besides I think most customers visiting this page are actually interested in this volume DVD, the episodes it contains and they should know what to expect out of those 3 discs. If you're just here to complain well beat it, it's just a television show right? Maybe it's not as funny to you but I still get a good laugh out of watching the show and think it's still more entertaining than most of what is on television right now. Vol 8 has the seven remaining episodes of season 7 and the first eight of season 8 for a total of 15 episodes.Here are all of the episodes on Vol.8:1. FOX-y Lady2. Not All Dogs Go To Heaven3. 4204. Stew-Roids5. We Love You, Conrad6. Three Kings7. Peter's Progress8. Road To The Multiverse9. Family Goy10. Spies Reminiscent of Us11. Brian's Got a Brand New Bag12. Hannah Banana13. Quagmire's Baby14. Jerome is the New Black15. Dog GoneIt seems that even if some fans of the show didn't enjoy this season as much as the others ones they generally agree that there are a few great episodes on Vol 8 such as ""Road To The Multiverse"" and ""Stew-Roids"".  I also liked ""Quagmire's Baby"" and ""Three Kings"". I don't think Family Guy is done just yet but if they don't do something soon then it could be the end of the show. Fans brought the show out of cancellation and could very well put it back to that status. I don't think vol 9 will be that much better as I've seen most of those episodes ( ""Brian & Stewie"" was just a painful one to watch).And yes they still haven't done anything about the ""volumes"" DVD and you don't get a full season here, it's disappointing but that's what they've been doing since season 4 when they decided to split a season in two DVD's boxed set and I guess it's what Fox will continue to do so for future DVD releases. Yes I've bought this DVD even if I'd like actual season sets to be released because I enjoy Family Guy. I just wish they wouldn't charge as much for only 15 episodes in a cheap package, basically the same as season 7's, I also hope they don't discontinue the DVD version with the cover on it like they did for season 7 after a while that was just disappointing. There are still some good episodes on this Volume DVD, the show is not what it once was but it's still decent. 3 stars.",3,Ain't that great but doesn't suck either,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,2487,"['Look', 'point', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'complain', 'how', 'show', 'not', 'funny', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'fact', 'agree', 'think', 'Family', 'Guy', 'gone', 'little', 'downhill', 'yes', 'still', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'customers', 'visiting', 'page', 'are', 'actually', 'interested', 'volume', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'expect', '3', 'discs', ""'re"", 'just', 'here', 'complain', 'well', 'beat', 'just', 'television', 'show', 'right', 'Maybe', 'not', 'funny', 'still', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'watching', 'show', 'think', 'still', 'more', 'entertaining', 'most', 'what', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'Vol', '8', 'seven', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'season', '7', 'first', 'eight', 'season', '8', 'total', '15', 'are', 'episodes', 'Vol.8:1', 'FOX-y', 'Lady2', 'Not', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven3', '4204', 'Stew-Roids5', 'Love', 'Conrad6', 'Three', 'Kings7', 'Peter', 'Progress8', 'Road', 'Multiverse9', 'Family', 'Goy10', 'Spies', 'Reminiscent', 'Us11', 'Brian', 'Got', 'Brand', 'New', 'Bag12', 'Hannah', 'Banana13', 'Quagmire', 'Baby14', 'Jerome', 'New', 'Black15', 'Dog', 'GoneIt', 'even', 'fans', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'ones', 'generally', 'agree', 'are', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'Vol', '8', 'such', 'Road', 'Multiverse', 'Stew-Roids', 'also', 'liked', 'Quagmire', 'Baby', 'Three', 'Kings', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Family', 'Guy', 'done', 'just', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'soon', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'end', 'show', 'Fans', 'brought', 'show', 'cancellation', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'back', 'status', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'vol', '9', 'will', 'be', 'that', 'much', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'was', 'just', 'painful', 'one', 'watch', '.And', 'yes', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'volumes', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'season', 'here', 'disappointing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'season', '4', 'when', 'decided', 'split', 'season', 'two', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'guess', 'what', 'Fox', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'future', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'DVD', 'even', ""'d"", 'like', 'actual', 'season', 'sets', 'be', 'released', 'enjoy', 'Family', 'Guy', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'charge', 'as', 'much', 'only', '15', 'episodes', 'cheap', 'package', 'basically', 'same', 'season', '7', 'also', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'discontinue', 'DVD', 'version', 'cover', 'did', 'season', '7', 'while', 'was', 'just', 'disappointing', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'episodes', 'Volume', 'DVD', 'show', 'not', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'still', 'decent', '3', 'stars']","Family Guy, Volume Eight"
