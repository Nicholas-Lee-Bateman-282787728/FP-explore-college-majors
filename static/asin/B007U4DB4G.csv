Adults without kids may find this movie too silly to be enjoyable yet BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is full of charm and some humor for kids of all ages. Papi and Chloe are back with the kids and their ""humans"" have gotten a job in a very posh Beverly Hills hotel that caters to both humans and dogs.BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 is good natured and fun. It does go overboard in camp with dogs in costumes acting and talking like humans. Of course, that is the charm of the film. There is also a good lesson here for kids about accepting others who are different. The lesson centers around little Rosa, who is the runt of her parents' litter. She is small in size but huge in heart and dedication and will prove that dogs of all sizes are equals.This would be a fun movie to watch with young kids. I imagine the joy and wonder they would experience watching dogs dressing and acting like humans. It is less appealing for adults alone but I had my share of chuckles. Certainly, the scene of Chloe doing a piano recital (and a darn fantastic one) in front of an audience was priceless--that scene alone was worth watching.Although this movie was direct to video, the quality is A+ and it seems like BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 3 should have been a theatrical movie.
