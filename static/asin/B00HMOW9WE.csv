Her favorite movie is Frozen, and she also likes some of the Monster High movies, Scooby Doo and the Wild Kratts tv show.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was a story/plot to this movie.  Some of the music was a bit too non-princess like (rap, etc.), but overall, it has a good message and teaches children it's okay to be themselves.  There are many pop culture references that some young ones won't catch (like my daughter), but it's still possible to enjoy the show without prior knowledge.  I preferred the character of Rosie, as did my daughter.  They were both cute kids who did a good job.",5,"Cute movie, even if we didn't know who Sophia Grace and Rosie were before watching it",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,685,"['seven-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'saw', 'advertisement', 'movie', 'ordered', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Frozen', 'also', 'Monster', 'High', 'movies', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Wild', 'Kratts', 'tv', 'show', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'story/plot', 'movie', 'music', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'non-princess', 'rap', 'etc', 'overall', 'good', 'message', 'children', 'okay', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'young', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'daughter', 'still', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'show', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'preferred', 'character', 'Rosie', 'did', 'daughter', 'were', 'cute', 'kids', 'who', 'did', 'good', 'job']",Sophia Grace & Rosie: Royal Adventure
1690675,A41XDR2AM962G,B00HMOW9WE,DVD reviewer,"[7, 16]","Though they overact in the manner of way too many child actors, Sophia Grace & Rosie still impress with their ability to memorize scenes and play to reaction shots. I mean, they&#8217;re still only 11 and eight years old, and they really do an amazing job of just being professionals. But over the past three years it seems that the older cousin has gotten more full of herself and therefore more annoying . . . unless you&#8217;re a fan of &#34;Toddlers & Tiaras&#34; or are big fans of Sophia Grace & Rosie because you LIKE their act. Very little girls who are into pink and all things princess will enjoy this movie as well. But for everyone else? It&#8217;s like watching a Shirley Temple imitator at a talent contest who tries to act cute, rather than being cute and not knowing it. They&#8217;re great in small doses, but the girls make this 75-minute feature feel a lot longer&#8212;FamilyHomeTheater.com",2,"For very little girls who love princesses and all things pink, and people who like Toddlers & Tiaras",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,911,"['overact', 'manner', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'Sophia', 'Grace', 'Rosie', 'still', 'impress', 'ability', 'memorize', 'scenes', 'play', 'reaction', 'shots', 'mean', '8217', 're', 'still', 'only', '11', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'really', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'just', 'being', 'professionals', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'older', 'cousin', 'gotten', 'more', 'full', 'herself', 'therefore', 'more', 'annoying', '8217', 're', 'fan', '34', 'Toddlers', 'Tiaras', '34', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'Sophia', 'Grace', 'Rosie', 'LIKE', 'act', 'Very', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'pink', 'things', 'princess', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'else', '8217', 'watching', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'imitator', 'talent', 'contest', 'who', 'act', 'cute', 'rather', 'being', 'cute', 'not', 'knowing', '8217', 'great', 'small', 'doses', 'girls', 'make', '75-minute', 'feature', 'feel', 'lot', 'longer', '8212', 'FamilyHomeTheater.com']",Sophia Grace & Rosie: Royal Adventure

1690679,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00HMOW9WE,Ranny Levy,"[2, 2]","The movie Sophia Grace & Rosie&#8217;s Royal Adventure reminds me of a Cinderella fairy tale.  There are two bratty sisters and a very innocent one named Abigail.  It is similar to the Cinderella story because Abigail has two girls looking out for her as if they are her fairy godmothers. This movie is definitely an exciting royal adventure.The story begins when Sophia Grace and Rosie are sent on a special assignment to meet the princesses of Switzelvania to see which one will be crowned Queen.  However, they loose their guardian and become mistaken as the King&#8217;s great grand nieces.  They end up having to teach the King&#8217;s daughter, Princess Abigail, the ways of being a real princess.  In the process, they get thrown into a dungeon because the bratty princesses (Abigail&#8217;s sisters) don&#8217;t want her to become Queen.  However, at least they have their secret weapon.  To find out what that is, you will have to watch the movie.  In the end, everyone gets what they deserve!My favorite part is when the security guard tells the guardian, Phyllis Bunt (Amy Louise Wilson) that she can get out of jail if she reveals her true identity.  She gives a made up name of Dynasty Composition knowing no one believes her real identity anyway.  However, the security guard lies and won't let her out.  Phyllis then jumps the security guard, ties her up and duck tapes her mouth.  I didn&#8217;t see that coming!  It is hysterical.All the characters are great, especially Princess Cordilla (Emma Pierson) one of the princesses who makes fun of Abigail.  She has a funny voice and isn&#8217;t very smart and plays the part well. The main idea of this movie is that if you believe in yourself, you can make anything happen.I recommend this movie for kids ages 5 through 12.  Specifically, girls will enjoy this movie, as every girl wants to imagine herself as a princess at some point. Therefore, I rate this movie a four out of five &#8220;dazzling&#8221; stars!  Sophia Grace & Rosie&#8217;s Royal Adventure is available now on DVD.Reviewed by Haley P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

All of her tea parties and doll play involves princesses. When I saw Sophia Grace & Rosie's Royal Adventure; I knew it would interest her but I wasn't sure if it would hold her attention at four years old since it's not a cartoon.Paige was hooked from her first viewing!  She has been watching it over and over and over and over again! I watched it with her and it's a really cute story filled with fun music and dancing that will have you singing and dancing right along.After appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres show and growing in popularity on YouTube with their serious talents; now you can enjoy them in this DVD with your little princess.The story is probably a little old and lost on Paige but the musicality of it all makes up for it and has her performing along with them. It's probably better suited for girls in the 8 and older range but if you have a girl who loves princesses, she will still enjoy the movie.Sophia Grace & Rosie's Royal Adventure is definitely going to be a hit with little girls of the princess obsession age!",4,Musical and Charming,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1161,"['daughter', 'just', 'LOVES', 'princesses', 'take', 'back', 'daughter', 'princess', 'one', 'daily', 'crown', 'tea', 'parties', 'doll', 'play', 'princesses', 'When', 'saw', 'Sophia', 'Grace', 'Rosie', 'Royal', 'Adventure', 'knew', 'would', 'interest', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'hold', 'attention', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'cartoon.Paige', 'was', 'hooked', 'first', 'viewing', 'been', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'watched', 'really', 'cute', 'story', 'filled', 'fun', 'music', 'dancing', 'will', 'have', 'singing', 'dancing', 'right', 'along.After', 'appearing', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'show', 'growing', 'popularity', 'YouTube', 'serious', 'talents', 'now', 'can', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'little', 'princess.The', 'story', 'probably', 'little', 'old', 'lost', 'Paige', 'musicality', 'up', 'performing', 'probably', 'better', 'suited', 'girls', '8', 'older', 'range', 'have', 'girl', 'who', 'princesses', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie.Sophia', 'Grace', 'Rosie', 'Royal', 'Adventure', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'hit', 'little', 'girls', 'princess', 'obsession', 'age']",Sophia Grace & Rosie: Royal Adventure

If you've ever enjoyed Mary-Kate and Ashley movies, you'll love this! These girls have so much personality they practically fly off the screen!In this movie, Sophia Grace and Rosie help a princess to overcome her insecurities, recognize her talents and realize her dreams; all the while contending with and overcoming the obstacles placed in her path by her two competing sisters. It keeps a light touch throughout, with a humorous subplot involving the girls' chaperon who, after many misadventures, realizes a dream of her own.But as entertaining as it is, even the story seems superfluous as it only needs to exist to provide a canvas for Sophia Grace and Rosie to shine. And they do shine, bringing all the fun, humor and talent you've come to expect from these extraordinary ladies. The music is catchy and upbeat, the settings beautiful, and the movie keeps a nice pace from start to finish.I sincerely hope this will be the first in a long line of movies for these girls; they've debuted with a great movie the whole family can enjoy!
