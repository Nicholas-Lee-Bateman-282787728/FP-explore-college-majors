I from time to time buy anime cuss of the cover rather then reviews thinking it will be good based on looks I'd recommend not watching this anime unless you like mediocrity. The story awkwardly starts with the two main characters with no story development to give you a sense of where they have come from and the only thing you know is the chick saves the boy who's parents just got killed in a space launch to the moon. Its so random and then you watch this anime only to be more confused by them being chased by and strange organization. Its just awkward awkward.  All the characters are underdeveloped. the story is weird and off putting and I cant put my fingure on it but the look of the anime is really all it has going for it. Some of the characters don't even know what they themselves are really their for its retarded lol. Anyways don't buy this unless you like looking at characters that just look pretty and uninteresting.i would like to add the draganaut crew that chases them starts question there own motives of why their doing it typical. Anyways the characters which there are many have terrible story development except the main girl hooking up with the guy main char. its just crap.,3,Draganaut ehh..,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1321,"[""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'surprise', 'buy', 'anime', 'went', 'out', 'limb', 'bought', 'was', 'sourly', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'time', 'time', 'buy', 'anime', 'cuss', 'cover', 'rather', 'then', 'reviews', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'based', 'looks', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'not', 'watching', 'anime', 'like', 'mediocrity', 'story', 'awkwardly', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'development', 'give', 'sense', 'where', 'have', 'come', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'chick', 'boy', 'who', 'parents', 'just', 'got', 'killed', 'space', 'launch', 'moon', 'so', 'random', 'then', 'watch', 'anime', 'only', 'be', 'more', 'confused', 'being', 'chased', 'strange', 'organization', 'just', 'awkward', 'awkward', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'story', 'weird', 'putting', 'cant', 'put', 'fingure', 'look', 'anime', 'really', 'going', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'retarded', 'lol', 'Anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'looking', 'characters', 'just', 'look', 'pretty', 'uninteresting.i', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'draganaut', 'crew', 'question', 'there', 'own', 'motives', 'why', 'doing', 'typical', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'have', 'terrible', 'story', 'development', 'main', 'girl', 'hooking', 'up', 'guy', 'main', 'char', 'just', 'crap']",N/A
1384064,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0043988I0,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 14]","Watch out! A giant space asteroid has destroyed Pluto and is unleashing CGI space dragons on the Earth! Yeah, I don't really buy that concept either. But unfortunately the concept is still the best part of ""Dragonaut: Resonance,"" a flaccidly plotted little anime with lots of CGI dragons, jiggling breasts and power-of-fuzzy-sparkly-love-will-prevail stuff.Two years after his family was killed in a shuttle accident, Jin is being followed by a mysterious pink haired girl -- and it turns out the ISDA is interested in making him a dragon-riding Dragonaut, like his old pal Kazuki. Jin isn't really surprised by any of this. Emotion is not Jin's strong point.And as he and the girl Toa fall in love (over the course of, like, half an hour), the ISDA's dragons attack her -- and she suddenly transforms into a dragon as well. Along with a newborn dragon named Gio, who claims he was born to protect Toa even though he was given to Kazuki, Jin sets out to be with Toa. Of course the ISDA's Dragonauts are sent off to find Toa because she is a ""living original.""But then (and by ""then"" I mean a year later) all dragons -- artificial or ""original"" -- are endangered when a Cliche Evil Military Company turns against them, Gio suddenly starts attacking everybody, and Thanatos is beginning to threaten the planet again. Of course, Jin and Toa alone can save us. HELP.Angst. Breasts. Space battles. Breasts. Killer Asteroid. Angst. Breasts. Random turns to evil Breasts. Bland romance. That's pretty much the only description I can think of to give ""Dragonaut: Resonance"" -- it's just such a bland, unappealing series, with characters that seem bipolar and an animation style that keeps snapping you out of the story.Now I will admit that there are some powerful moments, especially in the middle of the series, including shocking deaths and a conspiracy to attack them. Unfortunately, it takes more than TEN EPISODES for the main plot to really start, and most of those episodes are made up of Toa running headlong into trouble, while Jin and Gio chase after her (usually with screams of ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"" ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"" SHUT UP). Even worse: the ending is just... lame.It also has extremely patchy animation -- the dragons are basically big draconic mecha, rendered in flat, matte CGI that looks like it was lifted from a cheap video game. And WHOA what is up with all the BREASTS? Most of the women in this series have giant sacks of Jello boinging around their chests and hanging out of their porn-star outfits (these are high-ranking military and scientists?).Jin looks a lot like Sasuke from ""Naruto,"" but is much blander and even angstier; Toa is equally bland. Kazuki is a selfish pig who spends the whole series acting like a psycho (HAIRCUT OF DEATH!), and Gio is just a character that makes you think, ""Why is he even in this show? And why is he he twirling his legs around?"". And there's just SO MUCH WHINING.It took me multiple tries to get through ""Dragonaut: Resonance"" because it left me wanting to punch most of the characters.

The writers try very hard to create a complicated and deeply convoluted plot, but it all ends up being too confusing. Either that or you don't feel involved enough to care. What it basically boils down to is boy meets girl, who is a dragon. Lots of angry people with guns and dragons of their own don't want them to be together. So they run. Then they get caught, then they escape, then they run some more. Then they decide they can't be together, so they break up, then the people who they think are helping them turn on them and so on rinse and repeat. I could go in to more detail, but it doesn't matter. There are bits and pieces and fights and situations that will have you totally interested and then there are other forced conflicts that you don't really know why they are fighting, what is at stake or the goal is if either side wins. What you do get along the way are some good visuals with some epic space battles, some car chases, interesting vehicles and spacecraft and breasts. The fanservice ranges from just a serious conversation or fight or poignant moment that just happens to involve a woman or three with extremely large chests to blatant camera angles and overt jiggling. Most all of these women tend to wear very low cut blouses to accentuate their assets and depending on your feeling about that it can either make a boring episode bearable or make the whole show too embarrassing or uncomfortable to watch. If you are like me you are an anime fanatic but you sometimes want to ""share"" your love of the genre with others to get them in to it. This isn't the one to show your GF, wife or anyone who isn't already used to the boob factor some animes have.To sum things up, Dragonaut is worth a viewing or rental.
