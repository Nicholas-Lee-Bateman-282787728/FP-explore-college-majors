Essentially a lo-fi series of videos for the album, the film is edited out of chronological order, aptly telling the story of Greendale, CA, USA. Very creative and interesting, if not slowish at times. But it remains under two hours and hell, its Neil Young music with visuals. Praise!If you love Young, you'll like this, if not it may be a stretch. But his willingness to communicate his feelings for small town life, the turmoil of mistakes and unlawfullness, the tribute to family, marriage and love, and the commitment to fighting the good fight are all here.",3,"""Visit Greendale,"" pop: Neil Young's muses...",1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,713,"['How', 'cool', 'Neil', 'Young', 'album', 'creating', 'piece', 'fictional', 'California', 'coast', 'town', 'then', 'shoots', 'film', 'Essentially', 'lo-fi', 'series', 'videos', 'album', 'film', 'edited', 'chronological', 'order', 'aptly', 'telling', 'story', 'Greendale', 'CA', 'USA', 'Very', 'creative', 'interesting', 'not', 'slowish', 'times', 'two', 'hours', 'hell', 'Neil', 'Young', 'music', 'visuals', 'Praise', 'love', 'Young', ""'ll"", 'like', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'stretch', 'willingness', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'turmoil', 'mistakes', 'unlawfullness', 'tribute', 'family', 'marriage', 'love', 'commitment', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'are', 'here']",N/A

I bought Greendale the DVD more as a curiosity knowing, at worst, I don't mind having video to go with the music.Greendale starts as a disarmingly-simple introduction to the Green family and ends with 2 powerful, wake-up-call anthems. The actors, who sync the lyrics, make it all interesting and watchable. The journey takes on a surreal quality in fairly short time. Statements about corruption in the White House, corporate greed and our responsibility to the environment are even stronger in the film than they are on the cd. It amazes me that time hasn't worn the edge off Neil Young to speak his mind. This is a day and age when we're supposed to be afraid.I had a great time watching this dvd. I can't compare it to anything I've seen. Ideally a person might know the music before watching the film; and also just appreciate film as an art.

817119,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B0001YA1S6,o dubhthaigh,"[46, 62]","Young and Crazy Horse are basically characters from Pynchon (LOT 49, VINELAND) come to life, often with results that seem equally absurd, poignant, heartfelt, goofey, amateurish, honest. And all of that is on display in this film, particularly Young's anti-Spielberg aesthetics, which is cause enough for celebration. That mix of burn-out eco-hippie-polemics has served Young and the Horse well. One need only look at footage of some of their arguments in Year of the Horse, Live in Berlin, to realize just how comical they are when they are seriously pissed at each other.This film, however, has a point, and is embraced by what is one of Young's best collections of songs in a very long while. Characteristically, it is as unprofessionally ""acted"" and shot as you can get, and therein lies its charm. The ""actors"" are basically road and musician colleagues assembled by Young to mouth the words of his songs, intercut with montage pieces reflecting the spirit or message of a song. It is the same approach he used with his classic JOURNEY THROUGH THE PAST film from the seventies (Hey, Neil, where's the DVD of that or even the soundtrack?).I'm likely the only one who has ever seen JOURNEY 11 times, and I don't suspect that I'll attempt that with this film, but amid his goofiness as a filmmaker, Neil has quite a lot to say about the state of mind of the US, at least as seen through the prism of this one family. In doing so, he addresses greed, karma, the environment, and the nature of one's nationality set against this backdrop of violence that is all American Eagle, and none of the compassion of Liberty. Although others may state the theme more eloquently, Young gets across in so unaffected a manner that the silliness of the movie is its own metaphor for how we clutter what is essential with the temporal and effete.Back in JOURNEY, Young had David Crosby articulate an observation that is as chillingly accurate today as it was at the end of the Nixon era. I do not doubt that 30 years on, someone will come across this odd film and laugh at first, and then think about what the comedian just said.Young is a lot like the hero in VINELAND. Re-read Pynchon, listen to Neil: they paint an accurate picture of life under gravity's rainbow.",3,"AS I was saying, characters from Pynchon....",1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,2253,"['Young', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'are', 'basically', 'characters', 'Pynchon', 'LOT', '49', 'VINELAND', 'come', 'life', 'often', 'results', 'seem', 'equally', 'absurd', 'poignant', 'heartfelt', 'goofey', 'amateurish', 'honest', 'display', 'film', 'particularly', 'Young', 'anti-Spielberg', 'aesthetics', 'cause', 'enough', 'celebration', 'mix', 'burn-out', 'eco-hippie-polemics', 'served', 'Young', 'Horse', 'well', 'One', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'footage', 'arguments', 'Year', 'Horse', 'Live', 'Berlin', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'comical', 'are', 'when', 'are', 'seriously', 'pissed', 'other.This', 'film', 'however', 'point', 'embraced', 'what', 'one', 'Young', 'best', 'collections', 'songs', 'very', 'long', 'Characteristically', 'unprofessionally', 'acted', 'shot', 'can', 'get', 'therein', 'charm', 'actors', 'are', 'basically', 'road', 'musician', 'colleagues', 'assembled', 'Young', 'mouth', 'words', 'songs', 'intercut', 'montage', 'pieces', 'reflecting', 'spirit', 'message', 'song', 'same', 'approach', 'used', 'classic', 'JOURNEY', 'THE', 'PAST', 'film', 'seventies', 'Hey', 'Neil', 'where', 'DVD', 'even', 'soundtrack', '.I', ""'m"", 'likely', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'JOURNEY', '11', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'film', 'goofiness', 'filmmaker', 'Neil', 'quite', 'lot', 'say', 'state', 'mind', 'US', 'least', 'seen', 'prism', 'one', 'family', 'doing', 'so', 'greed', 'karma', 'environment', 'nature', 'one', 'nationality', 'set', 'backdrop', 'violence', 'American', 'Eagle', 'none', 'compassion', 'Liberty', 'others', 'may', 'state', 'theme', 'more', 'eloquently', 'Young', 'so', 'unaffected', 'manner', 'silliness', 'movie', 'own', 'metaphor', 'how', 'clutter', 'what', 'essential', 'temporal', 'effete.Back', 'JOURNEY', 'Young', 'had', 'David', 'Crosby', 'articulate', 'observation', 'chillingly', 'accurate', 'today', 'was', 'end', 'Nixon', 'era', 'do', 'not', 'doubt', '30', 'years', 'someone', 'will', 'come', 'odd', 'film', 'laugh', 'first', 'then', 'think', 'what', 'comedian', 'just', 'said.Young', 'lot', 'hero', 'VINELAND', 'Re-read', 'Pynchon', 'Neil', 'paint', 'accurate', 'picture', 'life', 'gravity', 'rainbow']",N/A

There are projects like ""Books for Soldiers"" and ""[...]"" through which people can send books, DVDs and music to U.S. soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond.  Before I mailed off the DVD, I watched it myself, and was captivated by it.  I found the technique of going from a sketch to actual actors to be fascinating, along with other elements of this production.  I'm totally sympathetic to Young's political perspective, and was moved by his song ""Be the Rain.""In one scene, there is footage of a busted pipeline squirting oil.  It is one of many moments in this film that will give U.S. soldiers (and anyone else) food for thought.Incidentally, Young's ""Cinammon Girl"" was recently the bumper music on Air America Radio during an interview with Naomi Klein, who wrote a book that Young is probably reading -The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.

Zwick,"[6, 42]","*1/2A film written and directed by Neil Young, ""Greendale"" is little more than an 87-minute music video set to a dozen or so of the artist's works.  In lieu of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's lyrics, which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary, to tell the ""story"" while actors act out the scenes.Given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of Young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption.  Although there is allegedly a ""story"" running through the film, we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting.  All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack.

BUT, and that is a big but, it all works together to present a quirky little movie that is watchable. The sound is tremendous though and makes up for some of the negatives. Despite all the shortcomings, you do get drawn into this little town of Greendale and the strange characters that live there.The added features are nice - a great live stage version of &quot;Be The Rain&quot; really kicks and shows the power of the live show and how well Neil has combined the live show with the movie or vice versa. The Making of Greendale (about 25 minutes) segment is good and surprisingly clear and in focus as opposed to the movie. It does show that Neil and his team have some skills in making movies.
