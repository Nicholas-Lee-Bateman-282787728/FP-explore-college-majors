1347389,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B003JCZH40,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[8, 8]","1967's ""Tarzan and the Great River"", the second of three Mike Henry 'Tarzan' films produced simultaneously in 1966, is probably best known, today, as the film where Dinky, the large chimp who played Cheeta, attacked Mike Henry, biting him severely on the jaw. The handlers were forced to put the animal down (previously filmed footage and other chimps would be used for the remainder of the films), Henry required 20 stitches, then infection set in and he developed a high fever and monkey fever delirium for several days, with filming halted for three weeks, while he recuperated. As he recovered, he announced he was finished playing 'Tarzan', after he fulfilled the three-film commitment (producer Sy Weintraub had planned to introduce a 'Tarzan' TV series, starring Henry, while the features were still in theatres; Ron Ely would be brought in, to play Tarzan in the television series...). Henry then sued Weintraub's production company for negligence, winning the case and an unpublished cash settlement.Needless to say, it wasn't the happiest of times on the Tarzan set!Despite all the drama, ""Great River"" isn't a bad film, if not in the league of the earlier Weintraub Tarzan entries. The story is set along the Amazon, and was filmed in Brazil (although stock footage of African lions and hippos would be added, as rather incongruous 'padding'). A leopard 'cult' headed by Olympian Rafer Johnson (as a voodoo-like leader), is attacking villages and using the populations as slave labor to extract diamonds from the hills, and Tarzan is called in to bring the cult down. Utilizing the lion and chimp from ""Valley of Gold"" (but with different names, reintroducing 'Cheeta' to the series), Tarzan befriends steamer captain Sam Bishop (actor/comedian Jan Murray), and his young first mate (Manuel Padilla Jr., in his second Tarzan feature; he would go on to become a regular in the television series). Rescuing a pretty doctor (Diana Millay) from a raid, our heroes move upriver to the expected, rather unsurprising climax. Still, Mike Henry looks powerful and dangerous, the closest embodiment to the classic Russ Manning Tarzan illustrations, ever. It's a shame Henry never had better scripts, or a safer working environment, as he might have become the best Tarzan of all!He makes this film worthwhile!",4,"A Bit 'Padded', but Mike Henry IS Tarzan!",1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2310,"['1967', 'Tarzan', 'Great', 'River', 'second', 'three', 'Mike', 'Henry', ""'Tarzan"", 'films', 'produced', 'simultaneously', '1966', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'today', 'film', 'where', 'Dinky', 'large', 'chimp', 'who', 'played', 'Cheeta', 'attacked', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'biting', 'severely', 'jaw', 'handlers', 'were', 'forced', 'put', 'animal', 'down', 'previously', 'filmed', 'footage', 'other', 'chimps', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'remainder', 'films', 'Henry', 'required', '20', 'stitches', 'then', 'infection', 'set', 'developed', 'high', 'fever', 'monkey', 'fever', 'delirium', 'several', 'days', 'filming', 'halted', 'three', 'weeks', 'recuperated', 'recovered', 'announced', 'was', 'finished', 'playing', ""'Tarzan"", 'fulfilled', 'three-film', 'commitment', 'producer', 'Sy', 'Weintraub', 'had', 'planned', 'introduce', ""'Tarzan"", 'TV', 'series', 'starring', 'Henry', 'features', 'were', 'still', 'theatres', 'Ron', 'Ely', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'play', 'Tarzan', 'television', 'series', 'Henry', 'then', 'sued', 'Weintraub', 'production', 'company', 'negligence', 'winning', 'case', 'unpublished', 'cash', 'settlement.Needless', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'happiest', 'times', 'Tarzan', 'set', 'drama', 'Great', 'River', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'league', 'earlier', 'Weintraub', 'Tarzan', 'entries', 'story', 'set', 'Amazon', 'was', 'filmed', 'Brazil', 'stock', 'footage', 'African', 'lions', 'hippos', 'would', 'be', 'added', 'rather', 'incongruous', ""'padding"", 'leopard', ""'cult"", 'headed', 'Olympian', 'Rafer', 'Johnson', 'voodoo-like', 'leader', 'attacking', 'villages', 'using', 'populations', 'slave', 'labor', 'extract', 'diamonds', 'hills', 'Tarzan', 'called', 'bring', 'cult', 'down', 'Utilizing', 'lion', 'chimp', 'Valley', 'Gold', 'different', 'names', 'reintroducing', 'series', 'Tarzan', 'steamer', 'captain', 'Sam', 'Bishop', 'actor/comedian', 'Jan', 'Murray', 'young', 'first', 'mate', 'Manuel', 'Padilla', 'Jr.', 'second', 'Tarzan', 'feature', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'regular', 'television', 'series', 'Rescuing', 'pretty', 'doctor', 'Diana', 'Millay', 'raid', 'heroes', 'move', 'upriver', 'expected', 'rather', 'unsurprising', 'climax', 'Still', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'closest', 'embodiment', 'classic', 'Russ', 'Manning', 'Tarzan', 'illustrations', 'ever', 'shame', 'Henry', 'never', 'had', 'better', 'scripts', 'safer', 'working', 'environment', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'best', 'Tarzan', 'film', 'worthwhile']",N/A
1347390,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B003JCZH40,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","This 1967 Tarzan 88 minute film stars Mike Henry as Tarzan for the second of three times that he will have the role. A vicious tribal leader called Baracuna frightens people who are convinced that he can make them sick and kill them with magic. His people attack peaceful native villages, in modern day South America, along the Amazon River, kill some inhabitants and take others as slaves to work Baracuna's diamond mine. A friend of Tarzan calls on him to help since the government is unable to find Baracuna and his tribesmen. Tarzan flies in from Africa on Pan Am in a conventional suit of clothes. The friend is killed by Baracuna's men. Tarzan takes off his clothes, and runs off to the jungle to revenge his friend. He takes along Cheetah the ape and a lion.The comedian Jan Murray has the second lead in the film and adds lots of humor. He has adopted an Indian boy who is very cute. Cheetah finds an ape friend and there is plenty of hugging. A white female doctor escapes one of Baracuna's raids and Tarzan and Murray help her travel to a native village to vaccinate the tribe against a plague that they thought was Baracuna's magic. The film is fun to watch, but like most Tarzan films, many minutes are taken up showing us birds flying, animals fighting, and alligators swimming.",4,Tarzan vs. a man of magic,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1291,"['1967', 'Tarzan', '88', 'minute', 'film', 'stars', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'Tarzan', 'second', 'three', 'times', 'will', 'have', 'role', 'vicious', 'tribal', 'leader', 'called', 'Baracuna', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'can', 'make', 'sick', 'kill', 'magic', 'people', 'attack', 'peaceful', 'native', 'villages', 'modern', 'day', 'South', 'America', 'Amazon', 'River', 'kill', 'inhabitants', 'take', 'others', 'slaves', 'work', 'Baracuna', 'diamond', 'mine', 'friend', 'Tarzan', 'calls', 'help', 'government', 'unable', 'find', 'Baracuna', 'tribesmen', 'Tarzan', 'flies', 'Africa', 'Pan', 'Am', 'conventional', 'suit', 'clothes', 'friend', 'killed', 'Baracuna', 'men', 'Tarzan', 'clothes', 'jungle', 'revenge', 'friend', 'along', 'Cheetah', 'ape', 'lion.The', 'comedian', 'Jan', 'Murray', 'second', 'lead', 'film', 'lots', 'humor', 'adopted', 'Indian', 'boy', 'who', 'very', 'cute', 'Cheetah', 'ape', 'friend', 'plenty', 'hugging', 'white', 'female', 'doctor', 'one', 'Baracuna', 'raids', 'Tarzan', 'Murray', 'help', 'travel', 'native', 'village', 'vaccinate', 'tribe', 'plague', 'thought', 'was', 'Baracuna', 'magic', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'Tarzan', 'films', 'many', 'minutes', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'showing', 'birds', 'flying', 'animals', 'fighting', 'alligators', 'swimming']",N/A
