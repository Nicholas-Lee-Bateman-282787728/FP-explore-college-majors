1167691,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001AR0CUK,B. E Jackson,"[0, 3]","I completely fail to see what makes the Promotion funny in ANY single way.  It's one missed joke after another.The storyline is about a grocery store manager (who looks like he's about 18 years old, played by Seann William Scott) who continues to find himself in situations where people give him a really hard time, so the jokes are supposed to come from how his character reacts to them.  It doesn't work though because 90% of the jokes aren't even remotely funny.- The recurring theme showing the crazy guy with the graham crackers who repeatedly flips out at the store manager- not funny.  He should have made his exit after the beginning segment and never should have been brought back for another segment.  That's why the joke didn't work.- The overweight guy who shops at the store and keeps pretending that the store is actually his home by doing things such as drinking soda straight from the bottle before buying it, and shaving his face in the middle of the aisle- not funny.- The silly segment involving John C. Reilly's character standing around with a bunch of people outside with a bag over his head and a tattoo of the rock band KISS on his chest- not funny.- The part where a guy pushes a shopping cart with a doll in it directly into a parked car- not funny.- The segment where Seann William's character sprays a guy in the face with mace in the grocery store parking lot because he couldn't contain his anger anymore- not funny.- The part where everyone was running barefoot through fire- not funny.The Promotion is just a terribly written movie both in terms of storyline and jokes.

Reilly leading the way ones initial response is this is going to be a great ""guy film"" filled with crazy, insane behavior and lots of scantily clad young ladies. If that's the evening you had in mind this is not the movie for you. The '08 film `The Promotion' is a rather wistful, slow moving story of the innate desire to succeed in the workplace yet remain true to who you are and what you want to believe about yourself. In other words it posits the question ""Can you retain your self-respect and dignity while striving for upward mobility and financial security?""Watching this rather unexpectedly low key film I found it somewhat disconcerting at times. Previously conditioned by other films I've seen with Scott and Riley I found myself anticipating something hilarious to occur and it simply never happens. When I finally came to the realization that this was to be something totally different for these two and attuned myself with the pace and theme as presented I discovered it was actually quite good though subdued. I guess that's my way of giving `The Promotion' a tentative approval.Don't bother to invite the guys over for this one, save it for a quiet evening at home with the wife.",3,"""Was I The Better Man?"" ~ Dignity, Respect And Competition In The Workplace",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1246,"['likes', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'leading', 'way', 'ones', 'initial', 'response', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'guy', 'film', 'filled', 'crazy', 'insane', 'behavior', 'lots', 'scantily', 'clad', 'young', 'ladies', 'evening', 'had', 'mind', 'not', 'movie', ""'08"", 'film', 'Promotion', 'rather', 'wistful', 'slow', 'moving', 'story', 'innate', 'desire', 'succeed', 'workplace', 'yet', 'remain', 'true', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'other', 'words', 'question', 'Can', 'retain', 'self-respect', 'dignity', 'striving', 'upward', 'mobility', 'financial', 'security', 'Watching', 'rather', 'unexpectedly', 'low', 'key', 'film', 'found', 'somewhat', 'disconcerting', 'times', 'Previously', 'conditioned', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Scott', 'Riley', 'found', 'anticipating', 'something', 'hilarious', 'occur', 'simply', 'never', 'When', 'finally', 'came', 'realization', 'was', 'be', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'two', 'attuned', 'pace', 'theme', 'presented', 'discovered', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'subdued', 'guess', 'way', 'giving', 'Promotion', 'tentative', 'approval.Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'invite', 'guys', 'one', 'save', 'quiet', 'evening', 'home', 'wife']",The Promotion
1167695,A2INAZF9WAOXWJ,B001AR0CUK,"Bryan Christopher ""Screenwriter/Indy Filmmaker""","[2, 6]","So, a good friend of mine invited me to come hang out this evening and watch a film that he had just picked up called the ""The Promotion"".  The name sounded familiar to me but I was not aware of what the story was about or who starred in it.  My friend could not answer either of my questions, but curiousity took over and I decided to grab some munchies and head over for a viewing.As soon as the film started I was presented with Seann William Scott as the star and narrarator of this story.  As soon as this happened it all fell back into place. I had remembered seeing this in a preview earlier in the year, but soon forgot about it as most of the movie-going public also did (it only was released in select theaters/cities).Scott stars as a 33-year old Doug, an assistant manager at a Chicagoland grocer.  He is married to the beautiful Pam (cough), I mean Jenna Fischer, of ""The Office"" fame. Needless to say the story is simple. Dougie wants to get a promotion to become manager of a new branch of the grocery chain that is going to be opening soon.  He is told he is a shoe-in for the job. That is until Canadian transferee Richard, played by John C. Reilly, bursts onto the scene to compete with him for the position.Based on the trailer one could be let to believe that the film will be chock-full of comedic antics where the two are pulling pranks and one-upping eachother in an attempt to get the promotion.  But a half-hour into watching this film I was left wondering where the plot was going, and was beginning to wonder if I even cared about who got the job.  I initially assumed that the viewer was supposed to be rooting for Doug to come out on top, but I cannot honestly say that I was left with this feeling.  In fact, I felt the opposite, which in turn left me wondering if the writer/director had intended it to reach the audience in this way.  Sadly, I doubt I will force myself to sit through another screening to figure it out.All in all the film had a few raunchy jokes that made me snicker, but the characters and plot felt like they were meandering too much to keep me interested in the outcome of this ""competition"".  I would recommend this for a rental if your a big fan of either of the actors. Otherwise, wait for cable and give it a try if nothing better is on.",2,"Who gets the promotion?

1167696,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B001AR0CUK,Dr. E,"[9, 9]","Doug Stauber (Seann William Scott) and Richard Wehlner (John C. Reilly) find themselves competing for the same managerial position. Where most films would have one clearly likable character pitted against another nefarious one, this work takes no such short-cut. Herein resides the beauty of this piece. The Promotion is as much a drama as it is a comedy.Just a short caveat: This is not your typical comedy, so the exposition may throw you off. Nonetheless, after the first ten minutes the film's playfulness begins to peek through ... and by the twenty-minute mark, the viewer is thoroughly engrossed. So, just let go of all assumptions and let Conrad (the director) guide your feelings.At times, this piece is genuinely hysterical: the comment-cards, the shopping-cart gag, the parking-lot gangs ... all funny. At other times, it's deliberately uncomfortable: both men need this advancement, both men have families, both have our sympathies. The moments of tension are fairly intense. The betrayals are almost heart-crushing. But even in its darkest moments (there are a few), the viewer never wants to abandon the film. Its complexity is what makes this work so appealing!Hey, I knew it was a great film when I heardPublic Image Limitedon the soundtrack (just had to say that). But it is the small details that add a touch of reality: the well-intended but entirely annoying neighbors (who play the banjo), the myopic supervisor (who thinks every minor infraction will bring-about the apocalypse), the sticker name-tags worn at company-retreats (though everyone knows each others' names), and the bizarre mantra that the customer is always right (even if they concuss you with a Yoo-Hoo bottle). No matter what your position in life, no matter what your career, you should find some slice of yourself here.This is a very clever, surprisingly nuanced, and entirely relatable work. It was both strangely touching (Riley dancing in the vacant store was surprisingly painful) and yet comedic (the Teddy Grahams stalker seemed to turn into a demented ""Where's Waldo""). Can you ask for more?If you want to see Seann William Scott in a more mature, more challenging role, this film may be a good choice. (Who knew he had it in him??!!) I hope more of these complex roles come his way!The closest film to which I can compare Conrad's The Promotion is Forster'sStranger Than Fiction. Though there isn't much one can call ""existential"" in this piece, there is a similar emotional dynamic. So, if you've ridden that particular roller-coaster and found it gratifying, you may enjoy this one.P.S. This film made me reexamine my approach to comment-cards. It think I'm going to start peppering-in some expletives ... just for fun ... but only on the positive ones!!",5,"""My Grocery List Didn't Include Sexual Harassment, But Thanks"" ...",1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,2755,"['Doug', 'Stauber', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Richard', 'Wehlner', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'find', 'competing', 'same', 'managerial', 'position', 'Where', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'clearly', 'likable', 'character', 'pitted', 'nefarious', 'one', 'work', 'such', 'short-cut', 'Herein', 'beauty', 'piece', 'Promotion', 'as', 'much', 'drama', 'comedy.Just', 'short', 'caveat', 'not', 'typical', 'comedy', 'exposition', 'may', 'throw', 'off', 'Nonetheless', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'playfulness', 'peek', 'twenty-minute', 'mark', 'viewer', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'So', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'assumptions', 'let', 'Conrad', 'director', 'guide', 'feelings.At', 'times', 'piece', 'genuinely', 'hysterical', 'comment-cards', 'shopping-cart', 'gag', 'parking-lot', 'gangs', 'funny', 'other', 'times', 'deliberately', 'uncomfortable', 'men', 'need', 'advancement', 'men', 'have', 'families', 'have', 'sympathies', 'moments', 'tension', 'are', 'fairly', 'intense', 'betrayals', 'are', 'almost', 'heart-crushing', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'viewer', 'never', 'abandon', 'film', 'complexity', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'appealing', 'Hey', 'knew', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'when', 'heardPublic', 'Image', 'Limitedon', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'had', 'say', 'small', 'details', 'add', 'touch', 'reality', 'well-intended', 'entirely', 'annoying', 'neighbors', 'who', 'play', 'banjo', 'myopic', 'supervisor', 'who', 'minor', 'infraction', 'will', 'bring-about', 'apocalypse', 'sticker', 'name-tags', 'worn', 'company-retreats', 'everyone', 'others', 'names', 'bizarre', 'mantra', 'customer', 'always', 'right', 'even', 'concuss', 'Yoo-Hoo', 'bottle', 'matter', 'what', 'position', 'life', 'matter', 'what', 'career', 'should', 'find', 'slice', 'here.This', 'very', 'clever', 'surprisingly', 'nuanced', 'entirely', 'relatable', 'work', 'was', 'strangely', 'touching', 'Riley', 'dancing', 'vacant', 'store', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'painful', 'yet', 'comedic', 'Teddy', 'Grahams', 'stalker', 'seemed', 'turn', 'demented', 'Where', 'Waldo', 'Can', 'ask', 'more', 'want', 'see', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'more', 'mature', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'Who', 'knew', 'had', 'hope', 'more', 'complex', 'roles', 'come', 'way', 'closest', 'film', 'can', 'compare', 'Conrad', 'Promotion', ""Forster'sStranger"", 'Than', 'Fiction', ""n't"", 'much', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'existential', 'piece', 'similar', 'emotional', 'dynamic', 'So', ""'ve"", 'ridden', 'particular', 'roller-coaster', 'found', 'gratifying', 'may', 'enjoy', 'one.P.S', 'film', 'made', 'reexamine', 'approach', 'comment-cards', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'peppering-in', 'expletives', 'just', 'fun', 'only', 'positive', 'ones']",The Promotion

1167709,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001AR0CUK,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","A lot of familiar faces keep popping up in the course of ""The Promotion,"" a charming indie comedy set in the outskirts of Chicago.The ever-endearing Seann William Scott (Stifler from the ""American Pie"" series) plays Doug Stauber, an assistant manager at a grocery store who's having trouble controlling not only his own subordinates but the obnoxious gang members who seem to have taken up residence in the parking lot and spend their time harassing the shoppers.  When Doug learns that a new franchise is opening soon in the area, he's assured by his current boss that he's a ""shoo-in"" for the position of manager there - until, that is, Richard Wehlner, a native of Canada, moves to town and becomes Doug's key rival for the spot.Given the premise, ""The Promotion"" could easily have devolved into one of those broad, lowest-common-denominator farces, filled with obvious sight-gags and over-the-top slapstick.  Instead, thanks to a restrained script and subtle direction by Steven Conrad, the movie becomes a genial and gently amusing tale of two equally likable people who are just trying to move ahead a little in the tightly circumscribed world in which they live.  Doug and Richard aren't asking for fame and fortune, just a little recognition that they're doing a good job with the resources that have been handed to them.  That they are forced to tear one another down in order to achieve that recognition is what gives the movie its poignancy and soul.  The movie, thus, becomes that rare tale about competition and rivalry where no one is a villain.In addition to the wonderful lead actors, the cast includes Fred Armisen (""SNL""), Jenna Fischer (""The Office""), Lili Taylor (""Six Feet Under"") and Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development"").Give this one a chance; it will grow on you.",4,a movie about rivalry where no one is a villain,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1789,"['lot', 'familiar', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'course', 'Promotion', 'charming', 'indie', 'comedy', 'set', 'outskirts', 'Chicago.The', 'ever-endearing', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Stifler', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'Doug', 'Stauber', 'assistant', 'manager', 'grocery', 'store', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'controlling', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'subordinates', 'obnoxious', 'gang', 'members', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'parking', 'lot', 'spend', 'time', 'harassing', 'shoppers', 'When', 'Doug', 'new', 'franchise', 'opening', 'soon', 'area', 'assured', 'current', 'boss', 'shoo-in', 'position', 'manager', 'Richard', 'Wehlner', 'native', 'Canada', 'town', 'Doug', 'key', 'rival', 'spot.Given', 'premise', 'Promotion', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'devolved', 'one', 'broad', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'farces', 'filled', 'obvious', 'sight-gags', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'Instead', 'thanks', 'restrained', 'script', 'subtle', 'direction', 'Steven', 'Conrad', 'movie', 'genial', 'gently', 'amusing', 'tale', 'two', 'equally', 'likable', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'move', 'ahead', 'little', 'tightly', 'circumscribed', 'world', 'live', 'Doug', 'Richard', 'are', ""n't"", 'asking', 'fame', 'fortune', 'just', 'little', 'recognition', ""'re"", 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'resources', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'are', 'forced', 'tear', 'one', 'down', 'order', 'achieve', 'recognition', 'what', 'movie', 'poignancy', 'soul', 'movie', 'thus', 'rare', 'tale', 'competition', 'rivalry', 'where', 'one', 'villain.In', 'addition', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'actors', 'cast', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'SNL', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'Office', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Arrested', 'Development', '.Give', 'one', 'chance', 'will', 'grow']",The Promotion

1167711,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B001AR0CUK,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[1, 3]","I've been on a John C. Reilly kick lately, and this past week I sat down and watched the flick The Promotion (written and directed by Steve Conrad.)  I wasn't expecting to really connect with the film at all as it's sort of set up with a pretty standard comedy plot and stars Seann William Scott (he of Stiffler fame from the American Pie movies) who I'm not all that enamored with.  Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy Reilly's performance, a few jokes here and there and that's about it.Part my initial disinterest was that the flick seemed to be drawing from the same cultural ennui of flicks like Waiting, Office Space and more importantly Clerks.  I experienced Clerks at the perfect age, 19, right smack dab in the middle of my initial career as a grocery store stock clerk and budding film buff, and connected with it in a very visceral way.  For my money Kevin Smith totally captured what life was life like for a 20-something pop culture nerd working in retail, whittling away the hours with humor as the world (customers, supervisors, family, etc.) slowly sucked away at your soul.  Well, with a lot of genres (sub-genres, sub-categories, what-have-you) it seems like there are one or two films that do a great job of addressing the particular subject matter, and thereafter other flicks just seem to be watered down imitations or parodies.  For me, in the minimum wage lackey category of comedy films, Clerks stands head and shoulders above the rest (with a nice honorable mention to Office Space, even though it deals more with corporate misery), and after watching flicks like Waiting or Kill the Man I was getting kind of tired of the genre.  When I saw the trailer for the Promotion, I was expecting just more of the same.Actually, I think part of my disinterest lies simply with the fact that I've moved on from that time and place in my life.  I'm over ten years older, working a slightly more rewarding office job (I still emotionally connect to Office Space just fine thank you), and I'm less interested in wallowing in sarcastic hopelessness, preferring a bit more upbeat fare (in general, not as a rule.)  Again, watching the trailer for the Promotion, which revolves around two grocery store assistant managers vying for the coveted store manager position at a new location, I was expecting to be less than engaged by the plot.For the first half of the film everything was going exactly as I figured.  I was really enjoying John C. Reilly's Richard Wehlner, there were a couple of really funny jokes (in particular a handful about an annoying banjo teacher/gay dominatrix type), and a few surprising cameos (in particular by Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale.)  I was actually a little surprised that Seann William Scott didn't bug me all that much (something I also noticed in the flick Southland Tales), though there wasn't anything particularly engaging about him either.  Then, as the rivalry between Reilly and Scott started to heat up a bit I found myself wanting the film to side-step the clich&eacute;d plot (where one of the two would take on the role of the villain and you'd start rooting for the other by proxy) and veer into more uncharted territory.  The weird thing is that it did.I as mentioned before, the film stars Scott as Doug Stauber, who is an assistant manager at a grocery store chain located in Chicago, and along with his wife (played by Jenna Fischer) is just trying to make a go of life in middle class America.  Figuring on being the shoo-in for the Store Manager position at a new location under construction, the couple decides to take a chance on buying their first house.  At the same time, Canadian transplant Richard Wehlner (Reilly) (and his family, including his Scottish wife played by Lili Taylor), also an assistant manager (though for a chain of Canadian sister stores), and a recovering drug addict, transfers to Chicago putting Stauber's ""shoo-in"" status in jeopardy.  As the bigwigs descend on the store to check up on Doug and Richard, each end up dealing with their own demons, be it a gang making life on parking lot duty hell, the possibility of slipping back into depression, alcohol and drugs, or their need to get 'promoted' in order to grab a hold on their life.Though the film is mainly a comedy, it manages to avoid some of the more obvious or gratuitous plot machinations, and pretty much plays the jokes in a subtle manner (even the more outrageous humor isn't in your face.)  The flick manages to balance the gags with plenty of introspection and does a surprisingly amazing job at illustrating a more real-life struggle for success.  This is what kills me about most movies where the characters are always shooting for the stars, where success is defined only by achieving what in the long run only a very few people can.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for striving for greatness, but I'm also content in not shooting myself into the cosmos.  Becoming an amazing success is wonderful, unless the trip there and beyond is horrible.  Anyway, about halfway into the film I started hoping for a particular outcome, and was surprised when it occurred.  Where Clerks deals with the grind of working a Middle American job with sarcasm, apathy and slack, The Promotion deals in hope, duty, and a positive work ethic.  It's the other side of the coin, and sort of the next logical step after a film like Clerks (which is sort of where Smith was going with Clerks II, just without the goofy dance sequences, inexcusably ignorant fanboys, and donkey sex.)",4,Cut the Cheese?
