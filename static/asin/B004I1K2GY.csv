Each show has a moral showing that using a gun is wrong. ""The Highwayman"" is a good example. A husband and wife run a boarding house with about four or five boarders. The place is run down and the food meager because the proprietors are poor. They can't even pay their mortgage. Then a rich man and his wife come to stay for a short while because the local hotel is filled. He has the gun.One day the husband sees him lying drunk in an alley and robs him of his money and the gun. The rich man leaves town and the husband buy items for the boarding house and for his wife. He is certain that his wife doesn't know what he did. He likes the small luxury and decides to use the gun to hold up a stage coach. Then he does it again and is slightly wounded while fleeing the crime. He decides to abandon his criminal activities and throws away the gun. He lavishes gifts upon his wife and buys more items to improve the boarding house and turn it into a hotel.Does his wife know what he did? Will she be happy with their changed circumstances? Will she feel that she cannot stay with him? Will she want to take the money and start a life on her own?",5,"Interesting, easy to watch, moral tales",1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1260,"['Dead', 'Man', 'Gun', 'series', 'hour', 'shows', 'how', 'different', 'people', 'get', 'particular', 'gun', 'old', 'west', 'use', 'show', 'moral', 'showing', 'using', 'gun', 'wrong', 'Highwayman', 'good', 'example', 'husband', 'wife', 'run', 'boarding', 'house', 'four', 'five', 'boarders', 'place', 'run', 'down', 'food', 'meager', 'proprietors', 'are', 'poor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'Then', 'rich', 'man', 'wife', 'come', 'stay', 'short', 'while', 'local', 'hotel', 'filled', 'gun.One', 'day', 'husband', 'lying', 'drunk', 'alley', 'robs', 'money', 'gun', 'rich', 'man', 'town', 'husband', 'buy', 'items', 'boarding', 'house', 'wife', 'certain', 'wife', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'did', 'small', 'luxury', 'decides', 'use', 'gun', 'hold', 'up', 'stage', 'coach', 'Then', 'again', 'slightly', 'wounded', 'fleeing', 'crime', 'abandon', 'criminal', 'activities', 'away', 'gun', 'gifts', 'wife', 'more', 'items', 'improve', 'boarding', 'house', 'turn', 'hotel.Does', 'wife', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'Will', 'be', 'happy', 'changed', 'circumstances', 'Will', 'feel', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'Will', 'want', 'take', 'money', 'start', 'life', 'own']",Dead Man's Gun: Season 2

The series got a decent cast for each episodes and while not all of them will be well known they act the roles pretty well. Like with the first season set while the video quality is pretty good and while you'll get some graininess and a few scenes overall the picture quality is good as is the audio. So if you already got the first season of Dead Man's Gun then the second is a must have especially at this very affordable price....",5,While Sadly The Series Only Lasted Two Seasons Now We Have Both To Enjoy,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,637,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'second', 'surprise', 'series', 'will', 'give', 'viewer', 'good', 'dosage', 'western', 'life', 'gunfights', 'course', 'good', 'story', 'intermixed', 'episode', 'series', 'got', 'decent', 'cast', 'episodes', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'known', 'act', 'roles', 'pretty', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'video', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ll"", 'get', 'graininess', 'few', 'scenes', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'audio', 'So', 'already', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Gun', 'then', 'second', 'must', 'have', 'especially', 'very', 'affordable', 'price']",Dead Man's Gun: Season 2

I recorded the entire 44 shows from the Starz/Encore Western Channel presentations and transferred them to DVD (quite a task).  Now . .  on to this (legal) edition.  When I saw these disks became available, I ordered them immediately, and am very pleased with it.  I shall keep my semi-legal copies, but will enjoy this, as well as the First Season's disks.
