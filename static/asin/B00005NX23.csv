670664,ARFA31P6NNWUR,B00005NX23,"""5u5hi""","[4, 11]","I was pretty torn in my final analysis of this film.  On the one hand, I loved this film for its colourful and poetic cinematography.  The girls in the film were beautiful, and who doesn't like to look at beautiful girls in beautiful costumes?  But I felt guilty for enjoying this film because as a feminist this story clearly doesn't reinforce feminist values, but rather, traditional, patriarchal values that seem to characterize Korea even up until this day.  Sure, Chunhyang might seem like a heroine for choosing to face death to protect her virtue, but why should this be her defining moment?  And I didn't like how Mongryong was able to pluck her out of crowd and take her for his wife like she were just some object for the taking.  To me this reinforces man's desire, man's pleasure, and the preeminence of man.  Although, on the other hand, Chunhyang clearly finds pleasure in sex with Mongryong, and in this way finds comfort in her own sexuality.  Nevertheless, Chunhyang's life revolves around Mongryong and more importantly, she has no personhood or value so long as she is unmarried.  In this context, the film seems pretty shallow and empty.  But of course, if you get past the feminist agenda (that women deserve personhood in their own right, regardless of whoever's daughter or wife they are, and that women have their own desires outside of masculine constructions), this film is wonderful eyecandy.  The historical setting also provides a glimpse into traditional Korea, although I can't say how accurate everything was.",4,"Good, but...",1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,1541,"['was', 'pretty', 'torn', 'final', 'analysis', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'loved', 'film', 'colourful', 'poetic', 'cinematography', 'girls', 'film', 'were', 'beautiful', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'look', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'felt', 'guilty', 'enjoying', 'film', 'feminist', 'story', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'reinforce', 'feminist', 'values', 'rather', 'traditional', 'patriarchal', 'values', 'seem', 'characterize', 'Korea', 'even', 'up', 'day', 'Sure', 'Chunhyang', 'might', 'seem', 'heroine', 'choosing', 'face', 'death', 'protect', 'virtue', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'defining', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Mongryong', 'was', 'able', 'pluck', 'crowd', 'take', 'wife', 'were', 'just', 'object', 'taking', 'man', 'desire', 'man', 'pleasure', 'preeminence', 'man', 'other', 'hand', 'Chunhyang', 'clearly', 'pleasure', 'sex', 'Mongryong', 'way', 'comfort', 'own', 'sexuality', 'Nevertheless', 'Chunhyang', 'life', 'Mongryong', 'more', 'importantly', 'personhood', 'value', 'so', 'long', 'unmarried', 'context', 'film', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'empty', 'course', 'get', 'feminist', 'agenda', 'women', 'deserve', 'personhood', 'own', 'right', 'regardless', 'whoever', 'daughter', 'wife', 'are', 'women', 'have', 'own', 'desires', 'masculine', 'constructions', 'film', 'wonderful', 'eyecandy', 'historical', 'setting', 'also', 'glimpse', 'traditional', 'Korea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'accurate', 'everything', 'was']",Chunhyang

670666,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005NX23,casualsuede,"[1, 5]","Chunhyang is as real as Romeo and Juliet. The only difference is that R&J; was written by W. Shakespeare, while the Chunhyang was more a folklore. Both are works of fiction. It is told in a pansori, an opera/singwritten form which is accompanied by a tradional Korean Drum.Of course, the singing style is bizarre, even grating to many viewers and this will critically distract the foreign viewer.The story takes place in feudal times (17th century) where the son of a governor (Mongyoung Lee) decides to take a small trip to a Korean monument, taking a break from his studies to become a government bureaucrat (where the prestige jobs are back then). There he meets Chunhyang, a daughter of a courtesan (an ancient version of a paid mistress or concubine) and falls in love. After a few meetings, they get married (blink and you miss the wedding ceremony). The problem is that according to ancient Korean law, a man of nobility and a lower class woman cannot get married. M. Lee's father and mother hear of this and object and when his father is posted in Seoul (a promotion from the outer provinces), he sends his son ahead to get him out of Cholla Province (where the story is set). Mongyoung promises Chunhyang that he will return after he finishes the entrance exams for his profession.Three years later, a new regional governor comes and he immediately fancies Chunhyang as his new courtesan. She refuses, since she is already married and offends the governor. He is corrupt and jails her immediately. She becomes a symbol for the plight of her village. Meanwhile, Mongyoung has scored top in his class and becomes the King's lead investigator. In his travel back to Cholla Province, he learns of the Governors corruption and plans to execute Chunhyang for her defiance of him. He sets a plan to rescue her.The story is slow to get going and the director gives a lot of time for the audience to get to know both Mongyoung and Chunhyang. The female lead is the critical character and she shows raw emotions as the devoted wife. The actor playing Mongyoung also does a good job, but neither is groundbreaking. The narrative is also good, but can get confusing since the Pansori is chock full of metaphors.The Pansori is the weak point. The movie takes the form of a visual retelling of a korean operatic Pansori, but they do not match. The visualization overtakes and overwhelms the Pansori and at the end the Pansori becomes the intrusive narrative. This is evident when Chunhyang gets tortured by the new governor. As she is tortured, we are suddenly switched back to the modern Pansori and her tortured screams are mouthed by the singer (who barks and shouts and is a man). All emotional intensity is lost to the movie-viewing audience. The directing is well done, but this is a character driven movie and the director does a good job staying in the background.Overall, this movie is appealing to those who love Pansori. Those who find it grating and intrusive (as myself) to the visual narrative will ultimately find this movie frustrating and overly boring....Rating: C",3,A lesson in Korean Folklore,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,3077,"['Chunhyang', 'as', 'real', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'only', 'difference', 'R', 'J', 'was', 'written', 'W.', 'Shakespeare', 'Chunhyang', 'was', 'more', 'folklore', 'are', 'works', 'fiction', 'told', 'pansori', 'opera/singwritten', 'form', 'accompanied', 'tradional', 'Korean', 'Drum.Of', 'course', 'singing', 'style', 'bizarre', 'even', 'grating', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'critically', 'distract', 'foreign', 'viewer.The', 'story', 'place', 'feudal', 'times', '17th', 'century', 'where', 'son', 'governor', 'Mongyoung', 'Lee', 'take', 'small', 'trip', 'Korean', 'monument', 'taking', 'break', 'studies', 'become', 'government', 'bureaucrat', 'where', 'prestige', 'jobs', 'are', 'back', 'then', 'Chunhyang', 'daughter', 'courtesan', 'ancient', 'version', 'paid', 'mistress', 'concubine', 'love', 'few', 'meetings', 'get', 'married', 'blink', 'miss', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'problem', 'according', 'ancient', 'Korean', 'law', 'man', 'nobility', 'lower', 'class', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'married', 'M.', 'Lee', 'father', 'mother', 'hear', 'object', 'when', 'father', 'posted', 'Seoul', 'promotion', 'outer', 'provinces', 'son', 'ahead', 'get', 'Cholla', 'Province', 'where', 'story', 'set', 'Mongyoung', 'Chunhyang', 'will', 'return', 'entrance', 'exams', 'profession.Three', 'years', 'later', 'new', 'regional', 'governor', 'immediately', 'Chunhyang', 'new', 'courtesan', 'already', 'married', 'governor', 'corrupt', 'immediately', 'symbol', 'plight', 'village', 'Meanwhile', 'Mongyoung', 'scored', 'top', 'class', 'King', 'lead', 'investigator', 'travel', 'back', 'Cholla', 'Province', 'Governors', 'corruption', 'plans', 'execute', 'Chunhyang', 'defiance', 'plan', 'rescue', 'her.The', 'story', 'slow', 'get', 'going', 'director', 'lot', 'time', 'audience', 'get', 'know', 'Mongyoung', 'Chunhyang', 'female', 'lead', 'critical', 'character', 'raw', 'emotions', 'devoted', 'wife', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mongyoung', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'groundbreaking', 'narrative', 'also', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'Pansori', 'chock', 'full', 'metaphors.The', 'Pansori', 'weak', 'point', 'movie', 'form', 'visual', 'retelling', 'korean', 'operatic', 'Pansori', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'visualization', 'overtakes', 'overwhelms', 'Pansori', 'end', 'Pansori', 'intrusive', 'narrative', 'evident', 'when', 'Chunhyang', 'tortured', 'new', 'governor', 'tortured', 'are', 'suddenly', 'switched', 'back', 'modern', 'Pansori', 'tortured', 'screams', 'are', 'mouthed', 'singer', 'who', 'shouts', 'man', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'lost', 'movie-viewing', 'audience', 'directing', 'well', 'done', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'director', 'good', 'job', 'staying', 'background.Overall', 'movie', 'appealing', 'who', 'love', 'Pansori', 'who', 'find', 'grating', 'intrusive', 'visual', 'narrative', 'will', 'ultimately', 'find', 'movie', 'frustrating', 'overly', 'boring', '.Rating', 'C']",Chunhyang

The love between two persons from different backgrounds made this an interesting watch because the son of a governor would be married to someone of his rank but he chose to be with the daughter of a courtesan.

670670,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005NX23,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","I know that the majority of Americans are unfamiliar with the Korean art form of Pansori. It is similar to Peking opera, except the voices are lower. And if that doesn't help, Peking opera sounds like a multitude of dying cats. But seriously, Pansori sounds strange simply because it is something new. Pansori is similar to the oral tradition used to pass along the Bible or stories like The Iliad. Only this time, it is in Korean. Chunhyang is an old Korean folk tale, and this movie tries to tell the story in both a Pansori style (with a storyteller 'singing' and slightly dancing to a drum) and one of traditional cinema.This film is really nice to watch. This duality is what ultimately makes Chunhyang not realize its potential. Listening to a story or reading a book is much different than watching one. A storyteller uses painstaking detail in describing events, so that the listener can construct an image in his/her mind. Revered director Kwon-taek Im (Taebak Mountains) uses Sang-hyun Cho (who wrote the movie with Hye-yun Kang and Myong-gon Kim), the foremost proponent of Pansori to narrate Chunhyang. The story switches between him on stage, seemingly yelling before an audience, and the actual story. Sometimes, his words frame sequences and actors speak in unison with him. The problem is that he minutely describes what is on the screen, and Im follows his words exactly. It works if people are watching him perform in a theater, but becomes distracting when watching a movie. When Cho says somebody walks quickly, the person walks quickly. When Cho says somebody throws a rock, the person throws a rock. Usually, narration in movies serves to impart something unknown instead of simply repeating what is on screen.As a folk tale, Chunhyang echoes universal themes of love and fidelity in a simplistic manner. As a movie, it leaves some questions unanswered. Sure, Mongyong cannot see Chunhyang, but no letter or any sort of communication for three years? He supposedly loves her deeply, but then wouldn't he make some effort to contact his wife? Im does a great job with how the movie looks (Chunhyang was the most expensive movie ever in Korea, but still cheap by American standards) but the actors are not that great. Lee does almost nothing but giggle and bow her head demurely for most of the movie. And of course, there is the constant switching between Cho and the movie. Chunhyang would be better if Im chose one method and stuck to it, whether it be a movie of Cho delivering the story Pansori style, or the story itself.",4,That was a beautiful experience,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2547,"['know', 'majority', 'Americans', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Korean', 'art', 'form', 'Pansori', 'similar', 'Peking', 'opera', 'voices', 'are', 'lower', ""n't"", 'help', 'Peking', 'opera', 'sounds', 'multitude', 'dying', 'cats', 'seriously', 'Pansori', 'strange', 'simply', 'something', 'new', 'Pansori', 'similar', 'oral', 'tradition', 'used', 'pass', 'Bible', 'stories', 'Iliad', 'Only', 'time', 'Korean', 'Chunhyang', 'old', 'Korean', 'folk', 'tale', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'Pansori', 'style', 'storyteller', ""'singing"", 'slightly', 'dancing', 'drum', 'one', 'traditional', 'cinema.This', 'film', 'really', 'nice', 'watch', 'duality', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Chunhyang', 'not', 'realize', 'potential', 'Listening', 'story', 'reading', 'book', 'much', 'different', 'watching', 'one', 'storyteller', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'describing', 'events', 'listener', 'can', 'construct', 'image', 'mind', 'Revered', 'director', 'Kwon-taek', 'Im', 'Taebak', 'Mountains', 'Sang-hyun', 'Cho', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'Hye-yun', 'Kang', 'Myong-gon', 'Kim', 'foremost', 'proponent', 'Pansori', 'narrate', 'Chunhyang', 'story', 'switches', 'stage', 'seemingly', 'yelling', 'audience', 'actual', 'story', 'Sometimes', 'words', 'frame', 'sequences', 'actors', 'speak', 'unison', 'problem', 'minutely', 'what', 'screen', 'Im', 'words', 'exactly', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'perform', 'theater', 'distracting', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'When', 'Cho', 'somebody', 'walks', 'quickly', 'person', 'walks', 'quickly', 'When', 'Cho', 'somebody', 'rock', 'person', 'rock', 'Usually', 'narration', 'movies', 'serves', 'impart', 'something', 'unknown', 'instead', 'simply', 'repeating', 'what', 'screen.As', 'folk', 'tale', 'Chunhyang', 'universal', 'themes', 'love', 'fidelity', 'simplistic', 'manner', 'movie', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'Sure', 'Mongyong', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Chunhyang', 'letter', 'sort', 'communication', 'three', 'years', 'supposedly', 'deeply', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'contact', 'wife', 'Im', 'great', 'job', 'how', 'movie', 'Chunhyang', 'was', 'most', 'expensive', 'movie', 'ever', 'Korea', 'still', 'cheap', 'American', 'standards', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'Lee', 'almost', 'nothing', 'giggle', 'bow', 'head', 'demurely', 'most', 'movie', 'course', 'constant', 'switching', 'Cho', 'movie', 'Chunhyang', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Im', 'chose', 'one', 'method', 'stuck', 'be', 'movie', 'Cho', 'delivering', 'story', 'Pansori', 'style', 'story']",Chunhyang

It's not even close. RRL is a complex and subtle psychodrama where human emotions and conflicts are central, and nothing is as it seems. Chunhyang is a simple little Confucian morality tale--nothing more, nothing less. But there's really not much plot to speak of: boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love (after some ambiguous scenes where he seems to be having sex with her against her will), boy and girl are torn apart by fate, boy and girl have happy ending. The characters are 2-dimensional, and at times inconsistent--he alternates between being a passionate lover and an egomaniacal jerk, and she's the ideal sweet, longsuffering, patient Korean woman, except when she's having hysterical temper tantrums.

Narrated in the Korean tradition of Pansori in which a story is told through sung verse, it's the timeless classic tale of two young people who fall in love at first sight, are separated through adversity, and come together again.Chunhyang is the daughter of a courtesan, and in the ancient Korean class system she is therefore considered a courtesan herself, and Mongryong is the son of an upper-class nobleman; they meet, fall in love, and marry secretly.  Mongryong's father, however, has plans for his son that don't include marrying a courtesan's daughter, and the couple has to split up while Mongryong prepares for a state examination.  Chunhyang spends the three years of their separation fighting off the advances of a venal provincial governor; she's about to die for her resistance when her long-lost husband returns to save her.  Virtue has its rewards.The film succeeds on every count.  The cinematography is splendid, the two young lead actors, both of them teenagers, are excellent, and the haunting tones of the Pansori singer draw us into the film and make us a part of it.  Unlike those reviewers who felt that the singing distracted from the movie, I thought it helped to underscore the ancient tradition of story-telling, a part of so many cultures, in which a tale is narrated through song and verse as well as prose.  We not only enjoy ""Chunhyang"" as a brilliant example of Korean film making, we feel it on a fundamental level as a love story anyone can relate to.

I try to make films about the real life of Korea."" ~ Im Kwon-TaekIf ""keeping promises"" and ""writing promises"" intrigues you, you will be seduced by the romantic nature of this movie. This movie reminds me of Romeo and Juliet only because Chunhyang and Mongryong wed secretly and enjoy a brief, yet passionate interlude before fate sends them on separate paths.Mongryong decides he wants to marry Chunhyang and within a few hours he has succeeded in his mission. As Chunhyang spreads out her orange skirt, the governor's son, Mongryong (Cho Seung Woo),  takes a brush, dips it in ink as dark as death and writes symbols that represent: ""Like the sun and the moon, my love will never change.""Chunhyang (Lee Hyo Jung) is full of sweet innocence and although she is the daughter of a courtesan, seems rather shy in the world of men. She is reluctant, but then finds her true ecstasy in marriage. Just when she has discovered this new world of pleasure, her husband must leave Namwon with his father and study for an exam while living in Soeul.After Mongryong leaves her to follow his career, we realize how vulnerable Chunhyang is without the protection of her husband. The corrupt governor (Lee Jung Hun) has heard of Chunhyang's beauty and decides to maker her one of his courtesans. At one point, the brutality is rather shocking, yet the violence does seem to have a point and this makes the impact much stronger. We cannot help but admire Chunhyang's devotion to her husband.While this movie is stunning in its beauty and romantic appeal, the facts are, this is a cultural experience. Im Kwon Taek has taken the ancient operatic tradition of pansori (storytelling) and fused it with a modern film. He believes pansori is the best form of traditional Korean art and believes Korea is neglecting their own music and culture.In this movie, Im Kwon-Taek seems to want to create a marriage between pansori and visual intoxication. The entire 300-year old fold tale is narrated by Cho Sang Hyan, who is accompanied by a gosu playing a drum (puk).The movie is exquisite in places, but the voice of the narrator was at times rather jarring in contrast with the vibrant images and sensitively romantic moments. There were times when the drama did not need to be heightened. The images were powerful enough.The viewer must at times be as patient as Chunhyang. We wait for the quiet moments with a sense of anticipation, while Chunhyang waits for her lover. It would have been nice to have an abundance of silence in this movie as the story almost unfolds on its own.There is a moment when snow is falling and Chunhyang is thinking of Mongryong in a scene of mystical beauty. The colors, costumes and scenes of nature are exquisite. I loved the little ""chest"" that held the food and had little drawers and a place for a drink. Quite an elaborate little lunch box.This retelling of a Korean Classic is a combination of fading ancient art forms, modern movie making and universal themes that transcend cultural boundaries. It is a story of eternal devotion, youthful passion and lyrical promises.I didn't see the actions of Chunhyang as a complete symbol of undying loyalty to marriage. For me, her actions represented undying love in impossible circumstances.~The Rebecca Review",3,Korean Romeo and Juliet,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,3357,"['try', 'examine', 'serious', 'aspects', 'Korean', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'aim', 'commercial', 'success', 'try', 'make', 'films', 'real', 'life', 'Korea', '~', 'Im', 'Kwon-TaekIf', 'keeping', 'promises', 'writing', 'promises', 'intrigues', 'will', 'be', 'seduced', 'romantic', 'nature', 'movie', 'movie', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'only', 'Chunhyang', 'Mongryong', 'wed', 'secretly', 'enjoy', 'brief', 'yet', 'passionate', 'interlude', 'fate', 'separate', 'paths.Mongryong', 'marry', 'Chunhyang', 'few', 'hours', 'succeeded', 'mission', 'Chunhyang', 'out', 'orange', 'skirt', 'governor', 'son', 'Mongryong', 'Cho', 'Seung', 'Woo', 'brush', 'ink', 'as', 'dark', 'death', 'symbols', 'represent', 'sun', 'moon', 'love', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'Chunhyang', 'Lee', 'Hyo', 'Jung', 'full', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'daughter', 'courtesan', 'rather', 'shy', 'world', 'men', 'reluctant', 'then', 'true', 'ecstasy', 'marriage', 'Just', 'when', 'discovered', 'new', 'world', 'pleasure', 'husband', 'must', 'leave', 'Namwon', 'father', 'study', 'exam', 'living', 'Soeul.After', 'Mongryong', 'follow', 'career', 'realize', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'Chunhyang', 'protection', 'husband', 'corrupt', 'governor', 'Lee', 'Jung', 'Hun', 'heard', 'Chunhyang', 'beauty', 'decides', 'maker', 'one', 'courtesans', 'one', 'point', 'brutality', 'rather', 'shocking', 'yet', 'violence', 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'impact', 'much', 'stronger', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admire', 'Chunhyang', 'devotion', 'husband.While', 'movie', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'romantic', 'appeal', 'facts', 'are', 'cultural', 'experience', 'Im', 'Kwon', 'Taek', 'taken', 'ancient', 'operatic', 'tradition', 'pansori', 'storytelling', 'fused', 'modern', 'film', 'best', 'form', 'traditional', 'Korean', 'art', 'Korea', 'neglecting', 'own', 'music', 'culture.In', 'movie', 'Im', 'Kwon-Taek', 'want', 'create', 'marriage', 'pansori', 'visual', 'intoxication', 'entire', '300-year', 'old', 'fold', 'tale', 'narrated', 'Cho', 'Sang', 'Hyan', 'who', 'accompanied', 'gosu', 'playing', 'drum', 'puk', '.The', 'movie', 'exquisite', 'places', 'voice', 'narrator', 'was', 'times', 'rather', 'jarring', 'contrast', 'vibrant', 'images', 'sensitively', 'romantic', 'moments', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'drama', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'heightened', 'images', 'were', 'powerful', 'enough.The', 'viewer', 'must', 'times', 'be', 'as', 'patient', 'Chunhyang', 'wait', 'quiet', 'moments', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'Chunhyang', 'waits', 'lover', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'abundance', 'silence', 'movie', 'story', 'almost', 'moment', 'when', 'snow', 'falling', 'Chunhyang', 'thinking', 'Mongryong', 'scene', 'mystical', 'beauty', 'colors', 'costumes', 'scenes', 'nature', 'are', 'exquisite', 'loved', 'little', 'chest', 'held', 'food', 'had', 'little', 'drawers', 'place', 'drink', 'elaborate', 'little', 'lunch', 'retelling', 'Korean', 'Classic', 'combination', 'fading', 'ancient', 'art', 'forms', 'modern', 'movie', 'making', 'universal', 'themes', 'transcend', 'cultural', 'boundaries', 'story', 'eternal', 'devotion', 'youthful', 'passion', 'lyrical', 'promises.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'actions', 'Chunhyang', 'complete', 'symbol', 'undying', 'loyalty', 'marriage', 'actions', 'represented', 'undying', 'love', 'impossible', 'circumstances.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Chunhyang
670679,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00005NX23,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 3]","i'm not sure i learned enough interesting things watching this movie to justify the time.First, it is very culturally dependent. The way it is delivered is a particular Korean story telling procedure, without command of the language (subtitles don't make it with this movie) and some cultural sensitivity, the technique is boring.Secondly, the story is very Confucian, probably very Korean as well, but i simply don't know enough about the genre in Korea to be sure.The plot is simple enough.Boy sees girl, boy wants girl, boy seduces girl with various promises, boy leaves for big city, 3 years pass and local bigwig wants girl.She resists on the grounds that she is married. Bigwig promises to execute her if she doesn't submit to his will. Boy makes good on exams, returns and sets everything right.Curiously, we really don't have this story in Western culture, the closest i can think of is Robin Hood. With doctrines like that of ""rebellion under lesser magistrates"", the West has concentrated on affirming the right of local government officials to adhere to principles and resist larger political powers. Something very effected by our individualism and elevation of the individual as the basic unit of society. As the movie makes explicit the story is about serving two masters, the local government official or her husband.There are lots of stories about the virtuous but poor women defending their honor from grasping and powerful people, but this story comes across less as sexual (for she really submits pretty quicker to the boy) and more about the conflict with the Confucian hierarchy of greater/lesser relationships. This hierarchy of power is from servant, to husband-wife, to elder brother and younger, to father-son and finally to levels of government-local, provincial, central state kingship. I believe that Confucian is a top down structure with greater power to the higher levels. But besides this is the closeness-distance relationship as well, from husband-wife up to subject-king. The story is about how this structure can collide internally, with several layers claiming to be dominant.The visuals are stunning, the acting is a bit wooden and stiff, the dialog via the subtitles is junk.

The narrating part should have been editted out and maybe re-done with a simple english narration (for the DVD to be released in america, anyway).But anyway, let's look at the message behind this film:Marriage is God's law.  A woman reduced to the humiliated role of a courtesan (right from birth), is the sick decision of insecure men who've managed to achieve the seat of power over the people.  No man should ever think that he's above God's laws.  Especially a man in a leadership role.If a governor, or any man given the distinguished role of leading the people, should decide that a woman is a courtesan first, then a married woman second, should not even be in that seat of power.  He should be executed before the people he terrifies.  Or at least, be abruptly removed from office, publicly disgraced before the media.Chunhyang did the right thing to resist Governor Byun, and the Governor should have had his own constituants arrest him for his selfish ungodly-worthy intentions.But, apart from the narrator, everything else about this film is what we all truly love about an asian love tragedy.

The story is based on Korean famous legend, Chunhyang who stood for her rights to devote all her love only to 1 man despite of the traditional custom that a decendant courtesan (she was the daughter of a retired courtesan) was a coutesan and must be available in serving other men.I have been told there was a story like this but have never known the real plot. I feel very lucky to be able to watch this artpiece. As a woman, I really admire ChunHyang and her guts in keeping to her promise and to her heart.The traditional and moral value of this legend is magnified by the cinematography and the way it is told which presents the story as it was sung by a traditional singer (pansori).

He sings or chants roughly as he goes through the gestures of a kind traditional performance I've never seen before. The uniqueness of it fascinates me, even though I can't follow the ritual meanings and Korean language. Then, the movie begins ...The story tells of a classical romance. The lovers marry in secret, despite the vast social gulf between them. Then the man must leave, following governmental duty. She stays behind, awaiting his return. While he's gone, a corrupt governor hears of her beauty and commands her to be his concubine. Even under torture, she remains true to her husband, who returns to save her just in the nick of time. Virtue and loyalty find their reward, with tasteful hints of marital love reminding us of the rewards that adults can give to each other.But through it all, the chanting narrator continues telling the tale. Once in a while, the characters playing the roles in the story break into that narrative chant, too. The result becomes a unique blend of an ancient performing heritage with modern movie-making. I'm sure that people who know the tradition find even more in it than I do, but understanding isn't necessary. Romance and honor transcend culture, and the unfamiliar performing style creates a tantalizing sense that more is shown than I can see.-- wiredweird",5,"Charming romance, wonderful tradition",1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,1419,"['screen', 'dark', 'man', 'howling.After', 'moment', 'see', 'performer', 'stage', 'alone', 'drummer', 'chants', 'roughly', 'gestures', 'kind', 'traditional', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'uniqueness', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'ritual', 'meanings', 'Korean', 'language', 'Then', 'movie', 'story', 'tells', 'classical', 'romance', 'lovers', 'marry', 'secret', 'vast', 'social', 'gulf', 'Then', 'man', 'must', 'leave', 'following', 'governmental', 'duty', 'awaiting', 'return', 'gone', 'corrupt', 'governor', 'hears', 'beauty', 'be', 'concubine', 'Even', 'torture', 'true', 'husband', 'who', 'save', 'just', 'nick', 'time', 'Virtue', 'loyalty', 'find', 'reward', 'tasteful', 'hints', 'marital', 'love', 'reminding', 'rewards', 'adults', 'can', 'give', 'other.But', 'chanting', 'narrator', 'telling', 'tale', 'Once', 'while', 'characters', 'playing', 'roles', 'story', 'break', 'narrative', 'chant', 'too', 'result', 'unique', 'blend', 'ancient', 'performing', 'heritage', 'modern', 'movie-making', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'tradition', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'do', 'understanding', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Romance', 'honor', 'transcend', 'culture', 'unfamiliar', 'performing', 'style', 'tantalizing', 'sense', 'more', 'shown', 'can', 'see.', 'wiredweird']",Chunhyang
