To make matters worse, the student has just driven into Mexico with his girlfriend's family.  Only one small clue can help Pesci track down his cargo before a contract is taken out on himself.What follows are typically improbable comedy situations that have the heads moving around and being seen by unreliable witnesses while more and more people get involved in trying to straighten out the mess.  This gives various characters a chance to develop and show their true mettle.  Things begin to get really out of hand but it is successfully tied up at the end with the viewer feeling pretty good about how it all worked out.I expected this to be a darker comedy with plenty of black humor but it really wasn't.  Considering the plot device this was a surprisingly happy and upbeat film.

Tommy is hired to transport a duffel bag full of eight decapitated heads across the country to a crime boss. While on a plane, he accidentally switches bags with a tourist named Charlie. Throughout the day, Charlie tries to hide the heads, and Tommy is trying to track him down. I would recommend 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG!!!",4,Pretty Good!!!,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,445,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'mafia', 'hit', 'man', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Spinelli', 'Tommy', 'hired', 'transport', 'duffel', 'bag', 'full', 'eight', 'decapitated', 'heads', 'country', 'crime', 'boss', 'plane', 'accidentally', 'bags', 'tourist', 'named', 'Charlie', 'day', 'Charlie', 'hide', 'heads', 'Tommy', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'would', 'recommend', '8', 'HEADS', 'IN', 'A', 'DUFFEL', 'BAG']",N/A

Everyone else seems be going through a ""bad acting"" virus. Veterans George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon just seem like they'e only doing this movie because work for them is hard to come by these days. And who is that John Cusack wannabe who is the star of the movie? This movie would have better off with the real John Cusack. But joe, David, and Todd provide all the comic relief for this dark comedy.The movie is about a duffel bag switch at the airport, one of which contains 8 heads being delivered for the mob. That says it all right there.In some stores, this dvd is available for a very good price. If you find it at one of those stores, I definitely recommend this dvd.

My fav is when the father try's to get on a plane and they find heads in his bag. The police don't notice it right away. They are to busy looking at the gun next to it.

The performances are also a bit off-key: Dyan Canon's screechy and hysterical role is wearisome, Kristy Swanson is little more than eye candy, George Hamilton is stiff and unconvincing, David Spade isn't animated enough, and so on.  The movie requires an unusually large suspension of disbelief: For instance, these may be the only corpses that don't stink or attract insects.
