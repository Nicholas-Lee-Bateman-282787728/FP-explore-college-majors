Having seen the short film Float, on which this movie is based, I was so pleased to see production qualities in nearly every area greatly improved over the original. The movie captivated me and got me emotionally involved in the story line. The acting was outstanding. Layers of sub-stories were added to the original, adding complexity and mystery to the story. But when I got to the end --SPOILERS AHEAD--, I was blown away at the changes to the original ending. The killing of one of the two lead characters was completely unnecessary, in fact it did violence to the rest of the storyline and felt out of place. It was a gratuitous attempt to add drama to the story, making it a tragedy instead of a true personal triumph and overcoming. I went back and watched Float again, and though the short film had many rough edges, the ending was consistent with the progression of the storyline. I am torn with giving Rivers Wash Over Me 5 stars for its excellence in nearly all ways, and 1 star for the betrayal I felt with the altered ending.

His art teacher suggests his work would improve with a change of scenery, so he travels to the nearby island of Eleuthera, where he meets a friendly and attractive black musician, Romeo, with whom he slowly learns to open himself up to new experiences, as well as a sexual relationship. Unfortunately, Romeo also has a fiance', and, although Johnny is not the first boy he has taken to bed, he is the first one that truly makes him wish he had the courage to be whom he really is.  The story develops amid an atmosphere of bigotry and violence justified as religion, as activists attempt to force a vote assuring that the Bahamas denies any kind of rights to homosexuals.This is an emotional, well-told coming-of-age story, teaching tolerance and self-acceptance amid adversity and misunderstanding.  The photography is also exceptionally beautiful, including several underwater scenes. Acting is very good, and has won awards at several film festivals.  DVD extras include extended numerous deleted scenes (a couple of which I would have left in, to make the film a bit easier to comprehend), Kareem Mortimer;s (writer/director) commentary, and Mortimer's 2007 short film ""Float"" on which the longer film is based.

So I encourage anticipating this lovely element of an interracial story.  These two characters just add to the overall feast of beauty in this movie from beginning to end.  If not for the anti-gay tyranny, this would have been a great commercial to travel the Bahamas.I agree with other viewers the acting was top notch all the way around.

The cinematography was shot decently. There was definitely lots of angst with all the characters. Yet, I felt nothing for any of them. Maybe it needed more character development.I was disappointed because I expected it to be wonderful. And it wasn't. Even in it's genre. I thought it might be a romantic film, which it wasn't.

1426739,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B004RC8NZQ,J. Martin,"[3, 7]","Children of God is the feature-length expansion of a short movie called Float, about an uptight young gay white guy (Johnny) and a laid-back, mostly straight black guy (Romeo) who hook up in the Bahamas, where they both are natives. It was made by the same writer/director as Float and stars the same actor (Stephen Tyrone Williams) in the role of Romeo.It differs from Float primarily in three ways: a different actor plays Johnny; a parallel story of an intensely homophobic woman and her lying preacher husband is added; and the ending is changed. Only the first of those changes is an improvement.Johnny Ferro (playing Johnny) is gorgeous, charismatic, sensitive, sweet, shy, brooding, and very, VERY sexy; so it is totally believable that anyone on earth would fall for him. (The huge flaw in Float was that the poor actor who played Johnny was none of the above.) The story between Romeo and Johnny is practically identical to Float, and adding Johnny Ferro really makes it shine.But the side story of the lying preacher is just too corny and overwrought to believe. It doesn't fit with the Romeo/Johnny story at all, so it is only an annoying distraction. And the ending is just as bad: forced, clumsy, and painfully predictable all at the same time. The director should have cast Johnny Ferro in Float and stopped there, or remade Float with the vastly improved Johnny.Float with the right Johnny would be a lovely gem, but Children of God just does not work. However... I have never seen Ferro anywhere before, so just for introducing him to the world I gladly give this movie three stars. Except for the fact that Johnny Ferro is not in it, Float is a better movie.UPDATE 07-16-2011:I watched this movie again, and I have deducted one star from my original three. Although casting Johnny Ferro was an excellent decision, even the Romeo/Johnny story is much weaker than it was in Float. Overall this is a messy, frustrating movie that tries too much and accomplishes too little; and this time (in contrast to Float) it is Stephen Williams as Romeo who is miscast. He simply is not credible playing a gay man (Romeo was not gay in Float, but it seems that he is supposed to be gay in this one). I still give it two stars for introducing the remarkable Ferro, but that doesn't entirely compensate for an otherwise lousy movie. You can see more of my reasoning in the comment section below.Float is included on this DVD, but I would advise anyone who wants to see it to get the compilation DVDNot Gayinstead. It includes three other shorts about gay men relating to straight men, and two of those shorts are excellent, better than Float and MUCH better than Children of God.",2,Only Johnny Ferro makes it worth watching (UPDATED),1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2680,"['Children', 'God', 'feature-length', 'expansion', 'short', 'movie', 'called', 'Float', 'uptight', 'young', 'gay', 'white', 'guy', 'Johnny', 'laid-back', 'mostly', 'straight', 'black', 'guy', 'Romeo', 'who', 'hook', 'up', 'Bahamas', 'where', 'are', 'natives', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'writer/director', 'Float', 'same', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Tyrone', 'Williams', 'role', 'Romeo.It', 'differs', 'Float', 'primarily', 'three', 'ways', 'different', 'actor', 'plays', 'Johnny', 'parallel', 'story', 'intensely', 'homophobic', 'woman', 'lying', 'preacher', 'husband', 'added', 'ending', 'changed', 'Only', 'first', 'changes', 'improvement.Johnny', 'Ferro', 'playing', 'Johnny', 'gorgeous', 'charismatic', 'sensitive', 'sweet', 'shy', 'brooding', 'very', 'VERY', 'sexy', 'totally', 'believable', 'anyone', 'earth', 'would', 'fall', 'huge', 'flaw', 'Float', 'was', 'poor', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Johnny', 'was', 'none', 'above', 'story', 'Romeo', 'Johnny', 'practically', 'identical', 'Float', 'adding', 'Johnny', 'Ferro', 'really', 'side', 'story', 'lying', 'preacher', 'just', 'too', 'corny', 'overwrought', 'believe', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Romeo/Johnny', 'story', 'only', 'annoying', 'distraction', 'ending', 'just', 'bad', 'forced', 'clumsy', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'same', 'time', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'Johnny', 'Ferro', 'Float', 'stopped', 'there', 'remade', 'Float', 'vastly', 'improved', 'Johnny.Float', 'right', 'Johnny', 'would', 'be', 'lovely', 'gem', 'Children', 'God', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'However', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Ferro', 'anywhere', 'before', 'so', 'just', 'introducing', 'world', 'gladly', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'Ferro', 'not', 'Float', 'better', 'movie.UPDATE', '07-16-2011', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'have', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'original', 'three', 'casting', 'Johnny', 'Ferro', 'was', 'excellent', 'decision', 'even', 'Romeo/Johnny', 'story', 'much', 'weaker', 'was', 'Float', 'Overall', 'messy', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'accomplishes', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'contrast', 'Float', 'Stephen', 'Williams', 'Romeo', 'who', 'miscast', 'simply', 'not', 'credible', 'playing', 'gay', 'man', 'Romeo', 'was', 'not', 'gay', 'Float', 'supposed', 'be', 'gay', 'one', 'still', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'introducing', 'remarkable', 'Ferro', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'compensate', 'otherwise', 'lousy', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'reasoning', 'comment', 'section', 'below.Float', 'included', 'DVD', 'would', 'advise', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'get', 'compilation', 'DVDNot', 'Gayinstead', 'three', 'other', 'shorts', 'gay', 'men', 'relating', 'straight', 'men', 'two', 'shorts', 'are', 'excellent', 'better', 'Float', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Children', 'God']",Children Of God
1426740,ATASGS8HZHGIB,B004RC8NZQ,JohnnyC,"[0, 0]","This is somewhat of a tragic story, but still good as it illustrates how a couple of guys ultimately overcome the anxiety and fear of disapproval associated with their coming out--but for very different reasons.  One of the characters comes to grips with the importance of being true to himself (coming out) more from an existential standpoint (basically accepting that he's gay because God made him that way and there's nothing ""wrong"" with him because of it), and the other main character comes to grips with his need to come out more because his staying in the closet has caused him to lose someone he really loves.  This is the main plot of the story although there are some pretty clear subplots concerned with societal and religious discrimination against gays as well as the fact that there are people ""on the down-low"" that you might never expect. With everything all woven together, I found that one of the take-away messages (at least in my opinion) is that while society on the one-hand is upset with gay people ""sneaking around"" with regard to their sexuality, they on the other hand basically have created such a threatening environment for people who don't fit the accepted heterosexual norm that they FORCE people to sneak around and be less than genuine even to their closest friends and family (and sometimes, these people actually would be very accepting if they only knew!).  Anyway, I didn't mean to get into too much psychobabble here, but I just felt the story was thought provoking from a number of angles.  Also, it doesn't hurt that the main characters are cute and charming, and the setting is often beautiful (at least to those of us who like tropical places).

Somehow I missed the point.  I expected it to be very good from the title and movie description of what it was about.

1426742,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004RC8NZQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 14]","At the heart of Kareem Mortimer's ""Children of God"" are two stories--one of religious intolerance and one of self acceptance. This is perhaps not surprising considering that these two issues tend to be recurrent themes when dealing openly with homosexuality in film (and in life). Mortimer's piece is certainly an easy recommendation, but the two sides of the screenplay don't always rest in an easy alliance. On the one hand, the gentle and surprisingly subtle story of love awakening is expertly done with moments of amazing tenderness and real warmth. Conversely, as the picture attempts to deal with the political and religious aspects of the story--things can be a bit heavy handed. In many ways, I want to say this film is absolutely great and in many ways it is. But when it matters the most, the film gives in to some cliches that were completely unnecessary--including the most expected finale in films trying too hard to make a point. I guess I'm torn because I both loved this movie AND wished for more.Set in the Bahamas, the story introduces us to a shy art student (Johnny Ferro) grappling with his sexual identity. When he gets out of the city, he meets an alluring new friend (Stephen Tyrone Williams) who helps break down the barriers that he has built around himself. A mass of neurotic tendencies, Ferro is absolutely terrific and understated and is well matched by the appealing Williams. As Ferro starts to accept himself, Williams must also begin to face the expectations placed on him by his family and society in general. This story is so well told and heartfelt and I was completely won over. Concurrently, we meet a religious leader's wife who is leading a movement against homosexual rights. Of course, her hypocritical husband is a closeted man who has given her a venereal disease. How's that for convenient plotting? Everywhere you turn, characters are watching news about the rally and the political movement on television--it must be a monumental thing to be so widely viewed!After a big confrontation in church, things start to resolve themselves very quickly for everyone involved. But then we get that unfortunate ending. Mortimer opts for a poignant finish that has been telegraphed and used in dozens of other films--and it's a shame really, because prior to that the film really felt like it had a fresh and unique viewpoint. All the actors acquit themselves well, even in the religious subplot where the script pushes far beyond subtlety. I'm certainly not trying to sound discouraging--I loved most of the movie. I happen to think this has many elements of depth and power and had the potential to be a brilliant film. It falls short in the end (for me anyway)--but still remains a significantly accomplished, professional, and well made entry into a genre that needs all the good films it can get.

Amazon has been gamed by sock puppet reviewers--apparently with some kind of stake in the film--writing totally over-the-top raves for a very simple-minded movie about the hateful bigotry of the evangelical right, which, I am depressed to report, is hardly a revelation.Seriously, please take a look for yourself and ask if this really measures up to four and five star international films.  There is a faction who believe that GBLT movies deserve some kind of special dispensation--sort of like a Special Olympics for cinematically challenged gay filmmakers--which is insulting and demeaning.  Is there any rational reason why filmmakers should be judged less rigorously because they have a minority affectionate preference or choose GBLT subject matter.  It's absurd.Joel Shumacher, Gus Van Sant and William Friedkin are three very accomplished filmmakers--whatever one may think of their respective bodies of work--who never asked to be excused from making successful pictures merely because they were queer.The movie is crap, and even on it's on terms, an incoherent mess.  The white protagonist gets killed because he taunts a young black man about the size of his penis in front of the black kid's friends.  Could anyone possibly be so braindead?  Similarly, preaching to the choir while lobbing stink bombs at the religious right is never going to help anyone and only incites the bigots to become more entrenched in their beliefs that GBLT people are despicable fools.This is a student film that never should have seen wide release on video.  The filmmaker has much to learn about effectively using the movie medium.  For starters, he could heed Samuel Goldwyn, who knew from movies, and his famous dictum: ""If you have a message, send a telegram.""There are far more subtle, skilled, and useful means to broaden awareness than this ham-fisted polemic.  Sadly, I have already gone over the top of the heads of these overly enthusiatic kids gushing such glowing reviews of first time student effort.  I fear ""ham-fisted polemic"" is too complex a concept for these wannabe publicists to grasp.BTW, The first essential quality for a successful publicist is credibility.
