Unless you believe the Soviet show trials, which Davies witnessed, & killed & imprisoned millions were fair & just. I'm not sure that Ambassador Davies himself believed everything he wrote. But he was a minion of Franklin Roosevelt & FDR got what he wanted. Perhaps there was method to FDR's madness. Long range, before the war, FDR might have figured that one day we would be fighting the Nazis. Having an ally in the east tying up Hitler seemed like a good idea. That was a bumpy ride for five years until we entered the war.  It included the Soviet non-aggression pact with Nazi-Germany & the invasion of Finland, an independent, free nation. FDR never figured out Stalin. For the man that handled everyone he never got Stalin. Churchill knew & later Harry Truman immediately knew he was a man you could not do business with. Warner Brothers was prevailed upon to make a movie based on Davies book. It starred Walter Huston & is very good. It is the subject which we view today as maddening. What was seen by many as a patriotic act by Warner Brothers, in 1942 was seen as treasonous five years later by a very hypocritical Congress. Life in the Soviet Union was not couragous & glorious as portayed in the movie. It is however an important & informative propaganda piece viewed from the distance of so many years. Nazi Germany does not exist. The Soviet Union does not exist & The British Empire does not exist. In many ways neither do we. The movie has a little extra by the real Joseph Davies.

1326092,A33WFRICMYRPT6,B003552QVS,"M.A. Hallisey ""Potius mori quam foedari!""","[31, 41]","Wow!History has not been kind to Stalin - we are finally seeing him for the brutal despot he was (arguments to necessity aside, the human cost for his vision of the Soviet Union far exceeded the claims of even his harshest critics).And history has not been kind to Ambassador Joseph Davies either.""Mission to Moscow"" is classic propaganda, a Hollywood effort to bring Americans around to supporting FDR's desire for a WWII U.S. partnership with the Soviet Union.  Seen from 60 years further on and the advantage of hindsight (as opposed to the real worry and uncertainty of the day), this movie is both a hoot and a tragedy.  In getting this film made, FDR showed why no one in recent American history can top him as our American ""Prince.""  The film's narrative of world events is so simplistic, so wrong, and so manipulative as to be nothing less than grossly offensive, condescending, and extraordinarily cynical.  The stereotyping is so extreme as to be racist, the pro-Soviet angle so extreme as to be... well, is there a word that means ""so naive as to defy any explanation of reality""?  ""Capitalism"" is an opportunistic, amoral enemy; FDR's Republican opponents are God-less atheists.  The movie is one long visit to a Russian Alice's Wonderland - a surreal 123 minutes of agitation-propaganda (I need to recheck the credits to see if Stalin supplied someone from his Agit/Prop Ministry to advise the producers/director...)!The dupe for the the rest of history in both print and film is clearly Ambassador Joseph Davies. If he truly believed what he wrote in his memoirs, he must rank as one of the most clueless men in (modern) history.  FDR picked well - Davies sees himself as a humble public servant whom FDR wisely entrusts to be the President's eyes and ears in the Soviet Union.  But Davies is actually nothing like his self-perceived image.  He is ultimately ill-prepared to be an objective observer, as his arrogance, ignorance, and self-righteousness make him FDR's perfect fall guy.  Davies must be the most thoroughly ""played"" public official in U.S. diplomatic history.  Despite his claims of being an impartial, objective observer, Davies was nothing more than a tool who saw what he was told to see and reported what he was told to report.For me, the four best moments in the film come from a) Davies - chiding his embassy officials for criticizing Soviet bugging of foreign embassies (after all, how will the Soviets learn to trust us unless they can listen to our most private conversations and see we mean them no harm), b) from Davies again - helping the officially atheist Soviet Union is the Christian thing to do, c) from Bukharin (during the Purge ""show trials"" section) - waxing (ultimately ironically) poetic about the meaning of facts and reality, and d) the closing song - which ever-so-helpfully cites Genesis and reminds us that we are, in fact, our brothers' keepers.  I wanted to pause the movie and see if there was a Lincoln Brigade in the area willing to accept my enlistment!The naivet&eacute; of the 1930s was sad, but understandable and thus, perhaps excusable.  The willful arrogance of Davies is none of these.  Thus, the movie and the irony of it all is pathetic, but perversely delicious.  Given the myriad domestic and international difficulties Roosevelt faced (or believed he faced) in seeing the war through to a favorable U.S. outcome, I suppose FDR felt justified pulling no punches and using whatever tricks up his sleeve to do whatever he saw necessary.  ""Mission to Moscow"" (both the memoir and this movie) helps us to understand just how far FDR was willing to go in deceiving the American electorate to accomplish just that.Even though the ""puppet"" is deaf, dumb, and blind (and Davies was abundantly blessed in all three categories), it is the truly gifted ""prince"" who ensures blame falls on the puppet and not on the puppet master.  And in the 60 years since FDR's monumental effort to deceive the U.S. public with regard to the Soviet Union, he still looks good - FDR's legacy remains intact.  Davies, on the other hand, will be remembered as the consumate tool and the complete fool.  Yes, Machiavelli would have been very proud of Mr. Roosevelt.And is that Confucius in the role of Kalinin...?",5,"Desperation, Dupes, & Deceit - Hollywood's Most Cynical & Entertaining Effort To Help FDR",1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,4257,"['Wow', 'History', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Stalin', 'are', 'finally', 'seeing', 'brutal', 'despot', 'was', 'arguments', 'necessity', 'aside', 'human', 'cost', 'vision', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'far', 'exceeded', 'claims', 'even', 'harshest', 'critics', '.And', 'history', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Ambassador', 'Joseph', 'Davies', 'either', 'Mission', 'Moscow', 'classic', 'propaganda', 'Hollywood', 'effort', 'bring', 'Americans', 'supporting', 'FDR', 'desire', 'WWII', 'U.S.', 'partnership', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Seen', '60', 'years', 'further', 'advantage', 'hindsight', 'opposed', 'real', 'worry', 'uncertainty', 'day', 'movie', 'hoot', 'tragedy', 'getting', 'film', 'made', 'FDR', 'showed', 'why', 'one', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'can', 'top', 'American', 'Prince', 'film', 'narrative', 'world', 'events', 'so', 'simplistic', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'manipulative', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'grossly', 'offensive', 'condescending', 'extraordinarily', 'cynical', 'stereotyping', 'so', 'extreme', 'be', 'racist', 'pro-Soviet', 'angle', 'so', 'extreme', 'be', 'well', 'there', 'word', 'so', 'naive', 'defy', 'explanation', 'reality', 'Capitalism', 'opportunistic', 'amoral', 'enemy', 'FDR', 'Republican', 'opponents', 'are', 'God-less', 'atheists', 'movie', 'one', 'long', 'visit', 'Russian', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'surreal', '123', 'minutes', 'agitation-propaganda', 'need', 'recheck', 'credits', 'see', 'Stalin', 'supplied', 'someone', 'Agit/Prop', 'Ministry', 'advise', 'producers/director', 'dupe', 'rest', 'history', 'print', 'film', 'clearly', 'Ambassador', 'Joseph', 'Davies', 'truly', 'believed', 'what', 'wrote', 'memoirs', 'must', 'rank', 'one', 'most', 'clueless', 'men', 'modern', 'history', 'FDR', 'picked', 'well', 'Davies', 'humble', 'public', 'servant', 'whom', 'FDR', 'wisely', 'be', 'President', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Davies', 'actually', 'nothing', 'self-perceived', 'image', 'ultimately', 'ill-prepared', 'be', 'objective', 'observer', 'arrogance', 'ignorance', 'self-righteousness', 'make', 'FDR', 'perfect', 'fall', 'guy', 'Davies', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'played', 'public', 'official', 'U.S.', 'diplomatic', 'history', 'claims', 'being', 'impartial', 'objective', 'observer', 'Davies', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'tool', 'who', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'see', 'reported', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'report.For', 'four', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'come', 'chiding', 'embassy', 'officials', 'criticizing', 'Soviet', 'bugging', 'foreign', 'embassies', 'how', 'will', 'Soviets', 'learn', 'trust', 'can', 'listen', 'most', 'private', 'conversations', 'see', 'mean', 'harm', 'b', 'Davies', 'again', 'helping', 'officially', 'atheist', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Christian', 'thing', 'do', 'c', 'Bukharin', 'Purge', 'show', 'trials', 'section', 'waxing', 'ultimately', 'ironically', 'poetic', 'meaning', 'facts', 'reality', 'd', 'closing', 'song', 'ever-so-helpfully', 'Genesis', 'are', 'fact', 'brothers', 'keepers', 'wanted', 'pause', 'movie', 'see', 'was', 'Lincoln', 'Brigade', 'area', 'willing', 'accept', 'enlistment', 'naivet', 'eacute', '1930s', 'was', 'sad', 'understandable', 'thus', 'perhaps', 'excusable', 'willful', 'arrogance', 'Davies', 'none', 'Thus', 'movie', 'irony', 'pathetic', 'perversely', 'delicious', 'Given', 'myriad', 'domestic', 'international', 'difficulties', 'Roosevelt', 'faced', 'believed', 'faced', 'seeing', 'war', 'favorable', 'U.S.', 'outcome', 'suppose', 'FDR', 'felt', 'justified', 'pulling', 'punches', 'using', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'do', 'whatever', 'saw', 'necessary', 'Mission', 'Moscow', 'memoir', 'movie', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'FDR', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'deceiving', 'American', 'electorate', 'accomplish', 'just', 'that.Even', 'puppet', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'blind', 'Davies', 'was', 'abundantly', 'blessed', 'three', 'categories', 'truly', 'gifted', 'prince', 'who', 'blame', 'falls', 'puppet', 'not', 'puppet', 'master', '60', 'years', 'FDR', 'monumental', 'effort', 'deceive', 'U.S.', 'public', 'regard', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'still', 'good', 'FDR', 'legacy', 'intact', 'Davies', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'consumate', 'tool', 'complete', 'fool', 'Yes', 'Machiavelli', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'proud', 'Mr.', 'Roosevelt.And', 'Confucius', 'role', 'Kalinin']",N/A
1326093,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B003552QVS,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[6, 8]","This is a well-known propaganda film done in America during world war II. Its most famous for its absolutely pro-stalinist point of view. As a film, its horrible. But as a historical window into the mind of the pro-soviet faction in American politics of that era, its very interesting.The film is based on a book by Joseph E. Davies covering his term running the American Embassy in Moscow in the 1930s. Davies was a politican who turned his political connections into a lucrative career as a legal/political ""fixer"" for large American corporations. He was married to the ultra-wealthy Marjorie Merriweather Post.The first thing to note about Davies is that his view of American business and the American economy is from the perspective of a corrupt political lobbyist. And from the view of someone who operated in that role, the American and Soviet systems might not look as different as they would to others. The sort of influence peddling Davies was engaged in existed in both systems. To Davies, the operation of a free market or profit/loss was irrelivant. American companies influenced Washington through the budget. Soviet interests influnced Moscow through the five-year plan. The systems, from his naive point of view, were exactly the same.The second thing to note in the film is that when he enters soviet society, he operates just as in America at the very top of the upper class. He socializes with the soviet elite who have access to luxury goods, cultural events and a different way of life from the rest of the population. And again, from his naive point of view, the United States and Soviet union are not much different in the way the top of the social order live.And then there is the attitude toward spying. As with many within the Roosevelt administration, Davies throught nothing wrong with being spied on by the soviets. The concept was that by allowing them to spy at will, the Soviets would come to trust Americans. To even question the soviets in this regard would be the height of bad manners. Behind this was the idea that all problems in soviet-American relations were the result of ""misunderstandings"" that had bred mistrust between the countries.Associated as well was the idea that anything said by the Soviet Union must be taken at face value and not questioned. If the Soviet Union said someone was a criminal, who were Americans to question that? To question anything the soviet union said or did was a sign of paranoia. When the Soviet legal system produced ""confessions"" and trials, it was the obligation of rational people to take whatever was said at face value. The film defends the purge trials and the great terror on those grounds. If the soviets say that people are guilty, they are guilty. If the soviets say that there is a international conspiracy aimed at economic sabotage, there is one.The film is also (oddly) a celebration of soviet militarism. The Nazi militarism the film (rightly) attacks in a brief visit for Germany is celebrated as a clever strategy for defense when it is shown in soviet terms in the Soviet Union. Military parades, tractor factories that can be converted quickly to building tanks, the mobilization and militarization of the entire civilian population are all celebrated in the Soviet context. While it looks the same as Nazi militarism, we are told that it is somehow noble and defensive.In political terms, the film goes out of its way to attack the British and French. We are told that both governments contain secret ""reactionaries"" who are conspiring to push the Soviet Union and Germany into war. We are as much as told that the Soviet Union is the sole voice for the Wilsonian legacy at the League of Nations. Its very much in line with the foolish ideas held by some Americans that the Soviet Union and United States represented the two new systems for the world. That everything else was rubbish to be pushed aside.The film of course does not talk about Davies' looting of Russian art treasures. That He and his wife were allowed to take almost anything they wanted at nominal prices. They were literally allowed to ""shop"" within the collections of the top russian museums.The film is ultimately (for me) about an upper-class political goon whose wealth so divorces him from reality, that fails to understand anything going on around him in Stalin's Soviet Union of the 1930s. Its value is not in its propaganda, but in its main character being so out of touch with reality.",4,interesting as political history rather than as a film,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,4460,"['well-known', 'propaganda', 'film', 'done', 'America', 'world', 'war', 'II', 'most', 'famous', 'absolutely', 'pro-stalinist', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'horrible', 'historical', 'window', 'mind', 'pro-soviet', 'faction', 'American', 'politics', 'era', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Joseph', 'E.', 'Davies', 'covering', 'term', 'running', 'American', 'Embassy', 'Moscow', '1930s', 'Davies', 'was', 'politican', 'who', 'turned', 'political', 'connections', 'lucrative', 'career', 'legal/political', 'fixer', 'large', 'American', 'corporations', 'was', 'married', 'ultra-wealthy', 'Marjorie', 'Merriweather', 'Post.The', 'first', 'thing', 'note', 'Davies', 'view', 'American', 'business', 'American', 'economy', 'perspective', 'corrupt', 'political', 'lobbyist', 'view', 'someone', 'who', 'operated', 'role', 'American', 'Soviet', 'systems', 'might', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'different', 'would', 'others', 'sort', 'influence', 'peddling', 'Davies', 'was', 'engaged', 'existed', 'systems', 'Davies', 'operation', 'free', 'market', 'profit/loss', 'was', 'irrelivant', 'American', 'companies', 'influenced', 'Washington', 'budget', 'Soviet', 'interests', 'influnced', 'Moscow', 'five-year', 'plan', 'systems', 'naive', 'point', 'view', 'were', 'exactly', 'same.The', 'second', 'thing', 'note', 'film', 'when', 'soviet', 'society', 'just', 'America', 'very', 'top', 'upper', 'class', 'soviet', 'elite', 'who', 'have', 'access', 'luxury', 'goods', 'cultural', 'events', 'different', 'way', 'life', 'rest', 'population', 'again', 'naive', 'point', 'view', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'union', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'way', 'top', 'social', 'order', 'live.And', 'then', 'attitude', 'spying', 'many', 'Roosevelt', 'administration', 'Davies', 'throught', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'spied', 'soviets', 'concept', 'was', 'allowing', 'spy', 'will', 'Soviets', 'would', 'come', 'trust', 'Americans', 'even', 'question', 'soviets', 'regard', 'would', 'be', 'height', 'bad', 'manners', 'was', 'idea', 'problems', 'soviet-American', 'relations', 'were', 'result', 'misunderstandings', 'had', 'bred', 'mistrust', 'countries.Associated', 'well', 'was', 'idea', 'anything', 'said', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'not', 'questioned', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'said', 'someone', 'was', 'criminal', 'who', 'were', 'Americans', 'question', 'question', 'anything', 'soviet', 'union', 'said', 'did', 'was', 'sign', 'paranoia', 'When', 'Soviet', 'legal', 'system', 'produced', 'confessions', 'trials', 'was', 'obligation', 'rational', 'people', 'take', 'was', 'said', 'face', 'value', 'film', 'purge', 'trials', 'great', 'terror', 'grounds', 'soviets', 'say', 'people', 'are', 'guilty', 'are', 'guilty', 'soviets', 'say', 'international', 'conspiracy', 'aimed', 'economic', 'sabotage', 'one.The', 'film', 'also', 'oddly', 'celebration', 'soviet', 'militarism', 'Nazi', 'militarism', 'film', 'rightly', 'attacks', 'brief', 'visit', 'Germany', 'celebrated', 'clever', 'strategy', 'defense', 'when', 'shown', 'soviet', 'terms', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Military', 'parades', 'tractor', 'factories', 'can', 'be', 'converted', 'quickly', 'building', 'tanks', 'mobilization', 'militarization', 'entire', 'civilian', 'population', 'are', 'celebrated', 'Soviet', 'context', 'same', 'Nazi', 'militarism', 'are', 'told', 'somehow', 'noble', 'defensive.In', 'political', 'terms', 'film', 'way', 'attack', 'British', 'French', 'are', 'told', 'governments', 'contain', 'secret', 'reactionaries', 'who', 'are', 'conspiring', 'push', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Germany', 'war', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'told', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'sole', 'voice', 'Wilsonian', 'legacy', 'League', 'Nations', 'very', 'much', 'line', 'foolish', 'ideas', 'held', 'Americans', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'United', 'States', 'represented', 'two', 'new', 'systems', 'world', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'rubbish', 'be', 'pushed', 'aside.The', 'film', 'course', 'not', 'talk', 'Davies', 'looting', 'Russian', 'art', 'treasures', 'wife', 'were', 'allowed', 'take', 'almost', 'anything', 'wanted', 'nominal', 'prices', 'were', 'literally', 'allowed', 'shop', 'collections', 'top', 'russian', 'museums.The', 'film', 'ultimately', 'upper-class', 'political', 'goon', 'wealth', 'so', 'reality', 'understand', 'anything', 'going', 'Stalin', 'Soviet', 'Union', '1930s', 'value', 'not', 'propaganda', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'touch', 'reality']",N/A
