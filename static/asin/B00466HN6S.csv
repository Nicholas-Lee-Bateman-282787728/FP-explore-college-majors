In the grand tradition of films like The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks comes Hop, the tale of a CGI rabbit who dreams of becoming a drummer and instead crosses paths with a slacker human with a surprising knack for delivering Easter candy to kids the world over. Let's be honest here: Alvin and the Chipmunks made over $350 million worldwide at the box office and spawned two sequels, and Hop made over $180 million itself. In other words, even though the movie was horrible, it's pretty clear I am not the target demographic. Want something silly and formulaic to babysit the kids while you tend the barbecue?

Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) is a slacker-dude who's last in line for any job at all.3. E.B. flees the Easter factory (on Easter Island of course) to follow his drumming dream.4. Fred flees the family home to drum up a dream job.5. Naturally they meet up, and strangely they don't realize that they have a lot in common.6. Meanwhile, back at Easter Island, a yellow angry bird (voiced by Hank Azaria) has some destructive plans, and Mr. Bunny (voiced by Hugh Laurie) dispatches his elite pink hit squad to find and recover E.B. before Easter.7. Some funny bits can be found within a rather predictable story-line, made easier by the fact that the movie opens with Fred letting the peep out of the bag.A great cast and slamming sound-track help this movie along, but under the eggshell that is the wonderful visual experience of the Easter factory lies a half-boiled story-line that never quite adds up to a pile of jelly beans.Amanda Richards, July 23, 2011",3,Hip HOP,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,1084,"['Short', 'attention', 'span', 'summary:1', 'E.B', 'voice', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'slacker-bunny', 'who', 'next', 'line', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'job.2', 'Fred', ""O'Hare"", 'James', 'Marsden', 'slacker-dude', 'who', 'last', 'line', 'job', 'all.3', 'E.B', 'Easter', 'factory', 'Easter', 'Island', 'course', 'follow', 'drumming', 'dream.4', 'Fred', 'family', 'home', 'drum', 'up', 'dream', 'job.5', 'Naturally', 'meet', 'up', 'strangely', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'have', 'lot', 'common.6', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'Easter', 'Island', 'yellow', 'angry', 'bird', 'voiced', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'destructive', 'plans', 'Mr.', 'Bunny', 'voiced', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'elite', 'pink', 'hit', 'squad', 'find', 'recover', 'E.B', 'Easter.7', 'funny', 'bits', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'rather', 'predictable', 'story-line', 'made', 'easier', 'fact', 'movie', 'Fred', 'letting', 'peep', 'bag.A', 'great', 'cast', 'slamming', 'sound-track', 'help', 'movie', 'eggshell', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'experience', 'Easter', 'factory', 'half-boiled', 'story-line', 'never', 'quite', 'up', 'pile', 'jelly', 'beans.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '23', '2011']",N/A

It's not in the category of ""Despicle me"" or ""Toy Story-3"" (or 1, or 2) but still lots of fun. In the beginning it has a bit of Willy Wonka feel to it, while more to the end, it leans more to Santa. But it's all Easter-bunny power (sorry for the chicks). I liked it better at the beginning, and the middle. Quite some surprise-jokes there. But somewhere before the end, I get the feeling, the makers suddenly realize they need to bring to movie to an end. From that point on everything gets very rushed and quick-paced and to me the movie looses some of it's magic at that point. But still we had lots of fun.

1386453,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,B00466HN6S,"Astral ""Astral""","[2, 3]","If you go into this hoping it is another clever, funny creation like ""Despicable Me"" then you will be sorely disappointed.  If you are hoping for a candy colored adorable ride through the world of the Easter bunny, you will also be disappointed.  If what you are looking for is more along the lines of the Smurf and Chipmunks CGI/live action mashups, then you will come away at least somewhat satisfied, but that sure is a low bar to set for a film...Hop starts off at quite the encouraging hop.  E.B. as a baby bunny with his huge cotton tail and adorable mannerisms is just too precious for words.  He is being raised to take over for his father, who is THE current Easter Bunny and the one that makes it happen every Easter.  All those eggs and baskets in such a short time, even the little bunny is feeling pressured already to fill in such huge rabbit shoes.  One of the best parts of the movie is here, a look into the glorious factory that makes all the candy on Easter Island.  It is cleverly designed with rainbows of skittles, shiny Hershey's kisses, chocolate easter bunnies, baskets being filled, it's controlled chaos in a sticky sweet setting that is clever and awe inspiring.  It gives you hope for the film... that is until you see the interview with the script writers in the extras.  All they had to write was ""factory"" and OTHER people did all the work in making that something memorable.  Too bad their imaginations weren't set free on the story for Hop, otherwise we'd see something better than a movie concocted by people boring enough to just write ""factory"" and be done with it...E.B. grows up to be an antsy, rebellious, plaid wearing teenager.  He looks like something from the mid 90s or a skater kid in a bunny suit.  His dream is to drum... not be an Easter Bunny so instead of stepping up to the plate on the eve of his coronation as new Easter Bunny, he takes off, slacks off and annoys his way into the life of slacker Fred O'Hare, a human who has let his father down as well, by being a leech on his family's goodwill and a sofa landmark.  They throw Fred out of the house for not getting grown up enough to even get a burger slinging job, but instead of being taught a lesson by having to sleep in his car or turn in some resumes, his sister sneaks out and gives him the keys to a mansion.  She just happens to be house sitting her boss's mansion... how convenient!So slacker E.B. and slacker Fred end up together in a mansion and hijinks ensue, although nothing particularly interesting.  There's a big with David Hasselhoff.  There's a rather inappropriate bit about the Playboy mansion as well, which was just insulting to have in a children's movie.  They didn't take it far enough to have to explain anything to my kids at least, but i'm sure others picked up on it.  And nothing in the movie particularly does anything amusing or right after that... the pink beret bunnies that are let out to capture E.B. and bring him back to Easter Island (under his father's orders) are adorable, and offer a bit of tension but they aren't fully realized either.There's a happy ending, a chick that wants to take over and be the Easter Bunny and almost kills E.B., Fred and The Easter Bunny by lowering them into some kind of boiling confection liquid, and they let the bird off the hook by the end... it's all swept under the rug.  Fred gets his dream job - of being the Easter Bunny (what?) and E.B. grows up just enough to realize he can drum AND be the co-Easter Bunny.  Roll credits.The kids liked it, but this is not one that many grown ups will want to be revisiting with its tired gags and embarrassing moments.  The rabbit getting overly friendly with Fred's sister and asking afterward if she's available was a cringe worthy creepy moment... that went on far too long.  Unfortunately HOP is filled with way too many of these eye-rolling bits that just make you wish it would all go back to Easter Island... at least things were more interesting and fantastical there.",2,Kids Will Like It... the Rest of Us....,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,4004,"['go', 'hoping', 'clever', 'funny', 'creation', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'are', 'hoping', 'candy', 'colored', 'adorable', 'ride', 'world', 'Easter', 'bunny', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'lines', 'Smurf', 'Chipmunks', 'CGI/live', 'action', 'mashups', 'then', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'least', 'somewhat', 'satisfied', 'sure', 'low', 'bar', 'set', 'film', 'Hop', 'off', 'quite', 'encouraging', 'hop', 'E.B', 'baby', 'bunny', 'huge', 'cotton', 'tail', 'adorable', 'mannerisms', 'just', 'too', 'precious', 'words', 'being', 'raised', 'take', 'over', 'father', 'who', 'THE', 'current', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'one', 'happen', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'baskets', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'even', 'little', 'bunny', 'feeling', 'pressured', 'already', 'fill', 'such', 'huge', 'rabbit', 'shoes', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'here', 'look', 'glorious', 'factory', 'candy', 'Easter', 'Island', 'cleverly', 'designed', 'rainbows', 'skittles', 'shiny', 'Hershey', 'kisses', 'chocolate', 'easter', 'bunnies', 'baskets', 'being', 'filled', 'controlled', 'chaos', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'setting', 'clever', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'hope', 'film', 'see', 'interview', 'script', 'writers', 'extras', 'had', 'write', 'was', 'factory', 'OTHER', 'people', 'did', 'work', 'making', 'something', 'memorable', 'Too', 'bad', 'imaginations', 'were', ""n't"", 'set', 'free', 'story', 'Hop', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'see', 'something', 'better', 'movie', 'concocted', 'people', 'boring', 'enough', 'just', 'write', 'factory', 'be', 'done', 'E.B', 'up', 'be', 'antsy', 'rebellious', 'plaid', 'wearing', 'teenager', 'something', 'mid', '90s', 'skater', 'kid', 'bunny', 'suit', 'dream', 'drum', 'not', 'be', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'instead', 'stepping', 'up', 'plate', 'eve', 'coronation', 'new', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'off', 'slacks', 'annoys', 'way', 'life', 'slacker', 'Fred', ""O'Hare"", 'human', 'who', 'let', 'father', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'leech', 'family', 'goodwill', 'sofa', 'landmark', 'throw', 'Fred', 'house', 'not', 'getting', 'grown', 'up', 'enough', 'even', 'get', 'burger', 'slinging', 'job', 'instead', 'being', 'taught', 'lesson', 'having', 'sleep', 'car', 'turn', 'resumes', 'sister', 'out', 'keys', 'mansion', 'just', 'be', 'house', 'sitting', 'boss', 'mansion', 'how', 'convenient', 'So', 'slacker', 'E.B', 'slacker', 'Fred', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'mansion', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'big', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'rather', 'inappropriate', 'bit', 'Playboy', 'mansion', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'insulting', 'have', 'children', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'far', 'enough', 'have', 'explain', 'anything', 'kids', 'least', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'picked', 'up', 'nothing', 'movie', 'particularly', 'anything', 'amusing', 'right', 'pink', 'beret', 'bunnies', 'are', 'let', 'capture', 'E.B', 'bring', 'back', 'Easter', 'Island', 'father', 'orders', 'are', 'adorable', 'offer', 'bit', 'tension', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'happy', 'ending', 'chick', 'take', 'over', 'be', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'almost', 'kills', 'E.B.', 'Fred', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'lowering', 'kind', 'boiling', 'confection', 'liquid', 'let', 'bird', 'hook', 'end', 'swept', 'rug', 'Fred', 'dream', 'job', 'being', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'what', 'E.B', 'up', 'just', 'enough', 'realize', 'can', 'drum', 'be', 'co-Easter', 'Bunny', 'Roll', 'credits.The', 'kids', 'liked', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'grown', 'ups', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'revisiting', 'tired', 'gags', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'rabbit', 'getting', 'overly', 'friendly', 'Fred', 'sister', 'asking', 'afterward', 'available', 'was', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'creepy', 'moment', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Unfortunately', 'HOP', 'filled', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'eye-rolling', 'bits', 'just', 'make', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'Easter', 'Island', 'least', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'fantastical', 'there']",N/A

There weren't many choices so I ended up seeing this one. The children in the theatre  liked it. So If you're looking to take the kids  that area is pretty much covered. If you're looking for something you might like as well there will be a problem. The film itself is mediocre and extremely predictable.Eb, the future ""Easter Bunny"" enjoys a great life on Easter island (The actual location) he is very close to his father , the current Easter Bunny who  oversees the factory for easter baskets and their contents.The latter is run by chicks.  From a very young age shows he quite talented at drumming. It isn't long before he decides he wants it to be his career. His father  deems this dream ridiculous and thus EB leaves Easter Island and eventually meets Fred O Hare, a man who hasn't worked in over a year and keeps botching every job interview he gets.You can guess what happens from there and I'm certain you'll get it right.There is nothing unique or remotely appealing in this film It's just one of the things  that can only be described as ""Cute""Some parts I feel  ccan be described as cheesy simply because of the cast. It seems they just threw together a medley of has-beens and rising groups. David Hasslehoff makes an appearance as well the Blind Boys of Alabama.I was also a little irked by the stereotypical implications of the voices. The chicks speak with a hispanic accent and are the primary workers in the factory. When EB is around the Blind Boys (An african American group of blind men)  he speaks  (Or tries to.) In a stereotypical dialect.The film could have done without that.So if you like the predictable or just need something to take the kids to this'll be ok. emphasis on ""OK""",3,Eh.,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,1785,"['had', 'pick', 'something', 'see', 'theatre', 'when', 'family', 'decided', 'go', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'choices', 'so', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'one', 'children', 'theatre', 'liked', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'take', 'kids', 'area', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'might', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'problem', 'film', 'mediocre', 'extremely', 'predictable.Eb', 'future', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'great', 'life', 'Easter', 'island', 'actual', 'location', 'very', 'close', 'father', 'current', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'who', 'factory', 'easter', 'baskets', 'contents.The', 'latter', 'run', 'chicks', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'quite', 'talented', 'drumming', ""n't"", 'long', 'be', 'career', 'father', 'dream', 'ridiculous', 'thus', 'EB', 'Easter', 'Island', 'eventually', 'meets', 'Fred', 'O', 'Hare', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'worked', 'year', 'botching', 'job', 'interview', 'gets.You', 'can', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'certain', ""'ll"", 'get', 'nothing', 'unique', 'remotely', 'appealing', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Cute', 'parts', 'feel', 'ccan', 'be', 'described', 'cheesy', 'simply', 'cast', 'just', 'threw', 'together', 'medley', 'has-beens', 'rising', 'groups', 'David', 'Hasslehoff', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'Blind', 'Boys', 'Alabama.I', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'irked', 'stereotypical', 'implications', 'voices', 'chicks', 'speak', 'hispanic', 'accent', 'are', 'primary', 'workers', 'factory', 'When', 'EB', 'Blind', 'Boys', 'african', 'American', 'group', 'men', 'stereotypical', 'dialect.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'that.So', 'like', 'predictable', 'just', 'need', 'something', 'take', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ok.', 'emphasis', 'OK']",N/A

In place of a nonsensical farce filled with more rubbish than a fleet of garbage trucks, in Hop we are treated to a whimsical tale with positive messages and loads of good old fashioned fantasy style fun. Anyone who grew up watching Rankin Bass holiday specials on TV will appreciate the classic themes beautifully updated for the modern day in Hop. Usually it works to advantage, occasionally it falls short.The visual landscape and the animation of the characters is startlingly realitic and very quickly has you feeling you're just watching a regular movie where animals really do talk and there really is a secret lair of the easter bunny.Like some other reviewers noted, there is a definite Willy Wonka meets christmas with Santa theme going here, and that's what really works. Visiting the people of the world only once a year and mastermminding the secrecy of the operation, many times the characters seem bogged down with non-information about the world inhabited by people, and thats just classic comedy perfection.There are some weak points scattered about, but somehow, overall in the scheme of the movie, they are momentary and forgotten immediately as EB, our main character, immediately after a shortcoming does something else heartwarming to endear you to him and his situation.When I emerged from the theater, I felt as though I saw a very substantial film, quite a task in an animated holiday kids movie, and one that involves Easter, a holiday not usually covered by cinema in terms of kids fare. What holiday can they take on next? I really don't care as long as the result is of the high quality that Hop exhits throughout.

I was pleasantly surprised by this wholesome, cute, and fairly consistently funny little flick.  The story centers around a slacker 30ish guy living at home, mostly unemployed, and without any direction or motivation, much to the chagrin of his family.  Simultaneously we meet a similarly unmotivated, directionless slacker bunny living near Easter Island with his father (none other than the Easter Bunny) shunning the expectation that he'll take over for his father and hoping instead to become a famous drummer.  The paths of young human and young rabbit meet and together they help one another grow up & discover their true callings.The animation is top notch, and the mixture of live action & animation is handled seamlessly to winsome effect.  The overall attitude is family-friendly with only a few possibly objectionable bits: a brief scene where the bunny tries to get into the Playboy Mansion because he's heard it's where 'sexy' bunnies go & he considers himself sexy, and a few utterances of ""Oh my God.""  The PG rating is appropriate but it's a very mild PG and probably suitable for all ages.  Even our 3 year old found nothing to be frightened by, which is unusual.The biggest strengths are crisp writing and humor that works for the most part.

Instead of signaling (as I'd hoped) the rise of another great animation studio, Hop makes me fear for the upcoming Despicable Me sequel. Perhaps these people AREN'T that brilliant after all; perhaps they merely got lucky.Somewhat surprisingly, this movie begins by giving away a big part of the ending, that slacker Fred becomes the first human Easter Bunny, but after you've suffered through it the reason becomes obvious: to keep the audience from hating E.B. even more as we watch him callously and selfishly ruining Fred's life.By far the best part of the movie follows as viewers along with a young E.B. are taken upon an extensive tour of the amazing factory that makes all the goodies that go into Easter baskets; enjoy it while it lasts because it is all downhill from here.Many years later, the once adorably cute young E.B. is now grown, though far from grownup.  Faced with a father who refuses to listen to his last minute announcement that he wants to be a drummer not the Easter Bunny, E.B. does what any selfish and useless slacker would do;he bails for Hollywood two weeks before Easter, leaving chaos in his wake and bringing a lot of chaos with him into the human world, specifically into the life of another useless slacker, Fred O'Hare whose family is shown engaging in a desperate and unfunny parody of an ""intervention"" in order to get his lazy rear end off the couch and back into the working world.  Despite ham-handed attempts to make his family into the bad guys, it is hard not to despise callous and selfish Fred...until even more despicable E.B. shows up and does the impossible: make the audience occasionally sympathize with Fred because he's finally met someone less likable than he is.  The absolute nadir has to be when while selfishly stowing away with Fred (after promising not to) E.B. pops out and pushes Fred into ruining his adopted baby sister's Easter pageant for no apparent reason other than his own selfish cruelty.

1386484,A3GQXLVWTJLARH,B00466HN6S,Gordo the Gatling Gun,"[0, 0]","***WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***For a while now, I wondered why we don't get that many nonreligious-themed Easter films--and while the idea doesn't appear to hold that much water compared to, say, The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, it is a curiosity given that we recieve a ton of nonreligious Christmas movies, but not many for Easter. But I do remember a couple from my childhood--given that they are specials rather than films. Peter Cottontail by Rankin/Bass, a Bearnstein Bears Easter special (gosh, does anybody really remember those books or the cartoon?), and It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown. I don't remember much about either one as I haven't seen them since I was 4 or 5, but I do occassionally chuckle over the Charlie Brown special whenever I look back at my previous viewings (then again, Peanuts always had a wry sense of humor).And that's where Hop comes in. Not feeling comfortable inheriting the position of Easter Bunny from his father, E.B. runs away from home (located on Easter Island, heh heh), and runs into Cyclops from the X-Men movies--without his glasses, and his condition apparently cured--an unemployed man struggling to secure a job. E.B. wants to be a drummer, and Cyclops wants to inherit the position of Easter Bunny. So the two strike a deal, and hilarity apparently ensues.The movie may sound like it's screaming ''Alvin and the Chipmunks,'' but props go to the movie for two reasons. One is that the film has a touch of genuine british humor and isn't just crass and vulgar (like, say, all the live action features loosely based on anything Hanna-Barbara had any involvement in in the past). Second is that it does sustain itself well with passable jokes throughout the 95 minute running time and doesn't simply feel like filler. Two key gags involve everyone taking in a talking bunny rather well and almost instantaneously, and another being the scene where Russell Brand in a cameo appearance is talking to E.B.--the protagonist in which he provides the voice for.No, I am not a Russel Brand fan, and his comedies--I'm mostly referring to the likes of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek here, but Bedtime Stories falls under the radar as well--are rather quite revolting to say the least. And there are plenty of moments in that film that do fall under the radar (remember, this film was directed by the same guy that gave us Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, and the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, after all). A prime example is a gag in which E.B. would continuously produce fruit-flavored jelly bean pellets, which was a joke better off left on the cutting room floor. Another--in which the antagonists were all chicks with hispanic accents--just doesn't make much sense at all (if one were to give the villains of the piece a separate accent from the English-speaking rabbits, it would have made more sense to make them French or German, anyways). Another scene shows the two lead characters ruining a gradeschool pageant in which the quality seemed to have screamed Cool As Ice (in the aforementioned movie, the music in the prom was made to be absolutely dreadful just to make Vannilla Ice look talented by comparison).I will not question E.B. unwittingly backstabbing Cyclops near the end by feining his death. He was overconfident that his friend could fend for himself, and the doubleuntandre worked as a double-edge sword (he put his vest on a turkey boiling in a pan to trick the Pink Berets into thinking that he's dead, whilst simultaneously ''dressing the turkey'' if you will). The intended gag works, but in return, it does conflict with the characters themselves AND the narrative flow in general. That, and the ending seemed anticlimatic (let's just say, the gag worked better in Pikachu's Gotta Dance!).So is it bad? Mmmm....yeah. Is it dreadful? No. Is it even watchable? Barely. If anything, the jokes do sustain themselves throughout the film, but they aren't clever enough to warrant repeat viewings. It's essentially a film with only one good trick, and not enough substance to warrant being the film's saving grace. For casual viewing, I'd give it a 4 out of 10. But if you have kids, it'd be a 1 instead; I just can't fathom the idea of allowing children to watch these sorts of films without fearing the effects they will have on their brains. And heading towards the direction of films like that, it's better for them to watch films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or the Shrek films.So by Amazon standards, that would probably make it a 3 out of 5 (though just barely).  Just don't let your kid watch this.  At least not until they are in Middle School.",3,An Easter-themed review before Valentine's Day?

But together they'll find out what they are meant to do.That's not all but if I give away more, that's the whole movie pretty much. The movie feels a little rushed and half the time Marsden doesn't seem to even be looking in the direction of the CGI bunny.

It is a tradition going back over 4,000 years (Apparently Easter has nothing to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ). The Easter bunny's son is named EB and he is the heir apparent to become the next Easter bunny.  Unfortunately EB wants to be a drummer rock star and he has no interest in being the Easter bunny.This brings in Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) who is a loser son in a family of motivated people.  Fred can't even hold a job, or find one, while his family thrives on being somewhat successful.  EB and Fred cross paths and the fun begins as EB tries to fulfill his dream of being a drummer and Fred discovers that he wants to be the Easter bunny.This movie features marvelous animation and it really is spectacular. The computer generated graphics and color are just perfect.  The views of the candy production area under Easter Island are well done and the jelly bean waterfalls are like a natural beauty.  Unfortunately the acting is simply over the top and overdone to the point of being fake. Fred O'Hare's (James Marsden) role is simply the village idiot and the acting role is so unrealistic is really was not even fun for me to watch.My grandson loved the movie but my wife and I felt it was only average.  It is sad too that this movie has such great computer animation and the combination of the animation into the real world video is perfectly done. The acting is below average for the main character and the storyline for the humans is so very weak that it actually detracts from the movies value.Call me old fashion, but was it really worth saying that Easter has been celebrated for over 4,000 years which leads one to assume that it is in no way related with the resurrection of Jesus?

The Easter Factory is awesome.  The bunnies are adorable, and the ""Pink Berets"" were one of a number of great ideas.But the bottom line is that after the movie while we were walking out of the theater I asked my two boys -- age 10 and 8 -- to rate it on a scale of 1 for the worst and 10 for the best, and they each gave it a 5.In fact, the 8 year old just walked up to my computer screen and thought I was buying the movie.  I asked him if he's ever want to see it again, and he said ""no"".  The real irony here is that buying the movie would have cost about half of what it costs to get an adult and two kids to see a movie in the theater these days where I live.So you've got great visuals, cutting-edgs CGI cuteness everywhere, and some fun ideas, but you've allow got shallow characters and a very contrived story whose writers could not conceive a way for the Easter Bunny to visit all the children of the world without copying Santa Clause, even though the bunnies have a globe spanning ultra high-speed tunnel network that can get them anywhere on Earth in seconds.Oh, and this is one of those movies where they give away the ending at the beginning and then use the movie to show you ""how it all went down"".

Unfortunately, his interest lies less in his chocolate and sweet confectionary heritage, and more with two-stick bangers likeNeil PeartandStewart Copeland. His dreams involve pounding music, pounding beats, and pounding bunny babes, not delivering goodies to the children of the world.So what's a bunny to do?

I'll just start of saying that this film is just purely commercial. It seems like it was just made for the extra holiday buck, as some people put it: an ""Easter special that the whole family will enjoy"". Your family MAY enjoy it, but it may not be the best thing.I can name SEVERAL problems with this film, but the one that really brings down this movie is that it seems like the producers were trying to make this film appealing to all ages, which really isn't a bad thing; but the way that it's done is very, very poor. Them trying to do this, it seems, just turns out to be a big jumble-up of cute bunnies and chicks (the chicken kind, mind you) alongside adult-ish jokes and other stuff. There are some overly cute and childish stuff that will probably bore adults and seem a little child-ly awkward to Teens and Pre-Teens. And there are some pretty ""grown up"" content, like jokes, situations and such that may not be the best thing for younger children (if they can even understand them). Like, there's one ""joke"" were the main (rabbit) character, Eve, is attracted by the gate to the Playboy mansion (because it has a shadow plaque of a rabbit on it) and try's to get in by talking to none other than Hugh Heffner (via an intercom), telling that he's ""incredibly sexy"" and other related stuff......Um, hello? This is supposed to be a CHILD-ORIENTED FILM (or is it?)!!!!!! Were are we getting these remarks about being ""really sexy"" in a movie with fluffy bunnies, adorable chicks and boughs of colorful candy!? Other mature (if that's the right word) content like this pops up several times throughout this movie. Really makes you wonder if this is the right thing to show your kids. But as I said before, isn't this supposed to be a FAMILY movie? It just seems like we go from a colorful world of rabbits and candy and other stuff to outbursts of ""of my g--"" (which was really said several times at one point in the movie) and creatures almost being cleaved in two with machine knives (which also happens in this film). It just likes the makers of this film were just trying to rake up those extra holiday dollars with a mixed-up film that has stuff to childish for grown-ups and content too grown-up for children, but of coarse people will want to watch. I mean, [and I quote Meredith Whitmore and Adam R. Holz]""...what family wouldn't want to go see a silly bunny with an English accent  hop around Hollywood?""[unquote]....basically, this is just one of those films that had the producer's heart put into it: it one of those films that was just made for the pursuit of money. I know that there are allot of people out there who will disagree with me, saying that ""it's the perfect family film"" and stuff like that. It may be a film for the family to watch, but that doesn't mean that it's a film for the family. This film is just pretty much just a big mix-up of Holiday-and-Hollywood cheese, made just for the sake of money. In my mind, it's nothing more.P.S: Please don't mark this review as ""unhelpful"" because you disagree with anything I've said.

1386512,AMFUEP4B91OE1,B00466HN6S,Masha,"[5, 7]","(Written by the teenager in residence)Upon first hearing of Hop, I had high hopes for it. Although the premise - holiday figure gets injured in accident, everyman has to replace him - has been done before, one detail caught my eye - ""From the people who brought you Despicable Me"". Despicable Me is one of my favorite modern-day animated films, with interesting (and entertaining) characters, solid plotting, and a good dose of heart. Naturally, I expected this movie to be on the same level, or at least have some solid execution. It delivered in the entertainment value, but it left a lot to be desired.Story: 7/10 - As mentioned, the premise combines several cliches - kid has legacy, kid wants to be something else, kid runs away from home, is in danger of having his birthright or whatever stolen by some other guy if he doesn't make it back home before a certain date. It also has the standard everyman who can't hold a job, but has his life changed when he accidentally injures, maims, or even kills a holiday figure (in this case it's the former) and eventually finds his place in the world. It's been done a million times, and the fact that said holiday figure is a talking CGI animal and the humans are all in live-action draws parallels to Alvin and the Chipmunks.Depth: 4/10 - Now, a cliched premise is not a bad thing, and some works have managed to excel despite (or because of) their uses of cliches (like BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger), although mileage varies. A bungled execution, however, is certainly not good. The interactions between the human protagonist(Fred o'Hare) and the rabbit (E.B.) don't have much of an emotional impact - it's same old, same old. There are some interesting plot points that never get explored further - E.B. wants to be a drummer, rather than the Easter Bunny, but we're never really given a clear reason why (except for ""touring the world"", but his father (the incumbent Easter Bunny) points out that easter bunnies go all over the world, too). The Pink Berets, sent to bring E.B. back home, aren't developed, don't have a single line of dialogue, and are generally incompetent (they mistake a Butterball for a bunny by the end). And the fact that the easter bunnies live on Easter Island could have been used for some interesting, if far-fetched, plot points - maybe the Moai are actually sentient guardians of the factory where the Easter Bunnies make their candy? But no - all of these plots are wasted.Characters: 5/10 - Most of these characters are underdeveloped and underused throughout the movie. For example, Fred fits squarely into the archetype of ""beleagured slacker with a good heart"", and doesn't show much depth except for his desire to be the Easter Bunny. To his credit, he does show that he's willing to work for his goals, but that's really it. The main villain, Carlos, is an obvious bad guy with cliched motives, but he is the most sympathetic character - considering how big of a jerk the Easter Bunny is when Carlos tries to show that he can be competent, it's easy to understand why he's so ticked off. The sad thing, though, is that we never see that Carlos could be a good easter bunny - indeed, when he takes over, he almost ruins the holiday experience for non-birds. All of the human characters except for Fred and David Hasselhoff (don't ask) are underutilized as well - his older sister, Sam, is used to give him a job interview that E.B. fumbles for him and a lecture on responsibility, but doesn't really do anything else. His younger sister, Alex, acts like a jerk and hassles Fred during a family dinner, but ends up upstaged and humiliated by a ""ventriloquism"" act that comes across as disproportionate karma. The whole scene doesn't have that much of an impact on the main plot, either, except for straining Fred's realtionship with his family even further. And don't get me started on the Pink Berets - seriously, don't.Entertainment: 8/10 - Despite these glaring flaws, Hop proves to be entertaining on the first go-through regardless. It's only when examined with a keen eye that the fridge logic sets in. The jokes are relatively funny, the animation is fluid and avoids uncanny valley, and the soundtrack is decent, although not magnificent. The MST3K mantra - ""It's only a movie, I should really relax"" - applies in full here, but it still manages to be a nice diversion overall.Overall: 24/40 - Like I said, there are many flaws and cliches used in this movie. There are a lot of wasted plots and potential characterization gone down the drain, but it still manages to be a nice experience on the first go-through. My recommendation would be to see it once, laugh a lot, and don't think too much about it. For the kiddies, take them to see ""Rango"" - a vastly superior animated experience - or watch ""Despicable Me"" again before you go see this.

1386520,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00466HN6S,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Honestly, there are so many great things about it! It's a fine film for any age, with plenty of humor that is genuinely funny for adults as well as kids, and the adult humor is not inappropriate for the younger set. The animation is fantastic and fully believable in the real-world, the pacing is some of the best I've seen, and the human characters are beautifully cast and all excellently played as well. There is no forced romance with an unnecessary love interest, because they do the right thing (for once) and don't have an unnecessary love interest! Yes, this movie is totally safe for the lovelorn or those who just don't like seeing unnecessary romances in movies that aren't about that! What IS it about? It's an Easter movie! Yes, an actual Easter movie that isn't religious. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the religious Easter movies too, even if I'm not so religious anymore, but it's nice to have something to watch on Easter (feature-length, I mean) that gives us a break from the religious stuff and still is about the holiday. If you have kids, this movie should be a real Easter treat for them, but I don't have kids and still LOVE it. It's just so much fun, I can really relate to the lead human character (A LOT), and the Pink Berets, they are just too adorable! I want to hug them to death (well, maybe not to death), especially the little one, Bit! I had to get the figurines of all three of them!But, I'm getting ahead of myself here, let me give a little on the plot. ""Hop"" is a film about E.B. (Russell Brand), the son of the current Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie), who would rather drum in a band than follow in his father's paw-prints. It's also about Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a directionless young man who is being pushed by his family to find a job and get his own place, but who just can't stand to settle into a life that isn't amazing. Lucky for both Fred and E.B. that their paths cross when E.B. runs away from their Wonka-esque candy factory on Easter Island to pursue his dream in Hollywood! Unfortunately for E.B., his father sends his elite royal guards, the Pink Berets (three cuter than cute girl bunnies) to retrieve him, and even worse, the Easter Bunny's number one chick, Carlos, decides now is the perfect time to stage a takeover and become the new Easter... Chick!There's also one other huge aspect of the plot that I normally wouldn't give away, because it would normally be a huge spoiler. The big, surprise ending. However, if this film has any flaws, it's that this potential surprise ending is revealed at the beginning of the film, literally in the opening! Yeah, just like in the original Salem's Lot. I can't for the life of me understand why some films do this. So, it's no spoiler to say that in the end of the film, Fred becomes the new (and first human) Easter Bunny. Honestly, even when he comes up with the idea and E.B. starts training him in the hopes that they can switch places, so to speak, it still seems unlikely that things will turn out with Fred as the new Easter Bunny, but they don't get to surprise us with that great turnout because they revealed it in the opening credits narration. Oh well. So, yeah, this film isn't perfect, but that one, pretty silly move on the filmmakers' part is the only glaring mistake. Having said that, I do love the idea of how things worked out for Fred since it was done in a way to even satisfy those of us who were a little concerned about not having a rabbit in that sacred position.Now, some might say they should have at least given one nod to the religious aspects of Easter, and I'll agree that some sort of allusion could have done just a bit more to make this a perfect Easter film that doesn't miss a beat, but I can live with it being wholly secular since almost every other feature film related to Easter is wholly religious. Something that bothered me a little bit more (and, again, not much, and even less upon repeat viewings) were little Christmas similarities. Most significantly, the fact that the Easter Bunny drives a flying sleigh in this film (it looks very Easter-ish and is pulled by a flock of chicks, but still...). If they hadn't made a joke by calling out the chicks' names, Santa-style, at the end of the film, it wouldn't have bugged me so much. It just would have been nice to avoid any Christmas references in this Easter film (I love Christmas, but do the other holidays always have to bow down to it? I also get bugged when the other monsters are made to bow down to Dracula), but nevertheless, it is a fantastic film! Gotta watch this one once a year at the very least! Definitely a new favorite of mine!The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack gives perfect picture and sound, and a handful of extras. The most boasted of is an all-new Mini-Movie. Now, I highly recommend picking this up, because the movie is so fantastic and also because there aren't many movies out there for Easter anyway, even when you include holiday specials (my picks in that area being Charlie Brown and Rankin/Bass's original Here Comes Peter Cottontail). But, don't be swayed over the Mini Movie. That was lame. I mean, it was not like one of those bonus cartoons PIXAR adds to its releases. This was basically just Carlos and Phil, the two chicks from the film (and, all through this review, when I say chicks, I mean baby chickens, though these chicks are adults that permanently look like chicks), dancing on a while background. Seriously. It was like an animation test, really, not a mini movie. I was hoping it might be a new Pink Berets adventure, but no such luck. It was no kind of adventure at all, and Hank Azaria didn't even provide the voices this time. I could tell right away that Carlos was played by Jim Cummings in this short and elsewhere on the disc. The other bonus features were a mixed bag too. There is a collection of behind the scenes interviews that should have just been presented as one featurettes, preferably with more material, but it was a nice inclusion anyway. I don't care much for DVD games, but they do have a trio of decent ones for the kiddies here. There are also some special Blu-Ray enhancement gimmicks of the kind I usually don't bother with (BDLive and all that sort of thing). Too bad movies like this rarely get commentary tracks, and I didn't see the theatrical trailer or anything of that nature on the disc. So, yeah, the bonus features aren't much, but the movie is a must own if you have any love for Easter at all.",5,I LOVE This Movie!,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,6492,"['Honestly', 'are', 'so',

1386553,A1GOJSM3XB62VB,B00466HN6S,Thomas G. Farrar,"[0, 0]","As mentioned in other reviews, this is a combo animated/live-action film about Easter.  EB, the ""heir"" to the Easter Bunny throne, runs away from home to follow his dreams of playing drums professionally.  He ultimately ends up with Fred O'Hare (played by James Marsden), who is a dreamer who doesn't fit into any job and is being forced to find work by his family.  Mayhem ensues, with EB defecating jelly beans and basically making life havoc for Fred.  After misadventures at a video game company and a run-in with a famous talent-searcher, Fred and EB end up saving Easter from the diabolical chick assistant Carlos (and finding their own dreams and friendship after all).First of all, the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The scenes of the Easter Factory are beautiful -- some of the most wonderfully animated settings I have seen.  The studio does a great job of fitting EB and other characters into the real world, down to shots normally missed such as shadows and reflections.The voice and live acting are pretty good, with Russell Brand performing as EB. James Marsden interacts well with the animated characters as well.On the downside, for most of the film it is almost impossible to find interest or care for the characters.  EB is a spoiled child who does everything he wants to wreck other lives, and Fred is a dreamer who tries to deal with the wreckage.  It's kind of unfortunate that you can't find empathy for either child, both of whom are trying to please their fathers but failing.  Finally by the last 15 minutes of the movie you find that EB and Fred can compromise, work together, and reach their dreams while reconciling with their families.  But if you can't make it through the first 3/4's (most of which involves making humorous messes and some potty humor) of the movie to that point, you probably won't really care about the ending.",3,Cotton Candy: Sweet but ultimately not very satisfying,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1859,"['mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'combo', 'animated/live-action', 'film', 'Easter', 'EB', 'heir', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'throne', 'away', 'home', 'follow', 'dreams', 'playing', 'drums', 'professionally', 'ultimately', 'up', 'Fred', ""O'Hare"", 'played', 'James', 'Marsden', 'who', 'dreamer', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'job', 'being', 'forced', 'find', 'work', 'family', 'Mayhem', 'ensues', 'EB', 'defecating', 'jelly', 'beans', 'basically', 'making', 'life', 'havoc', 'Fred', 'misadventures', 'video', 'game', 'company', 'run-in', 'famous', 'talent-searcher', 'Fred', 'EB', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'Easter', 'diabolical', 'chick', 'assistant', 'Carlos', 'finding', 'own', 'dreams', 'friendship', '.First', 'film', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'Easter', 'Factory', 'are', 'beautiful', 'most', 'wonderfully', 'animated', 'settings', 'have', 'seen', 'studio', 'great', 'job', 'fitting', 'EB', 'other', 'characters', 'real', 'world', 'down', 'shots', 'normally', 'missed', 'such', 'shadows', 'reflections.The', 'voice', 'live', 'acting', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'performing', 'EB', 'James', 'Marsden', 'well', 'animated', 'characters', 'well.On', 'downside', 'most', 'film', 'almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'interest', 'care', 'characters', 'EB', 'spoiled', 'child', 'who', 'everything', 'wreck', 'other', 'lives', 'Fred', 'dreamer', 'who', 'deal', 'wreckage', 'kind', 'unfortunate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'empathy', 'child', 'whom', 'are', 'trying', 'please', 'fathers', 'failing', 'Finally', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'find', 'EB', 'Fred', 'can', 'compromise', 'work', 'together', 'reach', 'dreams', 'reconciling', 'families', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', '3/4', 'most', 'making', 'humorous', 'messes', 'potty', 'humor', 'movie', 'point', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'ending']",N/A

Both pictures are harmless and mindless fun (helmed by the same director Tim Hill, incidentally), kind of movie that would achieve 100 million dollars mark in ticket sales while ridiculed by critics. Actually, ""Hop"" is not that bad, thanks to the state-of-the-art special effects, though you really have to ignore the incredible storyline.A young rabbit E.B. wants to be a drummer, but his daddy Mr. Bunny - who happens to be the Easter Bunny - would not listen. So, to make his dream come true, E.B. runs away from his home on Easter Island, and travels to Hollywood, where he encounters Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a slacker who discovers his true calling when he discovers the identity of the speaking rabbit. Well, I think you know what it is.Obviously there are so many wrong things about the film. The story is far from coherent. James Marsden (born in 1973) is too old for the role. The film also feels like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu at times. Mr. Bunny's factory, though beautifully designed, reminds us of a recent Tim Burton film, or the idea of hundreds of working chickens seems to have come from ""Despicable Me"" and its yellow-colored minions. Cameos of Blind Boys of Alabama, David Hasselhoff and Hugh Hefner (voice only) are amusing, but may look pointless considering the film' main target audience.For all these, however, I enjoyed watching the film with its great effects, colorful designs and some funny jokes.
