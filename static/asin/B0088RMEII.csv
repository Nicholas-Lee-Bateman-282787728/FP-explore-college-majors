It goes on advanced level to show you GOD is not joking . WHAT you see in movie can happen to anyone if they hold grudge or don't forgive anyone . If they don't clean up their action meaning past is their own past. DON""T expect for family or husband/wife to help cleaning up the mess. I learned that in my christainly formus and they said you can't have mate unless you clean up your own action. I thought it was mean at first. But I read bible it was true, GOD wouldn't want give person HIS own chosen mate if that person life is a mess. It is like loved ones /friend calling asking you if they can come to your messy house and you say no in ashamed. You don't allow no one come over until it is clean and fresh. It is same with her in movie, she has to clean the past forgives dad and everything. Daughter starts coming home.But before that she thought she knew God, she didn't clean past and she only changes her name . Then ran away. One day her daughter is kinaped . It goes to show GOD is not playing.I really do thank that movie is made. It explain why movie is too real , it is made by pastor TD JAKES. He is one of my favorite for movie and pastor both.

Nothing wrong with my TV, the production staff used poor microphones, did not position the microphone properly and did no sound quality check before shooting to ensure that if the actors lowered their voice or tone, the audio is captured at an acceptable level. Very unprofessional work.The picture quality was poor, not sure if they used a home camera to shoot. The story was all over the place, jumping from one unrelated scene to another. Quite dis-jointed, shows you the kind of C rated director that was in charge. The acting if you call it that was actually closer to a D rating than a C, and they was a bit of ""over-acting"".The movie is PG-13, so if some people pick it up because of the association with TD Jakes, it is not a family movie with a couple or scenes that are quite non-family.

She does well as a real estate agent. But none of these things has helped her to stop dwelling on her past mistakes. Kari has secrets.Movies about abducted children and serial killers aren't easy to watch, but this is a T.D. Jakes film and Blair Underwood (David), Sharon Leal (Kari) and Nicole Beharie (Beth) are in it - I wanted to see it. It turned out to be a good mystery/ suspense/thriller with a twist ending that made me talk to the screen just a bit.The thoughts that came to mind as I watched:1. Keep the windows locked and get an alarm system.2. Les gets on my nerves.3. Be sure you know who you're chatting with online.4. David, you are really disappointing me right now.5. Christians will attend church services. We'll say we love our heavenly Father. We'll say we know He is always there to help us in our times of need. But when trouble comes, instead of calling on Him and trusting Him to work things out, some get angry at Him. Some can have all the faith in the world when things are good, but when things get bad faith wavers or faith is completely lost. Some feel like God is no longer with them, so they get discouraged. It's good to keep in mind that Christianity `is not about feelings'. God says He will never leave nor forsake us (Hebrews 13:5-6), so He will never leave nor forsake us.6. Love. People claim to know what it means, but when that love is tested, the truth is some have no clue.7. No matter how much a person tries to be better, some just have to keep bringing up the person's past mistakes. That's sad.8. Who's that playing the FBI Agent? I need to find out what other movies he was in.My favorite lines:1. You just can't keep stuffin' down life.2. God, where are You?3. When you begin to forgive and build your faith, nothing's impossible.And my favorite scene was the conversation between Kari and Will in the kitchen.
