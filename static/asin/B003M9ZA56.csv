Boris was great... I love David Banner but he could have done better too. The movie put you in the mind of a bootlegged movie. The plot sucked.

He was great! I noticed both Boris and Kenya acting has gotten better. I wish William L Johnson aka Brotha Bill had a much bigger role he is an very good actor and fine as hell.I give this movie 5stars and I will add it to my black movie collection.",5,very good movie,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,489,"['saw', 'movie', 'twice', 'weekend', 'channel', 'tv-one', 'was', 'very', 'good.It', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Kenya', 'Moore', 'Boris', 'Kojoe', 'handsome', 'David', 'Banner', 'who', 'should', 'definately', 'pursue', 'career', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'noticed', 'Boris', 'Kenya', 'acting', 'gotten', 'better', 'wish', 'William', 'L', 'Johnson', 'aka', 'Brotha', 'Bill', 'had', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'fine', 'hell.I', 'give', 'movie', '5stars', 'will', 'add', 'black', 'movie', 'collection']",Confidant
1354233,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003M9ZA56,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[7, 8]","Boris Kodjoe plays Nigel Patterson, a former FB star. During a flashback we discovered Nigel is a hood who cheats at cards, throws games, and then he killed a man. His friend Danny Jackson takes the fall for Nigel on the promise he would take care of him when he got out. Well now Jackson is out and Nigel does not come close to meeting Danny's expectations. Danny eyes Nigel's wife Eden (Kenya Moore) and as our sympathy builds for Nigel, only then he destroys it by showing us he is a thug also. The movie escalates until it becomes stupid.The movie is low budget. It uses the same song for the soundtrack over and over again. The acting needed help as did the dialouge. If the merchandise is not stolen, you don't need to fence it to the Russian mafia. The overall idea for the script was sound, it was poorly executed on many levels.F-bomb, sex, nudity.",2,BAD PRODUCTION,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,857,"['Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'Nigel', 'Patterson', 'former', 'FB', 'star', 'flashback', 'discovered', 'Nigel', 'hood', 'who', 'cards', 'games', 'then', 'killed', 'man', 'friend', 'Danny', 'Jackson', 'fall', 'Nigel', 'promise', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'when', 'got', 'out', 'Well', 'now', 'Jackson', 'out', 'Nigel', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'meeting', 'Danny', 'expectations', 'Danny', 'eyes', 'Nigel', 'wife', 'Eden', 'Kenya', 'Moore', 'sympathy', 'builds', 'Nigel', 'only', 'then', 'showing', 'thug', 'also', 'movie', 'stupid.The', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'same', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'over', 'again', 'acting', 'needed', 'help', 'did', 'dialouge', 'merchandise', 'not', 'stolen', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'fence', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'overall', 'idea', 'script', 'was', 'sound', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'many', 'levels.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity']",Confidant
