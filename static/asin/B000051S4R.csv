In this film you do.In good drama the audience isn't quite sure what will happen and sits on the edge of their seats until the end.  This film also passes that test.In good religious films I like to see a message that is not too heavy handed, but appeals to reason with at least a touch of dimension.  This film does that.  Others might argue with me, but I think it carries a conservative Christian message in a thoughful way.In good sci-fi the author creates a coherent world.  The authors do that with this film.In the best sci-fi the world created is not exactly believable, but plausible enough to make the audience wonder if it could happen.  This film comes close to that point.This film also delivers the added bonus of using Larry Norman's song, ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready"" to create a nostalgic link with the old ""Thief in the Night"" series that frightened hundreds of people into religious faith back in the 70's.This film is a good ""sleeper"", much better than I expected.  I am glad I watched it and recommend it to anyone.THE CONS OF THIS FILM:Losely based on the biblical book of Revelation the story might be a little hard to follow for viewers who are not immersed in conservative Christian escatology.  The film shows video clips from popular ""end time"" preachers that might not be recognizable to those outside of the host culture.The photography is a little dark.It is a little claustrophobic, which works better on the small screen than on the big screen.Unfortunately its Christian background could cause it to be prejudged by many, thus potentially limiting the size of its audience.",5,Good Sci-Fi Worth the Price,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1795,"['PROS', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'Once', 'relegated', 'class', 'grade', 'B', 'movies', 'preached', 'predictible', 'sermons', 'Christian', 'films', 'are', 'growing', 'good', 'film', 'audience', 'characters', 'film', 'do.In', 'good', 'drama', 'audience', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'sits', 'edge', 'seats', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'test.In', 'good', 'religious', 'films', 'like', 'see', 'message', 'not', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'appeals', 'reason', 'least', 'touch', 'dimension', 'film', 'Others', 'might', 'argue', 'think', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'message', 'thoughful', 'way.In', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'author', 'coherent', 'world', 'authors', 'do', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'world', 'created', 'not', 'exactly', 'believable', 'plausible', 'enough', 'make', 'audience', 'wonder', 'could', 'happen', 'film', 'close', 'point.This', 'film', 'also', 'added', 'bonus', 'using', 'Larry', 'Norman', 'song', 'Wish', ""'d"", 'Been', 'Ready', 'create', 'nostalgic', 'link', 'old', 'Thief', 'Night', 'series', 'frightened', 'hundreds', 'people', 'religious', 'faith', 'back', ""70's.This"", 'film', 'good', 'sleeper', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'recommend', 'anyone.THE', 'CONS', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'Losely', 'based', 'biblical', 'book', 'Revelation', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'immersed', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'escatology', 'film', 'video', 'clips', 'popular', 'end', 'time', 'preachers', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'recognizable', 'host', 'culture.The', 'photography', 'little', 'dark.It', 'little', 'claustrophobic', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'screen.Unfortunately', 'Christian', 'background', 'could', 'cause', 'be', 'prejudged', 'many', 'thus', 'potentially', 'limiting', 'size', 'audience']",Revelation VHS
563502,AAXUNK0W2DZG5,B000051S4R,"Amazon Customer ""leneker""","[15, 17]","The final book of the Christian New Testament is called the ""Book of Revelation"". It relates prophecies, which deal with the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Worthy true believers will be taken en mass in to heaven during a period called ""The Rapture"" after this time confusion and turmoil reigns for those left on Earth.  There will be false gods with false promises of peace and salvation.  Many people will be beguiled by Satan and lose their souls while others will discover the true God and suffer for their new found faith.""Revelation"" continues in the tradition of the popular ""Left Behind"" series.  It is a science fiction/adventure movie that takes place in modern times showing how those prophecies could come to life.  The world has been thrown into chaos by the sudden disappearance of millions of people. For some this is a mysterious event for others it is the realization that the Christian way of life is the correct path to salvation.  However, most people have been seduced by an evil dictator who has set himself up as a messiah brining peace to the world.  Some people are in between; too cynical to believe totally in God or in the new leader.Thorld Stone is one of the latter group. He desperately misses his wife and daughter, but he is not ready to embrace the new regime or the old religion.  At times he is considered an enemy by both groups. Eventually Stone goes on the run and, along with some other agnostics, ends up hiding out with a group of Christians who are attempting to crack the Dictator's latest scheme for total control of the world.  When those plans are discovered each person will face a choice that decides the fate of their soul and the world's existence.This is a great idea for a movie, but I think that it comes off somewhat flat.  The acting was a little too glib at points and a little too hammy and melodramatic at others.  However the characters are painted so black and so white that it often seemed absurd that people could be so easily swayed. I thought that the best acting came from the charming relationship between Cindy and Willi.  They had a refreshing and tender series of exchanges showing how life goes in even in troubled times.  They were the only characters that I felt for and it made their tragedy even sadder than was written.I thought that the script did a nice job of providing background for people unfamiliar with the book in the Bible.  While this movie would not intimidate people who are not up on the Bible, at this level of quality, I am not sure how much interest they would have in it either.",3,continues in the tradition of the popular &#65533;Left Behind&#65533; film,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,2598,"['final', 'book', 'Christian', 'New', 'Testament', 'called', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'prophecies', 'deal', 'end', 'world', 'second', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Worthy', 'true', 'believers', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'en', 'mass', 'heaven', 'period', 'called', 'Rapture', 'time', 'confusion', 'turmoil', 'reigns', 'left', 'Earth', 'will', 'be', 'false', 'gods', 'false', 'promises', 'peace', 'salvation', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'beguiled', 'Satan', 'lose', 'souls', 'others', 'will', 'discover', 'true', 'God', 'suffer', 'new', 'found', 'faith', 'Revelation', 'tradition', 'popular', 'Left', 'Behind', 'series', 'science', 'fiction/adventure', 'movie', 'place', 'modern', 'times', 'showing', 'how', 'prophecies', 'could', 'come', 'life', 'world', 'been', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'millions', 'people', 'mysterious', 'event', 'others', 'realization', 'Christian', 'way', 'life', 'correct', 'path', 'salvation', 'However', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'seduced', 'evil', 'dictator', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'messiah', 'brining', 'peace', 'world', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'cynical', 'believe', 'totally', 'God', 'new', 'leader.Thorld', 'Stone', 'one', 'latter', 'group', 'desperately', 'wife', 'daughter', 'not', 'ready', 'embrace', 'new', 'regime', 'old', 'religion', 'times', 'considered', 'enemy', 'groups', 'Eventually', 'Stone', 'run', 'other', 'agnostics', 'up', 'hiding', 'out', 'group', 'Christians', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'crack', 'Dictator', 'latest', 'scheme', 'total', 'control', 'world', 'When', 'plans', 'are', 'discovered', 'person', 'will', 'face', 'choice', 'fate', 'soul', 'world', 'existence.This', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'think', 'off', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'glib', 'points', 'little', 'too', 'hammy', 'melodramatic', 'others', 'However', 'characters', 'are', 'painted', 'so', 'black', 'so', 'white', 'often', 'seemed', 'absurd', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'easily', 'swayed', 'thought', 'best', 'acting', 'came', 'charming', 'relationship', 'Cindy', 'Willi', 'had', 'refreshing', 'tender', 'series', 'exchanges', 'showing', 'how', 'life', 'even', 'troubled', 'times', 'were', 'only', 'characters', 'felt', 'made', 'tragedy', 'even', 'sadder', 'was', 'written.I', 'thought', 'script', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'providing', 'background', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'Bible', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'intimidate', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'up', 'Bible', 'level', 'quality', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'interest', 'would', 'have']",Revelation VHS

I'd say Revelation is probably better than Left Behind, but not as good as A Thief in the Night. I really think that if Cloud Ten Pictures wants to finish the Left Behind series, they should stick with it, but I really like this one along with Left Behind. It starts out a little slow in the beginning, but picks up right away about 1/3 of the way there. You'll enjoy it thoroughly, Christian, or non-Christian.Thorold Stone (Jeff Fahey) is still wallowing in self-pity and denial after the sudden disappearance of his wife, daughter, and people all over the globe one seemingly normal afternoon. It is now three months after the occurance, and the world is in total chaos. The people still on the world trust in the new government organization called O.N.E. (one nation earth) but there is something strange with the leader, President Franco Macallusso, and his sadist henchman, Len Parker. An event called the Day of Wonders that people say will change the world has got people spellbound. With a simple virtual reality helmet, people can go anywhere, and do anything in their own homes, but Macallusso is planning to do more with this device, much more, and Thorold and a band of newfound christians, including newscaster Helen Hannah (Leigh Lewis from the first Apocalypse) are bound to find out.I was so happy to see they carried the character of Helen Hannah into the next film in the series. Out of all the end times series, she's the one who is so impeccable in her characters actions, and Leigh Lewis's acting, I'm glad to know that there are two more in the series after this continuing with her. And of course there are new characters that are also very good actors and actresses.This movie will surprise you considering the people you never though would turn to the antichrist do! If I was ever caught in the rapture (which I'm not) I would never take the mark of the beast even if they did try to cut my head off with the guillotine. Sure, it would be morbid, and spine chilling, but would you rather burn in hell or live forever with God in heaven?I thought the movie itself was great for such an underrated film.

Most of the time the Hollywood studio producing the film, along with the screenwriter and director, have very little knowledge regarding the end of time as recorded in the Book of Revelation.  There have been some attempts made to adapt this subject that haven't been altogether horrible, such as, ""The Omega Code"" and ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"".  Due to an unfulfilled need for an actual Christian approach to the subject matter, Paul and Peter Lalonde formed a production company known as Cloud Ten Pictures.  Cloud Ten Pictures in the beginning set out to produce Hollywood caliber movies that were Christian in nature, and apparently focused on the Book of Revelation.  However, desiring to produce movies on a level with Hollywood and succeeding in doing so are two totally different things.  The first attempt made by Cloud Ten Pictures was the pathetic and boring, not to mention stupid, ""Apocalypse"".  This movie was absolutely horrible as I stated in the review for that movie, but it apparently whet some Christian moviegoers' thirst enough to want to see more, so Cloud Ten Pictures obliged by making it into their first franchise.""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" follows an atheist (Jeff Fahey) who witnessed the rapture of all the Christians, without it really phasing him by the way, and just continues with his life.  That is until he comes into contact with some post-rapture Christians who are being hunted by the forces of the Antichrist.  When the atheist sees that Christians are being forced to either bow to the Antichrist or lose their head (literally), he chooses to help the Christian `rebels' as they were.  In the process he begins to understand God, but will he come to know God before it's too late.It appears that Cloud Ten Pictures realized how terrible their first film ""Apocalypse"" was that they chose to essentially remake it with the sequel.  ""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" is much better than ""Apocalypse"" in every aspect of filmmaking.  The script is better (still corny and wooden), there are better actors (though it appears Jeff Fahey and Carol Alt are on the downswing of their careers otherwise why do this film), and better directing.  However, all of these improvements still do not make for an entertaining movie that could hold a candle to even one of the Direct-to-DVD B-movies that Hollywood produces.As I said it's an improvement, so at least Cloud Ten is trying to head in the right direction, but for a sequel in a franchise, this movie doesn't propel the overall story any further than the first film did.  Now I understand that this was pretty much a remake of the original film in the franchise, but I would have expected the story to go a little bit farther into the 7-10 year long Tribulation, instead of stopping where ""Apocalypse"" did.I don't really recommend this movie, unless you happen to like ""Apocalypse"" or are at least wanting to see if they improved at all with the sequel, otherwise this franchise is a slap in the face to moviegoers both Christian and non-Christian and really should be avoided.  By avoiding this series, maybe the producers will realize that they should put more time and effort into making better movies and not just trying to flood the starved Christian movie market.""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"" is rated PG-13 for violence.",2,Why God?

That having been said, I'm expecting some backlash due to some of my other reviews, but honestly, after all the fanaticism I've dealt with over the years, I don't care! I'll start with the acting-which overall, was fairly decent. Jeff Fahey was very good as a husband and father left behind after the rapture, but his reasons for not having faith aren't without merit, I've been through stages like that myself. Nick Mancuso, who I knew best from Under Siege, does an excellent job as the anti-christ, considering he's a Christian himself. His minion played by unknown actor David Roddis, is a little too creepy and merciless for my taste-beating someone to a pulp due to refusing to renounce their faith, not to mention saying ""God's Lost!)

563532,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B000051S4R,T. Briggs,"[2, 2]","Considering the bible tells us not to anticipate the judgement day as ""even the angels don't know"" it never ceases to amaze me how the spiritually phony will get all excited and worked up over end-of-days-plotlines.  Considering that folks who actually study the bible understand that revelations was written describing not our world today or in the future but the Roman Empire and the anti-christ who was Nero.  This is not a matter of debate.  Still, those who want to profit off this kind of vengeful-spiritual-porn are very successful businessmen if not entirely successful at their ""christian"" practices.  They are successful at writing popular misconceptions of revelations and apocalyptic themes which are fun but one must ask if you believe these films have value for ""opening"" the eyes of non believers it seems a bit like false advertising and not necessarily the proper way to bring sincere people into the fold.  Living in Jesus' way is much more simple than going to church and helping a pastor build his summer home.  Today's christians are actually not so into the reality of Jesus' message as they are into finding those passages which support their own personal narrative regardless of whether that narrative is actually christian.  So a fun movie maybe, but something useful for spiritual development?  Not so much.",1,Christian Porn,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1333,"['Considering', 'bible', 'tells', 'not', 'anticipate', 'judgement', 'day', 'even', 'angels', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'spiritually', 'phony', 'will', 'get', 'excited', 'worked', 'up', 'end-of-days-plotlines', 'Considering', 'folks', 'who', 'actually', 'study', 'bible', 'understand', 'revelations', 'was', 'written', 'describing', 'not', 'world', 'today', 'future', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'anti-christ', 'who', 'was', 'Nero', 'not', 'matter', 'debate', 'Still', 'who', 'want', 'profit', 'off', 'kind', 'vengeful-spiritual-porn', 'are', 'very', 'successful', 'businessmen', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'christian', 'practices', 'are', 'successful', 'writing', 'popular', 'misconceptions', 'revelations', 'apocalyptic', 'themes', 'are', 'fun', 'one', 'must', 'ask', 'believe', 'films', 'have', 'value', 'opening', 'eyes', 'non', 'believers', 'bit', 'false', 'advertising', 'not', 'necessarily', 'proper', 'way', 'bring', 'sincere', 'people', 'fold', 'Living', 'Jesus', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'going', 'church', 'helping', 'pastor', 'build', 'summer', 'home', 'Today', 'christians', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'so', 'reality', 'Jesus', 'message', 'are', 'finding', 'passages', 'support', 'own', 'personal', 'narrative', 'regardless', 'narrative', 'actually', 'christian', 'fun', 'movie', 'maybe', 'something', 'useful', 'spiritual', 'development', 'Not', 'so', 'much']",Revelation VHS

These characters are more realistic.  There is still time for some romantic flirtation.  Additionally, characters we come to like can make wrong choices--even deadly ones.The protaganist is a police detective who recently lost his wife and children in a freek mass vanishing of millions of people.  He continues his work, but is tormented, torn and confused.  When the government targets &quot;Haters&quot; (aka Christians) for a series of domestic terrorism incidents, the detective is skeptical.Two humorous characters are a blind sister of one of the hater leaders, and a wheelchair-bound computer geek.  Both are torn between a government line that seems promising, yet suspicious, and the Christian view, which is frightening, but compelling.There is solid suspense here, and some provocative dialogue.  The story is talk-driven, and the acting is good for a film with such a low budget.Bottom-line:  Worthwhile for Christians, and interesting for the spiritually curious.",4,"Good balance of drama, suspense and occasional humor",1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,1072,"['One', 'fault', 'many', 'end', 'times', 'stories', 'everyone', 'good', 'bad', 'confused', 'so', 'earnest', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'still', 'time', 'romantic', 'flirtation', 'Additionally', 'characters', 'come', 'like', 'can', 'make', 'wrong', 'choices', 'even', 'deadly', 'ones.The', 'protaganist', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'wife', 'children', 'freek', 'mass', 'vanishing', 'millions', 'people', 'work', 'tormented', 'torn', 'confused', 'When', 'government', 'targets', 'quot', 'Haters', 'quot', 'Christians', 'series', 'domestic', 'terrorism', 'incidents', 'detective', 'skeptical.Two', 'humorous', 'characters', 'are', 'blind', 'sister', 'one', 'hater', 'leaders', 'wheelchair-bound', 'computer', 'geek', 'are', 'torn', 'government', 'line', 'promising', 'yet', 'suspicious', 'Christian', 'view', 'frightening', 'compelling.There', 'solid', 'suspense', 'here', 'provocative', 'dialogue', 'story', 'talk-driven', 'acting', 'good', 'film', 'low', 'budget.Bottom-line', 'Worthwhile', 'Christians', 'interesting', 'spiritually', 'curious']",Revelation VHS
