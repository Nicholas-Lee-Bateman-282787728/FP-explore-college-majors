This is definitely one of them. The title is a parody of the classic 'How the West was Won' (a great movie) and the storyline is believable, with the villains making sense within the plot.

87827,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,0790727803,Molly P.,"[14, 14]","Kids should like this, especially if they are Mary-Kate and Ashley fans.  The Olsen twins play Susie and Jessica, daugters of a single dad who gets an invitation to visit his relative's ranch.  The girls' mother (who has passed away) loved to spend time at the ranch when she was the girls' age.  While there, Susie and Jessica discover some secret treasures that belonged to their mom.  Meanwhile, the ranch owner's son has evil plans to sell the ranch and turn it into a theme park.  So the girls come up with a plan to save the ranch.  &quot;How The West Was Fun&quot; is funny and sweet and a lot of fun.  There's some action, but nothing too scary for kids, I don't think.  Horses, nature, river rafting -- lots of fun outdoorsy stuff.

He did a good job in film, despite a weird helmet hair type thing going on that I had a hard time keeping my eyes of off. The two young stars (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen)soundered labored. The twins were supposed to be nine years old but they looked and acted more like four. The other actors did their best, but with very little action there was just no saving this film.Patrick Cassidy and the Olsen twins live the big city. The twins mother has died and they've grown up quickly being a team with Daddy. They get a letter from their mother's aunt asking them to help save the ranch she's lived on for years. Mother used to tell them about that place! So off they go and too long, too boring story short, they save the ranch.Very little action and that doesn't come until the end of the movie and even then it isn't what should be considered real action.My nieces 4,5, and 7, stopped watching after less than a minute.",1,Boooorrrriiinnngggg!,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,986,"['only', 'bought', 'movie', 'admire', 'Patrick', 'Cassidy', 'work', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'weird', 'helmet', 'hair', 'type', 'thing', 'going', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'off', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'soundered', 'labored', 'twins', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'looked', 'acted', 'more', 'four', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'was', 'just', 'no', 'saving', 'film.Patrick', 'Cassidy', 'Olsen', 'live', 'big', 'city', 'twins', 'mother', 'died', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'quickly', 'being', 'team', 'Daddy', 'get', 'letter', 'mother', 'aunt', 'asking', 'help', 'save', 'ranch', 'lived', 'years', 'Mother', 'used', 'tell', 'place', 'So', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'boring', 'story', 'short', 'save', 'ranch.Very', 'little', 'action', ""n't"", 'come', 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'then', ""n't"", 'what', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'real', 'action.My', 'nieces', '4,5', '7', 'stopped', 'watching', 'less', 'minute']",N/A
