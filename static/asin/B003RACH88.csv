The character are all using different transportation, truck, car, skateboards, bicycles, and train engine. My daughter tries to say them all when she sees them. She's watch it enough where she knows all the characters and what they are riding. Of course her favorite part is The Hot Dog Song at the end, she loves to dance the Hot Dog. As Henrietta says ""its not who finishes first"".",5,Road Racing Mickey,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,585,"['Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Road', 'Rally', 'video', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'featuring', 'Mickey', 'Minnie', 'Donald', 'Daisy', 'Goofy', 'Ludwick', 'Von', 'Drake', 'Piston', 'Pete', 'Tootles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Chip', 'Dale', 'Henrietta', 'Cow', 'character', 'are', 'using', 'different', 'transportation', 'truck', 'car', 'skateboards', 'bicycles', 'train', 'engine', 'daughter', 'tries', 'say', 'when', 'watch', 'enough', 'where', 'characters', 'what', 'are', 'riding', 'course', 'favorite', 'part', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'Song', 'end', 'dance', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'Henrietta', 'not', 'who', 'finishes', 'first']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Road Rally

1360810,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B003RACH88,Talvi,"[7, 7]","This originally aired in September of 2010 and my 3 year old fell in love.  Six months later he's still asking to see it (and he acts out scenes from the movie with his Mickey Rescue Truck).Mickey and his friends decide to have a Road Rally, and each one chooses their favorite vehicle.  Mickey drives the toon car, Donald has a train, Chip and Dale have a scooter, Minnie a bicycle, Daisy on roller skates, Pluto on a skateboard, ""Piston"" Pete on a scooter, Toodles on a tricycle, and Goofy...finds he has a broken bicycle.  The Professor presents him with a surprise - a rescue truck.  He tells Goofy he just needs to provide assistance to anyone who needs it.  As a side note, wonderfully, all road rally racers are wearing proper protective gear.Pete thinks it's a race and holds up the tortoise and the hare side of the story while all the others stick together and follow Clarabell's map and instructions.  They go to the Mickey park, the desert, to Misteltoe Mountain, to the jungle, and more, solving puzzles and finding the Mickey Markers along the way.It's all very celebratory, colorful, and fun, with great teamwork and camaraderie (even Pete joins in at the end, proving that it's about having fun together and not about winning).  The music is great and be warned...it sticks in your head!It's really nice to have something we both love to watch that has really positive messages for my son.  There's accompanying extras on the DVD, including an interactive feature and Pluto Lends a Paw.On the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse website, there is a fun interactive Road Rally game as well where my son spins the spinner and moves the corresponding spaces, clearing the way for the road rally.  It's all great - as colorful and fun as all the balloons that fly during the movie.",5,Great Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Feature,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1780,"['originally', 'aired', 'September', '2010', '3', 'year', 'old', 'fell', 'love', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'still', 'asking', 'see', 'out', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Mickey', 'Rescue', 'Truck', '.Mickey', 'friends', 'decide', 'have', 'Road', 'Rally', 'one', 'favorite', 'vehicle', 'Mickey', 'toon', 'car', 'Donald', 'train', 'Chip', 'Dale', 'have', 'scooter', 'Minnie', 'bicycle', 'Daisy', 'roller', 'skates', 'Pluto', 'skateboard', 'Piston', 'Pete', 'scooter', 'Toodles', 'tricycle', 'Goofy', 'broken', 'bicycle', 'Professor', 'surprise', 'rescue', 'truck', 'Goofy', 'just', 'provide', 'assistance', 'anyone', 'who', 'side', 'note', 'wonderfully', 'road', 'rally', 'racers', 'are', 'wearing', 'proper', 'protective', 'gear.Pete', 'race', 'up', 'tortoise', 'hare', 'side', 'story', 'others', 'stick', 'together', 'follow', 'Clarabell', 'map', 'instructions', 'go', 'Mickey', 'park', 'desert', 'Misteltoe', 'Mountain', 'jungle', 'more', 'solving', 'puzzles', 'finding', 'Mickey', 'Markers', 'way.It', 'very', 'celebratory', 'colorful', 'fun', 'great', 'teamwork', 'camaraderie', 'even', 'Pete', 'end', 'proving', 'having', 'fun', 'together', 'not', 'winning', 'music', 'great', 'be', 'warned', 'head', 'really', 'nice', 'have', 'something', 'love', 'watch', 'really', 'positive', 'messages', 'son', 'accompanying', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', 'interactive', 'feature', 'Pluto', 'Paw.On', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'website', 'fun', 'interactive', 'Road', 'Rally', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'son', 'spinner', 'corresponding', 'spaces', 'clearing', 'way', 'road', 'rally', 'great', 'colorful', 'fun', 'balloons', 'fly', 'movie']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Road Rally
