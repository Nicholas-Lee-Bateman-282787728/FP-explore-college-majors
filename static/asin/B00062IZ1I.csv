This movie is heart-warming, fun, and sweet.The cast is excellent.  Joanna Kerns really has a chance to shine, and she looks gorgeous too!  Della Reese, William R. Moses, and Harley Jane Kozak are all excellent too.I really find this movie touching.  It is about forgiveness and redemption, and about making those choices before it is too late.  The picture and sound quality were great, and there weren't any bonus features.  I am really glad that I have this movie on DVD to watch again and again -- and it was really a great bargain.",5,Great TV movie on DVD,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,640,"['remember', 'loving', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'Watching', 'again', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'heart-warming', 'fun', 'sweet.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Joanna', 'Kerns', 'really', 'chance', 'shine', 'gorgeous', 'too', 'Della', 'Reese', 'William', 'R.', 'Moses', 'Harley', 'Jane', 'Kozak', 'are', 'excellent', 'too.I', 'really', 'find', 'movie', 'touching', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'making', 'choices', 'too', 'late', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'great', 'were', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'features', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'bargain']",Emma's Wish
