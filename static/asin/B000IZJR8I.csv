1022605,A2JOTVRQSHC7CH,B000IZJR8I,Elizabeth,"[1, 1]","I really enjoyed seeing Shah Rukh Khan as a tough guy in this film. He played the part very well. The element of romance for him in this film was low-key. And even though the romantic aspect of his film roles has always been a highlight, having the romantic intrest low-key did not alter the powerful impact of his role in this film. His protectiveness over his sister was impressive. Aishwara Rai, of course, was beautiful and I loved seeing her in this film. The man who played her love interest did a wonderful job. The similarity to West Side Story was nice. I prefer this film over West Side Story. Shah Rukh Khan drew out strong sympathy in my heart for him at the end of the film. This is a powerful and wonderful film.",5,Loved this film!,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,726,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'tough', 'guy', 'film', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'element', 'romance', 'film', 'was', 'low-key', 'even', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'film', 'roles', 'always', 'been', 'highlight', 'having', 'romantic', 'intrest', 'low-key', 'did', 'not', 'alter', 'powerful', 'impact', 'role', 'film', 'protectiveness', 'sister', 'was', 'impressive', 'Aishwara', 'Rai', 'course', 'was', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'seeing', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'love', 'interest', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'similarity', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'was', 'nice', 'prefer', 'film', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'drew', 'out', 'strong', 'sympathy', 'heart', 'end', 'film', 'powerful', 'wonderful', 'film']",Josh
1022606,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B000IZJR8I,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[1, 1]","Director Mansoor Khan took the classic American musical West Side Story and turned it into a distinctly Indian tale. While West Side Story harkens back to America's past, Josh is relevant to contemporary India--with its many contentious ethnic and religious factions--and the film is therefore tinged with an immediacy and realism that's missing from the Broadway musical. Josh takes place in Goa, a city on the western coast of India that was colonized by the Portuguese, and many Goans are Catholic and have European names. The opposing gangs in this adaptation are Catholic and Hindu. Max (played by Shahrukh Khan) is the leader of the Catholic gang and Prakash (Sharad Kapoor) the leader of the Hindu gang. Prakash's sensitive brother Rahul (Chandrachur Singh), who wants nothing to do with the gang, falls in love with Max's sister Shirley (Aishwarya Rai). The Indian version interestingly diverges from the American original with a complicating subplot about a shameful family secret and the reverberations of colonialism. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1121,"['Director', 'Mansoor', 'Khan', 'took', 'classic', 'American', 'musical', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'turned', 'distinctly', 'Indian', 'tale', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'back', 'America', 'past', 'Josh', 'relevant', 'contemporary', 'India', 'many', 'contentious', 'ethnic', 'religious', 'factions', 'film', 'therefore', 'tinged', 'immediacy', 'realism', 'missing', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Josh', 'place', 'Goa', 'city', 'western', 'coast', 'India', 'was', 'colonized', 'Portuguese', 'many', 'Goans', 'are', 'Catholic', 'have', 'European', 'names', 'opposing', 'gangs', 'adaptation', 'are', 'Catholic', 'Hindu', 'Max', 'played', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'leader', 'Catholic', 'gang', 'Prakash', 'Sharad', 'Kapoor', 'leader', 'Hindu', 'gang', 'Prakash', 'sensitive', 'brother', 'Rahul', 'Chandrachur', 'Singh', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'gang', 'love', 'Max', 'sister', 'Shirley', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Indian', 'version', 'interestingly', 'American', 'original', 'complicating', 'subplot', 'shameful', 'family', 'secret', 'reverberations', 'colonialism', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Josh

Yes I have seen West Side story!We actually found it a bit boring and not SRKs or Aishwaryas greatest roles. Rather low key and the dances didnt really grab us either.The focus is on the tit-for-tat thuggery between 2 delinquent gangs (one headed by SRK who did a Fonzie impersonation but without his usual ability to bring something else out of the character),2,Must be a matter of taste,1226966400,"11 18, 2008",2008,474,"['daughter', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'Bollywood', 'yet', 'one', 'didnt', 'hit', 'spot', 'did', 'reviewer', 'Yes', 'have', 'seen', 'West', 'Side', 'story', 'actually', 'found', 'bit', 'boring', 'not', 'SRKs', 'Aishwaryas', 'greatest', 'roles', 'Rather', 'low', 'key', 'dances', 'didnt', 'really', 'grab', 'either.The', 'focus', 'tit-for-tat', 'thuggery', '2', 'delinquent', 'gangs', 'one', 'headed', 'SRK', 'who', 'did', 'Fonzie', 'impersonation', 'usual', 'ability', 'bring', 'something', 'else', 'character']",Josh
