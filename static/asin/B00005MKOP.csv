I bought this thinking I could use it for my 20th Century Humanities class, but it is too detailed (which I love for my own self learning), and too long.  If you need individual 22 minute films on each individual artist and their specific style - get The Impressionists with Tim Marlow - an Art Historian who keeps it simple.  I personally loved watching the DVD and learned from it, but once was enough.

665983,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B00005MKOP,Jeffery Mingo,"[1, 7]","Because Seurat's most famous work sits in Chicago, I am partial to this artist and I think other Chicagoans would be too.  One documentary once said that Berlin residents have much sympathy for Nefertiti since they have her bust in their museum.This work brought up many contradictions.  Though Seurat is seen as a maverick among impressionists, they say he was greatly influenced by the standard Academy.  Though impressionist painting is described now in emotional terms like ""cute"" and ""cheery,"" the work says Seurat was dedicated to scientific principles.Like Souter, Seymour Hoffman, and Delacroix, Seurat never married.  The work says he didn't tell his family about his girlfriend until right before he died.  This is an example of ""the love that dare not speak its name"" referring to an opposite-sex couple.The narrator and an interviewee here have poor French pronunciation.  They often pronounce the T in the artist's name, though it is usually silent in French.  They spoke of ""Les Poseurs"" as if they S at the end had sound, rather than being mute.  I imagine that these pointilist works would have taken FOREVER to paint, but time constraints as an issue never comes up in this work.The narrator stated that Seurat painted working-class people, unlike the other impressionists who painted middle-class ones.  It's hard for me to see that as his subjects were still involved in leisure activities.  This ability to have fun I usually associate with having money to spend on fun.  The whole documentary gushes over Seurat, but some things just failed to impress me.  A ballerina is shown atop a horse and she surely would have fallen of the animal in real life.  Seurat painted his girlfriend as being chubby, so how was she able to keep a job as a dancer?  The work shows a nude painting of a female with huge, curvy hips but a very flat chest.  I doubt androgyny was Seurat's goal there; it's just an unrealistic painting of a woman.  Further, some of his work has a cartoonish look that is hard to admire even though the school was dedicated to moving away from realism.",3,The Pointilist,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2084,"['Seurat', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'sits', 'Chicago', 'am', 'partial', 'artist', 'think', 'other', 'Chicagoans', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'One', 'documentary', 'once', 'said', 'Berlin', 'residents', 'have', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Nefertiti', 'have', 'bust', 'museum.This', 'work', 'brought', 'up', 'many', 'contradictions', 'Seurat', 'seen', 'maverick', 'impressionists', 'say', 'was', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'standard', 'Academy', 'Though', 'impressionist', 'painting', 'described', 'now', 'emotional', 'terms', 'cute', 'cheery', 'work', 'Seurat', 'was', 'dedicated', 'scientific', 'principles.Like', 'Souter', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Delacroix', 'Seurat', 'never', 'married', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'family', 'girlfriend', 'right', 'died', 'example', 'love', 'not', 'speak', 'name', 'referring', 'opposite-sex', 'couple.The', 'narrator', 'interviewee', 'here', 'have', 'poor', 'French', 'pronunciation', 'often', 'pronounce', 'T', 'artist', 'name', 'usually', 'silent', 'French', 'spoke', 'Les', 'Poseurs', 'S', 'end', 'had', 'sound', 'rather', 'being', 'mute', 'imagine', 'pointilist', 'works', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'FOREVER', 'paint', 'time', 'constraints', 'issue', 'never', 'up', 'work.The', 'narrator', 'stated', 'Seurat', 'painted', 'working-class', 'people', 'other', 'impressionists', 'who', 'painted', 'middle-class', 'ones', 'hard', 'see', 'subjects', 'were', 'still', 'involved', 'leisure', 'activities', 'ability', 'have', 'fun', 'usually', 'associate', 'having', 'money', 'spend', 'fun', 'whole', 'documentary', 'gushes', 'Seurat', 'things', 'just', 'failed', 'impress', 'ballerina', 'shown', 'horse', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'animal', 'real', 'life', 'Seurat', 'painted', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'chubby', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'job', 'dancer', 'work', 'nude', 'painting', 'female', 'huge', 'curvy', 'hips', 'very', 'flat', 'chest', 'doubt', 'was', 'Seurat', 'goal', 'there', 'just', 'unrealistic', 'painting', 'woman', 'Further', 'work', 'cartoonish', 'look', 'hard', 'admire', 'even', 'school', 'was', 'dedicated', 'moving', 'away', 'realism']",N/A

Principle writer and director Bruce Alfred illustrates the revolutionary, artistic impulses of a brilliant young group of painters who feverishly worked together to break the confines of 19th century traditional painting. Alfred fuses together the historical context of 19th century art Europe with delightfully animated biographies of the Impressionist artists.In 1859, Claude Monet, the youthful, rebellious, dazzlingly artistic, fame-seeking leader of the group burst forth onto the Parisian scene like balefire. Knowing he was a brilliant painter, Monet sought to breathe new artistic ideals into the electrifying Parisian art scene. He wanted to challenge the prestigious Salon Jury with his exquisite seascape paintings. Monet painted the Life and Nature surrounding him, instead of painting traditional, historical paintings. He immediately befriended liberal Camille Pissaro, an avant-garde painter of landscapes and everyday Island life, who was also longing to abandon traditional painting.Together, Monet and Pissaro banished from their canvases the traditionally accepted historical, mythological, and religious paintings of their time; instead, they began painting life as they experienced it. They began to paint Sensations - fractured sun light enveloping trees, water shimmering with light, Parisians rushing down a busy street.By 1862, Monet and Pissaro surrounded themselves with other, artistically adventurous visionaries: traditionalist August Renoir, the notoriously shocking and egocentric Edouard Manet, obsessive-compulsive Edgar Degas, and the oppressed Bertha Morisot, who would receive artistic praise from these brilliant men, inspiring her to remain the sole female artist in the male-dominated art world.It would take 12 years (1874) before art critics would finally have the chance to critique their paintings. The critiques, however, were ill-fated; their works were deemed incomplete; critics considered the works ""impressions"" of what the completed painting might look like, if the artists went back and finished their paintings. The artists, however, did not...This group forged a lifelong friendship, painting together amidst war, poverty, mental anguish, love, rejection, disappointment, and finally, in their dying years, positive recognition.",5,Luminous & Brilliant - A Must See For ALL Art Lovers,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,2332,"['E', 'special', 'Impressionists', 'Luminous', 'Principle', 'writer', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Alfred', 'revolutionary', 'artistic', 'impulses', 'brilliant', 'young', 'group', 'painters', 'who', 'feverishly', 'worked', 'together', 'break', 'confines', '19th', 'century', 'traditional', 'painting', 'Alfred', 'together', 'historical', 'context', '19th', 'century', 'Europe', 'delightfully', 'animated', 'biographies', 'Impressionist', 'artists.In', '1859', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'youthful', 'rebellious', 'dazzlingly', 'artistic', 'fame-seeking', 'leader', 'group', 'burst', 'forth', 'Parisian', 'scene', 'balefire', 'Knowing', 'was', 'brilliant', 'painter', 'Monet', 'sought', 'breathe', 'new', 'artistic', 'ideals', 'electrifying', 'Parisian', 'art', 'scene', 'wanted', 'challenge', 'prestigious', 'Salon', 'Jury', 'exquisite', 'seascape', 'paintings', 'Monet', 'painted', 'Life', 'Nature', 'surrounding', 'instead', 'painting', 'traditional', 'historical', 'paintings', 'immediately', 'befriended', 'liberal', 'Camille', 'Pissaro', 'avant-garde', 'painter', 'landscapes', 'everyday', 'Island', 'life', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'longing', 'abandon', 'traditional', 'painting.Together', 'Monet', 'Pissaro', 'banished', 'canvases', 'traditionally', 'accepted', 'historical', 'mythological', 'religious', 'paintings', 'time', 'instead', 'began', 'painting', 'life', 'experienced', 'began', 'paint', 'Sensations', 'fractured', 'sun', 'light', 'enveloping', 'trees', 'water', 'shimmering', 'light', 'Parisians', 'rushing', 'down', 'busy', 'street.By', '1862', 'Monet', 'Pissaro', 'surrounded', 'other', 'artistically', 'adventurous', 'visionaries', 'traditionalist', 'August', 'Renoir', 'notoriously', 'shocking', 'egocentric', 'Edouard', 'Manet', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'Edgar', 'Degas', 'oppressed', 'Bertha', 'Morisot', 'who', 'would', 'receive', 'artistic', 'praise', 'brilliant', 'men', 'inspiring', 'remain', 'sole', 'female', 'artist', 'male-dominated', 'art', 'world.It', 'would', 'take', '12', 'years', '1874', 'art', 'critics', 'would', 'finally', 'have', 'chance', 'critique', 'paintings', 'critiques', 'however', 'were', 'ill-fated', 'works', 'were', 'deemed', 'incomplete', 'critics', 'considered', 'works', 'impressions', 'what', 'completed', 'painting', 'might', 'look', 'artists', 'went', 'back', 'finished', 'paintings', 'artists', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'group', 'forged', 'lifelong', 'friendship', 'painting', 'together', 'amidst', 'war', 'poverty', 'mental', 'anguish', 'love', 'rejection', 'disappointment', 'finally', 'dying', 'years', 'positive', 'recognition']",N/A

Van Steenkiste,"[34, 34]","The Impressionists: The Other French Revolution, a two-DVD set, introduces viewers to one of the most influential schools in the history of visual arts: The French Impressionists / Pointillists of the 19th century.  Art scholars chronicle the life, historical context, and the most celebrated works of artists such as:1) Edgar Degas2) Edouard Manet3) Claude Monet4) Berthe Morisot5) Camille Pissaro6) Pierre Auguste Renoir7) George Seurat8) Alfred SisleyWhat is remarkable in reviewing these names is to (re)discover how much artistic talent was present in France, especially in Paris, in the second-half of the 19th century.To their credit, art scholars clearly explain the early struggles of the French Impressionists to overcome the artistic conservatism of the state-run Acad&eacute;mie.  The annual juried art show, the Salon de Paris, was the embodiment of the Acad&eacute;mie's reluctance to embrace change.  In the end, the Acad&eacute;mie was no match to stop the eventual triumph of these engaged painters who broke many rules in revolutionizing painting techniques and subjects. The on-location photography in France gives viewers a better appreciation of the surroundings that were familiar to these artists.  For all its merits, The Impressionists DVD-set cannot be a substitute for standing in front of these masterpieces that assure their authors a place in the artistic pantheon of humanity.",5,"Fleeting Impressions, Eternal Beauty",1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,1407,"['Impressionists', 'Other', 'French', 'Revolution', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'viewers', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'schools', 'history', 'visual', 'arts', 'French', 'Impressionists', '/', 'Pointillists', '19th', 'century', 'Art', 'chronicle', 'life', 'historical', 'context', 'most', 'celebrated', 'works', 'artists', 'such', 'as:1', 'Edgar', 'Degas2', 'Edouard', 'Manet3', 'Claude', 'Monet4', 'Berthe', 'Morisot5', 'Camille', 'Pissaro6', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir7', 'George', 'Seurat8', 'Alfred', 'SisleyWhat', 'remarkable', 'reviewing', 'names', 're', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'artistic', 'talent', 'was', 'present', 'France', 'especially', 'Paris', 'second-half', '19th', 'century.To', 'credit', 'art', 'scholars', 'clearly', 'explain', 'early', 'struggles', 'French', 'Impressionists', 'overcome', 'artistic', 'conservatism', 'state-run', 'Acad', 'eacute', 'mie', 'annual', 'juried', 'art', 'show', 'Salon', 'de', 'Paris', 'was', 'embodiment', 'Acad', 'eacute', 'mie', 'reluctance', 'embrace', 'change', 'end', 'Acad', 'eacute', 'was', 'match', 'stop', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'engaged', 'painters', 'who', 'broke', 'many', 'rules', 'revolutionizing', 'painting', 'techniques', 'subjects', 'on-location', 'photography', 'France', 'viewers', 'better', 'appreciation', 'surroundings', 'were', 'familiar', 'artists', 'merits', 'Impressionists', 'DVD-set', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'substitute', 'standing', 'front', 'masterpieces', 'assure', 'authors', 'place', 'artistic', 'pantheon', 'humanity']",N/A
