This movie can be found in the DVD section- not in the doll section. All the dolls are sold separately. My daughter requested only a few definite gifts for Xmas, and this was one of them. Otherwise, I would never have bought this. I figure that you can just wait for someone to post it on youtube or for Mattel to even put it out on the MH website. The movie is a little over an hour, and is tolerable adult-wise. It is the bonus footage that stinks. It has three shorts which are two minutes in length each. Yes, you did not read wrong, folks- two minutes. If you wanna be positive, we can do the math and get to a grand total of six minutes. Mattel, people love bonuses in any form.

1569430,A1IDKEABXSZDUB,B008KXLAUS,A. Niendorf,"[4, 7]","I am rating this movie as a mother of 8 and 5 year old girls who love Monster High dolls.  Before I had children I was disgusted by the Bratt dolls with too much makeup and revealing clothes, I could not believe parents would let their girls play with them.  Well......there is not too much difference in the makeup and clothing style of MH girls vs Bratt dolls and I am a little mad at myself for allowing these dolls and hoping that they can see that the styles are (much like Barbie) not what you wear in the real world.  Anyway, I read the reviews for this DVD and thought it sounded ok.  While watching it I found that it is teenager oriented and not really for little girls.  There are relationship problems and dating problems that the girls deal with.  Also, it is really offensive the way they portray the local police.  They make the cops, who play a large part in the storyline, look like complete idiots who only care about eating donuts and judging the MH students.I do think the dolls are kind of cute but there won't be anymore MH DVDs in our household.

1569445,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B008KXLAUS,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[33, 42]","I'm old enough to remember when the activists who would go on to ruin broadcast television for children first sounded warnings against half hour or one hour commercials, that is animated children's TV shows based upon an existing line of toys.  Frankly, I never understood the alleged vast moral difference between doing this as opposed to creating the TV show FIRST and only THEN merchandising the crap out of it with dolls, action figures, boardgames, Underoos, etc., but I DID find the designations useful because in those bad old days, the toy-based TV shows tended to be just awful, and I studiously avoided them.Well, time has passed, and would be creators of children's videos with even an ounce of controversy or creativity have largely abandoned broadcast TV, first for cable and then for the Internet, and somewhere along the way toy companies figured out that more was required in an era when watching commercials required making a positive choice.  As a father of young children, I have been forced to watch more children's videos (of both kinds) than the Geneva Conventions would allow, and for sanity's sake have come to appreciate the ones that try hardest to be clever, including some real surprises.  The Barbie videos in particular, instead of being the eye clawing horrors I expected, turned out to be rather entertaining, but the best of them all IMHO have turned out to be the Monster High videos, including this first commercial DVD release.  There was an earlier Monster High DVD release of the 1st TV special ""New Ghoul at School"" but it was only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Ghoulia Yelps Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Cleo De Nile Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Lagoona Blue Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Deuce Gorgon Doll with exclusive DVD, andMonster High Dawn Of The Dance 3 Pack: Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura, and Frankie Stein Dolls with exclusive DVD,until recently when it was reissued as a retailer exclusive both separately and as part of a 2-pack with Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature.What makes the Monster High videos work so well IMHO is that the writers are gently making fun of the fashion doll mania that they are in fact trying to promote.  Taking the universal American experience of High School and adding the twist of the entire student body being the children of famous monsters gives them endless possibilities for parody (and self parody, as the heroines are for the most part over the top, fashion crazed, popularity obsessed teenagers).Now to the movie.  The plot involves newbie Frankie Stein's first Halloween (she was just recently created by Dr. Frankenstein rather than being born) where she learns to her horror that her fellow monsters regard Halloween (a holiday her normal human teen magazines celebrate) as a day of danger for hiding from humans.  In her attempts to get at the truth of the matter, Frankie (as per usual) sets in motion a cascading series of increasing catastrophes that it will be up to her and her friends to salvage a happy ending from (and push a gentle but persistent message that our differences shouldn't unnecessarily divide us).  The film also packs in a number of hilarious gags and subplots involving the MC's relationship problems.  (You think YOU had BF/GF problems in HS?)  Finally, the DVD contains three (formerly) exclusive ""webisodes"" now watchable for free on the Monster High web site, for some reason arranged in reverse chronological order:44 Flowers for Slow Moe39 I Scream, You Scream38 No Ghouls AllowedNote: A retailer exclusive version of this DVD is obtainable from certain merchants containing an extra DVD with the first 15 Monster High ""webisodes"" on it.  Of course these ""webisodes"" are free to view online, but since they are being sold for the same price as the non-exclusive DVD's, they are arguably the better buy.Note: For some reason the

Even when a group of high school kids prank their school Frankie doesn't believe it right and find the truth in catacombs.  A secret Halloween room between human and monster sides of town where both sides use to come together and party on Halloween night. When Frankie tries to tell others Cleo stir up the monsters prank back and result with them on the run from the police and hiding out in a Normie Halloween party where they make new friends to help them against the problems Cleo and Van Helsing's niece is causing between the two schools.
