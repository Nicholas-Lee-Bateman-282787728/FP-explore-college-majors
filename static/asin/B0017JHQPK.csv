That may be the newfangled saying of romantic dramedy `Definitely, Maybe' an episodic, story-telling film about the hopes and disappointments of aspiring Democratic campaign worker and lover, Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds).Adorable as usual, Abigail Breslin plays his daughter, Maya, and as typical of other Breslin performances, her character is precocious, but lovable.  The movie starts with Will picking her up at school where a ruckus ensues after some controversial sex-ed lessons have taken place.  Although progressive, Will has difficultly hearing his daughter talk so explicitly about sex as they arrive home.  Yet all this leads up to a discussion about her origins.The rest of movie has Will telling her the story of how he met her mother.  For her this is an important point about her indirectly stated desire to be loved and not thought as a fluke or an accident.  Starting back from 1988 when as a student in Madison, WI he campaigned hard for Dukakis's victory for President and Vice President George H.W. Bush's defeat, he also marks his romantic journey.  In Madison he falls in love with Emily (Elizabeth Banks) who shares his passion for the campaign and romance.Ambition, however, delivers an unsteady hand as he fast-forwards to 1992 when Will sets his sites on New York City and his hopes on Bill Clinton.  Starting at the bottom, he's known as ""The T.P. Guy,"" at campaign headquarters, replenishing supplies and getting coffee and bagels.  Experience, however, gets him to do more and soon he is calling for donations.  It also gives him a chance to meet other women.  April Hoffman (Isla Fisher)  is the copy girl who is independent romantically as she is politically.  Then, there's  Summer Hartley (Rachel Weisz) who's romantically attached to Hampton Roth, a professor providing a spring-autumn live in relationship where Summer is closer to spring.  In the mix are diaries and an intimate note in a copy of 'Jane Eyre' that try to bind all these romances together.I found myself liking the characters in 'Definitely, Maybe'.  I could also appreciate the real life importance of the proceedings.  Just as we know it, Will is ready and available when his loved one isn't, and when he's on the mend, she isn't and vice versa.  Ambiguity is well documented, and commitments are difficult to keep at best.  The movie's not only bookmarked by exchanged books, but the music as well.  R.E.M.'s ""Stand"" heralds 1988; ""Come as You Are,"" pinpoints 1992 with Nirvana, etc.  In love and politics, the players get what they put into it.  Clinton and Lacredo aren't permanent or perfect and neither are the lovers in one`s everyday life.  I enjoyed the characters, the humor, and the developments, but sometimes I thought 'Definitely, Maybe' was slight at times and could have delivered more.  Well, did I like the movie?

1157177,AVHN134ADVP4R,B0017JHQPK,"A4Q96 ""Gadget Lover""","[1, 1]","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS NEAR THE END!!!)  I saw this on HBO while on a business trip, sort of against my will, as I couldn't find anything else on TV.  I was pleasantly surprised, as it's a really good movie (as long as you aren't overly analytical about it).Ryan Reynolds plays Will, a 30-something dad with a 10 year old daughter, Maya, (played beautifully by Abagail Breslin).  Will is on the verge of divorce from his wife/Maya's mother.  Maya is clearly upset by the upcoming split, and an ill-timed sex ed class (isn't 10 a little young for Sex Ed?  I've forgotten...) triggers lots of questions for her dad about how he met her mother and why he married her.  He proceeds to tell Maya the story of the three women he has loved without disclosing which one is her mother.Disclaimers:1)  You have to suspend your logic while watching this movie, as Breslin is precocious well beyond her years and asks questions and makes insightful observations many adults don't make.2)  This review has a few SPOILERS in it - not anything you can't figure out, but I some folks don't want to know what happens.I think there are many things to recommend this film:1) The chemistry between Will and Maya is great...  They play the father/daughter combo with aplomb.  Breslin is great (as she was in Little Miss Sunshine).2) Summer (played by Rachel Weisz) and April (played by Isla Fisher) are great as two of Will's loves.  Each plays a perfect character that complements Will.  You get a real sense of how he could have ended up with either of them (and almost does, or does).3) Ryan Reynolds is quite effective as a more complex character - it is a real treat to see Van Wilder's deeper side.  It's clear from Reynolds' other roles that he has range.  He hasn't picked very many vehicles before this that display it.  It suits him.The biggest issue with the film? (Here's a SPOILER!).  Ironically,  I was least impressed with Emily (Elizabeth Banks), his college sweetheart. She is the woman who is eventually turns out to be Will's wife/Maya's mom.  She seemed shallower than the other two characters, and it was difficult for me to figure out why Will would have married her.  While Summer lets him down in pursuit of career advancement, and April seems too mercurial to him and their timing just doesn't match, Emily cheats on Will the first time around with his piggish, chauvinistic roommate Charlie (completely far fetched, unless she is a complete idiot), and then reappears with the weak premise that ""maybe our timing was off the first time"", which Will inexplicably buys hook, line, and sinker.  It leaves me momentarily thinking less of Will.  You also cringe at times at Will's ""full disclosure"" to Maya of his romantic/sex life.  It is a bit extensive (even if she did just have a sex ed class) with mentions of threesomes and more detail than most fathers would give their 10 (or 30) year old daughters.All in all, highly recommended.  My wife and I liked it so much we bought it.",4,Really good movie!,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,2993,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'NEAR', 'THE', 'END', 'saw', 'HBO', 'business', 'trip', 'sort', 'will', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'overly', 'analytical', 'Reynolds', 'plays', 'Will', '30-something', 'dad', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Abagail', 'Breslin', 'Will', 'verge', 'divorce', 'wife/Maya', 'mother', 'Maya', 'clearly', 'upset', 'upcoming', 'split', 'ill-timed', 'sex', 'ed', 'class', ""n't"", '10', 'little', 'young', 'Sex', 'Ed', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'triggers', 'lots', 'questions', 'dad', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'why', 'married', 'tell', 'Maya', 'story', 'three', 'women', 'loved', 'disclosing', 'one', 'mother.Disclaimers:1', 'have', 'suspend', 'logic', 'watching', 'movie', 'Breslin', 'precocious', 'well', 'years', 'asks', 'questions', 'insightful', 'observations', 'many', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'make.2', 'review', 'few', 'SPOILERS', 'not', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happens.I', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'recommend', 'film:1', 'chemistry', 'Will', 'Maya', 'great', 'play', 'father/daughter', 'combo', 'aplomb', 'Breslin', 'great', 'was', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', '.2', 'Summer', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'April', 'played', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'are', 'great', 'two', 'Will', 'loves', 'perfect', 'character', 'complements', 'Will', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'almost', '.3', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'quite', 'effective', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'deeper', 'side', 'clear', 'Reynolds', 'other', 'roles', 'range', ""n't"", 'picked', 'very', 'many', 'vehicles', 'suits', 'him.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'film', 'Here', 'SPOILER', 'Ironically', 'was', 'least', 'impressed', 'Emily', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'woman', 'who', 'eventually', 'out', 'be', 'Will', 'wife/Maya', 'mom', 'seemed', 'shallower', 'other', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Will', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'Summer', 'down', 'pursuit', 'career', 'advancement', 'April', 'too', 'mercurial', 'timing', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'Emily', 'Will', 'first', 'time', 'piggish', 'chauvinistic', 'roommate', 'Charlie', 'completely', 'far', 'fetched', 'complete', 'idiot', 'then', 'reappears', 'weak', 'premise', 'maybe', 'timing', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Will', 'inexplicably', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'momentarily', 'thinking', 'less', 'Will', 'also', 'cringe', 'times', 'Will', 'full', 'disclosure', 'Maya', 'romantic/sex', 'life', 'bit', 'extensive', 'even', 'did', 'just', 'have', 'sex', 'ed', 'class', 'mentions', 'threesomes', 'more', 'detail', 'most', 'fathers', 'would', 'give', '10', '30', 'year', 'old', 'daughters.All', 'highly', 'recommended', 'wife', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'bought']",N/A

Not every movie can be ""Casablanca"" just as not every book is ""Crime and Punishment."" Judged by the aims of the makers of this movie, which I take to be to provide an evening of mildly intelligent, pleasant, harmless entertainment, it is a success.No, it's not great -- it's merely good. The acting is fine, the actors are attractive and engaging and the script intelligent enough to keep you watching to the end.All romances depend on the supposition that for each person there is that unique ""soulmate"" who alone can provide a happy and fulfilling life. The protagonist of this movie is faced by three contenders -- which one will he end up with? As he blunders from one romance to the next, never quite finding THE ONE, we hang in with him, knowing of course that it will all turn out OK.One thing I liked in this movie was the juxtoposition of various developments in Bill Clinton's career (the hero works for the 1992 Clinton campaign) through the Monica scandal and onward. (We briefly also glimpse our current president in a 1992 clip looking goofy and idiotic. We should have paid more attention.) The hero gains wisdom even as his youthful illusions about Clinton are gradually destroyed.Bottom line: watch this on the couch with your beloved over a bowl of popcorn, then give him/her a nice big kiss and go to bed happy.",4,pleasant romantic comedy,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,1409,"['When', 'reviewing', 'books', 'movies', 'one', 'judge', 'one', 'own', 'terms', 'Not', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'Casablanca', 'just', 'not', 'book', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Judged', 'aims', 'makers', 'movie', 'take', 'be', 'provide', 'evening', 'mildly', 'intelligent', 'pleasant', 'harmless', 'entertainment', 'success.No', 'not', 'great', 'merely', 'good', 'acting', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'attractive', 'engaging', 'script', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'end.All', 'depend', 'supposition', 'person', 'unique', 'soulmate', 'who', 'alone', 'can', 'provide', 'happy', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'faced', 'three', 'contenders', 'one', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'romance', 'next', 'never', 'quite', 'finding', 'THE', 'ONE', 'hang', 'knowing', 'course', 'will', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'OK.One', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'juxtoposition', 'various', 'developments', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'career', 'hero', '1992', 'Clinton', 'campaign', 'Monica', 'scandal', 'onward', 'briefly', 'also', 'glimpse', 'current', 'president', '1992', 'clip', 'looking', 'goofy', 'idiotic', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'hero', 'gains', 'wisdom', 'even', 'youthful', 'illusions', 'Clinton', 'are', 'gradually', 'destroyed.Bottom', 'line', 'watch', 'couch', 'beloved', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'then', 'give', 'him/her', 'nice', 'big', 'kiss', 'go', 'happy']",N/A

1157181,A14N5L5T089VX3,B0017JHQPK,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[40, 42]","In most romantic comedies, you have a story where boy meets girl, then boy loses girl, and finally boy and girl re-unite and live happily ever after (or v.v.).""Definitely, Maybe"" is definitely not your usual run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, and refreshingly so: taking a very different approach to the subject.For starters, the storyline revolves around the relationship between a father (Ryan Reynolds, played by Will Hayes) and his daughter, Maya (played by Abigail Breslin).  Throughout most of the film, Ryan's romantic adventures (and misadventures) are potrayed as a series of flashbacks, as he relates the story of his life to his daughter in the form of a bedtime story.Some of the dialog, particularly Maya's lines, are hysterically, if not shockingly funny - such as a very clinical discussion she has with her father about procreation as he picks her up at school after a ""sex ed"" class: she asks, for instance, how a baby could be ""mistake"" after going through all that effort to try and make one.  Later, she asks her father (after he relates his past relationships to her) ""What's the male word for 'Slut'?""  To which he sheepishly responds ""They're still working on that one.""An interesting twist is that the father thinks he's helping Maya to become more mature and sophisticated in her knowldge of the many emotional dimensions and complexities of adult relationsips.  In fact, there's more to it than that: as Maya's dad tells the story of his relationships with three very different women: ""Emily"", ""Summer"" and ""April"" to his daughter, you see him growing in maturity as he drifts from one relationship into another (and back again).  You also begin to understand why his marriage to Maya's mom failed (as is hinted at the start of the film): he's the one who needed to grow up.  A point emphasized when Maya explicitly tells him so.Ultimately, this movie spoke to me about the importance of maturity in relationships, and about how Love doesn't always come in the package (or place) you expect.I give ""Definitely, Maybe"" four stars - not likely to get an Academy Award, but certainly a sweet, funny story with excellent performances.",4,A different take on Romantic Comedy,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2154,"['most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'story', 'where', 'boy', 'girl', 'then', 'boy', 'girl', 'finally', 'boy', 'girl', 're-unite', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'v.v.', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'definitely', 'not', 'usual', 'run-of-the-mill', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'refreshingly', 'so', 'taking', 'very', 'different', 'approach', 'subject.For', 'starters', 'storyline', 'relationship', 'father', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'most', 'film', 'Ryan', 'romantic', 'adventures', 'misadventures', 'are', 'potrayed', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'story', 'life', 'daughter', 'form', 'bedtime', 'story.Some', 'dialog', 'particularly', 'Maya', 'lines', 'are', 'hysterically', 'not', 'shockingly', 'funny', 'such', 'very', 'clinical', 'discussion', 'father', 'about', 'procreation', 'up', 'school', 'sex', 'ed', 'class', 'instance', 'how', 'baby', 'could', 'be', 'mistake', 'going', 'effort', 'try', 'make', 'one', 'Later', 'father', 'past', 'relationships', 'What', 'male', 'word', ""'Slut"", ""'re"", 'still', 'working', 'one', 'interesting', 'twist', 'father', 'helping', 'Maya', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'knowldge', 'many', 'emotional', 'dimensions', 'complexities', 'adult', 'relationsips', 'fact', 'more', 'Maya', 'dad', 'story', 'relationships', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'Emily', 'Summer', 'April', 'daughter', 'see', 'growing', 'maturity', 'one', 'relationship', 'back', 'again', 'also', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'marriage', 'Maya', 'mom', 'failed', 'hinted', 'start', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'needed', 'grow', 'up', 'point', 'emphasized', 'when', 'Maya', 'explicitly', 'so.Ultimately', 'movie', 'spoke', 'importance', 'maturity', 'relationships', 'how', 'Love', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'package', 'place', 'expect.I', 'give', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'likely', 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'certainly', 'sweet', 'funny', 'story', 'excellent', 'performances']",N/A

Maya begs Will to tell her the story of her mother. Will obliges, changing the names of the women in the story so Maya has to guess which is her mother. It is here that the story starts.I felt disconnected with this film. In the first ten minutes of the film, Maya Hayes talks about thrusting penises more than I have in the last ten years. Her character comes off as a 27 year old woman possessing the body of a ten year old girl. It didn't feel real, or honest. It felt more like the dialog that a young, childless and hip Hollywood writer would write. It felt clueless, and disconnected.Will Hayes proceeds to tell his daughter his story, which includes his interaction with many women, threesome talk, and numerous scenes filled with sexual tension. This also didn't feel real. As a parent of 2 daughters myself, I just could not fathom the purpose behind this, nor could I see myself discussing threesomes, et al, with my young daughters. It was off center, to say the least.Another flaw of the film are the many scenes filled with the political escapades of Will Hayes. They came off as forced, occasionally slipping into agenda driven.

Okay, so sure, it is not `perfect', but honestly, for the sake of this review we will label it as such.  I seriously loved every minute of this movie and would watch it again, any place, any time.The film tells the story of Will Hayes as he tries to explain to his ten-year-old daughter Maya how he met her mother.  We find out immediately that Will and his wife are divorcing and he has his daughter for the night.  She's curious as to how her parents got together and so Will tells her a story about the three women in his life and tells her that she has to figure out which one is her mother.  Maya gets settled into her bed for her `love story mystery' and Will begins his tale of love, life and loss.  Will tells of his relationships with Emily, Summer and April.  Will and Emily were high school sweethearts who grew apart when Will's aspirations to become President of the United States wedged between them.  Summer is the beautiful journalist who's own life goals waged war on her love affair with Will, and April is the spunky idealist who was always too much of a friend to ever become anything more.Will's story is interesting and engrossing, but it is the beautiful story unfolding off screen between father and daughter that touched me deeply.  Sure, the main focus may be on Will's love life, but we are constantly reminded that he is bonding with his daughter, and when Will finally tells Maya the happy ending I dare you to hold back the tears.`Definitely, Maybe' may suffer in some areas from a clich&eacute;d script, but the script never feels tired or boring.  It always rises above its own handicaps to create a story worth listening to and worth adoring.  The ending is far from expected (thank the lord in heaven) and it is one that makes the entire experience all the more gratifying, especially as young Maya begins to understand the true meaning of happiness.The acting is also, for the most part, superb.  Young Abigail Breslin (Oscar nominated I should add) is not my general cup-of-tea when it comes to child acting.  I tend to be more fascinated by the Ronan's and the Fanning's but I must say that her approach to Maya was warm and endearing.  The three women in Will's life were all handled wonderfully by Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz and the outstanding Isla Fisher.  Banks is perfectly warm, the ideal vision of the high school sweetheart (or the `safe' choice).  Weisz is intoxicating, with her come hither stare and her mysterious smile.  Fisher is above and beyond amazing as April, always keeping the audience glued to her every movement.  She is so charming and sincere that one can't help but fall head over heals in love with her.I have always found Reynolds rather bland (except for in `The Amityville Horror') and this is really no exception, but his co-stars elevate his performance drastically.In the end I have to say that this is a delightful film, a wonderful answer back to the romantic comedy of today.  It's charming, sweet and moving and will have you feeling warm and fuzzy all over by the time the credits start to roll.  Sure, some may not find this as engaging and genuine as I have, but I guaranty you that any father (especially one's with daughters) will find this heartwarming to the very last drop.",5,"No if, ands or maybes; this is definitely a wonderful little film...",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,3299,"['one', 'am', 'smitten', 'film', 'Okay', 'so', 'sure', 'not', 'perfect', 'honestly', 'sake', 'review', 'will', 'label', 'such', 'seriously', 'loved', 'minute', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'place', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'explain', 'ten-year-old', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'find', 'out', 'immediately', 'Will', 'wife', 'are', 'divorcing', 'daughter', 'night', 'curious', 'how', 'parents', 'got', 'together', 'so', 'Will', 'story', 'three', 'women', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'mother', 'Maya', 'settled', 'bed', 'love', 'story', 'mystery', 'Will', 'tale', 'love', 'life', 'loss', 'Will', 'relationships', 'Emily', 'Summer', 'April', 'Will', 'Emily', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'sweethearts', 'who', 'grew', 'apart', 'when', 'Will', 'aspirations', 'become', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'wedged', 'Summer', 'beautiful', 'journalist', 'who', 'own', 'life', 'goals', 'waged', 'war', 'love', 'affair', 'Will', 'April', 'spunky', 'idealist', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'too', 'much', 'friend', 'ever', 'become', 'anything', 'more.Will', 'story', 'interesting', 'engrossing', 'beautiful', 'story', 'unfolding', 'off', 'screen', 'father', 'daughter', 'touched', 'deeply', 'Sure', 'main', 'focus', 'may', 'be', 'Will', 'love', 'life', 'are', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'bonding', 'daughter', 'when', 'Will', 'finally', 'Maya', 'happy', 'ending', 'dare', 'hold', 'back', 'tears.', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'may', 'suffer', 'areas', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'script', 'script', 'never', 'feels', 'tired', 'boring', 'always', 'own', 'handicaps', 'create', 'story', 'worth', 'listening', 'worth', 'adoring', 'ending', 'far', 'expected', 'thank', 'lord', 'heaven', 'one', 'entire', 'experience', 'more', 'gratifying', 'especially', 'young', 'Maya', 'understand', 'true', 'meaning', 'happiness.The', 'acting', 'also', 'most', 'part', 'superb', 'Young', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'should', 'add', 'not', 'general', 'cup-of-tea', 'when', 'child', 'acting', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'fascinated', 'Ronan', 'Fanning', 'must', 'say', 'approach', 'Maya', 'was', 'warm', 'endearing', 'three', 'women', 'Will', 'life', 'were', 'handled', 'wonderfully', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'outstanding', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Banks', 'perfectly', 'warm', 'ideal', 'vision', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'safe', 'choice', 'Weisz', 'intoxicating', 'come', 'hither', 'stare', 'mysterious', 'smile', 'Fisher', 'amazing', 'April', 'always', 'keeping', 'audience', 'glued', 'movement', 'so', 'charming', 'sincere', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'head', 'heals', 'love', 'her.I', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Reynolds', 'rather', 'bland', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'really', 'exception', 'co-stars', 'elevate', 'performance', 'drastically.In', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'delightful', 'film', 'wonderful', 'answer', 'back', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'today', 'charming', 'sweet', 'moving', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'time', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'Sure', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'engaging', 'genuine', 'have', 'guaranty', 'father', 'especially', 'one', 'daughters', 'will', 'find', 'heartwarming', 'very', 'last', 'drop']",N/A

I'll agree with the genial part - he's a likable on-screen presence - but he seems not 'bland' but rather someone you can relate to.  [Well, someone you can relate to who also happens to be Mr. Scarlett Johansson off-screen...a fact that seems to fascinate not a small amount of people.]In fact, what I really liked about the film was Reynolds' depiction of his political consultant role.  Unlike many movies of this genre, ""Definitely, Maybe"" really did its homework in terms of showing us what this guy actually did for a living.  Moreover, it showed a very realistic arc of Reynolds' ardor for candidate Bill Clinton followed by a slow descent into disappointment with the President's less than private shortcomings.  Not only does this ring the bell of reality with many people, the sequence is also a meta-narrative of Reynolds' character's personal struggles.

1157191,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B0017JHQPK,Bentley,"[7, 8]","""Once upon a time, before e-mail and cell phones and TV reality shows""- Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) in DEFINITELY MAYBEOnce upon a time we all fell in love and we know and remember how good it felt.  All of our senses were piqued and we thought that this love or even any of our loves would last forever.  For some of us that was true and we were the lucky ones and for others...well let us say that they were not so lucky; but most of them kept looking, hoping to find their soul mate or what they wanted to believe was the ""real thing"".In the sweet romantic comedy DEFINITELY MAYBE,  Albert Brooks has directed and written a winner.  The movie sends a message to children of divorce which is heart felt; yet I don't believe that the movie is necessarily one for children.  Maybe it is one for our grown up children, now adults, or others who may have gone through a divorce in their family and still somehow are trying to cope with the loss.Brooks has quite a few films like BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, WIMBLETON, AND FRENCH KISS.  But this little gem is different and an intelligent study into the history of love (for better or for worse).While watching the film, I wondered how would you ever tell your daughter a historic rendition of your love life or tell her a bit about all of your leading ladies in your life if you were a father of a  10 year old girl (Maya Hayes) who in this movie is played by Abigail Breslin . This is exactly what happened. For those of you not familiar with the young Ms. Breslin,  she played a role in the movie LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.When one thinks of the prospect of  relating such a history, the viewer has to feel a bit of trepidation for Will Hayes because along with this narrative will be revealed all of the bewildering aspects of life which are part of being in love.  And  you have to love our tormented father, because he tells the story in such a way so as not to destroy his daughter's belief in the power of love, and not to deprive her of a happy ending. He does not want her not to believe that there is a soul mate out there or at least even a not so perfect spouse who is in every sense still just right for her.One thing Will tried to not  do was to shatter her dreams by relating all of the ugly truths that are part of life; but some of those fell out along the way.  One of Maya's revelations was when she said, ""Dad, I can't believe you smoked, you drank, and you were a slut.""  Some of us might think that this  is quite the language for a nice 10-year-old girl and some might think it was funny.  But this sort of language and some of the other innuendoes may make this not a film for your children; but you have to be the judge.There is a lot of flashback in the movie and one has to believe that these present day characters were about 10 - 15 years younger at the time.  It is a stretch but when you watch a movie you are always drawn into this kind of make believe so you are easily strung along.  Will (Ryan Reynolds) goes though his litany of failed or uncompleted loves and one has to wonder how he managed to afford the tokens of love which he produced.  It is all in good fun and in the right spirit and is an intelligent probing of why folks fall in love and with whom and at what time in their lives.Emily, Summer, April or any other names that mark the passages of love in one's life would be appropriate for all of us; and these names could be interchanged with male ones if a woman and the story would still be anyone's story.  Any one of us could probably tell similar tales which we have buried somewhere deep in our psyche; what makes this movie nice is that it puts it all out there for you to be able to let go of what might have been and seize the moment of what is.Like our protagonist says, "" Once upon a time.....Recommend: B-Bentley/2008",4,Once Upon a Time.....,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,3826,"['Once', 'time', 'e-mail', 'cell', 'phones', 'TV', 'reality', 'shows', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'DEFINITELY', 'MAYBEOnce', 'time', 'fell', 'love', 'know', 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'felt', 'senses', 'were', 'piqued', 'thought', 'love', 'even', 'loves', 'would', 'last', 'forever', 'was', 'true', 'were', 'lucky', 'ones', 'others', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'most', 'kept', 'looking', 'hoping', 'find', 'soul', 'mate', 'what', 'wanted', 'believe', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'DEFINITELY', 'MAYBE', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'directed', 'written', 'winner', 'movie', 'message', 'children', 'divorce', 'heart', 'felt', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'one', 'children', 'Maybe', 'one', 'grown', 'up', 'children', 'now', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'divorce', 'family', 'still', 'somehow', 'are', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss.Brooks', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'BRIDGET', 'JONES', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'REASON', 'WIMBLETON', 'AND', 'FRENCH', 'KISS', 'little', 'gem', 'different', 'intelligent', 'study', 'history', 'love', 'better', 'worse', 'watching', 'film', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'ever', 'tell', 'daughter', 'historic', 'rendition', 'love', 'life', 'tell', 'bit', 'leading', 'ladies', 'life', 'were', 'father', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Maya', 'Hayes', 'who', 'movie', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'familiar', 'young', 'Ms.', 'Breslin', 'played', 'role', 'movie', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE.When', 'one', 'prospect', 'relating', 'such', 'history', 'viewer', 'feel', 'bit', 'trepidation', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'along', 'narrative', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'bewildering', 'aspects', 'life', 'are', 'part', 'being', 'love', 'have', 'love', 'tormented', 'father', 'story', 'such', 'way', 'so', 'not', 'destroy', 'daughter', 'belief', 'power', 'love', 'not', 'deprive', 'her', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'want', 'not', 'believe', 'soul', 'mate', 'there', 'least', 'even', 'not', 'so', 'perfect', 'spouse', 'who', 'sense', 'still', 'just', 'right', 'her.One', 'thing', 'Will', 'tried', 'not', 'do', 'was', 'shatter', 'dreams', 'relating', 'ugly', 'truths', 'are', 'part', 'life', 'fell', 'out', 'way', 'One', 'Maya', 'revelations', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'Dad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'smoked', 'drank', 'were', 'slut', 'might', 'think', 'quite', 'language', 'nice', '10-year-old', 'girl', 'might', 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'sort', 'language', 'other', 'innuendoes', 'may', 'make', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'have', 'be', 'judge.There', 'lot', 'flashback', 'movie', 'one', 'believe', 'present', 'day', 'characters', 'were', 'about', '10', '15', 'years', 'younger', 'time', 'stretch', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'always', 'drawn', 'kind', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'easily', 'strung', 'Will', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'litany', 'failed', 'uncompleted', 'loves', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'managed', 'afford', 'tokens', 'love', 'produced', 'all', 'good', 'fun', 'right', 'spirit', 'intelligent', 'probing', 'why', 'folks', 'fall', 'love', 'whom', 'what', 'time', 'lives.Emily', 'Summer', 'April', 'other', 'names', 'mark', 'passages', 'love', 'one', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'names', 'could', 'be', 'interchanged', 'male', 'ones', 'woman', 'story', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'anyone', 'story', 'one', 'could', 'probably', 'tell', 'similar', 'tales', 'have', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'psyche', 'what', 'movie', 'nice', 'there', 'be', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'seize', 'moment', 'what', 'protagonist', 'Once', 'time', '..Recommend', 'B-Bentley/2008']",N/A

More than one woman has caught the attention of Will Hayes and since he has cleverly changed the names of the women in his confessional account May has to wait and see which one turns out to be her Mom. As she listens intently she can only hope that there will be a happy ending to look forward to.While the mere presence of Ryan Reynolds in the cast of any film is always a set in the right direction he is not the only standout in this production. The cast includes another personal favorite, Kevin Kline, along with numerous talented and attractive performers. With so talented a cast complimented by a superior script and some sharp and clever dialogue you have a can't miss evening of viewing ahead.",4,"""Do You Know What You Want?"" ~ Love, Life Rehab And Happy Endings",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,1191,"['release', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'delightful', 'charming', 'tale', 'tailor', 'made', 'boyish', 'wit', 'vulnerability', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'role', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'soon', 'be', 'divorced', 'Father', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Maya', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', '.Little', 'Maya', 'talks', 'Dad', 'sharing', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'Mother', 'one', 'evening', 'telling', 'story', 'storyline', 'unfolds.Maya', 'soon', 'discovers', 'life', 'romance', 'can', 'be', 'complicated', 'matter', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'cyclic', 'unpredictable', 'More', 'one', 'woman', 'caught', 'attention', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'cleverly', 'changed', 'names', 'women', 'confessional', 'account', 'May', 'wait', 'see', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'Mom', 'intently', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'look', 'forward', 'mere', 'presence', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'cast', 'film', 'always', 'set', 'right', 'direction', 'not', 'only', 'standout', 'production', 'cast', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'numerous', 'talented', 'attractive', 'performers', 'so', 'talented', 'cast', 'complimented', 'superior', 'script', 'sharp', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'evening', 'viewing', 'ahead']",N/A
1157195,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B0017JHQPK,Brian Reaves,"[92, 97]","The concept here is great: on the eve of his divorce, a father tells his daughter the story of how he fell in love with her mother by changing names so she has to guess who she is in the story. What's so amazing is how they were able to pull off this story with three female leads all interacting with the same man, and yet somehow make us cheer each of them on in their own way. Ryan Reynolds is great in the lead, easily flowing from the caring father of the present to the stricken college student of the past and beyond. As the story unfolds, you'll meet Emily, April, and Summer--three women who will have a dramatic impact on his life in various ways.There are some genuinely funny moments in this film, and I honestly can say I never really got bored at any point. It was like watching three romances unfolds and ultimately fall apart for different reasons. No doubt you will find yourself choosing a favorite, and like Maya (the daughter), you'll be hoping your favorite will turn out to be her mother. Be prepared to be surprised though.As the movie drew closer to the end, I honestly thought I was going to be disappointed in how it ended. But the movie managed to end perfectly. Reynolds is a great actor who can be flippant and cocky one moment, then broken-hearted and in love during the next. Isla Fisher does a great job as April, the outgoing copy girl who works with him during the Bill Clinton campaign.If you're looking for a great romantic movie, this is the one.",5,Who will win in the end?,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,1483,"['concept', 'here', 'great', 'eve', 'divorce', 'father', 'daughter', 'story', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'mother', 'changing', 'names', 'so', 'guess', 'who', 'story', 'What', 'so', 'amazing', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'story', 'three', 'female', 'interacting', 'same', 'man', 'yet', 'somehow', 'make', 'cheer', 'own', 'way', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'great', 'lead', 'easily', 'flowing', 'caring', 'father', 'present', 'stricken', 'college', 'student', 'past', 'story', 'unfolds', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'Emily', 'April', 'Summer', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'life', 'various', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'honestly', 'can', 'say', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'bored', 'point', 'was', 'watching', 'three', 'romances', 'unfolds', 'ultimately', 'fall', 'apart', 'different', 'reasons', 'doubt', 'will', 'find', 'choosing', 'favorite', 'Maya', 'daughter', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hoping', 'favorite', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'mother', 'Be', 'prepared', 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'drew', 'closer', 'end', 'honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'ended', 'movie', 'managed', 'end', 'perfectly', 'Reynolds', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'flippant', 'cocky', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'broken-hearted', 'love', 'next', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'great', 'job', 'April', 'outgoing', 'copy', 'girl', 'who', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'campaign.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'romantic', 'movie', 'one']",N/A

1157200,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0017JHQPK,Chris Pandolfi,"[26, 31]","Romantic comedies often focus on the chemistry between adults, but rarely do they focus on the chemistry between an adult and a child. Such chemistry shines in ""Definitely, Maybe,"" which sees Ryan Reynolds and Abigail Breslin playing one of the most charming father/daughter duos of recent memory. They just work well, and this is despite the fact that they're not given much screen time together. I say this because most of the film takes place before her character was born, recalling the events that led to the Reynolds character meeting her mother. This idea is heartwarming, if a little contrived; then again, I don't think a romantic comedy could even exist without being contrived, seeing as they never represent reality. After suffering through the dreadful ""27 Dresses,"" films like ""Definitely, Maybe"" prove that such films can still be entertaining.It all begins when soon-to-be-divorced Will Hayes (Reynolds) picks up his daughter, Maya (Breslin) from her school, which is swarming with parents outraged over the day's display of sex education. Maya challenges Will with a series of embarrassing questions, and on their return home, she wants him to tell her the story of how he and her mother met. He initially refuses, mostly because his is a very complicated story; he had not one but three serious girlfriends, and all of them had important parts to play. Will eventually decides to tell Maya the story, but only on the condition that he's allowed to change the names of the girlfriends. Maya actually likes this, because it will give her the chance to guess which woman became her mother.Thus begins the story proper, which begins in Wisconsin in 1992. Will is a college student who dreams of becoming a politician, and he wants to follow this dream by moving to New York and joining Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign. This doesn't mesh with the plans of his college sweetheart, whose name has been changed to Emily (Elizabeth Banks). Emily says she's worried that New York will change Will into something he's not; Will seems to understand that she's really scared of him succeeding and being too good for her, and because of that, he promises that their love will remain. Things obviously take a complicated turn when he arrives in New York, which for him is not only a blizzard of political activity, but also a hotbed of social development.Here enters a woman named April (Isla Fisher), who doesn't consider herself a Democrat, a Republican, or even an Independent--political affiliations mean nothing to her because it means choosing a side, and choosing a side is unimportant in the grand scheme of things. There's an immediate connection between her and Will, although neither one is ready to admit that it will lead to something more than friendship. This is especially true since Will is ready to propose to Emily, who's finally found time to visit New York. I won't say whether or not he goes through with it, nor will I reveal what Emily says to him; what I will say is that one of Emily's old college friends enters the picture and complicates things further.This friend is Summer Hartley (Rachel Weisz), a willful young woman aspiring to be journalist. She's introduced to Will through Emily's diary, which she wanted Summer to have as a gift (it describes some pretty naughty stuff, which is probably why Will reads it without permission). Despite the fact that she's sleeping with her thesis director--a pompous writer named Hampton Roth (Kevin Kline)--she quickly charms her way into Will's life, and he seems more than happy let her. At least, he does at first; his co-ownership of a political advertising agency is jeopardized when her published article paints a damning picture of the man he's endorsing as Governor. He quickly begins to rethink his situation, forcing him to wonder if the right woman is out there or if she even exists. Of course, we know right from the start that she does, so it's only a matter of Maya figuring everything out: Is her mother April, Emily, or Summer?The final third of ""Definitely, Maybe"" is the weakest part, relying too heavily on the routine material romantic comedies are notorious for. This isn't to say that the film derails; it stays right on track all throughout, and it doesn't lose itself to an overabundance of sappy dialogue or implausible twists of fate. It's not free of them, of course, but at least they're used sparingly and at levels that are tolerable. And there's no denying that the main characters are engaging, especially Maya, who's more open to lines of communication than her father initially is. Watching them, I never once questioned or even analyzed their love for each other--I was immediately taken by it, and I continued to believe it even after the film ended.These characters alone make this film worthwhile, so much so that we can forgive many of the more formulaic aspects; let's be vague and say that the final sequence is overwhelmingly predictable, a clich&eacute; taken from a deep pool of romantic comedy clich&eacute;s. But I didn't mind this time because the story could actually support such a sequence; this is essentially a father/daughter story, and as such, it's appropriate--maybe even necessary--that the daughter would want the father to find the happiness he's been longing for (which obviously has nothing to do with political aspirations). Despite being flawed and generally harmless, ""Definitely, Maybe"" is still one of the better romantic comedies. I smiled more often, I laughed longer, and I was touched at a deeper level.",4,Are You My Mother?,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,5560,"['Romantic', 'comedies', 'often', 'focus', 'chemistry', 'adults',

1157210,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0017JHQPK,Danielle Turchiano,"[5, 6]","Adam Brooks' Definitely, Maybe starring Ryan Reynolds is the kind of fairytale that could only possibly work in today's post-millenium, cynical times.  Will Hayes (Reynolds) is sweet, slightly overly dramatic speech writer and divorced dad to Maya (Abigail Breslin).  The film opens with his voice over, right away setting up that this is not your typical romantic comedy.  After picking up his daughter from school and learning her class got a lesson in sexual education that day, Maya is hell bent to find out how her father came to fall in love with her mother, a topic all the more heated now that they are no longer together.  Will starts his story way back in the early nineties, preparing his daughter to hear about the three women he had serious relationships with and leaving it up to her to figure out which one is her mother.  Though it is painfully obvious which woman is in fact Maya's mother from the very first moment after we've met all three, Definitely, Maybe is just as sweet (if at times just as slightly overly dramatic) as its protagonist, offering reminiscence of some simpler times to cushion the harsh blow of the ever-changing world around both father and daughter.Definitely, Maybe is in many ways a love letter: first to the women Will has left (or who left Will) but also to the city that surrounds him, New York.  Brooks, along with his Cinematographer, Florian Ballhaus, are fond of long tracking shots of the characters moving through the city streets, lingering on the architecture, foliage, and background players to exhibit that it is all important to this man's story.  The city is as much involved as any of the women; in fact, the city could be considered Will's fourth love.  It is the kind of New York that only exists in movies, from the pleasing fall color palette to how he manages to cross paths time and again with the same people, giving it an almost magical, ethereal quality and undoubtedly being used as a device to further drive home Brooks' modern-day fairytale imagery.Unfortunately, much of the dialogue does feel contrived, and the only reason it is saved is due to the phenomenal casting.  Elizabeth Banks, as Emily, Will's college girlfriend, perhaps has the worst of it, but her down-to-Earth and sunny demeanor deliver the words at times a bit sheepish but never cartoonish.  Rachel Weisz as Summer, the free spirited, precocious writer, makes herself a bit more mysterious and in turn creates another dimension to her character just through subtle eyework and body language while interacting with Reynolds.  Isla Fisher as April, the somewhat flakey but always hopeful doe-eyed ing&eacute;nue, easily flits back and forth between serious and goofy, warming the audience to her immediately.  Since the just-under-two-hour course of Definitely, Maybe must include the arc of three relationships, some are better developed than others, which only makes it all the easier to determine just exactly how the story will end.  Ironically, though the audience is often one step ahead of Will (and therefore one step ahead of the film itself), there is never a dull moment; anticipation runs high as you find yourself easily caught up in this messy world, rooting for the young man to finally come to his senses both in the past and the present.Since the story is mostly Will's, Reynolds is really given a chance to shine as a leading man, for the first time in a non-genre feature film.  He eagerly accepts the challenge and gives every scene his all, making his performance the biggest joy to watch of them all. And his love life was just so complicated that it takes the majority of the film to explain, unfortunately relegating Breslin to a supporting player. She doesn't get to offer much more than some spunky retorts and overly enthusiastic voiceover.  The few scenes she shares with Reynolds, she of course steals, though for the most part, those are moments already seen just by viewing the trailer.  What is nice, though, is how she does manage to pop up right before you've completely forgotten she is the reason for this diatribe, which leaves the impression that throughout everything, she is always on her father's mind, and if nothing else, that is a sweet sentiment with which to be left.For some reason, watching Definitely, Maybe in anamorphic widescreen on the DVD make the images look compressed, as if the original was just over 2.35:1 and therefore had to be refigured for at-home systems.  The result is not completely distracting, but to a trained eye, it is noticeable.  However, the rest of the DVD offers features great enough to make up for any visual quality shortcomings: the audio commentary with Brooks and Reynolds sounds like two buddies hanging out and having a good time, which is welcoming, though not necessarily insightful.  Of course there are the obligatory deleted scenes, as well as two featurettes: ""Creating a Romance,"" and ""The Changing Times of Definitely, Maybe,"" both of which are exactly what they sound like.  ""Creating a Romance"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the storytelling devices used to set apart Will's three relationships.  Through interviews, the audience is given a little back story on each character, explaining just how she is different from the next.  In ""The Changing Times of Definitely, Maybe,"" we are taken behind-the-scenes of the production design and given a crash course in how they transformed Will's world through the decades.  This is a chuckle-worthy piece, mostly because of the nostalgia it invokes, especially when considering the music choices within the film.A gag reel would have been a nice inclusion, as well, but regardless, though at-home audiences may take an indecisive cue from Definitely, Maybe's title and debate with themselves over whether or not to pick this one up on DVD, the verdict should definitely lean toward the former and not the latter.",4,Definitely Worth The Cost of a Rental,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,5892,"['Adam', 'Brooks', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds',

1157212,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,B0017JHQPK,David A. Bede,"[3, 6]","Hearing ""Definitely Maybe"" billed as ""the first Generation X midlife crisis movie"" was almost enough for me to make a point of not seeing it. Having now seen it anyway, I'll give credit where it's due for an enjoyable story...but I was right to be suspicious about the Generation X credentials.  Will has graduated from Wisconsin sometime shortly before 1992, but he doesn't know who Kurt Cobain is.  He graduated first in his class, but he's apparently been hanging around Madison without a lot to do for some time.  He's hired to work on the Clinton campaign in New York at a point when anybody on Clinton's payroll probably would have been sent to New Hampshire.  He's surprised to discover that some people of his generation are apathetic and disinterested in politics.  Five years later, Clinton's ""that woman"" speech somehow happens a year earlier than it really did.  A decade after that, we're supposed to believe that an entire school's worth of Manhattan parents are up in arms over a sex education lesson.  Do the writers even know anybody who came of age in the 90s?!For all that, the story itself is pretty engaging.  ""From the makers of 'Love Actually' and 'Notting Hill'..."" and, like both those movies, it's sappy but clever and enjoyable in its way.  Not to mention that the male lead sounds exactly like a Hugh Grant role, except that he had to be American this time around.  It kept my attention for most of the ride and I was appropriately curious as to who was going to turn out to be Maya's mother.  (I guessed correctly, but only through process of elimination - rather than the likeliest candidate, it was the least unlikely candidate.)It's probably not fair to expect too much depth from a romantic comedy, and as they go, this one delivers pretty well.  The problem is, while I did want to see who the mystery mother was and how all four leads ended up, none of them were especially convincing.  The three female leads, while also uneven, are somewhat better developed than Will.  I especially liked April, the most well-rounded of the four adult characters and the only one I could bring myself to root for.  Will and his other two love-interests are somewhat inconsistently drawn and almost seem destined for failure.  One of the two girlfriends, for example, appears to remove herself from contention early on in a way that is utterly out of character relative to what we've seen of her so far.  But that's okay, because the viewer knows Will had it coming, even if she doesn't.  (Admittedly, dysfunctional relationships are the point of the movie in a way, since it's about divorce.)  Kevin Kline gives the strongest performance as the movie's most major minor character, but he also had the best-developed personality to work with.The movie's big emotional twist is, at least, both convincing and beautifully executed.  (Without giving away too much, I think it's safe to reveal here that I am not referring to the mother's identity.)  I think the ending tarnishes that moment a bit and draws the story to a too-neatly wrapped ending...but then, it is a romantic comedy.  And a pretty good one overall.",3,"Smart dialogue, not so smart characters",1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,3133,"['Hearing', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'billed', 'first', 'Generation', 'X', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'point', 'not', 'seeing', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'was', 'right', 'be', 'suspicious', 'Generation', 'X', 'credentials', 'Will', 'graduated', 'Wisconsin', 'sometime', 'shortly', '1992', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'graduated', 'first', 'class', 'apparently', 'been', 'hanging', 'around', 'Madison', 'lot', 'do', 'time', 'hired', 'work', 'Clinton', 'campaign', 'New', 'York', 'point', 'when', 'anybody', 'Clinton', 'payroll', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'surprised', 'discover', 'people', 'generation', 'are', 'apathetic', 'disinterested', 'politics', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'Clinton', 'woman', 'speech', 'somehow', 'year', 'earlier', 'really', 'did', 'A', 'decade', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'entire', 'school', 'worth', 'Manhattan', 'parents', 'are', 'up', 'arms', 'sex', 'education', 'lesson', 'Do', 'writers', 'even', 'know', 'anybody', 'who', 'came', 'age', '90s', 'story', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'makers', ""'Love"", 'Actually', ""'Notting"", 'Hill', 'movies', 'sappy', 'clever', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'Not', 'mention', 'male', 'lead', 'exactly', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'role', 'had', 'be', 'American', 'time', 'around', 'kept', 'attention', 'most', 'ride', 'was', 'appropriately', 'curious', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Maya', 'mother', 'guessed', 'correctly', 'only', 'process', 'elimination', 'rather', 'likeliest', 'candidate', 'was', 'least', 'unlikely', 'candidate', 'probably', 'not', 'fair', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'well', 'problem', 'did', 'want', 'see', 'who', 'mystery', 'mother', 'was', 'how', 'four', 'leads', 'ended', 'up', 'none', 'were', 'especially', 'convincing', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'also', 'uneven', 'are', 'somewhat', 'better', 'developed', 'Will', 'especially', 'liked', 'April', 'most', 'well-rounded', 'four', 'adult', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'bring', 'root', 'Will', 'other', 'two', 'love-interests', 'are', 'somewhat', 'inconsistently', 'drawn', 'almost', 'seem', 'destined', 'failure', 'One', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'example', 'remove', 'contention', 'early', 'way', 'utterly', 'character', 'relative', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'okay', 'viewer', 'knows', 'Will', 'had', 'coming', 'even', ""n't"", 'Admittedly', 'dysfunctional', 'relationships', 'are', 'point', 'movie', 'way', 'divorce', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'strongest', 'performance', 'movie', 'most', 'major', 'minor', 'character', 'also', 'had', 'best-developed', 'personality', 'work', 'with.The', 'movie', 'big', 'emotional', 'twist', 'least', 'convincing', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'safe', 'reveal', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'referring', 'mother', 'identity', 'think', 'ending', 'tarnishes', 'moment', 'bit', 'story', 'too-neatly', 'wrapped', 'ending', 'then', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'overall']",N/A

The start of Will's tale is from just before his big life jump off point just after college, where he moved to NYC to work on the 92 Clinton campaign.The story moves along using the big relationship points of Will's 3 biggest girl friend relationships. Starting with his college sweetheart, Emily, to his coworker April and intellectual partner Summer.

Once Maya finally discovers who her mother is in the story, it takes a fast paced turn back to the state of Will's current love life.

1157223,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0017JHQPK,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 5]","Coming across as a breezy cross between Tom Hanks and Will Ferrell, Ryan Reynolds (Just Friends) is a likeable enough presence in this 2008 romantic comedy, but he simply lacks enough gravitas to be the compelling core of this story. While he doesn't suffer from the same degree of adolescent smugness plaguing Ashton Kutcher, Reynolds - frankly too young for this role - has one of those pliable personalities that fail to leave an indelible mark on the screen, which is too bad since the role requires someone who can ground the story at the same time he can elevate those around him. Fortunately, director/writer Adam Brooks doesn't leave his leading man high and dry since he cast three solid actresses as his various love interests, as well as the omnipresent Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) as his doting daughter.The time-flipping plot revolves around a bedtime story that soon-to-be-divorced political consultant Will Hayes tells his ten-year-old daughter Maya. Unaware of her parents' lives before their marriage, Maya wants to hear about their romance with an interest in sparking memories that will hopefully make him change his mind about the divorce. Since two other women play pivotal roles in his past, Will suddenly decides to change the names of all the people in his account, thus leaving Maya to guess which one is her mother. It's a charming gimmick but a gimmick nonetheless, which gives rise to the inevitable flashbacks. Surprisingly, this is where the film exceeds my expectations as it begins with Will leaving behind college sweetheart Emily in Wisconsin to work on Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Brooks smartly draws parallels between the young idealist in Will and the imperfect public hero that Clinton became. In fact, this may be the first rom-com with a protagonist mirroring the emotional compromises felt during the Clinton years.But make no mistake that this is a rom-com that can't wait to introduce romantic complications. First, there is Emily's friend and former lover Summer, an ambitious journalist already in a relationship with her thesis advisor Hampton Roth, a renowned and quite arrogant author. Her affection, however, comes at a price when it becomes a conflict of interest for Will. Then there's April, an underachieving free-spirit who runs the copier at the campaign office. Timing is the chief problem connecting these two as April shows more interest in friendship initially, while Will is inevitably unavailable whenever they consider connecting. Needless to say, things sort themselves out, but Brooks provides enough plot curves to make it all reasonably enjoyable. Elizabeth Banks - the horned-up bookstore clerk inThe 40-Year-Old Virginand soon to be Laura Bush in Oliver Stone's ""W"" - has the smallest key role as Emily, but she handles it serviceably. Although she seems to be slumming here, Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener) effortlessly brings her confident allure to Summer.But it's Isla Fisher - the clingy bridesmaid inWedding Crashers- who walks away with the picture in a smart, sexy and often touching performance as April. Hers is the most developed character of the three women, and she takes full advantage. Breslin is relegated to a plot device as Maya, but she manages to overcome the bratty nature of her character. In a case of petty larceny in a youthful pool, a ham-fisted Kevin Kline steals his few scenes as Roth. The 2008 DVD offers several extras with Brooks and Reynolds offering a sometimes quite amusing commentary track. There are a couple of shorts - a disposable fluff piece called ""Creating a Romance"" and a much funnier featurette, ""The Changing Times of Definitely, Maybe"" that discusses fads and trends in the 1990's. There are also a handful of deleted scenes worth watching once to fill in a bit more context for the characters.",3,A Clintonesque Rom-com?...Maybe More Than Definitely,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,3838,"['Coming', 'breezy', 'cross', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Just', 'Friends', 'likeable', 'enough', 'presence', '2008', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'simply', 'enough', 'gravitas', 'be', 'compelling', 'core', 'story', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'same', 'degree', 'adolescent', 'smugness', 'plaguing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Reynolds', 'frankly', 'too', 'young', 'role', 'one', 'pliable', 'personalities', 'fail', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'screen', 'too', 'bad', 'role', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'ground', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'elevate', 'Fortunately', 'director/writer', 'Adam', 'Brooks', ""n't"", 'leave', 'leading', 'man', 'high', 'dry', 'cast', 'three', 'solid', 'actresses', 'various', 'love', 'interests', 'as', 'well', 'omnipresent', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'doting', 'daughter.The', 'time-flipping', 'plot', 'revolves', 'bedtime', 'story', 'soon-to-be-divorced', 'political', 'consultant', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'ten-year-old', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'Unaware', 'parents', 'lives', 'marriage', 'Maya', 'hear', 'romance', 'interest', 'sparking', 'memories', 'will', 'hopefully', 'make', 'change', 'mind', 'divorce', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'play', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'past', 'Will', 'suddenly', 'change', 'names', 'people', 'account', 'thus', 'leaving', 'Maya', 'guess', 'one', 'mother', 'charming', 'gimmick', 'gimmick', 'nonetheless', 'rise', 'inevitable', 'flashbacks', 'Surprisingly', 'where', 'film', 'exceeds', 'expectations', 'Will', 'leaving', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'Emily', 'Wisconsin', 'work', 'Clinton', '1992', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'Brooks', 'smartly', 'parallels', 'young', 'idealist', 'Will', 'imperfect', 'public', 'hero', 'Clinton', 'became', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'rom-com', 'protagonist', 'mirroring', 'emotional', 'compromises', 'felt', 'Clinton', 'years.But', 'make', 'mistake', 'rom-com', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'introduce', 'romantic', 'complications', 'First', 'Emily', 'friend', 'former', 'lover', 'Summer', 'ambitious', 'journalist', 'already', 'relationship', 'thesis', 'advisor', 'Hampton', 'Roth', 'renowned', 'quite', 'arrogant', 'author', 'affection', 'however', 'price', 'when', 'conflict', 'interest', 'Will', 'Then', 'April', 'underachieving', 'free-spirit', 'who', 'copier', 'campaign', 'office', 'Timing', 'chief', 'problem', 'connecting', 'two', 'April', 'more', 'interest', 'friendship', 'initially', 'Will', 'inevitably', 'unavailable', 'whenever', 'consider', 'connecting', 'Needless', 'say', 'things', 'sort', 'out', 'Brooks', 'enough', 'plot', 'curves', 'make', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'horned-up', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'inThe', '40-Year-Old', 'Virginand', 'soon', 'be', 'Laura', 'Bush', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'W', 'smallest', 'key', 'role', 'Emily', 'serviceably', 'be', 'slumming', 'here', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'effortlessly', 'confident', 'allure', 'Summer.But', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'clingy', 'bridesmaid', 'inWedding', 'Crashers-', 'who', 'away', 'picture', 'smart', 'sexy', 'often', 'touching', 'performance', 'April', 'Hers', 'most', 'developed', 'character', 'three', 'women', 'full', 'advantage', 'Breslin', 'relegated', 'plot', 'device', 'Maya', 'overcome', 'bratty', 'nature', 'character', 'case', 'petty', 'larceny', 'youthful', 'pool', 'ham-fisted', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'few', 'scenes', 'Roth', '2008', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'Brooks', 'Reynolds', 'offering', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'amusing', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'couple', 'shorts', 'disposable', 'fluff', 'piece', 'called', 'Creating', 'Romance', 'much', 'funnier', 'featurette', 'Changing', 'Times', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'fads', 'trends', '1990', 'are', 'also', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'watching', 'once', 'fill', 'bit', 'more', 'context', 'characters']",N/A

While I wouldn't say it's a romantic comedy, it is a romance movie that, like life, is interspersed with happiness and sadness, laughs and cries and also a bit of mystery.Ryan Reynolds stars as William Hayes, a man who, at the film's beginning, receives divorce papers to sign just before picking up his young daughter from a NYC school.  Long story short, his daughter wants to know why he's getting divorced and, as he's putting her to bed, demands that he tell her the story of how he and her mother (i.e. his soon-to-be ex-wife) met.  He agrees, but says he'll change the names of the women in the story so that she won't know who her mother is (and we won't either).  About 2/3 of the movie takes place as a flashback, with William recounting his involvement with three different women: his college girlfriend; the girlfriend's former roommate, now in NYC; and a copy girl at a campaign HQ for the 1992 Clinton campaign.William's relationships with these women, however, are interwoven, such that the viewer is never quite sure which woman William will wind up with.

It is no accident that the only great writer who appears in any of Plato's Dialogues is Aristophanes [in the Symposion].  Even the ancient Greeks understood this simple fact- that comedy can teach the deeper truths about humanity far better than drama.  This comedy goes far beyond the usual cheap Hollywood formula to truly explore what happens as people fall into and out of love- and perhaps how real love begins. This is not about winning or losing at love- rather it is about how our character is what makes love possible- or impossible.

In DEFINITELY, MAYBE it's this softer, more restrained persona which we're treated to, and Ryan Reynolds comes across as engaging and convincing, not only as a romantic lead, but also as a caring father. The guy can act. Not that I ever want him to quit making superhero films or raunchy comedies. He rocks those genres also.DEFINITELY, MAYBE is a romantic whodunit, and although the movie really makes no bones about whom Reynolds' character should end up with, it's not quite a given that that's who lands in his arms by closing creds. Reynolds plays Will Hayes, a thirty-something ad exec whose pre-teen daughter Maya had just gone thru sex ed class and, consequentially, is feeling a bit stressed out. Then there's also Will's impending divorce from Maya's mom. The fallout is that Maya is needing some sort of reassurance and so demands that her dad tell her the story of how he and her mom met. Will agrees but with a caveat: that certain names will be altered and other embellishments thrown in. He then begins to tell the story of the three loves of his life, as he hearkens back to 1992, an era ""before e-mails and cell phones and reality television shows.""Color me sappy, but I really liked this movie. Ryan Reynolds is very good, as mentioned, but the entire cast brings it. Thing is, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz, and Isla Fisher are all marvelous, and I like that not one of their characters is an obvious wrong choice. Whether it's the wholesome girl next door (Banks), the sexy uninhibited journalist (Weisz), or the lost, quirky and endearing best friend (Fisher) - hell, in any other movie, any one of these girls would shine as the main love interest. And, thru the years, they each stroll in and out of Will Hayes's life often enough - and the story offers up enough romantic red herrings - that you never quite know which girl will stick. But I've got my favorite. As wonderful as Banks and Weisz are (and they both really are wonderful), Isla Fisher ends up stealing the show. Awesome performance.Not to forget, Ryan Reynolds and Abigail Breslin demonstrate great chemistry and rhythm in their interactions. They're pretty believable as father and daughter, with Abigail's character wise beyond her years and yet, thankfully, not coming off as too, too precious.DEFINITELY, MAYBE is one of those films I somehow missed out on during its theatrical run. I finally caught it on DVD and I watched it with a bunch of friends, and it's saying something that the girls in the room each had their favorite actress picked out for Will Hayes, and they're not all the same actress. I like that this movie isn't cloying or goes overboard playing for laughs. The humor rises naturally from the story and from Reynold's occasional one-liners. More, this film carries emotional resonance, and that's credit to the cast and to a screenplay that lays out strong character arcs, nice plot twists and turns, and, as the 10-year-old Maya declares, ""a love story mystery."" And, as we learn and as the little girl eventually points out, maybe part of the problem all along is that Will Hayes needed to do some growing up.Whether you liked Bill Clinton or not, the man figures in this film in a roundabout way, since most of the story takes place in the '90s and since Will Hayes, way back, aspired to political ambitions and launched his career by working on the Clinton campaign. I guess if there were jokes that fell flat, they would have to be all those tired callbacks on Clinton, Gennifer Flowers, Lewinski, and on what the definition of ""is"" is. I still remember the French laughing themselves silly over all this stuff.On the bright side, Rachel Weisz gets a chance to sing ""I've Got A Crush On You."" She does this great. And if you're looking for even more culture, Jane Eyre figures in the plot somewhere.This DVD has okay special features: audio commentary with Ryan Reynolds and Director Adam Brooks; ""Creating a Romance"" - the Making Of segment, of which high points (for me, anyway) are the interview snippets with my new crush Isla Fisher (12 minutes); 4 deleted scenes, meh (5:41 minutes); and ""The Changing Times of DEFINITELY, MAYBE"" - a featurette exploring the film's production design which tried to stay consistent thru the course of the story with the passing years and the respective fads and fashions (5 minutes long, and with a quote from Ryan Reynolds: ""Fortunately, I was alive for all of these periods, so, uh, I kinda had a point of reference..."").",4,"Heck, I'll take all three women

""Definitely, Maybe"" is not so much dark (though it is, a little) as slightly modern and off kilter: it gives viewers some light at the end of the tunnel, and some concluding ""awwwwww"" warm fuzzies, but not necessarily from the directions you're expecting these things.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course.Looking at things with a more critical eye, the movie possibly suffers a little from too many characters, and a lack of major rom-com stars to play them.  I expect that it would have simply been too expensive to have four major stars play the central three women/one guy characters (they already had to pay Abigail Breslin and Kevin Kline, after all).

Will is hesitant, but at his daughter's insistence he agrees to tell her ""the story"" -- but he's changing the names, and she'll just have to figure out for herself which of the three women in his earlier life turns out to be her Mom. The story begins at the University of Wisconsin in the summer of 1992, where Will has a steady girlfriend named Emily (Elizabeth Banks). Then it jumps with him to the presidential campaign in New York City, in which Will is a Clinton volunteer, and where he meets April, the ""coffee girl"" (Isla Fisher, also new to me). Girl no. 3 is Summer (Rachel Weisz), a slightly strange, possibly bisexual friend of Emily's. There's a lot of funny, ironic dialogue, a number of ""smile"" moments, and a very romantic final scene, in which (with Maya's determined nudging) Will finds his way to the girl he should have been with all along. A good way to spend a Friday evening.NOTE: I've seen reviews by apparently ignorant and/or right-wing parents that trashed this film solely because of the ""introduction of sex education"" scene with which it opens -- and which I thought was both very funny and very true.

The line of questioning he is subject to lasts until finally the daughter, played by Abigail Breslin, asks Will how he met her mother -- the woman whose name appeared next to his on the divorce papers he signed that same day. The story, which he reluctantly launches into, chronicles not only his move from the midwest to New York City, but also the few seemingly near misses he had with love. (And from here we need to assume that this young girl is mature well beyond her years, otherwise the story becomes a little ridiculous.)I will admit right away that this movie served two secret purposes for me. Beyond my attempt to be entertained by the overall quality of the film, I was checking up on the movie's two stars. I wanted to see if Ryan Reynolds could leave behind the frat-boy comedic antics and enter a...well, a different role. And I wanted to see if Abigail Breslin was as talented as she was tauted to be after her breakthrough success in the Indie sensation Little Miss Sunshine.Ryan Reynolds has stepped away from comedy before, with movies like Blade Trinity and Smokin' Aces, but I consider those to be transitions, or even Reynolds's metamorphosis, if you will. Neither movie was a comedy, though neither movie, if I may opine, necessarily took itself very seriously. Definitely, Maybe, though a romantic comedy, is intended for a more serious audience. I think Ryan Reynolds has good comedic timing and I'm glad he was able to bring it to this part. I thought he was successful, not only as a single father, but also as the ""hopeless romantic with an indominable spirit.""And if we are able to forgive our young starlett for having a more mature understanding of interpersonal relationships than 98% of the people on the planet, I would like to applaud Ms. Breslin as well. Her ability to ask mature questions while she maintains her childhood innocence is impressive. She warms up to the camera and you feel comfortable giving her your attention until the credits roll. She was both cute and funny as she follows her dad on the journey through his quest for love. Little Miss Sunshine introduced Abigail Breslin, but Definitely, Maybe shows her real talent.My thanks also to Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz, Isla Fisher and Kevin Kline for what each of them brought to the film.I thought the casting and acting were very good; I thought everyone played their part perfectly. Yes, it was a little High Fidelity-esque as it recounted relationships-gone-by, but it was new life in an old mold. It is a romantic comedy that focuses more on the romantic than the comedy, but there are plenty of laughs to be had. So after checking up on Ryan Reynolds and Abigail Breslin I can freely admit that I really enjoyed this movie.",4,A decent RomCom with good performances.,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2892,"['Will', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'daughter', 'up', 'school', 'young', 'children', 'received', 'very', 'colorful', 'lesson', 'sex', 'education', 'line', 'questioning', 'subject', 'lasts', 'finally', 'daughter', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'asks', 'Will', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'woman', 'name', 'appeared', 'next', 'divorce', 'papers', 'signed', 'same', 'day', 'story', 'reluctantly', 'not', 'only', 'move', 'midwest', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'also', 'few', 'seemingly', 'misses', 'had', 'love', 'here', 'need', 'assume', 'young', 'girl', 'mature', 'well', 'years', 'otherwise', 'story', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'will', 'admit', 'right', 'away', 'movie', 'served', 'two', 'secret', 'purposes', 'Beyond', 'attempt', 'be', 'entertained', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'checking', 'up', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'wanted', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'could', 'leave', 'frat-boy', 'comedic', 'antics', 'enter', 'well', 'different', 'role', 'wanted', 'see', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'was', 'as', 'talented', 'was', 'tauted', 'be', 'breakthrough', 'success', 'Indie', 'sensation', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'stepped', 'away', 'comedy', 'movies', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'consider', 'be', 'transitions', 'even', 'Reynolds', 'metamorphosis', 'will', 'movie', 'was', 'comedy', 'movie', 'may', 'opine', 'necessarily', 'took', 'very', 'seriously', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'intended', 'more', 'serious', 'audience', 'think', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'good', 'comedic', 'timing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'successful', 'not', 'only', 'single', 'father', 'also', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'indominable', 'spirit', 'are', 'able', 'forgive', 'young', 'starlett', 'having', 'more', 'mature', 'understanding', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', '98', '%', 'people', 'planet', 'would', 'like', 'applaud', 'Ms.', 'Breslin', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'ask', 'mature', 'questions', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'impressive', 'camera', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'giving', 'attention', 'credits', 'roll', 'was', 'cute', 'funny', 'dad', 'journey', 'quest', 'love', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'introduced', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'real', 'talent.My', 'thanks', 'also', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'what', 'brought', 'film.I', 'thought', 'casting', 'acting', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'everyone', 'played', 'part', 'perfectly', 'Yes', 'was', 'little', 'High', 'Fidelity-esque', 'recounted', 'relationships-gone-by', 'was', 'new', 'life', 'old', 'mold', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'So', 'checking', 'up', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'can', 'freely', 'admit', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie']",N/A

The potential candidates include Emily (Elizabeth Banks), his longtime girlfriend when he lived in Wisconsin; April (Isla Fisher), an apolitical Kurt Cobain and ""Jane Eyre"" freak; and Summer (Rachel Weisz), a magazine writer and friend of Emily.  Thus, after an intro set in the present, the movie turns back the clock to 1992 when Hayes, then an aspiring politician, moved from Wisconsin to New York City to work on  the first Clinton presidential campaign.  It is there that he meets April and Summer (though May and Autumn fail to make an appearance).Although the ""Who's my mommy?"" premise makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the context of the story, ""Definitely, Maybe"" is still a cut or two above your average romantic comedy thanks to a screenplay by director Adam Brooks that generally respects the intelligence of its audience and to an appealing performance by Reynolds who carries the film with his easygoing demeanor and charm.  The actresses all turn in fine performances as well, although Breslin occasionally sets the teeth on edge with her precocity and calculated cuteness (luckily, she's not on screen all that much).

""Definitely Maybe"" is the story Hayes tells his daughter, the bittersweet tale of how he met her mother and brought her into the world without ever becoming the man anybody would want to live with.  On the eve of his divorce, Hayes picks up his daughter from one of those schools relied on by dedicated Manhattanites - and is horrified to learn that his daughter's class has been given sex-Ed.  Already inevitable, Will's duty to tell his precocious Maya the back-story of her own conception has been moved up now that she's learned of ""three-somes"" and that there is no masculine variant for the word ""slut"".The story is comprised of three women - a triptych featuring his college sweetheart (Emily Banks), a free-spirited woman-child who claims to care for nothing (Isla Fisher) and a gifted writer and journalist (Rachel Weiz).  Each of the 3 will offer Will their heart, then wrench his own.  Much of the film presumes that Will is the victim of his own selfishness, but it isn't until the last half hour that actually becomes the case, and he realizes what failures of his own have made him vulnerable to others.  Billed as a romantic comedy, ""Definitely"" has few jokes (most of them are historical - the flick begins in the early 1990's meaning that most of Will's travails will be mirrored by Clinton-era sexual politics and by GW Bush's early 1990's hairdo) or memorable side-characters.  The surprises are few (though the identity of Maya's mom remained a surprise for me).

Indeed, I'm the one in the corner, rolling his eyes and looking at his watch every-so-often, hoping the movie will end prematurely.  I'm just not the person these movies are made for.  The number of romantic comedies I do like can probably be counted on one (...maybe two if I stretched it), and Definitely, Maybe is one of those.The premise is pretty simple.  Ryan Reynolds plays a father named Will to Abigail Breslin's Maya.  Will is in the midst of a divorce, and Maya (who just learned about where babies come from) wants to know the particulars of his relationship with her mother.  So, Will envisions a story that talks about the three major loves of his life but changes their names so that Abigail (and, consequently, the audience) keeps guessing which one is her mother.What follows is reminiscient of When Harry Met Sally...if Harry was involved with three women.  The story Will tells talks about love lost and gained over the course of his young adult life, starting when Clinton was running for presidency and moving to today.  Throughout the years, he continues to run into the free-living April (played by the lovely Isla Fisher), the rascally Summer (played by Rachel Weisz) who is also a reporter, and Will's first real love Emily (played by Elizabeth Banks).The structure of the film enables the film makers to break the traditional romantic comedy struggle and, even when the cliche raises, they are able to hide it better than others.  But, truthfully, the thing that won me over was the humor.  I have become a Ryan Reynolds fan, especially since his role in The Nines, and his comedic timing is perfect for this type of film.  Additionally, Isla Fisher is always enjoyable; I've loved her since Wedding Crashers.Finally, the chemistry, something that is oh-so-important and not always attained, was really good, especially between Reynolds and Abigail as his daughter.  Their relationship was believeable and funny, providing a terrific framing to the story.  Overall, Definitely, Maybe was an enjoyable film that won me over simply based on the humor quotient.

Says the storyline is smart and heartwarming.===This is not your typical romance story by a long shot. The boy doesn't get the girl and the girl doesn't get the boy--at least not yet. It isn't even your typical fairytale formula and I like that. I'm a big fan of fairytale endings. I like to see the good guys win and since life is already complicated and messy and happy endings don't always prevail, I kind of like to see them in my movies--it's a great escape! But you won't get that here. What you'll get is a bit of realism. In fact, there were moments when I thought I just might be watching a documentary play out.Maya, an 10 year old child, is given a rather explicit sex education course at school and it has left her with a multitude of questions, including how her newly divorced parents could have ever been in love in the first place. In the past, whenever she'd bring up subjects here father didn't want to deal with he'd say, ""It's complicated"" then promise to fill her in on the details, at a later date. But Maya is tired of hearing ""it's complicated"" and needs answers, now.Maybe it's the fact that he's just signed his divorce papers, or perhaps it's his need to undo the damage done during her sex education class (one in which he knew absolutely nothing about) but Will decides to cave. However, instead of simply giving his daughter the fairytale she'd been hoping for, Will decides to give her a story that is, by all accounts, complicated. For you see, Will has not had one true love in his lifetime, but three. And the three have not only left him broken-hearted but left him questioning love altogether.To make the story more interesting, and to get his daughter thinking for herself, Will changes the names of two of the girls--one being Maya's mother--though he tells her that all three names have been changed. In true mystery fashion, Maya must pay attention to the subtle clues given within the story if she wants to figure out which girl (or woman) is her mother.But something surprising happens as the story unfolds, Maya's innocent insight into the relationships helps Will discover why his marriage failed and where true love lies.Definitely, Maybe was billed as a romantic comedy but I disagree. While there were moments of laughter and it was more light-hearted than necessary, it definitely wasn't a romantic comedy in my book. As for those moments of laughter, the best lines come from Maya. They alone are worth a second viewing in my book!",5,Daughter watches at least 4 times a year,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2569,"['teenage', 'daugher', 'FAVORITE', 'film', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'storyline', 'smart', 'heartwarming.===This', 'not', 'typical', 'romance', 'story', 'long', 'shot', 'boy', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'girl', ""n't"", 'get', 'boy', 'least', 'not', 'yet', ""n't"", 'even', 'typical', 'fairytale', 'formula', 'like', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'fairytale', 'endings', 'like', 'see', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'life', 'already', 'complicated', 'messy', 'happy', 'endings', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'prevail', 'kind', 'like', 'see', 'movies', 'great', 'escape', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'What', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bit', 'realism', 'fact', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'thought', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'documentary', 'play', 'out.Maya', '10', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'given', 'rather', 'explicit', 'sex', 'education', 'course', 'school', 'left', 'multitude', 'questions', 'including', 'how', 'newly', 'divorced', 'parents', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'love', 'first', 'place', 'past', 'whenever', ""'d"", 'bring', 'up', 'subjects', 'here', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', ""'d"", 'say', 'complicated', 'then', 'promise', 'fill', 'details', 'later', 'date', 'Maya', 'tired', 'hearing', 'complicated', 'answers', 'now.Maybe', 'fact', 'just', 'signed', 'divorce', 'papers', 'perhaps', 'need', 'undo', 'damage', 'done', 'sex', 'education', 'class', 'one', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Will', 'cave', 'However', 'instead', 'simply', 'giving', 'daughter', 'fairytale', ""'d"", 'been', 'hoping', 'Will', 'give', 'story', 'accounts', 'complicated', 'see', 'Will', 'not', 'had', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'lifetime', 'three', 'three', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'left', 'broken-hearted', 'left', 'questioning', 'love', 'altogether.To', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'get', 'daughter', 'thinking', 'herself', 'Will', 'names', 'two', 'girls', 'one', 'being', 'Maya', 'mother', 'three', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'true', 'mystery', 'fashion', 'Maya', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'subtle', 'clues', 'given', 'story', 'figure', 'out', 'girl', 'woman', 'mother.But', 'something', 'surprising', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Maya', 'innocent', 'insight', 'relationships', 'helps', 'Will', 'discover', 'why', 'marriage', 'failed', 'where', 'true', 'love', 'lies.Definitely', 'Maybe', 'was', 'billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'disagree', 'were', 'moments', 'laughter', 'was', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'necessary', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'book', 'moments', 'laughter', 'best', 'lines', 'come', 'Maya', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'second', 'viewing', 'book']",N/A

Yes. No.""Definitely, Maybe"", the new film from writer - director Adam Brooks (who has written a number of screenplays including ""Wimbledon"") and producers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner (""Atonement"", ""Notting Hill"", ""About A Boy"") is a pretty dismal failure.Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds, ""Just Friends"", ""Blade: Trinity"") is a divorced dad who looks forward to the days when he gets to pick up his daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin, ""Little Miss Sunshine""). But when he arrives at the school, he finds a number of parents up in arms; ""Did YOU know they were going to teach sex ed today?"" Maya greets him by asking about various body parts and they begin an awkward discussion leading to story about how Will met Maya's mom. But Will has had three loves in his life and they are part of the story about how he and her mom met, so he decides to change all of their names and let Maya guess who her mom is. They make some hot chocolate and Will tucks her into bed before beginning the story of his life, from 1992 to the present. Leaving his college sweetheart, Emily (Elizabeth Banks, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") in Minnesota, he travels to New York to work for the Clinton Campaign. He quickly meets April (Isla Fisher, ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Lookout""), the girl who makes copies at campaign headquarters, and they begin to talk and flirt. Later, he meets Summer (Rachel Weisz) and her boyfriend, Hampton Roth (Kevin Kline) who is also her thesis advisor. Emily, the girlfriend in Minnesota asked him to deliver a book belonging to Summer, so he does his duty. Naturally, over the course of the next decade, he continues relationships with each of these women, experiencing the natural highs and unnatural lows, and vice versa, inherent in movie romance clich&eacute;s.There are two really big problems with ""Definitely, Maybe"". The first is Ryan Reynolds. He is so completely `blah' as Will Hayes it is difficult to muster any feeling for him, almost as difficult as it seems to be for the actor to muster any emotion for anything in the story. He walks through the entire film with a glum look on his face. Worse, he never seems genuinely interested in any of the three women, let alone the woman who he marries and becomes Maya's mother.Because the film tells the story of Will's relationships with these three women, and they see each other off and on over the course of almost two decades, you would expect to see some fireworks, occasionally, as he dates these three women. What keeps them interested in each other? We have to see some sort of evidence of what would make these four people continue to want to see each other and, quite honestly, there is none. The three female actors make a game attempt to display some chemistry. But their attentions are unrewarded. As they laugh, giggle and practically jump on top of Reynold's character, he merely stands stoically, and seems to want to discuss a good book or the newest television show.Because he never shows any emotion, it is all but impossible to feel for his character, and give two figs whether he marries any of these women. They all deserve better.The filmmakers go to great pains to make Will seem like a great father. He seems to look forward to the days he gets to pick Maya up, and seems to relish his time with her. But as soon as he meets her at her school, he seems burdened by her. He never smiles when they are together. And telling the story of how he met her mother just seems to be a chore. Naturally, he would be a little reluctant to tell her about his previous loves (he doesn't want to slip up and talk about sex, for instance), but this continues throughout the entire film. And if he is so reluctant to talk about these previous relationships why do it? Because without this story, there would be no film. Or it would be a radically different film. Maybe a better film. But the filmmaker is intent on having the story framed as a bedtime story for his daughter, so there we have it.Each of the three leads makes a game attempt to create a fully realized, believable character. Each has a distinct personality and has their pros and cons. In fact, it almost seems like the filmmaker is splitting one believable character into the three, giving each a pronounced distinct trait that one woman might display some of the time. Because each of these women is so attached to this trait, they become less believable as the film grinds through its overly long story.Rachel Weisz (Summer Hartley) fares the best of the three. Her character, Summer, is the woman who Will's college sweetheart knows. Emily asks Will to deliver a book to her in New York. Curiosity gets the better of him and he opens the book to reveal her diary. When he arrives at her address to make the delivery, he finds Hampton Roth (Kevin Kline), a college professor, greeting him, wearing a half open robe. Will assumes he is her father, her eccentric father, and they start drinking. Then, she returns and wakes Will up, revealing the professor is her thesis advisor and boy friend. Thus begins their relationship and over the course of the film, the three meet occasionally, and Will falls in love with her. Throughout, she is the most interesting because she is the least predictable, to a point.Elizabeth Banks plays Emily, Will's college sweetheart. She is, probably the most predictable character. But there is something about Banks that makes me watch her every minute I see her on screen. She generally plays characters that are very sweet and use their laugh to hide mixed emotions and pain. Because she is usually able to reveal these traits in a subtle manner, it makes me think she might have a couple of great roles in her, maybe down the road a bit, but I think she might have something hiding deep down inside, just waiting to explode. When she has the right character, in the right film.  In ""Maybe"", her character stays true to form. But she makes predictable choices and `mistakes' and shows up at predictable times.Isla Fisher is also interesting, and also a free spirit. When Will first meets her, he learns April is simply working at the campaign headquarters to make money. She doesn't have strong feelings, one way or another about the candidate. This perplexes Will as he has moved to New York to work for this candidate. This is what is called a ""meet-cute"" moment and it is about as cute as they get. Over the course of their time together, Will learns of this one item, a hard to find item that she has been looking for for years. What do you suppose might happen if he found that item? Do you think he might?Kevin Kline is the most interesting, lively character in the entire film. A bombastic, egotistical professor, Kline still manages to make us like Hampton. It's a shame he isn't around more, the film would have benefited greatly from more of Kevin Kline. I have a fever, and the prescription is more Kevin Kline.Abigail Breslin is stuck in a rut. In ""Little Miss Sunshine"", she played a cute girl in a biting comedy laced with black humor. Since then, she has merely played a variety of cute girls, without the dark humor to mute her saccharin characters. ""Maybe"" is no exception to this rule. The only surprise is how little she is in the film. Given the film is largely told in flashback, before her parent's meet, and therefore, conceive her, she doesn't have a lot of screen time.A significant portion of the story is devoted to Will and his work. He moves to New York in 1992 to work at Clinton's campaign headquarters. So throughout the film, we see Bill Clinton's face. This isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't have a lot to do with the story. Later, when Will and his friends get together, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks, they briefly talk about whether they would vote for him. Yet, there is never a significant reason for this campaign to be a part of the film. Later, Will and his partner (Derek Luke) go to work for a New York mayoral candidate (who ran the Clinton campaign). This character is fictionalized and it would have been very easy to make up a fictional candidate to replace Clinton. Because he is featured throughout, but for little reason, he becomes little more than a diversion, something to divert our attention from the main story. If you are going to use such a iconic character as a backdrop for your story, it needs to play more of a role in the overall context, or his story needs to mirror a specific part of the film.""Definitely, Maybe"" is, more than anything, a disappointing film. It gets so much wrong, on so many levels that you have to wonder what happened to the producers who brought us films like ""Notting Hill"", ""About a Boy"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". Maybe, Definitely they weren't quite as hands on with this film as they should've been. Or maybe they need Hugh Grant or Julie Roberts to make their films work? Maybe. But I'm definitely positive this film doesn't work. Maybe on any level.",2,Maybe Not,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,9056,"['Definitely', 'Maybe', 'Man', 'Woman', 'College', 'Adulthood', 'Marriage', 'Child', 'Child', 'Curious', 'Divorced',

It displays his full range of acting ability (which is quite good - he can be extremely funny but also has full dramatic leading man capacity) and the movie is just surprisingly good. I recommend this movie. As a strange aside that just popped into my head, Adam Sandler should step aside from doing movies like Click and Bedtime Stories and hand those roles over to Reynolds - he would have made those movies twice as good.Anyway it was a good story with nice twists, much less predictable than many romcoms, it was funny and just plain good.

It seemed way different than an atypical romantic comedy. The basic premise throughout most of it is that Will Hayes (played by Ryan Reynolds) tells his daughter, Maya (played by Abigail Breslin), the story about how he met her mother. He made it a little interesting for her and used age-appropriate descriptions. He told her about three different women he had known back in his younger years. He wanted her to guess which one ended up being her mother. Each of the three women (Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz respectively) did a fantastic job in their roles. This movie was so good in my opinion that I saw it twice in the span of a few days. All in all, it really is worth watching at least once if not more than that.",5,Not Maybe But Definitely a Good Movie,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,847,"['hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'thought', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'seemed', 'way', 'different', 'atypical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'basic', 'premise', 'most', 'Will', 'Hayes', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'made', 'little', 'interesting', 'used', 'age-appropriate', 'descriptions', 'told', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'had', 'known', 'back', 'younger', 'years', 'wanted', 'guess', 'one', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'mother', 'three', 'women', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'respectively', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'roles', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'opinion', 'saw', 'twice', 'span', 'few', 'days', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'not', 'more']",N/A
1157295,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0017JHQPK,Traveler,"[3, 6]","Since ""Definitely, Maybe"" is a romantic comedy you shouldn't expect too much.  Still, there's more there than a lot of viewers realize.For its genre it's a pretty good movie.  We don't really get the cliche ""meet cute"" between two central characters.  This is a story about a soon to be divorced father telling a cute mystery to his daughter about how he met her mother and a few other women he met along the way.  While a lot of the plot points are typical rom-com standards, the set up is original.  And yes, if you're paying attention you will know how the movie ends long before the credits roll.  But that's OK because it's that kind of movie.  If you want a surprise ending don't watch any romantic comedy.The one major weakness in the film - and it's minor for the most part, is the lack of authenticity in depicting the era and the characters aging.  We don't really get a sense that 1992 is really 1992 and we certainly don't see the characters age as 16 years go by.  Will, the central character, looks like he's about 4 years older by the end of the film.  Not sure why the director made this error.**Possible Spoiler Alert**The deeper and far more important part of the story is Will's evolution as a political idealist and his commitment to his young daughter.He starts off in 1992 as this starry eyed campaign staffer working on Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in New York.  Over the years both his idealism and his political career go down in flames after a series of disappointments.  His attitude change is sealed when he throws his plate of noodles at the TV screen when he sees Clinton question the definition of the word ""is."" To drive the final nail in the coffin, near the end of the film Will sees Clinton running through Central Park with his Secret Service agents.  Will hollers out to him about how he worked on his '92 campaign.  Clinton ignores him while giving him a single thumb up gesture.Will hates his current job in advertising.  But he does love his daughter.  It's not strongly stated, but it's probably what gives him the energy to go to work each morning.  The one thing missing is being with someone he loves and loves him in return.  The loss of his idealism is what makes all of this more powerful and meaningful for the viewer.As a former political activist I can attest to the truth in the depiction of Will's character.  Just like April states in the movie, in the end you realize how most of the politicians are in it for themselves.  This is a great movie to show you what really matters.",4,A good romantic comedy & a reminder about what matters most,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2539,"['Definitely', 'Maybe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'Still', 'more', 'there', 'lot', 'viewers', 'realize.For', 'genre', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'cliche', 'meet', 'cute', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'story', 'soon', 'be', 'divorced', 'father', 'telling', 'cute', 'mystery', 'daughter', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'few', 'other', 'women', 'met', 'way', 'lot', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'typical', 'rom-com', 'standards', 'set', 'up', 'original', 'yes', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'long', 'credits', 'roll', 'OK', 'kind', 'movie', 'want', 'surprise', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'one', 'major', 'weakness', 'film', 'minor', 'most', 'part', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'depicting', 'era', 'characters', 'aging', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'sense', '1992', 'really', '1992', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'characters', 'age', '16', 'years', 'go', 'Will', 'central', 'character', '4', 'years', 'older', 'end', 'film', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'director', 'made', 'error', '**Possible', 'Spoiler', 'Alert**The', 'deeper', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'Will', 'evolution', 'political', 'idealist', 'commitment', 'young', 'daughter.He', '1992', 'starry', 'eyed', 'campaign', 'staffer', 'working', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'New', 'York', 'years', 'idealism', 'political', 'career', 'go', 'down', 'flames', 'series', 'disappointments', 'attitude', 'change', 'sealed', 'when', 'plate', 'noodles', 'TV', 'screen', 'when', 'Clinton', 'question', 'definition', 'word', 'drive', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'end', 'film', 'Will', 'Clinton', 'running', 'Central', 'Park', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'Will', 'hollers', 'out', 'how', 'worked', ""'92"", 'campaign', 'Clinton', 'giving', 'single', 'thumb', 'up', 'gesture.Will', 'current', 'job', 'advertising', 'love', 'daughter', 'not', 'strongly', 'stated', 'probably', 'what', 'energy', 'go', 'work', 'morning', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'being', 'someone', 'return', 'loss', 'idealism', 'what', 'more', 'powerful', 'meaningful', 'viewer.As', 'former', 'political', 'activist', 'can', 'attest', 'truth', 'depiction', 'Will', 'character', 'Just', 'April', 'states', 'movie', 'end', 'realize', 'how', 'most', 'politicians', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'show', 'really', 'matters']",N/A
