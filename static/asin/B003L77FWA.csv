1349760,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B003L77FWA,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 2]","""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" kicks off an exciting Season  Two  ( 1984-1985) by brancing out beyond the series' home setting. Five episodes feature Lee (""Scarecrow"") Stetson and Amanda King (Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson) on international assignments in Europe. These European episodes were filmed entirely on location in London, Germany, and Austria. Jean Stapleton (""All In The Family"", ""Faerie Tale Theatre"") guest stars as senior spy, and Lee's mentor, Emily Farnsworth in the episodes ""The Legend Of Das Geisterschloss"" and ""The Three Faces Of Emily."" Other notable guest stars in Season Two include John Rhys-Davis, Sid Haig, Michael Richards, David Paymer, and Daniel Davis.The episodes are well-written and engrossing, and the series is perfectly cast. Kate Jackson makes Amanda King an especially appealing, pro-active heroine. We will never see Amanda use a gun, but she is observant and uses her intelligence to get out of dangerous situations. And I'll take Bruce Boxleitner's super-sexy agent Lee Stetson any day over James Bond. Lee does heroically save Amanda's life on occasion, but Amanda also saves Lee's life just as often. Amanda is hardly a damsel in distress; cleverly fending off various bad guys and girls by using such common objects as a can of hair-spray, a garden hose, a hair dryer, and a can of whipped-cream! Amanda even earns the respect of miffed co-worker Francine (Martha Smith) when they work together in the episode ""The Life Of The Party."" Kate Jackson also convincingly plays evil when a ruthless ""evil twin"" of Amanda (by way of amazing plastic surgery) is hired to kill Lee in the memorable episode ""Odds On A Dead Pidgeon."" The romantic chemistry between Lee and Amanda is acknowledged in several episodes, particularly ""Ship Of Spies."" Amanda's secret feelings for Lee are humorously revealed during a dream sequence in the Emmy-nominated episode ""D.O.A,: Delirious On Arrival.""The Season Two Set features no Extras, but the DVD packaging and design is excellent. I have a disability and find many TV on DVD sets (especially Universal's releases of ""The Munsters"" and ""The Bionic Woman"") difficult to use and store. ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"", distributed by Warner Brothers, comes in an attractive, easy to use Collector's Box. The five DVDS easily snap in or out of plastic, but solid and sturdy, trays for safe handling and storeage. The DVD Set also includes a detailed episode guide, with broadcast information, synopsis, and series photographs. ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" is highly entertaining and highly recomended.",5,"EUREOPEAN ADVENTURES FOR ""SCARECROW AND MRS.

However the reason to watch was always Kate Jackson's winning, endearing portrayal of a spunky housewife thrown in the middle of international intrigue, balancing saving the free world with getting her boys home from soccer practice and making dinner. In addition, there's her great chemistry with Boxleitner. The show still works because of it.Watching the show as an adult, I was surprised by how one dimensionally evil the Soviet baddies are. I'm not saying the USSR was a good place, I'm not a fool, but the villains here practically walk around twisting their mustaches. Nuanced it ain't. Indeed, it's an exceptionally conservative show politically, with endless nasty leftists and even a Season One villain named after murdered Filipino opposition leader Benigno Aquino (this was back in the days when dictator Ferdinand Marcos was our friend).

1349792,AAHGPDGEDRVEN,B003L77FWA,"Tracy Christenson ""dictionary enchantress""","[0, 0]","The Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a wonderful mix of action, adventure, mystery, comedy, and romance.In the first season of the show, Lee Stetson, a secret agent codenamed ""Scarecrow"" working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the ""Agency"" finds himself in a tough spot and is forced to ask a civilian, Mrs. King, to deliver a package for him.  Although Amanda King, divorced mother of two boys, is unable to deliver the package as Lee asked, she ends up helping him to solve the case he's working on and joins the Agency herself.  She becomes Lee's friend and partner, and later, the two of them fall in love.  Amanda offers Lee a unique point-of-view on things because she understands more about ordinary civilian life than the regular agents do.  At times, the series might seem a little corny because of the way a group of trained secret agents comes to rely on an ordinary suburban housewife, but it's all in fun.  Personally, I find the shows hilarious, with the clashes between Mrs. King's nave yet practical approach to situations and Scarecrow's professional experience, particularly since Mrs. King has to go to great lengths to keep her family from finding out that she has become a spy.Most of the shows take place around Washington D.C. and Virginia, but this season features some episodes which take place in other countries.  The episodes in season 2 are:1. To Catch a Mongoose - Lee and Amanda are in London on the trail of an assassin who might be an old classmate of Amanda's.2. The Times They Are a Changin' - Amanda and her family win a trip to Germany, only the contest was actually a ploy made up by the Agency so Amanda would have a chance to act as a courier between Lee and a former `60s radical who may be forced to kill someone.3. Double Agent - A disgruntled former agent writes a book exposing some of the Agency's secrets, including their use of civilians like Amanda.  However, he is murdered before the book gets published, and Lee and Amanda must find the killer and the manuscript.4. The Legend of Das Geisterschloss - Emily (played by Jean Stapleton), a British agent and an old friend of Lee's, disappears while visiting Austria.  Lee and Amanda search for her using her sketchbook as a guide.5. Charity Begins at Home - Lee asks Amanda to get him into a classic car show where Amanda is volunteering to raise money for charity so he can learn about the sponsor's illegal dealings.6. Brunettes Are In - Lee and Amanda argue after a microdot containing important information is stolen from Amanda while she's on assignment.  Amanda considers leaving the Agency, but Lee learns that the thief has connections to some men with sinister intentions toward Amanda personally.7. Our Man in Tegernsee - Amanda is arrested for passing counterfeit money in Germany when she tries to buy presents for her sons after carrying out a simple errand for the Agency.8. Affair at Bromfield Hall - On a trip to England, Amanda accidentally ends up in a scandal with a British peer when a man takes a picture of them in a park and alleges that she is his mistress.  To avert scandal and avoid blowing their cover on assignment, Lee and Amanda visit the peer at his country estate where some of the guests have connections to Lee's current case.9. A Class Act - Amanda goes to the Agency's training camp with Lee.  Lee is posing as one of the trainees to investigate the backgrounds of the other trainees, one of whom is an enemy agent.10. Playing Possum - When Amanda shows up at the Agency only to find the place abandoned, she and Lee have to find out what state of emergency prompted the Agency to go underground.11. The Three Faces of Emily - Lee's friend Emily is back in Washington and trying to prevent someone from passing the plans of a secret fighter plane to the Russians.  This is a fun episode with Emily dressing up to play several other roles, including a KGB interrogator, with Amanda's dining room doubling as a detention room in the Russian embassy.12. Ship of Spies - Lee asks Amanda to come on a cruise to help him investigate the disappearance of a friend of his on that same cruise ship.  The only problem is that the current cruise is for couples who are about to be married, and if they don't solve the case in time, they may have to go through with the ceremony to avoid blowing their cover.13. Spiderweb - Lee is forced to spy on Amanda when someone makes it look like she is leaking information about defectors that the Agency is trying to protect.14. A Little Sex, a Little Scandal - Amanda witnesses a murder, but by the time she can return with the police, the body and all the evidence of the crime are gone.  Unfortunately, the killers know that Amanda saw them and are after her, all while Amanda is competing in a contest to be Mother of the Year.15. A Relative Situation - Lee's uncle, Col. Clayton, is facing court martial after he is blamed for the deaths of some of his men.  Their planes crashed, and Col. Clayton was accused of making them perform a dangerous maneuver, but Lee suspects sabotage.16. Life of the Party - Amanda and Francine, another agent at the Agency, go undercover at a company that cleans and caters at parties in order to investigate thefts of important secrets.17. Odds on a Dead Pigeon - A man who wants revenge on Lee hires an assassin who looks exactly like Amanda to kill him.18. Car Wars - Amanda's car is in the shop, so when she needs to run some errands for the Agency, Lee borrows a car for her from the impound yard, not knowing that there is something dangerous hidden in it and that there are people out searching for it.19. DOA: Delirious on Arrival - Lee regrets allowing Amanda to eat his lunch when they find out that it contained a drug which causes her to hallucinate and act on crazy whims.  Now Lee has to negotiate for the antidote while keeping Amanda safe from both the poisoner and herself.20. You Only Die Twice - Everyone is shocked to read Amanda's obituary in the paper, especially Amanda herself.  Another agent borrowed Amanda's identity as a cover and was killed on assignment, but what will happen when the killers learn that ""Amanda King"" is still alive?21. Burn Out - It looks like Lee is having a breakdown.  Amanda's well-meaning attempts to help him through his troubles might endanger the case he's working on and possibly cost Amanda her life.22. Murder Between Friends - Amanda is having trouble making ends meet, so when the head of a security company associated with the Agency offers her a better-paying job, she reluctantly accepts.  Unfortunately, her new boss is murdered, and Amanda becomes the primary suspect.23. Vigilante Mothers - A community environmentalist group that Amanda joins becomes the target of a terrorist who has a habit of romancing women to get what he wants.",5,The Suburban Spy Goes
