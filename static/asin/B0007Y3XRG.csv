The point always seemed to me to be that in the most mundane everyday events, in the most quiet and humdrum places, human nature shows itself.This series is beautifully filmed. The scenery and costumes are visually compelling. The music is perfect to the time and place. But the plotting and characterization is overdone. The Marple books were deliberately quiet and low-key. These productions are glossy and brassy. There is energy and humor, but little charm. Although visually faithful to the period, the content is distinctly modern.And finally there is the portrayal of Miss Marple. To me she is too aggressive, too outspoken, too energetic. I always pictured Miss Marple as more of an observer, someone no one knew was watching, someone everyone underestimated. This Miss Marple would make the criminal cautious and suspicious.All that being said, if I had not read and re-read all the Marple books, if I had not seen all the early adaptations, I would have really liked this series.

Ms. Hickson might be closer in age and deportment to the book version of Miss Marple, but she is very bland on TV and doesn't give the emotional weight to the story that McEwan does.  And while the Hickson versions may be more faithful to the original story, that's not always a plus.  In ""At Bertram's Hotel"", the McEwan version does add a subplot not in the book but it's very well handled and gives a slow story some pizzazz.  Also, the production values, directing and editing are superior. The Hickson version features scene after scene of people talking over tea (not very entertainingly) and the casting is frankly second-rate.  There's also no contest between the two versions of ""The Moving Finger"" -- McEwan's version is superior in acting, directing, and dialogue to the slow, uninspired Hickson version.Normally I'm a stickler for adhering to the source, but there's just no comparison between these two Marples.

This one fails on all counts.This Marple is a bit too laid back in general and downright offensive in the know-it-all unfolding, rendered especially absurd with the two detectives sitting there slack jawed. Besides, there's something especially sicky about some of her aspect in that segment. Joan Hickson gave us a character capable of expressing varied natural emotional reactions, a respectable primness which is part of her character and a sharing of her wisdom in an entirely more palatable fashion. She was set in some ways, but people of all ages were comfortable with her. This woman has a vacancy about her along with being too quirky and impersonally strange.Most ghastly was the Inspector Melchett portrayal - a complete ass. It was downright embarrassing to watch and listen at many points. Bizarre. It's hard to believe a director and/or producer passed such a performance.  The Basil Blake was a blubbering sham, his ""Mrs."" being a poor substitute as well. The Dolly Bantry was too young and too effusive. The Col. Bantry character was phoned in both by script and portrayal.The cinematography being crisper actually worked against the production in comparison with the 1980's version. It only served to more painfully expose the glaring deficiencies of this thoroughly gaffed production.The Joan Hickson production carried more depth all around. The actors in that one presented varied dimensional characters, entirely more credible and living in their types. As for the ones here - flimsy cardboard cutouts.

I have to agree to a certain extent on the McEwan version's after watching 'Murder at the Vicarage' which indeed was horrendously poor and garish.  But the other McEwan Miss Marple's are fine, even if they do take liberty from the book.  Why not just stop reading the books and just watch entertainment....or just stick with the books.  One or the other without all the pre-conceived notions about how it ""should"" have been.  I have found long ago no screen version can ever match the book I read anyway.  And just because no one single person has stepped forth to present the quintessential Miss Marple does not automatically make Joan Hickson supreme. I frankly cannot stand re-watching Hickson who simply irritated me with her arrogant expressions and gestures as if she smelled rotten fish and her elongated pauses followed by often on-comprehensible dialoge that left me feeling as if ""why don't she just say what she means"". And Margaret Rutherford was just a silly caracature.  So that makes McEwan as good as any Miss Marple. YOU keep the ""washed"" poor quality dvd Hickson Miss Marple's.

894967,A10U5D2T50JREX,B0007Y3XRG,Darrell Heath,"[6, 15]","Lets get something straight right from the get go: there is no such thing as the definitve film version of Agatha Christie's spinster sleuth Miss Jane Marple.  The closest anyone has ever come to capturing the 'real' Miss Marple is, IMHO, Joan Hickson.  Even so, I don't think Ms. Hickson quite nailed the character down completely, despite the fact that she gives such a wonderful performance.There have of course been other Miss Marples: Margaret Rutherford, while being completely wrong for the role in every way, was a very humorous and extroverted Marple; Helen Hayes was rather prim and charming; and Angela Lansbury manages to be a rather loopy and eccentric Aunt Jane.  And now we have Geraldine McEwan providing her own interpretation of the character.  While she is still not the definitive Miss Marple she manages to keep the character both fresh and interesting and we should be grateful for that if for nothing else.I agree with many folks that the producers of this new series should be faulted a bit for trying to provide Jane with a backstory and some of the liberties taken with Christie's original novels are a bit much, even for me.  But at the same time I am grateful that they have tried to give us something a bit different from the other productions.  Something that doesen't just duplicate past interpretations.  In their attempt to make something different and yet still quite familiar to Christie fans I think they succeeded admirably.Now when I saw the first episode of this series as it aired on PBS I was prepared to wash my hands of the whole thing and not tune in again.  Then I decided to watch the second story (""4:50 From Paddington"" I think) and decided I may have been completely wrong and reactionary in my first opinion.  I really began to warm to McEwan's impish Miss Marple and as I tuned in to further installments I was completely won over.  Then there was the caliber of great British thespians the shows had: Edward Fox, David Warner, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow and Joanna Lumley (Ab Fab fans will love her role as Miss Marple's good friend Dolly Bantry.  And speaking of ""Ab Fab"" check out the BBC Radio Play adaptation of Miss Marple featuring Eddie's Mom June Whitfield as Jane Marple.  Sadly, only available from the British Amazon.com or the BBC web site shop).  Production values are also very good.  Those great old English houses are wonderful to look at and I also like their use of period music to strike the right period flavor for the show.All in all I have to say that if you can put aside any preconcieved notions of past interpretations and/or expectations about this new series you may find yourself, like me, succumbing to Geraldine McEwan's particular charms and actually finding many things to celebrate in this all new version of Miss Marple.  Decidedly different but still the same old Aunt Jane we all know and love.  Now, I'm off to put the kettle on and have a nice cup of tea while I sit back and watch ""4:50 From Paddington"" all over again.",4,Different From All The Others But  Still Very Enjoyable,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,3010,"['Lets', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'such', 'thing', 'definitve', 'film', 'version', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'spinster', 'sleuth', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'closest', 'anyone', 'ever', 'come', 'capturing', ""'real"", 'Miss', 'Marple', 'IMHO', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'Even', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ms.', 'Hickson', 'quite', 'nailed', 'character', 'down', 'completely', 'fact', 'such', 'wonderful', 'performance.There', 'have', 'course', 'been', 'other', 'Miss', 'Marples', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'being', 'completely', 'wrong', 'role', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'humorous', 'extroverted', 'Marple', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'was', 'rather', 'prim', 'charming', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'be', 'rather', 'loopy', 'eccentric', 'Aunt', 'Jane', 'now', 'have', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'providing', 'own', 'interpretation', 'character', 'still', 'not', 'definitive', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'keep', 'character', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'nothing', 'else.I', 'agree', 'many', 'folks', 'producers', 'new', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'faulted', 'bit', 'trying', 'provide', 'Jane', 'backstory', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Christie', 'original', 'novels', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'even', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'grateful', 'have', 'tried', 'give', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'other', 'productions', 'Something', 'doese', ""n't"", 'just', 'duplicate', 'past', 'interpretations', 'attempt', 'make', 'something', 'different', 'yet', 'still', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Christie', 'fans', 'think', 'succeeded', 'admirably.Now', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'aired', 'PBS', 'was', 'prepared', 'wash', 'hands', 'whole', 'thing', 'not', 'tune', 'again', 'Then', 'decided', 'watch', 'second', 'story', '4:50', 'Paddington', 'think', 'decided', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'wrong', 'reactionary', 'first', 'opinion', 'really', 'began', 'warm', 'McEwan', 'impish', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'tuned', 'further', 'installments', 'was', 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'Then', 'was', 'caliber', 'great', 'British', 'thespians', 'shows', 'had', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'David', 'Warner', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'Ab', 'Fab', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'role', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'good', 'friend', 'Dolly', 'Bantry', 'speaking', 'Ab', 'Fab', 'check', 'BBC', 'Radio', 'Play', 'adaptation', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'featuring', 'Eddie', 'Mom', 'June', 'Whitfield', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'Sadly', 'only', 'available', 'British', 'Amazon.com', 'BBC', 'web', 'site', 'shop', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'old', 'English', 'houses', 'are', 'wonderful', 'look', 'also', 'like', 'use', 'period', 'music', 'strike', 'right', 'period', 'flavor', 'show.All', 'have', 'say', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'preconcieved', 'notions', 'past', 'interpretations', 'expectations', 'new', 'series', 'may', 'find', 'succumbing', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'particular', 'charms', 'actually', 'finding', 'many', 'things', 'celebrate', 'new', 'version', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Decidedly', 'different', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'Aunt', 'Jane', 'know', 'love', 'Now', ""'m"", 'put', 'kettle', 'have', 'nice', 'cup', 'tea', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', '4:50', 'Paddington', 'over', 'again']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 1"

894973,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B0007Y3XRG,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[12, 20]","I thought I could never appreciate anyone in the role of Miss Marple more than Joan Hickson, but have been pleasantly surprised to discover Geraldine McEwan (Mapp & Lucia) portrays a wonderful Miss Marple.  I read Chrisite's `Miss Marple' stories back in the 1950s and 1960s and remember feeling a good deal of fright (I was a teenager then, and these were the pre-Psycho days). Although I cannot now remember clearly how I pictured Jane Marple, Joan Hickson relayed in an interview aired on PBS that Agatha Christie once told her, after a West End performance as Miss Marple, that she (Hickson) represented Miss Marple as she (Christie) had envisioned her. Whether this comment was meant only for that particular performance or for all time, I have no idea, but I recommend that you read the books before you view the dramatizations so as to form your own mind's eye view.Christie was famous for her complex and diabolical plots and as far as I am concerned no writer has ever bested her on this score. The shorter dramatizations in the current film set leave out a good deal of information found in the books and the earlier dramatizations, and I am of the opinion that like fine wine you cannot hurry a good plot. However, the screen play writers have compensated for the tightening of the narrative in the current films by making subtle plot changes, and although none of the critical material has been omitted (the basic plots are still entact), some points might be clearer if you had read the books, and/or seen the older dramatizations.I think Christie's character development was a little thin and the films compensate for this shortcoming through excellent casting. However, the character development in the longer dramatizations from the 1980s is more thorough than that in the recent offerings. On the other hand, some of the casting for the newer films is more accurate.  To 'improve' the plot, some characters were dropped and others given larger roles.  Dereck Jacobi was badly miscast as the overbearing retired military officer in `Murder at the Vicarage', but Tara Fitzgerald is excellent in her role as the twice-widowed daughter-in-law of Ian Richardson.Joanna Lumley is wonderful as Jane Marple's friend who invites her to investigate when her husband (Edward Fox) finds a body in his library.  Lumley's character is reminiscent of the 'Aunt' she played in  `Cold Comfort Farm' not the ""burnt out"" hippie of `Absolutely Fabulous'. This particular story is excellently cast with Ian Richardson, Simon Callow, Jack Davenport (Coupling) and Tara Fitzgerald in supporting roles. At one point, when Marple questions one of the hapless witnesses, McEwan reprises the tone of the wicked Mother Superior of the Magdalen Sisters, and thus gives a steely side to Miss Marple that Hickson used to bring forth by pursing her lips and staring disapprovingly with cold blue eyes. The other films in this set include somewhat less stellar but recognizable actors, not the least of which are Zoe Wanamaker and John Hannah.In sum, the plots of the older versions of `Body in the Library' `4:50 to Paddington' `Murder at the Vicarage' and `The Body in the Library' done in four installments and starring Hickson were better developed in most respects, however, the newer versions with their tighter plots manage to make their point. The filmograhy of the newer versions is beautiful (the older films date from a period when technology was not so ""advanced"" and the films were not well preserved, AND times have changed in England and much of the old countryside is gone, but the camera shoots around the changes). This is an excellent set of films and a better bargain can't be found for Anglophiles who love mystery, however, view the old set and read the books and you will discover nuances that elude the current films. Now, if someone would dramatize `Cat Among the Pigeons'....that was a scary book indeed.",4,Excellent dramatization.....,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,3914,"['thought', 'could', 'never', 'appreciate', 'anyone', 'role', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'more', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Mapp', 'Lucia', 'wonderful', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'read', 'Chrisite', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'stories', 'back', '1950s', '1960s', 'remember', 'feeling', 'good', 'deal', 'fright', 'was', 'teenager', 'then', 'were', 'pre-Psycho', 'days', 'can', 'not', 'now', 'remember', 'clearly', 'how', 'pictured', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'relayed', 'interview', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'once', 'told', 'West', 'End', 'performance', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Hickson', 'represented', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Christie', 'had', 'envisioned', 'comment', 'was', 'meant', 'only', 'particular', 'performance', 'time', 'have', 'idea', 'recommend', 'read', 'books', 'view', 'dramatizations', 'so', 'form', 'own', 'mind', 'eye', 'view.Christie', 'was', 'famous', 'complex', 'diabolical', 'plots', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'writer', 'ever', 'bested', 'score', 'shorter', 'dramatizations', 'current', 'film', 'set', 'leave', 'out', 'good', 'deal', 'information', 'found', 'books', 'earlier', 'dramatizations', 'am', 'opinion', 'fine', 'wine', 'can', 'not', 'hurry', 'good', 'plot', 'However', 'screen', 'play', 'writers', 'have', 'compensated', 'tightening', 'narrative', 'current', 'films', 'making', 'subtle', 'plot', 'changes', 'none', 'critical', 'material', 'been', 'omitted', 'basic', 'plots', 'are', 'still', 'entact', 'points', 'might', 'be', 'clearer', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'and/or', 'seen', 'older', 'dramatizations.I', 'think', 'Christie', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'little', 'thin', 'films', 'compensate', 'shortcoming', 'excellent', 'casting', 'However', 'character', 'development', 'longer', 'dramatizations', '1980s', 'more', 'thorough', 'recent', 'offerings', 'other', 'hand', 'casting', 'newer', 'films', 'more', 'accurate', ""'improve"", 'plot', 'characters', 'were', 'dropped', 'others', 'given', 'larger', 'roles', 'Dereck', 'Jacobi', 'was', 'badly', 'miscast', 'overbearing', 'retired', 'military', 'officer', 'Murder', 'Vicarage', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'excellent', 'role', 'twice-widowed', 'daughter-in-law', 'Ian', 'Richardson.Joanna', 'Lumley', 'wonderful', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'friend', 'who', 'investigate', 'when', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'body', 'library', 'Lumley', 'character', 'reminiscent', ""'Aunt"", 'played', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'Farm', 'not', 'burnt', 'out', 'hippie', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'particular', 'story', 'excellently', 'cast', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'Coupling', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'supporting', 'roles', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Marple', 'questions', 'one', 'hapless', 'witnesses', 'McEwan', 'tone', 'wicked', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Magdalen', 'Sisters', 'thus', 'steely', 'side', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Hickson', 'used', 'bring', 'forth', 'pursing', 'lips', 'staring', 'disapprovingly', 'cold', 'blue', 'eyes', 'other', 'films', 'set', 'include', 'somewhat', 'less', 'stellar', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'John', 'Hannah.In', 'sum', 'plots', 'older', 'versions', 'Body', 'Library', '4:50', 'Paddington', 'Murder', 'Vicarage', 'Body', 'Library', 'done', 'four', 'installments', 'starring', 'Hickson', 'were', 'better', 'developed', 'most', 'respects', 'however', 'newer', 'versions', 'tighter', 'plots', 'manage', 'make', 'point', 'filmograhy', 'newer', 'versions', 'beautiful', 'older', 'films', 'date', 'period', 'when', 'technology', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'advanced', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'preserved', 'AND', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'England', 'much', 'old', 'countryside', 'gone', 'camera', 'changes', 'excellent', 'set', 'films', 'better', 'bargain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'Anglophiles', 'who', 'love', 'mystery', 'however', 'view', 'old', 'set', 'read', 'books', 'will', 'discover', 'nuances', 'elude', 'current', 'films', 'Now', 'someone', 'would', 'dramatize', 'Cat', 'Pigeons', 'was', 'scary', 'book', 'indeed']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 1"

This all makes me wonder whether or not the screenwriters ever read the original stories. And if the did, there is certainly little if any evidence that they did. Mrs. Christie must be reeling in her grave over the crap that's been made of her art.The biggest travesty with the entire series to date are the unfounded liberties the writers, producers et. al. have taken with the Christie stories.I've seen all so far and none, regardless of so-called production values, good acting and the like, remain true to the author. They've even gone and changed the ending in one and maybe another one or two when they're done. Christie's stories were and still are loved for what they were and are ... not for what some producer or director feels in justifying taking such ""artistic license."" I would prefer that a director remain true to a story than be compelled by his/her ego to make a personal imprint on it.As for the good talent in the tales. Are they all in need of money? Is that why they signed on to do them.I'm also sorry that the Christie estate would allow any of these to be made.  Surely they aren't in need of money?

However, I have to agree with previous reviewers who couldn't come to terms with the new Marple.  Geraldine McEwan's portrayal is very far from the character Christie created and the stories have been so mutilated that in some cases they are hardly recognizable.  For my money, you can't improve upon Joan Hickson in the title  role and this new version lacks the subtlty, faint air of menace, wry humor and sharpness of the Hickson productions.  Yes, the new series is more ""colorful"", flashy, even,  with a stream of well-known actors flowing through in character roles but many of them are ill-cast (e.g., Stephen Tomlinson as Inspector Slack) and their characters seem more like charicatures or cartoon figures.  Miss Marple has been transformed into  a much less remarkable person, with a rather routine romantic past and without the same shadowy, razor-sharp intelligence honed by experience with the people living in her small village.

895002,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B0007Y3XRG,Israel Drazin,"[2, 6]","There are four DVDs in this package from the generally highly praised PBS Mystery series: The Murder in the Vicarage, A Murder is Announced, The Body in the Library, and 4:50 from Paddington. All of the episodes last one and a half hours. All are ""updated"" versions of original Agatha Christie stories; they occur in more modern times. All are about the aged Miss Marple who has keen insight into people's character and, despite the reluctance of the police, becomes involved in solving murders because of her knowledge of human psychology, based upon her observations of people in seemingly insignificant acts in her small home city.The episodes start with a scene from years back and then jump forward about a decade. For example, in Murder in the Vicarage, the first scene is about a wife seeing her husband off to war. The husband says that she should not come to the train to see him off. He is met at the train by another woman, and it is clear that the two are in love. The film then jumps forward many years and a story of a murder is told. We are not told who the second woman is, what happened to the husband or, more significantly, what this episode has to do with the murder. This is not revealed until the end. It adds another mystery to the murder case.Similarly, in the final story, 4:50 from Paddington, the film begins with the death of a woman who dies saying that money is not the most important thing in life. Then the film jumps ahead a decade.The stories are interesting. All focus on love. Clues are rarely dropped for the viewers or are very subtle, and the endings are surprises. The stories, as in all Agatha Christie tales, are filled with red herrings. An example is in the final episode. One of the characters refuses to reveal information. It seems that he does so because he is the murderer. Another characteristic is that what appears to be a relationship is shown by subsequent events not be so.  Still another characteristic is that the English people act differently than Americans would act under the circumstances and, despite the same language, speak differently and interestingly. All in all, the shows are well worth the time to watch them.",5,These episodes are well worth watching,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,2180,"['are', 'four', 'DVDs', 'package', 'generally', 'highly', 'praised', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'series', 'Murder', 'Vicarage', 'A', 'Murder', 'Announced', 'Body', 'Library', '4:50', 'Paddington', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'are', 'updated', 'versions', 'original', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'stories', 'occur', 'more', 'modern', 'times', 'are', 'aged', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'who', 'keen', 'insight', 'people', 'character', 'reluctance', 'police', 'involved', 'solving', 'murders', 'knowledge', 'human', 'psychology', 'based', 'observations', 'people', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'acts', 'small', 'home', 'city.The', 'episodes', 'start', 'scene', 'years', 'back', 'then', 'jump', 'forward', 'decade', 'example', 'Murder', 'Vicarage', 'first', 'scene', 'wife', 'seeing', 'husband', 'war', 'husband', 'should', 'not', 'come', 'train', 'see', 'off', 'met', 'train', 'woman', 'clear', 'two', 'are', 'love', 'film', 'then', 'forward', 'many', 'years', 'story', 'murder', 'told', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'who', 'second', 'woman', 'what', 'happened', 'husband', 'more', 'significantly', 'what', 'episode', 'do', 'murder', 'not', 'revealed', 'end', 'mystery', 'murder', 'case.Similarly', 'final', 'story', '4:50', 'Paddington', 'film', 'death', 'woman', 'who', 'saying', 'money', 'not', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'Then', 'film', 'ahead', 'decade.The', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'focus', 'love', 'Clues', 'are', 'rarely', 'dropped', 'viewers', 'are', 'very', 'subtle', 'endings', 'are', 'surprises', 'stories', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'tales', 'are', 'filled', 'red', 'herrings', 'example', 'final', 'episode', 'One', 'characters', 'reveal', 'information', 'so', 'murderer', 'characteristic', 'what', 'be', 'relationship', 'shown', 'subsequent', 'events', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'Still', 'characteristic', 'English', 'people', 'act', 'differently', 'Americans', 'would', 'act', 'circumstances', 'same', 'language', 'speak', 'differently', 'interestingly', 'shows', 'are', 'well', 'time', 'watch']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 1"

The language used is American English and not British English.  The cast is totally lacking in enthusiasm for their parts and come across as if they were in the film because they lost a bet.  The casting is not very good and few of the actors match their part.  Several scenes of graphic homosexual physical affection have been added.There is a technical flaw of the audio and video not being exactly synchronized.  It is most obvious when the people's  mouths do not move properly to match what they say.After viewing this several times I noticed why it seemed simplified.  The characters are stupid.  Even Miss Marple comes across as an airhead who blurts out smart sentences every so often.  Also there appears to be some ethical preaching.  Everyone who has any moral standards is ridiculed.

However, whereas in the Rutherford Marple movies, which were comedy bordering on slapstick, these are rather like Creepshow adapted to Christie.  I have watched each of these 'new' Marples out of a rather morbid curiosity, and have been deeply disappointed each time.  I can't comment on Ms. McEwan's talents, as I don't remember her in other parts.  Here, she appears so addled that one wonders how she finds her own home!  Rather than allowing the plots to set the atmosphere of the episodes, the cameramen have been given full play to show what might pass for sinister, low-placement lighting to create an atmosphere.  Unfortunately, that hasn't worked in movies in decades.  Miss Christie may not have been Dickens for the 20th century, but her great body of work as an aggregate deserves better treatment than this.  Rather reminds me of those who perform Shakespeare in the nude or some other gimmick because they have nothing else to offer.

No wonder that great actors are always drawn to Christie's tales. The casts here are nothing short of spectacular: Derek Jacobi, Janet McTeer, Zoe Wanamaker, David Warner, Tara Fitzgerald, Ian Richardson, Joanna Lumley, James Fox, Simon Callow, Elaine Page, John Hannah, Claire Skinner, Frances Barber, Cherie Lunghi, Keeley Hawes, Celia Imrie, Virginia McKenna, Jane Asher, Miriam Margoyles, Herbert Lom.And through these wonderful, suspenseful tale, as well as some of her novels, you might still make a case for Christie as a great observer of human behaviour. Above all, in her novels, there is a pervasive atmosphere of evil, generated by lust, greed, jealousy, and sometimes tragically, love.The final scenes (part of the revisionism, since they are not in the novels) in which the murderers face the ultimate consequence of their crimes in prison add a welcome punch to the usually pastoral settings of the Miss Marple mysteries.And one final word on Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of Miss Marple. The interpretation might not appeal to everybody, but it's a fascinating one. Yes, the kindness and the warmth are there, but also, in some subtle gestures, comments, looks, a wisdom, maybe a sad one, of the lengths some people will go to get what they want.If you are a fan of Christie, mystery stories, or just plain good storytelling and great acting, don't miss this.",4,Sensational retellings of Agatha Christie's classic mystery tales,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1944,"['Classy', 'sharply', 'directed', 'expertly', 'acted', 'welcome', 'set', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'series', 'Agatha', 'Christie.Controversies', 'faithfulness', 'originals', 'might', 'be', 'point', 'fact', 'Christie', 'classic', 'tales', 'can', 'be', 'reinterpreted', 'once', 'again', 'might', 'point', 'out', 'greatness', 'storyteller.Other', 'literary', 'qualities', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'left', 'literary', 'critics', 'debate.Storytelling', 'great', 'characters', 'small', 'achievement', 'are', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'greatest', 'strenghts', 'are', 'well', 'served', '4', 'adaptations', 'wonder', 'great', 'actors', 'are', 'always', 'drawn', 'Christie', 'tales', 'casts', 'here', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'David', 'Warner', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'James', 'Fox', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Elaine', 'Page', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'Frances', 'Barber', 'Cherie', 'Lunghi', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'Miriam', 'Margoyles', 'Herbert', 'Lom.And', 'wonderful', 'suspenseful', 'tale', 'as', 'well', 'novels', 'might', 'still', 'make', 'case', 'Christie', 'great', 'observer', 'human', 'behaviour', 'novels', 'pervasive', 'atmosphere', 'evil', 'generated', 'lust', 'greed', 'jealousy', 'sometimes', 'tragically', 'love.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'part', 'revisionism', 'are', 'not', 'novels', 'murderers', 'face', 'ultimate', 'consequence', 'crimes', 'prison', 'add', 'welcome', 'punch', 'usually', 'pastoral', 'settings', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mysteries.And', 'one', 'final', 'word', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'portrayal', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'interpretation', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'fascinating', 'one', 'Yes', 'kindness', 'warmth', 'are', 'there', 'also', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'comments', 'wisdom', 'maybe', 'sad', 'one', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'get', 'what', 'want.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'stories', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'storytelling', 'great', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 1"

Unfortunately, I don't like what they've done with this latest batch of Christie's.  Mrs. McEwan is a fine actress and she brings a ""fluffiness"" to the role that is missing from the Hickson version.  Still, there is too much tampering with the plotlines to suit me.  There are significant changes made in a couple of the stories, most notably in ""The Body in the Library"" so let the buyer beware.  This isn't a minor change either as it involves the resolution of the case.  They also add an odd, on-going storyline involving Miss Marple's own past love life that is simply not part of the books and isn't even close to being in keeping with the character of Miss Marple.  As Agatha Christie is arguably the most acclaimed and accomplished mystery writer that ever lived, these changes were pretty outrageous.  Her books stand the test of time and need no updating simply to satisfy 21st century ideas.  I was surprised at this as the British are usually the ones who can be depended upon to leave good stories alone.

895036,A2CON4GD056OGB,B0007Y3XRG,Louisa the Lemming,"[9, 11]","The first season of AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE from ITV adapts four whodunits:  Murder in the Vicarage; A Murder is Announced; The Body in the Library; and 4:50 from Paddington.(VAGUE SPOILERS)These adaptations faithfully reproduce the cold-blooded nature of the crimes as portrayed in the novels, but eliminate the sense of evil attached to them.  The intention is to elicit sympathy not for the victims, but for the MURDERERS.  Not all murderers, mind; only those motivated by romantic passion.  The amount of sympathy lavished on the killer is directly correlated to the degree in which Sex was that person's excuse for the crime.  Killers get extra sympathy for being hot and homosexual, a bit less for being homely or heterosexual, but really all Sex is good, and renders any cold-blooded murderer worthy of our sympathy.  Considerations such as the cruelty of the crime or the innocence of the victims simply do not matter.  Thus the most monstrous villains of the batch get the most tears and violins, because they did it for ""Love"".  But the most pitiable killer is pitied least, due to the platonic nature of that person's motives.Christie's Miss Marple had a great sympathy for human frailty - but also a firm sense of right and wrong and a quiet but fierce outrage on behalf of the innocent.  Beneath her gentleness and gentility was the glint of cold steel.  THIS Miss Marple has a ""cute"", ""feisty"", ""unconventional"" exterior pasted over a weak and insubstantial core.  She twinkles and mugs at scenes of violent death, and delivers ALL her lines in a goofy self-caricature such as one might use to entertain small children.  When she isn't rhapsodizing about the love-lives of child-killers, she's fawning over the photograph of an adulterous paramour from her youth.  Apparently, the qualities that have made her formidable, beloved, and world-famous can be dispensed with, but it is all important that she should have a sex life.The writing and directing staff here is all-male, and they lose no time in letting you know it.  In the very first scenes you'll get to watch a teenage girl get ogled up and down slowwwly by dirty-old-man cam, not once but twice.  Like Miss Marple herself, strong adult women and any other characters that should possess some moral authority are reduced to caricature.  The Vicar who counsels two lovers against adultery - for the very good reason that it could only end in harm and disgrace for the woman -- is as penalty turned into an emasculated buffoon, so that his scruples will be less threatening to the frat-boy mentality.  (Compare this to the dignified and moving portrayal of this character in the Hickson version.)This terror of old-fashioned morality is so extreme that it prevents the portrayal of the 1950's setting in anything but a visual sense - with the result that nobody's behavior makes much sense, and some of Miss Marple's more clever social observations (such as the difference between married and unmarried lovers) have to go. Apparently they think we will be shocked if the characters actually behave as though they are living in the era reconstructed with such effort and expense by the set people.As might be expected, the ""politically correctness"" in this series is not enlightened or humanistic; It is misogynistic, ignorant, bigoted, juvenile, and oblivious to these qualities in itself.  This applies in spades to the prurient and stereotypical treatment of homosexuality.  I am not against intelligent alteration of old stories (such as in the POIROT series from the Nineties, or the best of the Joan Hickson Miss Marples).  But these guys alter anything and everything just for the sake of it, and completely miss every point there is to miss.Precisely what makes Miss Marple novels still feel modern today is that Miss Marple never was modern or ""politically correct"" in the first place.  She was introduced as this outdated product of Victorian upbringing who had spent her entire life in a tiny provincial village.  Yet she ran circles around the hip, happening young things and worldly gentlemen who thought themselves so superior, and demonstrated (to their dismay) that human nature was no different in their cosmopolitan circles than in her backwater village.  Judging from Christie's sales figures, the hip happening young things of the time rather enjoyed this joke at their own expense, and its deeper humanistic moral, and have continued to do so since.

895045,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007Y3XRG,mirasreviews,"[31, 38]","This adaptation of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries has more bite than the Joan Hickson films of 1984-1992. Geraldine McEwan's Miss Jane Marple has a sympathetic ear and is always polite, but she doesn't hide her cynicism or incisive nature. She may be closer to Agatha Christie's description of her grandmother and friends who inspired Miss Marple's personality: ""though cheerful, they always expected the worst of everyone and everything and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right."" McEwan's Miss Marple acts like someone trying to appear harmless, but who is actually rather obsessive and tenacious. I'm sure the producers of this Miss Marple series are trying to spice its protagonist up a bit for modern, or younger, audiences. But this Miss Marple isn't likable. While Hickson's Marple was dull, McEwan is scruffy, smirks a lot, and generally looks constipated. I'm giving this series 4 stars, but the episodes vary in quality, and Miss Marple is sometimes grating. The novels upon which the movies are based were written 1930-1957, but they have all been set in the 1950s for this series. Each film is about 90 minutes long.""The Murder at the Vicarage"" introduces us to Miss Jane Marple (Geraldine McEwan), an elderly spinster with a reputation for amateur sleuthing in her home village of St. Mary Mead. When the stodgy, puritanical, and generally insufferable Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Sir Derek Jacobi) is murdered, there is no shortage of suspects. Inspector Slack (Stephen Tompkinson) investigates the case and finds that Miss Marple is a quick-witted partner in detection and a great help in navigating a maze of false confessions and endless red herrings. This is the least successful film of this series. The salacious aspects of the script seem forced, and Jane Marple's flashbacks reveal that she was a young woman during WWI. Oops, that's impossible, since at least 35 years separate WWI from the time in which the story is set, and Miss Marple appears to be about 70.In ""The Body in the Library"", Miss Marple is summoned by her friend Dolly Bantry (Joanna Lumley) when a young woman is found murdered in the library of her homel. The body is that of Ruby Keene (Emma Williams), a dancer at a resort hotel in a nearby town. Miss Marple and Dolly set off to the Majestic Hotel to do some sleuthing, as do the official investigators, Chief Constable Melchett (Simon Callow) and Superintendent Harper (Jack Davenport). The trail leads them to the Jefferson family, most of whose members were tragically lost during the War, leaving only a controlling patriarch, Mr. Conway Jefferson (Ian Richardson), and his daughter- and son-in-law, who care for him. I found ""The Body in the Library"" to be the best film of the series, thanks primarily to the supporting cast. Joanna Lumley makes Dolly comic, colorful, sympathetic, and terrifically entertaining. Simon Callow is superb as the gruff, somewhat ill at ease Colonel Melchett. The comic overtones in this mystery make it great fun.""A Murder Is Announced"" finds Miss Marple vacationing at a spa when a notice appears in the local paper announcing the time and location of a murder that is to take place. Letitia Blacklock (Zoe Wanamaker), whose house is to be the scene of the crime, expects that the notice is a joke that will invite curious neighbors to disturb her evening. So she prepares a party for her uninvited guests, and her drawing room is full by the appointed hour. The lights go out, shots are fired, Leticia is injured, and an intruder is shot to death. Miss Marple's niece, Amy Murgatroyd (Claire Skinner), was present the night of the murder and provides her with lodgings while Miss Marple insinuates herself into the police investigation. The investigation dredges up sordid pasts of the characters who surround Letiticia and turns to the will of the wealthy financier for whom Letiticia was trusted secretary for many years. This film has stirred up some controversy because Amy and her housemate ""Hinch"" are made out to be lovers, but the mystery unfolds nicely.""What Miss McGillicuddy Saw"" is a dramatization of the novel ""4.50 from Paddington"". Elspeth McGillicuddy (Pam Ferris) is traveling by train to visit her friend Miss Marple when she witnesses a woman being strangled in the compartment of another train, as the tracks run parallel to her train. Railway police investigate, but find no body, so no crime. Miss Marple and Elspeth discover that a body could have been dumped as the train passed the grand Rutherford Hall, home to the Crackenthorpe family. Miss Marple engages her intrepid, stylish niece Lucy Eyelesbarrow (Amanda Holden) to take on the job of cook at Rutherford Hall and do some snooping, while Marple stays nearby at the home of Detective Inspector Campbell (John Hannah). The Crackenthorpe family has an ornery patriarch, 3 sons who don't like one another, a long-suffering daughter, and a secret -and the largest private home I've ever seen. Lucy does most of the investigating in this film, and I found her a little too precious, but the family are an entertaining lot.The DVDs (Acorn Media 4-disc set, 2005): There is one movie per disc, and each disc includes a Photo Gallery, which is a 1-minute slideshow of stills and on-set photos from the movie, as well as selected filmographies for 5-6 cast members.

The creators of the new Marple films have taken a free spirited approach to the novels, as they should, as they must, to turn them into functioning screen drama, and added depth to Christie's often paper thin characters with superlative writing and acting.  Misteps?  Sure, but not enough to dampen the pleasure of the entertainments here devised.Geraldine McEwan is simply wonderful, by far the Marple with the most obviously penetrating intelligence, and able to suggest emotional depth far beyond what we're used to seeing in a Christie adaptation.  Just watch the scene in ""A Murder is Announced"" when she discovers a murder that has just taken place in the rain.

But I wager that Geraldine McEwan has done an admirable job of fusing this favorite amateur sleuth with new life (at least in this first series).  Having read the books that these episodes are dramatized from, I am only too aware of the plot changes (from subtle lesbian relationships among minor characters in &#34;A Murder is Announced&#34; and &#34;The Body in the Library&#34; to giving Miss Marple a romantic, other-woman back story that never EVER was in Christie's original work in &#34;A Murder at the Vicarage&#34;).  Yet when I compare this first group of four to the episodes that would follow the tampering with Agatha Christie's original text is tame by far.  Each of these four 90+ minute movies stand out in their own right, never feeling like the same old format again and again.  Some of the actors are surprising choices for this kind of work (yes that is the comedian David Walliams in &#34;The Body in the Library&#34; and the razor-sharp Catherine Tate doing her best Polish accent in &#34;A Murder is Announced&#34;).  McEwan herself beautifully conveys the quiet omnipresence of Miss Marple (if you read Christie's original books it is sometimes startling how seldom we see or hear from Miss Marple until the very end).  She watches these human tragedies unfold before her, but she is never anything less than quaint and dear, if a little nosy, but always sharp as a tack.  There is practically none of the prim starchiness of a Victorian spinster that was and is so integral to Miss Marple's character (and what Joan Hickson became so adept at portraying in the BBC TV movies).The acting is great, the plots are respectful of the original text (yes, overall the plots unfold very close to the books!), and we have a new look at an old friend!

Perhaps that is because this edition of Marple mysteries appears clearly to have been produced with the goal of ""updating"" the old girl--but, as the British are wont to say, it often looks like ""mutton dressed as lamb.""Miss Hickson or Miss McEwan? Now, the latter did have the Marple ""twinkle"" that Christie mentions occassionally, and the ""fluffy"" appearance that is also a passing description in the novels (though it sometimes looked more like a curly perm gone bad).

I believe that it is implied in the novels that Miss Marple was a clergyman's daughter; because her sense of right was strong, so was her sense of wrong. Moreover, such an upbringing in Edwardaian England would also have made her poised in just about any social setting, from a cottage to a castle.

Is it a joke? For Chandler disliked village mysteries, hated Christie and Sayers. His article, The Simple Art of Murder lambasted the golden age mystery writers. So why this particular book on Miss Marple's bedside table? And then, consider this, The Simple Art of Murder, the book, a compilation of various Chandler works was not published till 1950! And Murder at the Vicarage was published in 1930 and set in those wonderful and peaceful years before Hitler. Come on, we are all mystery fans and such things cannot be overlooked.Yes, the whole series is full of more sex, salty language and women in bikinis than previous Christie mysteries (forget the godawful Endless Night)but that's all right.

I can only compare this new adaptation, staring Geraldine McEwan, to the 1985 Joan Hickson adaptation. Perhaps that's the problem. Hickson seemed spot on in the role of Marple, and the adaptations so classy, perhaps I cannot imagine someone else in the role. (Imagine someone other than Suchet doing Poirot.)Or, perhaps this new interpretation just isn't good -- That could be it.What bothered me about this new version of a Murder is Announced:1)Some characters were removed while new relationships were added. This includes an affair that never existed in the old book.2)More scenery chewing than during the making of Mr. Ed. Really, this is hammy stuff.3)More yelling, knife pulling, etc. than required to make a Miss Marple blush; the climax-confrontation with the killer is badly done, an odd series of emotional ventings.4)A spunky Miss Marple in the vein of Jessica Fletcher, as another reviewer mentioned (as apposed to the Miss Marple Christie created). I like Jessica Fletcher, but Miss Marple is a different character.Clearly, those making these adaptations began with a flawed concept: Agatha Christie's work needs to be updated for our modern standards -- there needs to be more conflict ... Much, much more conflict. Maybe you agree? If so, then you might like this series.However, if you like sitting down to a good mystery, I really recommend the Joan Hickson version of this story.

While this does not reflect the exact nature of the novels, the novels certain implied the saliciousness which is so apparent in these films.Persoanlly I don't find this as offensive as many Christie purists do, one has to remember the novels were written in times when even hints at salaciousness would have been wholly shocking, especially if penned by a Woman. Though these films are set in the 1950's some of the novels on which they are based, were penned as far back as 1930's.A modern visual audience may glean a lot from the nostalgia of these films but they need more to offer a modern audience a greater hook and they do this with the upfront intrigue and allure. Miss Marple too has to come of age and in Mcewan's hands she is given an edgier, grittier side with even a hint at a less than pure past.
