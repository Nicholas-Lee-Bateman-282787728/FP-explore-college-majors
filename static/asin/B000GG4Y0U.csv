I had no intention of ever watching this, show, but when a friend kept telling me I should `buy"" the DVD I gave in and did just that.  This show is simply hilarious and you can't help but get caught up in all the drama that happens during the show.  20 women are trying to be the last woman standing.  He eliminates 5 women, then 5 more, then 1 or two at a time until he is down to his final two women and he has to choose the one woman to be his girl.Why any woman would want to be with this man is beyond me, but I guess that is besides the point, because there are women that want to be with this man, and claim they love him.  Yeah okay!!!  The stand out women were New York, (the hair flipper), Hoopz, Pumpkin, Red Oyster, Serious, Goldie and of course Queen golddigger herself Hottie.When I first spotted Hottie I knew I had seen her before, but could not figure out from where.  Turns out she had been on an episode of Blind Date, chaching, chaching!!!  When Flavor realized it, she was cold busted, and he got her good during the reunion show!!!  Take that Hottie, and to think she looks like Beyonce, again her friends are lying.Sweetie reminded me a little of actress Kerry Washington, and I loved her blow up when she was eliminated over Hottie.  I actually agreed with her.  Hottie does not cook her chicken, and Sweetie who does not cook chicken because of a childhood trauma did cook her chicken, and felt the reason Flavor wanted to eliminate her was totally wrong.I guess Hottie thought all she had to do was bat her eyelashes, and flaunt her big boobs, and she would be picked.  Wrong.If you like to watch some fighting, back stabbing, hear all the curse words, and see some unblurred boobage then this is a series you might want to consider buying.  Especially if you were a fan of the show.  I'm a new fan and ended up buying the show.  I mean watching the women fuss at each other, and New York talk right up until he choose Hoopz that she was the woman for him was simply hilarious!!!During one of the episodes Flavor sniffs the women and he says one smells like bacon, another like mushrooms, another like chicken wings, another like broccoli.  It was simply hilarious.I will say it is pretty much uncensored with the exception of 2 parts.  One where some boobs where blurred out during a shower scene, but my take is the women probably did not sign the release to allow those body parts to be shown.  Another scene that is censored was a discussion about having sex with Flav, the graphic term for having sex was edited out.  Aside of that you hear all cussing, and see a little boobage by a couple of the girls.Overall it is a mindless how, which can provide some laughter and a good time when it's all said and done.  You will either like the show or hate it.  I happen to like it.  It makes a good guilty pleasure show indeed.",4,Mindless Entertainment,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2951,"['When', 'see', 'Mindless', 'Entertainment', 'logo', 'pop', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shake', 'head', 'agreement', 'had', 'intention', 'ever', 'watching', 'show', 'when', 'friend', 'kept', 'telling', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'gave', 'did', 'just', 'show', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'show', '20', 'women', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'last', 'woman', 'standing', '5', 'women', 'then', '5', 'more', 'then', '1', 'two', 'time', 'down', 'final', 'two', 'women', 'choose', 'one', 'woman', 'be', 'girl.Why', 'woman', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'man', 'guess', 'point', 'are', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'man', 'claim', 'love', 'Yeah', 'okay', 'stand', 'out', 'women', 'were', 'New', 'York', 'hair', 'flipper', 'Hoopz', 'Pumpkin', 'Red', 'Oyster', 'Serious', 'Goldie', 'course', 'Queen', 'golddigger', 'Hottie.When', 'first', 'spotted', 'Hottie', 'knew', 'had', 'seen', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'episode', 'Blind', 'Date', 'chaching', 'chaching', 'When', 'Flavor', 'realized', 'was', 'cold', 'busted', 'got', 'good', 'reunion', 'show', 'Take', 'Hottie', 'think', 'Beyonce', 'again', 'friends', 'are', 'lying.Sweetie', 'reminded', 'little', 'actress', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'loved', 'blow', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'eliminated', 'Hottie', 'actually', 'agreed', 'Hottie', 'not', 'cook', 'chicken', 'Sweetie', 'who', 'not', 'cook', 'chicken', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'did', 'cook', 'chicken', 'felt', 'reason', 'Flavor', 'wanted', 'eliminate', 'was', 'totally', 'wrong.I', 'guess', 'Hottie', 'thought', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'bat', 'eyelashes', 'flaunt', 'big', 'boobs', 'would', 'be', 'picked', 'Wrong.If', 'like', 'watch', 'fighting', 'back', 'stabbing', 'hear', 'curse', 'words', 'see', 'unblurred', 'boobage', 'then', 'series', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'buying', 'Especially', 'were', 'fan', 'show', ""'m"", 'new', 'fan', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'show', 'mean', 'watching', 'women', 'fuss', 'other', 'New', 'York', 'talk', 'right', 'up', 'choose', 'Hoopz', 'was', 'woman', 'was', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'one', 'episodes', 'Flavor', 'sniffs', 'women', 'one', 'bacon', 'mushrooms', 'chicken', 'wings', 'broccoli', 'was', 'simply', 'hilarious.I', 'will', 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'uncensored', 'exception', '2', 'parts', 'One', 'where', 'boobs', 'where', 'blurred', 'out', 'shower', 'scene', 'take', 'women', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'sign', 'release', 'allow', 'body', 'parts', 'be', 'shown', 'scene', 'censored', 'was', 'discussion', 'having', 'sex', 'Flav', 'graphic', 'term', 'having', 'sex', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'Aside', 'hear', 'cussing', 'see', 'little', 'boobage', 'couple', 'girls.Overall', 'mindless', 'how', 'can', 'provide', 'laughter', 'good', 'time', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'will', 'show', 'hate', 'happen', 'like', 'good', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'indeed']",Flavor of Love - The Complete First Season

1003708,A1Y6NDFQ3F7E8C,B000GG4Y0U,Tyrone Williams,"[15, 16]","It's Flavor Of Love starring the one & only Flavor Flav and 20 beautiful women who are willing to do anything (lie, back-stab, cat-fight, snitch, etc.) to be the one woman by Flav's side. This show is HILARIOUS!20 women from various backgrounds compete to win Flav's love through challenges (cooking, gambling, 5 senses, etc.) to win a private date with Flav and through intimate one-on-one sessions to see what each girl is really about - Which girl really loves Flav and which girl is there to pursue her own interests (modeling, TV career or Flav's fame & fortune). Watching each girl's fate unfold through the eliminations is what keeps my interest in this show. Some of the girls were:NEW YORK - From day one, her focus was to have Flav for her very own. Making it clear that she would not ""play fair"" or ""make friends"", she creates as much drama as she can to eliminate the other girls. Her determination (& underhandedness) gets her as far as the final elimination (and subsequently another shot at Flav in Season 2).RED OYSTER - She's sexy, has a thing for the color red, and was Flav's self-appointed in-house spy. She made it her duty to inform Flav of any & all shady activities that the other girls were up to - with Flav's best interests at heart, of course. Quite a shocker to find out that she was still married while she was on the show.HOTTIE - Her appearance on ""Blind Date"" exposed her as a gold digger, A polygraph test revealed her as a habitual liar and her ""raw-chicken-with-veggies"" meal ceritfied her as the worst cook in the world. The whole ""I look like Beyonce"" thing was probably the funniest moment on the show.SERIOUS - The ""misunderstood"" model. Though she claims she wasn't there to further her modeling career, she didn't make her intentions with Flav clear enough - if she had any intentions at all.SWEETIE - Flav's mother said to him that Sweetie appeared ""desperate"" to win and during her final one-on-one she seemed to be coming on pretty strong with him, perhaps to stay in the competition. Maybe that was the reason she was eliminated. But I think Flav should have kept her (instead of Hottie) because despite her childhood trauma with chicken, she was a trooper and cooked it for him anyway.GOLDIE - I loved Goldie! I think she should have won! Of all the girls, she was the most down to earth and (according to the polygraph test) the most honest. In spite of the fact that she got a little TOO TIPSY before the first elimination, she proved that she could hold her own in the competiton. She was sweet, very funny and quite sexy, as demonstrated by that HOT kiss she laid on Flav during his date with her & New York (Goldie, where have you been!!!). Her admitting to Flav that she ""just wanted to be his friend"" was what eliminated her but I think if she really wanted him she could have been the winner. Flav was obviously ""feeling"" her.HOOPZ - The girl who came out on top. She was also very down to earth and very beautiful. She would not resort to the ""sexual tactics"" some of the other girls used to get Flav and that made her genuine. Her ace in the hole was when she went on the date with Flav & his mother after winning the ""chicken"" competition. She won over Flav's mom while being herself the whole time. Though later it would turn out that she and Flav were not meant to be, she deserved to win.I won't say much about the ""spitting incident"", other than it made Pumkin the worst contestant on the show and possibly all of reality TV.This DVD contains all of the episodes with uneditied language, some brief nudity, the reunion show (After The Lovin') and other extra features.This weekend we'll see the conclusion of Season 2 - will New York win this time?",5,The Romantic Side Of Flavor Flav,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,3710,"['Flavor', 'Love', 'starring', 'one', 'only', 'Flavor', 'Flav', '20', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'lie', 'back-stab', 'cat-fight', 'snitch', 'etc', 'be', 'one', 'woman', 'Flav', 'side', 'show', 'HILARIOUS', '20', 'women', 'various', 'backgrounds', 'compete', 'win', 'Flav', 'love', 'challenges', 'cooking', 'gambling', '5', 'senses', 'etc', 'win', 'private', 'date', 'Flav', 'intimate', 'one-on-one', 'sessions', 'see', 'what', 'girl', 'really', 'Which', 'girl', 'really', 'Flav', 'girl', 'there', 'pursue', 'own', 'interests', 'modeling', 'TV', 'career', 'Flav', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Watching', 'girl', 'fate', 'unfold', 'eliminations', 'what', 'interest', 'show', 'girls', 'were', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'day', 'one', 'focus', 'was', 'have', 'Flav', 'very', 'own', 'Making', 'clear', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'fair', 'make', 'friends', 'as', 'much', 'drama', 'can', 'eliminate', 'other', 'girls', 'determination', 'underhandedness', 'as', 'far', 'final', 'elimination', 'subsequently', 'shot', 'Flav', 'Season', '2', '.RED', 'OYSTER', 'sexy', 'thing', 'color', 'red', 'was', 'Flav', 'self-appointed', 'in-house', 'spy', 'made', 'duty', 'inform', 'Flav', 'shady', 'activities', 'other', 'girls', 'were', 'up', 'Flav', 'best', 'interests', 'heart', 'course', 'shocker', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'married', 'was', 'show.HOTTIE', 'appearance', 'Blind', 'Date', 'exposed', 'gold', 'digger', 'A', 'polygraph', 'test', 'revealed', 'habitual', 'liar', 'raw-chicken-with-veggies', 'meal', 'ceritfied', 'worst', 'cook', 'world', 'whole', 'look', 'Beyonce', 'thing', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'moment', 'show.SERIOUS', 'misunderstood', 'model', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'further', 'modeling', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'intentions', 'Flav', 'clear', 'enough', 'had', 'intentions', 'all.SWEETIE', 'Flav', 'mother', 'said', 'Sweetie', 'appeared', 'desperate', 'win', 'final', 'one-on-one', 'seemed', 'be', 'coming', 'pretty', 'strong', 'perhaps', 'stay', 'competition', 'Maybe', 'was', 'reason', 'was', 'eliminated', 'think', 'Flav', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'instead', 'Hottie', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'chicken', 'was', 'trooper', 'cooked', 'anyway.GOLDIE', 'loved', 'Goldie', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'girls', 'was', 'most', 'down', 'earth', 'according', 'polygraph', 'test', 'most', 'honest', 'spite', 'fact', 'got', 'little', 'TOO', 'TIPSY', 'first', 'elimination', 'proved', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'competiton', 'was', 'sweet', 'very', 'funny', 'quite', 'sexy', 'demonstrated', 'HOT', 'kiss', 'laid', 'Flav', 'date', 'New', 'York', 'Goldie', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'admitting', 'Flav', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'friend', 'was', 'what', 'eliminated', 'think', 'really', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'winner', 'Flav', 'was', 'obviously', 'feeling', 'her.HOOPZ', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'top', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'very', 'beautiful', 'would', 'not', 'resort', 'sexual', 'tactics', 'other', 'girls', 'used', 'get', 'Flav', 'made', 'genuine', 'ace', 'hole', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'date', 'Flav', 'mother', 'winning', 'chicken', 'competition', 'won', 'over', 'Flav', 'mom', 'being', 'whole', 'time', 'later', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'Flav', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'deserved', 'win.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'spitting', 'incident', 'other', 'made', 'Pumkin', 'worst', 'contestant', 'show', 'possibly', 'reality', 'TV.This', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'uneditied', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity', 'reunion', 'show', 'Lovin', 'other', 'extra', 'features.This', 'weekend', ""'ll"", 'see', 'conclusion', 'Season', '2', 'will', 'New', 'York', 'win', 'time']",Flavor of Love - The Complete First Season
