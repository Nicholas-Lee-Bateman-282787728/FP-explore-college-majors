(following Chris Farly, rest in peace) This guy's great. I've seen all of his movies except ""Bulletproof"". I laughed very hard on ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", ""Anger Management"", belive it or not I also laughed on ""Mr. Deeds"" and this one too.I think this movie is more romantic than funny. But I laughed more than cried. This one is hilarious... I LOVE ULA...that's the best character, for me, on this movie. He is HILARIOUS. Rob Schneider is fantastic, one of the best.

Barrymore plays Lucy, she was involved in a horrible car accident in her hometown of Hawaii, the accident caused her short term memory loss, every morning she repeats the same day over and over again. Henry (Sandler) is afraid of committement but to his chargin he ends up falling head over heels in love with Lucy, he soon learns about her condition and stops at nothing to get her memory back, so everyday Henry goes out of his way to make Lucy fall in love with him every chance he gets.

It's sort of the distaff equivalent to ""Groundhog Day"",albeit without Sonny&Cher;,as well as Bill Murray's comic genius.In ""50 First Dates"",Adam Sandler is Henry,who works at an aquarium. He has a she-man assistant Alexa. He frolics among the penguins, walruses, and dolphins. Then he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) For the first time,he's into commitment. Unfortunately, she keeps forgetting who he is. They are brought together with the assistance of a cross-dressing Rob Schneider. Like fanfiction, they have life-affirming sex in front of the dolphin tank. Lucy has a bodybuilding brother,Doug (Sean Astin),who has been busted for steroids. ""50 First Dates"" should be required viewing for fangirls who write homoerotic Frodo&Sam; stories....since Astin looks downright scary shirtless. Astin is one of the few talented actors in the whole film. Unfortunately,one must bear the sight of him baring his chest. Brain bleach is required for viewers. In the end,Henry&Lucy; marry under the chuppah (traditional Jewish wedding canopy) Doug ends up with the she-man Alexa. Henry&Lucy; eventually have a kid.""50 First Dates"" makes good traumatic comedy viewing.

817668,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001Z3TX4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","In the long line of men who act like children Adam Sandler is probably the most successful.  Here, with `50 First Dates' he gives us a good reason as to why.  Coupled with the talented Drew Barrymore he wonderfully crafts a funny yet sincere romantic comedy that whops a wallop of a tear jerking ending.  The chemistry between the two stars is impeccable and believable despite the beauty factor of Barrymore and the goofy factor of Sandler.  They work wonderfully together and Barrymore has proven to get the best out of Sandler for the second time.  Arguably their first pairing in `The Wedding Singer' is a better movie, but that's arguable since this little gem is just as funny and just as sweet.The story is one that could have gone either way in the genre department.  Barrymore's character Lucy is a beautiful Hawaiian native who attracts the attention of playboy Henry Roth, a native who entertains tourist women with good times and one night stands and loves the bachelorhood he's built for himself.  Lucy is different though, she's otherworldly to Roth in a way, so much different than the girls he's used to being with.  Lucy's main difference though is not anything Henry would have expected.  Lucy has no short term memory.  In fact she lives everyday as if it were the same day, going to sleep and waking up on her fathers birthday, the day she suffered a horrendous accident that caused her to lose her ability to remember anything after that point.  This same plotline could have made a brilliant drama, but I'm glad they went funny with this one.After Roth finds out Lucy's problem he makes a special effort each day to make her fall in love with him again, not for the sheer satisfaction of the chase but because there's something about Lucy that he can't let go of.  He loves this girl.  At first her father and brother are indifferent to the idea, opposed even, but when they see the positive effect that Henry is having on Lucy they decide that maybe this isn't such a bad idea.Adam Sandler, while still giving the audience the slapstick and comedy they are used to, delivers a more mature performance than most of his other comedic films.  His relationship with Barrymore's character is much more sympathetic then in previous films and is one the audience can get behind and cheer for.  Barrymore though upstages Sandler every step of the way delivering an on point comedic performance that will make any fan proud.  She's beautiful, sweet, sincere and hilarious.  The supporting actors all do a fine job, Rob Schneider delivering most of the big laughs as Ula the pot smoking father of a small tribe of children.  Blake Clark and Sean Astin are good as Lucy's father and brother and Pomaika'i Brown is hilarious as `tattoo face', the chief at the local restaurant where Lucy and Henry meet.There are some one-liners in this film that almost take away from the effortless hilarity of the balance of the film.  Dan Aykroyd has resorted to painful roles and this is one of them, a role littered with dialog that's hard to listen to without cringing, and that Hawaiian native who gives the audience language lessons is more than annoying.  Aside from this minor downfall the audience will have a great time watching Henry's pathetic attempts at swooning Lucy, Ula's hilarious attempts at helping him, not to mention his pathetic advice, but I'm sure nothing will give the audience more pleasure than trying to decide just what gender Henry's horny associate really is!",4,A comedy that delivers the funny with some unexpected warmth and charm...,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,3488,"['long', 'line', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'children', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'probably', 'most', 'successful', 'Here', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Coupled', 'talented', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'yet', 'sincere', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wallop', 'tear', 'jerking', 'ending', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'impeccable', 'believable', 'beauty', 'factor', 'Barrymore', 'goofy', 'factor', 'Sandler', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'Barrymore', 'proven', 'get', 'best', 'Sandler', 'second', 'time', 'Arguably', 'first', 'pairing', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'better', 'movie', 'arguable', 'little', 'gem', 'just', 'funny', 'just', 'sweet.The', 'story', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'genre', 'department', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'Lucy', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'native', 'who', 'attention', 'playboy', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'native', 'who', 'tourist', 'women', 'good', 'times', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'bachelorhood', 'built', 'Lucy', 'different', 'otherworldly', 'Roth', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'girls', 'used', 'being', 'Lucy', 'main', 'difference', 'though', 'not', 'anything', 'Henry', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Lucy', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'fact', 'everyday', 'were', 'same', 'day', 'going', 'sleep', 'waking', 'up', 'fathers', 'birthday', 'day', 'suffered', 'horrendous', 'accident', 'caused', 'lose', 'ability', 'remember', 'anything', 'point', 'same', 'plotline', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'brilliant', 'drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'went', 'funny', 'one.After', 'Roth', 'out', 'Lucy', 'problem', 'special', 'effort', 'day', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'not', 'sheer', 'satisfaction', 'chase', 'something', 'Lucy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'girl', 'first', 'father', 'brother', 'are', 'indifferent', 'idea', 'opposed', 'even', 'when', 'see', 'positive', 'effect', 'Henry', 'having', 'Lucy', 'decide', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'idea.Adam', 'Sandler', 'still', 'giving', 'audience', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'are', 'used', 'more', 'mature', 'performance', 'most', 'other', 'comedic', 'films', 'relationship', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'then', 'previous', 'films', 'one', 'audience', 'can', 'get', 'cheer', 'Barrymore', 'upstages', 'Sandler', 'step', 'way', 'delivering', 'point', 'comedic', 'performance', 'will', 'make', 'fan', 'proud', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'delivering', 'most', 'big', 'laughs', 'Ula', 'pot', 'smoking', 'father', 'small', 'tribe', 'children', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'are', 'good', 'Lucy', 'father', 'brother', 'Pomaika', 'i', 'Brown', 'hilarious', 'tattoo', 'face', 'chief', 'local', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Lucy', 'Henry', 'are', 'one-liners', 'film', 'almost', 'take', 'away', 'effortless', 'hilarity', 'balance', 'film', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'resorted', 'painful', 'roles', 'one', 'role', 'littered', 'dialog', 'hard', 'listen', 'cringing', 'Hawaiian', 'native', 'who', 'audience', 'language', 'lessons', 'more', 'annoying', 'Aside', 'minor', 'downfall', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Henry', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'swooning', 'Lucy', 'Ula', 'hilarious', 'attempts', 'helping', 'not', 'mention', 'pathetic', 'advice', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nothing', 'will', 'give', 'audience', 'more', 'pleasure', 'trying', 'decide', 'just', 'what', 'gender', 'Henry', 'horny', 'associate', 'really']",N/A

817670,A3C37W8WGMV8UQ,B0001Z3TX4,Angela Dalecki,"[9, 10]","Just when I start getting used to the cookie-cutter formula of most romantic comedy movies, a film like 50 First Dates comes along, picks me out of my seat, spins me around, and drops me back down so I don't know which way is up. I walked into the movie theater expecting this movie to be cute and funny at best-and crude and obnoxious at worst. What I found instead was a touching, sweet romantic comedy that occasionally brought tears to my eyes. Best described as Groundhog Day with a twist, this movie tells the story of a love that defies a huge and unusual obstacle.Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth: ladies' man, man's man, man about town-the love `em and leave `em type. Henry's the sort of guy most women detest-he dates a woman briefly, sleeps with her, and then tells her he's married/gay/about to be deported, etc. He's committed to his work as a veterinarian, and he's terrified of any other kind of commitment. This all changes when he meets Lucy Whitmire in a coffee shop.Drew Barrymore is Lucy, a sweet, beautiful girl with a severe handicap. She was in a car accident over a year before the story begins, and, as a result, she lost her ability to retain her short-term memory. Each night when she goes to sleep, her brain ""resets"" itself, and she wakes up each day thinking it's October 13 of the previous year-the day the accident took place.The story gets rolling when Henry not only decides that he cares about Lucy enough to have her meet and fall in love with him each day, but he also manages to convince her overprotective family and friends that he's the real deal.Sandler and Barrymore prove once again that they have unbelievable chemistry onscreen (they were also wonderful together in 1998's The Wedding Singer). They remind me a little of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc.) Although the character of Henry Roth has a softer, gentler persona than many of the characters we've seen Sandler play in the past, fans of the former SNL comedian will appreciate the subtle jokes and references to some of his earlier movies, such as Happy Gilmore. Even the requisite Sandler-composed song, ""Forgetful Lucy,"" is sweet and romantic rather than over-the-top. Drew Barrymore portrays the sweet and confused Lucy to perfection-the audience can completely understand why Henry would go to such great lengths for this girl. Sean Astin and Rob Schneider are hilarious in their supporting roles, and the film has a great soundtrack to back it up.This movie is definitely a must-see-whether you're on a first date of your own, with a long-term sweetie, or just with the gang.

Drew Barrymore plays someone who lives each day with no memory of the previous day or any other day since an accident that virtually destroyed her short-term memory (a term yet to be made perfectly clear by movies dealing therewith). Then into her life come a character played by Adam Sandler, as well as some of his friends played by similarly comic oriented actors, including Rob Schneider. Sandler's character wants to court the affections of the woman deprived of short-term memory. But how can he do that when she can meet him one day but then he's a stranger to her the next because of her condition? Well, the movie never completely explains how he can, and leaves the audience wondering if the serious part of the movie has any authenticity to it whatsoever. The young woman's doctor insists that her condition has no capacity for improvement. Nonetheless she seeems to somehow assimilate some ongoing memory, of some sort, of her suitor. She will eventually paint pictures inspired by him on days before she's seen him that day, and later remember having dreams of him. Nonetheless her new memories past a day are so vague and shadowy that the audience never gets a hint as to how they might really develop a meaningful long term relationship. For that reason, suffice it to say (without giving away too much), they do embark on a course that stretches credibility in light of her condition and leaves the audience much wanting for explanation.Not surprisingly for a movie with Adam Sandler and others of similar comic talents, there's plenty of screwball comedy (physical and otherwise) thrown in. One of Sandler's hapless friends gets caught in the torrent of massive projectile vomiting by a walrus, for example. But the screwball physical comedy goes on to even involve the movie's tragic heroine. Part of her suitor's early attempts to get to her include posing as a robbery victim, as he expects the girl of his dreams to come along and hopefully rescue him. He get's Schneider's character to pose as the robber. Unfortunately for the latter hapless character, the movie's heroine turns out to be a member of neighborhood watch, who plays hardball with offenders. As a result, the poor fake robber, who is really a friend of the fake victim, gets beaten senseless for his supposed deeds just the same as if his crimes were for real. Watching the heroine exact such ""justice"" (as far as she knows) while also sympathizing with her serious medical condition is something of a schizophrenic experience. And it is just one example of the often conflicting serious and comic elements in this uneven but sometimes appealing movie.",3,Comedy and serious theme somewhat clash,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,2848,"['When', 'movie', 'serious', 'theme', 'case', 'memory', 'loss', 'resulting', 'serious', 'accident', 'put', 'zany', 'comdey', 'disparate', 'elements', 'are', 'prone', 'clash', 'movie', 'exception', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'someone', 'who', 'day', 'memory', 'previous', 'day', 'other', 'day', 'accident', 'virtually', 'destroyed', 'short-term', 'memory', 'term', 'yet', 'be', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'movies', 'dealing', 'therewith', 'Then', 'life', 'come', 'character', 'played', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'played', 'similarly', 'comic', 'oriented', 'actors', 'including', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Sandler', 'character', 'court', 'affections', 'woman', 'deprived', 'short-term', 'memory', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'can', 'meet', 'one', 'day', 'then', 'stranger', 'next', 'condition', 'Well', 'movie', 'never', 'completely', 'how', 'can', 'audience', 'wondering', 'serious', 'part', 'movie', 'authenticity', 'whatsoever', 'young', 'woman', 'doctor', 'condition', 'capacity', 'improvement', 'somehow', 'assimilate', 'ongoing', 'memory', 'sort', 'suitor', 'will', 'eventually', 'paint', 'pictures', 'inspired', 'days', 'seen', 'day', 'later', 'remember', 'having', 'dreams', 'Nonetheless', 'new', 'memories', 'day', 'are', 'so', 'vague', 'shadowy', 'audience', 'never', 'hint', 'how', 'might', 'really', 'develop', 'meaningful', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'reason', 'suffice', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'embark', 'course', 'credibility', 'light', 'condition', 'audience', 'much', 'wanting', 'explanation.Not', 'surprisingly', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'others', 'similar', 'comic', 'talents', 'plenty', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'physical', 'otherwise', 'thrown', 'One', 'Sandler', 'hapless', 'caught', 'torrent', 'massive', 'projectile', 'vomiting', 'walrus', 'example', 'screwball', 'physical', 'comedy', 'even', 'involve', 'movie', 'tragic', 'heroine', 'Part', 'suitor', 'early', 'attempts', 'get', 'include', 'posing', 'robbery', 'victim', 'girl', 'dreams', 'come', 'along', 'hopefully', 'rescue', 'get', 'Schneider', 'character', 'pose', 'robber', 'Unfortunately', 'latter', 'hapless', 'character', 'movie', 'heroine', 'out', 'be', 'member', 'neighborhood', 'watch', 'who', 'hardball', 'offenders', 'result', 'poor', 'fake', 'robber', 'who', 'really', 'friend', 'fake', 'victim', 'beaten', 'senseless', 'supposed', 'deeds', 'just', 'same', 'crimes', 'were', 'real', 'Watching', 'heroine', 'exact', 'such', 'justice', 'as', 'far', 'also', 'sympathizing', 'serious', 'medical', 'condition', 'something', 'schizophrenic', 'experience', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'often', 'conflicting', 'serious', 'comic', 'elements', 'uneven', 'sometimes', 'appealing', 'movie']",N/A

And it's a great one.Adam plays Henry, a guy unable to commit with any woman, who lives by his own personal philosophy to not date any local girls because that means attachment. Then along comes Lucy. He's literally ""blinded by the light"" when he first sees her, and you know that after a nice long conversation about fish smells and waffle houses that Henry has met his match. Just one catch-- she'll have no clue who he is the next day.One of my initial concerns was that there would be no possible way to end this movie gracefully, let alone in a way that would please the audience. The ending is magnificent for what the movie is, and the audience will certainly be pleased.Adam has certainly found his niche. While his other films offer a whacked out Sandler, this one offers us a sweet and adorable guy that girls are sure to gush over, even with his egg shaped head.

Even tho this film looked promising, I paid it no attention. Not even when it came onto DVD. So, imagine my surprise when I actually caught it on cable the other night and ended up watching it. What a nice little movie. We're not talking Oscar-worthy here folks, but for an Adam Sandler movie, it was quite good. It's easily his best film. But that isn't necessarily saying much, is it?. Re-teaming with Drew Barrymore, his co-star from ""The Wedding Singer"", the two are a sweet and delightful duo. More films with the two of them is most welcome indeed. Sandler stars as Henry Roth, a playboy on a Hawaiian island who seems to have a way with the ladies. A lot of them. His ways change when he meets and falls for the adorable Lucy Whitmore(Barrymore). She is sweet, pretty, interesting, and all around lovely. Henry gets taken for a loop the next day when Lucy swears she has no idea who he is. Apparently, Lucy was in a car accident with her father a year ago, and she suffered major head trauma. The accident resulted in Lucy losing her short term memory. She remembers her whole life up until the accident, but anything afterwards she soon forgets the next day. As her father says, when she goes to sleep at night, her memory gets a clean sweep of the day before. Now Henry is challenged to re-introduce himself to Lucy every day and try to make her fall in love with him over and over again. It's actually a pretty clever little concept for this sweet natured comedy. The levels that her father(comedian Blake Clark), and brother Doug(Sean Astin) go too to make her think nothing has changed, is heartwarming. How everyone loves this young woman so much and tries to make everything right for her. What was surprising was that this is no ordinary Sandler/goofball comedy. It has a lot of heart, romance, and a genuine feeling for the two main characters. It is far and away better than ""The Wedding Singer"", which up to this point, was Sandler's best movie. The cast all does very well too. Astin as brother Doug, is a pumped up steroid jock with a serious speech impediment. Clarke as Mr. Whitmore has that right stern/loving/fatherly performance to him. Dan Aykroyd also has a small cameo as Lucy's doctor. You can't forget Rob Schneider. He always seems to appear in Adam's movies, and Adam always seems to appear in a small cameo in his. However lowbrow Schneider's 'comedy' may be, you can usually count on him for a few good chuckles. This one is no exception. Which leaves us with our two leads. Sandler and Barrymore have, without question, good chemistry with each other. They get along, and light up the screen. Barrymore imbues Lucy with the kind of heart, sweetness, and loveliness that doesn't make anyone question why Hnery would fall in love with you. You'd fall in love with her too!. Sandler has proven here lately that given the right role, like in ""Punch Drunk Love"" and even ""Spanglish"", that he can be a much better actor than people think. This may not be an award type performance here folks, but it's his best job in one of his zany comedies. An eclectic mix of supporting players round out the cast. The funniest being Sandler's co worker, who no one knows if they are a she or a he. Usually a joke like that gets ran into the ground, but it doesn't here. In the end, I was surprised to have seen a goofy, sweet, funny, and heart felt little comedy that is different, but yet the same, than other Sandler movies. If that makes any kind of sense. With it's nice cast, fun plot, and gorgeous scenery, this movie makes for a very pleasant evening excursion.",4,Remember Me?,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3721,"['had', 'pretty', 'much', 'gotten', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'rush', 'out', 'theater', 'see', 'new', 'flick', 'done', 'Even', 'tho', 'film', 'looked', 'promising', 'paid', 'attention', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', 'So', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'actually', 'caught', 'cable', 'other', 'night', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'What', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Oscar-worthy', 'here', 'folks', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'easily', 'best', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'saying', 'much', 'Re-teaming', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'co-star', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'two', 'are', 'sweet', 'delightful', 'duo', 'More', 'films', 'two', 'most', 'welcome', 'indeed', 'Sandler', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'playboy', 'Hawaiian', 'island', 'who', 'have', 'way', 'ladies', 'lot', 'ways', 'change', 'when', 'adorable', 'Lucy', 'Whitmore', 'Barrymore', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'around', 'lovely', 'Henry', 'taken', 'loop', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'Lucy', 'idea', 'who', 'Apparently', 'Lucy', 'was', 'car', 'accident', 'father', 'year', 'ago', 'suffered', 'major', 'head', 'trauma', 'accident', 'resulted', 'Lucy', 'losing', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'whole', 'life', 'up', 'accident', 'anything', 'afterwards', 'soon', 'next', 'day', 'father', 'when', 'sleep', 'night', 'memory', 'clean', 'sweep', 'day', 'Now', 'Henry', 'challenged', 're-introduce', 'Lucy', 'day', 'try', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'actually', 'pretty', 'clever', 'little', 'concept', 'sweet', 'natured', 'comedy', 'levels', 'father', 'comedian', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'brother', 'Doug', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'go', 'too', 'make', 'think', 'nothing', 'changed', 'heartwarming', 'How', 'everyone', 'young', 'woman', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'What', 'was', 'surprising', 'was', 'ordinary', 'Sandler/goofball', 'comedy', 'lot', 'heart', 'romance', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'far', 'away', 'better', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'Sandler', 'best', 'movie', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'Astin', 'brother', 'Doug', 'pumped', 'up', 'steroid', 'jock', 'serious', 'speech', 'impediment', 'Clarke', 'Mr.', 'Whitmore', 'right', 'stern/loving/fatherly', 'performance', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'also', 'small', 'cameo', 'Lucy', 'doctor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'always', 'appear', 'Adam', 'movies', 'Adam', 'always', 'appear', 'small', 'cameo', 'However', 'lowbrow', 'Schneider', ""'comedy"", 'may', 'be', 'can', 'usually', 'count', 'few', 'good', 'chuckles', 'one', 'exception', 'two', 'leads', 'Sandler', 'Barrymore', 'have', 'question', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'get', 'along', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'Barrymore', 'imbues', 'Lucy', 'kind', 'heart', 'sweetness', 'loveliness', ""n't"", 'make', 'anyone', 'question', 'why', 'Hnery', 'would', 'fall', 'love', ""'d"", 'fall', 'love', 'too', 'Sandler', 'proven', 'here', 'lately', 'given', 'right', 'role', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'even', 'Spanglish', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'people', 'think', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'award', 'type', 'performance', 'here', 'folks', 'best', 'job', 'one', 'zany', 'comedies', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'supporting', 'players', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'funniest', 'being', 'Sandler', 'co', 'worker', 'who', 'one', 'are', 'Usually', 'joke', 'ran', 'ground', ""n't"", 'here', 'end', 'was', 'surprised', 'have', 'seen', 'goofy', 'sweet', 'funny', 'heart', 'felt', 'little', 'comedy', 'different', 'yet', 'same', 'other', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'kind', 'sense', 'nice', 'cast', 'fun', 'plot', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'movie', 'very', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'excursion']",N/A

When it's sweet, it's very sweet, like when Drew Barrymore sings ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" at the top of her lungs while painting her father's garage because she's so smitten with Adam Sandler, or when she says ""there's nothing like a first kiss"" after they kiss for what she thinks is the first time--in three successive scenes that take place on three successive days. When it's bittersweet, or just plain sad, it actually manages to pull that off as well, though I won't give details here, so as not to spoil the plot. When it's stupidly funny, it's pretty stupid, and occasionally quite funny--how could it be otherwise, with Rob Schneider as a native Hawaiian; Sean Astin as a lisping, steroid-abusing idiot; an Eastern European of indeterminate gender; and a gigolo walrus? But all these things really don't work so well together in the same movie, except perhaps for the scene where Sandler serenades Barrymore on his ukulele at the aquarium (""You cracked your head like Gary Busey / Forgetful Lucy"").I read somewhere that, given the plot device of Lucy's short-term memory loss, this could have been another ""Groundhog Day""--that I'm not sure about. Strangely enough, I found the plot of ""50 First Dates"" *less* plausible than that of ""Groundhog Day,"" if only because the latter makes total sense if you're willing to grant that Bill Murray really is reliving one day over and over, whereas although losing one's short-term memory is entirely possible in the real world, the behavior of Lucy's friends and family is quite bizarre and illogical at times. However, this could have been a very solid romantic comedy if they had ditched the walrus vomit, ""It's Pat"" redux, and pretty much all of Sean Astin and Rob Schneider (though I do have to say, the scene in which he's chased down by Barrymore and beaten with a bat is as funny as it looks in the trailer).As it is, it's neither here nor there, so it disappoints on both counts. *Might* be worth it for a weekend matinee--probably better to wait, and rent it when it comes out on DVD.",3,Neither here nor there,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,2167,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'been', 'able', 'settle', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'run', 'When', 'sweet', 'very', 'sweet', 'when', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'sings', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Nice', 'top', 'lungs', 'painting', 'father', 'garage', 'so', 'smitten', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'when', 'nothing', 'first', 'kiss', 'kiss', 'what', 'first', 'time', 'three', 'successive', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'three', 'successive', 'days', 'When', 'bittersweet', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'details', 'here', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'plot', 'When', 'stupidly', 'funny', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'funny', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'otherwise', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'native', 'Hawaiian', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'lisping', 'steroid-abusing', 'idiot', 'Eastern', 'European', 'indeterminate', 'gender', 'gigolo', 'walrus', 'things', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'same', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'scene', 'where', 'Sandler', 'Barrymore', 'ukulele', 'aquarium', 'cracked', 'head', 'Gary', 'Busey', '/', 'Forgetful', 'Lucy', '.I', 'read', 'somewhere', 'given', 'plot', 'device', 'Lucy', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Groundhog', 'Day', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'found', 'plot', '50', 'First', 'Dates', '*less*', 'plausible', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'only', 'latter', 'total', 'sense', ""'re"", 'willing', 'grant', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'really', 'reliving', 'one', 'day', 'whereas', 'losing', 'one', 'short-term', 'memory', 'entirely', 'possible', 'real', 'world', 'behavior', 'Lucy', 'friends', 'family', 'quite', 'bizarre', 'illogical', 'times', 'However', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'solid', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'had', 'ditched', 'walrus', 'vomit', 'Pat', 'redux', 'pretty', 'much', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'scene', 'chased', 'down', 'Barrymore', 'beaten', 'bat', 'as', 'funny', 'trailer', '.As', 'here', 'there', 'counts', '*Might*', 'be', 'weekend', 'matinee', 'probably', 'better', 'wait', 'rent', 'when', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

First, Sandler basically plays himself, not some strange character like ""Little Nicky"" or ""Waterboy"".  Second, Drew Barrymore is such a sweet character on screen and the chemistry with Sandler is strong.This is closer to a romantic comedy but still retains the quirks of all Sandler films.  Rob Schneider plays a native Hawaiian with several kids and is the butt of many jokes.  Sean Astin of Rudy and The Lord of the Rings fame is hilarious as Drew Barrymore's sister.  He plays a work-out freak with a lisp.  Other things to look for include the homage to Happy Gilmore and the return of the guy who played the QB in Waterboy.50 First Dates is a good movie because despite all the wacky characters and jokes, you can sense Sandler really cares for Barrymore, and you can also see the love and effort Astin and Barrymore's father put forth in protecting Barrymore from the realization that everyday is a new day and she'll never have a memory of the past.",4,Sandler at his best!,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1064,"['50', 'First', 'Dates', 'charming', 'movie', 'out', 'Sandler', 'other', 'work', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'Sandler', 'basically', 'not', 'strange', 'character', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'Waterboy', 'Second', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'such', 'sweet', 'character', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Sandler', 'strong.This', 'closer', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'still', 'quirks', 'Sandler', 'films', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'native', 'Hawaiian', 'several', 'kids', 'butt', 'many', 'jokes', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Rudy', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fame', 'hilarious', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'sister', 'work-out', 'freak', 'lisp', 'Other', 'things', 'look', 'include', 'homage', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'return', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'QB', 'Waterboy.50', 'First', 'Dates', 'good', 'movie', 'wacky', 'characters', 'jokes', 'can', 'sense', 'Sandler', 'really', 'Barrymore', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'love', 'effort', 'Astin', 'Barrymore', 'father', 'put', 'forth', 'protecting', 'Barrymore', 'realization', 'everyday', 'new', 'day', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'memory', 'past']",N/A

I love ""Happy Gilmore"" as well as ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" which are two very different movies that are good for very different reasons.  ""Happy Gilmore"" is simply good-natured broad comedy that keeps the laughs coming, and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an unusual low-budget drama that demonstrates that Sandler is a good actor as well as a good comedian.""50 First Dates"" falls somewhere between those two films in terms of tone and of Sandler's character.  It has many funny parts (including a great golf bit for us ""Happy Gilmore"" fans), but takes the time to establish Sandler's character.  He delivers a great performance.  So does Drew Barrymore, whose inherent likeability really shines.  She is very believable in this role, which calls for her to have quite different responses to Sandler at quite different times.Perhaps the biggest flaw in this movie is the instant change in Sandler's character from an island Casanova to a devoted one-woman man when he meets Barrymore.  However, I just didn't dwell on it too much; the film would also have us believe that he lives in an apartment in a marine park that has a window opening onto the big aquarium tank, which is ultimately far less believable (although it is pretty cool).The cinematography is beautiful!  This movie looks far more cinematic than most comedies, which are often shot as if they were made for television.  The colors are bright and rich, and Hawaii has rarely looked more like paradise.

817691,AETS5ZMP2EM1U,B0001Z3TX4,Canary,"[7, 8]","This is a charming, increasingly romantic movie about a brain-damaged woman (Drew Barrymore) who loses her memory of the current day as soon as she goes to sleep. So when a marine veterinarian (Adam Sandler) falls for her, he has to woo her afresh each new day. Since I don't care for most of Sandler's juvenile humor and flabby acting, I was very surprised to find that I like not only this story, but Sandler as the love interest. Here, he is neither slack-jawed nor whiny, but somebody likeable enough to root for. Although the plot sounds contrived to be sort of Groundhog Day meets Memento -- this story feels like it maybe coulda happened, because of Drew's emotional range and the chemistry of the stars. The story often  is funny in a silly way -- love the great kids and animals! -- and all the parts were well cast, including Astin and Schneider (who I did not recognize until reading the credits). For me, the film got better and more involving as it built, and it was ultimately satisfying and touching as Sandler figured out a way to adapt the relationship to his love's limitations.

He works in Hawaii, and usually dates the tourists that visit there, but he never wants to commit to a long-term relationship. Henry just wants to date women and leave them. He lies to them saying that he has to leave the country or that he is a secret agent on a top secret assignment. One morning while going for breakfast at a local cafe he meets Lucy  (played by Drew Barrymore) and there is instant attraction between the both of them. After they talked they promised to meet at the same cafe for breakfast the following day. Next day comes Henry, sees Lucy, but lucy doesn't remember who Henry is and gets freaked out. We Find out that Lucy was in a car accident, which caused her some brain damage. The brain damage affects her short-term memory (though her long-term memory is still intact). Lucy forgets things following day. Lucy lives with her dad and brother who are protective of her because they don't have sleazy men to take advantage of lucy's memory lapses (or use her for sex only). Henry is love-struck however, and he is determined to prove to them all that his feeling for Lucy are real. Every day he introduces himself to Lucy and get her to fall in love with him. He always has to start over the next day, it may sound repetitous, but they added different scenes to make the dates feel and look different each time. Sandler detracts from the man/child character typecast from his other movies: this time Adam Sandler's character becomes sweet and honest because he is in real love , he realized that Lucy is that ""special someone"" so he persistant and patient. Drew Barrymore's character is charming, funny and sweet, there is excellent chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler, they are both very funny and lovable. Since the movie takes place in Hawaii, the scenes are beautiful and enhance the romantic mood. Complimented with a bunch of wacky supporting characters and a surprise ending!

That's exactly what the tagline of ""50 First Dates"" suggests to its' audience. This film also suggests it can take a serious medical diagnosis all in good-natured humor, without offending anyone. The dilemma of one Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) is subject to the above tagline, and this young, good-natured, fun-loving gal must begin a life anew each and every day, as a result of her short-term memory loss, which she sustained in an automobile accident en route to her regular weekly pineapple picking ritual, which Lucy had done with her father prior to her accident. She happens to catch the eye of a young, promiscuous veterinarian (Adam Sandler), whose attempts to get to know Lucy, as well as attempting to help fix her medical condition, garner mixed results, of both the hilarious and tear-jerking variety. Also on board, are Lucy's father (Blake Clark) and brother (Sean Astin), with both of them doing their best to help their daughter/sister cope with her difficult struggle, while becoming more skeptical of Lucy's newfound confidant, Henry Roth (Sandler). Pomai'kai Brown (as Hukilau Cafe Chef), Amy Hill (as cafe owner Sue), Dan Aykroyd (as an M.D.) and Joe Nakashima (as wiseacre Old Hawaiian Man) provide added comic relief, making ""50 First Dates"" an important must-see film.

I think Jon-Mark was spot-on when he wrote, ""The movie has the same humour as Adam's previuos movies but it just as funny none the less"". Do not think this movie is some huge turnaround for Sandler, as some critics believed ""Punch Drunk Love"" to be. It still carries the same old Sandler humour, but like alot of his recent films, Sandler shows a little more of that charming side that he always had inside him, only is was very subtle and hidden in his ""Billy Madison"" ""Happy Gilmore"" type performances. Here that side gets a bit more of a showing, though it's interspersed with the usual crude gross-out jokes just to let you know that you are watching a Sandler film and didn't rent out the wrong movie. Sure, it's maybe more romantic and ""touching"" than some of his other films, but there's all the usual wierdo, disgusting characters and such.

As far as Sandler's movies go, this is the best in my opinion, which is not to say much, since I think he made quite a few mediocre ones.  The story is about a guy (Adam) who falls in love with a girl that, since an accident a year earlier, has not been able to gain any new memories past the current day.  The accident was on her father's birthday, so she thinks everyday of the year is it, making everyone around her put on a show.  A little unbelievable, but the movie does make the story work quite nicely.In 50 First Dates, the viewer sees a side to Adam Sandler that is not known; he does his usual physical and witty comedy, but he also demonstrates a sensitive side.  Drew Barrymore also is very funny, though her character is by nature a strange one (with no memory beyond a day).  The supporting cast is outstading, especially Rob Schneider, who definitely adds to the comic nature of the movie.The story is also a very creative one, with a couple of loose ends but that can be overseen.  For example, Lucy (Drew) is shocked when she first finds out that the life she is living is not real; the next time she finds out, she is a little less shocked, and even less the next time, when we know there should be no diference, since she has no memory of the previous day.Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes comedy.

After all, how long can a movie with one gag (the girl has no short-term memory and has multiple ""first dates"" with the same guy) sustain itself? Thankfully, I recently decided to overcome my initial reaction and watched the movie.Above all, it is far better than its premise. Yes, there are some implausibilities, which I will note momentarily. However, Adam Sandler does a great job as Henry Roth, a fellow who has the reputation of being the quintessential ""take 'em and leave 'em"" guy of falling, but who falls in love with Lucy (Drew Barrymore), who has no memory from one day to the next, a result of a car accident a year earlier. (One cannot help but note the irony of his ongoing infatuation with a woman who effectively dumps him every night and must be wooed from the start the next morning.)Despite the obstacles in maintaining an ongoing relationship with Lucy, Henry finds creative ways of ""meeting"" and establishing a relationship with her day after day. Over time, their relationship grows and becomes a truly deep, permanent relationship that overcomes the seemingly insurmountable obstacles.It is true that one has to suspend one's disbelief at times. Lucy's brother and father have taken it upon themselves to protect her from finding out about her condition. In order to do this, they do everything they can to recreate the day of her accident. The accident happens to have occurred on her father's birthday, and so every day they have a cake. She gives her dad the same present every day. And so forth. Moreover, her father somehow has had the foresight to buy hundreds of copies of the local newspaper with the date of his birthday on it, so that it appears to Lucy that it truly is her dad's birthday. In fact, given how much effort her father and brother put into perpetrating this ruse, one wonders how they find any time to work.Despite this and some other improbabilities, this is a truly heartwarming movie.

He always seems to play the same type of characters like in those movies as well. They are usually shot by the critics. Even in ""Punch Drunk Love"" he plays the character, but that was hailed by critics. But then there is ""50 First Dates"" where he and actress Drew Barrymoore reunite, except it is not your usual Adam Sandler. Normally he is a good natured man, who has a hidden violent temper. But in this movie he shows the sweet side of him. It was a nice change, even though all of his past movies are still great. Sander and Barrymoore first acted together in ""The Wedding Singer"" and worked well off of each other in that, and in this. Two very talented celebrities working well equals a great movie.Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, the kind of guy who likes who go out with a women one day, and then leave them the next day. He works with animals, and likes to hang out with his friend Ula. He doesn't want to settle down with a women, because he has a job to travel to the artic and study the walrus. But in a diner run by Sue and the cook Nick, he meets Lucy Whitmore a beautiful blonde women who spends a mourning with Henry, causing him to fall in love. The plan to have breakfast the next mourning, but when he shows up, she has no idea who he is. Sue tells Henry that she was in a car accident about a year ago, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She remember everythings that happened before the car crash. So everyday she thinks that it is the day of her accident, causing her to do the same thing every single day. With her docotr, Dr. Keats, knowing that there is nothing to cure Lucy, everyday is the same, only she doesn't know that. Her father Martin, and her brother Doug, also go to the extremes to make everything the same each day, except when they find out about Henry's intentions, they become nervous that he will ruin everything that they do everyday. But everyday, Henry falls deeper and deeper into love with Lucy, except that she has no idea who he is 24 hours later. From that point on, he goes to the extremes to try and remind her who he is every single day.""50 First Dates"" has a very funny idea, and the entire film works. There is not even any gross humor, except for the beginning when a walrus vomits on another person. Alot of the comedy comes from Ula, played by comedian Rob Schneider, who has five children, all of them smarter then he is.

This romantic comedy is quirky, cute and absolutely sugar sweet. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have onscreen chemistry that rivals Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in this movie about a woman who is forced to live in the past because each day is like a repeat of the day before.Injured in an auto accident years ago, Barrymore is now being cared for by her father and brother, who take precautions to make sure every day is exactly the same. Why? Because for Drew Barrymore is IS exactly the same. Every night she goes to sleep and every morning she wakes up with no memory of the day that has just passed. She thinks it is the morning of her car wreck. (Note: she has no memory of the wreck. She thinks it is apparently the time frame BEFORE the wreck... It is as if the trauma of the wreck is simply too much for her mind to grasp. )When Adam Sandler steps into the picture, things begin to change. Subtle differences occur, much in the same way difference occur for Bill Murray, a la Groundhog's Day. Ultimately what transpires is a deepening of affection and a crossroads in life.Adam Sandler must choose. Can he truly live with a woman who can't remember him? If she can't remember him, how can she truly love him? Some how it all works out and the conclusion is both funny and tear-jerking.This is not a bad date movie if I do say so myself.",5,She only sings on days after she's been with you....,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1407,"['know', 'messed', 'line', 'up', 'somehow', 'sentiment', 'same', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quirky', 'cute', 'absolutely', 'sugar', 'sweet', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'have', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'forced', 'live', 'past', 'day', 'repeat', 'day', 'before.Injured', 'auto', 'accident', 'years', 'ago', 'Barrymore', 'now', 'being', 'cared', 'father', 'brother', 'who', 'take', 'precautions', 'make', 'sure', 'day', 'exactly', 'same', 'Why', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'IS', 'exactly', 'same', 'Every', 'night', 'sleep', 'morning', 'up', 'memory', 'day', 'just', 'passed', 'morning', 'car', 'wreck', 'Note', 'memory', 'wreck', 'apparently', 'time', 'frame', 'wreck', 'trauma', 'wreck', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'mind', 'grasp', 'When', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'picture', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'Subtle', 'differences', 'occur', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'difference', 'occur', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'la', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'deepening', 'affection', 'crossroads', 'life.Adam', 'Sandler', 'must', 'choose', 'Can', 'truly', 'live', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'can', 'truly', 'love', 'how', 'out', 'conclusion', 'funny', 'tear-jerking.This', 'not', 'bad', 'date', 'movie', 'do', 'say', 'so']",N/A

The story is set in Hawaii, so plenty of those nice, evocative sunsets. Barrymore is Lucy Whitmore, a cheerful art teacher whose automobile accident severely damages her temporal lobe, this causing her to relive the same day over and over (think of it as a less wintry GROUNDHOG DAY). Blake Clark and Sean Astin are terrific as, respectively, her father and brother, who sacrifice their lives to play along, resetting things at the end of every damn night, so that Lucy's life is made as uncomplicated as possible. No surprises for Lucy, goes the mandate. She wakes up to the same day, which is her father's birthday. But what's fair, really? And how do you toe that moral line between easing a devastating trauma and outright living a lie?In steps Henry Roth, womanizing feller and yet sympathetic. Henry is a marine-life vet working at an aquatic park which means we're privy to amusing animal shenanigans with the walrus and the dolphins and such. Adam Sandler plays Henry as quite likable and I even buy that he falls so hard for Lucy that he foregoes his lecherous, commitment-phobic ways. And what strikes a girl's fancy swifter than the notion of a guy having to win the same girl every day all over again. As for the tone of the film, it's not as much that Sandler's leaning for crude frat-boy humor is toned down as much as it's mitigated by an underpinning of warmth. And, really, put that down to Drew Barrymore. As in THE WEDDING SINGER, Sandler and the marvelously expressive Barrymore demonstrate an irresistible chemistry. These two make a fun, fun couple.Thing is, I'm still the kind of guy who busts a gut at sophomoric gags. I think Rob Scneider is awesome as Ula, Henry's good-natured but pretty messed-up assistant; he provides plenty of the belly laughs. Surprisingly, Sean Astin, not exactly acclaimed for the funny, is hilarious as Lucy's roided-up brother. Throw in Sandler's sweet ""Forgetful Lucy"" song and a great surprise ending, and 50 FIRST DATES crosses off key items on the checklist: a head-turning premise; a terrific cast; a winning romance; a touch of heartbreak; a picturesque tropical setting; and laugh-out-loud humor.

817759,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B0001Z3TX4,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 7]","Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in this wonderfully funny film about true love overcoming any obstacle.Sandler stars as Harry Roth, a veterinarian at a Hawaiian zoo who meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) while having breakfast one morning.  Harry is immediately attracted to Lucy, and they agree to meet again the next day.  However, when Harry arrives back at the restaurant, Lucy has no memory of the previous day, or meeting Harry.The owner of the restaurant immediately calls Lucy's father, and he explains to Harry that Lucy is suffering from a brain disorder  suffered in a car accident.  Her short-term memory lasts for only 24 hours, after which she forgets everything that happened the previous day.  Harry is forced to introduce himself to Lucy every morning, and the entire process repeats itself.  However, he has devised some ways to try to jar Lucy's suppressed memories by making a video of the events that have happened since her accident.Little by little, Lucy seems to be remembering other things.  She has also begun to keep a journal of each day she spends with Harry so she will remember later.  They are also falling in love with each other.  However, Lucy approaches Harry one day and tells him she wants to break off their relationship because she doesn't think its fair for him to have to go through the same routine every day.  She then checks herself into a hospital for patients with brain disorders.  Meanwhile, Harry has decided to leave on his trip that he's been planning to study marine wildlife.  Will Lucy remember her accident and what has happened since?  Will Harry be able to convince Lucy he loves her despite her problems?This is an excellent movie.  Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are terrific together, and their chemistry is first-rate.  The comedy is very funny, and the supporting actors, especially the wise-cracking old Hawaiian man in the restaurant, do a very good job.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting is great, and the story is very funny, but it does have a serious side as well.  The aspect of Lucy's disorder is handled in a funny, yet compassionate way throughout the film.  This is a great movie for couples to watch.  Its not just a ""chick flick""; I enjoyed it just as much as my wife did.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.

It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterizations didn't quite fit with what was to come. Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the viewers, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.Go ahead and watch this film chances you will enjoy it.

In this one, he's teamed up with Drew Barrymore in a very unfunny attempt to capture some of what they had with The Wedding Singer. It is lost on me. Rob Schneider is about the funny character in this movie, and even that is a stretch. The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler is terrible, similar to chemistry you'd find on a high school stage.Essentially, its a romantic comedy without the comedy. OR really the romance for that matter. Barrymore suffers from short term amnesia and Sandler attempts to date her despite this. The best preformance is turned in by a steroid abusing Sean Astin who plays Barrymore's older brother. Sandler is highlighted as the hopeless romantic and creates numerous ways to worm his way into Barrymore's life.Aside form lacking any particular acting ability, this movie does not even tap into the talents the actors do actually have. Rather than utilize the sight-gags, sarcasm, and slapstick that made Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison great, this movie tried to set up running jokes and scripted humor that just didn't cut it.There is nothing redeeming about this movie, and if you must see it, wait until it comes out on video. Or see it for the previews. There were a few interesting movies coming out, and the trailers definitely highlighted this experience for me.

Sometimes these embarrassments bring down what promises to be an enjoyable piece of entertainment.  The embarrassment in this movie is Adam Sandler himself.If you like Adam Sandler, if you like his gutter humor, then you might actually like this movie.  I, on the other hand, found Sandler grossly miscast as leading man Henry Roth.  I found the first 15 minutes of the movie very painful to watch because of the walrus vomit, the pointless androgynous character, and the lowbrow sexual comments.  To me it felt like Adam Sandler said, ""Hey, my fans won't like this movie if I don't put some of this stuff in because that's what they like.""  I must say I almost turned it off and threw it away because of the humor (I received it as a Secret Santa gift).But I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did.  Drew Barrymore is the saving angel of this film.  She plays Lucy Whitmore, a young woman who was in a car crash about a year earlier and, as a result of head injuries, can no longer turn short-term memories into long-term memories.  She is a blank slate every morning, and Sandler's character has to get her to fall in love with him every single day.  Barrymore shows a true acting ability by carefully walking a tightrope from making Lucy either too pathetic or too comic.  She brings warmth and sensitivity to the role and certainly makes up for what Sandler doesn't have.  She is also drop-dead gorgeous, and that doesn't hurt at all.That isn't to say Sandler doesn't have some good moments so long as it fits the movie.  One scene I laughed at was his second meeting with Lucy.  He's unaware of her memory problem and says he spent the whole night thinking about her while he stroked his walrus.  The double entendre (and Drew Barrymore's classic reaction) was well done AND appropriate to the movie.Here's my problem.  Sandler can't act.  He is as wooden as William Shatner and just about as funny as well.  I liked the fact that he isn't a good looking guy and even pokes fun at himself by telling Lucy that he's sorry he's not better looking.  It just proves that even us average Joes can fall in love and get the girl.  Too often he falls into his SNL schtick (which I never liked) and threatens to pull the entire movie down with it.A minor problem I have is Rob Schneider.  How could they cast him as Sandler's Hawaiian best friend, Hula?  Was there no truly Hawaiian actor who could have played the part?  This reminds me of a time 15 years with the musical Miss Saigon when the acting union protested the casting of a Caucasian as a Eurasian.The last half hour of the film is the best (though Sandler does, sadly, do his gutter schtick on occasion -- somebody should tell him that raising his voice is not acting).

A marine biologist, Sandler (yes, he's Henry Roth, but really, he's Sandler playing the best Sandler of any of his movies where he's also playing Sandler). Instead of being bored meeting and leaving his next conquest, he focuses all his attention on this sweet young woman who cannot remember him the next day--a real challenge to a player. Her innocence triggers something deep inside and he actually falls in love with her.Every time she sees him, it is the ""first"" time she meets him. He is forced to woo her without the usual payoff at the end of the date. His dream is to take a boat he has been preparing for sea as a Calypso and explore the oceans. The two dreams finally merge. But getting there takes 50 first dates, so to speak, and fifty first kisses.Dad and brother (Sean Astin) help Drew to forget the car accident by restaging the last day before the accident day after day after.... Before she meets Henry, she relives the same day over and over. Henry becomes a catalyst for change. When she leaves to live in a rehabilitation center, she paints Henry over and over without knowing who he is or why she paints him.This movie is not intellectually challenging. It is not one chase scene after the other. There are no villains.

I really enjoyed Punch Drunk Love and since I loved the Wedding Singer, I decided to give 50 First Dates a shot.

He dreams of taking his boat to Alaska to study walruses and one day while taking his boat for a 'test drive' it breaks down and he gets stuck on another part of the island waiting for someone to come tow it.  He stops in a diner where he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore).  He really likes her and they make plans to meet again the next day.  The next day she has no clue who he is, and that's when he finds out that she suffered brain damage in an accident a year before and has no short term memory.  Every night when she goes to sleep, it erases everything that happened that day.  Every morning she wakes up thinking it's the exact same day.I love the chemistry beween Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, the two of them are fun to watch together.  Once they met and started romancing, the movie got much better.  The scenes that were unbearably bad were some with the supporting actors, especially the absolutely terrible character, Alexa I think was her name, that was Henry's assistant at work (the horrible mannish looking woman with braids).  The scenes with her were just awful and I would probably have given this movie another star if not for that.A couple side characters that were really funny were Rob Schneider as Ula, who was funny - though his five kids really stole the show.  Also, Sean Astin (Samwise in Lord of the Rings) had a part as Lucy's steroid-using brother with a lisp and he was pretty funny as well.  Dan Aykroyd played Lucy's doctor and though his part was small, he had some of the funniest lines in the movie!Overall, I thought it was a funny movie.  I especially like the ending, since I was expecting a cop-out Hollywood ending and didn't get it. ;) Despite some really bad scenes in the beginning, the movie turns around and becomes a heart-warming love story between Henry and Lucy which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I do recommend seeing it, but I definitely think the Wedding Singer is by far a superior movie with the same lead actors. :)",3,Not as bad as I thought it would be...,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,2479,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'impressed', 'choices', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'loved', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'decided', 'give', '50', 'First', 'shot', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'Rotton', 'Tomatoes', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'vet', 'marine', 'animals', 'Hawaii', 'who', 'woo', 'tourists', 'so', 'never', 'settle', 'down', 'taking', 'boat', 'Alaska', 'study', 'walruses', 'one', 'day', 'taking', 'boat', ""'test"", 'drive', 'down', 'stuck', 'part', 'island', 'waiting', 'someone', 'come', 'tow', 'diner', 'where', 'Lucy', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'really', 'make', 'plans', 'meet', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'next', 'day', 'clue', 'who', 'when', 'out', 'suffered', 'brain', 'damage', 'accident', 'year', 'before', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'Every', 'night', 'when', 'sleep', 'everything', 'happened', 'day', 'morning', 'up', 'thinking', 'exact', 'same', 'day.I', 'chemistry', 'beween', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'two', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'together', 'met', 'started', 'romancing', 'movie', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'scenes', 'were', 'unbearably', 'bad', 'were', 'supporting', 'actors', 'especially', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'character', 'Alexa', 'think', 'was', 'name', 'was', 'Henry', 'assistant', 'work', 'horrible', 'mannish', 'looking', 'woman', 'braids', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'star', 'not', 'that.A', 'couple', 'side', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'funny', 'were', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Ula', 'who', 'was', 'funny', 'five', 'kids', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'Also', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Samwise', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'had', 'part', 'Lucy', 'steroid-using', 'brother', 'lisp', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'played', 'Lucy', 'doctor', 'part', 'was', 'small', 'had', 'funniest', 'lines', 'movie', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'especially', 'ending', 'was', 'expecting', 'cop-out', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'really', 'bad', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'movie', 'around', 'heart-warming', 'love', 'story', 'Henry', 'Lucy', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'do', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'definitely', 'think', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'same', 'lead', 'actors']",N/A

The producers of this film have cast him as some kind of sex magnet, the sort of role Cary Grant used to play.  Anyhow, once he meets and falls head over heels for Drew, he becomes more plausible.  Indeed she is charming, though her disease, as Dan Aykroyd explains it, is kind of tragic.The director Peter Segal who made ANGER MANAGEMENT, again with Adam, has performed a subtler job this time around.

After seeing the trailers I thought the movie would be absolutely horrible since I am neither a Sandler or a Barrymore fan but, under protest I rented this movie expecting profanity and cheap jokes. But, I was toatlly blown away this is one of those movies where you'll laugh and you'll fall in love. It's not what you expect!In this movie Barrymore plays Lucy a quirky, funny, girl whose life is turned upside down by a sudden accident that is left her unable to remember what happens each day... even forgetting the guy of her dreams- Sandler. As Sandler's love for Lucy grows he must continue to see her persuing her each day somedays she loves him and other days she ignores him. When Sandler learns that Lucy's father and brother make her relive the same day everyday. Sandler takes action into his own hands deciding to tell her the truth through a video he makes for Lucy adding new bits everyday and Lucy keeps a journal of all their interaction. Barrymore and Sandler make the perfect couple in this feel-good comedy/romance where everytime they kiss it's a first kiss. Lucy finally decides to erase Sandler from her mind completely tearing up journal entires and the good morning Lucy video tapes. By the end of this romantic comedy you'll find yourself asking yourself would you fall in love with the same person everyday?This movie is all about the extent we will go to for the ones we love.Adam Sandler is toatlly differant this film than any other and he will charm you in this un-expected, sweet, funny, love story and it's such a refreshing break-away from his roles in ""Big Daddy"", and ""Happy Gillmore."" I found myself falling in love with him. Barrymore also gives a good performance as Lucy who makes pancake houses and goes after attackers.

817800,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001Z3TX4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[52, 63]","You know those movies where you see the trailer in the theater and then when you see the actual movie you discover all the good parts were in the trailer?  Well, ""50 First Dates"" is not one of those movies.  In fact, I can make the argument that while the trailer may indeed have most of the funniest moments in this film, it most decidedly does not have any of the best moments of the film.  When you see the trailer about this movie in which Adam Sandler has to make a first impression on Drew Barrymore every day because she has no short term memory and wakes up every morning forgetting what happened the previous day, you would think that he discovers this the next morning when she wakes up in bed with a stranger and starts screaming.  However, I am happy to report, ""50 First Dates"" is not that movie either.I have been trying to think of last time a movie prompted tears in my eyes as often as ""50 First Dates.""  We know that Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) no longer has any short term memory because of a car accident, but what we learn before we meet Lucy is that Henry Roth (Sandler) is apparently the king of the love 'em and leave 'em of the Hawaiian islands.  Thus the great irony is that he falls for the one woman who can forget him faster and more completely than any tourist he has ever dumped.  What we also learn about are the extraordinary lengths to which Lucy's family and friends go make each day the same happy day for her.  Lucy's brother Doug (Sean Astin) needs to lay off the steroids but her father (Blake Clark) is fiercely and lovingly protective of his daughter.  Watching everything that he and his son do each night to reset the stage for Lucy's happy day got me big time.Unlike ""Groundhog Day,"" which only had a few minor flaws in logic (e.g., why does the music teacher claim Bill Murray as a student at the end?) there are giant holes in ""50 First Dates"" (e.g., how do the three guys manage to every day free to take care of Lucy?), but I do not care.  The gaps are covered in just too many sweet and touching moments for me to object to George Wing's screenplay.  The reason why I did not give ""50 First Dates"" is mainly because of the character of Ula (Rob Schneider), who represents the traditional ""Adam Sandler"" type of comedy in this film.  There are a few moments where Sandler goes over the top (basically anytime his voice gets to the yelling level), but I could forgive most of those (the last song he sings redeems much), but every time Ula showed up it was like clips from another movie.  The last time he shows up in the film I was really not happy to see him there because he was ruining a moment I had been eagerly awaiting.One of the impressive things about this movie is that it does not cop out.  Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd), Lucy's doctor, tells us repeatedly that Lucy is never going to get better and a lot of the power of this movie comes from the different ways in which Lucy and Howard deal with this hard reality.  We also learn that for Lucy and his family there are what her dad calls ""bad"" days, and it because of them that Henry is inspired to try something different and provide another series of sweet moments in the film.  As long as he refrains from going into overdrive, Sandler makes it totally believable that Henry would spend every day trying to get Lucy to fall in love with him.  But it is Barrymore who is pitch perfect on both the comedy and the pathos of her role as Lucy.  If Sandler did not know that he had found his perfect leading lady after ""The Wedding Singer,"" then this film should do the trick.The tagline for this film is ""Imagine having to win over the girl of your dreams... every friggin' day"" is a funny line, but it is as much misdirection as the trailer.  Henry may treat his strange assistant Alexa (Lusia Strus) badly, but he could not possibly be more patient with Lucy.  Even her skeptical father has to admit that he and Henry are kindred spirits.  Because this is Adam Sandler we keep waiting for him to try and take advantage of the situation, but, to repeat myself, this is not that film.  Yes, ""Groundhog Day"" is the better movie, but ""50 First Dates"" is also full of grace and more importantly the film finds of way of delivering on its promise.  First kisses might be the sweetest of all, but in this film it is the last date that makes you surrender on the off chance you manage to hold off that long.",4,"Yes, I laughed.

Unfortunately for her father, that day is his birthday, so he is stuck with birthday cakes every single day.Her father and brother (played hilariously by Sean Astin - Sam from Lord of the Rings) have tried various techniques over the weeks and found that she does best when they simply play along with her faulty memory. They give her an old newspaper, take her birthday present, watch her favorite movie with her, and so on. They expect to have keep doing this with her, every day, until she either heals or they pass away.You can see pretty quickly that this wasn't a great long time plan, but you also feel for the dad and brother. They obviously love Drew and want to keep her happy. They resist at first when Adam begins to get into her life, but they realize how much the two care for each other. Adam starts to make ""wake up videos"" for Drew, so that when she first wakes up in the morning she can be gently brought up to date with the life she isn't able to remember.There are a few ""silly / gross"" jokes in here - almost as if the movie was made for young teens - but then there are also a number of sexual jokes / puns that are probably not appropriate for that age group. I thought in that sense that Wedding Singers was much better done, with an awesome balance of maturity and fun. This movie slides just a little bit into the immature category.But that is vastly made up for by the gorgeous Oahu scenery. If you're lucky enough to make it to Hawaii, you can see many of the locations used in the movie. Sea Life Park might be a good spot to add to your list! Locals also say that the Ula character is pretty dead-on as far as the laid back, casual attitude that is prevalent here.I've watched this movie MANY times and it definitely has become one I enjoy greatly. There are many great lines, and the inappropriate jokes are easy to gloss over.

The basic concept was rip-off from Bill Murray's fantastic Groundhog Day but unlike that movie where the plot and characters evolved, in First 50 Dates, nothing changes. The characters remains as they were and things become pretty redundant by the half way point.On a positive side, I thought Drew Barrymore was fantastic and her effort made my wallet felt better as the movie rolled along. Rob Schnieder and the animals at Sea Life Park were far more funnier then Sandler himself who I think was actually trying to act seriously for brief moment or two. I think even Sandler might have been miscast, not for a moment, did I thought he was the Casanova of the Islands as the begining of the movie was trying to tell us.Romantic fantasy at its worst, nothing on the screen was really real or remotely close to being believable.

Adam's character does not realize this at first, but when he does, he tries EVERYDAY to help Lucy cope with finding out about the accident.What follows is absolutely the SWEETEST thing you could ever imagine someone doing in this situation.

She's had an auto accident, and every morning when she wakes up, she thinks it's the morning of the auto accident.  Essentially the same condition as the hero in &quot;Memento&quot;, except where his memory lasted minutes at best, Barrymore can remember everything she learned that day - until she goes to sleep again.  Mercifully, she's not as bad as the &quot;10 Second Tom&quot; character we meet in the movie.That device sets us up for endless variations for Adam Sandler to get Drew to become interested in him over and over again - reminiscent of Groundhog Day.The &quot;formula&quot; of romantic comedy is guy meets girl, they fall in love, some contrivance tears them apart, (at this point usually the female heads for an airport as the male suddenly remembers that he's in a romantic comedy and he has to run willy-nilly to and through the airport in an effort to tell her what a dunderhead he's been and how much he really loves her before the credits roll.)The formula is toyed with a little bit in this movie, and to everyone's credit, they make it interesting.  Since Lucy wakes up every morning not remembering anything since the car crash, and her memory condition is permanent, we begin to wonder how things will end.

817816,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0001Z3TX4,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Far too many have written off Adam Sandler as a one note performer whose draw as a feature film star is more based on luck than talent. The funny thing is that with all of his detractors, he continues to put out solid films that do well at the box office and more importantly, with his fans. While many of his films have depicted a bungler who runs into good fortune, perhaps his biggest hit involved an attempt to revive the romantic comedy in THE WEDDING SINGER. Now Sandler reunites with his co-star of that film, Drew Barrymore, and shows that the genre is still a valid one.Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet at an aquarium in Hawaii. He plays life fast and loose, finding a new woman nearly every day and presenting himself as something he is not. Yes, Henry is a player who loves a one night stand. Until fortune sets him on course with the love of his life, Lucy (Barrymore).Meeting by chance at a local restaurant over breakfast, the pair hit it off from the start. The attraction is a strong one, so much so that they make plans to meet the next day for breakfast again. But at that meeting, Lucy acts as if she has no idea who Henry is. A quick chat with the owner and Henry finds out that Lucy is suffering from a rare brain disorder.It seems that she was in an accident a year earlier and the damaged tissue in her brain is that responsible for short term memory. She retains all of her memories prior to the crash but nothing after it. Each day begins as that morning she set out with her father. Her father (Blake Clarke) and brother (Sean Astin) have been perpetuating the myth by passing off the duplicates of that day's newspaper while the family friends at the restaurant keep her thinking it is that day as well.Her family tries to chase Henry off, but he is so smitten that he continues to find ways to see Lucy. Then one day her father calls him over to talk to him. Noticing that she only sings the song that was he and his late wife's song on the days she meets with Henry, they think that perhaps she is making some progress. And so he begins to encourage the couple seeing each other.Then Henry gets an idea. He makes a video for Lucy to watch each morning, showing her what is going on and letting her know what is happening. Each morning becomes a first date for the couple, each kiss a first kiss.When Lucy discovers that Henry has canceled a trip to do research in Alaska to stay and be there for her, she makes a decision. She asks Henry to help her erase all of her memories of him from her journal so that she will forget Henry. In doing so, he would be free to fulfill his plans. Can these two find a way to make the relationship work?This film works on all levels. It is a funny comedy showing the different ways that Henry tries to approach Lucy and win her favor day after day. And it works as a romance because no matter how he does it, he always gets Lucy to fall in love at first sight with him each day. It's a feel good movie that offers a unique twist in the solution it poses by film's end.Sandler does a great job here, not playing the usual buffoon that he does, but showing a soft romantic side. He is growing as an actor and does a great job. The same can be said of Barrymore who has become a much more gifted actress than I think many would have expected of her.The movie is a great family film with only a few touches here and there that might yield themselves for further explanation with the kids at a later date. But on the whole, it is funny, touching and moving for the adults.If you're looking for a good time while watching a movie, then this is the one to pick.

After the horrible Along Came Polly, which came out at the same time, I thought this film was going to be as awful, or worse. Not so. Despite a ridiculous plot, 50 First Dates works, perhaps because Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have such great chemistry. There are a few scattered laughs here and there but what really works for the film are the dramatic aspects. The film comes across as light and fluffy but the plot is very serious and I feel it played best as a drama, rather than a comedy. There are some great dramatic moments that really worked and gave the characters emotional depth, something we don't see often in romantic comedies. The film is funny enough and very sweet, so it does have that perfect balance, which is a big plus.The beautiful Hawaiian locations and terrific supporting cast really add to the film and make it more special. This is one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I have ever seen. It's not a brilliant film, but it's very cute and great fun, and a big improvement over other romantic comedies.

Like a big dog, it is sometimes messy and doesn't always make much sense. But its relentless affability wins you over.The movie has little in common with sophisticated successes like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". ""50 First Dates"" asks us to believe that love conquers all, no questions asked. Either you buy the concept or you don't.Henry [Adam Sandler] is a veterinarian who has a way with women. Living the good life in Hawaii, there seems to be no end to his conquests. One day, in a quaint little restaurant, he meets an intriguing woman named Lucy [Drew Barrymore]. They hit it off and promise to meet again. The problem is that, when Henry meets Lucy again, she acts as if she has never met him. It turns out that Lucy lost her short-term memory in a car crash. When she wakes up each day, she doesn't remember the previous day. Undaunted, Henry teams up with Lucy's family to force her to remember him.Ironically, much of makes the movie work is that neither of its stars are that naive. Both Sandler and Barrymore are worldly creatures. Theirs are tongue-in-cheek performances. They also have together what used to be called `chemistry'. They make a most believable couple.Lucy's illness doesn't exist in the real world. It's just another in a long line of movie illnesses which Hollywood has been inventing for decades. At least here, there is no miraculous cure, which makes for a satisfactory ending.

I don't have a tendancy to like him. His humour is way OTT most of the time, and it does get just a tad tiresome. And sometimes, he has a face only a mother could love. However, this film is a bit better than Anger Management, but instead of Jack Nicholson, you have Drew Barrymore.People say this is a remake of Groundhog Day, but with Adam Sandler trying to get some laughs. I just don't see it. For instance, Groundhog Day was actually the same situation everyday until the end of the movie when it all works out. This doesn't really get that repetitive (unless you're Drew Barrymore). It shows Adam Sandler in a variety (see that, variety, which is somewhat different to &quot;the same&quot;) of situations, trying to win Drew's heart in the movie. What is repetitive is 10 Second Tom. God, give the guy a show of his own!Look out for the performing animals! They're all very, very cute!As everyone knows, Drew Barrymore's character was in a car crash, and all her short term memory gets erased as soon as her head hits the pillow. So she won't remember anyone new she meets, or what she does. She basically relives the day before the crash (a Sunday), and it's always the same. Enter Adam Sandler, as Henry, to rue the day that she was ever in a car crash. He uses some pretty inventive ideas to try and make her remember him each day, or try and woo her - with some pretty disastrous results. But it's sweet, and hilarious, and some of the putdowns that happen are quite funny.I wasn't expecting the ending to be what it was. It comes about very suddenly, and it's quite sad actually! I had a little tear, but I think any UB40 song will do that to me anyway!The extras seem like a lot, but they're not really. I think the commentary with Drew Barrymore and the director would be hilarious. There's a couple of your average, run of the mill featurettes, a blooper reel, deleted scenes, and some stuff about the animals.

As for me, it was much better than I expecteded as I usually don't like Adam Sandler movies and I can take or leave Drew Barrymoore (although I really, really liked her in Fever Pitch), anyway in 50 First Dates both of them were excellent. If the movie stayed focused on the main story, the movie would have been excellent. But I finally settled on three stars because I did not care for the distractions in the movie. The whole opening sequence showing Adam Sandles as a love-em-and-leave-em womanizer almost made me shut the movie off, and after seeing the moving and reflecting back on the opening sequence, it just seemed to be so out of character with the role Sandler plays throughout the rest of the movie. It would have been much better to make him a kind of shy, kookie guy who has trouble getting dates, this would have made the rest of the movie (where he has to win over the one girl who, once she gets to know him, really like him) much better. Another very week point in the move is the Ron Schnieder character...at times he was funny, but he almost alway pushed it to the point where it was simply too much. Finally, the parts with the Walrus and other animals at Marineland was great, however even this was ruined with too many references about the animals ""private parts"". Unfortunately, these last two issues prevented me from buying five copies of this movie for various members of my family, who I think would really enjoy the main movie, but would see the ""bathroom humor"" sequences, as inappropriate for children.If this movie could only go thru the editing process one more time it really could have been something special.

817829,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0001Z3TX4,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[7, 8]","The 2004 film ""50 First Dates"" that was directed by Peter Segal (who directed ""Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult"" in 1994) was an unexpected pleasant surprise as I typically don't like films starring Adam Sandler or Rob Schneider.  However, Sandler's role as Henry Roth, who falls in love with the artist Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), is well-acted in showing both the character's frustration and determination in dealing with Lucy's short-term memory loss that prevents her from remembering just about everything from one day to the next.  Taking place in Hawaii, Henry works at a sea aquarium as its veterinarian with walruses, penguins and dolphins, as well as one of the animal trainers named Ula (Rob Schneider). For many years, Lucy has been taken care of by her aging father, Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) and her stuttering bodybuilding brother named Doug (Sean Astin).  Henry is smitten with Lucy from the first time that they meet, but unfortunately, their relationship becomes difficult, as Henry must start over afresh each day because Lucy can't remember whom he is.  Though they spend many wonderful days together and find a way to help Lucy remember what has transpired between them, she comes to the conclusion one day that she is holding Henry back from his dreams.  He goes off to finish working on his sailboat and plans to leave the island (and her), but when he visits her one last time, he finds that she has been remembering him in her dreams and in her paintings. Will they find a way to build a lasting relationship or go their separate ways?  You'll just have to watch this highly recommended film to find out!Overall, I rate ""50 First Dates"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It's an inspiring and touching light romantic comedy with a wonderful soundtrack that features such songs as ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" (by the Beach Boys), ""Another Day"" (by Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney, 1941-1998), ""Could You Be Loved"" (by Bob Marley, 1945-1981), and ""Is This Love"" (also by Bob Marley) to name a few.  Other memorable characters in the film include Alexa (Lusia Strus), Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd), Stacy (Maya Rudolph) and Nick (Pomaika'i Brown).  Of course, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Dan Aydroyd and Maya Rudolph are all veterans of the long-running TV comedy variety show ""Saturday Night Live"", which has been on the air continually since 1975.",4,"""There's nothing like a first kiss.""",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2361,"['2004', 'film', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'was', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'who', 'directed', 'Naked', 'Gun', '33', '1/3', 'Final', 'Insult', '1994', 'was', 'unexpected', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'starring', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'However', 'Sandler', 'role', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'who', 'love', 'artist', 'Lucy', 'Whitmore', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'well-acted', 'showing', 'character', 'frustration', 'determination', 'dealing', 'Lucy', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'remembering', 'just', 'everything', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'Taking', 'place', 'Hawaii', 'Henry', 'sea', 'aquarium', 'veterinarian', 'walruses', 'penguins', 'dolphins', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'animal', 'trainers', 'named', 'Ula', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'many', 'years', 'Lucy', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'aging', 'father', 'Marlin', 'Whitmore', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'stuttering', 'bodybuilding', 'brother', 'named', 'Doug', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Henry', 'smitten', 'Lucy', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'unfortunately', 'relationship', 'difficult', 'Henry', 'must', 'start', 'afresh', 'day', 'Lucy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'whom', 'spend', 'many', 'wonderful', 'days', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'help', 'Lucy', 'remember', 'what', 'transpired', 'conclusion', 'one', 'day', 'holding', 'Henry', 'back', 'dreams', 'finish', 'working', 'sailboat', 'plans', 'leave', 'island', 'when', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'been', 'remembering', 'dreams', 'paintings', 'Will', 'find', 'way', 'build', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'Overall', 'rate', '50', 'First', 'Dates', '4', '5', 'stars', 'inspiring', 'touching', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'such', 'songs', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Nice', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Day', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Linda', 'McCartney', '1941-1998', 'Could', 'Be', 'Loved', 'Bob', 'Marley', '1945-1981', 'Love', 'also', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'name', 'few', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Alexa', 'Lusia', 'Strus', 'Dr.', 'Keats', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Stacy', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Nick', 'Pomaika', 'i', 'Brown', 'course', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Dan', 'Aydroyd', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'are', 'veterans', 'long-running', 'TV', 'comedy', 'variety', 'show', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'been', 'air', 'continually', '1975']",N/A

817835,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B0001Z3TX4,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[0, 0]","A brief synopsis -- Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) was in a car accident one year ago, and as a result of her injuries has lost all capacity to retain short-term memories (she can still recall everything in her life up until the accident). One day, local playboy and veterinarian Henry Roth (Sandler) meets Lucy in a diner and the two hit it off terrifically. They make plans to meet again the next day, but by then Lucy has entirely forgotten who Henry is. Not to be deterred, Henry tries every possible tactic to woo her, but has to start all over again every day.My thoughts -- I'm always apprehensive about Adam Sandler movies. I loved The Wedding Singer, but was not at all enthralled with Anger Management. 50 First Dates falls somewhere in between. The basic plotline is very sweet, and could have made a five-star movie, but at some points Sandler falls back into his cruder slapstick mode, ruining otherwise perfect moments. Characters like Ula (Rob Schneider), Henry's grotesque friend, and Alexa (Lusia Strus), his disturbingly manly assistant, serve no real purpose other than to provide a few cheap laughs involving blood, vomit, etc. But Henry and Lucy really do have chemistry, and the scenes that focus on them are very touching. In these instances we see the more sensitive side of Sandler.The rest of the supporting cast was also hit-or-miss. Many characters were forgettable at best (pardon the unintended pun). But Sean Astin and Blake Clark both turned in great performances. Clark plays Lucy's extremely protective father, who first tries to deter Henry, but eventually comes to work with him in hopes of finding a solution to Lucy's memory problem. Astin is hilarious as Lucy's not-too-bright (and very badly dressed), steroid-popping body-builder brother (though the lisp would have been better left out). His physical comedic antics alone often steal the show.As with the acting, the plot was neither here nor there. The central romance between Henry and Lucy is heartwarming and, for the most part, well done (though not entirely realistic). But there were numerous irrelevant asides thrown in for cheap laughs. References to bodily fluids and male sexual organs are so frequent as to become tedious. It is also choc full of stereotypes regarding Hawaiians and others. What I did like, however, was the non-contrived ending. Once would expect a magical fairy-tale conclusion where Lucy suddenly recovers and they all live happily ever after, but this does not happen. While the ending is not really believable when one thinks in terms of the real world, neither is it cliched, and I liked this.So overall I'm rather stuck in the middle on this one. If you're a big fan of Sandler's cruder side, you'll get some of that, but the romantic part may seem sappy to you. If you prefer a more sensitive romantic comedy, you'll get elements of that as well, but you may find parts of the movie vulgar and distasteful. The movie wasn't horrible, but neither was it perfect. However, though I won't be purchasing it for my own collection, it is worth seeing and I'd recommend renting it when it comes out on DVD and video.",3,"Room for improvement, but still quite heartwarming.",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,3133,"['brief', 'synopsis', 'Lucy', 'Whitmore', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'car', 'accident', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'result', 'injuries', 'lost', 'capacity', 'retain', 'short-term', 'memories', 'can', 'still', 'recall', 'everything', 'life', 'up', 'accident', 'One', 'day', 'local', 'playboy', 'veterinarian', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'Sandler', 'Lucy', 'diner', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'terrifically', 'make', 'plans', 'meet', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'then', 'Lucy', 'entirely', 'forgotten', 'who', 'Henry', 'Not', 'be', 'deterred', 'Henry', 'possible', 'tactic', 'woo', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'day.My', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'always', 'apprehensive', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'loved', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'was', 'not', 'enthralled', 'Anger', 'Management', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'falls', 'somewhere', 'basic', 'plotline', 'very', 'sweet', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'five-star', 'movie', 'points', 'Sandler', 'back', 'cruder', 'slapstick', 'mode', 'ruining', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'moments', 'Characters', 'Ula', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Henry', 'grotesque', 'friend', 'Alexa', 'Lusia', 'Strus', 'disturbingly', 'manly', 'assistant', 'serve', 'real', 'purpose', 'other', 'provide', 'few', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'involving', 'blood', 'vomit', 'etc', 'Henry', 'Lucy', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'focus', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'instances', 'see', 'more', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Sandler.The', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'hit-or-miss', 'Many', 'characters', 'were', 'forgettable', 'best', 'pardon', 'unintended', 'pun', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'turned', 'great', 'performances', 'Clark', 'Lucy', 'extremely', 'protective', 'father', 'who', 'first', 'deter', 'Henry', 'eventually', 'work', 'hopes', 'finding', 'solution', 'Lucy', 'memory', 'problem', 'Astin', 'hilarious', 'Lucy', 'not-too-bright', 'very', 'badly', 'dressed', 'steroid-popping', 'body-builder', 'brother', 'lisp', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'left', 'out', 'physical', 'comedic', 'antics', 'alone', 'often', 'steal', 'show.As', 'acting', 'plot', 'was', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'central', 'romance', 'Henry', 'Lucy', 'heartwarming', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'were', 'numerous', 'irrelevant', 'asides', 'thrown', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'References', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'male', 'sexual', 'organs', 'are', 'so', 'frequent', 'become', 'tedious', 'also', 'choc', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'regarding', 'Hawaiians', 'others', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'however', 'was', 'non-contrived', 'ending', 'Once', 'would', 'expect', 'magical', 'fairy-tale', 'conclusion', 'where', 'Lucy', 'suddenly', 'recovers', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'not', 'happen', 'ending', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'when', 'one', 'terms', 'real', 'world', 'cliched', 'liked', 'overall', ""'m"", 'rather', 'stuck', 'middle', 'one', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Sandler', 'cruder', 'side', ""'ll"", 'get', 'romantic', 'part', 'may', 'seem', 'sappy', 'prefer', 'more', 'sensitive', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'find', 'parts', 'movie', 'vulgar', 'distasteful', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'was', 'perfect', 'However', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'purchasing', 'own', 'collection', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'video']",N/A

817837,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0001Z3TX4,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) isn't into commitment. He's just a laid back, Hawaiian veterinarian out for a good time. But when he walks into a Cafe one morning and sees Lucy, the girl of his dreams, everything changes.  They set up a date, but to no avail, because Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers from a loss of short term memory. Ever since a tragic accident one year earlier, Lucy's short term memory is only good for as long as she stays awake. Everyday, she wakes up thinking it's the morning the accident took place, with no idea that the tragic event ever happened. This causes terrible problems for Henry. Not only can she never remember who he is after a night's sleep, but everyday he must get her to fall in love with him from scratch. And once poor Henry gets the hang of that little problem, he's got to find a way to progress things, so every day is not another first date.Although I've always been an Adam Sandler fan, I can't say I went into this expecting very much. Oh, I knew it would be good, but here's the thing; Sandler's self-starring, Happy-Madison productions have ALL been great, but each new one is a little less great than the previous one. Billy Madison is, without a doubt, my favorite of his films. So, after his last comedy, ""Anger Management,"" I was expecting something pretty bland. The first 15 minutes or so didn't give me much to hope for. A pretty cheezy set-up, and lots of bad jokes that didn't even seem like jokes. Now, Sandler has always used odd jokes that don't seem like jokes, but the further back one goes, the more effective they are. That's almost ALL ""Billy Madison"" was comprised of, yet they totally hit the mark in that film. This time around they are just weird and sad. In the beginning at least. That's the whole thing about this film. It's just the beginning that kinda sucks.  Stick with it and you'll really be glad in the end. After Act 1, ""50 First Dates"" becomes an outstanding romantic comedy! A truly heartwarming film that will make you want to fall in love, if you aren't in love already! Even those weird jokes get better as the film rolls along. The performances are all really great, if one is used to Sandler's own style of acting. I've never been much of a Barrymore fan, but she is actually really loveable in this flick. It's great to see the wonderful Blake Clark in a pretty large role this time around too. Rob Schneider is always hilarious, and totally believable as a Hawaiian native! And, legend in my book,  Dan Aykroyd even puts in his two cents as Lucy's doctor. But the actor who steals the show is former hobbit and Goonie Sean Astin, who is hilarious as Lucy's steroid chugging brother. All the characters are highly believable and very sympathetic. You can't help but root for...well, everybody! There are no villains here other than Lucy's persistent memory loss, which is tragic and endearing. What makes the film so wonderful in the end though, is that they don't rely on a cheap, easy-way-out, happy miracle ending.

It is Groundhog Day in reverse:  everyone else is aware that she is living the same day over and over again.This movie could go in a lot of obvious directions and to its credit, it doesn't.

In fact, I find most romantic comedies just ""OKAY"" with a sprinkle of romance and a few laughs here and there. That said, I was expecting much of the same old same old here, but I was honestly surprised to find myself really enjoying it.Henry Roth is a marine biologist in Hawaii. He never commits with any girl, and usually beds tourists because he doesn't have to form an attachment to them and vice versa. One day however, out of coincidence he meets this beautiful girl, Lucy and of course it's love at first sight. They hit it off but unfortunately, she has short-term memory loss and doesn't remember him the next day. The story between Henry and Lucy ensues with an array of colorful characters like Lucy's family as well as Henry's friend, Ula and his kids (Ula's, not Henry's).I've realized that Adam Sandler's humor is either a love or hate thing for most people. They either adore his jokes and catch every movie he's in or they find it disgusting and skip every movie he's in. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of his dumbed down humor, I prefer humor that is a little intelligent, sarcastic and witty. That's why I love movies like The Wedding Crashers. But I have to say, Adam Sandler really outdoes himself in this movie. The whole premise was intriguing. After the guy tries his best to woo the girl, and when things seem to go well...she forgets him the very next day. Instead of ""understanding"" her problem and trying to fix it, he rolls with it...and I guess that was what made this movie different. So Henry tries to make her fall for him every single day, and later adopts various methods to make the situation better. These parts of the movie were really sweet. Although many things Henry did ended up looking goofy, the movie captures certain moments when everything falls to place and you go ""awwwwww"". It helps that they filmed the movie in Hawaii, where everything seems so tranquil and beautiful. Plus, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore made a really cute couple. Barrymore especially has an innocence to her that makes it all seem so much more genuine. And to provide the really funny parts, they got Rob Schneider as Ula. I was laughing my ass off every time he came on screen. Lucy's family was a hoot to watch as well.In short, this movie defines the term ""feel good"". I had a great time watching it. The chemistry on screen between the actors was superb. The storyline was unique, a lot less typical than the 101 other romantic comedies out there. The jokes cracked me up. All in all, a very good movie. Watch it with your family, your loved one or even alone, especially when you're feeling down...it'll lift your spirits.

Blake Clark also had a significant role, playing the father of the film's love interest, played by Drew Barrymore.  Sean Astin played her brother and he also was pretty funny...along the same lines as Rob Schneider but without the accent.

I believe they both have this wonderful sense of vivacious, carefree and sincere deliveries that make them top of my list for Romantic Comedy duo!The film was absolutely enjoyable from start to finish.

The subject matter is rather heavy but it is portrayed a little more light hearted and Barrymore is such an adorably likable actress that you want to see more. Sandler is the unlikely romantic lead which is all the more reason to root for him!

817858,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001Z3TX4,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","In ""50 First dates"" - which might well be subtitled ""When 'Memento' Met `Groundhog Day`"" - Drew Barrymore plays a young woman whose short term memory has been destroyed in a car accident a few months prior to the time of the story.  As a result, Lucy wakes up every morning still believing it is the day of the accident, while every night her memory of that current day is wiped away while she sleeps.  Her father and her brother have devised an elaborate charade to avoid her finding out the truth, assuming that she will live a much happier life if she is kept in blissful ignorance of her condition.  Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian who's deathly afraid of commitment and figures Lucy is the perfect woman for him.  He can woo her afresh every day, secure in the knowledge that their relationship will never have to advance much beyond the getting-to-know-you stage - though this doesn`t make for a very logical plan since winning her over day after day requires a lot more work and effort than a conventional relationship ever would.  Nevertheless, this seems to Henry to be the ideal setup, until, of course, he begins to actually fall for the hapless young woman, revealing that he is not quite the callous rogue he appears to be on the surface.Your enjoyment of  ""50 First Dates"" may be predicated on just how willing you are to accept brain damage as a source of mirth and high comedy.  If you are somehow able to quell the queasiness that comes with the premise, you might be charmed by what happens in the film.This is basically a gimmicky, one-joke comedy that indulges in far too many distractions to be very successful.  There is, admittedly, a certain sweetness to many of the scenes involving Barrymore and Sandler as they try to make a go of this highly unusual courtship.  The final scene, in particular, has a kind of offbeat poignancy that feels both daring and satisfying.  However, the film is populated by a whole host of annoying characters who work overtime to deaden the charm: Lucy's steroid-obsessed brother, Henry's creepy co-workers, and even an anthropomorphic walrus who high-fives his trainer, mugs for the camera, and vomits on cue - and whose sizable genitalia serves as the source for one of the many lowbrow gags that run through the film.In ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Sandler proved that he has the potential to stretch as an actor. Barrymore has yet to make that case.  Her wide-eyed, innocent ing&eacute;nue shtick has become a trifle threadbare by now.  It's time for her to take a leap of faith into more challenging roles and show us what - if anything - else she can do.",3,uneven romantic comedy,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,2620,"['50', 'First', 'dates', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'subtitled', 'When', ""'Memento"", 'Met', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'young', 'woman', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'been', 'destroyed', 'car', 'accident', 'few', 'months', 'prior', 'time', 'story', 'result', 'Lucy', 'up', 'morning', 'still', 'believing', 'day', 'accident', 'night', 'memory', 'current', 'day', 'wiped', 'away', 'father', 'brother', 'have', 'devised', 'elaborate', 'charade', 'avoid', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'assuming', 'will', 'live', 'much', 'happier', 'life', 'kept', 'blissful', 'ignorance', 'condition', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'veterinarian', 'who', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'commitment', 'figures', 'Lucy', 'perfect', 'woman', 'can', 'woo', 'afresh', 'day', 'secure', 'knowledge', 'relationship', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'advance', 'much', 'getting-to-know-you', 'stage', 'doesn', 't', 'make', 'very', 'logical', 'plan', 'winning', 'day', 'day', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'effort', 'conventional', 'relationship', 'ever', 'would', 'Nevertheless', 'Henry', 'be', 'ideal', 'setup', 'course', 'actually', 'fall', 'hapless', 'young', 'woman', 'revealing', 'not', 'quite', 'callous', 'rogue', 'be', 'surface.Your', 'enjoyment', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'may', 'be', 'predicated', 'just', 'how', 'willing', 'are', 'accept', 'brain', 'damage', 'source', 'mirth', 'high', 'comedy', 'are', 'somehow', 'able', 'quell', 'queasiness', 'premise', 'might', 'be', 'charmed', 'what', 'film.This', 'basically', 'gimmicky', 'one-joke', 'comedy', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'distractions', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'admittedly', 'certain', 'sweetness', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Barrymore', 'Sandler', 'try', 'make', 'go', 'highly', 'unusual', 'courtship', 'final', 'scene', 'particular', 'kind', 'offbeat', 'poignancy', 'daring', 'satisfying', 'However', 'film', 'populated', 'whole', 'host', 'annoying', 'characters', 'who', 'work', 'overtime', 'deaden', 'charm', 'Lucy', 'steroid-obsessed', 'brother', 'Henry', 'creepy', 'co-workers', 'even', 'anthropomorphic', 'walrus', 'who', 'trainer', 'mugs', 'camera', 'vomits', 'cue', 'sizable', 'genitalia', 'serves', 'source', 'one', 'many', 'lowbrow', 'gags', 'run', 'film.In', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'Sandler', 'proved', 'potential', 'stretch', 'actor', 'Barrymore', 'yet', 'make', 'case', 'wide-eyed', 'innocent', 'ing', 'eacute', 'shtick', 'become', 'trifle', 'threadbare', 'now', 'time', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'show', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'do']",N/A

817860,A2CJZZS0JDVMYW,B0001Z3TX4,"Ross Braulio ""JJ""","[2, 2]","50 first dates was one of the big romantic comedies of this year. It contains big actors and it had major marketing behind it. I'm pretty neutral when it comes to Adam Sandler because he has couple of decent comedies but many very bad also. Drew Barrymore has convinced me just once in a good comedy (The Wedding Singer), and that one time she acted with Adam Sandler so I started watching this movie with little expectation.  Movie was following pretty normal comedy line. It was made with certain formula, kind a like that it have to please a certain amount of audience. In itself it's not that bad thing, the movie was sometime funny but it didn't bring anything new to the comedy field. Also it shows that makers have to put a brake on some of the jokes just to keep the movie in that certain formula.(when they learn to make movies in more artistic way and less with dollar bills in their eyes --> I bet that the movies would be much better and they would have as much as audience than they have now, or ever more?) But now, back to the review:  I found 50 First dates a bit of sad movie. There are couples of things witch made tears in my eyes and made me feel sorry for the character. It might have been better idea to make a drama from the movie because it handles such a `dramatic?' subject. Memory loss might have been a funny idea in a text but at the latest at the filming the makers have understood that it really isn't that funny. So the result is that the movie is little confusing mixing basic Adam Sandler humor to the dramatic things. Somebody should have just leash Sandler and make an effort to make the movie a decent drama.  Although movie shows couple of pretty funny characters and couple of over top ones. There are also funny animal jokes and overall the movie runs pretty fluently. Idea of the film is interesting and not so often used. Adam Sandler is making a little tamed version of his usual `goofy' character and is giving an ok performance. Drew Barrymore is a real actress and gives her character a little more deep and realistic interpretation spiced with little sad tone. I liked it.

He was mysterious, fun, but always what they wanted.  But he would always have to disappear when the vacation was over.  It turns out that Roth is really Adam Sandler - or Sandler is Roth - a vet at a Hawaiian aquarium who fears commitment with any woman, but is not averse having a week of fun.  Roth is a fun and loveable knucklehead - in other words, he really is Adam Sandler.  Unlike the knucklehead of the ""Wedding Singer"" (which this flick resembles because Sandler turns up the charm, and also because Drew Barrymore is back) Roth fears being tied down (in WS, he dreamt of nothing more than finding the perfect woman for the perfect song).  A committed vet, Roth plans on an extended voyage to study walruses in the north Pacific - plans that have no room for girlfriends or (gulp) a wife!  Plans change when he meets the lovely Lucy (Barrymore) on a chance encounter in a caf&eacute;.  At first they hit it off, and Lucy becomes his dream girl.  Then the dream turns dark, and Roth learns that he has to keep hitting it off with her.  Seems that Lucy was involved in a car accident which totaled her ability to convert short term memory into long-term memory.  Thus, every day for Lucy starts off as a repeat of the day of the accident.  While the world passes her by, Lucy blissfully relives an idle Sunday in the idyllic Hawaiian paradise.  Worming his way past a circle of friends determined to shield Lucy, Roth finds that even succeeding at love with Lucy has its challenges (especially when, ala ""Groundhogs Day"" she forgets yesterday's tenderness).  Will Roth persevere?  Will he somehow find a way to unlock Lucy's heart despite a condition considered incurable.  More to the point, will how much fun can a flick have with catastrophic and irreversible brain damage?""Dates"" excels improbably.

But the bunch of hilarious films I have seen with this actor, of which ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Mr. Deeds"" are among the best, convinced me that I had to give ""50 First Dates"" a chance. I am glad I did, because I found an extremely funny comedy with an interesting plot and scenes that stir the viewer's emotions without becoming touchy-feely. The movie uses a similar idea to ""Groundhog Day"", but one that is based on different reasons as catalysts of the situation. In the Bill Murray movie, the main character wakes up to the same day over and over. In the film object of this review, Lucy (Drew Barrymore) has no short term memory, so even though it is a different day for everyone else, she is effectively living repeatedly through the same day without being aware of it.Lucy's family and friends try to help her in the process by recreating the day in which she had the accident and lost her short term memory (without the accident of course). But one day she meets Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), who is a guy that is used to running away from commitment by inventing all kinds of ridiculous excuses. The fact that he lives in Hawaii and interacts with a lot of women that are in the look for fun helps him in his cause. But meeting Lucy changes his life, because now he cannot get her out of his head and he is the one looking for something more than just a night of passion. The problem is that Lucy forgets everything about him every day when she goes to sleep and he has the arduous task of making her fall in love with him over and over again.Besides Sandler and Barrymore there are a couple of supporting actors that contribute their fair share to making this movie enjoyable and funny. Rob Schneider delivers a praiseworthy performance in his role of Ula, Henry's best friend. He is the guy in charge of helping Henry in creating new schemes so that he can meet Lucy every day and start the process of making her fall for him. Sean Astin, who most people surely remember from the movie ""Rudy"", appears as Lucy's brother, who is trying to build up some muscle to pretend to be tougher than he really is.In conclusion, this is a well balanced movie, since it presents moments in which you will laugh your heart out together with others that will arise a myriad of emotions in the audience. The unbelievable scenery adds a definite flair to the overall experience. Those of you that are looking for a comedy that delivers more than cheap laughs, should seriously considering picking this one up.",4,"""Lucy is a very special person""",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2653,"['disappointing', 'experience', 'watching', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'was', 'wise', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'bunch', 'hilarious', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'actor', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'are', 'best', 'convinced', 'had', 'give', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'chance', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'found', 'extremely', 'funny', 'comedy', 'interesting', 'plot', 'scenes', 'stir', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'becoming', 'touchy-feely', 'movie', 'similar', 'idea', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'one', 'based', 'different', 'reasons', 'catalysts', 'situation', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'up', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'film', 'object', 'review', 'Lucy', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'so', 'even', 'different', 'day', 'everyone', 'else', 'effectively', 'living', 'repeatedly', 'same', 'day', 'being', 'aware', 'it.Lucy', 'family', 'friends', 'try', 'help', 'process', 'recreating', 'day', 'had', 'accident', 'lost', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'accident', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'guy', 'used', 'running', 'away', 'commitment', 'inventing', 'kinds', 'ridiculous', 'excuses', 'fact', 'Hawaii', 'interacts', 'lot', 'women', 'are', 'look', 'fun', 'cause', 'meeting', 'Lucy', 'changes', 'life', 'because', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'head', 'one', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'night', 'passion', 'problem', 'Lucy', 'everything', 'day', 'when', 'sleep', 'arduous', 'task', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'again.Besides', 'Sandler', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'couple', 'supporting', 'actors', 'contribute', 'fair', 'share', 'making', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'praiseworthy', 'performance', 'role', 'Ula', 'Henry', 'best', 'friend', 'guy', 'charge', 'helping', 'Henry', 'creating', 'new', 'schemes', 'so', 'can', 'meet', 'Lucy', 'day', 'start', 'process', 'making', 'fall', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'surely', 'remember', 'movie', 'Rudy', 'Lucy', 'brother', 'who', 'trying', 'build', 'up', 'muscle', 'pretend', 'be', 'tougher', 'really', 'is.In', 'conclusion', 'well', 'balanced', 'movie', 'moments', 'will', 'laugh', 'heart', 'together', 'others', 'will', 'arise', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'audience', 'unbelievable', 'scenery', 'definite', 'flair', 'overall', 'experience', 'are', 'looking', 'comedy', 'more', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'should', 'seriously', 'considering', 'picking', 'one', 'up']",N/A

This is usually very easy for him, since he lives in Hawaii and has encounters with tourists who will quickly be flying away, never to bug him again. He is a veterinarian at an aquarium theme park, where his specialty is working with large sea mammals. He has a better rapport with the animals than with other people.One day, everything changes. He finds himself at an out-of-the-way waffle house where he first spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). He is instantly smitten and quickly makes conversation with her. They arrange to see each other the next morning. He shows up and resumes their conversation, only to see her get &quot;weirded out&quot; and wondering why he is behaving the way he is.  The waitress explains Lucy's problem to Henry. After a head injury received in a car wreck, she cannot save short term memories into long-term memories... her slate is wiped clean each night when she sleeps.The film's trailers fail to show the crude sexual humor peppered through out the film and only highlight the sweet sappy flavor of this seemingly doomed romance.  When the film was being conceived, they writers no doubt had a lot of laughs and threw in gags and jokes here and there, but didn't have the wisdom to leave some of them on the cutting room floor. First the film is a comedy, then a disgusting sexual parody, then a tragedy, then a sappy romance flick, then a &quot;happily ever after&quot; film - but it does not do well in all these roles.Sean Astin portrays Doug, Lucy's steroid-abusing brother with a bad lisp and not much between the ears. This character simply was not necessary, and if snipped, could have spared the viewer 10-15 minutes of mental drivel.Then there's Henry's aquarium assistant, Alexa (Lusia Strus), who by virtue of being plain and flat-chested has been made out as an androgenous bisexual who is the butt of jokes, including being sprayed on by walrus vomit.  It's as though this woman has no feelings, just happy and randy at all times, even though she is treated like garbage. This character could have also been eliminated, spared the viewer another 10 minutes of eye-rolling, and made the romance and drama portion of the movie that much more enjoyable.Lucy's brain injury is no laughing matter and at times, the movie addresses this, as she goes through the mental trauma of daily reliving the fact that each day is another lie, as when she wakes up each morning, she has no idea that a year has gone by.  To make Lucy feel better, Dr. Keats (Dan Akroyd) introduces Lucy to &quot;Ten Second Tom&quot; who lost a portion of his brain during a hunting accident, so he can only remember things for 10 seconds. This is incredibly tragic, yet made as a comic relief gag.Ula (Rob Schneider) is Henry's best friend and coworker at the aquarium. While also an improbable character, is a hilarious character and a fun side-kick for comic relief... although he can be quite crude as well.As with every character that Adam Sandler has ever played on the big screen, his character is a pathetic lonely man whose heart is forever changed by one magical moment and a special warm-hearted woman who gives him focus and purpose in life... and then after some drama, they live happily ever after. It's a good formula, but a good 30 minutes could have been snipped from the film and it would have been much better in the long run.The content is so highly valued by the filmmakers, however, that everyone at the screening I attended was searched for any recording devices... another indication that they took every portion of the film so seriously, they weren't able to stand back and with some tough love, edit out the less savory portions and make it a more palatable film.In the end, the film evokes real tears and some real belly laughs, but like a rollercoaster ride after eating a monster chili dog, sometimes the thrills aren't worth pain.  Fun to watch, but I never have to see it again.",3,"Sweet, gross, sappy, stupid, and did I say sweet?",1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,4071,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'sleezeball', 'cassanova', 'who', 'different', 'woman', 'day', 'up', 'excuses', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'usually', 'very', 'easy', 'Hawaii', 'encounters', 'tourists', 'who', 'will', 'quickly', 'be', 'flying', 'away', 'never', 'bug', 'again', 'veterinarian', 'aquarium', 'theme', 'park', 'where', 'specialty', 'working', 'large', 'sea', 'mammals', 'better', 'rapport', 'animals', 'other', 'people.One', 'day', 'everything', 'changes', 'out-of-the-way', 'waffle', 'house', 'where', 'first', 'Lucy', 'Whitmore', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'quickly', 'conversation', 'arrange', 'see', 'other', 'next', 'morning', 'up', 'resumes', 'conversation', 'only', 'see', 'get', 'quot', 'weirded', 'out', 'quot', 'wondering', 'why', 'behaving', 'way', 'waitress', 'Lucy', 'problem', 'Henry', 'head', 'injury', 'received', 'car', 'wreck', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'short', 'term', 'memories', 'long-term', 'memories', 'slate', 'wiped', 'clean', 'night', 'when', 'sleeps.The', 'film', 'trailers', 'fail', 'show', 'crude', 'sexual', 'humor', 'peppered', 'film', 'only', 'highlight', 'sweet', 'sappy', 'flavor', 'seemingly', 'doomed', 'romance', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'conceived', 'writers', 'doubt', 'had', 'lot', 'laughs', 'threw', 'gags', 'jokes', 'here', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wisdom', 'leave', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'First', 'film', 'comedy', 'then', 'disgusting', 'sexual', 'parody', 'then', 'tragedy', 'then', 'sappy', 'romance', 'flick', 'then', 'quot', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'roles.Sean', 'Astin', 'portrays', 'Doug', 'Lucy', 'steroid-abusing', 'brother', 'bad', 'lisp', 'not', 'much', 'ears', 'character', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'snipped', 'could', 'have', 'spared', 'viewer', '10-15', 'minutes', 'mental', 'drivel.Then', 'Henry', 'aquarium', 'assistant', 'Alexa', 'Lusia', 'Strus', 'who', 'virtue', 'being', 'plain', 'flat-chested', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'androgenous', 'bisexual', 'who', 'butt', 'jokes', 'including', 'being', 'sprayed', 'walrus', 'vomit', 'woman', 'feelings', 'just', 'happy', 'randy', 'times', 'even', 'treated', 'garbage', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'eliminated', 'spared', 'viewer', '10', 'minutes', 'eye-rolling', 'made', 'romance', 'drama', 'portion', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.Lucy', 'brain', 'injury', 'laughing', 'matter', 'times', 'movie', 'mental', 'trauma', 'daily', 'reliving', 'fact', 'day', 'lie', 'when', 'up', 'morning', 'idea', 'year', 'gone', 'make', 'Lucy', 'feel', 'better', 'Dr.', 'Keats', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'Lucy', 'quot', 'Ten', 'Second', 'Tom', 'quot', 'who', 'lost', 'portion', 'brain', 'hunting', 'accident', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'things', '10', 'seconds', 'incredibly', 'tragic', 'yet', 'made', 'comic', 'relief', 'gag.Ula', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Henry', 'best', 'friend', 'coworker', 'aquarium', 'also', 'improbable', 'character', 'hilarious', 'character', 'fun', 'side-kick', 'comic', 'relief', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'crude', 'well.As', 'character', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'ever', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'character', 'pathetic', 'lonely', 'man', 'heart', 'forever', 'changed', 'one', 'magical', 'moment', 'special', 'warm-hearted', 'woman', 'who', 'focus', 'purpose', 'life', 'then', 'drama', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'good', 'formula', 'good', '30', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'snipped', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'long', 'run.The', 'content', 'so', 'highly', 'valued', 'filmmakers', 'however', 'everyone', 'screening', 'attended', 'was', 'searched', 'recording', 'devices', 'indication', 'took', 'portion', 'film', 'so', 'seriously', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'stand', 'back', 'tough', 'love', 'out', 'less', 'savory', 'portions', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'film.In', 'end', 'film', 'evokes', 'real', 'tears', 'real', 'belly', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'eating', 'monster', 'chili', 'dog', 'sometimes', 'thrills', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'pain', 'Fun', 'watch', 'never', 'have', 'see', 'again']",N/A

On the other hand, I am not a huge fan of chick flicks(probably because I'm a guy) but I can enjoy a romantic comedy if I like the actors and the humor is really good. Adam Sandler's first movie with Drew Barrymore, 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" was very funny, and while the second film with Sandler and Barrymore, 2004's ""50 First Dates"" is not as good as ""The Wedding Singer"" was, it still does deliver a lot of laughs.This time, Adam Sandler is Henry Roth, a Hawaii bachelor who is looking for the right girl, and even though Roth spends every night with a different Hawaiian tourist, he really wants a girl he can spend his life with.  Then, one day, Roth meets Lucy  (Barrymore)at a restaurant.  Roth starts talking to her, and she seems to like him, but the next day, she doesn't remember him.  This is when Roth learns that Lucy was in a car accident, and as a result, when Lucy wakes up every day, her memory is gone, and her family and friends try to help her get her memory back.  What this means for Roth is that every day, if he wants to spend his life with Lucy (who he has found to be the girl of his dreams) he must keep doing certain things to help her remember him, and from this point on during the rest of the movie, you will be in for a wild, hilarious ride.""50 First Dates"" is one of the best films of 2004.  It also co-stars Rob Schneider and Allen Covert, and both Schneider and Covert are as funny as usual.  There are also special features on this DVD, which include a director and cast commentary, deleted scenes with an optional commentary, the making of this film, music videos, a Comedy Central Reel Comedy Special, a gag reel, a talkin' pidgin featurette, filmographies, and previews.

The movie also makes you think philosophically. Actually many people in life whose actions are still very mechanical and robot like, live a life as Drew does in this movie. However unlike Drew there are none to tell these people what's wrong with their lives. However it is also tragic to think that one day she has to wake up somewhere in her 60's and realise that her father died and then relive that everyday. The same feeling would multiply if more of her loved ones were to die before her. The other thing to imagine is that someone ought to ensure her daily treatment continued till she died.Then there are those unforgettable numbers from the 80's, particularly ""Lovesong"" and ""Friday I'am in love"" by the amazing, The Cure, ""Drive"" by The Cars, ""Hold me now"" from the Thomson Twins, The Police's ""Every breath You take"" and Spandau Ballet's ""True"" which was also featured in ""The Wedding Singer"". Most of these numbers this time are played as cover songs by newer artistes making the soundtrack to this movie another big seller.  ""Could you be loved"" the original by Bob Marley is retained though.

'50 First Dates' brings back the two stars in this equally likeable, warmhearted romantic story with a 'Memento'-like twist.  And the location of O'ahu, Hawaii, is very beautiful.Sandler is a vet named Henry Ross living in Hawaii.  He is also known as playboy whose girlfriends, he insists, must be the travellers from outside the islands, for he doesn't like the whole idea of commitment.  However, he meets a nice girl named Lucy (incredibly charming Drew Barrymore) eating waffle at the local diner, he falls in love with her seriously.  So far, nothing new.But Lucy has a secret, of which she herself is not aware.  Since the car accident last year, Lucy forgets everything that happened to her after sleeping at night.  That means, though she remembers the things that happened before the accident, including her father, brother, old friends, and that 'today' is her daddy's birthaday, Lucy cannot remember her first kiss with Henry, or the second one, and the third....The film starts with, and often relies on, the predictable, gross-out gags that are not as great as Peter Segal thinks (and he happens to be responsible the comedies like 'Nutty Professor 2' or 'Naked Gun: 3 1/3').  We get good supports from Rob Schneider, Blake Clark, Sean Astin ('Sam' of 'The Lord of the Rings'), and Dan Aykroyd, but though the film is often funny, the fact cannot be denied that the gags themselves sometimes could be better.[SWEET, VERY SWEET] But it is the characters that are impressive, and the film shows these likeable people with a heart-felt touch.  In short, we really care these characters, and wish their happiness.  Adam Sandler is known for depicting characters who suddenly get hostile, but in '50 First Dates' he remains calm and natural, which is refreshing to see.  And as to Drew Barrymore, who simply shines through the film, what can I say?I still believe that Peter Segal is not the right choice for director, and most of the gags should be left in the cutting room.  But the romantic part of the film about the man who literally goes through the '50 First Dates' is surprisingly moving, and I really love the last scene which turns out a little surprise.",4,"Sweet Drew Barrymore Shines: Funny, and Very Romantic",1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2281,"['six', 'years', 'ago', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'made', 'charming', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'The"", 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'First', 'Dates', 'brings', 'back', 'two', 'stars', 'equally', 'likeable', 'warmhearted', 'romantic', 'story', ""'Memento'-like"", 'twist', 'location', ""O'ahu"", 'Hawaii', 'very', 'beautiful.Sandler', 'vet', 'named', 'Henry', 'Ross', 'living', 'Hawaii', 'also', 'known', 'playboy', 'girlfriends', 'must', 'be', 'travellers', 'islands', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'idea', 'commitment', 'However', 'nice', 'girl', 'named', 'Lucy', 'incredibly', 'charming', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'eating', 'waffle', 'local', 'diner', 'love', 'seriously', 'So', 'far', 'nothing', 'new.But', 'Lucy', 'secret', 'not', 'aware', 'car', 'accident', 'last', 'year', 'Lucy', 'everything', 'happened', 'sleeping', 'night', 'things', 'happened', 'accident', 'including', 'father', 'brother', 'old', 'friends', ""'today"", 'daddy', 'birthaday', 'Lucy', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'first', 'kiss', 'Henry', 'second', 'one', 'third', '.The', 'film', 'starts', 'often', 'predictable', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'thinks', 'be', 'responsible', 'comedies', ""'Nutty"", 'Professor', '2', ""'Naked"", 'Gun', '3', '1/3', 'get', 'good', 'supports', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'Sean', 'Astin', ""'Sam"", ""'The"", 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'film', 'often', 'funny', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'gags', 'sometimes', 'could', 'be', 'better', '[', 'SWEET', 'VERY', 'SWEET', ']', 'characters', 'are', 'impressive', 'film', 'likeable', 'people', 'heart-felt', 'touch', 'short', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'wish', 'happiness', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'known', 'depicting', 'characters', 'who', 'suddenly', 'get', 'hostile', ""'50"", 'First', 'Dates', 'calm', 'natural', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'simply', 'film', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'still', 'believe', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'not', 'right', 'choice', 'director', 'most', 'gags', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'romantic', 'part', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'literally', ""'50"", 'First', 'Dates', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'really', 'love', 'last', 'scene', 'out', 'little', 'surprise']",N/A

817903,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0001Z3TX4,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[2, 3]","""50 First Dates"" is an Adam Sandler movie of surprising depth and heart.  As an avid movie-watcher and someone who's traditionally not a fan of Sandler, no one is more surprised than me.  This film is NOT typical Saturday-Night Live fare, despite the unfortunate guest appearance of a shark-bitten (and unfunny) Rob Schneider.In perhaps his most likeable character to date, Sandler breaks from his traditional stereotypes of playing the misunderstood social misfit with an anger management problem.  This time he plays Henry Roth, who although retains some classic ""Sandlerisms"", is a surprisingly normal, sweet-natured, down-to-earth guy who happens to be in love with a girl with no short-term memory.  Adorable Drew Barrrymore's limitless cuteness and feminine charm makes his dilemma believable; were I in Sandler's shoes, I'd be in love with her too.In one of her best performances to date, Barrymore (playing Lucy Whitmore) hits a perfect balance between comedy and sombreness for her character's tragedy.  The movie works because that tragedy is not overlooked; the characters reflect and deal with it, they try to work around it.  The movie works because Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry is real and palpable.  But perhaps most of all, and most amazing to me, is that despite losing her memory everyday, Lucy's character develops as the film progresses.  Barrymore's performance keeps getting better and better as the film goes on, giving great depth to what potentially could have been nothing more than a comedic gimmick.The ending of the film is especially well done for a film of this type.  At once poignant, wildly romantic, and beautiful, cry I nearly did!  The movie's heart lies in the sacrifices the characters make, the believable love they share, and their will to make things work without a magical ""deus ex machina"" that fixes everything and saves the day.  From that perspective, the film is quite bold, choosing to rely on the strength of its storytelling and acting to hold itself up.  The film had its humorous moments, but those will not be what I remember years from now.  Kudos, Mr. Sandler.  I hope to see more films like this from you, but somehow I doubt it.  The lure of making more films based on 3rd grade potty-jokes instead of emotion and depth is strong.  Well, at least I get to enjoy this little gem.",5,Poignant & beautiful film from Adam Sandler; no not a joke!,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,2341,"['50', 'First', 'Dates', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'surprising', 'depth', 'heart', 'avid', 'movie-watcher', 'someone', 'who', 'traditionally', 'not', 'fan', 'Sandler', 'one', 'more', 'surprised', 'film', 'NOT', 'typical', 'Saturday-Night', 'Live', 'fare', 'unfortunate', 'guest', 'appearance', 'shark-bitten', 'unfunny', 'Rob', 'Schneider.In', 'perhaps', 'most', 'likeable', 'character', 'date', 'Sandler', 'breaks', 'traditional', 'stereotypes', 'playing', 'misunderstood', 'social', 'misfit', 'anger', 'management', 'problem', 'time', 'Henry', 'Roth', 'who', 'classic', 'Sandlerisms', 'surprisingly', 'normal', 'sweet-natured', 'down-to-earth', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'girl', 'short-term', 'memory', 'Adorable', 'Drew', 'Barrrymore', 'limitless', 'cuteness', 'feminine', 'charm', 'dilemma', 'believable', 'were', 'Sandler', 'shoes', ""'d"", 'be', 'love', 'too.In', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'Barrymore', 'playing', 'Lucy', 'Whitmore', 'perfect', 'balance', 'comedy', 'sombreness', 'character', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'not', 'overlooked', 'characters', 'reflect', 'deal', 'try', 'work', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'Barrymore', 'chemistry', 'real', 'palpable', 'perhaps', 'most', 'most', 'amazing', 'losing', 'memory', 'everyday', 'Lucy', 'character', 'film', 'Barrymore', 'performance', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'film', 'giving', 'great', 'depth', 'what', 'potentially', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'more', 'comedic', 'gimmick.The', 'ending', 'film', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'type', 'once', 'poignant', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'cry', 'nearly', 'did', 'movie', 'heart', 'sacrifices', 'characters', 'make', 'believable', 'love', 'share', 'will', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'magical', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'fixes', 'everything', 'day', 'perspective', 'film', 'quite', 'bold', 'choosing', 'rely', 'strength', 'storytelling', 'acting', 'hold', 'up', 'film', 'had', 'humorous', 'moments', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'remember', 'years', 'now', 'Kudos', 'Mr.', 'Sandler', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'somehow', 'doubt', 'lure', 'making', 'more', 'films', 'based', '3rd', 'grade', 'potty-jokes', 'instead', 'emotion', 'depth', 'strong', 'Well', 'least', 'get', 'enjoy', 'little', 'gem']",N/A

Well that's the life sentence that has been dished out to pretty Hawaiian school teacher Lucy Whitmore and no matter what the efforts of her loving father and brother; every day starts the same for poor Lucy.Henry Roth is the local veterinarian at the sea-life centre, a of dubious intentions to visiting tourist, but who falls head over heels in love with Lucy and even after realising her condition, makes it his life work to try to make some sort of relationship together.That's the plot setting of ""50 First Dates"" which sees the romantic comedy pairing of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore once again grace the big screen with their lovely brand of sweet sentimental romance. With any romantic comedy at the end of the day it's got the be the relationship the two leads can strike up that will make or break the film, and theirs is perhaps none better than these two, who play off each other wonderfully well and draw the viewer into their cosy smiley filled world.There's some great support too, most notably from Rob Schneider as Ula, the Hawaiian shark friend, although the sharks don't seem to repay the friendship. Sean Astin also chips in with a great turn as the bodybuilding brother of Lucy.

With ""50 First Dates"", however, Sandler tries to add a bit of emotion into his juvenile sense of comedy.  The result is closer to chaos than consistency.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Hawaii-based ladies man Henry Roth (Sandler) living the bachelor life by churning through one woman after the other.  When he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), however, everything changes for Henry.  The reason?  Due to short-term memory loss, Lucy relives the same day over and over again, never remembering the events of the previous 24 hours.  Thus, Henry must decide whether to take advantage of this situation, or help Lucy live a happier life.The trouble with this movie is that Sandler's crude sense of humor does not mesh well with the more heartfelt tone of the overall picture.  It is almost as if two movies are going on at the same time...one where Sandler cracks sexual jokes with his buds (of which again include Rob Schneider), and one where Sandler interacts on a more personal level with Barrymore.It would have taken a great directorial effort to make this juxtaposition work, but unfortunately Peter Segal just wasn't up to the task in this case.  The movie actually needed to focus a bit more on the ""serious"" stuff and leave off some of the crudeness.  Had that happened, it would have worked much better due to the intriguing ""memory-loss"" concept.Thus, I was solidly underwhelmed by ""50 First Dates"".  It isn't unwatchable, but it really can only succeed as an adolescent ""date movie"" for those new to Sandler's comedic persuasions.
