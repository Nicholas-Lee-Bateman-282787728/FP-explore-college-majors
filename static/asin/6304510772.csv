427412,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,6304510772,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Vampirella tells the tale of the planet Draculon where the entire population are vampires. The rivers on the planet are filled with biomatter aka blood so Draculon is a peaceful place. Ella is the daughter of the planet's leader, unfortunately he get murdered when Draculon's worst criminal Vlad escapes from the courtroom and then run off in a space ship, Ella swears revenge and follows Vlad and both parties end up on Earth. Most of the movie is about Ella or Vampirella as she begins to call herself trying to track down Vlad to put an end to his evil schemes, to do this she join forces with a vampire hunter organization. The plot itself is rather ok, it is rather cheesy and campy but it is still good. However this movie do have some problems.Problem A, the acting. I have never seen such horrible acting in any movie I have ever seen. Half the actors sound like they are reading things off a script, and the other half overdo it so it becomes completely ridiculous. Talisa Soto do an ok job as Vampirella but most of the acting is abysmal.Problem B, Vampirella's costume. You know in modern comic book movies they do not just copy a character's outfit from the comic but rather designs something which fit on a 3D real human body, well they did not do this here. And while Vampirella's red bathing suit might look ok in the comic, it looks just horrible on a real woman on film. The costume look so cheap it is hard to take any part of the movie where it is shown seriously at all. It is not sexy, it looks stupid, like a 5 dollar Halloween costume. And to be honest the other costumes in the movie is not so good either.Problem C, the characters seam to have read the script, not the actors, the characters. The movie beings with Ella and her father discussing Vlad and Ella expressing disgust at the notion he might receive the death penalty. Later when the older vampire is murdered his last words to his daughter is that she must not let revenge consume her. How do he know she will seek out revenge. Later when Ella have come to Earth she meets a geek, first of all the man do not blink when she tells him she is a vampire, he just takes it in one stride as if she had just told him she was from Texas, like ok, nothing strange here. Laster after Ella has left the geek stand smiling over the kiss she gave him and he is the one who names her Vampirella, something he whispers to himself. Later Ella begins to use that name, but where did she come by it, she was not around when the geek said it. I could go on and on with this, there is countless instances where the characters react to or seam to have information they could not possible have unless they had read the script.All in all Vampirella is a cheesy film which do not do the comic book justice but which possesses it's own kind of charm. If you like me like B horror and science fiction movies then you might like this one. In a way it is so bad that it is good. I know I enjoyed watching it despite all the flaws it has.Now just a reply to those who have given the movie a negative score because of the price. This movie have become collectible. It is not the movie's fault that few copies of it was printed so it fetches a high price. You have to decide for yourself if the movie is worth it. But why give the movie a lower review score because it is collectible. That is just as stupid as those I sometimes see who give a book or a movie for example two or three stars and then explain, the product was wonderful but it took a long time shipping. This is meant to be reviews of the actual items, not comments on shipping or collectors value.",2,This is the reason comic book costumes should be changed for a live action film.,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,3619,"['Vampirella', 'tale', 'planet', 'Draculon', 'where', 'entire', 'population', 'are', 'vampires', 'rivers', 'planet', 'are', 'filled', 'biomatter', 'aka', 'blood', 'so', 'Draculon', 'peaceful', 'place', 'Ella', 'daughter', 'planet', 'leader', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'murdered', 'when', 'Draculon', 'worst', 'criminal', 'Vlad', 'escapes', 'courtroom', 'then', 'run', 'off', 'space', 'ship', 'Ella', 'revenge', 'Vlad', 'parties', 'end', 'up', 'Earth', 'Most', 'movie', 'Ella', 'Vampirella', 'call', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Vlad', 'put', 'end', 'evil', 'schemes', 'do', 'join', 'forces', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'organization', 'plot', 'rather', 'ok', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'still', 'good', 'However', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'problems.Problem', 'A', 'acting', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'horrible', 'acting', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actors', 'sound', 'are', 'reading', 'things', 'script', 'other', 'half', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'do', 'ok', 'job', 'Vampirella', 'most', 'acting', 'abysmal.Problem', 'B', 'Vampirella', 'costume', 'know', 'modern', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'copy', 'character', 'outfit', 'comic', 'rather', 'designs', 'something', 'fit', '3D', 'real', 'human', 'body', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'here', 'Vampirella', 'red', 'bathing', 'suit', 'might', 'look', 'ok', 'comic', 'just', 'horrible', 'real', 'woman', 'film', 'costume', 'look', 'so', 'cheap', 'hard', 'take', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'shown', 'seriously', 'not', 'sexy', 'stupid', '5', 'dollar', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'be', 'other', 'costumes', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'either.Problem', 'C', 'characters', 'seam', 'have', 'read', 'script', 'not', 'actors', 'characters', 'movie', 'beings', 'Ella', 'father', 'discussing', 'Vlad', 'Ella', 'expressing', 'disgust', 'notion', 'might', 'receive', 'death', 'penalty', 'Later', 'when', 'older', 'vampire', 'murdered', 'last', 'words', 'daughter', 'must', 'not', 'let', 'revenge', 'consume', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'revenge', 'Later', 'when', 'Ella', 'have', 'come', 'Earth', 'geek', 'first', 'man', 'do', 'not', 'blink', 'when', 'vampire', 'just', 'one', 'stride', 'had', 'just', 'told', 'was', 'Texas', 'ok', 'nothing', 'strange', 'here', 'Laster', 'Ella', 'left', 'geek', 'stand', 'smiling', 'kiss', 'gave', 'one', 'who', 'Vampirella', 'something', 'Later', 'Ella', 'use', 'name', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'was', 'not', 'when', 'geek', 'said', 'could', 'go', 'countless', 'instances', 'where', 'characters', 'react', 'seam', 'have', 'information', 'could', 'not', 'possible', 'have', 'had', 'read', 'script.All', 'Vampirella', 'cheesy', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'comic', 'book', 'justice', 'own', 'kind', 'charm', 'like', 'B', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'way', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'flaws', 'just', 'reply', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'negative', 'score', 'price', 'movie', 'have', 'become', 'collectible', 'not', 'movie', 'fault', 'few', 'copies', 'was', 'printed', 'high', 'price', 'have', 'decide', 'movie', 'why', 'give', 'movie', 'lower', 'review', 'score', 'collectible', 'just', 'as', 'stupid', 'sometimes', 'see', 'who', 'give', 'book', 'movie', 'example', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'then', 'explain', 'product', 'was', 'wonderful', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'shipping', 'meant', 'be', 'reviews', 'actual', 'items', 'not', 'comments', 'shipping', 'collectors', 'value']",Vampirella VHS
427413,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6304510772,Carl Manes,"[2, 2]","After the notorious despot Vlad destroys her father along with the rest of the supreme council on their home planet Drakulon, Ella takes off across the stars to a small planet called Earth, where Vlad intends to enslave the inhabitants as a source of sustenance for his dark legions. With her powers amplified, Ella aims to put an end to Vlad before he can complete his sinister plan. Forrest J Ackerman's sexy heroine comes to life in the Roger Corman production of VAMPIRELLA, but a cheesy, low-budget one, at that. Years before the major studios were tossing millions of dollars at most comic book franchises, the independents managed to squeeze out a few schlocky entries of their own, including Full Moon's DOCTOR MORDRID (taken from a screen adaptation of the Doctor Strange comics), the shelved version of Corman's own FANTASTIC FOUR, and VAMPIRELLA. It is tough to say which is worse in this case, between the poorly choreographed action sequences, the ridiculous overacting, or the narrow-minded plot. If director Jim Wynorski's resume speaks towards anything, it is his tendency to gravitate towards cheap, hastily-made exploitation films, and this is certainly no exception. When she isn't speaking, fashion model Talisa Soto looks fine enough in costume, although the design is far less flattering than one might hope. A discussion into the differences between the comics and the film would be fruitless given the liberal use of the character, so suffice it to say that VAMPIRELLA is nothing more than B-movie fodder that can easily be avoided.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",1,Vampirella,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1587,"['notorious', 'despot', 'Vlad', 'father', 'rest', 'supreme', 'council', 'home', 'planet', 'Drakulon', 'Ella', 'stars', 'small', 'planet', 'called', 'Earth', 'where', 'Vlad', 'enslave', 'inhabitants', 'source', 'sustenance', 'dark', 'legions', 'powers', 'amplified', 'Ella', 'put', 'end', 'Vlad', 'can', 'complete', 'sinister', 'plan', 'Forrest', 'J', 'Ackerman', 'sexy', 'heroine', 'life', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'production', 'VAMPIRELLA', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'one', 'Years', 'major', 'studios', 'were', 'tossing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'independents', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'out', 'few', 'schlocky', 'entries', 'own', 'including', 'Full', 'Moon', 'DOCTOR', 'MORDRID', 'taken', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Doctor', 'Strange', 'comics', 'shelved', 'version', 'Corman', 'own', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'VAMPIRELLA', 'tough', 'say', 'worse', 'case', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'action', 'sequences', 'ridiculous', 'overacting', 'narrow-minded', 'plot', 'director', 'Jim', 'Wynorski', 'resume', 'towards', 'anything', 'tendency', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'cheap', 'hastily-made', 'exploitation', 'films', 'certainly', 'exception', 'When', ""n't"", 'speaking', 'fashion', 'model', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'fine', 'enough', 'costume', 'design', 'far', 'less', 'flattering', 'one', 'might', 'hope', 'discussion', 'differences', 'comics', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'fruitless', 'given', 'liberal', 'use', 'character', 'suffice', 'say', 'VAMPIRELLA', 'nothing', 'more', 'B-movie', 'fodder', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'avoided.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Vampirella VHS

This satisfied my need to see Vampirella in a film but that was about it.  Talisa Soto as Vampirella was the only good acting in this whole movie.  She really did a good job (but then she always does).  The rest ranged from unbelievable.  I really find it hard to believe that after spending several thousand years on earth the head vampires would be this stupid.

The story was dull, the casting was misguided, and the ""special"" effects were dismal (although the spacecraft models actually looked ok, other aspects such as ""morphing into a bat"" were anything but special). This movie is listed at an unbelievably low 1 million dollar budget, and I suspect that 99% of this budget went to buy the 80 minutes worth of film stock and pay Roger Daltrey's retainer fees (by the way, Mr. Daltrey seems to be quite fond of singing about being ""freed"" in many of his movies...maybe this is directed at his agent!)At first I thought this film would make great fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000, but as the movie progressed, I realized that it probably would have led to mass suicide on the ol' Satellite of Love.I can't guess who would actually enjoy this movie. Fans of the Vampirella comic series are sure to be disappointed by the changes (the costume alteration is the tip of the iceberg here). There's not much to appease fans of cheap horror flicks either.

427418,A3E68QNSCABRVW,6304510772,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[0, 0]","This movie is terrible.  I'll tell it like it is.  I never read the original 1970's comic magazine, but I have the comics that come after 1992, so I don't know how well this follows the original story line.  From reading other reviews, it apparently doesn't.Some people may remember in the 80's when they started trying to get comic books into the movies.  This is probably the worst attempt during the first stint at trying to transfer comics to movies (though this came out in like '96).  Even ""The Punisher"" with Dolf Lundgren is ten times better than this film.  Granted I'm pretty sure ""Vampirella"" had a much lower budget... which is kind of shocking, I know.  The basics in the Vampirella story are that vampires are really from another planet, Drakulon, that flows with blood for rivers and they feed off of this regularly.  Vampirella's arch nemesis is Vlad and he was a criminal on her planet.  He gets away and comes to Earth, only after killing her father.  Naturally Vampirella wants vengeance, so she follows Vlad and his cronies.As you can see the movie starts off pretty cheesy on some ""futuristic"" world that looks like any other 1970's sci-fi set.  After she gets off planet it goes from stupid to dumber, because all of a sudden she has this vinyl costume, but in Drakulon she had nothing of the kind.  Apparently she left the planet with this though?  At least that's what the movie implies.  I don't know, in the beginning she was relatively modestly dressed, so maybe after her father died she felt less inhibitive and decided to go with something sexier?  Sure, that works for me.  The only problem I had with this was that it wasn't her costume from the comic... it was some amalgamation of it.  I know her costume was supposed to be satin in the comics, not vinyl though.  I guess they were trying to play up some sort of dominatrix type of look.  Either way, the costume change wasn't all that great, and yes they are big deals in comics for those who don't know.Anyway, so her first appearance on Earth is probably one of the more absurd scenarios.  There's this ridiculously nerdy kid walking in a back alley with a computer system (old computer... like the size of a microwave, yes this is filmed in 1996, unless this is some lost film) and he's being mugged.  For some reason Vampirella appears out of nowhere and rescues him by beating up the thugs.  Of course computer nerd kid thinks she's really hot.  So they go back to his place, no idea why, and he tells her some answers to these totally random questions she has, because of course he knows the answer and can look them up on the internet.  The internet is a veritable smorgasbord of information, because you can clearly look up the names of ultra hidden vampires because they are using their original names from Drakulon... makes sense to me.  Then he gives her a coat because she can't go out wearing a vinyl bikini, and then she kisses him?  The highlight of this scene was the poster for ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" in the background, which is hilarious.So she seeks vengeance then proceeds to hunt down Vlad's friends and kill them so she can finally find Vlad.  All the while there is this top secret government organization searching for vampires too and their lead agent is Adam Van Helsing... of course.  Anyway, they cross paths, Vampirella has to convince Adam they're on the same side, and then a whole bunch of other clich&eacute; and predictable things happen.  They capture one of Vlad's henchmen and they find out that Vlad has turned into a rock star... played by some musician named Daltry.  Of course this gives them the excuse to actually perform some sort of rock song?  It's about being a vampire... who could've guessed.Just to finish this up, Adam and Vampirella work together to bring Vlad and team down in a very random and silly way that was predictable from the beginning.  Trust me; the comic books are far better than this.  If you're a fan of the comic book you may want to go ahead and NOT see this.  Otherwise, if you want to sit around with your friends and make sarcastic comments about a movie, this is definitely what you're after.  At least the girl in the movie is actually pretty good looking, so it's not like it hurts your eyes to watch... though Vlad's monster make-up was pretty goofy looking and that did kind of hurt to look at.  So I guess it ends up netting to zero for viewability since it doesn't technically have a positive constant, mathematically speaking.",2,The actress is pretty and wears shiny red vinyl... that's about it,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,4498,"['movie', 'terrible', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'never', 'read', 'original', '1970', 'comic', 'magazine', 'have', 'comics', 'come', '1992', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'apparently', ""doesn't.Some"", 'people', 'may', 'remember', '80', 'when', 'started', 'trying', 'get', 'comic', 'books', 'movies', 'probably', 'worst', 'attempt', 'first', 'stint', 'trying', 'transfer', 'comics', 'movies', 'came', 'out', ""'96"", 'Even', 'Punisher', 'Dolf', 'Lundgren', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'film', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Vampirella', 'had', 'much', 'lower', 'budget', 'kind', 'shocking', 'know', 'basics', 'Vampirella', 'story', 'are', 'vampires', 'are', 'really', 'planet', 'Drakulon', 'blood', 'rivers', 'feed', 'regularly', 'Vampirella', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Vlad', 'was', 'criminal', 'planet', 'away', 'Earth', 'only', 'killing', 'father', 'Naturally', 'Vampirella', 'vengeance', 'Vlad', 'cronies.As', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'futuristic', 'world', 'other', '1970', 'sci-fi', 'set', 'planet', 'stupid', 'dumber', 'sudden', 'vinyl', 'costume', 'Drakulon', 'had', 'nothing', 'kind', 'Apparently', 'left', 'planet', 'though', 'least', 'what', 'movie', 'implies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'beginning', 'was', 'relatively', 'modestly', 'dressed', 'maybe', 'father', 'died', 'felt', 'less', 'inhibitive', 'decided', 'go', 'something', 'sexier', 'Sure', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'costume', 'comic', 'was', 'amalgamation', 'know', 'costume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'satin', 'comics', 'not', 'vinyl', 'guess', 'were', 'trying', 'play', 'up', 'sort', 'dominatrix', 'type', 'look', 'way', 'costume', 'change', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'yes', 'are', 'big', 'deals', 'comics', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Anyway', 'first', 'appearance', 'Earth', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'absurd', 'scenarios', 'ridiculously', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'walking', 'back', 'alley', 'computer', 'system', 'old', 'computer', 'size', 'microwave', 'yes', 'filmed', '1996', 'lost', 'film', 'being', 'mugged', 'reason', 'Vampirella', 'nowhere', 'beating', 'up', 'thugs', 'course', 'computer', 'nerd', 'kid', 'really', 'hot', 'go', 'back', 'place', 'idea', 'why', 'answers', 'totally', 'random', 'questions', 'course', 'answer', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'internet', 'internet', 'veritable', 'smorgasbord', 'information', 'can', 'clearly', 'look', 'up', 'names', 'ultra', 'hidden', 'vampires', 'are', 'using', 'original', 'names', 'Drakulon', 'sense', 'Then', 'coat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'wearing', 'vinyl', 'bikini', 'then', 'highlight', 'scene', 'was', 'poster', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Beyond', 'Thunderdome', 'background', 'hilarious.So', 'vengeance', 'then', 'hunt', 'down', 'Vlad', 'friends', 'kill', 'can', 'finally', 'find', 'Vlad', 'while', 'top', 'secret', 'government', 'organization', 'searching', 'vampires', 'too', 'lead', 'agent', 'Adam', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'course', 'Anyway', 'cross', 'paths', 'Vampirella', 'convince', 'Adam', ""'re"", 'same', 'side', 'then', 'whole', 'bunch', 'other', 'clich', 'eacute', 'predictable', 'things', 'happen', 'capture', 'one', 'Vlad', 'henchmen', 'find', 'out', 'Vlad', 'turned', 'rock', 'star', 'played', 'musician', 'named', 'Daltry', 'course', 'excuse', 'actually', 'perform', 'sort', 'rock', 'song', 'being', 'vampire', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'guessed.Just', 'finish', 'up', 'Adam', 'Vampirella', 'work', 'together', 'bring', 'Vlad', 'team', 'down', 'very', 'random', 'silly', 'way', 'was', 'predictable', 'beginning', 'Trust', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'far', 'better', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'ahead', 'NOT', 'see', 'Otherwise', 'want', 'sit', 'around', 'friends', 'make', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'movie', 'definitely', 'what', ""'re"", 'least', 'girl', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'looking', 'not', 'eyes', 'watch', 'Vlad', 'monster', 'make-up', 'was', 'pretty', 'goofy', 'looking', 'did', 'kind', 'hurt', 'look', 'guess', 'up', 'netting', 'zero', 'viewability', ""n't"", 'technically', 'have', 'positive', 'constant', 'mathematically', 'speaking']",Vampirella VHS

Imagine my joy to see it on the big screen!  Unfortunately, that joy was short-lived because the movie is quite low budget with a simple screenplay.As in the fanzine, Vampirella is from the planet Drakulon, and the movie covers here beginning there.  The love between her and Van Helsing, as well as her use of a formula to avoid the need for human blood, is discussed as well.  She even goes against her arch-nemesis, Vlad, who is played here by Roger Daltry.The choice of Roger Daltry puzzled me.  He seems to have been chosen so that the director can make Vlad a rock star, which is not from the Vampirella story, but from Anne Rice's Lestat.  Why to producers of this movie wanted this in their adaptation is odd since there is only one scene where he sings.There is brief nudity, but it seems more gratuitous than artistic or necessary.  Moreover, one of the actresses baring herself has no use to the plot whatsoever than that one moment.If you are a fan of Vampirella, I would recommend giving this movie a skip.

Because it's a new and daring way to talk about the same subjects.And the price ?
