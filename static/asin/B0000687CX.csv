Burchfield,"[0, 1]","I got Mr. Gurney's first two Dinotopia books several years ago and thought they were pretty good, (especially the 1st one), this miniseries disappointed me. Instead of going with the book plotline set in the 1860's we are presented with two half brothers and their father in the present crashing their plane near Dinotopian shores. Dad is lost, presumed dead, for most of the show. References are made to several of the book characters but none make an actual appearance and the storyline itself is only vaguely like that of the books. I had hoped for better, the sets and Dinosaurs look acceptable especially for a big TV budget but the characters weren't very interesting to me (not well developed, hurried or soomehow not ture to form). It seems that most of the people speak with a British accent (I think parts of the show were filmed in Britain). When the regular series comes on this fall I think all of the miniseries humans will have been replace with new actors, I hate it when a series does that.Does anybody know where to find the hidden scenes?",3,Fun to look at but the books are much better,1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,1057,"['got', 'Mr.', 'Gurney', 'first', 'two', 'Dinotopia', 'books', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', '1st', 'one', 'miniseries', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'going', 'book', 'plotline', 'set', '1860', 'are', 'presented', 'two', 'half', 'brothers', 'father', 'present', 'crashing', 'plane', 'Dinotopian', 'shores', 'Dad', 'lost', 'presumed', 'dead', 'most', 'show', 'References', 'are', 'made', 'several', 'book', 'characters', 'none', 'make', 'actual', 'appearance', 'storyline', 'only', 'vaguely', 'books', 'had', 'hoped', 'better', 'sets', 'Dinosaurs', 'look', 'acceptable', 'especially', 'big', 'TV', 'budget', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'hurried', 'soomehow', 'not', 'ture', 'form', 'most', 'people', 'speak', 'British', 'accent', 'think', 'parts', 'show', 'were', 'filmed', 'Britain', 'When', 'regular', 'series', 'fall', 'think', 'miniseries', 'humans', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'replace', 'new', 'actors', 'hate', 'when', 'series', 'that.Does', 'anybody', 'know', 'where', 'find', 'hidden', 'scenes']",N/A

Not long after, I started hearing rumors of a Miniseries to air on ABC. I decided I would watch it to see what all of the hype was about. After twenty minuits I was hooked! This 6 hour long epic is able to hold the interest of young and old for a long period of time.David and Karl are half brothers who go on a rutine flight with their father. But they hit a thunderstorm and crash into the ocean. David and Karl are forced to leave their father behind and swim ashore. They are both shocked to find that not only do dinosaurs still exsist, but that they co-exist with humans in a utopian society. But when the sunstones, wich give the poeple power and keep carnivours away from the villages, fail, David and Karl set out to restore power before all of Dinotopia is lost forever.The special effects were very well done compared to other made for television movies.

People crash land in a country where humans and dinosaurs live together in peace&harmony.; It's an interesting series, with some potentially good ideas, with a pre-Prison Break Wentworth Miller and David Thewlis as a surprisingly sympathetic villain.In ""Dinotopia"", Miller and Tyron Leitso star as a pair of half-brothers who crash land in Dinotopia. (To make this movie family-friendly, they describe their late father as ""socially active"") They are greeted by the presiding matriarch, Alice Krige. Since they are in a worker's paradise, they can't choose their own jobs. She also has them listening to dinosaurs pound their feet, getting them into polytheistic/pantheistic meditation. Furthermore, the half-brothers must abide by Dinotopia's laws. They must be vegetarian-and the kicker- they can't fight in self-defense if carnivorous dinosaurs attack. In the meantime, the half-brothers end up smitten with the mayor of Waterfall City's daughter. (In a not-so-family friendly twist, she skinny dips with one of them,but nothing results from the love triangle) They also encounter the free-thinking villain, David Thewlis. He wants the people of Dinotopia to have freedom of thought and freedom of motion,as well as the freedom to defend themselves- but he's stigmatized.The sunstones that are defending Dinotopia from carnivorous dinosaurs are failing. The half-brothers embark on a quest to restore them. As for the love triangle, it's left unresolved.""Dinotopia"" has some good special effects and great acting. Krige is at once menacing and maternal as Dinotopia's leader. She's the organic, vegetarian Borg Queen. The script is turgid. There are aspects problematic for youngsters. ""Dinotopia"" isn't utopia.

For life. No one is ever allowed to leave the island.All citizens are required to have and are assigned a dinosaur mate to have ""spiritual union"" with.Children in Society schools are programmed to believe that the Group is paramount and the individual is nothing. They must memorize and recite The Code (Commandments)which lays all this out. They are graded on this.School children are taught they are no more valuable and have no more right to live than lizards and other animals.Citizens are told that all weapons are Evil. Even for defense. Marauding carnivorous dinosaurs are to be ""appeased"" and served.Citizens are required to eat vegetables and fruit since meat eating is disrespectful to animals.This film goes on and on like this, delivering the same not so subtle messages to the audience.

In this miniseries, after a plane crash two brothers are marooned on the Dinotopia island, and must go through the process of learning a new way of life and a new set of philosophies about life. They arrive in a time of conflict, as not ALL the dinosaurs are so friendly.The story is engaging, characters are well formed and interesting, the acting is competent, and the special effects are pretty good for a TV production. My only knock on the special effects is that certain sequences were used over and over again in the climactic battle. Evidently their budget ran a bit short.I bought this as a present for our ten year old granddaughter, who particularly enjoyed it, and that was the important consideration.

703997,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B0000687CX,"""chick_flick""","[1, 4]","""Dinotopia"" is not your average ""Jurassic Park"" film. It's almost the opposite of what you'd expect in ""Jurassic Park"". There is only one scene that truly looks like it was taken right out of ""Jurassic Park""--and that would be a quick fight scene between two Tyranasorousrex dinosaurs.PLOT SUMMARY: Based on the novel, the film (actually a made-for-TV miniseries movie), is about two teenage half brothers, called Carl (Tyron Leitso) and David (Wentworth Miller) Scott, who couldn't be more different. Carl is the outgoing, rebellious teen, while David is the quiet, serious one who would rather be studying than going out. Their father decides to take them on a plane trip for his birthday in his personal airplane (Mr. Scott is supposibly a millionaire). On the plane ride, Mr. Scott lets Carl drive the airplane and they soon are stuck right in the middle of a deadly storm out in the middle of the ocean. Their plane crashes into the ocean, and Carl and David manage to escape the plane, while their father is still stuck inside. They swim to shore, and find themselves on a strange island they at first think is deserted, until they come across an odd archaeologist with a wooden leg who explains that they are on the island of Dinotopia. Carl and David insist that they need to find some help because they believe their father is dead. So the archaeologist takes them to a village where they are encountered by the most astonishing discovery of all--dinosaurs living amoungest humans! After they are taken to Dinotopia's main city, Waterville City, they are introduced to the mayor and his beautiful daughter, Marion (Katie Carr), who the boys both fall in love with. The mayor tells them that there is no way off the island and that they are stuck there forever. Carl, is of course, very upset about this. Carl doesn't want anything more than to go home. David, on the other hand, tries to make the best of their situation, and has come to reconile his destiny in Dinotopia. Like all Dinotopian citizans, Carl and David are given assignments--Carl is supposed to raise a baby dinosaur, while David is assigned to become a Skyrider, and help protect Dinotopia from harm, which is ironic, because David has a great fear of heights and Carl doesn't feel as though he can take care of a baby dinosaur. Carl and David both try to win over the affection of Marion, and become friends with the archaeologist...who seems to know a lot about Dinotopia and also is trying to look for a way off the island. The villages uses these strange stones called ""sunstones"", which shine a bright white light and help protect the villages from the evil man-eating dinosaurs. When the sunstone supply mysteriously runs low, fear strikes over the villages that they will be attacked by the man-eating dinosaurs. Now, it's up to Carl, David, and Marion to save the villages of Dinotopia before the dinosaurs attack and destroy the cities by finding more sunstones to put into the towers that hold the sunstones.OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""Dinotopia"" is a very long film--about 240 minutes to be exact, but it was originally made into a miniseries on TV, so I can understand why it would seem longer on DVD. The acting is pretty average--there is some stiff acting at points during the film, but it was fairly good. It wasn't ""great"", but it was ""good enough"". There were a lot of plots twisted into the film...almost too many, such as the love triangle between Carl, David, and Marion; Carl trying to get home; dinosaurs attacking, etc., but they tried to set up the story in a way in which all plots could be resolved by the end. And, amazingly, it pretty much worked. The special effects were well-done, and there is non-stop action. I also have to add that the setting is beautiful and so are the costumes.The DVD is wonderfully packaged, with a ""making of"" documentary, behind the scenes, two deleted scenes, interviews, a ""Dinotopia Encyclopedia"", photo gallery, cast and crew information, tips and tricks for the Game Boy adventure game, a maze game, hidden footage, dinosaur facts and sounds for kids, and DVD-ROM features. The DVD is available in full frame format.I highly recommend ""Dinotopia"".Score:97/100A+",5,Fun and adventurous ride through a fantasy fairytale world.,1039651200,"12 12, 2002",2002,4192,"['Dinotopia', 'not', 'average', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'film', 'almost', 'opposite', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'truly', 'was', 'taken', 'right', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'fight', 'scene', 'two', 'Tyranasorousrex', 'dinosaurs.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Based', 'novel', 'film', 'actually', 'made-for-TV', 'miniseries', 'movie', 'two', 'teenage', 'half', 'brothers', 'called', 'Carl', 'Tyron', 'Leitso', 'David', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Scott', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Carl', 'outgoing', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'David', 'quiet', 'serious', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'studying', 'going', 'out', 'father', 'take', 'plane', 'trip', 'birthday', 'personal', 'airplane', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'supposibly', 'millionaire', 'plane', 'ride', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'Carl', 'drive', 'airplane', 'soon', 'are', 'stuck', 'right', 'middle', 'deadly', 'storm', 'middle', 'ocean', 'plane', 'crashes', 'ocean', 'Carl', 'David', 'manage', 'escape', 'plane', 'father', 'still', 'stuck', 'inside', 'swim', 'shore', 'find', 'strange', 'island', 'first', 'think', 'deserted', 'come', 'odd', 'archaeologist', 'wooden', 'leg', 'who', 'are', 'island', 'Dinotopia', 'Carl', 'David', 'insist', 'need', 'find', 'help', 'believe', 'father', 'dead', 'archaeologist', 'village', 'where', 'are', 'encountered', 'most', 'astonishing', 'discovery', 'dinosaurs', 'living', 'amoungest', 'humans', 'are', 'taken', 'Dinotopia', 'main', 'city', 'Waterville', 'City', 'are', 'introduced', 'mayor', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Marion', 'Katie', 'Carr', 'who', 'boys', 'fall', 'love', 'mayor', 'way', 'island', 'are', 'stuck', 'there', 'forever', 'Carl', 'course', 'very', 'upset', 'Carl', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'more', 'go', 'home', 'David', 'other', 'hand', 'tries', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'come', 'reconile', 'destiny', 'Dinotopia', 'Dinotopian', 'citizans', 'Carl', 'David', 'are', 'given', 'assignments', 'Carl', 'supposed', 'raise', 'baby', 'dinosaur', 'David', 'assigned', 'become', 'Skyrider', 'help', 'protect', 'Dinotopia', 'harm', 'ironic', 'David', 'great', 'fear', 'heights', 'Carl', ""n't"", 'feel', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'baby', 'dinosaur', 'Carl', 'David', 'try', 'win', 'affection', 'Marion', 'become', 'friends', 'archaeologist', 'who', 'know', 'lot', 'Dinotopia', 'also', 'trying', 'look', 'way', 'island', 'villages', 'strange', 'stones', 'called', 'sunstones', 'shine', 'bright', 'white', 'light', 'help', 'protect', 'villages', 'evil', 'man-eating', 'dinosaurs', 'When', 'sunstone', 'supply', 'mysteriously', 'low', 'fear', 'strikes', 'villages', 'will', 'be', 'attacked', 'man-eating', 'dinosaurs', 'Now', 'up', 'Carl', 'David', 'Marion', 'save', 'villages', 'Dinotopia', 'dinosaurs', 'attack', 'destroy', 'cities', 'finding', 'more', 'sunstones', 'put', 'towers', 'hold', 'sunstones.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'Dinotopia', 'very', 'long', 'film', '240', 'minutes', 'be', 'exact', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'miniseries', 'TV', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'seem', 'longer', 'DVD', 'acting', 'pretty', 'average', 'stiff', 'acting', 'points', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'were', 'lot', 'plots', 'twisted', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'many', 'such', 'love', 'triangle', 'Carl', 'David', 'Marion', 'Carl', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'dinosaurs', 'attacking', 'etc.', 'tried', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'way', 'plots', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'end', 'amazingly', 'pretty', 'much', 'worked', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'well-done', 'non-stop', 'action', 'also', 'have', 'add', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'so', 'are', 'costumes.The', 'DVD', 'wonderfully', 'packaged', 'making', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'Dinotopia', 'Encyclopedia', 'photo', 'gallery', 'cast', 'crew', 'information', 'tips', 'tricks', 'Game', 'Boy', 'adventure', 'game', 'maze', 'game', 'hidden', 'footage', 'dinosaur', 'facts', 'sounds', 'kids', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'DVD', 'available', 'full', 'frame', 'format.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Dinotopia', '.Score:97/100A+']",N/A

703999,A21KM4ZAKY9U9S,B0000687CX,Chrome Oxide,"[3, 7]","After watching this entire miniseries, I can easily envision the secret masters of the Hollywood Liberal Elite thinking because this is a fantasy it doesn't need to make sense.  So, treating it with the typical contempt they display toward the viewers of the product they churn out, they tossed in all their favorite delusions.The concept is intelligent dinosaurs coexisting with people.  There could have been, but wasn't, some very interesting things to say about cultures and learning.I started out watching this miniseries wanting to like it.  However, over time, my feelings toward this miniseries degenerated to contempt for the writers, and dislike of the whole story.  Later, I simply watched, waiting for the point where I would be so sickened by the idiocy that I would turn it off in disgust and walk away.  Unfortunately for me, the tipping point was so close to the end that I decided to finish watching and write this as a warning to others thinking of watching this miniseries.The core of this unbelievable totalitarian fantasy is a magical, mythical meteorite fragment called a Sun Stone.  The Sun Stone provides unlimited broadcast power to everyone in the land, although the most important use is for the force field which protects the cities from the carnivores dinosaurs.  The Sun Stones that are above ground seem to wear out while the ones underground don't wear out.  The Sun Stone is a perfect energy source as it doesn't pollute, has no bad side effects and you don't actually have to do any work to acquire them.  Except to go underground, pick them up and carry them back.  Which for most of the miniseries is a crime and is actively discouraged, even though it may save their totalitarian regime from destruction.  It may be helpful to think of the Sun Stone as the element, unbelievium.  The same care and thought that was applied to the concept of the Sun Stone was used to create characters and plot.The force field is never explained, and only lighting and a hatchery for dinosaurs is shown as using this free and widely available power.  Which makes sense as independent thought and innovation must be always be discouraged by any government, especially the totalitarian portrayed in this show.Early on in the series, the two new arrivals to Dinotopia get bus tickets for their ride to Waterfall City, the capital of the land.  Money is never discussed and may not even exist.  If money exists, how can these new comers pay for their bus tickets?  If money doesn't exist, they why do bus tickets even exist and why would anyone keep track?  If in their moneyless society, they feel the need to keep track of the number of riders on busses, then most likely, there would be an army of census takers keeping track of other useless bit of information.  Useless because later on in the series, it is show there is no free will and everybody follows the orders of the elite political class.  Doing what they are told and going where ever they are told.  In any culture that only follows orders, there can't possibly be a reason to keep track of the people following orders, unless it is a police state.While on the trip to Waterfall City, our two stars are informed that owning weapons is bad.  During that trip, it is also explained that it is inappropriate to hurt the carnivorous dinosaurs because they have a right to eat.  Let's think about this for a moment, you don't have a right to defend yourself from a carnivore.  Carnivores need to eat to survive.  So why do the people run when carnivores arrive to eat them.  They are in effect denying the carnivores their right to eat and survive.  Near the end of the show when the master Sun Stone fails and the force field dies, an invading army of carnivorous dinosaurs arrive to eat the people in Waterfall City.  Even though the carnivores have a right to eat, and the people don't have a right to defend themselves, the people all panic and run about the streets in an attempt to avoid being eaten.  Which means the carnivores right to eat to survive is a fraud if everything they try to eat tries to avoid being eaten.Carnivores don't need to eat as regularly as vegetarians.  Pound per pound, meat contains a larger number of calories than vegetables.  With the incredibly stupid nonsensical rule that each vegetarian dinosaur must have a human, or the other way around, the island should have been denuded of vegetation many centuries earlier.  I also call this rule stupid and nonsensical because if every dinosaur must have a human, why does every scene in Waterfall City have a massively larger number of humans than dinosaurs?  Why do none of the main characters have their counterpart near by?  Only one, Zeppo mentioned his human died.  Actually I changed the spelling of the name to reflect that this is a Marxist movie.One of the rules is that everyone should eat to live, not live to eat.  Yet the mayor / overlord was obviously overweight.  Which means, like any totalitarian government, the elite are above the law.While not clearly stated, it seems that all intelligent dinosaurs are vegetarian.  Also not stated, but implied by the story, the carnivores don't seem to be intelligent.At one point when forcing one of the kids to take a dinosaur of his own, the dinosaur hatchery has some eggs from a vegetarian dinosaur that was eaten by a carnivore.  This brings up so many questions that I don't know where to begin.  My main question being, why would an intelligent vegetarian choose to lay eggs in a place where carnivores live if there are multiple hatcheries available?To give you an idea of how intellectually vapid this culture is, they take the lyrics of a Queen song, Bohemian Rhapsody, as great philosophical thought.The main subplot was how the evil capitalist out to corner the market on Sun Stones is easily outwitted by the stupid rebellious teenager.  Multiple times.  By the time that evil capitalist attempted to kill the dinosaur that turns out to float when bound in a bag an dumped in water, I wasn't even bothered that there seemed to be no repercussions for that action other than the dinosaur he tried to kill didn't like him any more.  Which was interesting because the two teenager kids were put on trial for their inability to fit into this totalitarian regime (actually I forget what the real reason was because I was fortunate enough to blank it from my mind).  Which must mean that the inability to fit in is a more serious crime than attempted murder.The point that finally inspired me to write this review was the kids' finding their still living father, who should have died from being underwater too long without air, surviving for months in a small cave without any source of food.I probably put more time and effort into writing this review then the writers / producers of the miniseries put into creating it.",1,Dinotopia = Dinosaur + Utopia = complete waste of time,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,6845,"['watching', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'can',

Parts 2 and 3 not only showed improvement but also surpassed my expectations.I enjoyed all the actors, especially Alice Krige, best know to scifi fans as the Borg Queen (Star Trek: First Contact). I also enjoyed the tension of scenes such as the rock climbing, the skybax rides, and the T-Rex invasion.Now the miniseries is out on DVD (with lots of bonus features), and will soon become a weekly series on ABC-TV (Thursday nights).

On the one hand, the special effects in this miniseries were a lot better - surprising given you'd think special effects would increase with time. I also thought the acting performances were better. However, the characters seemed a bit duller in this miniseries than in the longer series. There's really little development and they seem to blow by things - such as their father's presumed death - a bit too quickly. The plot was also the material of mediocre action movies. Basically, the heroes have to find the crystal before the big monsters attack, and all of the adults are too stupid to realize that the kids are right.

704008,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000687CX,Get What We Give,"[8, 11]","Dinotopia is a dino disappointment.The sets and the computer graphics are really quite cool, but when taken as a whole, this is not what it could have been.The Halmis (the producers and financiers for this project) have become the Austrailian financiers for many huge and ultimately disappointing films (anyone remember the ""Gone With The Wind"" sequel?).Dinotopia's premise is a picture book from many years ago that an artist contrived as ""what if dinosaurs and people coexisted with each other"".After a plane crash strands two young men on an uncharted island (known as Dinotopia) and kills their father, they discover that the island is inhabited by dinosaurs and people alike and that civilization there is quite advanced in its own way.  The brothers are completely different from each other and don't like each other too much.  Most disturbing, perhaps, is that neither one seems too distressed when their father drowns in the plane crash.  ""Whoops, Dad's dead, gee, okay, where are we now?"" seems to be the sentiment.The whole lack of emotional development of these central characters starts to make you wonder if the whole thing isn't a dream (which would be fine, if that revelation were ever to play out - but it doesn't).  Then there's the whole love triangle interest - both brothers have the hots for this girl on the island and she seems to be attracted to both too - what will come of it?  Guess what?  You'll never find out.  That plot point dies on the vine.Frankly the whole film (mini series - aren't they usually diappointing?  Sad isn't it?) seems to be an extended prehistoric rendition of Top Gun mixed with a little Robinson Crusoe (but when couldn't you parallel that story with a ""stranded on a deserted island film?).The island is quite lucky to have had these two nincumpoops land , because even though the community has existed since the dawn of time, apparently they are all too stupid to do anything about an impending emergency and need these Generation Y kids to teach them how to save themselves.The boys were obviously hired for their ""hot boy"" appeal, but the lead girl was hired for some other quality, because she is quite odd looking.  One boy is supposed to be a nerd, but seems to have spent most of his time using a Soloflex.  The other boy, ostensibly the rebel, lacks stick-to-itiveness and doesn't like anyone.  Huh?  He gloms onto the female lead immediately.  And later, the nerd complains that the girl seems to be attracted more to the rebel than him.  She says she likes them both equally.  Huh?  She was just skinny dipping with the rebel (and presumably made love to him).The nerdy brother, who isn't very nerdy at all, portrays his character as an ""aw shucks"" sort of boy, who is wholesome and sincere....I kept hoping he would fall off one of those really tall cliffs in the film.The rebel is about a sharp as silly putty and his whole ""I gotta get off this island"" routine never seems believable or sincere.  He's supposed to be the Indiana Jones of the group, but instead he comes off more as the irritating little brother.Mind you the source material never had a real story to go with it.  It was just pictures of a fantastical people and land.  The producers of this film apparently didn't see any need in delving deeper than that - not really - in presenting this film.  It looks good, but there's no real substance to it.This is a film to be watched by small kids.  They'll love it.  If they're over 13, they'll probably be bored and would prefer watching PBS......the dinosaurs - oh yeah.  There were those too.

However, the script writers cheapened that imaginary world enormously by adding a pat & well-abused plot formula that LotR did well, but too many writers have copied since. Just add a precious object that the main character(s) pursue, and an ending battle that hinges upon that precious object! Too many writers, both of scripts & of novels, have abused this plot formula and turned it into a cheap pink flamingo that looks pretty, but smacks of a lack of culture & imagination.I think kids are going to be enthralled by the dinosaurs alone - Script writers don't need to add something as cheap & artificial as sunstones that save the day to keep people engaged. Dinotopia book fans were going to watch this series no matter what, and people who haven't experienced the book aren't going to be drawn to watch the series by sunstones. They'll be drawn in by the dinosaur-utopia plot, which is what the book was about. Duh.Here's what financiers and writers should already know: People will be enthralled by passion, creativity, and the maturation & developing wisdom of characters, not by supposedly popular plot arcs.

704013,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B0000687CX,Ian,"[14, 38]","Poor ABC.  They havent been doing too well latley.  In an effort to save themselfes, they made a TV movie called Dinotopia.  Sadley, this movie and the series that is following it, have failed mysrembly.  Way back, about 4 years ago, when I heard that ABC was doing a adaption of Dinotopia, I was very excited, being a gargantuan fan of books.  I was very excited when they started the movie on ABC.  When it was over, I simply sat stunned, amazed at how BAD the adaption of one of my favorite book series was.  Ok, its more like a semi-adaption, because the movie takes place in the modern era.  One day, a father and his 2 sons take of in a small airplane.  The father decides to take a nap and let his sons fly the plane.  4 hours later,They stupidly fly into a hurricane and unsiprisingly, they crash, and, you gussed it, the dad perishes.  From that point on, the movies flaws hatch out of thier shells and start running amuck.  For one thing, what father would let his sons pilot a plane?  How could the 2 kids survive in a hurricane with no raft, no life jackets, no flares etc.  for over 5 hours?After landing on the island, they meet a suspicoious man who befriends them and takes them to some poorly constructed sets, I mean village.  There they encounter a terrifying poorly made CGI dinosaur that is subdued by a lady (A very attractive lady of course) and then they head for waterfall city.  From that point on, they try to adapt to life in a dino island while trying to survive being complete idiots.  They love to swear (Nothing big, this being a ABC film), love to hate each other, and are completly obsessed with getting away.  So much in fact that one of them takes a stone that powers a villiage in exchange for a rowboat to sail home with, a useless map, and no provisions.  And on top of that, he has to sail across a deadly reef, find a path home with no compass, and dont forget that he flew for over 4 hours before crashing and that he had to stay afloat for over 5 hours.  And there is a hurricane on the horizon.  You really wonder how these people managed to get through grade school.  These errors are everywhere.  The mayor of Waterfall city is a complete arrogant stuborn idiot who refuses to evacuate anybody when killer birds are heading straight for the city, even though they have a few hours to evacuate. (In the series, how come they can evacuate everybody in a few hours while they cant in the movie?)My favorite part of the movie is how dumb some of the moments can be later on in the movie, along with some continuity errors.The World Beneath, which is breathtaking in the books, meerly consists of 1 or 2 tunnels used over and over agian, and a tiny crystal cavern.  In these tunnels our heroes encounter one of the least suprising plot twists in T.V. movie history.  (How did he get there?)  The continuity errors are hysterical.  At one point, a skybak instructor tells the students that if thier bird dosent show up, they can never be skybak riders.  Of course, our heroes bird dosent show up and he fails, yet when he tries again, he passes and the instructor does nothing.  When a charachter is attacked by another charachter, tossed in a sack and tossed into a river to die, he shows up, unharmed and none the worse for wear a few scenes later with no explenation as to how he got there.  Huh?The biggest flaw in the entire film has got to be the final battle, where Evil Pteridactals attack waterfall city.  That sounds Ok, but in execution, the scene is unintentionally hilarious.  When the birds attack, all the citizens run around screaming, yet nobody thinks about running inside a building.  Our heroes arrive just in time, and in a atrociously poorly animated sequence, they manage to help save the city.  And come on, Pteridactals are really LAME villians.  Why not a Tyranosaur?  (They only show up once for about a minute early on)  There is however, one bright spot.  Zippo the librarian is a funny, interesting charachtewr that is the best actor in the entire film.  The list just goes on and on, and I'm out of room, so in closing, no matter how you cut it, Dinotopia is a Brachiasour sized disaster.The good:ZippoSome unintentially funny scenesyou can have fun counting out all the bad elements in the filmThe bad:noneThe ugly:atrocious actingbad scriptlousy CGI effectsbad setslots of continuity errorsSummary:Only good for those who have never read the books.

And perhaps the only thing worse than the acting is the directing.Having said all that, however, the bottom line is my younger kids thoroughly enjoyed it.

I rented this movie and had my finger poised on the pause button in case the action became out of hand. My daughter, 5 years old and dino-infatuated,had run the gamut on most age appropriate dinosaur fare. Obviously, not ready for the bloodier ""Jurassic Park"" series by Universal. Well, we made it through the whole long miniseries and the violence is very muted. No worse than anything seen or suggested in the original ""Harry Potter"" movie. Things that are good:-Most of the action and situational stress gets resolved favorably and peacefully,-The adversarial relationships with carnivores is just part of life. As one character says,""They are not worse than us, they just do what they do...""-The overall message is brighter and utopian(unlike Potter or the later Star Wars movies)-Unity and understanding with all creatures and planet is the overarching message-The 2 main characters have character flaws that aren't necessarily bad, but need to be modified with love,understanding and education-Well cast set of British Supporting Actors-Overall easy watch but has some good depth if you pay attention-Upbeat,in a Star Trek way-CGI is great for TV.

It was plotless, the acting was bad, the dinosaurs were underused as characters, and the editing often left you wondering what had happened. It was hard to feel sympathy for any of the characters, especially the insular, self-righteous Dinotopians as they try to brainwash the two newcomers to their world. I found myself most in sympathy with Cyrus Crabbe, which is surely not what the makers intended.

704019,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,B0000687CX,Keith_Joseph,"[4, 4]","My son (now 10) and our family fell in love with this original Emmy award winning Dinotopia mini-series with it's 'all star' cast. It's a two DVD set edited into a superb long film (running over to the second DVD). Personally I prefer serials like these kept to their original episodes and credits to maintain pace and the episode cliff hanger, particularly for the kids at bedtime, but this film works quite well. The DVD set includes an actually interesting 'making of' featurette. Initially my son absolutely couldn't tolerate the spin off Dinotopia full series than came later when they changed all the actors, and has taken a few years to get round to watching his multi-DVD `series' set despite viewing this original Dinotopia film many times. The spin-off series has a more jocular mood with the charactor's presented in a more likeable way than the moody, angry and pious (bordering on pompous in the Mayor's case) tone of this original.All the family preferred this film's darker style, with classy Brit's Katie Carr and Jim Carter as the Dinotopians and American's Wentworth Miller and David Thewlis as the believable in-fighting step-brother's coping with their sudden change of lifestyle and recent loss of their father. I also really, really loved Lee Evans as dinosaur Zippo's voice, Terry Jone's as the messenger's birds voice and Canadian Tyron Leitso as hustler Cyrus Crabb. None of these actors carried over to the spin-off series - but of course any Dinotopia is better than nothing so check out the series as well - it's particularly cheap via Amozon resellers in NTSC. The darker nature of this DVD set is well suited to older pre-teens and teenagers (probably boys mainly), as many of the rampaging carnivore dinosaur scenes are a bit scary (but definitely not as much as Jurassic Park - although in heavily populated Dinotopia the body count does pile up more).So overall, highly recommended, particularly as no more promised Dinotopia seems to have materialised. Picture & sound quality is superb, and the special effects are quite dazzling (particularly Waterfall City). This miniseries looks like it cost a million dollars. Well actually it cost 86 million dollars - with the single dino-hatchling animatronic character costing $100,000 alone. We got this DVD set very cheaply via Amazon resellers as the NTSC set, and our fuzzy VHS copies are now in the bin.

In order to live in this perfect harmony, the government body of Dinotopia has discovered (and enacted) a set of ancient laws that make everybody (dinos and humans alike) essentially equal.  However, with this equality comes repression.  Repression in that the government basically appoints each individual into a position (or job) in what are basically communes that they think would be best suited for that person to help benefit the overall Dinotopia community.  So regardless of what one actually wants to do, the government says that you will do this (and like it) whether you want to do it or not.  By forcing folks to do jobs they don't or are really suited for, it prevents them from excelling at what they're truely great at and more suited to do.This experiment is exactly why Utopian, ie. Communist and Socialist societies almost always fail.  Forced placement runs contrary to human nature.  Utopioan societies such as what Dinotopia tries to achieve also requires everyone to agree to this kind of system to work otherwise the system fails.  You get just one person out of a hundred that disagrees with the system, the system breaks down and if you were in Stalinist Russia, you would &quot;disappear&quot;.  One other disturbing aspect to these Dinotopian laws were that they weren't meant for questioning.  Accept them at all costs, freedom of speech is quelled.  This aspect comes into play in the overall story.But anyway, the film itself is visually stunning.  State-of-the-art computer graphics bring live inaction between dinosaurs and humans for the first time.  You thought Jurassic Park was something?  Dinotopia blows the socks off of Jurassic Park.  For the first time in film and CGI history, the CGI computers were used on-set right along the film cameras so that they could visually track low-res CGI models of the dinos through the shots of live action.  This was required so that the inter-action between dino and human would look realistic.  The only negatives I could see about the CGI, was perhaps the lack of shadow dileniation on the CGI dinos.  There was some, but not enough to give it that totally realistic look.  In other words the CGI was too clean.  The film runs into the 4-hour mark and has probably the most visual effects shots in any non-animated film.The only negatives about the film is probably the overall story.  To me, it was a bit simplistic.  The Utopian society was protected from the carnivores by a series of Sun Stones, crystals left over from the big asteroid.  However these Stones were losing their strength thus jeopardizing the safety of the Waterfall City, Dinotopia's capital, from the carnivores.  It came down to the &quot;new comers&quot; with the cojohones to break the strict Dinotopia rules to discover new Stones.",4,Equality through Repression,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,2940,"['Dinotopia', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'island', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'where', 'Dinosaurs', 'Humans', 'live', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'harmony', 'Utopian', 'society', 'order', 'live', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'government', 'body', 'Dinotopia', 'discovered', 'enacted', 'set', 'ancient', 'laws', 'make', 'everybody', 'dinos', 'humans', 'alike', 'essentially', 'equal', 'However', 'equality', 'repression', 'Repression', 'government', 'basically', 'individual', 'position', 'job', 'what', 'are', 'basically', 'communes', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'person', 'help', 'benefit', 'overall', 'Dinotopia', 'community', 'So', 'regardless', 'what', 'one', 'actually', 'do', 'government', 'will', 'do', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'forcing', 'folks', 'do', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'really', 'suited', 'excelling', 'what', ""'re"", 'truely', 'great', 'more', 'suited', 'do.This', 'experiment', 'exactly', 'why', 'Utopian', 'ie', 'Communist', 'Socialist', 'societies', 'almost', 'always', 'fail', 'Forced', 'placement', 'contrary', 'human', 'nature', 'Utopioan', 'societies', 'such', 'what', 'Dinotopia', 'achieve', 'also', 'everyone', 'agree', 'kind', 'system', 'work', 'otherwise', 'system', 'get', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'hundred', 'system', 'system', 'down', 'were', 'Stalinist', 'Russia', 'would', 'quot', 'disappear', 'quot', 'One', 'other', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'Dinotopian', 'laws', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'questioning', 'Accept', 'costs', 'freedom', 'speech', 'quelled', 'aspect', 'play', 'overall', 'story.But', 'anyway', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'State-of-the-art', 'computer', 'graphics', 'bring', 'live', 'inaction', 'dinosaurs', 'humans', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'was', 'something', 'Dinotopia', 'socks', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'CGI', 'history', 'CGI', 'computers', 'were', 'used', 'on-set', 'right', 'film', 'cameras', 'so', 'could', 'visually', 'track', 'low-res', 'CGI', 'models', 'dinos', 'shots', 'live', 'action', 'was', 'required', 'so', 'inter-action', 'dino', 'human', 'would', 'look', 'realistic', 'only', 'negatives', 'could', 'see', 'CGI', 'was', 'perhaps', 'lack', 'shadow', 'dileniation', 'CGI', 'dinos', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'totally', 'realistic', 'look', 'other', 'words', 'CGI', 'was', 'too', 'clean', 'film', '4-hour', 'mark', 'probably', 'most', 'visual', 'effects', 'shots', 'non-animated', 'film.The', 'only', 'film', 'probably', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'Utopian', 'society', 'was', 'protected', 'carnivores', 'series', 'Sun', 'Stones', 'crystals', 'left', 'over', 'big', 'asteroid', 'However', 'Stones', 'were', 'losing', 'strength', 'thus', 'jeopardizing', 'safety', 'Waterfall', 'City', 'Dinotopia', 'capital', 'carnivores', 'came', 'down', 'quot', 'new', 'comers', 'quot', 'cojohones', 'break', 'strict', 'Dinotopia', 'rules', 'discover', 'new', 'Stones']",N/A

704029,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000687CX,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[5, 7]","At the risk of incurring the wrath of nearly every other reviewer for 'Dinotopia' who seem to love the film, I'm forced to uphold my opinion that this miniseries isn't actually very good. I'm astounded that so many people quite happily went along with it and that it actually scored an Emmy nomination for best miniseries (though it lost to Bad of Brothers). There are so many logic errors, bad lines, unfinished sub-plots, pointless scenes, terrible acting and confusing story devices that my father and I, who were watching it together, were continually exchanging baffled glances.The story goes that two half brothers Karl and David are flying with their father when they hit a storm. The plane goes down, their father presumably dies and they are drifted ashore to a seemingly deserted island. In a matter of a few seconds they shrug off the death of their father (Karl literally says: ""Well, we did all we could"", and then moves on) and soon meet up with Cyrus Crabbe, who introduces himself as an explorer and investigator before accompanying them to a nearby village. It is here that the boys realise this island is not all it seems as they witness a dinosaur rampaging the streets. Again they show their remarkable ability to shrug off rather life altering truths by saying: ""Didn't dinosaurs die out millions of years ago?"" and then immediatly accepting it. It is then they meet up with Marion, the lovely daughter of the mayor of Waterfall City who accompanies them to her home city to register themselves as citizen of Dinotopia, the one place in the world where humans and dinosaurs live together in peace, undiscovered by the rest of the world. Solitary, book-worm David is soon delighted by the utopian society and begins to flourish, whilst twenty-first century Karl is desparate to return home. However, there is disaster on the horizon. The Dinotopian's sunstones - the source of all their energy - are failing (though we never find out why) and the carnivores of the island are now running in packs, something they've never done before (though again we never find out why that is). When the boys discover a gateway to the 'World Beneath', said to be the birthplace of the humans and dinosaurs of the island, they want to go exploring to find some answers, but the authorities forbid them.In terms of the story it is quite a disjointed one: the boys adapt far to quickly to their father's death and the new enviroment they're put in, and events and situations keep changing - one moment the boys are trekking through a jungle towards a forgotten gateway, the next they've separated - one at a hatchery, the other at a flying school. As well as this Cyrus Crabbe is lurking around, there's the failing sunstones, the World Beneath, the uncompleted love triangle between the boys and Marion, the unrealised relationship between the brothers, and Dinotopia is seen both as a social paradise and a restrictive area where there is no room for change or growth away from tradition. All these plots are jammed into the one movie, most of them remain unresolved. The film-maker's technique of jumping from one sub-plot to the next is confusing to say the least.Likewise, there are some terrible logic flaws. Usually I can easily tolerate a few that are used to keep the pace going, but there were just so many, so close together that the movie actually felt random. Why did they leave the safety of the buses to camp out in a half-destroyed village? How did a superior society get such an idiot elected for mayor? How did a half destroyed submarine manage to take three people to the World Beneath? Why didn't Crabbe get punished for knocking out a dinosaur and chucking him in the river? How did Karl know Crabbe has sabotaged his boat? For that matter, why *did* Crabbe sabotage his boat? His adjenda is never fully explained.These faults along with the shaky story made it feel as if they made the whole thing up as they went along, or at least were too preoccupied with the special effects to give much thought to the story.The actors portraying Karl and David were unfortunatly very poor, delievering their lines with little to no emotion. Perhaps Karl does a better job than David, for even David's movements were awkward and un-natural. Marion fares a little better, but still questions abound - which boy did she like? What did her mother mean when she said Marion's element wasn't earth, sea or sky? What was she actually doing when she waved her hands over sick people?I was quite prepared to enjoy this movie, and it wasn't as if I totally disliked it - the dinosaurs were amazing, there were a few funny moments, and I appreciated hearing the names Arthur and Will Denison, Sylvia and Lee Crabbe - but on the whole it was a very patchy story with far too many random events that didn't make sense for me to find it re-watchable.",2,"Looks fantastic, but no substance",1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,4849,"['risk', 'incurring', 'wrath', 'nearly', 'other', 'reviewer', ""'Dinotopia"", 'who', 'seem',

704030,ADV3V1ZR99UYN,B0000687CX,"Sandy ""alice-in-wonderland""","[0, 0]","I'd read Dinotopia: A Land Apart From Time By James Gurney years ago. Its format-a journal like book, full of spectacular painted pictures of Dinosaurs living amoungst humans (or perhaps the other way around) was exciting to me, and I loved the book straight off, with it's lovely illustrations and even better story, with superb characters and a wonderful plotline.When I heard about this series debut as a ""mega series"" on TV, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some rumours, and I believed that the storyline had been changed. (I was getting ready to be disappointed.)I was wrong. This charming and wonderful movie is what takes place after the book...and I was thrilled to hear the books characters names-Lee Crabb, Will and Arthur Denison and Sylvia of the Hatchery, intertwined with the story of David and Karl.David and Karl are half brothers, who were never close and couldn't be more different. Karl is defiant and modernized, while Dave prefers to stay at home, reading books and being alone. But their father ask them to go on a plane trip in his personal plane, and reluctantly they agree. Their father puts Karl that the controls, and they're off.But quickly, they run into a severe storm, and the plane crashes into the ocean below them. Quickly fighting to get out, Karl and David go to the surface, only to find that their father is not with them.Presuming he is dead, they are practically washed upon a strange island, which at first seems to be empty of life.As they explore, trying to find someone to help them, they find a carved head of some creature.  Suddenly, a loud explosion comes from within it, and it blows somewhat apart.There they meet the peg-legged Cyrus Crabb, who informs them that he was on some sort of archaeological job, and that they've been washed upon ""Dinotopia"".He takes them to the village nearby, and to their intense amazement, they come across an angry dinosaur, flinging it's spiked tail at huts and stand along the roads of the small town. A girl mysteriously appears, and soothes it into submission.The next day, Karl and David travel with the girl-Marion, daughter of the mayor of Waterfall city,who they will eventually BOTH fall in love with (and does this create conflict)  to find out more about where they are and try to find a way to make it back home...but little do they know, they will be needed to help and save the entire island of Dinotopia from destruction, aided by a scholarly dinosaur anemd Zippo, a new baby Twenty-Six (aptly named by Karl, who has not much imagination) and the maybe trustworthy Cyrus Crabb.It is an enchanting movie, great for true lovers of the Dinotopia books or just fans of Dinos or great movies, it was much better than I ever hoped it would be.

I had read other reviews for the miniseries and a few people said when they ordered the TV miniseries from Amazon they didn't get the right DVD's and instead got the DVD's of a different movie version of dinotopia in the miniseries DVD case.  This wasn't a problem from Amazon but a problem from the distributing companies.  I am happy to say I think this matter has been resolved because upon receiving my copy today both of the disks were correct.  I had first seen this miniseries quite a few years ago when it aired on ABC.  I was delighted when I found it on Amazon as I didn't know it had even come out on DVD or video.  When I got it today I watched it right away because it was such a long time since I had seen it.  I also wanted to make sure the disks were right because some of the reviews on Amazon had mentioned a DVD mix up.  I am happy to say both DVD's were correct and were in great condition since I ordered the DVD as new and not used.  I am happy with Amazons shipping and packaging and was surprised at how fast my order came.  I am happy that I now own such a great miniseries/movie.

Despite some excellent special effects -- not up to Spielberg quality, mind you, but pretty good for a Hallmark special -- the movie plods like a 60-ton brachiosaurus with a sore foot and a brain the size of a walnut.The biggest problem is that these two young men, cynical though they may be, find themselves stranded on an island populated by dinosaurs -- some of the intellectual and speaking variety, no less -- and they forget to be astonished. Really. Not once did I get a sense of &quot;oh wow&quot; from these guys. Then again, they're not big on emotional reactions from scene one.Kids will adore it, assuming they're not yet old enough for the Jurassic Park franchise and haven't seen dinosaurs in realistic-looking, in-your-face action.

704034,A2BQ2H26EXT0X9,B0000687CX,W. Handy,"[6, 6]","This is a good film for kids. For us adults, the relentlessly high-minded moralizing can get a bit thick - even when, as I did, we sympathize with the values.  The acting also left much to be desired at times. At first I was thrilled at how good the science was - they used real dinosaur species and (again at first) called them by their right names. Then they got sloppy. An ancient temple was guarded by prehistoric crocodilians (not sure if they were accurately portrayed) that were misidentified as mosasaurs. Those were also water-going species, but much larger, with longer, more flexible, paddle-like tails - very different beasts. Then the rebellious brother got a saurian partner that was identified as a hadrosaur, but in fact was a ceratopsid. The hadrosaurs were the duck-billed dinosaurs who went sometimes on four legs, sometimes two, and who tended to have high, narrow crests on their heads and broad, blunt mouths. The best known ceratopsid was the triceratops - two long horns from the forehead, broad semi-circular crest behind the head, nose horn, beak-like mouth; decidedly quadripedal. The baby in the show was a real ceratopsian species, though I can't identify it off-hand.  It certainly was no hadrosaur. The puzzling thing is that I'm sure there are thousands of 8 to 12 year olds out there who flocked to see this show and who picked up on the errors immediately.  Heck, I would have at that age, and there is so much more information now.
