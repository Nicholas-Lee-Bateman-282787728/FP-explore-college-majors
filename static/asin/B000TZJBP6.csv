She gets pregnant and emotional once she finds out.The characters are funny and many, attractive. The dialogue wasn't too shabby but they swear a lot.

Unfortunately, the father-to-be (Seth Rogen) isn't exactly ideal family material, being a stranger to details like work and responsibility, but to his credit he doesn't break the record for the 100 meter sprint and tries to do the right thing.They have so little in common that it's a wonder that the little cells managed to get together in the first place, but then again, Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) aren't doing so great either.Funny in places, but long and drawn out in others, this could have been a really good one hour sitcom episode, but at more than two hours, you may experience birthing pains before the credits begin to roll.Rated 3.5 stars(Note: Profanity laden, with adult situations, and may be traumatic to people who are pregnant for the first time.)Amanda Richards, August 26, 2007",4,The latest odd couple,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1550,"['never', 'did', 'Paul', 'Anka', 'song', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'movie.Havin', 'perfect', 'way', 'provingWhen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easyHavin', 'simple', 'way', 'knowingYou', 'were', 'drunk', 'crazyI', 'can', 'see', 'nausea', 'growingI', 'can', 'see', 'eyesYou', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'know', ""'re"", 'havin', 'baby.Yep', 'title', 'movie', 'will', 'confirm', 'one', 'night', 'drunken', 'partying', 'can', 'lead', 'barely', 'remembered', 'episode', 'making', 'unprotected', 'whoopee', 'turn', 'can', 'lead', 'predicament', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', '.Recently', 'promoted', 'work', 'Alison', 'camera', 'will', 'hide', 'pounds', 'beginning', 'pack', 'deal', 'new', 'developments', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'father-to-be', 'Seth', 'Rogen', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ideal', 'family', 'material', 'being', 'stranger', 'details', 'work', 'responsibility', 'credit', ""n't"", 'break', 'record', '100', 'meter', 'sprint', 'tries', 'do', 'right', 'thing.They', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'common', 'wonder', 'little', 'cells', 'managed', 'get', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'again', 'Alison', 'sister', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'so', 'great', 'either.Funny', 'places', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'hour', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'may', 'experience', 'birthing', 'pains', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll.Rated', '3.5', 'stars', 'Note', 'Profanity', 'adult', 'situations', 'may', 'be', 'traumatic', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'pregnant', 'first', 'time', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'August', '26', '2007']",Knocked Up

1092731,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000TZJBP6,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'm not really sure why it took me so long to actually see this movie, but last night I sat down with some sour patch kids and a 7-Up and braced myself for that comedy that every one of my friends told me was utterly hilarious.  I know that it has its detractors, but by and large `Knocked Up' is considered a very funny movie, and I have to agree.  What is so much better than just being funny is that the film actually makes good of its soft center.  I actually cried (once).Like my review titled states; I laughed, I cried, I thoroughly enjoyed.The film follows the outcome of a drunken one-night stand between man-boy slacker Ben and financially unstable business woman Alison.  Almost immediately after they awaken, Alison knows that Ben is not suitable dating material (he has no job, no phone and is quite vulgar) but eight weeks later she is forced back into his life when she finds out she is pregnant.  Alison, who is living with her sister Debbie and brother-in-law Pete, decides to give a relationship a shot with Ben, and she realizes that behind all that immaturity is a really decent guy (charming and caring and genuinely sweet).  Of course, with pregnancy comes drama, drama that is exaggerated due to difference between these two opposites, but `Knocked Up' handles these Hollywood clich&eacute;s in a fresh way that excites and entertains.I find it odd that the films star Katherine Heigl had such a scathing remark to make of the film.She said:""It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,"" she says. ""It was hard for me to love the movie.""I actually felt that the film was pretty accurate in its portrayal of relationships between men and women.  It has to be pointed out that this is a comedy and that comedies, especially of this nature, are prone to exaggerate truths, but the fact still remains that they are truths.  Besides, we are not dealing with all women but with two very specific types; single pregnant women and middle-aged married women with children.  The hormones that reign Queen with those two types I feel are represented (with embellishments) rather truthfully here.  And let's not forget that the men are presented in a less than perfect light as well.  Sure, they are `fun-loving' but they are all brazenly immature.  While I completely understand Pete's need to get away and have a break, the way in which he does it is rather selfish, and I totally sided with Debbie (even if she did go overboard).  You see, both sides are handed a fair share of critisism, even if the men are painted in a more likable light; but that's because we are fun-loving (to a fault at times).In the end, both sides have to work towards a compromise.As far as the acting is concerned, for the most part everyone works wonderfully.  Seth Rogan has this really sweet and charming likableness to him; you just want to get to know him.  Katherine Heigl plays her part beautifully, and really gets to the heart of this woman who just wants to be happy but doesn't understand what it is that will make her happy.  The supporting cast is also pretty great; especially Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, who chew up the scenery as Debbie and Pete.  Mann is truly well rounded, providing just enough vulnerability (that breakdown when she uncovers Pete's `secret' is just fantastic) to make her cold exterior forgivable.  Ben's slacker buddies are all merely background fluff, but I was shocked that I really disliked Jason Segel here.  I really liked him in `I Love You, Man' where he was creepy but in a strangely charming kind of way.  Here, he's just creepy.  I want to bring up that Kristen Wiig and the sadly underused Alan Tudyk have very small yet very memorable cameos here.LOVE THEM.In the end, I really enjoyed this film.  It has some parts that wane on the unrealistic (the doctor at the end is completely unbelievable and kind of annoying when you think about it...I mean, if our doctor had responded that way when my daughter was born I would have punched her in the face without any hesitation) but overall it is a really charming and fun movie.  Part of me wanted to give this five-stars, but it isn't perfect and it isn't as well rounded as, say `I Love You, Man' or `Superbad', but it is definitely a film I'd recommend.And yes, like I said, I cried; when that Loudon Wainwright III song `Daughter' comes on during the closing credits I just couldn't contain myself.Now, if a slapstick comedy like `Knocked Up' can illicit that kind of a reaction you know it is worth watching.",4,"I laughed, I cried, I thoroughly enjoyed...",1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,4570,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'sat', 'down', 'sour', 'patch', 'kids', '7-Up', 'braced', 'comedy', 'one', 'friends', 'told', 'was', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'know', 'detractors', 'large', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'considered', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'have', 'agree', 'What', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'being', 'funny', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'soft', 'center', 'actually', 'cried', 'once', '.Like', 'review', 'titled', 'states', 'laughed', 'cried', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed.The', 'film', 'outcome', 'drunken', 'one-night', 'stand', 'man-boy', 'slacker', 'Ben', 'financially', 'unstable', 'business', 'woman', 'Alison', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'awaken', 'Alison', 'Ben', 'not', 'suitable', 'dating', 'material', 'job', 'phone', 'quite', 'vulgar', 'eight', 'weeks', 'later', 'forced', 'back', 'life', 'when', 'pregnant', 'Alison', 'who', 'living', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'brother-in-law', 'Pete', 'give', 'relationship', 'shot', 'Ben', 'immaturity', 'really', 'decent', 'guy', 'charming', 'caring', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'course', 'pregnancy', 'drama', 'drama', 'exaggerated', 'due', 'difference', 'two', 'opposites', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'handles', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'fresh', 'way', 'entertains.I', 'find', 'odd', 'films', 'star', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'had', 'scathing', 'remark', 'make', 'film.She', 'said', 'women', 'shrews', 'humorless', 'uptight', 'men', 'lovable', 'goofy', 'fun-loving', 'guys', 'was', 'hard', 'love', 'movie', 'actually', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'relationships', 'men', 'women', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'comedy', 'comedies', 'especially', 'nature', 'are', 'prone', 'exaggerate', 'truths', 'fact', 'still', 'are', 'truths', 'are', 'not', 'dealing', 'women', 'two', 'very', 'specific', 'types', 'single', 'pregnant', 'women', 'middle-aged', 'married', 'women', 'children', 'hormones', 'reign', 'Queen', 'two', 'types', 'feel', 'are', 'represented', 'embellishments', 'rather', 'truthfully', 'here', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'men', 'are', 'presented', 'less', 'perfect', 'light', 'as', 'well', 'Sure', 'are', 'fun-loving', 'are', 'brazenly', 'immature', 'completely', 'understand', 'Pete', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'have', 'break', 'way', 'rather', 'selfish', 'totally', 'sided', 'Debbie', 'even', 'did', 'go', 'overboard', 'see', 'sides', 'are', 'handed', 'fair', 'share', 'critisism', 'even', 'men', 'are', 'painted', 'more', 'likable', 'light', 'are', 'fun-loving', 'fault', 'times', '.In', 'end', 'sides', 'have', 'work', 'towards', 'compromise.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'most', 'part', 'everyone', 'wonderfully', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'really', 'sweet', 'charming', 'likableness', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'part', 'beautifully', 'really', 'heart', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'happy', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'happy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'pretty', 'great', 'especially', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'Debbie', 'Pete', 'Mann', 'truly', 'well', 'rounded', 'providing', 'just', 'enough', 'vulnerability', 'breakdown', 'when', 'Pete', 'secret', 'just', 'fantastic', 'make', 'cold', 'exterior', 'forgivable', 'Ben', 'slacker', 'buddies', 'are', 'merely', 'fluff', 'was', 'shocked', 'really', 'disliked', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'here', 'really', 'liked', 'Love', 'Man', 'where', 'was', 'creepy', 'strangely', 'charming', 'kind', 'way', 'Here', 'just', 'creepy', 'want', 'bring', 'up', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'sadly', 'underused', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'yet', 'very', 'memorable', 'cameos', 'here.LOVE', 'THEM.In', 'end', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'parts', 'wane', 'unrealistic', 'doctor', 'end', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'kind', 'annoying', 'when', 'think', 'mean', 'doctor', 'had', 'responded', 'way', 'when', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', 'would', 'have', 'punched', 'face', 'hesitation', 'overall', 'really', 'charming', 'fun', 'movie', 'Part', 'wanted', 'give', 'five-stars', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'rounded', 'say', 'Love', 'Man', 'Superbad', 'definitely', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend.And', 'yes', 'said', 'cried', 'when', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'III', 'song', 'Daughter', 'closing', 'credits', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'contain', 'myself.Now', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'can', 'illicit', 'kind', 'reaction', 'know', 'worth', 'watching']",Knocked Up

SUPERBAD does seem to be the most popular thus far  but KNOCKED UP is in the same league for me.Story line is pretty basic.  We have an average stoner guy and a beautiful professional woman who meet at a bar, get drunk, have sex and she gets pregnant.  In real life such different types of people may not try to make  a relationship work but here it is very believable and the development of each character about life, love and acceptance is very realistic as the pregnancy develops.  Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are in top form as their lives are forever altered.  Dialogue is funny, circumstances are realistic and having the marriage of Heigl's sister to compare with works great.  Paul Rudd shines here and steals all the scenes he is in.This is a bawdy comedy but manages to put across positive messages about safe sex, responsibility and the fact that relationships can be difficult.  It is not a message film by any means but it manages to spread a good positive vein about life and its complications.Blu ray usually is put to its best use with action films or films with great cinematography which show how the 1080p can be brilliant and how audio can transcend.  Comedies can sometimes appear bland on blu ray but this film is crisp, colors are vibrant and video and audio are both at levels above that of the regular dvd.  There is much talk of this movie being too long.  For me it was not.  You will either love it or you won't.

This film is very entertaining but it also reveals a great deal about our contemporary love relationships. The interaction between the married couple--Alison Scott's sister and her husband--is ingloriously reflective of many of the relationships that I've observed. Their strained and unique bond will hit home with viewers. It's a situation that many of us find ourselves in nowadays.

1092742,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000TZJBP6,Bill Garrison,"[1, 19]","Knocked Up is a new movie from Judd Apatow, the man behind The Forty Year Old Virgin. I'm almost ashamed to admit I enjoyed the crude but surprisingly sweet ""Virgin."" Knocked Up gives you more of the same. It stars Seth Rogan, who had a hilarious supporting part in ""Virgin"", and Katherine Heigle, the beautiful current star of Grey's Anatomy. Heigle, playing E! reporter Allison Scott, goes out on the town to celebrate a big promotion. At the bar, she meets Ben (Rogan). Allison is beautiful (I can't emphasize that enough) and Ben is basically a slob. With shades of Notting Hill, they end up sleeping together. Eight weeks later Allison finds out she is pregnant.What is she going to do? She turns to her sister Debbi, played by Leslie Mann, for advice. Allison has a great career, and Ben is a pothead loser. She decides to keep the baby, and willingly allows Ben to be a part of the future baby's life.  Ben thus gets closer with Allison and Debbie and Debbie's husband Pete (played by Paul Rudd.) This movie is crude yet sweet, raunchy yet traditional. At the heart of the film is a romantic comedy. Yet it is filled with scenes with comically crass dialogue and all the anguish associated with having a baby.I'm not one of those people that think everything Apatow does is the greatest. I liked ""Virgin"" better than this, and I've never watched Freaks & Geeks, the 90s TV show whose cast plays a large part in this film. Knocked Up is a good movie with funny moments and emotional moments. It had a lot of good cameos too.I'll recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good raunchy comedy, but I do have a few complaints. First, this is a romantic comedy. In every romantic comedy, the leads get together, then conflict tears them apart, then they get back together. Usually, the getting back together is what makes or break the movie. In Knocked Up, Ben and Allison slowly grow to care about each other, but the conflict tears them apart. Pete and Debbie also have conflict. The movie is incredibly weak in showing how the conflict is resolved, and so I left the movie not totally buying into Ben and Allyson's relationship. My second complaint is that this movie is very very very pro drug use. Quite disappointing since smoking weed is ILLEGAL. Some might say it took an anti drug turn at the end, but I don't buy it. That was really disappointing and irresponsible in my opinion. I'm mature enough to enjoy a movie yet not buy into the message it is preaching. The movie could have been just as good without all of the promoting of illegal drug use.",3,"Funny movie, great characters, highly pro drug-use",1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,2564,"['Knocked', 'Up', 'new', 'movie', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'man', 'Forty', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', ""'m"", 'almost', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'crude', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'more', 'same', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'who', 'had', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'part', 'Virgin', 'Katherine', 'Heigle', 'beautiful', 'current', 'star', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Heigle', 'playing', 'E', 'reporter', 'Allison', 'Scott', 'out', 'town', 'celebrate', 'big', 'promotion', 'bar', 'Ben', 'Rogan', 'Allison', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'enough', 'Ben', 'basically', 'slob', 'shades', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'end', 'up', 'sleeping', 'together', 'Eight', 'weeks', 'later', 'Allison', 'out', 'pregnant.What', 'going', 'do', 'sister', 'Debbi', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'advice', 'Allison', 'great', 'career', 'Ben', 'pothead', 'loser', 'keep', 'baby', 'willingly', 'Ben', 'be', 'part', 'future', 'baby', 'life', 'Ben', 'thus', 'closer', 'Allison', 'Debbie', 'Debbie', 'husband', 'Pete', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'movie', 'crude', 'yet', 'sweet', 'raunchy', 'yet', 'traditional', 'heart', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'filled', 'scenes', 'comically', 'crass', 'dialogue', 'anguish', 'associated', 'having', 'baby.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'think', 'everything', 'Apatow', 'greatest', 'liked', 'Virgin', 'better', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', '90s', 'TV', 'show', 'cast', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'good', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'emotional', 'moments', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'cameos', 'too.I', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'good', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'First', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'leads', 'get', 'together', 'then', 'conflict', 'tears', 'apart', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Usually', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'what', 'break', 'movie', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Ben', 'Allison', 'slowly', 'grow', 'care', 'other', 'conflict', 'apart', 'Pete', 'Debbie', 'also', 'have', 'conflict', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'weak', 'showing', 'how', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'so', 'left', 'movie', 'not', 'totally', 'buying', 'Ben', 'Allyson', 'relationship', 'second', 'complaint', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'pro', 'drug', 'use', 'Quite', 'disappointing', 'smoking', 'weed', 'ILLEGAL', 'might', 'say', 'took', 'anti', 'drug', 'turn', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'irresponsible', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'mature', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'yet', 'not', 'buy', 'message', 'preaching', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'promoting', 'illegal', 'drug', 'use']",Knocked Up
1092743,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B000TZJBP6,billy,"[2, 2]","I'm usually fairly skeptical about movies like Knocked Up.  The previews made it seem like it was either a sentimental chick flick or a gross out comedy, two genres that I can usually do without.  In reality it's kind of a combination of both, with a little bit of slacker humor thrown in for good measure.  But if a chick flick and a gross out comedy can be done well, then Judd Apatow succeeds in making this one of the funniest (and best) movies that I've seen all year.Knocked Up is about a 20 something slacker named Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who basically does nothing all day but smoke pot and work on a website that tells people where nude scenes are in movies.  One night he meets beautiful Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an entertainment reporter for E at a club.  One thing leads to another and the two wind up in bed and Allison gets pregnant.  The rest of the movie shows Allison and Ben trying to put together a relationship, all the while watching Allison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) marriage go through ups and downs.With Knocked Up, Apatow continues his winning streak, creating yet another very funny, and sometimes meaningful and poignant comedy.  There are some very hilarious scenes throughout the movie.  The opening title sequence is hilarious, with Ben and his stoner buddies goofing around to Shimmy Shimmy Ya by Ol' Dirty Bastard.  The scene where Allison and Ben try to have sex while she's pregnant is very funny, and the interaction between Pete and Ben is hilarious because it's so dorky.  But Knocked Up also has some fairly poignant moments.  There is a lot of talk about the importance of love and commitment in a relationship.  Apatow has crafted a movie that isn't simply a bunch of goofs and stoner jokes, but actually has a heart and something important to say.One of the best things about Knocked Up is how tossed off everything feels.  It really does not feel like there is much acting going on here.  There is a fair bit of improvisation thrown around, and everyone in the cast has great chemistry.  Ben and Allison are both awkward at first but grow to love each other.  All of Ben's stoner friend's act like they've been friends for years and probably have.  Debbie and Pete portray perfectly a dysfunctional marriage.  Pete and Ben's hyper literate conversations come off like they have them all the time.  Every character is so well drawn and they all interact so perfectly that it doesn't really feel like your watching a movie.I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy good comedy and a good story with some heart.  I look forward to what Apatow can come up with next, and I look forward to Superbad, which Seth Rogen co-wrote.  It should be hilarious.

Although the plot is a bit contrived and unrealistic (the stoner dude with no ties would probably tuck tail and run when he found out about the pregnancy!), the acting is quite good with a cast that reflects the moral ambiguity of our times.This is the story of a one-night-stand that never should have happened. The girl, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is sexy, funny, and successful. The boy, Ben Stone (Seth Rogen,The 40-Year-Old Virgin) is a pot-smoking and frumpy loser with nearly pornographic ambitions.The two unawares meet up at a hoppin' club and bump into one another at the bar. Alison has already had too much to drink and Ben is also well on his way. The two dance, chat, and eventually end up in bed, much to the chagrin of Alison come coyote morning. The two happily separate from one another and both think that is that. But a few weeks later, Alison's morning sickness kicks in. She and her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann,Bottle Rocket) rush to the drug store and buy up every brand of pregnancy test they can find and, yep, that little red line shows up every time.Alison and Ben are thrust back together in the name of impending parenthood. Alison quickly decides that abortion is out of the question; she wants a kid and is already getting ""older."" Forced to either accept the pregnancy or leave Alison and her unborn child to circumstances, Ben tries to form a bond with Alison, only to have multiple obstacles thrown in his path. First is his lifestyle. He lives with a bunch of stoners who's only wish is to create a website that focuses on female nudity. Ben's father (Harold Ramis,The Ice Harvest, director) can't give much fatherly advice since he's a washed-up stoner, too. And Alison's sister Debbie doesn't really want him around.Alison and Ben's on-again off-again relationship seems doomed. The two have nothing in common except the pregnancy and the audience is left (for a while) to wonder if Alison wouldn't be better off raising her child away from Ben anyway.Eventually the fateful delivery day looms and Ben has set himself onto the path of fatherhood, moving himself away from his pot-smokin' days and buddies. Although Alison has shunned him, the two are forced back together again once Alison's labor begins and she has no way to get to the hospital. Rushing her through traffic, Ben gets her to the delivery suite and Alison and he are eventually united via the bonds of babydom.The funniest parts of the film are surprisingly not between Heigl and Rogen, but instead between Rogen and Paul Rudd (Night at the Museum), who plays Pete, Debbie's husband and Alison's brother-in-law, as they head to Vegas on a roadtrip after Debbie boots him out of the house and he finds solace with Ben. Their `shroom experience is absolutely fantastic and will probably have you wetting yourself (""There are five different kinds of chairs in this room."")This is, without a doubt, director Judd Apatow's best film to date; it's even aboveThe 40-Year-Old VirginandAnchorman. But it is unrealistic. People as varied as Ben and Alison DO NOT get together. And even if they initially did, they certainly wouldn't stay so. That said, I will say that it was refreshing to not see two hunky actors in the prime roles. Although Katherine Heigl is a damn fine looking lady, there are other actresses that certainly look better. And Seth Rogen appears as a sloth, which was an interesting dichotomy within the sexual portions of the film.",4,Unrealistic But Damn Funny,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,3549,"['KNOCKED', 'UP', 'funniest', 'dialog', 'delivery', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'ever', 'seen', 'past', 'year', 'plot', 'bit', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'stoner', 'dude', 'ties', 'would', 'probably', 'tuck', 'tail', 'run', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'pregnancy', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'cast', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'times.This', 'story', 'one-night-stand', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'girl', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'sexy', 'funny', 'successful', 'boy', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Seth', 'Rogen', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'pot-smoking', 'frumpy', 'loser', 'nearly', 'pornographic', 'ambitions.The', 'two', 'unawares', 'meet', 'up', 'hoppin', 'club', 'bump', 'one', 'bar', 'Alison', 'already', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'Ben', 'also', 'well', 'way', 'two', 'dance', 'chat', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'bed', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Alison', 'come', 'coyote', 'morning', 'two', 'happily', 'separate', 'one', 'think', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'Alison', 'morning', 'sickness', 'kicks', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'rush', 'drug', 'store', 'buy', 'up', 'brand', 'pregnancy', 'can', 'find', 'yep', 'little', 'red', 'line', 'up', 'time.Alison', 'Ben', 'are', 'thrust', 'back', 'together', 'name', 'impending', 'parenthood', 'Alison', 'quickly', 'abortion', 'question', 'kid', 'already', 'getting', 'older', 'Forced', 'accept', 'pregnancy', 'leave', 'Alison', 'unborn', 'child', 'circumstances', 'Ben', 'form', 'bond', 'Alison', 'only', 'have', 'multiple', 'obstacles', 'thrown', 'path', 'First', 'lifestyle', 'bunch', 'stoners', 'who', 'only', 'wish', 'create', 'website', 'female', 'nudity', 'Ben', 'father', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'fatherly', 'advice', 'washed-up', 'stoner', 'too', 'Alison', 'sister', 'Debbie', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'around.Alison', 'Ben', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'doomed', 'two', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'pregnancy', 'audience', 'left', 'while', 'wonder', 'Alison', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'raising', 'child', 'away', 'Ben', 'anyway.Eventually', 'fateful', 'delivery', 'day', 'Ben', 'set', 'path', 'fatherhood', 'moving', 'away', 'pot-smokin', 'days', 'buddies', 'Alison', 'shunned', 'two', 'are', 'forced', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'once', 'Alison', 'labor', 'begins', 'way', 'get', 'hospital', 'Rushing', 'traffic', 'Ben', 'delivery', 'suite', 'Alison', 'are', 'eventually', 'united', 'bonds', 'babydom.The', 'funniest', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'Heigl', 'Rogen', 'instead', 'Rogen', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Night', 'Museum', 'who', 'Pete', 'Debbie', 'husband', 'Alison', 'brother-in-law', 'head', 'Vegas', 'roadtrip', 'Debbie', 'boots', 'house', 'solace', 'Ben', 'shroom', 'experience', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'wetting', 'are', 'five', 'different', 'kinds', 'chairs', 'room', 'doubt', 'director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'even', 'aboveThe', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandAnchorman', 'unrealistic', 'People', 'as', 'varied', 'Ben', 'Alison', 'DO', 'NOT', 'get', 'together', 'even', 'initially', 'did', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'stay', 'so', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'refreshing', 'not', 'see', 'two', 'hunky', 'actors', 'prime', 'roles', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'damn', 'fine', 'looking', 'lady', 'are', 'other', 'actresses', 'certainly', 'look', 'better', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'sloth', 'was', 'interesting', 'dichotomy', 'sexual', 'portions', 'film']",Knocked Up

1092746,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B000TZJBP6,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 2]","I'm still trying to sort out my feelings from my first viewing of ""Knocked Up,"" a few days ago.  I gave ""40 Year-old Virgin"" four stars, but if I were to review it again, I've upgrade that to five.  Judd Apatow directed and put his personal stamp all over both films.  ""Virgin"" was hilarious, and the comedy seemed to be non-stop.  But I saw ""Knocked Up"" as anything but a comedy.  It seemed odd, uneven, and mostly dramatic to me, with some funny lines and situations sprinkled in here and there.The Alison Scott character represents pefection in a female love interest for jewish boys who not so secretly lust after tall, gorgeous, whistful, gentiles (shiksas).  (By the way, Director Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, who did a nice job acting in this movie, also fits this image) OK fine. The great thing about Apatow is that he enjoys going where others fear to tread (i.e., ""Virgin."")But in ""Knocked Up"" he goes way too far with Katherin Heigl's ""Alison Scott"" character. Yes, Heigl is perfect to look at in every way, but her Alison Scott is also smart, funny, nice, understanding, unattached with no baggage or critical friends, open-minded, mature, ambitious, sexy, interested in having sex (thats a big one for guys of all religions), and with the exception of a few minutes when she throws Seth Rogan out of the car in the middle of traffic, she spends the entire movie tirelessly searching for the tiny crumbs of redeeming characteristics in this friendly, but pathetic, ambitionless, and ugly slob pothead who got her pregnant.  In short, she's double, extra super perfect.  She might be the most desirable woman in the milky way galaxy. Making it too much of a stretch that she would persue a relationship with this man.I asked my wife, ""Have you ever noticed that beautiful women always get paired with ugly guys?""  She said, ""Are you just noticing that now?""  I said, ""Does it piss you off?""  She said, ""Stop talking.  That home improvement show with the gorgeous yet unskilled carpenter is coming on now, and I want to be able to focus.""Basically I found the entire movie to be completely unbelievable.  And this from a guy who had no problem believing Katherine Keener (another multi-attractive woman) could fall for a 40 year-old virgin. But ""Trish"" had faults that made her endearing and more believable as someone who might sacrifice alot in order to get a really nice guy (virgin).  Eventually I got rather pissed off at Apatow for thinking he could get me to buy into this situation.And I'm forced to admit, with all due credit to my lovely wife, maybe I was pissed at Seth Rogan for copping such absolute perfection in a life partner as a result of... years of hard work?  But no!  By picking up a gorgeous drunk woman in a bar (a repeating Apatow theme) and having sex with her.Maybe I need to buy some stupid t-shirts and a bong, quit my job, start eating more, stop shaving....",3,I've Never Reacted to a Movie Like This Before,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,2908,"[""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'first', 'viewing', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'gave', '40', 'Year-old', 'Virgin', 'four', 'stars', 'were', 'review', 'again', ""'ve"", 'upgrade', 'five', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'directed', 'put', 'personal', 'stamp', 'films', 'Virgin', 'was', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'seemed', 'be', 'non-stop', 'saw', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'anything', 'comedy', 'seemed', 'odd', 'uneven', 'mostly', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'lines', 'situations', 'sprinkled', 'here', 'there.The', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'character', 'pefection', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'jewish', 'boys', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'secretly', 'lust', 'tall', 'gorgeous', 'whistful', 'gentiles', 'shiksas', 'way', 'Director', 'Apatow', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'who', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'acting', 'movie', 'also', 'image', 'OK', 'fine', 'great', 'thing', 'Apatow', 'going', 'where', 'others', 'fear', 'tread', 'i.e.', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'Katherin', 'Heigl', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'character', 'Yes', 'Heigl', 'perfect', 'look', 'way', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'also', 'smart', 'funny', 'nice', 'understanding', 'unattached', 'baggage', 'critical', 'friends', 'open-minded', 'mature', 'ambitious', 'sexy', 'interested', 'having', 'sex', 'big', 'one', 'guys', 'religions', 'exception', 'few', 'minutes', 'when', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'car', 'middle', 'traffic', 'entire', 'movie', 'tirelessly', 'searching', 'tiny', 'crumbs', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'friendly', 'pathetic', 'ambitionless', 'ugly', 'slob', 'pothead', 'who', 'got', 'pregnant', 'short', 'double', 'extra', 'super', 'perfect', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'desirable', 'woman', 'milky', 'way', 'galaxy', 'Making', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'would', 'persue', 'relationship', 'man.I', 'asked', 'wife', 'Have', 'ever', 'noticed', 'beautiful', 'women', 'always', 'get', 'paired', 'ugly', 'guys', 'said', 'Are', 'just', 'noticing', 'now', 'said', 'piss', 'off', 'said', 'Stop', 'talking', 'home', 'improvement', 'show', 'gorgeous', 'yet', 'unskilled', 'carpenter', 'coming', 'now', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'focus', 'Basically', 'found', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'problem', 'believing', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'multi-attractive', 'woman', 'could', 'fall', '40', 'year-old', 'virgin', 'Trish', 'had', 'faults', 'made', 'endearing', 'more', 'believable', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'sacrifice', 'alot', 'order', 'get', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'virgin', 'Eventually', 'got', 'rather', 'pissed', 'off', 'Apatow', 'thinking', 'could', 'get', 'buy', 'situation.And', ""'m"", 'forced', 'admit', 'due', 'credit', 'lovely', 'wife', 'maybe', 'was', 'pissed', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'copping', 'such', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'life', 'partner', 'result', 'years', 'hard', 'work', 'picking', 'up', 'gorgeous', 'drunk', 'woman', 'bar', 'repeating', 'Apatow', 'theme', 'having', 'sex', 'her.Maybe', 'need', 'buy', 'stupid', 't-shirts', 'bong', 'quit', 'job', 'start', 'eating', 'more', 'stop', 'shaving']",Knocked Up

1092749,A3S5WYWYKSAI9C,B000TZJBP6,Bradley Olin,"[0, 0]","I thought the film was well done. It's fairly common today for people to forget that movies are surreal. As in they are not always an accurate reflection of reality, even if they portray familiar situations, environments, and interactions. While I laughed throughout the film, I can see that this movie is not going to be a hit with everyone. As a guy who has been lumped into the ""dork"" category before, I can say that this appeals to a younger audience of social misfits. The premise of the film is stretched thin at times, but the characters grow and seem mostly real, with a few exceptions. There were plenty of one-liners and raunchy humor balanced by genuinely endearing moments. The inconsistency and heavy reliance on juvenile humor made this a four star film for me, but it was still worth seeing in a theater, if only to laugh aloud with the audience.===POINT/COUNTERPOINT***1. Stoner and Juvenile Humor: The movie was inundated with pot-related references and jokes, including creative/adaptive smoking (fishbowl, gas mask, etc), simulated gay sex scenes while Ben (Seth Rogen) talks to his pregnant one night stand, a group of deadbeat post HS kids who live in a communal environment...the list goes on.My Response: Yes, the movie was rife with jokes that spoke mainly to the younger, desensitized generation. They did get old in places, but the argument here returns to understanding the demographic. Let's pretend this storyline took place between a man and woman in their late thirties instead of their early to mid twenties. The situations, characters, humor, and their friends, would be entirely different. These are not typical but fictional portrayals of a geek and his friends, and it's true to form.2. Profanity: It appeared that none of the characters were capable of expressing themselves without inserting expletives into their interactions.My response: I agree for the most part. There could have been less swearing, but as with most Hollywood flicks aimed at young adults these days, it seems to be par for the course. We've been desensitized. Plus, the movie was supposed to be raunchy. Usually raunch and profanity go hand in hand.3. Character Development: The movie focuses too deeply upon Ben and does not develop Alison. We see her on the fringes, a woman living in her sister's backyard apartment, consumed only by her work (we see her interact with friends [or ""Frenemies"" as Carina Chocano calls them in her LA Times review] only once). As the movie unfolds it appears that the best thing to have happened to this woman over the course of her life is her promotion and having this misadventure. Surely this character could and should be more multidimensional.My response:Yes and no. The main character of this movie is Ben, and the plot line focuses on him and his friends. Therefore we largely view the rest of the characters in the film through the lens of his perspective. I agree that there should have been a bit more character development of Alison, but the movie was already getting dangerously long.4. Sex Scenes: They were unnecessary.My response: The movie did not need them. While there were some funny moments, they did not add to the film, and may have alienated a more mature audience even more so than the profanity and juvenile humor (we all were kids at some point and can relate on that level at least). I will again return to the argument that the younger generations (X, Y, Millenials) have been desensitized through television to these matters. I would argue that the sex scenes could have been replaced with more background and development of Alison, or inclusion of the parents to a greater extent.5. Credibility: There were some incongruities in the film that were difficult to ignore, such as Ben being able to miraculously conjure a white-collar web design job and lush apartment on the fly, the lack of involvement on the parents' behalf, especially towards the end, etc.My response: Credibility is only an issue if you allow it to become one. The average film today is somewhere between an hour and a half to two hours long. Any longer and it becomes a struggle to hold the audience's interest. The film was already pushing two hours in length, and to include some subplot about how he landed the job or apartment, or greater involvement from the parents, would have drawn the film into dangerous territory with regards to its length.

1092753,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000TZJBP6,Brian A. Schar,"[22, 52]","I had huge expectations for this movie - always a bad idea going into any movie!  I had really enjoyed the 40 Year Old Virgin, Apatow's previous movie, which was original, very funny, and chock full of interesting characters.  In addition, ""Knocked Up"" was the best-reviewed comedy of the year, garnering all manner of great reviews by actual professionals.But only 30 minutes into this movie, my wife and I were already bored with ""Knocked Up.""  It's bad enough that the premise is simply unbelievable: that when hot women go to the bar, and one has to go home, she would leave the other to hang out with a scruffy, pudgy loser who later has sex with her.  Please.  I can suspend my disbelief about terminators and aliens more easily.  Then, the slow, slow pacing begins, with tiny comedy nuggets scattered few and far between.  I wanted something different, something uproarious, something fun.  Instead, what I got was hoary, cliched gender role comedy with cliched, one-dimensional, unlikeable characters.  ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" for the big screen, if you will.  And as the movie drags on, the comedy actually gets less frequent and less funny!  We actually had to fast forward through parts to make this bearable.The characters are unlikeable, from Rogen and Heigl's characters on down.  Even those two are hard to spend time with; he's a stoner loser with no verbal filter and she's a nascent control freak with serious dependency problems.On the plus side, the performances are great, and there are some truly hysterical bits, sadly few and far between.Perhaps part of the problem is that I saw the unrated movie with extra material.  I don't know how much extra material there is.  If 10-20 minutes of new footage was inserted into the theatrical release length movie, that would explain why this movie drags at such a slow pace.If you think ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" is the most brilliant TV show of the last 20 years, you will love ""Knocked Up"", and you will be happy with it if you buy it blind.  If you hate Raymond, or don't even know who he is, rent this before you waste your money.",1,Disappointing,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,2099,"['had', 'huge', 'expectations', 'movie', 'always', 'bad', 'idea', 'going', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'enjoyed', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Apatow', 'previous', 'movie', 'was', 'original', 'very', 'funny', 'chock', 'full', 'interesting', 'characters', 'addition', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'was', 'best-reviewed', 'comedy', 'year', 'garnering', 'manner', 'great', 'reviews', 'actual', 'professionals.But', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'wife', 'were', 'already', 'bored', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'bad', 'enough', 'premise', 'simply', 'unbelievable', 'when', 'hot', 'women', 'go', 'bar', 'one', 'go', 'home', 'would', 'leave', 'other', 'hang', 'out', 'scruffy', 'pudgy', 'loser', 'who', 'later', 'sex', 'Please', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'terminators', 'aliens', 'more', 'easily', 'Then', 'slow', 'slow', 'pacing', 'begins', 'tiny', 'comedy', 'nuggets', 'scattered', 'few', 'far', 'wanted', 'something', 'different', 'something', 'uproarious', 'something', 'fun', 'Instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'hoary', 'cliched', 'gender', 'role', 'comedy', 'cliched', 'one-dimensional', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'big', 'screen', 'will', 'movie', 'drags', 'comedy', 'actually', 'less', 'frequent', 'less', 'funny', 'actually', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts', 'make', 'bearable.The', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'Rogen', 'Heigl', 'characters', 'down', 'Even', 'two', 'are', 'hard', 'spend', 'time', 'stoner', 'loser', 'verbal', 'filter', 'nascent', 'control', 'freak', 'serious', 'dependency', 'plus', 'side', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'truly', 'hysterical', 'bits', 'sadly', 'few', 'far', 'between.Perhaps', 'part', 'problem', 'saw', 'unrated', 'movie', 'extra', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'extra', 'material', '10-20', 'minutes', 'new', 'footage', 'was', 'inserted', 'theatrical', 'release', 'length', 'movie', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'movie', 'slow', 'pace.If', 'think', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'most', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'show', 'last', '20', 'years', 'will', 'love', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'buy', 'hate', 'Raymond', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'rent', 'waste', 'money']",Knocked Up

Now, that's all fine and dandy but, for me, I'd prefer belly laughs over heart anytime.  Maybe I like my humor a little broader... heck, I preferred the Apatow-co-produced ""Anchorman"" to this title (and ""Anchorman"" was no masterpiece, either).  I just didn't find the big laughs here that I anticipated after reading so many glowing reviews.  Now, I'm not saying this was a bad film, a total washout.  I chuckled and guffawed aloud a couple of times.  But, even the chuckles waned dramatically during the movie's third act (the film is AT LEAST half-an-hour too long).  Let's face it: comedy is in pretty sorry shape these days and when something halfway decent (like this flick) comes out, critics (and a lot of regular folk) wildly over-praise it.  It was ""cute,"" not hilarious.  The pros: a lively, game cast that is perfectly attuned to Apatow's sensibility and Heigl is very easy on the eyes.  The cons: way, way, way too long.  I'd rather have this than an ""Evan Almighty"" or ""A Night at the Museum"" any day but this is nowhere near a comedy classic - don't buy into all the hype.  If you go in expecting a mildly good time, you will probably end up pleasantly satisfied.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[11, 20]","One of the scariest things in the world has to be getting knocked up after a one night stand with a guy you wouldn't look at twice if it weren't for all the alcohol in your system -- but that is exactly the premise for this latest comedy from Judd Apatow, the director who brought us the equally uncomfortable humor inThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition).The dialogue has a biting wit that I think will be much appreciated by adults (considering I definitely don't recommend this movie for younger viewers). Everything and anything is satirical fodder for this film, including sex, drugs, marriage, careers, childbirth (of course), healthcare, raising a family, learning to grow up -- you name it, chances are this movie will poke fun at it. While overall there is a comedic light heartedness to the movie as a whole, it also acknowledges the serious aspects of the situation it's characters find themselves in. An unwed young woman at a crucial point in her career who finds herself pregnant by a marajuana smoking unemployed bum is not a situation some might see as...well...funny -- but this movie manages to make it hilarious!Seth Rogen starrs alongside Katherine Heigl, and both actors do a phenomenal job, each committing to each scene in a way that is almost insane. Heigl actually temporarily lost her voice after filming the birthing scene due to her full out shrieking for hours. While much of the humor errs on the side of lewdness, the biggest shock factor comes at the end during the birth -- so prepare yourself!If there is a flaw to this movie, I think it would be that the actual birth scene at the end felt a little short. They probably could have done a lot more with that pivotal moment, but overall its done very well.Most of the time you have to purchase the 2 disc edition to get any worthwhile special features these days, but this single disc edition actually has a pretty satisfying array of available features -- including deleted scenes, extended/alternate scenes, a gag reel, writer/director/producer commentary, a feature titled Line-O-Rama in which it shows take after take of the actors ad-libbing different lines in various scenes, and many more.Bottom line, if you don't like lewd, crass, and very R rated humor, then this isn't the movie for you.

Thats what the movie ""Knocked Up"" is, a mixture between funny and serious moments. It's basically a movie about an unexpected pregnancy by Ben Stone and Alison Scott (Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl respectively) and what they go through between conception and the actual birth spun out into a whole movie over the 40 week period. Alison is more of the mature female who lives with her sister and her husband and Ben is more of the party type, weed smoking guy who meets her at a bar. The movie has it's funny moments that will make you laugh, a mixture between married couples (although Alison and Ben wern't married) and weed smoking with you buddies humor. It also has it's serious moments where the message is sent about responsibility (seeing that you're pregnant and giving birth soon), and how to take care of yourself and what you have to do when it comes to sacrifices. Even parts where they were supposed to be serious were funny (you'll laugh, trust me). Plus there is some sexual humour there as well. For the longest time, I didn't believe Alison was pregnant (seriously, I thought it was a big joke). Parts of this movie will jump out at you, so be ready.

Alison's mother suggests she have an abortion. But, for reasons that are never made clear, Alison decides not only to have the baby but to contact Ben and ask him to become part of the baby's life. The idea is that these are two young people trying to be responsible and do the right thing. But this is totally inconsistent with their actions, as Ben continues to smoke pot on a daily basis and doesn't even bother to get a job until towards the very end of the movie and Alison seems completely OK with this. Even more absurd is that the movie shows Ben and Alison falling in love and even planning to get married. Yet the two have nothing in common and the idea that an up and coming career gal like Alison would go for a immature, unemployed slacker like Ben, especially while she is on the verge of motherhood, is nuts.I was especially disappointed in this movie because it was written and directed by Judd Apatow. Apatow was the director of the short lived but brillant ""Freaks And Geeks"" TV show. In this great program the joys and fears of adolescence were intelligently and hilariously depicted through the lives of several Michigan high school kids circa 1980. These were the teen-age years as I, and many others, personally experienced them.But both of Apatow's film efforts, ""Knocked Up"" and the only slightly better ""40 Year Old Virgin"", have been typically mediocre Hollwood comedies, needlessly vulgar and without enough laughs.

1092763,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000TZJBP6,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 11]","It's a classic scenario: a boy and a girl have a one-night stand, resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. This is the idea behind ""Knocked Up,"" an occasionally funny but mostly overdone examination of compatibility and inevitable change. I probably would have liked this film more if it had relied on a subtler sense of humor; the jokes and one-liners in this film are aggressively in-your-face, so much so that they overshadow the more serious (and more compelling) aspects of the story. Themes of coming to terms with parenthood and building relationships are definitely there, but they're not as prominent as they should be; it seems as if more time was spent on four-letter words and scenes of drug use. It wouldn't be enough to say that this film is vulgar, and it certainly wouldn't be truthful to say that a few select lines of dialogue weren't funny. Still, I would have preferred a film that was a bit more restrained.In the middle of this less-than-ideal situation are Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), who meet at a club, drink themselves silly, and ultimately sleep together. Their separate lives couldn't be anything less alike, which--dramatically speaking--makes for a more interesting plot. Alison is a hard-working up-and-comer for the E! Network; Ben is a jobless slacker who spends most of his time getting stoned with his roommates. The two meet at a local dance club, where Alison is celebrating her promotion to On-Camera Interviewer and Ben is just being Ben. Their coming together under the influence is realistic, as is the fact that Alison is attracted to an average-looking man (""You're prettier than I am,"" Ben so aptly remarks just before they have sex).What isn't quite so realistic is what follows the one-night stand. Eight weeks later, Alison finally discovers that she's pregnant, much to her shock and dismay. What follows is a nine-month odyssey for she and Ben to get to know each other, an odyssey highlighted by countless arguments and endless discussions of how relationships should work. I tried my hardest to invest in these characters, but something just wasn't clicking with me. I never once believed that these two would realistically be able come to an understanding, even over the smallest of issues; such opposing personalities are too ingrained to allow for any flexibility. But within the context of this story, Ben and Alison are always able to patch things up (if only for a brief time, after which they go through the process all over again). By the time their baby is actually born, all traces of plausibility have been lost.I even found myself criticizing the logistics of their financial situations (I know I'm not supposed to do that, but when it comes to a story involving a pregnancy, certain things just can't be dismissed). First off, Alison is living with her married sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann). This doesn't make sense; working for a major television network would result in an above average salary, meaning there would be no reason to live in someone else's home. If there's anyone who should be living with family for financial reasons, it would be Ben, hands down; not only is he unemployed, he lives with a group of people who don't seem to be working, either. How, pray tell, are they paying for rent, food, and utilities? At one point, Ben explains that a minor accident ten years ago resulted in a $10,000 settlement, and he's been living off of that money ever since. I find this very hard to believe; in today's day and age, that amount of money could never be stretched out so long.But in the scheme of things, I'm just nitpicking. The real problems of this film stem from an overactive sense of humor; ten minutes can't go by without yet another dirty joke being told. To be fair, some of them were quite funny (and since none of them can be repeated publicly, you'll have to take my word for it). But after a while, it begins to get stale and repetitive, like a good scene that turns bad after being forced to watch it over and over. It doesn't help that the film is surprisingly slow-paced, with much of the screen time spent on characters that didn't need to be so well developed. Case in point: Debbie and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), serving as a sign of things to come for Ben and Alison. Debbie is a viper-tongued control freak, never afraid to express her opinions on anything. Pete is a pent up volcano waiting to erupt, a man struggling to find some middle ground in his marriage. Because of frequent late-night outings, Debbie begins to suspect that he's been unfaithful. I won't say whether or not this is the case, but I will say that it doesn't really matter; this is supposed Ben and Allison's story.I sound like I'm absolutely trashing ""Knocked Up,"" but in all honesty, some things about it work well. The most interesting character in the entire film is Sadie (Maude Apatow), Pete and Debbie's young daughter; at one point, she admits that she Googled the word ""murder,"" only to find pictures of dead people lying in pools of blood. That was funny, as was her description of where babies come from--a description most likely influenced by her search of the word ""murder."" I also liked the pop culture references, most of which directly connect to Alison's position at the E! Network. The most memorable reference is a cameo by Ryan Seacrest; he rants like an over-pampered celebrity would, intentionally poking fun at his own Hollywood stature. Granted, such moments are not important to the plot; we're supposed to focus on an unplanned pregnancy. Indeed, we do, but not wholeheartedly. Ultimately, I can only give ""Knocked Up"" credit for trying (pun definitely intended).",3,Expecting Something Better,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,5690,"['classic', 'scenario', 'boy', 'girl', 'have',

He has to deal with her controlling sister and depressed brother-in-law while she has to deal with his four idiot, jobless roommates.Seth Rogen and Katharine Heigl are both good in their roles because they almost make you believe their characters could actually fall in love.

1092774,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000TZJBP6,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","With ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" director-writer Jud Apitow has created a new and exhiliarating genre, profanely scatalogical modern morality comedies.  Here, Ben (Seth Rogen), an immature pot-smoker who operates a pornographic website, has to confront adulthood when he impregnates Allison (Katherine Heigl) an upright (uptight?) attractive TV entertainment personality.  Given the circumstances, it is plausible that these two could have had one night of wild abandon.  Apatow's accomplishment here is to have us believe that Allison would accept this loser as the father of her child and make the best of an unfortunate situation.  Despite Allison's Herculean efforts to rehab Ben she eventually throws in the towel.  By doing that Ben has to now confront the choices he's made in life.  Apatow's premise wouldn't work if the main actors didn't have chemistry or didn't believe in the set-up.  Major kudos have to go out to Rogen and mainly Heigl for making the story believable.  Apatow also offers a paralell story involving Allison's sister and brother-in law played by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who after three kids they find their marriage in a bit of a rut.  Apatow has some prescient observations about marriage that ring very true.  On a final note, probably my favorite scene is one where a very pregnant Allison and her sister are denied admission to a swanky club.  Allison's sister then browbeats the bouncer for the offence.  What's hysterical about this scene is how the bouncer responds in measured tones that leaves the sister's jaw on the floor.",5,Profanely Moral Comedy,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1575,"['40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'director-writer', 'Jud', 'Apitow', 'created', 'new', 'exhiliarating', 'genre', 'profanely', 'scatalogical', 'modern', 'morality', 'comedies', 'Here', 'Ben', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'immature', 'pot-smoker', 'who', 'pornographic', 'website', 'confront', 'adulthood', 'when', 'Allison', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'upright', 'uptight', 'attractive', 'TV', 'entertainment', 'personality', 'Given', 'circumstances', 'plausible', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'night', 'wild', 'abandon', 'Apatow', 'accomplishment', 'here', 'have', 'believe', 'Allison', 'would', 'accept', 'loser', 'father', 'child', 'make', 'best', 'unfortunate', 'situation', 'Allison', 'Herculean', 'efforts', 'rehab', 'Ben', 'eventually', 'towel', 'doing', 'Ben', 'now', 'confront', 'choices', 'made', 'life', 'Apatow', 'premise', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'main', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'set-up', 'Major', 'kudos', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'Rogen', 'mainly', 'Heigl', 'making', 'story', 'believable', 'Apatow', 'also', 'paralell', 'story', 'involving', 'Allison', 'sister', 'brother-in', 'law', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'three', 'kids', 'find', 'marriage', 'bit', 'rut', 'Apatow', 'prescient', 'observations', 'marriage', 'ring', 'very', 'true', 'final', 'note', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'very', 'pregnant', 'Allison', 'sister', 'are', 'denied', 'admission', 'swanky', 'club', 'Allison', 'sister', 'then', 'bouncer', 'offence', 'What', 'hysterical', 'scene', 'how', 'bouncer', 'measured', 'tones', 'sister', 'jaw', 'floor']",Knocked Up

It isn't, but it's still a very enjoyable movie, although perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be. As the title indicates, Knocked Up is about an aspiring young woman, Alison,  who gets pregnant accidentally. This happens during a one-night stand with Ben, a basically decent but doofy and unambitious man who is still living a frat-boy lifestyle with his slacker friends. The movie traces how relationships develop, focusing mainly on Ben and Alison, but also touching on developments in the lives of others, including Alison's sister and her husband.There's an awful lot of crudity throughout the movie, including both rough language and sexually explicit scenes. However, if you look (and listen) past the crudeness, this is basically a sweet and good-hearted movie about growing up, facing life, and doing the right thing.

That's where Knocked Up comes in. Delving fearlessly beneath the duvet of taboo, Judd Apatow's superb comedy follows the relationship between slobby stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and go-getting TV exec Alison (Katharine Heigl) from a drunken one-night-stand to nursery shopping and labour pains.Apatow is best known for his rollicking sex farce The 40 Year Old Virgin, but Knocked Up is pitched at a considerably lower key. While the subject matter is bawdy and the language extremely saucy, most of the laughs (and there are lots of them) spring from conversations rather than gross-out set pieces. Rogen's likeable slacker and his no-hoper pals can discuss the finer points of celebrity nudity until your eyes are watering, while on the other side of the partnership, Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) provide a spot-on portrait of an arid marriage.""YOU'LL BE SNORTING POPCORN OUT OF YOUR NOSE""Like its central character's life, Knocked Up has a messy story, but one imbued with such sweetness that it's impossible not to love. It's a romance with the cutest of twists - imagine if Romeo and Juliet had nine months to fall in love before Julie Jr arrived - told with the laconic charm of a good stand-up routine and laced with moments of genuine insight. It's an adult comedy - not smutty (well OK, it is kinda smutty) but a comedy for and about adults.

1092778,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000TZJBP6,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","- REVIEWI guess it shouldn't surprised me that ""Knocked Up"" is a well-crafted movie that's in league with the best of comedy films.  Judd Apatow has a way with treating its characters with sincerity and unpretentiousness, even when the characters are crass in nature.  It's easier to see that from his involvement with shows such asFreaks and GeeksandUndeclared, right before he take a role into filmmaking and made the funniest film I've seen in a long while,The 40-Year-Old Virgin. With ""Knocked Up"", he found the right balance of laugh-out-loud comedy with awkward yet authentic drama.  It's a marginally more serious film than Apatow's last film, which for all its moments of humorous grandeur, it hits me on how troubling it is for being an expected parent.Like director Christopher Guest before him, Apatow brings most of the cast from his past works to appear in this film, with the likes of Jason Segel as one of Seth Rogen's drunk buddies and Leslie Mann as the sister of Kathernine Heigl's character, along with cameos such as James Franco and Steve ""the virgin"" Carell himself.  However, I must say it's awkward to see Martin Starr's character having a beard and not wearing glasses, yet still has that ""Geek"" voice.  The only new cast member in the film is Katherine Heigl, who plays as a E! News worker who had a one-night stand with Seth Rogen's character, and you know what happens next.  It might be perplexing that a woman like her might have relations with a guy like him, but let's put this into consideration: she got involved with a mental-challenged person in ""The Ringer"", so she's pretty easy.  The ensemble are funny and well-acted in their own way.As said before, this movie is laugh-out-loud funny, even when the trailer didn't make it as a such.  It's vulgar, sure, but almost every scene hits the punchline, like when the Ben (Seth) and his buddies are simulating sex, or when the couple tries different unusual doctors, or the whole ""Las Vegas"" scene; it can be even funny for the ladies with scenes dealin' with Leslie and Katherine. ""Knocked Up"" rarely missed a beat.  I'll be honest, it's not quite as hilarious as ""Virgin"", but this is a type of film that's more down-to-earth.Even as a comedy, when it gets down to the relationship between Ben and Alison (Katherine), it's a serious affair.  Sure, it's funny when both tried to get along , getting baby supplies and being sexually intimate, but for some scenes they can be uncomfortable to watch, and I say it as a good thing.  They felt that because of their unborn child, they are suppose to connect, but it turns out to be very difficult.  They go through the patterns of ups and downs, but the down moments made their relationship almost in peril.  With Ben, he doesn't know what he doing, and most times he ends up saying and doing the wrong things.  What's great about these up-and-down moments is that I can see the characters grow overtime, learning to take responsibilities and seeing most of the sub-characters grow to support the couple as well.  What's makes it even better is that development done in a non-chessy and unorthodox way.At two hours and 13 minutes, it's one of the longest comedies ever made, but fortunately ""Knocked Up"" has such a good pace in providing both genres, so it doesn't feel long.  Seth Rogen started off as a forgettable cast member in the past, but here (and with the help of his mentor, Apatow) he knows how to play his role and ends up being a remarkable and likable person.  Judd Apatow made the relationship between two unlikely people work, and for that and everything this movie provides, ""Knocked Up"" is hilarious yet very sweet.  Heck, it certainly made my dad (who saw this movie with me) remember the times he had when my mom's about to have her first child; it was just as crazy as this movie portrays, making this film relatable to anyone in that position.This is Del Keyes, giving his thumbs up to Judd.",5,Judd Apatow takes on accidental pregnancy with spades,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3942,"['REVIEWI', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'well-crafted', 'movie', 'league', 'best', 'comedy', 'films', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'way', 'treating', 'characters', 'sincerity', 'unpretentiousness', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'crass', 'nature', 'easier', 'see', 'involvement', 'shows', 'such', 'asFreaks', 'GeeksandUndeclared', 'right', 'take', 'role', 'filmmaking', 'made', 'funniest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'while', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'found', 'right', 'balance', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'awkward', 'yet', 'authentic', 'drama', 'marginally', 'more', 'serious', 'film', 'Apatow', 'last', 'film', 'moments', 'humorous', 'grandeur', 'how', 'troubling', 'being', 'expected', 'parent.Like', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Apatow', 'most', 'cast', 'past', 'works', 'appear', 'film', 'likes', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'one', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'drunk', 'buddies', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'sister', 'Kathernine', 'Heigl', 'character', 'cameos', 'such', 'James', 'Franco', 'Steve', 'virgin', 'Carell', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'awkward', 'see', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'character', 'having', 'beard', 'not', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'yet', 'still', 'Geek', 'voice', 'only', 'new', 'cast', 'member', 'film', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'who', 'E', 'News', 'worker', 'who', 'had', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'character', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'might', 'be', 'perplexing', 'woman', 'might', 'have', 'relations', 'guy', 'let', 'put', 'consideration', 'got', 'involved', 'mental-challenged', 'person', 'Ringer', 'pretty', 'easy', 'ensemble', 'are', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'own', 'way.As', 'said', 'movie', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'even', 'when', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'such', 'vulgar', 'sure', 'almost', 'scene', 'punchline', 'when', 'Ben', 'Seth', 'buddies', 'are', 'simulating', 'sex', 'when', 'couple', 'different', 'unusual', 'doctors', 'whole', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'funny', 'ladies', 'scenes', 'dealin', 'Leslie', 'Katherine', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'rarely', 'missed', 'beat', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'hilarious', 'Virgin', 'type', 'film', 'more', 'down-to-earth.Even', 'comedy', 'when', 'down', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Alison', 'Katherine', 'serious', 'affair', 'Sure', 'funny', 'when', 'tried', 'get', 'along', 'getting', 'baby', 'supplies', 'being', 'sexually', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'felt', 'unborn', 'child', 'are', 'suppose', 'connect', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'go', 'patterns', 'ups', 'downs', 'down', 'moments', 'made', 'relationship', 'almost', 'peril', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'most', 'times', 'up', 'saying', 'doing', 'wrong', 'things', 'What', 'great', 'up-and-down', 'moments', 'can', 'see', 'characters', 'grow', 'overtime', 'learning', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'seeing', 'most', 'sub-characters', 'grow', 'support', 'couple', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'development', 'done', 'non-chessy', 'unorthodox', 'way.At', 'two', 'hours', '13', 'minutes', 'one', 'longest', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'fortunately', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'good', 'pace', 'providing', 'genres', ""n't"", 'feel', 'long', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'started', 'off', 'forgettable', 'cast', 'member', 'past', 'here', 'help', 'mentor', 'Apatow', 'how', 'play', 'role', 'up', 'being', 'remarkable', 'likable', 'person', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'made', 'relationship', 'two', 'unlikely', 'people', 'work', 'everything', 'movie', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'very', 'sweet', 'Heck', 'certainly', 'made', 'dad', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'remember', 'times', 'had', 'when', 'mom', 'have', 'first', 'child', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'crazy', 'movie', 'making', 'film', 'relatable', 'anyone', 'position.This', 'Del', 'Keyes', 'giving', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Judd']",Knocked Up

1092782,A6AGN1U1BDB0V,B000TZJBP6,"Diego F. Mera ""Diego""","[8, 16]","Man and I thought Bloodrayne was the worst movie ever!  That one is an Oscar contender compared to this one.... well, maybe not, that one sucked too.I have decided to expound on my review based on a comment I received about it.  I said the movie sucked, and now I will explain why.I tried to listen to the director's commentary before watching the film and I could not get through 20 minutes of it.  About 3 minutes into the commentary the lead actor (Seth Rogen) makes a totally disgusting pedophile joke, guess what folks, that guy wasn't acting, he really is that stupid.  After the 20 minutes of torture (listening to a bunch of silly men giggling and guffawing half the time) I decided to watch the movie because of the rave reviews it had received.  To my dismay I then find that the movie itself has a pedophile joke.  These two reasons alone were enough for me to regret ever renting the movie.The foul language was very distracting and the directors basically had the actors improvise the entire movie - which explains a whole lot.  Few people were actually acting.  The director himself said in the commentary that most of the script was improvised.  A movie that had such great potential is nothing more than these people being themselves, which makes me glad that they live on the other side of the country from me.Katherine Heigl's character was so oblivious to Ben's glaring flaws that it is no wonder some women make such dumb choices in men.  Let's look at one particular scene, where she tells Ben that she is pregnant.  So they are sitting in a restaurant and Ben's character begins to talk very loudly without any regard to the obscenities that he was uttering in a restaurant filled with people that just ignored him.  No one even glanced his way or said a thing.  She herself just ignored that behavior as they did.  He then goes on to explain what he does for a living and she just brushes that off?  Did she find his job ""amusing"" or ""cute""?  Sure it made it seem as if she was uncomfortable by it, but did that stop her from talking to him afterward?  No.It can be argued that she did find it amusing and cute, as some women do.  Maybe his obscenities are something that she herself uses all of the time and is therefore not bothered by it.  I mean there are women that are swingers and such sexual talk probably wouldn't bother them, but does that make any of that funny?  As I mentioned in my reply to a comment, do you always laugh at laugh cues when you watch a sitcom?  Laugh cues are inserted each and every single time that a ""joke"" is uttered.  Does the laugh make it funny, is the joke funny?  Not necessarily.  Obscenities and lewd behavior can be funny, when done with intelligence.  What intelligence was there in this movie?If you find this junk funny then there should be no wonder why the divorce rate is what it is.  Or that America is becoming more and ruder as time goes by.Seriously, if you are looking for some kind of romantic comedy that actually makes you believe in the characters and that they are decent people, and then this movie is not for you.  Some of you want to find a really good comedy that you can sit with your wife or girlfriend and enjoy.  Something that is uplifting without having to be embarrassed at every turn because you chose something that had rave reviews and it must therefore be a good movie.  Thus I am so grateful for websites and Amazon and enabling us to write our reviews and warn others to keep away from putrid garbage like this.

She has a few too many to drink, meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), and has a one-night stand with him.A few weeks later, she discovers she's pregnant. After some soul-searching and a lot of cringing, she decides she'd better tell Ben. He vows to stick with her and help raise the baby.Ben lives with his buddies, smokes pot, and they have desultory plans to create a celebrity website, but they don't work on it much. At first, he keeps on with his life the way it is, but little by little, he starts growing up and taking responsibility.There's a secondary plot with Allison's sister and her husband having a crisis in their marriage that serves to both encourage and warn Allison and Ben about their future.It was a cute movie, as far as it went. I'm not sure I understand the rave reviews: 7.8 stars on the IMDB for a comedy is amazing. That's the same as The Blues Brothers and Blazing Saddles and Stranger than Fiction got, and this is nowhere in the same league as those. Different tastes, maybe, but those had more going on than just humorous situations. Maybe this one did, too, and I just didn't see it.My favorite part of the movie was Ben's growth, and, to a lesser extent, Allison's. It was presented with humor and sympathy. The problems between Allison's sister and brother-in-law were realistic, but I couldn't sympathize with either of them, which made it less effective for me.The premise, however, just didn't sit well with me. Because of a one-night stand, this couple is deciding on a permanent commitment to each other. It just made me squirm, and nearly turned the movie into a pro-life propaganda piece. Allison does initially turn down Ben's marriage proposal, but neither of them ever question whether they should be together permanently or not--just whether they should have the little piece of paper.Much of that has, I admit, more to do with me than with the movie. I've been married 23+ years, and I know how much work marriage is, even when you love each other. Then, too, I have a 22-year-old daughter who's far too prone to trying to make relationships work even when she'd be better off letting go, and I couldn't help seeing her in the same situation.Ah, well.

I had no qualms watching KNOCKED UP in my underwear; heck, most of the cast is in their underwear (or less) throughout the duration of the film.  How laid back, you ask?  Well, consider this:  We are introduced to five maturity-challenged males, all living together (now that's a lot of socks on the floor).  Their goal, when they're not drunk or high, is to launch a celebrity skin website.  Talk about high aspirations.  But all is derailed when one of them, Ben (a disheveled Seth Rogen), gets lucky enough to score a one nightstand with Alison (Katherine Heigl), who is one hot babe; yet the result is an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, throwing Ben and Alison together in a fragile relationship one can only call. . .tumultuous.Rogen and Heigl are solid, and are backed by ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" vets Leslie Mann and Paul Ruud (who, as always, is hilarious); yet the scene stealers, time and time again, are Ben's grungy roommates (Jay, Jonah, Jason, and Martin).  When these guys get together to ad lib a scene, mayhem reigns supreme.  Alas, all the improvisation is also the movie's downside, as it tends to bog down the story and make it uncomfortably rough around the edges.  There's a sweet spot (Ben and Alison's budding love, and of course, a little baby) at the heart of this story; all the bloviating and spontaneous ranting makes it hard to reach it.As this is the unrated two-disc collector's edition, we have extra features out the wazzoo:  Extended scenes, deleted scenes, video diaries--and way, way, too much of writer-producer Judd Apatow.  A must-see is a deleted scene featuring Jonah Hill going off on a rant over the film ""Brokeback Mountain""; another is an extended scene of the diminutive, yet feisty, Dr. Kuni (a real-life doc, by the way) taking charge of Alison's delivery.

1092789,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000TZJBP6,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","This two-disc Collector's Edition DVD set contains an ""Extended and Unrated"" version of the 2007 comedy, but it amounts to only four additional minutes of footage focused primary on the principal characters' morning-after recollections of their drunken encounter. But fear not as the rest of the extras justify the purchase of this complete set. Director/writer Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) obviously had an eye toward the DVD release in making his film since several of the featurettes are made up of footage made during the actual filming that could have not have ended up anywhere else. The result is a treasure trove of material for die-hard fans of the movie.Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963'sLove With the Proper Stranger, about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane film. As Apatow showed withThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plotline to the point where each makes the other more resonant.Familiar faces fromThe 40-Year-Old Virginreturn in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likeability on Grey's Anatomy to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in Virgin, is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe.Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig deserves special mention for her hilarious turn as Alison's not-so-covertly jealous co-worker. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with Virgin. A running time of now 133 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant is the deliberate reference to Virgin in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.The DVD extras are abundant to say the least. First, there is the funny frat-buddy camaraderie on the commentary track with Apatow, Rogen and Bill Hader, aSaturday Night Livecomic who plays Alison's film-editing colleague at E! Unsurprisingly, there are lots of deleted and extended scenes on both discs, which really shows how Apatow encouraged his actors to use improv to hit the right emotional notes in their characters. More of this riffing can be found in the ""Line-O-Ramas"" contained on both discs - quick edits showing the actors making up alternate versions of their lines - as well as the ""Raw Footage"" of two key scenes on Disc Two, in which Heigl and Rogen keep going until they hit their key moments regardless of the script.Disc One has a very funny short called ""Directing the Director"", which has filmmaker Bennett Miller (Capote) following Apatow around just in case Universal decides to drop him over perceived creative control issues. Disc Two has two highlights - Apatow's video diary, a surprisingly revelatory half-hour featurette that picks him up at various points during the 56-day shoot, and the adroitly amusing ""Finding Ben Stone"", a faux-documentary which would have us believe that Apatow went through a number of actors to play the main character before settling on Rogen. Familiar faces like Orlando Bloom, James Franco, Justin Long and David Krumholtz (Numb3rs), among several, have fun with their images playing ego-driven Hollywood types providing constant frustration for Apatow. Krumholtz also shows up in another short, ""Gummy: the 6th Roommate"", playing a character that Apatow wants us to think was dropped from the final cut for lack of chemistry with the other roommates.There are several smaller shorts focusing on random elements like Apatow and Mann's children (cast in the film as Mann and Rudd's kids), the strippers in the Vegas casino club, the opening rollercoaster scene at Magic Mountain, roommate Martin's growing beard, the first sex scenes for Rogen and Jonah Hill, and silliest of all, alternate versions of existing scenes with Rogen playing them topless.

Then seeing that it was one of the best reviewed films ever on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to see why many of the nation's critics were proclaiming this film to be a major masterpiece, on line with some of the greatest comedies ever committed to celluloid.  Normally, when a film has a 90 percent approval on Rotten Tomatoes, I am suspicious.  The vulgarity of the film doesn't bother me.  The childishness of most of the main characters doesn't bother me.  What deeply offends me is the preposterousness of the main story.  These 2 characters would never get together in real life, only in a contrived, forced feel good movie such as this.  This is another variation on stoner slob ""regular"" guy meets impossibly beautiful woman, and they get it on.  Hollywood is probably to blame for bad relationships across the board in this country because of films like this.  In reality, if a woman got pregnant by a guy like this, she would either have the baby on her own, or more likely, procure an abortion.  It feels like that cliche that the ""couple should stay together for the kids"", which in the long run hurts the children.  In reality, the woman would have woken up the next morning, realised she made a mistake, and would have taken care of it.The film does have some funny moments.  I especially like Ryan Seacrest, who is actually the funniest thing in the film.  There's a scene where Seth tokes on a bong with a gas mask on, which I found to be cool.  And some of Seth's friends repartee is amusing, though not incredible sweet, touching, and hilarious as the critics are trying to make us believe.  It boggles the mind that the critics would make this film sound like a masterpiece.  Maybe Judd Apatow is a really cool guy and treats critics well.  Or maybe our standards are pretty abysmal right now, so a mediocre film like this gets raised to the level of Duck Soup and Lawrence of Arabia.Overall, there's a few funny bits here and there, but the main story is so preposterous it's insulting.

1092807,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000TZJBP6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I just became a Seth Rogen fan. Just right now, I did. I've been peripherally aware of this guy, having seen him in miniscule parts in ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY, YOU, ME & DUPREE, and, most notably, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN. But, here in KNOCKED UP, he takes lead actor honors and he's wonderful. See this movie for the other actors, as well - Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann all shine - but, in my eyes, this is a cinematic coming out party for Seth Rogen. And, if nothing else, this chubby guy gives hope to uncool, unhandsome, plain folks like me. So, yay.This is the story of Ben and Alison. Ben (Seth Rogen) is a laid-back and unemployed teddy bear of a guy who whiles away his time smoking weed and, with his slacker buddies, striving to construct a celebrity skin website (that these guys are unaware of the Mr. Skin site, already in place, seems far fetched). In a club, he bumps into out-of-his-league Alison (Katherine Heigl), a gorgeous career girl celebrating a promotion. Booze is poured, a spark is ignited, and Alison and Ben hook up. As sometimes happen, the next morning opens with hangovers and regrets and a butt-crack. Alison gets a good, sober look at Ben, who then doesn't help his case by throwing up and then championing the merits of post-drunk vomiting. Disgusted, Alison departs; Ben knows he goofed and assumes that that was that. But, 8 weeks later, Ben hears from Alison, who drops the news that she's expecting. And, because Ben is innately a good guy and Alison a fairly open-minded girl who doesn't want to do this alone, they make a go of being together.This flick is a cheerful, very funny 2-hours-plus worth of sit down time and definitely offers more than its ANIMAL HOUSE tendencies would have you initially believe. My gut feeling is that the folks involved in the making of this film had true affection for it, especially Director/Writer Judd Apatow. KNOCKED UP lays down consistent humor foraying into occasional bawdiness. The film did startle me with its display of genuine emotion and heart. I was prepared to be content with cardboard people and cheap laughs. Instead, underneath the bawdy trimmings, the unaffected, heartfelt core of the film surfaced and made me invest in the characters beyond a superficial level. I really liked the characters. Too, the rampant crudity and lewdness of the film are balanced by a humorous yet sensitive depiction of a marriage quietly on the rocks, which, with all the insights given, actually feels like a real marriage.Alison's older sister Debbie and Pete have been married for a while now and are raising two beautiful daughters. But life isn't like the movies, and Debbie and Pete, well-meaning people both, have problems. Debbie as played with delirious, high-strung brittleness by Leslie Mann is one of those pushy, righteous people who eventually gets under your skin, but she's not a bad person. Paul Rudd is comic gold as Pete, the fount of masterfully sly and dry comments, who can mostly tolerate Debbie's harangues but only if he gets the occasional alone time. Their not-quite-rosy relationship is plentifully plumbed, giving rise to spousal suspicions and bickerings and possibly previewing what the future holds for Alison and Ben. Too, Alison and Ben end up choosing sides as Alison is strictly with her sister while Ben espouses Pete's side. This puts a decided crimp in their own relationship.Of course, this movie hinges on the leads' ability to generate interest and invoke sympathy from the viewer. And, let's face it, who wouldn't want Ben Stone for a buddy? Or Seth Rogen, for that matter? Ben is so good natured and easy going that I challenge anyone to not root for him and his maturation process. One of my favorite scenes is when he finally confronts Debbie. His chemistry with Heigl is apparent on screen; I can actually see this smoking hot girl being pals with and then falling for the prospectless, chubby but appealing loser, although, naturally, beer and possibly many shots of tequilla would have to be involved. Katherine Heigl had already turned my head with her performances in ROSWELL and THE RINGER. Here, much respect goes to Katherine as she shrugs off dignity and dives right into the thick of things. But, you know what, even when ignominiously suffering thru morning sickness, throwing hormonal hissy fits, or giving alarmingly painful birth, she maintains her full babefulness. As Alison,she comes across as an authentic person with an array of valid fears and insecurities. Katherine Heigl's good. And smoking hot.The supporting players sparkle. Credit as a whole goes to Ben's insult-tossing cast of nowhere-headed pals, who may be hapless but are there for Ben. Two standouts are Ken Jeong as the strict and precise Asian doctor and SNL-er Kristen Wiig as some sort of network executive, she of the snide and off-the-wall verbal asides (""This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.""). Because Alison works for the E! network, we're treated to several cameos of famous folks playing themselves. Ryan Seacrest's lampooning of himself is a blast and it makes me like him a bit better.I like to laugh and KNOCKED UP doled out laughter in multiple servings. Much of the humor is of the juvenile sort as a sizable chunk of the film is dedicated to the slacker amigos mercilessly bagging on each other. Your enjoyment of these jokes will depend on your pop-culture I.Q. (for example, do you know who Serpico is?). One guy who undertakes a shaving bet is incessantly strafed with facial hair insults (""Scorcese on coke"" ""Your face is like Robin William's knuckles.""). Be advised that there are moments here of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY or AMERICAN PIE proportions. But, in the midst of the pot humor, the DeNiro impressions, and the scatalogical stuff, there's an unfeigned sweetness and moments of honest soul searching which resonate clearly, and, gullible goofball that I am, I was charmed. Don't be fooled by the raunchy and ""modern"" conventions here; this film is firmly centered on family values. Ben Stone might be an adult at 23 years old, but this is still a coming of age story.In his first lead role, Seth Rogen emerges as the genial, scruffy heart of the film. Now that he has it, here's hoping he can sustain his leading man status. If the ungainly Jack Black can do it, why not Seth, who's more lovable and cuddly? But there are other actors in the film. Heigl, Rudd, and Mann do great being witty and poignant, argumentative and loving, and real. KNOCKED UP allows both genders to have their moments. In terms of who's funny, Rogen and Rudd definitely come through, but Heigl and especially Mann deliver their ample share of levity. Just wait for the scene with the stressed Debbie having a brutal yet uproarious conversation with the nightclub doorman. The movie also has that something which lesser films would kill for, which is chemistry among its stars. Chemistry abounds, between Rogen and Heigl, between Mann and Rudd, between Rogen and Rudd. So, yeah, there's all kinds of reasons to go see KNOCKED UP. The guys have the dirty, smutty humor and the smoking hot babes; for the girls, there's the pregnancy arc, a nice, unforced romance, as well as the sibling relationship of Alison and Debbie. Oh, and, apparently, Paul Rudd is a clever hunk and Seth Rogen is immensely huggable. But, me, I saw this to learn the dice move.",5,"KNOCKED UP is filthy minded and infantile, yet is sustained by an honest emotional core; Ben Stone is my kind of peeps",1180742400,"06 2,

1092808,A14Q6R4481YFFG,B000TZJBP6,Hinkle Goldfarb,"[0, 3]","This is the story of a very irresponsible young man and a slightly less irresponsible young lady who cast their inhibitions and common sense to the wind one night, then discover...well, you can guess.  For those looking for a comedy, there's lots of laughs, including some humor that's over the top (at least in the unrated version).  It's also a great ""coming of age"" movie for post-adolescents, a sort of bildungsroman for adults.  Because of its adult themes and constant demonstration of drug use, it's not a movie to take the kids to see, but if you're in your twenties or thirties, it's perfect.One part of the movie puzzled me at first: the scenes where Alison Scott decides to keep the baby instead of having an abortion.  Looked at one way, it's totally logical for an irreligious person as Ms Scott appears to be to have an abortion rather than risk her career and her chance at having a family more of her choosing.  The first time I saw the movie, I thought it wasn't being honest on this point.  When I saw it the second time, however, I came to a different conclusion.  Judd Apatow (the writer) went as far as he could in a mainstream movie to say that abortion for convenience is wrong.  What captured this sentiment was Ms Scott's conversation with her mother, where her mom, a product of the Sixties no doubt, blithely states that an acquaintance, after having an abortion, later got married ""and now she has a real baby.""In short: it's an entertaining, light-hearted and sometimes thought-provoking movie.",5,A crash course in coming of age,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1523,"['story', 'very', 'irresponsible', 'young', 'man', 'slightly', 'less', 'irresponsible', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'cast', 'inhibitions', 'common', 'sense', 'wind', 'one', 'night', 'then', 'discover', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'looking', 'comedy', 'lots', 'laughs', 'including', 'humor', 'top', 'least', 'unrated', 'version', 'also', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'post-adolescents', 'sort', 'bildungsroman', 'adults', 'adult', 'themes', 'constant', 'demonstration', 'drug', 'use', 'not', 'movie', 'take', 'kids', 'see', ""'re"", 'twenties', 'thirties', 'perfect.One', 'part', 'movie', 'puzzled', 'first', 'scenes', 'where', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'keep', 'baby', 'instead', 'having', 'abortion', 'Looked', 'one', 'way', 'totally', 'logical', 'irreligious', 'person', 'Ms', 'Scott', 'be', 'have', 'abortion', 'rather', 'risk', 'career', 'chance', 'having', 'family', 'more', 'choosing', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'honest', 'point', 'When', 'saw', 'second', 'time', 'however', 'came', 'different', 'conclusion', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'writer', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'say', 'abortion', 'convenience', 'wrong', 'What', 'captured', 'sentiment', 'was', 'Ms', 'Scott', 'conversation', 'mother', 'where', 'mom', 'product', 'Sixties', 'doubt', 'blithely', 'acquaintance', 'having', 'abortion', 'later', 'got', 'married', 'now', 'real', 'baby', 'short', 'entertaining', 'light-hearted', 'sometimes', 'thought-provoking', 'movie']",Knocked Up

All us guys talk ""locker room"" when by ourselves...but crude references to oral (and other kinds) of sex in front of women?  If this is really the way younger people talk nowadays, our society is headed for extinction.  I watched this movie strictly because of Katherine Heigl whom I think is adorable and whose looks remind me of the pretty girls from the 50's and 60's.  It was disappointing to hear her use such vulgarity.  I know she's a professional actress and it's her job to read the script.  Hopefully she will get much better films than this to work in as she's very appealing on screen and a decent actress.  The story itself is good, but hardly believeable.

They couldn't shut up about it supposedly being ""laugh filled"" and ""funny as hell."" The normally sensible NEW YORK POST critic, Kyle Smith, claimed that it was ""an era-defining comedy classic."" Ross Douthat of NATIONAL REVIEW went so far as to claim that the film was a ""sort of social conservatism,"" despite all the drug use and the out-of-wedlock birth.It's not a terrible film but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. The high expectations created by the critics' adoration are one reason this reviewer (and I'm sure many others) are down on this flick.An up-and-coming TV personality with brains and very attractive Nordic looks (Alison) gets pregnant after what was supposed to be a one-night stand with a fat, unemployed, drug-addled, ex-pat Canuck (Ben) who is living off of some kind of disability award from the government of British Columbia. (Ben's immigration status is unclear. He certainly didn't come in on an employment visa!) Alison decides to keep the baby after seeing the unborn child's heart beating on a sonogram. The rest of the film is about this extremely odd couple trying to make their relationship work.While I watched this flick, I couldn't help but think that the right girl for this guy would be someone like Roseanne Barr.The viewers reaction to one scene in particular is a good barometer of whether or not you'll like this film: Ben goes to Vegas with Pete, the husband of Alison's sister, and they watch Cirque de Soleil while high on ""magic mushrooms."" It wasn't funny to me, but if that sounds funny to you then my guess is you'll like this film.The scene that this reviewer found the most amusing was when all the evidence suggests that Pete is having an affair, and Ben, Alison and her sister follow him to the suspected love nest, a suburban bungalow. They burst in expecting to find him in the sack with his paramour. Instead, they find him with a group of guys playing fantasy/simulation baseball. That was funny, although not all that original: There was a similar scene in the 1942 film ""Pride of the Yankees"" with Gary Cooper.",2,The right girl for this guy would be Roseanne Barr....,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,2165,"['movie', 'got', 'outstanding', 'reviews', 'virtually', 'professional', 'movie', 'critics', 'could', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'supposedly', 'being', 'laugh', 'filled', 'funny', 'hell', 'normally', 'sensible', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'POST', 'critic', 'Kyle', 'Smith', 'claimed', 'was', 'era-defining', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Ross', 'Douthat', 'NATIONAL', 'REVIEW', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'claim', 'film', 'was', 'sort', 'social', 'conservatism', 'drug', 'use', 'out-of-wedlock', 'birth.It', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'high', 'expectations', 'created', 'critics', 'adoration', 'are', 'one', 'reason', 'reviewer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'down', 'flick.An', 'up-and-coming', 'TV', 'personality', 'brains', 'very', 'attractive', 'Nordic', 'Alison', 'pregnant', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'one-night', 'stand', 'fat', 'unemployed', 'drug-addled', 'ex-pat', 'Canuck', 'Ben', 'who', 'living', 'kind', 'disability', 'award', 'government', 'British', 'Columbia', 'Ben', 'immigration', 'status', 'unclear', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'employment', 'visa', 'Alison', 'keep', 'baby', 'seeing', 'unborn', 'child', 'heart', 'beating', 'sonogram', 'rest', 'film', 'extremely', 'odd', 'couple', 'trying', 'make', 'relationship', 'watched', 'flick', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'right', 'girl', 'guy', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'Roseanne', 'Barr.The', 'viewers', 'reaction', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'good', 'barometer', 'not', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'Ben', 'Vegas', 'Pete', 'husband', 'Alison', 'sister', 'watch', 'Cirque', 'de', 'Soleil', 'high', 'magic', 'mushrooms', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'funny', 'then', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film.The', 'scene', 'reviewer', 'found', 'most', 'amusing', 'was', 'when', 'evidence', 'Pete', 'having', 'affair', 'Ben', 'Alison', 'sister', 'follow', 'suspected', 'love', 'nest', 'suburban', 'bungalow', 'burst', 'expecting', 'find', 'sack', 'paramour', 'Instead', 'find', 'group', 'guys', 'playing', 'fantasy/simulation', 'baseball', 'was', 'funny', 'not', 'original', 'was', 'similar', 'scene', '1942', 'film', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'Gary', 'Cooper']",Knocked Up

In line with the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Old School"", the crass, juvenile humor of this movie does not disappoint.Ben is a low-life, goofy looking slacker, whose goal in life is to start a porn website with his four roommate friends.  Alison, on the other hand, is a rising personality on E!, and she has just been given her big break, a promotion to on-air personality.  Because Alison wants to celebrate, and Ben has very little else to do, they both happen upon the same club...and worlds collide.After the drinks, funny comments, and beer goggles set in for Alison, the hook up becomes inevitable.  They both end up at Alison's place where Ben misinterprets Alison's wishes and ignores the use of protection.  Hello unplanned pregnancy!The rest devolves into half-comedy, half-romance film in which there is just raunchy slapstick for the guys, and just enough hand-holding for the women.  It's a win-win sitution for all.  Mutual support and responsibility takes hold, and each person does what they need to do in order to take care of the baby.Despite the humor, and overall good times provided by the movie, the one unbelieveable part of the movie itself is the eventual affection shown between the two once they realize they are going to soon become parents.  Just like television shows like ""King of Queens"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ""Yes Dear"", and ""Still Standing"", the one-night stand is believeable, but the relationship afterwards is far-fetched.Bonus points go to the cast which includes Paul Rudd.  It's easier to get into a movie and get ready for laughs when you know the same consistent crew from previous good movies will be delivering the same performances.

The plot is decent, although way too long.  Katherine Heigl is engaging and adorable, and I have to say pretty shocking in some of the seedier scenes.  Meg Ryan (a la Sally) has got nothing on Katherine!The Bad: The male cast. The mere notion that even with the thickest beer goggles Katherine Heigl would wind up in bed with Seth Rogen is just absurd.  There are also some plot mistakes.  For instance, both Allison (Heigl) and Ben (Rogen) say in one breath that they don't remember anything from the fateful night, yet a moment later they both remember the condom moment perfectly.  The movie is also riddled with drug use, as well as the f-bomb that seems to purvey all of Apatow's/Rogen's movies.  This is essentially another gutter movie (like Superbad), brought up to perhaps the curb by Heigl.  Despite some ultimately decent intentions, it just falls short.The Summary: Allison goes clubbing with her married sister Debbie, where she meets Ben.  He buys them beers and after Debbie winds up leaving, Allison and Ben wind up dancing and getting very drunk.  One thing leads to another and, well, Allison is pregnant.  She is obviously repulsed at the mere thought that she slept with Ben, and now she is pregnant with his child.

Actually, it is a very sweet (if horrifically and often comically vulgar) film that among other things explores the vastly divergent perspectives of men and women on marriage, sexuality and kids.The film's premise is simple enough. Up-and-coming TV personality Alison Scott gets pregnant after an unprotected encounter with frumpy barely-employed Ben Stone. Scott immediately switches into lost-career mom mode. She worries about whether to keep the baby, how and whether to involve Stone and whether to tell her image-stupid network about her figure-altering new reality. Meanwhile, she tries to sound out Stone as a potential caregiver. Though very smart, compassionate and honorable, he is basically a doofus -- an immature stoner in a dead-end, though high-tech job who has no clue that his vapid crudities are offending the sensibilities of his putative partner.The acting in ""Knocked up,"" especially the notable job done by leads Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, is believable and sweet. The writing is smart and very funny. And the characters are terrific. Scott's sister is struggling in her marriage, giving the film a chance to explore the hidden stresses in couples trying to be good parents and spouses wghile retaining some sense of youth and independence. Stone's band of porn-addled, weed-smoking bon vivants is a hilariously well-drawn portrait of the moral and cultural stupor that envelops at least some young males. When an earthquake hits and Stone saves his bong rather than his pregnant girlfriend, you have almost everything you need to know about how far this young man has to travel. Seeing Stone make that hard choice tells you that there is a good chance he'll make the trip.I saw ""Knocked Up"" with a group of 150 just-graduated high school seniors. In spite of the constant profanity, the several sex scenes and the endless pot smoking, this film had a lot to say about the need to grow up and smell the talcum powder. Though not meant as a sex ed film, the movie made clear what happens when a baby is coming into the world. Babies mean imperfect relationships, hard choices, making a living, letting go of stupid habits and dealing with ""crowning"" and other gynecological concepts not appealing to most men. To have that message delivered -- even with a whopping dose of bad behavior -- is not a bad thing at all.",4,The funniest (and most effective) birth control movie ever made,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,2449,"['title', 'alone', 'might', 'expect', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'take', 'cavalier', 'approach', 'pregnancy', 'children', 'Actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'horrifically', 'often', 'comically', 'vulgar', 'film', 'other', 'things', 'vastly', 'divergent', 'perspectives', 'men', 'women', 'marriage', 'sexuality', 'kids.The', 'film', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'Up-and-coming', 'TV', 'personality', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'pregnant', 'unprotected', 'encounter', 'frumpy', 'barely-employed', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Scott', 'immediately', 'lost-career', 'mom', 'mode', 'keep', 'baby', 'how', 'involve', 'Stone', 'tell', 'image-stupid', 'network', 'figure-altering', 'new', 'reality', 'Meanwhile', 'sound', 'out', 'Stone', 'potential', 'caregiver', 'very', 'smart', 'compassionate', 'honorable', 'basically', 'doofus', 'immature', 'stoner', 'dead-end', 'high-tech', 'job', 'who', 'clue', 'vapid', 'crudities', 'are', 'offending', 'sensibilities', 'putative', 'partner.The', 'acting', 'Knocked', 'up', 'especially', 'notable', 'job', 'done', 'leads', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'believable', 'sweet', 'writing', 'smart', 'very', 'funny', 'characters', 'are', 'terrific', 'Scott', 'sister', 'struggling', 'marriage', 'giving', 'film', 'chance', 'explore', 'hidden', 'stresses', 'couples', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'parents', 'spouses', 'wghile', 'retaining', 'sense', 'youth', 'independence', 'Stone', 'band', 'porn-addled', 'weed-smoking', 'bon', 'vivants', 'hilariously', 'well-drawn', 'portrait', 'moral', 'cultural', 'stupor', 'least', 'young', 'males', 'When', 'earthquake', 'hits', 'Stone', 'bong', 'rather', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'almost', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'young', 'man', 'travel', 'Seeing', 'Stone', 'make', 'hard', 'choice', 'tells', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'make', 'trip.I', 'saw', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'group', '150', 'just-graduated', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'spite', 'constant', 'profanity', 'several', 'sex', 'scenes', 'endless', 'pot', 'smoking', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'need', 'grow', 'up', 'smell', 'talcum', 'powder', 'not', 'meant', 'sex', 'ed', 'film', 'movie', 'made', 'clear', 'what', 'when', 'baby', 'coming', 'world', 'Babies', 'mean', 'imperfect', 'relationships', 'hard', 'choices', 'making', 'living', 'letting', 'go', 'stupid', 'habits', 'dealing', 'crowning', 'other', 'gynecological', 'concepts', 'not', 'appealing', 'most', 'men', 'have', 'message', 'delivered', 'even', 'whopping', 'dose', 'bad', 'behavior', 'not', 'bad', 'thing']",Knocked Up

In only a few moments Ben Stone is transformed from sweetly funny stoner into a shouting, mean-spirited, insensitive child. Pete retreats selfishly from a wife, Debbie who suffocates him with insane, but strangely familiar, expectations. All the players at some point become irrational, and this is where Alison (Hiegl's character) escapes criticism. Because she is pregnant, any outburst, any unmotivated action is easily excused, and ironically, she may have the fewest anyway. She's still Izzy fromGrey's Anatomy - The Complete First Season, but without the self-righteousness. She's the superlative and a little hard to identify with, but in a good way.Despite Rogen's and Hiegl's competence, it's the little characters that really make this film shine. Leslie Mann, Alison's older sister, somehow seems like both a potentially wonderful mother and potential basket case. She teeters on greatness and disaster and I love and identify with her for it. Jason Segel, whose turn on CBS's How I Met Your Mother is nothing short of phenomenal, shines here as a slacker friend, unfoundedly cocky, and somehow endearing. He effortlessly controls the screen. Most wonderful, though, is Paul Rudd's Pete. I've never seen a character like him animated on the screen. After attempting just now several times, it's impossible to describe what's with this character. I guess there's a kind of absent, off-hand responsibility to him that just makes for compelling screen time. An Oscar worthy performance that, sadly, will never manifest in a nomination because of the kind of movie this is.The film is undeniably funny on all levels.

Barely a second went by without a very funny joke popping up. One of the scene-stealers in that film was Seth Rogen, who gained the lead in director Judd Apatow's film ""Knocked Up"" and co-wrote/co-starred in one of the other highest grossing comedies of this year ""Superbad."" In ""Knocked Up"" (which is either the funniest or 2nd funniest film of 2007), Rogen plays Ben...An overweight, unemployed, loser that is working on a website with his 4 buddies/roommates that sounds a lot like Mr. Skin. Katherine Heigl (of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" who is stunning) plays Allison, the beautiful, skinny, woman-of-every-guys-dreams kind of girl that works on the E! network.On the night of her promotion, Allison goes to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and ends up going home with Ben. 8 weeks later, she finds out that she's pregnant. The rest of the film deals with Ben and Allison trying to fall in love, so they can raise the baby together. Just as Apatow did with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" he takes a very simple premise and extends it into an over 2-hour film that never grows dull and always stays funny. And ""Knocked Up,"" is funny. All the actors are perfect and Apatow is proving himself to be one of the most talented comedic writer & director's in the business. Comedy is a word that is used pretty loosely these days. Most ""comedies"" are 90 minutes long, with 4 funny jokes (see ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny."" Actually, don't see it...It proves what I mean). This film actually deserves to be dubbed a comedy, because it's actually funny.

1092833,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000TZJBP6,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[5, 7]","In 2007, Director Judd Apatow comes back with another ""over the top"" adult comedy--that probably will do well at the box office. Knocked Up is without a doubt; a step down from his previous 2005 smash hit The 40 year old Virgin. This time around, we get a much simpler story, draggy moments, irritating characters, and excessive profanity--which is pure comedy for some--with occasional laughs. These are not the only ""qualities"" of his latest creation. I almost forgot to mention that the movie is more than 2 hours long, for a comedy! If you're married man and want to get out of the house, skip this movie at all costs because it will probably make you hate your life.Brief Story (small spoilers):The young and attractive Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) works behind the scenes for the E! TV Network. Suddenly she is promoted to be on TV--probably because of her looks. These are exciting news because she always wanted to be on TV. She decides to celebrate her promotion and goes to a nightclub along with her older sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). At the bar, she meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who she finds interesting--despite his not-so-great looks. After dancing and many drinks, they go back to her house--which is the same house where her sister Debbie lives with her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) and 2 kids. They have sex without protection.The next morning she finds out ugly truths about the guy she slept with the night before--an irresponsible pothead who has no money and doesn't work. Ben is not the right man for Alison (apparently). Alison leaves him but a bigger problem is coming. She finds out that she is pregnant and their problems begin.Review:Knocked Up is probably the most irritating movie I've seen this year, with very few laughs and over the top profanity--even Martin Scorsese would get offended with the language. Director Judd Appatow wrote a very simple story; poles-apart couple gets drunk (one night stand), she gets pregnant and they have to make the best of it. Everybody loves a baby, right? While this dysfunctional and irresponsible couple is dealing with their mistakes, they fight and reunited, then fight some more until the predictable ""happy"" ending. It's not the plot what bothers me; it's the annoying characters that portray the worst of the American society. Our characters are; a jealous married woman who gets angry all the time; a frustrated husband who wants to get out of the house; a fat pothead guy who smokes all the time and doesn't know what to do with his life and an unsecured young girl. Is the immaturity what makes people laugh?I don't understand what's so funny about couples fighting and swearing at each other every few minutes. Apparently this is the kind of material that has become the ""mainstream"" comedy in America today--the abysmally bad movie The Break Up is another example of this kind of comedy. Why everything has to be in excess? Too much swearing and drug use gets old pretty fast.I'm not even going to talk about technical issues like special effects, continuity or logic in this film--things like these can be overlooked in comedy. Is there something good in Knocked Up? I just want to say that ""some"" of the situations in the film did make me laugh--especially, the second love scene and the kid's birthday party. Also the best character in the movie is Pete. He is a likable guy and we understand where he is coming from--I'd kill myself if I had a wife like that-- but he is calm and has some good lines in the movie.The Verdict:This kind of comedy is very successful nowadays and after telling people what I thought about Knocked Up, as weird as it sounds, some of you might still watch it and find it entertaining. I'm not going to deny it, there are few good laughs, but it goes too far with the profanity and the drug use. Also, I wasn't too happy the way the director portrays the American society. I guess stereotypes work well in the genre.",3,Probably the most overrated comedy in history.,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3926,"['2007', 'Director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'back', 'top', 'adult', 'comedy', 'probably', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'doubt', 'step', 'down', 'previous', '2005', 'smash', 'hit', '40', 'year', 'old', 'Virgin', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'much', 'simpler', 'story', 'draggy', 'moments', 'irritating', 'characters', 'excessive', 'profanity', 'pure', 'comedy', 'occasional', 'laughs', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'qualities', 'latest', 'creation', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'movie', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'married', 'man', 'want', 'get', 'house', 'skip', 'movie', 'costs', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'hate', 'life.Brief', 'Story', 'small', 'spoilers', 'young', 'attractive', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'scenes', 'E', 'TV', 'Network', 'Suddenly', 'promoted', 'be', 'TV', 'probably', 'looks', 'are', 'exciting', 'news', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'TV', 'celebrate', 'promotion', 'nightclub', 'older', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'bar', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'interesting', 'not-so-great', 'looks', 'dancing', 'many', 'drinks', 'go', 'back', 'house', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'husband', 'Pete', 'Paul', 'Rudd', '2', 'kids', 'have', 'sex', 'protection.The', 'next', 'morning', 'out', 'ugly', 'truths', 'guy', 'slept', 'night', 'before', 'irresponsible', 'pothead', 'who', 'money', ""n't"", 'work', 'Ben', 'not', 'right', 'man', 'Alison', 'apparently', 'Alison', 'bigger', 'problem', 'coming', 'out', 'pregnant', 'problems', 'begin.Review', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'probably', 'most', 'irritating', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'very', 'few', 'laughs', 'top', 'profanity', 'even', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'would', 'get', 'offended', 'language', 'Director', 'Judd', 'Appatow', 'wrote', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'poles-apart', 'couple', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'pregnant', 'have', 'make', 'best', 'Everybody', 'baby', 'right', 'dysfunctional', 'irresponsible', 'couple', 'dealing', 'mistakes', 'fight', 'reunited', 'then', 'fight', 'more', 'predictable', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'plot', 'what', 'annoying', 'characters', 'portray', 'worst', 'American', 'society', 'characters', 'are', 'jealous', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'angry', 'time', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'who', 'get', 'house', 'fat', 'pothead', 'guy', 'who', 'time', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'unsecured', 'young', 'girl', 'immaturity', 'what', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'couples', 'fighting', 'swearing', 'other', 'few', 'minutes', 'Apparently', 'kind', 'material', 'become', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'America', 'today', 'abysmally', 'bad', 'movie', 'Break', 'Up', 'example', 'kind', 'comedy', 'Why', 'everything', 'be', 'excess', 'Too', 'much', 'swearing', 'drug', 'use', 'old', 'pretty', 'fast.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'talk', 'technical', 'issues', 'special', 'effects', 'continuity', 'logic', 'film', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'comedy', 'there', 'something', 'good', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'situations', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'laugh', 'especially', 'second', 'love', 'scene', 'kid', 'birthday', 'party', 'Also', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'Pete', 'likable', 'guy', 'understand', 'where', 'coming', ""'d"", 'kill', 'had', 'wife', 'calm', 'good', 'lines', 'movie.The', 'Verdict', 'kind', 'comedy', 'very', 'successful', 'nowadays', 'telling', 'people', 'what', 'thought', 'about', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'as', 'weird', 'might', 'still', 'watch', 'find', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'deny', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'too', 'far', 'profanity', 'drug', 'use', 'Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'way', 'director', 'American', 'society', 'guess', 'stereotypes', 'work', 'well', 'genre']",Knocked Up

Because it was a success in that first movie it seems every single ""comedy"" since has fallen into the same trap.  Instead of being original and coming up with their own jokes they copy all the other movies and repeat it verbatim.  The only difference is they take different actors and actresses and make it ""unpredictable"" by changing up where the jokes are going to go.  Give it a new name and you have ""A fresh and hilarious comedy sure to entertain!""This is one of those movies.  There's no originality (in plot or jokes) and it's annoying to watch.  I hate movies that like to get cheap laughs.  It's insulting to me but obviously the producers know their audience well because it never fails to get a ""falling on the floor crying"" response out of 12 year olds.  And why, why, WHY do people think the more vulgar a movie is and the more they swear the ""cooler"" and ""funnier"" the movie is.  I'm so tired of the f-bomb getting dropped every other word.  Swearing was cool when you were, say, back in middle school.  When you're out of college it just makes you sound like trailer trash and uneducated.

1092836,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000TZJBP6,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 8]","After seeing Judd Apatow's hilarious smash comedy ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and hearing the great things about his follow-up movie, ""Knocked Up"", I looked forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch it. However, I seemed to never get around to watching ""Knocked Up"", the movie that many called `the best comedy of 2007', so I eventually just forgot all about it. That is until my wife and I caught the trailer on TV recently and we finally decided to go rent the movie and see if it could live up to all the hype that had been bestowed upon it since its release last year.""Knocked Up"" tells the story of Ben (Seth Rogen), a slacker who has nothing more on his mind than hanging out with friends and having a good time, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a career woman who longs for bigger and better things to come so long as she can stay focused on the path she's set herself upon. Then, after an intoxicated one night stand, and two months and countless pregnancy tests later, Alison and Ben find themselves in for the surprise of their lives as they must prepare themselves to welcome a new bouncing bundle of joy into their world. Now these two complete opposites are trying to get to know each other and begin a relationship, figure out what they need for the baby, and above all else how to become two mature, responsible parents.Well, I guess the question is, did ""Knocked Up"" live up to all the hype that moviegoers built up around it, or was the weight of it all too much for it to handle? I would have to say that the movie successfully lived up to the hype with relative ease, as my wife and I laughed aloud numerous times throughout the movie, and easily enjoyed every minute of it. The story for ""Knocked Up"" was hilarious, often times crude, and surprisingly heartfelt several times throughout the movie. I liked that the story didn't solely rely on sight gags to get the laughs, it featured a smartly written script that was chock full of hilarious one-liners, and uncomfortable yet hilarious situations that can occur throughout pregnancy and child birth. Kudos to Judd Apatow for delivering a solid script that was not only incredibly funny, but was also serious at times to break up the proceedings without being too overly dramatic to distract from the fact that it was still a comedy. Some comedy writers are too scared to try for any actual drama within their story, which is fine as well; while others try to fit it in but fail to make the various elements gel properly. Which is what makes Judd such a great writer is that he knows how to make each of the components of his story work well with each other and seem natural within the overall movie.The cast was hilarious and fully capable of handling anything Judd Apatow's script could throw at them, and each created such fun and engaging characters that there was never a dull moment in the movie. Seth Rogen's (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") character of Ben was hilarious as we get to see how uncomfortable he is around kids, yet over time he matures into a more responsible adult who is essentially ready to do what is necessary as a parent to a newborn child. Katherine Heigl (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"") brought a more serious character with Alison to balance out Ben's more outlandish behavior, though she wasn't without her moments of hilarity as well. Even though her character was much more mature from the start, she still had her own arc that took her from career-minded woman to a pregnant woman full of uncontrollable hormones who is struggling to keep her sanity amidst a somewhat dim-witted boyfriend, a controlling sister, and a job where her looks define her success, and eventually into a woman ready to welcome a child into the world with the man she loves, no matter how mismatched they may be. The supporting cast led by Paul Rudd (""40 Year Old Virgin""), Leslie Mann (""Drillbit Taylor""), and Jonah Hill (""Superbad"") were hilarious and made their characters just as memorable as the two leads. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's married characters of Pete and Debbie were a possible glimpse into what the future held for Ben and Alison, which was a nice way to show the do's and don'ts of parenting and marriage. Jonah Hill was absolutely hilarious as the outspoken and opinionated Jonah, who is one of Ben's many slacker friends. Turning up in surprising cameos are actor/director Harold Ramis (""Analyze This"") and Joanna Kerns (TV's ""Growing Pains"") as Ben's dad and Alison's mom, I guess this just shows that a Judd Apatow movie will attract all different types of talent, so you never know what to expect.""Knocked Up"" is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie that easily lives up to the hype surrounding it, and did not disappoint in the least. I highly recommend watching ""Knocked Up"" if you're a fan of Judd Apatow or if you are a person who is not easily offended and is looking for a hilarious comedy that will keep you laughing from start to finish.""Knocked Up"" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain language and nudity/sexuality.",4,Talk About Getting More Than You Bargained For...,1207353600,"04 5,

But this movie was actually pleasurable, although it isn't stellar. If you believe that opposites attract when it comes to romance, you may find this believable. Basically, a goofball guy falls into bed with a far different type of person and she gets pregnant. That is the set-up for the rest of the movie. The main characters, guy and woman,play their parts relatively seriously, compared to the supporting actors (who go far to enliven this movie).Anyway, this was a fine way to spend a night at the movies. The jokes come fast and furiously but you know what they say about humor - it can be tricky to create comedy that appeals to everyone. For me, this just wasn't above 3 stars in that department.Some of you, I'm sure, will find this far more delightful than I did so I hesitate to discourage you from seeing it.

Together they aspire to create the next Mr. Skin website devoted to informing other miscreants of their ilk about nude scenes in movies.  He is a pathetic loser and I had to really struggle to like him.  Katherine Heigl plays Alison, an ambitious entertainment journalist on the verge of mainstream success.  One of the early scenes involving her work includes a great self-parodying cameo by Ryan Seacrest.  Anyway, the two coincidentally meet one night at a bar and drink enough that Alison makes the mistake of spending the night with Stone and she gets pregnant.  We watch the characters develop in this normal and almost universally relative scenario.  Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann almost top the two leads in their performances as Allison's sister Debbie and her seemingly uninterested husband Pete.  It seems to me that Rudd just gets better and better with each supporting role.  Ben has a long way to go before he can deal with becoming a father and his transformation might have been in danger of not being a convincing one were it not for Rogen's subtly attached performance.  He really carries the film.Anyway, Knocked Up had a lot of hype in a time of quality comedies.  It seems there are two sides that watch comedies.  One side is the stern critic that shuns pure slapstick and cheap humor and the other is the side that will gladly watch films like Billy Madison, Hot Rod, and Old School over and over again.  The stern critic in me accepts that Knocked Up is a halfway decent film even without all of the great humor but the other side in me sees the often outrageous humor in Knocked Up as its greatest strength.  It really does have some incredibly funny moments that make the often slow pace of the story much easier to drudge through.  It is overall a very enjoyable movie and seems shorter than its surprising length (over two hours).  I heard one critic say that Knocked Up is in bad need of an editor.  That's probably true and the pacing issues are the primary reason I won't give Knocked Up a perfect rating.The film has some great cameos throughout and contains many of director Judd Apatow's (The 40 Year Old Virgin) regulars from his old television show Freaks and Geeks.  The cast is a surprisingly effective collaboration and the cameos are both effective and funny.  The humor never gets too stupid but there are times where it gets pretty close.

Too much later for me. Katherine Heigl's character is too nice. Unbelievably so. For instance, she doesn't want to change Rogan's character. She wants to accept him for what he is. Great, except he's a chronic pot smoker with no work ethic whose friends make him look like a real go-getter. And she doesn't want to change him. Great parents they'll make.The only character I actually liked in the show was the brother-in-law, the poor guy.There are a couple of funny scenes, but overall, this is a boring and frustrating film.

1092845,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000TZJBP6,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[1, 2]","I've been a fan of Director/Writer, Jud Apatow's work since the original run of his (criminally) underappreciated NBC TV comedy, ""Freaks & Geeks"". Since then he had the feature film, mega-hit ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", which basically made comedian, Steve Carell a full fledged star. Apatow now continues his streak of creating uproarious comedy, that has heart, with his latest release, ""Knocked Up"".""Knocked Up"" is a film about two very different characters, who normally, would probably have very little to do with each other. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is in her early twenties, tall, blonde and beautiful. She sort of looks like a ""Barbie doll"" come to life. On top of that, she's smart, motivated and her begining career at ""The E-Channel"" is on the rise. Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) is also in his early twenties. He's somewhat over-weight, has a mop of curley hair and seems to sport a permanent, five O'clock shadow. He sort of looks like a young Jewish, John Belushi. Ben is also smart, but totally unmotivated with no real job or prospects. His main interest seems to be hanging out with his roommates, shooting the breeze about porn and getting really stoned.One night at a club these two meet. Through hormones, lots of alcohol and a misunderstanding about a condom, they suddenly have something in common. Alison's pregnant. This is a story of two very different people, who initially are together because of their circumstances, but go on to find out, that they  might actually like and care about each other. But is it enough stay in a relationship? Is it enough to form a family? Are people willing to make commitments and change their lives for each other? Thats what this movie looks at.What makes this movie so good is Apatow's excellent story and dialogue. The subject matter could easily have been turned into malk-ish, standard Hollywood mush. Instead Apatow keeps things real. His characters often voice, what we often think about relationships, but dare not speak. The hilarious, gutt-busting dialogue (which I'm sure a lot is improvised) can be crude, rude & lewd, but most of it (if you agree with it or not) seems to have a grain a truth to it.The film's cast is wonderful. Seth Rogan & Katherine Heigel give fantastic performances really making us want to root for these disperate characters to stay together. The rest of the cast, like-wise does an excellent job. Many of them are veterens of previous Apatow productions including Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill ETC. You might not know them by name, but you will recognize the faces. Also look for cameos from Jessica Alba, Steve Carell, Andy Dick, James Franco, Eva Mendes and a hilariously b**chy turn from Ryan Seacrest!Finally, I want to mention that their are two different versions of this DVD release. There is a plain 1-disc version and a 2-disc ""Collector's Edition"". By all means, spend the extra cash and go for the ""Collector's Edition"". Its just brimming with over 3 hours of extras, much of it being deleted scenes, outtakes and extended scenes, that in many cases are even funnier, then what eventually ended up in the movie. I laughed my a** off! You will not be sorry. Get the 2-disc ""Collector's Edition"". Great movie!

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 10]","When I found out that Seth Rogen (""Forty-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Freaks and Geeks"") would be headlining a comedy with the gorgeous Katherine Heigl (""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Roswell,"" ""Just Bring It""), I knew it would be comedic gold.  Instead, ""Knocked Up,"" directed by ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" navigator, Judd Apatow, is a dull comedy with only flashes of brilliance from Apatow and Rogan's previous outing.  In ""Knocked Up,"" Heigl plays Alison, an up-and-comer at E! Entertainment Television who goes out on the town with her sister (Leslie Mann) to celebrate her recent promotion.  While out, Alison runs into uber-pothead/loser/internet porn entrepreneur, Ben (Rogen) and his gaggle of geeky friends.  In true drunken fashion, the pair end up consummating their brief encounter with a little intercourse.  When Alison wakes up and sees what's lying next to her, she immediately tries her best to put as much distance between her and Ben as possible.  Unfortunately for her and Ben, however, she's pregnant.  The rest of the story is a thin and obvious plot of the pair arguing, hating each other, doubting their forced relationship and eventually falling for each other.  Ben has to prove that he's a responsible man.  Alison has to learn to trust him.  They both have to grow up a bit.Along the way there's a subplot of Rogen's geeky friends trying to start up a webpage listing the play time into a film in which certain actresses appear in varying degrees of nudity.  There's another subplot in which Alison's sister and her husband (Paul Rudd, also of ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"") are at odds with one another.The whole film just feels like a jumbled mess of pop culture references (which grow tiring after awhile) and a dull romance that weighs down the film even more.  Rogen and Heigl are not believeable as a couple (even in the comedic sense) and their respective friends (all of which are from the Apatow stable) wear thin on the viewer.In short, don't watch ""Knocked Up"" hoping for another ""Virgin.""  This film, while it has its moments, is not up to par with it's elder brother.

Entertainment Television. The day she receives her promotion Alison goes out to celebrate with her older sister, Debbie, at a nightclub. It's there that she meets Ben, an unmotivated pothead who lives with four roommates and doesn't have a job ""per se."" Ben and his roommates are working on creating a Web site that will allow you to search for your favorite actress's nude scenes. When Ben and Allison meet, even though she's gorgeous and he's a pudgy, hairy mess, there's something about his personality and charm that wins her over. Eventually they wind up back at her place and you can guess from the title what happens next.Knocked Up is the story of the way that Alison and Ben have to navigate an unplanned pregnancy and what it will mean for their individual futures, the future of their unborn child, and their collective relationship. It goes over every aspect of an unplanned pregnancy: do we or don't we have it?, what's going to happen to my career?, is this the right person for me? All of these questions are tackled in an honest and humorous fashion. And, even if you aren't into it for the pregnancy angle, there's so much more to the movie. Alison's sister has been married with children for a few years and feels that her relationship is stagnating. Her husband, played by Paul Rudd, is in no such rut and instead manages to be completely oblivious to his wife's concerns. Ben's roommates, also unmotivated potheads, have to figure out what to do if their planned celebrity sex scene Web site doesn't pan out the way they'd planned. As a whole, Knocked Up was just an all around interesting and multifaceted romantic comedy.

""Knocked Up"", a comedy and love story about a pair of mismated lovers that brew up a child, is the funniest and most touching film I've seen in months. It has humor, good acting, strong production values and a topical message for people that like that sort of thing. It is escapist fare for the 20-something set that also appeals to anyone that's seen a Doris Day-Rock Hudson screwball comedy. Had that pair made their films in the new century, the result surely would have been ""Knocked Up"".I'd recommend this movie to anyone above the age of PG-13 viewership and even to some kids younger than that. This, principally, is because of the way the film deals with the awkward situation created when a couple meets in a bar, has a one nighter, and that results in a child. Much of what goes on in this film is a realistic portrayal of the realities of such a situation. The rest is done for fun and this movie is a lot of fun.There is no question why this film was an overwhelming hit both in the theaters and with critics around the world. It has all the elements of great filmmaking -- likeable characters, situations the audience can relate to, very strong production values and good acting in all the principal roles. While the characterizations are two dimensional, that should not detract from anyone's enjoyment of this flick. If you are one of the few people on this planet that hasn't seen this movie yet, go out to your local video store and rent it or buy it at the modest price Amazon vendors ask.

1092861,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000TZJBP6,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 5]","I laughed repeatedly, hard & often during ""Knocked Up.""  I felt positively geezerish sitting in theatre full of college age people.  I found myself laughing in places in which they were quiet.  Judd Apatow who won an Emmy writing for ""The Ben Stiller Show"" is coming off the tremendously successfulThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Special Edition) [HD DVD].  This film is a fitting follow-up to that wildly funny film.One might ask how Seth Rogan, who does not look like a leading man, wound up as the romantic lead in this picture.  That's what can happen when you also serve as executive producer.  Rogan was in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" as well as inYou, Me and Dupree (Widescreen Edition)& the voice of the Captain in ""Shreck III.""  As Ben Stone, he does really touch us, seeming like the quintessential nice guy who does his best to live up to the demands of unexpected fatherhood.  We might not like looking at his bare bottom all that much, but he seems like a nice guy.Katherine Heigl looks every inch the movie star in this film.  With her TV role inRoswell - The Complete First Seasonand now on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" she teamed with Michael Landon Jr. for two heartwarming family dramas,Love's Enduring Promise&Love Comes Softly.  As Alison Scott, we're not quite sure why she connects with Ben Stone.  He seems like such a strange slacker.  But given the pregnancy, she tries to explore a relationship with him and grows to love him.  This may be the most difficult part of the film to accept.Paul Rudd who was in ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,"" ""Night at the Museum,"" ""The Ex,"" & ""Clueless"" does a good job as Pete the brother-in-law who loves fantasy baseball.  Judd Apatow's wife Leslie Mann who was in ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,"" ""Orange County,""She's the One, & ""The Cable Guy"" plays Debbie who is high strung and doubts her marriage.  The Apatows' real life daughters Iris & Maude play Debbie's two daughters in the film.Of the smaller character roles, Charlyne Yi who plays Jodi had me in stitches.  She's so blase and says the most inappropriate things with such utter sweetness that it kept making me giggle.  Martin Starr plays Martin who makes a bet and has to grow a beard in the film.  He played with Heigl in three episodes of ""Roswell.""  His stone-faced performance is funny in a very low-key, low-energy way.  Harold Ramis has a nice cameo as Ben's dad.I laughed hard during this movie.  It touches some of the most basic needs of both men and women, to be fathers and mothers and do right by our children.  Through Paul Rudd's and Katherine Heigl's characters, it also explores the balance between what we need as individuals, our ""me-time,"" and what we devote of ourselves to our families.  The drug scene stuff didn't add a lot to the film for me, but maybe some of the more youthful members of the audience had fun with that.  I found this to be a sparkling comedy, well worth the time.

There are many examples of this; but one of the more glaring is the very last scene.  The male lead announces - seemingly seriously - that he has got a spacious apartment in East LA.  Then, in the same scene, the car is shown going down the California Incline onto the Pacific Coast Highway, heading north.  Now, perhaps the guy was joking about living in East LA, but he could hardly be living in an apartment somewhere up the PCH, since his apartment is a short drive from the female lead's apartment and SHE doesn't live up the PCH.  The geography of Los Angeles is played fast and loose and vague throughout the movie.  The first scene involves the female lead driving her sister's kids ""to school"" and what we see is a ""five mile"" drive down San Vicente, heading out to the beach.  Now, first of all, the kids are quite separate in age, so they would not be going to the same school.  The younger kid wouldn't even be old enough for pre-school.  And yet we are supposed to swallow that they go ""to school"" somewhere in Santa Monica, because that's where they're headed.  But actually we are not supposed to think anything of the kind.  This is one of those movies where the audience is not supposed to know anything  about LA.  So you'll see some driving down San Vicente, because its real purty, with no justification for it, no idea of where these people are supposed to live or where they are going.

There are children being born who will never know their father, cos their mother had too much to drink to ask him to wear some protection. Or take her pill. Many boyfriends would run a mile and then keep running if their girlfriend turned round and said they were pregnant. Imagine what they would do if it was a one night stand who said they were pregnant?!Here's a film that turns all that on its head. The girl who should have been out of his league, has a few too many and sleeps with the guy who has 'moobs' and a mop of curly hair. He thinks he's scored, they part ways. She discovers she's pregnant eight weeks later, just as she gets a promotion at work, hunts him down to tell him, and he agrees to stick by her, thankfully without asking the question that would get him a slap: ""Is it mine?""That's the basic premise of the movie, starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen in the lead roles. It's an absolutely brilliant movie, dealing with various relationship problems, sometimes a bit too much, as I found some scenes difficult to deal with. Maybe I was feeling a bit insecure that night, who knows? The bit where she threw him out the car in the middle of nowhere gave me shivers up my spine. A lot of the jokes about the roommate with the beard, and ever growing hair went straight over my head.I never got into The 40 Year Old Virgin, so I can't really comment on the comparisons to that.

Steve Carrell also makes a cameo, along with Jessica Simpson & Jessica Alba.An 18 year old guy I work with also went to see this movie the same night I did, and we were discussing it the next day, and he admitted to being scared stiff at the birth scene at the end. Oh dear, that's the wool been lifted from his eyes! You do see EVERYTHING unfortunately, including a reflection in a mirror of a baby's head crowning. It's a fleeting glimpse, but enough to make me want to cross my legs!Knocked Up is an excellent movie, about a true to life topic, and has a happy ending when it all works out.

Two months later, their misunderstanding they had about condom use, comes back to haunt them as Alison discovers she is pregnant.  Ben and Alison decide to give it a shot and get to know each other, since either way, their lives are now entwined.Director Judd Apatow's follow up to ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" shows that he is a gifter writer and director.  ""Knocked Up"" has all the charm of his first film, and is excellent.  Heigl and Rogan are a cute couple, and have great chemistry.  Rogan is hilarious as usual, and this could very well be a breakout role for him.  The rest of the cast is pulled from Apatow's previous works ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"".

1092881,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000TZJBP6,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","Allison Scott (Katherine Hiegl) is part of the E! Television Network's round table of gossip columnists. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the head of an X-rated website that him and his buddies (Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Martin Starr) where viewers can see famous actresses in the buff. The two meet at a night club where they down alcoholic beverages, which culminates in a one night stand. However, Ben forgot to use protection and has just got Allison knocked up, thus throwing a monkey wrench in her career. Eventually, the two agree to work it out for the sake of their newborn carriage, but they may have some trouble after they get a bit of experience from Allison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd).I would like to meet anyone who wasn't in love with director Judd Apatow's 2005 smash ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"". Filled with the most raucous humor sans farcical situations, and a breakout performance from Steve Carrell, it proved that R-rated comedies were coming back full force, and Apatow became king of the world. It would be hard to follow up something of that success. But in a time when well-meaning actors/actresses like Lindsay Lohan and Larry the Cable Guy are slumming in rancid films that demean their talents (""Georgia Rule"", ""Delta Farce""), put any doubts to rest. ""Knocked Up"" will slap you silly and put a smile on your face.Besides, what other film this summer has Ryan Seacrest going off about E! Network's star-****ing mentalities?""Knocked Up"", pretty much like Virgin, definitely goes for laughs, and even if it does have the traits of ""touching moments"" and ""characters you really care about, Apatow never sacrifices tone, nor does he get too heavy (a round of applause for not throwing in spousal abuse or death scenes, that would've playing to the rafters instead of tickling the audience's imaginations and funny bones). He throws in a game cast (featuring some returning players from ""Virgin"", ""Saturday Night Live""'s Kristin Wiig and Bill Hader as E! Network crew members, legendary comedy director Harold Ramis as Ben's swinging father, Apatow children Iris and Maude as the Pete and Debbie's offspring), a smart script that never leans on stereotypes (the gay crowd gets another tongue lashing with hilarious results) or awful slapstick scenarios, and plenty of ad-libbing (cast members do impersonations of Robert De Niro and Larry Flint, the latter of which scores the biggest laughs courtesy of Jonah Hill) to make an effective piece of comic joy.Of course, Apatow leans on a new subject for the satire. ""Virgin"" took aim on electronics and video games. For ""Knocked Up"", the E! Network, home of star ****ers (those who can't get enough of Brangelina, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, and TomKat), gets the treatment. While not EVERYONE from the network pops up, Apatow brings in a couple of guests into the mix (James Franco of ""Spider-Man"" fame gets a noteworthy scene - you rarely ever see a sentence with ""James Franco"" and ""noteworthy scene"" put together) and, as I said, Seacrest himself adds a satirical line that gossip-loving geeks with tender ears out there might not want to listen to. But for me, it was worth the matinee ticket.Aside from that, the raunch factor is still high. I'm talking about near-frontal nudity, lap dancers in Vegas, jokes about Martin's new beard, Jonah's panic attacks about pubic hair and dead people at the hospital, Jason's warnings about Jay ""rearing"" his child (you don't have to get the joke to know that it's hysterical), the Scott family discussing how babies are born, and the explicit birth. And the pot jokes... Pete and Ben's little mushroom binder culminates in one of the funniest scenes courtesy of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd being as over-the-top in tears as possible. I couldn't agree more.I will say this, and get it out of the way: I do not understand the hype that is ""Grey's Anatomy""! With quirky terms like ""McSteamy"" or ""McDreamy"", and stupid soap opera to go about, who in their right mind would love this overrated crap? No wonder potentially good shows like ""Andy Barker, P.I."" and ""Kitchen Confidential"" (yes, I said it!) are put to sleep. Still, not whatsoever did that have an affect on embracing a solid performance by star Katherine Hiegl. She is no comedienne whatsoever, but by playing the straight role, she is able to stack up well against the comedy troupe with some memorable scenes, especially when sided against someone as fiercely hilarious as Mrs. Apatow herself, Leslie Mann (who has yet to disappoint me). As far as I'm concerned, this ""GA"" vet will be one to follow.Seth Rogen fares well too. Whether it's sharing time with his porno site staffers (no red herring in that troupe), relatives, Allison's family members (his scenes with Paul Rudd are the best), or Allison herself, Rogen makes some great, and relevant (especially in the third act), decisions. And I dare any birth doctor out their to screw HIM over. Rogen's still playing Cal from ""Virgin"", only in the lead role, and I hope it ain't his last. I predict a hosting job come the season premiere for ""Saturday Night Live"".""Knocked Up"" is also a comedy that is long, much like these high-concept films of this genre (""The Holiday""). It's not a bad thing, though, as Apatow (the only screenwriter) puts all his thought on his characters and the situations they must face. I still won't watch ""Grey's Anatomy"", but heavens, here's to a bright future for Hiegl's blooming acting career.",5,"""Hey, don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out!""",1180742400,"06

Be irresponsible! Show a complete andutter lack of common sense! Have no self-respect and get pregnantout of wedlock with the next drunken rube who comes along!

1092883,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000TZJBP6,mirasreviews,"[5, 11]","""Knocked Up"" is an attempt by writer/director Judd Apatow to build a sophisticated-but-potty-mouthed comedy around modern sexual mores and male-female relationships following his success in that vein with 2005's ""40-Year-Old Virgin"". This time, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an ambitious young entertainment reporter, who celebrates her recent promotion by hitting a hip club with her uptight older sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). There, Alison gets drunk and picks up a mildly amusing, aimless pothead named Ben Stone (Seth Rogen). She sleeps with him. She gets pregnant. She decides she should get to know Ben and ask for his blessings and support with her impending motherhood.Beautiful young women don't sleep with losers. ""Knocked Up"" deals with this fact of life by assuring us that Alison was good'n'plastered when she did it. Women don't drag men they hardly know to every gynecologist in town either. Or any men, for that matter. Half of the behavior in this film is unrealistic. The other half is so dysfunctional that I sure hope it's unrealistic. It must have taken a lot of work to invent 2 hours and 10 minutes of bizarre activity for one prissy pregnant woman, her paranoid harpy sister, and infantile doughy boyfriend. These are the sort of characters who expend a great deal of energy creating problems for themselves where there are none.That would be all right if it were funny. But ""Knocked Up"" is a half hour too long and contains one funny scene: Alison's home pregnancy tests. It's early in the movie. The rest are dull interactions among people whose conflicts are caused by the fact that their expectations of one another come from another planet, as far as I can make out. At some point it deteriorates into a cliched battle of the sexes. The most remarkable thing about ""Knocked Up"" is that is has puritanical undertones in spite of all the sex and drugs. Like ""40-Year-Old Virgin"", it promotes extremely conservative values. This time it's nuclear families and choosing baby over career.",3,"Absurdly Long, Boring, Neurotic Alleged Romantic Comedy.",1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2016,"['Knocked', 'Up', 'attempt', 'writer/director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'build', 'sophisticated-but-potty-mouthed', 'comedy', 'modern', 'sexual', 'mores', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'following', 'success', 'vein', '2005', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'time', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'ambitious', 'young', 'entertainment', 'reporter', 'who', 'recent', 'promotion', 'hitting', 'hip', 'club', 'uptight', 'older', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Alison', 'drunk', 'up', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'aimless', 'pothead', 'named', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'pregnant', 'should', 'get', 'know', 'Ben', 'ask', 'blessings', 'support', 'impending', 'motherhood.Beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'losers', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'deals', 'fact', 'life', 'assuring', 'Alison', 'was', 'good', ""n'plastered"", 'when', 'did', 'Women', 'do', ""n't"", 'drag', 'men', 'hardly', 'know', 'gynecologist', 'town', 'either', 'men', 'matter', 'Half', 'behavior', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'other', 'half', 'so', 'dysfunctional', 'sure', 'hope', 'unrealistic', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'lot', 'work', 'invent', '2', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'bizarre', 'activity', 'one', 'prissy', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'paranoid', 'harpy', 'sister', 'infantile', 'doughy', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'sort', 'characters', 'who', 'expend', 'great', 'deal', 'energy', 'creating', 'problems', 'where', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'all', 'right', 'were', 'funny', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'half', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'funny', 'scene', 'Alison', 'home', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'early', 'movie', 'rest', 'are', 'dull', 'interactions', 'people', 'conflicts', 'are', 'caused', 'fact', 'expectations', 'one', 'come', 'planet', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'point', 'cliched', 'battle', 'sexes', 'most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'puritanical', 'undertones', 'spite', 'sex', 'drugs', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'values', 'time', 'nuclear', 'families', 'choosing', 'baby', 'career']",Knocked Up
1092884,A1E8HGPHF98MOV,B000TZJBP6,Mister Chris,"[4, 6]","Critics, what were you smokin'?  ""knocked Up,"" 2007's surprise blockbuster from Hollywood's new R-rated comedy king Judd Apatow, got such positive spin that I was primed for a raunchy good time.  Nearly 2 1/2 hours later I, like most of the characters in this movie, needed anger management.  Never have I seen a ""romantic"" comedy this hell bent on bucking logic as well as taste. (And never have I heard the word ""F--k"" used this much since ""Scarface."")The premise is simple.  Think ""Beauty and the Geek.""  A gorgeous up and coming TV personality (Gray's Anatamy's Katherine Heigl) sleeps with an unemployed loser (Seth Rogen) after a drunken night out.  She gets pregnant.  They play house.Now, in the movie world this plot line would make sense under one precondition:  that the loser would be such a lovable little loon that we would root for him to win the girl's heart against all odds.  It would also help if the loser was played by someone with some crazed zeal like Jack Black or Adam Sandler.  In the person of Seth Rogen we just get one thing- a loser.  Rogen's character is such a pot-headed man/child and a foul-mouthed cry baby that we can in no way believe the beautiful Heigl would touch him with a ten foot pole. It like walking into a depressing movie version of hell where a glamorous actress settles for an uninteresting minor player instead of the charismatic leading man.Is it funny?  Sure, if your definition of funny is seeing every character going into some foul-mouthed rant as if they were caffeine addicts told that their local Starbucks was out of coffee.  Even Ryan Seacrest in a cameo is in desperate need of a time out.  And I'm no prude. I've often argued  that profanity if used in the proper context can almost be poetry. Richard Pryor and George Carlin are trash talkin' Shakespeares.  Apatow's script is just trash.  Cuss words here are not icing on the cake but filler for lack of anything better to say.In a way ""Knocked Up"" presents a world as seen through the eyes of a 15-year old.  It's a pubescent fantasy where that unobtainable hottie is into slackers who have no ambition, smoke dope, and like Internet porn.  It's a ""romantic comedy"" for the Howard Stern set.

1092894,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000TZJBP6,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","Hollywood films have a peculiar relationship with the institution of marriage.  On the one hand, it is depicted as lifeless and loveless, as without any inherent interest or dramatic tension.  On the other hand, it is shown to be that towards which every self-absorbed or driven man and woman is ultimately destined, and as their only possible means of redemption from all of the stupid and insensitive things they do, and from the ambitions that lead only to loneliness and isolation.  These days, Hollywood filmmakers don't usually go as far as ending in a church or to the ringing of wedding bells, but they clearly depict the idea that a woman is incomplete without her man (and vice-versa).  Knocked up takes the formula -- of trashing marriage and family only to later reaffirm its legitimacy and importance -- to the extreme.Ben is an extreme slacker (who has absolutely no internal censor telling him which thoughts to speak out loud and which to keep to himself), an illegal alien from Canada, who has no real job and spends his days goofing off with his buddies, smoking pot and creating a celebrity nudity website (an idea that, unfortunately for him, has already been taken).  Alison is an up and coming assistant and soon-to-be reporter for E! Entertainment, who is living with her sister and brother-in-law.  She goes out to celebrate her promotion, gets drunk and meets him, and nature takes its course.  It takes about five minutes for her to decide to keep the baby and for him to decide he likes that idea -- and all of a sudden this totally mismatched pair is trying to make a relationship work for the sake of the baby.  The filmmakers try to make plausible this match between a go-getter highly driven reporter and this lovable loser by establishing a heavy handed comparison with Alison's brother-in-law.  The only difference between the successful in-law and the pothead Ben, really, is that the in-law has a better job and a bit of money and a greater ability to keep his bad habits hidden from his wife.  I guess what Ben has going for him is a complete and utter lack of shame (that passes for a kind of admirable and sweet honesty).Needless to say, Ben will prove himself worthy of fatherhood -- by reading a few parenting books and inexplicably getting a nice job and an apartment and a nursery full of cool stuff purchased on credit (which is really strange since he's an illegal alien who hasn't had any prior credit and only just got a job).  I don't think that gives the plot away because it was virtually guaranteed from the beginning.  The message: underneath every socially irresponsible and foul-mouthed pothead prankster (with a heart of gold) is a good father just waiting to emerge -- that is, as long as he's white and middle-classed and able to get a great job and lots of credit without much trouble on his own part.Is it funny?  Yes, I guess, every once in a while -- but most of the humor is of the ""I can't believe someone would actually say that"" sort that elicits uncomfortable chuckles.  The film would be considerably shortened if they just cut out the endless and repeated and usage without any real significance of a certain word that begins with the letter f.  Actually the humor in many instances reminded me most of the style of humor you get in a John Waters film -- but there John Waters uses discomfort as a way to tease the audience about their commitment to conventions of sexuality and expectations of middle class marital bliss that he finds either boring or crass.  Here, the discomfort ultimately finds its outlet and release in a reaffirmation of the institutions and conventions that the characters treat lightly in their words and actions.",2,Underneath every socially irresponsible prankster is a good father just waiting for his chance to emerge,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,3705,"['Hollywood', 'films', 'have', 'peculiar', 'relationship', 'institution', 'marriage', 'one', 'hand', 'depicted', 'lifeless', 'loveless', 'inherent', 'interest', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'other', 'hand', 'shown', 'be', 'towards', 'self-absorbed', 'driven', 'man', 'woman', 'ultimately', 'destined', 'only', 'possible', 'means', 'redemption', 'stupid', 'insensitive', 'things', 'do', 'ambitions', 'lead', 'only', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'ending', 'church', 'ringing', 'wedding', 'bells', 'clearly', 'depict', 'idea', 'woman', 'incomplete', 'man', 'vice-versa', 'Knocked', 'up', 'formula', 'trashing', 'marriage', 'family', 'only', 'later', 'reaffirm', 'legitimacy', 'importance', 'extreme.Ben', 'extreme', 'slacker', 'who', 'absolutely', 'internal', 'censor', 'telling', 'thoughts', 'speak', 'out', 'loud', 'keep', 'illegal', 'alien', 'Canada', 'who', 'real', 'job', 'days', 'goofing', 'off', 'buddies', 'smoking', 'pot', 'creating', 'celebrity', 'nudity', 'website', 'idea', 'unfortunately', 'already', 'been', 'taken', 'Alison', 'up', 'coming', 'assistant', 'soon-to-be', 'reporter', 'E', 'Entertainment', 'who', 'living', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'out', 'celebrate', 'promotion', 'drunk', 'nature', 'course', 'five', 'minutes', 'decide', 'keep', 'baby', 'decide', 'idea', 'sudden', 'totally', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'trying', 'make', 'relationship', 'work', 'sake', 'baby', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'make', 'plausible', 'match', 'go-getter', 'highly', 'driven', 'reporter', 'lovable', 'loser', 'establishing', 'heavy', 'handed', 'comparison', 'Alison', 'brother-in-law', 'only', 'difference', 'successful', 'in-law', 'pothead', 'Ben', 'really', 'in-law', 'better', 'job', 'bit', 'money', 'greater', 'ability', 'keep', 'bad', 'habits', 'hidden', 'wife', 'guess', 'what', 'Ben', 'going', 'complete', 'utter', 'lack', 'shame', 'kind', 'admirable', 'sweet', 'honesty', '.Needless', 'say', 'Ben', 'will', 'prove', 'worthy', 'fatherhood', 'reading', 'few', 'parenting', 'books', 'inexplicably', 'getting', 'nice', 'job', 'apartment', 'nursery', 'full', 'cool', 'stuff', 'purchased', 'credit', 'really', 'strange', 'illegal', 'alien', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'prior', 'credit', 'only', 'just', 'got', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'plot', 'away', 'was', 'virtually', 'guaranteed', 'beginning', 'message', 'underneath', 'socially', 'irresponsible', 'foul-mouthed', 'pothead', 'prankster', 'heart', 'gold', 'good', 'father', 'just', 'waiting', 'emerge', 'as', 'long', 'white', 'middle-classed', 'able', 'get', 'great', 'job', 'lots', 'credit', 'much', 'trouble', 'own', 'part.Is', 'funny', 'Yes', 'guess', 'once', 'while', 'most', 'humor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'would', 'actually', 'say', 'sort', 'uncomfortable', 'chuckles', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'considerably', 'shortened', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'endless', 'repeated', 'usage', 'real', 'significance', 'certain', 'word', 'letter', 'f.', 'Actually', 'humor', 'many', 'instances', 'reminded', 'most', 'style', 'humor', 'get', 'John', 'Waters', 'film', 'John', 'Waters', 'discomfort', 'way', 'tease', 'audience', 'commitment', 'conventions', 'sexuality', 'expectations', 'middle', 'class', 'marital', 'bliss', 'boring', 'crass', 'Here', 'discomfort', 'ultimately', 'outlet', 'release', 'reaffirmation', 'institutions', 'conventions', 'characters', 'treat', 'lightly', 'words', 'actions']",Knocked Up

Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 9]","Judd Apatow's Knocked Up seems like a comedy that couldn't work on paper, but the way the film starts out you may be thinking differently.  For a good amount of time, Knocked Up is a vulgarly funny comedy that finds Seth Rogen and hottie Katherine Heigl as mis-matched mates whose one night stand escalates into said pregnancy.  From that point forward though, Apatow tries way too hard to get into the character's heads, and towards the end of the film, throws one non-sensical leap of logic at you right after the other.  There are some highpoints here though, most notably with the supporting cast.  Rogen, in his first starring role, is decent enough, but the best moments definitely go to Paul Rudd as the jaded husband of Heigl's sister (Leslie Mann).  Harold Ramis is on board as well as Rogen's father, who it's always good to see on screen, even if it's all too brief.

The director (Judd Apatow) seems unable to decide if he wanted to write a chick flick or a fun-to-quote, man-friendly comedy.  Faced with a decision, Apatow has slammed together Beerfest and Pretty Woman, and the result isn't nearly as successful as his similarly constructed film, The 40 Year Old Virgin.Most of the problem has to do with the film's editing.  I did not see the theatrical release, but the unrated version is overly long, bloated, and some of the editing decisions were quite poor (some of the ""deleted scenes"" would have enhanced the movie, for example).  Because the film is largely improvised, there's an amateurish quality to much of the dialogue.  It's not quite random, but it is rambling and at times nonsensical, irrelevant, and worse, not funny.But there are some redeeming qualities to the film.  Even though they are uneven and sound forced, some of the ""serious"" discussions about relationships and responsibility are actually quite good and heartfelt.  It's too bad that the spell of sentiment will then be broken by a fart joke or a random act of cruelty.  Also, the problems that couples have in the film do seem real, which is rare in comedies.  However, the resolutions to those problems aren't particularly believable given what the audience knows about the characters in the film.I think Knocked Up would have worked better as a dark comedy.  The problem with that is, no one would want to see it.  It would be too depressing and mean, which is funny to me and perhaps a few others, but not the date-movie masses.Knocked Up is a decent rental, but I don't recommend buying it.  Try to avoid the unrated version unless you enjoy redundancy.  I wish I had sought out the theatrical release.  There are a few good laughs from time to time, but like so many movies lately, you've seen it before, and it was better the first time.",3,Review of the unrated version,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1998,"['are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'most', 'movie', 'thin', 'obvious', 'plot', 'pulled', 'apart', 'conflicting', 'tones', 'director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'unable', 'decide', 'wanted', 'write', 'chick', 'flick', 'fun-to-quote', 'man-friendly', 'comedy', 'Faced', 'decision', 'Apatow', 'slammed', 'together', 'Beerfest', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'result', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'successful', 'similarly', 'constructed', 'film', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin.Most', 'problem', 'do', 'film', 'editing', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'theatrical', 'release', 'unrated', 'version', 'overly', 'long', 'bloated', 'editing', 'decisions', 'were', 'quite', 'poor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'movie', 'example', 'film', 'largely', 'improvised', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'much', 'dialogue', 'not', 'quite', 'random', 'rambling', 'times', 'nonsensical', 'irrelevant', 'worse', 'not', 'funny.But', 'are', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'Even', 'are', 'uneven', 'sound', 'forced', 'serious', 'discussions', 'relationships', 'responsibility', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'heartfelt', 'too', 'bad', 'spell', 'sentiment', 'will', 'then', 'be', 'broken', 'fart', 'joke', 'random', 'act', 'cruelty', 'Also', 'problems', 'couples', 'have', 'film', 'do', 'seem', 'real', 'rare', 'comedies', 'However', 'resolutions', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'believable', 'given', 'what', 'audience', 'characters', 'film.I', 'think', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'dark', 'comedy', 'problem', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'depressing', 'mean', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'few', 'others', 'not', 'date-movie', 'masses.Knocked', 'Up', 'decent', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'Try', 'avoid', 'unrated', 'version', 'enjoy', 'redundancy', 'wish', 'had', 'sought', 'out', 'theatrical', 'release', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'time', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'time']",Knocked Up

From there, a hilarious sequence of hijinks ensues as the couple deals with the situation and tries to adjust to the soon-to-be new addition in their lives.

A pleasant surprise to be sure, I had very low expectations from the flick just based on the lame title.  Gald I was wrong.  Seth Rogen is very funny and leads a life I can only envy.  While an outlined description of the plot would make one cringe, the execution is excellent.  I usually detest movies that lack proper editing to keep them at ninety minutes or less, but funny writing, good acting, and adequate production quality make for an entertaining 129 minutes on this one.  I say the only real flaw is a few of the scenes drag a bit and the set-up suggesting that a good looking chick like Katherine Heigl would actually EVER sleep with a guy that looks like Seth Rogen, let alone have a kid with him is utterly absurd.

1092922,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000TZJBP6,Roland E. Zwick,"[13, 25]","Like many romantic comedies these days, ""Knocked Up"" can seem a bit schizophrenic at times, straddling a fine line between salty language, sexual innuendo and crude sight gags on the one hand, and a foursquare endorsement of monogamy and marriage on the other.  The standard formula for such films is that the characters are allowed to be as promiscuous as they want to be in the early stages of the drama provided they see the error of their ways and settle into responsible domestic conformity by the time the closing credits come rolling by.""Knocked Up"" goes a step further than most films in this genre by turning this theme - which is usually more implied than stated - into the very cornerstone of the movie itself.  Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a socially backward, unemployed, loser stoner who has a drunken one-night-stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful, up-and-coming reporter for the E Channel.  When, in the stone-cold sober light of early morning, Alison sees who exactly it was she had sex with the night before, she essentially brushes Ben off, never expecting to really have to deal with him ever again.  Fate, however, has other plans, as she soon discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby.  Will Ben do the right thing by giving up his nerdish bachelor ways to marry Alison and be a true father to his child?  Will Alison overcome her initial repulsion to discover the true Ben and start a family with him? Even though the answers to those questions are never much in doubt given the nature of the genre, the movie has a great deal of fun getting to those answers..This is writer/director Judd Apatow's highly anticipated follow-up to the wildly popular ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" a film that most people seemed to enjoy more than I did.  For despite some fine performances and some very funny moments, ""Virgin"" often seemed weighed down by both the implausibility of its premise and its dogmatic adherence to the overused ""Pygmalion"" formula.  Luckily, ""Knocked Up"" starts right off the bat with a more believable and compelling premise, which allows the audience to more clearly identify with the characters and their situations.  What separates ""Knocked Up"" from so many other generic romantic comedies is that Apatow has a sharp ear for the way people in the real world actually speak.  The lines are not only incisive, witty and sophisticated, but they are also what we would expect to hear coming out of the mouths of individuals caught in their particular situations.  He makes us laugh at all the foolishness, foibles and insecurities we ourselves are prone to as we cope with the often maddening complexities of human relationships.  Apatow also has a rare gift for making even the secondary characters compelling and interesting.  Thus, even though Ben and Alison are the primary focus of the movie, Alison's uptight sister, Debbie, and her beaten-down husband, Pete, are fully fleshed-out figures as well.  And even though Ben's loser roommates come across as fairly stereotypical zonked-out geeks and nerds, at least they are given some very funny one-liners to deliver as commentary on the main action.However, all is not mere fun-and-games in this film.  Some of the fight scenes, for instance, are surprisingly raw and cutting in their no-holds-barred brutality and frankness, and many in the audience may find themselves squirming uncomfortably in recognition of things that they themselves have said or done in the heat of anger.  On a more upbeat note, Apatow also has a knack for inserting up-to-the-minute pop culture and movie references into the dialogue without making it feel desperate or forced.  This gives the movie an enjoyably  contemporary, ""with-it"" quality - although one wonders how far that may go towards limiting the shelf life of the movie in the long run, and how dated it may appear to audiences catching it on some cable station a decade or two from now.Apatow is also to be commended for building his romantic comedy around a less-than-hunky male lead (although he doesn't have the nerve to go for a Plain Jane equivalent for  the distaff side of the equation).  It also helps that Rogen and Heigl are so utterly endearing in the roles of Ben and Alison, and that they receive such fine support from the likes of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and many others, including a handful of recognizable celebrities who make cameo appearances playing themselves.It's true that the movie runs out of steam a bit along the way and overstays its welcome by about a half hour or so, but given its broad canvas, ""Knocked Up"" feels more expansive, comprehensive and fully baked than your average cookie-cutter romantic comedy.  It's a great deal more fun as well.",4,perceptive romantic comedy,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,4720,"['many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'days', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'schizophrenic', 'times', 'straddling', 'fine', 'line', 'salty', 'language', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'crude', 'sight', 'gags', 'one', 'hand', 'foursquare', 'endorsement', 'monogamy', 'marriage', 'other', 'standard', 'formula', 'such', 'films', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'as', 'promiscuous', 'want', 'be', 'early', 'stages', 'drama', 'provided', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'settle', 'responsible', 'domestic', 'conformity', 'time', 'closing', 'come', 'rolling', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'step', 'further', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'turning', 'theme', 'usually', 'more', 'implied', 'stated', 'very', 'cornerstone', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'socially', 'backward', 'unemployed', 'loser', 'stoner', 'who', 'drunken', 'one-night-stand', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'beautiful', 'up-and-coming', 'reporter', 'E', 'Channel', 'When', 'stone-cold', 'sober', 'light', 'early', 'morning', 'Alison', 'who', 'exactly', 'was', 'had', 'sex', 'night', 'essentially', 'Ben', 'off', 'never', 'expecting', 'really', 'have', 'deal', 'ever', 'again', 'Fate', 'however', 'other', 'plans', 'soon', 'discovers', 'pregnant', 'Ben', 'baby', 'Will', 'Ben', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'giving', 'up', 'nerdish', 'bachelor', 'ways', 'marry', 'Alison', 'be', 'true', 'father', 'child', 'Will', 'Alison', 'overcome', 'initial', 'repulsion', 'discover', 'true', 'Ben', 'start', 'family', 'Even', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'much', 'doubt', 'given', 'nature', 'genre', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'getting', 'answers..This', 'writer/director', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'follow-up', 'wildly', 'popular', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', 'fine', 'performances', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'Virgin', 'often', 'seemed', 'weighed', 'down', 'implausibility', 'premise', 'dogmatic', 'adherence', 'overused', 'Pygmalion', 'formula', 'Luckily', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'starts', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'more', 'believable', 'compelling', 'premise', 'audience', 'more', 'clearly', 'identify', 'characters', 'situations', 'What', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'generic', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Apatow', 'sharp', 'ear', 'way', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'speak', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'incisive', 'witty', 'sophisticated', 'are', 'also', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'coming', 'mouths', 'individuals', 'caught', 'particular', 'situations', 'laugh', 'foolishness', 'foibles', 'insecurities', 'ourselves', 'are', 'prone', 'cope', 'often', 'maddening', 'complexities', 'human', 'relationships', 'Apatow', 'also', 'rare', 'gift', 'making', 'even', 'secondary', 'characters', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'Thus', 'even', 'Ben', 'Alison', 'are', 'primary', 'focus', 'movie', 'Alison', 'uptight', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'beaten-down', 'husband', 'Pete', 'are', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'figures', 'well', 'even', 'Ben', 'loser', 'come', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'zonked-out', 'geeks', 'nerds', 'least', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'deliver', 'commentary', 'main', 'action.However', 'not', 'mere', 'fun-and-games', 'film', 'fight', 'scenes', 'instance', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'raw', 'cutting', 'no-holds-barred', 'brutality', 'frankness', 'many', 'audience', 'may', 'find', 'squirming', 'uncomfortably', 'recognition', 'things', 'have', 'said', 'done', 'heat', 'anger', 'more', 'upbeat', 'note', 'Apatow', 'also', 'knack', 'inserting', 'up-to-the-minute', 'pop', 'culture', 'movie', 'references', 'dialogue', 'making', 'feel', 'desperate', 'forced', 'movie', 'enjoyably', 'contemporary', 'with-it', 'quality', 'one', 'how', 'far', 'may', 'go', 'towards', 'limiting', 'shelf', 'life', 'movie', 'long', 'run', 'how', 'dated', 'may', 'appear', 'audiences', 'catching', 'cable', 'station', 'decade', 'two', 'now.Apatow', 'also', 'be', 'commended', 'building', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'less-than-hunky', 'male', 'lead', ""n't"", 'have', 'nerve', 'go', 'Plain', 'Jane', 'equivalent', 'distaff', 'side', 'equation', 'also', 'Rogen', 'Heigl', 'are', 'so', 'utterly', 'endearing', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Alison', 'receive', 'such', 'fine', 'support', 'likes', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'handful', 'recognizable', 'celebrities', 'who', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'playing', 'themselves.It', 'true', 'movie', 'steam', 'bit', 'way', 'welcome', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'given', 'broad', 'canvas', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'feels', 'more', 'expansive', 'comprehensive', 'fully', 'baked', 'average', 'cookie-cutter', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'fun', 'as', 'well']",Knocked Up

Reactions are unfavorable all around, but both decide they want to keep the child. Over the two and a half hour span of the film, they manage to fight, make up, break up, and change each others' lives forever. Such a serious subject needs major comedy to lighten the mood, and that is just what we get.This situation is probably more common than most people realize. Neither of these characters are made to be exceptions to the rule, and both are believably normal. Perhaps some of the comedy comes from its truth.The cast is outstanding. At every corner there is a familiar face from four former Freaks and Geeks co-stars (Rogan, Martin Starr, Jason Segel and James Franco) to well-known comics (Mo Collins and Steve Carell) and veteran actors (Paul Feig, Leslie Mann and Joanna Kerns).There are two kinds of people who will watch this film, people who love it and people who hate it. The comedy is immature, often vulgar, and off the wall. There are plenty of drug references, a few scenes with nudity, and tons of sexual references.

Its not as funny as I hoped and in fact was downright boring at times.  And who believes that a beautiful, smart women like Katherine Heigl would have sex with a lazy, broke, fat slob like Seth Rogen?  This is a male fantasy, but the story has chick flick written all over it.  HD DVD picture quality is OK, but not great.The following illustrates the problem with high def formats in general.  I rented my copy and it was scratched.  It played OK except for some minor periodic skipping until it finally froze.  This was after I had cleaned it twice and is a problem I encounter frequently with rented HD DVD's.  They seem much more susceptible to scratching or else the player is less able to recover from data transfer errors.  Either way its annoying and makes me leery of renting.  So I flip it over and finish watching the standard def version and guess what?  It didn't look much worse.  It was a bit more blurry and the colors more muted, but I doubt my wife would have noticed and we were watching on a 1080p projector with a 106 inch diagonal screen.

Knocked Up's premise--if you can call it that, which you cannot since it's more like a relentless running gag of p*rversity loaded with excess immaturity--is that a couple of liberal, young adults artificially coerce one another into a relationship after she gets pregnant in their heartless and thoughtless one-night stand, a one-night stand which refuses to take into consideration that sex is primarily for procreation, not hedonism.Again, you can tell that liberals had their reactionary, little paws all over the script of this obscene film because it encourages sex out of lust and drunkenness, premarital sex, viewing babies as the mere, annoying side-effect of copulation, and birthing b*stard kids. The concern here is, obviously, unless you have no moral integrity to speak of, that young people and teens will be disadvantageously influenced to copy this misbehavior in real life because they misguidedly think how ""cool"" it was depicted on screen. Declining marriage rates and out-of-wedlock births are no laughing matter as the US government in 2006--as part of its census figures--reported that the rate of out-of-wedlock births was around 40%!!!! This film callously spits in the eye of said b*stard kids who are growing up without either Mommy or Daddy in their lives.This is an R-rated movie, so right there one knows how infectious most of its material-fronting-as-humor will be; the tragedy with many R-rated movies is that they're marketed to teens who aren't allowed to see the sm*t-movie under the ratings system. If there are ANY parents (not in their right mind) out there reading this who have the nerve to permit their teens to see this showcase of lewdness and lowness, I'm going to shame you into reversing your decision by citing all the ethical breaches Knocked-Up perpetrates.In order to determine whether a movie will have content in it which will degrade my character--impurity like excessive sex, violence, swearing, drug use, etc..--I consult the parent-friendly website called Screen It, which lists moral affronts in movies to determine their admissibility for young people. Knocked-Up fails on all counts!!!!For instance, remember the depraved scene-disguised-as-humor when we see Ben's pimply rear end after he and Allison ""got busy?"" Kids and teens don't need to see the obese, hairy rears of fat guys like Seth Rogan, and this is after the enormously suggestive scene immediately preceding it. To show the depraved one-night stand, the liberal writers gloatingly and asininely showed Ben and Allison rushing to copulation without putting on condoms!!!! The ethical affronts aside, this movie glorifies dangerous sexual malpractice in this day and age of rampant STDs.Or how about the infamous scene indulging in the foulest of unsanitary ""jokes"": the scene when Ben and his lib-buddies get an e-mail from Allison demanding to talk to him, one of his lib-buddies blurts that Allison liked the way Ben's you-know-what tasted. Not happy with this profaning of the storyline via suggestiveness, the writers ensure the sm*t is imposed on everyone watching when Ben takes Jason's head and does mock oral sex thrusting on it!!!!Not content with offending societal mores with immoderate ""jokes"" (read: obscenities) about sex, Knocked-Up's also got lots of toxic examples of poisonous incivility. Some infamous examples are: when Debbie and Allison aren't allowed into a club by the doorman, they demean him as a fu**ing, little fa**t (so much for the lie that libs are tolerant of g*ys); the misjudging, liberal writers assumed it'd be funny to jeer at people in wheelchairs who suffer from Lou Gherig's disease, as when Jay imitates a synthesized voice in a wheelchair in the hospital; and one of Ben's lib-buddies advises that Allison should get a murderous abortion (sm-smorshin in the lib movie's ""cool"" lingo!), which even ends in a child-sodomizing ""joke!!!!""After all these cultural, ethical and societal trespasses, I cannot think of any parent who wants their teen to see this pollution disguised as a movie--unless, of course, the parent is liberal and not into drawing moral boundaries. Additionally, even if you're an adult, you should spare yourself from enduring this indecency imitating entertainment because it will harden you to values in life and lower your principles. The falsehood the apologists of this film use--that it's ""only"" entertainment--isn't defensible if you become degraded as a result of watching this coarse film.To recap, my review utterly confirms that Knocked Up is 100% a raw excuse for entertainment which ridicules invalids, healthy sexual relationships, matrimony, fidelity and basic civility. Thanks to all the moral relativists who patronize this filth, it can also conceal all these societal breaches by falsifying it's only a comedy. Teens are urged to embargo this film, and immature adults are also urged to do something more productive with their time.",1,"Knocked Up is the Euphemism for getting pregnant, but what's the Euphemism

Well at least they want you tom think this is a coup for Rogan, but as Token Hot Chicks go, Heigl is up there in the overrated category, along with Megan Fox in recent memory. But much like a Chicago Bears quarterback, she isn't there to win the game just not to lose it which she does for the most part (she have more that a few deer caught in the headlight look as some of them ad-lib which you can find in some of the deleted/extended scenes).Instead Apatow regulars handle the brunt of the comedy load. Hill, Rogan and Rudd are on fire throughout the movie, which is pretty much the Dances with Wolves of comedies with a two plus hour running time (not to mention an extra hour of those deleted and extended scenes and three hours of features), but thanks to those three it rarely seems that long. Rogan and Rudd don't have an exchange as funny as their improve ""You know how I know you're gay"" routine from The 40 Year Old Virgin but Hill comes close as he explains why Brokeback Mountain is a horrible movie in a deleted scene while Heigl looks on with a why did I sign up for this movie look on her face.",4,"If Any of Us Get Some Tonight, it's Because of Eric Bana in Munich",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1754,"['Knocked', 'Up', 'next', 'string', 'hit', 'movies', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'true', 'Apatow', 'style', 'film', 'full', 'actors', 'previously', 'worked', 'prematurely', 'canceled', 'shows', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'James', 'Franco', 'cameo', 'Undeclared', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'as', 'well', 'break', 'out', 'hit', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Lesie', 'Mann', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'cameo', '.Rogan', 'fourth', 'outing', 'Apatow', 'promoted', 'leading', 'man', 'time', 'around', 'DNA', 'lottery', 'when', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'My', 'Father', 'Hero', 'Well', 'least', 'want', 'tom', 'think', 'coup', 'Rogan', 'Token', 'Hot', 'Chicks', 'go', 'Heigl', 'up', 'there', 'overrated', 'category', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'recent', 'memory', 'much', 'Chicago', 'Bears', 'quarterback', ""n't"", 'there', 'win', 'game', 'just', 'not', 'lose', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'more', 'few', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlight', 'look', 'ad-lib', 'can', 'find', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', '.Instead', 'Apatow', 'regulars', 'handle', 'brunt', 'comedy', 'load', 'Hill', 'Rogan', 'Rudd', 'are', 'fire', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'comedies', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'not', 'mention', 'extra', 'hour', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'three', 'hours', 'features', 'thanks', 'three', 'rarely', 'long', 'Rogan', 'Rudd', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'exchange', 'as', 'funny', 'improve', 'know', 'how', 'know', ""'re"", 'gay', 'routine', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Hill', 'close', 'why', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'horrible', 'movie', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Heigl', 'why', 'did', 'sign', 'up', 'movie', 'look', 'face']",Knocked Up

He has tapped into the zeitgeist of guy-dom with fresh comedies that are as identifiable by their sly humor as they are by their lingering pace.  ""Knocked Up,"" like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" takes its time.Seth Rogan, whose lovable, bemused mug personifies the picture, plays Ben Stone.  Ben is a slacker - a Canadian who has moved to the states to make some easy money (but without a plan), surviving on the $14K he got in an accident settlement.  Ben hangs with a worthy batch of slackers who are convinced they can make it big by developing a website cataloging nudity in mainstream films - although it's somewhat surprising nobody has heard of Mr. Skin.  It's a given that these guys are lovable and hilarious, not to mention perpetually stoned.Katherine Heigl has the other key lead as Alison Scott.  She celebrates her big break - getting a chance to ""anchor"" the ""news"" on the E Channel - by clubbing with her obnoxious married big sister Debbie (Leslie Mann).  Alison beer-goggles her way into Ben's bed, and a miscommunication later, she's got morning sickness on camera.When Alison decides to keep the baby and also have Ben involved, the plot is more or less set - can these two misfits make a family?  While this may be the most overdone plot device in modern TV and movies, ""Knocked Up"" handles it with maturity and hilarity.  Ben has to grow up and realize he's worthy of a dream-girl, and Alison has to come to terms with her new career trajectory and a life with Ben.Look for great laughs and some real emotion here, particularly as Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) go through their own version of the seven-year itch.This ain't a great comedy - it's probably too long and a couple of issues could have been ironed out a little neater.  But as long as you don't let yourself get distracted by the pro-choice/pro-life politics some have injected into this film, you're going to have a great time with this movie.",4,"Apatow hits another dinger with sweet, semi-serious ""KU""",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2028,"['Judd', 'Apatow', 'become', 'today', 'slackers', 'what', 'John', 'Hughes', 'was', 'teenagers', 'mid-80s', 'tapped', 'zeitgeist', 'guy-dom', 'fresh', 'comedies', 'are', 'identifiable', 'sly', 'humor', 'are', 'lingering', 'pace', 'Knocked', 'Up', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'time.Seth', 'Rogan', 'lovable', 'bemused', 'mug', 'personifies', 'picture', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Ben', 'slacker', 'Canadian', 'who', 'moved', 'states', 'make', 'easy', 'money', 'plan', 'surviving', '14K', 'got', 'accident', 'settlement', 'Ben', 'worthy', 'batch', 'slackers', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'can', 'make', 'big', 'developing', 'website', 'cataloging', 'nudity', 'mainstream', 'films', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'nobody', 'heard', 'Mr', 'Skin', 'given', 'guys', 'are', 'lovable', 'hilarious', 'not', 'mention', 'perpetually', 'stoned.Katherine', 'Heigl', 'other', 'key', 'lead', 'Alison', 'Scott', 'big', 'break', 'getting', 'chance', 'anchor', 'news', 'E', 'Channel', 'clubbing', 'obnoxious', 'married', 'big', 'sister', 'Debbie', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Alison', 'way', 'Ben', 'bed', 'miscommunication', 'later', 'got', 'morning', 'sickness', 'camera.When', 'Alison', 'keep', 'baby', 'also', 'have', 'Ben', 'involved', 'plot', 'more', 'less', 'set', 'can', 'two', 'misfits', 'make', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'overdone', 'plot', 'device', 'modern', 'TV', 'movies', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'maturity', 'hilarity', 'Ben', 'grow', 'up', 'realize', 'worthy', 'dream-girl', 'Alison', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'career', 'trajectory', 'life', 'Ben.Look', 'great', 'laughs', 'real', 'emotion', 'here', 'particularly', 'Debbie', 'husband', 'Pete', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'go', 'own', 'version', 'seven-year', 'itch.This', 'ai', ""n't"", 'great', 'comedy', 'probably', 'too', 'long', 'couple', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ironed', 'out', 'little', 'neater', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'distracted', 'pro-choice/pro-life', 'politics', 'have', 'injected', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'movie']",Knocked Up

What could have easily been a dumb, forgettable, raunchy sex-comedy turns out to be a smart, memorable, raunchy sex/romantic comedy. It's a well balanced high wire act of potty mouthed humor mixed with sweet and sensitive elements that is pulled off brilliantly by the writing and direction of Mr. Judd Apatow as well as the acting from actors like Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and the under appreciated Leslie Mann (not to exclude the supporting roles from Jonah Hill, Jason Sigel, and a few other ""Freaks and Geeks""/""Undeclared"" alumni).""Knocked Up"" is a pretty simple story: a likable under achiever/slacker/stoner/unemployed goofball has a lucky one night stand with a gorgeous woman who was drunk from celebrating a promotion she earned at work. The couple's one hot night turns out to be a nine month ""getting to know you and your friends"" bit before the baby pops out. Of course there are moments where the boy must grow up, mature if you will, which is truely what the film is all about. The running time is 129 minutes which may be a little too long for some but honestly, I hardly noticed it and I've seen this in theaters twice! From start to finish Apatow pulls the audience in with his great sense of humor and scene after scene the laughs keep rolling in til the end just as fresh as it was in the begining.Though ""Knocked Up"" is pretty fowl mouthed, (the ""F"" word is thrown around a lot as well as a whole avalanche of various naughty words) the film has the amazing ability to become extremely sensitive and even sweet.

The humor started off really goofy, and I didn't crack a smile. However, as soon as these guys hit up the bar and Ben taps Allison, the movie takes off into a whirlwind of vulgar, senseless jokes that had me dying laughing. There were so many times that I wanted to write down quotes just to laugh at them again. I rewound a bunch of scenes, specifically those two trying to have sex while she was pregnant. I have never seen a sex scene that made me cry laughing. The couple's night out when Ben told the other guy that he was cute and they started on this uncalled for conversation about hooking up made me roll over laughing. I'm sure most people will think this movie only appeals to teenage boys, but I'm a grown woman and loved every single moment of it. The humor is sarcastic and vulgar, the movie's plot isn't so creative, but the dialogue, the actors, and the comedy are classic. I, too, think after birth looks like cream of wheat, and I'm completely grossed out by the idea of mothers kissing their new babies in that old gross pile of ugh. I loved the guy characters!  They didn't back down from the ladies, they were brutally honest, what would be considered ""men's men,"" but they also didn't mistreat the women they loved. You have to have an open mind, a quirky sense of humor, and not be too queasy in order to enjoy this movie (although that birth scene was completely uncalled for, and I'm messed up for life after seeing that). Great movie!By the way, I loved seeing some of the cast of ""The Office"" on here, specifically the bodyguard who talked about old women and pregnant women. I like that actor so much.

Each episode is a half hour long, Larry David tries to out-do himself in every episode with how grossly inappropriate he can be, and viewers get a lot of laughs from watching the cast fight with each other. This formula works great for Curb Your Enthusiasm, and it's a very funny show once your expectations are set for its style.Knocked Up uses the same model: Seth Rogen gets most of the laughs with inappropriateness, and watching the cast argue with each other supplies a few chuckles. However, 2 hours of this story got stale unlike the weekly half hour blasts of Curb Your Enthusiasm that seem to retain freshness with each episode.Knocked Up is about a Hollywood loser that hooks up with an everything-going-for her, up and coming TV host...and gets her preg...er...um...knocked up. A lot of the dialogue is reminiscent of Curb Your Enthusiasm-like dialogue. In fact, their mannerisms are so familiar that Seth Rogan could be the separated-at-birth son of Larry David's Co-star Jeff Garlin.Anyway, Knocked Up had its funny moments, but I think that the final word on this movie is that it was a chick-flick that most chicks will find inappropriate.Stick with the half hour doses of Curb Your Enthusiasm and catch Knocked Up when it comes on cable.",3,Son of Curb Your Enthusiasm,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,1404,"['Have', 'ever', 'seenCurb', 'Enthusiasm', 'Basically', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'spoof', 'life', 'ofSeinfeldcreator', 'Larry', 'David', '6th', 'season', 'HBO', 'episode', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'Larry', 'David', 'out-do', 'episode', 'how', 'grossly', 'inappropriate', 'can', 'be', 'viewers', 'get', 'lot', 'laughs', 'watching', 'cast', 'fight', 'other', 'formula', 'great', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'once', 'expectations', 'are', 'set', 'style.Knocked', 'Up', 'same', 'model', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'most', 'laughs', 'inappropriateness', 'watching', 'cast', 'argue', 'other', 'supplies', 'few', 'chuckles', 'However', '2', 'hours', 'story', 'got', 'stale', 'weekly', 'half', 'hour', 'blasts', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'seem', 'retain', 'freshness', 'episode.Knocked', 'Up', 'Hollywood', 'loser', 'up', 'everything-going-for', 'her', 'up', 'coming', 'TV', 'host', 'preg', 'er', 'um', 'knocked', 'up', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'reminiscent', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm-like', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'could', 'be', 'separated-at-birth', 'son', 'Larry', 'David', 'Co-star', 'Jeff', 'Garlin.Anyway', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'think', 'final', 'word', 'movie', 'was', 'chick-flick', 'most', 'chicks', 'will', 'find', 'inappropriate.Stick', 'half', 'hour', 'doses', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'catch', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'when', 'cable']",Knocked Up

1092943,A30A5I8FG82M2E,B000TZJBP6,SpookyChick,"[1, 2]","I know, I know - how does a God-fearing Christian woman (to whom the years are admittedly beginning to catch up) give a favorable, four-star review to a pro-drug movie like ""Knocked Up""?  I'll tell you the obvious answer:  it's one of the few mainstream pro-life movies to come out of Hollywood in a long while.  The movie has a clear message: own up to the adult responsibility of becoming pregnant by carrying the little rascal to term.  It may not seem ""convenient"" or financially feasible - but darn it, if you're going to get ""knocked up"" then you should accept the end result.The less obvious answer is that the movie is pretty funny, regardless of whether you agree with it's agenda.  Seth Rogan is such a slob - but he manages to exude just enough charm and wit to (almost) believe a stone-cold beauty like Katherine Heigl would realistically consider spending the rest of her life with him.  They make an absolutely adorable couple.Careful readers of my reviews (thank you and bless you) will note that I had a much lower opinion of the director's previous movie, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".  In retrospect I may have judged that earlier movie too harshly - having seen and appreciate Apatow's Christian message in ""Knocked Up"" I can see more clearly what he was trying to achieve with ""40 Year Old Virgin"".  I thought his ""wait til marriage to consumate a relationship"" message was merely a ruse - an easy way to milk cheap and unwarranted laughs out of someone's lack of intimate experiences.  Now I see that he apparently truly meant it, and for that I have to commend him.  I still think that one had too much stinky humor; ""Knocked Up"" has a more realistic approach to getting laughs.My biggest problem, in the end, with ""Knocked Up"" is it's highly permissive attitude toward the use of illicit drugs.  Can I be frank?  I used to be an entertainment-industry professional, and I was around those kinds of substances ALL THE TIME.  Back in those days, before rehab clinics and treatment programs were all the rage (and in fact, were not all that encouraged even), I didn't believe substance abuse was really a big problem.  Seeing characters like the one played by Mr. Rogan and the roommates he lives with made my soul weep.Kudos must be awarded to Judd Apatow for paving the way towards a better worldview.  This movie is still not what I would call ""church friendly"" - but darned if it wouldn't still be a great flick to watch with spiritual adults after the little ones have scurried off to bed.

Scores of these reviews condemn this movie for being too crass, offensive, etc., as if they were expecting a Billy Wilder romp instead of a movie made in another century. This is the guy who has given us a wealth of movies which all tap extensively if not exclusively into the lowbrow, locker room, sophomoric comedic vein that is ala mode. Why would you think this offering would be any different?That being said, I found it funny. Yes, the plot line is hard to swallow. The hot tv personality finding love with the unemployed, corpulent, stoner loser simply because they had a drunken night of sex is straight Hollywood fantasy. Still, it isn't unrealistic that beautiful women go for less-than-handsome guys; just ask Ric Ocasek or Billy Joel. What I found most appealing is the deadly accuracy of the marriage between Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's characters, the latter playing main character Alison's (Katherine Heigl) sister. The palpable angst that permeates their relationship is very real and very honest, as anyone who has had a failed marriage can attest, especially one built largely upon the arrival of children. Within the jokes about genitalia et al are some astute points about relationships, kids, acceptance, and maturity.As for the jokes, I am on the fifty side of my mid-forties and I still laugh out loud at many of them, as crude as they may be. I work with a largely twenty-something crowd and I have come to realize that there is a generational change in what is funny, what is socially acceptable, what offends, and what passes for a new morality, if you'll pardon the usage of such a dangerous word. All I can recommend to those who don't find this kind of humor their style; don't watch it! We can argue the sociological, cultural, or moral implications of such a change in morays all day and night, but in the end, you either find it funny or you don't. But please spare the rest of us your whining. At this stage in the game, your ""Oh! My virgin ears! I'm so offended"" cries are contrived and disingenuous attempts to stab at the heart of a cultural change that you no longer are a part of. Every generation has its day and yours is past.

1092947,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000TZJBP6,Steven Mason,"[3, 3]","Romance and romantic comedies are my favorite type of movie, and so I'm pretty tolerant of even the mediocre ones. Knocked Up is worse than mediocre.The premise has comic potential: A schmoe of a guy (I mean, an unattractive, immature, profane slob who wants to do drugs all the time, masturbate to porn and never get a job) by pure luck scores a one-night stand with a beautiful, ambitious and successful woman. Well, it's not exactly pure luck that gets them together; they're both drunk out of their minds and don't know what they're doing. Ben - the schmoe - doesn't even remember the fantastic sex he had with Alison - the beautiful woman. Alison at least is smart enough the next morning to limit the damage to a one-night stand, though Ben was hoping for more.And that would be the end except that Alison discovers she is pregnant a couple of months later. What does a beautiful, intelligent, ambitious, and successful woman do? Well, of course, she calls Ben and just about immediately starts planning to spend her life with him, because their kid deserves the chance to have the traditional pair of loving parents. Okay, I can go with that, it's still got some comic potential, and Alison (Katherine Heigl) is nice enough to look at. :-)Ben has no problem hooking up with the beautiful and employed Alison. He's not exactly crazy about being a dad, but hey, a girl like Alison doesn't drop in on your life every day. And Alison isn't stuck up or condescending to Ben at all. She seems perfectly willing to let him continue with his lifestyle of drugs and unemployment. She laughs at all his rude, crude attempts at humor. Much to Ben's delight, she is perfectly willing to initiate plenty of sex with him, and she's not shy about telling him how much she likes it. Every schmoe's fantasy, right?There's more to the story. There's Alison's sister, her husband, and their two kids. They have a pretty dysfunctional marriage, but in the end they love each other in their own volatile way. In one scene with the kids, a little girl tells Ben that she heard her parents call him a prick and she asks what that means. Ben, being the straightforward kind of guy he is, explains that it's a penis. The little girl laughs and repeats the word. I've seen other movies where making little kids say sexual words is intended to be funny. I'm no prude - when it's done well I enjoy crude humor as much as the next schmoe - but I really fail to see what is so funny about profane kids? Was that scene really necessary? It serves to demonstrate the level of the humor in this raunchy film - there is a lot of gratuitous profanity from all of the main characters. And it's the profanity itself that is supposed to be funny. It's not as if the profanity is embedded within the wit and sophistication. Profanity, in and of itself, is funny to some people, but ever since I was a teenager I usually need a little more than that.There's one more aspect to the story - the various ""bromances."" Guys loving to hang out with other guys. The crude humor works best between the guys, maybe because I'm a guy. But I'm also a guy who loves to watch a good romantic comedy, so the parts with the girls has got to be good, too. :-)The movie did shine in a few places, which is why I'm giving it two stars. The scene with the doorman (Craig Robinson) when Alison and her older sister go clubbing featured some absurdly funny humor. There was some great lowbrow humor in the scene where all of Ben's roomies get pink eye. There's sort of a running gag about all the gynecologists. If the entire movie was up to the level of those scenes, I'd give it four stars.If you enjoy comedies that rely on a lot of crudeness and profanity, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're a schmoe who fantasizes about a beautiful girl getting stuck on you, you'll enjoy this movie. If you prefer romantic comedies with wit, warmth, and humor, you might not enjoy this movie.",2,Knocked Out,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,3928,"['Romance', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'favorite', 'type', 'movie', 'so', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'tolerant', 'even', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'worse', 'mediocre.The', 'premise', 'comic', 'potential', 'schmoe', 'guy', 'mean', 'unattractive', 'immature', 'profane', 'slob', 'who', 'do', 'drugs', 'all', 'time', 'masturbate', 'porn', 'never', 'get', 'job', 'pure', 'luck', 'one-night', 'stand', 'beautiful', 'ambitious', 'successful', 'woman', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'pure', 'luck', 'together', ""'re"", 'drunk', 'minds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Ben', 'schmoe', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'fantastic', 'sex', 'had', 'Alison', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Alison', 'least', 'smart', 'enough', 'next', 'morning', 'limit', 'damage', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Ben', 'was', 'hoping', 'more.And', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'Alison', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'What', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'ambitious', 'successful', 'woman', 'do', 'Well', 'course', 'Ben', 'just', 'immediately', 'planning', 'spend', 'life', 'kid', 'chance', 'have', 'traditional', 'pair', 'loving', 'parents', 'Okay', 'can', 'go', 'still', 'got', 'comic', 'potential', 'Alison', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'nice', 'enough', 'look', 'Ben', 'problem', 'hooking', 'up', 'beautiful', 'employed', 'Alison', 'not', 'exactly', 'being', 'dad', 'hey', 'girl', 'Alison', ""n't"", 'drop', 'life', 'day', 'Alison', ""n't"", 'stuck', 'up', 'condescending', 'Ben', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'let', 'continue', 'lifestyle', 'drugs', 'unemployment', 'rude', 'crude', 'attempts', 'humor', 'Much', 'Ben', 'delight', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'initiate', 'plenty', 'sex', 'not', 'shy', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'Every', 'schmoe', 'fantasy', 'right', 'more', 'story', 'Alison', 'sister', 'husband', 'two', 'kids', 'have', 'pretty', 'dysfunctional', 'marriage', 'end', 'love', 'other', 'own', 'volatile', 'way', 'one', 'scene', 'kids', 'little', 'girl', 'tells', 'Ben', 'heard', 'parents', 'call', 'prick', 'what', 'Ben', 'being', 'straightforward', 'kind', 'guy', 'penis', 'little', 'girl', 'laughs', 'word', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'making', 'little', 'kids', 'say', 'sexual', 'words', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', ""'m"", 'prude', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'enjoy', 'crude', 'humor', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'schmoe', 'really', 'fail', 'see', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'profane', 'kids', 'Was', 'scene', 'really', 'necessary', 'demonstrate', 'level', 'humor', 'raunchy', 'film', 'lot', 'gratuitous', 'profanity', 'main', 'characters', 'profanity', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'profanity', 'embedded', 'wit', 'sophistication', 'Profanity', 'funny', 'people', 'ever', 'was', 'teenager', 'usually', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'more', 'aspect', 'story', 'various', 'bromances', 'loving', 'hang', 'out', 'other', 'guys', 'crude', 'humor', 'best', 'guys', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'guy', ""'m"", 'also', 'guy', 'who', 'watch', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'parts', 'girls', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'too', 'movie', 'did', 'shine', 'few', 'places', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'scene', 'doorman', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'when', 'Alison', 'older', 'sister', 'go', 'clubbing', 'featured', 'absurdly', 'funny', 'humor', 'was', 'great', 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'scene', 'where', 'Ben', 'roomies', 'get', 'pink', 'eye', 'sort', 'running', 'gag', 'gynecologists', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'up', 'level', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'stars.If', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'rely', 'lot', 'crudeness', 'profanity', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'re"", 'schmoe', 'who', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'getting', 'stuck', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'prefer', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'wit', 'warmth', 'humor', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Knocked Up

If for any reason the disc won't play on your Xbox 360 player and goes back to the dashboard after several seconds of playing nothing but black, go to the HD player's memory and delete all the content on it and then go back and allow the disc to go through the loading process at the beginning.

1092955,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000TZJBP6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","""Knocked Up"", the new comedy written and directed by Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin, TV's ""Freaks & Geeks""), starring Seth Rogen and Kathryn Heigl (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy""), continues the traditions of the director's previous film; it's really funny. And for many of the same reasons.Ben (Rogen) and his friends are a group of slackers. They sit around all day, getting high, trying to figure out the easiest, fastest way to make enough money to sustain their lifestyle. What do they come up with? A website listing the exact moment stars get naked in their films. Strangely, this pursuit doesn't take up a lot of their time so they sit around and talk, debating the most miniscule things about topics that are the most important thing in the world to them. But to everyone else? They merely shake their heads in disbelief. They make a bet with Martin (Martin Starr) that he can't go a whole year without shaving. If he loses, he pays their rent for a year. If he wins, they pay his rent for a year. They all live together in a ramshackle house, the type of house with an overgrown yard and half filled pool, in one of the neighborhoods surrounding Los Angeles. One night, Seth and Jason (Jason Sigel) go out to a bar with their friends. As they wait in line to get in, two pretty women walk right up and gain access to the club.Allison (Kathryn Heigl) is a young producer at E! Entertainment Television. A hard worker and the celebrities like her, she receives some good news; her boss (Alan Tudyk) wants to put her on camera. To celebrate, she and her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann, wife of director Apatow and the drunk blind date in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""), leave the husband, Pete (Paul Rudd) in charge of watching their kids and head out to the club. They walk up to the front of the line and immediately get in.Debbie (Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) have a weird relationship. They have two kids, and she constantly wonders if he is cheating on her; he has to leave at odd hours to `check out bands' (he works in the music industry) and she suspects he is out to meet girls.At the nightclub, Ben meets Allison and they both get really drunk. The next morning, he wakes up to find they had sex the night before. Eight weeks later, Allison learns she is pregnant.I have merely scratched the surface; ""Knocked Up"" has so much more going on. But I wanted to introduce you to the three sets of characters who occupy this story. It is these characters, their lives, their friendships, their interactions, and their philosophies, which form the heart of the comedy.If we saw a film with just Ben and his friends, we would probably be happy. They sit around and make bets and basically waste time, so they don't have to go out and get a job. Their idea for a website allows them to sit around and watch scenes from other films, concentrating on the ""good parts"". Each of the friends has a relationship with another person that helps to provide an interesting twist to their group dynamic. At one point, we meet a young woman who is apparently the girlfriend of Martin, but she is too stoned to reveal much. At other points, various guys reveal they have other sexual relationships, both committed and experimental, most of which provide additional laughs.When the gang goes to the nightclub, Ben has a moment with Allison where they make a connection. But the moment soon passes and he goes back to talk with Jason who realizes she has her sister with her. Jason offers to run interference. They approach the girls and Jason begins to hit on Debbie, a married woman. He is so persuasive that we get it. And she starts to become a little giddy with the attention.This group is also the most outrageous part of the film. They are damn funny, often making us laugh with some outrageous statement or image. But the brilliance of this film is that this outrageous behavior is offset, and complimented, by two other groups.Kathryn Heigl basically plays the straight woman to Seth Rogen's funny guy. Allison is the more human, emotional center of the story. She isn't very funny, but is a necessary part of the film's success. If everyone were off the wall, ""Knocked Up"" wouldn't work because there would be no basis in reality. She is the key to making the film seem more real.But her own funny people surround her, from her boss and his assistant (Kristen Wiig, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") at E! to her sister and brother-in-law, everyone has a quirky personality, and these help to add depth and interest to an already funny film.Then, the film adds Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, as Allison's sister and brother-in-law. Both were very funny in Apatow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". Here, they are paired and add another level of eccentricity to the film. Rudd is a bit sarcastic, and feels put upon by his responsibilities as a father and husband. Mann has much insecurity and suspects her husband of cheating on her, but she isn't above using the relationship to get what she wants. They have allowed Allison to move into the guesthouse in the back, so they are always in each other's lives, often to comic effect.Apatow has a real sense of capturing these eccentric characters in an extremely natural way. I know they are acting like clowns, but the director makes them appear human and life like. No small feat. He also has a great ear for dialogue and many lines made me laugh out loud because they so brilliantly captured the feelings and character of the people saying them. This doesn't happen that often, so when it does, I really notice.""Knocked Up"" captures the details of their relationship in a believable, honest way. When Allison realizes she is pregnant, and whom she was with when this happened, she becomes distraught. Allison doesn't even know the guy and what she learns about him doesn't assuage her fears. But because she is pregnant with Ben's baby, they spend time together and they actually learn good things about each other, learn to care about each other. They fall in love, naturally and gradually. Allison even begins to adopt some of his likes and habits. And he tries. He tries very hard.""Knocked Up"" is less successful when it tries to capture the entire story of their pregnancy. Throughout, a title comes up to reveal the state of the pregnancy at that time. This helps to guide us through the story, but it also makes it seem episodic. And because we realize soon enough that we will be watching the entire relationship, good and bad, funny and sad, it makes the film feel longer in a way. We sort of anticipate that not everything will be funny and when it isn't, these scenes wear a little thin.But this is a minor complaint in an overall excellent, very funny, adult comedy.Rogen and Apatow have been busy; they have another film coming out this summer. Both served as producers and Rogen wrote the screenplay for ""Superbad"" which appears to be adapted from Rogen's own childhood. In fact, Jonah Hill who plays the Rogen character in ""Superbad"" plays one of his buddies, Jonah (are you sensing the trend?) in ""Knocked Up"". If ""Superbad"" is anywhere near as good, and Apatow thinks it is better, we are in for another treat this summer.",4,4 1/2: This Test is Positive...

She is a beautiful ON-AIR reporter for E! Entertainment Network (implausibly plucked from her job as floor director, but that's a whole different ridicularity), and he is a low-brow, unemployed, illegal alien Canadian slacker who somehow pays rent, buys marijuana, beer and about $100 of new books at Barnes & Noble - all on a $450 annual budget. Yes, that's right.  He's stretched $13,900 of a $14,000 personal injury settlement over seven years, and estimates the last $900 will get him two more.Writer/Director Judd Apatow might've had something here had he written these characters as slightly less than quantum galaxies apart, in income, sophistication, looks, talent and ambition. Perhaps she could have remained a floor director at E!, a sufficiently glamorous job, and he a part-time clerk at a Blockbuster store while working on his celebrity movie nude-scene website (don't ask) in his spare time.  Throw in some very graphic and uncomfortable sex scenes, a poorly written sister/brother-in-law dynamic that is strewn with holes, the fact there is no second act at all (or was it no third act?), roundly unimpressive acting performances, and well, and you're left with nothing.

""Super-Review""","[0, 0]","I have really fallen in love with this new emerging comedy circle that centralizes around Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Jonah Hill and all the others that have appearances in this film.  They have a fresh raw comedic taste that sweeps all the B- comedies of late under the rug.  It can be very raunchy and offensive, but why hold them back?  Only comparable to Kevin Smith films, the Judd Apatow movies aren't afraid to unvail all the taboo were so afraid of.Knocked up is different from the ""circles'"" other movies, because it has so much more substance.  The unplanned pregnancy is what happens quite frequently these days, and I believe this movie encourages us to take a closer look.  The movie may be built of crude jokes, but by the end it will be tugging at your heart strings.  I'm sure it takes a lot of talent to create a movie that appeals to both women and men, and furthermore to create it so unrated and yet sincere.  I reccomend this film very much to those who have an open mind for comedy, because it really does have constructive behavior as well as guilty pleasure.The Blu-ray treatment is great, and I really have no complaints.  I'm really fed up with Universal's universal blu-ray menu, but aside from all that the movie pulls along fine.  Some of the special features are just as funny as the movie.  ""Finding Ben Stone"" has got to be one of the most comical special extra on a blu-ray/dvd I have ever seen.  The special features weigh more than the cost of the blu-ray.So like everyone else will say, if you liked ""Superbad"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" you have to add this to your collection.  It's Superbad with a stronger theme and realer circumstances.

This standing is not without cause, as the film is littered with jokes bout flatulence, websites devoted to nudity in movies and endless misogynistic and homophobic humor.  But somewhere lost in the cultural dialogue of this film is its heart, which focuses on two young people propelled into a situation neither is ready to tackle, but who are both seemingly motivated by good intentions and a desire to make the situation work.The young adults are the mismatched pair Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen).  Scott is an up-and-coming assistant to Ryan Seacrest (in a great role where he lampoons himself), and Stone is a slacker who has parlayed a small settlement in a traffic accident into a life where he can sleep all day, smoke pot with his friends and dream about a huge payday earned from building the Mecca of adult websites. .Despite his lack of goals, money, good looks or social qualms, there's something just boyish and rascally about Stone that allows him to one night hit the beer goggle jackpot when he somehow finds himself in Scotts bed.

I had thought that this would be another ridiculous ""Gorgeous Girl meets the Funny Ugly Guy"" snore fest like the various sitcoms of today (""King of Queens"", ""According to Jim"", etc), but it's so not. All of the characters are three dimensional, so well written, and most are very likable. You take the journey towards unplanned parenthood along with the main characters and see them grow, mature, and yet still remain hilarious. This film was honestly one of the best and smartest written comedies (and in sheer terms of dialogue, one of the best in any genre of film) that I have ever seen.

It wasn't just a guy and gal running around preparing for an unplanned pregnancy and dirty diaper/ little firehouse jokes, It was filled with some good realizations and characters.  Ben is a dreamer, hanging with his friends all day, planning a big web site, and partying at night.  Don't forget the Marijuana.  Alison is a young cable network assistant trying to get a break.  Well, Alison gets the call from upstairs, and she's going in front of the camera.  Let celebrate.  Well, that same night, Ben and his friends hit the clubs as well. Low and behold, a ""connection"" is made....and then the morning arrives and the hangover begins. So much for the connection.  Well, what could happen, oh yeah, on little miscomminication between adults and well...the stoke will be arriving at Alison's house.  The movie takes off from their. Follow the journey of Ben and Alison as they try and get to really know eachother.  Yeah, the movie is a bit Idealistic, many second chances, and does it have the happy hollywood ending? worth watching, I'll likely buy a copy of it when its out on DVD.

1092973,AP3B615GM191G,B000TZJBP6,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","The best way to describe ""Knocked Up"" is this: If a movie like ""Superbad"" actually had a shred of dramatic integrity (e.g. ""a point"") to add to its crude, sometimes gross-out antics, you'd have this comedy.For a basic plot summary, ""Knocked Up"" sees stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and straight-laced Allison (Katherine Heigl) hook up during a drunken one-night stand.  When Allison finds out that she is pregnant, she must decide not only what to do about her ""situation"", but also try to include Ben in the process.To be very frank, this is one of the crudest movies ever made, filled with gross-out images, a boatload of profanity, and sexual zingers at literally almost every turn.  If these are things that you are uncomfortable with, then turn the other way and run right now!At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" does have one key attribute that most of its contemporaries lack: heart.  When you wade through all the stoner jokes, sexual innuendo, and the like, you actually get a story that you might just find yourself caring about.  It touches on a variety of different marital/relationship themes, and the tremendous acting of Heigl/Rogen helps to add a legitimate emotional dynamic to the proceedings.Basically, ""Knocked Up"" is Judd Apatow's pulling together of the traditional romantic comedy and the stoner/goofball genre, a pairing that one would think wouldn't work all that well.  It does in this case, though, because the overall effort is taken seriously enough to produce a perfect mix of well-crafted jokes from all areas of life.  Unless you are turned off by the crudeness, you will be both laughing at and caring about the characters in this movie.",4,Extremely Crude...But With Heart,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1657,"['best', 'way', 'describe', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'movie', 'Superbad', 'actually', 'had', 'shred', 'dramatic', 'integrity', 'e.g', 'point', 'add', 'crude', 'sometimes', 'gross-out', 'antics', ""'d"", 'have', 'comedy.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'sees', 'stoner', 'Ben', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'straight-laced', 'Allison', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'hook', 'up', 'drunken', 'one-night', 'stand', 'When', 'Allison', 'out', 'pregnant', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'do', 'situation', 'also', 'try', 'include', 'Ben', 'process.To', 'be', 'very', 'frank', 'one', 'crudest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'filled', 'gross-out', 'images', 'boatload', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'zingers', 'literally', 'almost', 'turn', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'then', 'turn', 'other', 'way', 'run', 'right', 'now', 'same', 'time', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'have', 'one', 'key', 'attribute', 'most', 'contemporaries', 'lack', 'heart', 'When', 'wade', 'stoner', 'jokes', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'like', 'actually', 'get', 'story', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'caring', 'about', 'variety', 'different', 'marital/relationship', 'themes', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'Heigl/Rogen', 'add', 'legitimate', 'emotional', 'dynamic', 'proceedings.Basically', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'pulling', 'together', 'traditional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stoner/goofball', 'genre', 'pairing', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'case', 'though', 'overall', 'effort', 'taken', 'seriously', 'enough', 'produce', 'perfect', 'mix', 'well-crafted', 'jokes', 'areas', 'life', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'crudeness', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'caring', 'characters', 'movie']",Knocked Up

Second, the movie depicts an unmarried couple who decide not to abort the baby they unintentionally conceive. That is a huge positive. Third, the reconciliation of a difficult relationship between these two people from vastly different backgrounds. A very good movie could have been built around these three positives. But, alas, the downside in this movie is that there is very little interesting or funny for anyone 17 years or over, as most of the dialogue is filled with gutter language and most of the ""jokes"" are scatological or drug-centered. If you are less than 17, you might like this movie, but you will have to attend in the company of an adult -- and that adult will not find much that is interesting or funny.
