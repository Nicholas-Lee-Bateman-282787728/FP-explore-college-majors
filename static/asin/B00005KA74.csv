661361,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00005KA74,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","I've read quite a few books now from John Douglas, former profiler for the F.B.I.  Not that I like to put words in anyone's mouth, but if he were to watch this film -- most likely he gave it a shot and then just gave up would be my guess -- he would most likely say, &#34;Phooey!&#34;  Yes, you might say, &#34;Well, he's just biased,&#34; and you might have a point.  But that point wouldn't be a good one.In at least one of his books, Mr. Douglas discusses this case specifically.  From what I remember, he believed that Wayne Williams was probably guilty.  If Mr. Williams is a murderer -- he was tried and convicted, but some of the evidence I'll agree was on the lean side in this case -- he perhaps didn't kill all of the children.  Maybe he killed none of them.  But even if he wasn't guilty of this set of crimes, there was somebody out there that was LIKE Mr. Williams that did.After all, if you read &#34;Mind Hunter&#34; -- a very good read in which I gave a big recommendation -- you'll learn quite a bit about serial killers and profiling.  Outside of the killers of prostitutes, it is almost always the case that serial killers choose victims in their same race.  (As an example, Gary Ridgeway killed prostitutes from any race.  He was an equal-opportunity killer.)  And it's almost always the case as well that those killers choose victims who are of the sex in which the killer is attracted.  And outside of killers such as Aileen Wournos, there are very few serial killers who are women.  (Most female serial killers tend to poison their victims.  Why?  Maybe 'cause it's neater.  Who knows?  Any female serial killers out there that would care to respond?)So, if you play the averages, the most likely scenario:  the killer was a black man who probably had at least gay and pedophilic tendencies, who was in the correct age range to take advantage of those tendencies.  And this points directly at someone who is at least LIKE Mr. Williams.  But this film introduces some conspiracy theories that are just eye-rollingly ridiculous.  Using Occam's Razor, it is much more likely that some random serial killer murdered the children than some group of people who had to all keep their mouths shut.  Once again, this points to someone LIKE Mr. Williams.I believe that the writer and director of this film tried to create a picture somewhat like &#34;All the President's Men,&#34; and to tell you the truth, I even hate saying &#34;All the President's Men&#34; and &#34;Echo of Murder&#34; in the same sentence.  That sentence would be highly demeaning to a great film such as that near-perfect Robert Redford film.  But this film also reminded me of &#34;JFK,&#34; although I found that film at least mildly entertaining, even though it was full of conspiracy theories as well, most likely since Kevin Costner was the better lead in that better film.This film is really heavy handed but really light on logic.  There is music that plays with your emotion, and it seems that everyone in it uses logical fallacies such as &#34;appeal to emotion.&#34;  For these reasons I'm giving &#34;Echo&#34; a really big pass.  Go read a book instead; may I recommend &#34;Mind Hunter&#34;?",2,Echo Of Madness,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,3190,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'quite', 'few', 'books', 'now', 'John', 'Douglas', 'former', 'profiler', 'F.B.I', 'Not', 'like', 'put', 'words', 'anyone', 'mouth', 'were', 'watch', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'gave', 'shot', 'then', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'guess', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'say', '34', 'Phooey', '34', 'Yes', 'might', 'say', '34', 'Well', 'just', 'biased', '34', 'might', 'have', 'point', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'one.In', 'least', 'one', 'books', 'Mr.', 'Douglas', 'case', 'specifically', 'what', 'remember', 'believed', 'Wayne', 'Williams', 'was', 'probably', 'guilty', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'murderer', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'evidence', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'was', 'lean', 'side', 'case', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'children', 'Maybe', 'killed', 'none', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'guilty', 'set', 'crimes', 'was', 'somebody', 'there', 'was', 'LIKE', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'did.After', 'read', '34', 'Mind', 'Hunter', '34', 'very', 'good', 'read', 'gave', 'big', 'recommendation', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'quite', 'bit', 'serial', 'killers', 'profiling', 'killers', 'prostitutes', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'serial', 'killers', 'choose', 'victims', 'same', 'race', 'example', 'Gary', 'Ridgeway', 'killed', 'prostitutes', 'race', 'was', 'equal-opportunity', 'killer', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'as', 'well', 'killers', 'choose', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'sex', 'killer', 'attracted', 'killers', 'such', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'women', 'Most', 'female', 'serial', 'killers', 'tend', 'poison', 'victims', 'Why', 'Maybe', 'neater', 'Who', 'female', 'serial', 'killers', 'out', 'there', 'would', 'care', 'respond', 'So', 'play', 'averages', 'most', 'likely', 'scenario', 'killer', 'was', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'probably', 'had', 'least', 'gay', 'pedophilic', 'tendencies', 'who', 'was', 'correct', 'age', 'range', 'take', 'advantage', 'tendencies', 'points', 'directly', 'someone', 'who', 'least', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'film', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'are', 'just', 'eye-rollingly', 'ridiculous', 'Using', 'Occam', 'Razor', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'random', 'serial', 'killer', 'murdered', 'children', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'keep', 'mouths', 'shut', 'Once', 'again', 'points', 'someone', 'LIKE', 'Mr.', 'Williams.I', 'believe', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'tried', 'create', 'picture', 'somewhat', '34', 'President', 'Men', '34', 'tell', 'truth', 'even', 'hate', 'saying', '34', 'President', 'Men', '34', '34', 'Echo', 'Murder', '34', 'same', 'sentence', 'sentence', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'demeaning', 'great', 'film', 'such', 'near-perfect', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'reminded', '34', 'JFK', '34', 'found', 'film', 'least', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'even', 'was', 'full', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'well', 'most', 'likely', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'better', 'lead', 'better', 'film.This', 'film', 'really', 'heavy', 'handed', 'really', 'light', 'logic', 'music', 'emotion', 'everyone', 'logical', 'fallacies', 'such', '34', 'appeal', 'emotion.', '34', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'giving', '34', 'Echo', '34', 'really', 'big', 'pass', 'Go', 'read', 'book', 'instead', 'may', 'recommend', '34', 'Mind', 'Hunter', '34']",Echo of Murder

661363,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00005KA74,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[6, 9]","WHO KILLED ATLANTA'S CHILDREN? (released as ECHO OF MURDER, writ./dir. Charles Robert Carner, 2000, 105 minutes, for Showtime television) is a sad sort of attempt at exposition of facts. In the most lackluster performances I've ever seen, Gregory Hines is Ron Larson and Jim Belushi is Pat Laughlin, ""Spin"" magazine reporters from New York, investigating the Atlanta child murders that occurred between 1979 and 1981. The trouble with films like these is the skill and cinematic considerations mean nothing compared to the subject. And that's always a license to do everything badly.As some may recall - I vividly do - during a twenty-three month period between 1979 and 1981, over 30 black children, nearly all boys, were murdered in Atlanta. In July, 1980, after 14 children (possibly more) had been murdered, the mothers of some of the victims formed the Committee to Stop the Children's Murders. The group claimed genocide was taking place, and they gave the Atlanta PD a hard time. A child would disappear about every 25 days. People, especially residents of the Techwood housing project, believed the KKK was responsible.This rattle-trap of a movie, then, follows our two intrepid investigators as they probe the killings, the APD, even the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in an effort to apparently exonerate Wayne Williams. It's sort of a pathetic ruse as presented here. What they discover is a KKK plot to start a race war, giving everyone an excuse to kill all blacks. They uncover GBI cover-ups, gagged agents, moles in the KKK and KKK moles among the authorities. The film is compelling, a bit of a horror show with the dead bodies shown, and somewhat tough to prove.It doesn't help that the acting is so bad I actually shouted at the TV (then again I often do that). The cinematography is good, with some innovative details that have inspired filmmaking. Trouble is, the acting and the story don't bear under the weight. That is always the director's fault, and here you can see everyone was in a hurry to shoot the scene and get the hell out of Atlanta. Sad. Yet it is a story that interests, frightens and angers.Is any of it at all true? I found news mentions of a large family, KKK members, who are portrayed in this film. They are believed to be the KKK death squad that tried to start a race war and may have murdered over 100 boys from 1979 to well beyond 1983. This is all speculation. Wayne Williams, the convicted killer, remains in jail serving consecutive life terms.Not much is out there to study. In July 2000, snotty ""Time"" magazine reporter Richard Corliss wrote: ""The case of the Atlanta child murders [in which] 29 young blacks killed ... was grisly, compelling and pertinent. So why isn't the tale of two ""Spin"" journalists, who later wrote a story implicating white racists in the crimes, a potent TV movie? Because Charles Robert Carner, the writer-director, blithely shuffles fact and innuendo ... his idea of cinematic action is to have people walk briskly and talk loudly while the camera jitters ... Because Gregory Hines and Jim Belushi, as the ""Spin"" sleuths, are ... cop-bad cop. And because the white suspects are yokels .... Your Honor, please, can we have a little order in this courtroom drama?"" Well, no one can accuse Corliss of being Walter Cronkite or William Shakespeare.Incredibly, all this has led to nothing but more theories. Hashed and rehashed, backward, silly theories. CNN reported in June of 2010 that 11 deaths were presented to the jury in Williams' trial. He wasn't charged, but he was convicted in the murder of two adults whose bodies were found in 1981.CNN reported that Williams had to be guilty, simultaneously expressing the idea that it was hard to believe he was the only guilty party. It's Silly season again, and we cannot afford to play this type of kick-ball with such horrid crimes. In any case the film ends in 1992, with a GBI agent getting some heat for destroying evidence of a KKK sting (because he was a member). What I hated most is the film actually expresses the idea that it is presenting us with hard facts. Williams remains in jail.So I say get this film, swallow hard and recall it is not the best of filmmaking. Something like this could never be made today, and it has technical merits if nothing else. Watch the story, decide for yourself what's valid and what's bacon lard. I cannot help thinking this film was forced on everyone involved.I award one star for effort and one for the technical merits.",2,"""If you want to roast an Irishman ...
