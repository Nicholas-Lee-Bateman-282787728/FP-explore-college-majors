These are perfect for expanding a basic knowledge of ASL.Volume 4 has helped my daughter tell me more of what she wants.  She can now show me signs for all family members (she wants to see her cousins, etc.).  She can now tell me so many more emotions.  Before christmas, she was helping Daddy wrap a present for me and I asked what it was.  She signed to me SURPRISE.  :)Signing Time is a great way to introduce children to a second language, ASL.  It is also the perfect way for babies to communicate before they develop speech.  I can't count the times we've prevented a temper tantrum!  These videos have really given my daughter confidence because she knows she can use signs to tell us what she wants, even when she does not know the word or cannot yet speak it clearly.  The second 3 volumes have helped expand our signing vocabulary and really allow us to use ASL more and more.

876764,A3GQWBQLT4I2X2,B00074OLQS,Jennifer O'Daniel,"[0, 0]","We discovered Signing Time while researching ASL (American Sign Language) as a 2nd language for our children. We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]In Volume 4 the songs are lots of fun and work well in a school setting as well as home. The song ""What are you feeling?"" shows signs for emotions. It is funny to see the kids sign scared and make scared faces. These signs are very helpful for getting children to tell you how they feel.  The song about families is great because it talks about how everyone's family is different. ""Your family's made for you and mine is made for me.""We love that we get to hear Leah's voice. What a positive experience for children who are Deaf and Hard Of Hearing to see another Child who is Deaf proudly using their voice. Leah does a great job. It is also great for children who are hearing to see that children who are Deaf can and do use their voices. Alex does a great job as well. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together. We also enjoyed the addition of the frog Hopkins. He helps transition from one theme to another smoothly.One minor thing about this Volume that bothered us is that when Alex And Leah talk about their families the pictures are not of their actual families. Rachel explains the reasons for this on their yahoo site. If you are not familiar with The Coleman and Brown families you won't even notice but if you know Alex and Leah's siblings from other volumes of Signing Time you might be confused. This in no way detracts from the value of this volume. The only reason I mention it is because my kids were wondering why Lucy and Zack were not in the family picture and your kids may ask you too.We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it. She has paint on her fingers to help you focus on her finger positions. This is a new addition for Volumes 3-6. Some people find it distracting at first but I found it very helpful.Each DVD has a section on the menu of ASL tips. This is a good way to get additional information. On this volume they show tips on forming sentences, initializing, and word order.The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention. The new version of the theme song is a little slower (so you can sign along) and has an additional verse. Some may not like it as well as the original but we loved it. We love the original version too so make sure you get both. The older version is in Volumes 1-3. We liked the new verse ""Where friends can meet and find we're not so different after all"" Isn't that what Signing Time is all about?I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation. These shows are a labor of love for these families and we are thankful they chose to share with us.",5,"Family, Feelings, Fun and Fabulous",1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3864,"['discovered', 'Signing', 'Time', 'researching', 'ASL', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', '2nd', 'language', 'children', 'knew', 'wanted', 'teach', 'ASL', '2nd', 'language', 'many', 'benefits', 'such', 'earlier', 'communication', 'can', 'communicate', 'baby', 'as', 'young', '8', 'months', 'old', 'maybe', 'even', 'younger', 'What', 'gift', 'know', 'what', 'child', 'needs', 'can', 'tell', 'spoken', 'words', 'more', 'information', 'benefits', 'ASL', 'check', 'out', 'Signing', 'Time', 'website', '[', ']', 'Volume', '4', 'songs', 'are', 'lots', 'fun', 'work', 'well', 'school', 'setting', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'song', 'What', 'are', 'feeling', 'signs', 'emotions', 'funny', 'see', 'kids', 'sign', 'scared', 'make', 'scared', 'signs', 'are', 'very', 'helpful', 'getting', 'children', 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'song', 'families', 'great', 'how', 'everyone', 'family', 'different', 'family', 'made', 'mine', 'made', 'love', 'get', 'hear', 'Leah', 'voice', 'What', 'positive', 'experience', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'Deaf', 'Hard', 'Hearing', 'see', 'Child', 'who', 'Deaf', 'proudly', 'using', 'voice', 'Leah', 'great', 'job', 'also', 'great', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'hearing', 'see', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'Deaf', 'can', 'do', 'use', 'voices', 'Alex', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'see', '2', 'friends/cousins', 'interacting', 'together', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'addition', 'frog', 'Hopkins', 'transition', 'one', 'theme', 'smoothly.One', 'minor', 'thing', 'Volume', 'bothered', 'when', 'Alex', 'Leah', 'talk', 'families', 'pictures', 'are', 'not', 'actual', 'families', 'Rachel', 'reasons', 'yahoo', 'site', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Coleman', 'Brown', 'families', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'know', 'Alex', 'Leah', 'siblings', 'other', 'volumes', 'Signing', 'Time', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'way', 'value', 'volume', 'only', 'reason', 'mention', 'kids', 'were', 'wondering', 'why', 'Lucy', 'Zack', 'were', 'not', 'family', 'picture', 'kids', 'may', 'ask', 'too.We', 'written', 'word', 'screen', 'first', 'then', 'show', 'sign', 'very', 'helpful', 'practicing', 'signs', 'video', 'flashcard', 'also', 'children', 'develop', 'reading', 'skills', 'start', 'recognize', 'written', 'word', 'sign', 'love', 'watching', 'children', 'do', 'signs', 'see', 'lots', 'different', 'kids', 'lots', 'different', 'skill', 'levels', 'idea', 'how', 'child', 'might', 'make', 'sign', 'different', 'ages', 'Rachel', 'also', 'sign', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'proper', 'way', 'do', 'paint', 'fingers', 'help', 'focus', 'finger', 'positions', 'new', 'addition', 'Volumes', '3-6', 'people', 'find', 'distracting', 'first', 'found', 'very', 'helpful.Each', 'DVD', 'section', 'menu', 'ASL', 'tips', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'additional', 'information', 'volume', 'show', 'tips', 'forming', 'sentences', 'initializing', 'word', 'order.The', 'song', 'credits', 'great', 'way', 'learn', 'additional', 'signs', 'were', 'not', 'covered', 'show', 'can', 'really', 'add', 'signing', 'vocabulary', 'pay', 'attention', 'new', 'version', 'theme', 'song', 'little', 'slower', 'can', 'sign', 'along', 'additional', 'verse', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'loved', 'love', 'original', 'version', 'too', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'older', 'version', 'Volumes', '1-3', 'liked', 'new', 'verse', 'Where', 'friends', 'can', 'meet', 'find', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'different', ""n't"", 'what', 'Signing', 'Time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'volume', 'signing', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'other', '5', 'series', 'mother', 'teacher', 'can', 'say', 'truly', 'best', 'educational', 'tool', 'have', 'found', 'teaching', 'ASL', 'children', 'adults', 'too', 'hope', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'buy', 'hesitation', 'shows', 'are', 'labor', 'love', 'families', 'are', 'thankful', 'chose', 'share']","Signing Time Volume 4: Family, Feelings & Fun"

William has Trisomy 21/aka Down syndrome and apraxia. Signing Time has helped him with Total Communication~ when his speech hasn't been clear, the signing helps him refine the word. I've found that as he watches Signing Time and the repetition of each new word introduced, William is more apt to repeat the word with greater clarity each time.
