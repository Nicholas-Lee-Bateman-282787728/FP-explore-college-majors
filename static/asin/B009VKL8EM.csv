Great to show on the big screen as it feels like you are there.  I'll keep it in rotation with my other concert dvds,4,Fun video.

1602562,A3VSQB6YN5WOLD,B009VKL8EM,"kitty ""vancat""","[0, 0]","I fell in love with Mumford and Sons after watching The Road to Red Rocks on PBS several years ago.  I bought the CD, and I often thought I wish I could have been there.  Last year, they came to Oak Mountain in Pelham, Alabama.  I didn't get to Red Rocks, but I did get to Pelham.  They are a unique group of mates who have made some of the most original music I've ever heard.  I'm glad their road led them closer to my home.",5,Closer to Home,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,426,"['fell', 'love', 'Mumford', 'Sons', 'watching', 'Road', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'PBS', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'CD', 'often', 'thought', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Last', 'year', 'came', 'Oak', 'Mountain', 'Pelham', 'Alabama', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'did', 'get', 'Pelham', 'are', 'unique', 'group', 'mates', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'most', 'original', 'music', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', ""'m"", 'glad', 'road', 'led', 'closer', 'home']",Road to Red Rocks
1602563,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B009VKL8EM,M. Oleson,"[9, 9]","I think I saw a version of this concert recently on Showtime but I watched it again, this time on a beautifully presented Blu ray disc, complete with a stellar DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track.  It is amazingly good, both in terms of a natural surround sound coming from the Red Rocks venue as well as the great songs performed by the band.  The video as well is excellent.  The great colors of the Colorado countryside are well displayed in full 16:9 aspect ratio.  There are no extras on the disc.  Numerous language sub-titles are available as well as Dolby Surround 5.1 and a PCM stereo track.One of my biggest complaints of music concert films is the jerky quick-cut editing.  While some of that is present here it is less noticeable than most concert videos.  The 88 minute film, shot over 2 nights in the summer of 2012, intercuts several short segments of the band appearing in less well known venues such as Portland...Maine.  These only last a couple minutes each and are not terribly distracting.  Certainly less so than the long winded gibberish some performers exude.As far as the music, the band is certainly at its joyful, playful best.  The 4 primary band members are joined by others during the concert, depending on the song.  The band Dawes comes out on ""Wake My Soul.""  The music is great.  Always well written songs from this group who is about as popular as any band on the planet right now.  Why?  The band seems to transcend genres, cultures and generations.  I've been listening to a lot of Eagles music lately.  I think one of the reason their music remains popular is great song writing and angelic harmonies.  The same can be said of Mumford and Sons.  I suspect they will be around a long time.",5,Red Rocks rocks again,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1726,"['think', 'saw', 'version', 'concert', 'recently', 'Showtime', 'watched', 'again', 'time', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'complete', 'stellar', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'audio', 'track', 'amazingly', 'good', 'terms', 'natural', 'surround', 'sound', 'coming', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'venue', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'songs', 'performed', 'band', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'great', 'colors', 'Colorado', 'countryside', 'are', 'well', 'displayed', 'full', '16:9', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'are', 'extras', 'disc', 'Numerous', 'language', 'sub-titles', 'are', 'available', 'as', 'well', 'Dolby', 'Surround', '5.1', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'track.One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'music', 'concert', 'films', 'jerky', 'quick-cut', 'editing', 'present', 'here', 'less', 'noticeable', 'most', 'concert', 'videos', '88', 'minute', 'film', 'shot', '2', 'nights', 'summer', '2012', 'several', 'short', 'segments', 'band', 'appearing', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'venues', 'such', 'Portland', 'Maine', 'only', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'distracting', 'Certainly', 'less', 'so', 'long', 'winded', 'gibberish', 'performers', 'exude.As', 'far', 'music', 'band', 'certainly', 'joyful', 'playful', 'best', '4', 'primary', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'joined', 'others', 'concert', 'depending', 'song', 'band', 'Dawes', 'out', 'Wake', 'My', 'Soul', 'music', 'great', 'Always', 'well', 'written', 'songs', 'group', 'who', 'about', 'as', 'popular', 'band', 'planet', 'right', 'now', 'Why', 'band', 'transcend', 'genres', 'cultures', 'generations', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'lot', 'Eagles', 'music', 'lately', 'think', 'one', 'reason', 'music', 'popular', 'great', 'song', 'writing', 'angelic', 'harmonies', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Mumford', 'Sons', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time']",Road to Red Rocks

I bought the first album and thought it was decent but nothing I would want to spend money to witness in person. Then one night as I was flipping through movie channels, this film was scheduled to play at 2 a.m. and I couldn't stay up to check it out, so I went ahead and set my DVR to record it so I could watch it the next day. After watching them perform live, I gained a whole new respect for them. After watching the DVR movie channel version about 10 or more times, I realized that I had to purchase this film for myself!Not only does the film look & sound better than the DVR recording I had originally watched, it also had more songs than the movie channel version had shown! There's something great about watching this band live as opposed to listening to an album. To me, it is what makes them go from a decent band to a great band!
