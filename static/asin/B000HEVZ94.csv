I read that the first disc set is now out of print so it would be an opportune time to get these together with a bunch of extras and put them on blu-ray and I can promise people will buy them up. A lot of people love these shows!!!",4,Awesome show from my childhood,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,354,"['wish', 'were', 'released', 'were', 'aired', 'HBO', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'know', ""'d"", 'sell', 'blank-load', 'read', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'now', 'print', 'would', 'be', 'opportune', 'time', 'get', 'together', 'bunch', 'extras', 'put', 'blu-ray', 'can', 'promise', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'up', 'lot', 'people', 'shows']",N/A

It is like the Twilight Zone, with Page Fletcher giving monologues on each episode, and the episodes giving a creepy atmosphere, often with a moral theme at the end.
