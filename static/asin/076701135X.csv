3631,A3K74JJXH3QAFS,076701135X,DPK,"[25, 28]","There are two things that must be said about WKRP in Cincinatti. The first is that it was arguably the best workplace sitcom of the last thirty years. The other is that it deserves better treament for a video release than it's received thus far.For my part, I didn't really notice the absence of particular songs in the set (which has been a prized possession for years). I was too engrossed in the episodes themselves thanks to the excellent scripts and performances.That said, I would probably be willing to pay a few bucks more to pay for having the original music choices reinstated. The notion that the absence of the original songs is somehow a justification for piracy, however, is just madness. Putting aside the fact that it's criminal, it's also illogical as it punishes the people whose work these ""fans"" claim to admire so much. If one truly loves and respects the work of the many talented people who made WKRP, then they should realize that buying and selling pirated copies, depriving those artists of fair compensaiton for their work, is simply wrong.I love WKRP and I'll be among the first to pre-order if it finally sees the light of day. Until then, those who really respect the makers of the show (behind and in front of the camera) should be patient. A lot of music-intensive shows (Freaks & Geeks and SCTV being two examples) have managed to get on the market with their original music intact, so there's hope. I'll choose hope over self-centered criminal activity any day.",3,WKRP Deserves Better But Let's Not Be Criminal About It,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,1495,"['are', 'two', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'WKRP', 'Cincinatti', 'first', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'workplace', 'sitcom', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'other', 'better', 'treament', 'video', 'release', 'received', 'thus', 'far.For', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'absence', 'particular', 'songs', 'set', 'been', 'prized', 'possession', 'years', 'was', 'too', 'engrossed', 'episodes', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'performances.That', 'said', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'willing', 'pay', 'few', 'bucks', 'more', 'pay', 'having', 'original', 'music', 'choices', 'reinstated', 'notion', 'absence', 'original', 'songs', 'somehow', 'justification', 'piracy', 'however', 'just', 'madness', 'Putting', 'fact', 'criminal', 'also', 'illogical', 'people', 'work', 'fans', 'claim', 'admire', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'truly', 'loves', 'work', 'many', 'talented', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'WKRP', 'then', 'should', 'realize', 'buying', 'selling', 'pirated', 'copies', 'depriving', 'artists', 'fair', 'compensaiton', 'work', 'simply', 'wrong.I', 'love', 'WKRP', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'pre-order', 'finally', 'light', 'day', 'then', 'who', 'really', 'respect', 'makers', 'show', 'front', 'camera', 'should', 'be', 'patient', 'lot', 'music-intensive', 'shows', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'SCTV', 'being', 'two', 'examples', 'have', 'managed', 'get', 'market', 'original', 'music', 'intact', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'choose', 'hope', 'self-centered', 'criminal', 'activity', 'day']",N/A

This was a great comedy, on par with such classic 80's sitcoms as Taxi and Barney Miller, yet it finds itself in video purgatory, along with other great shows of the era such as St. Elsewhere.  It took awhile for WKRP to establish an audience.  I remember how it got pushed around from one time slot to another, never getting the attention it deserved then.  But, it produced such memorable characters, with Loni Anderson, Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman all enjoying success after WKRP, albeit Loni never got as good a role as she had as Jennifer.

It was the right cast at the right time and everything else about it was just...right.The only reason I titled my review, ""Almost Perfect"" is because in the versions of the show you see now, all the old rock music has been deleted and replaced with studio recordings of the songs by unknown artists or just bland anonymous music.  If you saw the series when it aired in the 70s, it was true to what it was...a rock and roll radio station playing the big artists of the 70s.  Thanks to the lawyers and greedy music companies, the original music that was in the series got surgically removed and replaced by what you'll hear now.  Don't get me wrong...the show is still HILARIOUS.  It's just not as perfect as it was when it originally aired.  Hopefully at some point in the future, some smart cookie will release WKRP in its original form as it aired on CBS.This show should be up there with M*A*S*H and All in the Family so far as history goes.  It's really THAT GOOD.  From hearing Les Nessman describe live turkeys hit the pavement ""like bags of wet cement"" to Arthur Carlson slap his foot to wake it up because he thought he was putting on foot powder that turned out to really be cocaine, it's one funny episode after another.Don't bother renting the episodes that aired after they tried to revive the show in the 80s without Andy Travis and much of the original cast.  It's like Caddyshack 2:  a poor, poor attempt to recapture the magic of the original.  The original episodes that aired in the late 70s are GOLDEN though.  Rent 'em, buy 'em or whatever.

One myth that has been perpetrated here has to stop: The Consultant was NOT one of the better episodes. Yes, it had a really good 5 minutes or so when the cast assumes Travis' &quot;fake&quot; roles to get his former buddy to sound uncredible. Those 5 minutes were fine; the other 18 minutes or so of the show was boring. And while the Turkey one was a classic, there was 1 episode I would have loved to be one here. The one where Carlson ran for city council against some creep they found out had a drinking problem. This show had probably the greatest Les Nessman line of all time: when they found out the drunk opponent had fallen into his dinner at a convention honoring Armenian Americans (or something like that), Les said &quot;Why are Armenians eating Lasagne?&quot; Anyone who eats lasagne with me for the rest of my life will hear that, regardless of whether they've seen the show or not.

I'm about as disappoitned as anyone that the original shows aren't being aired with the music that was featured back then. Being in radio myself, I understand the royalty issue that must be dealt with before the show has any chance of seeing the light of day on DVD, but so many people loved this show that it deserves far better than the generic stock music that's in any repeats that show these days unless your local TV station happened to have purchased (and hung onto) one of the older syndication packages from when the show was distributed by Victory television and features the actual songs. The ""dubbed"" version just isn't the same, and there were classic storylines throughout the entire four season run of the show. Please Fox, do us all a favor, spend the time and money and do this show right. There's an audience waiting...and finally (and somewhat off-topic): I have to disagree with the reviewer that said ""M*A*S*H"" lacked timelessness in its humor.
