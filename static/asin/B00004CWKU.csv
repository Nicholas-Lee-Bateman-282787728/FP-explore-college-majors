My wife, who appreciates a good story more than she loves a war movie, thought it was wonderful.  I felt it was successful on both fronts--a very engaging story and an excellent war movie.  It ties in the soldiers in France and the civilians back in England very well, with a few surprises.",5,A rare gem,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,358,"['very', 'well-done', 'film', 'one', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'years', 'wife', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'more', 'war', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'felt', 'was', 'successful', 'fronts', 'very', 'engaging', 'story', 'excellent', 'war', 'movie', 'soldiers', 'France', 'civilians', 'back', 'England', 'very', 'well', 'few', 'surprises']",Dunkirk VHS

Garcia,"[1, 1]","Very realistic movie about a dark episode in Britain's history when her soldiers were fighting with their backs to the sea surrounded by the Nazis, and how her Navy and volunteer, civilian boat owners rallied to pull off a miracle and saved over 330,000 men. The movie showcases the resoluteness of the British people when facing desperate situations.

547330,A1OM0SH8SX7U10,B00004CWKU,"James Coyne ""mad writer""","[0, 0]","A solid film. A less expensive companion to the star studded 'The Longest Day', this film manages to have a smack of realism. Obviously, the people who made this film were actually there (The film was made less than 20 years after the events), and so watching this small unit as it marches across France to the beaches of Dunkirk has an authenticity to it. The flip side, the story of the 'little boats' is excellent as well, with coward-turned hero David Attenborough nearly stealing the film, except the gravity of Bernard Lee(you know him as M to Connery's bond) won't quite let him get away with it.If you're interested in this corner of the war, the excellent narrative written by Hugh Sebag-Montefiore is for me the definitive account. This film manages to avoid some of the teary eyed cliche of British war time films, and little of the cynicism of later films. Highly recommend for war film fans.",4,Wars are not won by retreats.,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,904,"['solid', 'film', 'less', 'expensive', 'companion', 'star', 'studded', 'Longest', 'Day', 'film', 'have', 'smack', 'realism', 'Obviously', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'less', '20', 'years', 'events', 'so', 'watching', 'small', 'unit', 'France', 'beaches', 'Dunkirk', 'authenticity', 'flip', 'side', 'story', ""'little"", 'boats', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'coward-turned', 'hero', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'nearly', 'stealing', 'film', 'gravity', 'Bernard', 'Lee', 'know', 'M', 'Connery', 'bond', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quite', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'it.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'corner', 'war', 'excellent', 'narrative', 'written', 'Hugh', 'Sebag-Montefiore', 'definitive', 'account', 'film', 'avoid', 'teary', 'eyed', 'cliche', 'British', 'war', 'time', 'films', 'little', 'cynicism', 'later', 'films', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'war', 'film', 'fans']",Dunkirk VHS
547331,A16XRPF40679KG,B00004CWKU,Michael Dobey,"[8, 8]","This is a exceptional war movie filled with first rate performances and it remains as gripping and well mades as ever.  The effects are very good with large ships sinking and docks being blown to pieces, and bombs plastering the beachs of dunkirk.  This was not a low budget affair when it was made , it was a A movie and it was shot in black and white but it still looks great.  The ony problem is that noone had the brains enough in the united states to release this in our region. (region one) I have a all region player so I can watch this on my tv but surely this incredibly well made movie featuring the great late john mills and bernard lee and others should be out on a domestic dvd. If you want a top rate film, and have a all region dvd player. (these players are not that expensive and are on sale here on amazon.com) then this is worth adding to your 'good' war film library because it's historically accurate and engaging.",5,why wasn't this put out in our region?,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,935,"['exceptional', 'war', 'movie', 'filled', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'gripping', 'well', 'mades', 'ever', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'large', 'ships', 'sinking', 'docks', 'being', 'blown', 'pieces', 'bombs', 'plastering', 'beachs', 'dunkirk', 'was', 'not', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'A', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'still', 'great', 'ony', 'problem', 'noone', 'had', 'brains', 'enough', 'united', 'states', 'release', 'region', 'region', 'one', 'have', 'region', 'player', 'can', 'watch', 'tv', 'surely', 'incredibly', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'featuring', 'great', 'late', 'john', 'mills', 'bernard', 'lee', 'others', 'should', 'be', 'out', 'domestic', 'dvd', 'want', 'top', 'rate', 'film', 'have', 'region', 'dvd', 'player', 'players', 'are', 'not', 'expensive', 'are', 'sale', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'then', 'worth', 'adding', ""'good"", 'war', 'film', 'library', 'historically', 'accurate', 'engaging']",Dunkirk VHS

I think it gives a very real portrayal of the situation that 300,000+ British soldiers found themselves in in 1940, and I have to admit I watch it with a slight lump in the throat every time as I think of the fact that my Grandfather was actually on that beach, waiting for his turn to be evacuated.
