It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough.

Everytime someone tells a spooky story, the creepy creature comes to life and tries to run everyone off. Yet, Mystery Inc. ain't scared that easily and do their best to figure this mystery out.I'll agree. This feature-length animated feature does remind one of old Scooby Doo episodes. It provides a good mystery to try and figure out and is, actually, creepy and scary in some parts. However, I just wasn't too crazy about this one. Don't ask me why, I really couldn't tell you. I guess I was expecting it to be more like previous Scooby animated features and be a little more deep in the storyline instead of resorting to be a parody knockoff of old Slasher flicks like Jason  and whatnot.Do I think it's worth adding to the collection? Oh, definitely. Anything Scooby Doo is worth adding to it. Just cuz' I'm not too crazy about it doesn't mean you'd feel that way about it.

I didn't much like ""Cyber Chase."" ""Legend of Vampire"" was pretty good. ""Monster of Mexico"" and ""Loch Ness Monster"" had their moments. ""Aloha Scooy Doo"" was ok. ""Where's My Mummy?"" was interesting. I didn't much like ""Chill Out."" My absolute 2 favorites were ""Pirates Ahoy"" and ""Goblin King.""Onto the subject at hand. Fred is happy about being a camp counselor at the camp where he grew up. But at their arrival, they find the camp has been threatened by a maniac with an ax. But 3 children show up and Fred sees that they stay. (The other children have been sent home already.)It's interesting that we see Fred with a kind of Fred Jr; Velmah with a little version of herself; and Shaggy has what appears to be a little Shaggy.(Daphne is busy enough with her jealousy when a counselor from the other camp finds Fred attractive.)The interesting thing about this 15th Chapter of Scooby Doo is that as horror stories are told at camp, they seem to come true. And of course things start to make sense when they find out about what had happened in the area some years ago.I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But without being obvious, there is a good combination of surprises, and things a sharp observer would have found out.One thing I really like about this 15th Chapter is that unlike # 8 ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" and some others, Fred is NOT absurdly dumbed down.

Usually I can figure them out fairly quickly but this one did have me guessing who one of the villians were up to the end (but it also had that guy who you know is obviously in on the mystery).  Really good story line and a bit more mature, something that a family could enjoy together.  This is classic Scooby Doo and one of my favorite feature length Scooby cartoons so far.Let me set the record straight, because I have seen a lot of reviews saying this has a lot more sexual action in it than other Doos.  From some of them, I was expecting some raunchy stuff!  I believe there is a lot on TV kids have no business seeing today but parents, don't worry.  There is nothing remotely offensive about this movie. Once the camera pans from feet up on Daphne, Velma, and a female camp councilor while they are in their swim wear but I mean come on...this is no worse than other things that has happened in other Scooby movies.  Totally nothing to get worked up about, not revealing at all.  Once again, this is a slightly more mature Scooby so...lets act mature people.  The only thing I caught was in the beginning Fred mentions him and a friend trying to row up Smits creek without a paddle.  A witty pun that only older audiences could appreciate.  Other than that, this movie is totally clean so don't worry.The monsters are pretty freaky.  Fishman, the Woodsman, and the Spectre are quite scary but not to the point where I would worry about letting young kids watch it.  Maybe the Spectre because of its zombie looks but it is a page right out of Scooby Doo on Zombie Island so if they have seen that movie, they will be fine.  But they do put the gang in some situations that made even me concerned.  They did very well with adding suspense with this one!  More believable and intense than some villians have been so there is that fun element of surprise and shock.So, great storyline with a twisting plot, all the characters are together, good writing, perfect setting for Scooby Doo.

The second full length Scooby within the same year is more intense and may scare little ones, but over all, for us Scooby-Doo diehards, we welcome another venture into Creepsville.This time, Fred takes the gang up to his old childhood Camp Little Moose- a rundown, campground at the base of a dam which, of course, is plagued by not one, but three spooks trying to scare everyone off.The peril level heightens in this installment.  Perhaps, the developers wanted to charge it up a bit since Abracadabra-Doo.  There's an ax wielding Woodsman(shades of Halloween) which I believe is too scary for pre-school and even early elementary-aged kiddoes.  And a Fishman, who attempts to grab or bite or worse, drown gang members.  The mystery is involved and takes the gang to different situations including the typical, creepy cave.Our children loved, as is usual, the Scoopy goofy antics which are funny and well done as the gang tries to run the camp.  There's again a little tension between Fred and Daphne regarding a potential girl competitor.  They hint once more at Fred and Daphne's probable girl-boyfriend relationship.  And finally, Velma has a bit of a comeuppance regarding who's the cute one.  I think the girls need to turn the tables on the boys regarding this topic in a future episode!Overall, we liked it, but it's not our favorite.  Thankfully, they resolve the story without going supernatural.  We prefer the old fashioned, explainable mysteries.  The extras include an episode from CN's Scooby-Doo!

It was pretty scary for a kids movie. Of course that's great for adults, but as a parent, I recommend you watch this first before your kids watch it, or at least have them sit with you upon the first viewing.The other downfall is that there is a little more skin showing here with the women then you would usually see in a scooby doo feature. We're not talking nudity, but we're talking about some pretty skimpy bathing suits. This is basically a parent's opinion as to what you want the kids to see and what not to see.  Unfortunately due to cable television there really isn't much that kids don't see these days. Therefore I let it go when I watched it.Other than that, it was very exciting And at times was almost like a virtual ride. It might even be worth watching with 3d glasses.

1361899,AK46OT6BNO9XP,B003T8FLTK,Steven W. Roark,"[12, 16]","It is more like the original series than some movies, though the monsters are a little more intense. The woodsman is a scary looking maniac that swings an axe at anyone in range, similar to the slasher movies of the eighties. The fishman is fast-moving version of the creature from the black lagoon. And the final, and most brief, monster is the flying banshee/spectre that appears for one chase scene. It scared my kids more than any other scooby doo and started to worry if this was too intense for my 5 year old. At least the ending doesn't involve any real monsters or ghosts.I thought the creators focused a little too much attention on the girls' very brief swimsuits by panning across their bodies while the girls stood in a pin-up pose and the guys ogled them. But I guess I'm the only one that thought that was out-of-place in a children's cartoon. Still, Daphne seems to have traded her fashion sense and adopted Daisy Duke's wardrobe. I guess hey want to keep the dads watching too.The graphics are very nice, you can see some 3D modeling mixed nicely with the hand drawn characters. The back story is kind of interesting, though I think it could have been better woven into the story if they didn't spend so much time being chased by 3 different monsters. Overall, a solid addition to the series, but they've traded spooky and innocent fun for something a little scarier and slightly sexier.",3,for the older crowd,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1403,"['more', 'original', 'series', 'movies', 'monsters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'woodsman', 'scary', 'looking', 'maniac', 'swings', 'axe', 'anyone', 'range', 'similar', 'slasher', 'movies', 'eighties', 'fishman', 'fast-moving', 'version', 'creature', 'black', 'lagoon', 'final', 'most', 'brief', 'monster', 'flying', 'banshee/spectre', 'one', 'chase', 'scene', 'scared', 'kids', 'more', 'other', 'scooby', 'doo', 'started', 'worry', 'was', 'too', 'intense', '5', 'year', 'old', 'least', 'ending', ""n't"", 'involve', 'real', 'monsters', 'ghosts.I', 'thought', 'creators', 'focused', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'girls', 'very', 'brief', 'swimsuits', 'panning', 'bodies', 'girls', 'stood', 'pin-up', 'pose', 'guys', 'ogled', 'guess', ""'m"", 'only', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'out-of-place', 'children', 'cartoon', 'Still', 'Daphne', 'have', 'traded', 'fashion', 'sense', 'adopted', 'Daisy', 'Duke', 'wardrobe', 'guess', 'hey', 'want', 'keep', 'dads', 'watching', 'too.The', 'graphics', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'can', 'see', '3D', 'modeling', 'mixed', 'nicely', 'hand', 'drawn', 'characters', 'back', 'story', 'kind', 'interesting', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'woven', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'being', 'chased', '3', 'different', 'monsters', 'Overall', 'solid', 'addition', 'series', ""'ve"", 'traded', 'spooky', 'innocent', 'fun', 'something', 'little', 'scarier', 'slightly', 'sexier']",N/A
