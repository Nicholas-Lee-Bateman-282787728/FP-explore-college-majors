Could probably be the worse. If your considering watching this movie because it involves women in prision and your hopes that it is a racy sexy film...don't waste your time. It is boring, dull and the dialog is not fit to be read. Story line is simple and completely stupid. Nielsen couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.

She has a great body, and that is the end of her talent. This movie looked like they made it up along the way.

927928,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,B000AM4P86,The Whatever Dude,"[5, 6]","To start this review off, I have never, ever seen the originalChained Heatfrom 1983, but I was intrigued to check this one out, mainly for Sylvester Stallone's ex/Flavor Flav's current lady friend, Brigitte Nielsen and Paul Koslo (Robot Jox).What was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, turned out to be a complete nightmare for young student Alex Morrison (Played by Kimberly Kates.) Alex is wrongfully arrested for smuggling drugs into the Czech Republic, and is found guilty, given a 10-year sentence, and shipped to the Reznik Prison. At Reznik, she meets the sadistic Warden Magda Kassar (Played by Nielsen), her equally sadistic assistant Rosa, and Bobo, a Shakespeare-quoting transvestite. Meanwhile, Alex's sister Suzanne (Played by Kari Whitman) tries to get the charges towards her sister cleared, with the help of attorney Mr. Goff (Played by Koslo), who hides an agenda of his own.In no way would I call this movie a masterpiece. It is cheesy, but it also manages to be entertaining in some parts, like with Bobo, who I found to be quite funny, in an unintentional way. And Kimberly Kates is hot. No lie. So if you're just looking for something to watch and have nothing better to do, give Chained Heat 2 a watch.Slightly Recommended.EXTRAS: The Canadian VHS tape, which I own, has a Cineplex Odeon Gift Card Promo and trailers forTC 2000andCriminal Behavior.",3,Enjoyable for what it is.,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,1374,"['start', 'review', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'seen', 'originalChained', 'Heatfrom', '1983', 'was', 'intrigued', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'mainly', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'ex/Flavor', 'Flav', 'current', 'lady', 'friend', 'Brigitte', 'Nielsen', 'Paul', 'Koslo', 'Robot', 'Jox', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'trip', 'lifetime', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'complete', 'nightmare', 'young', 'student', 'Alex', 'Morrison', 'Played', 'Kimberly', 'Kates', 'Alex', 'wrongfully', 'arrested', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'found', 'guilty', 'given', '10-year', 'sentence', 'shipped', 'Reznik', 'Prison', 'Reznik', 'sadistic', 'Warden', 'Magda', 'Kassar', 'Played', 'Nielsen', 'equally', 'sadistic', 'assistant', 'Rosa', 'Bobo', 'Shakespeare-quoting', 'transvestite', 'Meanwhile', 'Alex', 'sister', 'Suzanne', 'Played', 'Kari', 'Whitman', 'get', 'charges', 'towards', 'sister', 'cleared', 'help', 'attorney', 'Mr.', 'Goff', 'Played', 'Koslo', 'who', 'agenda', 'own.In', 'way', 'would', 'call', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'cheesy', 'also', 'be', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'Bobo', 'who', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'unintentional', 'way', 'Kimberly', 'Kates', 'hot', 'lie', 'So', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'give', 'Chained', 'Heat', '2', 'watch.Slightly', 'Recommended.EXTRAS', 'Canadian', 'VHS', 'tape', 'own', 'Cineplex', 'Odeon', 'Gift', 'Card', 'Promo', 'trailers', 'forTC', '2000andCriminal', 'Behavior']",N/A
