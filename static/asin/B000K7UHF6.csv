They played for an hour and it felt like I got jipped. There was a few good spots in the show, but it wasnt as great as I'd hoped. Not going stop liking the music do to this though, I belive the in music and not the outside actions of a band.",4,I head a voice,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,365,"['Ive', 'AFI', 'live', 'was', 'much', 'different', 'dvd', 'Davey', 'screwed', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'screams', 'werent', 'great', 'live', 'played', 'hour', 'felt', 'got', 'jipped', 'was', 'few', 'good', 'spots', 'show', 'as', 'great', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Not', 'going', 'stop', 'liking', 'music', 'do', 'belive', 'music', 'not', 'outside', 'actions', 'band']",N/A

And for AFI it's a new live DVD entitled ""I Heard a Voice"".""I Heard a Voice"" features a live concert from the 2006 tour promoting the groups ""decemberunderground"", filmed at their largest headlining gig at the Long Beach Arena. It features songs primarily from the groups last two records, ""Sing the Sorrow"" and ""decemberunderground"", with a few older songs sprinkled in for good measure, including an excellent rendition of ""A Single Second"", featuring Tiger Amry's lead singer/ all around good guy Nick 13 singing vocals, a treat for those who like both AFI and Tiger Army.So how is it? Although I would've liked some more bonus features, maybe the groups music videos thus far, some in studio footage, things of that sort as all you get are some interviews with the band and their fans and some hidden short video pieces, the overall quality of the DVD is excellent, although it does suffer from too many cuts coming far to quickly on top of one another, a sad development in the live DVD market. The performances are high energy and well played, and the DVD quality is excellent. The sound quality is top notch, availble in both 5:1 Surround and two channel stero.For fans of AFI this is a welcome addition to their AFI collections. For those who maybe fairweather fans, or people who don't like AFI at all, this probably won't change their minds.",4,"Well, what'd the voice say?

Ferraro ""Feminist Media Fan""","[0, 0]","This is the best sort of concert video, one that makes you feel like you're there just enough to make you wish you could go back and time and be there.The camera work was excellent on this.  There were cameras in a variety of positions, including some in the crowd.  It gave the show an immediacy and a realness that I quite like.The sound was slightly too perfect for me, which probably sounds like a strange thing to say.  I think that maybe if they'd mixed in just a little more sound recorded not from the sound board but out in the audience it would've felt less slick and produced.  Nevertheless, it was a vibrant performance vocally and musically.This band is amazing to watch.  So freaking energetic and all over the stage.  It was exciting and exhausting to watch.The songs they played were a good mixture in my opinion, but I am a more recent fan and I prefer their more recent music.I would have loved to have been there, and I will definitely go see them next time they come through my part of the world.

After i got ALL HALLOWS it was on, i must say it was quite good.Now, look at this!  Compare the show to any of their older stageshows, there are plenty of tapes lying around.See anything you like?Now, the terrible rating would not generally come to a band because of this music.  It's not TERRIBLE.  maybe two stars i guess, but when you know what this band used to be and how they have suddenly shunned hardcore with no goodbye, it's really just insulting and demands some retaliation.i feel similarly about their latest ...  album?  decemberunderground.  blech.",1,where did they go?,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,725,"['came', 'learn', 'AFI', 'many', 'did', 'unfortunately', 'SING', 'THE', 'SORROW', 'was', 'allrite', 'i', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'untill', 'i', 'heard', 'other', 'albums', 'i', 'got', 'HALLOWS', 'was', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'good.Now', 'look', 'Compare', 'show', 'older', 'stageshows', 'are', 'plenty', 'tapes', 'lying', 'around.See', 'anything', 'Now', 'terrible', 'rating', 'would', 'not', 'generally', 'come', 'band', 'music', 'not', 'TERRIBLE', 'maybe', 'two', 'stars', 'i', 'guess', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'band', 'used', 'be', 'how', 'have', 'suddenly', 'shunned', 'hardcore', 'goodbye', 'really', 'just', 'insulting', 'retaliation.i', 'feel', 'similarly', 'latest', 'album', 'decemberunderground', 'blech']",N/A
