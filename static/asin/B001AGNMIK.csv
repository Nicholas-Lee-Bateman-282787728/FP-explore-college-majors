Naomi Watts (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, EASTERN PROMISES, FUNNY GAMES) plays her role as protective mother / unwitting paranormal investigator / desperate victim in her usual, realistic manner.

1165662,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B001AGNMIK,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","I just reviewed ""The Ring 2,"" so I figured that I should review the first in the series, even though it's been awhile since I've seen it.  I have watched it at least twice though, so most of the scenes are still in my mind.But what I remember most is one of the themes of the film.  It's more of a question really than a theme, but that question would be:  ""Would you be willing to throw someone else under the bus to keep yourself from being run over?""  You probably know about the videotape in this film, and how watching that videotape will. . . . O.K.  I don't want to give out a spoiler.  Let's just say that you might want to throw out -- or donate, minus one particular tape -- that old videotape collection.  After all, there's DVD nowadays.  Better yet, how about Blu-ray?  1080P is always nice.  Perhaps better still, maybe HD streaming on a Roku box.  The new 4K technology best still, if it ever costs less than a brand new car.This is one of the issues of this film, really, in the sense that it has already become somewhat dated even though it released about 10 years ago.  Who watches VHS anymore?  No one that I know, and I don't even believe that studios release films nowadays on VHS tape.  But from what I understand, there is a ""Ring 3"" in the works, which might be problematic since, in my review for ""Ring 2,"" I said that they went to the well one too many times.  Bad joke perhaps, but hopefully the next film, if there is one, will be as good as the first.But I do believe that this is a top-notch horror movie.  It has all the elements that you're looking for:  sympathetic characters, intrigue, scares, etc.  And for me, I guess that it was filmed in the Seattle area, even parts of Monroe, WA, a town that I lived in for about 13 years.  (I believe that the house in one of the opening scenes was a house in Monroe that was up for sale, but I'm not positive.)  So I will admit that this film was more interesting for me than it might be for you due to the area in which it was filmed.A pretty big recommendation by me if you want a good fright.  Maybe watch ""The Ring 2"" after that, but if you do, watch them in order as I believe the second film requires you to see the first one first.  I don't think that 2 is as disappointing as most of the reviews, so it's worth a peek.",4,It IS a Ringer,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2302,"['just', 'reviewed', 'Ring', '2', 'figured', 'should', 'review', 'first', 'series', 'even', 'been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'watched', 'least', 'twice', 'though', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'mind.But', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'one', 'themes', 'film', 'more', 'question', 'really', 'theme', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'Would', 'be', 'willing', 'throw', 'someone', 'else', 'bus', 'keep', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'probably', 'know', 'videotape', 'film', 'how', 'watching', 'videotape', 'will', 'O.K', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'out', 'spoiler', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'might', 'want', 'throw', 'out', 'donate', 'one', 'particular', 'tape', 'old', 'videotape', 'collection', 'DVD', 'nowadays', 'Better', 'yet', 'how', 'Blu-ray', '1080P', 'always', 'nice', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'still', 'maybe', 'HD', 'streaming', 'Roku', 'box', 'new', '4K', 'technology', 'best', 'still', 'ever', 'less', 'brand', 'new', 'car.This', 'one', 'issues', 'film', 'really', 'sense', 'already', 'become', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'even', 'released', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'Who', 'VHS', 'anymore', 'No', 'one', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'studios', 'release', 'films', 'nowadays', 'VHS', 'tape', 'what', 'understand', 'Ring', '3', 'works', 'might', 'be', 'problematic', 'review', 'Ring', '2', 'said', 'went', 'well', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Bad', 'joke', 'perhaps', 'hopefully', 'next', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first.But', 'do', 'believe', 'top-notch', 'horror', 'movie', 'elements', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'intrigue', 'scares', 'etc', 'guess', 'was', 'filmed', 'Seattle', 'area', 'even', 'parts', 'Monroe', 'WA', 'town', 'lived', '13', 'years', 'believe', 'house', 'one', 'opening', 'scenes', 'was', 'house', 'Monroe', 'was', 'up', 'sale', ""'m"", 'not', 'positive', 'will', 'admit', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'area', 'was', 'filmed.A', 'pretty', 'big', 'recommendation', 'want', 'good', 'fright', 'Maybe', 'watch', 'Ring', '2', 'do', 'watch', 'order', 'believe', 'second', 'film', 'see', 'first', 'one', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '2', 'as', 'disappointing', 'most', 'reviews', 'peek']",The Ring

What I can say is that this was one hell of a movie, and in a way I'm pleased to be able to review it on it's own merit without the influences of another flick in my mind.I went into it with mixed emotions. All have heard the hype of how terrifying or disturbing it is. Since I very very rarely become frightened by the cinema, I tried to rely more on the plot for my expectations. The story itself sounded...weak. A video tape that kills you after seven days??? I didn't see how it could be pulled off.Thankfully I didn't go in expecting the best from all the hype, but in a way the worst, and I turned out very suprised in a positive way.First of all - the story. Wow. Creative as hell, a real mind-twister - Gotta love mysteries. You just had to watch to the end once the movie itself pulled you in - much like what Samara does to her victims. ;) We begin with two teenage girls in a slightly modern, cliche manner and then are cut off to an episode that is supposed to be construed as frightening (for them, not me). We then jump to the character of Rachel, played by the very talented and appealing Naomi Watts, a reported and mother who was an aunt to one of the girls.Her son was negatively affected by his cousins' death and is in many ways more than a simple little boy. He plays the part well - solemn, slightly off the rocker, and perhaps a little psychic. Rachel soon decides the death of her niece is worth a thorough investigation and ventures out into the rest of the tale with a mixture of optismism, skepticism and personal horrors all her own. Her sidekick ex-husband Martin, played by Noah Keller, is very likeable and makes his scenes enjoyable.Truly some surprises along the way, not predictable at all - an intelligent film that doesn't need gore and excess violence to accomplish what it sets out to do.Samara herself is one creepy chick. Throughout the movie you don't really know what to think of her.The end has a shock of its own in store for viewers.
