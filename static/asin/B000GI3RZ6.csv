1004534,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000GI3RZ6,calvinnme,"[160, 167]","Aboard the Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel Red Dwarf, Dave Lister, a lowly 3rd Technician, smuggles aboard a pregnant cat and when he is found out he is confined to suspended animation for refusing to surrender the animal to the captain. During his time in stasis his bunkmate Arnold Rimmer, a lowly 2nd Technician, is forced to perform the maintenence duties without Lister's help and inefficiently repairs the drive plate, causing it to blow and subjecing the entire crew to deadly radiation. 3 million years pass until the background radiation level has dissipated to a safe level. At this point Holly, the ship's computer, releases Lister from stasis and tells him of the accident and also ressurrects Rimmer as a hologram to be a companion for Lister. After the initial shock, Lister realizes that he has the run of the ship, allowing him to be, basically, himself: a layabout slob. Rimmer and Lister discover that the cat had been sealed in the ship's hold during the accident and has bred there for the last 3 million years and evolved into man, one of whom is still on the ship. The rest of the cats mistook Lister's laundry list as navigation instructions to a habitable planet and crashed and died in space. When he discovers his new friend, Lister decides to complete his dream of owning a farm on Fiji and orders Holly to set a course for Earth. Much of this first season involves Rimmer trying to still boss Lister around even though he is just a hologram, the cat coming to grips that he is the last of his kind alive, with Lister constantly trying to get Rimmer to ""turn himself off"" so Lister can keep company with Kochanski's hologram instead. This is because the ship can only support one hologram at a time. Kochanski was the attractive officer Lister was in love with before he went into stasis.The main dramatic thrust of the series from this point forward is Lister's attempt to get back to Earth. Along the way, however, are frequent distractions that usually see the Dwarf crew encountering strange races and lifeforms that have developed in the intervening millions of years. However, a core tenet of the series is that there are no aliens anywhere in the universe -- every element of the large and bizarre mix of intelligent life within the Red Dwarf universe is in one way or another derived from Earth, which is a result of developments in robotics and/or genetic engineering.The crew roster changes as the years go by. During the second season, the Red Dwarf crew encounter the sanitation mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appears in one episode of Season 2, but by the beginning of Season 3 he has become a full time character in the series. At the end of Season 5, disaster strikes when Lister loses Red Dwarf, having forgotten which planet he parked it on. However, we later learn that Red Dwarf was actually stolen. This forces the crew to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two seasons, with the added side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In Season 7, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter-ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension and is everything Rimmer ever wanted to be. Shortly afterwards, the crew find a replacement for Rimmer when they encounter another parallel version of themselves. In this universe, it was Kristine Kochanski -- Lister's long-time crush and ex-girlfriend due to merged realities -- who went into stasis, while Lister died and was brought back as a hologram. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded, and she is forced to join the crew.Finally, in the eighth season, Red Dwarf itself is reconstructed by Kryten's nanobots that had stolen it and broken it down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship -- including Rimmer -- are resurrected, but the Starbug crew all find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig on a set of convoluted charges. The series ends, however, with Red Dwarf being eaten away by a virus and all on board evacuated, save for Rimmer who is left to face Death, in the form of The Grim Reaper, for the second time. Unhappy with his predicament, he knees Death in the groin and runs away -- although the cliffhanger ending leaves this open to interpretation.I really thought that the first five seasons of Red Dwarf were the best. I didn't care for seasons six and seven that much when the crew was traveling in Starbug. The good part of season six is that the role of the Cat was significantly increased to great comedic effect, although the trade-off is that Holly's antics are sorely missed. In season seven Rob Grant, half of the team that had created and written all Red Dwarf episodes, left the show and there was a clear downturn in quality and imagination. Kochanski's addition could not offset the loss of Rimmer, and the show just lost something. Season eight was better, since with the entire crew restored, there was more opportunity for character interaction under completely new circumstances. Chris Barrie is back as Rimmer, and this was certainly a welcome change. In spite of the fact that I am not crazy about seasons six and seven, I would still recommend the entire collection to anyone. It is far funnier and more original than almost anything else you'll ever see on television.",5,One of the funniest and most unique series ever on TV,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,5417,"['Jupiter',

I've been pimping Red Dwarf since the early '90s, but I never had a chance to finish watching the series.  Now that I own the entire collection of episodes of Red Dwarf, and I have finished watching the series, I thoroughly recommend purchasing the Boxed set of DVDs.These DVDs have many extra features, edited and extended scenes, numerous extra bits, hidden features, and humorous additions which provide countless hours of entertainment.No matter how messed-up the world is, or how much the daily news can ruin your day, this Boxed set of Red Dwarf episodes and Bonus materials will brighten your life! If you do not find the series humorous, you might want to check your pulse.I personally feel a deep connection to the sets of the scenes, as well; Commodore geeks from back in the day will smirk often.  In fact, the entire Red Dwarf series is likely to make you laugh and smirk, as well as adopt Red Dwarfisms. When your boss is a jerk, you can just say, ""Smeeee....Smeeee.""  Your coworker will get it, but your boss or Human Resource Manager hopefully will not.  There are a wealth of inside jokes, catchphrases and memorable scenes within the world of the Red Dwarf crew.This boxed edition is well-worth the investment!

I am very impressed with every aspect of this set; the collection was well thought out, and I look forward to inducting more people into the Red Dwarf Cult in the future.

1004547,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000GI3RZ6,Howard M. Kindel,"[1, 2]","While it's not unusual for shows to change over time, it's rare for that change to be driven by creative necessity rather than simply getting better ratings or increasing the demographic base.  Two shows come to mind immediately - both of which I consider to be nothing less than great:  ""Primeval"" and ""Red Dwarf.""  If they were changed merely to give their audience greater titillation or bathos, as most shows are, it wasn't apparent.  These two shows didn't just suddenly get different; they slowly evolved from how they started to how they ended.  And they evolved creatively, in both instances expanding the show's original parameters.  Likewise, in both shows, the harbinger of change was there from the start; it wasn't simply tacked on: in ""Primeval"" it was, of course, Dr. Helen Cutter, whose descent into madness drove the show relentlessly toward its harrowing conclusion; but in ""Red Dwarf"" it wasn't anything as apparent as a character's psyche.  In ""Primeval,"" the evolution is obvious: it began as a ""monster a week"" show then widened its parameters to include an intriguing plot-line which raised it to the level of a psychological thriller.  But in ""Red Dwarf,"" though the change from beginning to end is as enormous as anything in TV history, it's a much subtler process.  You can't really point to a definite season (i.e., series) or a particular episode or character and say ""Ah, that's where it all changed!""Series 1 can best be characterized as having the natural charm of innocence and naivete.  I loved the show from the very first moment.  The four main characters - Dave Lister, Arnold Rimmer, Cat, and Holly the Computer - were absolutely enchanting, with all their quirks and foibles and  vanities.  And though their interaction was awkward and tentative, even at times hostile, they made do with their lot in life: four characters all alone on a spaceship which, according to Holly, would have taken years just to turn around, let alone go anywhere.  Every episode of Series 1 focused on their attempts to establish something approaching a normal life; yet each episode took them a little farther from where they started - as well as farther from anything even approaching normalcy -  leading to the introduction of a fifth character, the android Kryten, in Series 2.  Kryten comes closer than anything else in the entire Series to fitting the standard sit-com prescription of having been added to breathe new life into the show.  However, that's only because he disappeared for the rest of Series 2 and didn't reappear till Series 3, which does make it seem as if the producers wanted to test his audience appeal before they made him a permanent fixture.  And it is true that, once he really got going, he came very close to stealing the show at times.  Just as there's never been a leading man as self-indulgent or uncouth as Dave Lister, or a Hologram as neurotic as Arnold Rimmer, or a computer as obtuse as Holly, there has never been an Android even remotely as goofy or self-effacing as Kryten.  Of course there's simply never been a humanoid evolved from a cat; but even a real cat's vanity and preening wouldn't hold a candle to Cat's.One thing is certain: ""Red Dwarf"" becomes increasingly surreal with each passing Series.  It begins with the death of the entire crew except Lister, who had been locked in stasis for smuggling a cat on board, and Cat, who had evolved in an air shaft which had somehow been protected from radiation; and it ends with the entire crew being reanimated by an army of overzealous nano-bots.  Ironically, but not unexpectedly, life for the original survivors becomes increasingly more harrowing once the crew reappears on the scene.  And, in between, each Series takes the five main characters on one outrageous adventure after another - each adventure fully capable of being developed into an edge-of-your-seat traditional sci-fi show, but in ""Red Dwarf"" developing into a comic nightmare of epic proportions.It's easy to say which are your favorite episodes; but virtually impossible to say which are the best episodes.  From Series 1, ""Confidence & Paranoia"" is one of my favorites - Confidence getting his come-uppance being one of the most hilarious scenes of the entire show.  From Series 4, there's ""Camille,"" which is also one of the very few episodes one might call ""poignant""  - a quality which, except for one or two episodes, mostly disappeared after Series 1.  From Series 5, ""The Inquisitor"" has just about all the elements that make the show great.  ""Tikka to Ride"" from Series 7, besides being hilarious, is quite possibly one of the most ingenious episodes in the history of TV.  And from Series 7 comes ""Blue,"" which has one of the most wonderful sequences of any episode, relating to Kryten's on-going dissatisfaction with the Kochanski from a parallel universe.  From Series 3, my all-time favorite episode: ""The Last Day.""  This is Kryten's crowning glory as a character, what with his notion of ""Silicon Heaven,"" where all the used-up electronic machines go.  And from Series 2, ""Thanks For The Memory"" is my back-up all-time-favorite; plus, it's Holly's crowning glory as a character, especially as he relates his chronology of what seems to have happened.  Then, from Series 4, there is ""Meltdown,"" which shows Rimmer at his worst and Lister at his best; Dave's final observation on the catastrophe Arnold has wrought stands as one of the great anti-war statements of all time and raises this otherwise ordinary episode to a much higher level.Over time, my favorites have changed somewhat.  After six airings and counting, I no longer find it necessary to watch the complete series but to focus on whichever episode I'm in the mood for.  And the ones I now find myself heading for are ""Holoship"" and ""Terrorform"" from Series 5 and ""Ouroboros"" from Series 7.  The beginnings of ""Holoship"" and ""Terrorform"" are absolutely priceless; and ""Ouroboros"" is kind of the ultimate ""feel good"" episode of the entire Series. But as I said, I wouldn't dream of offering these, or any other episodes, as the best ""Red Dwarf"" episodes.  Because they're all great, even my least favorite: ""Demons & Angels"" from Series 5.  And even including ""Demons & Angels,"" I consider Series 5 to be, if not the best then the most characteristic of all eight Series.  If you could only watch one of the eight, I think Series 5 would be it.But by far and away my favorite thing about ""Red Dwarf"" is the anticipation of watching it all over again from the start.  Now well beyond my sixth go-round, the episodes are as fresh, as interesting and as funny as the very first time around.  You can't ask for more in a TV show.",5,Red Dwarf,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,6683,"['not', 'unusual', 'shows', 'change', 'time', 'rare', 'change', 'be', 'driven', 'creative', 'necessity', 'rather',

I made a blind-buy of this box set when Amazon put it on sale for very low price. Having never heard of Red Dwarf prior to the sale, I looked up reviews, which were generally glowing.  My take: it's a great series, and the box set is a great release.Make no mistake though, Red Dwarf is probably not for everyone.  I  highly recommend it to anyone who likes both Star Trek or Doctor Who type of sci-fi and wry British sit-coms (think insult-heavy ""Black Adder"").This is not a sweeping space opera.  Plot takes a back seat to the gag, and the focus is squarely on the characters. Dialogue is well-written, the small cast is appealing, and some of the episode set-ups are quite clever.  As far as the quality of special effects, think of it as a bridge from 1980s ""Doctor Who"" to 2000s ""Doctor Who"".The box set collects the individual season releases, each of which features tons of well-produced features.",5,Sci-fi + sit-com.

I can't say enough about it, and I can't get enough of this show.This is by far the best comedy series I've ever seen, even above Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Rising Damp, and Butterflies. I watched this show every chance I got when they were being re-run on PBS. I missed so many at the time, then I got the set. My wife hates it when I pull these back out and start watching them again, sitting around giggling like an idiot at all the cleverly witty banter and situational comedy these characters get into. It's still as funny today as the first time I saw them. Even the late episodes are great.Some of my favorite lines and scenes came in the later seasons. Like in Duct Soup, Season 7, Ep.4: Cat and Lister are crawling the ductwork of the ship, trying to repair a reactor leak (I believe), and Cat tells Lister he hears a sort of ""swirly, watery, rushing kinda noise"". It turns out to be the raging water of the backwash system that flushes the sewer ducts. A few minutes later, Cat says now that he hears a sorta ""windy, swirly, drying kinda noise"" and a frustrated Lister asks him if he's sure it's not a sorta ""smacking cat upside the head kinda noise"". Trust me, it's a lot funnier on the show and I can't do it justice; but it's one of my favorite scenes.Also, this excerpt, Season 3, Ep.1, where no matter what, Cat is worried about his appearance:LISTER: Fasten your belt.CAT: Hey, I do NOT need fashion tips from YOU.LISTER: SAFETY belt!  (Points out the window) Look!CAT: Is that what I think it is?LISTER: What d'you think it is?CAT: An orange whirly thing in space!LISTER: It's a time hole.  That's where they are.  We're goin' in.CAT: Are you crazy?  You can't go in there!LISTER: Why not?CAT: Orange?! With this suit?!Again, you need to watch the show, it's waaay better.

I had a hard time getting into season 1 when I first tried but will go back now and watch again.  I did not watch this show when it aired, but my husband did and loves it.  He moved to season 3 to get me hooked, and I am.  Now that I have a good feel for the show, we'll go back to season 1 and 2 and I'll try again.  But I have to admit, adding a female in later seasons, especially, the kind of character they created here, was a huge mistake.  It completely changed the dynamic of the show to a predictable comedic format and the kind of situation comedy that's been done to death.  I am saddened by this as I think this was a clever show and had some very funny lines.  It is hard to get past her character for me, and I find myself just wishing the scenes would end.  It's a sad ending for what I consider to be a very funny show, but overall, it's still a great series.  I saw quite a few reviews that mentioned problems with discs, but we haven't experienced that issue.  The menus are the disc aren't very user friendly, and I think those could have been done better, but that's a very minor complaint.  If you are a Red Dwarf fan, it's worth the purchase.

1004565,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000GI3RZ6,Robert Moore,"[6, 8]","This is a series that I very much enjoyed once it hit its stride in Season Three with the addition of the character Kryten to the cast.  I even enjoyed it in Seasons 7 and 8 after the very substantial changes the show underwent.  The first two seasons were hurt by a very low budget, too small of a cast, and extremely low production values.  The budget went up in subsequent seasons, which helped the look of the show and enabled higher production values.  And Robert Llewellyn's Kryten instantly became the most charismatic character on the show, providing the perfect blend to the rest of the cast and serving as the catalyst to make the entire group of characters come together.The series because a very, very different show in Seasons Seven and Eight, partly due to the departure of co-creator Rob Grant and partly due to the change of the show from a sitcom to a dramatic comedy.  In addition, Chris Barrie, who played Rimmer in the first six seasons, left the show on a full time basis in Season Seven, before returning in Season Eight.One thing that doesn't bother me about the series are the numerous continuity errors.  Season Three starts, for instance, with Kryten, who had appeared in an early Season Two episode, as a full fledged member of the crew.  There is never any explanation as to how this happened.  The show has many instances like this.  In the new miniseries, Rimmer is suddenly a hologram again, while in Season Eight he had been a human.  Perhaps I just missed some explanations, but I can't believe I missed all of them.  But really, it doesn't matter.  I think they just realized that a slavish devotion to the premise restricted their options.  The show was never really about story, so a bit of inconsistency never really amounted to anything.I hate to say anything negative about a show that I like, but I have to add that I find the number of five-star ratings to be incomprehensible.  This is a good show.  It is not in my opinion a masterpiece, which is what it would be if it deserved all of the five-star reviews it has received here.  At least half of the seasons of the show were weak at best, and the best did not, in my opinion, come up to the standards of the best comedy shows.  Lest someone reply that I just don't appreciate British humor let me point out that I recently purchased THE FALL AND RISE OF REGINALD PERRIN on DVD, and have long owned MONTY PYTHON and FAWLTY TOWERS.  I got an All Regions DVD player so that I could order all of Alastair Sim's films from Great Britain, which I did.  I also own nearly all of Will Hay's films, as well as the bulk of the Boulting Brothers romps.  But this doesn't mean that I automatically flip out over any and all British humor.I like RED DWARF; I don't love it.  Being the completist that I am, I would nonetheless like to own this on DVD.  And if the set was reasonably priced I might consider it.  But until the cost for the whole thing drops by about 75% it isn't going to happen.Thankfully, the title of this say needs revision and might actually need a lot.  The miniseries RED DWARF: BACK TO EARTH was recently broadcast (and will soon becoming out on DVD).

I was very disappointed with the ending of the show.  They left it at a total cliffhanger.  I have yet to see the ""Back to Earth"" movie but it was so long in between productions that the loose ends should have been tied up better.  I would highly recommend renting it first before buying to see if you like it.",2,Not familiar with British Comdey,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,602,"['So', 'first', 'British', 'comedy', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'characters', 'were', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'series', 'progressed', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'being', 'favorite', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'show', 'left', 'total', 'cliffhanger', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Back', 'Earth', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'productions', 'loose', 'ends', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'up', 'better', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'renting', 'first', 'before', 'buying', 'see', 'like']",Red Dwarf: The Complete Collection

1004569,AJNNNF726KSEA,B000GI3RZ6,"Scott Peterson ""I.T. Sme""","[0, 0]","I've heard about ""Red Dwarf"" for years, but had really no idea what it was about until I watched it recently.  The basic premise is a mining ship is heading out into deep space; the main characters you see are a slacker named Lister and his Napoleon fixated supervisor Remmer.  Lister is put into suspended animation for bringing a pregnant cat onboard, and what he thinks will be a few months is three million years.  Remmer had made a mistake with a radiation shield which failed, irradiating the entire ship and killing everyone but Lister and his cat.  The ship's computer doesn't let Lister out until the radiation has died down, while in the meantime his cat's descendants have evolved into a sentient human like species, while Remmer comes back as a hologram of his former self.The first two seasons were spare, consisting of an Odd Couple arrangement between Lister and Remmer with the computer and the Cat as supporting characters.  It was funny, but not memorable.The third season, however, was where the series took off.  A new character was brought in who had made a cameo appearance before, Kryten the android, and the show show became more of an ensemble performance among the four lead actors with a bigger budget (still puny by US standards), and more adventuresome stories as they left the ship on side adventures and so on.A few things seems odd to American audiences; each season is regarded as a separate series, with very short runs, 6-10 episodes.  While the show's four main actors stayed the same from the third season on, side characters such as the computer changed and there were more twists and turns than in Star Trek, with a good portion of the middle part of the series having them running around the galaxy in a scout ship called a Starbug trying to find the Red Dwarf.While a lot of the jokes are crude or related to sex (Lister is a slob and Remmer is always trying to get a girl), it was done to BBC TV standards so is overall clean--if you ever wondered where the phrase ""smeghead"" came from it was here.Overall this is a very funny show and one you don't want to miss.",5,An overlooked gem,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,2105,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'years', 'had', 'really', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'watched', 'recently', 'basic', 'premise', 'mining', 'ship', 'heading', 'out', 'deep', 'space', 'main', 'characters', 'see', 'are', 'slacker', 'named', 'Lister', 'Napoleon', 'fixated', 'supervisor', 'Remmer', 'Lister', 'put', 'suspended', 'animation', 'bringing', 'pregnant', 'cat', 'onboard', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'months', 'three', 'million', 'years', 'Remmer', 'had', 'made', 'mistake', 'radiation', 'shield', 'failed', 'irradiating', 'entire', 'ship', 'killing', 'everyone', 'Lister', 'cat', 'ship', 'computer', ""n't"", 'let', 'Lister', 'radiation', 'died', 'down', 'meantime', 'cat', 'descendants', 'have', 'evolved', 'sentient', 'human', 'species', 'Remmer', 'back', 'hologram', 'former', 'self.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'spare', 'consisting', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'arrangement', 'Lister', 'Remmer', 'computer', 'Cat', 'supporting', 'characters', 'was', 'funny', 'not', 'memorable.The', 'third', 'season', 'however', 'was', 'where', 'series', 'took', 'off', 'new', 'character', 'was', 'brought', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Kryten', 'android', 'show', 'show', 'became', 'more', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'four', 'lead', 'actors', 'bigger', 'budget', 'still', 'puny', 'US', 'standards', 'more', 'adventuresome', 'stories', 'left', 'ship', 'side', 'adventures', 'so', 'on.A', 'few', 'things', 'odd', 'American', 'audiences', 'season', 'regarded', 'separate', 'series', 'very', 'short', 'runs', '6-10', 'episodes', 'show', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'stayed', 'same', 'third', 'season', 'side', 'characters', 'such', 'computer', 'changed', 'were', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'Star', 'Trek', 'good', 'portion', 'middle', 'part', 'series', 'having', 'running', 'galaxy', 'scout', 'ship', 'called', 'Starbug', 'trying', 'find', 'Red', 'Dwarf.While', 'lot', 'jokes', 'are', 'crude', 'related', 'sex', 'Lister', 'slob', 'Remmer', 'always', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'was', 'done', 'BBC', 'TV', 'standards', 'so', 'overall', 'clean', 'ever', 'wondered', 'where', 'phrase', 'smeghead', 'came', 'was', 'here.Overall', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",Red Dwarf: The Complete Collection

There are many excellent reviews so I won't bother duplicating them. Suffice it to say the shows and the extras included with each series were true to the originals and well worth the cost.The downside, and reason I knocked off two stars (in hopes others would see this warning), is there was a bad disc. I'm pretty sure it was Series 6, the same series others have reported problems with. I was lucky to run through all the shows when they arrived so found it in time to return the collection for a replacement (which worked fine).The problem wasn't a damaged disc from shipment or poor packaging as there was no visible damage. It was more likely a manufacturing or bulk storage (prior to packaging) issue as the surface had an uneven sheen to it that wouldn't buff out.
