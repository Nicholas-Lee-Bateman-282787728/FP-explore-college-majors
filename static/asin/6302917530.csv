Like someone said above, it was eclipsed by the high-profile Brannagh version, but the two are worlds apart.  I admit I had my doubts about Randy Quaid as  the Monster, but he is perfect.  The wonderful framing device with the  icebound ship (taken from the novel, but omitted in the Universal and  Hammer variations) is beautifully filmed.  Making the Monster a true  doppelganger for the tortured Dr. Frankenstein (right down to the chilling  first moments of the creature's life, when he produces the same sick cough  as the doc) is an excellent dramatic device. Experience a Frankenstein like  none before. . .with two great actors and characters &quot;locked in hate  and loathing.&quot;  An overlooked classic.",5,"The best version of the novel, period",933206400,"07 29, 1999",1999,780,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'version', 'first', 'aired', 'TNT', '1993', 'someone', 'said', 'was', 'eclipsed', 'high-profile', 'Brannagh', 'version', 'two', 'are', 'worlds', 'apart', 'admit', 'had', 'doubts', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Monster', 'perfect', 'wonderful', 'framing', 'device', 'icebound', 'ship', 'taken', 'novel', 'omitted', 'Universal', 'Hammer', 'variations', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Making', 'Monster', 'true', 'doppelganger', 'tortured', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'right', 'down', 'chilling', 'first', 'moments', 'creature', 'life', 'when', 'same', 'sick', 'cough', 'doc', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'device', 'Experience', 'Frankenstein', 'none', 'before', '.with', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'characters', 'quot', 'locked', 'hate', 'loathing.', 'quot', 'overlooked', 'classic']",N/A
345434,A1RRR3ICAMMXV7,6302917530,"Darthjal ""Darthjal""","[3, 4]","If you're fond of Mary Shelley's original novel, you'll appreciate this thoughtful made-for-cable rendition, which follows the original more faithfully and seriously than the Karloff version. It tells the entire  story laid out in the novel, which was split (and generously embellished)  into &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; to  create Boris Karloff's most unforgettable role.If you prefer  old-fashioned monster movies with all the fun cheesiness that entails, you  may be disappointed with this version. There are no miniature people  presided over by a cackling Dr. Praetorius, and if you thought the joy on  the monster's face when drinking and smoking was the best part of Karloff's  Frankenstein, nothing here will measure up. It's a very good movie, but  it's heavier than the Universal classic.Randy Quaid, who has made a  career of portraying oversized misfits with pathos (see &quot;Of Mice and  Men&quot;), again displays his spectacular but underrated mastery in his  role as the monster. Patrick Bergin is convincing as the creepy yet  sympathetic Dr. Frankenstein, and the other actors support the story  well.Overall, an excellent addition to your video library if you prefer  a more sober interpretation of Shelley's story to the classic monster movie  interpretation; or if you're just plain nuts about Frankenstein and his  monster.",4,Randy Quaid Strikes Again!,951177600,"02 22, 2000",2000,1381,"[""'re"", 'fond', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'original', 'novel', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'thoughtful', 'made-for-cable', 'rendition', 'original', 'more', 'faithfully', 'seriously', 'Karloff', 'version', 'entire', 'story', 'laid', 'out', 'novel', 'was', 'split', 'generously', 'embellished', 'quot', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'create', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'role.If', 'prefer', 'old-fashioned', 'monster', 'movies', 'fun', 'cheesiness', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'version', 'are', 'miniature', 'people', 'presided', 'over', 'cackling', 'Dr.', 'Praetorius', 'thought', 'joy', 'monster', 'face', 'when', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'Karloff', 'Frankenstein', 'nothing', 'here', 'will', 'measure', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'heavier', 'Universal', 'classic.Randy', 'Quaid', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'portraying', 'oversized', 'misfits', 'pathos', 'see', 'quot', 'Mice', 'Men', 'quot', 'again', 'spectacular', 'underrated', 'mastery', 'role', 'monster', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'convincing', 'creepy', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'other', 'actors', 'support', 'story', 'well.Overall', 'excellent', 'addition', 'video', 'library', 'prefer', 'more', 'sober', 'interpretation', 'Shelley', 'story', 'classic', 'monster', 'movie', 'interpretation', ""'re"", 'just', 'plain', 'nuts', 'Frankenstein', 'monster']",N/A

345436,A30SEFSHDK5RX,6302917530,Matthew C. Lupoli,"[6, 6]","I remember seeing this when it was first broadcast on TNT in 1993. I recently rented it and remembered how good it was all over again. My favorite film version of Frankenstein is the 1931 version with Boris Karloff. Of the modern versions, I like the Kenneth Branaugh (1994) version and this one. This version is more faithful to the Mary Shelley novel than most other versions. Randy Quaid was magnificent as the monster, and in my opinion did a better job than Robert De Niro in the 1994 version. This film shows what a serious and gifted actor Quaid can be. The major difference from the novel is the creation of the creature. Mary Shelley never actually said that electricity brought the creature to life but she did say that the creature was stitched together from corpses. In this film, Frankenstein constructs a tank filled with a liquid that is made up of the elements of life. He uses this as a sort of cloning machine to make a stronger, wiser, and better version of himself. Electricity makes it work. Something goes wrong during the creation. The creature is strong, but he wasn't exactly formed all the way, thus giving him a hideous appearance. The creators of this film touch upon a concept that was fashionable to put into Frankenstein stage plays in the late 1800s / early 1900s. Frankenstein and the monster are versions of the same character, like Jekyll & Hyde. Since the monster is a clone of Frankenstein, they feel each others feelings and pains. They are the yin and yang of each other. When the monster is shot with a gun, Frankenstein feels the pain of the shot and a strange bruise appears on his chest. I liked how they touched on this concept. There are a few other differences from the novel as well, but no more than there are in the Branaugh version. One of the major differneces in that version is that Frankenstein actually does make a bride for the creature (an event that doesn't happen in the novel.) I think that if the creators of both films collaborated together, then they could have made one hell of a Frankenstein film. This is a must-own for any fan of ""Frankenstein.""",5,Faithful to the novel,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,2112,"['remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'TNT', '1993', 'recently', 'rented', 'remembered', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'over', 'again', 'favorite', 'film', 'version', 'Frankenstein', '1931', 'version', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'modern', 'versions', 'like', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', '1994', 'version', 'one', 'version', 'more', 'faithful', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'novel', 'most', 'other', 'versions', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'was', 'magnificent', 'monster', 'opinion', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', '1994', 'version', 'film', 'what', 'serious', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Quaid', 'can', 'be', 'major', 'difference', 'novel', 'creation', 'creature', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'never', 'actually', 'said', 'electricity', 'brought', 'creature', 'life', 'did', 'say', 'creature', 'was', 'stitched', 'together', 'corpses', 'film', 'Frankenstein', 'tank', 'filled', 'liquid', 'made', 'elements', 'life', 'sort', 'cloning', 'machine', 'make', 'stronger', 'wiser', 'better', 'version', 'Electricity', 'work', 'Something', 'wrong', 'creation', 'creature', 'strong', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'formed', 'way', 'thus', 'giving', 'hideous', 'appearance', 'creators', 'film', 'touch', 'concept', 'was', 'fashionable', 'put', 'Frankenstein', 'stage', 'plays', 'late', '1800s', '/', 'early', '1900s', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'are', 'versions', 'same', 'character', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'monster', 'clone', 'Frankenstein', 'feel', 'others', 'feelings', 'pains', 'are', 'yin', 'yang', 'other', 'When', 'monster', 'shot', 'gun', 'Frankenstein', 'pain', 'shot', 'strange', 'bruise', 'chest', 'liked', 'how', 'touched', 'concept', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'differences', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'are', 'Branaugh', 'version', 'One', 'major', 'differneces', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'actually', 'make', 'bride', 'creature', 'event', ""n't"", 'happen', 'novel', 'think', 'creators', 'films', 'collaborated', 'together', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'hell', 'Frankenstein', 'film', 'must-own', 'fan', 'Frankenstein']",N/A

Having just ordered the book, I look forward to seeing how ""close"" they really came to following the storyline. It's very possible Mary Shelley would've have been pleased with this version and Kenneth Branaugh's. I guess I'll know after reading the book. The bigger question is, can this version be a stand in for the book? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't enjoyable. Patrick Bergin who plays the doctor does a decent job, but Randy Quaid as the monster makes the movie his. Showing the lonliness, the compassion, and of course the anger after being abandoned by Victor was performed very well. He was only violent when he felt threatened by man, few people were nice to him, granted, but as the saying goes ""you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.""Of course, back in those days, it was much easier to mistake malice for confusion.Final note: I don't know why so many had such problems with the version right after this one, yeah, they added some parts, but that didn't hurt the story for me.
