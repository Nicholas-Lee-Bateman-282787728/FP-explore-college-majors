102773,A2FQ3K6PR86U62,0790734583,Alyosha,"[1, 1]","In the annals of American action films this one definately deserves a spot at the top up alongside the Die Hard films though maybe a small step below something like the Terminator.  Some will say this is just a Segal propaganda piece showcasing him in all his glory instead of an action film but if you've seen the rest of his films you'll know that the self-gratification and machoism found here is tame by Segal standards.  There isn't all the usual inuendos about what an incredibly 'large' man Steven is, or the thinly veiled sexual assaults on weaker men you'll find in On Deadly Ground or Fire Down Below.  This is just a straight-up cop-on-a-rampage-constitutional-rights-thrown-out-the-window type of movie.  Rights are for pansies anyways.This was back when Segal actually fought in his films instead of just shooting a bunch of people.  Oh, there's plenty of that but there's some great aikido, great hand-to-hand combat mixed in there as well.  Of course he's squinting up a storm and running like a duck with it's head chopped off in the midst of all this carnage, but hey, it's Segal!  He doesn't live by our rules.The plot?  Who cares!  I'm too busy watching Segal force a United States Senator to undress, destroy an entire grocery shop, and empty a clip into the face of an unarmed criminal at point blank range.  I think there was some stuff in there about him wanting to bring down a CIA led drug cartel.  All around I would say that this was Segal's most compelling movie.Most important lesson to take from this film: It's common protocol in the CIA to use local bar owners to take out other agents.",4,This One Is Actually Believable,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1618,"['annals', 'American', 'action', 'films', 'one', 'definately', 'spot', 'top', 'up', 'alongside', 'Die', 'Hard', 'films', 'maybe', 'small', 'step', 'something', 'Terminator', 'will', 'say', 'just', 'Segal', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'showcasing', 'glory', 'instead', 'action', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rest', 'films', ""'ll"", 'know', 'self-gratification', 'machoism', 'found', 'here', 'tame', 'Segal', 'standards', ""n't"", 'usual', 'inuendos', 'what', 'incredibly', ""'large"", 'man', 'Steven', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'weaker', 'men', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'just', 'straight-up', 'cop-on-a-rampage-constitutional-rights-thrown-out-the-window', 'type', 'movie', 'Rights', 'are', 'pansies', 'anyways.This', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'Segal', 'actually', 'fought', 'films', 'instead', 'just', 'shooting', 'bunch', 'people', 'Oh', 'plenty', 'great', 'aikido', 'great', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'mixed', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'squinting', 'up', 'storm', 'running', 'duck', 'head', 'chopped', 'off', 'midst', 'carnage', 'hey', 'Segal', ""n't"", 'live', 'rules.The', 'plot', 'Who', ""'m"", 'too', 'busy', 'watching', 'Segal', 'force', 'United', 'States', 'Senator', 'undress', 'destroy', 'entire', 'grocery', 'shop', 'empty', 'clip', 'face', 'unarmed', 'criminal', 'point', 'blank', 'range', 'think', 'was', 'stuff', 'wanting', 'bring', 'down', 'CIA', 'led', 'drug', 'cartel', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'Segal', 'most', 'compelling', 'movie.Most', 'important', 'lesson', 'take', 'film', 'common', 'protocol', 'CIA', 'use', 'local', 'bar', 'owners', 'take', 'out', 'other', 'agents']",N/A

It had stood that way for the next three films: Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, and Out for Justice. Somehow, the quality of his films started to subside after Under Siege, and then Steven Seagal hit the nadir of his movie career by starring in straight-to-DVD releases. Regardless, Steven Seagal has always remained a memorable actor largely due to his distinctive style: his hair, his eyes, the bone-breaking Aikido movements, the way he holds his gun, the way he runs like a girl, and the energy he brings out of himself. That is why I love watching his movies, and I am always entertained. In that manner, I find myself revisiting his movies from to time just because they are fun to watch. Above the Law is one of those films I love seeing repeatedly, and I think it is almost as best as Steven Seagal has done in his career. I reserve the opinion that Hard to Kill is easily the best work of his career. When I see Above the Law especially of the introduction, it makes me to want to see a three hour bio-pic of Steven Seagal because I think it was a fascinating life that he once led. Of course, the best part about Above the Law is the Aikido movements that are just performed flawlessly and so mellifluous. One funny thing about him is that I know he can do that, but must he run like a girl? It's so funny in a cute way. A good scene, and pretty cool at that, is after when Steven Seagal extracts the name ""Bautista Salvano"" from the whimpering Latino, the heavy set white guy in a black shirt comes to Seagal, and he gets knocked down with a punch. Any time Seagal does the traditional Aikido moves, I couldn't help but watch them in awe. He is just so good at it, and that's another reason why I always revisit his movies. Watching him take on five or more guys is the stuff of macho films, but watching him to really do it is makes his films to be at a totally different level. That's why Steven Seagal is a household name. Now, his career is pretty much dead for several unverified reasons, and I haven't seen any of his new films made after 2002. The last recent film I saw of his was Half Past Dead, and I just couldn't believe how bad it was. All in all, to see the best of Steven Seagal is to see Above the Law, and watch it again and again. I am improving the rating of Above the Law from `5' to `8' because I found the story behind the film so well done. Oddly, Henry Silva, the dude who does chemical interrogation, did a film called The Manchurian Candidate in which Above the Law is so similar to, and at the same time, Silva got involved in Steven Seagal-like scene with Frank Sinatra as well as he did with Seagal for Above the Law. All in all, Above the Law is one of the best action flick ever made. I am pretty sure, from the looks of him, that Steven Seagal did all of the stunts himself.

In his case, he's an aikido  expert, and that's hard to explain. Most martial arts movies talk about  Kung Fu and Tae Kwan Do where people punch and kick and you can generally  tell what's going on. Aikido, on the other hand, is about redirecting an  opponent, making him basically want to fall down. In the movie, it looks a  lot like a bad guy rushes as Seagal, he touches them with his little finger  and then they decide to throw themselves in the air in ways you thought  were impossible. The moves take, oh, about two seconds to perform, with  Seagal's part being only about 2 microseconds. If you want to watch Seagal  in classic aikido action, be prepared to pause, slow motion and rewind.  It's amazing looking and absolutley bizzare (since being marveled by the  movie, i have gone out and studied aikido, and it seems even more  impressive, although realistic, now)The movie's about an ex-CIA officer  turned Chicago cop (and, in my opinion, an extremely unlikeable one; that  macho Italian family man thing to me just looks like a dull-witted bully  control freak). He runs into some old CIA friends from 'nam who are doing  naughty thingsThis movie has a plot, and a darn good one at that. It's a  very, very interesting movie, much unlike, say, all the big budget movies  he did after this one. While his later movies are bad jokes, new age  mantras and B-movies, this one is really, really good. There are only a  realistic number of fight scenes (gosh, i wish there were more, but that  would have changed it from a drama to an action film, which this really  isn't), but they are wonderfulBottom line, this movie is awesome. i  don't know if Seagal wrote and directed the later films he did (he was  close to a one man production company on this one), but i wish he'd turn  down those big budget formula films he's been doing and go back to doing  the realistic, semi-autobiographical films like this one.

It's a brief view of Mr. Seagal running an Aikido class and demonstrating technique.  Since he is wearing a hakama, his footwork is hard to follow (which is the purpose), and the motions are extreme, but it is interesting to watch.  I'd even be willing to bet that the freestyle sparring is neither choreographed or the blows pulled.  For that bit alone, the movie is worth purchasing.There are a few problems that might cause the purist to cringe.  The goal of Aikido is to execute technique with a minimum of movement, and it is not intended to be as agressive as it is in this movie.Nevertheless, this is a very good movie.  Enough plot to fill the space between the fight scenes, and the fight scenes are very well executed.  As has been pointed out, you realy need to watch the scenes in slow motion to appreciate them, but that's half the fun.Steven Seagal tends to try much too hard, and there are moments where it's just a bit cheesy, but you can't have everything.This is a must view for someone who appreciates the &quot;art&quot; in martial arts (the technique is amazing!), and is probably pretty decent (though a bit slow) for the action movie fan.",4,Neat story,973900800,"11 11, 2000",2000,1246,"['Personally', 'find', 'first', 'three', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'absolute', 'best', 'brief', 'view', 'Mr.', 'Seagal', 'running', 'Aikido', 'class', 'demonstrating', 'technique', 'wearing', 'hakama', 'footwork', 'hard', 'follow', 'purpose', 'motions', 'are', 'extreme', 'interesting', 'watch', ""'d"", 'even', 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'freestyle', 'sparring', 'choreographed', 'blows', 'pulled', 'bit', 'alone', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'might', 'cause', 'purist', 'cringe', 'goal', 'Aikido', 'execute', 'technique', 'minimum', 'movement', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'as', 'agressive', 'movie.Nevertheless', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Enough', 'plot', 'fill', 'space', 'fight', 'scenes', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'realy', 'need', 'watch', 'scenes', 'slow', 'motion', 'appreciate', 'fun.Steven', 'Seagal', 'try', 'much', 'too', 'hard', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'just', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything.This', 'must', 'view', 'someone', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'martial', 'arts', 'technique', 'amazing', 'probably', 'pretty', 'decent', 'bit', 'slow', 'action', 'movie', 'fan']",N/A

I remember being thrilled seeing it in the theater. As a martial arts instructor, I was awed by the resemblance of Ai Ki Do to T'ai Ch'i--Seagal, as he explained in an interview then, was trying to show American audiences what AI Ki Do is and how it works. As with so many others, Seagal inspired me to go out and learn Ai Ki Do--I even became the dojo priest.Seagal, being 36, is slim, only slightly balding and ""too pretty to be a meat packer"" for sure. Though he has a substantial tush (problem shared with John Wayne, that's OK) he looks lithe and is well-muscled. The action is too slow for me, too much car and gun, yet it works.Seagal premiers as Nico Toscani, a Chicago cop with a sweet female black partner. He was in Viet Nam--who wasn't back then--and still has CIA enemies and a surprising friend. Lots of killing and a fuzzy storyline about the CIA having too much power, a senator who seems to want to do something about something...best of all of this soup is Seagal's concluding voice-over preaching about why an agency should never be above the law. Powerful stuff for the late 1980s.Now for all the young whippersnappers out there: don't say this is Seagal's ""best"" film. His best films were ""The Patriot"" and ""Glimmer Man"". Remember this is his first film, the year is 1988, before many of you were born, so this is the Genesis of Seagal--the man many of us said would be the ""next Bruce Lee"". That didn't happen...so what? This is one of his best films, his very first, and it created a new genre. That along with the martial arts he uses were things never before seen. Seagal had made an overnight name for himself.So in light of this film, and I recommend the whole world watch this movie, I say let's give Seagal a break. He'll be 60 years old soon. I know what the feeling is. He's been badly injured many times--I know that well also. He's apparently lost his voice, and is still nursing the wound of being totally bald on top. I shave my head as a Buddhist cleric, so I do know what it's like to be bald. I do not know what it is like to wear a tormented, ugly Dracula wig. And today Seagal is also nursing an awful ""beer"" belly that won't go away, another point of commiseration between us.Just don't forget to see and STUDY this film, because it is the Genesis of Seagal the Legend, even if that is now gone and Seagal is considered a joke. I say stick with him, he is a reincarnated lama and you don't want to be reborn as a goat for dissing a respected Buddhist cleric, do you??",5,Let Seagal Be Explained in His Genesis,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2594,"['film', 'filmed', '1987', 'when', 'Seagal', 'was', '36', 'film', 'debut', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'remember', 'being', 'thrilled', 'seeing', 'theater', 'martial', 'arts', 'instructor', 'was', 'awed', 'resemblance', 'Ai', 'Ki', 'Do', ""T'ai"", 'Ch', 'i', 'Seagal', 'explained', 'interview', 'then', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'American', 'audiences', 'what', 'AI', 'Ki', 'Do', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Seagal', 'inspired', 'go', 'out', 'learn', 'Ai', 'Ki', 'Do', 'even', 'became', 'dojo', 'priest.Seagal', 'being', '36', 'slim', 'only', 'slightly', 'balding', 'too', 'pretty', 'be', 'meat', 'packer', 'sure', 'substantial', 'tush', 'problem', 'shared', 'John', 'Wayne', 'OK', 'lithe', 'well-muscled', 'action', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'much', 'car', 'gun', 'premiers', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'sweet', 'female', 'black', 'partner', 'was', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'back', 'then', 'still', 'CIA', 'enemies', 'surprising', 'friend', 'Lots', 'killing', 'fuzzy', 'storyline', 'CIA', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'senator', 'who', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'something', 'best', 'soup', 'Seagal', 'concluding', 'voice-over', 'preaching', 'why', 'agency', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'law', 'Powerful', 'stuff', 'late', '1980s.Now', 'young', 'whippersnappers', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Seagal', 'best', 'film', 'best', 'films', 'were', 'Patriot', 'Glimmer', 'Man', 'Remember', 'first', 'film', 'year', '1988', 'many', 'were', 'born', 'Genesis', 'Seagal', 'man', 'many', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'so', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'very', 'first', 'created', 'new', 'genre', 'martial', 'arts', 'were', 'things', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'Seagal', 'had', 'made', 'overnight', 'name', 'himself.So', 'light', 'film', 'recommend', 'whole', 'world', 'watch', 'movie', 'say', 'let', 'give', 'Seagal', 'break', ""'ll"", 'be', '60', 'years', 'old', 'soon', 'know', 'what', 'feeling', 'been', 'badly', 'injured', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'well', 'also', 'apparently', 'lost', 'voice', 'still', 'nursing', 'wound', 'being', 'totally', 'bald', 'top', 'shave', 'head', 'Buddhist', 'cleric', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'bald', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'wear', 'tormented', 'ugly', 'Dracula', 'wig', 'today', 'Seagal', 'also', 'nursing', 'awful', 'beer', 'belly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'point', 'commiseration', 'us.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'see', 'STUDY', 'film', 'Genesis', 'Seagal', 'Legend', 'even', 'now', 'gone', 'Seagal', 'considered', 'joke', 'say', 'stick', 'reincarnated', 'lama', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'reborn', 'goat', 'dissing', 'respected', 'Buddhist', 'cleric', 'do']",N/A

DOBBS,"[0, 1]","ABOVE THE LAW is one of my favorite of those great late 80's cop films along with LETHAL WEAPON [1987] & THE UNTOUCHABLES [1987], although, of course, not in their class. However, considering it was Seagal's first film it was surprisingly well done. He plays a pony-tailed maverick Chicago cop with a great name [Nico Toscani] and an unconventional way of doing his job---using  martial arts to batter the truth out of suspected criminals. Early on it's an F-word festival with bars, bartenders and bar patrons getting wrecked and a young druggie---who has corrupted his neice---getting slapped around mercilessly by the on-a-mission Toscani. Toscani's partner is played by the looking-better-with-age vet Pam Grier. They are after a gang of LETHAL WEAPON-like ex military sociopaths who deal in drugs. The bad guys are led by Henry Silva who early in his career was fantastic as a young psychotic cowpoke in the great but underrated Western THE TALL T [1957]. Silva, steely-eyed and ruthless throughout, has a great line early on in the film as he responds to Seagal questioning the torture of an innocent prisoner---you have to look this one up yourself. A young Sharon Stone is here---her natural talent was evident even then as she gives a sharp performance despite little screen time. Raw Chicago locations give this movie a natural and authentic feel. Everybody seemed to be on their game for this one probably due to Andrew Davis' direction---he also directed Seagal's only other very good film the greatly entertaining but underachieving UNDER SEIGE [1992] as well as THE FUGITIVE [1993]. Just gotta love Toscani's crusty older [ex-cop?] pal who provides him with firearms and bodyguards his family when the force suspends him and takes away his gun & badge. How about Toscani getting ambushed by a carload of local thugs, sent by Silva, in broad daylight. Great scene here as he takes them all on and methodically puts each of them out of service. In another memorable scene a friend of one of the ambushers whom Toscani has battered confronts him only to be clocked with a fist to the chest---the burly guy goes down like a chopped redwood. And in another memorable scene Toscani, who has just been confronted in  a convenience store by another party of thugs sent by Silva, destroys both [the guys and the store] but is subsequently confronted outside by some real armed pros. One of the gangsters, backed by some major metal, is a little too boisterous in pointing out the futility of Toscani's chances and receives a rather terse and emphatic response---again, see it yourself. Purgative urban escapist fun with the already hammy Seagal, not as impervious as in later films, getting slapped around for once. Overall, a great 'vent' flick after a long week at the office with lots of fun lines & scenes, fine acting, very entertaining, although not for everyone's taste.

Seagal plays Nicola Toscani, a ludicrously-named ex-CIA cop (as are virtually all Seagal characters) with family in the Mafia. Seagal conjured up the story (which was then expanded, of all people, by Steven Pressfield and Ronald Shusett) and it's probably his first effort at ego-massage. The opening narration is semi-biographical and the beginning of Seagal confusing fantasy and reality.The plot, despite being from 1988, still comes across as contemporary and relevant. Nico quits the CIA in the 'Nam after witnessing a crooked superior taking advantage of the war to become a drug baron. Many years later he encounters that same villain who is abusing his status of being 'above the law' to seize more drug territory and pump more drug money into the CIA. War is always profitable.It would be an intriguing plot for a 135-minute movie. But Above the Law tries to cram it all into 99 minutes and in the style of early 80s Charles Bronson. Don't get me wrong, Andrew Davis has always had muscular direction and takes the material seriously, but the heavy story and ambitious commentary are mostly squandered for the sake of making sure the credits roll after an hour and a half. The ending seems rushed, leaving just a little to much confusion and too many dots unconnected.Still, it's interesting to see Seagal young, thin, and talking clearly.The Blu Ray looks good in 1.78:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound.

102800,A9LSLYQW28X6H,0790734583,Jeff Van Gastel,"[0, 0]","This movie is Steven Seagal's first and best.  ""Above the Law"" features Steven Seagal as Nico Toscani.  A tough, edgy police officer who once was a Special Ops agent in the Vietnam War.  The movie starts off as a montage of moments early in Nico's life.(which coincidentally mirrors Seagal's own youth).  From there, we move onto the Vietnam War, and then to present day Chicago of 1988.  Nico is partnered with Dolores Jackson (Pam Grier) as they become involved in a case involving a drug shipment.  When the bad guys are busted, the Chicago police and the Feds discover a cache of C-4 explosives.  Eventually, Nico and Dolores discover a CIA conspiracy where they are dealing in narcotics trafficking to fund their covert operations.  A Central American priest has paperwork to bust this operation, and it is up to Nico to uncover this dastardly plot.Steven Seagal gives his best performance of his dubious career as he plays a relentless cop trying to bust the villains.  Pam Grier is his supportive partner.  Sharon Stone is also in the film as Seagal's wife.  And the main villain is Henry Silva (Zagon), who has played numerous villains in the various films he has been in.The fight scenes are very believable, with things and people being broken constantly.  My favorite scenes are the aikido sparring session at the beginning, and when the 4 busters pull up in a convertible to confront Nico.  The scene ends with this huge guy coming up to Nico, and he fells him with a double blow to the chest and stomach.DVD Extra's:* The Special Features section is a bit thin.  The ""Cast & Crew"" has some bios on the various actors.  It was interesting that the opening scene of the movie followed Steven Seagal's youth, and that Seagal has black belts in Karate, Aikido, and Kendo.  ""Behind the Scenes"" just featured a couple of pages of text on the movie.  ""Theatrical Trailers"" had 8 trailers of Steven Seagal movies.I have always enjoyed this movie.  Each time I watch it, I pick up some more dialogue from this movie.  There are actually some hilarious one-liners from some of the background actors if you pay attention.  I am not sure about the Blu-ray extra's, but the extra's on the DVD are not good.

102808,A2Y73NXRJX1NR4,0790734583,"M. Eads ""Lizel""","[1, 1]","MY OPINION OF THIS FILM:Steven Segal, particularly in his leaner, younger, years, provided some of the best real-as-life martial arts moves ever seen on film.  Of the many entertaining movies he has played, really only four or five stand out as greats, and this is one of them.FILM BACKGROUND INFORMATION:Years ago, when I first saw this earlier movie, I was surprised to learn that Seagal developed, co-wrote, co-produced, choreographed, and debuted in this action thriller-- a cop film with more attitude than plot, but WHAT A RIDE WATCHING IT.  Those fast hands and moves of his were real folks, so prepare to push your lower jaw back up to you your mouth as you watch in awe!STORY:Seagal is Nico Toscani, an Italian immigrant, American patriot, ex-CIA agent, aikido specialist, and unorthodox Chicago policeman. He is as committed to his job as he is to his personalized brand of justice...tough, and fair, and expert in thorough bone-crushing when it's called for.  Yet, he is not a bully.  When the FBI orders his squad to ignore the mysterious shipment of military explosives they seized from a notorious narcotics dealer, Nico defiantly pursues his own investigation. With the help of his partner Jax (Pam Grier), he sifts through a tangled web of Catholic priests, illegal immigrants, and trained assassins to uncover a drug cartel run directly out of the CIA by an official named Zagon Henry Silva. Nico remembers the man from his CIA days in Vietnam, when Zagon used the agency (and the war) as a front for smuggling opium. At the time, Nico was too outranked to thwart him, but he will no longer let Zagon abuse his position to remain immune from prosecution -- especially now that the official has plans to murder a U.S. senator. Zagon may be above the law of most men, but he is certainly not above Nico's.COMMENTS TO THE READER:Anyone liking Steven Segal movies, thriller-action cop movies, or realistic martial arts should rent or buy this movie.

102809,A2E9TRM8096BXU,0790734583,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[1, 1]","It may seem strange today, but there was a time when Steven Seagal was considered the Next Big Thing in Hollywood - not merely as an action star, but as a movie star, period. If this strikes you as ridiculous, you're probably too young to remember ABOVE THE LAW, an outstanding 1988 film from director Andrew Davis and writers Steven Pressfield and Ronald Schusett. This is one bad mother of a film -- intelligent, intricate, and as brutal as a chop to the kidneys.LAW is the story of Nicola ""Nico"" Toscani (Seagal), a mob-connected Chicago narcotics detective with a very checkered past. As a young man, Toscani's skill at the Japanese martial art of aikido got him embroiled with CIA agent Nelson Fox (Chelsea Ross), who took him to Vietnam to work various ""black bag"" operations. Toscani left the Agency in disgust after encountering a vicious psycho named Kurt Zagon (Henry Silva) who was running opium under the CIA banner. Cut to many years later, when a drug bust on the streets of Chicago, led by Toscani and his partner Delores ""Jacks"" Jackson (Pam Grier), turns up what seems to be a connection between Columbian drug lord Tony Salvano (Daniel Faraldo) and the local FBI office, run by Special Agent Neely (Nicholas Kusenko). Ordered to stand down by the Feds, the hotheaded Toscani instead begins his own, private investigation of Salvano, which in turn brings down the wrath of...well, just about everyone in the City of Chicago who can trigger a bomb, pull a trigger or pick up a machete. Whatever is going on in the Windy City, the stakes must be very high indeed, because neither Toscani's police badge nor his Mafia relations can bail him out of this one. This time, he's on his own.ABOVE THE LAW is a very strong film whose main weakness is, ironically, not Steven Seagal but Nicola Toscani. As cinematic heroes go, Nico works on paper - he's tough as nails, fearless as a lion, dangerous as the plague, and unlike most movie cops  is not ""a man alone"" but rather part of a huge and fiercely protective family (that includes wife Sharon Stone). The trouble is, he's also a bully. Instead of merely using violence as means to an end, he seems to genuinely enjoy pushing around weaker men, getting in their faces, intimidating them, making them suffer indignity and pain. What's more, though the movie boast a pretty impressive array of bad guys - Chicago Outfit boys, Columbian drug dealers, renegade CIA agents - Toscani has no ""opposite number"" to really test him in hand-to-hand combat. Setting a pattern for all his following films, the fight sequences, while spectacular and vicious, are totally one-sided. In the entire movie, Nico does not take a single punch, and believe me, by the end credits, I was longing for him to take two.Having said that, I still consider ABOVE THE LAW to be a first-class film, rising above the limitations of cop movies and action flicks to take its place among the better movies turned out in the 1980s. If Seagal never came remotely close to achieving this level again, and ended up a pudgy, pretentious weirdo with horrible taste in clothing, doomed to churn out direct-to-video dreck for the rest of his life, he can always look back over his piles of money to a time when he was about to take Hollywood...by way of Chicago.",4,"""You guys think you're above the law; well you ain't above mine.""",1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,3280,"['may', 'seem', 'strange', 'today', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'was', 'considered', 'Next', 'Big', 'Thing', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'merely', 'action', 'star', 'movie', 'star', 'period', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'probably', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'ABOVE', 'THE', 'LAW', 'outstanding', '1988', 'film', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'writers', 'Steven', 'Pressfield', 'Ronald', 'Schusett', 'one', 'bad', 'mother', 'film', 'intelligent', 'intricate', 'as', 'brutal', 'chop', 'kidneys.LAW', 'story', 'Nicola', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'Seagal', 'mob-connected', 'Chicago', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'very', 'checkered', 'past', 'young', 'man', 'Toscani', 'skill', 'Japanese', 'martial', 'art', 'aikido', 'got', 'embroiled', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Nelson', 'Fox', 'Chelsea', 'Ross', 'who', 'took', 'Vietnam', 'work', 'various', 'black', 'bag', 'operations', 'Toscani', 'left', 'Agency', 'disgust', 'encountering', 'vicious', 'psycho', 'named', 'Kurt', 'Zagon', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'opium', 'CIA', 'banner', 'Cut', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'drug', 'bust', 'streets', 'Chicago', 'led', 'Toscani', 'partner', 'Jacks', 'Jackson', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'up', 'what', 'be', 'connection', 'Columbian', 'drug', 'lord', 'Tony', 'Salvano', 'Daniel', 'Faraldo', 'local', 'FBI', 'office', 'run', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Neely', 'Nicholas', 'Kusenko', 'Ordered', 'stand', 'down', 'Feds', 'hotheaded', 'Toscani', 'instead', 'own', 'private', 'investigation', 'Salvano', 'turn', 'brings', 'down', 'wrath', 'well', 'just', 'everyone', 'City', 'Chicago', 'who', 'can', 'trigger', 'bomb', 'pull', 'trigger', 'pick', 'up', 'machete', 'going', 'Windy', 'City', 'stakes', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'Toscani', 'police', 'badge', 'Mafia', 'relations', 'can', 'bail', 'one', 'time', 'own.ABOVE', 'THE', 'LAW', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'main', 'weakness', 'ironically', 'not', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Nicola', 'Toscani', 'cinematic', 'heroes', 'go', 'Nico', 'paper', 'tough', 'nails', 'fearless', 'lion', 'dangerous', 'plague', 'most', 'movie', 'cops', 'not', 'man', 'alone', 'rather', 'part', 'huge', 'fiercely', 'protective', 'family', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'trouble', 'also', 'bully', 'Instead', 'merely', 'using', 'violence', 'means', 'end', 'genuinely', 'enjoy', 'pushing', 'weaker', 'men', 'getting', 'intimidating', 'making', 'suffer', 'indignity', 'pain', 'What', 'more', 'movie', 'boast', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'array', 'bad', 'guys', 'Chicago', 'Outfit', 'Columbian', 'drug', 'dealers', 'renegade', 'CIA', 'agents', 'Toscani', 'opposite', 'number', 'really', 'test', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'Setting', 'pattern', 'following', 'films', 'fight', 'sequences', 'spectacular', 'vicious', 'are', 'totally', 'one-sided', 'entire', 'movie', 'Nico', 'not', 'take', 'single', 'punch', 'believe', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'longing', 'take', 'two.Having', 'said', 'still', 'consider', 'ABOVE', 'THE', 'LAW', 'be', 'first-class', 'film', 'rising', 'limitations', 'cop', 'movies', 'action', 'flicks', 'take', 'place', 'better', 'movies', 'turned', 'out', '1980s', 'Seagal', 'never', 'came', 'remotely', 'close', 'achieving', 'level', 'again', 'ended', 'up', 'pudgy', 'pretentious', 'weirdo', 'horrible', 'taste', 'clothing', 'doomed', 'churn', 'out', 'direct-to-video', 'dreck', 'rest', 'life', 'can', 'always', 'look', 'back', 'piles', 'money', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'Chicago']",N/A

102813,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0790734583,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Suck in the gut, remove those jowls, straighten the hair, and bring back commitment to the script and story: apply these steps to Steven Seagal and you end up with ""Above the Law"", our hero's 1988 breakout hit and possibly his best movie ever. While the action star's name hardly inspires thoughts of greatness during his ongoing cinematic doldrum, ""Above the Law"" reminds us what made him king of the hill back in his heyday. Featuring at least twice as much story than most action vehicles of the time, our hero delivers big when in his element and handled by a competent director (Andrew Davis, who would also direct Seagal's top-grossingUnder Siege), for the film has no shortage of thrills, shootouts, martial arts, and hammy characters to chew on whilst enjoying the best that 1980s celluloid had to deliver.The story: Nico Toscani (Seagal) is an ex-CIA vice cop working the drug rings of Chicago with his partner Jax (Pam Grier,Jackie Brown) when he busts one of the biggest dealers in the city, but when the crook walks and a brick wall is thrown in front of Nico, he goes against jurisdiction to uncover a sinister plot involving an intercontinental drug cartel, an invasion of Nicaragua, the assassination of a US senator, and a sadistic CIA operative gone bad (Henry Silva,Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai).For starters, this is probably the best dramatic performance that Seagal has ever given. That's not saying much, but he pulls off the tough-guy persona without missing a beat, manages to display some definite emotion in the presence of his friends, and does a good job at pulling off a Sicilian accent. Not to be outdone, the supporting cast is probably the best that Seagal ever worked with, period: Pam Grier shines as a tough woman in a man's world, bad-guy Henry Silva is effectively hammy in his evilness, and Daniel Faraldo (Trenchcoat), Ron Dean (The Dark Knight), and Sharon Stone (Basic Instinct) do their respective roles with an attention to detail absent from many of Seagal's later films.The action scenes are no slouch: Seagal has never been in better shape than when he rides the roof of a moving car and performs what are probably his most technically-sound fight scenes done without a stunt double. The four gunfights are all pretty good, but it's the martial arts scenes that stand out: Seagal's use of aikido differentiated him from the likes of Van Damme or Norris, and his work as choreographer in this movie makes for the single best instances of the art being utilized practically. They're all pretty quick fights, but nonetheless, it's a thing of intense, visceral beauty to see Seagal take down groups of attackers using flips and arm-breaks.What makes this movie stand out, however, is the fact that Seagal's character is able to exist without either ruining the film with his invincibility or appearing too restrained. Nico Toscani is tough, but he's grounded by his very-defined family and friends. He makes very clear what he feels is right and wrong, but doesn't ever appear to be delivering a social sermon (a'laOn Deadly Ground). He dishes out the violence in gratuitous amounts, but even the most pacifistic viewer will be hard-pressed not to agree that they deserved it (SPOILER: when he slowly snaps Henry Silva's arm, the only thing louder than groans of the disgusted will be cheers). He's an actual cinematic hero rather than the artsy weirdoes Seagal would assume as little as seven years later. Also, aesthetic aspects that Seagal has since omitted from his films play a part in the story: family, friendship, religion, race, and parenthood are prevalent and handled in a manner that they don't become attractions or loose ends - they're essential parts of building a world that's more intricate than one would expect from our hero, and this era of action films in general.As far as I'm concerned, this is Seagal's magnum opus: deeper than ""Under Siege"", more realistic thanExit Wounds, better moderated thanOut for Justice, and more of a definitive 'Seagal movie' thanHard to Kill. Action fans of any sort won't go wrong here. As for Seagal fans, this is definitely the film to introduce Master Steven to your friends with.",5,Above The Rest & Still The Best,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,4184,"['Suck', 'gut', 'remove', 'jowls', 'straighten', 'hair', 'bring', 'back', 'commitment', 'script', 'story', 'apply', 'steps', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'end', 'up', 'Law', 'hero', '1988', 'breakout', 'hit', 'possibly', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'action', 'star', 'name', 'hardly', 'thoughts', 'greatness', 'ongoing', 'cinematic', 'doldrum', 'Law', 'what', 'made', 'king', 'hill', 'back', 'heyday', 'Featuring', 'least', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'most', 'action', 'vehicles', 'time', 'hero', 'delivers', 'big', 'when', 'element', 'handled', 'competent', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'direct', 'Seagal', 'top-grossingUnder', 'Siege', 'film', 'shortage', 'thrills', 'shootouts', 'martial', 'arts', 'hammy', 'characters', 'chew', 'whilst', 'enjoying', 'best', '1980s', 'celluloid', 'had', 'deliver.The', 'story', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'Seagal', 'ex-CIA', 'vice', 'cop', 'working', 'drug', 'rings', 'Chicago', 'partner', 'Jax', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'when', 'one', 'biggest', 'dealers', 'city', 'when', 'crook', 'walks', 'brick', 'wall', 'thrown', 'front', 'Nico', 'jurisdiction', 'uncover', 'sinister', 'plot', 'involving', 'intercontinental', 'drug', 'cartel', 'invasion', 'Nicaragua', 'assassination', 'US', 'senator', 'sadistic', 'CIA', 'operative', 'gone', 'bad', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Way', 'Samurai', '.For', 'starters', 'probably', 'best', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Seagal', 'ever', 'given', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'tough-guy', 'persona', 'missing', 'beat', 'display', 'definite', 'emotion', 'presence', 'friends', 'good', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'Sicilian', 'accent', 'Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'supporting', 'cast', 'probably', 'best', 'Seagal', 'ever', 'worked', 'period', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'shines', 'tough', 'woman', 'man', 'world', 'bad-guy', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'effectively', 'hammy', 'evilness', 'Daniel', 'Faraldo', 'Trenchcoat', 'Ron', 'Dean', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'do', 'respective', 'roles', 'attention', 'detail', 'absent', 'many', 'Seagal', 'later', 'films.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'slouch', 'Seagal', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'shape', 'when', 'roof', 'moving', 'car', 'performs', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'technically-sound', 'fight', 'scenes', 'done', 'stunt', 'double', 'four', 'gunfights', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'Seagal', 'use', 'aikido', 'differentiated', 'likes', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Norris', 'work', 'choreographer', 'movie', 'single', 'best', 'instances', 'art', 'being', 'utilized', 'practically', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'quick', 'fights', 'nonetheless', 'thing', 'intense', 'visceral', 'beauty', 'see', 'Seagal', 'take', 'down', 'groups', 'attackers', 'using', 'flips', 'arm-breaks.What', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'however', 'fact', 'Seagal', 'character', 'able', 'exist', 'ruining', 'film', 'invincibility', 'appearing', 'too', 'restrained', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'tough', 'grounded', 'very-defined', 'family', 'friends', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'ever', 'appear', 'be', 'delivering', 'social', 'sermon', ""a'laOn"", 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'out', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'amounts', 'even', 'most', 'pacifistic', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'not', 'agree', 'deserved', 'SPOILER', 'when', 'slowly', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'arm', 'only', 'thing', 'louder', 'groans', 'disgusted', 'will', 'be', 'cheers', 'actual', 'cinematic', 'hero', 'rather', 'artsy', 'Seagal', 'would', 'assume', 'as', 'little', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'Also', 'aesthetic', 'aspects', 'Seagal', 'omitted', 'films', 'play', 'part', 'story', 'family', 'friendship', 'religion', 'race', 'parenthood', 'are', 'prevalent', 'handled', 'manner', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'attractions', 'loose', 'ends', ""'re"", 'essential', 'parts', 'building', 'world', 'more', 'intricate', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'hero', 'era', 'action', 'films', 'general.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Seagal', 'magnum', 'opus', 'deeper', 'Siege', 'more', 'realistic', 'thanExit', 'Wounds', 'better', 'moderated', 'thanOut', 'Justice', 'more', 'definitive', ""'Seagal"", 'movie', 'thanHard', 'Kill', 'Action', 'fans', 'sort', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'definitely', 'film', 'introduce', 'Master', 'Steven', 'friends']",N/A

As Nico Toscani, a naturally macho yet morally upright and skilled cop (who is also ex-CIA and former Aikido instructor), Seagal is impressive and yet so refreshingly believable. The short martial arts action sequences are first rate - no drawn out Hong Kong formula stuff. The cafe jazz music score is memorable and rightly paced for the exciting car tailing sequences through downtown Chicago.Nico Toscani's Sicilian background adds to the color of the drama. There are even hints of his family background being not too far removed from the wiseguys. I mentioned Nico being macho. I'd like to qualify this by saying that he's not devoid of charm and his role is less one-dimentional than one would expect. The tough-guy persona is just a facade for an individual with strong convictions and a democratic political outlook. Equally competent is Nico's partner, Delores Jackson, played candidly by the veteran Pam Grier. The main villain, the pure evil CIA doctor Zagon, is played by the veteran villain actor Henry Silva.Don't expect any critics' choice awards for this movie, because the script does have its share of cliches. Seagal plays a cop who is on to something very big, defies higher authority and, as expected, is taken off the case - like in so many other cop movies of the genre. The outcome is predictable. You know that good is going to triumph over evil in this movie. Despite it's predictability, the plot is fresh and to a great extent realistic. Most importantly it's entertaining.There are surprisingly bold political statements made in this movie about the dubious role played by the CIA in the affairs of many a third world country. These statements are not too far fetched and must never be underplayed when you consider the ""blowback"" - CIA jargon for repercussions - being felt to this day. There are far too few movies being made these days that hold the government accountable. Unfortunately it's usually the ordinary citizen who becomes the indirect victim to the follies of an agency whose modus operandii includes criminal conduct and whose agents operate ""Above the Law"".The impressive and ship-shape Seagal in this movie inspires you to ditch your six-pack of beer for a six-pack of Gatorade. He inspires you to reach into your closet for your old karate uniform or gym gear and to whip yourself back into physical and mental shape. Too bad Seagal has physically floundered since then. He does have the potential to stay there. One would hope that he would take his cues from Eastwood and Bronson, both of whose careers have had them stay in shape and play lead roles well into their sixties and seventies.",5,"Thrilling, best in it's genre...",1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,2747,"['movie', 'best', 'most', 'thrilling', 'post', 'Harry', 'Callihan', '1980', 'genre', 'cop', 'movies', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'naturally', 'macho', 'yet', 'morally', 'upright', 'skilled', 'cop', 'who', 'also', 'ex-CIA', 'former', 'Aikido', 'instructor', 'Seagal', 'impressive', 'yet', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'believable', 'short', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'drawn', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'formula', 'stuff', 'cafe', 'jazz', 'music', 'score', 'memorable', 'rightly', 'paced', 'exciting', 'car', 'tailing', 'sequences', 'downtown', 'Chicago.Nico', 'Toscani', 'Sicilian', 'background', 'color', 'drama', 'are', 'even', 'hints', 'family', 'background', 'being', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'wiseguys', 'mentioned', 'Nico', 'being', 'macho', ""'d"", 'like', 'qualify', 'saying', 'not', 'devoid', 'charm', 'role', 'less', 'one-dimentional', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'tough-guy', 'persona', 'just', 'facade', 'individual', 'strong', 'convictions', 'democratic', 'political', 'outlook', 'Equally', 'competent', 'Nico', 'partner', 'Delores', 'Jackson', 'played', 'candidly', 'veteran', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'main', 'villain', 'pure', 'CIA', 'doctor', 'Zagon', 'played', 'veteran', 'villain', 'actor', 'Henry', 'Silva.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'critics', 'choice', 'awards', 'movie', 'script', 'have', 'share', 'cliches', 'Seagal', 'cop', 'who', 'something', 'very', 'big', 'higher', 'authority', 'expected', 'taken', 'off', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'cop', 'movies', 'genre', 'outcome', 'predictable', 'know', 'good', 'going', 'triumph', 'over', 'evil', 'movie', 'predictability', 'plot', 'fresh', 'great', 'extent', 'realistic', 'Most', 'importantly', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'bold', 'political', 'statements', 'made', 'movie', 'dubious', 'role', 'played', 'CIA', 'affairs', 'many', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'statements', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'underplayed', 'when', 'consider', 'blowback', 'CIA', 'jargon', 'repercussions', 'being', 'felt', 'day', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'days', 'hold', 'government', 'accountable', 'usually', 'ordinary', 'citizen', 'who', 'indirect', 'victim', 'follies', 'agency', 'modus', 'operandii', 'criminal', 'conduct', 'agents', 'operate', 'Law', '.The', 'impressive', 'ship-shape', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'ditch', 'six-pack', 'beer', 'six-pack', 'Gatorade', 'reach', 'closet', 'old', 'karate', 'uniform', 'gym', 'gear', 'whip', 'back', 'physical', 'mental', 'shape', 'Too', 'bad', 'Seagal', 'physically', 'floundered', 'then', 'have', 'potential', 'stay', 'there', 'One', 'would', 'hope', 'would', 'take', 'cues', 'Eastwood', 'Bronson', 'careers', 'have', 'had', 'stay', 'shape', 'play', 'lead', 'roles', 'well', 'sixties', 'seventies']",N/A

The movie received positive feedback after its initial screen test, resulting in a nation and world wide release. The film was a box office success and received positive critical reviews.This was the first time we saw a different form of fighting style. Much different from other action heroes from that era. And this was due to Aikido, martial arts that uses the opponent's strength to defeat him, mostly through inertia. Seagal holds a 7th Dan in Aikido, making him a full expert in the arts.The Story of the movie is a bit confusing for an action movie. As a matter of fact a review said "" it contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers""(Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times=1988) and its true the movie is in a way unoriginal but it manages to be fresh by keeping the audience thinking and observing who is working for whom. The movie commences in Vietnam with the character of Nico Toscanni, he is recruited by the C.I.A to assist as an observant. Then we see the character as a cop investigating a drug ring. And it seems that everyone Nico busts comes out of jail quickly. Instead of being defended he is asked to back off. So it is obvious something is up...but what? The rest I leave to you to find out. Its a clever story that even though it's been used in various action movies of the 80's and 90's it still brings in a an extra punch.

102825,A3UA046AA3DXFD,0790734583,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","This was a hugely significant moment in film history. Above the Law was the first ever film of the now ledgendary Steven Segal. Yeah, this was his first film, but the man looked like he was in the zone from the first second of the film when we see him in his karate getup with two of the most ferocious sideburns to ever grace the big screen. To set the scene, the movie was made in 1988, and it was set in Chicago. And to top it all off, Segal's name in the film was Nico Toscani. So, basically, this film stared Segal, a few other people we know, and about 35 Bernie Kosar look-alikes with black curly A.C. Slater mullets and all.One of the people we knew was the infamous Sharon Stone. She was about 4 years away from her breakout role in Basic Instinct here, and clearly fell into the category of Not Ready For Prime-Time. She was far from hot. Actually, she looked ""a little chubby."" (direct quote from an honorary Sid the Elf member for part of the movie) They even had her play the wet blanket wife in this one. Another person we knew was Segal's buddy from Vietnam who later became the CIA guy. It was the guy who played Eddie Harris in Major League and the bum that tried to run Coach Norman Dale out of Hickory in Hoosiers. This guy's got it. When he was having his terribly acted argument with Segal, Sid was waiting for him to break character and say, ""Are you saying Jesus Christ can't hit a curve ball?"" But it never happened.That's one of the reasons we, Sid the Elf, could only give Above the Law 4 stars. Don't misunderstand, this is a terrific action B. But, it just was missing something. Sid's theory is that the lack of the Segal ponytail, double chin, and big gut made this one feel different. So, Segal was skinny and ponytailless but he did have what appeared to be the begining stages of the Myers hair we all saw inUrban Justice. Also, Segal didn't have the role of goomba rouge cop perfected yet. This was the only role he played in his early movies, so he had enough practice to get it down by the time he nailed it perfectly inOut for Justice. While Nico was not as tough as Gino Felino, he was still man enough to take on the main villan who was played by Henry Silva wearing a Chevy Chase mask. One other thing, Segal DID kick a multitude of butt in Above the Law, but there was a serious lack of explosions. You don't get 5 stars as an action flick with no explosions. Not gonna happen.Finally, like any good B Above the law was floating along and ended abruptly. It also had a few ""wait, what's going on here?"" moments and enough physically impossible things happening to make it certified B. Like when Segal was hanging onto the roof of the car going like 30 mph while choking the guy in the passenger seat. Sid loved that. It pushed the film into the upper echelon of action B and enabled us, Sid the Elf, to give Above the Law our Watchability Seal of Approval.",4,Segal uncorks the film world and takes it for the very first time!,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2897,"['was', 'hugely', 'significant', 'moment', 'film', 'history', 'Law', 'was', 'first', 'ever', 'film', 'now', 'ledgendary', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Yeah', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'man', 'looked', 'was', 'zone', 'first', 'second', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'karate', 'getup', 'two', 'most', 'ferocious', 'sideburns', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'set', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1988', 'was', 'set', 'Chicago', 'top', 'off', 'Segal', 'name', 'film', 'was', 'Nico', 'Toscani', 'So', 'basically', 'film', 'stared', 'Segal', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'know', '35', 'Bernie', 'Kosar', 'look-alikes', 'black', 'curly', 'A.C.', 'Slater', 'mullets', 'all.One', 'people', 'knew', 'was', 'infamous', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'was', 'about', '4', 'years', 'away', 'breakout', 'role', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'here', 'clearly', 'fell', 'category', 'Not', 'Ready', 'Prime-Time', 'was', 'far', 'hot', 'Actually', 'looked', 'little', 'chubby', 'direct', 'quote', 'honorary', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'member', 'part', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'play', 'wet', 'blanket', 'wife', 'one', 'person', 'knew', 'was', 'Segal', 'buddy', 'Vietnam', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'CIA', 'guy', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Harris', 'Major', 'League', 'bum', 'tried', 'run', 'Coach', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'Hickory', 'Hoosiers', 'guy', 'got', 'When', 'was', 'having', 'terribly', 'acted', 'argument', 'Segal', 'Sid', 'was', 'waiting', 'break', 'character', 'say', 'Are', 'saying', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'curve', 'ball', 'never', 'happened.That', 'one', 'reasons', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'could', 'only', 'give', 'Law', '4', 'stars', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'terrific', 'action', 'B', 'just', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'Sid', 'theory', 'lack', 'Segal', 'ponytail', 'double', 'chin', 'big', 'gut', 'made', 'one', 'feel', 'different', 'So', 'Segal', 'was', 'skinny', 'ponytailless', 'did', 'have', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'begining', 'stages', 'Myers', 'hair', 'saw', 'inUrban', 'Justice', 'Also', 'Segal', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'role', 'goomba', 'rouge', 'cop', 'perfected', 'yet', 'was', 'only', 'role', 'played', 'early', 'movies', 'had', 'enough', 'practice', 'get', 'down', 'time', 'nailed', 'perfectly', 'Justice', 'Nico', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'tough', 'Gino', 'Felino', 'was', 'still', 'man', 'enough', 'take', 'main', 'villan', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'wearing', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'mask', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'Segal', 'DID', 'kick', 'multitude', 'butt', 'Above', 'Law', 'there', 'was', 'serious', 'lack', 'explosions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', '5', 'stars', 'action', 'flick', 'explosions', 'Not', 'gon', 'happen.Finally', 'good', 'B', 'Above', 'law', 'was', 'floating', 'along', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'wait', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'moments', 'enough', 'physically', 'impossible', 'things', 'happening', 'make', 'certified', 'B', 'when', 'Segal', 'was', 'hanging', 'roof', 'car', 'going', '30', 'mph', 'choking', 'guy', 'passenger', 'seat', 'Sid', 'loved', 'pushed', 'film', 'upper', 'echelon', 'action', 'B', 'enabled', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'give', 'Law', 'Watchability', 'Seal', 'Approval']",N/A

There is plenty of action and in some ways some of it reminded me of the 'Dirty Harry' movies. Unfortunately whilst Seagal is undoubtably a real tough guy he does not have the screen presence or the acting ability of Clint Eastwood. The film has an interesting supporting cast. Sharon Stone plays Rico's wife and Pam Grier is pretty good as his partner in the Police.In places it is just ridiculous though.

I had first started taking martial arts, and some guys in my class had seen the film and said it was a ""must rent."" I took their advice and was astonished.Nobody had shown anything like that on film since the days of Bruce Lee. Seagal was a hard core ""street smart"" style of Aikido that blew myself, and many other viewers away. This is the film that eventually made Steven Seagal the biggest star since Stallone and Schwartzenegger.Wrapped around the movie was an intriguing story, a good supporting cast (including Pam Grier and Sharon Stone) and good direction by Andrew Davis (who would direct Seagal in his one other decent movie ""Under Siege"" and would go on to direct ""The Fugitive"").The story is about Nico Toscani, a martial arts expert who is hired by the CIA and serves in Vietnam. While working on what he believes is a routine drug deal, instead of finding illegal narcotics, he finds a shipload of explosives. The perpetrators are mysteriously released by the federal government, which upsets the Toscani, who has a reputation for being a hot-headed rogue. His refusal to give up on the case leads him down the path of what turns out to be a very large conspiracy.Yes the plot is somewhat of a cliche, but Seagal is slim, confident, and sharp in this film. He looks every bit the part, and he plays the role in a very natural manner that works for this type of movie. The action is top-notch and the supporting characters help fill in the plot and make the movie enjoyable to watch.I consider this and Under Siege to be Seagal's two best movies in terms of action and plot.

From the opening credits of this work of art, the Aikido master demonstrated his lordage by flipping and clothes-lining some Japanese guys in a dojo. Ultra purity! Steven Seagal has a look about him that is just pure comic genius. His facial expression never changes and soul that doesn't care about anyone. That is pure lord right there. He walked into a bar asking where his cousin was and the men wouldn't cooperate. So, he used his elbows for defense and flipped guys around. Flexibility! After that incident, Seagal faced an opium dealing wiseguy that he dealt with in Vietnam. The car chases are funny and Steven Seagal is the best thing that happened since Jean-Claude Van Damme. Talk about defying the lordage! Watch out for Pam Grier and Sharon Stone who are comical. ""Crazy idiot!""",5,Aikido?
