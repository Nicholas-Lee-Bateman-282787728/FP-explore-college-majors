1530696,A3QG3SC5KFMFL7,B007GMKX84,Captainjep,"[1, 2]","Let me make this clear, i never got a chance to see ECW when it was still alive back in the day, but i knew if i was able to i would be a die hard fan like all the rest. What ECW is to me is an organization that wasn't afraid to show people just how crazy professional wrestling could get, or how dedicated the amazing men and women who were a part of it were themselves. I spent years looking up old matches on Youtube, finding old DVDS in video stores that were going out of business (thank you Blockbuster!) anyway i could and now i look forward to every new ECW dvd that WWE releases no matter how badly they are edited over (and there is editing in this but more on that later) heres my review of this DVD.The Good: The matches are amazing, a good and lengthy amount of them too. I could go through each one but why spoil it for you?? I think its best for yourself to go through and rate each match how you like them, each person has their own styles and tastes of what kind of wrestling they like in ECW, and fortunately it had it all! Each disk has different styles of wrestling. The first disc focusses on the earlier days in ECW, when Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko tore it up with their classic styles. The second disc starts getting more intense as it shows some tag team action at its finest with the likes of the Eliminators and Rob Van Dam.  Some very nice stuff. The third disc is what you are all waiting for; tables, blood, fast paced action, lucha libre style and one thing i really liked about the disc, the ""untold"" story of the controversy of Mike Awesome wanting to take the ECW title to WCW and how legal technicalities led to a WWE wrestler facing off against a WCW wrestler for the ECW title. Very interesting stuff!Whats good summary: The matches are awesome, vast variety. Technical wrestling, lots of table spots, unaired footage, backstory, and joey styles himself as the host of the DVD.The Bad: Not too much, however some things stood out. Not many matches with the likes of Sandman, Raven, or the Dudley Boys are featured. Spike dudley is in a couple, but not till the end and not really a lot of matches where the sandman could show his style of wrestling (i mean he is barely shown at all! WTF) Also, i would have liked to have seen more of Joey talking, a lot of the matches are just shown back to back, no intros to them at all. Newer fans would probably not grasp the significance of certain teams or wrestlers and who they really were. And finally there is editing with how the matches are called, the music intros, and yes even the fan's chants during the matches. Small stuff to me, for others it might be more of an issue.Whats bad summary: Editing here and there, and lack of Dudley boys and sandman and raven matches. Not much but enough to notice.SUMMARY OF WHOLE DISC: So there you go, personally i think Bloodsport ECW's most violent matches is a little better than this disc, but if you are a die hard fan or just a fan curious as to what ECW really was (and not that god awful promotion WWE tried to make) you will enjoy this! Yes there is real wrestling, hardcore wrestling, Philadelphia wrestling, and yes this is a good (not great) but good addition to the WWE's ECW dvd releases.",4,"ECW Unreleased: the good, the bad, and the moments we'll never forget",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3232,"['Let', 'make', 'clear', 'i', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'ECW', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'back', 'day', 'i', 'knew', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'rest', 'What', 'ECW', 'organization', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'people', 'just', 'how', 'crazy', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'could', 'get', 'how', 'dedicated', 'amazing', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'were', 'spent', 'years', 'looking', 'up', 'old', 'matches', 'Youtube', 'finding', 'old', 'DVDS', 'video', 'stores', 'were', 'going', 'business', 'thank', 'Blockbuster', 'anyway', 'i', 'could', 'now', 'i', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'ECW', 'dvd', 'WWE', 'matter', 'how', 'badly', 'are', 'edited', 'editing', 'more', 'later', 'review', 'DVD.The', 'Good', 'matches', 'are', 'amazing', 'good', 'lengthy', 'amount', 'too', 'could', 'go', 'one', 'why', 'spoil', 'think', 'best', 'go', 'rate', 'match', 'how', 'person', 'own', 'styles', 'tastes', 'what', 'kind', 'wrestling', 'like', 'ECW', 'fortunately', 'had', 'all', 'disk', 'different', 'styles', 'wrestling', 'first', 'disc', 'focusses', 'earlier', 'days', 'ECW', 'when', 'Eddie', 'Guerrero', 'Dean', 'Malenko', 'tore', 'up', 'classic', 'styles', 'second', 'disc', 'getting', 'more', 'intense', 'tag', 'team', 'action', 'finest', 'likes', 'Eliminators', 'Rob', 'Van', 'Dam', 'very', 'nice', 'stuff', 'third', 'disc', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'tables', 'blood', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'lucha', 'libre', 'style', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'disc', 'untold', 'story', 'controversy', 'Mike', 'Awesome', 'wanting', 'take', 'ECW', 'title', 'WCW', 'how', 'legal', 'technicalities', 'led', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'facing', 'off', 'WCW', 'wrestler', 'ECW', 'title', 'Very', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'Whats', 'good', 'summary', 'matches', 'are', 'awesome', 'vast', 'variety', 'Technical', 'wrestling', 'lots', 'table', 'spots', 'unaired', 'footage', 'backstory', 'joey', 'styles', 'host', 'DVD.The', 'Bad', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'however', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'Not', 'many', 'matches', 'likes', 'Sandman', 'Raven', 'Dudley', 'Boys', 'are', 'featured', 'Spike', 'dudley', 'couple', 'not', 'till', 'end', 'not', 'really', 'lot', 'matches', 'where', 'sandman', 'could', 'show', 'style', 'wrestling', 'i', 'mean', 'barely', 'shown', 'WTF', 'Also', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Joey', 'talking', 'lot', 'matches', 'are', 'just', 'shown', 'back', 'back', 'intros', 'Newer', 'fans', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'grasp', 'significance', 'certain', 'teams', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'finally', 'editing', 'how', 'matches', 'are', 'called', 'music', 'intros', 'yes', 'even', 'fan', 'chants', 'matches', 'Small', 'stuff', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'issue.Whats', 'bad', 'summary', 'Editing', 'here', 'there', 'lack', 'Dudley', 'boys', 'sandman', 'raven', 'matches', 'Not', 'much', 'enough', 'notice.SUMMARY', 'OF', 'WHOLE', 'DISC', 'So', 'go', 'personally', 'i', 'think', 'Bloodsport', 'ECW', 'most', 'violent', 'matches', 'little', 'better', 'disc', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'just', 'fan', 'curious', 'what', 'ECW', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'god', 'awful', 'promotion', 'WWE', 'tried', 'make', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Yes', 'real', 'wrestling', 'hardcore', 'wrestling', 'Philadelphia', 'wrestling', 'yes', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'addition', 'WWE', 'ECW', 'dvd', 'releases']",N/A

1530698,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B007GMKX84,D.P.,"[3, 5]","For the first time in almost 6 years, WWE has gone into their vault to release a collection of ECW matches. Now it should be noted that this set is advertised to include matches that have been previously unreleased to DVD however a few of them were released by the original ECW before WWE acquired the footage so these matches haven't been released by WWE with the exception of the Taz vs. Sabu match from ""Barely Legal"" since WWE did release that entire PPV on DVD with the second One Night Stand PPV.NWA World Championship Tournament Final: Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio - Douglas attempted to ground Scorpio early & worked over the legs but both men were so evenly matched that they were able to wrestle back & forth against each other during the first half of the match. The match was eventually taken into the crowd where Scorpio was suplexed onto the guardrail stomach first before the match got taken back into the ring where Douglas continued to target it. While the action was nice, this match was more famous for the aftermath that created EXTREME Championship Wrestling.""Hardcore TV"" Aug. 94Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven - This was a different Tommy Dreamer than most people remember as he came out in a wrestling singlet & t-shirt as Raven started the match with a bang by jumping over onto Dreamer right from the start before the brawled throughout the arena using anything they could get their hands on like the post, wall, door, trash can, table, chair, eggs, a plastic dinosaur, the kitchen sink (yes, you read the last three right). They spent more time on the outside than they did in the inside before Dreamer turned it up DDTing everyone in sight before confronting Beulah who with Raven at this time. They would go on to have better matches & become one of the most famous feuds in ECW but this was one of the most famous matches as Tommy finally won over the ECW crowd who never accepted him before.Hostile City Showdown 95Dean Malenko & 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Eddy Guerrero & Taz - We had a pre-match comedic bickering between Paul E. Dangerously & Scorpio. All four men were straight wrestling each other utilizing their different styles before Taz's leg became a target with Malenko applying moves like a dropkick directly to it & the cloverleaf while Scorpio did a spinning leglock & came off the top rope with a legdrop directly on his knee while both rammed it into the post as well. Guerrero was eventually tagged in & had very impactful offense with the brainbuster & frog splash on Malenko, exchanged powerbombs with Scorpio, and did a dropkick version of the Doomsday Device with Taz. While this wasn't the more infamous match between these two teams where Taz got his neck broke, this was a good & better quality match here as you can tell each team just beat on each other into exhaustion with even Dangerously getting a piece of the action.HeatWave 95ECW Television Champion Dean Malenko vs. Eddy Guerrero - This was the rematch from Malenko's title win a week earlier (available on ""Wrestling's Highest Flyers"" DVD) as both men were so evenly matched that we had various stalemates with both men changing head scissors back to back at one point. The intensity picked up with Malenko hitting a running elbow that looked like it knocked Eddie out before he recovered & Eddie's ribs were targeted to the point where he hurt himself delivering the frog splash. ECW called their series of matches ""The Guerrero-Malenko Classic"" and this match showcases why it earned the name ""classic.""""Hardcore TV"" July 95Shane Douglas vs. Cactus Jack - This match was happening under unusual circumstances as Cactus Jack made it known that he was leaving for the WWE while Shane Douglas was coming back from WWE & they had unfinished business from when Douglas cost Cactus the ECW Title before he left months earlier. Cactus was in the middle of his ""anti-hardcore"" gimmick wearing his suit & cowboy boots as he wasn't expecting to be competing before Douglas eventually beat him out of his suit & dominated until Cactus had to resort to going hardcore using a crutch on Douglas. Douglas still kept coming after Cactus using the crutch himself along with suplexing him on the guardrail spine first followed by Douglas going aerial with a crossbody off the top rope into the crowd. Both men targeted previous injuries like Cactus working over Douglas' throat while Douglas worked over the leg as various elements would come into play for the rest of the match from the referee to who Cactus was calling for to help him & a point in the match with handcuffs & a chair that most become more famous (or infamous) with Mick Foley in WWE close to 3 years later.CyberSlam 96[ECW: Best Of Cactus Jack]Chris Jericho vs. 2 Cold Scorpio - Despite both men being known as high flyers, Scorpio worked a ground game early & even got a little dirty by pulling Jericho's hair right in front of the referee before Jericho was able to reverse a hold into a unique submission stretch that Joey Styles didn't even know how to call (similar to ""Mr. Saulty"") before Scorpio was able to continue to work over his arm with various stretches & armbars. Both men seemed to have a reversal & counter for everything they did as the match kept going on while pulling out similar moves like high kicks before both men went aerial such as Jericho doing for a springboard dropkick but ended up cashing & burning to the floor, Scorpio with a legdrop from the top rope, Jericho's dropkick from the top to the outside, and Scorpio's shooting star press.""The Doctor Is In"" Aug. 96Tables & Ladders Match: ECW Tag Team Champions The Eliminators vs. Sabu & Rob Van Dam - You thought this match was going to go one direction the moment the Eliminators pulled out a ladder before the match but both teams started off ground wrestling early with RVD trying to work over Saturn's arm. Eventually this turned into a brawl with fist flying both in & out of the ring with a table later being used before the ladder came into play such as Kronis & Sabu both dropkicking a ladder when RVD & Saturn were fighting over it, a legdrop off the ladder followed by a moonsault off it from his partner, RVD & Sabu doing a Rolling Thunder/Legdrop combination with Saturn on the ladder, an Arabian Facebuster with the ladder, a big splash off it, and RVD's attempt at his split legged moonsault onto the ladder that was wedged in the corner on the second ropes. Joey Styles said on this DVD set the pace for a lot of in wrestling & this is a perfect example as this was the quality we would get in tag team ladder/T.L.C. that WWE/WCW didn't do until years later.CyberSlam 97Sabu vs. Taz - This was called ""The Grudge Match Of The Century"" as this match was build for over a year dating back to their issues going on 2 years earlier to the point where Sabu came straight to the ring without his typical entrance. Both men went back & forth wrestling with Taz even daring Sabu to take his leg at one point before catching him in a body scissors with vicious crossfaces that ended up breaking Sabu's nose. Sabu used this daredevil offense like the double jump springboard into the crowd followed by brawling in the audience while Taz was sticking to this wrestling like the freestyle bow & arrow stretch while also countering Sabu's offense like throwing Sabu off a swinging DDT attempt that sent Sabu through a table. Taz made his clear that he was going after Sabu's previously injured neck with his various Tazplexes that landed Sabu directly on it while even Sabu tried to beat Taz at his own game applying the Tazmission at one point. This did come off as a grudge match with how hard & stiff each other were going after each other but it was the aftermath that had everyone talking as it changed both men's careers forever.Barely Legal 97[ECW: Extreme Revolution]ECW Champion Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Shane Douglas - The match took place in Douglas hometown of Pittsburgh while it should be noted that Francine was on crutches due to an injury while the rest of the Douglas' allies in Chris Candido & Lance Storm were banned from ringside. Bigelow showcased his superior power advantage first by throwing Shane to the floor during the first lockup followed by sheer domination with headbutts & power moves & splashes in the corner as. Bigelow was able to keep countering Shane's offense & worked over his arm before Douglas was able to catch Bigelow on a rare opening that allowed him to get an advantage with a powerbomb through a table. Bigelow kept coming strong to the point where the Triple Threat came to ringside to save Shane to no avail & Francine got involved despite being hurt but only doing more harm that good giving Bigelow another weapon to use in her crutch. Despite the action, this match was more memorable for how the crowd can dictate the match as anywhere else, Douglas would have been booed out of the building while Bigelow would have been cheered but they made both men switch roles with Douglas coming in as the underdog with the crowd behind him & Bigelow being the unstoppable heel but overall was a good showcase for Bigelow more than anything as we saw ""The Beast From The East"" that we haven't really seen in any other promotion in years.November To Remember 97ECW Tag Team Champions Sabu & Rob Van Dam vs. Hayabusa & Jensei Shinzaki - With Sabu & RVD being the top tag team in ECW at this time, their challengers for this match came from the FMW promotion in Japan while it should be noted for those who don't already know, Jensei Shinzaki is the wrestler formerly known as Hakushi in the WWE back in the mid 90's. You saw this was going to be competitive right from the early going as both teams tried to stay one step ahead of the other as Sabu stick with a quick hit & move ground attack while focusing on Hayabusa's legs while RVD was mostly focused on using his legs for various kicks & double teaming but unfortunately showed off one too many times allowing Jensei to catch RVD with a dropkick to RVD's back at one point. Things really started to pick up when the match went to the floor as we had one arial move after another like top rope moonsaults & frankensteiners, a triple jump dive into the crowd, Sabu delivering a chair off the top rope into Jensei's midsection, a 450 top rope splash, and RVD changing direction in mid-air to deliver a splash from the top rope along with later delivering a top rope legdrop that had his entire body land on Jensei's head. Definitely one of the most physical & athletic matches in ECW history.HeatWave 98ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - Lynn would match RVD move for move early on causing RVD to keep going to the outside with Lynn continuing the attack whenever he got back in the ring including diving over the top to the outside on top of him. RVD used his various unique legdrops to help get an advantage such as off the rail onto Lynn, into the ring, and a rolling corkscrew onto Lynn before Lynn again was a step ahead of RVD by countering his own attempt at a slingshot with his own slingshot dropkick followed by a springboard crossbody off the apron into the crowd onto RVD that eventually broke RVD's nose as the action picked up & action got more intense with their counters including one that sent RVD through a table. This was more of a tease of what we would get in their more famous matches over this title the next year as this was what you got whenever they would get in the ring...non-stop quality action!""Hardcore TV"" Aug. 98ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Taz - After chasing after Douglas for close to a year, Taz finally got his shot at the ECW Championship. Both men never really seemed to leave first gear & kept having stalemates while Douglas would kept rolling out whenever Taz started to build some momentum during the first half of the match leading some in the crowd to chant ""BORING!"" The match really started to pick up when Taz eventually followed Shane to the outside with both men brawling through the crowd for minutes using whatever they could get their hands on including chairs that eventually caused both men to bleed before Taz suplexed Shane over the railing onto a platform. They eventually made their way back into the ring where tables where used before we saw the return of Sabu to get revenge on both men (Shane hired Taz to take out Sabu which he did only to take his place in this title match) followed by the appearances of Chris Candido & Tammy Sytch with Francine also getting involved. This was ECW's version of Hogan vs. Sting from Starrcade '97 in that with the heavy amount of stalling in the beginning along with all the run-ins & side stories going on that it just didn't live up to the hype...to the point where they had a rematch later in the week (seen on the ECW Bloodsport DVD) that Douglas himself said was ""a World Title match that they could be proud of.""Guilty As Charged 99Rob Van Dam & Jerry Lynn vs. Impact Players - This match came right after the back to back series of matches RVD & Lynn had on PPV for the Television Championship but Lynn ran into problems with the Impact Players causing him to ask RVD to be his partner despite RVD's normal tag partner was Sabu, who was medically suspended from ECW thanks to the Impact Players. As Joey Styles would point out on commentary that Justin Credible made statements that RVD was ducking him but we would see that it's the other way around as Credible didn't start the match when RVD did but tagged in when he saw Lynn was tagged in. Both men would exchange chops & even have reversals to each other's piledrivers early on before he had to resort to using the cane to get the advantage with the Impact Players targeting Lynn's nose that was injured in the previous PPV match against RVD with moves like the running knee in the corner with a chair on Lynn's face. The hot tag was eventually made to RVD who came in like a house of fire with his offense including an attempted crossbody on the outside only for Storm to duck sending RVD into the crowd with him coming back with a cannonball off the guardrail & Rolling Thunder in the ring on a chair onto Storm. Credible continued to avoid RVD including a moment when RVD whipped him into the corner only for Credible to leap over the top rope onto the floor but RVD finally had his chance to put Credible through a table before his thunder was stolen followed by RVD accidentally hitting his 5 star frog splash on Lynn which he kicked out of afterwords. This was one of those matches that was good quality in the ring while being able to tell & get the multiple stories across (continuing the feud between Lynn & RVD, RVD vs. Credible, and Sabu's involvement with everything).HeatWave 99ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka - As Joey Styles would point out before the match that despite Mike Awesome pinning Masato Tanaka at the previous PPV to win the ECW Title in an impromptu three way dance with Taz, he had never defeated him in a scheduled one on one contest in his ECW career up to this point. There were moments where both men went aerial like Tanaka delivering a high crossbody onto the outside & Awesome doing a suicide dive followed by a top rope clothesline into the crowd. Awesome delivered physical punishment here as well with Awesome delivering suplexes & a snap powerbomb that kept having Tanaka landing on his head, a top rope superplex through the table & delivering an Awesome Bomb that was so impactful that even Styles had to go ""Holy S....!"" A chair was definitely the ""weapon of mass destruction here"" with both men giving & taking shots like a running chair into the face, chairshots coming off the top rope, Tanaka's roaring elbow right into the chair, top rope chair dive onto the face, tornado DDT onto the chair & an Awesome Bombs onto the chair. Just knowing the matches these two had previously (and in the future like the first One Night Stand PPV), you knew you were going to get a very physical match here & it more than delivered.November To Remember 99[ECW: Extreme Revolution]ECW Champion Tazz vs. Tommy Dreamer - Joey Styles already explained the entire situation between ECW, WWE, and WCW (the only time you ever saw all three promotions involved in the same business deal) leading to this match that was previous never aided on television. Tazz reverted back to his ""Human Suplex Machine"" persona here as he caught Tommy early with one of his Tazplexes & followed up with crossfaces before the match got taken to the outside where both men didn't hold back when using a chair. Back in the ring they were able to counter each others signature holds like the belly to belly tazplex into a DDT, Death Valley Driver into the Tazmission, and DDT into another tazplex. The only negative I can say here is that the win so out of nowhere after all the action that you could see the audience was silent yet you heard a huge ovation so I'm guessing that crowd noise as added in later but that wasn't the case after the match as it was full of emotional speeches & moments before...CyberSlam 00ECW Champion Tommy Dreamer vs. Justin Credible - ...Justin Credible caned Dreamer right in the eye causing him to bleed before throwing down & forfeiting his half of the tag team championship in the process to challenge Dreamer for his. Dreamer beat on Credible on the outside including using the ringbell before Credible regained the advantage using a chair to his advantage including dropping Dreamer face first with his injured eye before Dreamer fought back including a Death Valley Driver through an outside table but it was when ""Plan B"" was put into place that we saw a new alliance that shocked ECW & made an impact.CyberSlam 00ECW Telvision Champion Rhyno vs. The Sandman - This was from ECW's only appearance in California as Sandman was out to not only win the only championship he's never held in ECW but also revenge for the assaults on his wife to the point where he destroyed his cane on Rhino's head at the start of the match only for Rhino had to have effect. Both men brawled in & out of the ring with a guardrail being brought into the ring with it being used to inflict heavy punishment with hard irish whips, a frankensteiner, bulldog, piledriver, snap suplex, and even Sandman somersault off the top rope onto it with Rhino underneath. We saw involvement from ""The Network"" & another wrestler who had an issue with Rhino at the time as well.HeatWave 00ECW Television Champion Rhyno vs. Spike Dudley - Spike was out for revenge against the only man to injure him so heavily with the broken leg that he was out of action for months. He jumped on Rhino right from the start only for Rhino to shove him off when he went for the acid drop early in the match but Spike came right back & targeted Rhino's legs with a spear & stomps. They brawled on the outside & through the crowd where Spike took punishment from going face first into a table followed by chairs to the head that busted him open but also dished out the punishment including a dive from the balcony. Rhino continued to be the unstoppable monster by shoving Spike off the acid drop again but this time through an outside table only for him to still keep coming after Rhino's legs with a chair. This was built as a grudge match & it accomplished that as both men looked like they really wanted to hurt & kill each other from start to finish.Massacre On 34th Street 00Christian York vs. Jerry Lynn - Couple of notes here in that York's partner, Joey Matthews (later known as Joey Mercury in WWE), has his arm in a sling due to injury while this was during the short period towards the end of ECW where Jerry Lynn had turned heel & aligned himself with Cyrus who did a very heelish but also comical introduction of Lynn himself. This was a short TV match but very fast paced & competitive resulting in a good showcasing of York as he was always a step ahead of Lynn.""Hardcore TV"" Dec. '00Yoshihiro Tajiri & Mikey Whipwreck vs. Kid Kash & Super Crazy vs. Full Blooded Italians - This was to determine the #1 contenders to the ECW Tag Team Championship with a member of each team allowed in the ring at one time. This was very fast paced from the start of the action with members of every team showcasing their styles as there were so many moments & spots like Tajiri delivering his strong stiff kicks, Guido's shoot wrestling, back to back to back to back aerial moves from the F.B.I. & Kash followed by dual submissions from Tajiri & Mikey, Kash & Crazy moonsaulting everyone on the outside, Big Sal E. Grazino getting involved...just so much fast paced action & offense that I can't possibly try to summarize it all but it was the action expected from all of the names involved.Guilty As Charged 01The two Blu-Ray bonus matches were the original 3 way dance known as ""The Night The Line Was Crossed"" with Terry Funk vs. Sabu vs. Shane Douglas that went to a one hour time limit & Tommy Dreamer vs. Jimmy Snuka from that same event. In the end, it's been a long time since WWE has given us a full ECW match collection but this was well worth it as we got classic quality original ECW action with the special treat of some matches that haven't been seen before on television either so get this, no questions asked.",5,The Original EXTREME Is Back!,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,21241,"['first', 'time', 'almost', '6', 'years',

1530701,A1BG88N69Q7W1S,B007GMKX84,"imafunker2 ""miamiderek""","[2, 5]","Now that is a hot match listing. The fact that the blu-ray has 2 matches that haven't been widely seen makes it a must for those with the option, especially when one of the 2 bouts is the classic that put the company on the map:The original 60-minute 3 Way Dance between Terry Funk, Shane Douglas, and Sabu, known forever more as ""The night the line was crossed""...and boy, was it ever! Many ECW fanatics still consider it the finest match in the company's history.Naturally, one can nitpick about all the classic matches that weren't included, and argue amongst themselves over which should have been in and which should have been out, but to me, that's really not important anymore. All I care about is that hopefully, WWE eased up on the edit button, and that bottom of the barrel non-entities like The Miz and Josh Matthews aren't doing 5 minute ""comedy"" bits between matches.And that's the only reason i gave it 4 stars; the lineup is as 5-star as you get. But I trust WWE about as far as I could throw the 'Great' Khali to do right by the Dub.Also, if the DVD cover picture is the actual image, it looks a bit like false advertising. It says ""UNRELEASED"" as if this is all never before seen material. Of course, that's not the case. But again, all nitpicking. If you havent entered the wonderful world of ECW before, and would like to break outside the WWE box, buy it!",4,Can WWE do right by ECW this time?,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1375,"['Now', 'hot', 'match', 'listing', 'fact', 'blu-ray', '2', 'matches', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'widely', 'seen', 'must', 'option', 'especially', 'when', 'one', '2', 'bouts', 'classic', 'put', 'company', 'map', 'original', '60-minute', '3', 'Way', 'Dance', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'Shane', 'Douglas', 'Sabu', 'known', 'forever', 'more', 'night', 'line', 'was', 'crossed', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'Many', 'ECW', 'fanatics', 'still', 'consider', 'finest', 'match', 'company', 'history.Naturally', 'one', 'can', 'nitpick', 'classic', 'matches', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'argue', 'amongst', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'really', 'not', 'important', 'anymore', 'care', 'hopefully', 'WWE', 'eased', 'up', 'edit', 'button', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'non-entities', 'Miz', 'Josh', 'Matthews', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', '5', 'minute', 'comedy', 'bits', 'matches.And', 'only', 'reason', 'i', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'lineup', 'as', '5-star', 'get', 'trust', 'WWE', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'throw', ""'Great"", 'Khali', 'do', 'right', 'Dub.Also', 'DVD', 'cover', 'picture', 'actual', 'image', 'bit', 'false', 'advertising', 'UNRELEASED', 'never', 'seen', 'material', 'course', 'not', 'case', 'again', 'nitpicking', 'havent', 'entered', 'wonderful', 'world', 'ECW', 'would', 'like', 'break', 'WWE', 'box', 'buy']",N/A
1530702,AI9XPEYMZE7TN,B007GMKX84,joseph,"[0, 1]","I liked this DVD because it has an old feel of territory in it. Its cheap video but thrilling to watch. The wrestlers are so into their characters that you can just feel the &#34;realness&#34; of everything they say and do. ECW did have a following and I can see why. These wrestlers were eating, sleeping, and breathing this business, and had a great attitude that made it believeable. The matches are all good because they use old school moves you don't see anymore. The promos are in your face, and fun to watch. It's really too bad that ECW had to go under. It was dirrerent from WWE and WCW.

1530706,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B007GMKX84,Tom,"[6, 6]","When I heard this dvd was going to be released I was so excited.  I was one of the people who used to do the whole underground tape trading.  I loved ECW and I still love watching some of the matches and some of the people who made that company great.  I think this set is a pretty good set but there were some things about it that I didn't like.  One of the things was editing the ECW crowd.  Hell, they were part of the show so I think this was a bad move from WWE.  They should have slapped on a rating for the set and released it like they did the The Rise and Fall of ECW.  Some of the matches were questionable as well but overall it was a good set.The first match was the tournament finals for the NWA world title between Shane Douglas and 2 Cold Scorpio.  This was a great match and a great way to start the show.  I was always a fan of both of these men, Shane with his technical skills and Scorpio with his high flying ability.  This match did not disappoint.  Of course, the aftermath of this match is what started the whole EXTREME movement.Up next was a match from Harcore TV between Raven and Tommy Dreamer.  This is truly one of the greatest, maybe the greatest feud, in ECW history.  I remember when Tommy first started with the company and he would come out in his singlet and smile.  The fans would boo the crap out of him until he took his ""caning.""  This was a good match but these two would have many other better matches.  As a side note, this is the debut of Beulah, who would go on to be Dreamer's real life wife.Could not wait for the next one:  Dean Malenko and 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Eddie Guerrero and Taz.  I refuse to add the extra Z to Taz's name.  That was a WWE thing and this is him competing in an ECW ring not a WWE ring.  This match was awesome from start to finish.  I think Eddie vs Dean may have been the best classic wrestling feud that the ECW ever had.  When these two were in the ring, it was just magic.  I do remember Taz hurting his neck in this one and that hindered the match a little bit but it was still great.The next match was another great one between Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko for the ECW TV title.  About a week prior Dean had won the title so this was the rematch.  This was a great match, however the only bone I have to pick, is this fan in the crowd.  He's at the bottom of the screen and he's standing the whole time!  He is so distracting.  Thank God that Eddie and Dean are so good you watch them rather than this dork who will not sit down!The next match was Shane Douglas taking on Cactus Jack for the ECW world title.  This was a brutal match between two guys who were trained together.  I like this match but it does feature Cactus doing one of the most disgusting things I have seen anyone do and it involves his spit.  This was the first time that I can remember Cactus having his hands handcuffed and taking multiple chairshots to the head.  He later did that at the Royal Rumber 1999 but you can see an earlier version here and honestly, it may have been more brutal.After that we get a really good match between Chris Jericho and 2 Cold Scorpio.  This was a good match with a lot of technical wrestling.  I expected more high flying but because they suprised me it made it that much better.Up next is a ECW tag title match with Sabu and Rob Van Dam taking on the Eliminators in a match where tables and ladders are legal.  Holy crap!  This was a great match.  They had a series of these matches and this one was one of the best.  Another of these matches were released on the RVD set from WWE but this one was even better.  I've always liked both of these teams and was glad this one was on there however I wish the 30:00 draw they had from November 2 Remember 1996 would have been released instead.  Still, this one is definatly worth checking out.Up next was billed the ""Grudge Match of the Century.""  It featured Sabu taking on Taz.  This was a freaking brutal match.  So many great things about this one.  One thing to look for is Taz ramming his forearm against Sabu's face and breaking his nose.  This match was great but was not the main event of the PPV Barely Legal.  I remember Raven, who was in the main event had a real problem with them two being the only two people on the poster when they weren't in the main event and he was.  Still, this was a great match.  The only thing was confusing, was Bill Alfonso's turn.  It was done kind of poorly.The next match was an ECW world title match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Shane Douglas from November 2 Remember 1997.  This was a rematch as Bam actually shocked the world and became champ a few weeks prior.  This match here was better and was an instant classic.  There were so many twists and turns that at times it was hard to keep up.  Great match and well worth seeing.  Glad to see Bam featured in a match, he was very underrated.Freaking loved the next one for the ECW tag titles at Heat Wave 1998.  It featured Rob Van Dam and Sabu taking on Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinaki.  If you love high flying wrestling then this is the match for you.  This match takes place more in the air then it does in the ring.  It is a great one.  It is awesome to see Hayabusa wrestling before his tragic accident in the ring.  If you like to see the Undertaker walk the ropes wait till you see Shinaki walk the ropes.  Sabu is crazy in this one and RVD steals the show as always.  This is one of my favorite matches on the set and I think you will like it too.The next mach is RVD taking on Jerry Lynn for the ECW TV title.  I'll tell you, if Eddie and Dean wasn't the greatest classic feud in ECW then these guys were.  What a match?  Back and forth, up and down.  This match starts in first gear and never lets up.  This match was great, they had better, but this one was great to see.The next match was Shane Douglas battling Taz for the ECW world title.  I think at this time Taz had been chasing the title for like a year and this was the match the fans had wanted to see.  It was kind of a let down.  Most of the fans hated it and thought it was too slow.  The fans even chant, ""Boring,"" during the match.  It does pick up toward the end but it was still a let down.Up next was Lance Storm and Justin Credible taking on RVD and Jerry Lynn.  Lynn and RVD were kind of an experiment but man they made a great team.  This was a dream match and it did not disappoint.  I loved this on and actually, at the time, hoped that Lynn and RVD would stay a team and for RVD to get rid of Sabu.  Great match.Up next was Masato Tanaka taking on Mike Awesome for the world title.  Awesome match!  These two had a great chemistry and once again it showed in this one.  These two had some insanse chair shots and some insane moves featuring tables.  Loved this one.The next two matches were from Cyberslam.  The first was Taz taking on Tommy Dreamer for the world title.  This was a good match but I have never liked Dreamer at all so for him to win was just sad to me.  After he beat Taz and FINALLY became champ Justin Credible came out and challenged Dreamer and then beat him for the belt.  This match was a little better but I was hoping someone else would have become champion, maybe Lance Storm.  Kind of bad booking if you ask me.The next match was Rhino taking on Sandman for the TV title.  This match was good but I hate Rhino so it wasn't that good.Then, we get Rhino taking on Spike Dudley for the TV title.  This match was better.  I have always considered Spike to be very underrated and this match proves that point once again.  I have to say that I have seen Spike in some big matches, i.e. against Bam Bam, against RVD, etc., and this match was another one of those.  Great match because of Spike.Up next was Jerry Lynn taking on Christian York.  Lynn is one of the best wrestlers ever and this is a waste of a match with him in it.  It's short and doesn't show you just how good Jerry is.  I would have liked to have seen maybe a world title match with him in it.The last match was Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck taking on the FBI taking on Super Crazy and Kid Kash.  Good match and a pretty good way to end the dvd.  I will admit that toward the end of ECW, it was harder and harder to find good matches but this was a good one to include.The blu-ray set has two matches on it from Night the Line Was Crossed.  This was an event that Paul Heyman told everyone was either going to make the company or break it.  The first one was Tommy Dreamer taking on Jimmy Snuka in a pretty good match.  This one wasn't anything to get excited about but it was still good.  The other one was the one hour draw for the world title between Shane Douglas, Terry Funk and Sabu.  This was a great match that I don't know if it would have worked with 2 other guys than Shane and Terry.  Sabu was ok in the match but Terry and Shane is what held this one together.All in all a great set.  Some things I want to see for Vol 2:  Some Cactus matches, another Raven/Dreamer match, would love to see a Raven/Sandman match, maybe another Eddie/Dean match, more Taz matches, definatly some more RVD matches especially the RVD vs Sabu match from Wrestlepalooza 1998 TV title match that went to a 30:00 draw, also some more Bam Bam matches like the one where he won the title would be nice, would like to see some Gangasta and Eliminators matches, I also thought Vol 1 was missing the Dudley Boys so would like to see them in a few matches as well.  So many things that I want to see.  Can't wait for Vol 2 and who knows, maybe we'll get a Vol 3 as well.  They'd be stupid not to keep releasing these.  Fans love ECW like a religion, myself included, and these sets are some of the most purchased sets that WWE sell.  Maybe they should provide some matches and let us choose what will be on it like they did with the WWE championship and IC title dvd sets.  Here's hoping.",4,ECW WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,9864,"['When', 'heard', 'dvd', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'who',
