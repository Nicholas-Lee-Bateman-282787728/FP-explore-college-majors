854948,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00049QQ78,Annie Van Auken,"[10, 10]","WARNER'S BUSTER KEATON COLLECTION is as expected, of fine quality, and a welcome addition to the library of any fan of early 20th Century comedy. Buster's first 3 MGM features are here. Of these, the transfer of FREE AND EASY, his first ""talkie,"" seems a bit dark. The others look quite good. Although given star billing on ""Free.."", Keaton clearly was already being reduced to ""supporting player"" status.The only real flaw of this Buster triple feature is in the commentary tracks. Glenn Mitchell's thoughts during THE CAMERAMAN are particularly distracting, and occasionally inaccurate. His biggest faux pas occurs during the organ grinder scene. Mitchell's concern over the sailor-suited monkey's safety must have clouded his vision here. As Buster and the organ grinder fall to the sidewalk, Mitchell says (paraphrased) ""I have examined this scene closely, and although it looks like they are falling on the monkey, it's clear they fall behind him."" TOTALLY WRONG. If Mitchell had used his DVD player's ""pause"" function, he would have seen that the organ grinder fell IN FRONT and Keaton landed right on top of.... a stiffly posed DOLL. At times during THE CAMERAMAN, Mitchell talks about other movies and actors, and his arcane info adds little to one's viewing pleasure of the picture in progress.The duo of film historians commenting on SPITE MARRIAGE fare even worse. When not giving amateurish readings of a prepared script, these two mutely struggle for something noteworthy to say. Neither rises to the occasion very often. Granted, criticism of DVD ""extra"" features may be going a bit far. On the other hand, would it not have been better to skip commentary tracks altogether than to issue those of such questionable worth?As for Mr. Keaton-- he's simply the best! For your ultimate enjoyment though, watch these three films without the ""expert"" commentaries. And for a really great deal on a BK multi-pack, check out ST. CLAIR'sBUSTER KEATON COLLECTION.

854949,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00049QQ78,Anyechka,"[5, 6]","As has been mentioned, this two-disc set contains one classic funny film, 'The Cameraman,' another film which is also quite good but not quite as great, 'Spite Marriage' (though the scene where the play is being screwed up on the stage is incredibly funny, the funniest bit of the film), a lot of great extras, and one dud, Buster's first talkie, 'Free and Easy.'  It's lovely to hear his voice (which was very pleasant and deeper than some people might expect from a man of such diminutive stature), and I suppose by early talkie standards it's not so bad, but taken with the two classic films, the wonderful documentary about Buster's career and subsequent downfall at MGM (thanks to greedy and inept studio executives who miscast him, gave him poor material, wouldn't let him improvise enough gags, made him do things they thought were funny even though he didn't agree with them, and made him relinquish a lot of the creative control he'd enjoyed prior, when he was an independent), the commentary on the two films, and the interesting photo montages, it stands as a real dud.  The laughs on 'Free and Easy' are few and far between, and even the few funny bits just aren't that funny or inventive.  Like is pointed out in the documentary, when the transition to sound was complete, the bosses wanted verbal comedy instead of slapstick or gags that didn't need to be accompanied by witty banter or an explanation of why it was funny, and so shut out a lot of what makes silent comedy so classic and timeless.  They didn't want to merge the best of both worlds, keeping what was so great about silent comedy and adding the extended possibilities of verbal humor, they just wanted to work with sound comedy alone, even if the performer didn't like it.  For example, that whole bit about ""the queen has swooned,"" where Buster keeps getting the lines mixed up and then saying the wrong things, might actually have been funny if it had been delivered by a comic like Stan Laurel, but Buster's comic persona isn't the type whom we would expect this kind of thing from; he doesn't make it funny or believable that his character would be that inept and stupid as to keep getting the lines mixed up.  At the end of this film, you might even want to cry, first because it ends so suddenly, almost in media res, then again because for once his character doesn't get the girl, then because it's such a pitiful film, then because you know it was the beginning of the end for a comedic legend who was so rudely abused and miscasted by greedy studio bosses, then because it's a sore reminder of what a big step back filmmaking took when the transition to sound was complete (it took at least 7 or 8 years for the craft to recover and get back to making pictures on the masterful level that had been achieved during the last few years of the silent era), then once more because you actually watched the whole thing and can't get that time back.",5,One dud made up for by great everything else,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2931,"['been', 'mentioned', 'two-disc', 'set', 'one', 'classic', 'funny', 'film', 'Cameraman', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'great', ""'Spite"", 'Marriage', 'scene', 'where', 'play', 'being', 'screwed', 'up', 'stage', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'funniest', 'bit', 'film', 'lot', 'great', 'extras', 'one', 'dud', 'Buster', 'first', 'talkie', ""'Free"", 'Easy', 'lovely', 'hear', 'voice', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'deeper', 'people', 'might', 'expect', 'man', 'such', 'diminutive', 'stature', 'suppose', 'early', 'talkie', 'standards', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'taken', 'two', 'classic', 'films', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'Buster', 'career', 'subsequent', 'downfall', 'MGM', 'thanks', 'greedy', 'inept', 'studio', 'executives', 'who', 'miscast', 'gave', 'poor', 'material', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'improvise', 'enough', 'gags', 'made', 'do', 'things', 'thought', 'were', 'funny', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'made', 'relinquish', 'lot', 'creative', 'control', ""'d"", 'enjoyed', 'prior', 'when', 'was', 'independent', 'commentary', 'two', 'films', 'interesting', 'photo', 'montages', 'real', 'dud', 'laughs', ""'Free"", 'Easy', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'even', 'few', 'funny', 'bits', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'inventive', 'pointed', 'out', 'documentary', 'when', 'transition', 'sound', 'was', 'complete', 'bosses', 'wanted', 'verbal', 'comedy', 'instead', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'accompanied', 'witty', 'banter', 'explanation', 'why', 'was', 'funny', 'so', 'shut', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'silent', 'comedy', 'so', 'classic', 'timeless', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'merge', 'best', 'worlds', 'keeping', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'silent', 'comedy', 'adding', 'extended', 'possibilities', 'verbal', 'humor', 'just', 'wanted', 'work', 'sound', 'comedy', 'alone', 'even', 'performer', 'did', ""n't"", 'example', 'whole', 'bit', 'queen', 'swooned', 'where', 'Buster', 'getting', 'lines', 'mixed', 'up', 'then', 'saying', 'wrong', 'things', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'had', 'been', 'delivered', 'comic', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'Buster', 'comic', 'persona', ""n't"", 'type', 'whom', 'would', 'expect', 'kind', 'thing', ""n't"", 'make', 'funny', 'believable', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'inept', 'stupid', 'keep', 'getting', 'lines', 'mixed', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'want', 'cry', 'first', 'so', 'suddenly', 'almost', 'media', 'res', 'then', 'again', 'once', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'then', 'such', 'pitiful', 'film', 'then', 'know', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'comedic', 'legend', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'rudely', 'abused', 'miscasted', 'greedy', 'studio', 'bosses', 'then', 'sore', 'reminder', 'what', 'big', 'step', 'back', 'filmmaking', 'took', 'when', 'transition', 'sound', 'was', 'complete', 'took', 'least', '7', '8', 'years', 'craft', 'recover', 'get', 'back', 'making', 'pictures', 'masterful', 'level', 'had', 'been', 'achieved', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'silent', 'era', 'then', 'once', 'more', 'actually', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'time', 'back']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)
854950,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B00049QQ78,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[0, 0]","Movie magic: Does this term have any significance to you?  No doubt, it does, because you're here reading up a bit on Buster Keaton; one of a score of now legendary performers whose work (collectively speaking) was responsible for putting the ""magic"" in movies.  No doubt, many folks go to the cinema to kill time, see what others are talking about, or simply to be entertained.  All power to such I say, but films' attraction and longevity has another element as well.  And even if it was done only last year, it often bears the fingerprints of the likes of John Ford, Frank Capra, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, Alfred Hitchcock, Harold lloyd, Buster Keaton, and so on.  I'm not saying all film is terrible today in comparison, mind you.  (The case could even be made, I suppose, that just as many quality films are made annually now as were in the 1930s---the heyday of great filmmaking, just that now most of these are art house gems who suffer from the lack of wide exposure.  Remember that in the 1920-30s folks went to the movies a lot more often than people do now---it's a fact; look it up if you like.  Hence we have a few blockbusters anually now instead of a slew of popular films that were widely seen.)  But, what I am saying is that many films from the 1920-30s were absolute treasures; films that really conveyed emotion, that reminded folks---whether they needed it or not---what a joy life can be sometimes.  Watching ""The Cameraman,""  I couldn't help but thinking how neat Buster Keaton & Co. clarified this.  In the film Buster is doing what he can to make ends meet when he chances on a captivating woman (played fabulously by Marceline Day).  But they get separated before he can give her the tintype photo he has taken of her.  So he goes-a-looking for her.  She's flattered.  He expresses interest in the world of her job, a film news agency; thinking maybe he could do something like that, but gets short shrift from the higher-ups there.  Then she begins to advise him a bit.  It's the old notion of there's a good woman behind every successful man.  And it's played out with such simple grace and whimsy in this film that you cannot not like this film.  It's an emotive, human, gem.  Buster Keaton didn't smile in his films; didn't laugh; didn't cry; wasn't outwardly expressive facially, but nevertheless was wonderfully transparent.  You know exactly what he is thinking, how he is feeling at all times.  They called him ""stoneface,"" but that's not as contradictory as it sounds.  Our true feeling, after all, are more often than not conveyed by mere subtleties.  Keaton, Chaplin, & Lillian Gish, I'd offer, were masters of this; in effect, conveying 5 pages of dialogue for each silent scene they acted through.  See ""Sherlock Jr.,"" ""City Lights""/""The Kid""/""The Gold Rush""  & ""Way Down East"" in addition to ""The Cameraman.""  P.S. The Keaton talkie ""Free & Easy"" in this collection is almost a waste of time; and Keaton's talents.  ""Spite Marriage"" is enjoyable, but it's no classic; and the (sparse) audio commentary on it is mundane.  P.P.S.

Lessley returned to work with Keaton on The Cameraman after a period of working with Harry Langdon and others, Keaton and Lessley last picture before The Cameraman was Go West.  The choice of Lessley is important, he has the ability to get an almost dream like quality to the picture which is just perfect for this movie and the storyline. There are a couple of scene that are just brilliant, one is the Pool (you know exactly where Rowan Atkinson got his ideas from) and the other is at the Beach when the girl goes off with his rival, he just breaks your heart.  I also love the music that goes with this movie.Spite Marriage is of interest of course because of the fact that during the making of this movie Keaton and Sebastian started their on and off affair.  The story should work and there are lots of little bits of business that are very funny, but somehow it just doesn't for me. Good chance to see Keaton's Yacht which is featured toward the end of the movie.Free and Easy is sad to watch, sad that MGM had no idea what to do with Keaton except dress him up as a clown and make him dance as a puppet.

854952,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00049QQ78,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","...someone somewhere once wrote. This DVD set is an object lesson as to how that heartbreak occurred. It shows how Keaton declined in status from independent comic filmmaker to sad clown to someone whom the film industry considered an unemployable alcoholic in only a five year span, 1928 - 1933. Before you view this you should view Buster's silent features and shorts from the 1920s so that you get a full appreciation of the death of the career of a comic heavyweight.The Cameraman (1928), Buster's first film at MGM, is as good as any feature he did as an independent with maybe the exception of The General. This film largely left his original filmmaking team intact. Spite Marriage (1929), Buster's final silent film, is still a very good one, but it just seems to lack that complete Keaton signature present in his earlier features. A prime example of this is when Keaton's character tries to cheer up his new bride with a stuffed doll of a dog that has a tear in its eye. Buster never went for the sentimental approach when he had a completely free hand. At this point MGM had largely dismantled Keaton's filmmaking team and replaced them with their own people. Plus, they were interfering more with what Buster wanted to do with the story. The lesson MGM took away from the success of The Cameraman was not that Buster's approach and comic instincts were good, it was that their assembly line approach worked.The final blow is in 1930's ""Free and Easy"", Buster's third feature for MGM and his first talking picture. Here Buster has no creative control and has been reduced to a reciter of lines and performer of stunts while Robert Montgomery inexplicably crowds Keaton out of the limelight. To be fair, many very early talkie efforts suffer from the same set of problems as this one - bad dialogue, thin if not inane plots, musical numbers inserted where they really don't belong - overall the new talking picture technology being in the driver's seat rather than the art of film making. What makes this film so sad is that one of the most creative guys on the MGM lot has been reduced to ""who's on first"" type verbal gags that don't suit him, and in the closing number is a puppet swinging through the air in a clown's outfit with his puppet strings being controlled by figures off stage - a fitting visual metaphor for what is to come in Keaton's future MGM films.The 40 minute documentary that wraps up the set - ""So Funny It Hurt: Buster Keaton and MGM"" ties everything together and even has footage of Keaton himself talking about his decline at MGM. He was basically bewildered at how such bad films as his early talkies were such a success at the box office while his own silent works that he thought were so good had not been nearly as successful. This loss of both his self-confidence and a creative outlet as well as the break-up of his first marriage led to his descent into alcoholism and ultimately his dismissal from MGM.The odd thing about all of this is that Buster Keaton himself is probably the only person who didn't consider his treatment and string of bad luck a tragedy.

854953,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00049QQ78,Chip Kaufmann,"[14, 16]","THE CAMERAMAN is one of my favorite Keaton films and it's great to have it in about as good a shape as we're ever likely to see it with a suitable new score from Arthur Barrow. This film illustrates what Keaton's career at MGM could have been like if only the top brass had listened to him. SPITE MARRIAGE, Buster's last silent and almost as good as THE CAMERAMAN, is in great shape and features its original 1929 soundtrack which is also in good shape although I would have liked the option of a modern track to choose from.There can be no choices regarding FREE AND EASY. Being Keaton's first talkie the soundtrack is an essential part of the film and showcases what was to be Buster's downfall, the move away from visual to verbal gags and the transformation of his character from resourceful self-sufficiency to a hapless boob who no longer gets the girl. This transformation is clearly shown in the new Photoplay Productions documentary SO FUNNY IT HURT: BUSTER KEATON AT MGM which rounds out this 2 DVD set.As in TCM Archives earlier offering of Lon Chaney films, this is a first class presentation with quality packaging and loads of bonus material. Interesting as entertainment and fascinating as history as you see how sound and the corporate mentality nearly destroyed one of the greatest comedy talents of all time. In one of the best examples of true poetic justice, Keaton lived long enough to see himself back on top (although he never understood why) and now he's more popular with today's audiences than Chaplin.",5,Five Star Presentation.

Your only other choice is to get it as a sole title on VHS:Cameraman [VHS]. A shame, but there you have it. Therefore, not having seen the other titles, this is a review of THE CAMERMAN only. So sue me!!This is BK's first film under contract with MGM - and boy, does MGM play it to the hilt. Poor BK would never be the same, and as such, this film is rarely mentioned with BK's other greats - and is often overlooked. Here he plays a poor tintype street photographer who meets a pretty lady. She inspires him to become a newsreel cameraman, the on-the-spot reporter of the day. You can thank all those cameramen, as this film does, for bringing us newsreels.In an intense, Hitchcockian (well, really it is Keatonian) camera shot, we see the building sign in the MGM lobby, zoomed in so we can see where BK is going to ask for his job. The camera then zooms out quickly to a pan shot of the lobby. Pretty cool, and often copied since it is like everything else decades ahead of its time. BK makes a pest of himself but he gets to capture some newsreel footage as a sort of job application. The use of splitscreen (to show how bad his work is) will stun you in a film this old.BK keeps at it, determined to get his newsreel and become a regular. On his animadventures he acquires an annoying little organ grinder's monkey - but I have to say the monkey does acquit himself well in the end. This particular film is at certain moments annoying and badly paced, not to mention some eyeball-splitting editing errors that Keaton would have never allowed. But he signed on with MGM so he wouldn't have to worry about any of that stuff.Scenes you cannot miss:1 - the staircase routine2 - the spa swimming pool routine in which BK's rear end is clearly seen (not bad)3 - the Tong War, filmed in a real Chinatown with real Chinese actors4 - the film-within-a-film that saves BK at the endThough I consider this film a step down from BK's greatest work, I will not deduct one star. It is a great, modern film in its own way and a brilliant silent movie even for all that.BK has traded in his signature flattened fedora for a newsboy cap; perhaps that is a sort of omen for the drop in BK's quality films and his loss of autonomy. However, in a couple of scenes he does have a normal black Stetson of the type he modified into his signature hat - you'll readily recognize it, he's wearing it in the photo on the cover art of this DVD - and I will always wonder if that was an unconscious mourning gesture on BK's part.That is why I recommend it and have reviewed it. The film is simply too brilliant and ahead of its time. You must add it to your collection. Then watch it in honor of BK, mourn his artistic loss of freedom and his contract work that eventually ground the life out of him. It's all here.",5,"""What're you doin'?

854955,A29QA79VLQGHY6,B00049QQ78,Flipper Campbell,"[2, 2]","Comedy and tragedy get equal billing in this unspooling of three films the silent-era comic made under the thumb of MGM at the dawn of the sound age. The two-disc set is billed as ""a celebration of Keaton's art,"" but the party is best saved for his earlier works as an indie. Of the films here, only the silent ""The Cameraman"" comes guaranteed to charm contemporary audiences. The other two have their moments but play today more as Keaton curiosities.This set succeeds because its compilers and commentators never flinch in placing the films in their historical context. The later films are in part evidence of an artist's destruction via corporate abuse and career vandalism. And so viewers are encouraged to hiss as the studio makes its villainous entrance in ""So Funny It Hurt: Buster Keaton at MGM,"" a new 40-minute documentary that should be viewed as the gateway to the set.The wildly successful ""The Cameraman"" gives few hints of what was to come. TCM host Robert Osborne calls the film ""one of the true Keaton classics,"" and it appears here nearly intact, in reasonably good shape. The film's original negative was lost in a vault fire, but restorers later located a master positive that had been set aside as source material for an MGM highlights film. The positive was incomplete, however, so video quality on the DVD lurches about.The DVD version of ""The Cameraman"" comes alive with a new score from Arthur Barrow, an alumnus of Frank Zappa's bands. The score respects the silent traditions but doesn't hesitate to innovate, as in the psychedelic wisps in the opium den scene.Commentator Glenn Mitchell provides a good excuse to run the film twice -- the British academic has a good story to go with nearly every scene. (He appears to be reading, though, and through some editing error tells the history of the print twice, moments apart.)""Spite Marriage"" was Keaton's last silent, famous for its scene in which the comic tries to get his drunk bride onto the bed. The video looks good and is complete. The film has some great gags, with co-star Dorothy Sebastian tough enough to stay right in step with Keaton's physical comedy. But while ""The Cameraman"" still seems fresh, ""Spite Marriage"" feels like an old movie.""Free and Easy"" devolves into an awkward MGM backstage musical. Keaton not only talked, but he also sang and danced on the title number. His loping voice seemed just fine for the talkies, but the jokes are in short supply here. The print suffers from plenty of scratches and splotches; there is no commentary to prolong the experience.",4,Smile for The Camerman,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2563,"['Comedy', 'tragedy', 'get', 'equal', 'billing', 'unspooling', 'three', 'films', 'silent-era', 'comic', 'made', 'thumb', 'MGM', 'dawn', 'sound', 'age', 'two-disc', 'set', 'billed', 'celebration', 'Keaton', 'art', 'party', 'best', 'saved', 'earlier', 'works', 'indie', 'films', 'here', 'only', 'silent', 'Cameraman', 'guaranteed', 'charm', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'other', 'two', 'have', 'moments', 'play', 'today', 'more', 'Keaton', 'curiosities.This', 'set', 'compilers', 'commentators', 'never', 'flinch', 'placing', 'films', 'historical', 'context', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'part', 'evidence', 'artist', 'destruction', 'corporate', 'abuse', 'career', 'vandalism', 'viewers', 'are', 'encouraged', 'hiss', 'studio', 'villainous', 'entrance', 'So', 'Funny', 'Hurt', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'MGM', 'new', '40-minute', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'gateway', 'set.The', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Cameraman', 'few', 'hints', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'TCM', 'host', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'film', 'one', 'true', 'Keaton', 'classics', 'here', 'nearly', 'intact', 'reasonably', 'good', 'shape', 'film', 'original', 'negative', 'was', 'lost', 'vault', 'fire', 'restorers', 'later', 'located', 'master', 'positive', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'aside', 'source', 'material', 'MGM', 'highlights', 'film', 'positive', 'was', 'incomplete', 'however', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'about.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'Cameraman', 'alive', 'new', 'score', 'Arthur', 'Barrow', 'alumnus', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'bands', 'score', 'silent', 'traditions', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'innovate', 'psychedelic', 'wisps', 'opium', 'den', 'scene.Commentator', 'Glenn', 'Mitchell', 'good', 'excuse', 'run', 'film', 'twice', 'British', 'academic', 'good', 'story', 'go', 'nearly', 'scene', 'be', 'reading', 'editing', 'error', 'history', 'print', 'twice', 'moments', 'apart', 'Spite', 'Marriage', 'was', 'Keaton', 'last', 'silent', 'famous', 'scene', 'comic', 'tries', 'get', 'drunk', 'bride', 'bed', 'video', 'good', 'complete', 'film', 'great', 'gags', 'co-star', 'Dorothy', 'Sebastian', 'tough', 'enough', 'stay', 'right', 'step', 'Keaton', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Cameraman', 'still', 'fresh', 'Spite', 'Marriage', 'feels', 'old', 'movie', 'Free', 'Easy', 'awkward', 'MGM', 'backstage', 'musical', 'Keaton', 'not', 'only', 'talked', 'also', 'sang', 'danced', 'title', 'number', 'loping', 'voice', 'seemed', 'just', 'fine', 'talkies', 'jokes', 'are', 'short', 'supply', 'here', 'print', 'suffers', 'plenty', 'scratches', 'splotches', 'commentary', 'prolong', 'experience']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)

The film is still worth watching to catch a glimpse of Keaton dancing.

Therefore viewing this as silent is to say the least, inappropriate.Spite Marriage is a good example of a movie in the transition to the talkie era and for this reason it should be paised for its historic values as much as Keaton's charm.The original music score is top-notch from the beginning to the end.Once you hear the original music score, it is sure to haunt you for the time being!The ro^le he plays is more sympathetic than ever.The leading lady who was his real lover at the time of shooting actually makes a good couple with Keaton.3 Free and Easy(1930): Needless to say Keaton's first talkie, this masterpiece, in my opinion, is often knocked by Keaton's fans in general.I hate it that this film does not have a happy ending for Keaton, however he in this movie reveals his long hidden talent for singing and dancing.The plot is funny but I regret that while MGM and Keaton's long-standing fellow director Edward Sedgwick were successful in presenting Keaton as  an excellent singer and dancer, they seem to have been completely unsuccessful in presenting Keaton as what he had been appreciated for as an acrobatic and athletic comedian.This is mainly due to the casting of Robert Montgomery who steals Keaton's sweetheart and overly generous casting of the MGM stars of the time and went so far as to conclude the great stoneface's commemorative first talkie by casting him as an embarrassing and broken-hearted jester.However Keaton, even almost deprived of his creativity as an acrobatic silent comedian, defies all the bad points I mentioned above and makes his first talkie worth seeing for us Keaton buffs.Lastly in addition to featuring the above three masterpieces of Buster Keaton under the MGM contract, this DVD box serves as a good textbook of Hollywood and educational material for deeper introduction to Buster keaton as a great star and as a man off-screen.Such materials are a documentary produced by Kevin brownlow and audio commentaries by noted film historians.In conclusion, Keaton's early MGM features are exellent in their own rights and they are made further attractive by the presentation of this DVD filled with educational materials I mentioned above.",5,A set of Keaton's masterpieces at MGM enhanced by the box's top-notch presentation.,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3418,"['details', 'DVD', 'set', 'already', 'given', 'fullest',

The Cameraman is very good and funny but there are earlier Keaton comedies that are better.  Spite Marriage for me was pretty uninteresting and not so exciting to watch.  Free and Easy in my opinion was terrible and it was apparent that the MGM and Keaton collaboration was pretty weak and not working well.  I found the Keaton documentary very interesting and informative on Keaton's life during his MGM years.  Most of the information I didn't know before and that he worked with MGM on developing comedic talent such as Red Skelton and Jimmy Durante was new to me.  The discussion of Keaton's drinking is mostly minimized as is his first marriage to Margaret Talmage.  Imagine making the Keaton sympathetic as the documentary mentions his drinking as being a reason that his marriage failed and his job loss as well as the fact he tried to kidnap his kids and take the to Mexico.  The documentary sympathetically says ""He just wanted to take his kids on vacation.""  His ex-wife called police and had him stopped at the border.  In the end she changed the kids last names to hers and he loss the villa which belonged to her!  The Talmages were a wealthy family.  I found that part of the documentary was a hoot.  I'm very glad Keaton finally found his true love in the end.

854961,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00049QQ78,mrliteral,"[1, 1]","Having not too long ago had the pleasure of seeing a set of Harold Lloyd's film, I felt it was time to expand my silent comedy horizons.  The Buster Keaton Collection is my first real exposure to the stone-faced actor, a trio of films from his MGM years, which also were the period when talkies first replaced silent movies.  As discussed in the commentaries and in the accompanying documentary, the MGM years were not kind to Keaton, whose free-wheeling form of film-making did not agree with the rigid studio format:  because of this, this collection also documents the beginning of the end of Keaton's career.The first disc in this two disc set has a pair of silent movies.  The Cameraman has Keaton as a tintype photographer who falls for a girl working for a newsreel company.  Determined to win her over, he gets a motion picture camera and goes in search of news, all the while wooing her.  There's some wonderful physical comedy, but only a couple scenes used the old Keaton style.  Ironically, MGM would use The Cameraman for years as a demonstration of how to do a comedy, though more of the success seems due to Keaton's creativity and MGM's strict rules on movie-making.Even better than The Cameraman is Spite Marriage, Keaton's last silent film.  In this movie, he plays a clothes cleaner hopelessly enamored with a stage actress.  Borrowing clothes from his unknowing customers, he impersonates a wealthy man.  Unfortunately, she is in love with a fellow actor, but when he starts cheating on her, out of spite, she marries Keaton.  Though she quickly regrets her decision, a dejected Keaton will eventually get a second chance to win her over.The third film, Free and Easy, is a letdown after the first two films.  This is Keaton's first talkie, and though he does an adequate job, this movie suffers from a number of flaws.  In particular, like most early talkies, the dialogue is rather stiff, and with the studios trying to fully utilize the new aspect of sound, the emphasis is more on dialogue than the physical humor that is Keaton's forte.  There is some of this physical humor, but it is clearly diminished.  The ending of this movie is also certain to disappoint most viewers, though I won't spoil things by saying how or why.Although Keaton would continue to make commercially successful movies for a few years, his years of quality material had clearly passed him by, done in by the new medium of sound pictures and the policies of MGM (and if there is a villain in the reality behind these movies, it is clearly MGM).Free and Easy may be three star fare, but the first two movies are just as clearly five-star material, and with the supplemental materials (including commentaries, a documentary and still pictures), this is easily a five star set.  If you enjoy silent comedy, this is well worth picking up.",5,The Rise and Fall of Buster Keaton,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2834,"['Having', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'set', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'expand', 'silent', 'comedy', 'horizons', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Collection', 'first', 'real', 'exposure', 'stone-faced', 'actor', 'trio', 'films', 'MGM', 'years', 'also', 'were', 'period', 'when', 'talkies', 'first', 'replaced', 'silent', 'movies', 'discussed', 'commentaries', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'MGM', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'kind', 'Keaton', 'free-wheeling', 'form', 'film-making', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'rigid', 'studio', 'format', 'collection', 'also', 'documents', 'beginning', 'end', 'Keaton', 'career.The', 'first', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'pair', 'silent', 'movies', 'Cameraman', 'Keaton', 'tintype', 'photographer', 'who', 'girl', 'working', 'newsreel', 'company', 'Determined', 'win', 'over', 'motion', 'picture', 'camera', 'search', 'news', 'while', 'wooing', 'wonderful', 'physical', 'comedy', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'used', 'old', 'Keaton', 'style', 'Ironically', 'MGM', 'would', 'use', 'Cameraman', 'years', 'demonstration', 'how', 'do', 'comedy', 'more', 'success', 'due', 'Keaton', 'creativity', 'MGM', 'strict', 'rules', 'movie-making.Even', 'better', 'Cameraman', 'Spite', 'Marriage', 'Keaton', 'last', 'silent', 'film', 'movie', 'clothes', 'cleaner', 'hopelessly', 'enamored', 'stage', 'actress', 'Borrowing', 'clothes', 'unknowing', 'customers', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Unfortunately', 'love', 'fellow', 'actor', 'when', 'cheating', 'spite', 'Keaton', 'quickly', 'decision', 'dejected', 'Keaton', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'win', 'over.The', 'third', 'film', 'Free', 'Easy', 'letdown', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Keaton', 'first', 'talkie', 'adequate', 'job', 'movie', 'number', 'flaws', 'particular', 'most', 'early', 'talkies', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'stiff', 'studios', 'trying', 'fully', 'utilize', 'new', 'aspect', 'sound', 'emphasis', 'more', 'dialogue', 'physical', 'humor', 'Keaton', 'forte', 'physical', 'humor', 'clearly', 'diminished', 'ending', 'movie', 'also', 'certain', 'disappoint', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'things', 'saying', 'how', 'Keaton', 'would', 'continue', 'make', 'commercially', 'successful', 'movies', 'few', 'years', 'years', 'quality', 'material', 'had', 'clearly', 'passed', 'done', 'new', 'medium', 'sound', 'pictures', 'policies', 'MGM', 'villain', 'reality', 'movies', 'clearly', 'MGM', '.Free', 'Easy', 'may', 'be', 'three', 'star', 'fare', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'clearly', 'five-star', 'material', 'supplemental', 'materials', 'including', 'commentaries', 'documentary', 'still', 'pictures', 'easily', 'five', 'star', 'set', 'enjoy', 'silent', 'comedy', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)
854962,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B00049QQ78,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[3, 3]","Making ""the biggest mistake of my career"" (in Buster Keaton's own words) by signing with MGM, Keaton left behind his independent filmmaking days for good. MGM dangled the bait before Buster: Better budgets and more distribution. What they failed to mention was that Buster would be there in the capacity of ""performer only""; he traded his creative freedom to work at a more streamlined studio, becoming another ""cog"" in the giant MGM system ""wheel"".TCM lovingly assembled this homage to a great comedic talent who was living the beginning of his end when both the movie system and talkies launched a slow, painful decline for the once-great silent star.The best film on this package is easily ""The Cameraman"". While it is a more conventional story for Buster, it also contains some of the best comedy work he's ever done. Keaton's physical prowess is absolutely stunning as he races through a busy city street on foot, arms & legs pumping like mad (especially on the gag which he drops the phone, runs down the street, and faces his surprised object-of-affection just as she's hanging up the phone!). Highlights in the film include: Buster playing a solitary game of baseball inside an empty stadium; a hilarious dip in a public pool (complete with sharing a changing room with another man and losing his swimsuit in the water); and covering a Tong War in Chinatown (excellently staged with Keaton's trademark sight gags).His final silent, ""Spite Marriage"", is even more conventional in theme and story (a jealous actress spites her flirtatious boyfriend by marrying a pants presser--guess who!--hence, the title). Although Keaton fought to get his own ideas on screen (and lost the battle most of the time), there is one thing interesting about this unique talent: No matter how slight the material, Keaton's sublime presence cannot be ignored. His antics during a Civil War stage drama and later, on a deserted boat, are quite hilarious.And finally, his first talking picture, ""Free and Easy"", demonstrates how sadly mis-used Keaton was in the new medium. MGM chose projects that were completely ill-suited to Buster's talents. Here, Keaton plays what he calls his ""Elmer"" role (the first in many)---an imbecilic idiot part. Add to that Keaton's croaking voice, a contradiction which turns his character from a stoic hero into a fool. The best film moments, of course, come in the no-dialogue segments, which Keaton does his best silent bits; unfortunately, they are few and far between.The DVD extras include a documentary called ""So Funny It Hurts: Buster Keaton and MGM"", hosted by actor James Karen, who knew Buster during his final years. ""So Funny..."" gives a lot of fascinating insight into the business relationship between Buster & MGM, complete with glimpses into his personal life, his career after being fired from MGM, and a 1964 interview with the man himself.This DVD collection is a must for fans who are interested in Keaton's career as he transitioned through MGM and beyond.",5,Buster Keaton and the Lion,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,2995,"['Making', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'career', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'own', 'words', 'signing', 'MGM', 'Keaton', 'left', 'behind', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'days', 'good', 'MGM', 'dangled', 'bait', 'Buster', 'Better', 'budgets', 'more', 'distribution', 'What', 'failed', 'mention', 'was', 'Buster', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'capacity', 'performer', 'only', 'traded', 'creative', 'freedom', 'work', 'more', 'streamlined', 'studio', 'becoming', 'cog', 'giant', 'MGM', 'system', 'wheel', 'lovingly', 'assembled', 'homage', 'great', 'comedic', 'talent', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'beginning', 'end', 'when', 'movie', 'system', 'talkies', 'launched', 'slow', 'painful', 'decline', 'once-great', 'silent', 'star.The', 'best', 'film', 'package', 'easily', 'Cameraman', 'more', 'conventional', 'story', 'Buster', 'also', 'best', 'comedy', 'work', 'ever', 'done', 'Keaton', 'physical', 'prowess', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'busy', 'city', 'street', 'foot', 'arms', 'legs', 'pumping', 'mad', 'especially', 'gag', 'phone', 'down', 'street', 'surprised', 'object-of-affection', 'just', 'hanging', 'up', 'phone', 'Highlights', 'film', 'include', 'Buster', 'playing', 'solitary', 'game', 'baseball', 'empty', 'stadium', 'hilarious', 'dip', 'public', 'pool', 'complete', 'sharing', 'changing', 'room', 'man', 'losing', 'swimsuit', 'water', 'covering', 'Tong', 'War', 'Chinatown', 'excellently', 'staged', 'Keaton', 'trademark', 'sight', 'gags', '.His', 'final', 'silent', 'Spite', 'Marriage', 'even', 'more', 'conventional', 'theme', 'story', 'jealous', 'actress', 'flirtatious', 'boyfriend', 'marrying', 'pants', 'presser', 'guess', 'who', 'hence', 'title', 'Keaton', 'fought', 'get', 'own', 'ideas', 'screen', 'lost', 'battle', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'thing', 'interesting', 'unique', 'talent', 'matter', 'how', 'slight', 'material', 'Keaton', 'sublime', 'presence', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'antics', 'Civil', 'War', 'stage', 'drama', 'later', 'deserted', 'boat', 'are', 'quite', 'hilarious.And', 'finally', 'first', 'talking', 'picture', 'Free', 'Easy', 'how', 'sadly', 'mis-used', 'Keaton', 'was', 'new', 'medium', 'MGM', 'chose', 'projects', 'were', 'completely', 'ill-suited', 'Buster', 'talents', 'Here', 'Keaton', 'what', 'Elmer', 'role', 'first', 'many', '-an', 'imbecilic', 'idiot', 'part', 'Add', 'Keaton', 'croaking', 'voice', 'contradiction', 'character', 'stoic', 'hero', 'fool', 'best', 'film', 'moments', 'course', 'come', 'no-dialogue', 'segments', 'Keaton', 'best', 'silent', 'bits', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'documentary', 'called', 'So', 'Funny', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'MGM', 'hosted', 'actor', 'James', 'Karen', 'who', 'knew', 'Buster', 'final', 'years', 'So', 'Funny', 'lot', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'business', 'relationship', 'Buster', 'MGM', 'complete', 'glimpses', 'personal', 'life', 'career', 'being', 'fired', 'MGM', '1964', 'interview', 'man', 'himself.This', 'DVD', 'collection', 'must', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Keaton', 'career', 'transitioned', 'MGM']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)

854964,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00049QQ78,Robert Badgley,"[19, 20]","This is one set as a Keaton fan that you should add to your collection.The rating however should really be three and a half stars.This set comes in a handsome pull apart case housing the two DVDs but I was disappointed to find no booklet/liner notes with details about these new releases,i.e.sources for the prints,restoration work,etc.The Cameraman is the BEST thing about this set.The 90s release of it on VHS came in around 70 minutes and was a poor transfer.By comparison this new version comes in at about 75 minutes and is the most complete commercially released print so far.It has been re-released with a NEW score and not the original featured on the VHS version.I personally would have preferred the original score but the new one does have a certain charm and in the end does justice to the film.With the additional footage/title cards,its' improved and adjusted contrast and overall picture quality, it has heightened,at least to this reviewer,its' reputation and enjoyment as one of Keatons' best films.The next film is Spite Marriage.Two versions were released originally of this film,one a silent and THIS one with sound effects and a musical score.It would have been very nice to have had BOTH in this set for comparison/historical purposes but such was not the case.This print shows absolutely no improvement over the previously released VHS version also released in the 90s.It shows very few signs of being &quot;cleaned up&quot; at all.They have again adjusted the contrast but other than that and the sound being improved through digital means,the film as a re-release (technically) overall is a disappointment.And the final film in this set &quot;Free and Easy&quot; is again, and even MORE so, a technical disappointment.This re-release print is even worse than Spite Marriage,quite &quot;rough&quot; throughout with some footage even out of focus.Seems they just took it out of the vault and with minimal work did a transfer onto DVD and it shows.Certainly unworthy in a release such as this.Rating of these works based on their artistic merits also parallels their techinical merits.The Cameraman is by far the best in plot structure and truest to the Keaton style.It was a fantastic start to his MGM phase but how unfortunate that the lions' vision was so myopic.Spite Marriage lags a ways behind the Cameraman because of the now more noticable studio interference.There are many true Keaton touches throughout but the cumbersome plot and pace often get in the way of enjoying this film more.Free and Easy lags even farther still behind Spite Marriage.The iron fist of the studio is evident throughout this film and the Keaton we knew is now just a player with little room to maneuver.His character has now been &quot;warped&quot; and the &quot;funny&quot; business he speaks and performs fed to him by the script writers falls totally flat.Keaton was a consummate pro and even under these conditions his brilliance still managed to rise to the surface occasionally.His singing and dancing is one highlight out of very few.To add to the enjoyment of this set are commentaries offered for both the Cameraman and Spite Marriage by familiar film historians.Also,and a great delight to this reviewer,is the additonal inclusion of a 38 minute special produced by film historian Kevin Brownlow and narrated/hosted by Keatons' friend and actor James Karen.Two special highlights included in this documentary of Keatons' MGM years are further sound/video clips from his CBC interview of 1964 not included in A Hard Act To Follow and some tantalizing amateur footage of Keaton in New York City during the filming of The Cameraman.A wonderful complimentary piece to this set.In conclusion although this set is technically disappointing in so far as Spite Marriage and  Free and Easy are concerned(thus the 3 1/2 star rating),The Cameraman outshines them both.Historically and artistically, especially in so far as Keatons' career goes,these films are quite important.And with the addition of the added Brownlow documentary this is one set no true Keaton fan should be without.",4,A Keaton

My selected highlight of the film is our 1st chance to see that wonderful comical actor Edward Brophy more famous in the sound era whether playing a gangster both in comedy's or drama. A tough but often humorous character actor. He shares a small changing room with Buster Keaton in The Camerman. You can easily find him in A Slight Case of Murder with Edward G.  Robinson. And with Jimmy Durrante and Buster Keaton in What No Beer?

BUSTER KEATON COLLECTION (Warner) is a two-disc set  that features two of Keaton's funniest silents.  1928's ""The Cameraman,"" has been re-mastered with a new score by former Frank Zappa band member Arthur Barrow, and ""Spite Marriage"" (featuring its original 1929 Vitaphone musical score) along with ""Free and Easy,"" Keaton's first talkie.I loved film historian Kevin Brownlow's bittersweet new documentary ""So Funny It Hurt: Buster Keaton and MGM"" that includes never before seen home movie footage of Keaton on location.Keaton began his career in vaudeville at the age of three. He claimed he was sleeping in a trunk when a tornado hit the town where his parents were performing and he was carried by the twister out of his hotel room to a street hundreds of feet way.  As time passed, Keaton became a consummately dextrous physical comedian devising extraordinarily dangerous stunts for himself that were executed with hardly a change of expression. Was it all a psychological attempt to confront his traumatic childhood tornado experience?  Who knows? Whatever the case, Keaton had an eye for absurd, self-denigrating comedy that can still generate laughs today.Keaton's screen persona was often rooted in a zen-like stillpoint while a chaotic world sometimes literally deconstructed around him.  This element emerges at unexpected moments in this collection.  Chaplin was more famous than Keaton (and made more money), but the contrived sentimentality in many of his films becomes cloying.  Not so with Keaton who often literally risks life and limb for love.",4,THE GREATEST SILENT CLOWN?,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,1621,"['Buster', 'Keaton', 'was', 'best', 'silent', 'clowns', 'BUSTER', 'KEATON', 'COLLECTION', 'Warner', 'two-disc', 'set', 'two', 'Keaton', 'funniest', 'silents', '1928', 'Cameraman', 'been', 're-mastered', 'new', 'score', 'former', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'band', 'member', 'Arthur', 'Barrow', 'Spite', 'Marriage', 'featuring', 'original', '1929', 'Vitaphone', 'musical', 'score', 'Free', 'Easy', 'Keaton', 'first', 'talkie.I', 'loved', 'film', 'historian', 'Kevin', 'Brownlow', 'bittersweet', 'new', 'documentary', 'So', 'Funny', 'Hurt', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'MGM', 'never', 'seen', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'Keaton', 'location.Keaton', 'began', 'career', 'vaudeville', 'age', 'three', 'claimed', 'was', 'sleeping', 'trunk', 'when', 'tornado', 'hit', 'town', 'where', 'parents', 'were', 'performing', 'was', 'carried', 'twister', 'hotel', 'room', 'street', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'way', 'time', 'passed', 'Keaton', 'became', 'consummately', 'dextrous', 'physical', 'comedian', 'devising', 'extraordinarily', 'dangerous', 'stunts', 'were', 'executed', 'hardly', 'change', 'expression', 'Was', 'psychological', 'attempt', 'confront', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'tornado', 'experience', 'Who', 'case', 'Keaton', 'had', 'eye', 'absurd', 'self-denigrating', 'comedy', 'can', 'still', 'generate', 'today.Keaton', 'screen', 'persona', 'was', 'often', 'rooted', 'zen-like', 'stillpoint', 'chaotic', 'world', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'deconstructed', 'element', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'collection', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'more', 'famous', 'Keaton', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'contrived', 'sentimentality', 'many', 'films', 'cloying', 'Not', 'so', 'Keaton', 'who', 'often', 'literally', 'risks', 'life', 'limb', 'love']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)

I only want to register my disagreement with those who claim to like the score that's been attached to ""The Cameraman.""  For a film of this sensitivity and originality to be saddled with such a repetitive, unimaginative, and bland score is a disgrace.  I'm only relieved that it mostly avoided the even worse offenses of the original 1929 score of ""Spite Marriage,"" with its buffoonish ""talking"" saxophones and slide whistles to let us know when we're supposed to laugh.  It degrades Buster Keaton by putting him on the level of a cartoon - which seems to be what MGM thought of him, anyway.  ""Spite Marriage"" has some good things in it and would be better served by a less dated score - at the least, by removing the annoying sound effects.As for Keaton's first talkie, considering how eager he was to start making sound films, it's a tragedy for us now that he never was permitted to make them the way he wanted to.  Who knows what we've been deprived of?  Keaton's approach to the silent film camera was brilliantly original; he might have had a few things to contribute to the sound era as well.

I saw a pristine print of the Cameraman and Spite Marriage at a theater near the Otis Institute in Los Angeles in the late 1970s.  It had very few scratches and a complementary soundtrack from the era.  The current DVD set has a brighter, although scratch laden print (superior to the cut and dark looking VHS tape).  The new soundtrack detracts from the comedy.  My favorite scene at which I got an asthma attack from laughing so hard is the dressing room/swimming pool sequence.  The sound affects and music were perfect at the movie theater.  On the DVD, I'm not laughing because the sound detracts from the action.  It's almost better silent and improves when I substitute some 1920's pop and jazz music.Don't let this from stopping you from purchasing this set.  It may not be reissued for many decades.

854970,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00049QQ78,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[68, 77]","Boy, how I used to hate Ted Turner. Yes, hate. It wasn't too strong of a word. When Turner Classic Movies first began broadcasting, they were intent on colorizing everything. Don't remember colorization? Good! A handful of executives felt that for a classic black and white film to find an audience in the MTV age everything had to be colored in with day glow artificial colors, giving a number of films the look of a bad water color, everyone had the same skin color, making them unwatchable. At one point, Turner even wanted to colorize the early black and white episodes of ""Gilligan's Island"". I'm not sure (nor do I care) if that ever happened.Now, Turner Classic Movies is an invaluable resource for anyone who loves or studies films. Using the MGM vault as their toy chest, and later adding libraries of other studios, they show a remarkable number of hard to find films that are not available on DVD or even video. In the last few years, MGM and Warner Bros. have begun releasing a large number of these films on DVD, using pristine prints, restoring films and creating a host of attractive extras. What a difference a decade makes.Turner Classic Movies has released ""The Buster Keaton Collection"", a two disc set including ""The Cameraman"" (1928), ""Spite Marriage"" (1929) and ""Free and Easy"" (1930), Buster's first talkie. There is also a short documentary called ""Buster Keaton: So Funny It Hurt"" about his brief tenure at MGM. The documentary premiered on Turner Classic Movies.Buster Keaton is one of my favorite film comedians, creating some of the funniest films I have ever seen. During much of his career, Keaton was his own boss. He produced the films he wanted to create and worked on them until he was happy with their content and then released them through distribution deals his partner, Joe Schenck, put together. Sound familiar? This is essentially what Chaplin and Harold Lloyd did as well. But Chaplin was savvier when it came to business. He extracted larger contracts, made more money and retained ownership of all of his films.Because he was his own boss, Keaton had free reign while he worked helping him create such classics as ""The General"". Widely acknowledged as Keaton's masterpiece, the film follows the exploits of a lone Southern engineer as he tries to thwart the plans of the Northern soldiers he comes across. If you have never seen ""The General"", you should. It is a great film and contains many classic comedy moments including an amazing sequence set on two trains speeding down the tracks.""The General"" is not my favorite Keaton film. That would have to be ""Sherlock Jr."" Keaton plays a young man who imagines he is in a film. Amazingly, all of the special effects were created in the camera. When you watch, you will understand what I mean and why it is so amazing.In ""Seven Chances"", Keaton's character has just one day to find a bride and get married to inherit a fortune. Botching the proposal to his girlfriend, his best buddy helps him find a mate and they ask several women, all of whom refuse. Rejected by everyone, Buster goes to the church and falls asleep, waiting for his buddy and lawyer to bring someone to the church. While he is asleep, a newspaper story reveals Keaton is looking for a bride and will inherit a large sum of money upon marriage. When he wakes up, the church is filled with women of all sizes, ages, races and appearances. When they realize Buster is sitting in front of them, they stampede, leading to one of the funniest sequences ever filmed. This films was, unfortunately, remade a few years ago starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger.Or ""The Navigator"", or ""Steamboat Bill, Jr"", or ""Go West"". There are many more classics, too many to list and discuss.What does any of this have to do with ""The Buster Keaton Collection""? It is important to have a brief history to understand why this new DVD set is so important.Even though ""The General"" is acknowledged as Keaton's classic film, this is a development that happened many, many years after the film's release. The film was a major financial disappointment for Keaton. His next film ""College"" earned more money, but the financial pressures experienced after ""The General"" led Schenck to look for a more powerful partner to produce and distribute Keaton's films.Watching ""The Buster Keaton Collection"" is a necessary evil for anyone who is interested in film or silent film history. Containing three films, it represents a good, a bad and one of the lowest points in Keaton's career.Keaton signed with MGM in 1928. As I watched ""The Cameraman"", the first film produced at MGM, I listened to the commentary provided by Glenn Mitchell, author of ""A - Z of Silent Film Comedy"" and I learned a very telling fact. Both Chaplin and Lloyd advised Keaton against signing with MGM. As mentioned, Keaton had a tremendous amount of creative freedom when he worked for himself. At MGM, he became part of a factory and the fit wasn't a good one and would ultimately lead to the end of his career as a filmmaker. MGM insisted that he work from tightly plotted screenplays and he was no longer allowed to work out gags on the set, with the camera rolling. Despite all of these problems, ""The Cameraman"" is quite good. It was also very successful and, according to Mitchell, used as a template for all of the studio's future comedies, including many of the Marx Brothers films.Keaton plays Luke, a tintype operator in New York City. During a large parade, he bumps into Sally (Marceline Day), the receptionist at MGM Newsreels. Pitying him, she agrees to let him take her picture. At the time, tintypes were already ancient. He follows her to the office to return the picture. In an attempt to impress her, he buys an old camera and waits for an assignment. In an effort to encourage him, and thwart the pushy office bully, she sends him on an assignment, which he botches. Later, he goes to cover a parade in Chinatown. At the parade, rival Tong gangs decide to start a war, and Keaton finds he is in the middle of the action.""The Cameraman"" is recognized as Keaton's last great film and it is very good; there is a lot of ""funny business"". Keaton's efforts to photograph the Tong War are especially funny and inventive. Constantly racing around, he has to fend of the warring gang members as he tries to get as close to the action as possible. At one point, a gun shot hits one of the legs of his tripod making it useless. He then decides to put the other two legs in harms way and sure enough, they are soon the same size. Standing on a platform, with a great view of the action, he doesn't realize that the scaffolding is about to give way and the platform swings gracefully to the ground, giving him a great shot.The story is a little awkward and the third act seems sloppy. It was necessary to reestablish Sally's feelings for Keaton and take the bully out of the picture. To do this, an elaborate set piece was created. But if you look at the story, the connection between the main plot and this bit was tenuous at best and detracts from the film.""The Cameraman"" was very successful and only served to re-affirm MGM's belief that Keaton's films should be more tightly scripted. Because the film made money, they felt they were right and Keaton was wrong. 1929's ""Spite Marriage"" is one of those `hybrid' films from the late twenties. Created after the invention of sound, it isn't a `talkie'. MGM wasn't ready to put Keaton in a talkie. Instead, the film contains synced sound effects and music. Much like a laugh track on a television comedy, these sound effects were intended to cue the viewers' feelings and emotions. Watching a silent film with synced sound effects is like watching a foreign film with dubbed voices. It detracts from the film, taking you out of the story.Keaton plays Elmer, a dry cleaner, infatuated with stage actress Trilby Drew (Dorothy Sebastian). He attends every performance of her play wearing a different suit borrowed from his customers. He also waits outside the stage door every night, for some indication that she is aware of his existence. One night, after fighting with her leading man, Trilby talks to Elmer, trying to make the leading man jealous. Elmer knows nothing of this spat and soon agrees to marry her. As the sham marriage progresses, he realizes that she doesn't love him, but will always continue to love her.""Spite Marriage"" contains three memorable sequences. Early in the film, Elmer winds up backstage playing an extra in Trilby's play. The extra has a significant scene in which he holds Trilby after her character has fainted. Naturally, he is so nervous the play becomes a disaster. After they are married, Trilby insists that they go to the same nightclub frequented by her leading man and his new girlfriend. Trilby proceeds to get stinking drunk. Returning to their hotel room, she passes out. Elmer attempts to move her unwieldy body and put her to bed, but she doesn't cooperate and he struggles, in truly comedic fashion, to get her into the bed. The finale, set aboard a steamship involves a band of rumrunners who try to take over the nearly deserted ship. Elmer saves the day. My problem with this sequence is that it seems a retread of a superior sequence in ""The Navigator"", one of Keaton's earlier films. It is different, but doesn't seem to stretch the envelope enough.The less said about ""Free and Easy"" the better. Keaton's first talkie, he essentially becomes a supporting character to Elvira (Anita Page) and Larry (Robert Montgomery), two budding lovers. Elvira wins a small town beauty contest and earns a trip to Hollywood, her mother and Elmer (Keaton) in tow. On the train, they meet Larry, a famous actor. The mother is overbearing. The jokes are completely wrong for Keaton. It is a mess.MGM proceeded to cast Keaton in a series of talkies reliant on jokes and verbal puns, not physical humor, Keaton's trademark. Unable to use his creative skills, Keaton's personal life soon deteriorated and his drinking became excessive. MGM soon paired Keaton with an up and coming comedian, Jimmy Durante. Durante quickly became the headliner and Keaton's contract was not renewed. He managed to eke out a living writing gags for people like the Marx Brothers, acting in two-reelers and industrial training films and appearing on television. A few years later, he began appearing in films like ""In the Good Old Summertime"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Limelight"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"".""Buster Keaton: So Funny It Hurt"" is a short documentary, produced by Kevin Brownlow for Turner Classic Movies. Hosted by actor James Karen, the film follows Keaton's short-lived career at MGM and, essentially, the end of his career. Why Karen? He met Keaton at MGM and they became friends. The documentary is interesting, but far too short to go into any interesting depth. Karen does discuss how Keaton met Eleanor, a young showgirl at MGM. They fell in love and married, the longest of Keaton's marriages, lasting until he died. Eleanor was instrumental in reestablishing interest in her husband's work, getting it shown at museums and repertory houses, leading to people writing about it, which lead to more people watching the films for the first time, which would ultimately lead to people remembering Keaton's place in film history. If you consider how many silent film actors have been virtually wiped off the face of the Earth because their films have all but disappeared, we should all be grateful that Keaton's memory and films live on.Far more interesting is ""Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow"", also produced by Kevin Brownlow and his then partner David Gill. A multi-part documentary produced in the 80s for PBS, it follows Keaton throughout his life. His loves, life and work are all discussed in great detail. Try to catch this on VHS or TV, because it is not yet available on DVD.""The Buster Keaton Collection"" is an essential addition to the library of any film scholar and any fan of the great comedians.",4,Necessary Addition To Your Library,1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,12029,"['Boy', 'how', 'used', 'hate', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'Yes', 'hate', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'When',

854971,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B00049QQ78,Tom Without Pity,"[2, 2]","This is a review for the two disc, three movie set of DVDs issued byTurner Classic Movies Archives entitled ""The Buster Keaton Collection.""The three films included are Buster Keaton's first three films releasedby MGM after the film giant gained control of Keaton's small, independentstudio. And that pretty much tells the story of Keaton's downhill slide fromindependent film maker and comedy star to salaried employee of a studioso mammoth that it took them a year just to find a stage suitable enough tofilm Buster's first talking picture, FREE AND EASY (1930).But the first film in this set is Buster's last, largely independently madefeature, the silent THE CAMERAMAN (1928). THE CAMERAMAN is a masterpiece andI'm sure that most everything Buster ever wanted to put in a picture wasincluded in this one.  Comedy, pathos, a wonderful pantomine sequence filmedin empty Yankee Stadium where Buster plays a game of baseball all byhimself, just great stuff from beginning to end.  And in this movie, more thanany other Keaton film I've seen, the ""great stoneface"" almost cracks a smile twiceand, as one commentator said, really uses his expresive eyes and still unlined faceto great, touching,  advantage. Some of the romantic scenes are so touching I wouldn't have been surprised to have discovered that Frank Borzage had something to do with them.In the second film, SPITE MARRIAGE (1929), Buster is a fanatical fan of a Broadway starwho, through a series of comic incidents, feels it's to her advantage to use her biggestfan in the worst way possible.  She marries him for a torturous period until she's brought to her senses and somehow Buster (as Elmer) helps everything to work out alright.A very funny picture, SPITE MARRIAGE is a silent with sound effects and it comes offpretty well but again, that's probaby because Buster had control of the most interestingparts of the film.Finally, the third title, FREE AND EASY is Buster's first talking picture and he acquits himself well in this rather mediocre production. The story concerns a Kansas beauty contest winner who is awarded a trip to Hollywood and her own agent, Elmer Butz--Buster Keaton--who is used as mostly a scapegoat during this picture while trying to compete with the Hollywood smoothness of young Robert Montgomery while the girl's nagging mothermakes eveything twice as difficult as possible.  While I'm sure that most reading this can guess the ending, it's a shame to see Buster shoved aside for the usual conventional romantic material.  I guess you can say that FREE & EASY marked the beginning of the end for Buster.Although he was a Hollywood regular for 35 years after this picture, Buster's career as the engineer of his own pictures using his ideas, talent and skill was prettymuch over, sad to say.I rate this double disc box set 4 1/2 stars, would've been five stars easily except forFREE & EASY. But THE CAMERAMAN and SPITE MARRIAGE more than make up for the mistepsof the third film in this package.",5,A Real Buster,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2987,"['review', 'two', 'disc', 'three', 'movie', 'set', 'DVDs', 'issued', 'byTurner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'entitled', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Collection', 'three', 'films', 'included', 'are', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'releasedby', 'MGM', 'film', 'giant', 'gained', 'control', 'Keaton', 'small', 'independentstudio', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'Keaton', 'downhill', 'slide', 'fromindependent', 'film', 'maker', 'comedy', 'star', 'salaried', 'employee', 'studioso', 'mammoth', 'took', 'year', 'just', 'find', 'stage', 'suitable', 'enough', 'tofilm', 'Buster', 'first', 'talking', 'picture', 'FREE', 'AND', 'EASY', '1930', '.But', 'first', 'film', 'set', 'Buster', 'last', 'largely', 'independently', 'madefeature', 'silent', 'THE', 'CAMERAMAN', '1928', 'CAMERAMAN', 'masterpiece', 'andI', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'everything', 'Buster', 'ever', 'wanted', 'put', 'picture', 'wasincluded', 'one', 'Comedy', 'pathos', 'wonderful', 'pantomine', 'sequence', 'filmedin', 'empty', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'where', 'Buster', 'game', 'baseball', 'just', 'great', 'stuff', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'more', 'thanany', 'other', 'Keaton', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'great', 'stoneface', 'almost', 'smile', 'twiceand', 'one', 'commentator', 'said', 'really', 'expresive', 'eyes', 'still', 'unlined', 'faceto', 'great', 'touching', 'advantage', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'touching', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'have', 'discovered', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'them.In', 'second', 'film', 'SPITE', 'MARRIAGE', '1929', 'Buster', 'fanatical', 'fan', 'Broadway', 'starwho', 'series', 'comic', 'incidents', 'advantage', 'use', 'biggestfan', 'worst', 'way', 'possible', 'torturous', 'period', 'brought', 'senses', 'somehow', 'Buster', 'Elmer', 'everything', 'work', 'out', 'alright.A', 'very', 'funny', 'picture', 'SPITE', 'MARRIAGE', 'silent', 'sound', 'effects', 'offpretty', 'well', 'again', 'probaby', 'Buster', 'had', 'control', 'most', 'interestingparts', 'film.Finally', 'third', 'title', 'FREE', 'AND', 'EASY', 'Buster', 'first', 'talking', 'picture', 'well', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'production', 'story', 'Kansas', 'beauty', 'contest', 'winner', 'who', 'awarded', 'trip', 'Hollywood', 'own', 'agent', 'Elmer', 'Butz', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'who', 'used', 'mostly', 'scapegoat', 'picture', 'trying', 'compete', 'Hollywood', 'smoothness', 'young', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'girl', 'nagging', 'mothermakes', 'eveything', 'twice', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'reading', 'can', 'guess', 'ending', 'shame', 'see', 'Buster', 'shoved', 'aside', 'usual', 'conventional', 'romantic', 'material', 'guess', 'can', 'say', 'FREE', 'EASY', 'marked', 'beginning', 'end', 'Buster.Although', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'regular', '35', 'years', 'picture', 'Buster', 'career', 'engineer', 'own', 'pictures', 'using', 'ideas', 'talent', 'skill', 'was', 'prettymuch', 'sad', 'say.I', 'rate', 'double', 'disc', 'box', 'set', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'five', 'stars', 'easily', 'forFREE', 'EASY', 'THE', 'CAMERAMAN', 'SPITE', 'MARRIAGE', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'mistepsof', 'third', 'film', 'package']",Buster Keaton Collection: (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)
854972,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00049QQ78,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","Giving up his independence and moving to MGM was the beginning of the end for Buster Keaton's career as a major star and creative force, but TCM's rather good two-disc set offers the best of his tenure at the studio before he was relegated to straight man duties opposite Jimmy Durante.Right from the start of his contract, with 1928's The Cameraman, it's obvious that the studio is trying to get its new star to fit their in-house studio formula, and for much of the first third of the film there's more pathos than laughs as it takes an inordinately long time to set up its plot (Buster's tintype street photographer tries to make it as a newsreel cameraman to win the girl of his dreams). There's even a banana skin joke at one point, but thankfully things pick up with a brilliant fire truck gag and an inspired mime sequence in an empty Yankee Stadium that sees him acting out a ballgame (one of only two scenes he was allowed to improvise) before going on to a prolonged less-than-perfect date sequence at a swimming baths that allows the star to forget about the plot and throw in some great sight gags. Yet you can constantly sense the conflict between the comedy and the plot: Buster's disastrous double-exposed newsreel footage that sees a battleship sailing down Wall Street probably would have been a much longer display of effects and trickery in a pre-MGM film, but here the sequence is surprisingly brief - just enough to make the story move ahead. But there's still plenty to enjoy - the wonderfully executed single take sequence that sees him racing down and despondently trudging back up the stairs waiting for a phone call, his destructive attempts to smash open a piggy bank (the film's only other improvised scene) and the spectacular Chinatown Tong war sequence that even throws in a monkey with a machinegun!Rather more consistent despite perhaps not having quite so many comic highlights is Spite Marriage, which sees his adoring stage door Johnny married to the actress of his dreams when she is spurned by her co-star. He's seemingly oblivious to the fact she's a drunken nightmare who wants a quiet divorce as soon as she realises the effect the marriage might have on her popularity, but circumstances lead to Buster finding himself alone with her on an abandoned luxury yacht. Although the studio were eager for him to stop doing his own stunts, there's still an impressive prolonged not quite falling overboard sequence, though it's the scene where he puts his blind drunk other half to bed that's both the film's highlight and one of the funniest sequences of his entire career. It comes as no great surprise that the studio wanted to cut it.Having already removed nearly all of his regular crew except for director Edward Sedgwick, the studio then set about removing almost everything that made his screen persona a success with his next film. Despite the studio throwing money and cameoing stars and directors at it (Lionel Barrymore, Cecil B. De Mille, Fred Niblo, Jackie Coogan and William Haines among them), his first talkie, Free and Easy is, to put it mildly, abysmal. Along with his marriage, Keaton's problems with MGM turned him to the bottle and this film is so incredibly bad it nearly did the same for me trying to watch it. Despite his gravel tones, the problem isn't the move to talking pictures - Keaton had planned Spite Marriage as a talkie, but MGM's only soundstage was booked solid at the time. It's that the film is almost unrecognisable as a Keaton film, dropping him into a substandard smalltown-innocent-in-Hollywood plot and not allowing him an inch of breathing space or creative control to do anything to improve it by forcing him to stick to a script that plays against his strengths and, worse still, casts him as a loser who doesn't win through in a dire Laugh, Clown, Laugh-style ending. There's virtually no physical comedy, no chance to show his athleticism, no technical ingenuity (it has all the worst sins of static early talkies). It's like casting Jackie Chan in a 90-minute monologue. A few moments with Doris McMahon's appealing native dancer and the odd glimpse of how the studio wanted its fans to see it aside, there's nothing to recommend it, and nothing underlines the studio's attitude to its star than a scene where Niblo insists Keaton sticks to the script or the musical number that sees him as a puppet pulled around by unseen hands.Rounding out the set is an excellent 38-minute Kevin Brownlow-Patrick Stanbury documentary So Funny It Hurt covering Keaton's tragic decline at the studio. If the US version of Free and Easy is bad, the Spanish and German language versions he filmed simultaneously, learning the lines phonetically and delivering them mechanically, look even worse, while - a genuinely charming scene from WW1 comedy Doughboys aside - the sparingly used footage from his later MGM films as his drinking became more noticeable onscreen is desperately sad coming so few years after the genius and athleticism of films like Steamboat Bill Jr. When the studio fired him with a curt three-line letter, it seemed almost like putting him out of his misery. There was a happy ending with Keaton's remarriage and rediscovery, and there are generous clips from a revealing interview with Keaton later in life, but it's a tragedy along the way.All three features have good print quality (though The Cameraman is still missing a 'lost' sequence of a ship being launched) and it's definitely worth picking up for the first two films, but don't feel bad if you want to give up on the third: it's pretty obvious Buster did too.",5,Two last breaths of genius from Keaton before the studio beat him down,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,5611,"['Giving', 'up',
