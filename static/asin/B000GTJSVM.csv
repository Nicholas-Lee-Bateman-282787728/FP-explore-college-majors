1006927,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000GTJSVM,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[111, 112]","Ripped 1000 is instructor Jari Love's fourth DVD.  In this workout, she combines some of the best aspects of her three previous releases plus adds a new twist, cardio intervals.  Ripped 1000 follows the same basic principle as the original Get Ripped--ie, you will do a small series of exercises using a high number of repetitions and varied counts (4-4, 3-1, 2-2, etc.).  From her second workout, Slim & Lean, Jari includes pulsing reps, and she also includes compound moves similar to those found in her third workout, Ripped to the Core.  As I mentioned above, Ripped 1000 also adds cardio intervals using a step (but modifications are always shown without).  All of this, and you get Jari's simple, no-nonsense instruction style as well.The Main Menu on this DVD is as follows:  Introduction--Full Workout--Full Workout (Cardio Modifications)--Exercises--Bonus Features--Credits.  For the Full Workout with Cardio Modifications, an inset appears on screen showing an alternative option.  The Exercises segment is basically a chapter breakdown showing the 20 total chapters:  warm-up, 9 cardio segments, 9 strength segments (including abs), and cool-down.  Here as with all of the Ripped DVDs, Jari works out with four background exercisers, each of whom shows varying equipment, modificiations, and weight loads (the latter of which are helpfully shown on screen at the start of every exercise).As in her other workouts, Jari uses light weights for the warm-up and quickly moves through all of the major muscles of the body in the form of squats, side squats, dead lifts, bicep curls, and overhead presses.  She then sets the weights down to do some warming up on the step, and she finishes with some stretches for a total of about 5 minutes.  The workout itself alternates short cardio intervals (about 1.5 minutes each) with weight segments.  For the cardio segments, Jari performs a single move, starting off slow, moving to a quick tempo, then going back to slow and ending with a stretch (there's no choreography to learn).  Each weight segment ends with a stretch as well.  Here is a general breakdown of the workout:Warm-UpCardio 1 (stepovers with jacks)Side Squat with Lunge BackCardio 2 (pulsing squat to skiers)Stiff Leg Deadlift with Reverse LungeCardio 3 (front toe taps)Pulse Squat-Pulse LungesCardio 4 (up-up down-down)Push-Ups (70 declining reps--ie, 16-14-12-10-8-6-4)Cardio 5 (up-up down-down, other leg)Clean and PressCardio 6 (side taps to skier)Wide Leg Squat with Biceps CurlCardio 7 (down-jack up-jack)Triceps Extension with Leg Abduction (very unique balance move)Cardio 8 (football runs)Chest Press and Chest FlyeCardio 9 (football runs, other leg)Abs (lying to stand move with weight, straight leg hip raises, legs in and out, crunch with single leg squeeze, double leg lowers, brief bicycle)Stretch (floor, standing, step)The entire workout comes in at just under an hour.  I'm a high intermediate exerciser, and I was able to follow Jari's weight loads for most of the moves.  However, sometimes I had to modify the compound moves by doing the lower body only, and the only way I made it through the push-up sequence is by doing them on my knees and resting during the 6 reps.  For the most part, however, the workout felt quite doable (for some reason, I found this one a bit easier than Ripped to the Core), so I was surprised that after doing it the first time, I was sore for days after!  One last thing:  the name of this workout supposedly comes from the idea that you will burn 1000 calories while doing it.  That seems a little far-fetched to me, but according to my HR moniotr, I'm generally burning close to 500, which I think is still pretty darn good for a 1-hour workout.  Get Ripped 1000 is definitely an intermediate to advanced workout that will challenge most exercisers out there; highly recommended!",5,The most challenging Ripped workout yet!,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,3849,"['Ripped', '1000', 'instructor', 'Jari', 'Love', 'fourth', 'DVD', 'workout', 'best', 'aspects', 'three', 'previous', 'releases', 'new', 'twist', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'Ripped', '1000', 'same', 'basic', 'principle', 'original', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'ie', 'will', 'do', 'small', 'series', 'exercises', 'using', 'high', 'number', 'repetitions', 'varied', 'counts', '4-4', '3-1', '2-2', 'etc.', 'second', 'workout', 'Slim', 'Lean', 'Jari', 'pulsing', 'reps', 'also', 'compound', 'moves', 'similar', 'found', 'third', 'workout', 'Ripped', 'Core', 'mentioned', 'Ripped', '1000', 'also', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'using', 'step', 'modifications', 'are', 'always', 'shown', 'get', 'Jari', 'simple', 'no-nonsense', 'instruction', 'style', 'well.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'Introduction', 'Full', 'Workout', 'Full', 'Workout', 'Cardio', 'Modifications', 'Exercises', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Credits', 'Full', 'Workout', 'Cardio', 'Modifications', 'inset', 'screen', 'showing', 'alternative', 'option', 'Exercises', 'segment', 'basically', 'chapter', 'showing', '20', 'total', 'chapters', 'warm-up', '9', 'cardio', 'segments', '9', 'strength', 'segments', 'including', 'abs', 'cool-down', 'Here', 'Ripped', 'DVDs', 'Jari', 'out', 'four', 'background', 'exercisers', 'whom', 'shows', 'varying', 'equipment', 'modificiations', 'weight', 'loads', 'latter', 'are', 'helpfully', 'shown', 'screen', 'start', 'exercise', '.As', 'other', 'workouts', 'Jari', 'light', 'weights', 'warm-up', 'quickly', 'moves', 'major', 'muscles', 'body', 'form', 'squats', 'side', 'squats', 'dead', 'lifts', 'bicep', 'curls', 'overhead', 'presses', 'then', 'weights', 'down', 'do', 'warming', 'up', 'step', 'stretches', 'total', '5', 'minutes', 'workout', 'short', 'cardio', 'intervals', '1.5', 'minutes', 'weight', 'segments', 'cardio', 'segments', 'Jari', 'single', 'move', 'starting', 'off', 'slow', 'moving', 'quick', 'tempo', 'then', 'going', 'back', 'slow', 'ending', 'stretch', 'choreography', 'learn', 'weight', 'segment', 'stretch', 'as', 'well', 'Here', 'general', 'breakdown', 'workout', 'Warm-UpCardio', '1', 'stepovers', 'jacks', 'Side', 'Squat', 'Lunge', 'BackCardio', '2', 'pulsing', 'squat', 'skiers', 'Stiff', 'Leg', 'Deadlift', 'Reverse', 'LungeCardio', '3', 'front', 'toe', 'taps', 'Pulse', 'Squat-Pulse', 'LungesCardio', '4', 'up-up', 'down-down', 'Push-Ups', '70', 'declining', 'reps', 'ie', '16-14-12-10-8-6-4', '5', 'up-up', 'down-down', 'other', 'leg', 'Clean', 'PressCardio', '6', 'side', 'skier', 'Wide', 'Leg', 'Squat', 'Biceps', 'CurlCardio', '7', 'down-jack', 'up-jack', 'Extension', 'Leg', 'Abduction', 'very', 'unique', 'balance', 'move', 'Cardio', '8', 'football', 'Chest', 'Press', 'Chest', 'FlyeCardio', '9', 'football', 'runs', 'other', 'leg', 'Abs', 'lying', 'stand', 'move', 'weight', 'straight', 'leg', 'hip', 'legs', 'crunch', 'single', 'leg', 'squeeze', 'double', 'leg', 'lowers', 'brief', 'bicycle', 'Stretch', 'floor', 'standing', 'step', 'entire', 'workout', 'just', 'hour', ""'m"", 'high', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'Jari', 'weight', 'loads', 'most', 'moves', 'However', 'sometimes', 'had', 'modify', 'compound', 'moves', 'doing', 'lower', 'body', 'only', 'only', 'way', 'made', 'push-up', 'sequence', 'doing', 'knees', 'resting', '6', 'reps.', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'workout', 'felt', 'quite', 'doable', 'reason', 'found', 'one', 'bit', 'easier', 'Ripped', 'Core', 'so', 'was', 'surprised', 'doing', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'sore', 'days', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'name', 'workout', 'supposedly', 'idea', 'will', 'burn', '1000', 'calories', 'doing', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'according', 'HR', 'moniotr', ""'m"", 'generally', 'burning', 'close', '500', 'think', 'still', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', '1-hour', 'workout', 'Get', 'Ripped', '1000', 'definitely', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'workout', 'will', 'challenge', 'most', 'exercisers', 'out', 'there', 'highly', 'recommended']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped 1000

I was recently looking to expand my selection of more advanced DVD's and the name of this one says it all.  It is definitely one of the more challenging DVD's I have, but I will say, I still found it to be fairly easy at times.  I really liked that this DVD is not like the other Ripped ones I have as it incorporates cardio.  However, the cardio ""bursts"" are often short (30 seconds, I think) and then there's an even longer stretch time afterwards.  So, like another reviewer, I felt I was standing around more than necessary.  Additionally, the first time I did this DVD I found that I had to let each chapter start and then watch it for a minute to see what was going to come up- the cueing should have been better so I could avoid this additional standing around.Overall, I did really like this DVD from the challenge standpoint as the overall selection of challenging DVD's out there are not always at the professional level I see with Jari- she's really good, motivating and most importantly, NOT cheesy!

It's also fantastic and tough and effective and will have you burning fat and calories like crazy.It's a great interval workout using step and then weights.  You alternate tough repetition body sculpting moves with step for your cardio (it's not too dancy but very challenging).  This makes it more effective for fitness training and weight loss.

There is no choreography to speak of; it's just a focus on one move and you repeat that for the complete interval to really get your heart rate up.Don't think this is for the faint of heart.

I think the cardio isn't as intense as I would like, but I just modify and take it up a notch. Jari is a great instructor, and the weight portion is her real strength. She is not annoying, and gets straight to the point. I like to switch off between cardio and weights, so the weight portion even feels like more of a workout. I highly recommend this video. I still love 50/50 Cardio and Weights by Angie Gorr which is similar, but yet a little more up-beat, and the cardio section is just a little more intense. I also like Jackie Warner's new video, the time savor. Overall I think Jari has excellent videos, and her form is really good. So many videos out there have poor form, but Jari really makes it a point to tell you how to do the moves correctly. I am an advanced exerciser, so I know how to do the moves, but if you don't, she really instructs you well.

Note that I do not recommend Jari Love's DVDs for the beginning exerciser.  Even lowering the weights could be too challenging, and not using weights not challenging enough.  Further, they are very repetitive, which, could prove boring to the beginning exerciser. The sections are weight training alternated with cardio intervals.  The weight training is moderately difficult (not as challenging as Slim & Lean); but the cardio sections are very challenging.  If you are a beginning exercise, I encourage you to choose the full workout with cardio modifiers track on the main menu.  This gives you the 4th possible way to do the cardio workout; Jari goes back and forth from middle to difficult, then her assistants show easy (on the floor w/o the step), and middle to hard.  The cardio modifier depicts using the step but not at the same pace as the regular workout.  You will need 5, 8, 10, and 12 pound weights or a dumbbell, and a step.  If you only have the Firm fanny lifter, I do not recommend using it as it could be a hazard.  The cardio is extremely rapid, and involves fast paced footwork, while not complicated, requires concentration to avoid tripping.  Given the difficulty of this workout, there is a great sense of accomplishment afterwards.  Note:  Jari's DVDs are not known for their ab work.  One would think that since they kick your rear-end for the main part of the DVD, that the ab work would as well, but it is very easy work, and only 50 reps.",5,Phenomenal Workout,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1588,"['are', 'looking', 'challenging', 'workout', 'are', '11', 'segments', 'including', 'abs', 'stretch', 'warm', 'up', 'Note', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'Jari', 'Love', 'DVDs', 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'Even', 'lowering', 'weights', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'challenging', 'not', 'using', 'weights', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough', 'Further', 'are', 'very', 'repetitive', 'could', 'prove', 'boring', 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'sections', 'are', 'weight', 'training', 'alternated', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'weight', 'training', 'moderately', 'difficult', 'not', 'as', 'challenging', 'Slim', 'Lean', 'cardio', 'sections', 'are', 'very', 'challenging', 'are', 'beginning', 'exercise', 'encourage', 'choose', 'full', 'workout', 'cardio', 'modifiers', 'track', 'main', 'menu', '4th', 'possible', 'way', 'do', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Jari', 'back', 'forth', 'middle', 'difficult', 'then', 'assistants', 'show', 'easy', 'floor', 'w/o', 'step', 'middle', 'hard', 'cardio', 'modifier', 'depicts', 'using', 'step', 'not', 'same', 'pace', 'regular', 'workout', 'will', 'need', '5', '8', '10', '12', 'pound', 'weights', 'dumbbell', 'step', 'only', 'have', 'Firm', 'fanny', 'lifter', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'using', 'could', 'be', 'hazard', 'cardio', 'extremely', 'rapid', 'fast', 'paced', 'footwork', 'not', 'complicated', 'concentration', 'avoid', 'tripping', 'Given', 'difficulty', 'workout', 'great', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'afterwards', 'Note', 'Jari', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'ab', 'work', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'kick', 'rear-end', 'main', 'part', 'DVD', 'ab', 'work', 'would', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'easy', 'work', 'only', '50', 'reps']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped 1000

It almost seems more geared to bodybuilding than fitness/weightloss. It also uses step cardio, so if you enjoy that it may be worthwhile.However, I really hated doing this DVD. It was quite boring, and while the strength moves were effective, I didn't think the cardio really was. My heart rate was not ever very elevated, and the DVD is quite awkwardly structured so that there are long chapter breaks between sets. Basically, you're standing and staring at the screen a lot. I also just had a problem with Jari Love. I knew nothing of her before this, and as an instructor I felt she really lacked in terms of motivation.

As others have mentioned, it's a mix of COMPOUND (meaning you are working two or more muscle groups at onces, usually upper body and lower body)strength exercises and short bursts of cardio.  When I first realized that the cardio segments were only around a minute or two, I was like - whatever, that will be too easy.  Yeah right!  It may be short, but it's very challenging.  Thankfully, for me, because to say I'm uncoordinated and not dance-inclined is an understatment, the step moves are quite simple... nothing complicated you have to worry about figuring out how to follow along with.  The football drill (if you've done this yet, you know what I'm talking about) is my worst enemy.  It's so hard.  I'm always about ready to die before she finally says, ""let's cool it down.""  The strength moves are equally basic.  You can make them easier by going lighter with your weights.  I'm not going to lie - the heaviest dumbells I use are 8s.  Most exercises I use just 5s.  I am hoping to increase soon.  I'm a fairly scrawny person, but I've been a dilligent exerciser for years, so go figure.  The push-ups as others have commented are hard-core (70 reps!).  I can keep up on my knees, but when I'm done my armpit area is aching like crazy.Btw, just to give you a heads up, you might want to have your remote handy because the workout moves so fast, you may not have time to invert your step the right way, clear some space, and put your weights aside between the segments.  I usually have to pause it for a second to get set up for the next exercise.Oh, and be prepared for a drab backgroud.  I believe that's how all of Jari's video's are.  She is no fluff or nonsense and her background isn't either.  It's actually kind of strange - there's like a couch and coffee table in the backgroud.  What?  Are they all going to sit down and have tea and strumpets after the workout?Anyway, it's an awesome workout and you will burn a TON of calories doing it.  By doing Jari's video's I've been able to see real tone in my body for the first time.  It's nice.  Just make sure you have some kind of supplemental abs routine because for some reaon hers are never the best.

I will keep this short and simple. This is the first Jari Love DVD that I have purchased and I must admit that before this DVD was recommended to me by Amazon, I was not familiar with her. I opted to rent the DVD first before I came back to Amazon to buy it. The fact that I liked it well enough to spend money on it says a lot, especially in this economy. Basically, I have a number of DVDs with intense cardio and a few DVDs and books that detail strength training. What I was looking for was a DVD I could do a couple of times per week that included both cardio and weights. Hence I found Get Ripped 1000 and was impressed. Like any DVD, it isn't perfect. There are a few times where I think the cueing is a bit off and I can't see Jari's movements. There are also a few places where the background music becomes loud and distracting. Sometimes the shift between weights and cardio can feel disjointed. There is no progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which I personally tend to like in a DVD. I noticed that other reviewers complained that it felt boring to them. I didn't feel that way but perhaps a cautionary note could be that if you don't like aerobics and/or you don't like DVDs where the trainer moves slowly initially to show people the form of the moves, this would not be a good selection for you. But overall, I was happy with it and I do plan to invest in some of Jari's other workout DVDs.There seems to be some debate over whether a person could really burn 1000 calories with this workout. Typically, I am averaging between 800 and 1000. My caveat on that is: once I became familiarized with the moves, I do not stop or break in between sets. I try to jog in place to keep my heart rate up and the sweat flowing. It may not be helpful for everyone to do that but it works well for me. If you are looking for a DVD that will integrate both cardio and weights, I would highly recommend this one.",5,Impressed and looking forward to more,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,2039,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'detailing', 'how', 'DVD', 'structured', 'what', 'exercises', 'are', 'included', 'will', 'keep', 'short', 'simple', 'first', 'Jari', 'Love', 'DVD', 'have', 'purchased', 'must', 'admit', 'DVD', 'was', 'recommended', 'Amazon', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'opted', 'rent', 'DVD', 'first', 'came', 'back', 'Amazon', 'buy', 'fact', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'spend', 'money', 'lot', 'especially', 'economy', 'Basically', 'have', 'number', 'DVDs', 'intense', 'cardio', 'few', 'DVDs', 'books', 'detail', 'strength', 'training', 'What', 'was', 'looking', 'was', 'DVD', 'could', 'do', 'couple', 'times', 'week', 'included', 'cardio', 'weights', 'Hence', 'found', 'Get', 'Ripped', '1000', 'was', 'impressed', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'think', 'cueing', 'bit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Jari', 'movements', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'background', 'music', 'loud', 'distracting', 'Sometimes', 'shift', 'weights', 'cardio', 'can', 'feel', 'disjointed', 'progress', 'bar', 'bottom', 'screen', 'personally', 'tend', 'like', 'DVD', 'noticed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'felt', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'perhaps', 'cautionary', 'note', 'could', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'aerobics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVDs', 'where', 'trainer', 'slowly', 'initially', 'show', 'people', 'form', 'moves', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'selection', 'overall', 'was', 'happy', 'do', 'plan', 'invest', 'Jari', 'other', 'workout', 'DVDs.There', 'be', 'debate', 'person', 'could', 'really', 'burn', '1000', 'calories', 'workout', 'Typically', 'am', 'averaging', '800', '1000', 'caveat', 'once', 'became', 'familiarized', 'moves', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'break', 'sets', 'try', 'jog', 'place', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'sweat', 'flowing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'helpful', 'everyone', 'do', 'well', 'are', 'looking', 'DVD', 'will', 'integrate', 'cardio', 'weights', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped 1000

1006955,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B000GTJSVM,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[3, 3]","This is the first Jari Love DVD I have ever tried, and it worked me so hard I had sweat flinging all over the place by the time I was done.  It's a more advanced weight-lifting workout, with *very* short cardio intervals in-between the weight lifting sets that use an aerobic step.  I found the moves (especially the pulsing moves) quite challenging and effective.  Here's the good and the bad:The good:--Very challenging moves (my legs are like jello today because of those pulsing squats and lunges!)--Heart rate is kept up by the compound moves she does during the weight-lifting segments, and is kept up during the cardio segments--Good ab segment at the end that works all parts of the abs--Will leave you the ""good sore"" the next day--If you really push yourself and use a weight that leaves your muscles properly fatigued, I am sure this will get you huge results. (I always use lighter weights the first time I do a workout so I don't injure myself.)--I enjoyed the small stretch breaks she gives you at the end of each segment.--I was drenched in sweat by the end of this.The bad:--I wanted to quit about 30 minutes into it!  Not because it was too hard. . .but because I was rather bored.  The moves are repetitive.--Jari is obviously a good instructor, but she is lacking in personality somewhat to sufficiently motivate me to complete her workout.(I did complete it, but I really had to push myself.)--During the footwork in the cardio segments, I kept yelling at the TV for them to SHOW ME THEIR FEET.  During some moves, you couldn't see what they were doing with their feet!  And when you're jumping up and down on a step, you really want to make sure you're doing a fast-paced move correctly and safely.--I had some coordination issues with the cleans and presses. . more instruction on how to do these safely would have been nice.The good clearly outweights the bad here, but I thought it important to note the boredom that set in while I was working out.  I will do this workout again, but I am going to give her a fair chance and try one of her other workouts first (Ripped & Chiseled) to see if I can be convinced to buy any more of her DVDs.  All in all, I would recommend this to someone who really wants to get ripped and get a good cardio workout in at the same time (and who doesn't bore easily!).",4,"A good workout, but it's missing something. . .",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2322,"['first', 'Jari', 'Love', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'tried', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'had', 'sweat', 'flinging', 'place', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'advanced', 'weight-lifting', 'workout', '*very*', 'short', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'in-between', 'weight', 'lifting', 'sets', 'use', 'aerobic', 'step', 'found', 'moves', 'especially', 'pulsing', 'moves', 'quite', 'challenging', 'effective', 'Here', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'Very', 'challenging', 'moves', 'legs', 'are', 'jello', 'today', 'pulsing', 'squats', 'lunges', 'Heart', 'rate', 'kept', 'up', 'compound', 'weight-lifting', 'segments', 'kept', 'up', 'cardio', 'segments', 'Good', 'ab', 'segment', 'end', 'parts', 'abs', 'Will', 'leave', 'good', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'really', 'push', 'use', 'weight', 'muscles', 'properly', 'fatigued', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'get', 'huge', 'results', 'always', 'use', 'lighter', 'weights', 'first', 'time', 'do', 'workout', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'injure', 'enjoyed', 'small', 'stretch', 'breaks', 'end', 'segment.', 'was', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'end', 'this.The', 'bad', 'wanted', 'quit', '30', 'minutes', 'Not', 'was', 'too', 'hard', '.but', 'was', 'rather', 'bored', 'moves', 'are', 'repetitive.', 'Jari', 'obviously', 'good', 'instructor', 'lacking', 'personality', 'somewhat', 'sufficiently', 'motivate', 'complete', 'workout', 'did', 'complete', 'really', 'had', 'push', 'footwork', 'cardio', 'segments', 'kept', 'yelling', 'TV', 'SHOW', 'ME', 'THEIR', 'FEET', 'moves', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'feet', 'when', ""'re"", 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'step', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'doing', 'fast-paced', 'move', 'correctly', 'safely.', 'had', 'coordination', 'issues', 'cleans', 'presses', 'more', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'safely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.The', 'good', 'clearly', 'outweights', 'bad', 'here', 'thought', 'important', 'note', 'boredom', 'set', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'will', 'do', 'workout', 'again', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'try', 'one', 'other', 'workouts', 'first', 'Ripped', 'Chiseled', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'convinced', 'buy', 'more', 'DVDs', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'get', 'ripped', 'get', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'same', 'time', 'who', ""n't"", 'bore', 'easily']",Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped 1000
