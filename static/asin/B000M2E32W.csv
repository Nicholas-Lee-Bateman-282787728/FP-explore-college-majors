When the show debuted, it took heat from fans because it wasn't the same as the admittedly-great animated series of the 90's.  Now, even fans who've finally admitted The Batman is a good show are complaining that season 3 isn't on par with 1 and 2.Well, I for one am continuing to enjoy how the creators have redefined Batman & Co. once again.  Pairing Barbara Gordon and Pamela Isley--right before destiny changes both their lives in a single night--was just plain cool.  And while a handful of new villains can't really match the classic rogues' gallery, who wants to see the same villains over & over?

Long ""brent6980""","[0, 0]","(Continued from my reviews on The Batman - The Complete Season One, The Batman - The Complete Season Two & The Batman vs. Dracula)Things were going great in Seasons One and Two, and then, BAM! Season Three offers two major changes. First there is a new opening (and closing) theme. Initially, I didn't like it, not that it alone would affect my overall feelings toward the show. After it grew on me, it sounds like it is a modernized version of the 1966-1968 Batman live-action series (really wish that would see home release).The other major change is Batman, reluctantly at first, gets a partner in Batgirl. Robin wasn't available due to his appearance in another series, Teen Titans. Warner Bros./DC probably didn't want to saturate the market with his character. Because of that, The Batman interprets Batgirl as younger than her B:TAS appearance. The overall tone of this series wasn't nearly as dark as the ""Timmiverse"" to start with, but she has an occasional comic relief type comment.In a season opening two-parter, along with Batgirl, Poison Ivy is introduced and their stories are intertwined. Other stand-out episodes are one in which The Joker gets his own junior partner, and the season ender where Dr. Hugo Strange (a different actor here than Frank Gorshin (The Riddler on the 60s Batman series), who, before his death, had excellently portrayed Dr. Strange in three earlier episodes) programs a computer with profiles of various Arkham inmates/Batman enemies.Season Three, as a whole goes, a different direction than the previous two. The feeling I get is some amount of time has passed and The Batman is older and wiser. His detective skills seem to have grown and there is more reliance on this to complete the cases. The conflict of working with a partner adds a dynamic that has not been previously seen, as well. Pick this release up, and continue the capers of The Batman.",4,The Cliche: It's not The Animated Series (4/6),1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1895,"['Continued', 'reviews', 'Batman', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One', 'Batman', 'Complete', 'Season', 'Two', 'Batman', 'vs.', 'Dracula', 'Things', 'were', 'going', 'great', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'then', 'BAM', 'Season', 'Three', 'offers', 'two', 'major', 'changes', 'First', 'new', 'opening', 'closing', 'theme', 'Initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'alone', 'would', 'affect', 'overall', 'feelings', 'show', 'grew', 'modernized', 'version', '1966-1968', 'Batman', 'live-action', 'series', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'see', 'home', 'release', 'other', 'major', 'change', 'Batman', 'reluctantly', 'first', 'partner', 'Batgirl', 'Robin', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'due', 'appearance', 'series', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'Warner', 'Bros./DC', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'saturate', 'market', 'character', 'Batman', 'Batgirl', 'younger', 'B', 'TAS', 'appearance', 'overall', 'tone', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'dark', 'Timmiverse', 'start', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'type', 'comment.In', 'season', 'opening', 'two-parter', 'Batgirl', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'introduced', 'stories', 'are', 'intertwined', 'Other', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'are', 'one', 'Joker', 'own', 'junior', 'partner', 'season', 'ender', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Hugo', 'Strange', 'different', 'actor', 'here', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'Riddler', '60s', 'Batman', 'series', 'who', 'death', 'had', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'three', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'programs', 'computer', 'profiles', 'various', 'Arkham', 'inmates/Batman', 'enemies.Season', 'Three', 'whole', 'different', 'direction', 'previous', 'two', 'feeling', 'get', 'amount', 'time', 'passed', 'Batman', 'older', 'wiser', 'detective', 'skills', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'more', 'reliance', 'complete', 'cases', 'conflict', 'working', 'partner', 'dynamic', 'not', 'been', 'previously', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'Pick', 'release', 'up', 'continue', 'capers', 'Batman']",N/A

I've never been a big fan of batman having a sidekick, but I did like the fact that they were bringing in Batgirl before Robin. That is something that's never been done before. The good stories are still there but the impact isn't. There are some very great episodes in this season too, probably better than any on the second, but there are also some that are just downright bad. Batgirl really did bring the show downhill, to me that is. Her dialogue is horrible, I know she is a kid, but it's almost like they keep trying to remind you with making her talk constantly. I will admit, about halfway through (The Laughing Cats), she did start to grow on me a little. She was starting to feel like she belonged. I guess the series just couldn't think of a better way to bring her in.I am also very very very tired of (I hate to say this) the Joker. His crimes in this season were horrible. I'm a huge Joker fan and loved the episodes he was in last season, but this time it seemed like they were just using him because he is the joker. The episode ""Brawn"" just seemed like it could have been a lot better if they would have just used Bane. We do need more of Bane, and I hope to see him later in the series. I was glad to see that they cut down on Penguin a little. Didn't like the first episode with him (A Knight to Remember) but I did like The Icy Depths a lot.I also liked the build up to Hugo Strange, and was very happy to finally see his character come out. I also did like the idea of someone going after Bruce Wayne.My Top 5 episodes were1. Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind- D.A.V.E was a great idea for a villain and to put Hugo behind it was even a better one2. A Fistful of Felt- A classic Ventriloquist story, with Strange pulling the strings.3. Thunder- The one episode that I did not mind Batgirl at all. Everything about this one just seemed right.4. RPM- A good story to introduce a new batmobile5. The Icy Depths- Even though I do not like this version of Freeze that much, he is in some pretty good episodes.So maybe after I watch this again, I might start to appreciate it more but at the time being this is how I feel about this season. Also please remember, these are my opinions and you may feel different.

1042019,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000M2E32W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 13]","In his 5th year of crimefighting, Gotham's grim loner at last gets a superhero sidekick. And it's not Robin. There's a definite infusion of girl power as Season 3's first two episodes unveil the origin of the plucky but extremely raw Batgirl. The rest of the season lays out her journey from undesired, unproven nuisance to Batman's well-regarded, in-the-loop sidekick. With the departure of Detective Ellen Yin, Batman's former hush hush ally in the Gotham constabulary, we get to see more of Batgirl's dad, Commissioner James Gordon, who, in Season 2, made his debut and reached an accomodation with the Dark Knight. Here, we see the Batwing, as well as the new, fairly awesome Batmobile. We say goodbye to the eerie theme song of the first two seasons and hello to the more upbeat and guitar-strummy new theme music, although I do lament the loss of the fun and freaky ""Baaatmaaan"" which can be heard at the end of the original theme.Producer/Art Director Jeff Matsuda's distinct style again shines clear and strong. Quite a bit of the animation reminds me of his old Jackie Chan cartoon, which threw me off for a moment. Then I got used to it and I like it now. Another positive for the series is the humor. There's always been some comedy to this series, but, thanks to the quippy and infectious Batgirl, there's an even more pronounced lighthearted tone, which, by the way, serves as a nice counterpoint to Batman's brooding.This season wouldn't be complete without Batman's roster of oddball villainy (Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, etc.). Poison Ivy is re-imagined here as a contemporary of Batgirl's. The nanotech-manipulating Gearhead debuts and wreaks havoc with Bats and his wheels, while Maximillian Zeus still has his god complex intact. However, it's the final episode which presents Batman with his deadliest adversary as embodied in the creation of the unctuous Professor Hugo Strange. And, for fans of the live action '60s Batman series, Adam West has been a recurring guest actor as the voice of the Gotham mayor. My favorite episodes here are ""Batgirl Begins, Parts 1 & 2,"" ""RPM"" (that Gearhead is a lot of fun), ""Thunder"" (Batgirl is growing more and more disenchanted with Batman keeping her out of the loop, and Zeus looks darn impressive), and ""Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind"" (a worthy duo of villains).Yup, it's a bit disconcerting having Batgirl come in before Robin, as it does change up the team dynamics, and especially when Robin finally does appear in Season 4. But guess what? For me, Season 3 became the turning point of the series, when I began to regularly try to catch it on TV. The biggest reason is Batgirl. I truly enjoy this series's take on Barbara Gordon and her alter ego. She's brave but insecure, athletic but klutzy, resourceful but with an aptitude for occasionally bollocksing it up. But she doesn't waver, whether in a tussle or in trying to convince Batman to accept her as a crime-fighting partner. And she's funny and has no qualms about ribbing the mega-serious Caped Crusader. Safe to say Batgirl won me over pretty quickly. Which is a good thing, as she's in a ton of episodes. As for the Batman, well, the dude remains a dark and righteous superhero. Wouldn't have him any other way.Season 3's 13 episodes are:Episodes 1 & 2 - ""Batgirl Begins (Parts 1 & 2) - Barbara Gordon, teen Olympic hopeful and the police commish's willful daughter, dons the cowl and cape of Batgirl for the first time. Meanwhile, Barbara's buddy, Pamela Isley, becomes the demented Poison Ivy. That friendship's probably over.Episode 3 - ""A Dark Knight to Remember"" - Bruce Wayne suffers a head trauma after a run-in with the Penguin and loses all memory of being the Darknight Detective. This sucks for the kidnapped Batgirl as she's about to be put to death by the Penguin at the stroke of midnight.Episode 4 - ""A Fistful of Felt"" - Heaps of bent psychology here. Professor Hugo Strange pronounces the Ventriloquist cured and releases him from Arkham. The Ventriloquist gets a new gig performing at kids' birthday parties. But what happens when his old, malevolent puppet Scarface reappears?Episode 5 - ""RPM"" - Nanotech-powered racer Gearhead comes to Gotham to seek thrills and loot cash, and Bruce builds an all-new and improved Batmobile. Meanwhile, Barbara goes to driving school.Episode 6 - ""Brawn"" - The Joker has made off with Bane's power infusion module and is now all muscly and super-strong. Is Batman still in his weight class?Episode 7 - ""The Laughing Cats"" - Joker absconds with a pair of endangered Siberian leopards, intending to sell them to a hunter of very rare beasts. Catwoman, she doesn't approve.Episode 8 - ""Fleurs Du Mal"" - Even as the mayor initiates an environmental ""Green Up Gotham"" program, the Penguin schemes to make it rain, Alfred gets hay fever, and Batman is arrested for killing a plant. Can you guess the villain?Episode 9 - ""Cash for Toys"" - After Wayne Industries shuts down the dangerous toy-making company Krank Co., its owner Cosmo Krank seeks out vengeance with his arsenal of lethal playthings. This is a fairly amusing episode if you're a fan of Patrick Warburton, who voices the brash Cash Tankenson as he provides police protection and ""wingman"" duties for Bruce.Episode 10 - ""The Apprentice"" - After Bats and Batgirl foil another one of his schemes, Joker decides to get his own sidekick (""I want my own Mini Me.""). So he starts hanging out at the comedy club Ha-Ha-Hacienda and discovers Prank.Episode 11 - ""Thunder"" - The corrupt but semi-majestic billionaire Maximillian Zeus, after having lost the mayoral election, makes up his mind to rule Gotham anyway. And, he's got a flying warship to back up his ambition.Episode 12 - ""The Icy Depths"" - Mr. Freeze and the Penguin vie for a jewel-encrusted umbrella, which hides a clue to sunken treasure. Meanwhile, a sneaky, old chum of Alfred's comes a-calling.Episode 13 - ""Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind"" - The ever-oily Professor Hugo Strange demonstrates his Digitally Advanced Villain Emulator (or D.A.V.E.), the most up-to-date criminal-capture technology and powered by artificial intelligence. But you just know D.A.V.E.'s gonna rebel...To save the day, Bats just may have to pull out a ploy from Captain Kirk's bag of tricks.Note: Disc 1 provides the first seven episodes, Disc 2 has the final six. For a special feature, there's only the 8-minute-long ""The Batman: Season 3 Unmasked"" featurette.Three and a half stars for this one? Yeah, why not. And, for those who enjoy Season 3, Season 4 is even better. However, I'm still not that fond of the first two seasons.",4,"""Aw, dude!

1042023,AK0LMDPBH1H8Q,B000M2E32W,Jon Repesh,"[0, 0]","My first exposure to The Batman started with season five, followed shortly thereafter by four. Continuing on in that trend of inverse viewing of seasons we now arrive at volume three. Each season does have its own identity and can be assessed and appreciated independently, but comparisons to others is unavoidable, if not somewhat effectual and enlightening. The most noticeable difference here is the absence of Robin and the introduction and importance of Batgirl. As portrayed here she is younger than most other incarnations, which certainly suits the youth oriented approach of the series. Barbara's innocence, combined with normal adolescent angst and arrogance, make her appear like a typical teenager, unless of course Commissioner Gordon is your father, Batman operates in your city, and your best friend is turned into a rogue, with the three circumstances combined inspiring her to become Batgirl. Her wry wit adds a touch of levity to the series without unduly degenerating it into unwanted silliness. Some may find her presence excessive, which is difficult to argue against, but her prominence does not markedly detract from the show's appeal. If anything the overuse of the Joker and especially Penguin is more problematic. The overall consistency and quality of the episodes is arguably not as strong as four and five, but as with each season particular ones shine, with the opening two part Batgirl/Poison Ivy introduction being at the top of the list. The stellar animation remains as strong and eye opening as ever, playing a major role in offsetting some of the series flaws and making several of the weaker episodes worth watching for it alone.

The drawing is wretched and terrible, the music is irritating. There are a few of the 13 episodes worth noting:Batgirl Begins--2 parts.

Alfred has to retrain Bruce to be Batman.Brawn. The Joker steals Bane's venom delivery system. Batgirl steals the Bat robot suit and defeats the Joker. She saves Batman from peril.The Laughing Cats. One of the few with Catwoman. Revisionist remake of The Most Dangerous Game. Batman, Batgirl, and Catwoman end up stuck in a labyrinth on an island. Batgirl teams up with Catwoman for awhile. A good episode.Thunder. The best episode. Sore at losing the mayoral election, Zeus destroys the city hall with his flying New Olympus airship. Batman tries to get aboard while Zeus is firing at the city. Batgirl gets aboard before he does. Batman comes back with the Batwing, and while Batgirl is hidden, sabotaging the electrics of the airship, Batman battles Zeus. The airship is wrecked and is going down, but Batgirl pilots it manually and safely to the harbor.The Icy Depths. Has Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, Alfred, and an old friend of Alfred's, Ewan, looking for treasure. Involves a cave, a lighthouse, a sunken ship, and much else. Notable as one of the few where Alfred has a big part.Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind. Professor Hugo Strange develops DAVE, a computer program that takes over Gotham, builds himself a robot body and is designed specifically to outwit Batman. DAVE is eventually shut down by Batman using psychology, and Dr. Strange ends up as an Arkham inmate.I have to say I really hate how the producers of this series designed The Joker. Horrible. And he is used far, far, far too much in the various five seasons of the series. Batgirl is too young here and often comes off as wise-ass jerk, instead of a hero.

While my favorite series will always be BTAS, I have bought all the discs form this series as well. For season 3 they rolled out a new young sidekick to add some humor and someone for Batman to talk to, which helps move the story as a writer. And the new sidekick that Batman shoes in his early years? No, not Robin, but Batgirl. Robin is a no-show until the next season. She is a good sidekick though and it all works out, maybe it helped to get some girls to watch the show, it worked with my wife.

1042034,A2BC6YTTOZ98KB,B000M2E32W,MISSterio,"[4, 8]","Short Summary: In the third season of The Batman, the caped crusader has his hands full when he has to deal with new villainess Poison Ivy. Unfortunately, his fighting crime doesn't get any easier when amateur Batgirl comes into play. With crazies such as Joker, Penguin, and new villain GearHead tormenting all of Gotham, can Batman save the city AND keep his new 'sidekick' from getting into trouble?Overview Of Third Season: The third season is much like the other two seasons, for the exception that Detectives Ellen Yin and Ethan Bennett (aka Clayface) are replaced by Batgirl, who becomes Batman's new sidekick. As for what's on both 2-discs...not much. For special features, it's just this 'commentary' of sorts, with the creators talking about the making of the third season...in a way (The Batman: Season 3 Unmasked).My Opinion: To be honest, I really loved the first and second seasons of Batman. Even though the stories could use a makeover from the Batman: The Animated Series creators, but THE BATMAN still has its good moments. When I saw the third season, I was actually disappointed how the creators had done things.The one thing that bugged me most is Batgirl's role in the show now. Even in the comics, it was Robin who is the first to be Batman's sidekick, and not Batgirl. Besides the fact, she's too young and annoys you most of the time you're watching the show. I counted, and out of 13 episodes, there's only 4 without Batgirl, and the ones without her are actually pretty good.My Opinion Of Good Episodes: As I said before, the stories/plots in this season aren't as good as the last two seasons, but still, there are SOME episodes worth watching (my opinion, of course). Out of 13 episodes, here is the list of episodes:1. ""A Fistful of Felt"" (After short time in Arkham, Doctor Hugo Strange claims that ventriloquist Arnold Wesker is a free mind from Scarface...but Batman thinks otherwise.)2. ""Brawn"" (Joker has stolen Bane's 'muscle venom', and is now using it on himself! With the Batbot out of reach, how is Batman gonna stop a villain who is much bigger than Bane ever was?)3. ""Cash for Toys"" (Enraged that his company was shut down, insane toy maker Krank now goes after the man that put him out of business: Bruce Wayne.)4. ""The Apprentice"" (Joker decides to get a sidekick of his own when jealousy of Batgirl comes to him.) --just to let you know, Harley Quinn is not Joker's new sidekick in here.5. ""Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind"" (A very cruel and cunning robot named D.A.V.E wants Batman to suffer from his horrible schemes, but the question is: does D.A.V.E even know he's a robot?)Overall: To be honest, I thought there were more episodes that I enjoyed...I guess not. Who knows, maybe other people -- such as yourself -- might find to be more enjoyable stories than the ones I listed above. Unless you're a fan to The Batman cartoons, than you would definitely want this in your collection. If you're not a great fan...I would think it over. As I said, the first two seasons were pretty good, but I think the whole show takes a downfall from the third season and beyond that...As for the reviewers who said they had problems with their discs: I do believe them that they had problems playing the first disc of the third season, but I just bought the season today, and I didn't have any problems at all. Just to give caution to those who do wish to purchase the third season: check both discs and make sure they play okay, and if they don't work, I hope you'll be able to return the DVD without any complications...",4,Here Comes Batgirl...,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3563,"['Short', 'Summary', 'third', 'season', 'Batman', 'caped', 'crusader', 'hands', 'full', 'when', 'deal', 'new', 'villainess', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Unfortunately', 'fighting', 'crime', ""n't"", 'get', 'easier', 'when', 'amateur', 'Batgirl', 'play', 'crazies', 'such', 'Joker', 'Penguin', 'new', 'villain', 'GearHead', 'tormenting', 'Gotham', 'can', 'Batman', 'save', 'city', 'keep', 'new', ""'sidekick"", 'getting', 'trouble', 'Overview', 'Third', 'Season', 'third', 'season', 'much', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'exception', 'Ellen', 'Yin', 'Ethan', 'Bennett', 'aka', 'Clayface', 'are', 'replaced', 'Batgirl', 'who', 'Batman', 'new', 'sidekick', 'what', '2-discs', 'not', 'much', 'special', 'features', 'just', ""'commentary"", ""'"", 'sorts', 'creators', 'talking', 'making', 'third', 'season', 'way', 'Batman', 'Season', '3', 'Unmasked', 'Opinion', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'Batman', 'Even', 'stories', 'could', 'use', 'makeover', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'creators', 'THE', 'BATMAN', 'still', 'good', 'moments', 'When', 'saw', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'actually', 'disappointed', 'how', 'creators', 'had', 'done', 'things.The', 'one', 'thing', 'bugged', 'most', 'Batgirl', 'role', 'show', 'now', 'Even', 'comics', 'was', 'Robin', 'who', 'first', 'be', 'Batman', 'sidekick', 'not', 'Batgirl', 'fact', 'too', 'young', 'most', 'time', ""'re"", 'watching', 'show', 'counted', '13', 'episodes', 'only', '4', 'Batgirl', 'ones', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good.My', 'Opinion', 'Good', 'Episodes', 'said', 'stories/plots', 'season', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'still', 'are', 'SOME', 'episodes', 'worth', 'watching', 'opinion', 'course', '13', 'episodes', 'here', 'list', 'episodes:1', 'Fistful', 'Felt', 'short', 'time', 'Arkham', 'Doctor', 'Hugo', 'Strange', 'ventriloquist', 'Arnold', 'Wesker', 'free', 'mind', 'Scarface', 'Batman', 'otherwise.', '2', 'Brawn', 'Joker', 'stolen', 'Bane', ""'muscle"", 'venom', 'now', 'using', 'Batbot', 'reach', 'how', 'Batman', 'gon', 'stop', 'villain', 'who', 'much', 'bigger', 'Bane', 'ever', 'was', '3', 'Cash', 'Toys', 'Enraged', 'company', 'was', 'shut', 'down', 'insane', 'toy', 'maker', 'Krank', 'now', 'man', 'put', 'business', 'Bruce', 'Wayne.', '4', 'Apprentice', 'Joker', 'get', 'sidekick', 'own', 'when', 'jealousy', 'Batgirl', 'just', 'let', 'know', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'not', 'Joker', 'new', 'sidekick', 'here.5', 'Gotham', 'Ultimate', 'Criminal', 'Mastermind', 'very', 'cruel', 'cunning', 'robot', 'named', 'D.A.V.E', 'Batman', 'suffer', 'horrible', 'schemes', 'question', 'D.A.V.E', 'even', 'know', 'robot', 'Overall', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'guess', 'not', 'Who', 'maybe', 'other', 'people', 'such', 'might', 'find', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'stories', 'ones', 'listed', 'above', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Batman', 'cartoons', 'would', 'definitely', 'want', 'collection', ""'re"", 'not', 'great', 'fan', 'would', 'think', 'over', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'whole', 'show', 'downfall', 'third', 'season', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'problems', 'discs', 'do', 'believe', 'had', 'problems', 'playing', 'first', 'disc', 'third', 'season', 'just', 'bought', 'season', 'today', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'Just', 'give', 'caution', 'who', 'do', 'wish', 'purchase', 'third', 'season', 'check', 'discs', 'make', 'sure', 'play', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'return', 'DVD', 'complications']",N/A
1042035,AHF97M45JFCB,B000M2E32W,ONENEO,"[17, 22]","Well, last night I finally completed my tour of The Batman by finishing Season 3 (directly after having finished 2 and 1).  As others have stated, Season 3 pales in comparison to Season 2 but not for reasons expected.  The writing actually matures a little bit over the past two volumes.  We are treated to a more in depth look at the relationship between Bruce and Alfred as well as Batman and Catwoman's love/hate thing.  Unfortunately that is where the pluses end- The first flaw is a total overuse of Joker.  With a rogue gallery as deep as Batman's, there is really no excuse for reusing an enemy over and over like this.  Granted, he has his humorous moments, the fact is Joker brings too much chaos and unpredictability to the formula for me.  He is interesting in small dosage but The Batman starts to feel like a broken record with how many times the Joker's ridiculous schemes get squashed.Next up is the made-up villains.  Prepare to witness a fair share of either made up rogues or very generic ones brought into the light in Season 3: Krank, Prank, and Gearhead all make appearances before staples such as Ras, Two Face, and Scarecrow.However, none of these problems compare to the glaring annoyance of Batgirl.  As others have said in their reviews, season 3 introduces Batgirl as a self-appointed sidekick (oddly enough, before Robin).  While the voice work is nice and the setup with Barb Gordon's ties to Poison Ivy are interesting enough, it doesn't take long to develop a deep hatred for the whole Batgirl character.  This happens mainly because suddenly the show's writers switch into a mode where Batman finds himself in sticky situations where only a sidekick can save the day.  What's worse is that Batgirl is given far too much credit (she even has her own getting-dressed into costume animation sequence) only to end up requiring Batman to save her from certain doom.  Also as a result, all traces of both detective Yen and Chief Rohas are vanquished for Barbara and her commissioner father.  Gordon is very well done but believe me when I say that Batgirl will be pushed down the viewer's throat almost continuously throughout this entire season.The tragedy is that the few episodes of this season that are on track (and don't throw Batgirl at us) are fairly brilliant, maybe even better then the best offerings of season 2 (such as Fistful of Felt and The Icy Depths).  Unfortunately these are the minority to endless Joker nonsense and Batgirl saving/ ruining the day.",3,A step in the wrong direction,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2496,"['Well', 'last', 'night', 'finally', 'completed', 'tour', 'Batman', 'finishing', 'Season', '3', 'directly', 'having', 'finished', '2', '1', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'Season', '3', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'reasons', 'expected', 'writing', 'actually', 'little', 'bit', 'past', 'two', 'volumes', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'depth', 'look', 'relationship', 'Bruce', 'Alfred', 'as', 'well', 'Batman', 'Catwoman', 'love/hate', 'thing', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'pluses', 'end-', 'first', 'flaw', 'total', 'overuse', 'Joker', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'as', 'deep', 'Batman', 'really', 'excuse', 'reusing', 'enemy', 'Granted', 'humorous', 'moments', 'fact', 'Joker', 'too', 'much', 'chaos', 'unpredictability', 'formula', 'interesting', 'small', 'dosage', 'Batman', 'feel', 'broken', 'record', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Joker', 'ridiculous', 'schemes', 'get', 'squashed.Next', 'up', 'made-up', 'villains', 'Prepare', 'witness', 'fair', 'share', 'made', 'up', 'rogues', 'very', 'generic', 'ones', 'brought', 'light', 'Season', '3', 'Krank', 'Prank', 'Gearhead', 'make', 'appearances', 'staples', 'such', 'Ras', 'Two', 'Face', 'Scarecrow.However', 'none', 'problems', 'compare', 'glaring', 'annoyance', 'Batgirl', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'reviews', 'season', '3', 'introduces', 'Batgirl', 'self-appointed', 'sidekick', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Robin', 'voice', 'work', 'nice', 'setup', 'Barb', 'Gordon', 'ties', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'develop', 'deep', 'hatred', 'whole', 'Batgirl', 'character', 'mainly', 'suddenly', 'show', 'writers', 'switch', 'mode', 'where', 'Batman', 'sticky', 'situations', 'where', 'only', 'sidekick', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'What', 'worse', 'Batgirl', 'given', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'even', 'own', 'getting-dressed', 'costume', 'animation', 'sequence', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'requiring', 'Batman', 'save', 'certain', 'doom', 'Also', 'result', 'traces', 'detective', 'Yen', 'Chief', 'Rohas', 'are', 'vanquished', 'Barbara', 'commissioner', 'father', 'Gordon', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'Batgirl', 'will', 'be', 'pushed', 'down', 'viewer', 'throat', 'almost', 'continuously', 'entire', 'season.The', 'tragedy', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'throw', 'Batgirl', 'are', 'fairly', 'brilliant', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'then', 'best', 'offerings', 'season', '2', 'such', 'Fistful', 'Felt', 'Icy', 'Depths', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'minority', 'endless', 'Joker', 'nonsense', 'Batgirl', 'saving/', 'ruining', 'day']",N/A

1042039,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000M2E32W,trebe,"[0, 0]","The biggest development in the third season of Warner Brothers' The Batman (2005) is the coming of Batgirl.  In keeping with a younger Bruce Wayne, in this incarnation, The Batgirl is truly a girl, as a teenage high schooler Barbara Gordon makes her first appearance in the season opening two parter 'Batgirl Begins', that also introduces Barbara's friend Pamela Isley, as Poison Ivy.Voiced by Danielle Judovis, Batgirl would like to become Batman's sidekick, and spends most of the season tagging along on his cases, trying to win his trust.  She's a mixture of youthful exuberance, abundant self-confidence, and naivet&eacute;, and her presence introduces a whole new dynamic to the series.In Season One, utilizing high tech means to fight crime Batman, was regarded by the police as a vigilante.  In Season Two, working in association with Detective Ellen Yin, Batman eventually gains the trust of Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (voiced by Mitch Pileggi).  In Season Three, Batman is not regarded by the police as a threat, and both Ellen Yin and Chief Angel Rojas are gone.  Socialite Bruce Wayne, does not do much socializing, and there is not even the hint of romance in his life.  There is not much happening on the business side either, as Wayne Industries and the Wayne Foundation do not seem to play significant roles.  While Bruce's personal life may not be as active, Alfred remains the rock that he can depend on.While the action remains for the most part, still fast and furious, there seems to be less of an edge, as Batgirl is learning the ropes, making mistakes, and taking her lumps on the way.  The villains usually make Batgirl the brunt of jokes, but she takes it in stride.  Batgirl knows she needs guidance, but feels like an outcast, because Batman does not keep her 'in the loop'.  The fact that Batman is aware that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl, plays into how he regards Batgirl, and he certainly does not actively embrace the role of mentor.  However she's spunky and enthusiastic, and her persistence and dedication do eventually pay off, as Batgirl gets a kit with her own utility belt, Batarang, and Bat-communicator.Among the villains, The Penguin continues to impress, making use of cutting edge technology, and displaying some pretty wicked fighting skills as well.  The Joker appears in three episodes, and the version of the clown prince of crime in this series, continues to be something of an acquired taste.  The episode 'Brawn', features a ridiculous looking chemically enhanced Joker, and there is more silliness later in 'The Apprentice', when Joker seeks his own teenage sidekick.  'The Icy Depths' is a dual villain affair, featuring The Penguin and Mr. Freeze, both after a hidden treasure.  It is an outrageous fantasy ride, but it is still quite compelling.The series which began as a bold strike in a new direction, takes a turn away from the darker elements pursued in Season Two, with the introduction of Batgirl.  Although targeted at a younger audience, the series is still not suitable for young children.  The quality of the animation remains very good, and the action is as frenetic as ever, although the quality of the stories is a little spotty.  If you are not a fan of Batgirl, and a juvenile one at that, you may find Season Three a little bit of a grind, as her presence and influence are quite prevalent.",3,Batgirl's arrival reshapes The Batman's world . . .,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,3363,"['biggest', 'development', 'third', 'season', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Batman', '2005', 'coming', 'Batgirl', 'keeping', 'younger', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'incarnation', 'Batgirl', 'truly', 'girl', 'teenage', 'high', 'schooler', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'first', 'appearance', 'season', 'opening', 'two', 'parter', 'Begins', 'also', 'Barbara', 'friend', 'Pamela', 'Isley', 'Poison', 'Ivy.Voiced', 'Danielle', 'Judovis', 'Batgirl', 'would', 'like', 'become', 'Batman', 'sidekick', 'most', 'season', 'tagging', 'along', 'cases', 'trying', 'win', 'trust', 'mixture', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'abundant', 'self-confidence', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'presence', 'whole', 'new', 'dynamic', 'series.In', 'Season', 'One', 'utilizing', 'high', 'tech', 'fight', 'crime', 'Batman', 'was', 'regarded', 'police', 'vigilante', 'Season', 'Two', 'working', 'association', 'Detective', 'Ellen', 'Yin', 'Batman', 'eventually', 'gains', 'trust', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'voiced', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'Season', 'Three', 'Batman', 'not', 'regarded', 'police', 'threat', 'Ellen', 'Yin', 'Chief', 'Angel', 'Rojas', 'are', 'gone', 'Socialite', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'socializing', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'romance', 'life', 'not', 'much', 'happening', 'business', 'side', 'either', 'Wayne', 'Industries', 'Wayne', 'Foundation', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'Bruce', 'personal', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'active', 'Alfred', 'rock', 'can', 'depend', 'action', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'fast', 'furious', 'be', 'less', 'edge', 'Batgirl', 'learning', 'ropes', 'making', 'mistakes', 'taking', 'lumps', 'way', 'villains', 'usually', 'make', 'Batgirl', 'brunt', 'jokes', 'stride', 'Batgirl', 'guidance', 'feels', 'outcast', 'Batman', 'not', 'keep', 'loop', 'fact', 'Batman', 'aware', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'Batgirl', 'how', 'Batgirl', 'certainly', 'not', 'actively', 'embrace', 'role', 'mentor', 'However', 'spunky', 'enthusiastic', 'persistence', 'dedication', 'do', 'eventually', 'pay', 'off', 'Batgirl', 'kit', 'own', 'utility', 'belt', 'Batarang', 'Bat-communicator.Among', 'villains', 'Penguin', 'impress', 'making', 'use', 'cutting', 'edge', 'technology', 'displaying', 'pretty', 'wicked', 'fighting', 'skills', 'as', 'well', 'Joker', 'three', 'episodes', 'version', 'clown', 'prince', 'crime', 'series', 'be', 'something', 'acquired', 'taste', 'episode', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'chemically', 'enhanced', 'Joker', 'more', 'silliness', 'later', ""'The"", 'Apprentice', 'when', 'Joker', 'own', 'teenage', 'sidekick', 'Icy', 'Depths', 'dual', 'villain', 'affair', 'featuring', 'Penguin', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'outrageous', 'fantasy', 'ride', 'still', 'quite', 'compelling.The', 'series', 'began', 'bold', 'strike', 'new', 'direction', 'turn', 'away', 'darker', 'elements', 'pursued', 'Season', 'Two', 'introduction', 'Batgirl', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'series', 'still', 'not', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'quality', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'as', 'frenetic', 'ever', 'quality', 'stories', 'little', 'spotty', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Batgirl', 'juvenile', 'one', 'may', 'find', 'Season', 'Three', 'little', 'bit', 'grind', 'presence', 'influence', 'are', 'quite', 'prevalent']",N/A
