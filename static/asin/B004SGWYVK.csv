1427289,AT1EGRXDI3NUK,B004SGWYVK,Amazon Customer,"[26, 27]","It's hard to summarize everything great about Dallas in a small review.  Of course it was a massive hit back in the day and it is now scheduled for a revival, which is incredible in and of itself.  This though is the original and is truly a masterwork.  Created by David Jacobs, it is best described as Romeo and Juliet meets Cain and Abel in Texas, with some of the Godfather thrown in.  You have two feuding families, Barnes and Ewing, and a slew of other characters and events really too numerous to mention over the course of the series.  The two families are both involved in the Oil and Cattle Business in Texas, and use a bevy of schemes, betrayals, relationships, character flaws, and money to wage war.  At the beginning of the story, the Ewings are the rich family, owners of Southfork Ranch and Ewing Oil, while the poor working class Barnes'es represent the other side.  From there, and over the course of 14 seasons, the groundwork is laid for the action to fall and character fates to play out in amazing and surprising ways.At the center of it all is JR Ewing-Larry Hagman broke ground as a TV star by playing a bad man, or at least a very flawed one with some good qualities as well, who was extremely likable.  Add to that a memorable supporting cast and you have part of what made the show so great.  It was so huge I would be hard-pressed to make a definitive list right here, as I have tried to on my individual season reviews, but there are original stars Patrick Duffy as good brother Bobby, Ken Kercheval as Ewing nemesis Cliff Barnes, Barbara Bel Geddes as Matriarch Miss Ellie, Jim Davis as patriarch Jock, Victoria Principal as Pam Barnes Ewing, Linda Gray as Sue Ellen Ewing, and Steve Kanaly as Ray Krebbs, as well as later additions like Susan Howard as Donna Culver, Audrey Landers as Afton Cooper, Howard Keel as Clayton Farlow, Priscilla Presley as Jenna Wade, Sheree J Wilson as April Stevens, and George Kennedy as Carter McKay among far too many others to list.Add to it the fact that it told a successful continuing story at night time and revolutionized television in that regard.  Finally add in the geniuses behind the scenes-David Jacobs created the show but it mainly belonged to Leonard Katzman, who really made it what it was, with his main right-hand man as writer Arthur Bernard Lewis.  Other great writers came and went through the years and left their own mark in their own special way such as Camille Marchetta, David Paulsen, Howard Lakin, Lisa Seidman, and more.  There's also the memorable cliffhangers, most notable of course Who Shot JR and Bobby in the shower.  Here is a show where an entire year in the middle of the run turns out to be a dream, and I know many hate that but to me it is great, a part of what makes the show such a classic that it contains all these groundbreaking things.Over the course of it's run one can see it evolve from self-contained episodes to a serialized format where there is a lot of action, to slower paced and more glamorous seasons influenced by Dynasty, and then back to more focused and action-packed serialization again towards the end.  Personally I thought all the writers who came in did a great job bringing something new to the table while also keeping the show true to itself-with the possible exception of the dream which mostly had a different creative team and direction, as well as the very last season which was sort of meant to be less lively as a result of it being an ending, and written as such.  But for the most part, and even including those two seasonal departures, I find the entire show to be well-done from beginning to end.  For me, I was interested and captivated just as much by new characters and additions later on as the original ones.  I was glad it got the chance to last so long and try different things.On the whole I heartily recommend this as well as the TV Movies, which are mostly very good as well, especially the first reunion film JR Returns which is Katzman's final Dallas work and a wonderful swan song for him.  That being said I am thrilled Dallas is being revived and very much looking forward to it-I am sure Lenny himself would have been pleased.  I have no idea how the new Dallas will turn out exactly as far as quality goes on the whole, but whatever happens, the totality of this original work will always stand as the the epitome of television entertainment as far as I'm concerned.",5,"Dallas-My Favorite Show, Finally All Available",1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,4426,"['hard', 'summarize', 'everything', 'great', 'Dallas', 'small', 'review', 'course', 'was', 'massive', 'hit', 'back', 'day', 'now', 'scheduled', 'revival', 'incredible', 'though', 'original', 'truly', 'masterwork', 'Created', 'David', 'Jacobs', 'best', 'described', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'meets', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Texas', 'Godfather', 'thrown', 'have', 'two', 'feuding', 'families', 'Barnes', 'Ewing', 'slew', 'other', 'characters', 'events', 'really', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'course', 'series', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'involved', 'Oil', 'Cattle', 'Business', 'Texas', 'use', 'bevy', 'schemes', 'betrayals', 'relationships', 'character', 'flaws', 'money', 'wage', 'war', 'beginning', 'story', 'Ewings', 'are', 'rich', 'family', 'owners', 'Southfork', 'Ranch', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'poor', 'working', 'class', ""Barnes'es"", 'represent', 'other', 'side', 'there', 'course', '14', 'seasons', 'groundwork', 'laid', 'action', 'fall', 'character', 'fates', 'play', 'out', 'amazing', 'surprising', 'ways.At', 'center', 'JR', 'Ewing-Larry', 'Hagman', 'broke', 'ground', 'TV', 'star', 'playing', 'bad', 'man', 'least', 'very', 'flawed', 'one', 'good', 'qualities', 'well', 'who', 'was', 'extremely', 'likable', 'Add', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'so', 'huge', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'make', 'definitive', 'list', 'right', 'here', 'have', 'tried', 'individual', 'season', 'reviews', 'are', 'original', 'stars', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'good', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Ken', 'Kercheval', 'Ewing', 'nemesis', 'Cliff', 'Barnes', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'Matriarch', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'patriarch', 'Jock', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'Pam', 'Barnes', 'Ewing', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Ewing', 'Steve', 'Kanaly', 'Ray', 'Krebbs', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'additions', 'Susan', 'Howard', 'Donna', 'Culver', 'Audrey', 'Landers', 'Afton', 'Cooper', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Clayton', 'Farlow', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'Jenna', 'Wade', 'Sheree', 'J', 'Wilson', 'April', 'Stevens', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Carter', 'McKay', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'list.Add', 'fact', 'told', 'successful', 'continuing', 'story', 'night', 'time', 'revolutionized', 'television', 'regard', 'Finally', 'add', 'geniuses', 'scenes-David', 'Jacobs', 'created', 'show', 'mainly', 'belonged', 'Leonard', 'Katzman', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'what', 'was', 'main', 'right-hand', 'man', 'writer', 'Arthur', 'Bernard', 'Lewis', 'Other', 'great', 'writers', 'came', 'went', 'years', 'left', 'own', 'mark', 'own', 'special', 'way', 'such', 'Camille', 'Marchetta', 'David', 'Paulsen', 'Howard', 'Lakin', 'Lisa', 'Seidman', 'more', 'also', 'memorable', 'cliffhangers', 'most', 'notable', 'course', 'Who', 'Shot', 'JR', 'Bobby', 'shower', 'Here', 'show', 'where', 'entire', 'year', 'middle', 'run', 'out', 'be', 'dream', 'know', 'many', 'hate', 'great', 'part', 'what', 'show', 'such', 'classic', 'groundbreaking', 'things.Over', 'course', 'run', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'evolve', 'self-contained', 'episodes', 'serialized', 'format', 'where', 'lot', 'action', 'slower', 'paced', 'more', 'glamorous', 'seasons', 'influenced', 'Dynasty', 'then', 'back', 'more', 'focused', 'action-packed', 'serialization', 'again', 'end', 'Personally', 'thought', 'writers', 'who', 'came', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'something', 'new', 'table', 'also', 'keeping', 'show', 'true', 'itself-with', 'possible', 'exception', 'dream', 'mostly', 'had', 'different', 'creative', 'team', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'sort', 'meant', 'be', 'less', 'lively', 'result', 'being', 'ending', 'written', 'such', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'including', 'two', 'seasonal', 'departures', 'find', 'entire', 'show', 'be', 'well-done', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'interested', 'captivated', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'new', 'characters', 'additions', 'later', 'original', 'ones', 'was', 'glad', 'got', 'chance', 'last', 'so', 'long', 'try', 'different', 'whole', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'as', 'well', 'TV', 'Movies', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'especially', 'first', 'reunion', 'film', 'JR', 'Returns', 'Katzman', 'final', 'Dallas', 'work', 'wonderful', 'swan', 'song', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'thrilled', 'Dallas', 'being', 'revived', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'it-I', 'am', 'sure', 'Lenny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'new', 'Dallas', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'exactly', 'as', 'far', 'quality', 'whole', 'totality', 'original', 'work', 'will', 'always', 'stand', 'epitome', 'television', 'entertainment', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned']",N/A

I have taken down my undersized basketball hoop and put up a new tv along with a dvd player so I can play these shows. What the rubes get to do is for 5 bucks I let them pick out a card. On this card is a character from the show, an action that must be done and a time limit. An example of this is J.R., hatch and evil plan, 2 minutes. If this happens the rube wins a prize! I can't tell you how many people have lined up my only issue is that I have made too many easy ones, like bobby acting like a punk in 6 minutes, Ive had to pay out on that one each time.

I'm pretty good at guessing what will come next, but many times I was thrown with my mouth wide open or my eyes big as saucers!!  So much fun to see crazy story lines, fashion & hair do changes with the times, and off set adventures.  It was also very interesting to see how the Southfork Ranch scenery matured, how the first sets matured so that they were more realistic,etc.  I loved the variety of characters that were brought into the mix and in some cases were sad to see them go.  I absolutely loved the glamour and towards the end (most recent) prior to the 2012 series, how ugly Sue Ellen's hair dos were so unflattering!  The commentaries were also good to see to get a more well rounded view of what the directors were trying to achieve. If you note on the credits with each series, some of the main actors also had hand at directing as well! To see Barbara Eden join with Larry Hagman again from their old ""I dream of Jeannie"" days was fun to watch.  Hagman was a REAL looker in those days, but my favorites throughout were Bobbie Ewing and Sue Ellen Ewing as characters as I was rooting for them the most.  There were times that I truly was looking forward to J.R. getting knocked down on his ear as he was so evil.  Such fun!  There were times that I started to see a likeable vulnerable side to Cliff Barnes too, (as his character was so chaotic)!  If you go to [...], you'll also get great bios and character summaries (with great pics) to complete the whole storyline! You won't be sorry to get the Seasons 1-14 as well as the Movie collection as if you're not careful, you'll become a REAL COUCH POTATO until it is completed!
