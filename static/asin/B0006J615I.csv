870549,A15MHXG5FZYSD,B0006J615I,Scott Masterton,"[9, 9]","This was the series that intruduced martial arts and Eastern philosophy to a whole generation. Although Caine (David Carradine) uses martial arts in the show, Kung-Fu was never a martial arts show. Caine, if anything, is a Christ-like figure; he's gentle and forgiving and has a deep insight into the human condition. The show is extremely character and story driven with a touch of action, which makes for great entertainment that any age viewer can enjoy and understand on different levels.There has been much discussion concerning the fact that Bruce Lee was in fact one of the original creators of the show and that it was actually designed to be a vehicle for him. How much of that is true and how much of the story is Hollywood myth is debatable and frankly unimportant...however, what is true is that Bruce had a completely different aura about him. His Caine would have been completely different and in my humble opinion, the show would have become a martial arts series and therefore not nearly as ""important"" or deep. Carradine brought a real softness to the character that made the show what it was.If you want to watch good TV that not only entertains but teaches, buy all three seasons of Kung-Fu, you won't be dissappointed.",5,One of the best TV shows ever made,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1238,"['was', 'series', 'intruduced', 'martial', 'arts', 'Eastern', 'philosophy', 'whole', 'generation', 'Caine', 'David', 'Carradine', 'martial', 'arts', 'show', 'Kung-Fu', 'was', 'never', 'martial', 'arts', 'show', 'Caine', 'anything', 'Christ-like', 'figure', 'gentle', 'forgiving', 'deep', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'show', 'extremely', 'character', 'story', 'driven', 'touch', 'action', 'great', 'entertainment', 'age', 'viewer', 'can', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'different', 'levels.There', 'been', 'much', 'discussion', 'concerning', 'fact', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'original', 'creators', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'designed', 'be', 'vehicle', 'How', 'much', 'true', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'myth', 'debatable', 'frankly', 'unimportant', 'however', 'what', 'true', 'Bruce', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'aura', 'Caine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'different', 'humble', 'opinion', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'martial', 'arts', 'series', 'therefore', 'not', 'nearly', 'important', 'deep', 'Carradine', 'brought', 'real', 'softness', 'character', 'made', 'show', 'what', 'was.If', 'want', 'watch', 'good', 'TV', 'not', 'only', 'teaches', 'buy', 'three', 'seasons', 'Kung-Fu', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissappointed']",N/A

There are some available, but none cover it from the perspective I have. There are many episodes where Caine shows his displeasure of eating meat, and in the first season he even converted two different characters to being vegetarian. And in the third season, Caine finally rides a horse in the very final episode, but only after he apologises to it.
