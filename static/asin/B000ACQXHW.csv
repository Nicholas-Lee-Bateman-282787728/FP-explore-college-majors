925953,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000ACQXHW,&#308;&#308;,"[7, 7]","NOTE: All of ""The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing"" workouts by Jillian Michaels seem to have their reviews linked together.  However, this review is ONLY for her Cardio Kickbox workout.Jillian Michaels had made a reputation of being one of the toughest trainers that there is, and this workout is no exception.  In this workout, however, as opposed to some of her more recent workouts, Jillian, has a more fun personality.  She is still tough, and she will still push you and be motivational at the same time, but she also will jokes and laugh throughout the workout.There is a quick motivational intro by Jillian at the beginning, but then you start the warm up.  The warm up is a really short mixture of squats, kicks, and jumps.  It's pretty much of a really short workout in itself.Next, you move on to the actual workout.  Jillian will cover everything from jumping jacks to punches to side kicks, and she will make it tough but fun.  She goes REALLY fast, though, so get ready.  I've never seen an instructor do punches, kicks, or jumps so quickly in a video.  I sometimes felt like my technique would be bad because of this, and I would have to slightly slow down to keep my technique good.  Jillian will also pretty much go from one move to another, so aside from one or two instances, you really don't get any kind of break.  The workout itself is about 20 minutes, which, trust me, is long enough!  This workout is intense cardio that will really push you physically!  Definitely not for beginners!Then, at the end, there will be a short cooldown where you will be led through stretching of the shoulders, hamstrings, and neck.  That's it, though.  No more leg stretches or arm stretches, and I felt that there could have been just a few more.  After the cooldown, there is another quick motivational talk by Jillian.Overall, this was a really great cardio workout that I will be doing very often.  It is extremely difficult, and this is coming from an advanced exerciser.  Other than the few cons of it being a little too fast or too few stretches in the cooldown, it is still a great workout that I recommend if you are looking for a short, no-nonsense kickboxing workout.",4,Cardio Kickbox Review,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,2190,"['NOTE', 'Biggest', 'Winner', 'How', 'Win', 'Losing', 'workouts', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'seem', 'have', 'reviews', 'linked', 'together', 'However', 'review', 'ONLY', 'Cardio', 'Kickbox', 'workout.Jillian', 'Michaels', 'had', 'made', 'reputation', 'being', 'one', 'toughest', 'trainers', 'workout', 'exception', 'workout', 'however', 'opposed', 'more', 'recent', 'workouts', 'Jillian', 'more', 'fun', 'personality', 'still', 'tough', 'will', 'still', 'push', 'be', 'motivational', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'will', 'jokes', 'laugh', 'workout.There', 'quick', 'motivational', 'intro', 'Jillian', 'beginning', 'then', 'start', 'warm', 'up', 'warm', 'up', 'really', 'short', 'mixture', 'squats', 'kicks', 'jumps', 'pretty', 'much', 'really', 'short', 'workout', 'itself.Next', 'move', 'actual', 'workout', 'Jillian', 'will', 'cover', 'everything', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'punches', 'side', 'kicks', 'will', 'make', 'tough', 'fun', 'REALLY', 'fast', 'though', 'so', 'get', 'ready', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'instructor', 'do', 'punches', 'kicks', 'jumps', 'so', 'quickly', 'video', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'technique', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'slightly', 'slow', 'down', 'keep', 'technique', 'good', 'Jillian', 'will', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'go', 'one', 'move', 'so', 'aside', 'one', 'two', 'instances', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'kind', 'break', 'workout', '20', 'minutes', 'trust', 'long', 'enough', 'workout', 'intense', 'cardio', 'will', 'really', 'push', 'physically', 'Definitely', 'not', 'beginners', 'Then', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'short', 'cooldown', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'led', 'stretching', 'shoulders', 'hamstrings', 'neck', 'though', 'more', 'leg', 'stretches', 'arm', 'stretches', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'cooldown', 'quick', 'motivational', 'talk', 'Jillian.Overall', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'cardio', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'very', 'often', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'coming', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'Other', 'few', 'cons', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'few', 'stretches', 'cooldown', 'still', 'great', 'workout', 'recommend', 'are', 'looking', 'short', 'no-nonsense', 'kickboxing', 'workout']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front

925956,A2B5038SQTFOZ8,B000ACQXHW,Amanda N Morton,"[0, 0]","I bought this DVD set at Half Price books and I think I got a fantastic deal- these DVDs are GREAT!! I like these even better than the 30 day Shred series because she doesn't talk/ explain each move- fine when you're first starting but after 25 times I think I know what comes next. She also is funny ( I think) in this series as this is before she became a huge celebrity- so she seems more ""real"" not scripted.  I also feel like these workouts go by fast because you keep moving- there are no rest periods and  I like that because its over before I know it and I am drenched in sweat.  My boyfriend has said that only when I do Jillian Michaels can he see a big difference compared to other workout methods.  If you want the biggest ""bang for you buck"" and maximize your time- this is the workout for you. Also- she uses a step in the workout but I do the workout without and ""step up"" onto my workout mat and its still a great workout, I would say get the step if you need the advanced version.  Its a co ed DVD- so all of you guys that think this workout is for women only, think again- you will also get a great workout too. If you're still unsure- I check out all the DVDs I purchase from the library first to see if I like it enough to purchase.",5,Love this DVD!!

I like kickboxing, but I should have known better, because I didn't like her weight workouts either when I tried them some time ago.

This one does get your heart rate up somewhat, but it's over before I feel that I got a real workout. I think it's only about 20 minutes at the most.

925959,A8KWNRQPZLAXC,B000ACQXHW,Bette,"[1, 1]","Compared to Jillian's current workouts, this is almost a breeze.  It's intense, don't get me wrong -you're constantly moving, working up a sweat, getting good cardio.  But it's nowhere near as physically demanding as other kickbox workouts I've done, and it's only about 20 minutes long.Also unlike her current dvds, this is a class setting.  Jillian interacts with her class throughout, joking and laughing. There is a sense of camaraderie.  Being an early dvd from Jillian, her demeanor is slightly different from her current persona - she's downright goofy at times here. Not a lot of coaching going on, or talk of form.  It's pretty basic kickboxing - front kicks, back kicks, roundhouse. Squats, jump rope, jab-cross and uppercuts, fast feet and standing abs.To maximize, I do this workout 3 different ways.  1. I do Jillian's Cardio Kickbox first, followed by Denise Austin's Power Kickboxing.  2. I do Cardio Kickbox three times in a row.  The first two times, as is, and I use 2 1/2 lb weights for the jab-cross. The final time, I drop the weights and skip the jumping jacks.  3. I increase the reps of each exercise as I go along, turning it into one hour long workout.  For instance, instead of just 10 body-crosses, I'll do 40 each interval. Instead of 30 seconds of fast feet, I'll do one minute or more.  Instead of just 10 front-kick-back-kicks, I'll do 30, and so on.As it is, a perfectly acceptable, intense, sweaty cardio workout.  But I'd love to see Jillian do an updated kickboxing dvd.",4,Brief but good cardio workout,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1506,"['Compared', 'Jillian', 'current', 'workouts', 'almost', 'breeze', 'intense', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', '-you', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'moving', 'working', 'up', 'sweat', 'getting', 'good', 'cardio', 'nowhere', 'near', 'physically', 'demanding', 'other', 'kickbox', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'done', 'only', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'long.Also', 'current', 'dvds', 'class', 'setting', 'Jillian', 'interacts', 'class', 'joking', 'laughing', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'Being', 'early', 'dvd', 'Jillian', 'demeanor', 'slightly', 'different', 'current', 'persona', 'downright', 'goofy', 'times', 'here', 'Not', 'lot', 'coaching', 'going', 'talk', 'form', 'pretty', 'basic', 'kickboxing', 'front', 'kicks', 'back', 'kicks', 'roundhouse', 'Squats', 'jump', 'rope', 'jab-cross', 'uppercuts', 'fast', 'feet', 'standing', 'abs.To', 'maximize', 'do', 'workout', '3', 'different', 'ways', '1', 'do', 'Cardio', 'Kickbox', 'first', 'followed', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Power', 'Kickboxing', '2', 'do', 'Cardio', 'Kickbox', 'three', 'times', 'row', 'first', 'two', 'times', 'use', '2', '1/2', 'lb', 'weights', 'jab-cross', 'final', 'time', 'drop', 'weights', 'skip', 'jumping', 'jacks', '3', 'increase', 'reps', 'exercise', 'go', 'along', 'turning', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'instance', 'instead', 'just', '10', 'body-crosses', ""'ll"", 'do', '40', 'interval', 'Instead', '30', 'seconds', 'fast', 'feet', ""'ll"", 'do', 'one', 'minute', 'more', 'Instead', 'just', '10', 'front-kick-back-kicks', ""'ll"", 'do', '30', 'so', 'on.As', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'intense', 'sweaty', 'cardio', 'workout', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'Jillian', 'do', 'updated', 'kickboxing', 'dvd']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front
925960,A39QK30SQDTHUJ,B000ACQXHW,Butterfly dancer,"[4, 4]","I love Jillian Michaels' DVDs.  This set of 5 is amazing - just amazing!Each DVD is under 30 minutes - it is easy to fast forward through the intro at the beginning of each one.  But they are quick, and effective.  I have quite an extensive collection of exercise DVDs - from Tae Bo to Pilates, to various Dance workouts and those ""10 minute"" deals.  But this set is the only one which gets my heart pumping in a really short amount of time.  Thanks to Jillian, now I have a huge collection of exercise DVDs just gathering dust!Keep in mind, there is a lot of jumping, and she does move quickly from exercise to exercise without much direction as to what the next move is, but that's how she is able to squeeze so much in very little time.  And really once you have done it once, the DVDs are very easy to follow along.  The moves are easy, but very effective as you are not wasting a second of your time.Combined with her ""30 day shred"" DVD (another AWESOME workout), I am finding my clothes are fitting better and are even getting too big on me!  I'm down from a size 6 to a size 4!  Being of pretty average build, I have struggled with getting more lean and cut, but these DVDs have really pushed me past that plateau and towards a really toned body.  No other DVD I own has given me such quick and effective results.Jillian is tough on her crew, but I can appreciate her ""tough love"" attitude.  Don't give up and just keep at it.

I've been using them in this order: Shape Up - Front, Shape Up - Back, Cardio Kickbox, Maximize - Full Frontal, Maximize - Back in Action; Mon.-Fri.  They are circuit training or interval training type workouts, which means you use a light set of weights and alternate between strength exercises and cardio exercises, sometimes using the weights during cardio sets.  She tells you to use any weight you're comfortable with and that pushes you (for me that's 5 pounds, a beginner might use 2-3 pounds, and advanced women or men might use 8-10 pounds or more).  You move quickly from exercise to exercise, and the time flys by.Sometimes she gets a little chatty and seems to be wasting time, but only for a few seconds here and there.  She also has had the people exercising in the DVDs do more sets if she thinks they didn't try hard enough or it went too quick, which I thought wasn't fair to people at home using the videos!  I also thought it was strange that she doesn't do the whole workout - she goes around and watches the other people or makes it harder for them.  It makes me wonder if she could do the whole thing she's expecting others to do (I'm sure she can, just look at her, but I've never had a DVD where the instructor didn't do the whole workout with you).So other than those minor complaints, I highly recommend these videos to people looking for a challenging workout that isn't time-consuming.  Most people only have 30 minutes or so to spend on exercise, and these DVDs fit the bill.",5,Awesome workout set,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,2151,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'nation', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'saw', 'recommended', 'healthy-living', 'website', 'belong', 'ordered', 'set', '30-day', 'shred', 'DVD.I', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avid', 'exerciser', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'challenged', 'got', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Prevention', 'fitness', 'systems', 'DVDs', '10-minute', 'solution', 'DVDs', 'others', 'were', 'main', 'workouts', 'went', 'again', 'again', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Jillian', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'out', 'next', 'DVD', 'workout', '25-30', 'minutes', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'order', 'Shape', 'Front', 'Shape', 'Up', 'Back', 'Cardio', 'Kickbox', 'Maximize', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'Maximize', 'Back', 'Action', 'Mon.-Fri', 'are', 'circuit', 'training', 'interval', 'training', 'type', 'workouts', 'use', 'light', 'set', 'weights', 'alternate', 'strength', 'exercises', 'cardio', 'exercises', 'sometimes', 'using', 'weights', 'cardio', 'sets', 'use', 'weight', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'pushes', '5', 'pounds', 'beginner', 'might', 'use', '2-3', 'pounds', 'advanced', 'women', 'men', 'might', 'use', '8-10', 'pounds', 'more', 'move', 'quickly', 'exercise', 'exercise', 'time', 'flys', 'little', 'chatty', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'here', 'there', 'also', 'had', 'people', 'exercising', 'DVDs', 'do', 'more', 'sets', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'went', 'too', 'quick', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'fair', 'people', 'home', 'using', 'videos', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'strange', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'workout', 'around', 'other', 'people', 'harder', 'wonder', 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'expecting', 'others', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'just', 'look', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'DVD', 'where', 'instructor', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'workout', 'other', 'minor', 'complaints', 'highly', 'recommend', 'videos', 'people', 'looking', 'challenging', 'workout', ""n't"", 'time-consuming', 'Most', 'people', 'only', 'have', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'spend', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'fit', 'bill']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front

925971,A12OW9KMHGK1EE,B000ACQXHW,"Kara L. Sanford ""Kaleigh""","[6, 6]","I checked this DVD out from the library, as I usually do before purchasing. I do own Shred and really like it, and I've tried a few of the Biggest Loser workouts and am usually pretty happy with those as well. To put this in context, I'm at a pretty high fitness level (spinning, running, kickboxing, circuit training, etc), have lost a lot of weight, and am working on getting the last 10 lbs off. Bob Harper's boot camp workout was doable but definitely gave me a workout, as did the full BL Cardio Max. I was confused with this one right off the bat. I never thought I'd describe JM as too giggly, but she is in this dvd, and she stops the workout - which is only about 22 minutes - several times, for silly reasons. First, she makes us stand there and wait while she stops several minutes into the routine to pull her hair back in a ponytail. Then a few times she actually stops to turn around and stare at the people doing the workout - presumably to scold them for not working hard enough, I guess. Only she leaves those of us at home hanging around and waiting for the workout to start back up. The workout itself is not a bad one if you're just looking to do a quick cardio routine. I like kickboxing and enjoyed a lot of her moves. But she seemed very unfocused, kept giggling, looking at her team, and trying to remember what was next. Finally, at the end, she was, literally, out of breath, which I also found confusing, as I was decidedly NOT out of breath. Ain't no way I'm in better shape than she is. Bottom Line: not a bad workout for a quick one but could get very annoying very quickly. Check it out or rent it. Don't buy it. If you want a good 20-25 minute cardio workout, get Shred. As another reviewer said, maybe if you put your TV on mute. And then maybe if you did jumping jacks during her weird breaks in the routine, it would be okay.

I actually put it away for about a year until I received a heart rate monitor for Christmas, which caused me to do EVERY dvd workout I own. Some of these dvds surprised me:(In order of my preference):1. Maximize - Back in ActionI had never even done this workout before. I am a dental hygienist so I cannot focus on my arms too much early in the week. If I want to work out my arms, I have to do it Thursday or Friday because I do not get to rest my arms at work (constantly have them lifted) and cannot handle it together.I used light weights and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to feel the workout, but not be too sore at work. In addition, this video burned the most calories for me (133lbs) at 285 calories in 25 minutes. It is actually at the top of my ""30 minutes or less workout"" for burning the most. 11.4 calories per MINUTE.2.Cardio KickboxI love kickboxing, so did use this dvd a few years ago. I burned 282 calories in 25 minutes w/ this dvd. High energy and high heart rate!3. Maximize Full Frontal249 calories in 26 minutes. Personally, does not impress me. Anything under 10 calories a minute is not my 'go to workout'. This is ranked 7th in my '30 minutes or less videos'. Good for arms and they did get tired, so it definitely serves its purpose4. Shape Up - Backside8 calories a minute... not impressed. Again, others might be, but I have been doing this too long to be impressed w/ that. Its last in my calories burned rank, but again, for beginners, definitely a keeper. She gets you going!5.

When I actually got the DVD, I found a very different workout than I expected.  It is a very intense cardio workout during which you do some upper body weight training.  However, because of the pace and how the weights are used in some parts of the workout (i.e, overhead), I had to go down from the usual 5 lb. hand weights I use for home workouts to the 2-pounders in order to keep up.  Now that I've done the workout once, I know that I could keep my 5-pounders nearby and switch to those for standard weight-training exercises such as tricep kickbacks, but keep the 2-pounders for aerobic movements with weights.I exercise 5 days a week and do a combination of cardio, weight training and toning, so I'm in relatively good shape.  However, I am still about 35 pounds overweight (not to mention over age 50), so I found some of the cardio movements (mountain climbers, plyos, etc.) either too tough or too fast to keep up with.  I got through the entire workout, which was a half-hour I believe, but I had to do some alternative movements here and there.  (P.S. You need an aerobic step for this workout--she uses it as an aerobic step and also to lay on to do some weight work, etc.)No doubt about it, Jillian is tough.  I truly believe that, if I was physically able to do this workout exactly as offered, I would see results.  However, that unfortunately isn't the case.  As a result, the workout had the effect of making me feel like a failure instead of inspiring and motivating me.  That's not Jillian's fault--I'm just saying that it makes sense for me to spend my money on workouts that energize me and lift me up instead of making me feel like I'm not good or strong enough.Just to give you a basis for comparison, I rent and buy a LOT of exercise DVDs and it's not often I end up with one that I feel is above my fitness level.  When I first tried Tae-bo it seemed overwhelming, but now I can get through a 45-minute Tae-bo workout fine.  So yea, if I kept trying this Shape Up Front workout, it would no doubt eventually get easier for me.  However, doing the workout the first time did not leave me feeling motivated enough to keep putting myself through that workout until that happens.",3,Not what I expected but definitely a challenging workout!,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,2306,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'description', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'weight', 'training', 'workout', 'When', 'actually', 'got', 'DVD', 'found', 'very', 'different', 'expected', 'very', 'intense', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', 'upper', 'body', 'weight', 'training', 'However', 'pace', 'how', 'weights', 'are', 'used', 'parts', 'workout', 'i.e', 'overhead', 'had', 'go', 'down', 'usual', '5', 'lb', 'hand', 'weights', 'use', 'home', 'workouts', '2-pounders', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'done', 'workout', 'once', 'know', 'could', 'keep', '5-pounders', 'nearby', 'switch', 'standard', 'weight-training', 'exercises', 'such', 'tricep', 'kickbacks', 'keep', '2-pounders', 'aerobic', 'movements', 'weights.I', 'exercise', '5', 'days', 'week', 'do', 'combination', 'cardio', 'weight', 'training', 'toning', ""'m"", 'relatively', 'good', 'shape', 'However', 'am', 'still', '35', 'pounds', 'overweight', 'not', 'mention', 'age', '50', 'so', 'found', 'cardio', 'movements', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'plyos', 'etc', 'too', 'tough', 'too', 'fast', 'keep', 'up', 'got', 'entire', 'workout', 'was', 'half-hour', 'believe', 'had', 'do', 'alternative', 'movements', 'here', 'there', 'P.S', 'need', 'aerobic', 'step', 'workout', 'aerobic', 'step', 'also', 'lay', 'do', 'weight', 'work', 'etc', 'doubt', 'Jillian', 'tough', 'truly', 'believe', 'was', 'physically', 'able', 'do', 'workout', 'exactly', 'offered', 'would', 'see', 'results', 'However', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'case', 'result', 'workout', 'had', 'effect', 'making', 'feel', 'failure', 'instead', 'inspiring', 'motivating', 'not', 'Jillian', 'fault', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'sense', 'spend', 'money', 'workouts', 'energize', 'lift', 'up', 'instead', 'making', 'feel', ""'m"", 'not', 'good', 'strong', 'enough.Just', 'give', 'basis', 'comparison', 'rent', 'buy', 'LOT', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'not', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'feel', 'fitness', 'level', 'When', 'first', 'tried', 'Tae-bo', 'seemed', 'overwhelming', 'now', 'can', 'get', '45-minute', 'Tae-bo', 'workout', 'fine', 'So', 'yea', 'kept', 'trying', 'Shape', 'Up', 'Front', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'eventually', 'get', 'easier', 'However', 'doing', 'workout', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'feeling', 'motivated', 'enough', 'keep', 'putting', 'workout']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front

I was always tired, lazy, and I own very little clothing items in size 16 (women's). So I declared that I was tired of being fat which is why I ordered this workout.On Januaray 22, 2013 (2 days ago), I weighed in at 190 pounds, and I am so happy about that. I intend to keep doing these very intensive, high-power workouts Jillian has put together.Cardio-Kickbox is my favorite. She does each exercise in sets of 10, 20, or 30 reps, and she goes directly from one straight into the next one which is why the heart rate elevates, and the calories burn off. It was so hard when I did it the first time, and honestly, I did not complete it.

925997,A224OZGTYNKZ1X,B000ACQXHW,tamlynn,"[1, 1]","I just bought this DVD 2 weeks ago from Sports Authority [...].  I am not a fan of The Biggest Loser show (never really watched it), but I do know that the contestants lose an incredible amount of weight, so I was eager to try this.  It is an amazing DVD- kick butt workout, but not for beginners!  Jillian doesn't stress form or breathing techniques so for beginners, I recommend starting with a more instructional video in order to avoid injuries and maximize benefits.This is a hard-core workout.  When Jillian says in the middle that you're not going to die, it definetely felt like I was going to the first couple of times.  I do this 3 times a week (alternating with strength training videos like Denise Austin).  In the two weeks I've been doing this (along with changing my eating habits to cut out sodas and unhealthy snacks totally), I'm already seeing results.  I've lost a few pounds and dropped an inch in size.The first 2 or 3 times I did this workout, I had to pause to drink some water.  But now, I am able to go the whole way through and only sip at the times when she pauses.The modified version is a joke.

Jillian has a traditional yelling-instructor style - she is the mean teacher who will shame you into working out. The quick routine is a good change when I'm short on time. My heartrate is usualy around 50-60% maximum during most of the workout.",3,Quick workout,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,386,"['quick', 'bootcamp-style', 'workout', 'Not', 'lot', 'complicated', 'cardio', 'mostly', 'athletic', 'strength', 'moves', 'weights', 'quickly', 'Jillian', 'traditional', 'yelling-instructor', 'style', 'mean', 'teacher', 'who', 'will', 'shame', 'working', 'out', 'quick', 'routine', 'good', 'change', 'when', ""'m"", 'short', 'time', 'heartrate', 'usualy', '50-60', '%', 'maximum', 'most', 'workout']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front
926000,A1QBJNXZ8ONSU2,B000ACQXHW,Tulip1,"[1, 1]",This workout def. gets your heart pumpin' and your body sweatin'!!! I bought this dvd because I recently purchased Jillians 30 day shred and really liked it. I wanted a cardio workout that was around 30 min. so I could do if after my weight-training workouts...and I was pleasantly surprised by how effective this workout is! After I finished the workout I looked down at my shirt and it was soaked with sweat on the front (I can run 2 1/2 miles after a weight-training workout and not even sweat like that)!!!! I would recommend this workout to anyone who enjoys cardio or who is looking for a GREAT cardio workout!!,5,Excellent cardio workout,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,617,"['workout', 'def', 'heart', 'pumpin', 'body', 'sweatin', 'bought', 'dvd', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Jillians', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'really', 'liked', 'wanted', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', '30', 'min', 'could', 'do', 'weight-training', 'workouts', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'effective', 'workout', 'finished', 'workout', 'looked', 'down', 'shirt', 'was', 'soaked', 'sweat', 'front', 'can', 'run', '2', '1/2', 'miles', 'weight-training', 'workout', 'not', 'even', 'sweat', 'would', 'recommend', 'workout', 'anyone', 'who', 'cardio', 'who', 'looking', 'GREAT', 'cardio', 'workout']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front
926001,A3MAZBPXCE0X64,B000ACQXHW,"Z. Jackson ""OK""","[3, 3]",When I bought these I was looking for some sort of workout to do at home while it is freezing outside ( I live where it gets really cold during the winter).  I decided to go with these DVD's as it came with 5 different workouts which I thought was  a great deal that way you don't have the same workout routine everyday it allows you to do a variety of things.  If you actually do the workouts as instructed and put your heart into it you'll find that it works you really good and you'll feel the workout afterwards.  If you just put a half heart into it you'll feel like these are a waste of money.  The one thing I wish I would have known before I bought these was she wants you to have special equipment like a stool and weights but you can improvise if needed.  The only other complaint I have is that you have to watch her little video every time about how working out has changed her life.,4,GREAT WORKOUT GREAT PRICE,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,895,"['When', 'bought', 'was', 'looking', 'sort', 'workout', 'do', 'home', 'freezing', 'live', 'where', 'really', 'cold', 'winter', 'decided', 'go', 'DVD', 'came', '5', 'different', 'workouts', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'workout', 'routine', 'everyday', 'do', 'variety', 'things', 'actually', 'do', 'workouts', 'instructed', 'put', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'find', 'really', 'good', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'workout', 'afterwards', 'just', 'put', 'half', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'are', 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'thing', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'bought', 'was', 'have', 'special', 'equipment', 'stool', 'weights', 'can', 'improvise', 'needed', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'have', 'have', 'watch', 'little', 'video', 'time', 'how', 'working', 'out', 'changed', 'life']",The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: Jillian Michael's Shape Up-Front
