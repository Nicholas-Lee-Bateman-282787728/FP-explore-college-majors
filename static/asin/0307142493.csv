306,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,0307142493,AbeStreet,"[3, 3]","I will be 33 in January 2002. I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.This was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.I suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it. It's not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it.",5,Timeless Classic!!,1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,1795,"['will', 'be', '33', 'January', '2002', 'only', 'mention', 'so', 'readers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'gauge', 'review', 'classic', 'based', 'age', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'prior', 'vcr', 'tapes', 'dvd', 'players', 'friends', 'would', 'wait', 'year', 'view', 'various', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'aired', 'year', 'remember', 'sitting', 'glued', 'tv', 'taking', 'second', 'shows', 'Back', 'then', 'missed', 'part', 'show', 'even', 'whole', 'show', 'were', 'border', 'line', 'depressed', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'whole', 'year', 'ways', 'anticipation', 'made', 'viewing', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'much', 'better.SANTA', 'CLAUS', 'IS', 'COMIN', 'TO', 'TOWN', 'SCICTT', 'top', 'five', 'Rankin/Bass', 'specials', 'Right', 'RUDOLPH', 'FROSTY', 'Year', 'WITHOUT', 'SANTA', 'CLAUS', 'enjoy', '1970', 'feel', 'classic', 'flowers', 'appear', 'when', 'Jessica', 'sings', 'simple', 'kids', 'play', 'songs', 'are', 'sung', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'modern', 'version', 'show', 'would', 'sound', 'boy', 'band', 'sounding', 'songs', 'electric', 'toys', 'video', 'games', 'Instead', 'watching', 'Kris', 'Jessica', 'court', 'other', 'wed', 'would', 'probably', 'see', 'live', 'together', 'consider', 'marriage.This', 'was', 'scary', 'classic', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'was', 'very', 'scary', 'when', 'viewed', 'kid', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'saw', 'kid', 'would', 'always', 'wonder', 'Kris', 'would', 'make', 'warlock.I', 'suppose', 'best', 'thing', 'type', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'when', 'people', 'age', 'view', 'can', 'escape', 'back', 'innocent', 'youth', 'short', 'while', 'Even', 'now', 'own', 'vhs', 'SCICTT', 'soon', 'will', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'make', 'kids', 'wait', 'Christmas', 'season', 'watch', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'anticipation', 'still', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'do', 'watch']",Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town VHS

322,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,0307142493,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[11, 11]","Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation ""on two's and three's"" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, ""Be Prepared to Pay"" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little.

With that in mind, I was able to see the undertone of this story. First, for parents-as a kid I used to enjoy the annual showing of this feature. Now to the undertone:A baby, Santa Claus (capitalism), is abandoned on the doorstep of elves (industrialists). The elves are unable to get their product, toys, to town. When Santa grows up, he decides that he has to make the trip to town, but first he has to go through the territory of the winter warlock (socialism-regulation). Meanwhile, in town, the Burgermeister-who rules the town with all the zest of a communist dictator, has outlawed toys and set mandatory labor for all the kids in town (how commie of him). When Santa gets to town, he befriends the town schoolteacher (education) and is branded an outlaw for giving out toys (how capitalist of him). A cold war ensues between the burgermeister and santa with santa making an annual raid to pass out toys and foil the burgermeister.

329,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,0307142493,Jim Jr,"[35, 37]","First, let's clear up one fact, this is NOT Claymation.It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.This fact aside, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot; is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.The songs are excellent, from the familiar &quot;Santa Claus is Coming To Town&quot; to the lovely &quot;My World Is Beginning Today&quot; sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show.

Many people get all the &quot;Animagic&quot; cartoons confused...so I'll try to pinpoint this one. This is not the one with Rudolph (&quot;...the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;) and not the one with the Heat Miser and Snow Miser (&quot;Year Without A Santa Claus&quot;). This is the one with the toy-hating Burgermeister Meisterburger and.....the Winter Warlock!!We get to see Santa Claus go from an orphaned baby raised by elves to a groovy, hip young adult who's outlawed for delivering toys to finally becoming the toy making/giving king of Christmas! We also get to see Mrs Claus as a groovilicious babe in her own right and she finally gets a name, Jessica.Some charmingly dated scenes only add to the warm innocence of this show: like when Jessica realizes &quot;her own town has turned against her&quot; and begins singing of her love for and desire to be with Kris Kringle....transcending into a cornucopia of hippy-trippy flowers, swirls and polka-dots and finally catching a glimpse of her paper cutout reflection in the water fountain in the center of town. Remarkable!!But, the show's main message is one of love and the courage to follow your heart and do what you know is right regardless of the obstacles that come in your way - so take that!....Burgermeister and Winter Warlock! Some touching moments, like when Kris and Jessica are married in the forest because no town would have them and one of the final scenes where we are shown the contrast of those who have no holiday spirit to Santa Claus, who gives of himself each year, are real tear-jerkers.A wonderful Christmas special that no holiday season is complete without.",5,"Warm, cozy and groovy......",1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,1774,"['hot', 'cocoa', 'shot', 'peppermint', 'schnapps', 'favorite', 'Rankin/Bass', 'specials', 'are', 'excellent', 'Many', 'people', 'get', 'quot', 'Animagic', 'quot', 'cartoons', 'confused', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'pinpoint', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'Rudolph', 'quot', 'Red-Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'quot', 'not', 'one', 'Heat', 'Miser', 'Snow', 'Miser', 'quot', 'A', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'quot', 'one', 'toy-hating', 'Burgermeister', 'Meisterburger', '..the', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'get', 'see', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'go', 'orphaned', 'baby', 'raised', 'elves', 'groovy', 'hip', 'young', 'adult', 'who', 'outlawed', 'delivering', 'toys', 'finally', 'becoming', 'toy', 'making/giving', 'king', 'Christmas', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Mrs', 'Claus', 'groovilicious', 'babe', 'own', 'right', 'finally', 'name', 'Jessica.Some', 'charmingly', 'dated', 'scenes', 'only', 'add', 'warm', 'innocence', 'show', 'when', 'Jessica', 'quot', 'own', 'town', 'turned', 'quot', 'singing', 'love', 'desire', 'be', 'Kris', 'Kringle', '.transcending', 'cornucopia', 'hippy-trippy', 'flowers', 'swirls', 'polka-dots', 'finally', 'catching', 'glimpse', 'paper', 'cutout', 'reflection', 'water', 'fountain', 'center', 'town', 'Remarkable', 'show', 'main', 'message', 'one', 'love', 'courage', 'follow', 'heart', 'do', 'what', 'know', 'right', 'regardless', 'obstacles', 'come', 'way', 'so', 'take', '.Burgermeister', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'touching', 'moments', 'when', 'Kris', 'Jessica', 'are', 'married', 'forest', 'town', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'shown', 'contrast', 'who', 'have', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'who', 'year', 'are', 'real', 'tear-jerkers.A', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'special', 'holiday', 'season', 'complete']",Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town VHS

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","It is rather ironic to think that the elfin Mickey Rooney would provide one of the best voices for Santa Claus ever in this 1970 stop-motion animated Christmas classic, but that is exactly what we have here. ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.Produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town."" These include ""First Toymaker To the King,"" ""Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),"" ""Put One Foot in Front of the Other,"" ""My World is Beginning Today,"" and ""What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol)."" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.The story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin).

After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. ""Where did Santa's suit come from?"", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend.",5,Rankin/Bass holiday magic,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,3130,"['STORY', 'Starting', 'off', 'newsreel', 'children', 'world', 'preparing', 'visit', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'meet', 'mailman', 'named', 'Special', 'Delivery', 'Kluger', 'introductory', 'comments', 'mailman', 'who', 'North', 'Pole', 'snowcat', 'type', 'vehicle', 'see', 'credits', 'spelled', 'out', 'mail', 'envelopes', 'stamp', 'representing', 'actor', 'listed', 'envelopes', 'are', 'question', 'children', 'world', 'Santa', 'Where', 'did', 'Santa', 'suit', 'come', 'more', 'show', 'can', 'proceed', 'show', 'where', 'Santa', 'got', 'start', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'sad', 'vilage', 'named', 'Sombertown', 'ruthlessly', 'run', 'Burgermeister', 'Meisterberger', 'are', 'outlawed', 'other', 'side', 'mountain', 'elves', 'are', 'raising', 'human', 'orphan', 'boy', 'learned', 'ways', 'toymaking', 'scary', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'prevented', 'delivering', 'toys', 'mountain', 'Whenthe', 'boy', 'givent', 'name', 'Kris', 'Kringle', 'deliver', 'toys', 'Arriving', 'there', 'Ms.', 'Jessica', 'love', 'Kris', 'arrested', 'toys', 'escape', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'going', 'deliver', 'toys', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'Kris', 'find', 'creative', 'ways', 'smeak', 'toys', 'children', 'avoid', 'being', 'captured', 'again', 'soldiers', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'traditions', 'hanging', 'stockings', 'using', 'chimney', 'delivering', 'night', 'making', 'reindeer', 'fly', 'nice/naughty', 'list', 'got', 'start.BEHIND', 'SCENES', 'Rankin/Bass', 'studios', 'was', 'most', 'prolific', 'creators', 'holiday', 'specials', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'huge', 'success', '1964', 'stop', 'motion', 'musical', 'Rudolph', 'Red', 'Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'created', 'less', '14', 'more', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'total', '35', 'specials', 'many', 'covered', 'other', 'holidays', '1970', 'audiences', 'were', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'clever', 'studio', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'last', 'picture', 'had', 'been', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'year', 'traditional', 'cel', 'animation', 'As', 'much', 'viewers', 'enjoyed', 'Frosty', 'really', 'liked', 'stop', 'motion', 'Animagic', 'was', 'specialty', 'studio', 'only', 'TV', 'specials', 'made', 'process', 'so', 'far', 'were', 'Rudolph', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'new', 'show', 'aired', 'ABC', 'December', '14', '1970', 'was', 'Animagic', 'was', 'one', 'hour', 'special', 'recieved', 'huge', 'ratings', 'still', 'year.This', 'special', 'had', 'best', 'voice', 'casting', 'made', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'older', 'Santa', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'Burgermeister', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Winter', 'Warlock', 'Mailmans', 'voice', 'songs', 'were', 'great', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'recreated', 'perfectly', 'mailman', 'figure', 'are', '6', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'including', 'title', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'Foot', 'Front', 'Other', 'Westminster', 'Childrens', 'Choir', 'performs', 'as', 'well', 'Music', 'lyrics', 'were', 'Maury', 'Laws', 'Jules', 'Bass', 'Writing', 'great', 'Romeo', 'Muller', 'who', 'worked', 'many', 'projects', 'Character', 'design', 'Paul', 'Coker', 'storyboards', 'continuity', 'Don', 'Duga', 'did', 'most', 'studios', 'are', 'several', 'releases', 'VHS', 'laserdisc', 'DVD', 'terrific', 'show', 'highly', 'reccommend']",Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town VHS

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word ""Claus"" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful ""My World is Beginning Today"" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with ""Put One Foot In Front of the Other"" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.",4,Rankin/Bass classic is near the top of their game,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,3091,"['love', 'how', 'Rankin/Bass', 'classics', '60s', '70s', 'get', 'classic', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'Broadway', 'stars', 'provide', 'voice', 'talents', 'certain', 'seriousness', 'occasion', 'Here', 'have', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'narrating', 'singing', 'couple', 'songs', '1970', 'stop-motion', 'retelling', 'origins', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Fred', 'mailman', 'delivering', 'letters', 'kids', 'Santa', 'answer', 'questions', 'charming', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'most', 'musical', 'themes', '50', 'minute', 'TV', 'special', 'first', 'broadcast', 'when', 'was', '5', 'Santa', 'was', 'orphan', 'left', 'doorstep', 'mean', 'Burgermeister', 'Meisterburger', 'still', 'love', 'name', 'Sombretown', 'ok', 'little', 'corny', 'merely', 'word', 'Claus', 'chain', 'neck', 'Burgermeister', 'mean', 'old', 'dude', ""n't"", 'want', 'mysterious', 'fortuitous', 'circumstances', 'up', 'Kringle', 'Mountains', 'Whispering', 'Winds', 'up', 'learning', 'make', 'toys', 'animals', 'forest', 'back', 'Sombretown', 'give', 'toys', 'kids', 'met', 'Burgermeister', 'opposition', 'way', 'reasons', 'red', 'suit', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'belly', 'laugh', 'etc', 'are', 'explained', 'voices', 'kids', 'breaking', 'Astaire', 'narration', 'times', 'ask', 'verify', 'was', 'fact', 'how', 'happened', 'Kinda', 'cool', 'even', 'adult.This', 'was', 'along', 'RUDOLPH', 'THE', 'RED-NOSED', 'REINDEER', 'favorite', 'holiday', 'special', 'kid', 'faded', 'somewhat', 'years', 'guess', 'remember', 'romance', 'Santa', 'schoolteacher', 'Jessica', 'Mrs', 'Claus', 'eventually', 'course', 'more', 'mawkish', 'sappy', 'was', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'fairly', 'dreadful', 'World', 'Beginning', 'Today', 'full', 'cool', '60s', 'hippie/flower', 'people', 'imagery', 'early', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'really', 'fairly', 'dark', 'bleak', 'interesting', 'Burgermeister', 'moment', 'where', 'back', 'childhood', 'never', 'reforms', 'leave', 'still', 'villainous', 'Potter', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'story', 'original', 'film', 'think', 'bit', 'influenced', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'pagan/natural', 'nature', 'Santa', 'see', 'early', 'end', 'specifically', 'Christian', 'element', 'picture', 'Apart', 'love', 'song', 'already', 'mentioned', 'rest', 'music', 'pretty', 'good', 'Put', 'One', 'Foot', 'Front', 'Other', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'still', 'lump', 'throat.In', 'addition', 'Astaire', 'voice', 'talents', 'include', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Winter', 'magician', 'who', 'rules', 'mountains', 'tries', 'stop', 'Claus', 'quickly', 'befriended', 'professional', 'voice', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'Burgermeister', 'others', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Kringle/Santa', 'Claus', 'role', 'would', 'repeat', 'YEAR', 'A', 'SANTA', 'CLAUS', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'especially', 'Wynn', 'underrated', 'actor', 'great', 'vocal', 'talent', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'fun', 'remembered', 'last', 'viewing', 'probably', 'decade', 'RUDOLPH', 'suspect', 'will', 'always', 'rule', 'inner', 'child', 'heart']",Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town VHS

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed.

I did not know it even exsisted until I was 9 years old, and I LOVED IT! I was introduced to this one fairly late in my child  hood, but it still holds a special place in my heart right next to Frosty  and Rudolph. This is the one with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger, who  &quot;HATES TOYS!&quot;. I love this character MORE THAN the Grinch! This  one also includes the Winter Warlock and Special Delivery Klugger, as well  as a not so cocky (for a change) Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle. This film  is a true Holiday classic that keep Christ in Christmas. There are MANY  religious undertones in this film (just look at the Winter Warlock  Character and watch his development from bad to good.) This is yet another  materpiece by Romeo Muller, the GREATEST author who EVER lived! The man  REALLY understood children. Some people say that this film is a bit dated,  but I would have to disagree. I was born in 1980, and missed the 70's and  it never seemed like it was out of place to me (It was 1989 when I first  saw it.) It will fit right in with all of the other Holiday films your  children watch. No Holiday video collection is complete without this Gem.  The songs are GREAT, the plot is EXCELLENT, and the characters are  OUTSTANDING! You can't go wrong with this one!

Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution.

362,AFEN54UGJQOK9,0307142493,"wally gator ""the only""","[6, 6]","Whats good about alot of these Christmas DVD's that have come out in the last few years is that they present the specials in their original form. One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.I watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.But there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.It is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.But thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials. I'm a kid of the eighties. I have no real recollection of what the sixties/seventies were all about but I like the style. For you peeps out there that do remember, you should appreciate the uncut renditions of these specials found on DVD. It is the only way to ensure that your kids, and your kids kids, never forget just how flipping strange you people were in the seventies. Thank you. Much love and Merry Christmas.
