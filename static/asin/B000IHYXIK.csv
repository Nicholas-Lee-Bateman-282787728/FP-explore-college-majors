The color and image quality seems to be near perfect, the sound even better (the only picture scratchiness I think I've seen so far is when the producers spliced in a bit of genuine WWII footage, that can sometimes be very scratchy).I do have a complaint, about CBS, the first three sets had several extras (2nd season was really good) fourth and fifth seasons have nothing, not even a listing thanking surviving cast members. All Fifth season has is different colors for each disc (didn't even bother to put cast pictures on them- Fourth did do that)and a promo for several other CBS DVD sets.I hope the sixth and final season has a lot better than that!",4,"Great entertainment, image and sound quality- NO extras worth mentioning",1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,765,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'found', 'be', 'as', 'entertaining', 'other', 'sets', 'series', 'color', 'image', 'quality', 'be', 'near', 'perfect', 'sound', 'even', 'better', 'only', 'picture', 'scratchiness', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'when', 'producers', 'spliced', 'bit', 'genuine', 'WWII', 'footage', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'very', 'scratchy', '.I', 'do', 'have', 'complaint', 'CBS', 'first', 'three', 'sets', 'had', 'several', 'extras', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'have', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'listing', 'thanking', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'Fifth', 'season', 'different', 'colors', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'put', 'cast', 'pictures', 'them-', 'Fourth', 'did', 'do', 'promo', 'several', 'other', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'sets.I', 'hope', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'lot', 'better']",Hogan's Heroes - The Complete Fifth Season
1020569,A2ILQXJ144UGFJ,B000IHYXIK,"A. Haines ""Bookmark""","[0, 0]","""Hogan's Heroes"" came to TV the year I graduated from high school, so between working in the evenings and going to college, I didn't see it very often, but I thought it was kind of cute.Now, we own the whole series and my husband and I watch an episode every night. We're on our second time through. Most of the storylines follow the same formula, some humanly impossible assignment, and everything turns out okay in the end. Nobody dies, at least not on camera, so they're involved in a good, clean war. It's the characters who make the show so compelling to watch. The heroes are a talented group and they all, except Kinchloe, seem like natural comedians. Even Hogan, although his humor is more dry than the other POWs. I enjoy the subtle touches, like Lebeau's side comments in French. When I can understand them (high school French was a long time ago), they are hilarious. My favorite character is Schultz. He steals every scene he's in. Love that man. My least favorite is Klink. He could use the same script for every show. And he's the only one who received an Emmy award for it.
