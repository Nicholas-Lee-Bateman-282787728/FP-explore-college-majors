364844,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6303217125,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","""Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings"" is the direct-to-video follow-up to Stan Winston'ssemi-classic horror opus. Stuffed with familiar faces from the genre (Andrew Robinson, Linnea Quigley), the film tells the tale of a group of wanna-be rebel teenagers whose penchant for raising Hell comes back to bite them in the butt when they unwittingly unleash the Pumpkinhead demon, who sets out to wreak havoc on the small town with country music and strobe lights in tow.Solid direction from Jeff Burr (""Leatherface - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"") and some decent effects from the KNB crew are much appreciated but can't save this flaccid sequel. The story itself is beyond bland and is essentially a retread of the original, minus the tragedy. Add to that a glut of cardboard characters whose intentions are never clear and a tone that is never quite established, and you have a cheap and forgettable affair that does little to live up to its predecessor. Some cheap thrills await fans of the original who, if they lower their expectations and simply want to see the titular character do his thing, may find this a decent watch, but for the rest, it's best left dead and buried.The DVD, in spite of being a full-screen presentation, sports a 20 minute making-of/retrospective featurette as well as commentary from Jeff Burr, which is certainly more than anyone could ask for a long-forgotten direct-to-video horror flick.",2,"""Blood Wings"" Doesn't Quite Fly.",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1413,"['Pumpkinhead', 'II', 'Blood', 'Wings', 'direct-to-video', 'follow-up', 'Stan', ""Winston'ssemi-classic"", 'horror', 'opus', 'Stuffed', 'familiar', 'genre', 'Andrew', 'Robinson', 'Linnea', 'Quigley', 'film', 'tale', 'group', 'wanna-be', 'rebel', 'teenagers', 'penchant', 'raising', 'Hell', 'back', 'bite', 'butt', 'when', 'unwittingly', 'unleash', 'Pumpkinhead', 'demon', 'who', 'out', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'small', 'town', 'country', 'music', 'strobe', 'lights', 'tow.Solid', 'direction', 'Jeff', 'Burr', 'Leatherface', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'III', 'decent', 'effects', 'KNB', 'crew', 'are', 'much', 'appreciated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'flaccid', 'sequel', 'story', 'bland', 'essentially', 'retread', 'original', 'tragedy', 'Add', 'glut', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'intentions', 'are', 'never', 'clear', 'tone', 'never', 'quite', 'established', 'have', 'cheap', 'forgettable', 'affair', 'little', 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'await', 'fans', 'original', 'who', 'lower', 'expectations', 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'titular', 'character', 'do', 'thing', 'may', 'find', 'decent', 'watch', 'rest', 'best', 'left', 'dead', 'buried.The', 'DVD', 'spite', 'being', 'full-screen', 'presentation', 'sports', '20', 'minute', 'making-of/retrospective', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'Jeff', 'Burr', 'certainly', 'more', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'long-forgotten', 'direct-to-video', 'horror', 'flick']",N/A

amazon.com(where I had gotten PUMPKINHEAD1)and I must say that it was a great seqaul to the best horror movie of all time PUMPKINHEAD.The plot was great and interesting and it really brings you into the movie.This seqaul though could have been alot better and possibly maby could have been better than the first if they had conciderd the following...First you can tell that they didint put to much effort and work into this one as they did the first.I think that they could have made the pumpkinhead look alot more real like he did on the first but this time they had hired a different suit desighner and you can tell that the one they hired is not as talented as the first desighner.They tried to follow the original desighn as best they could but kinda went off track and made the pumpkinhead kinda rubber lookin.Its not that bad but it still looks kinda fake.The acting could have been inproved especialy by the teens and the black female doctor.They also wanted the pumpkinhead to move alot faster so that when he was chasing somone down he wouldent be taking his time like on part 1 but in the procces of making him move alot faster it also made him move more like a human which also lets it look more fake telling you that theres a person inside wearing a costume.But I think that they was just trying to be realistic because on the first he was chasing them down slowly not caring if he got them or not but just killing them for some one else who wants revenge so on part one pumpkinhead is more of a slave but on here you can tell that he really wants to get the job done and not take his time.In this movie a deformed boy named Tommy is killed in the 50s and then the present teens summon him and he then turnes into pumpkinhead and goes after his killers.So in this one for pumpkinhead it is more of a personal revenge thing instead of him killing for somone else.In here the pumpkinhead actually has a personality unlike the one on the first who does not even have a soul.You can see the anger in tommys eyes every time before he kills his victems making the movie alot more interesting than part one.Pumpkinhead2 is also alot more gory than part one and the pumpkinhead deals with his victims alot more brutal in this one.I love this movie and its a great seqaul but still does not compare to the greatest,scariest,most thrilling and realistic movie of all time PUMPKINHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,Great Sequal!!!!!!,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,2532,"['Not', 'long', 'ago', 'watching', 'most', 'favorite', 'horror', 'time', 'PUMPKINHEAD', 'heard', 'was',

364847,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,6303217125,Brian,"[3, 5]","This ill-conceived sequel to Stan Winston's impressive original, while certainly not an altogether ""bad"" film, will almost certainly disappoint those legions of devoted fans seeking more of the same.Director Jeff Burr has totally reinvented the creature's mythology and, as a result, has thrown a rather serious monkey wrench into what followers of the original film may expect. We are no longer faced with a simple demon conjured up to exact revenge for those who have been wronged. Here, the titular fiend arises harboring the soul of a boy who was viciously murdered for his extreme deformity. While I do respect the idea that Burr's heart may very well have been in the right place when he signed on for this project, he still made one crucial error. He approved a screenplay with characters that we, as viewers, never really connect with. Ami Dolenz and all the other teenage actors phone in their performances, reading their lines without any true conviction. The entire production reeks in mediocrity and came across way too saccharine for my tastes. There was no blood or suspense anywhere and, half the time, I felt as though I were watching a ""TV Movie of the Week."" Andrew Robinson does what he can with the role of Town Sheriff, but even his contributions were sadly wasted. And let's not forget George Clinton, Bill's brother. He shows up in a throw-away role as the town Mayor!I really do wish, in all honesty, that I could have given this a better rating. It's not all bad, as I said.

Sure when compare to it's predecessor it is nowhere near a good, but on it's own it's a pretty fun watch. I happen to be a big fan of b horror films and feel Pumpkinhead 2 sits pretty high on my list of favorites in that category. Th eacting is terrible and the plot is all over the place but it's just so entertaining. No matter what you can't have a bad time watching Pumpkinhead tear apart a cast of very unlikeable kids. It won't have you scared but will have you cracking up.For our sequel we start with an annoying group of teens who steal a vile of blood from the old witch from the first film. They wind up accidentally setting her hut on fire and leaving her for dead, but she survives lying in a hospital bed. After this Pumpkinhead is released back into the world to get revenge on the teens and those who tortured him when he was a young kid. Unfortunately you don't get too see as much of the creature as you do in the first one. They show more quick flashes of what he's doing and less of all the action. However a lot of the flashes show some pretty intense kills showing Pumpkinhead is still a force to be reckoned with.To sum it up Pumkinhead 2 is nowhere near as good as the first film but is still very enjoyable in it's own light. There are some plot holes and terrible acting but it's not overwhelming to the point where you can't have a good time with the film. For the person looking for a legitimate great horror film then this one will not rank high on you list. But for the select fans of the laughable b horror genre this one will certainly be worth the watch.

A group of teens torment a deformed little boy, eventually dropping the lad into a well.  Years later another group of teens awaken the lad, only now he has turned into the evil Pumpkinhead.  Murder and mayhem ensue.The two big problems with this movie are that the basic plot shows little imagination and the acting is awful.  Other than that, the movie is pretty good.  Of course, the acting and the plot are the majority of a movie, and the special effects are nothing to write home about, so you have to start wondering whether two stars would have been a better choice.  However, this movie is somewhat redeemed by a ""boo"" factor.  Pumpkinhead appears (or throws bodies about) in a periodically scary way.  Nothing like a monster jumping out from behind a building to give you a jump.""Pumpkinhead 2"" is not an awful movie.  The movie does provide a few minor chills.  However, the choice of the movie name is unfortunate.  Other than the general appearance of the creature, reinventing the mythology is confusing for those of us that liked the first movie.  Perhaps they should have called it ""Pumpkinhead:  Resurrection,"" and explained that Pumpkinhead creatures came from certain circumstances that are now repeating for the second time.  Oh well.

Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant ""sequel"".

As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a ""so bad it's good"" B flick.

The original film had Lance Henriksen to season the pot, along with a pretty neat idea, some tear jerking drama, clever Stan Winston creature effects, and a semi believable turn about. Here we're  greeted with overdone melodrama, relatively poor acting, no plot at all, senseless slaughter that doesn't fit in as well, a creature that is there just to cash in on a sequel, and an ending that's just not that complete.The film starts out in a black and white type gig, showing a deformed child, Tommy, being picked on and ultimately accidentally killed by some vicious bullying teenage youths. The story then jumps - a lot - to a sheriff and his daughter, Amy, driving into the small town. The sheriff is tired of the big city crime life and is looking forward to some peace and tranquility. Does this sound familiar yet? The daughter, not the least bit happy about being toted from her glitzy life to Hicksville, soon falls in with the wrong crowd. (Have we ever seen this in a movie either?) Soon the crowd gets into black magic of all things (!)  Yep, that's the classic thing 'bad kids' do. They resurrect a dead body which just happens to be poor, abused Tommy. Soon thereafter 'Pumpkinhead' has risen and is offing people in a violent - and somewhat fun, I hate to admit - manner.I won't spoil the details of why Pumpkinhead is killing who he is or the ultimate finale, as...well, I'm sure by just reading the above most won't terribly interested. Let's just say it doesn't fit in as well as the first and that the products/directors obviously had to try hard and induce tears and 'logic' just to bring a sequel to the plate.The creature looks amazing as always, but he's just not as frightening. In the first effective lighting and a creepy atmosphere were his friend. Here? He stands out like a sore thumb. One of the deaths in particular didn't sit well with me. A man ( I won't say who in case of spoiling it for people actually wanting to watch the film) walks into a room painted with symbols and is then slaughtered. How could the demon paint these symbols? Doesn't fit. Also, what is with the annoying strobe light thingey when Pumpkinhead starts stalking for a kill??One of the major annoyances is the sheriff's consultant, the coroner. She's much too ominous, over dramatic (VERY), and ridiculous. She's always there, too, like an annoying bug you just can't shake off no matter what you do. If Pumpkinhead would have killed her outright, I would have given this film at least one more star, truly.The acting isn't award winning by far but it's not all bad. The good ol' sheriff is played by Andrew Robinson, who horror fans will remember as Hellraiser/Frank fodder. He does his job but you can't expect much from the role handed to him. Ami Dolenz is Jenny, the teenage girl who wants to fit in yet is a goody two shoes at heart. She's pretty too look at, and her acting is competent enough, but here she basically stank. I could say almost the same thing about her when she starred in Witchboard 2 as well. Need to stay away from those cheesy horror sequels, Ami. (She's actually good in comedies such as Can't buy me love and She's out of control). Soleil Moon Frye, who starred in Punky Brewster, is one of the pesky teens. Fortunately our eyes can feast on a small cameo with Kane Hodder being killed. The last possible treat for some is a very brief appearance from horror scream queen Linnea Quigley - topless no less.Overall Pumpkinhead 2 is simply slatter fun. It's a slasher movie in every possible way - low grade acting, virtually zero plot or style, silly music, even sillier character motivations, see through turn outs, and senseless kills. The first one was a slasher as well, yet it still had heart and reasoning of some sort. Here we just get the original name being whored for more dough. Hey, the flick wasn't horrible - I actually kept watching it, didn't I? If the coroner had been left out of the game, I would have stayed a more enthused player. As it stands though, it's worth seeing once only if you were a major fan of the original.",2,Mediocre times,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4177,"['first', 'Pumpkinhead', 'managed', 'nab', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'fan', 'base', 'steady', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'season', 'pot', 'pretty', 'neat', 'idea', 'tear', 'jerking', 'drama', 'clever', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'creature', 'effects', 'semi', 'believable', 'turn', 'Here', ""'re"", 'greeted', 'overdone', 'melodrama', 'relatively', 'poor', 'acting', 'plot', 'senseless', 'slaughter', ""n't"", 'fit', 'as', 'well', 'creature', 'there', 'just', 'cash', 'sequel', 'ending', 'just', 'not', 'complete.The', 'film', 'out', 'black', 'white', 'type', 'gig', 'showing', 'deformed', 'child', 'Tommy', 'being', 'picked', 'ultimately', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'vicious', 'bullying', 'teenage', 'youths', 'story', 'then', 'lot', 'sheriff', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'driving', 'small', 'town', 'sheriff', 'tired', 'big', 'city', 'crime', 'life', 'looking', 'forward', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'sound', 'familiar', 'yet', 'daughter', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'happy', 'being', 'toted', 'glitzy', 'life', 'Hicksville', 'soon', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'either', 'Soon', 'crowd', 'black', 'magic', 'things', 'Yep', 'classic', 'thing', 'kids', 'do', 'resurrect', 'dead', 'body', 'just', 'be', 'poor', 'abused', 'Tommy', 'Soon', 'thereafter', ""'Pumpkinhead"", 'risen', 'offing', 'people', 'violent', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'hate', 'admit', 'manner.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'details', 'why', 'Pumpkinhead', 'killing', 'who', 'ultimate', 'finale', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'reading', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'interested', 'Let', 'just', 'say', ""n't"", 'fit', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'products/directors', 'obviously', 'had', 'try', 'hard', 'induce', 'tears', ""'logic"", 'just', 'bring', 'sequel', 'plate.The', 'creature', 'amazing', 'always', 'just', 'not', 'frightening', 'first', 'effective', 'lighting', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'were', 'friend', 'Here', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'One', 'deaths', 'particular', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'man', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'case', 'spoiling', 'people', 'actually', 'wanting', 'watch', 'film', 'room', 'painted', 'symbols', 'then', 'slaughtered', 'How', 'could', 'demon', 'paint', 'symbols', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Also', 'what', 'annoying', 'strobe', 'light', 'thingey', 'when', 'Pumpkinhead', 'stalking', 'kill', 'One', 'major', 'annoyances', 'sheriff', 'consultant', 'coroner', 'much', 'too', 'ominous', 'dramatic', 'VERY', 'ridiculous', 'always', 'there', 'too', 'annoying', 'bug', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'Pumpkinhead', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'outright', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'truly.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'award', 'winning', 'far', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'ol', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Andrew', 'Robinson', 'who', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'remember', 'Hellraiser/Frank', 'fodder', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'role', 'handed', 'Ami', 'Dolenz', 'Jenny', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'fit', 'yet', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'heart', 'pretty', 'too', 'look', 'acting', 'competent', 'enough', 'here', 'basically', 'stank', 'could', 'say', 'almost', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'starred', 'Witchboard', '2', 'as', 'well', 'Need', 'stay', 'away', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'sequels', 'Ami', 'actually', 'good', 'comedies', 'such', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'love', 'control', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'who', 'starred', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'one', 'pesky', 'teens', 'Fortunately', 'eyes', 'can', 'feast', 'small', 'cameo', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'being', 'killed', 'last', 'possible', 'treat', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'horror', 'scream', 'queen', 'Linnea', 'Quigley', 'topless', 'less.Overall', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'simply', 'slatter', 'fun', 'slasher', 'movie', 'possible', 'way', 'low', 'grade', 'acting', 'virtually', 'zero', 'plot', 'style', 'silly', 'music', 'even', 'sillier', 'character', 'motivations', 'see', 'turn', 'outs', 'senseless', 'kills', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'slasher', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'had', 'heart', 'reasoning', 'sort', 'Here', 'just', 'get', 'original', 'name', 'being', 'whored', 'more', 'dough', 'Hey', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'actually', 'kept', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'coroner', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'game', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'more', 'enthused', 'player', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'only', 'were', 'major', 'fan', 'original']",N/A

364879,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6303217125,Sid the Elf,"[4, 6]","We, Sid the Elf, made a great choice for this week's B extraveganza. We decided on a horror B from that golden age for the genre. Pumpkinhead 2 was made in 1994. Remember, this was after Freddy and Jason lost their appeal, before the awful Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer movies, and before the terrible The Ring ripoffs we're forced to deal with now. This was the era when you had to have a killer or monster, a cop or sherrif, and a group of rowdy teens who are the killer/monster's targets. Bing, bang, boom--instant horror movie. This might sound terrible, but it wasn't. These movies are the bedrock of horror B. Some of them are even incredibly enjoyable, like Pumpkinhead 2. Although, is it possible to not enjoy a movie when it features the fat kid from Charles in Charge, the guy who was obsessed with Donna Martin and took over the CU tv station in 90210, and Bill Clinton's brother? The answer of course is no it is impossible to not enjoy such a movie.The plot of Pumpkinhead 2 is as simple as it is ridiculous. After being summoned through an evil spell by Punky Bruster(seriously), Pumpkinhead takes over the body of a freak who was killed 30 years prior. The freak was killed by an unfathomably fruity gang called The Red Wings. Perfect. The best part about these guys is that we think they were supposed to come off as tough. And let's just say that they fell short. The son of one of the Red Wings(it's making you chuckle a little everytime isn't it?)ended up being Danny, aka the guy from 90210. So now Pumpkinhead is after him and his freinds Punky Brewster, the fat kid from Charles in Charge, Booger from He Got Game, and the Sheriff's daughter. How could they have not casted Punky Brewster? She was one of the writers of the film and her outstanding performance in that Saved By the Bell episode put her right over the top. Just a tour-de-force cast. And it included a cameo by Roger Clinton. Yeah, the degenerate coke dealing DUI happy half-brother of President Bill Clinton. That adds a star right there. And how does this guy not have a reality show? It would be immensely entertaining to watch this guy call his agent to check for incoming scripts, call his brother to borrow money, then contimplate swallowing a bottle of pills everyday. Then what about the times when he has to interact with Hillary? See? The posibilities are endless.So, Sid's theory on the reason for Pumpkinhead's barrage of killings is that everyone kept screaming at him. Yeah, he looked like a dinosaur of some sort, but yelling in his face really couldn't have helped the situation. The best was when that bald hillbilly screamed at Pumpkinhead, and they felt the need to show his ugly face for like 15 seconds. I think everyone watching was thinking ""Damn, shut this old hick up."" And you couldn't even finish the thought because Pumpkinhead backhanded the guy so freakin hard. The guy went right through a haystack or something. By far, the best moment of the movie. It was absolutely hysterical. It got rewound 3 times, a record bested only by the famous hicks being thrown off the truck scene in Halloween 4. Eventually, the sherrif figures out that the freak is Pumpkinhead because of the markings he leaves after he ices someone. They look like lesbian seagulls, but in red, or blood wings. Get it? Oh, boy! The sheriff actually met the freak when he was a nerdy kid himself, so I guess they had some kind of rapport. This led to the improbable scene in which the sherrif reasons with Pumpkinhead, a 7 1/2 foot creature that looks kind of like a dinosaur. But I'm sure he has wonderful communication skills.If you're a fan of B horror, Pumpkinhead 2 was made for you. It has everything you could want, well almost. It has no story, terrible acting by d-list(at the height of their fame) actors and awful special effects. This is clearly illustrated when a certain character gets decapitated by Pumpkinhead.

364883,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,6303217125,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 1]","An aggressively average horror film, mildly enjoyable but forgettable, its few smallish rises matched by some minor dips.  What distinguishes Pumpkinhead 2 is its journeyman cast of minor ""names.""  No real stars, just the B-list and Z-list.  But ... so many of them!Click any cast member at the Internet Movie Database and a ream of credits follow.  Part of the fun of watching Pumpkinhead 2 is trying to remember where you've seen this or that familiar face before.  I knew I'd recognized the sheriff from somewhere.  Turns out he appeared in Hellraiser -- though I confess, I probably recognized him from the ABC soap, Ryan's Hope, which I watched for about a year in the 1970s.Most of Pumpkinhead 2's cast has soap credits, daytime and nighttime.  Dallas fans will recognize Steve Kanaly, who plays a corrupt judge in Pumpkinhead 2.  Soleil Moon Frye (""Punky Brewster"") is a surly teen.  Roger Clinton (brother of Bill) has a few lines as the mayor.  Z-starlet Linnea Quigley (whose minor cult following baffles me) has a few lines during her topless cameo.Much of this ""name cast"" only has a few lines.  Just enough to grant some bragging rights.  The video box brags: ""Featuring Cameos From Horror's Hottest Cult Faves!  KANE HOLDER as Hockeymask in Friday The 13th Part VIII.  R.A. MIHAILOFF as Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.""I didn't even know that Kane played ""Hockeymask"" in Friday The 13th Part VIII, much less that he was one of ""Horror's Hottest Cult Faves!""But, peruse this cast and you may discover some of your own personal favorites.  Mine is Caren Kaye.  Back when I was a teen in the 1970s, I'd predicted Kaye would soon be big.  It was the Age Of Farrah, and Kaye had that layered blond ""look.""  She appeared in several TV pilots but, defying all odds, they all flopped.  Her longest regular gig (as best I recall) was on Celebrity Charades, a syndicated game show, sort of a cross between The Gong Show and The Hollywood Squares.  That lasted a few months.  Kaye was a recurring TV guest star in the 1980s (Fantasy Island,  Love Boat, New Love American Style).  She is probably best known as the ""older woman"" in My Tutor, although horror fans might know her from 1990's Satan's Princess.But aside from its cast from Memory Lane, what's Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings about?As the title implies, the film is an (unnecessary) sequel to the respectable but unremarkable Pumpkinhead (the object of another minor cult following that baffles me).  Both films feature a demon named Pumpkinhead, the stuff of mountain lore (Appalachian, I suppose).  If someone wrongs you, you can summon Pumpkinhead to take vengeance.  But afterwards, Pumpkinhead goes on a killing spree, attacking innocents, and you'll be damned for eternity.  Something like that.The plot is jerrybuilt from the flotsam and jetsam of a hundred mediocre horror films.  There is the shunned freak living in the woods.  There are fratboy bullies.  The ""prank that goes wrong.""  The mountain witch in a cabin.  The small town legend.  The respectable town elders ""with a dark secret in their past.""  The ""bad girl"" daughter who rebels against her straight-laced folks.  The drunken teens.  The sex in inappropriate public places.  The redneck vigilantes in pickup trucks.  And against this rustic tableau, there is Pumpkinhead, trouncing about and ripping off everyone's heads.I'll give the film points for this: not all its gun-crazed redneck vigilantes are white.  And director Jeff Burr does create a few nice visuals.  Atmospheric sepia shots to evoke the 1950s.  Colorfully glowing mist to convey demonic magic.  The gore is generous and well-done.  Pumpkinhead's hands and feet are stiff and rubbery, but one can live with it.  Horror films have a long tradition of ""rubber suit monsters.""More problematic is the witch's pointless makeup.  One wonders ... why?  I'm guessing Burr wanted the witch to appear old.  Well, why not just cast an old woman?  Maybe he did, but we can't see it.  The actress playing the witch is heavily layered with ""age makeup,"" making her indiscernible.  Her face looks like a plaster mask.  Maybe Burr wanted the witch to look really, really old.  She doesn't.  She looks really, really weird.Pumpkinhead 2 is an enjoyable but unremarkable gorefest, as watchable as a hundred other horror films out there.  And if you get bored between killings, there are plenty of minor ""names"" to keep you playing ""Where have I seen him before?""",3,"average, but enjoyable horror",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,4454,"['aggressively', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'forgettable', 'few', 'smallish', 'rises', 'matched', 'minor', 'dips', 'What', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'journeyman', 'cast', 'minor', 'names', 'real', 'stars', 'just', 'B-list', 'Z-list', 'so', 'many', 'Click', 'cast', 'member', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'ream', 'credits', 'follow', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'trying', 'remember', 'where', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'familiar', 'face', 'knew', ""'d"", 'recognized', 'sheriff', 'somewhere', 'out', 'appeared', 'Hellraiser', 'confess', 'probably', 'recognized', 'ABC', 'soap', 'Ryan', 'Hope', 'watched', 'year', '1970s.Most', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'cast', 'soap', 'credits', 'daytime', 'nighttime', 'Dallas', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Steve', 'Kanaly', 'who', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'Soleil', 'Moon', 'Frye', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'surly', 'teen', 'Roger', 'Clinton', 'brother', 'Bill', 'few', 'lines', 'mayor', 'Z-starlet', 'Linnea', 'Quigley', 'minor', 'cult', 'following', 'baffles', 'few', 'lines', 'topless', 'cameo.Much', 'name', 'cast', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'Just', 'enough', 'grant', 'bragging', 'rights', 'video', 'box', 'brags', 'Featuring', 'Cameos', 'From', 'Horror', 'Hottest', 'Cult', 'Faves', 'KANE', 'HOLDER', 'Hockeymask', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', 'VIII', 'R.A.', 'MIHAILOFF', 'Leatherface', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'III', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Kane', 'played', 'Hockeymask', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', 'VIII', 'much', 'less', 'was', 'one', 'Horror', 'Hottest', 'Cult', 'Faves', 'cast', 'may', 'discover', 'own', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Mine', 'Caren', 'Kaye', 'Back', 'when', 'was', 'teen', '1970s', ""'d"", 'predicted', 'Kaye', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'big', 'was', 'Age', 'Farrah', 'Kaye', 'had', 'layered', 'blond', 'look', 'appeared', 'several', 'TV', 'pilots', 'defying', 'odds', 'flopped', 'longest', 'regular', 'gig', 'best', 'recall', 'was', 'Celebrity', 'Charades', 'syndicated', 'game', 'show', 'sort', 'cross', 'Gong', 'Show', 'Hollywood', 'Squares', 'lasted', 'few', 'months', 'Kaye', 'was', 'recurring', 'TV', 'guest', 'star', '1980s', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'Love', 'Boat', 'New', 'Love', 'American', 'Style', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'older', 'woman', 'My', 'Tutor', 'horror', 'fans', 'might', 'know', '1990', 'Satan', 'Princess.But', 'aside', 'cast', 'Memory', 'Lane', 'what', 'Pumpkinhead', '2', 'Blood', 'Wings', 'about', 'title', 'implies', 'film', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', 'respectable', 'unremarkable', 'Pumpkinhead', 'object', 'minor', 'cult', 'following', 'baffles', 'films', 'feature', 'demon', 'named', 'Pumpkinhead', 'stuff', 'mountain', 'lore', 'Appalachian', 'suppose', 'someone', 'wrongs', 'can', 'summon', 'Pumpkinhead', 'take', 'vengeance', 'afterwards', 'Pumpkinhead', 'killing', 'spree', 'attacking', 'innocents', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'eternity', 'Something', 'that.The', 'plot', 'jerrybuilt', 'flotsam', 'jetsam', 'hundred', 'mediocre', 'horror', 'films', 'shunned', 'freak', 'living', 'woods', 'are', 'fratboy', 'bullies', 'prank', 'wrong', 'mountain', 'witch', 'cabin', 'small', 'town', 'legend', 'respectable', 'town', 'elders', 'dark', 'secret', 'past', 'bad', 'girl', 'daughter', 'who', 'straight-laced', 'folks', 'drunken', 'teens', 'sex', 'inappropriate', 'public', 'places', 'redneck', 'pickup', 'trucks', 'rustic', 'tableau', 'Pumpkinhead', 'trouncing', 'ripping', 'off', 'everyone', 'heads.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'film', 'points', 'not', 'gun-crazed', 'redneck', 'vigilantes', 'are', 'white', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Burr', 'create', 'few', 'nice', 'visuals', 'Atmospheric', 'sepia', 'shots', 'evoke', '1950s', 'Colorfully', 'glowing', 'mist', 'convey', 'demonic', 'magic', 'gore', 'generous', 'well-done', 'Pumpkinhead', 'hands', 'feet', 'are', 'stiff', 'rubbery', 'one', 'can', 'live', 'Horror', 'films', 'have', 'long', 'tradition', 'rubber', 'suit', 'monsters', 'More', 'problematic', 'witch', 'pointless', 'makeup', 'One', 'wonders', 'why', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Burr', 'wanted', 'witch', 'appear', 'old', 'Well', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'cast', 'old', 'woman', 'Maybe', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'actress', 'playing', 'witch', 'heavily', 'layered', 'age', 'makeup', 'making', 'indiscernible', 'face', 'plaster', 'mask', 'Maybe', 'Burr', 'wanted', 'witch', 'look', 'really', 'really', 'old', ""n't"", 'really', 'really', 'weird.Pumpkinhead', '2', 'enjoyable', 'unremarkable', 'gorefest', 'as', 'watchable', 'hundred', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'bored', 'killings', 'are', 'plenty', 'minor', 'names', 'keep', 'playing', 'Where', 'have', 'seen']",N/A
