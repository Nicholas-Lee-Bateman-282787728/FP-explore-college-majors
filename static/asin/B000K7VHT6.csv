When i first saw this movie , i didn't care for it. Now i think it is funnier.  The quality of film is fine , but to be honest , when i saw it before, i was watching a old cable hook up , with low quality. The acting is funny , and i like the situations he gets into. It's a little bit more than i would show a young child , but compared to todays ""comedies"" , it is tame.Just funny how the movie is aged , and got better, or is it just me.? By the way , i am speaking of the JERK, the other 2 movies are pretty good to:)",5,funny that,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,646,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'anybody', 'else', 'there', 'feel', 'comedies', 'past', 'are', 'better', 'age', 'When', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Now', 'think', 'funnier', 'quality', 'film', 'fine', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'old', 'cable', 'hook', 'up', 'low', 'quality', 'acting', 'funny', 'i', 'situations', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'i', 'would', 'show', 'young', 'child', 'compared', 'todays', 'comedies', 'tame.Just', 'funny', 'how', 'movie', 'aged', 'got', 'better', 'just', 'me.', 'way', 'i', 'am', 'speaking', 'JERK', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good']",Steve Martin: The Wild and Crazy Comedy Collection

We have:- **** Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (with its use of cameos from other films and the infamous ""Friends and Enemies of Carlotta"" list),- ***** The Jerk (a cult classic... ""He hates cans!), and- *** The Lonely Guy ( the sleeper... literally something in between the comedy of The Jerk and ""seriousness"" of Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid).The weaker movie of the three is The Lonely Guy, a movie of the Neil Simon play, but if you consider it a freebie in this collection, there's no complaint!",5,A real bargain for the Steven Martin aficionado...,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,787,"['five', 'star', 'rating', 'three', 'DVDs', 'bargain', 'different', 'rating', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'movie.In', 'collection', 'three', 'movies', 'done', 'early', 'acting', 'career', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'cast', 'roles', 'taking', 'advantage', 'unique', 'forms', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'sophistication', 'have', '****', 'Dead', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wear', 'Plaid', 'use', 'cameos', 'other', 'films', 'infamous', 'Friends', 'Enemies', 'Carlotta', 'list', 'Jerk', 'cult', 'classic', 'cans', 'and-', 'Lonely', 'Guy', 'sleeper', 'literally', 'something', 'comedy', 'Jerk', 'seriousness', 'Dead', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wear', 'Plaid', '.The', 'weaker', 'movie', 'three', 'Lonely', 'Guy', 'movie', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'play', 'consider', 'freebie', 'collection', 'complaint']",Steve Martin: The Wild and Crazy Comedy Collection
