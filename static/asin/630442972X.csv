420876,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,630442972X,AbeStreet,"[8, 10]","I first saw this film about 20 years ago as a teenager and I still find it as enjoyable now as I did then. It is the tale of seven gunfighters who are hired by a poor Mexican farming community to help drive off the bandits who periodically show up and steal the communities food and goods. Of the Magnificent Seven most of the screen time is given to Chris (Brynner), Vin (McQueen) and Chico (Bucholz). While no details are given about the individual pasts of the Magnificent Seven it is fairly clear what there pasts may have been.1. Chris: A leader, perhaps a former soldier, who has encountered danger before and gained a degree of mastery over his emotions in dangerous situation.2. Vin: A capable man with a gun, perhaps a one time cowboy. He seems to be comfortable working as a loner but clearly would like to one day settle down.3. Chico: The youngest of the Seven and most inexperienced. He wants to shed his farming past and attempts through acts of bravado to persuade others and himself that he is a gunfighter at heart.4. Bernardo (Bronson): A strong solitary man that in many ways resembles Chris although not displaying the desire to lead. In many ways he is the most interesting character. He has made quite a bit of money in the past even though he is now broke. The attention he gives to the local village children and the gift he gives a village girl hint at the idea that while he is good at gunfighting he knows that it is a good family life that is important.5. Lee (Vaughn): The most difficult character to relate to. He appears to be a gunman who in the past was cocky, arrogant and self assured but now after experiencing life on the run now doubts himself. He wants to do the right thing but finds it difficult to step up to the plate when it's his turn.6. Britt (Coburn): A loner who is unequaled in a gun or knife fight. A man whose motives remain his own.7. Harry (Dexter): A good man to have in a fight but one who lets greed cloud his every decision. It would seem that Harry is one of those individuals who is always one step away from gaining riches but somehow never gains them.The leader of the bandits is Calvera (Walsh) who is not an unlikeable fellow. He appears to believe that it is his job to steal so that he can support himself and his men. For him it is only a job, not unlike the farmers who work the land to provide for their families. He has what can almost be describes as a code of ethics for those who make their living with guns. This code of ethics is evident in the way he treats the Magnificent Seven towards the end of the film. However, given the films ending, this code does not seem to be shared by the Magnificent SevenWhile many people may view this film as a western action film I think there is quite a bit of underlying humanity and character depth woven into the story. It is these underlying characteristics that distinguish it from the average western action flick and have helped to make this film as popular as it is.The DVD offers what every DVD should, a commentary with both some of the actors and some of the production staff.  A behind the scenes documentary and two trailers.  While some may find the picture not that great I found it be a great improvement over the VHS widescreen version I purchased earlier on VHS.  Lastly,during the past 7 months 3 more of the Magnifecent Seven have died.  The only two remaining are Robert Vaughn (Lee) and Charles Bronson (Bernardo).  Eli Walsh (Calvera) is also still alive.  Fans of both the Magnifect Seven and James Coburn, who died last November, will appreciate his participation in the documentary and commentary.",5,They were only 7 but they fought like 700!,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,3634,"['first', 'saw', 'film', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'teenager', 'still', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'did', 'then', 'tale', 'seven', 'gunfighters', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'farming', 'community', 'help', 'drive', 'off', 'bandits', 'who', 'periodically', 'show', 'up', 'steal', 'communities', 'food', 'goods', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Chris', 'Brynner', 'Vin', 'McQueen', 'Chico', 'Bucholz', 'details', 'are', 'given', 'individual', 'pasts', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'fairly', 'clear', 'what', 'pasts', 'may', 'have', 'been.1', 'Chris', 'leader', 'perhaps', 'former', 'soldier', 'who', 'encountered', 'danger', 'gained', 'degree', 'mastery', 'emotions', 'dangerous', 'situation.2', 'Vin', 'capable', 'man', 'gun', 'perhaps', 'one', 'time', 'cowboy', 'be', 'comfortable', 'working', 'loner', 'clearly', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'day', 'settle', 'down.3', 'Chico', 'youngest', 'Seven', 'most', 'inexperienced', 'shed', 'farming', 'past', 'attempts', 'acts', 'bravado', 'persuade', 'others', 'gunfighter', 'heart.4', 'Bernardo', 'Bronson', 'strong', 'solitary', 'man', 'many', 'ways', 'resembles', 'Chris', 'not', 'displaying', 'desire', 'lead', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'made', 'quite', 'bit', 'money', 'past', 'even', 'now', 'broke', 'attention', 'local', 'village', 'children', 'gift', 'village', 'girl', 'hint', 'idea', 'good', 'gunfighting', 'good', 'family', 'life', 'important.5', 'Lee', 'Vaughn', 'most', 'difficult', 'character', 'relate', 'be', 'gunman', 'who', 'past', 'was', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'self', 'assured', 'now', 'experiencing', 'life', 'run', 'now', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'difficult', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'when', 'turn.6', 'Britt', 'Coburn', 'loner', 'who', 'unequaled', 'gun', 'knife', 'fight', 'man', 'motives', 'remain', 'own.7', 'Harry', 'Dexter', 'good', 'man', 'have', 'fight', 'one', 'who', 'greed', 'cloud', 'decision', 'would', 'seem', 'Harry', 'one', 'individuals', 'who', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'gaining', 'riches', 'somehow', 'never', 'gains', 'them.The', 'leader', 'bandits', 'Calvera', 'Walsh', 'who', 'not', 'unlikeable', 'fellow', 'believe', 'job', 'steal', 'so', 'can', 'support', 'men', 'only', 'job', 'not', 'farmers', 'who', 'work', 'land', 'provide', 'families', 'what', 'can', 'almost', 'be', 'describes', 'code', 'ethics', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'guns', 'code', 'ethics', 'evident', 'way', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'However', 'given', 'films', 'ending', 'code', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'shared', 'Magnificent', 'SevenWhile', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'view', 'film', 'western', 'action', 'film', 'think', 'quite', 'bit', 'underlying', 'humanity', 'character', 'depth', 'woven', 'story', 'underlying', 'characteristics', 'distinguish', 'average', 'western', 'action', 'flick', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'popular', 'DVD', 'what', 'DVD', 'should', 'commentary', 'actors', 'production', 'staff', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'two', 'trailers', 'may', 'find', 'picture', 'not', 'great', 'found', 'be', 'great', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'widescreen', 'version', 'purchased', 'earlier', 'VHS', 'Lastly', 'past', '7', 'months', '3', 'more', 'Magnifecent', 'Seven', 'have', 'died', 'only', 'two', 'remaining', 'are', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Lee', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Bernardo', 'Eli', 'Walsh', 'Calvera', 'also', 'still', 'alive', 'Fans', 'Magnifect', 'Seven', 'James', 'Coburn', 'who', 'died', 'last', 'November', 'will', 'appreciate', 'participation', 'documentary', 'commentary']",The Magnificent Seven VHS
420877,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630442972X,Acute Observer,"[2, 9]","This is a parable about people who are oppressed and seek their liberation from an organized gang. They consult an older bearded man, who tells them to get arms from across the border (where people were free to keep and bear arms). The three ambassadors wind up hiring a team of experienced gunmen to defend their town against the recurring raiders. These seven free lancers work to educate and train the townsmen in the use of firearms and fortifications. Si vis pacem parabellum.When the raiders return these gunmen and the villagers are able to drive them away. But the raiders don't give up easily, and return for a sneak attack. The film shows the characters of the gunmen and the villagers during the lull between attacks. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But what of the gunmen? They live a lonely life and have a dim future; they can't settle down. The gang of raiders won't go away because they are desperate for food; they are worse off but even more dangerous. There is a surprise when the raiders capture the town and turn the tables. The message seems to be that the enemies of yesterday can become the allies of today.One gunman says true bravery is working and raising a family, not roaming for adventure. [A rebuke of military forces?] After being forced to leave, the free lancers decide to return to avenge their loss.At first their surprise attack succeeds, but the greater force against them begins to tell. The mass uprising of the people, with clubs, shovels, and machetes, puts an end to most of the raiders. When the fighting is over, the survivors ride away. The farmers continue to work the land in an endless cycle of planting, weeding, and harvesting. There is a lot of philosophy in this action film, even if the audience doesn't recognize it.

420878,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,630442972X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 24]","It is a hard order to fill if you want to reinvision Akira Kurosawa set within an American western using a hodgepodge of ethnic actors.  Not only are you attempting to recreate the same symbolic references and deep moral elements of an already established cult classic, but there are so many other outside elements that may be harder to control than simply samurai's saving a small village.  None the less, director John Sturges tried, and the final result was the abysmal ""The Magnificent Seven"".  Not to plot my course to early, but being a large fan of Kurosawa's masterpiece, I had to put that aside and see this film for what it was - what Sturges envisioned - instead of just making comparison after comparison.  With sloppy characters, lacking detail, American-ized natives, and a grossly unoriginal villain - this 1960 classic is only memorable for a couple of key performances and an energetic score.  Outside of that, Sturges uttered blasphemy on Kurosawa's work.Again, I said I wouldn't compare the two works - so every attempt will be made not to.  There were high hopes for ""The Magnificent Seven"", a family favorite film that has somehow slipped through my viewing time, but the moment this film began my attention began to fade.  With a weak opening, and a lackluster retrieval of heroes to protect the village, ""The Magnificent Seven"" came out of the gates with a mere gallop, and eventually didn't even finish the race.  As mentioned, our villain has these long monologues of corruption and greed, but when it comes down to it, Calvera didn't have the true evil gene.  He was corrupt, but it was only skin deep.  Outside of the typical ransacking of small villages, his character demonstrated no true evil - albeit with a PG rating, what could he do - but I don't believe Calvera could strike fear in any child today.  Eli Wallach is to blame for this.  Yet, he wasn't the only one dragging his feet.  This film was bombarded by lackluster acting.  Yul Brynner, the obvious lead, seemed to sputter his lines without a moment of emotion or spirit.  His pathetic portrayal of Chris Adams, the main cowboy hired to protect, fell flat and was boring to the average viewer.  That same description could also be used for most of those that he recruited (what is the saying, flies attract flies?), sans Steve McQueen.  As a fan of McQueen's work, I was impressed by the way he picked up the lacking flag of the others.  While he didn't provide much to each scene, he was interesting to watch, obviously caring more about the overall performance than Brynner did.  Unlike Kurosawa's epic, this didn't focus as much on the men of the mission, just that they could be there to attack whoever descended onto the village.  There was no individual character development, and when there was (see: Robert Vaughn's nightmare) it was rushed and ill-focused.  Whereas in ""Samurai"" we felt something for each of the heroes, in this - nobody seemed to have the courage to stand forward and introduce themselves to us.I must admit - this film was boring.  From the introduction, to the recruiting, all the way to the repeat battle - ""The Magnificent Seven"" provided little-to-no entertainment.  With no character to stand behind, it was left up to the action to drive the focus, but alas, this seemed to fall short as well.  I can agree that there were some decent moments that spoke for the western genre, but nothing challenging.  Evil riders would ride in, gunshots would smoke, people would fall, and finally there would be celebration.  Thinking about it now, it felt as if Sturges was providing us a cheapened Cliff-Notes version of the original tale.  With a running time of a mere 128 minutes, there is no way you could capture the intensity and drama behind Kurosawa's original 203 minute epic.  Again, not to compare side by side - but what made the original work was the characters, the story, the intensity that Kurosawa was able to push through your television set.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" felt like a rushed Hollywood project that had big stars, but no heart.Overall, I really wanted to like this film.  The cast itself sells this movie, but as a viewer of cinema, it just seemed like a poorly constructed feature.  Hollywood was attempting to make a dime on Kurosawa's original idea, and it failed.  I cannot watch this movie again, nor would I.  The acting is atrocious, the story is choppy, and there was no real threat.  The idea that these villagers could survive year after year of this attack forced me to believe that perhaps Calvera wasn't robbing them blind.  We weren't given enough history of the violence prior to the introduction of our heroes.  This just felt rushed from the beginning, but remained dull after seeing the sheer brilliance of ""Seven Samurai"".  Watch this, if you must, for the music and McQueen, everything else is pure rubbish.Grade: *  out of *****",2,"Seven Samurai, this film is not...",1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,4892,"['hard', 'order',

At the end of their tether, the villagers pool their meager resources in the hope that they can cross the border and buy some guns to defend themselves. Instead, they wind up with seven hired gunmen.THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a Hollywood classic and arguably the best movie to come out of the western genre. Beneath the struggle of ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys"" are deeper issues involving the relationship of the gunmen to the poor villagers they undertake to defend and the motivations of the gunmen themselves. Beyond the story itself, the characters are played by an all-star cast, the script is littered with classic one-liners, the color and scenery are brilliant, and the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of filmdom's most memorable.

Seeing it again, I feel my opinion of it has tremendously improved. I look for the acting as part of my criteria. Most did well, but it's really Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, and Horst Buchholz who stood out the most. Without a question, Yul Brynner is the undisputed leader of the ensemble. He has such a quiet commanding presence, and he really sets the tone of the film. Sorry, Steve...you lost. Charles Bronson is very likeable and personable, and the relationship he has with the three Mexican boys is touching. The best scene of the film goes to him when he talks about definition of responsibility after hearing what cowards their fathers were. Finally, not much of credit is given to Horst Buchholz who is the true star of the show. He is charming and funny in an affable way. He surely wears his heart on his sleeve. Many Western pictures are more or less the same: bandits accost a flock of people and the good guys come to their rescue and defeat the bandits. That's why I had a lowered opinion of The Magnificent Seven the first time around. Truly, it's somewhat the same as The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. However, I didn't realize that The Magnificent Seven predates them by nine years and probably set the tone for others to follow. Now, I have seen The Seven Samurai twice, and I find it an overlong, boring film. The Magnificent Seven is a nice substitute of it for me. All in all, if I want to see The Magnificent Seven again, it's pretty much because of Yul Brynner.",5,I Prefer This Over The Seven Samurai.,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,1631,"['Viewed', '12/03', '4/14Rate', '94/14', 'rated', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', '4', 'last', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'picture', 'Seeing', 'again', 'feel', 'opinion', 'tremendously', 'improved', 'look', 'acting', 'part', 'criteria', 'Most', 'did', 'well', 'really', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'who', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'question', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'undisputed', 'leader', 'ensemble', 'quiet', 'commanding', 'presence', 'really', 'tone', 'film', 'Sorry', 'Steve', 'lost', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'very', 'likeable', 'personable', 'relationship', 'three', 'Mexican', 'boys', 'touching', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'definition', 'responsibility', 'hearing', 'what', 'cowards', 'fathers', 'were', 'Finally', 'not', 'much', 'credit', 'given', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'who', 'true', 'star', 'show', 'charming', 'funny', 'affable', 'way', 'surely', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'Many', 'Western', 'pictures', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'bandits', 'accost', 'flock', 'people', 'good', 'guys', 'come', 'rescue', 'defeat', 'bandits', 'why', 'had', 'lowered', 'opinion', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Truly', 'somewhat', 'same', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'nine', 'years', 'probably', 'set', 'tone', 'others', 'follow', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'twice', 'find', 'overlong', 'boring', 'film', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'nice', 'substitute', 'want', 'see', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'again', 'pretty', 'much', 'Yul', 'Brynner']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

So he gathers up a total of six other gunman (hence the title): Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Robert Vaughn, and young Horst Buckholz. They each have their quirks and are each individuals. We get to know what motivates them, and we get to admire their courage as well as their skill with a gun.McQueen helped Yul Brynner to drive a hearse in the American town where they met when the bigoted townsfolk refused to let the undertaker bury an Indian on Boot Hill. McQueen rides shotgun, commenting that it's the first time he's ever ridden shotgun on a hearse. So Brynner of course includes him in the seven. He does a very low-key, confident style that does not take center stage. Center is Yul's as far as I'm concerned, and he's also obviously the leader of the seven.They found Bronson chopping wood for his dinner, and even though they had only been promised $20 each, he goes along. Coburn is at least as good with a knife as he is with a gun, as he demonstrates to some braggarts who hassle him while he's just minding his own business, apparently trying to nap.Brad Dexter wants in because he's convinced there is some treasure that is the real goal, even though Brynner tells him there is not. Robert Vaughn is running from the law, so going to Mexico suits his purposes. Buckholz is a young hot-head who simply refuses to be left behind. When Brynner humiliates him twice (he's had enough to drink that there's no telling what he might do if he was sober), he follows the six men as they head south, and eventually becomes the seventh when they arrive at the village and he berates the farmers as cowards, insists they will learn how to shoot and defend their own village.The problem is, Calvera has about 40 men, possibly more, and while the seven do indeed teach the village men how to shoot, they don't have all that many guns, and the novice shooters cannot be expected to do all that much. They are out-numbered considerably.I won't spoil it by telling you how they manage to defeat Calvera, but was there any doubt they would win? Nor will I tell you how many are still alive when the dust settles. Of course you know Yul Brynner survived.It's not your typical western by any means.",4,Star-Studded Western,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2436,"['Yul', 'Brynner', 'gunman', 'named', 'Chris', 'Adams', 'who', 'persuaded', 'help', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'village', 'been', 'terrorized', 'outlaw', 'named', 'Calvera', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'robbed', 'harvest', 'basically', 'humiliated', 'up', 'total', 'six', 'other', 'gunman', 'hence', 'title', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'young', 'Horst', 'Buckholz', 'have', 'quirks', 'are', 'individuals', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'get', 'admire', 'courage', 'as', 'well', 'skill', 'gun.McQueen', 'helped', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'drive', 'hearse', 'American', 'town', 'where', 'met', 'when', 'bigoted', 'townsfolk', 'refused', 'let', 'undertaker', 'bury', 'Indian', 'Boot', 'Hill', 'McQueen', 'shotgun', 'commenting', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'ridden', 'shotgun', 'hearse', 'So', 'Brynner', 'course', 'seven', 'very', 'low-key', 'confident', 'style', 'not', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'Center', 'Yul', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'also', 'obviously', 'leader', 'seven.They', 'found', 'Bronson', 'chopping', 'wood', 'dinner', 'even', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'promised', '20', 'along', 'Coburn', 'least', 'good', 'knife', 'gun', 'braggarts', 'who', 'hassle', 'just', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'apparently', 'trying', 'nap.Brad', 'Dexter', 'convinced', 'treasure', 'real', 'goal', 'even', 'Brynner', 'not', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'running', 'law', 'so', 'going', 'Mexico', 'suits', 'purposes', 'Buckholz', 'young', 'hot-head', 'who', 'simply', 'be', 'left', 'behind', 'When', 'Brynner', 'twice', 'had', 'enough', 'drink', 'telling', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'was', 'sober', 'six', 'men', 'head', 'south', 'eventually', 'seventh', 'when', 'arrive', 'village', 'farmers', 'cowards', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'shoot', 'defend', 'own', 'village.The', 'problem', 'Calvera', 'about', '40', 'men', 'possibly', 'more', 'seven', 'do', 'indeed', 'teach', 'village', 'men', 'how', 'shoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'guns', 'novice', 'shooters', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'do', 'much', 'are', 'out-numbered', 'considerably.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'how', 'manage', 'defeat', 'Calvera', 'was', 'there', 'doubt', 'would', 'win', 'will', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'dust', 'settles', 'course', 'know', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'survived.It', 'not', 'typical', 'western', 'means']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

In contrast with the popular gunslinger westerns of the day, this film instead casts the role of desperado in a negative light.  These seven men are among the best in the business, and yet they are forced to take a job where they put their lives on the line for next to nothing.  Everywhere they go they are feared and respected, yet they find themselves envying the simple farmers they are hired to defend, because at least the farmers have something to fight for.In what is perhaps one of the most sobering scenes in any western, Christ (Brenner), Vin (McQueen), and the others sit around discussing what has become of their lives, and what sort of lives they are forced to live as a result of their dangerous lifestyle.  Instead of admiring these men, the viewer is forced to almost PITY them.  In the end, when all is said and done, Chris takes stock of what has happened.  The seven are victorious, but, as Chris says, ""We all lose.""  They always lose, and all that is left to do is ride off into the sunset.

Many of the scenes seem to be choreographed, almost like ballet, with the actors performing stylized movements, in set pieces, reminiscent of Eisenstein's films. Heads move in unison, or in sequence; the actors are carefully placed in the framework; they move almost like dancers, so that the whole film has a rhythmic, formal quality which, imho, makes it almost unique, and especially memorable. Many of the scenes are unforgettably iconic: Bronson chopping wood; Robert Vaughn catching his one fly, and sliding down with his mouth against the adobe wall; Brynner coming from nowhere, back there, and heading nowhere, forward. The dialogue is also admirably laconic: ""the worst""; ""haw, haw, haw""; ""you lost""; ""no enemies --- alive""; ""Florrie won't believe this""; ""time was I'd have caught all three""; ""the farmers always win"". As remarked in the very interesting special features section, the themes are timeless, and given outstanding expression in this drama. The world divides into farmers and cowboys, classic and romantic, ancient and modern; winners and losers. Romance = death and loss; the plodding peasant survives, and carries on. Like Bronson says, it may be braver to accept responsibility, and carry the burden.

420903,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,630442972X,Brad Baker,"[32, 36]","MGM has just released the DVD of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, perhaps the very last of an epoch of classic westerns. Poignant and sad, yet thrilling and action-filled, this cinema classic became a model for 100 action flicks to come. It's an early peek at the emerging movie anti-hero of the 60's and the 70's.  An embattled farming village in Northern Mexico hires an unemployed gunslinger from Dodge City.  Chris, played by Yul Brynner, recruits six more guns and takes a bloody stand against forty invading banditos. The film opened in 1960 to mild reviews.  It was sent off to Europe, where it exploded with positive response.  &quot;The Seven&quot; returned to the U.S. to wide acclaim, and as co-star James Coburn says in the documentary, &quot;It's been playing ever since...&quot; John Sturges filmed &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, &quot;Gunfight at the OK Corral&quot;, and &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, but history confirms that the meticulous out-door director achieved his artistic peak with this star-studded spectacle, featuring Elmer Bernstein's now classic theme. The film was followed by 3 sequels and a TV show that ran for 2 years. The DVD sound dialogue is a bit muted. The anamorphic 16:9 picture is perhaps the clearest ever, though you'll see some grain fallout during the lap dissolves. An audio commentary track with producer Walter Mirisch and several actors comes with 2 trailers and photos from the actual shoot and cast party.  The real jewel of this new DVD is a brand new 46-minute documentary featuring interviews with all the major surviving stars, except Charles Bronson, who just turned 80. Charles Coburn, Eli Wallach, and Robert Vaughn re-live the adventures of filming this epic on location in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Amusing tales of future super-star Steve McQueen are revealed by his ex-wife. McQueen intentionally crashed his sports car to leave his TV series, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, and join the cast of &quot;Seven&quot;. Yul Brynner so enjoyed his all-black gunfighter attire that he repeated the same exact outfit in at least 4 more movies. Yul Brynner died of lung cancer in 1985. Steve McQueen died of cancer in 1980. Thanks to this timeless and valuable DVD, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; may never die. After the raging battle ends, Brynner's character looks down on newly dug graves for the brave villagers.  &quot;We didn't do it..&quot;he says. &quot;Only the farmers win. We never win...&quot;",5,Strap on your six-shooter!,997228800,"08 8, 2001",2001,2468,"['MGM', 'just', 'released', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'very', 'last', 'epoch', 'classic', 'westerns', 'Poignant', 'sad', 'thrilling', 'action-filled', 'cinema', 'classic', 'became', 'model', '100', 'action', 'flicks', 'come', 'early', 'peek', 'emerging', 'movie', 'anti-hero', '60', '70', 'embattled', 'farming', 'village', 'Northern', 'Mexico', 'unemployed', 'gunslinger', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Chris', 'played', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'six', 'more', 'guns', 'bloody', 'stand', 'forty', 'invading', 'banditos', 'film', 'opened', '1960', 'mild', 'reviews', 'was', 'sent', 'off', 'Europe', 'where', 'exploded', 'positive', 'response', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'returned', 'U.S.', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'co-star', 'James', 'Coburn', 'documentary', 'quot', 'been', 'playing', 'ever', 'quot', 'John', 'Sturges', 'filmed', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Black', 'Rock', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'quot', 'quot', 'Great', 'Escape', 'quot', 'history', 'confirms', 'meticulous', 'out-door', 'director', 'achieved', 'artistic', 'peak', 'star-studded', 'spectacle', 'featuring', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'now', 'classic', 'theme', 'film', 'was', 'followed', '3', 'sequels', 'TV', 'show', 'ran', '2', 'years', 'DVD', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'muted', 'anamorphic', '16:9', 'picture', 'perhaps', 'clearest', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'see', 'grain', 'fallout', 'lap', 'dissolves', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'producer', 'Walter', 'Mirisch', 'several', 'actors', '2', 'trailers', 'photos', 'actual', 'shoot', 'cast', 'party', 'real', 'jewel', 'new', 'DVD', 'brand', 'new', '46-minute', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'major', 'surviving', 'stars', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'who', 'just', 'turned', '80', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 're-live', 'adventures', 'filming', 'epic', 'location', 'Cuernavaca', 'Mexico', 'Amusing', 'tales', 'future', 'super-star', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'are', 'revealed', 'ex-wife', 'McQueen', 'intentionally', 'crashed', 'sports', 'car', 'leave', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'quot', 'join', 'cast', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'enjoyed', 'all-black', 'gunfighter', 'attire', 'repeated', 'same', 'exact', 'outfit', 'least', '4', 'more', 'movies', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'died', 'lung', 'cancer', '1985', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'died', 'cancer', '1980', 'Thanks', 'timeless', 'valuable', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'may', 'never', 'die', 'raging', 'battle', 'Brynner', 'character', 'down', 'newly', 'dug', 'graves', 'brave', 'villagers', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'it..', 'quot', 'quot', 'Only', 'farmers', 'win', 'never', 'win', 'quot']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

I won't go into too much detail about the film's plot, except to say that it was a unique work amoung westerns, and very entertaining.  Not only did this movie make its mark on other filmmakers at the time, but it collected and cataloged many standard movie items you see in movies made 20 years before AND after it.  You got the innocence and clarity of older westerns - the perfectly clean costumes and sweeping music, and that obvious contrast between outdoor and stage shots.  Action scenes were quick and unfocused (typical western stuff), and we are treated with that strange Hollywood way of shooting guns, where the actors don't aim at all.  Yul Brynner gives a very traditional, stoic performance, hardly moving a muscle for any of his scenes.  Many of the actors gave old-style, John Wayne-inspired performances, in which they stand perfectly still and read their lines with a straight face and dead earnesty.  When they finally move, they seem to explode into action.Contrast this with the fidgetting and fussing of Steve McQueen's much more human performance, and you can almost see how movies will change entirely in the next 15 years.  Eli Wallach's bandit villian is a perfectly likeable fellow, while some of the heroes are hunted and greedy.  The first scenes show the heroes confronting racism - in 1960!  The Magnificent Seven was one of the first movies made outside of the studio system, and it shows.  The entire supporting cast is played by Mexican actors who are willing -and allowed- to portray their characters in a realistic, human light.  Perhaps the best reason to watch this movie is to prepare yourself for the film that inspired it - Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, one of the greatest movies of all time, from -any- country or genre.The DVD:  The visual quality is only average.  The print is stratched and grainy, and when a transition shot approaches, the image becomes even worse!  The sound is faithful to the original movie, but nothing to show-off your stereo with.  The documentary is the best extra, as it lovingly explores the history of the movie, the legal troubles of its early creation, the friendly rivalry of the Seven actors on the set, and the strange relationship that Eli Wallach had with his band of bandits.  There is also a commentary track, but much of the information in this track is presented more clearly in the documentary.Definitely a must-buy for western fans.",4,"A Timeless Classic, part of Western History...",1013558400,"02 13, 2002",2002,2509,"['Movie', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'truly', 'most', 'timeless', 'Western', 'ever', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'film', 'plot', 'say', 'was', 'unique', 'work', 'amoung', 'westerns', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'make', 'mark', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'collected', 'cataloged', 'many', 'standard', 'movie', 'items', 'see', 'movies', 'made', '20', 'years', 'AND', 'got', 'innocence', 'clarity', 'older', 'westerns', 'perfectly', 'clean', 'costumes', 'sweeping', 'music', 'obvious', 'contrast', 'outdoor', 'stage', 'shots', 'Action', 'scenes', 'were', 'quick', 'unfocused', 'typical', 'western', 'stuff', 'are', 'treated', 'strange', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'shooting', 'guns', 'where', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'aim', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'very', 'traditional', 'stoic', 'performance', 'hardly', 'moving', 'muscle', 'scenes', 'Many', 'actors', 'gave', 'old-style', 'John', 'Wayne-inspired', 'performances', 'stand', 'perfectly', 'still', 'read', 'lines', 'straight', 'face', 'dead', 'earnesty', 'When', 'finally', 'move', 'seem', 'explode', 'action.Contrast', 'fidgetting', 'fussing', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'performance', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'how', 'movies', 'will', 'change', 'entirely', 'next', '15', 'years', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'bandit', 'villian', 'perfectly', 'likeable', 'fellow', 'heroes', 'are', 'hunted', 'greedy', 'first', 'scenes', 'show', 'heroes', 'confronting', 'racism', '1960', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'made', 'studio', 'system', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'played', 'Mexican', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'willing', '-and', 'allowed-', 'portray', 'characters', 'realistic', 'human', 'light', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'prepare', 'film', 'inspired', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', '-any-', 'country', 'genre.The', 'DVD', 'visual', 'quality', 'only', 'average', 'print', 'stratched', 'grainy', 'when', 'transition', 'shot', 'approaches', 'image', 'even', 'worse', 'sound', 'faithful', 'original', 'movie', 'nothing', 'show-off', 'stereo', 'documentary', 'best', 'extra', 'lovingly', 'history', 'movie', 'legal', 'troubles', 'early', 'creation', 'friendly', 'rivalry', 'Seven', 'actors', 'set', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'had', 'band', 'bandits', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', 'much', 'information', 'track', 'presented', 'more', 'clearly', 'documentary.Definitely', 'must-buy', 'western', 'fans']",The Magnificent Seven VHS
420916,A95SF04RX9G8,630442972X,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[2, 11]","The Magnificent Seven, a Western remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, is a good movie, but hardly the classic that many people would make it out to be. The simplistic plot delivers exactly what it should, but the film falls short in its character development, possibly because of the limits of a 2-hour running time.A small early 1900s Mexican farming village has been pillaged for years by a group of bandits lead by a man named Calvera (Eli Wallach). When the bandits come through, the villagers are left with hardly enough food to feed half of them; but since they are a group of farmers, they have no way of protecting themselves from Calvera and his men. After consulting the village elder, they decide to look for a group of gunfighters to protect them.Enter Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a drifter through the plains of the Old West, with nothing to lose, and not much to gain except respect for himself. Three representatives from the village seek his help, and, having nothing better on his plate at the moment, he agrees and assembles a group of seven men to protect the village.The cast is a veritable who's who of 1960s tough guy actors: Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn among others. All of these men can act, but there's just not enough time to give full weight to all seven of the gunfighters, and the film feels incomplete because of this.Also, The Magnificent Seven has not aged particularly well since its initial release almost 45 years ago. It's hard to believe that around the turn of the century in a small farming village in Mexico, all of the people would be bilingual, and not only that, but some of them speak English so well that the only way we can tell that they are supposed to be Mexican is by their bodily characteristics.Of course, any discussion of The Magnificent Seven is not complete without mentioning Elmer Bernstein's legendary score.

420920,AUHG8KSHI529U,630442972X,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","Nowadays most everyone knows who Kurosawa was and has seen his &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.  This was not the case in 1960.  &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; was offered as an adaptation of a great Japanese film.  The producers made it a western and a pretty good one at that.This movie is one of the last of the classic westerns before Clint Eastwood and company changed the form into something else.  In this movie there are heroes without irony or grafted in psychological complications.  It is true that these heroes aren't saints, but they aren't basket cases either and they do rise to occasion.In adapting the story to a Hollywood Western and few things had to change.  Since the cowboys are gun fighters rather than samurai the kind of fighting is different and changes the story a bit.  Since gun fighters didn't have the same formal hierarchy or history as a samurai, other changes had to be made.Since the movie was shot in Mexico, the censors didn't want the peasants to be presented as anything but clean and noble, and that caused some other changes in the story.  And the sword fighter became a knife fighter (James Coburn).  The knife is kind of cool and everyone remembers it, but it doesn't have the same majesty or magic as a sword.  But who fought with a sword in the west?Another big difference is that this is a Hollywood movie and adheres to the two-hour length pretty closely.  Kurosawa's movie is 3 hrs and 20 mins.  So, much of the character development of the seven heroes has to be left out.  They are all there and function similarly to their counterparts in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, but other than Yul Brynner, they really don't get many lines or much screen time.Eli Wallach is fabulous as the villain Calvera and Steve McQueen is at his scene stealing best.  The weirdest casting choice was the young romantic lead being given to Horst Buchholz from Germany.  He does a good job with the role, however.The disk has a documentary on the making of the movie as well as audio commentaries and the theatrical trailers.  Visually, it is a good transfer and a very pleasing disk.

They all look like pool patio party night at Rock Hudson's all-male mansion.The original Seven Samurai is so far and away superior to this all-male revue, which as in all Sturges's film features his unknown beefcake of the week, here a German kid forced to grimace and grunt as the Hollywood stereotype Mexican gunfighter, here poorly stealing the role of the young want-to-be young Samurai in the original. Sturges failed to make the very real and human message of the original part of his plastic production. Both do or do not get the girl in the end, but in which one do you care?A great tragedy occurred when Anthony Quinn who originally had the idea to make Seven Samurai into a Western did not get the backing in time to do something decent with it. Instead we have this absolutely ridiculous and racist dog, in which Jewish Brooklyn's best Eli Wallach is forced to sweat and grunt and grimace as if a stereotypical Mexican bandit. Sergio Leone used him to much greater effect later. Same actor; better job.Don't waste your time and money on nothing but a magnificent soundtrack. Get the original Seven Samurai. Way better, and you will be spared the embarrassment which is this Sturges mess. For a further example, compare Bronson's woodcutting warrior scene stolen from the original with Kurasawa's scene, and tell me which tells far more of a story. Even cheat by leaving on the commentator. Which one seems more real, and more funny?And once again it wasn't Bronson's fault that Sturges is an idiot. Look at what Sergio Leone did with Bronson, telling his whole life's story with a stare in Once Upon a Time in the West, a far more interesting western than any of Sturge's all-male fantasies.Get the Kurasawa original Seven Samurai and you will never stop replaying it and always learn something new each time. The running commentary by some American guy isn't all that obnoxious after all.

Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","In 1954, filmmaker Akira Kurosawa released the film ""Seven Samurai"" which took the world by storm.Several years later, a loose US adaptation of the film was written by William Roberts (""Red Sun"", ""The Donna Reed Show"") and given a western setting.And directing the film would be John Sturges (""The Great Escape"", ""Bad Day at Black Rock"", ""The Eagle has Landed"") and would feature an all-star cast which included Yul Brynner (""The Ten Commandments"", ""The King and I"", ""Westworld""), Steve McQueen (""The Great Escape"", ""Papilon"", ""Bullit""), Charles Bronson (""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""The Great Escape""), James Coburn (""The Great Escape"", ""Charade""), Robert Vaughn (""Bullitt"", ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""), Brad Dexter (""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Von Ryan's Express"") and Horst Buchholz (""Life is Beatiful"", ""Tiger Bay"").The film would be considered one of the top American films of all time (#79 on the American Film Institute's ""100 Years...100 Thrills"") and was nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture"" and was voted #8 on AFI's ""100 Years of Film Scores"".The film would lead to three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (1966), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" (1969) and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride"" (1972).VIDEO:""The Magnificent Seven"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  For a film shot back in 1960, it was great to watch this film and see a good amount of detail!  From the grime and sweat on the faces of the characters, the detail on the bricks and windows.  Colors are very good, back levels are nice and deep and while I did notice some color fluctuations and a few white specks, I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major problems.If anything, fans of the film should be happy with the overall picture quality!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Magnificent Seven"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 Mono, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is primarily dialogue driven, I did notice the horse hooves playing through the surround channels, as with the Elmer Bernstein's musical score.  The bullets and explosions also sound good via lossless and for the most part, for 1960 film, I did like the fact that a 5.1 DTS-HD lossless track was added along with the original monaural soundtrack.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Magnificent Seven"" comes with the following special features:Commentary by Producer Walter Mirisch, Assistant Director Robert Relyea, and Actors James Coburn and Eli Wallach- A wonderful commentary featuring in-depth information about the film.Guns for Hire: The Making of The Magnificent Seven - (46:54) A wonderful featurette about how ""The Magnificent Seven"" was adapted from Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" and the competitive nature of the talent in the film.  Also interviews with talent and producers.The Linen Book: Lost Images from The Magnificent Seven - (14:48) Maggie Adams, head of MGM's photo archive talks about the discovery of ""The Magnificent Seven"" linen book and also a few of the stars talking about the photography in the book.Original Theatrical Trailers - Featuring two trailers.Still Gallery - (4:05)JUDGMENT CALL:""The Magnificent Seven"" was the first of several Westerns to be based on Akira Kurosawa's popular film.While the film adaptation of ""The Magnificent Seven"" is much different than the ""Seven Samurai"", the timing of the film was perfect as Westerns were still popular in America and it was one of the few films to see an all-star cast (albeit when many of them were younger) and for the most part, a wonderfully directed film by John Sturges.While today, the subject of guns for hire, protecting the unfortunate is part of the banality of modern Westerns, part of the the uniqueness of ""The Magnificent Seven"" was that it was based on an impressive film but this time carried out into a Western atmosphere.  Acting by all men were well-done and with the all-star cast, it is no surprise that there were ego's involved in the film and you can see Steve McQueen really trying to do his best to upstage Yul Brynner in the film.In fact, one of the greatest inclusion for this anniversary Blu-ray release is the fact that we get to learn what took place behind-the-scenes of the making of the film.It's important to note that there is no difference with this 2011 Blu-ray release compared to what is inside ""The Magnificent Seven"" Collection.  The main thing is these films are now being released individually and if you own the set, no need to buy this Blu-ray release.  With that being said, if you own the 2006 Collector's Edition on DVD, you may want to hang on to that release as it does have the Sir Christopher Frayling audio commentary track not included on this Blu-ray release.""The Magnificent Seven"" is a satisfying Western with one heck of a memorable score but while I felt the ""Seven Samurai"" was a much better film in terms of character development and pacing, ""The Magnificent Seven"" was still very entertaining and great to see how the adaptation would be carried out as a Western.I just remember when I first watched the film and seeing how different the film was compared to the original Kurosawa film for the last half hour, I did enjoy the action sequences and for the most part, the personality differences amongst each of the hired guns.I felt at the time that ""The Magnificent Seven"" was an exciting film and for the Blu-ray release, I'm quite confident that fans of the film or for those looking for Westerns on Blu-ray should definitely check this movie out.  While, I wouldn't call it one of the great Westerns ever made, it's still an entertaining film.While the sequels did not do any justice for this film (the quality of the films literally slowly go downhill from the second sequel to the next), if you are a Western fan, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: Fans of ""The Magnificent Seven"" will no doubt enjoy this

Many who know a heck of a lot more about the genre than moi claim it to be the ""greatest Western ever.""  (I will maintain 'til they shovel dirt over me that ""Lonesome Dove"" is the greatest Western ever, but that's a topic for another time.)  I had never had the opportunity to watch this film until I ran across it late one evening on public television, so I seized the chance to experience the ""greatest Western ever.""Given the melodrama, banality, and over-the-top acting so prevalent in films at the time, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN still requires a suspension of disbelief unhindered by the cosmos themselves.  Yul Brynner. . .in a Western?  As King of Siam or Pharaoh of Egypt, sure; but not as a grim-faced leader of six thugs and misfits on horseback.  Too often, as I watched Brynner turn to his sidekick in this film (Steve McQueen), I expected him to say, ""So let it be written, so let it be done!""  I guess my point is (if there is a point to any of this), if the viewer is constantly putting the lead character into other roles more suitable while watching a film, the film itself becomes unsuitable.As to the ensemble of the ""Seven,"" the guys never meshed, in my view.  Charles Bronson was too bizarre while Brad Dexter too plain and James Coburn should have taken an extra couple of visits to the buffet line on the set.  The prim and proper Robert Vaughn comes across as the Donald Trump of cowboys (which means his character is a howler), and I never was able to figure out if Horst Buchholz was supposed to be Hispanic, American, European, or extra-terrestrial.Fact is, I never was able to figure out what all the hoopla was (and is) surrounding this film.For Westerns to be engaging, the actors have to seamlessly take the viewer into the story. . .make him or her care what happens.  Instead, with THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, I spent too much time guffawing.  Sorry, Western lovers, this film was way too contrived and hackneyed for me.

Directed by John Sturges in 1960, the story line is lifted directly from Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, a 1954 masterpiece, that depicted the struggle between Japanese peasants and the heartless bandits who intend to seize their land and assume ultimate control over their hard earned resources.In the case of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the plot has been transposed to the struggle between Mexican bandits--specifically the evil Calvera (Eli Wallach)--and the farmers for whom corn is their predominant cash crop.  The title 'Seven' are a group of gunslingers, lead by Chris (Yul Brynner), a skillful renegade.  He bands together an unlikely posse.  This includes the inexperienced Chico [or ""boy"" in English], played by German actor Horst Buccholz, Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), Vin (Steve McQueen), Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), Britt (James Coburn), and Lee (Robert Vaughn).  Together these gunslingers train the locals how to shoot guns and defend themselves, as well as instilling in them a sense of courage and newfound self-worth.It's so wonderful, for me, to see Yul Brynner in one of the best roles of his career.  Before, the only association I really had with him was that of ""The King"" in THE KING AND I, and it's truly a pleasure to see him as a swaggering and heroic cowboy.  What's more, the score is truly unforgettable--particularly, the theme song that resonates throughout the film, composed by Elmer Bernstein.

The film has lost much of its luster over time, so it is today mainly of historical interest.153us - The Magnificent Seven (John Sturges, 1960, 128') - 10/9/2012",3,An oldie,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,507,"['Magnificent', 'Seven', 'John', 'Sturges', '1960', '128', 'Inspired', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', '1954', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'how', 'oppressed', 'Mexican', 'peasant', 'village', 'assembles', 'seven', 'gunfighters', 'help', 'defend', 'homes', 'film', 'stars', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'film', 'lost', 'much', 'luster', 'time', 'today', 'mainly', 'historical', 'interest.153us', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'John', 'Sturges', '1960', '128', '10/9/2012']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","John Sturgis' 1960 classic western, ""The Magnificent Seven"", pits seven gunfighters against a band of ruthless bandits for the fate of a small Mexican village.  In the process, Sturgis successfully translates an equally classic Japanese samurai legend to the setting of the American West.Yul Brynner is Chris, the leader of the Seven, a steely-eyed gunfighter who takes pity on the beleaguered villagers.  He is nicely backed by Steve MacQueen as a down-on-his-luck gambler looking for a stake.  Charles Bronson is a Mexican-Irish gunsel who develops a soft spot for the children of the village.  James Coburn is pitch-perfect as a taciturn knife-fighter.  Robert Vaughn works a complicated portrayal as a gunfighter who has lost his nerve.  Veteran actor Brad Nelson almost disappears in the cast as an older gunman looking for a last payday.  Horst Buchholz nearly steals the show as a young and inexperienced wanna-be.  Eli Wallach is superb as the wise-cracking and cynical bandit chief.The magnificent seven will take on the job of defending the village, only to find the banditos are persistent.  When given a chance to walk away from a final confrontation with the bandits, the seven will elect to fight it out in a duel to the death that not all will survive.

Along with that Peckinpaugh classic, this in my opinion is the best western, and one of the best movies ever made.The story is well told via the synopses, so  there is no need to re-hash that.  The characters are great, and portrayed  by Brynner, McQueen, Coburn, Bronson and the rest in arguably their seminal  roles.They must be bad guys, because they are gunslingers for a living,  right?  But how can you explain their seeing to it that an old Indian gets  a decent burial?  Coburn kills a man with a knife just to prove he is  faster, but refuses to be told what to do by Calvera, with the classic  macho line:  &quot;Nobody throws me my guns and says 'run'.  Nobody!&quot;They sure know Good from Evil, though.  Bronson lectures  the village boys and sets them straight on their fathers' unseen courage.  Perhaps the best line comes during the argument as to whether or not to  fight on after some of the villagers betray them:  When McQueen opines that  no Court would ever enforce the contract they made with the villagers,  Brynner ends the discussion with a simple sentence: &quot;That is exactly  the kind of contract you have got to keep.&quot;Bullys lose in the  end.  Sometimes we are called upon to make an extreme sacrifice to do the  right thing.  Adversity can help restore ones honor.

The Saturday afternoon TV favorite regains much of its original sweep with a 2.35:1 widescreen presentation that makes it easier for viewers to take in the large cast of stars and soon-to-be-stars. The color transfer is an improvement on past video efforts, although some age spots are in evidence. The mono sound comes through with plenty of muscle, but the 5.1 mix fails to justify its existence with almost no activity to the rear speakers. (Beware the jaw-dropping volume difference between the menu and film.) Elmer Bernstein's iconic score gets the star treatment it deserves throughout. The 1960 remake of Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; stars Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, with Eli Wallach as the bandit king undone by his belief in honor among dangerous men. Brynner turns in a stand-up performance as Chris, the Christ-figure leader, but it's Wallach who shows the boys how it's done via a magnificent performance laden with grease and bluster. A first-rate 46-minute documentary (in widescreen) begins with the story of how Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; electrified  Hollywood professionals when it hit town in 1956. Brynner, in file footage, brags of how he immediately grabbed the rights for a remake, but it was in fact writer-producer Lou Morheim who imported the tale for a mere $250. As the project got under way, Morheim was relegated to associate producer, with studio favorite Walter Mirisch taking the reins. Production was rushed, with the specter of a Hollywood strike riding hard on the project's heels. The docu aptly makes the case that &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; was a transitional work from the classic age of westerns to the grim, gory works of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah.",4,The way of the gun,990230400,"05 19, 2001",2001,1823,"['quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'thunders', 'back', 'video', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'MGM', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'TV', 'favorite', 'much', 'original', 'sweep', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'easier', 'viewers', 'take', 'large', 'cast', 'stars', 'soon-to-be-stars', 'color', 'transfer', 'improvement', 'past', 'video', 'efforts', 'age', 'spots', 'are', 'evidence', 'mono', 'sound', 'plenty', 'muscle', '5.1', 'mix', 'fails', 'justify', 'existence', 'almost', 'activity', 'rear', 'speakers', 'jaw-dropping', 'volume', 'difference', 'menu', 'film', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'iconic', 'score', 'star', 'treatment', '1960', 'remake', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'stars', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'bandit', 'king', 'undone', 'belief', 'honor', 'dangerous', 'men', 'Brynner', 'stand-up', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Christ-figure', 'leader', 'Wallach', 'who', 'boys', 'how', 'done', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'laden', 'grease', 'bluster', 'first-rate', '46-minute', 'documentary', 'widescreen', 'story', 'how', 'Kurosawa', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'electrified', 'Hollywood', 'professionals', 'when', 'hit', 'town', '1956', 'Brynner', 'file', 'footage', 'brags', 'how', 'immediately', 'grabbed', 'rights', 'remake', 'was', 'fact', 'writer-producer', 'Lou', 'Morheim', 'who', 'imported', 'tale', 'mere', '250', 'project', 'got', 'way', 'Morheim', 'was', 'relegated', 'associate', 'producer', 'studio', 'favorite', 'Walter', 'Mirisch', 'taking', 'reins', 'Production', 'was', 'rushed', 'specter', 'Hollywood', 'strike', 'riding', 'hard', 'project', 'heels', 'docu', 'aptly', 'case', 'quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'was', 'transitional', 'work', 'classic', 'age', 'westerns', 'grim', 'gory', 'works', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

All comparisons to SEVEN SAMURAI aside, this Americanized version of the Japanese classic is a classic in its own right.I was very enthusiastic about watching this new special edition DVD of this wonderful film, so I have to say sadly that I was just a bit disappointed. The film has not really been remastered, and thus, the image is full of artifacts displaying the movie's age. It's not unusual for a movie over forty years old to look this way, but it's disappointing nonetheless. The colors are solid, and the widescreen framing gives us the entire picture, all to the good. But those specks and that dirt that keep coming with relentless consistency occasionally ruin the wonderful screen compositions.The sound is even more disappointing. Though being advertised as remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, it's really basically mono. In addition, there is virtually no bass in the sound mix, so the superb Elmer Bernstein score, one of the true classics in film music, isn't heard to optimum effect. Occasionally some of the music drifts into the back speakers, but no sound effects have been routed there, and the result is a sound design not as spectacular as the film it's linked with.There is a fantastic 46 minute documentary done in anomorphic widescreen with full-bodied sound that is a wonderful bonus, and the running commentary that accompanies the film is also most welcome.MGM hasn't provided a bad package with this classic.

The individual scenes are nearly a one-for-one match with the scenes in the original Seven Samurai so the writer(s) could focus on the characters which helps make the Magnificent Seven work even better. They are just more believable in the western setting.On the downside is the somewhat thin take on the individual scenes in the MS versus the depth portrayed in the SS scenes. For instance replacing the MS scene of the boot hill burial of a dead indian for the SS scene where the samurai cuts his cue off to resemble a Buddhist monk in the rescue of the kidnapped child shows the vast depth difference between the two.Anyway, I have always been a fan of the MS and watch it every now and again to refresh the story of unlikely heroes and insurmountable odds in life.",5,Just Great!!,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,1154,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'story', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'story', 'might', 'seem', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'whole', 'cloth', 'so', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'original', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Magnificent', 'Seven.Never-the-less', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'chosen', 'play', 'individual', 'parts', 'tee', 'ensemble', 'works', 'just', 'great', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'one-for-one', 'match', 'scenes', 'original', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'writer', 's', 'could', 'focus', 'characters', 'helps', 'make', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'work', 'even', 'better', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'believable', 'western', 'downside', 'somewhat', 'thin', 'take', 'individual', 'scenes', 'MS', 'depth', 'portrayed', 'SS', 'scenes', 'instance', 'replacing', 'MS', 'scene', 'boot', 'hill', 'burial', 'dead', 'indian', 'SS', 'scene', 'where', 'samurai', 'cue', 'resemble', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'rescue', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'vast', 'depth', 'difference', 'two.Anyway', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'MS', 'watch', 'now', 'again', 'refresh', 'story', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'life']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

420962,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,630442972X,Gary P. Cohen,"[3, 5]","Last year, a theater in Manhattan was doing a retrospective of United Artists films.  I decided to see ""The Magnificent Seven"" again on the big screen.  Seeing it left me with a stange feeling of sadness.This film was released in 1960.  At the time, Yul Brynner was still a superstar and Eli Wallach was a fairly established actor.  The rest of the cast were still young and fresh.  Steve McQueen was still doing ""Wanted-Dead or Alive"" on TV.  He was still three years away from superstardom with ""The Great Escape.""  Charles Bronson would continue guest-starring on shows like ""Combat"" and ""The Fugitive,"" as well as appearing in supporting roles in popular epics like ""The Great Escape,"" ""Battle of the Bulge"" and ""The Dirty Dozen""  He would not become a massive superstar until ""Death Wish"" in 1974.  Coburn also did tv and supporting roles in films like ""Americanization of Emily"" and ""Charade.""  He became ""Our Man Flint"" in 1965.  Robert Vaughn became ""The Man from UNCLE"" in 1964.  Now, with the exception of Vaughn and Wallach, they are all gone.  It seems sad.The thing that always surprises me about this film is that despite having a great action director in John Sturges, (one of my favorites,) the action scenes are really quite average.  Other than McQueen flying through the air firing his pistol, there really isn't anything spectacular about the action sequences.  The deaths of Bronson, Vaughn and Coburn, (gee I hope I haven't given anything away,) are especially uninteresting.  One minute Coburn is shooting, the next minute he is shot, we don't even actually see him hit.  I love so many of Sturges' films, especially ""The Great Escape ""and ""Ice Station Zebra,"" however the action scenes really are disappointing.I watched the deluxe dvd last night with the audio commentary by film historian, Sir Christopher Frayling.  The commentary was good, although I did enjoy his commentary on the dvd of ""Once Upon a Time in the ""West"" musch better.  How Frayling could fail to mention once Sturges' all-time classic ""The Great Escape"" is beyond me.  The dvd has a nice retrospective and some other featurettes including one on Elmer Bernstein who composed the magnificent music for this film and ""The Great Escape"" (as well as two great Duke Wayne scores ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" and especially, ""The Comancheros.""I enjoyed watching the dvd again.  It brought me back to a time, 1960, when show-biz legends like McQueen and Bronson were just beginning.  It also brought me back to a time when American school children were still being taught American history in our schools and not just being taught to hate their own country.

It still stands up although the plot, at times, is simply unrealistic if not idiotic. Calveri, the Mexican outlaw, would not simply let the seven gunmen go after he captures them. This makes no sense. He would kill them. The idiotic plot twist allows the dramatic return of the seven. And what the director and screenwriter have against farmers is beyond me. I'm guessing no one in Hollywood knows anything about farmers so don't mind criticizing them. I don't think many people in Hollywood know much about agriculture either.The film wants to draw a parallel between Calveri and his men and the Seven, because both sides use guns. But that's an example of moral blindness. Chris (Yul Brunner) and his men could walk away. They don't because they want to help the villagers at the risk of their own lives. The two groups of men, although they both use guns, are very different. The Seven  are certainly not saints but they are not on a moral par with the bandits.The acting is superb. The acting and the action carry the film.

420968,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,630442972X,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[221, 254]","Yul Brynner, back in the late 1950's, wanted to direct an American version of the SEVEN SAMURAI, as an western. So he bought up the movie rights. He wanted to cast Anthony Quinn in the lead, as Chris. Brynner had been directed by Quinn in the remake of THE BUCCANEER. Quinn would have been great as Chris, the leader of the Seven; and what a different film it would have been. But, alas, Brynner himself took the part, and put his own stamp of individuality on it. He walked like a cross between a panther and a ballet dancer; light on the balls of his feet. Ironically, as an actor, he was slow on the draw, and not used to Westerns. But artistically, this was never apparent in the finished film.Many of the Seven's actors had seen the Kurosawa film, and they were very excited about transferring it to the American West. Eli Wallach, as Calvera, in just a few short scenes, found both the humor and the cruelty in the bandit chieftan. His accent and speech pattern were fairly authentic; more so certainly than the young German actor, Horst Buchholz, endeavoring to find a southwestern/Texan/Mexican drawl. Director, John Sturges, had great hopes for Horst; the camera loved him. But it was the trio of studs, Steve McQueen as Vin, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, and James Coburn as Britt, that dominated the frame.Steve McQueen, wearing skin-tight leather stovepipe chaps, spent a lot of time finding ways to upstage Yul Brynner. There was a rumor that he would have preferred playing Chico, the Buchholz character. McQueen's manic physical performance, lightning fast with a pistol and a quip, seemed to work well for him, and it gave him more than his share of focus. His Vin emerged as lethal, lean, and hungry; yet weary of the gunfighter's plight, and envious of the simplicity and the honor of the peasants fighting for their families and their homes.James Coburn, as Britt, was laconic and dangerous, and living on the edge of his blade; competing mostly with himself for the next big thrill. Coburn got the part he wanted, and though he was given minimal dialogue, his deliveries were classic. This set the mold for his future career.Charles Bronson as Bernardo O'Reilly, half-Irish, half Mexican, was solid as a rock; an experienced stone killer, and yet still a soft touch for the children of the village. His death scene touched us. He found the pulse of his character, and he was both dangerous and decent.Robert Vaughn, as Lee, seemed uncomfortable and lost. His part had been rewritten, and expanded for him. Yet he seemed ill-suited for the part, and the genre. Even his costume seemed ill-fitting. Part of the problem was that his characters' inability to participate in the first couple of firefights left us with little sympathy for him. Later then, in his scene with the peasants, in which he admitted his fear, the emotions seemed forced and poorly conceived. His last moment heroics and death did little to balance the scales.Brad Dexter was nearly invisible. He is the one actor in trivia games no one can remember. His character, Harry Luck, with twice the dialogue as Coburn, paled in comparison. Part of it was Dexter himself. He was a bland, middle-of-the-road, B-Movie heavy, and it was odd to cast him, and thrust him in amongst all of those young turks. He did a credible job, but he was completely outshined by the future super stars.Vladimir Sokoloff, as the village's ""old man"", gave such a wonderful and touching performance, one did not realize the actor was not Latino. Like Eli Wallach, his talent as an actor transcended ethnic boundaries.John Sturges, a veteran director of westerns, found just the right balance of action and character. Mexican farmers substituted fine for the original Japanese farmers. And brigands, or bandits, are cut from the same nasty mold no matter what the era, or geography. Kurosawa's classic runs like 3 hours in length, and it gave us much more in-depth character development; so that when these samurai began to die, we cared about them. In 1959, when SEVEN was filmed, three hour westerns were a non-existant species. Elmer Bernstein's musical score was revolutionary, and its pounding stacatto beat has become one of the most recognized pieces of music ever created for film.This western, always listed in the top 50 best westerns, is a must-see.

420969,A7Y6AVS576M03,630442972X,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.",5,The Magnificent Seven,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,3635,"['believe', 'nature', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'gunfighters', 'motives', 'one', 'chance', 'gallantry', 'redemption', 'combined', 'way', 'story', 'visually', 'told', 'greatness', 'something', 'nobility', 'dignity', 'devotion', 'hearse-ride', 'taken', 'up', 'Boot', 'Hill', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'driving', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'riding', 'shotgun', 'sets', 'stage', 'tone', 'entire', 'film', 'Images', 'such', 'when', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'bent', 'bullet', 'inside', 'three', 'little', 'Mexican', 'boys', 'clutch', 'crying', 'out', 'name', 'death', 'throes', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'viewer', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'lifeless', 'James', 'Coburn', 'knife', 'adobe', 'wall', 'folds', 'gently', 'hand', 'are', 'heart', 'rendering', 'indelible', 'images', 'Even', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'bandit', 'Calvera', 'moment', 'pathos', 'being', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'bullet', 'Calvera', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'seven', 'came', 'back', 'save', 'village', 'even', 'villagers', 'told', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'help', 'anymore', 'came', 'back', 'man', 'Why', 'Calvera', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'answer', 'was', 'Brynner', 'had', 'committed', 'sacrilege.Director', 'John', 'Sturges', 'captured', 'ambiguities', 'human', 'spirit', 'film.For', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'was', 'epitome', 'cool', 'aplomb', 'dark', 'gray', 'black', 'outfit', 'tip', 'thin', 'cheroot', 'was', 'kind', 'man', 'others', 'look', 'up', 'keep', 'distance', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Chris', 'was', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'often', 'communicated', 'mere', 'gesture', 'hand', 'seven', 'was', 'cohesive', 'element', 'drew', 'together', 'simply', 'demeanor', 'aura', 'worldliness', 'beckoned', 'place', 'was', 'heading', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'recognize', 'Brynner', 'too', 'was', 'cohesive', 'element', 'kept', 'together', 'Brynner', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'followed', 'unwritten', 'code', 'honor', 'only', 'alluded', 'few', 'passages', 'McQueen', 'was', 'perfect', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'drifting', 'signed', 'Brynner', 'levelheaded', 'McQueen', 'other', 'characters', 'realizations', 'one', 'one', 'join', 'James', 'Coburn', 'was', 'perfect', 'stoic', 'knife', 'throwing', 'Britt', 'who', 'lived', 'only', 'thrill', 'moment', 'Charles', 'Bronson', ""O'Reilly"", 'played', 'stoically', 'rugged', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'better', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'Bronson', 'had', 'unique', 'visual', 'presence', 'kind', 'facial', 'expressions', 'counterbalanced', 'pockmark', 'face', 'strong', 'physique', 'Bronson', 'was', 'conundrum', 'unto', 'perfect', 'role', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'performance', 'unlucky', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'gone', 'unrecognized', 'was', 'least', 'noble', 'seven', 'died', 'mercenary', 'end', 'Still', 'gains', 'sympathy', 'returning', 'clutch', 'friend', 'Chris', 'turn', 'killed', 'Dying', 'arms', 'friend', 'Chris', 'go', 'grave', 'lie', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'seven', 'enigmatic', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'tormented', 'soul', 'not', 'really', 'coward', 'labeled', 'somehow', 'never', 'stood', 'out', 'Only', 'act', 'redemption', 'gun', 'play', 'death', 'finale', 'lingers', 'Vaughn', 'portrayal', 'success', 'said', 'was', 'coward', 'hiding', 'out', 'middle', 'battlefield', 'succeeded', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'gave', 'energetic', 'bravura', 'performance', 'only', 'one', 'seven', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'corrupted', 'world', 'end', 'symbolically', 'guns', 'up', 'up', 'sleeves', 'Brynner', 'McQueen', 'say', 'only', 'farmers', 'have', 'won', 'lost', 'ride', 'off', 'screen', 'immortality', 'think', 'won']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

Our opinions may jump quickly at these differences, but we must recognize the style of the era and the technology up to the era as well. In Sturges' The Magnificent Seven, an all-star cast is assembled to bring the Seventh Samurai in a western setting. The ones that stand out are Yul Brynner as Chris, the Bald-Headed leader that still carries himself like a king. He never takes his hat off and doesn't break a sweat. Steve Mcqueen in an earlier role is memorable as well with his non-verbal acting. To me though, Eli Wallach shines as Calvera the ""heel"" with more liberty to exhibit more flair than the rest of the cast. He plays his role so good that in the end, I always root for him.This DVD has additional features such as the making of the movie and trailers and commentary. I think what interesting that is featured in the making of portion, is the little conflict between Brynner and Mcqueen.

Based on a Japanese movie that became this movie. Yul Brynner is the star & boss of the seven. I'm not sure who did the casting but, in some ways, this was brilliant casting  so brilliant. Brynner was a good actor but sometimes a tad stiff, he hadn't done a western yet at this point in his career, but I haven't ever felt he was miscast. Steve McQueen was simply brilliant in his role, already a veteran of westerns via Wanted: Dead or Alive. McQueen was great delivering a line or, as he did in many instances, great at the nuances of body language communication. Horst Buchholz, a German actor, was miscast in his role (Hollywood ever searching for international actors to put in a movie). Other actors in this movie, some soon-to-be stars include: Charles Bronson (well cast), James Coburn (well cast), Eli Wallach (brilliant), Robert Vaughn (not good) & Brad Dexter (worse).I won't go into details of the plot, others have already done that, & this movie should be recognized by most, it is, after all, one of the most aired movies on television. This is a widescreen version with extras that includes commentaries, interviews & a documentary. John Sturges directed, an excellent choice, & already had a dozen or more westerns to his credit. Elmer Bernstein (The Great Escape) did the music; along with previous mentioned movie, are among the greatest soundtracks ever done for movies.

Every repeat viewing leaves me with the same feelings all over again; good CAN triumph over evil, even though the good may at first appear to take ominous forms, as in this wonderfully told and superbly acted film.  The sensitivity to the farmer's plight and the selflessness displayed as the seven defend the farmers and their poor village and defeat the marauding force headed by Calvera are an inspiration to all those who are not able or capable of defending themselves against evil.  And what an exciting preview this film was back in 1960 as to the incredible careers that were about to spring forth for so many of the ensemble castmembers.  To see the young, fresh faces of so many up-and-coming stars, such as James Coburn, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Horst Bucholz and Robert Vaughn, along with the already established Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach and Brad Dexter is a delight each and every time I view it.  Great (and ancient) storyline, fine acting, beautifully rugged locations, superb music and great pacing make this baby a gem for all times, and all generations.  There are serious, poignant moments..., humorous moments..., and outstandingly filmed and acted action moments....  Yes, matters were settled by guns in those days of border disputes and marauding bands of thieves, but that is how it was, and all involved in this beauty didn't flinch for even a moment in portraying that.

It is sharp and crisp. The colors are all there and they are so vibrant! You can even see the black material of Yul Brynner's shirt! It's just incredible. For sound you can go with the original mono or select the re-mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 discrete stereo mix. That is really a matter for one's taste in listening. However, it is this print that has an emotional effect on one. If you are one of those people who really loved this film since you were a kid this DVD is an emotional experience. Our heroes never looked better. Their cause never seemed nobler. Their catharsis never seemed more moving. When life's odds are against you just look back on this picture. I know I have and it has given me the strength to go on. The ""Making of..."" documentary that comes on this disc is very welcome. It always seemed that production information on this film has been very sparse. Now you get most of the story, at least as well as the surviving cast and crew remembers it. As much as the other six tried, they could never upstage Yul Brynner. He possessed a screen presence that none of the others had no matter how good they were at their performances. Yul Brynner still makes this picture and his character stands for what THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is all about.As an addendum I wish they could have released a ""Making of..."" documentary on the RETURN OF THE SEVEN DVD. That would be a very interesting documentary on just how the dark nature of that film came about.

McQueen teamed up with each of these actors during his career as he did with director John Sturges.THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is one of the epic westerns of days gone by.

Visually stunning with a great cast, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an all time American classic.There definitely was some interesting casting in this film with Eli Wallach and young German actor Horst Buchholz both playing Mexicans. Young and good-looking with a slight accent of indistinguishable origin made the German actor believable as Chico - one of the seven.MAGNIFENT SEVEN sets good versus evil. It's a morality play to the fullest degree. The gunslingers maybe tough but they have hearts and souls.

That will not last forever. So the rhythm is still slow and the picture is often centered on the faces and the general attitudes or postures of the characters. The story is simple though: the good suffering and submissive Mexicans or Indians who work hard, the banditos who exploit these farmers and the Yankee mercenaries who are going around fighting for the good cause of work and freedom. They are seven and only three will survive and two come back. They risk their lives for nearly nothing, twenty dollars, but for the sake of adventure and to prove they are the best shots, the best human beings, the best planners. The twist in this film is that they are successful first, then defeated and then successful again. That proves the point. They are ready to die to defend human decency, human freedom, justice, and to teach with their death how to fight, resist and conquer one's own freedom. A very light touch of romance is added, just enough to prove the point that man loves freedom and justice more than anything else.

From a terrific story line, great cast, wonderful music score this movie is simply the best.I first saw it as a little kid and have watched it a number of times since.  It's the values that it portrays and the character that it inspires that makes it such an enduring classic for me.  It's about a small village in Mexico that's being terrorized by a bad guy named Calvera and his 40 honchos.  The villagers don't know what to do being poor peasants, so they head north to the U.S. to buy guns for themselves.  They meet Brit (Yul Brynner) and Ben (Steve McQueen) who advise them to hire men instead.  Gunslingers are cheaper than guns....  So they approach Brit, who goes on to assemble a crew (total of 7) to head down south.  The money offered for the job is very little, but it's everything the villagers have.  Brit is moved, having been offered a lot of money in the past, but never everything - that's just one of the many great lines from the movie.  They get down to the village and end up squaring off with Calvera and his men in a great showdown.There are many wonderful line and wonderful ideas portrayed in the movie. One other great idea is uttered by Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) who is admired (and followed everywhere) by several local boys.  One day they tell Bernardo that their fathers are cowards, because they are afraid to fight Calvera.  However, nothing could prepare them for Bernardo's reaction - he spanks the kid and gives them all a lecture.  Their fathers are not cowards because they had the courage to raise families and work hard for them day in and day out.  Then he says that he himself (Bernardo) is coward as he's never had the courage to start a family and settle down.  ""Shooting is easy"" he say to the surprised boys.

Contrary to Clint Eastwood&#65533;s Unforgiven, this film shows the gunslinger with his own since of honor even when his way of life is on the wane.A small, Mexican farming village is being tormented by a bandito with his small army of about forty men.  After being raided, the village men decide to cross the border and buy guns to defend themselves.In America, the village committee sees a couple of gunslingers stand up to drive a coffin to the local cemetery.  The townfolk were prepared to stop them due to the dead man&#65533;s race.  Rather than do this for money, the gunslingers due it for the challenge and because it is right.  These are the men the villagers want.The next chunk of the movie is the recruiting of gunslingers.  None of them seem to fit into this new world; for example, Charles Bronson&#65533;s character is chopping wood to earn his breakfast whereas he used to get hundreds of dollars for gunslinging jobs.The last part of the movie is the seven gunslingers helping to train the villagers and to fight with them.

Calvera and his bandits steal food from a Mexican farm and leave the people on it to starve. The farmers hire seven gunmen from the U.S.A. to fight off Calvera and his gang. The Magnificent Seven is one of the most enjoyable Westerns ever made. In the years to come, Westerns slowly became dark, violent, and devoid of hope. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly(1967) and Heaven's Gate(1980) are good examples. Westerns weren't fun again until Silverado(1985). Elmer Bernstein's music score for The Magnificent Seven is a classic, too. I own the music score on 7 or 8 different CD's. Bernstein was also a good sport about writing music for the sequels. Elmer Bernstein's Magnificent Seven theme music can be heard in The Magnificent Seven TV series made in 1998. Bernstein's Magnificent Seven theme can be heard on Simpsons episodes, Fahrenheit 9/11(2004), The Ringer(2005), and more.Bad Manners performed a ""ska flavored"" cover of the Magnificent Seven theme! The Three Amigos(1987) is a spoof of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and crew went down to Mexico to film the whole movie.

While an interesting tidbit, this will be largely irrelevant to those who haven't seen the original.  Here we see Yul Brynner gather a band of seven gunmen that include Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn for the purpose of defending a small village in rural Mexico.  The village is threatened by a large band of outlaws led by Eli Wallach in one of the most memorable roles of his career.  The seven gunmen are an unlikely bunch of heroes but for reasons of their own, they choose to risk life and limb for ridiculously low pay.This movie was produced and directed by John Sturges.  Sturges was quite an accomplished director who was responsible forThe Great EscapeandBad Day at Black Rockamong others.  He must have enjoyed working with several of these actors as he used them again a few years later in The Great Escape and put them to equally good use.  In the Magnificent Seven, he did a masterful job maintaining the pace of the film as well as getting the most out of the all-star cast.  At the same time, perhaps he should be commended even more on his eye for talent, as most of the actors were not yet movie stars at the time this was made.  While I don't often mention the music when discussing movies, the score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most memorable of all time whether you are discussing westerns or movies in general.The Magnificent Seven is... well, magnificent.  A great director at the top of his game harnessed a cast to die for and got the most out of them.  The story is timeless and the themes translated beautifully from the original Japanese film.

'Once Upon a Time in the West' runs a close fourth ... and 'Silverado' is right behind that one.The current copy of M7 is my fourth. We've worn out 2 VHS copies and a full-screen DVD.  It plays beautifully on the widescreen set. The detail is amazing compared to the old days of VHS on a 21"" screen. How we lasted that long with a small screen is a wonder...The first time I saw M7 was in the late 60s. I curled up with my grandfather in his recliner on a Saturday evening and we devoured bowls of popcorn and pretzels with the occasional sausage pizza. [Remember 'Saturday Night at the Movies' which used to run on prime-time TV?] We had a standing date every weekend, provided the movie was worth watching. It is one of my favorite memories of time spent with him - that and Yankee baseball.I've watched it so many times, I could probably quote each role.BUT - this issue/copy I noticed an error ... whoever wrote the liner notes goofed.

Everyone else never even ends up at the DVD's page at all.This film is a very close remake of the great classic &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; by Akira Kurosawa (also available on DVD from Amazon).I noticed that most of the long, elaborate reviews don't even mention this, and most of the story elements that they praise are actually also found in the original.For the most part, this remake adds very little to the original.  The acting here is mostly wooden, although that seems to be the norm for Westerns.  Most of the more complex material, such as the relationship between the village girl and the samurai (gunslinger), has been removed for the Hollywood remake, leaving just a smattering of philosophical mutterings about the difference between being a gunslinger and a farmer.For the first two-thirds of the film, it follows very closely the story line of the original.  But then, when it begins to diverge - in order to shorten the story and simplify it for a wider audience - the carefully constructed plausibility of the original is lost, and we end up with a completely implausible ending, both in terms of motivation, and in terms of tactics and strategy.The original &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; goes to great lengths to create a plausible scenario of how seven men could have a chance at defending a village against 40 bandits.  In typical Hollywood fashion, this is thrown out in favor of the typical nonsense whereby protagonists can shoot and kill all bad guys without aiming, whereas bad guys can never hit anything, no matter how many hundreds of times they shoot.The lengths gone to accomodate Western stereotypes hit a peak, when in a very poor village with open-air rooms and few walls, when our heroes are attacked, they find themselves in a house with glass windows - since it is obviously required that gunslingers must knock out a window in order to shoot back!  Of course, to ship these windows thousand of miles would have cost more than the worth of the whole village....I suppose plausibility has never been a feature of most Westerners, but I have to be dismayed with how the careful construction of the original film has been dispensed with in this remake.Nevertheless, I give this film 3 stars because it is well made, and those who love Westerns will certainly want to see it.But those who are more wide ranging film fans are advised to instead rent or buy the original &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; by Akira Kurosawa.PS  Other films inspired by The Seven Samurai, include &quot;Battle Beyond The Stars&quot; where this story is mixed with the Star Wars story (and Robert Vaughn reprises his Magnificent Seven role);  &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; where ant villagers are attacked by grasshopper bandits, and the classic Hindi film &quot;Sholay&quot; (starring the world's most famous actor Amitabh) where only two gunslingers defend the villagers from the bandits.",3,Certainly Overrated - especially if compared to the original,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,3030,"['tendency', 'customer', 'reviews', 'item', 'be', 'mostly', 'adoring', 'fan', 'accolades', 'else', 'few', 'bitter', 'pans', 'disappointed', 'Everyone', 'else', 'never', 'even', 'up', 'DVD', 'page', 'all.This', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'remake', 'great', 'classic', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'Amazon', '.I', 'noticed', 'most', 'long', 'elaborate', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'most', 'story', 'elements', 'praise', 'are', 'actually', 'also', 'found', 'original.For', 'most', 'part', 'remake', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'acting', 'here', 'mostly', 'wooden', 'be', 'norm', 'Westerns', 'Most', 'more', 'complex', 'material', 'such', 'relationship', 'village', 'girl', 'samurai', 'gunslinger', 'been', 'removed', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'leaving', 'just', 'smattering', 'philosophical', 'mutterings', 'difference', 'being', 'gunslinger', 'farmer.For', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'very', 'closely', 'story', 'line', 'original', 'then', 'when', 'diverge', 'order', 'shorten', 'story', 'simplify', 'wider', 'audience', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'plausibility', 'original', 'lost', 'end', 'up', 'completely', 'implausible', 'ending', 'terms', 'motivation', 'terms', 'tactics', 'strategy.The', 'original', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'great', 'lengths', 'create', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'how', 'seven', 'men', 'could', 'have', 'chance', 'defending', 'village', '40', 'bandits', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'thrown', 'out', 'favor', 'typical', 'nonsense', 'whereby', 'protagonists', 'can', 'shoot', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'aiming', 'whereas', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'never', 'hit', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'hundreds', 'times', 'shoot.The', 'lengths', 'gone', 'accomodate', 'Western', 'stereotypes', 'hit', 'peak', 'when', 'very', 'poor', 'village', 'open-air', 'rooms', 'few', 'walls', 'when', 'heroes', 'are', 'attacked', 'find', 'house', 'glass', 'windows', 'obviously', 'required', 'gunslingers', 'must', 'knock', 'out', 'window', 'order', 'shoot', 'back', 'course', 'ship', 'windows', 'thousand', 'miles', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'more', 'worth', 'whole', 'village', 'suppose', 'plausibility', 'never', 'been', 'feature', 'most', 'Westerners', 'have', 'be', 'dismayed', 'how', 'careful', 'construction', 'original', 'film', 'been', 'dispensed', 'remake.Nevertheless', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'well', 'made', 'who', 'love', 'Westerns', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'see', 'it.But', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'wide', 'ranging', 'film', 'fans', 'are', 'advised', 'instead', 'rent', 'buy', 'original', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa.PS', 'Other', 'films', 'inspired', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'include', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Stars', 'quot', 'where', 'story', 'mixed', 'Star', 'Wars', 'story', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'role', 'quot', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'quot', 'where', 'ant', 'villagers', 'are', 'attacked', 'grasshopper', 'bandits', 'classic', 'Hindi', 'film', 'quot', 'Sholay', 'quot', 'starring', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'actor', 'Amitabh', 'where', 'only', 'two', 'gunslingers', 'defend', 'villagers', 'bandits']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

421033,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,630442972X,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 7]","It's said that Akiro Kurosawa studied the themes of American Westerns in preparation for creating his classic THE SEVEN SAMURAI. If that is true, then John Sturges' Hollywood remake, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, is a prodigal child come home.The Magnificent Seven are recruited by a group of Mexican villagers to protect them against the depredations of the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his gang. Wallach finds the heart of Calvera's character in just a few short scenes, being alternately cruel, ironic, and deprecating. Despite sounding a bit like a Brooklyn version of Pancho Villa, Wallach does a splendid job.The leader of the Magnificent Seven is Chris (Yul Brynner), the quintessential ""Man in Black."" Nothing fazes Chris who remains rock steady and remote throughout the film. The rest of the cast is a veritable Who's Who of graduates from the Clenched Jaw School of Acting. Steve McQueen is Vin, a jaded, but slightly wry gunfighter who yearns for a settled life. James Coburn is Britt, laconic to the point of sphinxism, who is a dangerous as a snake with both knife and gun. Charles Bronson is Bernardo O'Reilly, stolid, deadly, and unaccountably gentle. Robert Vaughn is Lee, the Riverboat Gambler gunslinger who has secretly lost his nerve. Brad Dexter, the only unremembered actor in the cast, plays Harry Luck, avaricious but principled. And Horst Buchholz plays Chico, the Young Turk, upstart, and boy-into-man with a chip on his shoulder, who admires the rest and strives to live up to them. At first excluded from the group, Chico slowly proves his mettle, and in the end matures past his need to prove anything.The acting quality is uniformly excellent. The implicit toughness and uniform taciturnity of the actors set a standard for Westerns that later films have never exceeded. Scored with now-legendary music by Elmer Bernstein (aka ""The Marlboro Man Theme"") and shot on location in Mexico, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was released just as Westerns were falling into decline.

Director John Sturges makes this western the way they are suppose to be made: lots of tough guys; lots of shooting; and not too much talking.  Brynner and McQueen meet in a small town, they are both drifters and hired guns, they team up to drive a hearse to a graveyard.  The catch is the dead guy they are driving is an indian and the locals don't want him burried in their cemetary.  Witnessing their display of heroism is a group of farmers from a nearby village.  They are being annually robbed by the same man and are looking to find help to stand up to him.  They hire Brynner who signs on McQueen and eventaully five other guys to make up the Magnificent Seven.  Once assembled they travel to the village and make plans to put up a fight when he arrives.

Once more you have a group of actors that carried themselves in a way that guys envied them their confidence but that women thought were darn good to look at. The main thing that this film began though (and which carried over to my first ""man movie"" THE DIRTY DOZEN) was that it took a single individual who gathered together a small team to confront an enemy. It would be great to say that this was original to this film but the fact is that it was a remake of a successful Japanese film called THE SEVEN SAMURAI.Yul Brynner stars as Chris Adams, a gunfighter with a conscious. When he hears of a group of poor Mexican farmers seeking aid in getting rid of a bandit that terrorizes their town and takes whatever they want, he accepts their proposition. With little or no money on hand (the farmers have little of value now), Chris sets out to recruit his team and he starts with Vin (Steve McQueen), another cowpoke who happened to be in the right place at the wrong time.The two set out to fill in their group visiting other men that Chris has come across at one time or another, each with his own reason for joining or for fleeing their present situation. Britt (James Coburn) has just killed a man with his knife throwing skills in a fair fight that is sure to be questioned. Harry (Brad Dexter) thinks there is hidden gold in the village because what other reason would Chris have for taking on this task? Lee (Robert Vaughan) is a gunslinger looking for a peaceful place to live a quiet life if only for a while. Bernardo (Charles Bronson) sees it as an opportunity. And Chico (Horst Bucholtz) is a youngster who wants to make a name for himself, a boy who has yet to witness death but wants to stake his claim to it.The team assembled, they head for the village and begin training the men of the village how to defend themselves. They set up traps, show them how to use guns and teach them that they'll have to assist in defending themselves if they want the help of these professionals.Eventually the bandits return expecting little or no problem. Instead they confront the seven for the first time. The bandit leader is Calvera (Eli Wallach) and he respects the seven but warns them that to stand in his way will result in death. Chris and his crew stand their ground and refuse to leave, choosing instead to defend the town they've been paid little to protect.Once more we have a movie that is so well thought out and directed, in this case by John Sturges, that not a single moment watched unfold is wasted. Rather than focus on the panoramic vistas offered in most films, we frequently find ourselves in the poor dirt covered village. The heroes we watch are not the typical sort but ones who are flawed in one way or another. This was the beginnings of the anti-hero movement that sprang in the sixties, heroes that were not perfect in every way.Once more a group of exciting and popular actors was assembled in to one production. Films like these would be impossible to pull off these days due to the contract and financial demands of those involved. The closest anyone has come has been the OCEAN'S ELEVEN films.THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN led to several sequels and eventually in 1999 to a short run TV series. The noble defense of the small town displays a sense of honor that characters rarely show these days. And in that demonstration of honor we have another piece of what is a part of ""man movies"".",5,MAN MOVIES: THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,3495,"['film', 'high', 'list', 'man', 'movies', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'Once', 'more', 'have', 'group', 'actors', 'carried', 'way', 'guys', 'envied', 'confidence', 'women', 'thought', 'were', 'darn', 'good', 'look', 'main', 'thing', 'film', 'began', 'carried', 'first', 'man', 'movie', 'THE', 'DIRTY', 'DOZEN', 'was', 'took', 'single', 'individual', 'who', 'gathered', 'together', 'small', 'team', 'confront', 'enemy', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'say', 'was', 'original', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'remake', 'successful', 'Japanese', 'film', 'called', 'THE', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI.Yul', 'Brynner', 'Chris', 'Adams', 'gunfighter', 'conscious', 'When', 'group', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'farmers', 'seeking', 'aid', 'getting', 'rid', 'bandit', 'town', 'want', 'proposition', 'little', 'money', 'hand', 'farmers', 'have', 'little', 'value', 'now', 'Chris', 'out', 'recruit', 'team', 'Vin', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'cowpoke', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'wrong', 'time.The', 'two', 'set', 'out', 'fill', 'group', 'visiting', 'other', 'men', 'Chris', 'come', 'one', 'time', 'own', 'reason', 'joining', 'fleeing', 'present', 'situation', 'Britt', 'James', 'Coburn', 'just', 'killed', 'man', 'knife', 'throwing', 'skills', 'fair', 'fight', 'sure', 'be', 'questioned', 'Harry', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'hidden', 'gold', 'village', 'what', 'other', 'reason', 'would', 'Chris', 'have', 'taking', 'task', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Vaughan', 'gunslinger', 'looking', 'peaceful', 'place', 'live', 'quiet', 'life', 'only', 'while', 'Bernardo', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'opportunity', 'Chico', 'Horst', 'Bucholtz', 'youngster', 'who', 'make', 'name', 'boy', 'who', 'yet', 'witness', 'death', 'stake', 'claim', 'it.The', 'team', 'assembled', 'head', 'village', 'begin', 'training', 'men', 'village', 'how', 'defend', 'set', 'up', 'traps', 'show', 'how', 'use', 'guns', 'teach', ""'ll"", 'have', 'assist', 'defending', 'want', 'help', 'professionals.Eventually', 'bandits', 'return', 'expecting', 'little', 'problem', 'Instead', 'confront', 'seven', 'first', 'time', 'bandit', 'leader', 'Calvera', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'seven', 'stand', 'way', 'will', 'result', 'death', 'Chris', 'crew', 'stand', 'ground', 'refuse', 'leave', 'choosing', 'instead', 'defend', 'town', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paid', 'little', 'protect.Once', 'more', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'directed', 'case', 'John', 'Sturges', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'watched', 'unfold', 'wasted', 'Rather', 'focus', 'panoramic', 'vistas', 'offered', 'most', 'films', 'frequently', 'find', 'poor', 'dirt', 'covered', 'village', 'heroes', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'sort', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'flawed', 'one', 'way', 'was', 'beginnings', 'anti-hero', 'movement', 'sprang', 'sixties', 'heroes', 'were', 'not', 'perfect', 'way.Once', 'more', 'group', 'exciting', 'popular', 'actors', 'was', 'assembled', 'one', 'production', 'Films', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'pull', 'off', 'days', 'due', 'contract', 'financial', 'demands', 'involved', 'closest', 'anyone', 'come', 'been', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'films.THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'led', 'several', 'sequels', 'eventually', '1999', 'short', 'run', 'TV', 'series', 'noble', 'defense', 'small', 'town', 'displays', 'sense', 'honor', 'characters', 'rarely', 'show', 'days', 'demonstration', 'honor', 'have', 'piece', 'what', 'part', 'man', 'movies']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

The willingness to stand for what we believe in even when its not our fortunes on the line.  And to watch the changes as the fight to survive pushes everyone to show their true nature.

421052,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,630442972X,Marty Gillis,"[16, 18]","I am a huge fan of Steve McQueen and as such purchasing The Magnificent Seven on Blu Ray was a no brainer for me, a true must purchase item.This movie is a classic and set a very high standard for all Westerns to come. With that said, this review is going to deal with the actual Blu Ray transfer , both video and audio , and not the plot or performances contained in it.This being another 'quickie' catalog release from MGM, a studio in bankruptcy,  I was not expecting too much here and afraid the technicians would just slather the image with tons of DNR, Edge Enhancement and call it a day.  Luckily for me and all fans of this film I was wrong! Phew!Here is the good news:  This film has not been DNR'd to death at all. I can't see any actually, and as for edge enhancement, I just don't see that either.  GREAT!  A pretty natural looking image, nothing spectacular, but solid color and an almost fully stable image. There are a few very short instances of 'image/telecine wobble' but nothing too severe and only a few times. Chances are most folks won't even notice it.Generally the image is pleasing,. Although there are SOME soft shots, a few horrible looking grainy shots, a bit of mosquito noise on certain blue sky shots and a grainy blurriness every single time the picture dissolves/fades into another scene, rather than a clean cut.  I watched this carefully and noticed that most of the video problems occur in the first 50 minutes of the film, with the remaining hour and 18 minutes being just about issue free and VERY nice to look at for a 1960 film.  Seriously, unless you are picking it apart, you will just notice a few soft grainy shots and everything else should look pretty good to you, bordering on very good.Note that this transfer is not anywhere near a reference catalog title and stands no chance of winning Blu Ray release of the year or anything like that. I absolutely think most video reviews on name brand reviewer sites have inflated the video quality of this transfer. It was no where near as good as I was expecting, but then again no where near as bad either! Did I enjoy watching it? YOU BET!  I can honestly say this is the very best this film has looked in home release format. EVER! Period!The sound fares better than the picture I think.  A decent DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 track is your only option.  Basically this film is front heavy and center heavy. Every now and then you might get a gunshot or ricochet in a surround speaker, but most all the action and sound takes place up front and in the center channel.  On the other hand, there is more LFE for your Sub than you would expect.  Only a few lines of dialogue here and there were hard for me to hear, even with my surround system cranked up a bit.  Most of it is clear as a bell with both music and sound effects sounding fine.  I ran into a small segment towards the end where the audio/video sync was off. It was not my system and I could duplicate it multiple times with the problem always occurring in the same spot.  When Charles Bronson paddles the kids behind, you see it, then hear the whack whack whack!  Since the mouths are moving BEFORE the sound, the delay adjustment on your receiver will be useless. Fortunately, this disappears in a few minutes as if it had never happened and mouths and words match up once again. I have only ran into an actual disc/audio problem once before and that was on the last Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool.  I am convinced that both discs have some sort of authoring problem that causes this.**If you see the same sequence and the sound IS in synch please write a comment on my review so I know it is my gear and not the disc. Thanks.There is a pretty nice selection of extras on this disc.  Most come directly ported over from the 2 DVD collectors set.  The audio commentary is particularly good, with stars James Coburn and Eli Wallach, plus the producer and assistant director. Not bad and at times quite entertaining and informative.  When I really love a movie I tend to eat this stuff up and this was no exception. Also included is a very nice 46 minute 'making of' type documentary that offers lots of good stories and trivia. Another 15 minute documentary on composer Elmer Bernstein's score, and yet another shorter 'making of' piece called 'The linen Book'.  Add to all of that two trailers and you can see this is a pretty hefty offering for bonus features.The Magnificent Seven was a big hit, first in Europe and then in America. It is still revered today by both classic film buffs and Western genre fans. I love it because it launched Steve McQueen into stardom. It has a lot of appeal that works on many different levels. The score in particular is as rousing and inspirational as has ever been heard in a Western and all by itself it is an American Icon. You immediately conjure visions of the Old West and wide open spaces when you hear this music.  Add an all star cast and great direction from John Sturges and you get one heck of a Western and one heck of a movie, period!

Everyone knows the story, which is elegant in its simplicity: seven hired gunmen travel to Mexico to defend a small community of farmers against a  predatory gang that outnumbers them about 10 to 1.The acting is beyond great.  Steve McQueen, the epitome of cool, steals every scene he's in. James Coburn and Robert Vaughn do justice to the script. Even characters who have only a few lines, like some of the villagers, are well-developed.The leader of the Seven is Yul Brynner, as graceful as a panther and with a kind of Zen thing going on. The leader of the villagers is the Old Man, fellow Russian Vladimir Sokoloff. I guess you could also count Charles Bronson as part of that little ""Bloc"" vibe--at that point in his career, he wasn't far removed from his early life as Charlie Buchinsky, child of recent immigrants.

This was a pivotal point in their career; except for Brynner that was well know by that time.All of them flesh their characters with great skill, depicting a hardboiled bunch.The story is a transposition of Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" from middle ages' Japan to America's South West. Nothing is loosed with the change. All the film breathes an epic struggle. A small Mexican village is periodically harassed by bandits. The villagers are nearing starvation and desperation but they have no fighting skills to defend themselves. So as a last resort they decide to hire ""protection"".Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) is able to round up a group of border ""desperados"" to put a stop, against overwhelming odds, to the marauders leaded by Calvera (an anthological Eli Wallach).A real treat for western's & action fans, but also for those who want to see an unforgettable ""Classic"".Enjoy the trip!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Seven Icons Riding South West.,1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,1401,"['film', 'director', 'John', 'Sturges', 'done', 'several', 'great', 'action', 'movies', 'Ice', 'Station', 'Zebra', '1968', 'Eagle', 'Has', 'Landed', '1976', 'one', 'so', 'good', 'compelling', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', '1960', 'Great', 'Escape', '1963', '.These', 'two', 'earned', 'well', 'deserved', 'reputation.This', 'film', 'profits', 'great', 'characterizations', 'performed', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'was', 'pivotal', 'point', 'career', 'Brynner', 'was', 'well', 'know', 'time.All', 'flesh', 'characters', 'great', 'skill', 'depicting', 'hardboiled', 'bunch.The', 'story', 'transposition', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'middle', 'ages', 'Japan', 'America', 'South', 'West', 'Nothing', 'loosed', 'change', 'film', 'epic', 'struggle', 'small', 'Mexican', 'village', 'periodically', 'harassed', 'bandits', 'villagers', 'are', 'nearing', 'starvation', 'desperation', 'have', 'fighting', 'skills', 'defend', 'So', 'last', 'resort', 'decide', 'hire', 'protection', '.Chris', 'Adams', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'able', 'round', 'up', 'group', 'border', 'desperados', 'put', 'stop', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'marauders', 'leaded', 'Calvera', 'anthological', 'Eli', 'Wallach', '.A', 'real', 'treat', 'western', 'action', 'fans', 'also', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'unforgettable', 'Classic', 'trip', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

The music in this film is as recognizable as the main theme from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Anyway, this is a must have if you like classical cinema.Its a remake of Seven Samurai, from Akira Kurosawa and tells a story about a mexican village that was being blackmailed by a band of forajidos (you will recognize their leader immediately). The villagers go to the US-Mexican border seeking for guns but insted of buying them they decide to hire a gunman to help them get rid of the bandits. This gunman recruits six guys with unique skills. Of the magnificent seven (MS), six were on for pride and honor, and only one was for the money.From there on, the MS helped the villagers by training them for the final combat against the bandidos.

You know the score. You know it's got Yul and McQueen, and five other guys you need to know for trivia contests.But actually sitting down and seeing for the first time was such an unadulterated joy, I had a dumb little smile on my face for nearly two whole hours.Here's some things I didn't know or realize:1) All seven gunmen are terrific in their own way, but Eli Wallach is their equal as Calvera, the head bad guy.2) The score was one of those things ""older people"" always said was ""classic"" or ""one of the greats."" It was the film score your father loved. Hearing it in it's unfettered glory showed me one thing: no matter how much I hate to admit it, Dad was right. From frame one, Elmer Bernstein's music alone straightens your spine and lifts you up. It's cliche, but it really is a separate character element in the telling of this particular tale.3) Steve McQueen does more in a scene when he's not the focus of it. I didn't realize that until I watched the excellent documentary, but he's an absolute riot. He's ALWAYS trying to detract from somebody else's scene, fidgeting about, looking off at something. And somehow he does it in character.4) Yul Brynner walks like some regal prince, yet clad in cowboy black. And still has a strong accent. And yes, still makes it work.5) The screenplay is a jewel of understatement, pithy humor and curious (for a western) insight into the life of a gunman.Being Simon Cowell honest, it's not perfect. Horst Buchholz does ""James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause"" in a few too many scenes, but he's kinda cool in most others. There are a few clunky lines here and there. Some of the Mexican actors sound like they've never acted before in their lives. The relationship between the kids and Charles Bronson is forced and hokey.All that pales in comparison to the epic success of everything else in the film. There are dozens of classic lines and scenes, genuinely thrilling action sequences and the whole thing packs an honestly earned emotional wallop by the time the final credits run.This is a film for people who love film.",5,Really...it's like a magnificent DOZEN or so...,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,2249,"[""'m"", 'doing', 'backwards.I', ""'m"", 'guy', 'who', 'film', 'based', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'yet', 'saw', 'Bug', 'Life', 'first', 'take', 'THIS.You', 'know', 'story', 'know', 'score', 'know', 'got', 'Yul', 'McQueen', 'five', 'other', 'guys', 'need', 'know', 'trivia', 'contests.But', 'actually', 'sitting', 'down', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'such', 'unadulterated', 'joy', 'had', 'dumb', 'little', 'smile', 'face', 'nearly', 'two', 'whole', 'hours.Here', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'realize:1', 'seven', 'gunmen', 'are', 'terrific', 'own', 'way', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'equal', 'Calvera', 'head', 'bad', 'guy.2', 'score', 'was', 'one', 'things', 'older', 'people', 'always', 'said', 'was', 'classic', 'one', 'greats', 'was', 'film', 'score', 'father', 'loved', 'Hearing', 'unfettered', 'glory', 'showed', 'one', 'thing', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'hate', 'admit', 'Dad', 'was', 'right', 'frame', 'one', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'music', 'alone', 'spine', 'lifts', 'up', 'cliche', 'really', 'separate', 'character', 'element', 'telling', 'particular', 'tale.3', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'more', 'scene', 'when', 'not', 'focus', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'watched', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'absolute', 'riot', 'ALWAYS', 'trying', 'detract', 'somebody', 'else', 'scene', 'fidgeting', 'looking', 'off', 'something', 'somehow', 'character.4', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'walks', 'regal', 'prince', 'yet', 'clad', 'cowboy', 'black', 'still', 'strong', 'accent', 'yes', 'still', 'screenplay', 'jewel', 'understatement', 'pithy', 'humor', 'curious', 'western', 'insight', 'life', 'gunman.Being', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'honest', 'not', 'perfect', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'kinda', 'cool', 'most', 'others', 'are', 'few', 'clunky', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'Mexican', 'actors', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'never', 'acted', 'lives', 'relationship', 'kids', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'forced', 'hokey.All', 'pales', 'comparison', 'epic', 'success', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'are', 'dozens', 'classic', 'lines', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'thrilling', 'action', 'sequences', 'whole', 'thing', 'honestly', 'earned', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'time', 'final', 'credits', 'run.This', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'film']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

421074,ADM42VSJD4A5E,630442972X,"namepeace ""namepeace""","[22, 25]","In my opinion, The Magnificent Seven is among the best movies of all time.  It is made in the classic Western style, but perhaps due to the adaptation from the Seven Samaurai, it has a lot of the elements of modern movie  characters:  morally ambiguous anti-heroes who face a personal crossroads  but ultimately choose the right path.This movie adds new angles to the  conventional Western plot.  A group of 40 bandits led by a robust but  ruthless leader named Calvera (Eli Wallach)continously raids a poor farming  village for food and other provisions.  A group of villagers go north of  the border to enlist hired guns to protect them.  Eventually, a cool  gunslinger by the name of Chris (Yul Brynner) organizes a team of seven  able mercenaries to defend the village for a meager fee.  The group works  well together and inspires the villagers to join the fight to drive Calvera  out.  After some success, the group suffers some adversity against  considerable odds.  In the end, both the visitors and the villagers learn  about the price -- and payoff -- of resisting injustice.This movie is  truly driven by its great characters.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, who  plays Brynner's de facto lieutenant Vin,  could have likely done this movie  by themselves.  Their chemistry reminds me of Newman and Redford in Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but with a drier humor.  I would have loved  to have seen them in more movies together.I liked all of the Seven, but  two others really stood out.  Charles Bronson was impressive as the  hard-edged O'Reilly, and played the role with a sense of humor and warmth  without losing his stoic demeanor.  Horst Buchholz was extremely impressive  as the young gun (&quot;Chico&quot;) who goes through an identity crisis as  he is torn between the romanticism of being a gunslinger and the  contrasting ethics of his heritage.  Why wasn't he in more movies?  Eli  Wallach is superb as the boisterous, scenery-chewing Calvera, and Wallach  brings gives a sense of humor and empathy to the role which distinguishes  it from most movie villains I've seen.  The village leaders were also very  good.The style and tone of this movie reminds me of the anti-hero type  movies made in the late 60's and early 70's and the buddy/action-type  movies of the current era.  It also has two of the best cinematic gunfights  I have ever seen.  You owe it to yourself to at least see this one.  I plan  on adding The Magnificent Seven to my library and hopefully showing it to  my kids someday.",4,"This classic western movie has great action, humor and depth",956880000,"04 28, 2000",2000,2526,"['opinion', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'best', 'movies', 'time', 'made', 'classic', 'Western', 'style', 'perhaps', 'due', 'adaptation', 'Seven', 'Samaurai', 'lot', 'elements', 'modern', 'movie', 'characters', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'anti-heroes', 'who', 'face', 'personal', 'crossroads', 'ultimately', 'choose', 'right', 'path.This', 'movie', 'new', 'angles', 'conventional', 'Western', 'plot', 'group', '40', 'bandits', 'led', 'robust', 'ruthless', 'leader', 'named', 'Calvera', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'continously', 'poor', 'farming', 'village', 'food', 'other', 'provisions', 'group', 'villagers', 'go', 'north', 'border', 'enlist', 'hired', 'guns', 'protect', 'Eventually', 'cool', 'gunslinger', 'name', 'Chris', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'team', 'seven', 'able', 'mercenaries', 'defend', 'village', 'meager', 'fee', 'group', 'well', 'together', 'villagers', 'join', 'fight', 'drive', 'Calvera', 'out', 'success', 'group', 'adversity', 'considerable', 'odds', 'end', 'visitors', 'villagers', 'learn', 'price', 'payoff', 'resisting', 'injustice.This', 'movie', 'truly', 'driven', 'great', 'characters', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'who', 'Brynner', 'de', 'facto', 'lieutenant', 'Vin', 'could', 'have', 'likely', 'done', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Newman', 'Redford', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'drier', 'humor', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'movies', 'together.I', 'liked', 'Seven', 'two', 'others', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'was', 'impressive', 'hard-edged', ""O'Reilly"", 'played', 'role', 'sense', 'humor', 'warmth', 'losing', 'stoic', 'demeanor', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'young', 'gun', 'quot', 'Chico', 'quot', 'who', 'identity', 'crisis', 'torn', 'romanticism', 'being', 'gunslinger', 'contrasting', 'ethics', 'heritage', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'movies', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'superb', 'boisterous', 'scenery-chewing', 'Calvera', 'Wallach', 'sense', 'humor', 'empathy', 'role', 'most', 'movie', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'village', 'leaders', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good.The', 'style', 'tone', 'movie', 'anti-hero', 'type', 'movies', 'made', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'buddy/action-type', 'movies', 'current', 'era', 'also', 'two', 'best', 'cinematic', 'gunfights', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'owe', 'yourself', 'least', 'see', 'one', 'plan', 'adding', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'library', 'hopefully', 'showing', 'kids', 'someday']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

421077,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,630442972X,Nix Pix,"[6, 10]","&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; is based on the Japanese movie, &quot;Seventh Samari&quot;.  The updating and transmutation of the original premise - that of seven desperados out to avenge a ruthless cutthroat's stronghold on a poor community - is, for once in the business of remaking movies, totally justified.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen star as two of the seven with character actor, Eli Walsh doing a bang-up job of being the villain.  This is one thrilling western and a film that deserves a much better transfer than the one it currently has received on DVD.MGM Home Entertainment gives us a tired, worn print with faded colors and a barrage of age related blemishes - all this, while calling the disc a &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  I'd hate to see what their standard issues look like.  Oops!  I've seen them and they're nothing to write home about!  But back to this DVD.Colors can be rich and nicely balanced at times.  However, most of the movie's color scheme has suffered from the natural ravages of time.  Blacks are weak.  Browns, beiges and light grays all appear to have the same muddy texture.  Reds are slightly orange and flesh tones are not very natural.  There's a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering throughout.  Chips, scratches, dirt and tears in the original print are evident throughout.  The audio is stereo but feebly so with a forward sounding characteristic that is not terribly engaging.  Special effects sound strident.  The music is generally well represented.EXTRAS: A making-of that falls somewhere short of a full fledged documentary but too long to be considered a featurette.  A theatrical trailer and an audio commentary too.The menu for this film is pretty bad - suffering from excessive edge enhancement and aliasing problems.  Why bother?Bottom line: If you're a fan - get it.  It won't break you. Just don't expect that the term &quot;Special Edition&quot; means the film has been given any special treatment on DVD!",3,THRILLING WESTERN ADAPTATION OF JAPANESE ORIGINAL,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,1997,"['quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'based', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'quot', 'Seventh', 'Samari', 'quot', 'updating', 'transmutation', 'original', 'premise', 'seven', 'desperados', 'avenge', 'ruthless', 'cutthroat', 'stronghold', 'poor', 'community', 'once', 'business', 'remaking', 'movies', 'totally', 'justified', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'star', 'two', 'seven', 'character', 'actor', 'Eli', 'Walsh', 'doing', 'bang-up', 'job', 'being', 'villain', 'one', 'thrilling', 'western', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'transfer', 'one', 'currently', 'received', 'DVD.MGM', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'tired', 'worn', 'print', 'faded', 'colors', 'barrage', 'age', 'related', 'blemishes', 'calling', 'disc', 'quot', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quot', ""'d"", 'hate', 'see', 'what', 'standard', 'issues', 'look', 'Oops', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'back', 'DVD.Colors', 'can', 'be', 'rich', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'times', 'However', 'most', 'movie', 'color', 'scheme', 'suffered', 'natural', 'ravages', 'time', 'Blacks', 'are', 'weak', 'Browns', 'beiges', 'light', 'grays', 'appear', 'have', 'same', 'muddy', 'texture', 'Reds', 'are', 'slightly', 'orange', 'flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'natural', 'considerable', 'amount', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'fine', 'detail', 'shimmering', 'Chips', 'scratches', 'dirt', 'tears', 'original', 'print', 'are', 'evident', 'audio', 'stereo', 'feebly', 'so', 'forward', 'sounding', 'characteristic', 'not', 'terribly', 'engaging', 'Special', 'effects', 'sound', 'strident', 'music', 'generally', 'well', 'represented.EXTRAS', 'making-of', 'somewhere', 'short', 'full', 'fledged', 'documentary', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'considered', 'featurette', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'too.The', 'menu', 'film', 'pretty', 'bad', 'suffering', 'excessive', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'aliasing', 'problems', 'Why', 'bother', 'Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'fan', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'break', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'term', 'quot', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quot', 'film', 'been', 'given', 'special', 'treatment', 'DVD']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

Here are a few points to ponder:""The Magnificent Seven's"" score by Elmer Bernstein received a 1960 Oscar nomination but the award that year went to ""Exodus""; which ""featured"" something called ""The Exodus Song"" (with lyrics by Pat Boone!!). 45+ years later there is not even a CD release of ""Exodus"" while the score from ""The Magnificent Seven"" is one of the most recognized pieces of music ever written. If anyone needs proof of the staggering lameness of academy voting this is the most obvious of countless examples.The score was further popularized in the late 1960's as the theme for Marlboro cigarettes. An odd bit of irony given that Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Jorge Martinez de Hoyos all died of lung cancer; Horst Buchholz and Charles Bronson of pneumonia, and Brad Dexter of emphysema.In the film, only two (Brynner and McQueen) of the seven leave the village alive (Buchholz survives but stays behind). In real life these two actors were the first to die, preceding the others by about 20 years.The other four deaths (only Robert Vaughn is still alive) occurred over just a nine-month period (James Coburn in Nov 02, Brad Dexter in Dec 02, Horst Buchholz in March 03, and Charles Bronson in Aug 03).Then again, what do I know?

What Kurosawa did was start off with action, drums pounding, overwhelming odds... adventure.John Sturges was having a few drinks with Steve McQueen. He said lets do Kurosawa's &quot;The Seven Samurai.&quot; Steve said he was not going to run around in a dress. They agreed that Steve could wear the hat he had on in the bar, they did it as a &quot;Widescreen,&quot; Western. They called it &quot;The Magnificent Seven.&quot;There was a lot of tension on the set between the main stars. Steve was good on a horse and good with a gun.Yul Brynner if you'll notice in &quot;Invitation to a Gunfighter,&quot; and &quot;WestWorld.&quot; etc. Was not at home on a horse. His hats came from the prop room. Yule is a gentlemen gunslinger, hardly the type that goes out on the dusty road to track a man down.The soundtrack music from &quot;The Seven,&quot; forever changed what we expected from a western score. It's one of the top three with &quot;Once upon a time in the west,&quot; and Bob Dylan's &quot;Pat Garret and Billy the kid.&quot;Samurai: In the former feudal system of Japan, the class , of military retainers of the daimios, constituting the gentry or lesser nobility. They possessed power of life and death over the commoners, and wore two swords as their distinguishing mark.Gunslinger: In the former open range system of the West, the hired guns ... possessed power of life and death over the towns people, and wore two guns (usually a tied down pistol and a rifle) as their distinguishing mark.The genius was exploiting the similarities between how Japan changed, and the end of our West. Samurai's special rights and privileges were abolished with the fall of feudalism in 1871. The western gunslinger's about the time of Tom Horn at the turn of the century.Look at what we now know as western music and the original Asian music from &quot;Samurai.&quot;The &quot;Seven,&quot; is not a authentic western as is &quot;Red River,&quot; or &quot;Tom Horn.&quot; But as A1 entertainment, which is what it was meant to be, it's a work of Art.

During the later 1950s,the comedy western (as popularized by John Wayne,who went on to make dozens more comedy westerns in the 1960s and 1970s) and the 'broad scope' western (i.e. the normal western subjects were buried beneath other stories - a good example being &quot;The big country&quot;).By 1960,what was needed was a good oldstyle classic western.&quot;The magnificent seven&quot; gave us that - and more.It revitalized the whole western film theory.  The story,like that of &quot;Shane&quot;,is about farmers versus bad guys who want to rob them of their land,food and village.The village asks Chris (Yul Brynner) to help them and he then goes out to locate 6 good men to help.Many shootouts follow and 4 of the 7 die in a brave climatic fight that rids the village of the bandits who want to take it over.1 of the 7 remains in the village,while 2 ride away (and would later return with a new magnificent 7 for a sequel).

In its western adaption of the SEVEN SAMURAI it works better that the movie it adapts.  Not becasue it is a better movie per-se, that  would be a hard case to make (impossible in terms of sheer spectacle.  Its strength in comparison is based on the setting and time.  The SEVEN SAMURAI is set during a time when the SAMURAI tradition was alive, strong and would be for centuries more.  The MAGNIFICENT SEVEN works even better because these men see their gunfighting days and ways drawing to a close.  Much like THE SHOOTIST the end of a way of life and the begining of a new one is the catalyst here.  Also like THE SHOOTEST, you see Chico (HORST BUCHHORZ)enamored by the same non-reality that Gillom (RON HOWARD)does.  All of the characters have their appeal and Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen make it work.  Their first scene together is worth the picture alone.

It started a series of movies which never reached the level of the first, but thats not the purpose of a movie.

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[6, 7]","A genuine cinematic classic, The Magnificent Seven is one of the most enjoyable westerns ever to hit the screen and the stellar cast on board just make it shine ! As most any cinema fan knows, TMS was based on Akira Kurosawa's landmark &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;, albeit with a shift in setting from feudal Japan to Mexico of the old west...and six guns replacing samurai swords.This excellent release on DVD hosts a plethora of extra features with an accompanying documentary and commentary by dapper James Coburn and western bad guy Eli Wallach ( After Wallach's cold blooded portrayal of bandit leader Calvera in TMS, Sergio Leone cast him a couple of years later as the cunning gunman Tuco in &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot;. Prior to making TMS, Wallach had never ridden a horse in his life ! )Director John Sturges showed why he is a class act at well paced dramas with his great directorial style on TMS, and Elmer Bernstein's oh so catchy signature score falls right in line with the mood of the script. Bryner &amp; McQueen are outstanding as Chris and Vin, (love that opening sequence with the hearse and a panicky Whit Bissell ) with dynamic support from a youthful Charles Bronson, nervy Robert Vaughn, knife throwing James Coburn, money hungry Brad Dexter and the hot headed farmer-turned-gunslinger Horst Bucholz !!Fans of this movie will NOT be dissapointed with this fantastic offering on DVD and it's behind the scenes look at it's stars and their stories.

421094,A30I207MIU383O,630442972X,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[0, 0]","The story begins with a group of Mexican villagers being terrorized by an outlaw named Calvera, played with vigor by Eli Wallach. Calvera and his band of forty thieves steal precious food and supplies from the poor farmers, who barely have enough left to feed their families. To the credit of the film, these are not cardboard characters. They are gentle souls that are pushed to their limits and demonstrate moral courage and wisdom. The beleaguered villagers seek the help of a courageous drifter named Chris, competently played by Yul Brynner. After reluctantly accepting to help the farmers, seasoned gunslinger assembles a group of unemployed professional gunmen and adventurers. Each one of these men has their reasons for joining the fight against Calvera. However, the farmers can only pay each of their guardians the ridiculous sum of twenty-dollars, which as McQueen's character points out, ""Would barely pay for my bullets"". The small band of gunfighters exhibits bravery and commitment that galvanizes the village into a formidable fighting force. In a climatic fight sequence, the highly outnumbered seven pay a high price in blood to dispatch the evil Calvera. I have a soft spot in my heart for this film. Though not the greatest western ever made, John Sturges did a fine job Americanizing Akira Kurosawa's macho masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". It was made in 1960 at the end of the studio system era and is not as gritty as later westerns from this tumultuous decade. Such films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" would more fully realize the character of the anti-hero. That being said, two of the film actors starring in this picture turned in prototype performances for the anti-hero. One was Steve McQueen as Vin, the empathetic gunslinger, who is as quick with an analogy as he is with his peacemaker. McQueen steals nearly every scene he is in with his quirky physical gestures and effortless acting. The other notable performance is from the late James Coburn, who plays the inscrutable loner Britt. His character is lightening fast with a pistol; but in a particularly entertaining sequence, he outdraws another aspiring gunslinger armed only with his switchblade knife. As an actor, Coburn had few lines of dialogue but made the most of them and filmgoers couldn't take their eyes off of him. Charles Bronson, who plays Bernardo O'Reilly, the crusty gunfighter with the soft underbelly, ably supports these two breakthrough performers. Finally, Elmer Berstein provides one of the best film soundtracks ever written. ""The Magnificent Seven"" is solid western film fare, where the line between good and evil is clearly defined and the heroes fight with altruistic purpose.",3,Solid Western Entertainment,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,2709,"['story', 'group', 'Mexican', 'villagers', 'being', 'terrorized', 'outlaw', 'named', 'Calvera', 'played', 'vigor', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Calvera', 'band', 'forty', 'thieves', 'steal', 'precious', 'food', 'supplies', 'poor', 'farmers', 'who', 'barely', 'have', 'enough', 'left', 'feed', 'families', 'credit', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'are', 'gentle', 'souls', 'are', 'pushed', 'limits', 'demonstrate', 'moral', 'courage', 'wisdom', 'beleaguered', 'villagers', 'seek', 'help', 'courageous', 'drifter', 'named', 'Chris', 'competently', 'played', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'reluctantly', 'accepting', 'help', 'farmers', 'seasoned', 'gunslinger', 'group', 'unemployed', 'professional', 'gunmen', 'adventurers', 'one', 'men', 'reasons', 'joining', 'fight', 'Calvera', 'However', 'farmers', 'can', 'only', 'pay', 'guardians', 'ridiculous', 'sum', 'twenty-dollars', 'McQueen', 'character', 'points', 'out', 'Would', 'barely', 'pay', 'bullets', 'small', 'band', 'gunfighters', 'exhibits', 'bravery', 'commitment', 'village', 'formidable', 'fighting', 'force', 'climatic', 'fight', 'sequence', 'highly', 'outnumbered', 'seven', 'pay', 'high', 'price', 'blood', 'dispatch', 'evil', 'Calvera', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'film', 'not', 'greatest', 'western', 'ever', 'made', 'John', 'Sturges', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Americanizing', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'macho', 'masterpiece', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'was', 'made', '1960', 'end', 'studio', 'system', 'era', 'not', 'as', 'gritty', 'later', 'tumultuous', 'decade', 'Such', 'films', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'would', 'more', 'fully', 'realize', 'character', 'anti-hero', 'being', 'said', 'two', 'film', 'actors', 'starring', 'picture', 'turned', 'prototype', 'performances', 'anti-hero', 'One', 'was', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Vin', 'empathetic', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'quick', 'analogy', 'peacemaker', 'McQueen', 'steals', 'nearly', 'scene', 'quirky', 'physical', 'gestures', 'effortless', 'acting', 'other', 'notable', 'performance', 'late', 'James', 'Coburn', 'who', 'inscrutable', 'loner', 'Britt', 'character', 'lightening', 'fast', 'pistol', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'sequence', 'aspiring', 'gunslinger', 'armed', 'only', 'switchblade', 'knife', 'actor', 'Coburn', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'made', 'most', 'filmgoers', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'who', 'Bernardo', ""O'Reilly"", 'crusty', 'gunfighter', 'soft', 'underbelly', 'ably', 'two', 'breakthrough', 'performers', 'Finally', 'Elmer', 'Berstein', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'soundtracks', 'ever', 'written', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'solid', 'western', 'film', 'fare', 'where', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'clearly', 'defined', 'heroes', 'fight', 'altruistic', 'purpose']",The Magnificent Seven VHS
421095,A307LZV1TBCJJO,630442972X,phimseto,"[5, 6]","&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; gets a grand introduction to the realm of DVDs with this release.  Just starting the DVD up is a rush that raises the excitement level for the film, as the opening menu kicks off in stirring fashion with Bernstein's rousing score and selected clips from the film.The movie transfer seems to be ok.  I wished it could have been clearer and more crisp, but I am not sure if that was even possible.  As it was, the picture was definitely leaps and bounds better than anything you'll find on VHS.  The DVD extras are wonderful, too, featuring movie trailers (including an infamously tacky one that provided me with my subject header), talent bios, audio commentary, and best of all a retrospective documentary featuring most of the cast and crew involved.  The backdrop of the documentary is that you had a number of young stars (Horst Buccholz, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn) who were trying to outdo each other in drawing notice in this film, and the retrospect provides some delicious 20/20 hindsight to the whole thing.The movie itself is a wonderful adaptation of Kurosawa's &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;, which itself was influenced heavily by Kurosawa's fascination with the Western genre and in particular John Ford.  &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; adroitly adapts the themes of Kurosawa's film, especially the overarcing theme of what it means to be a warrior or, by this film's definition, a cowboy.The performances are wonderful, the direction is solid, and the score transcends the film from great Western to classic cinema.

421096,A33XHXRTRZOQ12,630442972X,"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man""","[5, 11]","I saw this movie, first run, in 1960, in one of my neighborhood theaters...a theater that had an uncanny taste in good movies! And to this day, I'm still spellbound by the fantastic music, the casting, especially of Yul Brynner as the head honcho, and the overall dramatic effect of this landmark film.""The Magnificent Seven"" started out as a remake of ""The Seven Samurai"" by Akira Kurasawa, a fact just about everybody who's ever Googled IMDB or read a film history article knows by heart. What you might not have known is that Yul Brynner owned the rights to make it into a western! Brynner, in fact, was slated to direct, at one point, but they got John Sturges instead. Anthony Quinn was originally slated to play Chris, Brynner's character. I really couldn't imagine this movie without Brynner playing Chris, and I thank the gods of fate manipulation that it didn't happen that way.You all know the story, right? Chris rides around the border area searching for gunfighters to help him protect a Mexican village from a menacing group of bandits, led by Eli Wallach (Calveras), and meets up with Steve McQueen as Vin, James Coburn as Britt, Robert Vaughn as Lee, Charles Bronson as O'Reilly, Horst Bucholz as Rico and Brad Dexter as Harry. All these guys are good, with the possible exception of Robert Vaughn, who, it turns out, is the only surviving ""hero"" from the movie. His character, apparently, was shell-shocked from earlier gunfights, and is fighting demons of cowardice and inadequacy. There was always a character like this in just about every ""important"" drama of this era and the performances were almost always over the top, and thank Gawd Vaughn's is kept to a minimum. His presence in anything made after ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"" was canceled was almost always a sure sign that the movie was a bomb. The man looks like John Derek designed by Al Hirschfeld...Horst Bucholz, who made an international career out of playing Holden Caulfields, does his hotheaded young guy thing here in his inimtable style. Though German, Bucholz only once portrayed a German in any movies of his released here! In ""One Hour To Rama"", a movie about Gandhi's assassin, he plays a Hindu, sick and tired of British rule. In this film, he plays a young hispanic fellow who wants to join the gaggle of older men to fight the banditos. This he does, while making a fool out of himself when drunk but acquitting himself when he's sober and the chips are down. He's also the one who makes any kind of time with the young ladies of the village.Steve McQueen does his laconic thing, with baleful stares and not much dialogue, and some of the most pointed finger counting you've ever seen as he is Brynner's first, helping to recruit the other fighters. Coburn, who, back then was often mixed up with McQueen by audiences because of their striking visual similarities, plays the knife-wielding expert, who's just as fast with a gun, named Britt. He gets almost NO lines in the film, but one of the most quoted scenes from the film, where Bucholz's Rico is amazed at a shot he made, shooting a bandito off a horse, is one that everybody remembers. As with Flint, he modestly tells Rico that he was aiming ""for the horse"".Bronson's O'Reilly becomes a favorite of three village boys, as he is the one who teaches the village men how to shoot rifles. And then there's Brynner's Chris. As Chris, Brynner gets all the good lines in the movie...all the philosophical lines, all the good comedic lines, which McQueen or Wallach often set up for him, and nobody has the walk he has...not John Wayne, not Jim Arness, not Alan Ladd, not anybody....If you remember there being a lot more of the score in this movie when you saw it in the theater, you're not alone. I found myself wanting to hear the main refrain played as often as possible and cursed the fact that the movie wasn't shot in glorious stereo, as this score was made for it!One of the things that made this movie so great is the easy camaraderie between the gunslingers as they band together to help the lowly villagers. They exchange sly jokes and the stories of their lives, (or whatever they want to reveal of them,) and if more of them had survived, they would have probably become lifelong friends, but in the end, only two remained...and watching them ride off into the sunset beats Brandon De Wilde calling out to Shane any day of the week!A true classic.",5,The western to beat all westerns.....!,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,4403,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'run', '1960', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'theaters', 'theater', 'had', 'uncanny', 'taste', 'good', 'movies', 'day', ""'m"", 'still', 'spellbound', 'fantastic', 'music', 'casting', 'especially', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'head', 'honcho', 'overall', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'landmark', 'film', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'started', 'out', 'remake', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Akira', 'Kurasawa', 'fact', 'just', 'everybody', 'who', 'ever', 'Googled', 'IMDB', 'read', 'film', 'history', 'article', 'heart', 'What', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'owned', 'rights', 'make', 'western', 'Brynner', 'fact', 'was', 'slated', 'direct', 'one', 'point', 'got', 'John', 'Sturges', 'instead', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'play', 'Chris', 'Brynner', 'character', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'movie', 'Brynner', 'playing', 'Chris', 'thank', 'gods', 'fate', 'manipulation', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way.You', 'know', 'story', 'right', 'Chris', 'border', 'area', 'searching', 'gunfighters', 'help', 'protect', 'Mexican', 'village', 'menacing', 'group', 'bandits', 'led', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Calveras', 'up', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Vin', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Britt', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Lee', 'Charles', 'Bronson', ""O'Reilly"", 'Horst', 'Bucholz', 'Rico', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'Harry', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'possible', 'exception', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'out', 'only', 'surviving', 'hero', 'movie', 'character', 'apparently', 'was', 'shell-shocked', 'earlier', 'gunfights', 'fighting', 'demons', 'cowardice', 'inadequacy', 'was', 'always', 'character', 'just', 'important', 'drama', 'era', 'performances', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'top', 'thank', 'Gawd', 'Vaughn', 'kept', 'minimum', 'presence', 'anything', 'made', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'was', 'canceled', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'sure', 'sign', 'movie', 'was', 'bomb', 'man', 'John', 'Derek', 'designed', 'Al', 'Hirschfeld', 'Horst', 'Bucholz', 'who', 'made', 'international', 'career', 'playing', 'Holden', 'Caulfields', 'hotheaded', 'young', 'guy', 'thing', 'here', 'inimtable', 'style', 'German', 'Bucholz', 'only', 'once', 'portrayed', 'German', 'movies', 'released', 'here', 'One', 'Hour', 'Rama', 'movie', 'Gandhi', 'assassin', 'Hindu', 'sick', 'tired', 'British', 'rule', 'film', 'young', 'hispanic', 'fellow', 'who', 'join', 'gaggle', 'older', 'men', 'fight', 'banditos', 'making', 'fool', 'when', 'drunk', 'acquitting', 'when', 'sober', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'kind', 'time', 'young', 'ladies', 'village.Steve', 'McQueen', 'laconic', 'thing', 'baleful', 'stares', 'not', 'much', 'dialogue', 'most', 'pointed', 'finger', 'counting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Brynner', 'first', 'helping', 'recruit', 'other', 'fighters', 'Coburn', 'who', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'often', 'mixed', 'up', 'McQueen', 'audiences', 'striking', 'visual', 'similarities', 'knife-wielding', 'expert', 'who', 'just', 'fast', 'gun', 'named', 'Britt', 'almost', 'NO', 'lines', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'quoted', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'Bucholz', 'Rico', 'amazed', 'shot', 'made', 'shooting', 'bandito', 'off', 'horse', 'one', 'everybody', 'remembers', 'Flint', 'modestly', 'Rico', 'was', 'aiming', 'horse', '.Bronson', ""O'Reilly"", 'favorite', 'three', 'village', 'boys', 'one', 'who', 'village', 'men', 'how', 'shoot', 'rifles', 'then', 'Brynner', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'Brynner', 'good', 'lines', 'movie', 'philosophical', 'lines', 'good', 'comedic', 'lines', 'McQueen', 'Wallach', 'often', 'set', 'up', 'nobody', 'walk', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'Jim', 'Arness', 'not', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'not', 'anybody', 'remember', 'being', 'lot', 'more', 'score', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'found', 'wanting', 'hear', 'main', 'refrain', 'played', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'cursed', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'shot', 'glorious', 'stereo', 'score', 'was', 'made', 'One', 'things', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'easy', 'camaraderie', 'gunslingers', 'band', 'together', 'help', 'lowly', 'villagers', 'exchange', 'sly', 'jokes', 'stories', 'lives', 'want', 'reveal', 'more', 'had', 'survived', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'become', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'end', 'only', 'two', 'remained', 'watching', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'Brandon', 'De', 'Wilde', 'calling', 'out', 'Shane', 'day', 'week', 'true', 'classic']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

Johnson,"[11, 12]","Movie influence comes full circle as Akira Kurosawa's classic warrior epic The Seven Samurai - influenced so much by Kurosawa's love of Hollywood westerns - is remade as... a western! And a crackerjack one it is as well, as coolly charismatic gunfighter Chris (Yul Brynner) puts together a gang of laconic silent types to defend a Mexican peasant village from raiding banditos. Cool is the operative word to describe The Magnificent Seven - from the moment the seemingly miscast Yul Brynner steps on screen to disarm your expectations with impressively understated menace, to the inevitably heroic bloodbath at the end. Steve McQueen and James Coburn reinforce the cool, playing their characters with a relaxed deliberateness that underlines the most important audience impression - these men are dangerous. McQueen and Brynner's classic hearse ride to the cemetery after the beginning - the first time their characters ever meet - is the kind of moment that encapsulates the heroic appeal of Westerns, on a par with the final walk of Peckinpah's Wild Bunch. Add to the mix THE quintessential Western score, and you have the perfect concoction to please any lover of intelligent, fast-moving action.

421100,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,630442972X,Randy Keehn,"[2, 2]","When I was a kid my favorite Western was ""High Noon"" followed closely by ""The Magnificent Seven"".  Somehow I knew, even when I was young, that the former was a quality production while the latter was of a somewhat lesser standard.  However, I never let that keep me from enjoying it.  What appealed to me then and now was the level of action throughout the movie.  Most Westerns of this quality have either too little or too much action.  The ones with lesser action often lack the quality of drama to make them enjoyable.  The ones with too much action often lack a meaningful story to go along with the action.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" was able to take a workable story (adapted from Kurasawa's ""Seven Samurai"") and include a sustained and engrossing level of action to rise above the standard ""B"" Western.The acting is pretty good throughout ""The Magnificent Seven"".  The main actors, Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Eli Wallach were either already great actors or, in the case of McQueen, on their way to becoming one.  The lessor roles saw the likes of upcoming actors Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn.  Horst Buchholz was supposed to have a big career ahead of him.  I remember him in ""One Two Three"" but I guess the rest of his career must have taken off in Germany.  The hard one to remember is Brad Dexter.If you're not familiar with the story, it tells of seven out of work gunslingers who take the job of defending a small Mexican village against their annual attack from Eli Wallach's roving band of outlaws.  The seven work for beans (literally) and gradually bond to the villagers and their struggle.  It's the story of nobel sacrifice and well told by director John Sturges.  It may not qualify as cinematic artistic achievement but it is exciting to watch.I have enjoyed ""Seven Samurai"".  It is one of the great movies of all time.  It warrents the concentration necessary to follow the subtitles and appreciate what co-mingled talent in writing, directing, acting and cinematography can achieve.  However, when I prefer to relax my concentration, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is as good a choice as any.",5,Western Action at its' Best,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,2131,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'favorite', 'Western', 'was', 'High', 'Noon', 'followed', 'closely', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Somehow', 'knew', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'former', 'was', 'quality', 'production', 'latter', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lesser', 'standard', 'However', 'never', 'let', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'What', 'appealed', 'then', 'now', 'was', 'level', 'action', 'movie', 'Most', 'Westerns', 'quality', 'have', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'ones', 'lesser', 'action', 'often', 'quality', 'drama', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'ones', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'often', 'meaningful', 'story', 'go', 'along', 'action', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'workable', 'story', 'adapted', 'Kurasawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'include', 'sustained', 'engrossing', 'level', 'action', 'rise', 'standard', 'B', 'Western.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'main', 'actors', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'were', 'either', 'already', 'great', 'actors', 'case', 'McQueen', 'way', 'becoming', 'one', 'lessor', 'saw', 'likes', 'upcoming', 'actors', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'big', 'career', 'ahead', 'remember', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'guess', 'rest', 'career', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'Germany', 'hard', 'one', 'remember', 'Brad', 'Dexter.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'seven', 'work', 'gunslingers', 'who', 'take', 'job', 'defending', 'small', 'Mexican', 'village', 'annual', 'attack', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'roving', 'band', 'outlaws', 'seven', 'work', 'beans', 'literally', 'gradually', 'bond', 'villagers', 'struggle', 'story', 'nobel', 'sacrifice', 'well', 'told', 'director', 'John', 'Sturges', 'may', 'not', 'qualify', 'cinematic', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'exciting', 'watch.I', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'time', 'concentration', 'necessary', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'appreciate', 'what', 'co-mingled', 'talent', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'can', 'achieve', 'However', 'when', 'prefer', 'relax', 'concentration', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'as', 'good', 'choice']",The Magnificent Seven VHS
421101,A1J2931UBBJPXM,630442972X,Reviewer,"[2, 2]","There's something romantic, even heroic, in the notion of taking a stand against overwhelming odds for the sake of an ideal, or a principle; in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" directed by John Sturges, it's to save a poor Mexican  village from a small army of bandits.  Every year, as soon as the crops are  in, Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his men raid the village for the food that  will sustain them as they winter in the mountains.  And every year they  take a little more, leaving the villagers near to starvation.  They want to  fight back, but they are simple farmers; no match for the likes of Calvera.  When they fear they cannot survive another winter on the pittance he  leaves them, they decide to take action.  If they are unable to defend  themselves, they will hire men to do it for them.  Men with guns.  And  toward that end, everything of value in the village is collected (not much  more than a watch and some trinkets) to be offered as payment to anyone who  will champion their cause.  Three men from the village set out to find the  men they need, and after witnessing an altercation in a small Texas border  town, they think they have the man they want.  Chris (Yul Brynner) is a  drifter, a man who lives by his wits.  And by his gun.  They approach him,  and when he hears what they have to offer, he accepts.  ""I've been paid a  lot for my work,"" he tells them, ""But never everything.""  Now he must find  other men, like himself, to stand with him against Calvera.  The first  is Vin (Steve McQueen), also a drifter, and looking for work.  Chris knows  what he can do, how he handles a gun; Vin sided with him during the  incident in town.  Bernardo (Charles Bronson), is good with a rifle.  Fallen on hard times, the pay offered (the cost of bullets, and meals)  ""Right now, sounds like a lot.""  The dapper Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fast  gun, and currently on the run; Britt (James Coburn), the best anywhere with  a gun or a knife; Harry (Brad Dexter), a good man, but always looking for  an angle.  He knows Chris, and takes the job convinced that there's more in  it for them than he's letting on, probably gold; finally, there's Chico  (Horst Buchholz), a young wanna-be gunslinger who refuses to leave Chris  alone until he agrees to take him along.  The all-star cast and  outstanding performances highlight this film, most notably the iconoclastic  McQueen, Wallach, Vaughn and especially Coburn, who brings a commanding  presence to the screen with the cool, laconic Britt.  One of the most  memorable scenes involves Britt, when he is challenged to a mock duel (with  targets) by a cowboy named Wallace (Robert J. Wilke); Wallace's gun against  Britt's knife.  When Wallace thinks he's won, Britt simply says, ""You  lost.""  And they do it again; this time, for real.  The supporting cast  includes Jorge Martinez de Hoyos (Hilario), Vladimir Sokoloff (Old Man),  Rosenda Monteros (Petra) and Rico Alaniz (Sotero).  An updated version of  ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" has all the elements of the  traditional western, but it is so much more.  It's a character study of men  as individuals; not outlaws, but hard men, drawn together by a common bond,  and who live by a variation of the same code.  Their first loyalty is to  themselves, and to their word; and to the autonomy that ensures they will  live, and die, on their own terms.  This movie may lack the gritty realism  of some of the more recent films, but with it's stellar cast, the instantly  recognizable Elmer Bernstein theme, and the way it was packaged and  delivered by Sturges, it will forever hold a place at the top in the  history of the Western Film.",5,Magnificent and Memorable Western,960076800,"06 4, 2000",2000,3662,"['something', 'romantic', 'even', 'heroic', 'notion', 'taking', 'stand', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'sake', 'ideal', 'principle', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'directed', 'John', 'Sturges', 'save', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'village', 'small', 'army', 'bandits', 'year', 'as', 'soon', 'crops', 'are', 'Calvera', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'men', 'raid', 'village', 'food', 'will', 'sustain', 'winter', 'mountains', 'year', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'leaving', 'villagers', 'starvation', 'want', 'fight', 'back', 'are', 'simple', 'farmers', 'match', 'likes', 'Calvera', 'When', 'fear', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'winter', 'pittance', 'decide', 'take', 'action', 'are', 'unable', 'defend', 'will', 'hire', 'men', 'do', 'Men', 'guns', 'end', 'everything', 'value', 'village', 'collected', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'watch', 'trinkets', 'be', 'offered', 'payment', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'champion', 'cause', 'Three', 'men', 'village', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'men', 'need', 'witnessing', 'altercation', 'small', 'Texas', 'border', 'town', 'think', 'have', 'man', 'want', 'Chris', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'drifter', 'man', 'who', 'wits', 'gun', 'approach', 'when', 'what', 'have', 'offer', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paid', 'lot', 'work', 'never', 'everything', 'Now', 'must', 'find', 'other', 'men', 'stand', 'Calvera', 'first', 'Vin', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'also', 'drifter', 'looking', 'work', 'Chris', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'gun', 'Vin', 'sided', 'incident', 'town', 'Bernardo', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'good', 'rifle', 'Fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'pay', 'offered', 'cost', 'bullets', 'meals', 'Right', 'now', 'lot', 'dapper', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'fast', 'gun', 'currently', 'run', 'Britt', 'James', 'Coburn', 'best', 'anywhere', 'gun', 'knife', 'Harry', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'good', 'man', 'always', 'looking', 'angle', 'Chris', 'job', 'convinced', 'more', 'letting', 'probably', 'gold', 'finally', 'Chico', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'young', 'wanna-be', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'leave', 'Chris', 'alone', 'take', 'along', 'all-star', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'highlight', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'iconoclastic', 'McQueen', 'Wallach', 'Vaughn', 'especially', 'Coburn', 'who', 'commanding', 'presence', 'screen', 'cool', 'laconic', 'Britt', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Britt', 'when', 'challenged', 'mock', 'duel', 'targets', 'cowboy', 'named', 'Wallace', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Wilke', 'Wallace', 'gun', 'Britt', 'knife', 'When', 'Wallace', 'won', 'Britt', 'simply', 'lost', 'do', 'again', 'time', 'real', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jorge', 'Martinez', 'de', 'Hoyos', 'Hilario', 'Vladimir', 'Sokoloff', 'Old', 'Man', 'Rosenda', 'Monteros', 'Petra', 'Rico', 'Alaniz', 'Sotero', 'updated', 'version', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'elements', 'traditional', 'western', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'men', 'individuals', 'not', 'hard', 'men', 'drawn', 'together', 'common', 'bond', 'who', 'live', 'variation', 'same', 'code', 'first', 'loyalty', 'word', 'autonomy', 'will', 'live', 'die', 'own', 'terms', 'movie', 'may', 'lack', 'gritty', 'realism', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'stellar', 'cast', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'theme', 'way', 'was', 'packaged', 'delivered', 'Sturges', 'will', 'forever', 'hold', 'place', 'top', 'history', 'Western', 'Film']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

Working with the essentials from Kurosawa's film - of seven warriors coming together to defend a village of farmers from a group of bandits - Sturges fashioned a western that contained some of the most obvious cliches of the genre and yet overcame them, thanks to the fast-paced script and the sheer charisma of the cast.No one has looked better in black in a western than Yul Brynner, and McQueen's turn is yet another epitome of cool.This new two-disc collector's edition could technically be called a double dip, but it promises a new transfer from a high-definition masterDisc 1 has the main feature in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track as well as the original mono.

For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point...""The Magnificent Seven"" is derived from Kurosawa's superb ""The Seven Samurai,"" a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.'Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in ""The Man from Uncle"" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like ""High Noon,"" ""The Far Country,"" and ""Man of the West.""The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (again starring Yul Brynner), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" and, last and least of all, ""The Magnificent Seven Ride.""With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, ""The Magnificent Seven"" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...",5,A richly enjoyable Western with a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score...,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,3602,"['John', 'Sturges', 'reputation', 'solid', 'director', 'superior', 'Westerns', 'filled', 'tense', 'action', 'scenes', 'such', 'Escape', 'Fort', 'Bravo', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Black', 'Rock', 'Backlash', 'Gunfight', 'O.K', 'Corral', 'Law', 'Jack', 'Wade', 'Last', 'Train', 'Gun', 'Hill', 'Sergeant', 'Three', 'Hallelujah', 'Trail', 'one', 'best', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'movies', 'Hour', 'Gun', 'one', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'opening', 'sequences', 'Western', 'movies', 'when', 'had', 'McQueen', 'Brynner', 'riding', 'hearse', 'up', 'legendary', 'Boot', 'Hill', 'creating', 'mood', 'peril', 'never', 'allow', 'slightest', 'degree', 'viewer', 'confusion', 'ennui', 'Sturges', 'West', 'man', 'world', 'cool', 'hard', 'detached', 'style', 'emphasizing', 'action', 'excitement', 'rugged', 'environment', 'frontier', 'point', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'derived', 'Kurosawa', 'superb', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'compelling', 'tale', 'intimidated', 'impoverished', 'medieval', 'villagers', 'hiring', 'mercenary', 'warriors', 'repel', 'bandit', 'ravages', 'villagers', 'case', 'are', 'Mexicans', 'plagued', 'bearing', 'activities', 'bandit', 'Calavera', 'who', 'always', 'tortillas', 'few', 'beans', 'Three', 'cross', 'border', 'offer', 'meager', 'pay', 'sustenance', 'professionally', 'skilled', 'fighting', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'aid', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'man', 'dressed', 'black', 'luminous', 'dome', 'hypnotic', 'Mongolian', 'eyes', 'who', 'portrays', 'distinctive', 'Chris', 'Adams', 'leader', 'seven', 'hired', 'gunmen', 'hired', 'chase', ""'flies"", 'little', 'Mexican', 'village', 'Wallach', 'memorable', 'Calvera', 'chief', 'ruthless', 'outlaws', 'greedy', 'merciless', 'terrorizing', 'pity', 'poor', 'peasants', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'standout', 'performance', 'sardonic', 'gunman', ""'We"", 'deal', 'lead', 'friend', 'carrying', 'appealing', 'ease', 'sense', 'humor', 'role', 'Vin', 'Brynner', 'first', 'recruit', 'second-in-command', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Bernardo', ""O'Reilly"", 'who', 'curious', 'name', 'Chris', ""'Mexican"", 'one', 'side', 'Irish', 'other', 'middle', 'Bronson', 'strongest', 'face', 'Western', 'bit', 'Mexican', 'cunning', 'face', 'steady', 'eyes', 'revealing', 'voice', 'character', 'Bernardo', ""O'Reilly"", 'suits', 'perfectly', 'half-breed', 'gunfighter', 'conscience', 'team', 'tender', 'paternal', 'instincts', 'adopted', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'promise', 'case', 'bring', 'day', 'fresh', 'flowers', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'was', 'do', 'nicely', 'TV', 'Man', 'Uncle', 'spy', 'spoof', 'Lee', ""'good"", 'gun', 'black', 'gloves', 'nightmares', 'living', 'style', 'enemies', 'alive', 'Brad', 'Dexter', 'Harry', 'Luck', 'Brynner', 'happy', 'friend', 'who', 'join', 'team', 'convinced', 'existence', 'large', 'amount', 'hidden', 'gold', 'James', 'Coburn', 'big', 'impression', 'Britt', 'expert', 'gunman', 'who', 'can', 'out-draw', 'gun', 'knife-throwing', 'looks', 'vague', 'figure', 'violence', 'are', 'quite', 'response', 'few', 'talks', 'Horst', 'Bucholz', 'youth', 'eagerness', 'urge', 'be', 'proved', 'sorted', 'out', 'boys', 'was', 'caught', 'road', 'Rosenda', 'Monteros', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Wilke', 'Britt', 'insisting', 'challenger', 'who', 'ranks', 'villains', 'many', 'Westerns', 'High', 'Noon', 'Far', 'Country', 'Man', 'West', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'success', 'spawned', 'three', 'sequels', 'Return', 'Seven', 'again', 'starring', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Guns', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'last', 'least', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Ride', 'terrific', 'Oscar-Nominated', 'Musical', 'Score', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'richly', 'enjoyable', 'Western', 'shot', 'location', 'Morelos', 'state', 'Mexico']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

421116,A10Q8NIFOVOHFV,630442972X,Robert S. Clay Jr.,"[0, 0]","An effective blend of professionalism, courage in adversity, and the heroism of common people distinguish this classic Western.  There is a subtle irony in this film that elevates it above the typical  action-adventure movie.  The wise old man of the village is right when he  asserts, after the gunfire subsides and the dead are buried, that only the  farmers won.  The farmers symbolize the timeless struggle of daily life.  The commitment to domestic responsibility and the work ethic of parents as  they strive to provide for a family is recognized as heroic and enduring.  The vaunted freedom and machismo of the wandering gunfighter is exposed as  myth.  To each perceived advantage of living by the gunman's code there is  a counter-point of a lonely life with no focal point.  The gunfighters are  compared to a great wind that rids the farmers of a locust plague, but is  unwelcome when its task is done.  Violence is anathema to raising crops,  increasing herds, and nurturing children.Subtlety aside, the surface  appeal of the movie is its exciting tale of the seven hired guns that help  a Mexican village battle a ruthless bandit gang.  Yul Brynner does well as  the stoic leader of the Seven.  His &quot;gunfighter in black&quot; image  has become a minor icon of American film lore.  At the time, the casting of  obscure young actors as the rest of the Seven was brilliantly done.  Steve  McQueen's too cool performance is especially effective.  James Coburn,  Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson are great as the smooth professionals  calmly confronting arrogant amateurs.  Eli Wallach as the strutting bandit  chief is simultaneously sinister and comic.  His pontificating on the  decline of religion and the shameless women's fashions of the day while his  gang openly steal from the village is hiliarious dark comedy.The film is  ably directed by John Sturges.  The movie mixes the familiar Western  elements with a dash of Ernest Hemingway's concept of courage in adversity  and Howard Hawks' philosophy of professionalism.  Its quiet tribute to the  daily heroism of common people is unusual and commendable for its insight.  A legendary film score adds to the excitement.  The enjoyment of this movie  increases with each viewing.

421117,A1JIPFV4OL520T,630442972X,Robert Wynkoop,"[4, 17]","Let's see if I understand this movie.  An ""innocent"" village of farmers is terrorized by a band of 40 outlaws who periodically raid their village, steal their food and wealth, and rape their women.  Villagers then hire gunfighters to free themselves of this menace and in the end, the village is free, the outlaws are dead, and the people live in peace.Really now, who in the world can believe that?  Surely, it was the villagers fault.  Perhaps they didn't share enough of their prosperity with the outlaws.  Maybe they had the condescending idea that working with your hands, producing your own wealth and taking care of your families was a noble pursuit.  Did they not realize how culturally inferior they made the outlaws feel?  If this isn't cultural jingoism I don't know what is.  If the villagers gained any measure of prosperity, it must have been at the expense of the outlaws.  Rather than having the parochial  idea that farming the land and taking care of their families was superior lifestyle to being an outlaw, they should have tried to understand why these men hated them so much.  Maybe if the villagers instituted some diversity training and invited the outlaws to their fiestas and got to know them better, all this violence could have been avoided.Certainly, hiring outside mercenaries to fight for them was a breach of every international protocol.  What chance did these poor local bandits have standing up against the Magnificent Seven.  The M7 should have shown more restraint.  I think I saw at least a half-a-dozen of the banditos shot in the back. Where is the justice in that?  Shouldn't the M7 be tried for murder?  Let's get real, the poor bandit was just trying to flee for his life.  No verbal warnings, no warning shots, just a bullet in the back.  Magnificent Seven- no way.

When met with resistance, a bullet in the belly is the villager's reward.  What to do?  They're just farmers, not hired guns.  The elder of the village says go and buy guns![It's interesting, in the ""making of"" of this film, they had a censor who had to ensure that the Mexican people were not be degraded in this film as they were in an earlier film, Vera Cruz.  In the original Japanese film, The Seven Samurai, the Seven were hired.  This looked like a degradation, so the censor accepted that the villagers would buy guns, not men.  That they did hire men was an afterthought rather than a main plot point of the earlier adaptation.]Two men (played by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen) overhear a funeral director (played by that guy from Time Tunnel!) lament that he cannot bury an Indian body in the cemetery because he'll get shot at.  Apparently the town is so racist that to bury an Indian body into a white cemetery is stating you're an ""Indian lover"" and could get you shot!After safely getting the funeral wagon to the plot (after much shooting, joking around and a little whiskey to keep ya warm), Brynner (Chris) is confronted by the villagers as to where to get guns, etc.  They convey that they're being taken advantage of and want to get rid of this bandito.Throughout the film the question is asked why Chris does this.  Is it an honor thing?  Certainly not money (20 dollars, even by 1895 standards is cheap).  And could be he just likes the thrill of being a hired gun.  It's a matter of honor and integrity that the audience is left to ponder.What makes the film great are several themes:  The camaraderie of seven men, who separate are pretty good but as a solid team are a force to be reckoned with.  This theme has been repeated time and time again, but The Magnificent Seven was the first film to do this successfully.  It's been copied since.Another theme is the music!  Bernstein's theme is one of the most recognized and even earned an Oscar for that year.  [As an aside, the film was not that hot right out of the gate.  It was only after its hit in Europe and then its subsequent replay to American audiences that it finally caught on.]Each character gets his scene time.  Each has his own problems and these are confronted.  And not all the Seven make it out alive.  But they all contributed, to a greater or lesser degree, to the successful liberation of the village.And what of the villagers?  Some resented being helped.  Some resented having their lives complicated.  What was the harm in letting this bandito come down and have some food?  What a price to pay, freedom?The scene of betrayal was especially poignant with me, really struck a chord.  The realistic scenery, the horse & cowboy battles, the realism of the people and their plight, make it clear why this film has been copied, a TV series and several sequels have been made!

They offer next to nothing, but it is everything they have. Head gunman Chris (perfectly played by Yul Brynner) has never been offered everything before so he takes the job. Chris recruits a few old friends and a couple of new faces to round out the group at seven.  They go to the Mexican village and teach the farmers how to fight. The farmers in turn teach the gunmen how to live.My Opinion:  This is an awesome movie. It is a classic western. Yul Brynner is great. Charles Bronson is young! There are plots and subplots. Everything is well done.DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic with DD 5.1 sound. The transfer is quite grainy at points with flaws and artifacts.

421131,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,630442972X,S J Buck,"[1, 3]","Whilst this probably isn't the best western ever made its certainly up there amongst the top flight. It was fortunately made a few years before 'A Fistful of Dollars', which changed westerns and what was expected from them.Take the classic Kurosawa film 'Seven Samurai' (which is given its due in the opening credits) and reinvent it in the American west. Then add the staggeringly good cast of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, James Coburn and Robert Vaughan and what you have is a near perfect piece of Cinema. Some of these guys (like McQueen) were not the bigshots they would later become, but they are incredibly cool. Just a look is enough for these actors. For example, James Coburn hardly says a word throughout the film, and he has arguably the best scene - the knife vs gun moment.Sure its not a great film in the way 'The Searchers' is, but for straightforward entertainment this is hard to beat. And for those who criticise it as being dated and slow, I'm afraid you've been watching too many modern Hollywood blockbusters. What makes The Magnificent Seven substantially better than a lot of modern films, is that its a simple morality tale, and in the end you do care about the villagers and the Seven.As a simple comparison the film I watched prior to this one was 'Swordfish' a 2001 film starring John Travolta and Hugh Jackman. Not a bad film. It has a great start. But its not in the same league as The Magnificent Seven. After the start it becomes an exercise in CGI, explosions, car chases and computer screens. Its worth seeing, just, but its a largely souless, depressing piece of filmmaking. Saying that of course there are much worse films than Swordfish out there...A final word on The Magnificent Seven, listen to the wonderful music score by Elmer Bernstein.

421136,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,630442972X,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","I saw this in 1960, when I was in my teens, and I hadn't seen it again until the other day.  I remembered the music, of course, and the image of the bald, black-clad Yul Brynner, but the scenes I remembered, oddly, were Robert Vaughan's -- his dream and his failure to catch the three flies.  Seeing them again, I was struck by how disconnected his part in the story is from the rest.  I think he's in the movie to be a counterweight to the young Chico (Horst Buchholz), who is played so young as to have no nerves at all.  It's a beautiful looking movie, and the quite complicated action (once the seven get to the village) is kept clear, and the suspense is effectively built.  What seems odd to me now too is the lack of history of the characters, and I think this finally is a strength of the movie -- a mysteriousness about motive that nonetheless doesn't undermine the sense of the seven as a group who totally trust one another, as if some kind of code has become so internalized with them that they don't even have to discuss it.  The one who doesn't quite &#34;get it&#34; (though he is obviously enchanted by it) is young Chico, who wants to be like the others but doesn't seem to know why.  The movie gestures at the idea, seen too in &#34;Ride the High Country,&#34; that the world has moved on from the days when hired guns were needed and that as a result the men have fallen on hard times -- but we don't see that world in the movie.The strength of the acting is that each of the main actors (including Eli Wallach [as the bandit Calvera] and Vladimir Sokoloff [as the old man]) has a physical distinctiveness that individualizes him, so that although their characters have no real depth, they never seem anonymous or interchangeable.  They all seem more substantial than the writing for their characters warrants, and that serves to remind us just how important visual impressions are in movies.  Each character has a &#34;look&#34; that defines him, and Charles Bronson (Bernardo) and James Coburn (Britt) would trade on that look for years to come in their careers.  Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen (Chris and Vin, the effective leader-planners of the group) were as odd a couple as appeared in a Western before Butch and Sundance, but they have an easy chemistry that works perfectly.  There are sentimental elements -- Bernardo's rapport with the village children who say they'll put flowers on his grave if he dies . . . well, you can guess how that turns out.  And there's Chico and his very forward Mexican maiden who is instrumental in convincing him (not that they talk about it) that his future is as a farmer . . . And, we're told, &#34;the farmers win.&#34;  These are among the final words of the movie, spoken by the oracular old man, who compares the gunmen to the wind passing over the land and the farmers as being permanent, &#34;like the land itself.&#34;  In the world of the movie, this passes reasonably credibly for wisdom.One rough spot -- the relation of the bandit Calvera to the village isn't quite clear.  The means by which he and his men take over the village (clearly with inside help, for no shots are heard) while the seven are out looking for them is a murky spot in the narrative.  Calvera seems to think it reasonable that the village should allow him and his men to take food and supplies on a regular basis, and he clearly also feels that men like the seven -- living unsocialized and with no fixed community -- are in some sense like him, and his last words indicate his incredulity that Chris and his band should feel the village was worth fighting for.  I still find it less than credible that Calvera would let the seven go, and even return their weapons, but that he does so suggests that he feels the pull of that unspoken code among gunmen that binds the seven together.  Of course, if he hadn't done that, we wouldn't have had the final gunfight . . .An intriguing and not totally transparent movie, then . . . but the questions about it that one can't answer are perhaps part of its enduring appeal and iconic status.",4,4.5 stars . . . odder than I remembered . . .,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,4078,"['saw', '1960', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', 'other', 'day', 'remembered', 'music', 'course', 'image', 'bald', 'black-clad', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'scenes', 'remembered', 'oddly', 'were', 'Robert', 'Vaughan', 'dream', 'failure', 'catch', 'three', 'flies', 'Seeing', 'again', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'disconnected', 'part', 'story', 'rest', 'think', 'movie', 'be', 'counterweight', 'young', 'Chico', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'who', 'played', 'so', 'young', 'have', 'nerves', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'movie', 'quite', 'complicated', 'action', 'seven', 'get', 'village', 'kept', 'clear', 'suspense', 'effectively', 'built', 'What', 'odd', 'now', 'too', 'lack', 'history', 'characters', 'think', 'finally', 'strength', 'movie', 'mysteriousness', 'motive', 'nonetheless', ""n't"", 'undermine', 'sense', 'seven', 'group', 'who', 'totally', 'trust', 'one', 'kind', 'code', 'become', 'so', 'internalized', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'discuss', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', '34', 'get', '34', 'obviously', 'enchanted', 'young', 'Chico', 'who', 'be', 'others', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'gestures', 'idea', 'seen', 'too', '34', 'Ride', 'High', 'Country', '34', 'world', 'moved', 'days', 'when', 'hired', 'guns', 'were', 'needed', 'result', 'men', 'have', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'world', 'movie.The', 'strength', 'acting', 'main', 'actors', 'including', 'Eli', 'Wallach', '[', 'bandit', 'Calvera', ']', 'Vladimir', 'Sokoloff', '[', 'old', 'man', ']', 'physical', 'distinctiveness', 'so', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'depth', 'never', 'seem', 'anonymous', 'interchangeable', 'seem', 'more', 'substantial', 'writing', 'characters', 'warrants', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'visual', 'impressions', 'are', 'movies', 'character', '34', 'look', '34', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Bernardo', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Britt', 'would', 'trade', 'look', 'years', 'come', 'careers', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Chris', 'Vin', 'effective', 'leader-planners', 'group', 'were', 'odd', 'couple', 'appeared', 'Western', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'have', 'easy', 'chemistry', 'perfectly', 'are', 'sentimental', 'elements', 'Bernardo', 'rapport', 'village', 'children', 'who', 'say', ""'ll"", 'put', 'flowers', 'grave', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'out', 'Chico', 'very', 'forward', 'Mexican', 'maiden', 'who', 'instrumental', 'convincing', 'not', 'talk', 'future', 'farmer', ""'re"", 'told', '34', 'farmers', 'win.', '34', 'are', 'final', 'words', 'movie', 'spoken', 'oracular', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'gunmen', 'wind', 'passing', 'land', 'farmers', 'being', 'permanent', '34', 'land', 'itself.', '34', 'world', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'credibly', 'wisdom.One', 'rough', 'spot', 'relation', 'bandit', 'Calvera', 'village', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'means', 'men', 'take', 'village', 'clearly', 'inside', 'help', 'shots', 'are', 'heard', 'seven', 'are', 'out', 'looking', 'murky', 'spot', 'narrative', 'Calvera', 'think', 'reasonable', 'village', 'should', 'allow', 'men', 'take', 'food', 'supplies', 'regular', 'basis', 'clearly', 'also', 'men', 'seven', 'living', 'unsocialized', 'fixed', 'community', 'are', 'sense', 'last', 'words', 'indicate', 'incredulity', 'Chris', 'band', 'should', 'feel', 'village', 'was', 'worth', 'fighting', 'still', 'find', 'less', 'credible', 'Calvera', 'would', 'let', 'seven', 'go', 'even', 'return', 'weapons', 'so', 'pull', 'unspoken', 'code', 'gunmen', 'seven', 'together', 'course', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'final', 'gunfight', '.An', 'intriguing', 'not', 'totally', 'transparent', 'movie', 'then', 'questions', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'are', 'perhaps', 'part', 'enduring', 'appeal', 'iconic', 'status']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

(the ""old man"" of the village)""The Magnificent Seven"" is a classic film, one destined to take a highly ranked place in the ""outstanding"" Westerns of the past century.  There's just something soulful (for lack of a better word) about it, something beyond.  A remarkable story line, well written, carried out by a splendid cast, I take this one off the shelf every now and again - because it gives me a sentimental pleasure that is as good each time as it was when I first viewed it years ago, perhaps even more so now.  It's enduring charisma seems to be intensified by time; by all the intangible things that make certain films special to us;  as comforting as talking to old friends after a long absence.  It is more than just ""gunpowder and lead"" - an underlying, simple, but undeniable moral  lifts the story far above what it might otherwise be; brought to life by an unusual chemistry between all of the actors, successfully crafted by talented directing, and spirited by an unforgettable soundtrack.  Who can hear the sound track of The Magnificent Seven without knowing instantly which movie it belongs to?The stuff of legends, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen dominate the scenes as equals, successfully establishing strong personalities; playing off each other as the leader (Brynner) and his chosen support (McQueen) of an unlikely group of hired guns who take on a job of protecting a group of poor Mexican peasants who are being plagued by a marauding outlaw - played to the hilt by Eli Wallach,  whose band of renegades return each year to pillage and plunder the villagers of their hard scrabble stores of food.  Peppered by dry humor enough to relieve the serious nature, one scene in particular comes to mind as the group of ""have guns will travel"" head into the Mexican wilderness, remarking about the lack of intelligence a young member displays by trying to join them in such a quest.  ""No, not smart like us,"" Chris (Brynner) succinctly replies.They are gone but not forgotten - they live on.

Each actors brings something unique to the table and adds to this film.  Yul Brynner, king of Siam and Pharoh of Egypt, leads six men into Mexico to fight a band of 40 bandits.  Steve McQueen brings his laid back style and looks for love, while Bernardo Charles Bronsan wins the heart of children.  James Coburn is the man of action, &quot;fastest with gun or knife&quot; while Robert Vaughn is the desterter hiding on the battle field.  A young Horst as Chico (no, I'm not joking) is the young gun wanttobe, while Brad Dexter is the gun for hire.  A gold-toothed Eli Wallach does a great job as a villian, by not trying to be one.  John Sturges had a unique touch to handling a large cast.  Elmer Berstein delivers the screen's most rousing score that helped Marlboro sell cigarettes.DVD Features:  A good documentary with interviews with some of the cast.

Borrowing the story from Akira Kurosawa, the Magnificent Seven tells the story of seven gunman hired to protect a poor Mexican farming village from marauding bandits.  This is an excellent movie with a great cast.  The movie never stops rolling with great action, interesting characters, and quick dialogue througout.  It will keep you in your seat throughout.Part of the reason people love this movie so much is the wonderful cast put together.  Yul Brynner takes the leading role of Chris, the gunman in black, with Steve McQueen taking the part of his right hand man.  Joining them are Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughan, Brad Dexter, and Horst Bucholz.  To put this kind of cast together today would be unheard of.  If that was not enough, Eli Wallach takes the role of the lead bandit Calvera.  At times, you hate him and other times you can't help but like him.  I couldn't write a review without mentioning Elmer Bernstein's great score that everyone everywhere has probably heard at some time or another.  The DVD gives an excellent widescreen presentation that looks a little cleaned up from the VHS, several theatrical trailers, picture gallery, and a very informative documentary about the making of the movie.  This is one of those true western classics that can be watched over and over again.

Thinking it is time for action, they decide to cross the border and find guns to place a little steel mentally in their vein and physically into their tormentors. If this means collecting the meager valuables that the farmers therein then that is fine, too, because freedom will bring more to their tables. A crossing of paths changes their minds, however, and they find themselves in the market for ""men""  instead of more expensive weaponry. With Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) recruited first and at the gunslinging helm, he helps choose six others to make a solid seven willing to fight only for food, a place to sleep, twenty dollars, and whatever sense of nobility they get from being heroes. And then its on...This remake of Seven Samurai did for westerns what its predecessor did in the samurai arena. It crafted a legendary tale of men and weapons as they go off to fight the ""good"" fight for the people. The Magnificent Seven pays homage to Seven Samurai in many scenes, too, recreating some of those notable characters and some of those climactic scenes where they can be easily recognized. I personally liked that touch, finding Seven Samurai to be something well worth mentioning in many a genre of filmmaking. That said, this movie only takes from Seven Samurai in some aspects and fills-in-the-blanks the way it wants to in others, forging its own celluloid destiny. Where the first is overcast in somewhat grounded themes, The Magnificent Seven becomes more of a morality tale and makes its own mark by taking an idea and purifying it, producing more of an issue sheathed in ""good vs. bad"" than one beset with strong undercurrents. While that would have been a detractor from Seven Samurai, it worked really well in The Magnificent Seven and let the telling becomes one of heroics and what goes into motivating ""men.""Not only is the creation of the tale done well in the aspects of filming, but the acting accents it in memorable ways. Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson come together with other talented performers and give their characters depth as the movie moves across that ""save the farmers"" frontier. This leads to romance with a farmer's daughter, the way a man sees death after hundreds have died before him, what bravery amounts to, and countless other themes birthed by the way those individual gunfighters are showcased.

And I am not comparing the film to Kurosawa's, because I think that is an unfair comparison (apples and oranges, so to speak). But after watching this again as middle-aged adult, I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief in the face of one silly situation after another.First of all, a shaven-headed man as pale as Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), living and riding along the Texas/Mexico border? The back of his neck isn't even pink, much less red! He could have single-handedly terrified the evil bandito Calvera and his men into surrendering without firing a shot. They would have thought he was a spectral emissary from some unknown world and fled in panic at the site of him. But wait, there's more. This ghostly chrome-dome has a Russian accent, but one of his buddies refers to him as a Cajun. Huh?Even more confusing is the presence of a young white guy with a strong German accent, named... wait for it... ""Chico"" (Horst Buchholz). Early in the film, Chico demonstrates his lack of skill with a pistol and his inability to hold his liquor, yet Chris Adams later lets him join the Seven, apparently because Chico is good at catching and cooking fish. (Presumably Chris isn't concerned about facing a hail of Mexican bullets with an inept greenhorn at his side, as long as he can die with a bellyful of tasty trout caught fresh from the river).The film gets progressively weaker as the peaceful Mexican villagersare given more and more lines, as the adult actors are even worse than the child actors. The accents are inconsistent, and these supposedly south-of-the-border thespians look as if they have never plowed a single furrow or picked up anything heavier than a taco.(However back in the day it may have been much harder to find the excellent caliber of Mexican-American actors that we take for granted today).The ultimate insult to the viewer's intelligence comes when Calvera (Eli Wallach with some bronzer on his face) runs the Seven out of the village, but then kindly gives them all their weapons back once they are a couple miles outside of town. Suddenly Calvera seems far from the ruthless villain we need him to be, in order for the proper amount of bloodlust to be generated for the final battle to have the neccesary cathartic quality.Another disappointing feature is the annoyingly frequent appearance of the simpering Horst Buchholz, as compared to the unfortunate underuse of the considerable talents of James Coburn. (Coburn's lines can be counted on one hand, with fingers left over). Some of Buchholz's scenes (clowning around with a complacent bull, mooning at an inexplicably smitten senorita) have a painfully Disneyesque quality that erodes the fine edge that McQueen and Brynner bring to the film.It just seems like the authentic locations and the several fine actors here could have been put to much better use. Be prepared to enjoy this one merely for the Hollywood nostalgia and overall Wild West atmosphere, but don't try to take it as a serious film or you will be very disappointed.",2,Extreme suspension of disbelief required,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,3147,"['know', 'considered', 'classic', 'theme', 'music', 'sublime', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'prime', 'am', 'not', 'comparing', 'film', 'Kurosawa', 'think', 'unfair', 'comparison', 'apples', 'oranges', 'so', 'speak', 'watching', 'again', 'middle-aged', 'adult', 'found', 'impossible', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'face', 'one', 'silly', 'situation', 'another.First', 'shaven-headed', 'man', 'as', 'pale', 'Chris', 'Adams', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'living', 'riding', 'Texas/Mexico', 'border', 'back', 'neck', ""n't"", 'even', 'pink', 'much', 'less', 'red', 'could', 'have', 'single-handedly', 'terrified', 'evil', 'bandito', 'Calvera', 'men', 'surrendering', 'firing', 'shot', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'spectral', 'emissary', 'unknown', 'world', 'fled', 'panic', 'site', 'wait', 'more', 'ghostly', 'chrome-dome', 'Russian', 'accent', 'one', 'buddies', 'refers', 'Cajun', 'Huh', 'Even', 'more', 'confusing', 'presence', 'young', 'white', 'guy', 'strong', 'German', 'accent', 'named', 'wait', 'Chico', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'Early', 'film', 'Chico', 'lack', 'skill', 'pistol', 'inability', 'hold', 'liquor', 'yet', 'Chris', 'Adams', 'later', 'join', 'Seven', 'apparently', 'Chico', 'good', 'catching', 'cooking', 'fish', 'Presumably', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'facing', 'hail', 'Mexican', 'bullets', 'inept', 'greenhorn', 'side', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'die', 'bellyful', 'tasty', 'trout', 'caught', 'fresh', 'river', '.The', 'film', 'progressively', 'weaker', 'peaceful', 'Mexican', 'villagersare', 'given', 'more', 'more', 'lines', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'child', 'actors', 'accents', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'supposedly', 'south-of-the-border', 'thespians', 'look', 'have', 'never', 'plowed', 'single', 'furrow', 'picked', 'up', 'anything', 'heavier', 'taco', 'However', 'back', 'day', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'harder', 'find', 'excellent', 'caliber', 'Mexican-American', 'actors', 'take', 'granted', 'today', '.The', 'ultimate', 'insult', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'when', 'Calvera', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'bronzer', 'face', 'Seven', 'village', 'then', 'kindly', 'weapons', 'back', 'are', 'couple', 'miles', 'town', 'Suddenly', 'Calvera', 'far', 'ruthless', 'villain', 'need', 'be', 'order', 'proper', 'amount', 'bloodlust', 'be', 'generated', 'final', 'battle', 'have', 'neccesary', 'cathartic', 'quality.Another', 'disappointing', 'feature', 'annoyingly', 'frequent', 'appearance', 'simpering', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'compared', 'unfortunate', 'underuse', 'considerable', 'talents', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Coburn', 'lines', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'one', 'hand', 'fingers', 'left', 'over', 'Buchholz', 'scenes', 'clowning', 'around', 'complacent', 'bull', 'mooning', 'inexplicably', 'smitten', 'senorita', 'have', 'painfully', 'Disneyesque', 'quality', 'fine', 'edge', 'McQueen', 'Brynner', 'bring', 'film.It', 'just', 'authentic', 'locations', 'several', 'fine', 'actors', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'Be', 'prepared', 'enjoy', 'one', 'merely', 'Hollywood', 'nostalgia', 'overall', 'Wild', 'West', 'atmosphere', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'take', 'serious', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed']",The Magnificent Seven VHS

421163,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,630442972X,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 2]","Director John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 epic ""Seven Samurai"" ranks as one of the greatest westerns ever made. Along with Robert Aldritch's shoot'em saga ""Vera Cruz,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" exerted considerable influence the look and subject matter of many later Spaghetti westerns. Sturges had gained an impressive reputation in the genre with two contemporary westerns ""The Walking Hills and ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" as well as his frontier oaters ""The Law and Jake Wade,"" ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" and ""Last Train from Gun Hill."" Sturges specialized in all-male actioneers with tough guys in the life and death situations. Visually, he relied on low-angle photography to give his pictures a larger-than-life look, and he staged his gunfight sequences as if they were football game strategies.Sturges began a long association with ""The Ten Commandants"" composer Elmer Bernstein on ""The Magnificent Seven."" Not only did Bernstein receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score for his music on ""The Magnificent Seven,"" but he also got an Oscar nod when he reprised his score in Burt Kennedy's 1966 sequel ""Return of the Seven."" Aside from Sturges' masterful direction, ""The Magnificent Seven"" boasts a top-notch cast. Sturges was largely responsible for these brilliant casting choices.Many of them, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson, achieved superstar prominence during the 1960s. ""The Magnificent Seven"" was lensed on location by Charles Lang in Durango, Mexico, and on some rather obvious sets at Churubusco Studios, Mexico City. Lang had filmed ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" as well as ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" with Sturges and would go on to shoot the unlikeliest Sturges movie ""A Girl Named Tamiko.""""The Magnificent Seven"" takes place in the late 19th century. The first scene occurs in a small, anonymous Mexican village as a bandit, Calvera (Eli Wallach of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""), and his 40 gunmen steal enough food to feed themselves. After Calvera and his gang depart, the campesinos convene in the square to formulate a plan of defense. ""If he takes our crop, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it,"" laments one farmer. They visit the Old Man (Russian character actor Vladimir Sokoloff of ""Cloak and Dagger"")and seek his advice. ""Fight,"" he urges them. ""Go to the border and buy guns.""The frontier west has settled down and our heroes are roaming the land in search of work. Chris (Oscar winning actor Yul Brynner of ""The King and I"") and Vin cross paths in a dusty little hamlet when the local citizens refuse to let an Indian named Old Sam be buried in a predominantly white cemetery. ""How long has this been going on?"" inquires a traveling salesman. ""Since the town got civilized,"" remarks the undertaker, Chamlee (Whit Bissell) and tries to give corset salesman Henry (Val Avery of ""The Anderson Tapes"") his twenty dollars back. Three of the villagers arrive in town as Chris and Vin decide to drive the hearse up to Boot Hill. ""Never ridden shotgun on a hearse,"" quips Vin. Chris wounds two men trying to block their way and the townspeople unload the coffin and bury it.The three villagers approach Chris and ask him to help them buy guns. ""Men are cheaper than guns,"" Chris advises them and they assemble six men. The pay is a double eagle for four to six weeks with food and board thrown into the bargain. So moved is Chris by their earnestness that he decides to help them. ""I've been offered a lot for my work,"" he assures the Mexicans, ""but never everything."" Initially, Vin is reluctant about joining up. When he learns the job pays twenty dollars, he shrugs, ""Would pay for my bullets."" The third man to join up is gold-seeking Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes that there must be more to it if the Cajun-speaking Chris has decided to him the villagers. Bernando O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is chopping wood for his breakfast when Chris offers him twenty dollars. ""Right now that's a lot of money,"" he agrees. Britt (James Coburn) and Lee (Robert Vaughn) and a Mexican farmer turned gunfighter, Chico (German born actor Horst Buchholz), follow. At first, Chico doesn't make the grade but later he proves his worthiness.The seven teach the villagers to defend themselves with rifles they obtain from Calvera's men sent to spy on them. They also erect new walls in the village. ""They won't keep me out,"" Calvera surveys them on his return to the village with his forty gunmen. Chris explains, ""They were made to keep you in."" A gunfight erupts. All seven survive the first foray, but the triumphant villagers are caught off-guard when Calvera's men hang around. When combat breaks out again, the villagers split into fractions. Half decide hiring the seven constituted a mistake. Chris and company change tactics, mount an offensive against Calvera, but find his camp empty. When they arrive back in the village, the seven discover that one fraction has sold them out, but Calvera refuses to kill them. He fears that their friends from up north might retaliate so he takes their guns and lets his men escort them to the border.""The Magnificent Seven"" brims with irony. The Old Man advises the villagers to buy guns, but Chris tells them that men with guns are cheaper. Although the hiring price of twenty dollars is low, the high-priced O'Reilly joins because ""right now twenty dollars is a lot."" Similarly, Chris signs on because nobody has ever paid him everything. Lee suffers from paranoia so he decides to hide out in the worst place imaginable.
