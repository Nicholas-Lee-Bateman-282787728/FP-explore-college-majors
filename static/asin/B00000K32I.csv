509200,A1JCOLQL6ENZJG,B00000K32I,KC Reviews,"[13, 13]","Izzard proves that he is the greatest living comedian in this video. While I had first caught glimpses of his act during ""Dress Kills"" run on HBO, it was this video that proved to me the real genius that is Eddie Izzard.This T.V. Brit takes on every aspect of the human condition and inevitablely leaves you crying for more. His style is such a refreshing contrast from his contemporaries. His use of explicit language, while there, is used not to shock or offend, but as if you were thinking the same thing to yourself and goes by unnoticed (some moralists will have a field day with that concept).In addition, Izzard's use of story and gesture to communicate his perspective on the world makes him better rounded than his New York megastar peer and master of observation comedy, Jerry Seinfeld. Also, Izzard's comedy is not bent on getting to the punch line and making you laugh. Instead, this is a show that is meant to last 90 minutes and makes you want more.I bought this video nearly two years ago and it still gets play in my VCR. This is not one I leave out for show to prove my friends how cool I am; rather, I put it in the VCR to show how cool I am. This is by far one of the best purchases I have made and would gladly buy it for myself again or for a friend.Izzard's humor is irreverent, but classy, intellectual, but slapstick, and hilarious, but hilarious... there is simply no other way to put it. You need him in your home. You really have no idea how much.

He's one of the absolute best physical comics I have ever seen.  His style jumps all over the place, throwing in wild references when you are least expecting them.  And his James Mason impression is right on!""Glorious"" is an earlier effort preceding the gem referred to by reviewers as D2K.  Some reviewers are saying it's not as good as D2K.  I think this is an unfair evaluation.  This special was geared toward his audience back home, and it is ripe with references from his early shows.  American viewers might say, ""Who is Mrs. Badcrumble?"" for instance.  There is also a language barrier with American and UK audiences, something he brilliantly points out, if you'll remember, in D2K.  You might feel tempted to find a British person and ask them to open their verbal dictionary for you.  But I promise you, once you figure out what things mean, you will find so much more humor in his stories.Some people also find it strange that he is a transvestite.  I will just say that in today's world, nothing should shock you anymore.  In the future, I hope that Eddie is known for his unique performance style and not for his skirts.  I wish Entertainment Tonight would not refer to him as, ""cross-dressing comedian Eddie Izzard.""  It should be ""sensational talent Eddie Izzard"" instead.My suggestion to you is to check out some of Eddie's earlier works if you get the chance.  It's difficult to get videos of his early shows unless you live in England, but if you're serious about getting to know this fantastic comic, Amazon sells an import CD set of his shows ""Unrepeatable"" and ""Definite Article"" in their Popular Music section.  I've had a listen to these and they are wonderful.In the meantime, enjoy this show featuring:  Sean Connery building the Arc, God creating toasters and jam, the queen who lives forever, Achilles and his hoovering heel, and the evil habits of giraffes, ducks, and pilot fish.

Moore,"[1, 1]","While ""Dress to Kill"" is the definitive Eddie Izzard DVD (the ""Cake or Death?"" routine on that disc is probably the greatest single comedy bit of the last two decades), ""Glorious"" suffers only in comparison. Measured by any other standard, it's flat-out hilarious, period. The combination of Izzard's razor-sharp wit, offhand delivery, fluid stage movements and decidedly singular appearance makes for hilarious comedy that only those who have seen him in action can fully imagine. (Every Izzard performance contains throwaway bits that you'll cherish forever; in ""Glorious,"" my favorite is his impression of an evil giraffe.) Only Robin Williams matches Izzard's free-associative brilliance, and I prefer Izzard's style because, unlike Williams, he doesn't feel the need to call attention to it every second.

Our favorite cross-dresser is in top form, opening with a parody movie trailer of Eddie as himself in an action thriller set in New York. The show is loosely structured around a comic and impious survey of dramatic moments from the Bible, including the Creation and the Flood, in which a pair of ducks decline to board Noah's ark. Noah himself has to be persuaded not to build a speedboat instead.Physical humor abounds (including a galumphing giraffe), and there are the usual and much appreciated impersonations of James Mason and Sean Connery. The 90-minute concert concludes with a lengthy and hilarious sequence involving an uncooperative computer. The DVD includes both a commentary by Eddie and a ""trivia version"" of the show, with oddball factoids showing up in subtitles.

From the opening chords  of music, carefully choreographed against a light show more common to rock  stars than comics, GLORIOUS puts you on notice that this ain't just a guy  with a mike.  And indeed the reaction of the crowd to Izzard's spotlit  entrance makes you believe that you are witness to royalty.Until he  speaks.  And then you realize that he's just a guy.  In drag.  Who hasn't  really rehearsed all that much.Thank God.Rehearsal would only cloud  things with certainty.Izzard attempts majesty-GLORIOUS is essentially  a tour of the Bible's greatest hits-but doesn't mind if he forgets how to  get there.  He frequently looks spoilt for choice, slowly deciding where he  should go next. And this is perhaps where he's at his most charming.  Sometimes he seems liable to fall off the trapeze he's built for himself.  But his gaffes are incorporated into his act to the point that you find  yourself actively HOPING he'll screw up, just so you can witness his  escape.And that's his secret.  By screwing up and laughing about it,  he proves himself uniquely able to get an audience on his side.  Far from  being simply a hilarious way to spend a couple of hours, GLORIOUS should be  required in freshman communication classes at college.  It's masterful  public speaking masquerading as comedy.[VHS Notes:  The recording here  is of fine quality.  The audio technicians were dead on target.  Oddly,  though, the choice of venue might have resulted in a performance that isn't  as universally understandable as the show was in its original form.  For  reasons obscure, what had been a mostly off-Broadway, American show was  recorded for posterity before a British audience.  He's clearly energized  playing to a home crowd, but if you were hoping this would capture the  great live show you saw in New York, prepare to be slightly disappointed.  Non-Britons definitely  lose something in the translation. Also, parents  should be cautioned that the language is probably unsuitable for younger  viewers, though it doesn't sink to the level of gratuitous vulgarity in my  estimation.  Some parents may object to liberties taken with the Bible,  but I think his act just proves the point of how central the Bible is to  western civilization.]",5,Gloriously under-rehearsed,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,2372,"['What', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'work', 'way', 'able', 'be', 'grand', 'self-deprecating', 'simultaneously', 'opening', 'chords', 'music', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'light', 'show', 'more', 'common', 'rock', 'stars', 'comics', 'GLORIOUS', 'notice', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'guy', 'mike', 'indeed', 'reaction', 'crowd', 'Izzard', 'spotlit', 'entrance', 'believe', 'are', 'witness', 'royalty.Until', 'then', 'realize', 'just', 'guy', 'drag', 'Who', ""n't"", 'really', 'rehearsed', 'much.Thank', 'God.Rehearsal', 'would', 'only', 'cloud', 'things', 'certainty.Izzard', 'attempts', 'majesty-GLORIOUS', 'essentially', 'tour', 'Bible', 'greatest', 'hits-but', ""n't"", 'mind', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'frequently', 'spoilt', 'choice', 'slowly', 'deciding', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'next', 'perhaps', 'where', 'most', 'charming', 'Sometimes', 'liable', 'fall', 'off', 'trapeze', 'built', 'gaffes', 'are', 'incorporated', 'act', 'point', 'find', 'actively', 'HOPING', ""'ll"", 'screw', 'up', 'just', 'can', 'witness', 'escape.And', 'secret', 'screwing', 'up', 'laughing', 'uniquely', 'able', 'get', 'audience', 'side', 'Far', 'being', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'GLORIOUS', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'freshman', 'communication', 'classes', 'college', 'masterful', 'public', 'speaking', 'masquerading', 'comedy', '[', 'VHS', 'Notes', 'recording', 'here', 'fine', 'quality', 'audio', 'technicians', 'were', 'dead', 'target', 'Oddly', 'though', 'choice', 'venue', 'might', 'have', 'resulted', 'performance', ""n't"", 'universally', 'understandable', 'show', 'was', 'original', 'form', 'reasons', 'obscure', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'mostly', 'off-Broadway', 'American', 'show', 'was', 'recorded', 'posterity', 'British', 'audience', 'clearly', 'energized', 'playing', 'home', 'crowd', 'were', 'hoping', 'would', 'capture', 'great', 'live', 'show', 'saw', 'New', 'York', 'prepare', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Non-Britons', 'definitely', 'lose', 'something', 'translation', 'Also', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'cautioned', 'language', 'probably', 'unsuitable', 'younger', 'viewers', ""n't"", 'sink', 'level', 'gratuitous', 'vulgarity', 'estimation', 'parents', 'may', 'object', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Bible', 'think', 'act', 'just', 'point', 'how', 'central', 'Bible', 'western', 'civilization', ']']",Eddie Izzard - Glorious VHS
