338971,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,6302816610,Bill Smith,"[2, 3]","Bank Guard: What the Hell kind of clown are you?Grimm: The crying on the inside kind, I guess.That line typifies the kind of understated classic delivery of Bill Murray throughout this great overlooked film. When people name Murray's best movies, they tend to forget about this one for some reason, because it was not a huge box office hit like Stripes or Ghostbusters. This is more along the lines of Groundhog Day or What About Bob? Bill Murray. Its kind of a lighthearted spin on an earlier more serious New York bank robbery/hostage movie, Dog Day Afternoon mixed with a little bit of Jack Lemmon's The Out of Towners thrown in. Both films emphasize the neuroticism and wackiness of urban New York City as a common backdrop, and Murray (who made his directing debut with this film) uses that complex and quirky milieu to tell the story of 3 'normal' people(Murray, Geena Davis and Randy Quaid) who just want to rob a bank and get out of the city which has seemingly entrapped them as they try to make their escape to a tropical island.Murray robs the bank dressed as a clown and his deadpan lines are classic Murray schtick throughout. Along the way of trying to leave New York City, they encounter hostages willing to buy freedom for a $12,000 watch ""with a moon on it"", street workers who don't know what streets they are working on as a lady screams at them about the noise from her apartment window, a con man hustler who doesn't realize they have a million bucks taped to their bodies as he steals their luggage and 4 measly dollars from Grimm's wallet, confused cabbies who don't speak English, and an anal retentive bus driver (""Ralph Kramden's evil twin"") who demands exact change before they can cross the white line in the bus. The trio even manages to rob the mob as they try to extricate themselves out of close call after close call.The subtle comedic and cultural references are numerous and perfectly timed. He banters with the Police Chief (Jason Robards) about being in Nam all the while delaying and trying to throw the police off with ridiculous demands like Monster Trucks (Chief: ""at least give me the women"". Grimm: ""get your own women!""). As they try to escape the robbery and New York City, the police chief can only hope that they are ""mired down by the same s*** we have to wade through every day"". And they are, with priceless little lines and scenes which depict this manic neurotic sludge like a stressed woman blurting out randomly ""this isn't my regular route--my husband's in intensive care"" on the bus and Grimm's exasperated attempts to speed up a slow as molasses old lady customer in line in a shop so he can get change to board the bus with the mob and the cops closing in on him.Randy Quaid probably overplays his dumb sidekick part a bit and Geena Davis's pregnancy is a bit overemphasized, but this is a great comedic slice of life movie that is fast paced and over far too soon. I laugh out loud every time I see the police detectives dusting the clown balloons left in the bank for prints........add--this movie would be a great triple feature with the aforementioned New York-centric films Dog Day Afternoon and the original Out of Towners with Jack Lemmon. For movies which celebrate the joys of city life in New York, try Woody Allen's Manhattan and the relatively little known A Thousand Clowns, which ironically stars......Jason Robards in a much earlier and very interesting role.",5,An underrated Bill Murray comedic gem that only smart people will appreciate,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,3432,"['Bank', 'Guard', 'What', 'Hell', 'kind', 'clown', 'are', 'crying', 'inside', 'kind', 'guess.That', 'line', 'kind', 'understated', 'classic', 'delivery', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'great', 'overlooked', 'film', 'When', 'people', 'name', 'Murray', 'best', 'movies', 'tend', 'forget', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'Stripes', 'Ghostbusters', 'more', 'lines', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'What', 'Bob', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'kind', 'lighthearted', 'spin', 'earlier', 'more', 'serious', 'New', 'York', 'bank', 'robbery/hostage', 'movie', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'mixed', 'little', 'bit', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Out', 'Towners', 'thrown', 'films', 'emphasize', 'neuroticism', 'wackiness', 'urban', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'common', 'backdrop', 'Murray', 'who', 'made', 'directing', 'debut', 'film', 'complex', 'quirky', 'milieu', 'tell', 'story', '3', ""'normal"", 'people', 'Murray', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'rob', 'bank', 'get', 'city', 'seemingly', 'entrapped', 'try', 'make', 'escape', 'tropical', 'island.Murray', 'robs', 'bank', 'dressed', 'clown', 'deadpan', 'lines', 'are', 'classic', 'Murray', 'schtick', 'way', 'trying', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'encounter', 'hostages', 'willing', 'buy', 'freedom', '12,000', 'watch', 'moon', 'street', 'workers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'working', 'lady', 'screams', 'noise', 'apartment', 'window', 'con', 'man', 'hustler', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'have', 'million', 'bucks', 'taped', 'bodies', 'luggage', '4', 'measly', 'dollars', 'Grimm', 'wallet', 'confused', 'cabbies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'anal', 'retentive', 'bus', 'driver', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'evil', 'twin', 'who', 'exact', 'change', 'can', 'cross', 'white', 'line', 'bus', 'trio', 'even', 'rob', 'mob', 'try', 'extricate', 'close', 'call', 'close', 'call.The', 'subtle', 'comedic', 'cultural', 'references', 'are', 'numerous', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'being', 'Nam', 'while', 'delaying', 'trying', 'throw', 'police', 'ridiculous', 'demands', 'Monster', 'Trucks', 'Chief', 'least', 'give', 'women', 'Grimm', 'get', 'own', 'women', 'try', 'escape', 'robbery', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'chief', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'mired', 'down', 'same', 's***', 'have', 'wade', 'day', 'are', 'priceless', 'little', 'lines', 'scenes', 'depict', 'manic', 'neurotic', 'sludge', 'stressed', 'woman', 'blurting', 'out', 'randomly', ""n't"", 'regular', 'route', 'husband', 'intensive', 'care', 'bus', 'Grimm', 'exasperated', 'attempts', 'speed', 'up', 'slow', 'molasses', 'old', 'lady', 'customer', 'line', 'shop', 'can', 'get', 'change', 'board', 'bus', 'mob', 'cops', 'closing', 'him.Randy', 'Quaid', 'probably', 'dumb', 'sidekick', 'part', 'bit', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'pregnancy', 'bit', 'overemphasized', 'great', 'comedic', 'slice', 'life', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'far', 'too', 'soon', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'time', 'see', 'police', 'detectives', 'dusting', 'clown', 'balloons', 'left', 'bank', 'prints', '..add', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'triple', 'feature', 'aforementioned', 'New', 'York-centric', 'films', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'original', 'Out', 'Towners', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'movies', 'celebrate', 'joys', 'city', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'try', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Manhattan', 'relatively', 'little', 'known', 'Thousand', 'Clowns', 'ironically', 'stars', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'much', 'earlier', 'very', 'interesting', 'role']",N/A

338976,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6302816610,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","This is a clever and entertaining comedy that has some dramatic and romantic touches as well. It's almost two movies-in-one: a dramatic holdup and a comic getaway. The holdup scene does has comedy but is more dramatic. It reminded me of the '70s classic ""Dog Day Afternoon"" in which the hostages are kept by a couple of robbers and the crooks demand the normal assortment of getaway vehicles. Except in here, ringleader Bill Murray wants a ""monster truck"" along with everything else. You know with Murray you are going to get outrageous humor and satire.****spoilers alert****  Anyway, the bulk of the film concerns what happens after the trio - Murray, Randy Quaid and Geena Davis -escape from the holdup scene. The bottom line is that they just can't get out of New York City. One disaster after another keeps happening, and it's all kind funny (and frustrating!). The ending I won't spoil.Murray plays his normal wise-guy role and Quaid is good as the emotional slapstick-type buffoon.  Davis complements the two with her coolness and eye candy for the male audience. Veteran Jason Robards plays the chief detective on the case, and shows comedic touches of his own.What also is fun to watch nowadays is Tony Shalhoub. When this film came out, hardly anyone knew him. Now he's famous as ""Monk"" on the television series of the same name. In this film, he plays an Arabic cab driver and you have to see this performance to believe it!

338977,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302816610,Craig Matteson,"[8, 9]","Most heist films spend a lot of time setting up the robbery.  This one begins in the bank and we don't know what is going on until after the robbery is over and the chase has begun.  This story centers on the impossible getaway from a New York that has fallen apart and become a nightmare for everyone.  What mattered to people is being torn down, no one trusts or is willing to help anyone else, and in the pre-Giulliani days, crime was rampant.  No wonder Bill Murray's Grimm wants to leave his city job by robbing a bank and heading to Fiji or Martinique.  Certainly, Murray has done finer things, but this is a good performance.  He is also credited as one of the directors.The film is full of wonderful characters.  Tony Shaloub's cab driver (especially his bus horn) is wonderfully memorable and he steals the scenes he is in.  Philip Bosco's bus driver is a character that is never to be forgotten.  For me, it was the first time I noticed him as an actor and it has since shocked me how many wonderful roles he has played in a fine career.  This bus driver is just such a piece of work that he burns into your memory.Jason Robards had a couple of dozen roles left in a legendary career, but he portrays the tired but dogged Chief Rotzinger perfectly.  He wants to get out of his job, but wants to go out on top, but has a couple of loose ends that haunt him.  And now this bank robbery endangers his reputation even more right at the end and threatens to accentuate the things that didn't go well in his long career.Geena Davis plays Phyllis and is Grimm's girlfriend.  She is loyal to him and yet the robbery has changed something in the dynamic of their relationship (ya think?) that makes her wonder whether she can be anything more than a member of his gang.  So, this love story is whether or not there will be a love story.Randy Quaid is perfect as Grimm's friend Loomis.  He is a bumbler that always means well, but can't seem to do three things in a row without causing a new issue.  For some reason Quaid can pull off performances that would be over the top for anyone else and yet we can accept them because of the way he plays the role.There are many other small roles by wonderful actors such as Stanley Tucci, Phil Hartman (whom we still miss), Victor Argo, Kurtwood Smith, Gary Klar, and several others.

338978,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6302816610,Cubist,"[6, 8]","Adapted from Jay Conley's original novel, Quick Change is a neglected comedy that delights in gleefully thumbing its nose at the city so nice they named it twice.The first third of Quick Change-the bank heist-is the best part of the film. It is a brilliant starting point that demonstrates Bill Murray at his sarcastic best. He gleefully fools and infuriates the cops, the media, and even the hostages with his flippant attitude. His disposition is understandable when juxtaposed with the media circus that occurs outside the bank. Curiousity seekers and the media, smelling a potential story, flock to the scene. Even hot dog vendors race each other for the best vantage point to hock their wares. Everybody is looking to exploit the situation in some fashion and this makes the desire for Murray and company to succeed all the more significant.However, for all the comic ingenuousness of the opening scene, Quick Change begins to slowly unravel as the trio attempt to leave New York City and encounter more and more absurd situations that gradually escalate to unrealistic proportions. What makes these circumstances nonsensical is the ease that Murray's character is able to conveniently resolve them. It is not that the rest of the film is bad necessarily, it is just that it comes as a let down after such an excellent beginning.Where his contemporaries like Steve Martin and Chevy Chase have softened their edge over time (see Father of the Bride and Cops and Robbersons respectively), Murray seems to get more and more acerbic with every film. He had not been that good since he did Ghostbusters way back in 1984.The constant supply of comical cameos keeps the rest of the film watchable. The always entertaining Phil Hartman appears as an anxiety-ridden Yuppie who holds the trio at gunpoint when he mistakenly thinks that they are breaking into his new apartment. The scene is a great battle of talents as he and Murray square off against each other. Tony Shalhoub makes an appearance as a hopelessly incoherent foreign taxi cab driver who delays the robbers from escaping the city.Sadly, the film disappeared rather quickly upon its release. Perhaps its cynical view of New York City was too much for mainstream tastes. It is too bad because this is quite an entertaining film that only suffers from a weak ending, but is also filled with exceptional performances. Watching Quick Change reminds one of his vintage roles in the aforementioned Ghostbusters and Stripes, and shows that he has a legitimate shot at becoming a director. Let's hope his next directorial effort is without a chaperone.Unfortunately, the only extra is a trailer for the movie.

338990,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302816610,JGC,"[3, 3]","""Quick Change"" is just as exciting as it is funny!This little-known 1990 movie stars Bill Murray who's also wearing another hat as director (as Grimm, the harried NYer,) Geena Davis (as Phyllis Potter) and Randy Quaid (Loomis.) Rounding out the cast in some very comical roles are Jason Robards (as Rotzinger) and Richard Joseph Paul (as Lt. Jameson.)""Quick Change"" has to be one of my all-time, top-five favorite movies because it is so incredibly hilarious and clever. Bill Murrary is especially stupefying. He just has such perfect timing and such perfect face expressions. (I love when Grimm says to the lady on the bus, who's busy shaving a man's head, ""you're gonna even that out."") This film is also Mr. Murray's directorial debut and if I didn't know any better I would swear that he has been doing this for years.The movie is basically the proverbial wish for anyone in NY; get the hell out of the city with a huge bag of money! With the help of his girlfriend, Phyllis, and his brother, Loomis, Grimm attempts to make all his dreams come true!Some of the funniest, laugh-till-you-can't-stop clips were in the beginning after the clown (Grimm) locks everyone inside the vault. I love it when Phyllis says, ""you're all a bunch of pussies"" as she's apparently playing along as one of the innocent victims. BTW, when it comes on TV, they replace pussies with ""patsies"" which sounds even more funny!Once the gang hit the road they have a few pratfalls and wind up getting lost. I couldn't stop laughing when they stumbled across that jousting match with the two gentlemen with the hoes on the bikes. Loomis tries to ask them for directions, before racing off saying, ""it's bad luck just seeing a thing like that..."" And, incidentally, did you notice how they just couldn't find their bearing? This is totally believable because NY is horrible driving in. The part where they stopped to ask the construction men for directions was also too comical. Grimm asks them for directions (as they're taking down the signs,) and one of the guys says, ""I'm not from around here,"" just as a lady from across the street screams out the window to them, ""shuuuuuuuuuut uuuuup.""After being held up at gunpoint (the crook only got 4 bucks!) Grimm, Phyllis and Loomis go to Phyllis' apartment to change. As they're changing Edison (played by the late, great Phil Hartman) walks in (who is the new tenant) and pulls a gun out as he yells to his wife, ""we were held up three times in the Village, I'm not gonna let it happen again."" Of course Grimm is able to talk his way out of it though!They finally find a taxi, but he is pretty out of it. Tony Shalhoub plays the cab driver, an innocent, yet very inept person who doesn't know what the meaning of a red traffic light is! When Loomis sees another cab he opens the door and jumps out; as the car is moving!!I also love the part when Grimm and co. walk into that old abandoned building (that the mob is occupying!) And Johnny (Stanley Tucci) points a gun on Grimm and says, ""this ain't my d-i-c-k in your back,"" and Grimm says without even blinking, ""that's a relief.""They finally make it to Kennedy and decide to split up. Grimm and Loomis go in the men's room to hide their money; as Grimm says, ""those darn terrorists make it tough for us bank robbers."" As Grimm and Loomis were sharing a stall (Loomis could barely walk after jumping out of the cab) an old man looks on in disgust and says, ""you people can keep this city!"" Aparently he was disgusted by those noises Loomis was making as Grimm was helping to undress him to get the money taped to his body! Sooooooooooo funny!!!...With Loomis in a wheelchair, they go rolling for their lives as they run onto the plane, in just the nick of time! Just as they enter the jet, the miserable stewardess says to Grimm, ""you think you're late enough."" And Grimm says, ""oh you must be from around here."" I loooooove it!! It just can't get any better than that!!I have absolutely no idea why the movie is rated-R though? Except for a couple of F words, there is really nothing in this that anyone would find objectionable. If you enjoyed this movie, you may want to pick up thebookthat it's based on. If you'd like to see Billy Murray (why he has not won an Oscar yet is mind-boggling!) in another awesome movie, I highly recomendWhat About Bob?.The DVD is great and I am sure it will last for years and years.

Yes, during the final arc of the film there are several flat scenes, but they're still pretty funny, and don't detract from the overall film.See it for the wealth of abundance in it's details.  Tony Shaloub's cab driver is burned into my brain.  The music is upbeat, instantly recognizable.  Jason Robards is unflappable.  Watch the policeman pose for applause as he steps out of the monster truck.  See a clown point a gun at a small dog.Really, the best you can say about this movie is that it brings the funny.  If you haven't seen it, go out and rectify the situation.  And let's see a DVD!  I'd love to hear some director's commentary on this.",4,&iexcl;Flores!  &iexcl;Flores de los muertos!,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,1254,"['always', 'fun', 'introduce', 'people', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'it.In', 'nutshell', 'clown', 'walks', 'bank', 'robs', 'off', 'hitch', 'two', 'accomplices', 'left', 'make', 'airport', 'get', 'country', 'simple', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'theater', 'saw', 'was', 'prepared', 'what', 'followed', 'best', 'times', 'movie', 'so', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doubled', 'over', 'seat', 'quot', 'jousting', 'quot', 'scene', 'ranks', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'screen', 'comedy', 'time', 'Yes', 'final', 'arc', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'flat', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'still', 'pretty', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'film.See', 'wealth', 'abundance', 'details', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'cab', 'driver', 'burned', 'brain', 'music', 'upbeat', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'unflappable', 'Watch', 'policeman', 'pose', 'applause', 'monster', 'truck', 'See', 'clown', 'point', 'gun', 'small', 'dog.Really', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'funny', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'go', 'out', 'rectify', 'situation', 'let', 'see', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'director', 'commentary']",N/A

It's perfectly executed. The only thing that gets in the way is the city in which they operate. The city that spawned these crooks, also spawned the madness (the same madness that frustrated Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in THE OUT OF TOWNERS) that get in the way of their getaway. From the opening scene of Bill Murray in a clown costume, I knew I was in for a quirky film, but it was much more than that. This was a surprisingly funny movie that captures the essential oddities of the city. Philip Bosco plays a bus driver who would better be suited as a Marine drill sergeant at Parris Island, and he's just one of the eccentrics. I won't give anything else away.

339014,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,6302816610,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Bill Murray has made some hilarious movies that everyone remembers like Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, and Groundhog Day. Quick Change is classic Murray that rightfully belongs with those aforementioned films but, for some reason, faded rapidly into obscurity. And, as an added bonus for viewers, Quick Change is also a nifty heist film as well.Murray plays a city worker who hatches an ingenious plan to rob a New York City bank while dressed as a clown (the heist's central gimmick has been copied several times in other films, most notably by Spike Lee). The robbery itself goes off without a hitch in the film's first fifteen minutes, leaving Murray and accomplices Geena Davis and Randy Quaid to make their escape from the city while flustered cop Jason Robards tries to catch them.Of course, things go horribly wrong for the robbers after that as they run afoul of every New York City tourist horror story imaginable: gangsters and street punks, cabbies who don't speak English, snippy shop keepers, and rude bus drivers, all of which combine to threaten the timing of the getaway. A lot of this is familiar territory, and this part of the film does drag from time to time (despite a 90-minute overall running time), but the comic talents of Murray and Randy Quaid keep things lively.Murray supplies his usual dry satiric wit, continually finding ways to point out the ridiculous plight he and his gang have gotten themselves into. Naturally, for a movie like this to work, someone has to blow his cool, and the dimwitted Quaid serves as a good blustery and ineffective counterpoint to Murray here. Adding to the fun, the movie skillfully juxtaposes Robard's wildly inaccurate predictions of how the criminals are outwitting his cops with the far more frustrating reality of the mess Murray and company are in.Sadly, this movie had a blink-and-you'll-miss-it run in movie theaters twenty years ago. Fortunately for Murray fans however, this budget-priced DVD offers another chance to see Bill at his best. It's an essential addition to his comic library.",4,Hidden Murray Gem,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,2055,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'made', 'hilarious', 'movies', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'Caddyshack', 'Ghostbusters', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Quick', 'Change', 'classic', 'Murray', 'rightfully', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'reason', 'faded', 'rapidly', 'obscurity', 'added', 'bonus', 'viewers', 'Quick', 'Change', 'also', 'nifty', 'heist', 'film', 'well.Murray', 'city', 'worker', 'who', 'ingenious', 'plan', 'rob', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'bank', 'while', 'dressed', 'clown', 'heist', 'central', 'gimmick', 'been', 'copied', 'several', 'times', 'other', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'robbery', 'off', 'hitch', 'film', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'Murray', 'accomplices', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'make', 'escape', 'city', 'flustered', 'cop', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'catch', 'them.Of', 'course', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'robbers', 'run', 'afoul', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tourist', 'horror', 'story', 'imaginable', 'gangsters', 'street', 'punks', 'cabbies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'snippy', 'shop', 'keepers', 'rude', 'bus', 'drivers', 'combine', 'threaten', 'timing', 'getaway', 'lot', 'familiar', 'territory', 'part', 'film', 'drag', 'time', 'time', '90-minute', 'overall', 'running', 'time', 'comic', 'talents', 'Murray', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'keep', 'things', 'lively.Murray', 'supplies', 'usual', 'dry', 'satiric', 'wit', 'continually', 'finding', 'ways', 'point', 'out', 'ridiculous', 'plight', 'gang', 'have', 'gotten', 'Naturally', 'movie', 'work', 'someone', 'blow', 'cool', 'dimwitted', 'Quaid', 'good', 'blustery', 'ineffective', 'counterpoint', 'Murray', 'here', 'Adding', 'fun', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'Robard', 'wildly', 'inaccurate', 'predictions', 'how', 'criminals', 'are', 'outwitting', 'cops', 'far', 'more', 'frustrating', 'reality', 'mess', 'Murray', 'company', 'are', 'in.Sadly', 'movie', 'had', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'run', 'movie', 'theaters', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Fortunately', 'Murray', 'fans', 'however', 'budget-priced', 'DVD', 'chance', 'see', 'Bill', 'best', 'essential', 'addition', 'comic', 'library']",N/A
