This is one of the better ones, in  that it gathers footage from all different sources and perspectives,To me, the question is not are these films any good. Anyone with a little skill and an editing machine can put the abundance of footage of 9/11 together and tell the story.More interesting is WHY watch this. We all know what happened on that day, yet each year we see these films. Obviously people watch, or they would not air,Does it help to remember that day? Do we heal from seeing it, regaining a visceral sense of 9/11? We have since become more polarized than we were before that day--right after which we all seemed united. Does watching this film remind us of some of what we are arguing about?I still can't decide the exact function of a film like this, but as I watch this film, as I think of Afganestan and Iraq, Bush and Obama, I realize that this is very quickly becoming a long time ago.But there are a whole bunch of fourth and fifth and sixth graders who  were just babies on 9/11. They won't remember that soon before this, we were worried why our tech stocks were swooning, if Bush or Gore got a dimpled chad or a hanging chad. If Gary Condit slept with Sandra Levy.But this is the world 9/11 robbed us of, and this  is still impacting our culture, our laws, our politics, and our daily lives in a million subtle ways.Pretty soon most young adults will not know a world before that day.  They will experience the what--having to have five documents to get a  driving license, a long wait at an airport. But they will need to see the why--how one day made the world they know.Maybe these films are for them",5,no rating,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1685,"['day', 'today', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'documentaries', '9/11', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'footage', 'different', 'sources', 'perspectives', 'question', 'not', 'are', 'films', 'good', 'Anyone', 'little', 'skill', 'editing', 'machine', 'can', 'put', 'abundance', 'footage', '9/11', 'together', 'tell', 'story.More', 'interesting', 'WHY', 'watch', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'yet', 'year', 'see', 'films', 'Obviously', 'people', 'watch', 'would', 'not', 'air', 'help', 'remember', 'day', 'Do', 'heal', 'seeing', 'regaining', 'visceral', 'sense', '9/11', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'polarized', 'were', 'day', 'right', 'seemed', 'united', 'watching', 'film', 'remind', 'what', 'are', 'arguing', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'exact', 'function', 'film', 'watch', 'film', 'think', 'Afganestan', 'Iraq', 'Bush', 'Obama', 'realize', 'very', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'whole', 'bunch', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'graders', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'babies', '9/11', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'soon', 'were', 'worried', 'why', 'tech', 'stocks', 'were', 'swooning', 'Bush', 'Gore', 'got', 'dimpled', 'chad', 'hanging', 'chad', 'Gary', 'Condit', 'slept', 'Sandra', 'Levy.But', 'world', '9/11', 'robbed', 'still', 'impacting', 'culture', 'laws', 'politics', 'daily', 'lives', 'million', 'subtle', 'ways.Pretty', 'soon', 'most', 'young', 'adults', 'will', 'not', 'know', 'world', 'day', 'will', 'experience', 'what', 'having', 'have', 'five', 'documents', 'get', 'driving', 'license', 'long', 'wait', 'airport', 'will', 'need', 'see', 'why', 'how', 'one', 'day', 'made', 'world', 'know.Maybe', 'films', 'are']",102 MINUTES THAT CHANGED AMERI

Its a moment like so many others in this fine documentary, that genuinely captures the fear, confusion and terror of September 11, 2001 in a way that few other documentaries have succeeded in doing.While there are many documentaries about September 11th, including some very well produced ones, few are as evocative as this program. Instead of repeating news broadcasts and footage of official reactions as the events of that terrible day unfolded, the producers instead chose to do away with familiar images and soundbites and instead edit together an amazing record of the events using only the video footage shot by average people. What unfolds is a minute by minute account, told from dozens of perspectives without a single line of narration or ""expert"" soundbite. If the intent was to give the viewer the sense that they've been transported back to that day to relive a host of emotions, then they have succeeded.Its the kind of documentary that everyone should see at least once.",5,Remarkable Approach to Life Changing Event,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1316,"['midpoint', 'spellbinding', 'documentary', '102', 'Minutes', 'Changed', 'America', 'terrified', 'confused', 'witnesses', 'scramble', 'escape', 'dust', 'cloud', 'just', 'collapsed', 'Tower', 'Two', 'newsman', 'voice', 'announces', 'Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'are', 'times', 'lives', 'are', 'life', 'changing', 'be', 'one', 'moment', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'fine', 'documentary', 'genuinely', 'fear', 'confusion', 'terror', 'September', '11', '2001', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'documentaries', 'have', 'succeeded', 'doing.While', 'are', 'many', 'documentaries', 'September', '11th', 'including', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'ones', 'few', 'are', 'as', 'evocative', 'program', 'Instead', 'repeating', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'footage', 'official', 'reactions', 'events', 'terrible', 'day', 'unfolded', 'producers', 'instead', 'chose', 'do', 'away', 'familiar', 'images', 'soundbites', 'instead', 'edit', 'together', 'amazing', 'record', 'events', 'using', 'only', 'video', 'footage', 'shot', 'average', 'people', 'What', 'minute', 'minute', 'account', 'told', 'dozens', 'perspectives', 'single', 'line', 'narration', 'expert', 'soundbite', 'intent', 'was', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'been', 'transported', 'back', 'day', 'relive', 'host', 'emotions', 'then', 'have', 'succeeded.Its', 'kind', 'documentary', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once']",102 MINUTES THAT CHANGED AMERI
1172717,AMPW2XLJQISVZ,B001BNFR26,"Cory B. ""Ronnie Milsap""","[0, 1]","Quite possibly the finest documentary ever made, this incredible movie puts the viewer right on the streets of New York City on that terrifying September morning of 2001 to experience the most shocking and tragic event in American history as it unfolds minute by minute. It creates the feeling that you are standing blocks away from the World Trade Center with a video camera in your hand while the chaos of 9-11 happens all around you.This film provides an unbiased, up close and personal look at September 11th that you will never get from your preferred news channel of the day. I'm amazed at just how much video footage was shot by eyewitnesses on the streets of Manhatten that morning in such a short period of time. The raw, amateur video that makes up the entire movie captures so much detail of that morning and is edited together so masterfully it feels like you are watching a Hollywood movie instead of the real thing.Shocked passersby with their jaws dropped open at Times Square while the towers burn before their eyes...firefighters marching into the area to save lives...screams of horror as the hijacked plane explodes into the south tower...trapped victims leaning out the windows of the towers as they wait for rescue...people running for their lives from the massive cloud of debris that covers the city as the two towers crumble to the ground...this documentary puts you right in the middle of all of it.The attack of the second plane shot by a female college student from her apartment window is some of the most chilling, unforgettable video footage ever caught on camera! It is the most disturbing scene in the entire movie that will leave your jaw hanging open. Suprisingly and thankfully, there are no gory, violent scenes to make this completely unsuitable for younger viewers, although it is too intense for young children.The History Channel has produced a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking thanks to the many ordinary people who grabbed their cameras that morning to record a historic tragedy that we will never forget. This is a must see movie for anyone who wants to know what it felt like to witness that tragic, unforgettable day on the streets of New York City. Perhaps best of all, this documentary presents the events of 9-11 with no liberal or conservative bias in the way to distort what really happened. This DVD is clearly not a CNN or Fox News production, and for that I am thankful. This documentary is the REAL DEAL that should be seen by everyone, especially those too young to remember a tragedy that changed America forever.In our never-ending search for the ""real deal"", our primary collective goal as students in the school of modern life must be to immerse ourselves in a balanced and thought-provoking exploration of the American experience that is NOT distorted by the maddening...indeed blinding...liberal/conservative bias that saturates mainstream news media and serves only to bitterly divide the citizens of a suffering nation aching under the merciless weight and burden of chaos, greed, animosity, and intolerance. In these grim, bleak times of 21st century America, we must grasp with clenched fists now more than ever the immortal virtues of PEACE, LOVE, and KINDNESS that should provide the true purpose and meaning of our lives while directing our every move.

The average person videotaping from her living room in a high rise apartment just blocks away the Twin Towers, and the average tourist recording reactions of people in Time Square.  In addition, the filmmakers wisely opted to forgo including narration, and rely on only minimal title cards to inform the audience where the video was being filmed, the time, and so forth.Some of these amateur videographers provide running commentary for us, expressing their disbelief at what is unfolding.  Some of them talk to loved ones who are nearby or record people around them, including strangers.  Still others record in abject silence.  The videos at the beginning of the documentary reflect the initial confusion as people saw the first tower ablaze.  People speculate that it was just a small plane that got lost.  Eventually, the videographers and people in the streets realize that it was a terrorist act.  We hear the screams and panic as the second plane hits - these moments are among the most gut-wrenching and dramatic.  One group of people near the Twin Towers decide hastily to evacuate their apartment, and we witness as they frantically put on their shoes and pile into an elevator.There is no filter here.  No Katie Couric to reassuringly tell us that the President is acting to neutralize the threat.  No CNN to analyze who may be responsible.  No buffer from the anguish and pain, including the horrifying realization people have when they finally understand that what they thought was debris falling from the towers is actually people jumping from the buildings.  The footage is raw and most people will find watching ""102 Minutes"" to be a draining experience.  However, it is important to recall what we all experienced that day.  This documentary from the History Chanel is a first-rate effort to preserve these events forever.",5,Extraordinary Documentary,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,2569,"['aftermath', 'attacks', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'was', 'likely', 'most', 'videotaped', 'event', 'human', 'history', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'New', 'Jerseyites', 'other', 'locals', 'tourists', 'started', 'filming', 'shortly', 'first', 'tower', 'was', 'hit', 'continued', 'day', 'sometimes', 'own', 'peril', '102', 'Minutes', 'Changed', 'America', 'documents', 'what', 'saw', 'what', 'filmed', 'film', 'relies', 'very', 'little', 'video', 'reporters', 'major', 'networks', 'times', 'can', 'hear', 'television', 'radio', 'playing', 'background', 'people', 'film', 'Instead', 'filmmakers', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'have', 'woven', 'together', 'skillfully', 'dozens', 'amateur', 'videos', 'more', 'accurately', 'capture', 'how', 'people', 'reacted', 'historic', 'day', 'average', 'person', 'videotaping', 'living', 'room', 'high', 'rise', 'apartment', 'just', 'away', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'average', 'tourist', 'recording', 'reactions', 'people', 'Time', 'Square', 'addition', 'filmmakers', 'wisely', 'opted', 'forgo', 'including', 'narration', 'rely', 'only', 'minimal', 'title', 'cards', 'inform', 'audience', 'where', 'video', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'time', 'so', 'forth.Some', 'amateur', 'videographers', 'provide', 'running', 'commentary', 'expressing', 'disbelief', 'what', 'unfolding', 'talk', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'nearby', 'record', 'people', 'including', 'strangers', 'Still', 'others', 'record', 'abject', 'silence', 'videos', 'beginning', 'documentary', 'reflect', 'initial', 'confusion', 'people', 'saw', 'first', 'tower', 'ablaze', 'People', 'speculate', 'was', 'just', 'small', 'plane', 'got', 'lost', 'Eventually', 'videographers', 'people', 'streets', 'realize', 'was', 'terrorist', 'act', 'hear', 'screams', 'panic', 'second', 'plane', 'hits', 'moments', 'are', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'dramatic', 'One', 'group', 'people', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'decide', 'hastily', 'evacuate', 'apartment', 'witness', 'frantically', 'put', 'shoes', 'pile', 'filter', 'here', 'Katie', 'Couric', 'reassuringly', 'tell', 'President', 'acting', 'neutralize', 'threat', 'CNN', 'analyze', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'buffer', 'anguish', 'pain', 'including', 'horrifying', 'realization', 'people', 'have', 'when', 'finally', 'understand', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'debris', 'falling', 'towers', 'actually', 'people', 'jumping', 'buildings', 'footage', 'raw', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'watching', '102', 'Minutes', 'be', 'draining', 'experience', 'However', 'important', 'recall', 'what', 'experienced', 'day', 'documentary', 'History', 'Chanel', 'first-rate', 'effort', 'preserve', 'events', 'forever']",102 MINUTES THAT CHANGED AMERI
