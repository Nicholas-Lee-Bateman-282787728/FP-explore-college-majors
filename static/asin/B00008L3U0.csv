Instead what I got was a mind-jumbling disappointment of a picture. The biggest error was owed to the nonsensical plot. I'll say that the slick direction of Damian Harris to be very good as he kept the vision of Bad Company to be sharp and appealing with enough style. The more time spent watching the story unfold before my eyes, the less I understand what the heck the movie was all about. Ellen Barkin sure can play a very sexy character, but it's too bad that she wasted her talent in this clunker. I actually liked the creation of the characters as the cast seemed suited to play all of them except for Michael Beach who should remain Mr. Clark's btch. All in all, Bad Company is the opposite of Frogs for Snakes and ought to be re-titled as Bad Movie.",2,Disappointing Ellen Barkin/Lawrence Fishburne Vehicle.,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,906,"['Viewed', '1/09Rate', '31/09', 'Knowing', 'advance', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'starring', 'together', 'Bad', 'Company', 'expected', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'mind-jumbling', 'disappointment', 'picture', 'biggest', 'error', 'was', 'owed', 'nonsensical', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'say', 'slick', 'direction', 'Damian', 'Harris', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'kept', 'vision', 'Bad', 'Company', 'be', 'sharp', 'appealing', 'enough', 'style', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'less', 'understand', 'what', 'heck', 'movie', 'was', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'sure', 'can', 'play', 'very', 'sexy', 'character', 'too', 'bad', 'wasted', 'talent', 'clunker', 'actually', 'liked', 'creation', 'characters', 'cast', 'seemed', 'suited', 'play', 'Michael', 'Beach', 'who', 'should', 'remain', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'btch', 'Bad', 'Company', 'opposite', 'Frogs', 'Snakes', 'ought', 'be', 're-titled', 'Bad', 'Movie']",N/A

744560,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00008L3U0,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 1]","Bad Company is a modern day film noir starring Laurence Fishburne, Ellen Barkin, and Frank Langella with David Ogden Stiers, Michael Beach, James Hong, and Gia Carides.Laurence Fishburne may be best known as Dr. Ray Langston from the hit series ""CSI"", but it was his great performance as Ike Turner in ""What's Love Got to do with it?"" (1994) that propelled him to stardom, and an Academy Award nomination, and his role as Morpheus in the ""Matrix"" trilogy that brought his wide scale attention. Fact is, Fishburne has given us many excellent performances, from his early years (Mr. Clean in ""Apocalypse Now"", Bumpy Rhodes in ""Cotton Club"").No one exudes sex like Ellen Barkin, and her work in films like ""The Big Easy"" (1987) and ""Sea of Love"" (1989) is exceptional. She briefly retired from films when she married billionaire Ron Perlman, but after their divorce, she returned. She was twice nominated for a Golden Globe (""Switch"" in 1991 and ""Before Women Had Wings"" in 1997) and won an Emmy for ""Before Women Had Wings"".Frank Langella made his initial splash in 1970 by winning 2 awards from the National Board of Review for performances in ""The 12 Chairs"" and in ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"".  He took a detour playing ""Dracula"" (1979) and then spent considerable time on the stage (where he won 2 Tonys). My personal favorite is Skeletor in ""Masters of the Universe"" (1987), but many people think his portrayal of Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008) was his best work - indeed he was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Sean Penn (""Milk""). Langella plays the spooky head of an industrial spying agency that has lies with the CIA.David Ogden Stiers is best known as the pompous Major Winchester from TV's ""MASH"" (1977-83) and from his appearance in many Woody Allen films. He does a good job as an ethically conflicted judge.James Hong makes a brief appearance as a bookmaker. Hong always does a great job and his appearance in more than 300 films is testimony to this fact. I remember him best as one of the monks from TV's ""Kung Fu"" (1972-5) and from his raucous portrayal of Lo Pan in ""Big Trouble in Little China"" (1986).Michael Beach is primarily a TV actor, having recurring roles as Doc in ""Third Watch"" (1999-2005), Al Boulet in ""ER"" (1995-7), and Col. Ellis in ""Stargate Atlantis"" (2007-9). He plays a co-worker of Fishburne.Gia Carides is the sleeper in the film. Her role reminds me of John Pankow in ""Live and Die in LA"" (1985) or Jean Reno in ""Ronin"" (1998). She plays the girlfriend of Stiers, who inadvertintently gets involved in the payoff, murder, and subsequent action. She's best known for her work playing Robin Swallows in ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (1999) and Cousin Nikki in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (2002).Director Damian Harris specializes in crime thrillers - e.g., ""Deceived"" (1991), ""Mercy"" (2000) - and doesn't shy away from films with high sexual content (""Mercy"", ""the Rachel Papers""). He manages to keep the action moving, although the film lacks the intensity we expect from most film noirs. It moves at a very predictable pace, rarely missing a beat. Personally I like some unexpected turns in my film noir.All things considered, absent the very hot sex scenes between Barkin and Fishburne, the film is pretty ordinary. It does have some potential, but it's never exploited fully, perhaps because the acting tends to be very low key. Usually in a film noir there is a central character for whom one cheers. He (sometimes she) may have taken a wrong turn, but basically he's a good person who has been set among a nest of vipers, and usually betrayed by a woman. The film lacks the person to cheer for. They are all bad (as the name of the film suggests), and while some are worse than others, there really isn't anyone to cheer for. That being said, the twist near the end of the film does offer the glimpse of what I speak, but it is too little and too late to save the film.",3,Film noir gone bad,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,3921,"['Bad', 'Company', 'modern', 'day', 'film', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'Michael', 'Beach', 'James', 'Hong', 'Gia', 'Carides.Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Ray', 'Langston', 'hit', 'series', 'CSI', 'was', 'great', 'performance', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'do', '1994', 'propelled', 'stardom', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'Morpheus', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'brought', 'wide', 'scale', 'attention', 'Fact', 'Fishburne', 'given', 'many', 'excellent', 'performances', 'early', 'years', 'Mr.', 'Clean', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Bumpy', 'Rhodes', 'Cotton', 'Club', '.No', 'one', 'sex', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'work', 'films', 'Big', 'Easy', '1987', 'Sea', 'Love', '1989', 'exceptional', 'briefly', 'retired', 'films', 'when', 'married', 'billionaire', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'divorce', 'returned', 'was', 'twice', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Switch', '1991', 'Women', 'Had', 'Wings', '1997', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Women', 'Had', 'Wings', '.Frank', 'Langella', 'made', 'initial', 'splash', '1970', 'winning', '2', 'awards', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'performances', '12', 'Chairs', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Housewife', 'took', 'detour', 'playing', 'Dracula', '1979', 'then', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'stage', 'where', 'won', '2', 'Tonys', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Skeletor', 'Masters', 'Universe', '1987', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'Frost/Nixon', '2008', 'was', 'best', 'work', 'indeed', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'lost', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Milk', 'Langella', 'spooky', 'head', 'industrial', 'spying', 'agency', 'CIA.David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'best', 'known', 'pompous', 'Major', 'Winchester', 'TV', 'MASH', '1977-83', 'appearance', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'good', 'job', 'ethically', 'conflicted', 'judge.James', 'Hong', 'brief', 'appearance', 'bookmaker', 'Hong', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'appearance', 'more', '300', 'films', 'testimony', 'fact', 'remember', 'best', 'one', 'monks', 'TV', 'Kung', 'Fu', '1972-5', 'raucous', 'portrayal', 'Lo', 'Pan', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', '1986', '.Michael', 'Beach', 'primarily', 'TV', 'actor', 'having', 'recurring', 'roles', 'Doc', 'Third', 'Watch', '1999-2005', 'Al', 'Boulet', 'ER', '1995-7', 'Col.', 'Ellis', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', '2007-9', 'co-worker', 'Fishburne.Gia', 'Carides', 'sleeper', 'film', 'role', 'John', 'Pankow', 'Live', 'Die', 'LA', '1985', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Ronin', '1998', 'girlfriend', 'Stiers', 'who', 'inadvertintently', 'involved', 'payoff', 'murder', 'subsequent', 'action', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'playing', 'Robin', 'Swallows', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Shagged', 'Me', '1999', 'Cousin', 'Nikki', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', '2002', '.Director', 'Damian', 'Harris', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'e.g.', 'Deceived', '1991', 'Mercy', '2000', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'films', 'high', 'sexual', 'content', 'Mercy', 'Rachel', 'Papers', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'film', 'intensity', 'expect', 'most', 'film', 'noirs', 'very', 'predictable', 'pace', 'rarely', 'missing', 'beat', 'Personally', 'like', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'film', 'noir.All', 'things', 'considered', 'absent', 'very', 'hot', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Barkin', 'Fishburne', 'film', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'have', 'potential', 'never', 'exploited', 'fully', 'perhaps', 'acting', 'tends', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'Usually', 'film', 'noir', 'central', 'character', 'whom', 'one', 'cheers', 'sometimes', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'wrong', 'turn', 'basically', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'been', 'set', 'nest', 'vipers', 'usually', 'betrayed', 'woman', 'film', 'person', 'cheer', 'are', 'bad', 'name', 'film', 'are', 'worse', 'others', 'really', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'cheer', 'being', 'said', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'offer', 'glimpse', 'what', 'speak', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'film']",N/A

I liked how the Operators were portrayed as behind the scenes manipulators and not the James Bond Action guys that Hollywood loves so much.  Working for money as opposed to ideals, the clients are not sympathetic souls but abhorrent heads of business who need someone to keep them from paying the price for their transgressions and will pay well for it.  The side plot of Fishburne actually still working for the Agency while acting as a ""disgraced agent"" looking for employment with the Toolshed was nice.  There are no good guys in this film.  The Closest thing to one is the girlfriend of David Ogden Stiers whose innocence makes her less hateful than the rest.  The mucic score is Tremendous and I wish I could find the soundtrack to this film.  Great jazz score that compliments the mood of the film to a ""T"".
