245987,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6301169786,andy8047,"[13, 18]","In 1982,the late Dudley Moore won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Bach in the first film. Much of his fellow cast members returned for the sequel. One who didn't was Jill Eikenberry who played Susan Johnson in the first film. Eikenberry,at the time this film was made,was a cast member of the NBC legal drama L.A. LAW. She was unable to reprise the role so Cynthia Sikes filled Eikenberry's shoes. Arthur and Linda(Liza Minnelli) are now married and Arthur lost his mega-fortunes to Susan Johnson's father(Stephen Elliott). Elliott did appear in the first film. One day,Arthur ran into Susan's father while he(the father) was hunting. Arthur is promised his money back on the condition that he divorces Linda and marries Susan. Arthur and Susan almost got married in the first film but Arthur confessed his love for Linda to Susan at the very last minute. At this point,Arthur no longer cared for the money. All he cared about was Linda. Arthur was relentlessly seeking employment and in one scene when he was on his way out,in came Mrs. Canby(Kathy Bates) who runs an employment agency. Arthur was also concentrating on giving up booze. Arthur did find employment as a sales associate at a hardware store but was fired after his first shift. The new owner of the business elected to terminate Arthur,not his/her predecessor. Again,Susan's father is angry because Arthur remained with his loyal wife. Susan,an art gallery owner,forgave Arthur for dumping her in the first film. Susan didn't seem to be upset about Arthur remaining with Linda. In the last scene,Arthur is back in the money. How I love those happy endings! The out-of-print movie soundtrack includes Kylie Minogue's cover of the 1962 Little Eva hit LOCOMOTION. In the scene where Arthur's grandmother(Geraldine Fitzgerald) meets with her personal fitness trainer,she watches him moving around while she sips her tea. Fitzgerald did appear in the first film also. LOCOMOTION also appeared on Minogue's 1988 Geffen Records album,KYLIE. The song was on hit parade in the summer of 1988,during the heatwave of the 20th century. This film was not as successful as the first,so that's why there were no further sequels.",5,An Oscar winner on the rocks!,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,2193,"['1982', 'late', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Arthur', 'Bach', 'first', 'film', 'Much', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'returned', 'sequel', 'One', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'Jill', 'Eikenberry', 'who', 'played', 'Susan', 'Johnson', 'first', 'film', 'Eikenberry', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'cast', 'member', 'NBC', 'legal', 'drama', 'L.A.', 'LAW', 'was', 'unable', 'reprise', 'role', 'so', 'Cynthia', 'Sikes', 'filled', 'Eikenberry', 'shoes', 'Arthur', 'Linda', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'Arthur', 'lost', 'mega-fortunes', 'Susan', 'Johnson', 'father', 'Stephen', 'Elliott', 'Elliott', 'did', 'appear', 'first', 'film', 'One', 'day', 'Arthur', 'ran', 'Susan', 'father', 'father', 'was', 'hunting', 'Arthur', 'promised', 'money', 'back', 'condition', 'Linda', 'marries', 'Susan', 'Arthur', 'Susan', 'almost', 'got', 'married', 'first', 'film', 'Arthur', 'confessed', 'love', 'Linda', 'Susan', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'point', 'Arthur', 'no', 'longer', 'cared', 'money', 'cared', 'about', 'was', 'Linda', 'Arthur', 'was', 'relentlessly', 'seeking', 'employment', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'was', 'way', 'out', 'came', 'Mrs.', 'Canby', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'employment', 'agency', 'Arthur', 'was', 'also', 'concentrating', 'giving', 'up', 'booze', 'Arthur', 'did', 'find', 'employment', 'sales', 'associate', 'hardware', 'store', 'was', 'fired', 'first', 'shift', 'new', 'owner', 'business', 'elected', 'terminate', 'Arthur', 'not', 'predecessor', 'Again', 'Susan', 'father', 'angry', 'Arthur', 'remained', 'loyal', 'wife', 'Susan', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'forgave', 'Arthur', 'dumping', 'first', 'film', 'Susan', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'upset', 'Arthur', 'remaining', 'Linda', 'last', 'scene', 'Arthur', 'back', 'money', 'How', 'love', 'happy', 'endings', 'out-of-print', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'cover', '1962', 'Little', 'Eva', 'hit', 'LOCOMOTION', 'scene', 'where', 'Arthur', 'grandmother', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'personal', 'fitness', 'trainer', 'moving', 'around', 'tea', 'Fitzgerald', 'did', 'appear', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'LOCOMOTION', 'also', 'appeared', 'Minogue', '1988', 'Geffen', 'Records', 'album', 'KYLIE', 'song', 'was', 'hit', 'parade', 'summer', '1988', 'heatwave', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'first', 'why', 'were', 'further', 'sequels']",Arthur 2 on the Rocks VHS

This is not inferior to the original, by any means. Put bluntly, Arthur 2: On the Rocks has never deserved a pan by any critic. The chemistry between Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli is undeniable. And it is the source of this movie's charm. Their sense of humor is equally matched. You almost get the feeling that Dudley and Liza are just being themselves, instead of acting. Everything between them seems genuine. I suppose their off-screen friendship didn't hurt when making this sequel. John Gielgud reprises his role in the form of a ghost, and those scenes with Arthur are touching. In this movie we learn that money isn't everything. Some things, like being with the one you love, are more important.And this movie has a happy ending. And what is wrong with that? Dudley, you are sorely missed.

But I'll have to disagree with them.  I thought Arthur: On The Rocks was actually very good, especially that scene on the stairs with the incredibly old apartment super and the slow-moving, electric chair. Very funny!  The comedy in Arthur 2 reminds me a lot of the classic movies from the 30s and 40s that I like so much.  If it had been made back in the 30s or 40s, I would think David Niven and Ginger Rogers would've been perfect for the lead roles and probably would've won Oscars for them.
