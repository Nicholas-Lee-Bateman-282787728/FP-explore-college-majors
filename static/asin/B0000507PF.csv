562463,AAWPNN003FRHS,B0000507PF,Amanda F.,"[8, 8]","This is the best workout video I have ever purchased or rented. This is not a &quot;learn to belly dance&quot; DVD, it is a workout. If you want to learn the dance you have to buy their instructional series. But boy! In three months, doing the workout every day, I lost 20 pounds (the most stubborn 20 pounds that did not come off with any other exercise) and I have the firmest legs I have ever had. It was easy to stick with it because it is so much fun. It is high intensity and, of course, that's the only thing that really burns the fat. It also makes you feel beautiful and graceful, and which other fitness video can say that!",5,Changed my Life!,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,633,"['best', 'workout', 'video', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased', 'rented', 'not', 'quot', 'belly', 'dance', 'quot', 'DVD', 'workout', 'want', 'learn', 'dance', 'have', 'buy', 'instructional', 'series', 'boy', 'three', 'months', 'doing', 'workout', 'day', 'lost', '20', 'pounds', 'most', 'stubborn', '20', 'pounds', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'other', 'exercise', 'have', 'firmest', 'legs', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'was', 'easy', 'stick', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'high', 'intensity', 'course', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'fat', 'also', 'feel', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'other', 'fitness', 'video', 'can', 'say']",Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down VHS
562464,A1E9SNNS24DA02,B0000507PF,"Amazon Customer ""chickenlittle25""","[12, 12]","This has to be my favorite workout dvd of all time.  Please note that this is a WORKOUT and you will not be learning a choreography or a lot of technique!  If you're looking for an instructional dvd this is not the one for you!Now, with that said, this is a great workout video for a beginner/intermediate exerciser (advanced people will probably find this too easy).  Another reviewer mentioned how the workout can be modified to your fitness level very easily and that is absolutely true.  When I started using this I weighed 220 lbs (I'm 5'3"") and for several of the segments I simply had to keep doing the ""Genie"" because I could not do the jumping parts.  If you have bad knees or are very overweight do not feel that you have to be as bouncy doing ""the genie bounce"" as what the girls are, simply stepping back and forth is moving and it's getting you somewhere!!  For those who have never tried bellydance before, there are a few ""real"" bellydance moves, some of them are more folkloric style, and some are simply aerobics moves.  That said, this tape can benefit anyone wanting to take bellydance lessons because it does work the muscles that you need to perform the dance correctly.At first I found it somewhat disconcerting to have a disembodied voice coaching me along, but the person narrating has a pleasant, soothing voice and gives pretty good cues.  She is not overly perky and you don't have to hear ""FEEL THE BURN!"" and other tacky cliched nonsense the whole way through the session.The movements are easy to learn, there is enough repetition to allow you to get into how to do things, but not so much that you're completely bored before moving on to the next move.  The twins' outfits allow you to see what they're doing with their bodies (no big bulky pants hiding legs and feet and no blending into the background), and the background gives you that bellydance sort of feel.  The camera focuses pretty much on what you need to see (bad camera angles are an issue with many bellydance style videos).I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could for 2 reasons.  The first being that during the sections where they have you doing hip lifts the girls lean waaay back to do them.  This is really not good for the back.  You will get the same benefit by standing upright and using your obliques to do the lifts (rather than simply pushing off with your foot).  The second issue with this video is there are a few parts where the splicing isn't done quite accurately and/or the voiceover doesn't quite match the video.  There are about 3 parts where it is a little ""off"" and can be a bit disconcerting at first, but once you get used to doing the routine it's easy to just ignore it.Like I said, when I started using this video I weighed 220 lbs and I have been overweight most of my life.  Well what's that mean if you don't know what I weigh now?  I am currently at 145.  I started out using this video 2-3 days a week, because I was tired all of the time, easily winded, and I found out my doctor informed me that I was in the early stages of high blood pressure which scared me.  I had always wanted to try bellydance and so I though perhaps I'd actually stick with this routine.  I enjoyed it so much that I started using it 3-5 days per week within the first month.  I couldn't do all of the moves at first, so I just stuck with doing ""the genie"" or even marching in place for anything I could not do, then I slowly started doing the more difficult moves, maybe 1 or 2 jumps here and there, a few seconds up on the toes, whatever I could do.  By the end of month 4 I could do the entire tape without modifying anything  (except for leaning back during hip lifts which I mentioned before is not good for you).  Within about 3 months I had lost 35 lbs and hadn't made any major changes to my diet.  The only thing that I changed was the portion size of my lunches on the days I worked out because I knew I'd feel icky with the bouncing around if I ate too much.  With this video I made it down to 150 without any other diet modifications than the smaller lunches.  Now I'm to the point where I'm making small changes in my diet to lose more weight as my BMI is still a bit too high.I don't know that there is anything particularly special about this video, if you use any video consistently you should lose weight and firm up.  However, this is the only video I found that I can really stick with.  I've bought  other videos to vary my routine, and some that are strictly choreography and technique, but I keep coming back to this one and still do it at least once per week.  I highly recomend this to anyone who is looking for something interesting to try, especially if bellydance appeals to you at all.  If you commit to using it you will see results, and those results can definitely encourage you to keep with it!",5,Worked for me!,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,4838,"['be', 'favorite', 'workout',

The rest is just goofy jumping, similar to ""Fat Burning"" (another workout by the same instructors). It's weird to see these girls doing such hokey-pokey... All their other videos are better. None of them are flawless, though, and the biggest issue is that they overlap each other in terms of both the material and the music.That's it in a nutshell. Below I just can't resist sharing how this video might be amusing to watch once.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The hoppy-jumpy NON-bellydance moves sometimes reach the point where they look deliberately clumsy. One of them looked almost like a bear walk.The twins are perfectly aware of how silly they look, and sometimes they can't help but burst out laughing. Yes, even that sister who usually looks like a robot - can laugh!The music during the ""Warm up"" section is incredibly funny, and I believe it was done on purpose. It sounds like a caricature (a well-done one!) of... march. I immediately envision drunk soldiers dragging their bodies and playing distuned instruments.Even the narrator gets humorous this time. If I hadn't watched but only listened, I'd have gotten an impression that the video is not about innocent dance moves, but... a very different type of activity: ""That's it! You got it! Keep it going! That's it! Are you having fun? That's it! Feel the burn! That's it! Squeeze them... right here...""Since this product is called ""Slim down"", I thought it would be aimed at overweight customers. But how come heavy people are expected to do all this jumping? I'm skinny, but even I, when attempted it, realized that a single bra is definitely not enough here... Maybe I'll try it again with 3 bras on... No, seriously, I even think that jumping is not the safest option for the overweight.It's interesting to observe how *different* identical twins can be. Especially given that they grew up in the same environment. One is a good dancer, the other is so-so. One is animated; the other is impassive...

During the first half of the video, I was disappointed, as the cardio work consisted solely of the ""genie bounce"" (basically, a side step-type move with a bit of a hop).  Isolation moves were performed inbetween each genie bounce series, which meant that my heart rate did not stay elevated.In the second half of the workout, however, the intensity picks up, as there are a greater variety of moves, including some different types of hops (although you always return to the genie bounce between exercises, which can get a bit repetitive).  There was a also a greater fun factor to this section, especially with the various hip exercises; the workout ends with a brief cool-down stretch.  Overall, I would say that this 29-minute workout probably provided about 15 minutes of solid, medium intensity cardio work.The DVD includes several bonus features, including the option to perform the workout with music only (no narrative), a picture gallery and trailers from Veena and Neena's other videos, a bonus performance by Rania(another dancer), and finally, a bonus flexibility workout by Rania.  Rania packs quite a bit into this short, 10-minute segment:  she starts with plies and standing stretches, moves on to dynamic yoga moves such as cobra to down dog and cat to cow, and performs a variety of floor stretches as well.  Although this section was quick and none of the stretches was held for a particularly long time, I enjoyed this added little flexibility boost.

Not painful or anything, but I could tell which muscles had worked out.  The workout and the accompanying warm up workout were (mostly) easy enough for someone with NO belly dance experience.  I managed to do most of the moves (minus some down time for panting and griping about being old) and nothing hurt as I did it.  I worked up a good sweat too.This was also fun!  Sure, I had to chase my hubby upstairs to keep him from laughing at me.  But once I was sure of my privacy, I had fun.

562474,A24K6CTE0YQPFL,B0000507PF,Cydni Perkins,"[1, 1]","I've had this DVD for six years now, and although I have way too many workout DVDs, I keep coming back to this one.  It's one of the more difficult workouts in my collection, so I do it when I'd like a bit of a challenge.  It includes a couple of challenging moves also, like layering hip moves onto a bouncing shimmy.  That was my first introduction to layering, and it takes practice, but I love to do it.  Also, the cool-down includes a challenging step that I sometimes have to stop and watch a couple of times to remember how to do.  The challenges keep it interesting.  I like to do the workout barefoot, as the twins demonstrate in the video, but the routine does involve some jumping and hopping moves, so some people might want to wear shock-absorbing shoes.  I don't really have a problem with it, and I find I feel sexier and better able to perform the moves without shoes.Part of what makes this a workout, as opposed to a dance tutorial, is that Veena and Neena are not trying to teach us a dance routine in this one.  It just mainly takes fun bellydance moves and drills them, so you get a good workout.  There is no segment at the end where you're supposed to ""perform"" the moves you just learned.  It's just a workout, and I always get a good sweat going, and I also sometimes have sore calf muscles from the bouncing shimmy.The voiceover kind of annoyed me.  This is something that's commonly done in bellydance DVDs, and I'm not sure why, since many of the dancers stress the importance of being able to move your abs without affecting your breathing, and breathing without moving your abs.  So why can't bellydance instructors dance and talk at the same time?  Most fitness instructors in other genres of workout DVDs do their own voice instruction while they demonstrate the workout.  I often feel that the energy in this workout would be better if the twins would just talk instead of wearing their beautiful, Barbie-like smiles and dancing.  On the other hand, I can get some good exercise with this DVD as is.  This is just a peeve of mine.Overall, a solid effort.",4,"Fun, And A Good Workout",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2087,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'six', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'one', 'one', 'more', 'difficult', 'workouts', 'collection', 'do', 'when', ""'d"", 'like', 'bit', 'challenge', 'couple', 'challenging', 'moves', 'also', 'layering', 'hip', 'moves', 'bouncing', 'shimmy', 'was', 'first', 'introduction', 'layering', 'practice', 'love', 'do', 'Also', 'cool-down', 'challenging', 'step', 'sometimes', 'have', 'stop', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'remember', 'how', 'do', 'challenges', 'keep', 'interesting', 'like', 'do', 'workout', 'barefoot', 'twins', 'demonstrate', 'video', 'routine', 'involve', 'jumping', 'hopping', 'moves', 'so', 'people', 'might', 'want', 'wear', 'shock-absorbing', 'shoes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'find', 'feel', 'sexier', 'better', 'able', 'perform', 'moves', 'shoes.Part', 'what', 'workout', 'opposed', 'dance', 'tutorial', 'Veena', 'Neena', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'teach', 'dance', 'routine', 'one', 'just', 'mainly', 'fun', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'so', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'segment', 'end', 'where', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'perform', 'moves', 'just', 'learned', 'just', 'workout', 'always', 'get', 'good', 'sweat', 'going', 'also', 'sometimes', 'have', 'sore', 'calf', 'muscles', 'bouncing', 'shimmy.The', 'voiceover', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'something', 'commonly', 'done', 'bellydance', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'many', 'dancers', 'stress', 'importance', 'being', 'able', 'move', 'abs', 'affecting', 'breathing', 'breathing', 'moving', 'abs', 'So', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bellydance', 'instructors', 'dance', 'talk', 'same', 'time', 'Most', 'fitness', 'instructors', 'other', 'genres', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'do', 'own', 'voice', 'instruction', 'demonstrate', 'workout', 'often', 'feel', 'energy', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'twins', 'would', 'just', 'talk', 'instead', 'wearing', 'beautiful', 'Barbie-like', 'smiles', 'dancing', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'just', 'peeve', 'mine.Overall', 'solid', 'effort']",Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down VHS

As always, they're beautiful and graceful, the set is pretty, the voiceover is clear and easy to follow. It's an excellent workout, combining both aerobic exercise (try picking up those knees a bit higher and really moving that chest up during the Genie Bounces, if you don't think this is aerobic enough!) and isometric moves to tone and tighten. I love their teaching style; they execute a move (say, chest lifts) a few times, then it's back to Genie Bounces and then on to another move. If you don't &quot;get&quot; chest lifts, no big deal; you missed maybe a minute of your workout. If you are really lost (it took me a loooong time to figure out how to travel in a circle) you can always go back to Genie Bounces early.I have found their videos highly effective for weight loss. By following the diet/lifestyle changes from the book &quot;The Pathway&quot; (by Laurel Mellin) and working out every day with Veena &amp; Neena, I've lost almost 10 pounds and over 7&quot; overall since April 1st! I look *forward* to getting up early (before my three children) to dance. I alternate between their Abs-Arms and Buns-Hips-Thighs (M-W-F) and Basic Moves or Sensual Dance and Slim Down or Fat Burning (Su-T-Th-Sa).As for this tape being dangerous...ha. I have bad knees (used to be a runner) and this workout is a breeze, even for me. I can't do Kili's Hula for Weight loss video (which is a pity, because it's a terrific, fun workout!), but this one I *can* do, no problem. The Fat Burning video, yes, I need to be careful. I simply can't do that many Choo Choos. But THIS video...no problem.Oh, yeah, one more thing...according to my husband, I'm also learning to bellydance, along with losing weight and toning up.  ;-)!

562476,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0000507PF,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","I started looking at belly dancing as a viable exercise alternative after watching the amazing Hafsia Herzi dance for what seemed forever in the final minutes of the film ""The Secret of the Grain (La Graine et le Mulet) (Subtitled in English) (Region 1 DVD, USA/Canada Edition).""  The energy and passion that she exerted during this session sold me; with each sustained shimmy I felt myself drawn to this mysterious expression of sultry womanhood.  The fact that Hafsia (I do not know whether or not this Cesar Award winning actress actually performed the dance herself or had a body double) perspired profusely convinced me that belly dancing was not for the meek in spirit; all those exotic gyrations and erotically expressive undulations required fit muscles that worked within a tight frame and were controlled by a disciplined brain.  I could not wait to begin.I purchasedBellydance Fitness for Beginners - Basic Moves & Fat Burningby the Belly Dancing Twins, Veena & Neena.  It wasn't tough, but it wasn't easy either.  The twins know their stuff--the routine required multiple viewings and practice sessions to become familiar enough with what was coming next to feel comfortable enough to just let go and enjoy the process.  After working out at least five times with this DVD, I decided that Veena and Neena were worthwhile instructors and thereby purchased their Slim Down workout.Now I am not a dancer by any means.  My workout routine consists of running on the levee for about 60 to 90 minutes.  I break this up with some strength training using the  method of lifting heavier weights with less repetition, Tae Bo when the weather prevents me from going outdoors and Pilates to concentrate on moving from my core.  The exuberant flexible movements of belly dance do not exactly emulate my usual workout routine; so the idea of incorporating smaller quicker moves within a larger framework alone for me was a challenge.The Slim Down DVD does not waste time on Basic Moves.  If you are an Uber beginner you must acquaint yourself with the terminology and the correlated moves by either purchasing a fundamental DVD (Amira's Belly Dance 101 Dvd, a 5-Star Instructional Video of Belly Dancing Basics for Beginners) or taking a beginner's class.  Of course, if you are a dancer, you need not worry.  This DVD probably will not be challenging enough to give you the workout you require.In fact, it did not give me the workout I desire.  The twins start off with about a five minute warm-up (neck rolls, arm and leg stretches) and introduce what they call the genie bounce (side to side motion with alternating arms) which they activate to a jump once the music accelerates and the 20 minute cardio portion of the session is in full swing.  The genie bounce is used as a transition move throughout the session as the voice over (neither Veena nor Neena speak during the workout; however they do perpetually smile) announces what is to come about 5 seconds before the twins actually execute on the screen.  More belly dancing moves--shoulder and hip shimmies, hip drops and lifts--are used in Slim Down than in the Fat Burning DVD.  Fat Burning's cardio relies mainly on rocking back and forth, skipping and hopping but not for any great length of time.  In fact one of the most difficult moves for me to complete in the Slim Down is the shoulder shimmy while I move up and down.  It was tough to incorporate the small fast movement while making a larger overall movement. No wonder belly dancing is an art.In the same respect, some of the hopping and twisting motions the twins employ may be too intense for someone who either has hip or knee problems or has just re-entered the exercising world from a coach-potato coma.  However if you are accustomed to high-impact running or kickboxing, don't expect the same type of rush that larger moves will give you in terms of fitness when performing Slim Down.  Despite the rocking horse motions, skipping and hopping, the low intensity nature of the belly dancing itself means that a mere 20 minutes isn't going to give you the cardio benefit that you crave.  Therefore, I would recommend this presentation as an alternative to be used on days where an intense workout is not required.The twins finish up with a five-minute cool down for an overall workout of thirty minutes.  Included on the DVD is a Flexibility Training Workout which is very basic--I used this to complete my cool-down.  However, I would not recommend this session at all.Bottom Line:  Although Veena and Neena rely on a voice over to instruct participants of their Slim Down Belly Dancing Workout, they both are attractively supple and slim with lovely attainable bodies.  Personally, I liked their Fat Burning workout better than this one, but only because I felt it gave me more intense cardio due to the high impact jumping. Slim Down does incorporated more Belly dancing moves--however, these are not really explained--the DVD contains no fundamental moves section. Belly dancing is an art that encourages expression through the rounded feminine form and makes a good alternative workout option that will round out your exercise possibilities. The music and costumes contribute to the overall exotic feeling that belly dance promotes.  Do wear a coin scarf around your hips to add weight--the sound of the coins swaying will put you in a sensual mood.  Otherwise don't expect the full cardio benefit of running or kickboxing but look at this as a fun introduction to something truly beautiful and exhilarting.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Fun

She has to cycle through all the tapes but she really likes this one.I've seen her practice with it and she seems to follow it pretty well. She has been doing the other videos from Neena and Veena for about 1.5 years now.She has most of the basics down and this adds to it. Again I don't see any weight loss from this but some toning.Also this one crashes on the PC a lot but not on the regular DVD player.She gets a good sweat up doing this which is good and except for the format where you have to rewind many times to see what you missed. It's a decent video.The belly dance style used is my wifes favorite as it combines so many styles.",4,My wife really likes this one,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,759,"['was', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'before', 'wife', 'teh', 'more', 'hopping', 'aspect', 'more', 'motion', 'cycle', 'tapes', 'really', 'one.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'practice', 'follow', 'pretty', 'well', 'been', 'doing', 'other', 'videos', 'Neena', 'Veena', 'about', '1.5', 'years', 'now.She', 'most', 'basics', 'down', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'weight', 'loss', 'toning.Also', 'one', 'crashes', 'PC', 'lot', 'not', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player.She', 'good', 'sweat', 'up', 'doing', 'good', 'format', 'where', 'have', 'rewind', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'what', 'missed', 'decent', 'video.The', 'belly', 'dance', 'style', 'used', 'wifes', 'favorite', 'so', 'many', 'styles']",Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down VHS
