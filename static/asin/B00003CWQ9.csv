519224,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00003CWQ9,Adam Craig,"[0, 0]","Norm MacDonald plays Willard Fillmore, the lifelong manservant of Virginia Crock.  Miss Crock owns a baking company, is extremely rich, and mistreats Willard in almost every way possible.  Willard is willing to put up with it until he finds out Miss Crock is planning on firing him, and he decides to get together with his buddy, Rusty P. Hayes, played by Dave Chappelle, and kidnap her dog, Muffin.  Well, the kidnapping goes awry and Willard ends up ""kidnapping himself.""  From that point, in their quest to get the 5 million dollar ransom, Willard and Rusty meet up with Grover Cleaver, a worker a the local morgue, played by Danny DeVito in a disgusting role.Screwed has quite a few extremely funny moments.  Namely the fake kidnapping videotape that Willard and Rusty make at the local store.  I think that Norm MacDonald is one of, if not THE, worst actors I have ever seen.  That is why I love his movies.  Dirty Work is one of my all-time favorites.  Unfortunately, Screwed does not meet Dirty Work in the humor category.  That is probably because the film is more dependent on the whole kidnapping story, whereas Dirty Work was pretty much just a vehicle for Norm to run with his role however he wanted to.  I would recommend this movie for Norm fans, and also fans of Dave Chappelle.  His role is limited, but he is still hilarious when on screen.",3,"Some funny  moments, but disappointing",1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,1357,"['Norm', 'MacDonald', 'Willard', 'Fillmore', 'lifelong', 'manservant', 'Virginia', 'Crock', 'Miss', 'Crock', 'baking', 'company', 'extremely', 'rich', 'mistreats', 'Willard', 'almost', 'way', 'possible', 'Willard', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'out', 'Miss', 'Crock', 'planning', 'firing', 'get', 'together', 'buddy', 'Rusty', 'P.', 'Hayes', 'played', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'kidnap', 'dog', 'Muffin', 'Well', 'kidnapping', 'awry', 'Willard', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'point', 'quest', 'get', '5', 'million', 'dollar', 'ransom', 'Willard', 'Rusty', 'meet', 'up', 'Grover', 'Cleaver', 'worker', 'local', 'morgue', 'played', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'disgusting', 'role.Screwed', 'quite', 'few', 'extremely', 'funny', 'moments', 'Namely', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'videotape', 'Willard', 'Rusty', 'make', 'local', 'store', 'think', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'worst', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'why', 'love', 'movies', 'Dirty', 'Work', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Unfortunately', 'Screwed', 'not', 'meet', 'Dirty', 'Work', 'humor', 'category', 'probably', 'film', 'more', 'dependent', 'whole', 'kidnapping', 'story', 'whereas', 'Dirty', 'Work', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'vehicle', 'Norm', 'run', 'role', 'however', 'wanted', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Norm', 'fans', 'also', 'fans', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'role', 'limited', 'still', 'hilarious', 'when', 'screen']",Screwed

First off all we have a chauffer, Willard Filmore (Norm Mcdonald) who works his butt off for his tyranical boss, a wealthy old woman Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch), and gets very little out of doing this and gets no respect. But When Willard finally goes nuts when all she gives him for christmas is a pie. A PIE???? she is rich, she owns a pie company, and all she gives him is a pie after all he has done for her. He does everything for her. I mean literally, he does EVERYTHING for her. And for going nuts, she decides she is going to fire him. After, Willard goes to his friend, Rusty (Dave Chappelle) and they decide to get back at Miss Crock by kidnapping or should I say dognapping her dog. Things were going okay except the dog was barking. Will puts hand on the dogs mouth but the dog starts biting his hand and getting blood all over the walls. They managed to get the dog off the hand and write a ransom note for $1 million. But things weren't going as well as they seemed. Behind their backs, the dog escapes and returns home seeming like the whole thing never happened. When Miss sees the damage, all she was shocked about at first was that her paining got messed up because of the blood, not worrying about the blood on the wall or the damage. Now that is a screwed up scene. Anyway, when the boys see the morning paper it SAYS THAT WILLARD IS KIDNAPPED! Everbody thought the note was meant for willard. And the whole story gets over town quikly. Now Willard cannot show his face in public. They are totally screwed. At first they trie to use this buy raising the ransom, sending a video of willard being ""locked up"", causing the public to have Miss Crocks company to go down and forcing her to pay. But at the sametime, detective (Dan Benzali) is getting close to figue out this case. So they decide to go to a morgue worker (Danny Devito)to make people think Willard is dead. Now doesn't this movie sound screwed up???Anyway, there are funny scenes in this movie. There was a scene where willard was trying to clean windows but he fell off the ladder and then the ladder falls on him! And there are also times where Rusty keeps hitting people with desklamps because he is scared.Mcdonald and Chappelle made a good duo in this movie. They will make you laugh because of the stuff they do and say.

519231,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00003CWQ9,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 4]","The first time I saw Screwed (2000), I wasn't very appreciative of the film, but after viewing it for a second time, I think it's growing on me, as I liked it a little better, although I doubt if I were to watch it again, I would like it even more, as it's not really a film that merits viewing more than I already have....  The movie was somewhat funny, but I'd hardly recommend it above other comedies, that is, unless you've seen them all and you're just looking to rent for the sake of renting something.  The film, written and directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, better known for their biography pictures (Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Man on the Moon), stars a solid cast in SNL veteran Norm Macdonald (Dirty Work), David Chappelle (Half Baked), prominent stage actress Elaine Stritch (Krippendorf's Tribe), and Danny DeVito (L.A.Confidential).The film features Norm Macdonald as a hapless manservant named Willard Fillmore, who works for a well-to-do, nasty, miserly, old biddy named Mrs. Crock (Stritch), owner of a popular baked goods company.  I use the term `manservant' loosely, as Willard is more of a slave, working for peanuts, forced to endure the abusive antics of his employer, until he finally can stand it anymore, and develops a simple revenge plan with his best friend, Rusty P. Hayes (Chappelle), owner of Rusty's Juicy Chicken Hole, to kidnap Mrs. Crock's beloved Pomeranian Muffin, and hold it for ransom.  Well, as we all know, even the simplest of plans often get tripped up with complications, and here is no different.  Somehow the authorities presume it was Willard who was kidnapped, as Muffin managed to escape and return home before missed, forcing Willard and Rusty to change their plans to now go along with the idea that Willard really was kidnapped, subsequently asking for more money from Mrs. Crock (who, incidentally, isn't inclined to pay, not for Willard, at least).  From here the plans continually get more befuddled, complications get more, well, complicated, as the two kidnappers get deeper and deeper in over their heads, trying to stay one step ahead of the authorities.The film, meant to be a homage to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's (according to the production notes), has its' moments, but lacks the charm of the movies its' trying to emulate.  The cast is solid, featuring Macdonald, who I've always though a bit under-rated and suffers from not only having a type of humor with limited appeal (I really liked his previous film Dirty Work, which is much funnier than this, but did very poorly at the box office), but also a lack of suitable roles, often stuck playing secondary characters in Adam Sandler features.  I think the same goes for Chappelle, whose show on Comedy Central is extremely funny, but is often relegated to lesser roles in features, unable to really show off his true comedic talents.  I think both of these actors did well with what they had, but were perhaps miscast in their roles.  Stritch does a fine job, but it was kind of odd seeing her take a role that seemed beneath her, especially given her past theatrical stage experience.  I guess one can say she's not one of these haughty actresses who regards this type of work negatively, or else she really needed the money (funny how one's artistic integrity is sometimes inversely proportion to one's economic needs...) Danny DeVito is pretty funny as Grover Cleaver, an odd, simplistic character who works in a morgue and is hired by the boys to provide a corpse (watch the film to find out why).  The scene where Grover is discussing various items he's found inside cadavers and his speculations as to their various points of entry, is pretty funny, especially the reaction of Rusty as Grover starts handling a particular musical instrument (you can catch this scene on the trailer).  I think the biggest problem with this film is what it was trying to be...as I said before, the production notes present it as a homage to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, but people who enjoy those probably won't enjoy this as it often incorporates the crude humor of an Adam Sandler movie (but not enough to warrant those who enjoy that type of humor to run out and see this film) and people who like Adam Sandler films probably won't appreciate (or understand, or care about) the subtle homage to those films made so long ago.  I got the feeling they were trying (and failed to some degree) accommodate a segment of the movie-going public (that large group who made Sandler so rich and famous) with the vulgar material, perhaps compromising their initial artist vision of a truly faithful modernization honoring of those films from the past.  There are some very funny moments sprinkled throughout the film's 82-minute run-time (it certainly helped that the movie wasn't dragged out much longer), but not nearly enough to keep many viewers satisfied (Dirty Work differed in this aspect most likely because it was partly written by Macdonald).  Ultimately, the film is good for a few laughs, but suffers from, in my opinion, losing focus on the fundamental scope of the project.The wide screen (1:85:1) picture on this DVD is excellent, as is the audio.  Special features include a theatrical trailer for the film along with one for Man on the Moon, production notes, biographies and selected filmographies of the main cast and crew, and a Universal weblink (oh boy).  Maybe once the writers/directors Alexander and Karaszewski got this out of their system, they can now go back to doing what they do best, with their popular biopics.  There's certainly nothing wrong with trying new things and broadening your horizons, but there's also something to be said for sticking with what you know.Cookieman108",3,"""Sweet Jesus!

Willard Fillmore is a butler badly mistreated by his boss, Miss Virginia Crock, the owner of a huge pastry business.  Willard and his friend Rusty decide to get back at her by kidnapping her dog and getting a huge ransom out of it.  Then, the kidnapping goes wrong and everyone thinks Willard is the one who was kidnapped.  From here on in, Willard and Rusty must figure a way to get out of the mess without screwing themselves over.  Sure, some of the humor has been done before, but it is still very funny.  There are plenty of laughs throughout.  Screwed will keep you interested because from one scene to the next you're never sure what is going to happen next.Norm Macdonald is very funny as Willard Fillmore, the mistreated butler who decides to get back at Miss Crock.  There is just something funny about the pitch of Macdonald's voice when he screams.  Dave Chappelle is equally funny as Rusty, Willard's friend and partner in crime.  The two of them together are great.  Danny DeVito is also good as morgue worker Grover Cleaver, who gets caught up in the whole mess.
