But Over Ireland while the pictures are stunning and the narative is good, The speed in which the scenery flashes by is too quick. this results in frequent backtracking and pausing just to get a good view of the magnificient sights. If only there was a way to slow the movie down in many places this would have been really great.",3,A little dissapointing,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,425,"['also', 'own', 'three', 'America', 'series', 'Movies', 'BD', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'one', 'Ireland', 'pictures', 'are', 'stunning', 'narative', 'good', 'speed', 'scenery', 'flashes', 'too', 'quick', 'results', 'frequent', 'backtracking', 'pausing', 'just', 'get', 'good', 'view', 'magnificient', 'sights', 'only', 'was', 'way', 'slow', 'movie', 'down', 'many', 'places', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great']",Over Ireland

I have always wanted to go to Ireland and have an Irish heritage.  My brother was able to go a few years ago.  He just passed away three days after Christmas.  He LOVED Ireland so much; was into history and was planning on going back some day for another visit.  He had seen &#34;Over Ireland&#34; and thought it was awesome, too.  I particulary LOVE the song at the end &#34;I Will&#34;.  It is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  I wish there was a cd available with that song and others on it by the same artist.  But I believe that song was an original song written for this DVD.  I can't find any CD's by that artist.  Anyway, I purchased this DVD in order to feel closer to my late brother.

The aerial photography was good.....that which you could see without a blur.  I sense there was a need to cram too much into too short a time frame.I have been to Ireland several times and actually flew over parts in a private plane.  I had a much better view than what this video presented as the pilot was so high, many things were indistinguishable.  Ergo, many of the ruins and buildings were not captured in their true size.  Add to this, there was little or no dialogue about many of the sights.I don't like to be critical of people's endeavors, but neither do I like spending money on something I did not enjoy.  I ended up trying the video a 2nd time in bed.
