1024112,AFUV4USF63LX8,B000J10KKA,Jerrye,"[0, 1]","I Bought Seasons 1, 2 & 3. 1 & 2 were what I expected. But Season 3 had the episodes from season 4 not season 3. I recently bought season 4 and it verified that the episodes in the season 3 dvd set were the same as Season 4. It is to late to return Season 3 and get my money back so I am a bit upset about this. Also there was a site that was selling all the episodes as 1 purchase and I tried to order this set but found out it was being sent for China and by bank would not allow the purchase so now I am back to trying to buy each season 1 at a time, but it is alot more expenisive this way. But Baywatch was one of my favorite shows and would like all of the seasons if I can find them. Good luck to all of you.

Only flaw is that some of the best cast comes in later during the series.  Erin Gray, for example, doesn't appear until season 8.  Remember Erin Gray?  Buck Rogers and the 25th Century?  (Though I cannot see her until season 8 is released, I do get to see her at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Maryland this September.)
