1394048,A356QJWDT3P62R,B004AWPDZQ,Keoma,"[1, 1]",I just watched this movie on Amazon Prime and it was much better than I expected. The story takes place in Alabama and the lead character is an 11 year old boy named Moon who is taken into the woods by his father to live off the wilderness because his father is extremely anti-government but their lonely hermit like lifestyle is soon interrupted by the intrusion of machinery that are creating a road for a hunting lodge. It isn't too long before his father has an accident where his leg is broken and the father refusing to leave for help dies and the boy is then left to take care of himself. Soon he is caught and taken to a boys home where he makes friends and one night they manage an escape from the boys home to return to the wilderness and he begins to teach his buddies how to survive in the woods. John Goodman has a guest appearance as the kindly owner of the hunting lodge and Clint Howard (Ron Howard's brother) has a comic appearance as an inept local law enforcement who has it in for  Moon. I recommend this as a family oriented movie even though it contains some mild language I found it a great way to spend an hour and 39 minutes as it has humor and drama.
