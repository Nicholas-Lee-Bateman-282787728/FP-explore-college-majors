Not that I don't believe in the Second Coming, but there is nothing triumphant or glorious about this short film and I saw no clouds of glory to which I'd desire to be caught up. There are better and much more compelling tales on the subject to be found elsewhere. Search them out.

684004,A39KP1G21J4HUG,B00005UF7J,Kiltmaker,"[25, 31]","Most of the reviewers have totally missed the point.  If you read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, or watched the &quot;Tribulation&quot; series movies, you saw that the believers leave a video to tell those left behind where they have gone, what is going to happen in the tribulation, and how to receive Christ as their Savior.  This DVD is similar to those videos.  So, it is not really a movie in the traditional sense, it is a movie for believers to purchase to leave as a message.  It doesn't really have a plot line, a hero and heroine going through trials and tribulations, etc.  However, if you are a Christian you should ask yourself, if the rapture happens, would I want my loved ones to know what happened to me, how to join me, and what to make of the Anti Christ?

Well I didn't miss the point.The point of this movie is not to be a fictional movie but some sort of instruction video for those who are left behind after the rapture that some Christians believe is coming.The fictional elements of the movie are interrupted by scenes where Pastor John Hagee declares that this, in fact, will happen, becaus the bible tells us it will, and when it does, you better be a Christian and be saved, and don't trust the evil European politician that will become some kind of world president and say he's the Messiah, because he's really the Anti-Christ.I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie, and certainly not to spend their money on it. If you think you need an instruction video about what to do when the end is near and that the televangelists who made this movie needs more money than they already have - go ahead and buy it, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1,Please...,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,965,"['reviewer', 'said', 'people', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'point.The', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'fictional', 'movie', 'sort', 'instruction', 'video', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'rapture', 'Christians', 'believe', 'coming.The', 'fictional', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'interrupted', 'scenes', 'where', 'Pastor', 'John', 'Hagee', 'fact', 'will', 'happen', 'becaus', 'bible', 'tells', 'will', 'when', 'better', 'be', 'Christian', 'be', 'saved', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'evil', 'European', 'politician', 'will', 'become', 'kind', 'world', 'president', 'say', 'Messiah', 'really', 'Anti-Christ.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'see', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'think', 'need', 'instruction', 'video', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'end', 'near', 'televangelists', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'money', 'already', 'have', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn']",N/A
684007,A2LNK434OR0WL2,B00005UF7J,Sonny L,"[10, 14]","I have watched all of Cloud Ten's end time movies. While none of them were stellar, this one was abysmal. It seemed like it was John Hagee's effort to showcase himself, more than anything else, by calling it a documentary. It was a bottom dweller when it came to production values, using recycled clips from Apocolypse more than new footage. It completely lacked both plot and character development. If it was to be a documentary, then it should have had some scripture to it. If Hagee's preaching is as lean on scripture as this film is, then I think I will skip ever watching that the same as I advise skipping this waste-of-time. There are plenty of halfway decent films out there for sharing with friends about the end times, but this one is totally worthless.",1,"Poorly made, recycled scene, supposed documentary",1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,764,"['have', 'watched', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'end', 'time', 'movies', 'none', 'were', 'stellar', 'one', 'was', 'abysmal', 'seemed', 'was', 'John', 'Hagee', 'effort', 'showcase', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'calling', 'documentary', 'was', 'bottom', 'dweller', 'when', 'came', 'production', 'values', 'using', 'recycled', 'clips', 'Apocolypse', 'more', 'new', 'footage', 'completely', 'lacked', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'be', 'documentary', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'scripture', 'Hagee', 'preaching', 'lean', 'scripture', 'film', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'skip', 'ever', 'watching', 'same', 'advise', 'skipping', 'waste-of-time', 'are', 'plenty', 'halfway', 'decent', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'sharing', 'friends', 'end', 'times', 'one', 'totally', 'worthless']",N/A
684008,A90M5QB6CNSSN,B00005UF7J,"Sure Thing ""surething88""","[2, 2]","This is a fully intact NOVA video; one that is presented exactly as it was broadcast.  It includes the introductory sequence preceding the series title and the (mercifully brief) presentation of the underwriters.  As far as I can tell anyway, not one bit of the original program is missing as is often the case with other prerecorded NOVA videos.  The picture quality for a VHS tape is excellent as is the sound.  This is a good candidate for re-release on DVD with supplemental features.As far as the program itself, it is enjoyable for anyone interested in aviation, geology, meteorology, forensic medicine, or a good mystery.  If you like all, you'll love this program.  The haunting piano accompaniment along with the marvelously smooth narrating voice of actor David Ogden Stiers keep you glued to the screen as you are presented with the story of how, in 1947 in South America, a commercial airliner on what should have been a routine flight suddenly disappeared without a trace.  For over 50 years, no one knew what could have happened to the aircraft and its passengers and crew, though there were those who wanted to believe it was an alien abduction since there seemed to be no other explanation.  Then in 1998, some mountain climbers stumbled onto pieces of wreckage and body parts high in the Andes mountains.  The subsequent investigation and survey of the crash site slowly revealed what really happened based on the evidence found and the scientific knowledge accumulated since the time of the accident.  Only the true meaning of the last radio transmission from the aircraft remains an unsolved mystery.  But as NOVA so successfully demonstrates so often, finding the truth in a rational manner is so much more fascinating than any speculation involving extraterrestrial or other supernatural phenomenon.",5,Can't Stop Watching This One!,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1820,"['fully', 'intact', 'NOVA', 'video', 'one', 'presented', 'exactly', 'was', 'broadcast', 'introductory', 'sequence', 'preceding', 'series', 'title', 'mercifully', 'brief', 'presentation', 'underwriters', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'anyway', 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'original', 'program', 'missing', 'often', 'case', 'other', 'prerecorded', 'NOVA', 'videos', 'picture', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tape', 'excellent', 'sound', 'good', 'candidate', 're-release', 'DVD', 'supplemental', 'features.As', 'far', 'program', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'interested', 'aviation', 'geology', 'meteorology', 'forensic', 'medicine', 'good', 'mystery', 'like', ""'ll"", 'love', 'program', 'haunting', 'piano', 'accompaniment', 'marvelously', 'smooth', 'narrating', 'voice', 'actor', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'keep', 'glued', 'screen', 'are', 'presented', 'story', 'how', '1947', 'South', 'America', 'commercial', 'airliner', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'routine', 'flight', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'trace', '50', 'years', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'aircraft', 'passengers', 'crew', 'were', 'who', 'wanted', 'believe', 'was', 'alien', 'abduction', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'other', 'explanation', 'Then', '1998', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'stumbled', 'pieces', 'wreckage', 'body', 'parts', 'high', 'Andes', 'mountains', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'survey', 'crash', 'site', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'based', 'evidence', 'found', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'accumulated', 'time', 'accident', 'Only', 'true', 'meaning', 'last', 'radio', 'transmission', 'aircraft', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'NOVA', 'successfully', 'so', 'often', 'finding', 'truth', 'rational', 'manner', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'fascinating', 'speculation', 'involving', 'extraterrestrial', 'other', 'supernatural', 'phenomenon']",N/A
