It has a slow start and from there goes into a past lover being falsely accused of rape. Yes, like the Demi Moor movie but not impressive at all. I give it three stars because it's just okay and by a whim Kumar is found not guilty. You can see or pass on this one.",3,Just okay!,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,354,"['Now', 'being', 'fan', 'main', 'Hindi', 'stars', 'movie', 'borderline', 'sucks', 'Really', 'slow', 'start', 'there', 'past', 'lover', 'being', 'falsely', 'accused', 'rape', 'Yes', 'Demi', 'Moor', 'movie', 'not', 'impressive', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'just', 'okay', 'whim', 'Kumar', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'can', 'see', 'pass', 'one']",N/A

Without giving the whole plot away, she sets her sights on Akshay Kumar who is married to legally-trained Kareena Kapoor. He refuses her advances and she accuses him of attempted rape and he is asked to resign his job. There is then a court case (which the wife takes over) where he tries to clear his name. The social issue also looked at here is the sexual harassment issue (Priyanka is Akshay's boss). This is usually a woman accusing a man and the tables are turned to widen the debate.This movie was high quality acting by these 3 actors as well as their supports.Priyanka is chillingly creepy as the beautiful manipulator- showing that her acting skills may not have been used to best advantage previously. Akshay beautifully pitches his role in a slightly understated way and also did an impressive and very watchable job.While Kareena's role is slightly more minor she is strong and does well with her part too.The music is a little ho-hum but fine. The cinematography and scripting are good. The sub-titles slipped here and there - most notable at a few points where the actors broke into English and the sub-title translated this into English of the opposite meaning!This isn't a violent movie. It has some romance and some sexual edginess in a few scenes but this is not the main feature and is very much appropriate to the plot. The court case doesn't go on for too long, is well-scripted and is sharply played out by the barristers.I thought this was a quietly solid and impressive little movie. It tends to score above average in reviews elsewhere on the Net.

You really feel the tension and Akshay gives a fantastic performance as the falsely accused husband.  I totally agree with the other reviewers . This was by far the better of the two movies . Much better than our American version.  Loved the beginning of this film and how it let's you fall in love with Akshay and Kareena. They do this  in a fun and playful manner that  makes sure that we have an emotional investment in the film from the outset. The plot pieces fall together seamlessly and  in no way do you ever feel it is overlong or contrived . Really neat dance scenes interwoven into the parties and vacations more natural seeming. The others say it better than I can . Watch and enjoy.
