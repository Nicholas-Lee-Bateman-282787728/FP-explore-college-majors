He explains his story by putting on a play that involves the people listening. It is the story of Alonso Quijana who in a fever becomes a great knight (Don Quixote de la Mancha); he seeks adventure and the ""impossible dream.""It is the nature of plays that when preformed one tries to get the best stage actors.

B Collins Jr.,"[1, 2]","Peter O'Toole does an exceptional job playing Miguel de Cervantes who in turn plays the crazy Don Quixote de Lan Mancha in the version of a Broadway play brought to the screen. The DVD still has the feel of a Broadway musical in terms of sets and the movement of the actors across the stage.Sophia Loren is exceptionally beautiful in this film though like O'Toole, her singing abilities are limited. James Coco does a respectable job as the realist Squire, Sancho Panza.The continued assualts upon Sophia Loren by the gangs of criminals and thieves eventually got on my nerves. Whereas it created situations for highly choreographed musical numbers where Loren fights off attempted assailants, the assault of a woman by gang rapists is a difficult theme to choreography. I wish the assults were less emphasized since the viewer realizes this peasant woman survives as an waitress at a broken down Inn and services the male guests at night to survive.The bleak Spanish countryside is realistically portrayed in the few non-set vistas in the film. Much of the film takes place in a set that is derived from the approach used in the stage production. The scrappy costumes also were well done.The theme and story line however are the most compelling aspect of the film as we see a parable of triumph against unbeatable odds.",4,Triumph over unbeatable odds.,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,1320,"['Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'exceptional', 'job', 'playing', 'Miguel', 'de', 'Cervantes', 'who', 'turn', 'crazy', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Lan', 'Mancha', 'version', 'Broadway', 'play', 'brought', 'screen', 'DVD', 'still', 'feel', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'terms', 'sets', 'movement', 'actors', 'stage.Sophia', 'Loren', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'film', 'like', ""O'Toole"", 'singing', 'abilities', 'are', 'limited', 'James', 'Coco', 'respectable', 'job', 'realist', 'Squire', 'Sancho', 'Panza.The', 'continued', 'assualts', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'gangs', 'criminals', 'thieves', 'eventually', 'got', 'nerves', 'created', 'situations', 'highly', 'choreographed', 'musical', 'numbers', 'where', 'Loren', 'off', 'attempted', 'assailants', 'assault', 'woman', 'gang', 'rapists', 'difficult', 'theme', 'choreography', 'wish', 'assults', 'were', 'less', 'emphasized', 'viewer', 'peasant', 'woman', 'waitress', 'broken', 'down', 'Inn', 'services', 'male', 'guests', 'night', 'survive.The', 'bleak', 'Spanish', 'countryside', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'few', 'non-set', 'vistas', 'film', 'Much', 'film', 'place', 'set', 'derived', 'approach', 'used', 'stage', 'production', 'scrappy', 'costumes', 'also', 'were', 'well', 'done.The', 'theme', 'story', 'line', 'however', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'aspect', 'film', 'see', 'parable', 'triumph', 'unbeatable', 'odds']",N/A
152282,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,0792844920,Classic Movie watcher,"[0, 0]","Unfamiliar with the adventures of Don Quixote and his creator Cervantes, I could watch the movie as far as it would take me.Cervantes(Peter O'Toole) and his manservant(James Coco) were caught for their controversial play in public and awaited the summon of the Spanish Inquisition in a hugh dungeon. Cervantes, having to defend himself and his possessions, explained himself with his play - Don Quixote (a knight the madman Alonso Quijana thought himself to be).The movie moved seamlessly between Cervantes and the prisoners in the dungeon and the adventures of Don Quixote (played by Peter O' Toole and the prisoners). The brave, naive, ever losing Don Quoxite only wanted to beat the evil,the Enchanter, saw life as it should be and not as it is. To him, a windmill was a monster, a barber an enemy, the inn maid Aldonza (Sophie Loren) his lady with a beautiful name Dulcinea. He would dedicate his quest to his lady Dulcinea and in her, he could see nothing but her virtues. Aldonza, already losing hope in the mankind, kept asking Sancho, Quixote's squire, why he followed his master. Amid her denial, she was deeply touched by the love letter Don Quixote wrote her.But time was runnng short for both Cervantes and his creation Don Quoxite - the summon of the Spanish Inqusition was imminent. In the play, Alonso Quijana's illusion of Don Quoxite was cruelly shattered by his future nephew-in-law, leaving Alonso nothing to hold on to in his real life. By this time, the prisoners were all touched by the impossible dream - Don Quixote who would beat the unbeatable foe, right the unrightable wrong and strove with his last ounce of courage to reach the unreachable star. While Cervantes could not alter his fate, he was urged by the prisoners to change Don Quixote's. Alonso Quijana got back his impossible dream, his strength revived. Don Quixote(aka Alonso) jumped out of his sick bed and marched victoriously his last few steps with his squire and his lady. After that, Aldonza the inn maid would only be known as Dulcinea, as her knight would call her. Don Quixote is always there to give people hope, despite the harsh circumstances.In the end, Cervantes, through Don Quixote, touched the prisoners' hearts, even the sceptic ""Duke"" (John Castle) and the woman prisoner Aldonza (Sophia Loren) were inspired. The story ended with Cervantes bravely walking up the bridge to face the Inquisition, leaving behind the transformed and hopeful prisoners singing the Impossible Dream.This is a story well told with great performances by Peter O'Toole and Sophia Loren. To me, no one could play the roles better. The romance between the two was made more touching  because of the impossible circumstances and timing. The faithful Squire/Cervantes' manservant (James Coco) was indispensible. Alonso's Father, niece and housekeeper sang the trio ""I'm only thinking of him"" beautifully. The music and the song ""Impossible Dream"" by Simon Gibert was cleverly inserted in the movie. A musical with a noble message - unrivalled, romantic and beautiful.",5,A touching story accompanied by moving music,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,3046,"['Unfamiliar', 'adventures', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'creator', 'Cervantes', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'would', 'take', 'me.Cervantes', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'manservant', 'James', 'Coco', 'were', 'caught', 'controversial', 'play', 'public', 'awaited', 'summon', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'hugh', 'dungeon', 'Cervantes', 'having', 'defend', 'possessions', 'explained', 'play', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'knight', 'madman', 'Alonso', 'Quijana', 'thought', 'be', '.The', 'movie', 'moved', 'seamlessly', 'Cervantes', 'prisoners', 'dungeon', 'adventures', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'played', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'prisoners', 'brave', 'naive', 'ever', 'losing', 'Don', 'Quoxite', 'only', 'wanted', 'beat', 'evil', 'Enchanter', 'saw', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'windmill', 'was', 'monster', 'barber', 'enemy', 'inn', 'maid', 'Aldonza', 'Sophie', 'Loren', 'lady', 'beautiful', 'name', 'Dulcinea', 'would', 'dedicate', 'quest', 'lady', 'Dulcinea', 'could', 'see', 'nothing', 'virtues', 'Aldonza', 'already', 'losing', 'hope', 'mankind', 'kept', 'asking', 'Sancho', 'Quixote', 'squire', 'why', 'followed', 'master', 'Amid', 'denial', 'was', 'deeply', 'touched', 'love', 'letter', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'wrote', 'her.But', 'time', 'was', 'runnng', 'short', 'Cervantes', 'creation', 'Don', 'Quoxite', 'summon', 'Spanish', 'Inqusition', 'was', 'imminent', 'play', 'Alonso', 'Quijana', 'illusion', 'Don', 'Quoxite', 'was', 'cruelly', 'shattered', 'future', 'nephew-in-law', 'leaving', 'Alonso', 'nothing', 'hold', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'prisoners', 'were', 'touched', 'impossible', 'dream', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'who', 'would', 'beat', 'unbeatable', 'foe', 'right', 'unrightable', 'wrong', 'strove', 'last', 'ounce', 'courage', 'reach', 'unreachable', 'star', 'Cervantes', 'could', 'not', 'alter', 'fate', 'was', 'urged', 'prisoners', 'change', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Alonso', 'Quijana', 'got', 'back', 'impossible', 'dream', 'strength', 'revived', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Alonso', 'jumped', 'sick', 'bed', 'marched', 'victoriously', 'last', 'few', 'steps', 'squire', 'lady', 'Aldonza', 'inn', 'maid', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'known', 'Dulcinea', 'knight', 'would', 'call', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'always', 'there', 'give', 'people', 'hope', 'harsh', 'circumstances.In', 'end', 'Cervantes', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'touched', 'prisoners', 'hearts', 'even', 'sceptic', 'Duke', 'John', 'Castle', 'woman', 'prisoner', 'Aldonza', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'were', 'inspired', 'story', 'ended', 'Cervantes', 'bravely', 'walking', 'up', 'bridge', 'face', 'Inquisition', 'leaving', 'transformed', 'hopeful', 'prisoners', 'singing', 'Impossible', 'Dream.This', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'great', 'performances', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'one', 'could', 'play', 'roles', 'better', 'romance', 'two', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'touching', 'impossible', 'circumstances', 'timing', 'faithful', 'Squire/Cervantes', 'manservant', 'James', 'Coco', 'was', 'indispensible', 'Alonso', 'Father', 'niece', 'housekeeper', 'sang', 'trio', ""'m"", 'only', 'thinking', 'beautifully', 'music', 'song', 'Impossible', 'Dream', 'Simon', 'Gibert', 'was', 'cleverly', 'inserted', 'movie', 'musical', 'noble', 'message', 'unrivalled', 'romantic', 'beautiful']",N/A

OKLAHOMA's singing and dancing cowboys, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN and other ridiculous productions; even so, there are notable exceptions. JOSEPH AND HIS AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT and MAN OF LA MANCHA are just two of my favorites. The latter was a success because it never lost track of the story and the music was nothing short of inspirational.The production, rendered only so-so in conversion to DVD, is worth the price of admission, however, because of its excellent acting, subtle humor, wonderful characters and, most importantly, its lofty moral values. The music doen't require great voices to be effective (in fact, it helps if they're a bit earthy). I've read a number of unfavorable professional reviews by writers who were disappointed that the singing wasn't up to par when compared to singing gang members in New York; but it only shows they missed the point.The production here is fabulous.

152284,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,0792844920,Cowboy Buddha,"[25, 30]","I initially approached this film with a great deal of trepidation. I had always loved Man Of La Mancha on stage - not just for its performances, story, and great songs - but also for the sheer theatricality of the piece. The device of having Cervantes in prison acting out his great creation of Don Quixote was a marvellous one and the imaginative staging was a neverending joy to watch. There was no way this unique and exciting concept could be recreated on film.However, the film makes a better attempt than I expected, substituting a gritty reality for the stylized stage vision. Sometimes this works quite well, particularly in the opening scenes. Other times, a bit more of a dream-like quality would have helped. One good move was to retain the basic design for the huge prison cell, with its long dramatic descending staircase. Visually, the film has promise.But, of course, Man Of La Mancha is a musical and musicals tend to rise or fall on the strength of their performers. For the central role of Cervantes/Quixote, Peter O'Toole was a great choice - in a dramatic sense. His flamboyant acting style suited both characters and he made the transition back and forth with the ease of a seasoned trouper. But Man Of La Mancha was written for performers with strong singing voices and O'Toole, as he proved in Goodbye Mr Chips, doesn't have one. So instead of stirring renditions of ""The Impossible Dream"" and other songs, we get dramatic versions that are  spoken as much as they are sung. This is not as bad as it sounds and O'Toole pulls it off much better than, say, Richard Harris in Camelot. It is only the knowledge of how the songs could sound that leads to a touch of disappointment. Still, O'Toole does better than some of his co-stars.The largely British supporting cast of non-singers does well enough. Dependable old Harry Andrews tries gamely, Brian Blessed roars and stomps as he usually does, and John Castle is quietly effective as a sarcastic cynic. But James Coco as Sancho Panza is a huge obstacle to credibility. Why he was cast is a mystery - presumably someone wanted an American in the project. But he seems uncomfortable and out of place, and the rapport he should have with O'Toole simply isn't there. Then there is Sophia Loren...Loren manages to seem, often at the same time, both perfect for her part and totally miscast. At first glance, she looks wonderful as Aldonza, the serving wench with easy virtue. But, on closer inspection, she occasionally appears too glam and at other times (dare I suggest it?) too old. Her acting is fiery and sexy enough. But I always thought Sophia was a better singer than she demonstrates here. But she looks great in the stills!All in all, Man Of La Mancha arrives on screen reasonably intact but with a cast better suited to its dramatic elements than its musical ones. Man Of La Mancha is such a great play that it will take more than this to ruin it. Its impact may be diminished, but it is still an interesting and relatively enjoyable experience.",3,The Impossible Film?,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,3023,"['initially', 'approached', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'trepidation', 'had', 'always', 'loved', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'stage', 'not', 'just', 'performances', 'story', 'great', 'songs', 'also', 'sheer', 'theatricality', 'piece', 'device', 'having', 'Cervantes', 'prison', 'acting', 'out', 'great', 'creation', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'was', 'marvellous', 'one', 'imaginative', 'staging', 'was', 'neverending', 'joy', 'watch', 'was', 'way', 'unique', 'exciting', 'concept', 'could', 'be', 'recreated', 'film.However', 'film', 'better', 'attempt', 'expected', 'substituting', 'gritty', 'reality', 'stylized', 'stage', 'vision', 'Sometimes', 'quite', 'well', 'particularly', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Other', 'times', 'bit', 'more', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'One', 'good', 'move', 'was', 'retain', 'basic', 'design', 'huge', 'prison', 'cell', 'long', 'dramatic', 'descending', 'staircase', 'Visually', 'film', 'promise.But', 'course', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'musical', 'musicals', 'tend', 'rise', 'fall', 'strength', 'performers', 'central', 'role', 'Cervantes/Quixote', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'flamboyant', 'acting', 'style', 'suited', 'characters', 'made', 'transition', 'back', 'forth', 'ease', 'seasoned', 'trouper', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'was', 'written', 'performers', 'strong', 'singing', 'voices', ""O'Toole"", 'proved', 'Goodbye', 'Mr', 'Chips', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'instead', 'stirring', 'renditions', 'Impossible', 'Dream', 'other', 'songs', 'get', 'dramatic', 'versions', 'are', 'spoken', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'sung', 'not', 'as', 'bad', ""O'Toole"", 'off', 'much', 'better', 'say', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Camelot', 'only', 'knowledge', 'how', 'songs', 'could', 'sound', 'touch', 'disappointment', 'Still', ""O'Toole"", 'better', 'co-stars.The', 'largely', 'British', 'supporting', 'cast', 'non-singers', 'well', 'enough', 'Dependable', 'old', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'gamely', 'Brian', 'Blessed', 'roars', 'stomps', 'usually', 'John', 'Castle', 'quietly', 'effective', 'sarcastic', 'cynic', 'James', 'Coco', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'huge', 'obstacle', 'credibility', 'Why', 'was', 'cast', 'mystery', 'presumably', 'someone', 'wanted', 'American', 'project', 'uncomfortable', 'place', 'rapport', 'should', 'have', ""O'Toole"", 'simply', ""n't"", 'there', 'Then', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Loren', 'seem', 'often', 'same', 'time', 'perfect', 'part', 'totally', 'miscast', 'first', 'glance', 'wonderful', 'Aldonza', 'serving', 'wench', 'easy', 'virtue', 'closer', 'inspection', 'occasionally', 'too', 'glam', 'other', 'times', 'dare', 'suggest', 'too', 'old', 'acting', 'fiery', 'sexy', 'enough', 'always', 'thought', 'Sophia', 'was', 'better', 'singer', 'here', 'great', 'stills', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'screen', 'reasonably', 'intact', 'cast', 'better', 'suited', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'musical', 'ones', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'such', 'great', 'play', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'ruin', 'impact', 'may', 'be', 'diminished', 'still', 'interesting', 'relatively', 'enjoyable', 'experience']",N/A

This movie has a lot of poor choices and bad ideas, but it's also got a lot of good ones that make it worth while. Let's start with the bad and get that out of the way: #1 The dubbing of Peter O'Toole and Sohia Loren is poorly done. The singers (I am not sue of their names) are weak and not suited for the roles. #2 Don Quixote's make up. Poor Peter O'toole has a rubber headpiece that leaves him looking rather suprised through the movie. #3 For somereason entire songs and some resprises are completely missing from this movie. #4 The supporting cast. For the most part the supporting cast is rather unimpressive. Not that they're all that bad, just a bit disappointing.  #5 The begginging drags on a bit and makes you want to fast forward a bit to get to the prison. Now for the good. #1 Peter O'Toole's Cervantes is so brilliantly acted you'll find yourself moved by his speeches. #2 Sophia Loren. A beautiful Woman and a fine actress. The scenes between her and Sancho are so sincere they'll make you laugh out loud. #3 James Coco. Too many Sancho's are rather annoying, but not this one. he's funny, cute, and you can tell how much he cares for his friend #4 This is a beautifully shot film with wonderful angles and just the right lighting to set the mood for each scene. #5 Though I do not know his name, the singing voice of Don Quioxte hits the final note of The Impossible Dream brilliantly.

152298,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0792844920,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","The film is of course a pure creation and it is built on three layers, all of them fictitious, more or less, but always a little or a lot according to what you know or think of Cervantes and Don Quixote. First Cervantes, then Alonso Quijano and finally Don Quixote. The first one is the author. The second one is the real identity of the character. The third one is his imaginary identity in his knight errant fantasy and delusion.The film centers on Cervantes, a playwright and actor who performs in the market place. His plays are satirical and hence attack directly or indirectly the all-powerful church in Spain. It is true Cervantes was excommunicated by the inquisition, but here he is arrested, imprisoned in an underground dungeon and finally summoned for his trial and we will never know the end of it, though we know he was not executed, far from it.Then the film puts him on trial in the vast dungeon where he is imprisoned by the people in the dungeon, under the authority of the one who was appointed governor of this underground society by the inhabitants of this netherland. To defend himself he gets the right to perform his Don Quixote story, whose manuscript got nearly burnt. He uses his props and masks and all the people in the dungeon take part. It is thus a description of the life in such a prison and of a play that is acted in good faith and with fun by the prisoners as an entertainment. Think or dream of an entertainment in such a miserable environment where you do not see the light of day and where anyone can be summoned for trial, which means questioning (I guess this is a nice word for torturing) and then sentencing and executing.If the play is performed in the prison, the camera takes us in real outside d&eacute;cor and setting and we get the Don Quixote story in the real imaginary world of Cervantes. And we get everything, the giant windmills, the horse Rocinante, the whore Dulcinea, and many other niceties of that kind draped in some fantasy or delusion by Don Quixote. That world is cruel, cruel with women first of all, cruel with people who are not ""normal"" then, those who seem to be slightly ""crazy"" or ""corrugated"" if not plainly ""deranged suckers."" Violence is the basic condiment of this life and for women it is rape, which is not rape really in those days, just using the woman the way she is supposed to exist for. Willing or not is not a question in those days and love is nothing but sex at the request of the man and no is not a possible answer from the woman. Like it or not, that's your function. The film is not fuzzy about it.And yet that makes Don Quixote really crazy who lives in a world of chivalry that has been long gone in the sixteenth century, a world of chivalric and courteous love that has never really existed, except as a dream in the minds of some medieval poets, a world of honor, glory and enchanters, hence of some kind of magic that has never had the slightest beginning of an existence or reality.But we evade these two worlds into the real world of the fictional character Alonso Quijano who is dying. He is on his death bed totally unaware of his fantastic adventures when his servant Sancho and the inn maid from the local inn come to visit him and try to revive his delusion to lead him to a pleasurable death. And little by little his memory comes back and he dies singing the song about reaching the unreachable star, as if dying was the surest way to do so, but it sure is a pleasant way to die for Don Quixote, or is it Alonso Quijano?The last and fascinating aspect of the film I want to mention is the music and the songs. They are absolutely mesmerizing and they are worth a fortune of pleasure. We can understand why Jacques Brel recorded the score in its French adaptation. There is no difference between, that Don Quixote and so many of the characters in Jacques Brel's songs, Jacky, Jef and innumerable other Caporal Casse Pompon. It is a true testament about real true voracious life fantasized by a truly insane person who believes a world that was a dream in the Middle Ages is possible in today's global village. The film here works on that dimension so well that there is no hope of any salvation in this universe, nor in any other post mortem cosmos except dying singing about a dreamlike Never-never-land with a Captain Hook and a Tinkerbell in the childish mind of Peter Pan.

I had seen the play both as an ameteur production some 20 years ago, which I loved and a huge professional production in Sydney a couple of years ago. I have never been dissappointed in these. I avoided the film because like ""My Fair Lady"" it was important that the cast could sing and could not face listening to those great numbers suffering from poor vocal interpretation (Why didn't Julie Andrews play 'Eliza' in the film will remain one of the great miscastings of all time!). However I viewed the film version finally this weekend and brother what a stunner. All the cast a exceptional notably O'Toole and Loren, who bowled me over with their bravada performances and the magnificent production values. There hasn't been many musicals I've seen lately that nail the essence of the show as well as this film does. I even coped with the deletion of a couple of great songs such as 'Aldonza's ""Why does he do the things he does"" and the re-writing/editing of Aldonz'a great ""10:30"" number.

Don Quixote set to music must have seemed like a good idea to director, Arthur Hiller at the time, but on screen it's about as painfully shocking as seeing your own mother drunk! Quixote(O'Toole) is a crazy nobleman who is an embarrassment to his respectable family. Together, with faithful sidekick Sancho Panza, he duels windmills and defends his &quot;lady&quot; (Sophia Loren), who is actually a prostitute.The songs, including &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; had their merits on Broadway. But on screen - and sung by actors to whom the concept of singing is clearly as foreign as the subject matter of this film - we get a cackling of melodies that is genuinely painful on the ears. All this would be forgiveable if the production values didn't herald the coming of a lavish film that, sadly, vaporizes the moment any of the principles open their mouths. But such a waste of money and talent is malicious!TRANSFER: Presumably because this film didn't get that much play time in theaters, the DVD picture exhibits striking image quality. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Black levels are solid. Fine details are fully realized. There are NO age related artifacts. Digital anomalies; edge enhancement, pixelization, shimmering of fine details, are rarely present for a smooth visual presentation. The audio is 5.1, made all the more strident and shrill by the deplorable lack of musical talent belting out some truly horrific tunes.EXTRAS: A Photo montage - as if reliving the film experience wasn't scary enough!BOTTOM LINE: The transfer is stunning but the film is a disaster.

I love this film-the cast, the singing, the sets, in fact every aspect is a near-perfect rendering of the vision I have of Don Quixote. I have read the book but have not seen the musical. I have the feeling that many people will never read the book-it's almost 2000 pages long and rather intimidating to people who are not readers. Many people may also never have the opportunity to see the musical, and perhaps the art snots are right and the musical is far superior to the movie. However, the movie does something that the musical and the book don't do-it makes Don Quixote accessible to everyone. Watching Peter O'Toole is to understand how a man can go out and fight windmills. Seeing James Coco at his side is to glimpse the true nature of friendship, for both as Sancho and the stage manager, Coco displays true affection and loyalty to a man whose idealism gets his friends in tight spots.  Perhaps the most compelling evidence I can offer as to the value of the film is this-I have a son who is dyslexic and although I have read many books to him (The Lord of the Rings, Huckleberry Finn, Watership Down, to name a few) I never read him Don Quixote. He didn't want to try reading such a big book, but I told him about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and we talked about the importance of following your dreams and not letting the world dictate to you. Anyway, he was deployed recently and the night before he left we watched Man of La Mancha. After it was over, he said thank you to me for sharing it with him. I'm glad that he has a better understanding now of the word quixotism, because he has always been a person of high ideals with his own mind and I hope he always will be. I will be getting the DVD the day it comes out, and I will keep it next to my copy of Don Quixote, so that I always have them both together. Walter Starkie, who translated Don Quixote, writes that Don Quixote was ""created out of a life of disillusion, privation, and poverty by a maimed ex-soldier...whose noble nature and gentle sense of humerous tolerance taught him that life is an unending dialogue between a knight of the spirit who is ever striving to soar aloft, and a squire who clings to his master and strives with might and main to keep his feet firmly planted on the ground.""

Actually this is the theme of the story---to see beauty in life or to see ugliness, naming that ""reality.""Perhaps I was lucky not to have seen the original stage performance so I wasn't disappointed.  But I agree with the Amazon reviewer that it's hard to imagine anyone better suited to play the role than Peter O'Toole.  O'Toole, better than almost any actor I know, can walk the fine line between madness and sanity without losing his balance.  He brings his own unique qualities of dignity, humour, craziness and beauty to this role.  I would much, much prefer to see such a performance than that of someone who had a ""better"" singing voice.  I loved the way he stood, stick-straight, with no dramatic gestures while singing The Impossible Dream.  Just his posture and regal bearing brought a poignant quality that the best operatic tenor wouldn't have done.  (Some folks here are complaining that he was miscast due to his lack of singing ability while others are complaining that his singing voice was dubbed and they didn't like that singer, either...)I did find the acting of Sophia Loren a little wooden but she looks great and that seems important.  James Coco is adorably rotund and earthy as Sancho Panza.  The rest of the cast does a good job, too.I was surprised that the film was made so long ago.

One reason I love it is that Don Quixote must have read (!) the saying, ""When you tell a man he is brave, you are helping him to become so.""  The Don, this mad-man, sees nothing but the beautiful and pure in the whore Aldonza, and despite her violent rejection of his view of her and the name ""Dulcinea"" that he gives her, she eventually realizes HIS purity of mind and begins to think maybe there is something worthwhile in her after all.  Thus, she becomes, slowly, as he envisions her.  That to me is thrilling.And, I heartily disagree with those reviewers who object to the voices of Peter O'Toole (dubbed) and Sophia Loren.  Sure, they aren't the best, but taking the Don's for instance;  if his voice had been any better, it would have been 'way out of character for the ""Knight of the Woeful Countenance.""
