150644,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0792844068,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[10, 12]","It is a well known fact that I am not a great admirer of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Although he looked handsome enough to be James Bond he never looked tough enough. Much has been made of the fact that although the newest 007 Daniel Craig does not look handsome enough to play the secret agent (some going as far as to call him ""ugly"") he does look tough enough to play the part.In fact I would say that Brosnan looked tougher in the thriller FOURTH PROTOCOL in the part of the Soviet agent (see my review on that product page) and in this movie (made around the same time as the Forsyth thriller) he managed to convey a certain dangerous quality.In this movie, set in his native Ireland, Brosnan plays a debt collector (Mark Taffin) who when not working is happy to spend his time reading books on philosophy and theory. The movie starts by showing us Taffin collecting on some debts. These opening sequences establish his tough credentials as we see him beat up three men in a restaurant (and in the process demolish the establishments dining room) and go head to head with a barman and getting his way (with the help of a wine glass.) Yes, this guy is a toughie, but not one without a softer side displayed when he gives advice to a group of local youths on how to get even with a crooked car dealer who sold them a `lemon.'Although disapproving of his methods the villagers approach him about saving a local sports field threatened by an access road and then stopping the construction of a chemical plant that was to have been served by the access road. In doing so Taffin must confront a shady Mr. Big-style business figure, his henchmen and an assorted group of corrupt politicians in the pocket of the magnate.This is a very entertaining movie that reminded me of the Mike Figgis movie STORMY MONDAY in its depiction of provincial gang violence. But whereas that movie involved the attempt to foil an American developer (played by Tommy Lee Jones) from intimidating Sting's nightclub character in the English city of Newcastle, this movie is much more rural in its focus and is all the better for it. The characters are well drawn and the cast chosen takes full advantage turning in believable performances.Brosnan's character avoids falling into the trap of being an unsympathetic character. The danger is there since he uses less than honorable tactics involving everything from blackmail to downright violence, but we know that he is fighting on the side of what is right and just so we can forgive him. He is also well drawn as a character and in addition to witnessing his troubles with girlfriend Charlotte, we also see him at home with his mother and brother. Its in these dramatic scenes that Brosnan really shows us why he is such an acclaimed actor. I have a new respect for him after seeing him in this movie.On an interesting side note Brosnan is joined here by Alison Doody as Charlotte, who played the part of a Bond girl in the 007 movie A VIEW TO A KILL. Of course he would go on to play the lead in the series, but here the simply stunningly beautiful Doody shows acting promise that she was not permitted in her minor role as an assassin in the 007 picture. No doubt her performance here played a part in her getting the lead female role in the third Indiana Jones movie the following year.",4,Brosnan gets role he can really work with - and it works on so many levels,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,3318,"['well', 'known', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'great', 'admirer', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'James', 'Bond', 'looked', 'handsome', 'enough', 'be', 'James', 'Bond', 'never', 'looked', 'tough', 'enough', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'fact', 'newest', '007', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'not', 'look', 'handsome', 'enough', 'play', 'secret', 'agent', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'ugly', 'look', 'tough', 'enough', 'play', 'part.In', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'Brosnan', 'looked', 'tougher', 'thriller', 'FOURTH', 'PROTOCOL', 'part', 'Soviet', 'agent', 'see', 'review', 'product', 'page', 'movie', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'Forsyth', 'thriller', 'managed', 'convey', 'certain', 'dangerous', 'quality.In', 'movie', 'set', 'native', 'Ireland', 'Brosnan', 'debt', 'collector', 'Mark', 'Taffin', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'working', 'happy', 'spend', 'time', 'reading', 'books', 'philosophy', 'theory', 'movie', 'showing', 'Taffin', 'collecting', 'debts', 'opening', 'sequences', 'establish', 'tough', 'credentials', 'see', 'beat', 'up', 'three', 'men', 'restaurant', 'process', 'demolish', 'establishments', 'dining', 'room', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'barman', 'getting', 'way', 'help', 'wine', 'glass', 'Yes', 'guy', 'toughie', 'not', 'one', 'softer', 'side', 'displayed', 'when', 'advice', 'group', 'local', 'youths', 'how', 'get', 'even', 'crooked', 'car', 'dealer', 'who', 'sold', 'lemon', 'disapproving', 'methods', 'villagers', 'approach', 'saving', 'local', 'sports', 'field', 'threatened', 'access', 'road', 'then', 'stopping', 'construction', 'chemical', 'plant', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'access', 'road', 'doing', 'so', 'Taffin', 'must', 'confront', 'shady', 'Mr.', 'Big-style', 'business', 'figure', 'henchmen', 'assorted', 'group', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'pocket', 'magnate.This', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'movie', 'STORMY', 'MONDAY', 'depiction', 'provincial', 'gang', 'violence', 'movie', 'involved', 'attempt', 'foil', 'American', 'developer', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'intimidating', 'Sting', 'nightclub', 'character', 'English', 'city', 'Newcastle', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'rural', 'focus', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'cast', 'chosen', 'full', 'advantage', 'turning', 'believable', 'performances.Brosnan', 'character', 'avoids', 'falling', 'trap', 'being', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'danger', 'there', 'less', 'honorable', 'tactics', 'involving', 'everything', 'blackmail', 'downright', 'violence', 'know', 'fighting', 'side', 'what', 'right', 'just', 'can', 'forgive', 'also', 'well', 'drawn', 'character', 'addition', 'witnessing', 'troubles', 'girlfriend', 'Charlotte', 'also', 'see', 'home', 'mother', 'brother', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Brosnan', 'really', 'why', 'such', 'acclaimed', 'actor', 'have', 'new', 'respect', 'seeing', 'movie.On', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'Brosnan', 'joined', 'here', 'Alison', 'Doody', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'Bond', 'girl', '007', 'movie', 'VIEW', 'TO', 'A', 'KILL', 'course', 'would', 'go', 'play', 'lead', 'series', 'here', 'simply', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Doody', 'acting', 'promise', 'was', 'not', 'permitted', 'minor', 'role', 'assassin', '007', 'picture', 'doubt', 'performance', 'here', 'played', 'part', 'getting', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'third', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'following', 'year']",N/A

As a matter of fact if I could re-watch Taffin vs any of Pierce's Bond flicks, I'd take Taffin any day. I am always entertained more by English films (or in this case Irish), than I am by most American films, they just seem more unpredictable because I don't know what to expect. Taffin has Pierce looking really cool (and he still is semi young so more believable as a killer to me), plus the eye candy is not too shabby in this one with some nice topless views that you wont get in a Bond film. Is it full of plot holes? Yeah big time, but Pierce kicks some ass his way and does it in a funny way. Its an American 60's crime flick thats light on the moral dialog, its just the bad corporation and the little townsfolk hiring their gunslinger to protect them. Pierce does it in a very sly way and doesn't resort to the kill until he has to. I see a LOT of low votes on this film on IMDB, they must hate English speaking foreign films (or they're psycho Lazenby Bond lovers out to besmirch all of Pierce's films, lol). Me, I liked the films Pierce did around this time, like Livewire and the Deceivers. I think I've liked most flicks Pierce has been in that I saw (one of those Bond flicks with a bad-guy taking over the internet or something was lame but any Bond flick is good or bad based on the bad guy not so much the Bond), and Taffin had me smiling, it was cool entertainment.
