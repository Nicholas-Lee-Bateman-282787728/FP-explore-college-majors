Cueing was impeccable and throughout she offers tips for modification and safety while getting maximum burn from the exercise.The workout itself flew by and was so much fun! she moves between cardio type moves (mainly low impact) and pilates inspired exercises. The end result is calorie burn and toning in one neat package.Viveca and her team are engaging and she inspires without being abrasive or condescending.I really can't commend this one highly enough- get it!

So sometimes her bubbly attitude can sort of irk you a d a few times the cueing seems off.You will sweat and work your thighs, buns and abs + cardio but the instructor can be a bit much, when you normally workout with Jillan, Jari Love and Bob Harper.

( I already had a lot of Jillian's and Jackie's, Sean T's and Tony Horton's.)  I was not disappointed.  The first video- an hour long- was heavy on the cardio and it was a good overall body workout.  The bonus workouts-  3-  20 minute videos -  these were killer workouts-  she really worked each body part  (except for chest) to the max-  I am pretty fit and work out daily but these workouts really burned.

1673635,AVOWQEFO0P3B4,B00FXCITZI,Kaley Quinn,"[6, 8]","&#8220;Piloxing&#8221; seeks to combine cardio kickboxing, ballet moves and Pilates into a fast-paced workout that tones the whole body. I was skeptical at first about how this would work, but Swedish trainer Viveca Jensen somehow makes it all work, and even makes it fun. Her motto is &#8220;Sleek, Sexy, Powerful,&#8221; and you definitely feel this throughout the workout. Her bubbly energy and enthusiasm makes you want to work harder -- but she always cautions you to work at your own level and &#8220;do what you can.&#8221;The hour-long workout was a sweat-inducing combination of boxing and moves that were sort of like standing Pilates moves. Some were also very similar to ballet movements, such as pli&eacute;s and tendus. I definitely felt it in my legs, and in my arms too -- in the video they wear &#8220;Piloxing&#8221; gloves that weigh 1 pound each, I think, but I didn&#8217;t have them so I used light wrist weights. I also loved that this is a workout you can do in your bare feet -- Viveca and some of her back-up crew don&#8217;t wear any shoes. However, for some of the jumping moves, such as the jump-and-switch boxing stance, shoes might be a good idea after all.The &#8220;Express&#8221; workout was a series of moves targeting arms, butt/thighs, and abs. These were more Pilates-oriented and were all excellent toners, especially the butt and abs sections. Her cueing is good, reminding about keeping shoulders down and abs tight.I would recommend this video to anyone who loves fun fast-paced cardio, wants to do some toning without heavy weights, and likes Pilates in addition to some &#8220;dancey&#8221; steps. Is it pure boxing or Pilates? No. But it uses some of the moves from each in a light-hearted workout that will get your heart pumping and your muscles working.",5,"Fun, fast-paced workout",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1801,"['8220', 'Piloxing', '8221', 'combine', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'ballet', 'moves', 'Pilates', 'fast-paced', 'workout', 'whole', 'body', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'how', 'would', 'work', 'Swedish', 'trainer', 'Viveca', 'Jensen', 'somehow', 'work', 'even', 'fun', 'motto', '8220', 'Sleek', 'Sexy', 'Powerful', '8221', 'definitely', 'feel', 'workout', 'bubbly', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'want', 'work', 'harder', 'always', 'cautions', 'work', 'own', 'level', '8220', 'do', 'what', 'can.', '8221', 'hour-long', 'workout', 'was', 'sweat-inducing', 'combination', 'boxing', 'moves', 'were', 'sort', 'standing', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'similar', 'ballet', 'movements', 'such', 'pli', 'eacute', 'tendus', 'definitely', 'felt', 'legs', 'arms', 'too', 'video', 'wear', '8220', 'Piloxing', '8221', 'gloves', 'weigh', '1', 'pound', 'think', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'so', 'used', 'light', 'wrist', 'weights', 'also', 'loved', 'workout', 'can', 'do', 'bare', 'feet', 'Viveca', 'back-up', 'crew', 'don', '8217', 'wear', 'shoes', 'However', 'jumping', 'moves', 'such', 'jump-and-switch', 'boxing', 'stance', 'shoes', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'all.The', '8220', 'Express', '8221', 'workout', 'was', 'series', 'moves', 'targeting', 'arms', 'butt/thighs', 'abs', 'were', 'more', 'Pilates-oriented', 'were', 'excellent', 'toners', 'especially', 'butt', 'abs', 'sections', 'cueing', 'good', 'reminding', 'keeping', 'shoulders', 'down', 'abs', 'tight.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'fun', 'fast-paced', 'cardio', 'do', 'toning', 'heavy', 'weights', 'Pilates', 'addition', '8220', '8221', 'steps', 'pure', 'boxing', 'Pilates', 'No', 'moves', 'light-hearted', 'workout', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'muscles', 'working']",Piloxing - The Original V Pilates Workout

I don't know... it seemed a bit unstructured and a little boring to me. I shouldn't be too upset since the price is so good (you get what you pay for, right?) but I found myself distracted by other things around the house instead of focusing my attention on the workout. First of all, I was a little annoyed that I didn't see where it said on the DVD case/menu screen how long the workout was so I wasn't exactly sure how long I was going to be doing it. The case said something like 2 hours and I KNOW that wasn't for the main workout only. I like to have a mental countdown of how much time is left during workouts, like most people! I also felt a little claustrophobic for some reason because Viveca's assistants seemed way too close together on the screen. I think it was the angle at which they were filmed, but they felt crammed into my TV screen. I wasn't overly impressed with any of the choreography; most of it I had done before in other workouts, but some moves she put a &#34;sassy&#34; edge on to make more feminine and fun. I did the workout for about 40 minutes before turning it off so I don't know what else I've missed or how much was left of the workout - I guess I will attempt it another day - but the only part of my body that was sore the next day were my triceps from all of those pushback exercises.

Definitely something to put in rotation.There are 3 20-minute workouts for abs, arms and lower body in the bonus section which I was looking forward to doing on a light day, but they are all sculpting and no cardio. I would prefer a quick cardio in the beginning before getting to sculpting. They also are grouped together without a menu section.
