It's excellent.  I will tell you nothing about it because you will love it from the beginning and then want to watch it all over again.  I recommend using subtitles, so you don't miss some of the great lines that are immediately at the beginning of the movie.  Tony Shaloub's character at the beginning (and throughout the entire movie) has some awesome lines.  I wish there was a list of movies like this that I could add to my watch list.  Legend of 1900 is a great one that people who love Paulie might also love.  However, it has lots of &#34;f&#34; bombs in it, so it might not be a family viewing movie.  However, without the &#34;f&#34; bombs, it's an absolutely delightful movie.  Oh ... and if you watch it, take a peak at Ivy as a young woman by looking up Gena Rowland's bio.  She's stunning!

63924,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,0783231210,"Elaine Campbell ""Desert Dweller""","[29, 30]","I am an adult.  No children.  Not a fan of animated films (didn't much like ""Babe"").  That said, this film completely captivated me and even left me believing in the enduring power of love and the great importance of it in our topsy-turvy world.Bought it on a fluke after reading a few reviews while surfing [...].  Didn't expect much.  Got everything.I highly recommend it, both for adults and children (what a perfect film for a family to watch together), and here's why.Oh, where to start.  I would start with the fact that the most perfect voice was chosen to be our talking, and very smart, albeit sad, Paulie.  Actor Jay Morh (the voice) also plays a role in the film very well indeed.  His voice as a human is completely different than that of Paulie's, which shows this actor's talented skill.Now what else do we have.  A script which is entirely unpredictable.  There is nothing trite, no cliches, the screenwriting (by Laurie Craig) is at its best, original and highly creative.The story, well, it flows along, happy at times and sometimes sad.  Sometimes very, very happy, and sometimes very, very sad.  But the outcome is one of the most beautiful and sensitive scenes I have ever seen in any film.The acting:  one of the country's most sterling actresses, Gena Rowlands, excels in her role as an eccentric, impulsive, loving and honest woman who befriends Paulie to the max.  I believe the other great performance in the film was given by Tony Shalhoub, who has gone on to such great success since the making of this film.  On watching ""Paulie,"" one can easily see why.  His performance is sensitive and touching, honest and just plain admirable.Also, great commendations to the film's director, John Roberts, for finding the truth within himself to direct a story with such integrity.And let's not forget the 14 conures, all who play Paulie with such poignant believability, or the dancing ensemble of conures who perform a musical routine (even in costume) as well as humans could do it.Have a good time with this one, no matter how old you are.

He's the protagonist, so he's supposed to be very likable. But in the second half of the film, he simply cannot shut up. He constantly spews out one-liners, puns, absurdities, insults, blah blah blah. The makers of this movie should have at least toned it all down by giving him less dialogue.

However, this isn't an ordinary bird. Paulie is a talking bird who has had adventures with a little girl, an elderly woman, a mariachi performer, a two-timing robber. Now he's only left in the basement as a science experiment, with his wings clipped. If only he could meet the little girl he loves. Perhaps the janitor could give him a hand.This is very much a fantasy tale, with a bird who lives more than 20 years, with a wide assortment of star actors. Gena Rowlands finds Paulie in a magic shop in New York, and takes Paulie on a fun trip around the country. Cheech Marin plays the warm-hearted mariachi performer who brings Paulie to sing with his parrots. Jay Mohr gives a splendid performance as Benny, the cheating crook.This was also a big performance by the great Tony Shalhoub, known today for his hit series, ""Monk."" As Russian immigrant janitor, Misha Vilyenkov, Shalhoub goes above and beyond, freeing Paulie from his cage in a tear-jerking scene. Although the movie lingers a little too long in the stuffy laboratory basement, the final escape from the university makes for a dazzling scene with a flying parrot and many dogs and cats running around, among other things.Yes, ""Paulie"" is more or less predictable, but the film does so many things right. The characters are memorable. Even though some parts are a little too comical, it remains pretty solid to the end.
