The writing sux, even the acting is low par... I mean, the acting is good on Dafoe/Redfords roles, but it doesn't make the movie any better... and how it's filmed is weird too... there's constant flashbacks, and it's hard to connect the dots in this one, to follow the story... you have to watch it like 2-3 times in order to follow... it's not a hard to understand movie... it's just how it flows that's weird...it's like sequenced wrong or something.. you can take a movie that has total unknown actors in it and that movie turns out to be the best damn thing you ever saw!! and then you can take a movie like ""The Clearing"" and throw in 2 household name actors, but have that movie totally bomb, which is what it did where i'm from (i'm from NY, and it bombed there, even on rental..).I've seen this movie twice...if i ever watched it again, it would be me renting it, maybe once a year.. or less.If you want the movie, don't pay more then at least $5 for it. I bought it for $2 at EBgames used... I only still own it cuase my mom loves it, (for Redford though, not for the story line)..I'm not going to reiterate what the other reviewers said on the story line... I can see why this movie is selling here for a low price of so far 89 cents...it's not even worth that.. you shouldn't even pay for this movie... it should be free... and if someone offered it to me for free, i probaly would turn their offer down...",1,Based on a lie - 1 to 2 star rating here,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1590,"['When', 'i', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'i', 'only', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'cuase', 'i', 'love', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'movie', 'freakin', 'writing', 'sux', 'even', 'acting', 'low', 'par', 'mean', 'acting', 'good', 'Dafoe/Redfords', 'roles', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'how', 'filmed', 'weird', 'too', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'hard', 'connect', 'dots', 'one', 'follow', 'story', 'have', 'watch', '2-3', 'times', 'order', 'follow', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'weird', 'sequenced', 'wrong', 'something..', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'total', 'unknown', 'actors', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'damn', 'thing', 'ever', 'saw', 'then', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'Clearing', 'throw', '2', 'household', 'name', 'actors', 'have', 'movie', 'totally', 'bomb', 'what', 'did', 'where', 'i', ""'m"", 'i', ""'m"", 'NY', 'bombed', 'there', 'even', 'rental..', '.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'i', 'ever', 'watched', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'renting', 'maybe', 'once', 'year..', 'less.If', 'want', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', 'then', 'least', '5', 'bought', '2', 'EBgames', 'used', 'only', 'still', 'own', 'cuase', 'mom', 'Redford', 'not', 'story', 'line', '..I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reiterate', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'selling', 'here', 'low', 'price', 'so', 'far', '89', 'cents', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'that..', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'someone', 'offered', 'free', 'i', 'probaly', 'would', 'turn', 'offer']",The Clearing
849296,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002XVKLS,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","This was, hands down, the biggest surprise of a film that I have encountered in a very long time.  I had to watch this film twice to fully understand and appreciate the value placed behind it.  The Clearing was one of those films that didn't do well at the box-office, so people didn't bother seeing it when it was released on video.  I must admit, I was one of them.  I thought Redford and Dafoe doing another classic kidnapping film would be just another canister in the Hollywood recycling bin, but I was wrong ... actually, I was dead wrong.  This film brought more than just a kidnapping caper to the table, it brought some family drama, the unbreakable bond between husband and wife, and the idea of the American Dream as told by two ends of the spectrum.  I can see why this film didn't do well with the brainwashed by action/adventure crowd, because there actually needed to be some thinking involved to truly appreciate this captivating film.To begin, this is not a linear story.  I loved this.  It kept me guessing throughout the entire film as to what was happening to Redford's character while the drama at home continued to build.  Here we have the events happening to Redford going on in real time and how the pressures of the immediate threat are being handled, but then you have the family struggle, which is taking place over several days to show how easily something like this can devastate and ravish a family.  This also allowed us to become more emotionally attached to Redford's family as well as to Redford himself.  Strangely, I found myself equally attached to Willem Dafoe's character due to my experience living in the middle of the income line.  There seemed to be some honesty and truth in the banter between Redford and Dafoe that I honestly never saw coming.  Here we had two humans out in nature discussing life and death as if this was their final moments on the planet.  We had front row seats with the ability to hear how these two grown men handled the stress of their day to day activities, and how we could somehow relate.This was a film about relating, about understanding the pressures that these individual people were experiencing.  Redford was perfect, as this tired father who lusts for life, but just doesn't quite show it until the final moments are settling in.  Dafoe should have won an Oscar for his role in this film as a very humble kidnapper who takes pride in what he is doing as well as does it with the highest amount of kindness in his heart.  He does it for his wife.  This brings a smile on my face to say, but this is a film about wives.  Each of these men are going through life to ensure that their wife stays happy and in love with them.  Dafoe thinks it can happen by having enough money so his wife will not work, Redford sees it too late and reminds his wife of a happy time in their marriage.  It is sad, from one married man to another it is a very personal and touching story about the woman that is your soulmate.  Then, as if director Pieter Jan Brugge, didn't stab our hearts enough, he gives us this expanded look at Redford's family and the inner struggles they are facing with not knowing if their father is alive.What is so interesting about this is that before this event took place, there was not much of a family dynamic going on in Redford's house.  They were stale, and strangely this horrific event brought them closer together than imagined.  We get to see the unparalleled emotion behind Helen Mirren that I have not seen in a very long time.  If she would not have done this film than Charlotte Rampling would have equally been as good ... in fact, I kept thinking of her in this role and how skilled she would have been.  Don't get me wrong, Mirren was perfect, but Rampling would have been perfection.Add to this mix some beautiful cinematography that adds to both the tension and beauty of the story.  Some of the scenes with Dafoe and Redford in the woods were so crisp and bold that I thought I was right there in the woods with them.  The way that Pieter Jan Brugge doesn't keep the camera directly on our actors just builds more tension and more excitement along the way.  I thought this was a brilliant film that should have received more attention than what was given to it.  I realize that some will find it slow and methodical, but I found it this stunning portrait of the American family and American dream bundled up in the strangest of forms, a kidnapping film.  There was definitely some creativity at work here, and the final product shows us that!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Do you love me?,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,4573,"['was', 'down', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'have', 'encountered', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'watch', 'film', 'twice', 'fully', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'value', 'placed', 'Clearing', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box-office', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'thought', 'Redford', 'Dafoe', 'doing', 'classic', 'kidnapping', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'canister', 'Hollywood', 'recycling', 'bin', 'was', 'wrong', 'actually', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', 'film', 'brought', 'more', 'just', 'kidnapping', 'caper', 'table', 'brought', 'family', 'drama', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'husband', 'wife', 'idea', 'American', 'Dream', 'told', 'two', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'brainwashed', 'action/adventure', 'crowd', 'actually', 'needed', 'be', 'thinking', 'involved', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'captivating', 'film.To', 'begin', 'not', 'linear', 'story', 'loved', 'kept', 'guessing', 'entire', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Redford', 'character', 'drama', 'home', 'continued', 'build', 'Here', 'have', 'events', 'happening', 'Redford', 'going', 'real', 'time', 'how', 'pressures', 'immediate', 'threat', 'are', 'being', 'handled', 'then', 'have', 'family', 'struggle', 'taking', 'place', 'several', 'days', 'show', 'how', 'easily', 'something', 'can', 'devastate', 'ravish', 'family', 'also', 'allowed', 'become', 'more', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'Redford', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Redford', 'Strangely', 'found', 'equally', 'attached', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'character', 'due', 'experience', 'living', 'middle', 'income', 'line', 'seemed', 'be', 'honesty', 'truth', 'banter', 'Redford', 'Dafoe', 'honestly', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'Here', 'had', 'two', 'humans', 'out', 'nature', 'discussing', 'life', 'death', 'was', 'final', 'moments', 'planet', 'had', 'front', 'row', 'seats', 'ability', 'hear', 'how', 'two', 'grown', 'men', 'handled', 'stress', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'how', 'could', 'somehow', 'relate.This', 'was', 'film', 'relating', 'understanding', 'pressures', 'individual', 'people', 'were', 'experiencing', 'Redford', 'was', 'perfect', 'tired', 'father', 'who', 'life', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'show', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'settling', 'Dafoe', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'film', 'very', 'humble', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'pride', 'what', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'highest', 'amount', 'kindness', 'heart', 'wife', 'smile', 'face', 'say', 'film', 'wives', 'men', 'are', 'going', 'life', 'ensure', 'wife', 'happy', 'love', 'Dafoe', 'can', 'happen', 'having', 'enough', 'money', 'wife', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'Redford', 'too', 'late', 'wife', 'happy', 'time', 'marriage', 'sad', 'one', 'married', 'man', 'very', 'personal', 'touching', 'story', 'woman', 'soulmate', 'Then', 'director', 'Pieter', 'Jan', 'Brugge', 'did', ""n't"", 'stab', 'hearts', 'enough', 'expanded', 'look', 'Redford', 'family', 'inner', 'struggles', 'are', 'facing', 'not', 'knowing', 'father', 'so', 'interesting', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'family', 'going', 'Redford', 'house', 'were', 'stale', 'strangely', 'horrific', 'event', 'brought', 'closer', 'together', 'imagined', 'get', 'see', 'unparalleled', 'emotion', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'would', 'have', 'equally', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'fact', 'kept', 'thinking', 'role', 'how', 'skilled', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Mirren', 'was', 'perfect', 'Rampling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfection.Add', 'mix', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'both', 'tension', 'beauty', 'story', 'scenes', 'Dafoe', 'Redford', 'woods', 'were', 'so', 'crisp', 'bold', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'woods', 'way', 'Pieter', 'Jan', 'Brugge', ""n't"", 'keep', 'camera', 'directly', 'actors', 'just', 'builds', 'more', 'tension', 'more', 'excitement', 'way', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'more', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'realize', 'will', 'find', 'slow', 'methodical', 'found', 'stunning', 'portrait', 'American', 'family', 'American', 'dream', 'bundled', 'up', 'strangest', 'forms', 'kidnapping', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'creativity', 'work', 'here', 'final', 'product', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",The Clearing

849298,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0002XVKLS,Benjamin,"[5, 9]","THE CLEARING was one of the most disappointing films I saw this summer, probably because I felt that the three main stars having a conversation over lunch would've been more interesting to watch. I mean, who would've thought it possible that a film featuring Robert Redford, Helen Mirren and Willem Dafoe would be, above all other things, terrifically boring?Redford stars in the film as a rich, self-made businessman who's kidnapped in broad daylight in front of his house. His wife, played by Mirren, is shown in the days that follow her husband's disappearance growing more and more distraught over the possibilities of what might've happened. She, at first, cannot tell if he's merely left her for a mistress or if something else has gone wrong.While the film follows her story, it intercuts scenes showing what exactly happened to Redford's character on the day of his abduction. Essentially, he walked in the woods and spoke at length with his kidnapper, played by Dafoe, whom he may or may not have met before.I was expecting an intriguing thriller with difficult to guess plot twists. I got nothing of the sort. The story is exactly what it appears to be from the very first frame. There are no shocks. There are no key plot developments. It is not a mystery.When that happens in a film like ""Open Water,"" you still get the sense of atmospheric dread, the horror of the situation that the characters are in. In ""The Clearing,"" a film with more accomplished ""name"" actors, you get no sense of dread or no real sense of the situation's horror. The actors in the film aren't bad. It's just that they're given such one-note characters to play, and it's a wasted opportunity to put people this talented in a film like this.",1,Great actors given absolutely nothing to do.,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,1726,"['CLEARING', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'films', 'saw', 'summer', 'probably', 'felt', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'having', 'conversation', 'lunch', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'mean', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'possible', 'film', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'things', 'terrifically', 'boring', 'Redford', 'film', 'rich', 'self-made', 'businessman', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'broad', 'daylight', 'front', 'house', 'wife', 'played', 'Mirren', 'shown', 'days', 'follow', 'husband', 'disappearance', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'distraught', 'possibilities', 'what', 'might', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'merely', 'left', 'mistress', 'something', 'else', 'gone', 'film', 'story', 'scenes', 'showing', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Redford', 'character', 'day', 'abduction', 'Essentially', 'walked', 'woods', 'spoke', 'length', 'kidnapper', 'played', 'Dafoe', 'whom', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'met', 'before.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'intriguing', 'thriller', 'difficult', 'guess', 'plot', 'twists', 'got', 'nothing', 'sort', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'are', 'shocks', 'are', 'key', 'plot', 'developments', 'not', 'mystery.When', 'film', 'Open', 'Water', 'still', 'get', 'sense', 'atmospheric', 'dread', 'horror', 'situation', 'characters', 'are', 'Clearing', 'film', 'more', 'accomplished', 'name', 'actors', 'get', 'sense', 'dread', 'real', 'sense', 'situation', 'horror', 'actors', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', ""'re"", 'given', 'such', 'one-note', 'characters', 'play', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'put', 'people', 'talented', 'film']",The Clearing
849299,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B0002XVKLS,Bob L,"[3, 6]","I'm not going to talk about the plot as it is so simple there is hardly anything to discuss. This seems to be the major problem with the writers of the negative reviews. They all seem to feel the way I did after I went to the theater to see The Blair Witch Project. I suppose I went into that movie with some notions and certain expectations and they weren't nearly fulfilled. I think the disappointed reviewers of The Clearing weren't realizing there were going to see an ""Art House"" film and thought they would be seeing, and experiencing, a ""major studio"" type thiller. When I rented (which might be important) The Clearing I at least knew I was going to be seeing an ""Indie"" and I was ready for anything from My Dinner with Andre to The Crying Game. I think I might have been more expecting the latter and got the former.I was not disappointed by the lack of excitement. I've been watching Robert Redford for 40 years now and I do believe this is my favorite performance. He brought a lot of himself to this role and it pays off in depth and believability. I found his performance to be a lot like Michael Douglas' in The Game and in both movies, certainly, the films would be amiss without their ""stamp"". Willem DaFoe matches Redford step for step in a role that most actors go for an overblown characterization. His amazing range is demostrated through years of continuing success in a vast assortment of roles. Helen Mirren brings understanding to a role that most actors would not know how to play, for its character's reactions would be alien to the more emotional part of most. Her character's reactions and general tone are due to motivations that have caused a ""tempering"" over time and this beautifully realized by Mirren.I find this reminiscent of In The Bedroom but without melodramatic violence, which I found out of place and unnecessary. The Clearing is quite somber in its approach and might be way too quiet for someone not looking for an introspective film. Contrary to many reviewers I found this to be a short film (not interminably long) and I found the ending to be profound and a very satisfying closure. So be forewarned, it's not The Bourne Identity (which I loved) and there are some negative reviews here that insist on ""giving it all away"". So if you think you might want to see this, careful what you read.",5,"""Clearing"" It Up",1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2338,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'plot', 'so', 'simple', 'hardly', 'anything', 'discuss', 'be', 'major', 'problem', 'writers', 'negative', 'reviews', 'seem', 'feel', 'way', 'did', 'went', 'theater', 'see', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'suppose', 'went', 'movie', 'notions', 'certain', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'fulfilled', 'think', 'disappointed', 'reviewers', 'Clearing', 'were', ""n't"", 'realizing', 'were', 'going', 'see', 'Art', 'House', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'experiencing', 'major', 'studio', 'type', 'thiller', 'When', 'rented', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'Clearing', 'least', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'seeing', 'Indie', 'was', 'ready', 'anything', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'Crying', 'Game', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'expecting', 'latter', 'got', 'former.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'excitement', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Robert', 'Redford', '40', 'years', 'now', 'do', 'believe', 'favorite', 'performance', 'brought', 'lot', 'role', 'depth', 'believability', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'lot', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Game', 'movies', 'certainly', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'amiss', 'stamp', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'Redford', 'step', 'step', 'role', 'most', 'actors', 'go', 'overblown', 'characterization', 'amazing', 'range', 'demostrated', 'years', 'continuing', 'success', 'vast', 'assortment', 'roles', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'understanding', 'role', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'reactions', 'would', 'be', 'alien', 'more', 'emotional', 'part', 'most', 'character', 'reactions', 'general', 'tone', 'are', 'due', 'motivations', 'have', 'caused', 'tempering', 'time', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'Mirren.I', 'find', 'reminiscent', 'Bedroom', 'melodramatic', 'violence', 'found', 'place', 'unnecessary', 'Clearing', 'quite', 'somber', 'approach', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'quiet', 'someone', 'not', 'looking', 'introspective', 'film', 'Contrary', 'many', 'reviewers', 'found', 'be', 'short', 'film', 'not', 'interminably', 'long', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'profound', 'very', 'satisfying', 'closure', 'So', 'be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'loved', 'are', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'insist', 'giving', 'away', 'So', 'think', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'careful', 'what', 'read']",The Clearing

In reality, having an amazing cast like this actually works against ""The Clearing.""  One has to wonder:  didn't these stars even read the script?  And if they had, wouldn't they have just responded, ""Pass.  Next project?""That being said, I believe that Robert Redford was miscast here.  While I am a big fan of his, this didn't feel like the correct role for him.  He's too cool; too smooth.  And that is one of his weaknesses in this film.  When he is held captive by Willem Dafoe, I just didn't buy Mr. Redford's coolness.  If I were held captive, I know that I would be terrified.  I can't imagine anyone being that cool under pressure.Also, his wife is Hellen Mirren.  Now, I don't know about you, but if she were my wife I wouldn't much be tempted to even look at other women.  Meow.  Yes, even at her age.  But this little plot element was thrown in just to add a little intrigue to the film.  Should she attempt to save her husband, or should she hold his indiscretions against him and just say ""bye bye""?  And it also allowed the writer to have the characters reexperience their pasts, for no apparent reason other than to fill an hour an a half.If you want to see a far better film with some similarities, check out ""Proof of Life"" instead, with Russel Crowe, who gets a bad rap (perhaps he deserves some of it?) but is an excellent actor.

The movie treats about the kidnapping of a successful businessman by an old dismissed employee without so many chance, as economy has hard laws. I think this movie is very good although I find some doubts as these long ascension by the forest in search of nothing by a couple of men yet not young, ever eating and fighting, surely with the purpose to hide the crime but that seems excessive. The beginning is unitary, but soon the plot divides in two parts that happens in two separate times: the physical kidnapping isn't synchronous with the events in the house, that develops much more faster including the intervention of the FBI and the sons of the couple played by Helen Mirren and Redford and, the demand of rescue and the end.It isn't strange the evaluations of this movie aren't very high as public of today uses to like big amounts of external action, shootings and all these, but this is another class of police movie I think more real. Redford and Mirren apparently have a good marriage rounding a duration of 30 years apparently happy, but the wife knows his husband has a lover and possibly has had others in the past. Business of Redford are legal, but the employee played by William Dafoe shows fails or perhaps injustices  in the system as he was a good worker in the past but now a jobless although not a stupid, as the kidnapping is well conceived. Yes, as Redford says, surely he hasn't  a character strong enough to triumph, as it's suggested at the end with his stupid manner of wasting the money that a man of his intelligence should suspect is marked, as in search of a sort of autopunition, but all these is debatable, and of course they debate, and I find in all that resides the interest of the film when believe the performance of Helen Mirren is superior to the others (also she has a personage of special relevance).

Such is the case for THE CLEARING.Based on an actual story of a kidnapping that occurred in Holland, writer/director Pieter Jan Brugge and co-writer Justin Haythe have fashioned a script that is more concentrated on inner dialogues than on exposition.  Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford) and his wife Eileen (Helen Mirren) are the model of the American Dream: they have built their lives on hard work and ingenuity, raising themselves to a world of wealth and prosperity, while successfully rearing two children, Tim (Alessandro Nivola) and Jill (Melissa Sagemiller).  One morning Wayne leaves for work and never returns.  Eileen reports him missing and soon the FBI are in their home and the process of monitoring a kidnapping is formed.The film is divided into two parts that seem to run parallel until the truth of the events is made known at the end.  Wayne has been abducted by a disgruntle ex-employee Arnold (Willem Dafoe) and is taken into the woods, headed for a clearing where a house is waiting with the masterminds of the kidnapping.  The dialogue between Wayne and Arnold unfolds the disparate lives of the two men and the conversation, while never less than genteel, is full of hidden portions of each man's personality.  Concurrently, Eileen and her children work with the FBI and follow the kidnapper's orders with disappointing results.  The, again, genteel conversations/interrogations between the FBI agent Ray Fuller (Matt Craven) and Eileen uncover aspects of the Hayes' life that explore the intimacy and understanding of the bumps that strong marriages endure.  The results of the kidnapping are powerfully told and revealing the facts would destroy the tension.The three actors - Mirren, Redford, Dafoe - illuminate their roles and give some of the finer performances of the past year.  It will be difficult to forget the myriad facial expressions of Helen Mirren, who tells us more about both Eileen and about wives of successful men than even the fine dialogue she is given.This film is a chamber piece, gratefully not opting for the 'special effects focus' of Hollywood blockbusters.  It simply takes a thought and embellishes the permutations of an act - and that is more than enough.

Newlyweds and those married for less than, say, ten years - perhaps longer - may leave the theater thinking, &quot;What was that all about?&quot; Gum-chewing, adolescent singles needn't bother even buying a ticket.Successful executive Wayne Haynes (Robert Redford) lives the good life in an elegant mansion in a leafy suburb with his wife of decades, Eileen (Helen Mirren). One morning on the way to work, Wayne is kidnapped by Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe), a former employee, and made to march at gunpoint deep into the woods, ostensibly to be handed over to accomplices waiting in a cabin who've planned the escapade for reasons to be revealed. Eileen is left to expect developments and a ransom note with FBI agent Fuller (Matt Craven).To be honest, I kept expecting a plot twist that would reach out, knock the popcorn from my hands, and scream &quot;Gotcha!&quot; And, admittedly, I was a little disappointed when that didn't happen, even though there's a mildly clever manipulation of the timelines of the two subplots, i.e. Wayne's forced march and Eileen's worried vigil. However, upon reflection, I realize that THE CLEARING isn't about a kidnapping, but rather the evolution of a marriage and the emotional ties that bind even in one that's gone stale, where the only things left are emotional dissatisfaction, dutiful commitment, and resigned toleration. Indeed, Mack's motive for the crime is left unexplored, but it doesn't have to be; it's simply a means to an end.This film is overpopulated. Eileen is joined by her adult children, daughter Jill (Melissa Sagemiller) and son Tim (Alessandro Nivola), the latter with his own wife and infant son. The casting director should have stayed solely with the Redford, Mirren, Dafoe, and Craven characters. Except for a poignant and revealing confrontation between Eileen and The Other Woman (Wendy Crewson), the rest of the ensemble only provides unnecessary clutter.Old pros Redford and Mirren show the audience and the younger generations of thespians what quality acting is all about in an adult drama that has nary a special effect in sight.

849318,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0002XVKLS,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 5]","""The Clearing"" pretty much wastes the energy and talents of three stars with poor editing. I think this is particularly true in the case of Willem Dafoe, an actor who chooses roles that portray what he calls ""conflicted"" characters. There are conflicts a-plenty in his role here but they are reduced to virtual nothingness by poor post production editing.This film is a ""thriller"" about the kidnapping of businessman Robert Redford by former disgruntled employee Dafoe. A subplot develops around Redford's home, where wife Helen Mirren and family are connected to the FBI, who advise her that hubbie's former affair, which she thought ended, is still a lit candle.Mirren is easily the best thing in the movie, portraying a loving wife suddenly cast adrift by the news of her now-kidhapped husband's continuing infidelity. This conflict of unsolvable problem (infidelity) within unsolvable problem (kindapping)is what keeps this flick afloat for 90 minutes or so. It includes a not very effective scene with the ""other"" woman.The rest of the time is wasted on odd looks and stilted dialogue between Dafoe and Redford amidst an incoherent storyline that ends predictably but still has you scratching your head wondering what went on. The reason for this is poor resulting in a disorganized story that rarely is entertaining and is chaotic at the end.Mirren is pretty good in this movie and accepts direction well. Redford...well, he's still a pretty boy. Dafoe is a remarkable actor but poor editing robs his role of any large effect, as his character emerges in one-dimensional, sophomoric detail.There isn't much here that would ever have made this into an instant classic. But as it is, the movie is hardly entertaining after the first 45 minutes and has a completely dissatisfactory ending.

849319,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002XVKLS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 13]","There have been dozens of kidnapping films that have tried to bring something different to that type of film and while director Pieter Jan Brugge does indeed come up with something different with regards to both the style and the substance of ""The Clearing,"" but the former will derail the latter for some viewers.  In a kidnapping story there are two sides to the story, one focusing on the kidnappers and the victim and the other centering on the family dealing with the police and trying to get their loved one back.  What Brugge comes up with stylistically is quite simple, but has some profound implications for his story.  Basically, Brugge comes back and forth between scenes representing each side of the story.  Obviously a film has to cut back and forth between the two sides, but what matters here is that Brugge does so without regards for the actually time line of the film.  When we cut back and forth between the two sides of ""The Clearing"" we are changing not just space but time as well.  Being the family of a kidnap victim is a waiting game, so while that part of the story drags out the other half of the story is moving along at a very brisk pace.  In the end it becomes clear that if all of the scenes were arranged chronologically the film would be divided into two halves and that one part of the story was over before the second even really begins.The man who is kidnapped is Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford), who drives off to work one morning after having breakfast with his wife, Eileen (Helen Mirren) and ends up with a gun pointed at him by Arnold (Willem Dafoe) as they go on a walk through the woods to get to a cabin.  Wayne assumes that the motive is money, but this kidnapping is not going to be that easy, and as he engages Arnold in a series of uneasy conversations we come to a rough understanding of why this is happening.  Meanwhile, it takes Eileen the rest of the day to get to the point where she finally contacts the police.  She assumes Wayne is missing, but when his car is found abandoned someplace it should not be, the worst possibility seems to be the right one.  While Wayne deals with Arnold, Eileen is taking advice from Agent Fuller (Matt Craven) of the F.B.I.  Her children come home for the crisis, but they are tangential except for the fact that they voice the other fear that their mother had during those first hours when she did not know what had happened to her husband: that he might have left her.Wayne had an affair and perhaps it is not over.  If Eileen cannot confront the kidnapper, she can confront her husband's mistress (Wendy Crewson).  That is when it becomes clear that ""The Clearing"" is not about the kidnapping.  Eileen is dealing with a far worse fear than not getting her husband back; she is wondering if she had already lost him before he was kidnapped.  The doubts over her relationship are overwhelming her fears.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the relationship between husband and wife because an integral part of the conversation between Wayne and Arnold as well.  From Brugge's perspective the fate of the relationship is more important than life and death.What ""The Clearing"" is attempting to do is a delicate business.  Perhaps too delicate to truly succeed.  After all, this is a film burdened by the expectations of this genre and in trying to play with those exigencies and constraints he may well give too much of the game away.  But even if you find yourself getting too far ahead, you have to grant that ""The Clearing"" ends on a grace note.

If ""Romeo & Juliet"" were first written today as a new script, most producers would insist that that the lovers live.  If it weren't a historical fact that ""The Titanic"" sank, we'd probably have the boat float to safety.  For those of us who wish to live happily ever after, ""The Clearing"" is not going to be our favorite film.  But it does have a life-affirming quality in that Wayne & Eileen Hayes both discover how deeply and truly they care for each other.This was Pieter Jan Brugge's first project behind the camera as a director.  As a producer, he has brought to screen some incredible dramas including ""Glory"" with Denzel Washington & Morgan Freeman, ""The Pelican Brief"" with Julia Roberts and ""The Insider"" with Russell Crowe.  The construction of the film of seeing sequences through the different viewpoints of the characters is interesting and helps the audience piece together the puzzle of events much as the FBI is trying to do.  Robert Redford was nominated for Oscars for Best Actor for ""The Sting"" in 1973 and for Best Director for ""Quiz Show"" in 1994 and won the Best Director Oscar for ""Ordinary People"" (not a happy ending) in 1980.  His portrayal here is intense.  He shows great range as businessman, husband & hostage.  Helen Mirren is working steadily at an age when many actresses' careers cool off including last year's ""Raising Helen"" and ""Calendar Girls"" in 2003.  She was nominated for Oscars for Best Actress for ""The Madness of King George"" in 1994 and as Best Supporting Actress for her amazing portrayal in ""Gosford Park"" in 2001.  As the wife who works to find her missing husband, she shows great levels of sorrow, joy, regret and finally recovery.  Perhaps the plum acting prize goes to the intense reading of kidnapper Arnold Mack by Willem Dafoe.  Dafoe's career has included a variety of films from ""Spider Man"" to ""The Aviator"" to the two films for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscars, ""Platoon"" (1986) & ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (2001).  Dafoe reaches so many levels as the unhappy husband and professional failure that he is a marvel to watch.  It is with these three recognized actors that Brugge builds a most interesting character study.  The cast rounds out with Diana Scarwid who is also a former Oscar nominee and Matt Craven who has appeared in ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" ""The Life of David Gale"" & ""Dragonfly,"" here as FBI Agent Ray Fuller.  Alessandro Nivola as the Hayes' son puts in a nice appearance, although not quite as memorable as his role as the Brit rocker Ian in ""Laurel Canyon"" with Frances McDormand.As far as the plot, I wondered why Redford's character chose to rest by a tree with his back to the kidnapper rather than checking to see that Dafoe was dead.  Like many Americans, I was pulling for the happy ending up to the last.  But in the end, ""The Clearing"" is memorable for the realization of love that comes to Redford & Mirren, too late to enjoy.",4,Realization of Love,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2982,"['Americans', 'are', 'so', 'addicted', 'happy', 'endings', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'were', 'first', 'written', 'today', 'new', 'script', 'most', 'producers', 'would', 'insist', 'lovers', 'live', 'were', ""n't"", 'historical', 'fact', 'Titanic', 'sank', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'boat', 'float', 'safety', 'who', 'wish', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Clearing', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'have', 'life-affirming', 'quality', 'Wayne', 'Eileen', 'Hayes', 'discover', 'how', 'deeply', 'truly', 'care', 'other.This', 'was', 'Pieter', 'Jan', 'Brugge', 'first', 'project', 'camera', 'director', 'producer', 'brought', 'screen', 'incredible', 'dramas', 'including', 'Glory', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Pelican', 'Brief', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Insider', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'construction', 'film', 'seeing', 'sequences', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'characters', 'interesting', 'audience', 'piece', 'together', 'puzzle', 'events', 'much', 'FBI', 'trying', 'do', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Sting', '1973', 'Best', 'Director', 'Quiz', 'Show', '1994', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'not', 'happy', 'ending', '1980', 'portrayal', 'here', 'intense', 'great', 'range', 'businessman', 'husband', 'hostage', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'working', 'steadily', 'age', 'when', 'many', 'actresses', 'careers', 'cool', 'including', 'last', 'year', 'Raising', 'Helen', 'Calendar', 'Girls', '2003', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', '1994', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'Gosford', 'Park', '2001', 'wife', 'who', 'find', 'missing', 'husband', 'great', 'levels', 'sorrow', 'joy', 'regret', 'finally', 'recovery', 'Perhaps', 'plum', 'acting', 'prize', 'intense', 'reading', 'kidnapper', 'Arnold', 'Mack', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Dafoe', 'career', 'included', 'variety', 'films', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Aviator', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'Platoon', '1986', 'Shadow', 'Vampire', '2001', 'Dafoe', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'unhappy', 'husband', 'professional', 'failure', 'marvel', 'watch', 'three', 'recognized', 'actors', 'Brugge', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'cast', 'out', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'who', 'also', 'former', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'who', 'appeared', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'Dragonfly', 'here', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Ray', 'Fuller', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'Hayes', 'son', 'nice', 'appearance', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'memorable', 'role', 'Brit', 'rocker', 'Ian', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'Frances', 'McDormand.As', 'far', 'plot', 'wondered', 'why', 'Redford', 'character', 'chose', 'rest', 'tree', 'back', 'kidnapper', 'rather', 'checking', 'see', 'Dafoe', 'was', 'dead', 'many', 'Americans', 'was', 'pulling', 'happy', 'ending', 'up', 'last', 'end', 'Clearing', 'memorable', 'realization', 'love', 'Redford', 'Mirren', 'too', 'late', 'enjoy']",The Clearing
849321,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0002XVKLS,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[4, 7]","The perfect performances here by Willem Dafoe, Robert Redford and Helen Mirren are what make this drama work. Dafoe is amazingly good as a nutjob, Arnold Mack, whose kidnap of Wayne Hayes (Redford) is characterized by alternating violence and sympathy, which is what makes this so fascinating. If Dafoe were a one-sided lunatic we would be much more quickly dissociated from this film. But he actually elicits some real empathy in the revelation of the details of his lowly life--his job, his wife, his working class home.Redford as successful executive Wayne Hayes attempts to show Mack (Dafoe) that he used to be in Mack's shoes, that he too was a working class guy who used what he could to pull himself up by his bootstraps.The reason this strikes so close to home, if I may digress here, is that for the last 4 1/2 years, I have not been able to find a full time job. I've made it by temping, doing freelance work, selling stuff on the premier auction website, even doing cassette transcribing. As of this writing (November 2005), I just landed my first full time job in this whole time. My former friend David has also been out of a full time job, for about the same length of time. And he still does not have one. He's supported himself as well with freelance and consulting work, but now it's taken the form of backbreaking manual work (carpentry) which on one hand he likes to do but on the other is extremely strenuous for someone his age (we're both in our 50s). Every time I talk to him he complains bitterly.Would he kidnap me? No. But the parallel is there. Being out of work--or being severly underemployed--for a very long time changes you. A lot. You know you're smart, but you just can't get a job. You get laid off from a good job and then the world is so totally different that you don't know how to handle it. Some people persevere. Others freak out. Dafoe is in the second category.Helen Mirren is here as Hayes' wife and she is also superb. The balance of her reserve with intense emotion is absolutely flawless. What does a wife do if her husband is kidnapped? Hope. She's impeccable. She nails it. She knows how to do this the way it should be done.We don't have to pay much attention to the actors playing the two adult children of the couple (who are in their late 50s, early 60s) because they are not the center of this drama. They're admittedly not great in their roles; their roles are themselves not substantial. They're not the point; they're here because they need to be here to lend more depth to the Hayes' marriage, and that's the only reason for the existence of these two young adults.The only real flaw I found, and it is not necessarily a big one, was that there should have been somewhat more time spent on Mack's homelife. There was some, but not enough. The balance of the Hayes' homelife with the Mack's was definitely lopsided.But other than that, this was a great film--riveting because of the three leads.

849322,A1H3ZATBDMOJ6Z,B0002XVKLS,Louis Barbarelli,"[12, 25]","The whole plot of this movie can be summed up as follows: penniless guy kidnaps rich guy and penniless guy either kills or doesn't kill the rich guy (I won't spoil it for you by revealing which).  That's really all there is to it. It's not a story at all, it's a collection of scenes, most of them pretty dull.Like ""Memento"" and ""21 Grams,"" this movie plays tricks with time: the scenes involving the wife don't run parallel in time to the scenes involving the husband.  Presumably, the director did this to make a flat movie more interesting, but it didn't work.  Presenting scenes out-of-synch is becoming trendy in Hollywood.  I think the technique is already getting tired and is just ""artsy fartsy,"" copy-cat nonsense that can't put a story there when no story exists to begin with.Of the three principal performances, only Dafoe's is interesting and well-crafted.  He out-classes the film and his fellow cast members.  But, in the end, even his performance is sunk by the lack of good lines: the interplay between he and Redford during their interminable trek in the woods is a marvel of B-movie banality.  Mirren sleepwalks through her role.  Redford seems to have had plastic surgery around the eyes.  Whatever the extent of the surgery, it has limited his ability to register normal facial expressions.  Just what an actor needs to enhance his perfomance.  On top of that, he still looks old and worn out despite the surgery.  His performance mirrors the way he looks: tired.The actors who play Reford's grown children are totally unconvincing.  The guy who plays the son overacts embarassingly in certain scenes; it's as though he's determined to make this minor part vault him into a great Hollywood career.  Only a bad director lets that happen.  Note that the movie's director has no prior experience as a director, only as a producer.A scene that Roger Ebert loved, involving Helen Mirren's confrontation with her husband's elicit girlfriend, just doesn't ring true.  In real life, the girlfriend would have refused to answer the wife's intimate questions and would have simply told her to go to hell.  This ""affair subplot,"" by the way, leads nowhere and contributes nothing to our understanding of the Redford character or his marriage.Another problem is characters behaving in inappropriate ways, which may have been a sloppy way of creating false ""suspects"" in the minds of the audience.  Even if you mentally correct for the non-parallel time lines, you still have odd situations like Redford's wife and daughter cavorting in the pool, having birthday parties, or playing with their dog... all while knowing that Redford is in mortal danger.Overall, this was dull, sloppy and surprisingly devoid of plot.

849323,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0002XVKLS,"Maine Writer ""David""","[5, 8]","I'd heard nothing about The Clearing, which is rare for movies nowadays.  Maybe it wasn't advertised much; I'd never seen a trailer.The Clearing grabbed me quickly, with nice performances from its stars, particularly Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren, and a provocative opening.  Redford, a rich man in a sanitized life, goes missing.  Has he run away?  Has he been kidnapped?  It's a formidable hook, and it plays out well as we are drawn into what appears to be a complicated plot involving an organization that has turned abduction into an art.  Along the way, we get some powerful insights into modern life and marriage, about the paths that lives can take, and about the power of alienation, anger, and selfishness.Redford's character is an arrogant, self-absorbed businessman whose life appears to revolve around navel-inspecting about whether he is ""in love,"" whether he loves his wife, and his lack of attention to his children (who come across as flawed, narcissistic and sad).  His wife, played by Mirren, is a nice spin on the wife who looks the other way, as long as her lifestyle is maintained.  There's a nice sadness to the performance, underscoring the likelihood that those who've accepted comfort and luxury over love and meaning are just as likely to be mired in quiet emptiness and anomie.  Mirren has a great line after a dinner with friends.  When she's complemented on the marvellous dinner, she casually says that she had nothing to do with it.  The guests take it as self-effacing -- but she's being brutally honest.  All that she's done is a careful choreographing of the hired help.  This is no great personal act or sacrifice, no act of love or creativity meant to celebrate friends or family.  It's just empty gesturing.Dafoe's character is one of those guys who doesn't do well with capitalism.  His lack of drive and energy punctuates his every move and comment; he is soft, sad, and lost in a world where he doesn't connect.  He's not ""the person to watch"" in the corporate hierarchy.  And so, he ends up losing his job after 17 years, completely oblivious to any role he might have had in his fate.  He and his wife know live with her parents, and he must cope with his having failed in the promise he made to himself and to her ... to be a ""success.""  We never really know the extent of her disappoinment, if it exists at all.  She might not care.  But we see his own disappointment, having reached a place in life where he is an invisible man -- unimportant, irrelevant.There's a lot of depth here, in other words.  But as in so many  movies, it is killed by a mediocre ending -- and a silling final scene so burdened with dissonant sentimentality that it must have been patched on after a screening that went bad.  Dafoe's character behaves in ways that are completely inconsistent with what came before, and the conclusion grounds an otherwise enticing drama in a mediocre wrapping up of complex issues.  The ultimate disappointment is that there are so many better places this film could have gone that it is ultimately a failure.  Savor the acting and dialogue through about two-thirds of the film, and then be prepared for disappointment.Barely a 3 ... for trying.",3,Is a good ending too much to ask?,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,3200,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'nothing', 'Clearing', 'rare', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'advertised', 'much', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'trailer.The', 'Clearing', 'grabbed', 'quickly', 'nice', 'performances', 'stars', 'particularly', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'provocative', 'opening', 'Redford', 'rich', 'man', 'sanitized', 'life', 'missing', 'run', 'away', 'Has', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'formidable', 'hook', 'out', 'well', 'are', 'drawn', 'what', 'be', 'complicated', 'plot', 'involving', 'organization', 'turned', 'abduction', 'art', 'way', 'get', 'powerful', 'insights', 'modern', 'life', 'marriage', 'paths', 'can', 'take', 'power', 'alienation', 'anger', 'selfishness.Redford', 'character', 'arrogant', 'self-absorbed', 'businessman', 'life', 'revolve', 'navel-inspecting', 'love', 'wife', 'lack', 'attention', 'children', 'who', 'come', 'flawed', 'narcissistic', 'sad', 'wife', 'played', 'Mirren', 'nice', 'spin', 'wife', 'who', 'other', 'way', 'as', 'long', 'lifestyle', 'maintained', 'nice', 'sadness', 'performance', 'underscoring', 'likelihood', 'who', ""'ve"", 'accepted', 'comfort', 'luxury', 'love', 'meaning', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'be', 'mired', 'quiet', 'emptiness', 'anomie', 'Mirren', 'great', 'line', 'dinner', 'friends', 'When', 'complemented', 'marvellous', 'dinner', 'casually', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'guests', 'take', 'self-effacing', 'being', 'brutally', 'honest', 'done', 'careful', 'choreographing', 'hired', 'help', 'great', 'personal', 'act', 'sacrifice', 'act', 'love', 'creativity', 'meant', 'celebrate', 'friends', 'family', 'just', 'empty', 'gesturing.Dafoe', 'character', 'one', 'guys', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'capitalism', 'lack', 'drive', 'energy', 'punctuates', 'move', 'comment', 'soft', 'sad', 'lost', 'world', 'where', ""n't"", 'connect', 'not', 'person', 'watch', 'corporate', 'hierarchy', 'so', 'up', 'losing', 'job', '17', 'years', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'fate', 'wife', 'know', 'live', 'parents', 'must', 'cope', 'having', 'failed', 'promise', 'made', 'be', 'success', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'extent', 'disappoinment', 'might', 'not', 'care', 'see', 'own', 'disappointment', 'having', 'reached', 'place', 'life', 'where', 'invisible', 'man', 'unimportant', 'lot', 'depth', 'here', 'other', 'words', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'killed', 'mediocre', 'ending', 'silling', 'final', 'scene', 'so', 'burdened', 'dissonant', 'sentimentality', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'patched', 'screening', 'went', 'bad', 'Dafoe', 'character', 'behaves', 'ways', 'are', 'completely', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'conclusion', 'otherwise', 'enticing', 'drama', 'mediocre', 'wrapping', 'complex', 'issues', 'ultimate', 'disappointment', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'places', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'ultimately', 'failure', 'Savor', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'disappointment.Barely', '3', 'trying']",The Clearing

It is a short, skillfully choreographed production with clever editing and compelling storytelling. Redford plays a wealthy businessman who just sold his business and lives a comfortable lifestyle in Pittsburgh. His stately, yet wonderfully human wife is played by Helen Mirren in yet, one more of her classic roles. Willem Dafoe is the kidnapper, a disgruntled former employee stuck in a dismal, miserable home life. Brugge tells the story with two ongoing narratives, flashing back and forth between Redford and Dafoe and Mirren with the family and the FBI. Redford and Dafoe are at their vulnerable, but desperately strong best and Dafoe's final intent is not fully clear. Mirren excels as the strong wife who can comfort her family and yet still rationally speak with Redford's girlfriend from an affair she thought was over. Mirren is subtle, mesmerizing and incredibly convincing. Her eyes show her feelings so well, she need barely move her face to convey emotion. Although simple in context (it is based on a true story from Holland), the movie keeps one fascinated by the interplay of the characters and the intensely fine acting.

849331,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002XVKLS,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""The Clearing"" is a quiet, yet exceptionally vivid, character drama that revolves around a kidnapping story. Wayne and Eileen Hayes are an affluent couple with 2 grown children. One morning Wayne (Robert Redford) is kidnapped by a man named Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe) and held for ransom. FBI Agent Ray Fuller (Matt Craven) is assigned to the case. Eileen (Helen Mirren) is willing to do whatever it takes to facilitate her husband's safe return. It all seems almost routine. Indeed, it is a routine for Agent Fuller and Arnold Mack. But there is nothing commonplace or even predictable about ""The Clearing"".What strikes me the most about this film is its sharpness. ""The Clearing"" is meticulously photographed and edited. The story is brought to life by conversations between the characters. This is the rare kidnapping story in which the characters are reasonably intelligent people, who act just as those people would under those circumstances. The sharp, thoughtful dialogue that moves the story forward is perfectly suited to this cast of talented actors. In some ways, ""The Clearing"" is a comment on marital relationships as much as it is an observation of character. The words and emotions expressed by Wayne, Eileen, Arnold and Agent Fuller tend to revolve around their relationships with their spouses. The subtle but multi-dimensional character writing and well-crafted dialogue make ""The Clearing"" seem as if it were based on a novel. I was surprised to find that it wasn't, which is a compliment to writer Justin Haythe.I appreciate ""The Clearing""'s method of drawing the audience into the story. At first we see only Eileen's experience. She expects her husband to come home from work. When he doesn't, we don't know any more than she does. Wayne has simply disappeared. Most of the story plays out in the Hayes home and in the woods where Arnold in holding Wayne. The limited locations are effective in concentrating attention on the emotions and demeanor of the characters. For a kidnapping story, ""The Clearing"" has very few thrills, and those are of an emotional nature. It comes late in the film, but I found the tension very affecting.  Note that there are two separate timelines that we see simultaneously, but which are not actually happening simultaneously. They overlap. At first, I thought this was a continuity problem. But it eventually becomes obvious why the story is told that way.I was thoroughly impressed by every aspect of ""The Clearing"": writing, cinematography, editing, acting, directing. There is simply no sloppiness or clutter in this film. Fans of character studies or of these great actors will not want to miss it.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary, 6 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, and the film's entire screenplay -which is a little difficult to read, as it is white text on a black background. Black on white may be blah, but it's infinitely more legible. The audio commentary is by director Pieter Jan Brugge, screenwriter Justin Haythe, and editor Kevin Tent. It is an interesting, but very low-key, discussion of the narrative, editing, and shooting decisions that they made during filming. These 3 men impress me as having straightforward but introverted personalities, which are reflected in the film. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish.

Alas, how wrong I was.It's true, the performances are terrific, from Redford, from Willem Dafoe and especially from Helen Mirren - however, they are let down by a story that goes nowhere, and goes nowhere with no sense of style.The plot has two strands - on one hand, we follow Robert Redford the rich businessman who is married and only now finally finding time for his kids, as he is kidnapped by Dafoe, with no apparent motive. As Dafoe marches his captive to the eponymous clearing, they talk, and we learn more about both their lives as a result.Meanwhile, the FBI have moved in with his wife and kids, and as they investigate, we see the same family skeletons revealed from this other perspective. Displaying this flawed marriage of modern America seems to be the whole point of the movie, as the kidnapping is never truly explained, and the resolution is an empty one.To make matters worse, the director intercuts the two stories, even though they happen in completely different timeframes. This does not help the story at all, other than to give a clue how it is all going to end.What a shame to see such terrific performers in such an underwhelming and seemingly pointless movie.

It is, in other words, my favorite kind of movie--one that you have to stew and puzzle over later ... and yet, the less-than-completely-favorable reviews (even some of the more vitriolic) make sense, sort of.The problem, I think, is that this movie doesn't pick a style or an audience; it never decides whether it wants to be a plot-driven genre picture or a character-driven psychological drama.  Maybe it aims to be both, but if so it doesn't succeed.  And this seems like more of pity than an inevitability: I think this film could have included more twists, more ""plot points,"" more astounding turns of events, without sacrificing its intelligent dialogue, character development, or its intiguing, important themes.Basically, I think this film could have been perfect, and I cried more for this lost opportunity than I did over the ending, however moving.In any event, Robert Redford and Helen Mirren (I *love* the Helen Mirren!!!) certainly deserve the perfect script if ever one could be written.

Dafoe is good as the kidnapper, giving us sympathy for his slightly obviously written role.  Redford, never much of an actor, is adequate but mostly coasts between wooden and glib.

If you're looking for a wham bam thriller, this is not for you. The sets are sparse, the acting subdued. Even Craig Armstrong's score is light-jazzy, ominous.The narrative crosscuts between two plotlines, one the abduction of a rich entrepreuneur by a former employee, and the other of his family coming to terms with this situation and their lives.Truth be told, the film has over half a dozen genuinely tense moments that set it up like a compelling thriller gussied up in psychological and emotional trappings.Sadly, the script is slight and simply lacks enough points of intersection for the parallel-plot gimmick to work. Too few twists of cause and effect, too few events to piece together, questions to answer, or mysteries to solve.The motives and methods of the kidnapper seem borderline laughable when I think back about the film.

Still, even the most careful  study of each twitch and raised eyebrow does not adequately flesh out the characters before the film draws to a close. Despite the cast's herculean effort to pull a substantive back-story from the spartan script the film fails to fully connect.Ultimately the film is worth a watch just to see 3 fantastic actors at work, but the taken in it's entirety the film falls short.

849348,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002XVKLS,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","My three star rating is strictly based on three amazing actors -- Robert Redford, Willem Defoe, and most of all Helen Mirren.  That's it, they show great acting skills, and that's all there to it.  The first-time director Pieter Jan Brugge (so far known as successful producer of 'The Insider' and others) makes a  worthy attempt, but the sleepy audiences would be left wondering what if a better, faster, and less talky script would have made the film.  Probably, better and more accesible to us.In fact, the slow and slim story is not a bad thing.  'The Clearing' introduces us the peaceful, suburban morning and the ordinary husband Redford and his wife Mirren.  One of them is kidnapped by another ordinary American Defoe, and the film follows the two dimentions of the crime -- the victim's family that wait for the news, and the kidnapper's ever-changing relations with the victim.So, this is not a thriller, even though it involves a kidnap situation.  Moreover, the film tries to be very intelligent, or some might call, awfully talky.  But the real problem, I think, is the lack of power or originality in the dialogues.Surely, you are to face many questions of life after experiencing this kind of criminal act, that's true.  But the film never raises any really morally or ethically intriguing questions through the long dialogues exchanged between the characters.  And haven't we seen better-crafted films based on the similar premises?  How about the first part of 'The Crying Game'?  But here, you don't see the painfully realistic feelings of Neil Jordan film.But the acting is just fabulous, especially Helen Mirren, who changes her character's mood so naturally that we are led to believe that she is that character.  Surprisingly Robert Redford shows a more complex side than his one-dimentional role like 'Sneakers' in which he acted while sleeping, and he is very effective.  And thank God, Willem Defoe does not overact -- which means he is not the same as the ultra hammy villain 'Speed 2' -- and when he subdues his manners, he is as good as William H Macy, who was in a much superior film with kidnap theme, whose name is 'Fargo.'",3,"Three Great Acting, But the Film Talks, Talks, Talks",1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,2154,"['three', 'star', 'rating', 'strictly', 'based', 'three', 'amazing', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'most', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'show', 'great', 'acting', 'skills', 'there', 'first-time', 'director', 'Pieter', 'Jan', 'Brugge', 'so', 'far', 'known', 'successful', 'producer', ""'The"", 'Insider', 'others', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'sleepy', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'better', 'faster', 'less', 'talky', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'Probably', 'better', 'more', 'accesible', 'us.In', 'fact', 'slow', 'slim', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""'The"", 'Clearing', 'introduces', 'peaceful', 'suburban', 'morning', 'ordinary', 'husband', 'Redford', 'wife', 'Mirren', 'One', 'kidnapped', 'ordinary', 'American', 'Defoe', 'film', 'two', 'dimentions', 'crime', 'victim', 'family', 'wait', 'news', 'kidnapper', 'ever-changing', 'relations', 'victim.So', 'not', 'thriller', 'even', 'kidnap', 'situation', 'Moreover', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'very', 'intelligent', 'might', 'call', 'awfully', 'talky', 'real', 'problem', 'think', 'lack', 'power', 'originality', 'dialogues.Surely', 'are', 'face', 'many', 'questions', 'life', 'experiencing', 'kind', 'criminal', 'act', 'true', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'morally', 'ethically', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'long', 'dialogues', 'exchanged', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'better-crafted', 'films', 'based', 'similar', 'premises', 'How', 'first', 'part', ""'The"", 'Crying', 'Game', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'painfully', 'realistic', 'feelings', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'film.But', 'acting', 'just', 'fabulous', 'especially', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'character', 'mood', 'so', 'naturally', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'character', 'Surprisingly', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'more', 'complex', 'side', 'one-dimentional', 'role', ""'Sneakers"", 'acted', 'sleeping', 'very', 'effective', 'thank', 'God', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'not', 'overact', 'not', 'same', 'ultra', 'hammy', 'villain', '2', 'when', 'manners', 'as', 'good', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'superior', 'film', 'kidnap', 'theme', 'name']",The Clearing
849349,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0002XVKLS,Tucker Andersen,"[22, 25]","This is an intense drama which examines the impact of a kidnapping on the three main participants in the drama; Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford), a driven executive who has become a multimillionaire by selling the business which he founded; his wife Eileen (Helen Mirren), who shares their luxurious estate but who was deeply wounded years ago by an affair which she now learns has not ended, and Arnold Mack (William DaFoe), a menacing yet vulnerable kidnapper who hopes to begin a new chapter in his disappointing life. It is directed with great attention to detail; while there are occasionally scenes of intense action, most are very brief except for the one involving the payment of the eventual ransom demand. The performances of the three co-stars in this film allow them to exhibit their talent for dramatic expression which has made them recognizable to all fans of serious drama; if strong performances and a well crafted film by themselves are sufficient criteria for you to attend a movie, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this film a great deal more than I did. The most interesting technique involved the juxtaposition of the two elements of the storyline. After the opening scene we were alternately shown the interaction between DaFoe and Redford during Redford's forced march to the cabin in THE CLEARING in the woods and his wife and family's reactions as events unfolded. Their helplessness intensified as the kidnapper seemed able to continually avoid all attempts by the FBI to entrap him; meanwhile the conversations between the victim and his abductor were riveting at times. (My rating for these aspects of this movie would be well over four stars.)However, the story seemed interminable to me. I looked at my watch as we left the theater and was amazed that the running time was only ninety minutes, it had seemed well over two hours. The plot is extremely simple, the characters' interactions and the examinations of the choices which have led to their current situation is not the backdrop to the story, it is the story. This film seems to be a tribute to the minimalist tradition; while spare dialog and a tendency towards understatement often allow a glance or a gesture to more effectively impart meaning and create a mood than the chatter which passes for sensible conversation in many films, the director's approach (and script) left me with many questions and a feeling of incompleteness at several points during the film. And while the conclusion was certainly consistent with the storyline, I found it somewhat abrupt (admittedly the effect was quite profound) and disappointing. Thus, my rating of the plot is a generous two stars and my overall rating of three stars is a compromise between my admiration for the film's technical virtuosity and my lack of enjoyment of the story.As the reviews to date indicate, this film engenders widely differing reactions among viewers. My wife enjoyed it substantially more than I did, and she would have given it a higher rating than I have. Therefore, I have tried to present the positive and negative aspects in an attempt to provide sufficient perspective allow individuals to decide for themselves whether it is the sort of film which they might enjoy. My final caveat is to pay attention to the disparate timelines in the two alternating narrative sequences. It is a very clever technique whose impact I did not fully appreciate until the conclusion of the movie.Tucker Andersen",3,"A Psychological Study, Not Action Thriller",1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,3454,"['intense', 'drama', 'impact', 'kidnapping', 'three', 'main', 'participants', 'drama', 'Wayne', 'Hayes', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'driven', 'executive', 'who', 'become', 'multimillionaire', 'selling', 'business', 'founded', 'wife', 'Eileen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'shares', 'luxurious', 'estate', 'who', 'was', 'deeply', 'wounded', 'years', 'ago', 'affair', 'now', 'not', 'ended', 'Arnold', 'Mack', 'William', 'DaFoe', 'menacing', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'begin', 'new', 'chapter', 'disappointing', 'life', 'directed', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'occasionally', 'scenes', 'intense', 'action', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'one', 'involving', 'payment', 'eventual', 'ransom', 'demand', 'performances', 'three', 'co-stars', 'film', 'allow', 'exhibit', 'talent', 'dramatic', 'expression', 'made', 'recognizable', 'fans', 'serious', 'drama', 'strong', 'performances', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'are', 'sufficient', 'criteria', 'attend', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'did', 'most', 'interesting', 'technique', 'involved', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'elements', 'storyline', 'opening', 'scene', 'were', 'alternately', 'shown', 'interaction', 'DaFoe', 'Redford', 'Redford', 'forced', 'march', 'cabin', 'THE', 'CLEARING', 'woods', 'wife', 'family', 'reactions', 'events', 'unfolded', 'helplessness', 'intensified', 'kidnapper', 'seemed', 'able', 'continually', 'avoid', 'attempts', 'FBI', 'entrap', 'meanwhile', 'conversations', 'victim', 'abductor', 'were', 'riveting', 'times', 'rating', 'aspects', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'four', 'stars', 'However', 'story', 'seemed', 'interminable', 'looked', 'watch', 'left', 'theater', 'was', 'amazed', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'had', 'seemed', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'plot', 'extremely', 'simple', 'characters', 'interactions', 'examinations', 'choices', 'have', 'led', 'current', 'situation', 'not', 'backdrop', 'story', 'story', 'film', 'be', 'tribute', 'minimalist', 'tradition', 'spare', 'dialog', 'tendency', 'understatement', 'often', 'allow', 'glance', 'gesture', 'more', 'effectively', 'impart', 'meaning', 'create', 'mood', 'chatter', 'sensible', 'conversation', 'many', 'films', 'director', 'approach', 'script', 'left', 'many', 'questions', 'feeling', 'incompleteness', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'conclusion', 'was', 'certainly', 'consistent', 'storyline', 'found', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'admittedly', 'effect', 'was', 'quite', 'profound', 'disappointing', 'Thus', 'rating', 'plot', 'generous', 'two', 'stars', 'overall', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', 'compromise', 'admiration', 'film', 'technical', 'virtuosity', 'lack', 'enjoyment', 'story.As', 'reviews', 'date', 'indicate', 'film', 'widely', 'differing', 'reactions', 'viewers', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'substantially', 'more', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'rating', 'have', 'Therefore', 'have', 'tried', 'present', 'positive', 'negative', 'aspects', 'attempt', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'perspective', 'allow', 'individuals', 'decide', 'sort', 'film', 'might', 'enjoy', 'My', 'final', 'caveat', 'pay', 'attention', 'disparate', 'timelines', 'two', 'alternating', 'narrative', 'sequences', 'very', 'clever', 'technique', 'impact', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'conclusion', 'movie.Tucker', 'Andersen']",The Clearing
849350,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B0002XVKLS,Unlucky Frank,"[4, 7]","Some critics gave raves for this. Especially, those juggleheads on ABC. I love Redford and Dafoe. So I watched it on cable. The movie bills itself as a suspense thriller. Yeah, this was about as thrilling as watching my grandma knitting a kidnapper's hood. I wish she would have knitted me a hood and thrown it over my head so I wouldn't have had to watch this mess. Meandering story, inane timeline, rotten dialogue, some bad acting, and the worst denouement I've ever seen in a thriller. THIS IS A FORGIVENESS STORY DISGUISED AS A THRILLER. Which is unfair to the audience it's catering to. The ending is so bad it should be shown in screenwriting classes as an example of how NOT to end a suspense film. It's extremely unsatisfying. It reminded me of the sceenwriting taboo ""and then he woke up."" I GIVE AWAY THE ENDING BELOW because the screenwriter deserves it. So SKIP THIS REVIEW if you want to see this. Okay, but you'll be sorry.WARNING MAJOR SPOILER:A buddy of mine showed up at my house when this started and together we had fun picking this film apart and rewriting it the way it should have been written. And believe me, it's the only fun we had watching this stinker. All you need to know is that Dafoe kidnaps Redford and Redford's wife, Helen Mirren calls the FBI. We never understand Dafoe's motive. Hardly anything in the script reveals who he is or his psychology. Redford, the millionaire victim, guesses some things about him. But, they are not used in any way as an arc in the story. All we know is that Dafoe is a disgruntled ex-employee. Dafoe supposedly has employers who have paid him to bring Redford to a cabin in the woods where they await his arrival and will contact his wife for the ransom. We couldn't wait until they got to this mysterious cabin in the woods. This doesn't happen as Dafoe is making it up. The film might have been very interesting if there were unknown business rivals or someone seeking revenge as kidnappers who have a grudge against Redford. If this had been FILM NOIR from the 40s or 50s, that's where the script would have taken us. I kept thinking maybe something bad will be revealed about Redford's past and he'll turn out to be a villain too. It would have been a great place to take the story. But, Dafoe is acting alone. Redford also uses psychology on Dafoe which goes nowhere. He tries to turn Dafoe against his employers. But, there are no employers. My friend and I figured it would be used to turn Dafoe against his ""so-called"" employers in a way that would reveal how fiendish Redford really is. We figured in a twist of circumstances, by the end of the film, Dafoe would be charmed into working for Redford, who turns out to be a villainous millionaire. That's where I would have taken the story.The meandering subplot, which turns out to be the main plot, is about Redford's wife, who finds out Redford is having an affair when it's revealed to her by the FBI man staying at the house. Then we pondered, maybe she knew it all along and is having an affair too. Maybe with Dafoe or someone else. And she's going to kill him for his money. Another interesting way to take the story. But, no. After watching the first hour, I said to my friend, ""Nothing much is going to happen, this movie is not that clever."" Oh, how right I was. After reminiscing with the kids and meeting the other woman, Mirren is going to pay the kidnappers. I guess it's Dafoe. I thought it was some other guy, but the timeline, which is meant to be clever, is confusing. He calls her on a payphone because the FBI is watching. Wouldn't happen. You can't place incoming calls to payphones anymore. Dafoe gets the money because Mirren shakes the FBI tail. Sure she does.Flashback to the woods. Redford wrestles with Dafoe for the gun. The gun goes flying and Redford has a chance to strangle Dafoe. Here's a guy who knows he'll be killed, but he just can't do it. Instead he hugs a tree in distress. My friend blurts out, ""Treehugger!!"" Dafoe retrieves the gun and reveals to Redford that there are no employers. He shoots Redford. Redford dies. Flash forward and Dafoe mails a note that Redford previously asked Dafoe to mail to his wife. Dafoe starts spending the marked bills. Some guy at a drugstore is checking the serial numbers while Dafoe is still in the store. Yeah, sure. Everytime I go into a store and pass a 100 bill the manager always checks it for serial numbers on FBI lists. I don't think so. They catch Dafoe and he confesses. Later Mirren receives the note. It says, ""As long as you love me, I have everything I need."" She smiles as Redford's ghost walks in the room and says the same thing to her that's in the note. He fades away. She forgives him. The end. I'm not kidding. We both groaned on cue. Ohhhhhhh..... THIS IS A ROTTEN SCRIPT!!Come on, Redford. Were you high when you read this? Audiences are pretty sophisticated nowadays. Okay, maybe not. This could have gone any of the ways I suggested and been GREAT FILM NOIR. Instead, it's just a forgiveness story disguised as a thiller. What the...? I cry FOUL!!

849352,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0002XVKLS,V. Marshall,"[4, 7]","This film has a great cast but for lovers of intrigue and murder mysteries I have to say this movie fell short on explanation.Robert Redford plays a retired but very successful businessman who leaves his home one morning and finds himself in quite a predicament. His wife, Helen Mirren, reports him missing once he fails to turn up for a dinner party. William Dafoe becomes Redford's new partner in the film and through a series of revelations on the past it becomes apparent that Redford isn't exactly on the up and up, but neither is Dafoe and as the movie progresses I began to wonder about Mirren as well. Eventually most of the story is revealed and it all makes sense but unfortunately all of the suspense was for nothing....the movie explains itself within the first 10 minutes and all of the usual suspects need not even be suspected after all!The cast in this film is wonderful and their superb acting cannot be faulted. Robert Redford and Helen Mirren are great as a couple that has grown to understand one another after many years of respectful marriage. Of course Willem Dafoe is absolutely convincing as the floundering failure in this film. Two stories take place simultaneously with the director weaving in and out of both stories sometimes to a point of confusion. But the real treat of this film is not with the direction, or the story, but instead lies entirely in the brilliance of the actors and their subdued performances against the backdrop of an unclear case.",3,Not Quite So Clear,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,1483,"['film', 'great', 'cast', 'lovers', 'intrigue', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'fell', 'short', 'explanation.Robert', 'Redford', 'retired', 'very', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'home', 'one', 'morning', 'quite', 'predicament', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'missing', 'once', 'turn', 'up', 'dinner', 'party', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'Redford', 'new', 'partner', 'film', 'series', 'revelations', 'past', 'apparent', 'Redford', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'up', 'up', 'Dafoe', 'movie', 'began', 'wonder', 'about', 'Mirren', 'as', 'well', 'Eventually', 'most', 'story', 'revealed', 'sense', 'unfortunately', 'suspense', 'was', 'nothing', '.the', 'movie', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'usual', 'suspects', 'need', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'suspected', 'cast', 'film', 'wonderful', 'superb', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'are', 'great', 'couple', 'grown', 'understand', 'one', 'many', 'years', 'respectful', 'marriage', 'course', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'floundering', 'failure', 'film', 'Two', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'simultaneously', 'director', 'weaving', 'stories', 'sometimes', 'point', 'confusion', 'real', 'treat', 'film', 'not', 'direction', 'story', 'instead', 'entirely', 'brilliance', 'actors', 'subdued', 'performances', 'backdrop', 'unclear', 'case']",The Clearing
849353,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B0002XVKLS,Wisconsin Dad,"[16, 17]","The Clearing is a story of a couple, Wayne (played by Robert Redford) and Eileen (Helen Mirrem), who are in the golden stages of there marriage when Wayne is kidnapped.Wayne is a successful business man who has nice adult children, a gorgeous home, a nice car and a mistress. Wayne exits his home one day, only to be kidnapped by Arnold Mack (played by Willem Dafoe). It is here that the story begins.The Clearing really isn't a kidnapping movie so much as it is a story about Wayne and Eileen. It moves along at a comfortable pace, but is by no means an intense thriller or action motion. This is not a bad thing.The story is fresh, the acting well above average, and the interaction between the characters is pleasant to watch. Overall, the only flaw in the movie is that we really don't get a taste for Wayne and Eileen's relationship to the depth that is needed. They are rarely on screen together. Thus, there is a tension that is missing, because our hearts aren't sold on their love for one another. This leaves the movie a little flat, but still good.This is an enjoyable movie, but not one most people will rush out to buy.I want to address comments made by critics of the film; something I don't normally do but feel the need to here.Some have criticized the movie for having 2 separate time lines. One reviewer called it artsy-fartsy. The Clearing plays no artsy tricks, nor tries to confuse you in the name of making ""cool art."" There are two separate time lines. We see Eileen as she finds out about Wayne's kidnapping, and the subsequent interactions she has with her family. Then, whenever we see Wayne and Arnold Mack, we move slightly back in time. The movie gently reveals what happened to Wayne. No tricks. No confusion at all. Very easy to follow, and doesn't come of as a gimmick in the least.Another critic said there were way too many closeups. I don't recall one. Films like the Brown Bunny are filled with dramatic closeups of facial features, drawing attention to the filmmaker at times. The Clearing has none of that. The camera work is soft, unnoticeable, and the movie was not cluttered with closeups.Many don't like the Clearing because it isn't an action thriller. It isn't. It is a story of primarily 3 people. It is told well, and there are no plot gimmicks. The acting is superb, and the story comes across as authentic. Those who want a heart pounding thriller will be disappointed.Another critic said the ending was horrible. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the end. Again, there are no gimmicks and no cliff hangers. The kidnapping is resolved, and there is story closure for all 3 main characters. We know why Wayne was kidnapped, and the outcome of the kidnapping. I enjoyed the ending.This was a good film that could have been great if Wayne and Eileen would have been sewn deeper into our hearts. It is also a film that  don't think resonates well with people who have never made it to the 10 year mark in there marriage.Total Score (out of 100) = 6131 (out of 50). Enjoyment.
