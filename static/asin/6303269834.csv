367648,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,6303269834,A Customer,"[15, 16]","&quot;The Client&quot; is a movie that profiled the American Justice system drenched with beaurocracy, and the particular story of a young child and his family caught up in it. An 11 year old backwoods punk kid named Mark Sway (Newly introduced Brad Renfro), is a witness to the suicide of a lawyer involved in a high profile Mafia case. Being the only witness, he is now pressured by the US Attorney's office to talk...and by the Mob not to. US Attorney Roy Fortrigg is played flawlessly as always by award winning actor Tommy Lee Jones, who battles Mark's dedicated lawyer (Susan Sarandon) to make the boy tell all and vault himself to Governor of Louisianna. If I was making this movie, I would think that it would fall apart on the child's role...but it didnt. Brad Renfro was as good as they come, playing a stubborn punk kid who refused to be intimidated by Fortrigg, and tried not to let the Mob get to him either. Another stellar performance was played by Kim Coates, one of the big Mob boss's henchmen. After seeing &quot;The Client&quot; I checked out a few other of his roles...needless to say they were mostly the &quot;bad guy&quot; parts. The movie was gripping in every sense with suspense, action and hardball legal dialogue that trully capture the reality of a high-profile criminal justice case. From start to finish I enjoyed the movie very much and cant turn it off to this day if I flip by it on television. I think &quot;The Client&quot; is a great purchase idea...and again I dont recommend the book.",5,Excellent Movie From a Terrible Book,985824000,"03 29, 2001",2001,1523,"['quot', 'Client', 'quot', 'movie', 'profiled', 'American', 'Justice', 'system', 'drenched', 'beaurocracy', 'particular', 'story', 'young', 'child', 'family', 'caught', 'up', '11', 'year', 'old', 'backwoods', 'punk', 'kid', 'named', 'Mark', 'Sway', 'Newly', 'introduced', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'witness', 'suicide', 'lawyer', 'involved', 'high', 'profile', 'Mafia', 'case', 'Being', 'only', 'witness', 'now', 'pressured', 'US', 'Attorney', 'office', 'talk', 'Mob', 'not', 'US', 'Attorney', 'Roy', 'Fortrigg', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'always', 'award', 'winning', 'actor', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'Mark', 'dedicated', 'lawyer', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'make', 'boy', 'tell', 'vault', 'Governor', 'Louisianna', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'fall', 'apart', 'child', 'role', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'come', 'playing', 'stubborn', 'punk', 'kid', 'who', 'refused', 'be', 'intimidated', 'Fortrigg', 'tried', 'not', 'let', 'Mob', 'get', 'either', 'stellar', 'performance', 'was', 'played', 'Kim', 'Coates', 'one', 'big', 'Mob', 'boss', 'henchmen', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Client', 'quot', 'checked', 'out', 'few', 'other', 'roles', 'needless', 'say', 'were', 'mostly', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'parts', 'movie', 'was', 'gripping', 'sense', 'suspense', 'action', 'hardball', 'legal', 'dialogue', 'trully', 'capture', 'reality', 'high-profile', 'criminal', 'justice', 'case', 'start', 'finish', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'cant', 'turn', 'off', 'day', 'flip', 'television', 'think', 'quot', 'Client', 'quot', 'great', 'purchase', 'idea', 'again', 'dont', 'recommend', 'book']",The Client VHS

They watch as a hose is connects the exhaust to a car window. One boy disconnects the hose, but the man in the car revives and captures him. He tells Mark why he wants to die (he knows too much). The boys get away. Back in New Orleans we see Barry ""the blade"" in action. The police find the body in that car, and the boys in the woods. Young Ricky suffers from shock and stress. There is a missing state senator, his body can't be found. Mark's fingerprints were in that car! Mark goes to find a lawyer and tells what he saw. The FBI questions Mark. Does he need a lawyer? Reggie Love shows up to question the FBI. There is a surprise! A reporter shows up at the charity hospital with a camera. That private investigator meets Mark and questions him. That night a masked man threatens Mark if he talks to anyone!We learn why that missing state senator was in trouble (he took money but didn't deliver). Reggie stands up for Mark. Can the FBI take Mark into protective custody? Later Mark tells about his family history to Reggie, and what happened. Mark's trailer is burned down by the mob! His mother is quite upset. Mark is taken into protective custody. Judge Roosevelt holds a court hearing, when Mark testifies he invoked the Fifth Amendment! He will stay in protective custody. Can he escape? A man chases him [for action or suspense]. Mark calls Reggie for help. Does he have a dangerous plan to find a body? They find that boathouse. Will the bad guys also go there? The body is under a thin layer of concrete. There is a surprise: an alarm goes off, the bad guys run away. Reggie makes a deal with Roy to safeguard Mark's family in the Witness Protection program. This is done quickly. Barry ""the blade"" goes on a ride with two pals. Mark's family goes to a new location and will live in a real home ""with walk-in closets"". Reggie says goodby to Roy. There seems to be a happy ending for the good guys.There seems to be too much comedy for a crime drama. Mark seems to be way too smart for his age (maybe twelve?). This movie seems to mock the Federal prosecutor and his staff, and others. Some humor is often used in dramas to relieve the tension. Was it done correctly here? All in all, it is an interesting story but incredible in parts. Was the book better? The suicide of that lawyer seems like a gimmick to create a story. Making a murder victim disappear goes back to Judge Crater (or Jimmy Hoffa). Putting a body in a shallow grave near housing doesn't seem realistic. Overall, this movie would have been better if it was more serious.",3,How a Murder Affects Other People,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,2662,"['Client', '1994', 'filmTwo', 'boys', 'wander', 'woods', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'then', 'hide', 'when', 'car', 'up', 'watch', 'hose', 'exhaust', 'car', 'window', 'One', 'boy', 'hose', 'man', 'car', 'revives', 'Mark', 'why', 'die', 'too', 'much', 'boys', 'get', 'away', 'Back', 'New', 'Orleans', 'see', 'Barry', 'blade', 'action', 'police', 'find', 'body', 'car', 'boys', 'woods', 'Young', 'Ricky', 'suffers', 'shock', 'stress', 'missing', 'state', 'senator', 'body', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'Mark', 'fingerprints', 'were', 'car', 'Mark', 'find', 'lawyer', 'what', 'saw', 'FBI', 'questions', 'Mark', 'need', 'lawyer', 'Reggie', 'Love', 'up', 'question', 'FBI', 'surprise', 'reporter', 'up', 'charity', 'hospital', 'camera', 'private', 'investigator', 'meets', 'Mark', 'questions', 'night', 'masked', 'man', 'Mark', 'anyone', 'learn', 'why', 'missing', 'state', 'senator', 'was', 'trouble', 'took', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'Reggie', 'up', 'Mark', 'Can', 'FBI', 'take', 'Mark', 'protective', 'custody', 'Later', 'Mark', 'family', 'history', 'Reggie', 'what', 'happened', 'Mark', 'trailer', 'burned', 'down', 'mob', 'mother', 'quite', 'upset', 'Mark', 'taken', 'protective', 'custody', 'Judge', 'Roosevelt', 'court', 'hearing', 'when', 'Mark', 'invoked', 'Fifth', 'Amendment', 'will', 'stay', 'protective', 'custody', 'Can', 'escape', 'man', '[', 'action', 'suspense', ']', 'Mark', 'Reggie', 'help', 'have', 'dangerous', 'plan', 'find', 'body', 'find', 'boathouse', 'Will', 'bad', 'guys', 'also', 'go', 'there', 'body', 'thin', 'layer', 'concrete', 'surprise', 'alarm', 'off', 'bad', 'guys', 'run', 'away', 'Reggie', 'deal', 'Roy', 'safeguard', 'Mark', 'family', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'program', 'done', 'quickly', 'Barry', 'blade', 'ride', 'two', 'pals', 'Mark', 'family', 'new', 'location', 'will', 'live', 'real', 'home', 'walk-in', 'closets', 'Reggie', 'goodby', 'Roy', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'good', 'guys.There', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'comedy', 'crime', 'drama', 'Mark', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'smart', 'age', 'maybe', 'twelve', 'movie', 'mock', 'Federal', 'prosecutor', 'staff', 'others', 'humor', 'often', 'used', 'dramas', 'relieve', 'tension', 'Was', 'done', 'correctly', 'here', 'interesting', 'story', 'incredible', 'parts', 'Was', 'book', 'better', 'suicide', 'lawyer', 'gimmick', 'create', 'story', 'Making', 'murder', 'victim', 'disappear', 'back', 'Judge', 'Crater', 'Jimmy', 'Hoffa', 'Putting', 'body', 'shallow', 'grave', 'housing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'Overall', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'more', 'serious']",The Client VHS

It doesn't have its own identity, but instead feels like a variation of the same.  Still, the cast is very strong, especially Susan Sarandon, who manages to unearth a great shade of character and backstory to create someone moving and memorable.

The rest just isn't good. Good story, but Brad Renfro's acting killed the film for me. What's worse, Joel Schumacher once again killed the movie. This was a great potential for a skilled director to harness and channel into a visionary motion picture, and too bad it was laid on the hands of a dunce. Do you think that I don't know what I am talking about? See The Rainmaker, how Francis Ford Coppola was able to deliver a mastery of a Grisham picture. I am quite thrilled with the character work by Coates and Richert. It is not often I would see villains like them and be convinced by the way they were so intense to me. I really enjoyed it every minute. Why was Brad Renfro hired for this role? He wasn't all that good. That really sank the film's credibility for me. I blew raspberries when I learned that Susan Sarandon was nominated for the Academy Award for her role. Really, what did they see? I surely saw nothing. At least the movie had some energy to pull me through for two hours. One illogical part lurks: why, during the confrontation in the elevator, did Gronke let the boy go?

The story has to do with two young trailer-trash boys who inadvertently become witnesses to the suicide of a mob lawyer. Before the suicide, one of the boys has personal contact with the lawyer. The lawyer was involved in the murder of a senator and the boys were hunted down with the idea that they might have knowledge of the location of the body. One of the boys is in a coma as a result of the traumatic experience. The other (Brad Renfro) is relentlessly pursued until he hires a lawyer (Susan Sarandon) for a  dollar and she steps in to protect his rights and look out after his safety. Thus, he becomes ""The Client"" of the movie title.It's an interesting story with a lot of twists and turns and will probably hold your attention with little difficulty. It provides an interesting perspective on the legal system, especially as it might apply to children. The acting of Sarandon and Renfro is excellent, and the supporting cast backs them up well. The movie is nicely filmed and directed. I'd regard it as a fairly fast-moving, fairly thrilling and very interesting movie.Gary Peterson",5,"Fast Moving, Thrilling. Interesting.

367694,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303269834,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Oh, hey, remember when Hollywood was all gaga about John Grisham? When people made much ado about THE FIRM? Nowadays Grisham isn't as much the cinematic darling, although he still gets his stuff adapted to film here and there. Today, he doesn't register so strongly on the public's awareness meter. Which is sad, because I still pick up his legal thrillers. I should maybe harp on that adage about familiarity breeding contempt. But no.The topic for discussion, THE CLIENT, isn't as engrossing or entertaining a film as THE FIRM or THE RAINMAKER or RUNAWAY JURY. But it's better than THE CHAMBER or A TIME TO KILL. THE CLIENT's powerhouse cast, more than anything else, makes this worth a peek. The thin premise relies on your cooperation, on your buying that a trailer home kid in Memphis, Tennessee would scorn the protection of the police and keep mum about what he witnessed. And I get it; there are folks out there who want no truck with the authorities. So the premise is thin but, I guess, plausible.Savvy eleven-year-old Mark Sway (a likable Brad Renfro) comes from one of them down and out families, what social workers label as ""indigent."" Like his hard-working young mother, Mark has never gotten a break in life, this maybe accounting for his street smarts and his fierce independence and how he's so slow to trust. In Memphis, Tennessee, one day, Mark and his younger brother are out playing in the nearby woods when they witness the suicide shooting of a mob lawyer. Except that before the lawyer offed himself, he confessed to Mark certain unsavory facts. And maybe if that cop hadn't been so suspicious and condescending, Mark would've come across.Much of Mark's awareness of how the world works is based on what he's seen on television. He figures he's stepped deep in it and decides to go fetch himself legal representation. A flier discarded by an ambulance chaser leads him to a law firm, and in that building he stumbles across Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), inexperienced woman attorney and recovering alcoholic. Except that Reggie doesn't talk down to Mark, and sometimes all a body needs is to not be talked down to. Also she takes on the case for only a dollar.Reggie's got her work cut out for her as everyone - the press, the mob, the FBI, and especially the spotlight-hogging, Scriptures-quoting federal prosecutor ""Reverend"" Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) - is trying to make her young client talk. Her two years of practicing law put her at a disadvantage. Reggie goes out on a limb anyway, puts her career at risk. Susan Sarandon, who would be nominated for an Oscar for this role, invests her character with plenty of fight. Reggie Love is marvelously scrappy. She even tries her hand at being nurturing.THE CLIENT is a taut legal thriller in its own right, although there are only a very few scenes that take place in the courtroom. But it's more of a crime drama, what with the mob presence and the chase scenes. The film's strength is in its cast. Really, only the rash, dumb hood played by Anthony La Paglia comes off as weak and obvious. Will Patton is very effective as the menacing cop who sets Mark on his path of nondisclosure. Ossie Davis is a regal and sympathetic judge who must rule on whether he should order Mark to 'fess up in court. Mary Louise Parker does more than expected with her thankless role of Mark's plaintive and impoverished single mother. Anthony Edwards, a very good actor, is shamefully relegated to playing background prop. But on the credits, he's Reggie's law partner.Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are commanding and impeccable, and I relished those moments in which they bared their teeth at each other, Sarandon's defiant, heavy-lidded gaze against Jones' dead-eye stare. Don't be surprised if you draw parallels between Jones' performance here and his U.S. Marshall from THE FUGITIVE. Sarandon and Renfro also make the most of their characters' strong emotional bond, Reggie Love having rapidly become Mark's one trusted friend, champion, and surrogate mom. Reggie gets so invested in her client that some of the measures she takes to protect Mark constitute straight-up grounds for disbarment. THE CLIENT, polished and expertly crafted, isn't as ambitious or artistic as THE FIRM, what with director Joel Schumacher content to be a crowd-pleasing technician rather than aspire to the aesthetic heights achieved by Sydney Pollack. And because THE CLIENT doesn't dare to be great, and because Schumacher opts for the common denominator thrills, what we get is a solid and enjoyable enough film. But there's a reason I rank it below three other Grisham adaptations. 3.5 out of 5 stars for THE CLIENT.The DVD's paltry bonus stuff: ""A Nationwide Search"" - text article recalling the nationwide search for a child actor to play ""Mark Sway""; ""Behind the Scenes"" notes on THE CLIENT; the theatrical trailer; and cast & crew credits.",4,"""They're gonna get me, Reggie.

The heroes are two kids who, by accident, some summer afternoon, witness a suicide, well witness: in fact a little bit more. The two kids are living with their mother in a trailer, a mobile home. There is no father. They are indigent people. One kid gets into some kind of a coma caused by the post-traumatic syndrome of the event and the other hates cops, super-hates the FBI, does not trust lawyers and yet he picks one more or less by accident. The suicide is connected to some important murder by some kind of mafia and the whole gist of the case is to find the body of this dead person. Then of course the kid does not want to speak being afraid for his family. The lawyer has to support him but she cannot do anything illegal.

The mobster reveals the whereabouts of a body everyone is searching for, and after his suicide, everyone comes to believe that the boy knows the truth - he has both the Mob and the FBI after him for it.  The always great Tommy Lee Jones leads the way for the FBI, while it's up to small time lawyer Susan Sarandon to defend and protect the boy, her client.  Sarandon is terrific as the emotionally wounded lawyer trying to keep everyone at bay.  Renfro is extremely good as the kid/client, completely believable and self-possessed.  The story moves along well, being highly entertaining without ever becoming too improbable as films like this sometimes do.  At the heart of the film is the relationship between attorney and client, very well written and played.

From his southern accent to his bullheaded obstination, Renfro creates a portrait of a child looking for love and leadership.  He and his little brother witness the suicide of a gangland lawyer, who before dying tells Renfro where the body of a murdered senator is hidden.  Tommy Lee Jones as a slick Federal attorney decides that Renfro knows the location and wants the boy to talk.  Bright Renfro decides he needs a lawyer and ends up with Susan Sarandon, in her fourth Oscar nominated performance.  Of course, since the little boy has become a media darling, the bad guys want him too.  The expected chase begins, but not before some touching and exciting sequences occur.Director Joel Schumacher keeps things moving nicely and elicits strong performances from a rather starstudded cast: Mary Louise Parker as Renfro's mom; Ossie Davis as a no nonsense judge; Micole Mercurio as Sarandon's nice mama; Anthony LaPaglia as the slimy murderer; Anthony Edwards as Sarandon's assistant, and Bradley Whitford as the yuppie lawyer.  Ultimately though, it's the power of Renfro and Sarandon's performances that catapult this movie into its stratosphere.

And indeed, most of his books have become movies - and I haven't liked most of them any better than I liked that first book (well, except for The Pelican Brief).The Client, however, is really, really good. How could it NOT be, with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones? It's a whirlwind thriller based on a secret held by an 11yo kid who knows the identity of a Mob murderer. The poor kid knows he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't, and he's caught between 3 powerful forced: the federal prosecutor, the murdered, and his attorney (Sarandon), who risks not just her career but also her life when she goes right down to the wire for her client.Super flick.",4,A really good one.,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,898,"['first', 'time', 'read', 'John', 'Grisham', 'book', 'was', 'disappointed', 'read', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'express', 'purpose', 'being', 'turned', 'screenplay', 'rather', 'who', 'good', 'book', 'appreciate', 'good', 'writing', 'indeed', 'most', 'books', 'have', 'become', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'most', 'better', 'liked', 'first', 'book', 'well', 'Pelican', 'Brief', '.The', 'Client', 'however', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'How', 'could', 'NOT', 'be', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'whirlwind', 'thriller', 'based', 'secret', 'held', '11yo', 'kid', 'who', 'identity', 'Mob', 'murderer', 'poor', 'kid', 'damned', 'damned', ""n't"", 'caught', '3', 'powerful', 'forced', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'murdered', 'attorney', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'career', 'also', 'life', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'wire', 'client.Super', 'flick']",The Client VHS

367719,A3V61K0EF38GP4,6303269834,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","While not in the same league as The Rainmaker, this adaptation of John Grisham's novel of the same name is certainly not to be ignored.  In his acting debut, Brad Renfro shines as a young boy in Tennessee who, along with his little brother, witnesses a man's suicide, but not before the man discloses his reasons for taking his own life, reasons that the U.S. Attorney's Office is very interested in.  Wanting to protect himself and his family, the young boy recruits a local attorney, played by Susan Sarandon, to help him stay out of trouble for not telling what he knows as some mobsters have already threatened him into keeping his silence.  I do wonder why, in the book or the film, everyone either bends or is bent to the will of this kid, who is basing all of his brilliant decisions on stuff he's seen on TV.  If anything, this plot point should serve as a lesson to parents about monitoring the stuff your offspring sees on the screen.  I know he was threatened, but the kid, and more importantly, his lawyer, should have brought that to the attention of the U.S. Attorney who, if he so badly wanted that information, would have then bent over backwards twice to ensure protection.  The man may be an ambitious, self-serving annoyance, all qualities properly portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in this film, but he'd surely do anything to preserve his case, and the witnesses in front of him.  But if this ""kid genius"" wasn't the main character, we wouldn't have this plot point, or the story for that matter, to begin with.  Regardless of this glaring problem, which cost this film a star in my rating, it was still well-acted and well-paced.  While certain things in the book were changed, some might have been for the better given that books and movies are different media and others didn't hurt the story.  It's a solid film and one of the better adaptations of John Grisham's work, right behind ""The Rainmaker"", ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Firm"", and tied with ""Runaway Jury"".

She is barely out of sight before they burst from the old trailer and make off to the river where the older boy lights them both up after giving a suitable big brother lecture about the way a habit must be managed.  As they sit there smoking, up comes a big black auto with a suicidal Mob lawyer who knows his career is over and sets up a rubber hose from the exhaust into the cab.  The oldest boy knows this will kill the guy so he sneaks up and pulls out the hose.  The Mobster is disappointed in the results, checks the exhaust and mutters something about lousing everything up again.  He reconnects the hose and gets back in his car.  Repeat.  This time, he sees the kid in the rearview mirror.  He catches him in the act of removing the hose again, forces him into the car and, since he is planning to do himself in anyway, gets it all off his chest and tells the boy everything he needs to know to become a prime hit target of the Bosses; detailing the whacking of a senator who probably reneged on a deal he made with them, and the location of the body.  All sorts of things happen next; his little brother is traumatized by the sight of the suicide, their mother loses her job over it, what can go wrong does.Enter the cops, the FBI and Susan Sarandon, who takes the kid's case after he sneaks into her office to find help.  Tommy Lee Jones in his role as the brilliant FBI man, is TommyLeeJonesesque and that's always OK with me.  Susan Sarandon is the very pro bono lawyer with a cause - a kid who will surely be killed if he is not handled right in the system.

As in most of his thrillers, we get a whole handful in ""The Client"":  the slimy mafia lawyer, the power-hungry politician-to-be, the self-aggrandizing ambulance-chaser, the grandfatherly judge and, of course, the motherly family law practitioner who turned to legal practice after overcoming a few troubles of her own.  I think that leaves only the greedy corporate attorney, his cousin the corrupt judge and their perpetual antagonists, the starving public interest lawyer and the inquisitive student prodigy unrepresented here; but still, not a bad collection for a single thriller, even by Grisham.  (And that doesn't even include the count of dumb and/or malicious cops, slick tabloid journalists and ruthless mobsters running around in this story.)  But never mind:  ""The Client"" is one of John Grisham's best-ever novels, and this movie surpasses many another big-screen adaptation of his books by several leagues.  For Grisham at the top of his game is also an excellent storyteller, and in the hands of director Joel Schumacher his tale of beleaguered eleven-year-old Mark Sway who gets in trouble by becoming the reluctant last confidant of suicidal defense attorney Jerome ""Romey"" Clifford comes to life in spot-on and truly gripping fashion.Although not even a teenager yet, Mark (Brad Renfro) is as tough as they come - a Memphis trailer park kid who gets most of his education on life's really important aspects from TV, has already helped his mom (Mary-Louise Parker) get rid of the wife-beating guy he now calls his ""ex-father,"" and since then has been the man in the house, taking care of his eight-year-old brother Ricky whenever their mother is at work (i.e., most of the time).  So Mark doesn't scare easily; and even if he really is afraid, he'd rather drop dead than admit it.  But with both the mob *and* the feds on his trail - the former out to kill him before he can share the dirty little secret they suspect Romey has spilled before blowing out his brains, the latter hell-bent on making him share that very secret - even Mark has to face the fact that he is in way over his head ... and yes, he's scared, too; and not just a little.  Worse, his brother is out cold, in hospital being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder because watching Romey's suicide was more than his delicate eight-year-old soul could take, and their mother is in hospital with Ricky on the doctor's orders because Ricky might need her when he wakes up. (Consequently she's also out of a job, because her sweat-shop employer doesn't take kindly to this sort of family emergency).  Reluctantly, Mark therefore concludes that he needs an attorney.  And in short order, he lands on the doorstep of Regina ""Reggie"" Love (Susan Sarandon), middle-aged but only a few years out of law school, through which she put herself after her husband left her for a younger woman, not without depriving her of their children's custody and branding her an unfit mother.  But what starts as a hesitant relationship at best on Mark's side soon turns out his one stroke of luck, because Reggie is probably the only lawyer in town not afraid to take on even powerful U.S. Attorney ""Reverend"" Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) and the FBI, and ultimately willing to put her own job at risk for her client.While condensing some of its elements, the movie's screenplay follows Grisham's novel fairly closely, taking part of its dialogue straight from the book.  Yet, ""The Client"" lives not only from John Grisham's gripping story but also - and primarily - from its characters and outstanding cast, including the ever-reliable J.T. Walsh (FBI Agent McThune), William H. Macy (Ricky's doctor), Anthony Edwards (Reggie's assistant Clint), Ossie Davis (Judge Roosevelt) and Walter Olkewicz (""Romey"" Clifford).  Unquestioningly most memorable, however, is the quintet at the movie's center.  Brad Renfro was selected by Schumacher for his first-ever screen appearance as Mark because he had a somewhat similar background as the story's hero and thus, an intuitive understanding that, along with his innate toughness, ultimately proved more convincing than the acting skills of more experienced child actors; and indeed, he so compellingly carries his part that he deservedly garnered a 1995 Young Artists Award.  Susan Sarandon earned another Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Reggie, who actually listens to her clients and makes sure even those of their desires that may seem trivial to others are taken care of; such as Dianne Sway's wish for a walk-in closet.  (Sarandon's Academy-Award nomination was her fourth after ""Atlantic City,"" ""Thelma & Louise"" and ""Lorenzo's Oil;"" but although she had to wait yet another year to finally score an Oscar with ""Dead Man Walking,"" ""The Client"" at least won her a BAFTA Award).  Tommy Lee Jones plays the bible-quoting Foltrigg with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek and thus, although occasionally terrifying, makes him a more complete and almost even likeable character; much more so than he is in Grisham's novel.  Mary-Louise Parker's Dianne Sway truly brings to life the young besieged trailer park mom desperately trying to get a grip on her life, and Anthony LaPaglia finally is simultaneously frightening and unintentionally funny as the slick but not overly bright mob killer Barry ""The Blade"" Muldanno, the source of Clifford's (and consequently everybody else's) problems.So, watch this for the outstanding performances of the five central characters as well as the fine ensemble cast, for one of John Grisham's most gripping yarns, and for Joel Schumacher's excellent editing and sense of place.  This may not be a major milestone in movie history (except regarding Brad Renfro's career of course), but it's without question one of the best thrillers of the past 15 years and easily recommended on that basis alone.Also recommended:The ClientThe FirmThe Pelican BriefA Time to KillDead Man WalkingThe Fugitive / U.S. Marshals (1998)",4,Reggie to the Rescue.,1087948800,"06 23,
