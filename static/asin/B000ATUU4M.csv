933750,AZCFS1OAU86YK,B000ATUU4M,C. Cloutier,"[1, 1]","This is a touching story of giving the person you love everything they want, if only for one day.  This is, I think, Jennifer Love Hewitt's best role to date.  She looks her best, she's given a great script to work with, and she creates her character perfectly.  Some people won't like the ending because it's not a feel-good ending, but when you think about it, that's the most powerful scene of all.  What he does, and gives up, for her shows just how much he loves her and how far he's willing to go to protect her.I have only two problems with this movie.  First, why is there no soundtrack for this film?  Jennifer's songs are beautiful, and they are not available on any of her CDs.  It's a shame to keep them locked away within the movie.  My second issue is with the aspect ratio.  Right at the beginning there's the standard full-screen notice saying the film has been modified to fit your screen.  So if they filmed it in widescreen format (which is evident by the last few seconds plus the credits having the black bars on top and bottom), why not release it in widescreen format as well?

933751,A2J0MP2GPNHJHF,B000ATUU4M,"Claudio Di Gregorio ""ClauDG""","[1, 4]","Four & 5 star reviewers must be kidding when they declare they were romantically raptured by this film. In my book, a romantic movie should also include meaningful, elegant, interesting or powerful dialogue (say, Butterflies are Free, Two for the Road, The Swan, Sabrina First and 2nd version...). Nothing of that sort is here.SPOILER!!!*** The engaging and promisory premise that gives grounds to ""If Only"" is disjointedly developed. Even Tom Wilkinson comes across as a nasty, implacable fellow, more than a wise benevolent spirit. What is the point of his behaviour? The male hero really does not redeem himself in the second chance he receives, and even if he does, is him who dies, not the girl. So, again: what is the moral?I admit that I am badly predisposed against ""If Only"" for three not-too artistic reasons (but which made me laugh when they happened and convinced me that this was a cheap movie): JLH character is supposed to be a violin teacher and a violinist in a symphonic orchestra, yet she has NO idea how to remotely pretend to be playing the violin. While she ""plays"" (let's call it that) her wrist seems held in a cast and the instrument's bow goes all over the place, probably endangering the eyes of the extras sitting around her :-). In the meantime her left hand grabs the infortunate instrument as if somebody were trying to take it away from her. I suggest watching the old ""Intermezzo"" film to see how an actor -Leslie Howard- could really imitate the playing of a violin.Second: she is a symphonic musician, yet the piece she composes and sings at the end is a cheap inconsequential pop song even more forgettable than this movie. And the public of the theatre applauded at her. (Good for them: they were being nice, no doubt, but do not try that in the Metropolitan).Third, my favorite: The boyfriend steals from her a sheet of the song she wrote (a piano part?) and he makes 65 photocopies of it (which assumingly he distributes to the members of the orchestra). Evidently, according to the screenwriters, every musician in an orchestra reads the same part, no matter what instrument he/she is playing. Kinda One-Page-Fits-All music. Did the screenwriters ever heard of the words ""orchestration, arrangement and harmony""?.

933757,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ATUU4M,Grady Harp,"[13, 14]","Christina Welsh has written a fine screenplay that proves that old ideas can be re-worked in a thoroughly original way.  Gil Junger steps out of his role as a director for TV series and molds Welsh's story into a visually charming and sensible, touching movie.  Add the considerable talents of one highly regarded pro (Tom Wilkinson) and two underrated young bright lights (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls) and the result is a little film that is polished, absorbing, and genuinely tender.Samantha (Hewitt) is a musician living and studying in London where she is in a healthy relationship with a handsome young executive Ian (Nicholls): though obviously in love, Ian is more involved with his work than Samantha would like and on the day of her 'finals concert' they have a spat over several issues. On his way to his all-important meeting Ian encounters a taxi driver (Wilkinson) who gives him some sage advice about his love life. Abruptly Samantha is killed in a freak auto accident and Ian is devastated.  In his grief he strangely awakens to the same day in which Samantha was killed, and through a series of working through the elements of his life where he failed her (with a bit of aid from the taxi driver), Ian has an 'If only' experience, a time to re-evaluate his love for Samantha, his life, and his changes.  A twist in the events brings the story to a surprise but apropos ending.From what could have been yet another love-death tearjerker of a Hollywood movie emerges a story with heart and with some poignant lessons for us all.  Hewitt proves a fine actress in this film and is beautifully paired by the exciting presence of relative newcomer Paul Nichols.  It is not a great movie, but it is one that will pleasantly surprise viewers who may have though it was just another 'chick flick'.  Give it a chance - it is worth it!

Never mind that countless studies have demonstrated that cohabitating couples are more likely to divorce if eventually they marry, than if they had not cohabitated.Hewitt and Nichols play lovers (Ian and Samantha) in their early twenties (she hasn't even graduated conservatory) who find romance grows best in the fertile soil of wealthy extravagance. Ian is some kind of young - obviously high paid - pitch man for a genetic engineering enterprise that offers mankind the ""greatest  gift of all"" - a longer life. He effortlessly affords a multi-story home in London (think in terms of affording such a pad in, say, Manhattan - even Sean Connery lives in multi-family dwelling in Manhattan) and performs his mysterious work-a-day chores in an office that probably rivals Bill Gates'. But we must be charitable to the screenwriter - after all, How can romance flourish with the dirt and grime of some youthful poverty clinging to your heels?The whole idea behind this film is that we would all appreciate those closest to us better if we could sample their demise. That's fine so far as it goes, but they make their pitch farcical thus: about two-thirds way through the film Samantha consoles Ian over the loss of his beloved father by making light of it - ""Wherever (your father) is, I bet he knows how you feel (about him)...death doesn't put an end to love"". Now isn't that a curious line to insert into the context of this film? First, Ian's lucrative career is driven by his passion to give people longer lives (through genetic engineering). If death doesn't end love between the deceased and the living, then why the big push to extend life for as long as possible? Second, the whole point of this film is - besides romance - to drive home the point that ""Boy, you better love the one your with, with all your heart, mind and soul, while you have the chance. You never know what tomorrow may bring."" Well, what concern about tomorrow bringing separation through death if ""wherever"" people go, they still know we love them, and they can reciprocate?Death is a calamity, and must be regarded as such without exception. This film undermines the very point it is trying to make. Unfortunately, there are other means by which this film makes itself ridiculous.
