Two aging ladies learn to rely on each other to navigate the difficulties of living on a fixed income in an ever-more expensive world.  The characters are real, the drama believable and the comedy timed just right to keep the film in balance.

This work should have won some major awards... it is funny, sad, poignant and tough at all the right moments.  Louise Fletcher and Cicely Tyson gave sterling, award-worthy performances and Lea Delaria is certainly no slouch in the acting department.  I'm saddened to see this movie discontinued, there is a real market for it.  Catch it when you can.

I went back to check the reviews, because I thought I had seen that all the reviews were high. They were. So I thought maybe I didn't give the movie enough time. So I went back and watched some more. I even forwarded the movie to see if it got better. It didn't!  It bored me to death and was annoying. Very rarely do I not finish a movie.
