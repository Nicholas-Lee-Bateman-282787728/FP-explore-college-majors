Now, don't get me wrong Ian McEwan is a great writer. The craft is evident. ""Atonement"" was no different, I finished it, put it down and had a so what moment. What was the story telling us? The destruction caused by false accusation, or how difficult once such an accusation is made, to live life as it was before. Read Peter Temple's ""Truth"" for a novel that takes you into that heart of darkness. So, I was not expecting a lot of the film, well less than a lot because she (the gorgeous Kiera) was starring in it and rumour has it, takes her kit off. Well, am I the only hetro male with a pulse who thinks she's ok, but I wouldn't launch a ship over her. Well mabe a small clinker. One of those floating platforms we used to have on the Tyne. So, this film did the business. It is a very good film and again full of craft. it does not slavishly tell the story as written. It reminded me of ""The Hours"". Layers of meaning to keep you thinking, engaged with the characters. And then when the lights went up and the smartie box was empty, it felt satisfying. (Me, not the smartie box). As if you had had a good feed. Postscript: I can't tell you whether Ms Knightley removed items of clothing-it might spoil the plot.

1143177,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0013K7ZPE,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[10, 17]","Child prodigy, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is very capable.  Using a typewriter in her family's stately English house, she is able to produce ""stupendous"" plays--as her mother says--while barely a teenager.Her great work, however, is based on an actual experience.  Seeing her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightly) from her window, she sees her undress in front of her suitor, Robbie (James McAvoy) in front of a fountain.  Astonished, she looks away from the window.  When she looks back up, Cecilia is drenched, having gone in the fountain.  The whole scene seems mischievous, filled with passion.  Shortly later, we see that scene played out again.  But this time we see it properly from the couple's point-of-view.  Robbie has become playful and careless.  He eventually knocks a vase out of Cecilia's hand which breaks on the stone rim of the fountain with a piece going into the water well.  Aware of its value as the family's most valuable keepsake, Cecilia strips of her clothing and dives into the fountain to retrieve the missing piece.One of the main elements of 'Atonement' is deception.  What a child sees can be misleading.  As I watched the film, I kept thinking of 'Witness' and how in real life people can take matters out of context.  One's view of an event can look very different from another`s.  Much likeStranger Than Fictionbefore it, the movie blends, then sorts out fiction from reality.Richly embellished in music that highlights the mood of every scene, and edited with such keen perfection as to be Oscar worthy,  ('No Country for Old Men' being the other big contender in my mind.') 'Atonement' has a standard of excellence that seldom falters for a moment.  The frenetic pace of the music, matched with the tapping of the typewriter, build up to some intangible suspense.  Where the story is going, no one has a clue.  Like many recent cinematic offerings, the movie starts to shuffle the time frames.  Mainly it goes forward, but sometimes it backs up to show us a new piece of evidence.  Although different in impact, the life changing incidents reminded me of the shuffling done in the recent filmBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead [Blu-ray].From there Robbie's and Cecilia's lives are disrupted.  Starting in 1935, the couple must later face the debacle of the Second Great War.  What is so special about `Atonement' is the way it plays out the contrast between the fate that we all must face (in this case war), and the consequential choices that make or mar people's lives.  While the ending isn't entirely neat and tidy, the resolution has a sweeping resonance that hardly teases the audience.Besides yeoman craftsmanship by director,  Joe Wright, and editor, Paul Tothill, 'Atonement' brings upper echelon performances to the screen.  Christopher Hampton's screenplay adaptation (from a novel by Ian McEwan) is solid and  keeps the emotional tension.  'Atonement' may not be as strong as last year'sNotes on a Scandal, but it is a compelling piece of work, nevertheless.  With all of its assets, this film may indeed bring a day of reckoning when it gets closer to the annual awards.",5,Truth or Consequences,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,3111,"['Child', 'prodigy', 'Briony', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'very', 'capable', 'Using', 'typewriter', 'family', 'stately', 'English', 'house', 'able', 'produce', 'stupendous', 'plays', 'mother', 'barely', 'teenager.Her', 'great', 'work', 'however', 'based', 'actual', 'experience', 'Seeing', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'window', 'undress', 'front', 'suitor', 'Robbie', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'front', 'fountain', 'Astonished', 'away', 'window', 'When', 'back', 'up', 'Cecilia', 'drenched', 'having', 'gone', 'fountain', 'whole', 'scene', 'mischievous', 'filled', 'passion', 'Shortly', 'later', 'see', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'again', 'time', 'see', 'properly', 'couple', 'point-of-view', 'Robbie', 'become', 'playful', 'careless', 'eventually', 'vase', 'Cecilia', 'hand', 'stone', 'rim', 'fountain', 'piece', 'going', 'water', 'well', 'Aware', 'value', 'family', 'most', 'valuable', 'keepsake', 'Cecilia', 'strips', 'clothing', 'fountain', 'retrieve', 'missing', 'piece.One', 'main', 'elements', ""'Atonement"", 'deception', 'What', 'child', 'sees', 'can', 'be', 'misleading', 'watched', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', ""'Witness"", 'how', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'can', 'take', 'matters', 'context', 'One', 'view', 'event', 'can', 'look', 'very', 'different', 's', 'Much', 'likeStranger', 'Than', 'Fictionbefore', 'movie', 'then', 'out', 'fiction', 'reality.Richly', 'embellished', 'music', 'mood', 'scene', 'edited', 'such', 'keen', 'perfection', 'be', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'being', 'other', 'big', 'contender', 'mind', ""'Atonement"", 'standard', 'excellence', 'seldom', 'falters', 'moment', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'music', 'matched', 'tapping', 'typewriter', 'build', 'up', 'intangible', 'suspense', 'Where', 'story', 'going', 'one', 'clue', 'many', 'recent', 'cinematic', 'offerings', 'movie', 'shuffle', 'time', 'frames', 'Mainly', 'forward', 'up', 'show', 'new', 'piece', 'evidence', 'different', 'impact', 'life', 'changing', 'incidents', 'reminded', 'shuffling', 'done', 'recent', 'filmBefore', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'Dead', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'lives', 'are', 'disrupted', 'Starting', '1935', 'couple', 'must', 'later', 'face', 'debacle', 'Second', 'Great', 'War', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'Atonement', 'way', 'out', 'contrast', 'fate', 'must', 'face', 'case', 'war', 'consequential', 'choices', 'make', 'mar', 'people', 'lives', 'ending', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'neat', 'tidy', 'resolution', 'sweeping', 'resonance', 'hardly', 'audience.Besides', 'yeoman', 'craftsmanship', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'editor', 'Paul', 'Tothill', ""'Atonement"", 'brings', 'echelon', 'performances', 'screen', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'solid', 'emotional', 'tension', ""'Atonement"", 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'strong', 'last', ""year'sNotes"", 'Scandal', 'compelling', 'piece', 'work', 'nevertheless', 'assets', 'film', 'may', 'indeed', 'bring', 'day', 'reckoning', 'when', 'closer', 'annual', 'awards']",N/A

1143179,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B0013K7ZPE,A. Hickman,"[5, 6]","The novel ""Atonement"" marked Ian McEwan's coming of age as a novelist, and I've been reading his novels, and waiting for such a breakthrough, since ""Cement Garden"" came out in 1978.  I was not looking forward to ""Atonement"" when I saw that it was playing in London when I was there last month, but I had an afternoon free and went to see it anyway.  I am so glad I did.  The first section of the movie, especially, is pure genius.  Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are the perfect Cecilia and Robbie.  These are two actors that I hadn't really noticed before, and now I can't wait to see what they do next.  As long as they are the focus of the film (Knightley emerging defiantly from the fountain after retrieving pieces of a vase is one of the finest images ever captured on film), the movie is exceptional.  It only flags a bit in the second half, perhaps because we understand that these characters, Briony included, are doomed.  There is one lovely scene involving a wounded French soldier (played by an all but unrecognizable Jeremie Renier), and Vanessa Redgrave certainly justifies her screen time, but the war scenes are so unbearably sad and claustrophobic that I grew uncomfortable at times.  It is the first half of the film that truly captivates.

Based on a novel by Ian McEwan, and directed by Joe Wright (who had filmed the latest movie version of Pride and Prejudice, much inferior to the BBC miniseries), the bulk of the movie occurs in a British country house during one day in the mid 1930s, in which a crime might have happened of might have just been the figment of the imagination of a fevered child. The main characters will feel for years the consequences of what happened that day. Since I'm totally uninterested on the life of England's upper classes, I was quite bored during a lot of the movie. And as if that wasn't enough, the final twist of the movie (in which Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo role) is totally insulting, and makes the viewer feels cheated.

1143187,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013K7ZPE,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 13]","At the very beginning of 2007 I was introduced to this film.  I was surfing the web looking at upcoming `Oscar fare' and I stumbled upon a still of James McAvoy from this movie I had never heard of called `Atonement'.  At the time I was too wrapped up in another buzzed about film (one that eventually turned into disappointment) to really give this one all that much attention, but as the year progressed forward and the buzz for `Atonement' kept growing I decided to give it a look.  That's when I got my hands on Ian McEwan's novel; the source inspiration for this film.  A few days later I was in tears as I turned the final page of the novel and I just knew that this movie was going to be something special.  I just knew that if it was done right then it would be, quite possibly, the best epic romance ever filmed.  Then I got the opportunity to see the movie and I must say it was everything I dreamed it would be.The film (as well as the novel) follows a certain lie that destroys the lives of three people.  Young Briony Tallis is a very imaginative child.  At thirteen she possesses a maturity that is beyond her years, but it is also a false sense of maturity.  This is to say that Briony only thinks she is mature.  Briony and her sister Cecilia come from a very wealthy family and live in a beautiful home in England.  Robbie Turner, the family housekeeper's son, has pretty much grown up with them like a brother and has been taken under the wing of their parents.  While on the outset one might sense a sort of distain between Cecilia and Robbie it soon becomes apparent that that distain is in all actuality a grounded yet unexpected love.Briony doesn't understand this love.Through a series of events that are misinterpreted by Briony she draws some very unhealthy and inaccurate conclusions about Robbie and when a horrible act of violence is committed against Briony's visiting cousin Lola, Robbie is the first person to whom the finger points.  This false accusation stakes the base or foundation for `Atonement'.  As Robbie is imprisoned and then shipped off to war; as Cecilia writes off her family and begins working as a nurse awaiting Robbie's return; as Briony, stricken with guilt, forsakes her higher education to nurse wounded soldiers, we are always left with this impetuous lie hanging over our heads and lingering in the air.The acting on the parts of the entire cast is flawless, but like many of the critics have already noted, there are three performances that stand out above the rest.  James McAvoy turns in his finest performance to date as the accused; Robbie Turner.  What I love about this performance is the fact that the emotions seem to peel away from him to reveal a man raked by pain and suffering yet determined to find his way back to the arms of his one true love.  Keira Knightley once again proves that she is more than a pretty face (and what a pretty face) with her flawless portrayal of Cecilia.  Her performance is delicate and precise; a very mature turn for which is a stark contrast to her other lauded performance in `Pride and Prejudice'.  Both characters are drastically different yet similar in perplexity.  She wears both very well.  The character of Briony Tallis is separated among three actresses, one of which stands out among the rest.  Young Saoirse Ronan plays Briony at age thirteen, the Briony who starts this downward spiral.  Her performance is in a word `flawless'.  She brilliantly captures the danger that rests inside innocent wonderment and displays an almost cold demeanor that, when analyzed closely, gives way to the immaturity within her character that she cannot accept.  It's a marvelous performance.The other two actresses that portray Briony are Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.  Both of them do a fine job but neither have the power that Ronan has.  This may have to do with the fact that Ronan's part is lengthier and much baitier.  Garai does a fine job in getting under Briony's guilt but she at times appears a tad lost, as if she's not sure what she should do next.  This could throw some off but once Redgrave comes on the screen she answers a few questions we may have and sheds some light on Garai's seemingly odd behavior.  Redgrave is miraculous in her very short scene but I feel that I can't really speak of it without giving too much away so I'll refrain from saying anything more.The rest of the supporting cast is on point throughout.  Young Juno Temple is memorable as the victimized Lola Quincey and brothers Felix and Charlie von Simson capture the innocence of Jackson and Pierrot beautifully.  Patrick Kennedy portrays Leon Tallis with great brotherly attention and Harriet Walter and Brenda Blethyn portray opposite spectrums of motherhood memorably.  Benedict Cumberbatch is noteworthy for his intense performance as Paul Marshall.The real star here though, is none other than director Joe Wright.  His attention to detail is miraculous.  What I love about his approach here is that it is epic in its broad scope and flashy visual grace but delicate in that it never overlooks the little things.  Sure, it's beautiful but it's also very intricate and cautious.  Wright works very hard to do his source material justice and manages to do so with flying colors.  Just look at the lauded Dunkirk tracking sequence; orgasmic to say the least; but more so, the library love scene is in my opinion the single best sequence in film this year.  The way that Wright was able to create such raw lusty emotions without shedding an article of clothing; the way Knightley's head, stiff and tense, arches to stare McAvoy in the eyes and whisper ""I love you""; every single detail just creates this flawless experience.  Combine this with 2005's `Pride and Prejudice' and one can see that Joe Wright is setting himself up for a marvelous career.`Atonement' is truly a very beautiful film, visually as well as emotionally.

Joe Wright's staging of Dunkirk in one extended, long shot is magnificent; it's something that will stand as a testament to his ability for decades.Keira Knightley - still only 22 - and James McAvoy are solid as the star-crossed leads.  About Keira, enough said.  About McAvoy, he continues to grow into a major film star.  We happened across him the other night in a small part in the BBC'sThe Inspector Lynley Mysteries Series 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  That was about 2001.  He's been on a fast-rising, well-deserved, upwards trajectory since then, most notably his fantastic turn inThe Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition), in which he doesn't get blown off the screen by Forest Whitaker's epic rendering of Idi Amin.  Holding his own there was an achievement in itself.Despite the two stars, the film hangs it hat on a triumvirate of actresses who play the role of Briony.  This is where I feel the MPAA got it wrong in its 2007 Supporting Actress nominations: Saoirse Ronan got the nod for her role as 13-year-old Briony.  Surely, she gets the meat of the time on-screen, and it's a very self-assured performance for 13-year-old girl.  But, acting-wise, both Romola Garai (as the 18-year-old version) and the power cameo by Vanessa Redgrave as 'Older Briony' (that's how the credits tab her) are better performances.  I was especially taken by Ms. Garai's short but powerful rendering.  It's the point in her life where Briony begins to comprehend what she's done and cannot un-do.  That experience is clearly etched on her face and her performance.",4,"A director's film; the Briony trio turn in a powerful, collective performance",1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1619,"['Amazon', 'review', 'right', 'here', 'director', 'film', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'staging', 'Dunkirk', 'one', 'extended', 'long', 'shot', 'magnificent', 'something', 'will', 'stand', 'testament', 'ability', 'decades.Keira', 'Knightley', 'still', 'only', '22', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'are', 'solid', 'star-crossed', 'leads', 'Keira', 'enough', 'said', 'McAvoy', 'grow', 'major', 'film', 'star', 'happened', 'other', 'night', 'small', 'part', ""BBC'sThe"", 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'Series', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'was', '2001', 'been', 'fast-rising', 'well-deserved', 'upwards', 'trajectory', 'then', 'most', 'notably', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'inThe', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', ""n't"", 'get', 'blown', 'off', 'screen', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'epic', 'rendering', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Holding', 'own', 'was', 'achievement', 'itself.Despite', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'triumvirate', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'role', 'Briony', 'where', 'feel', 'MPAA', 'got', 'wrong', '2007', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nominations', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'got', 'nod', 'role', '13-year-old', 'Briony', 'Surely', 'meat', 'time', 'on-screen', 'very', 'self-assured', 'performance', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'acting-wise', 'Romola', 'Garai', '18-year-old', 'version', 'power', 'cameo', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', ""'Older"", 'Briony', 'how', 'credits', 'are', 'better', 'performances', 'was', 'especially', 'taken', 'Ms.', 'Garai', 'short', 'powerful', 'rendering', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'Briony', 'comprehend', 'what', 'done', 'can', 'not', 'un-do', 'experience', 'clearly', 'etched', 'face', 'performance']",N/A

To me, this makes more sense than ""Atonement"".Nevermind. This is certainly a worthwhile movie - mostly for its production values dipped in real beauty and grandeur (music, cinematography, sets are stunning). Acting is also great. What lags a bit behind is the story itself, which is rather banal and the main conflict somewhat superficial.The main point this movie makes is that you see things differently at 13 and differently at 18 (this happens to the girl named Briony, the centerperson of the plot, whose lies put apart her sister Cee and Cee's almost lover Robbie). The movie also feels just a bit too detached and cold, which probably stems from the nature of Ian McEwan's writing - his other animals are even tougher (e.g. Cement Garden).The film tries hard and indeed achieved quite a lot, including the Best Picture drama Golden Globe for 2007, yet its being beaten by ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" at the Oscars now seems justified to me, although I havent' seen the latter two pictures yet.The final word - despite flaws it's certainly a good film to watch, mostly for its directing approach and film language, which manages to be soundly original for a mainstream movie.

The cinematography alone in this great movie sold me on the way that visual images captured the emotion behind the message.  While Atonement, the movie, is about the tragic separation of two socially mismatched characters who fall in love (Keira's character is upper class, while James's character is the caretaker), the real message lies in the difficulty in explaining complicated, natural emotions and communication between mature adults.  I think that the artistic representation of how natural, human sexuality develops between two consenting adults can be misconstrued by children who are not yet prepared for it.  I think it is a reminder to us that while sexuality is natural and normal, that it is complicated and full of emotions that are much too complicated for children who are unable to process them.This is a beautiful film, and one that I will readily say that I loved every bit as much as the novel!",5,Brilliant Complication of Life,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,1115,"['Having', 'read', 'Atonement', 'graduate', 'school', 'knew', 'complicated', 'issues', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'novel', 'up', 'wondered', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'approach', 'such', 'issues', 'sensitive', 'beautiful', 'manner', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'great', 'movie', 'sold', 'way', 'visual', 'images', 'captured', 'emotion', 'message', 'Atonement', 'movie', 'tragic', 'separation', 'two', 'socially', 'mismatched', 'characters', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'Keira', 'character', 'upper', 'class', 'James', 'character', 'caretaker', 'real', 'message', 'difficulty', 'explaining', 'complicated', 'natural', 'emotions', 'communication', 'mature', 'adults', 'think', 'artistic', 'representation', 'how', 'natural', 'human', 'sexuality', 'two', 'consenting', 'adults', 'can', 'be', 'misconstrued', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'prepared', 'think', 'reminder', 'sexuality', 'natural', 'normal', 'complicated', 'full', 'emotions', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'complicated', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'process', 'them.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'readily', 'say', 'loved', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'novel']",N/A

As an example which may seem too far off topic, I recall visiting a coffee and snack net cafe 2 years ago for a little web surfing on my laptop and a nice espresso coffee.  It was early evening.  The cafe had a few customers.  After settling in I was surprised to see a large group of women, young and old, come in taking up every chair and table.  None of them bought anything nor was there even one laptop among them.  They talked loudly and it was easy to know what they wanted to talk about.  Hating men.  It seemed to be their hobby, their sport.  They were trying to make-up the most wickedly comdemning stories.  I doubt there was any truth in anything they said.The baristas, all 3 were young girls of about 19 or 20, were raging mad.  I talked to one to serve as witness in case the police needed to be called to remove the offenders numbering 40 or more.It wasn't a riot but just plain terrible manners, just completly out of place.  A liars contest with ugly rudeness.  All phony liars. Pathetic but real.Suddenly the group left. Several in the group gave a young and petite barista cruel looks.  I know because she stood only 5 feet away from me.I could go on to describe the mess they left and how the few other customers were affected.  Anyway, it turned out the group had left a woman's meeting at a church to come to the net cafe.I've outlined enough of that incident but another older incident should be mentioned for the sake of the curious reader who understands the theme of liars hurting other people.A girl of 19 was working at a very good job in a big city.  I knew her family so I found out what happened and her mother and younger sister told the events to me.  That girl lost that job because she spread lies about other workers and bosses, mainly men, often claiming harassment.  In reality, she had visits from boyfriends which was against the rules.  She seemed to love lies.Her mother was very ashamed of her.  That daughter seemed to have a life based entirely on the imagination, or as her younger sister said, her sister couldn't tell the difference between truth and lies, doesn't love anything.The two simplied stories of my own telling serve me to declare the theme of the movie bares reasonable resemblance to young girls whose lives are all lies.As the petite barista said, ""They should know better.  What's wrong with them?  Can't trust them.""As I write today, in my opinion, such liars are political, criminal, and boring, very boring.",5,All imagination but cinematography is very good,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,3097,"['spoilers', 'here', 'movie', 'good', 'watch', 'excellent', 'lighting', 'camera', 'work', 'fact', 'story', 'theme', 'made-up', 'fiction', 'interesting', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'point', 'story', 'opinion', 'old', 'member', 'American', 'society', 'think', 'reflection', 'modern', 'attitudes', 'Namely', 'often', 'see', 'hear', 'made-up', 'life', 'women', 'create', 'impress', 'people', 'know', 'movie', 'girl', 'liar', 'lacking', 'common', 'sense', 'know', 'damage', 'sensationalistic', 'lies', 'can', 'do', 'people.Imagination', 'creating', 'evil', 'opinion', 'too', 'common', 'today', 'example', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'topic', 'recall', 'visiting', 'coffee', 'snack', 'net', 'cafe', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'web', 'surfing', 'laptop', 'nice', 'espresso', 'coffee', 'was', 'early', 'evening', 'cafe', 'had', 'few', 'customers', 'settling', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'large', 'group', 'women', 'young', 'old', 'come', 'taking', 'up', 'chair', 'table', 'None', 'bought', 'anything', 'was', 'there', 'even', 'one', 'laptop', 'talked', 'loudly', 'was', 'easy', 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'talk', 'Hating', 'men', 'seemed', 'be', 'hobby', 'sport', 'were', 'trying', 'make-up', 'most', 'wickedly', 'comdemning', 'stories', 'doubt', 'was', 'truth', 'anything', 'said.The', 'baristas', '3', 'were', 'young', 'girls', 'about', '19', '20', 'were', 'raging', 'mad', 'talked', 'one', 'serve', 'witness', 'case', 'police', 'needed', 'be', 'called', 'remove', 'offenders', 'numbering', '40', 'more.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'riot', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'manners', 'just', 'completly', 'place', 'liars', 'contest', 'ugly', 'rudeness', 'phony', 'liars', 'Pathetic', 'real.Suddenly', 'group', 'left', 'Several', 'group', 'gave', 'young', 'petite', 'barista', 'cruel', 'know', 'stood', 'only', '5', 'feet', 'away', 'me.I', 'could', 'go', 'describe', 'mess', 'left', 'how', 'few', 'other', 'customers', 'were', 'affected', 'Anyway', 'turned', 'out', 'group', 'had', 'left', 'woman', 'meeting', 'church', 'come', 'net', 'cafe.I', ""'ve"", 'outlined', 'enough', 'incident', 'older', 'incident', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'sake', 'curious', 'reader', 'who', 'theme', 'liars', 'hurting', 'other', 'people.A', 'girl', '19', 'was', 'working', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'big', 'city', 'knew', 'family', 'so', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'mother', 'younger', 'sister', 'told', 'events', 'girl', 'lost', 'job', 'spread', 'lies', 'other', 'workers', 'bosses', 'mainly', 'men', 'often', 'claiming', 'harassment', 'reality', 'had', 'visits', 'boyfriends', 'was', 'rules', 'seemed', 'love', 'lies.Her', 'mother', 'was', 'very', 'ashamed', 'daughter', 'seemed', 'have', 'life', 'based', 'entirely', 'imagination', 'younger', 'sister', 'said', 'sister', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'truth', 'lies', ""n't"", 'love', 'anything.The', 'two', 'simplied', 'stories', 'own', 'telling', 'serve', 'declare', 'theme', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'resemblance', 'young', 'girls', 'lives', 'are', 'lies.As', 'petite', 'barista', 'said', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'What', 'wrong', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'write', 'today', 'opinion', 'such', 'liars', 'are', 'political', 'criminal', 'boring', 'very', 'boring']",N/A

But since it is a British period piece based on a prestigious novel, a lot of people went nuts over it.  Essentially the plot deals with a young girl, who driven by jealousy, tells a lie that ends up ruining the lives of two people.  The title, as you have probably gathered, refers to her attempts to atone for this one mistake.  There are lots of things wrong with this movie.  For starters, the acting isn't up to the material.  James McAvoy and Keira Knightley fizzle in the lead roles.  The central plot device, i.e. the lie that destroys their lives, is rather unplausible.  It seems to me that any kind of real detective work would have revealed the truth.  But the biggest problem is that the movie is emotionally empty.  Shouldn't a film that deals with a character's guilt and remorse sting with the ache of regret and sorrow?  You never feel anything for any of these characters.  It's only in the final moments, when Vanessa Redgrave shows up that the film generates any real emotion.

1143202,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0013K7ZPE,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","With multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype, I decided to check out ATONEMENT strictly to see what all the hubbub was about. Is it over-hyped or does it stand out as ""The Best Picture of 2007""?The answer is both yes and no.Visually it a feast for the eyes. The routing of the English army into Dunkirk is nothing short of amazing. Let me clarify that, too. We don't see the battle leading to Dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness. The crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding, and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen. This was the most intense sequence in the entire film. It was also shot in a most uncommon way, with the camera initially following James McAvoy's character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own, but returns to McAvoy later. An interesting way to shoot this series of events.The costumes, sets, and props were perfect. There was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically I enjoyed the woolen army uniforms, the streets of early London, and the nursing uniforms the young women wore (again, all perfect).The acting was good. James McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) steals most of the show as the good-natured but ultimately wronged Robbie Turner, an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley,Pirates of the Caribbean). Knightley does a fair job as Cecilia, a young woman in love with Robbie, a man far beneath her station. When Robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime, Cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with Robbie.But more powerful than Knightley was Romola Garai who plays her sister Briony. Briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning Robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child. It is Briony who really rules the movie, giving us her fervent wish for ""atonement"" later in life after realizing what damage she's caused both Robbie and her sister.The powerful Vanessa Redgrave (Venus) plays the aged Briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile Briony's wish for atonement are. Although Mrs. Redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film, it is only a few minutes. There've been rumors that she'll garner some award for this performance, but I hope that these rumors are unfounded. Don't get me wrong; she did a fine job. But her brief performance doesn't warrant any kind of prize.Listing the good above, I have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one. This is a war story, something we've seen time and again. Director Joe Wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time, but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar with.That said, one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending. If you're looking for a feel-good, man-returns-home-and-marries-girl-and-they-have-fifty-grandkids kind of movie, this one isn't going to make your happy tears list.This is a mixed bag as far as films go. An overused premise with some uniquely new ideas.But is it ""The Best Film of 2007""? It does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to Romola Garai. But it's not the best.

1143214,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0013K7ZPE,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 4]","""Atonement"" is all about regret and loss, about how the words of one person can so painfully and irreversibly change the course of someone else's life. When it comes to the three main characters, there's no clear hero or villain. This is especially true of Briony Tallis: at age thirteen (Saoirse Ronan), she falsely accused her sister's lover of something he didn't do; at age eighteen (Romola Garai), her attempts to reconcile are flatly rejected. It's difficult to say whether or not her apology should have been accepted, because in all honesty, I'm not sure she deserved forgiveness. On the same token, her apology is genuine, so maybe her sister, Cecilia (Kiera Knightley), is being far too irrational. That's the beauty of this film--it doesn't pressure you into feeling one way or another about the characters. It merely presents them as they are, and how they should be perceived is left up to the individual.Based on Ian McEwan's novel, the story opens in England in 1935, in which Briony and Cecilia live in a sprawling countryside manor without any cares in the world. It's immediately established that Briony is an aspiring writer. This is not only because of the film's score, which uses a typewriter as a percussion instrument; the opening few shots show her typing the final few sentences of her play, one that she wishes her three visiting cousins to perform. She eventually looks out the window and misinterprets what she sees: Cecilia and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)--the estate's gardener--are arguing in front of a large fountain, and in the course of the argument, Cecilia strips to her underwear and plunges into the water. Briony has no idea what her sister is doing, but from the look in her eyes, it's obvious she thinks Robbie has done something bad to her.And she uses that moment against him later on, when Robbie's error comes back to haunt him. We see the very same fountain scene from Cecilia and Robbie's point of view, which clearly shows nothing improper taking place; their argument was over something so trivial that it doesn't even bear mentioning. Later on in his room, Robbie types several drafts of an apology note. One of the drafts used some naughty language, meaning that no one was ever meant to read it. Unfortunately, Robbie mistakenly seals that draft in an envelope, after which he asks Briony to deliver it to Cecilia. Briony reads the note and concludes that Robbie is a sex maniac, a label only strengthened when she discovers him and Cecilia in an embarrassing situation. Briony also witnesses the rape of her preteen cousin, Lola (Juno Temple), and when the police arrive, she points the finger at Robbie. He's immediately arrested, and at that point, all he and Cecilia have is their love for each other.The story then flashes forward four years. By then, Robbie is a soldier fighting in World War II; in the midst of bullets, blood, and death, his thoughts dwell only on Cecilia, who he has only seen once since the night he was arrested. Now a nurse, Cecilia only wants Robbie to come back to her, despite the fact that his good name has forever been ruined, both socially and legally. Robbie would like nothing more, and he reminds himself of his promise as he moves from place to place with his fellow soldiers. In his mind, people and places are becoming more and more distorted, and reality seems to be slipping away from him. It could be that his longing for his lost love is so strong that all else is irrelevant. It could be that reality is so disillusioning that fantasy is all he has left. Or maybe the gaping wound on his chest has gotten infected, making his brain sick with fever. Whatever the case, Cecilia is his only source of comfort in a very uncomfortable world.Briony, meanwhile, has given up on college to become a nurse, like her sister. Naturally, the two haven't spoken in a few years, but because Briony now understands the magnitude of her false accusation, she tries desperately to find Cecilia and apologize. Her guilty conscience pushes her back into her writing, her first manuscript beginning with a foolish girl witnessing her sister and her sister's lover by a fountain. At this point, she doesn't know whether or not it will be finished--she tends to doubt it, not only because of the pain she feels, but also because she doesn't yet know how the story will end.The same tactic is used for the film's story, which concludes with an elderly Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) being interviewed about her latest novel, ""Atonement."" I can't describe in detail what happens, nor can I closely examine what she says; far too much would be given away. What I can say is that the ending is emotionally charged and beautifully balanced with the beginning. In essence, the entire film shows how guilt can force someone on a journey, one that doesn't necessarily lead to happiness but definitely to maturity. What a draining journey to take, for both the characters and the audience. ""Atonement"" is without a doubt one of the year's best films, a beautiful yet heartbreaking story of love, anger, and the notion that forgiveness is not at all easy to earn.",5,"To Err is Human, to

I have never read the book, but after watching the movie I now plan to.All the cast does their job well. James McAvoy and Keira Knightley are very believable as the films romance that is ripped apart by the jealously and anger, or maybe confusion, of a child named Briony. Briony is played in the film at three different stages of her life by three different actresses. As much I like the performances of the romantics leads, the film's three best performances are all of the character Briony. It's real a feat to be seen how seamless the character transfers from one actress to another. In a way the film is more about Briony, what she did and the guilt that follows, than about anything else.This film takes you from an affluent family's estate, to the evacuation of Dunkirk, to war hospital, all wonderfully stages and superbly shot, and laced with a terrific score.

While there were some aspects of the book that were left out, they were largely inconsequential and did nothing to effect the plot in any material way.  What I enjoyed most about the film version is that I found the ending to be much more satisfying.Having Briony be celebrated in front of her family for her years of successful writing, as portrayed in the book, is compared to the film ending a flawed way of ending this tale.  While presenting the novel in front of her friends and family could more appropriately be called ""atonement"" for those long ago sins that she committed, I found that the image portrayed of her in the film, that of a lonely old writer giving a final television interview to a single reporter while also publicly speaking of her impending dementia, conveyed the appropriate emotion to the audience.  In the film she appears to have suffered great internal emotional turmoil throughout her life due to the guilt that she was never able to reconcile, while in the book I had the feeling that, although troubled with her guilt, she was never really greatly troubled by her crime.

1143218,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B0013K7ZPE,Classic Movie watcher,"[1, 2]","The first hour of the movie is impressive. The cinematography, the editing (twice with the same scene told from two different perspectives, one observed from Briony, the young sister and one showing what actually happened), the score (with typewriter providing the background sound) and the young sister's steadfast gaze and focused attitude all make an excellent presentation.Then the second hour moved to the war in 1940, both in Europe and in London. A drastic change in the mood. Visually stunning and touching. Especially when Vanessa Redgrave as the old Briony disclosed everything that happened after her lie in 1935 - the truth as well as what she had hoped for.I would say this is a good and thought provoking movie. But I can't help feeling what's holding it back from being a better one.(a)It's very Joe Wright - it bears too close a resemblance to Pride and Prejudice in the first hour, in portraying the life of the Tallis family in the English countryside. In so doing, the movie lacks its signature tone and is somehow masked by the director's previous work.(b)I wish I had not seen Pride and Prejudice and Miss Potter (with Keira Knightley, James Mcavoy and Brenda Blethyn already in the cast in addition to the same visually stunning portrayal of the English countryside). Atonement could then have made a refreshing and fluid story telling movie that stands out on its own.(c)While Saoirse Ronan (young Briony) and James Mcavoy (as Robbie) are superb, Keira Knightly (as Cecilia) is not in the same league. She has the beauty but somehow her determined and firm look make her inner feelings unable to surface completely, short of what Saoirse Ronan and James Mcavoy have achieved. She could have delivered more subtlety and depth to her character. Maybe some part of the Elizabeth (Pride and Prejudice) still lingers in her or maybe the director finds that already adequate? James Mcavoy, on the other hand, has pulled off a wonderful performance. Juno Temple (as Lola, Briony's cousin) is also impressive. She got to portray the young and the grown up Lola. It's unfortunate that Saiorse cannot do likewise and continue her captivating screen presence.That being said, Atonement is still worth watching.

1143219,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0013K7ZPE,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 5]","While some might balk at my title and dismiss it, it's a good a descriptor of the film as any that's not necessarily criticising though I wasn't the biggest fan of it either. It's not that I'm against films geared more towards the better half but I usually find those films unbelievably melodramatic and even at times manipulative that it's as if the film wants to do anything it can to make you walk out in tears, saying how amazing the film was. Director Joe Wright's last film, Pride and Prejudice, is similar but here it's better handled but it's still not as great as it was made to be.It's 1935 and Cecilia is living in the beautiful countryside with her family during summer vacation awaiting the arrival of her brother. Sister Briony is a precocious and aspiring writer who's just finished her latest play she wants to put on for the arrival. But witnessing Cecilia and love Robbie as well as reading a letter, Briony feels dejected since she too feels something for Robbie so when she finds a terrible event happening at night, she blames Robbie. 5 years later and choosing World War II rather than prison, Briony tries to make amends and bring together the 2 she helped separate.Every Oscars there's usually that one film that was well-received by critics and ends up being nominated for Best Picture even though there's probably no chance that it'll win the top prize. Atonement is to me the same type of film since others released last year were better but getting a nod meant lots of attention would be paid towards it. While it is well directed and written, there's nothing really about it that makes it better than any film released last year so it brings unfair judgments. The first half is flawless in its pace and story but then the war stuff comes, we get a time jump and it's either too sluggish or it's too surface-level and not enough depth.What most people remember about the film is a huge tracking shot halfway in that shows thousands of extras, a huge set complete with a choir, ferris wheel and the like. While it's certainly a long, complicated and impressive shot, there's something too ""look what we can do"" about it that makes it more showing off rather than Children of Men which used it to actually tell the story at the same time. But the film, with its gorgeous cinematography and unique Academy award winning score (which I felt was given mainly for its inventive use of a typewriter clacking than it being the best score) doesn't really excel at doing romance perfectly.Acting-wise everyone is solid with Keira Knightley still taking on projects to prove she can act, James Mcavoy showing he can have a bright future but the standout is Saoirse Ronan playing young Briony showing a naivety-yet-intelligence without being one of those know-it-all brats you wish someone would slap. My one knock with the Briony character is that with her 2 elder counterparts, played by Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, they give her the same haircut and it feels like they didn't trust the actresses enough to do the different parts so they just made them have the same hair as if haircuts and old age ended up giving the same results anyway. Small complaint but still.I would recommend the film to women definately while for the guys I would for those who don't mind the melodramaticness of the story.

A powerful film, Atonement is a complicated and fruitful adaption of Ian McEwan's novel of the same name that Director Joe Wright carried out masterfully. The story focuses on numerous themes (that I will not spoil for anyone who has yet to see this gem) that anyone can relate to, and it serves as a reminder of what power not only the spoken word can have on a person's life, but also the written word as well, as recorded by recent headlines. It offers breathtaking cinematography that could only be improved by the HD transfer of the film and brilliant performances by an incredible cast that no one should miss.  Actors Kiera Knightley, James McAvoy, Saoirse Ronan, and Romola Garai ignite the screen with the emotional depth and characterizations that each bring to their portrayals, with a powerful close of the film with the astonishing and always captivating performance of Vanessa Redgrave. Universal has performed incredible work in the past with their Blu-ray transfers of films like Hellboy 2, Wanted, and the Bourne trilogy, and with a resume like that, we can confidently acknowledge that this film's presentation on Blu-ray will be top notch.

Eager to act it out to everyone, she is disappointed that her cousins seem not so enthusiastic about it and there are other things going on in her household that take the attention away from her unique accomplishment.  She has a crush on Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son, and she is not too thrilled when she sees something from her window.  It appears there is something going on between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie, and this is further confirmed when she reads a letter from Robbie to Cecilia, a rather explicit letter that he hadn't meant to send out in the first place.  What transpires is a story of betrayal, misunderstanding and deception, one in which two young lovers are torn apart and live tragic lives.  Actions have consequences, and Briony, now eighteen (played by Ramola Garai) is living it.  Will she be able to make things right for Cecelia and Robbie?  Will she be forgiven and, in turn, find peace?The film is absolutely beautiful.  Joe Wright, whose work I'd seen previously in Pride & Prejudice, has an eye for beautiful landscapes and overall flawless cinematography.  The setting (mid to late 1930s, amid the dawn of WWII), the costumes and scenery are gorgeous.  The script is fairly faithful to the book, much more faithful than the director and screenwriter had been with P&P;, where they took far too much artistic license.  The acting is wonderful as well.  I am officially a big fan of James McAvoy.  Not only is the Scottish actor extremely attractive, but he is also a wonderful actor.  I had seen him in Becoming Jane and The Last King of Scotland, and this further proves that he is talented man with a promising Hollywood career.  As for Keira Knightley... It's not that I don't like her, or that I think she's a bad actress, but I simply cannot understand her.  Literally, I cannot understand half the words that come out of her pouty little mouth.  She talks too fast, and kind of mumbles, and I have to turn on the DVD's subtitles in order to grasp her words.  I don't usually have a difficult time understanding the various British accents, so I think it is more a matter of a diction problem from her.  Other than that, I think she did a fine job as well.  The film moved me, and I was saddened by its poignant ending.  The one thing I complain about is that Cecelia and Robbie were not together long enough to make me believe in this star-crossed romance and intense love for each other.  I simply didn't see enough of it on the screen.  I know the purpose is that they did not get to spend enough time together, and that they had been torn apart before the romance could begin, but still.The DVD is good.  It surprised me that the film has an analog 1.85 widescreen format instead of the smaller 2.35 aspect ratio, which I would have preferred (image is clearer and sharper).  I enjoyed the deleted scenes and commentary.  All in all, Atonement is a wonderful film.  It deserved all of the award nominations it has received and this is one DVD I'll be watching over and over again.",4,"Beautifully told story, gorgeous cinematography, but insufficient romance...",1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,3177,"['Thirteen-year-old', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'who', 'completed', 'very', 'first', 'play', 'Eager', 'act', 'out', 'everyone', 'disappointed', 'cousins', 'seem', 'not', 'so', 'enthusiastic', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'going', 'household', 'take', 'attention', 'away', 'unique', 'accomplishment', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'housekeeper', 'son', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'when', 'something', 'window', 'something', 'going', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Robbie', 'further', 'confirmed', 'when', 'letter', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'rather', 'explicit', 'letter', 'had', ""n't"", 'meant', 'send', 'out', 'first', 'place', 'What', 'story', 'betrayal', 'misunderstanding', 'deception', 'one', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'live', 'tragic', 'lives', 'Actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'Briony', 'now', 'eighteen', 'played', 'Ramola', 'Garai', 'living', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Cecelia', 'Robbie', 'Will', 'be', 'forgiven', 'turn', 'find', 'peace', 'film', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'work', ""'d"", 'seen', 'previously', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'overall', 'flawless', 'cinematography', 'setting', 'mid', 'late', '1930s', 'dawn', 'WWII', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'script', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'been', 'P', 'P', 'where', 'took', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'artistic', 'license', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'officially', 'big', 'fan', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Not', 'only', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'also', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'had', 'seen', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'further', 'talented', 'man', 'promising', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'bad', 'actress', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'Literally', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'words', 'come', 'pouty', 'little', 'mouth', 'too', 'fast', 'kind', 'mumbles', 'have', 'turn', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'order', 'grasp', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'understanding', 'various', 'British', 'accents', 'think', 'more', 'matter', 'diction', 'problem', 'Other', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'moved', 'was', 'saddened', 'poignant', 'ending', 'one', 'thing', 'complain', 'Cecelia', 'Robbie', 'were', 'not', 'together', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'star-crossed', 'romance', 'intense', 'love', 'other', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'screen', 'know', 'purpose', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'together', 'had', 'been', 'torn', 'apart', 'romance', 'could', 'begin', 'still.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'surprised', 'film', 'analog', '1.85', 'widescreen', 'format', 'instead', 'smaller', '2.35', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'image', 'clearer', 'sharper', 'enjoyed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Atonement', 'wonderful', 'film', 'deserved', 'award', 'nominations', 'received', 'one', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'over', 'again']",N/A

Slipman,"[2, 2]","The cinematographically spectacular film ""Atonement"" was a marvelous adaptation of the passionate Ian McEwan novel set in 1930's pre-war England.  The onset of the film is set in a majestic English countryside estate where the privileged Tallis family reside.  Young sister Briony, a talented writer, played impressively by Saoirse Ronan is immaturely competing for the affections of James McAvoy playing Robbie Turner, son of the family housekeeper with her older sister Cecilia played by Keira Knightley.  McAvoy had been mentored by the Tallis family, sent to Cambridge and about to enter medical school.  The subdued relationship between Knightley and McAvoy smoldered during a erotic lovemaking scene in the library unfortunately witnessed by the jealous Briony.  The smitten 13 year old had her revenge by unjustly implicating McAvoy for a sexual assault on her cousin Lola who had been staying at the estate.  McAvoy is dragged away from the tender embrace of Knightley to prison in handcuffs.The film then fast forwards four years to Northern France where McAvoy and two mates are trudging through the fields retreating to the amazingly filmed mad pandemonium of Dunkirk.  Released from prison to fight in the army, McAvoy and Knightley, a London based nurse still communicate and pine for each other.  Briony now a nurse in training realizes the tragedy her lies have spawned, separating the two lovers. She tries to make ammends and re-establish communication with her sister.  Using flashbacks and flashforwards the story plays out though the chewed up battlefields of Europe and bomb plagued streets of London.The conclusion of this film reveals that an aged Briony played by Vanessa Redgrave an accomplished and prolific author is touting her ultimate novel and lifelong labor ""Atonement"". She fills in the blanks of this tear jerker love story and her regrets of the effects of her actions.Kudos to McAvoy whose portrayal of the humble, disgraced Robbie should propel him in stardom.

""That dress is lovely on you.""  But sometimes those lies change the course of our lives in terrible ways.This is the story of ""Atonement"".  Briony is a young English girl who is very much infatuated with the gardener, Robbie.  But after intercepting a dirty letter Robbie has written about Briony's sister, Cecelia, and seeing the two making out in the library, Briony is enraged.  So enraged that when her cousin, Lola, is raped, she lies and says that Robbie was the culprit.  Robbie is sent to prison and then to war.  Cecelia, heart broken, leaves her well-off family for London.  And Briony becomes a nurse.The film is a beautiful period piece.  The actors and actresses fit perfectly with the time period.  The clothes, technology, settings and surroundings are so perfect, that never once did I question what era the film was portraying.The actresses chosen to play Briony are perfect, particularly (considering her lack of experience) the little girl.  She conveys the gravity of the movie well.  Vanessa Redgrave shines as the older woman who attempts to atoned for her childish actions.  And Romola Garai blends the young and old seemlessly (I am a little surprised she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award to my knowledge).One of the most unsatisifying aspects of the movie was how the plot was pieced together.  A very important piece (how much Briony likes Robbie) does not appear until late into the second act.  This is important because without it, you truly do think that Briony has seen Robbie (or at least, I did).  Also, too much time is spent on how bad the war is (I got it within the first few minutes), and some scenes make no sense (Briony with the soldier).Next, I felt no chemistry between Cecelia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy).  Robbie hints at feelings to Cecelia (namely through a dirty letter, which would turn on very few ladies this one included), but the scene in the library does not show their love for each other.  It feels like perfunctory sex.  Later on, I feel more of their chemistry, but by then the story is over.Noteworthy is that this movie does have its fair share of foul language (the f-word and a c-word that appears on screen several times) and a pretty intense sex scene.  Violence includes a view inside a hospital, death, a rape, explosions, and other war time images.Overall, I ended the movie more confused than when I began.  I understand film is art, but I would at least like to be able to understand on a basic level what happened when the movie was over.  It took me quite a bit of talking to figure out how Briony attempted to atone for her actions (weak, but very indicative of her character).  Furthermore, the war time images (Okay, already, Robbie is in the war!) really added little to the film for me.  Beautiful cinematography, weak story, weak characters.  2 stars.Brought to you by*C.S.

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 2]","With the sweep of an epic and the intimacy of romance, Atonement comes across as a pretty good piece of period filmmaking until its devastating truths elevate the film to even greater heights.  Joe Wright, who is becoming the torchbearer to period filmmakers, Ivory and Merchant (Room with a View), has been down this path before with his terrific Pride and Prejudice.It is 1935 at a wealthy estate in England where two sisters contemplate life. The older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is at odds with the housekeeper's grown son, Robbie (James McAvoy).  The younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is an impressionable teen and budding writer.  Cecilia's brother, Leon, arrives with a male friend, Paul, who takes keen interest in some children staying at the home.  One evening, a passion erupts between Cecilia and Robbie that is interrupted by Briony.  Later that night a girl is brutally assaulted by an unknown assailant.  The subsequent allegations will have tragic consequences.  The story shifts between London where Cecilia is a nurse and Dunkirk where Robbie fights to survive the early stages of World War II.  The couple struggle to be reunited from afar even as a maturing Briony comes to terms with her past deeds. It is only later in life that she faces her guilt by paying tribute to the undying love of a tragic couple.Atonement sets out to be an ambitious undertaking of love corrupted by outside forces and those from within as it spans the decades. It shows how mere words can hurt in ways that cannot be imagined.  In this, the plot is not dissimilar to The Children's Hour where a child's words hurt deeply.  The story focuses less about the horror and effects of war, and more on the purging and cleansing of sins.  Briony chooses to deal with her misrepresentations and redeems herself with a final act of poetic justice (think Titanic), even if it takes a lifetime.The film suffers a bit from confusing points of view as seen through the eyes of Briony by replaying the same scene to depict her point of view.  What remains somewhat unclear are her motives.  Is she jealous of the love between Cecilia and Robbie or is she making wild assumptions based on distortions?The acting is quite good with teen Saoirse Ronan a standout as Briony.  In fact, all three actresses who play Briony at various stages of life are a splendid tandem (much like the tandems in Shine or TV's Life with Judy Garland).Almost functioning as a Greek tragedy, the film most people will compare this to is The English Patient, which is ironic because there is a scene that has a television interviewer played by Patient's director, Anthony Minghella!  Atonement benefits from some good cinematography (Seamus McGarvey), which depicts some startling, surreal imagery especially in a tracking shot that says all that need be said of the horrifying evacuation of British troops at Dunkirk.  The editing flashes back and forth to make a point or give background, and yet you wonder what is real or imagined.  The musical score (Dano Marianelli) is in keeping with the dramatic mood quite nicely.By the finale, we get to have an ending of sorts. Is it reality or the fabrication of an author's guilt-ridden imagination? One thing is for sure: the feelings of longing and love are real.  Atonement is like reading an epic romance novel with a bit of Jane Austen thrown in for good measure.  As such, it's pretty compelling.",4,ATONEMENT and the Power of Love and Lies,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3423,"['sweep', 'epic', 'intimacy', 'romance', 'Atonement', 'across', 'pretty', 'good', 'piece', 'period', 'filmmaking', 'devastating', 'truths', 'elevate', 'film', 'even', 'greater', 'heights', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'who', 'becoming', 'torchbearer', 'period', 'filmmakers', 'Ivory', 'Merchant', 'Room', 'View', 'been', 'down', 'path', 'terrific', 'Pride', 'Prejudice.It', '1935', 'wealthy', 'estate', 'England', 'where', 'two', 'sisters', 'contemplate', 'life', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'odds', 'housekeeper', 'grown', 'son', 'Robbie', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'younger', 'sister', 'Briony', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'impressionable', 'teen', 'budding', 'writer', 'Cecilia', 'brother', 'Leon', 'male', 'friend', 'Paul', 'who', 'keen', 'interest', 'children', 'staying', 'home', 'One', 'evening', 'passion', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'interrupted', 'Briony', 'Later', 'night', 'girl', 'brutally', 'assaulted', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'subsequent', 'allegations', 'will', 'have', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'story', 'shifts', 'London', 'where', 'Cecilia', 'nurse', 'Dunkirk', 'where', 'Robbie', 'survive', 'early', 'stages', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'couple', 'struggle', 'be', 'reunited', 'afar', 'even', 'maturing', 'Briony', 'terms', 'past', 'deeds', 'only', 'later', 'life', 'guilt', 'paying', 'tribute', 'undying', 'love', 'tragic', 'couple.Atonement', 'out', 'be', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'love', 'corrupted', 'outside', 'forces', 'decades', 'how', 'mere', 'words', 'can', 'hurt', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'imagined', 'plot', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'Children', 'Hour', 'where', 'child', 'words', 'hurt', 'deeply', 'story', 'less', 'horror', 'effects', 'war', 'more', 'purging', 'cleansing', 'sins', 'Briony', 'deal', 'misrepresentations', 'final', 'act', 'poetic', 'justice', 'think', 'Titanic', 'even', 'lifetime.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'bit', 'confusing', 'points', 'view', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Briony', 'replaying', 'same', 'scene', 'depict', 'point', 'view', 'What', 'somewhat', 'unclear', 'are', 'motives', 'jealous', 'love', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'making', 'wild', 'assumptions', 'based', 'distortions', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'teen', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'standout', 'Briony', 'fact', 'three', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Briony', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'are', 'splendid', 'tandem', 'much', 'tandems', 'Shine', 'TV', 'Life', 'Judy', 'Garland', '.Almost', 'functioning', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'compare', 'English', 'Patient', 'ironic', 'scene', 'television', 'interviewer', 'played', 'Patient', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'Atonement', 'benefits', 'good', 'cinematography', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'startling', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'especially', 'tracking', 'shot', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'horrifying', 'evacuation', 'British', 'troops', 'Dunkirk', 'editing', 'flashes', 'back', 'forth', 'make', 'point', 'give', 'background', 'yet', 'wonder', 'what', 'real', 'imagined', 'musical', 'score', 'Dano', 'Marianelli', 'keeping', 'dramatic', 'mood', 'quite', 'finale', 'get', 'have', 'ending', 'sorts', 'reality', 'fabrication', 'author', 'guilt-ridden', 'imagination', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'feelings', 'longing', 'love', 'are', 'real', 'Atonement', 'reading', 'epic', 'romance', 'novel', 'bit', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'such', 'pretty', 'compelling']",N/A

Not by Joe Wright and his cohort of actors particularly Vanessa Redgrave at the end; Good lord, what a beautiful woman!  Real actors do not hide their inner selves by their acting, they reveal it.), all beautifully done; no complaints at all on that score.  What I didn't like was how essentially small-scale, in human terms, the whole thing was.  SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON.  The initial act of injustice was really no more than a Freudian morality play (a hybrid of the Medieval genre and Freud/Breuer's *Studies on Hysteria*), but the consequences of that act, the suffering it creates, is massively upstaged by the war, and scenes from the war.  Injustice?  Everyone involved in the war is suffering terrible injustice as a consequence of being forced by circumstance into participation.  Young life, young love, and even just plain old young sex is cut off, cruelly terminated by both injustices, but how many tens of thousands of virgins died in the war, not just sexual virgins but with virgin hearts, and the latter true of how many women whose hearts were violated and forever changed by all the ugliness unfolding around them?All of this, however, is redeemed by the ending which, as in Coleridge's *Ancient Mariner*, is also the beginning.  The whole story has not been about the two star-crossed lovers, but about Briony's lifetime burden of guilt, and her pitiful but beautifully authentic effort at atonement by telling the story (and creating her pitiful ""happy ending""), as she herself is dying.  It is pitifully inadequate, and she knows it, but she says, in effect, 'this is the best I can do.'  And none of us, we realize, can do any better.  I don't believe in original sin, but I do believe in an 'origin' disconnect between human aspirations and our instinctive sense of the possibility of an ideal life in an ideal world (""I have immortal longings in me,"" as Cleopatra says in Shakespeare's *Antony and Cleopatra*) on the one hand, and Freud's grim 'reality principle' on the other.  For the human condition, as lived in this world, there can be no atonement.

If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review.""Atonement"" is an intelligent, scrupulously crafted film boasting lovely images and high production values. It is also cold, antiseptic, and artificial.""Atonement""'s best feature is the chemistry between the aristocratic Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and her family's servant, Robbie (James McAvoy). McAvoy, especially, is a revelation. One hopes that he will be handed many more roles, and soon, in which he can do what he did here: play a dreamy-eyed, innocent and young slave to passion.""Atonement""'s opening scenes telegraph that its major focus is not love or even human beings; rather, ""Atonement""'s focus is the problems facing writers. ""Atonement"" is an intellectual exercise, an essay on the writer's life, and the role of fiction.""Atonement"" opens with a shot of an English manor house. But, wait - it's not a manor house at all, but a dollhouse replica, in the bedroom of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old upper class English girl and playwright. And, so, the frame, the point of view, and the theme of the movie is set. This won't be a story about its ostensible main characters - the lovers Cecilia and Robbie, at all - rather it is a story focused on Briony telling a story that suits her needs and desires.Symbolism is portentous and beats the viewer on the head - almost literally. Since the movie is all about the job of the fiction writer, the sound of typewriter keys striking paper, a ball striking a wall, heels clicking down a hallway, all segue into the soundtrack's savage drumbeat percussion. There is plenty of water symbolism, including Briony - pronounced ""briney""'s - name. Also much is made of light. The opening daytime scenes, at the English manor house, are overexposed. Briony is lead to a fateful encounter thanks to a shiny pin. A desk lamp blinds her and distorts what she sees. With all this light and water, you may want to bring your sunscreen.Briony is that most clich&eacute;d of characters - a straight-laced English female who superficially recoils from sex but secretly burns with passion and jealousy. (Did Ronan prepare by watching Deborah Kerr movies?)Briony's self-control is stereotypically destructive. Briony's bedroom wallpaper depicts pullulating foliage. A bee, symbol of something sweet - honey - dangerous, and female - beats, loudly, percussively, against Briony's bedroom window. One thinks of ""High Wind to Jamaica"" and other English works in which a cosseted English girl wreaks havoc once her inner savage is let out.Briony believes that Robbie is guilty of assaulting a child, Lola. Lola was assaulted, but she and Briony accuse the wrong man. In short, females are guilty when men violate them. On Briony's word alone, Robbie is parted from his love, Cecilia, and sent to prison. This is not presented convincingly. Robbie had an alibi - he had been rescuing two lost boys, as the boys can attest. Too, he is his master's prize; though the son of a scullery maid, his master is sending him to medical school. And, Cecilia loves him. Why the courts would take the word of a 13-year-old known fabulist against that of her better educated and older sister is never made clear.A good movie could have explored how the courts were weighted against a working class man accused of assault, and on Cecilia's sticking by her working class lover in spite of everything, but ""Atonement"" simply cheats; it skips the work of its own plot, and jumps to the 1940 English retreat from the Nazis at Dunkirk. Exposition informs us that Robbie had gotten out of prison by joining the army. Film fans have made much of the five-and-a-half minute long, single-take tracking shot of the chaotic scene on the beach, with English forces shooting their horses and destroying equipment in order that it might not fall into Nazi hands.While watching this scene, I thought to myself, ""Well, we've just left the movie."" Nothing in this Dunkirk tracking shot does anything to advance previous narrative or themes. It's as if the author ran out of ideas and said, ""Hey, wasn't there a very cinematic war going on nearby at this very time? Let's nip over to France for a while and exploit the wartime scenery.""Robbie dies of war wounds while waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. Cecilia dies when a tube station is flooded (more water symbolism).Years later, Briony, now Vanessa Redgrave (would that we all morphed into Vanessa Redgrave as we aged) is a famous novelist and is telling the story on a TV talk show. With one change - in her fictionalized memoir of the events, Briony has provided a happy ending. She allows her characters, Robbie and Cecilia, to survive the war, and to retire to a lovely, sunny beach house (more light and water) where they spend their days gazing into each other's eyes and smooching. Briony, you see, has been eaten up with guilt for having accused Robbie of a crime he did not commit. To make up for that, to ""atone"" for ruining her sister and her sister's lover's lives, Briony writes a happy novel based on their experiences.Which is all very clever. And, as evidenced by reviews here, for many viewers, it's very moving. I felt this movie's intellectual, manipulative hand against my chest - in the heavy handed symbolism, in the clich&eacute;d plot devices, and in the underdeveloped characters. The viewer learns nothing about Cecilia or Robbie, except that they are both young and good looking and hot for each other, and that they speak with those posh British accents we've come to associate with quality entertainment.But this must be said again - James McAvoy is brilliant, and should be working, right now, on more and better films.",3,Intelligent and Well Crafted but Overwrought; Best

1143233,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0013K7ZPE,David A. Wend,"[2, 2]","I have not read Ian McEwan's novel so the story and the way it unfolds in without any anticipation on my part. Atonement has a wonderful sense of time and place - the peace just prior to the Second World War.  The early scenes set during a hot summer in 1935 seem like a kind of paradise for Cecilia and Briony Tallis, set amid a beautiful house and gardens; but all is not was idyllic as it seems. There is love and jealousy in the air between Cecilia and her younger sister, a budding writer, over Robbie Turner, the son of their longtime groundskeeper for whom the Tallis family has a liking strong enough to erase class barriers and allow the son of a servant to share dinner with them.  Robbie has great expectations in that he has a promise from Cecilia and Briony's father that he can attend medical school.  Love, however, intervenes and everything changes.James McAvoy as Robbie and Kira Knightly as Cecilia are perfectly cast and their performances sweep us up into their romance.  The young Briony (nicely played by Saoirse Ronan) has her own crush on Robbie that is unrequited, and seeing her sister in love with him turns her jealousy into a tool of punishment when she falsely accuses Robbie of raping a cousin.  The relationships between the three main characters are nicely developed; as much as one is disgusted by Briony's actions one understands the impulse.  To ease her guilt she performs an act of atonement by becoming a nurse (Romola Garai playing the 18 year old Briony) in a London hospital, tending the war wounded and dying.The film has the sweep of an epic with the inclusion of the evacuation of Dunkirk. Surveying the vast scene of destruction, the beach littered with broken down vehicles mirrors the terrible twist that Robbie's life took and we, like all of the stranded men, are hoping that Robbie and Cecilia will be reunited.  We don't know until the end of the film where the various threads of the story have taken us.  The story makes use of flashbacks so we are aware sometimes of what is going to happen before the characters do, but when we arrive at the conclusion of the love story of Cecilia and Robbie we know how bitter a single act of jealous can become and how a thoughtless act can have repercussions for life.  This final phase of Briony's life is marvelously conveyed by Vanessa Redgrave, who sums up the story in an interview.Atonement is beautifully filmed, perhaps the best example of cinematography this year.  I was reminded of the beautiful photography that was characteristic of David Lean's films.  Although the love story may not be as compelling as Jack and Rose in Titanic it is just as deeply felt and is beautifully told.",5,Masterly Story Telling,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,2687,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'novel', 'story', 'way', 'anticipation', 'part', 'Atonement', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'peace', 'just', 'prior', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'early', 'scenes', 'set', 'hot', 'summer', '1935', 'seem', 'kind', 'paradise', 'Cecilia', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'set', 'beautiful', 'house', 'gardens', 'not', 'was', 'idyllic', 'love', 'jealousy', 'air', 'Cecilia', 'younger', 'sister', 'budding', 'writer', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'son', 'longtime', 'groundskeeper', 'whom', 'Tallis', 'family', 'liking', 'strong', 'enough', 'erase', 'class', 'barriers', 'allow', 'son', 'servant', 'share', 'dinner', 'Robbie', 'great', 'expectations', 'promise', 'Cecilia', 'Briony', 'father', 'can', 'attend', 'medical', 'school', 'Love', 'however', 'intervenes', 'everything', 'changes.James', 'McAvoy', 'Robbie', 'Kira', 'Knightly', 'Cecilia', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'performances', 'sweep', 'up', 'romance', 'young', 'Briony', 'nicely', 'played', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'own', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'unrequited', 'seeing', 'sister', 'love', 'jealousy', 'tool', 'punishment', 'when', 'falsely', 'Robbie', 'raping', 'cousin', 'relationships', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'nicely', 'developed', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'disgusted', 'Briony', 'actions', 'one', 'impulse', 'ease', 'guilt', 'act', 'atonement', 'becoming', 'nurse', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'playing', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Briony', 'London', 'hospital', 'tending', 'war', 'wounded', 'dying.The', 'film', 'sweep', 'epic', 'inclusion', 'evacuation', 'Dunkirk', 'Surveying', 'vast', 'scene', 'destruction', 'beach', 'littered', 'broken', 'down', 'vehicles', 'mirrors', 'terrible', 'twist', 'Robbie', 'life', 'took', 'stranded', 'men', 'are', 'hoping', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'will', 'be', 'reunited', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'various', 'threads', 'story', 'have', 'taken', 'story', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'aware', 'sometimes', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'characters', 'do', 'when', 'arrive', 'conclusion', 'love', 'story', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'know', 'how', 'bitter', 'single', 'act', 'jealous', 'can', 'become', 'how', 'thoughtless', 'act', 'can', 'have', 'repercussions', 'life', 'final', 'phase', 'Briony', 'life', 'marvelously', 'conveyed', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'sums', 'up', 'story', 'interview.Atonement', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'perhaps', 'best', 'example', 'cinematography', 'year', 'was', 'reminded', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'was', 'characteristic', 'David', 'Lean', 'films', 'love', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'compelling', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'Titanic', 'just', 'deeply', 'felt', 'beautifully', 'told']",N/A

Read,"[10, 17]","Many years ago, my brother would refer to movies that are trying to be ""art,"" and thereby sacrificing entertainment value, as ""pretentious art-crap.""  Atonement is an example of that.The damage starts with a score that cleverly incorporates the tapping of manual type-writer keystrokes.  Only it isn't clever, its just annoying.  Then the plot takes a turn for the incredible, as an intelligent young man makes a ""mistake"" that no one would ever make unless he wanted to: sending a typed obscene love (or lust) note instead of the more polite handwritten apology that he supposedly intended to send.  Then he gives the pornographic note to a young girl to deliver to her older sister.  Then he has sex with the older sister in an unlocked, public room.  Then he goes to jail becuse the young girl, who has of course read the note and seen the sex, believes him to be a ""sex maniac"" and falsely tells the police that he was present at the scene of a sexual assault (which was not an assault, but consensual).By the way, the film dwells on the young girl's complicity with an injustice, but the two parties most responsible for this gross miscarriage of justice were the grownups having consensual sex who allowed a rape to be confabulated by a silly a young girl.  Why shouldn't they have to make atonement?That's about it.  Oh, if you're wondering about the titular ""atonement,"" there isn't one.  No one ever makes atonement, ever, for these people's life-destroying perjury.  Frankly, the film is nonsense, and keeps getting worse and worse, and the story is not told linearly, but in fits and starts and flashbacks.  The film is this way because ... well, because it is pretentious art crap.Judging from the nominations and the awards for Best Picture of the last couple of years, the Academy voters have a yen for violent, nihilistic films.

Get it at Amazon.]POSSIBLE SPOILERS.There is little I can add to the myriad critics and viewers who have seen this beautifully rendered work of art from the novel by Ian McEwan.  But I want to point to the commanding performance by Vanessa Redgrave at the end in which she tells us what has happened.  She absolutely commands the screen and engages us in such a direct way that we are enthralled and touched.  From an artistic point of view it is interesting that the words she speaks need no embellishment or any acting out.  There are so perfect and her delivery is beyond professional.  It is lived, as is the case with all great acting.I also was very much taken with the performance of Romola Garai who played Briony at 18.  Her face conveyed more than words can tell.  She felt so deeply not just her character's great sin, but the tragedy of the war and the dying she saw all around her and the sense that she could not be forgiven.  Saoirse Ronan, who played Briony as a girl had a hard edge, almost an evil edge to her that was perfect for the part, a kind of ""bad seed"" depiction with her washed out face and small self-importance and her inability to not just understand what she saw and experienced, but her inability to understand herself and to love instead of desiring only to be loved.The way the story is presented with scenes out of chronological order but in psychological and emotional order was most effective.  I was especially impressed with the idea of showing us the scene where Briony pretends to drown and is saved by Robbie after the fact of the great lie she tells.  As presented we immediately understand why she lied.  His anger and failure to understand her childish love for him perhaps worked like the Achilles heel of his character.  Had he been able to love her as one might love a child and help her to understand that he could not love her otherwise, everything might have been different.  Or perhaps not.  In a sense hers was an act of atonement, although not in a positive sense.The epic scenes of the beginning of World War II with the British in retreat and all the bloodshed and waste of war magnified and accentuated, especially the scene with Briony and the dying French soldier Luc, made us understand how precious life was for those who witnessed this while serving as a dramatic and psychological foil for the love and life that Cecilia and Robbie could not experience.I also like the economy with which the essential details of the story were presented.  We see the dramatic scenes and then we understand with just a few words or even a look what actually happened.  For example when Briony as a nurse attends the wedding of Lola and Paul and as the bride and groom walk away we see the shame in their faces, the same shame that Briony feels, only they are not going to own up to it, we know.  And then there is the quick flashback to the scene that Briony as a girl had witnessed and this time her mind allows her to see the man's face.  And then a bit later on in the scene that the author inside the author (Briony) makes up, we understand that there will be no revelation of the truth because a spouse cannot testify against a spouse, or at least in this case would not.And then there is the brilliant ending with Vanessa Redgrave summing it up and tying it all together--but more than that, showing us how Briony grew as she went from childhood to old age.  In fact the emotional and human transformation that takes place in Briony's character is perhaps the central point of the story.  I haven't read the novel by Ian McEwan but I am familiar with his work and know he must have been responsible for such a psychologically compelling development and ending--although it is obvious that the script by Christopher Hampton and the direction by Joe Wright are more than first rate.",5,"Heart-wrenching, beautifully acted and directed",1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,3968,"['[', 'Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', 'POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS.There', 'little', 'can', 'add', 'myriad', 'critics', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'work', 'art', 'novel', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'want', 'point', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'end', 'happened', 'absolutely', 'screen', 'direct', 'way', 'are', 'enthralled', 'touched', 'artistic', 'point', 'view', 'interesting', 'words', 'need', 'embellishment', 'acting', 'out', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'professional', 'lived', 'case', 'great', 'acting.I', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'taken', 'performance', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'who', 'played', 'Briony', '18', 'face', 'conveyed', 'more', 'words', 'can', 'tell', 'felt', 'so', 'deeply', 'not', 'just', 'character', 'great', 'sin', 'tragedy', 'war', 'dying', 'saw', 'sense', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'played', 'Briony', 'girl', 'had', 'hard', 'edge', 'almost', 'evil', 'edge', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'kind', 'bad', 'seed', 'depiction', 'washed', 'out', 'face', 'small', 'self-importance', 'inability', 'not', 'just', 'understand', 'what', 'saw', 'experienced', 'inability', 'understand', 'love', 'instead', 'desiring', 'only', 'be', 'loved.The', 'way', 'story', 'presented', 'scenes', 'chronological', 'order', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'order', 'was', 'most', 'effective', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'idea', 'showing', 'scene', 'where', 'Briony', 'drown', 'saved', 'Robbie', 'fact', 'great', 'lie', 'presented', 'immediately', 'understand', 'why', 'lied', 'anger', 'failure', 'understand', 'childish', 'love', 'perhaps', 'worked', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'character', 'Had', 'been', 'able', 'love', 'one', 'might', 'love', 'child', 'help', 'understand', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'otherwise', 'everything', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'perhaps', 'not', 'sense', 'hers', 'was', 'act', 'atonement', 'not', 'positive', 'sense.The', 'epic', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'British', 'retreat', 'bloodshed', 'waste', 'war', 'magnified', 'accentuated', 'especially', 'scene', 'Briony', 'dying', 'French', 'soldier', 'Luc', 'made', 'understand', 'how', 'precious', 'life', 'was', 'who', 'witnessed', 'while', 'serving', 'dramatic', 'psychological', 'foil', 'love', 'life', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'could', 'not', 'experience.I', 'also', 'economy', 'essential', 'details', 'story', 'were', 'presented', 'see', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'then', 'understand', 'just', 'few', 'words', 'even', 'look', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'example', 'when', 'Briony', 'nurse', 'wedding', 'Lola', 'Paul', 'bride', 'groom', 'walk', 'away', 'see', 'shame', 'same', 'shame', 'Briony', 'feels', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'own', 'up', 'know', 'then', 'quick', 'flashback', 'scene', 'Briony', 'girl', 'had', 'witnessed', 'time', 'mind', 'see', 'man', 'face', 'then', 'bit', 'later', 'scene', 'author', 'author', 'Briony', 'up', 'understand', 'will', 'be', 'revelation', 'truth', 'spouse', 'can', 'not', 'testify', 'spouse', 'least', 'case', 'would', 'not.And', 'then', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'summing', 'tying', 'together', 'more', 'showing', 'how', 'Briony', 'grew', 'went', 'childhood', 'old', 'age', 'fact', 'emotional', 'human', 'transformation', 'place', 'Briony', 'character', 'perhaps', 'central', 'point', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'am', 'familiar', 'work', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'such', 'psychologically', 'compelling', 'development', 'ending', 'obvious', 'script', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'direction', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'are', 'more', 'first', 'rate']",N/A

James McAvoy,who was excellent in ""The Last King of Scotland"" & ""Narnia"", Keira Knightly, and Vanessa Redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews.  However, the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because I had liked Joe Wright's direction in the previous film to this, ""Pride & Prejudice"" also with Keira Knightley.

Two other Ian McEwan works have been adpated to screen with considerably more success: The Comfort of Strangers & The Cement Garden. But this adaptation is to be avoided.The characters are barely there: we know Keira Knightley (whose entire career is all about the pout & swoon) only as the impossibly rich wearer of a particular green dress; and James McAvoy as a brooding, albeit highly cultured, groundskeeper with a crush.  They share a moment or two (one by a fountain & one in a library), and that is all, because all that might have been is spoiled by a jealous little anti-realist sister whose young imagination is always altering & fitting the world around her and the people in it to suit her own needs & desires.  This could have been interesting had the film makers allowed us some access to the writer, or made the writer the least bit attractive or alluring, but we are not given any access to the writer at all, all we come to know of her is that the mature writer uses art as a means of atonement (apparently a proper use of art) for the writers early use of art as a means of crafting fantasies (apparently a sin).The premise of the film hinges on our ability to believe that one little girls word could convict a man despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence is not one that thinking people should buy.This is a film that takes a skeptical attitude toward art and artists. By the end of the film we are supposed to forgive the artist for her trespasses upon the truth (and true love!) but everything about this film is so overblown that we do not find the matured version of this writer (played by no less than Vanessa Redgrave) doing penance to be any more likeable or convincing or knowable than the young snotty upstart version of this writer.Another over-rated effort by the director of Pride & Prejudice.Certainly not deserving of it's Best Picture nomination.",3,"Weak characters, Weak Story",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1993,"['Ian', 'McEwan', 'respect', 'literary', 'community', ""c'mon"", 'weak', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Two', 'other', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'works', 'have', 'been', 'adpated', 'screen', 'considerably', 'more', 'success', 'Comfort', 'Strangers', 'Cement', 'Garden', 'adaptation', 'be', 'avoided.The', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', 'there', 'know', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'entire', 'career', 'pout', 'swoon', 'only', 'impossibly', 'rich', 'wearer', 'particular', 'green', 'dress', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'brooding', 'highly', 'cultured', 'groundskeeper', 'crush', 'share', 'moment', 'two', 'one', 'fountain', 'one', 'library', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'jealous', 'little', 'anti-realist', 'sister', 'young', 'imagination', 'always', 'altering', 'fitting', 'world', 'people', 'suit', 'own', 'needs', 'desires', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'film', 'makers', 'allowed', 'access', 'writer', 'made', 'writer', 'least', 'bit', 'attractive', 'alluring', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'access', 'writer', 'come', 'know', 'mature', 'writer', 'art', 'means', 'atonement', 'apparently', 'proper', 'use', 'art', 'writers', 'early', 'use', 'art', 'means', 'crafting', 'fantasies', 'apparently', 'sin', '.The', 'premise', 'film', 'hinges', 'ability', 'believe', 'one', 'little', 'girls', 'word', 'could', 'convict', 'man', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'innocence', 'not', 'one', 'thinking', 'people', 'should', 'buy.This', 'film', 'skeptical', 'attitude', 'art', 'artists', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'forgive', 'artist', 'trespasses', 'truth', 'true', 'love', 'everything', 'film', 'so', 'overblown', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'matured', 'version', 'writer', 'played', 'less', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'doing', 'penance', 'be', 'more', 'likeable', 'convincing', 'knowable', 'young', 'snotty', 'upstart', 'version', 'writer.Another', 'over-rated', 'effort', 'director', 'Pride', 'Prejudice.Certainly', 'not', 'deserving', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination']",N/A

1143244,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B0013K7ZPE,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[3, 4]","""Atonement"" opens in 1935 in a beautiful English country house on a hot summer day.  A very bright and rather self-important thirteen-year-old girl named Briony Tallis has written a play, and she is inordinately proud of her creation.  Meanwhile, she is extremely upset when she sees her beautiful sister, Cecelia, flirting with Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son.  Briony secretly has a crush on the gorgeous and intelligent Robbie who, thanks to the generosity of her father, has attended Cambridge and hopes to become a doctor.  After a series of fateful events, Briony again spies her sister in a compromising position with Robbie.  When her visiting cousin is attacked, Briony insists that Robbie is the culprit, and on the basis of her eyewitness testimony, he is unjustly imprisoned.Ian McEwan's magnificent novel is a tour de force that examines not only the ugliness of family warfare but also the friction between the working and upper classes and the massive changes that take place in English society as a result of World War II.  In addition, the author explores the power of fiction as a corrective to the ugliness and hopelessness of reality.  The book is both subtle and profound; it captures many small moments that speak volumes about its characters.The movie, directed by Joe Wright, is less ambitious and controlled than McEwan's work, but it is a fairly faithful adaptation.  Christopher Hampton's screenplay adheres to novel's basic plot; of necessity many details are omitted that would have added an hour to the film's running time.  The gorgeous cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is a bit too bright and pretty for a film that deals with lies, betrayals, and the death of one's dreams and ambitions.  The lush score by Dino Marianelli is lovely but there are scenes that would have been more effective had the background music been less intrusive.Keira Knightley oozes sexuality as the saucy Cecelia and James McAvoy is a sensitive and vulnerable Robbie Turner.  After he is jailed, Robbie enlists in the British army to gain his freedom, but he finds army life to be another kind of prison in which death and destruction are his constant companions.  Just as English society is upended by this tragic war, so is the life of this innocent and terribly wronged man.  Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as the young Briony, a bored and high-strung child whose overheated imagination and naivet&eacute; wreak havoc on Robbie and Cecelia's lives.  Romola Garai plays Briony at eighteen, a compassionate young woman who tries to atone for her misdeed by training as a nurse and helping wounded soldiers who are sent home from the front more dead than alive.  Brenda Blethyn is beautifully warm and tender as Robbie's dowdy, hardworking, and loving mother.  Vanessa Redgrave is superb as the elderly Briony, who in calm and measured tones drops a bombshell that will shock those who have never read McEwan's unforgettable story.",4,"""Dearest Cecilia, the story can resume.""",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2941,"['Atonement', 'opens', '1935', 'beautiful', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'very', 'bright', 'rather', 'self-important', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'written', 'play', 'inordinately', 'proud', 'creation', 'Meanwhile', 'extremely', 'upset', 'when', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'Cecelia', 'flirting', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'housekeeper', 'son', 'Briony', 'secretly', 'crush', 'gorgeous', 'intelligent', 'Robbie', 'who', 'thanks', 'generosity', 'father', 'attended', 'Cambridge', 'become', 'doctor', 'series', 'fateful', 'events', 'Briony', 'again', 'sister', 'compromising', 'position', 'Robbie', 'When', 'visiting', 'cousin', 'attacked', 'Briony', 'Robbie', 'culprit', 'basis', 'eyewitness', 'testimony', 'unjustly', 'imprisoned.Ian', 'McEwan', 'magnificent', 'novel', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'not', 'only', 'ugliness', 'family', 'warfare', 'also', 'friction', 'working', 'upper', 'classes', 'massive', 'changes', 'take', 'place', 'English', 'society', 'result', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'addition', 'author', 'power', 'fiction', 'corrective', 'ugliness', 'hopelessness', 'reality', 'book', 'subtle', 'profound', 'many', 'small', 'moments', 'speak', 'volumes', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'less', 'ambitious', 'controlled', 'McEwan', 'work', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'basic', 'plot', 'necessity', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'omitted', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'hour', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'bit', 'too', 'bright', 'pretty', 'film', 'lies', 'betrayals', 'death', 'one', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'lush', 'score', 'Dino', 'Marianelli', 'lovely', 'are', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'had', 'background', 'music', 'been', 'less', 'intrusive.Keira', 'Knightley', 'sexuality', 'saucy', 'Cecelia', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'sensitive', 'vulnerable', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'jailed', 'Robbie', 'British', 'army', 'gain', 'freedom', 'army', 'life', 'be', 'kind', 'prison', 'death', 'destruction', 'are', 'constant', 'companions', 'Just', 'English', 'society', 'upended', 'tragic', 'war', 'so', 'life', 'innocent', 'terribly', 'wronged', 'man', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'wonderful', 'young', 'Briony', 'bored', 'high-strung', 'child', 'overheated', 'imagination', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'havoc', 'Robbie', 'Cecelia', 'lives', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Briony', 'eighteen', 'compassionate', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'atone', 'misdeed', 'training', 'nurse', 'helping', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'home', 'front', 'more', 'dead', 'alive', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'beautifully', 'warm', 'tender', 'Robbie', 'dowdy', 'hardworking', 'loving', 'mother', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'superb', 'elderly', 'Briony', 'who', 'calm', 'measured', 'tones', 'bombshell', 'will', 'shock', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'McEwan', 'unforgettable', 'story']",N/A
1143245,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0013K7ZPE,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","Cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly Briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director Anthony Minghella, who tragically passed away earlier this week. One can surmise that director Joe Wright's use of the estimable filmmaker for a well-placed cameo is something of a tribute to Minghella's work on similarly grandiose epics likeThe English Patient. Minghella would have been an ideal director for Ian McEwan's emotionally complex2002 novel, as would have been David Lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep ofDoctor Zhivagoand the intimacy ofBrief Encounter(especially in the wartime tearoom scene). Regardless, Wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic. Much of the film's measured success has to do with his and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's abiding fidelity to McEwan's time-juggling story structure.The story is actually divided into two discrete parts. The first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling English estate in 1935 as precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening. She idolizes her beautiful older sister Cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeeper's impassioned son Robbie Turner. When she sees the two together at the garden fountain, she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred. Later that evening, Briony makes a false accusation, and Robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison. The second part takes place five years later as Europe is engulfed in WWII. Robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in France, aching over Cecilia while trying to get to Dunkirk in order to return to England. Cecilia has become a nurse, as has a now-grown Briony regretfully estranged from her sister. Where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpected.I'm rather divided on the performances. As the headstrong Cecilia, Keira Knightley evokes old-school glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn, but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses. James McAvoy captures the boyish magnetism of Robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on. Together though, Knightley and McAvoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story. On the other hand, Briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the character's evolving fate. As the adolescent, Saoirse Ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing self-possession. She makes us care about Briony despite her repugnant act of self-interest. Romola Garai takes over as a young, uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a London hospital. Finally, Vanessa Redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaning.All the production values are stunning - Sarah Greenwood's meticulous production design, especially in the Dunkirk scenes; Jacqueline Durran's simply designed period costumes; Dario Marianelli's stirring music score (with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes) and Seamus McGarvey's rich cinematography. Pay particular attention to the uninterrupted five-minute tracking shot at Dunkirk done with a Steadicam, a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in Orson Welles'Touch of Evil. The 2008 DVD has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production - an informative commentary track from Wright; a comprehensive, half-hour making-of documentary, ""Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of `Atonement'""; a five-minute short, ""From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic"", in which Wright, Hampton and McEwan discuss the transition on a cursory level; and seven deleted scenes, about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from Wright.",4,Epic Sweep and Complex Character Arcs Bring Ian McEwan's Masterful Novel to Cinematic Life,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,4052,"['Cineastes', 'will', 'recognize', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'interviewing', 'elderly', 'Briony', 'end', 'sumptuously', 'produced', '2007', 'film', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'who', 'tragically', 'passed', 'away', 'earlier', 'week', 'One', 'can', 'surmise', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'use', 'estimable', 'filmmaker', 'well-placed', 'cameo', 'something', 'tribute', 'Minghella', 'work', 'similarly', 'grandiose', 'epics', 'likeThe', 'English', 'Patient', 'Minghella', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'director', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'emotionally', 'complex2002', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'David', 'Lean', 'film', 'concurrently', 'sweep', 'ofDoctor', 'Zhivagoand', 'intimacy', 'ofBrief', 'Encounter', 'especially', 'wartime', 'tearoom', 'scene', 'Regardless', 'Wright', 'admirable', 'job', 'translating', 'what', 'essentially', 'interior', 'story', 'something', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'Much', 'film', 'measured', 'success', 'do', 'screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'abiding', 'fidelity', 'McEwan', 'time-juggling', 'story', 'structure.The', 'story', 'actually', 'divided', 'two', 'discrete', 'parts', 'first', 'place', 'inauspicious', 'summer', 'day', 'rolling', 'English', 'estate', '1935', 'precocious', '13-year-old', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'play', 'children', 'perform', 'dinner', 'party', 'evening', 'beautiful', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'harbors', 'crush', 'housekeeper', 'impassioned', 'son', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'When', 'two', 'together', 'garden', 'fountain', 'situation', 'more', 'provocative', 'what', 'really', 'occurred', 'Later', 'evening', 'Briony', 'false', 'accusation', 'Robbie', 'up', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'crime', 'sent', 'off', 'prison', 'second', 'part', 'place', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Europe', 'engulfed', 'WWII', 'Robbie', 'moved', 'prisoner', 'foot', 'soldier', 'France', 'aching', 'over', 'Cecilia', 'trying', 'get', 'Dunkirk', 'order', 'return', 'England', 'Cecilia', 'become', 'nurse', 'now-grown', 'Briony', 'regretfully', 'estranged', 'sister', 'Where', 'story', 'startling', 'moving', 'ways', 'are', 'quite', 'unexpected.I', ""'m"", 'rather', 'divided', 'performances', 'headstrong', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'old-school', 'glamour', 'coltish', 'beauty', 'impactful', 'manner', 'reminiscent', 'young', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'character', 'somewhat', 'story', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'boyish', 'magnetism', 'Robbie', 'gaining', 'gravitas', 'idealized', 'character', 'fatalistic', 'horror', 'war', 'head', 'Together', 'Knightley', 'McAvoy', 'somehow', 'just', 'miss', 'creating', 'image', 'enduring', 'passion', 'necessary', 'carry', 'core', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'Briony', 'three', 'superb', 'actresses', 'seamlessly', 'show', 'character', 'evolving', 'fate', 'adolescent', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'searing', 'self-possession', 'care', 'Briony', 'repugnant', 'act', 'self-interest', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'over', 'young', 'uncertain', 'nurse', 'caring', 'badly', 'maimed', 'soldiers', 'London', 'hospital', 'Finally', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'last', 'scene', 'providing', 'denouement', 'characteristic', 'authority', 'giving', 'title', 'true', 'meaning.All', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stunning', 'Sarah', 'Greenwood', 'meticulous', 'production', 'design', 'especially', 'Dunkirk', 'scenes', 'Jacqueline', 'Durran', 'simply', 'designed', 'period', 'costumes', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'stirring', 'music', 'score', 'effective', 'somewhat', 'excessive', 'use', 'typewriter', 'keys', 'punctuate', 'key', 'scenes', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'Pay', 'particular', 'attention', 'uninterrupted', 'five-minute', 'tracking', 'shot', 'Dunkirk', 'done', 'Steadicam', 'bravura', 'set', 'piece', 'lines', 'opening', 'scene', 'Orson', ""Welles'Touch"", 'Evil', '2008', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'such', 'elaborate', 'production', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Wright', 'comprehensive', 'half-hour', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Bringing', 'Past', 'Life', 'Making', 'Atonement', 'five-minute', 'short', 'Novel', 'Screen', 'Adapting', 'Classic', 'Wright', 'Hampton', 'McEwan', 'discuss', 'transition', 'cursory', 'level', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'about', 'eight', 'minutes', 'total', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Wright']",N/A

Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play Cecilia and Robbie, and young couple in love doomed to have their blossoming love torn to shreds because of a misunderstanding. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Briony, an overly imaginative 13-year-old who ruins her sister's life as well as her own because of this misunderstanding.The script to Atonement is fabulous, and all of the characters are cast perfectly.

1143247,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B0013K7ZPE,elena maria vidal,"[2, 3]","The destruction caused by a single false accusation is the theme of the 2007 film ""Atonement,"" starring James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, based on the novel by Ian McEwan. A family tragedy, occurring one summer night at an English country estate, spirals into the horrors of World War II, almost as if the private debacle leads to the international conflagration. Of course it does not, but the film clarifies the message that personal sins have resounding consequences from which the innocent suffer.The lie which separates young lovers Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knightley) is precipitated by a variety of circumstances which could have been prevented. For one thing, the youngsters of the household, those visiting and those in residence, seemingly receive little supervision. If someone had been watching the twins, it would not have been so easy for them to run away. And why were two young girls like Briony and Lola permitted to run through the woods alone in the dark? Something terrible was bound to happen.Of course, if Robbie and Cecilia had chosen to fornicate in a pantry or a closet rather than right there in the library, especially in a house full of guests and children and servants, much harm would have been avoided. Briony's thirteen year old, morbid imagination is blamed for making so much of it. No doubt there are plenty of old married women who would be startled if they happened upon two people copulating in the book shelves. Glimpsing Lola being raped in the woods a few hours later was too much for the sensitive and sheltered girl, who then vents her turmoil upon poor Robbie.In fact, Briony is made into quite the villainess although she is only a child, a bright child with an overactive imagination, left to her own devices. We hear constantly about ""Catholic guilt;"" perhaps Protestant guilt is far worse. If Briony had been able receive some spiritual direction from a confessor, hopefully she would have been told at some point to clear Robbie's name, freeing herself from the consuming self-reproach. As she matures it becomes clearer to her that she had borne false witness, that she had misunderstood what she had seen in the woods. The deep implications of her lie sink into her soul so that she is prevented from blossoming as a woman, and remains even into old age an adolescent with a deer-in-the-headlights expression. She embraces the vocation of nursing out of guilt rather than from the desire to heal. She deprives herself of love, existing in the dream of Robbie and Cecilia's thwarted romance. She is as much a victim of the crime as they are.Subtly crafted, with every scene a work of art, the film flows from the chintz-draped manor house with its lush gardens to the blistering shores of Dunkirk. Keira Knightley must be the most emaciated actress who ever lived, but her diction is lovely and dark eyes, expressive. What a talented actor James McAvoy is, although I usually find him homely; in ""Atonement"" he is quite handsome. The costumes are perfection; the musical score hauntingly punctuated with the clicking of Briony's typewriter. Or is it Robbie's typewriter? The lewd note which he mistakenly sends to Cecila is a major disaster, especially in the wrong hands.

One in where the viewer is supposed to believe that Briony one of the main characters is 'atoning' for a lie that she told in her youth, and only after the passage of a very long life FINALLY confesses to.  This is where I checked out of this terriby down story.Briony was a self-important brat who never grew up and continually made excuses for not telling the truth.  I loved her speech when she says that the truth no longer mattered.  The truth always matter - so Briony, as the author of 21 novels, why write the book?  The fact that she waited until everyone who would have formed an opinion about her had died, no doubt made this selfish act feel right and 'truthful' to an opportunistic/capitalistic liar.Briony's lie tragically altered the life of all those close to her.

But for once, the product lives up to the hype.Having been greatly lauded for his freshman effort, ""Pride and Prejudice,"" was there any way possible director Joe Wright could meet the expectations of his sophomore film?  Quite simply the answer would be ""yes.""  It is very difficult for me to say much about this masterpiece without saying too much (in other words, spoiling it).  The plot concerns two lovers (Knightley & Mcavoy) who are forced to face insurmountable obstacles not the least of which would be the troubling backdrop of Europe during WWII.  Just like the director, both leads are stunningly spectacular and delicious.  The entire production deliriously delicious for any movie connisseur.  From the cinematography, editing, score, to sound design, this movie is a clinic on how to make masterful cinema.The first time I watched Attonement I was little prepared for the final resolution.

However, such books are often hard to adapt to film - such is the case here; the story as presented, is confusing and hard to follow, and was too slow to hold my attention for very long.I think we watch movies to be entertained; to escape to another place for a while and temporarily put our realities on a shelf. Sometimes I think this concept escapes some filmmakers, which is too bad. In the case of ""Atonement,"" the producers seemed to have been more concerned about recreating the true soul of the book than they were about keeping it entertaining enough so that the viewer's attention span would not wander too far.If, after all the promotional trailers, you're curious enough to want to see the movie, then by all means, do so.

I'm a retired person in late middle-age, and I'm STILL confused on that issue!

""Atonement"" was for me neither ""epic"" nor ""romantic"". But I enjoyed the pace of it, and the three people who portrayed Briony at different ages were terrific. Vanessa Redgrave's performance at the end made everything come together for me, and ratcheted up the quality of the entire film a couple of notches in just that moment (though I don't buy her ""vascular dementia"" story; she was far too cognizant to be the recipient of such a diagnosis at that point). But there is much food for thought in her explanation (as a writer) for her ""final"" book.

Whether you read the book or not is immaterial, though it is best to have read the book  and then see this wonderful movie adaptation.  And if you are the type of person who enjoys a good story with superb acting, then this one is for you. One thing that can be said of the British is that their actors and actresses are well trained in their craft. They can act.Rarely has such a film taken one in an emotional roller-coaster ride and with such grace and effortless beauty. Who cannot laugh at Robbie's saucy note!...or felt profound sadness in the unfolding Dunkirk evacuation scene,  while at the same time being in sheer awe of the talent up on the screen. James McAvoy & Keira Knightley, Romola Garai and the others are both sublime in their parts.Director Joe Wright ('Pride and Prejudice' ) and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have accomplished another wonderful movie adaptation. The film won an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 80th Academy Awards, and was nominated for six others, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (Hampton), and Best Supporting Actress (Saoirse Ronan, playing Briony Tallis) of Ian McEwan's critically acclaimed labyrinthine novel of the same title. Atonement has generally been acclaimed as among the Top 10 Films of 2007 by numerous film critics association.But looking back, I wasn't convinced that Briony fully understood just what she had done, even though she attempted to atone.  She came out as  arrogantly repentant....as if the surprise revelation at the end of the film when she was being interviewed, was another of her compelling reason for her craving, once more, to be in the limelight.  To be honest, it would have been more appropriate if the film would have ended with Briony plainly stating, ""What I have done was an outrageously horrible, stupid, and childish act. It destroyed people's lives and caused them heartache beyond what I could possibly understand. Now, I have to live with whatever is left in my brief, tortured existence. And that is a cross I alone will have to bear.""Here is a film  with romance, humor, drama, a sweeping epic, poignant moments and tragedy set in a particularly period piece. The stunning Dunkirk sequence is already being hailed as an all time-classic scene, and rightly so. But for the most part, it was the impressive photography and lighting combined with the musical soundtrack, not to mention the story line that can take hold of an audience patient enough to pay attention. The reward is to witness, to understand and to feel an unfolding  tragedy set in the evocative period of an already bygone era of the 1930's.  (It was filmed throughout the summer of 2006 in Great Britain and France). And while it can be argued that in the end, despite her attempt, Briony failed to atone for her transgression, maybe the point in the story is that there is no real way to atone. It was too little and too late.  What's done is done, and the realization that she had to accept responsibility in the playout of this magnificent tale of unrequited love... is the sole 'raison detre' of this beautifully poignant film.5 out of 5",5,A Journey Through A Cinematic Masterpiece...,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,3202,"['not', 'pop-corn', 'flick', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'rave', 'about', 'Whether', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'immaterial', 'best', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'see', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'superb', 'acting', 'then', 'one', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'British', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'well', 'trained', 'craft', 'can', 'act.Rarely', 'such', 'film', 'taken', 'one', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'such', 'grace', 'effortless', 'beauty', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'laugh', 'Robbie', 'saucy', 'note', 'felt', 'profound', 'sadness', 'unfolding', 'Dunkirk', 'evacuation', 'scene', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'sheer', 'awe', 'talent', 'up', 'screen', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'others', 'are', 'sublime', 'parts.Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', ""'Pride"", 'Prejudice', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'have', 'accomplished', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', '80th', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'six', 'others', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Hampton', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'playing', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'labyrinthine', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Atonement', 'generally', 'been', 'acclaimed', 'Top', '10', 'Films', '2007', 'numerous', 'film', 'critics', 'association.But', 'looking', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'Briony', 'fully', 'understood', 'just', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'even', 'attempted', 'atone', 'came', 'out', 'arrogantly', 'repentant', '.as', 'surprise', 'revelation', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'interviewed', 'was', 'compelling', 'reason', 'craving', 'once', 'more', 'be', 'limelight', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Briony', 'plainly', 'stating', 'What', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'outrageously', 'horrible', 'stupid', 'childish', 'act', 'destroyed', 'people', 'lives', 'caused', 'heartache', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'understand', 'Now', 'have', 'live', 'left', 'brief', 'tortured', 'existence', 'cross', 'alone', 'will', 'have', 'bear', 'Here', 'film', 'romance', 'humor', 'drama', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'poignant', 'moments', 'tragedy', 'set', 'particularly', 'period', 'piece', 'stunning', 'Dunkirk', 'sequence', 'already', 'being', 'hailed', 'time-classic', 'scene', 'rightly', 'so', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'impressive', 'photography', 'lighting', 'combined', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'mention', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'take', 'hold', 'audience', 'patient', 'enough', 'pay', 'attention', 'reward', 'witness', 'understand', 'feel', 'unfolding', 'tragedy', 'set', 'evocative', 'period', 'already', 'bygone', 'era', '1930', 'was', 'filmed', 'summer', '2006', 'Great', 'Britain', 'France', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'end', 'attempt', 'Briony', 'failed', 'atone', 'transgression', 'maybe', 'point', 'story', 'real', 'way', 'atone', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'What', 'done', 'done', 'realization', 'had', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'playout', 'magnificent', 'tale', 'unrequited', 'love', 'sole', ""'raison"", 'detre', 'beautifully', 'poignant', 'film.5', '5']",N/A

I read the book when it was first published back in 2001, liked it but did not think of it much before the movie was released. I did not rush to the theater to see ""Atonement"" - mostly because it was universally compared to ""The English Patient"". I sat through ""The English Patient"" once and decided that I would not want to see it again. Well, to make the long story short, I rented ""Atonement"" when it was released on DVD, and to my utter delight, it turned to be the Best movie of last year. Its first part, 45 minutes in the Tallis's family estate that depict one long hot summer day in 1935, the day that had dramatically and tragically changed the future of the film's many characters, is simply cinematic triumph. The atmosphere of sexual tension, of longing, of discovering love and immediate losing it forever has been recreated masterfully. The first third of the film depends a lot on the inner monologues, body languages, on the differences in ability to see something and to interpret it. I found director's choice in showing the same events from different points of view very creative and appropriate for this kind of cinematic story telling. I was very impressed by Dario Marianelli's Oscar winning score that used the sound of typewriter as a leitmotif. I found it very fitting for the film which is about a devastating power of word that could be the deadliest weapon of all. Shrapnel and bombs just finished the deed that three simple words had started on the evening of one hot summer in 1935. I found the middle part of the film somewhat weaker, not as intense with the emotional impact as the first part until one mournful tragic scene of the war's horror as seen through Robbie's eyes. Once again I was fascinated by the director's and young actor's art of saying much without a word.In the movie with no single bad performance, we are rewarded in the final with short but memorable appearance of Vanessa Redgrave who as one of my friends commented, has ""only her face, eyes, and voice to work with."" But this is an actress whom Katharine Hepburn favored over all actresses and remarked that she was ""A thrill to look at and to listen to."" The short epilogue with Redgrave brings the movie to the same high level as its amazingly artful opening part. After I finished watching ""Atonement"", the first thing I did - I placed the hold for ""The English Patient"". Ten years is a long time. Maybe I'll see it differently now. Or maybe the fact that Anthony Minghella who had interviewed Redgrave's character in the last scene of ""Atonement"", suddenly and untimely passed away last March had added to my decision to re-visit his film.4.5/5",4,One of the best films of 2007,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2810,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'liked', 'Atonement', '2007', 'most', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'back', '2001', 'liked', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'did', 'not', 'rush', 'theater', 'see', 'Atonement', 'mostly', 'was', 'universally', 'compared', 'English', 'Patient', 'sat', 'English', 'Patient', 'once', 'decided', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Well', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'rented', 'Atonement', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'utter', 'delight', 'turned', 'be', 'Best', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'first', 'part', '45', 'minutes', 'Tallis', 'family', 'estate', 'depict', 'one', 'long', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', '1935', 'day', 'had', 'dramatically', 'tragically', 'changed', 'future', 'film', 'many', 'characters', 'simply', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'atmosphere', 'sexual', 'tension', 'longing', 'discovering', 'love', 'immediate', 'losing', 'been', 'recreated', 'masterfully', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'lot', 'inner', 'monologues', 'body', 'languages', 'differences', 'ability', 'see', 'something', 'interpret', 'found', 'director', 'choice', 'showing', 'same', 'events', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'very', 'creative', 'appropriate', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'story', 'telling', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'score', 'used', 'sound', 'typewriter', 'leitmotif', 'found', 'very', 'fitting', 'film', 'devastating', 'power', 'word', 'could', 'be', 'deadliest', 'weapon', 'Shrapnel', 'bombs', 'just', 'finished', 'deed', 'three', 'simple', 'words', 'had', 'started', 'evening', 'one', 'hot', 'summer', '1935', 'found', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'somewhat', 'weaker', 'not', 'intense', 'emotional', 'impact', 'first', 'part', 'one', 'mournful', 'tragic', 'scene', 'war', 'horror', 'seen', 'Robbie', 'eyes', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'fascinated', 'director', 'young', 'actor', 'art', 'saying', 'much', 'word.In', 'movie', 'single', 'bad', 'performance', 'are', 'rewarded', 'final', 'short', 'memorable', 'appearance', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'one', 'friends', 'commented', 'only', 'face', 'eyes', 'voice', 'work', 'actress', 'whom', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'favored', 'actresses', 'remarked', 'was', 'A', 'thrill', 'look', 'listen', 'short', 'epilogue', 'Redgrave', 'movie', 'same', 'high', 'level', 'amazingly', 'artful', 'opening', 'part', 'finished', 'watching', 'Atonement', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'placed', 'hold', 'English', 'Patient', 'Ten', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'differently', 'now', 'maybe', 'fact', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'who', 'had', 'interviewed', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'last', 'scene', 'Atonement', 'suddenly', 'untimely', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'March', 'had', 'added', 'decision', 're-visit', 'film.4.5/5']",N/A

1143258,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B0013K7ZPE,Geaux Lightly,"[8, 13]","More like clearing her own conscience.My movie-watching habits are such that I stay away from the ultra-hyped, ""Oscar-contenders.""  Aside from the fact that the Oscars have been a joke for years, many times the movies have just been major letdowns that believed their own hype and failed to deliver.  Three movies spring straight to mind: Mystic River, Notes on a Scandal, and Atonement.  All three movies were not worth the hype and make me glad that I didn't spend $10 to see them.  All three I would have for sure walked out of. Someone on IMDb had it right when they said Atonement is the ""lovechild of Titanic and the English Patient.""  If you've seen those movies, that should tell you all you need to know.We start out meeting young Briony (the little actress is fantastic) and we are told that she has written another play that she plans to perform after dinner that day.  It doesn't take long to gather that she has a Man in the Moon-type crush on the son of the housekeeper.  The young man, Robbie, is head over heels for her older sister, Cecelia.  We never really see any truly tender, simple, in love moments btwn R&C;, so the depth of their love is supposed to be understood (more on this later). Anyway, after catching C&R; in the library in a moment of passion, Briony, in an act of jealousy, accuses Robbie of raping her friend, Lola. Unfortunately, it seems Lola was probably not raped b/c of her mannerisms earlier in the film toward her ""attacker.""  She was probably just a fast tail who was scared and allowed her friend to aid and abet her actions. Robbie gets sent off to prison for 5 years, and then he joins (drafted) into the military. Cecelia has written off her family and has moved away. We don't find out for some time what happens to Briony. I believe we see C&R; meet up at least twice, but none of it is happy. They seem to be stealing whatever moments they can get.  We hear from Cecelia that Briony has abandoned school and opted to become a nurse instead. Cecelia speculates, more like foreshadows, that it's an act of penance.  She has been trying to reunite w/her sister, but Cecelia has been ignoring her letters.All during this time, we are being treated to flashbacks. Nothing that pushes the story, but just inserts that have you wondering.  Briony tracks down Cecelia at her apartment, and they have a nonreunion.  Robbie is there and he lashes out at Briony for her deceit. They tell her that she must go the authorities and tell the truth. She informs them that she just left Lola's (the raped friend) wedding, and she has married her attacker (we don't ever learn why), so that's instant immunity from testifying.After a little bit more dialogue I don't remember, Briony leaves and the next thing you know, the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave is onscreen giving an interview. This is the elderly Briony who is at the brink of retirement after 1)finding out she is dying and 2)she's written her last novel titled Atonement.  Through this interview, we discover that those few moments we saw with Cecelia and Robbie? Yeah, they didn't happen. They apparently never saw each other again after that night at the house.Both Cecelia and Robbie die tragic deaths at very young ages. Briony, still feeling guilty about what she did, decided to write a novel giving them the happy ending they deserved.Someone on Amazon spoiled the ending for me by stating in the review what happened (without a spoiler tag), so I wasn't shocked by the ending. But I can imagine the collective ""is that it?"" that no doubt echoed from theater to theater. The ending was extremely unsatisfying. Extremely. It's not that I felt any special connection to Robbie and Cecelia, but the idea of Briony attaining ""Atonement"" for her actions via standards completely designed and approved by her just blew the movie for me. And how manipulative was it for Briony to 1.be played by Redgrave and 2.be dying?  Sorry, up until the very end I felt nothing for Briony.The character seemed to have a sort of God complex about her. It's her word and her word only that ruins Robbie's life.  Only she owns the information that can clear him all those years later, and only she gets to decide what type of ending they should have. And SHE decides that the book atones for her disgusting actions.  And another thought I had: since this was all in her novel, did Lola and Marshall really not get married?  If not, then she still was not letting C&R; have happiness. What an interesting roadblock she included.The acting was great, but the story weakens the performances. I felt sorry for Robbie b/c of the circumstances, but the story didn't invoke deeper sympathy.  You can't always put it on the actor.  The story has to match the actor's choices. Keira was good, but the role could have easily been done by someone else. She's come a long way since Bend it Like Beckham, but that pout is only going to take her so far. Young Briony was quite good, and Vanessa Redgrave's short scene was enjoyable. Eighteen year old Briony didn't have much appeal b/c it seemed that the character still hadn't grown up.  She didn't come off as so much wanting to right her wrongs, as she wanted to ease her conscience.  So what she was 13 at the time. She knowingly ruined two lives.It's just hard to sympathize w/a character like that.  Doesn't really matter to me if human nature is this ugly. I don't go to movies to watch characters that I can't relate to.  And I don't always like neatly wrapped up stories, but this was ridiculous.And this is not a love story. Titanic and The Notebook were love stories.I apologize, I really didn't plan for such a long review. At least it shows I watched the entire film :-)  I will say, the best part of the film was the use of the typewriter in the score.",2,Atonement?*SPOILER ALERT*,1206403200,"03 25,

Nonetheless, the film was cinematically pleasing.  Some of the dialogue is rather simplistic.  However, you have to keep in mind the story is told from the viewpoint of a thirteen-year-old girl whose testimony caused a serious disruption in the lives of her sister and the lover.  The actors are essentially acting  out how young Briony, our main character, sees these circumstances.  Briony spends all her life trying to overcome her guilt for what she put the lovers through.  I can see how incredibly hard it must have been for director Joe Wright to adapt this intrinsic story into a visual masterpiece the audience could comprehend.

1143260,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013K7ZPE,Grady Harp,"[150, 183]","For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times, basking in not only the brilliant story/mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language, rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen, but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton (we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film) becomes even more clear in its realization  of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose.  Joe Wright as director steers this story well, finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving.The cast is uniformly superb.  From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis (an impressive Saoirse Ronan) to the years' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony (Romola Garai) to the 'epilogue' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave, the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy.  But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's  tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work.  Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee, Brenda Blethyn, J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier and countless others are played to perfection.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II.  Dario Marianelli's music score (much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet!) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of 'La Boheme' with de los Angeles and Bj&ouml;rling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations.Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film (and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night!): it is the perfect marriage of novel, cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film.

Seeking atonement, she works as a nurse in London during WW II, then later writes a book admitting she bore false witness.  Sorry Briony, that doesn't make up for destroying a man's life.  Burn in Hades, you little brat.Keira Knightley is the best thing in this romance involving the usual props and contretemps - misplaced love, tuxedos, perverts, teapots, country estates, falling bombs, French, stuffy accents and misdirected love letters.  As for the movie itself, it's more a vehicle to demonstrate that the actors are, well, great actors.  And they are.  Every performance was top-notch and the sets were lavish, although I could tell the director and set designer were more concerned with English estates than with Dunkirk.

It is also not an English society story from the 30s, though it starts as such. A young girl with writing ambitions has her share of frustrations with family and with a failed crush. She sees things and misunderstands them involving her elder sister and her crush. This leads to false accusations, a wrong arrest, a life badly damaged, a love unfulfilled. The script handles the misperceptions of the girl perfectly, we get to see things in different versions. It is like time moving in loops.The middle part shows us the struggles of the two separated lovers towards getting back to each other in the middle of war. Dunkerk for him, London hospitals' nursing wards during the bombing of London for her. The younger sister repents and tries to make up, but is rejected.The final and shortest part is set in the recent past and has the former young girl explain what happened.

I also enjoy films that use non-linear storytelling when necessary for plot development.  However, the movie and acting left me absolutely cold, although it is hard to pinpoint exactly why. The pacing was glacial; in fact, at the performance I attended, a number of people walked out (not just men).  Because of the glacial pace, I could not suspend disbelief enough to accept the gaping holes in the plot.  The story line was confusing, and I am still unsure what actually happened versus what older Briony wished had happened.  It was as though there was a wall between the audience and the movie so that it just did not connect.  The atmosphere of the movie was cold and indistinct, although pretty to look at.The acting was flat - there was no true passion on the part of any of the major characters, and I felt there was simply no chemistry between the two leads.  The only actor who showed any passion and commitment to character was the young Naval officer on the beach organizing the evacuation (I think the actor was Tobias Menzies of HBO's ""Rome"").The way the evacuation of Dunkirk was filmed (as much as I admire the technical mastery of the tracking shot) was simply bizarre and did not match any historical description I had ever read.  Was this supposed to be McAvoy's hallucinations of the beach from being wounded and dying, or was the whole beach episode supposed to be the director's realistic portrayal of the evacuation?**SPOILER ALERT**There was no ""atonement"".

He's up there with Baz Luhrmann who does those extravagent musicals such as Moulin Rouge. What impressed me from his first movie was how daring he made scenes that were already tough enough to get made. Filming intricate and coordinated scenes such as the ballroom dance that flirts for minutes with blind footmoves and difficult/fast lines. And he does it again in Atonement, though with more of an observant approach, with the four minute beach scene, seemingly pain free. I marvel at how he handles such difficult scenes, and it keeps me enthralled because in all seriousness I have to dig into the sacred past and compare him even to a young Stanley Kubrick in how he choreographed Spartacus. It is early, but I get the sense that given enough money and backing he could muster his epic masterpiece as well. We have to remember that Joe's been working with Focus films and that's an independant film company with little money to spare for exuberance. He hasn't been the helm of a gargantua film project like Spielberg or Peter Jackson, but we are looking at the blossoming of a very gifted director.

There are many, many reviews that do that.  I will simply point out the big problem areas for me:....Period pieces are tough.  They run the risk of dragging a storyline down.  Forty-two minutes into the movie I was about to lose my mind from sheer boredom.  The pace of the movie was logged down by an inept unfolding of a period piece.Flashback sequences are tricky.  Do it wrong and you confuse your audience.  This was horrifying.  There was a lack of consistency in order and I began wondering ""Three weeks earlier?""  Is that three weeks earlier than the six months earlier we are moving away from or is it three weeks earlier from the completion of the six months span of time?Theatrical screen shots rapidly become parody if they do not support the storyline.  I actually laughed out loud at many of the theatrical shots.  A soldier standing in front of a black and white movie screen.... the closeup of a broken vase.  It did not support the story, these moments that are liberally sprinkled through this movie felt like the overfawning inner artiste' of bad direction.  It truly took time out of the movie and did not pull the story forward.And... NEVER offer up a story about a storyteller if you cannot actually tell a story.  Some movies are not storytelling greatness.  The main character is a writer.  A Storyteller.  And this movie is her ""story"" of what happened.And lastly - if you are going to name a movie ""Atonement""... show atonement.  (I will have to say that two of the three people who watched this movie and liked it, agreed with me on this point).  If Atonement was the title and the subject, it would have been interesting to actually see that.  You get a small admission of wanting atonement, but there is no ""aha"" moment you see with the main character.  And part of the reason for that is there is no focus on her process other than to show her nursing.  But Atonement is a deep process and this was a shallow reference.I would feel very put upon if I should ever be forced to watch this movie again.  And although it appears that I stand alone...

Marren ""jtm497""","[0, 0]","As a long-time Ian McEwan fan, I always thought his best book was ""Atonement""Atonement, and this amazing film certainly does justice to the novel. The first half of the film is set in 1935 on a hot summer day on the lush country estate of the Tallis family. Cecilia (Keira Knightly) is the gorgeous, sensual, but bored older daughter of the family. James McEvoy is the housekeeper's son, who works on the estate in the summer but is clearly going places, after a Cambridge education paid for by the mysterious Mr. Tallis, whom we never meet.Cecelia's 13 year old sister, Briony, is an aspiring writer, and is trying to stage her first play that evening for the guests of the house. But there's a lot more going on, as the pounding score by Dario Marianelli suggests. Briony witnesses a mysterious scene by the fountain between Robbie and Cecelia, and we suddenly realize the undercurrents of passion and emotion thick in the hot summer air.Looming in the background are thoughts of the war to come. Through flashbacks and replays from different points of view, the tension builds, and in the space of one boring summer day, the lives of the Tallis family and of Robbie are shattered.For those who haven't read the book it's hard to say more without being a spoiler, so I won't. For lovers of the novel, rest assured that director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have stayed faithful to the novel, with amazing results. It's hard to think of another instance where the film so perfectly complemented the novel, deepening my understanding and suggesting new interpretations. The war scenes are filmed with all the chaos and horror McEwan writes of, and the final interview with the elderly Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave, just makes a bit more explicit the shattering climax of the book.

The use of sound for the urgent clickity-clack of the typewriter in several scenes is ideal in telling this tale, as well as perspective on behaviour. With standout performances by all involved but particularly to the young Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), James McAvoy in one of his hardest roles to portray, and somewhat brief but impressive performance from Keira Knightley. The story revolves around Briony Tallis and her misinterptritation of a letter and other seemingly private events between budding young lovers Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) which plunge all of their future lives into peril and propelling Briony to somehow find a way to atone for her actions before it is too late.

1143286,A189COFU9UUX2L,B0013K7ZPE,Joseph M. Patane,"[4, 11]","This is not a great movie.I recommend that you rent it, not buy it, for one showing. This way you will see for yourself whether or not this is a 5 star or 1 star or whatever type movie. My opinion is 2 star.One does not get a strong feel for the two ""lovers"", Cecillia and Robbie. The chemistry is not there, it is not very strong or compelling. This is essential for the movie to move you, to make you feel a sense of loss, as you watch the two lovers unable to find happiness in each others' arms. Briony's role is to be the spoiler, the lying brat who causes the two lovers to become separated from the moment Briony realizes Robbie preferred Cecillia to her. Yet this role too could have been handled in a far better way than it was. Briony in her child-like way loved Robbie. She did not understand what she felt, but it was love to her. The audience gets this picture indirectly and the true import of what Briony felt was not revealed until near the end of the film when the scene shifts to an earlier time and she jumps into the river to get Robbie to save her. He does jump in and he saves her. This proved to her he cared. And in her child-like way, she felt that he loves her as she was beginning to love him. Yes, he did, but not in the way the young Briony wanted. Hence, she falls in love with him, but it was an unrequited love. This could have been a very powerful thing to have explored, but was not in the movie.What power the movie could have shown us,yet messed up on. It could have shown the loss of love as Briony might have felt to the loss that Cecillia later feels. The tragic choice Briony made would then have given her a more compelling role. She is rather like a robot attempting to fix a blown fuse as the movie unwinds near the end. I could neither hate nor like her, yet I could understand her at least.As for Cecillia, I could just not find much emotion at all. The director must have searched heaven and earth to finally find such a poor place for his two main characters to have sex. Come on, on a ladder in the library? This then is the moment of their ""love"", the stoking of the fires of desire and need and want. Right! I just cannot fathom a dumber spot to make out or one harder on the body. So it begins from there. There is no developing love, eye contact is minimal, touch, feel, all of this is accelerated on the ladder in the library. Love creates an evolving powerful force, that sometime taunts us, sometimes makes us better than we thought we could be. It is a true force. Yet it is not really there in the two lovers, at least not defined well in the movie.At the end we find out that 'atonement' for Briony was to put her sister and lover in the house near the sea shore within a book. She had never attempted in real life to ask forgiveness nor to right the wrong she caused. For heaven's sake, she had almost 4 years until Robbie left for war. She would then be 16. When does one find morality, when it is important to do what is right, not carry on a lie. How long does it take for this to work into the system. Forever? She knew what she was doing, yet she persisted until it was too late. Then she worked hard - or hardly - to atone. Giving them immortality in a book is just the slightess bit better than doing nothing at all, I would say.If you want to see a powerful moment of love, one you will long remember, dear reader, then see Castaway. The scene at the end with Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt is unforgettable. You see the impact of love lost - not because of greed or human jealousy, but because of time or of events beyond our control. It is heart rendering. I bet every one of us has some one we loved much, but lost because of events or just because. The heart still hurts when we see that person in our thoughts, and we feel again the loss, the terrible feeling of finality, of never again. A tear may come, and this is the power of love lost. It is always there, it is always there. So watch Hanks and Hunt. You will shed a tear, I am sure. Buy that movie just for that moment. It is something I see over and over. Hanks and Hunt have chemistry, they have powerful emotion, they show what love is, and what it is like to lose it. Hanks and Hunt also shows what a man and woman must do when faced with this loss, it does not matter what we want or think we want, it is what we do that is important. We have choices and it is how we make those choices that defines each of us. The sorrow we feel at the choices we make may remain forever, and that sorrow also defines the heart and how strong it can be.Just rent ""Atonement"", buy ""Castaway"", you will not regret that choice.Joe",2,A great movie - it is not.,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,4640,"['not', 'great', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'one', 'showing', 'way', 'will', 'see', 'not', '5', 'star', '1', 'star', 'type', 'movie', 'opinion', '2', 'star.One', 'not', 'get', 'strong', 'feel', 'two', 'lovers', 'Cecillia', 'Robbie', 'chemistry', 'not', 'there', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'compelling', 'essential', 'movie', 'move', 'make', 'feel', 'sense', 'loss', 'watch', 'two', 'lovers', 'unable', 'find', 'happiness', 'others', 'arms', 'Briony', 'role', 'be', 'spoiler', 'lying', 'brat', 'who', 'two', 'lovers', 'become', 'separated', 'moment', 'Briony', 'Robbie', 'preferred', 'Cecillia', 'role', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'far', 'better', 'way', 'was', 'Briony', 'child-like', 'way', 'loved', 'Robbie', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'love', 'audience', 'picture', 'indirectly', 'true', 'import', 'what', 'Briony', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'scene', 'shifts', 'earlier', 'time', 'river', 'get', 'Robbie', 'save', 'jump', 'proved', 'cared', 'child-like', 'way', 'felt', 'was', 'beginning', 'love', 'Yes', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'young', 'Briony', 'wanted', 'Hence', 'love', 'was', 'unrequited', 'love', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'powerful', 'thing', 'have', 'explored', 'was', 'not', 'movie.What', 'power', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'yet', 'messed', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'loss', 'love', 'Briony', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'loss', 'Cecillia', 'later', 'feels', 'tragic', 'choice', 'Briony', 'made', 'would', 'then', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'compelling', 'role', 'rather', 'robot', 'attempting', 'fix', 'blown', 'fuse', 'movie', 'end', 'could', 'neither', 'hate', 'yet', 'could', 'understand', 'least.As', 'Cecillia', 'could', 'just', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'emotion', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'searched', 'heaven', 'earth', 'finally', 'find', 'such', 'poor', 'place', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'sex', 'Come', 'ladder', 'library', 'then', 'moment', 'love', 'stoking', 'fires', 'desire', 'need', 'want', 'Right', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'dumber', 'spot', 'make', 'out', 'one', 'harder', 'body', 'there', 'developing', 'love', 'eye', 'contact', 'minimal', 'touch', 'feel', 'accelerated', 'ladder', 'library', 'Love', 'evolving', 'powerful', 'force', 'sometime', 'taunts', 'sometimes', 'better', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'force', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'two', 'lovers', 'least', 'not', 'defined', 'well', 'movie.At', 'end', 'find', 'out', ""'atonement"", 'Briony', 'was', 'put', 'sister', 'lover', 'house', 'sea', 'shore', 'book', 'had', 'never', 'attempted', 'real', 'life', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'right', 'wrong', 'caused', 'heaven', 'sake', 'had', 'almost', '4', 'years', 'Robbie', 'left', 'war', 'would', 'then', 'be', '16', 'When', 'one', 'find', 'morality', 'when', 'important', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'not', 'carry', 'lie', 'How', 'long', 'take', 'work', 'system', 'Forever', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'yet', 'persisted', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'Then', 'worked', 'hard', 'hardly', 'atone', 'Giving', 'immortality', 'book', 'just', 'slightess', 'bit', 'better', 'doing', 'nothing', 'would', 'say.If', 'want', 'see', 'powerful', 'moment', 'love', 'one', 'will', 'long', 'remember', 'dear', 'reader', 'then', 'see', 'Castaway', 'scene', 'end', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'unforgettable', 'see', 'impact', 'love', 'lost', 'not', 'greed', 'human', 'jealousy', 'time', 'events', 'control', 'heart', 'rendering', 'bet', 'one', 'one', 'loved', 'much', 'lost', 'events', 'just', 'heart', 'still', 'when', 'see', 'person', 'thoughts', 'feel', 'again', 'loss', 'terrible', 'feeling', 'finality', 'never', 'again', 'tear', 'may', 'come', 'power', 'love', 'lost', 'always', 'there', 'always', 'there', 'So', 'watch', 'Hanks', 'Hunt', 'will', 'shed', 'tear', 'am', 'sure', 'Buy', 'movie', 'just', 'moment', 'something', 'see', 'over', 'Hanks', 'Hunt', 'have', 'chemistry', 'have', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'show', 'what', 'love', 'what', 'lose', 'Hanks', 'Hunt', 'also', 'what', 'man', 'woman', 'must', 'do', 'when', 'faced', 'loss', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'want', 'what', 'do', 'important', 'have', 'choices', 'how', 'make', 'choices', 'sorrow', 'feel', 'choices', 'make', 'may', 'remain', 'forever', 'sorrow', 'also', 'heart', 'how', 'strong', 'can', 'be.Just', 'rent', 'Atonement', 'buy', 'Castaway', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'choice.Joe']",N/A

Every scene was filmed perfectly and Keira Knightley must be one of the most beautiful actresses in the past decade to act on screen. (Even though someone should make her eat a hamburger or two because she is very skinny) I also read the book by Ian McEwan and I must say the interpretation to screen was very well done.This is a very tragic love story because of what someone thinks they see and their actions that set into motion events that will destroy three lives. I also feel that this was very much a fairy tale. We have beautiful princess in love with her beautiful prince and the evil villainess who separates them forever. But the villainess finds redemption and realizes the horrors of what she had done and looks to atone for her sins.The tragedy is all because of what a thirteen year old girl thinks she sees. Briony has a very active imagination. She loves to write plays and stories and sees the world in a very different way from those around her. It is the summer of 1935 in England, right before World War II. This should be a carefree summer of swimming, playing and enjoying life. Briony has an older sister, Cecilia (Keira) who acts quite worldly. Briony looks up to her older sister and Cecilia treats Briony as any older sister would with their annoying younger sister. Then there is the housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy) Briony has a crush on Robbie. Robbie humors Briony. Robbie wants Cecilia. Cecilia, even though she acts cold to Robbie, wants him as much as he wants her.As Briony watches from her bedroom window, she sees a confrontation between Robbie and Cecilia and assumes something is wrong. As we find out what she thinks she sees is misconstrued. This starts the ball rolling. Robbie has been invited to dinner by Briony and Cecilia's brother. We see him typing away at his typewriter trying to come up with a note to apologize to Cecilia. He decides to have a little fun and types a very sexual graphic and bunt note about what he would like to do to Cecilia. He doesn't think it will ever be read by anyone and instead writes a more formal note. BUT, by accident Robbie takes the graphic note and hands it to Briony to give to Cecilia. OOOPS!! Briony reads it (even though I can't understand how at her age she knows what one of the words means) and thinks Robbie is a sex fiend. But she still gives the note to Cecilia who is very intrigued by his blunt words.Poor Robbie thinks his goose is cooked and when he knocks on the door, Cecilia answers. They both come to an agreement about how they feel for each other in a darkened library. And do they ever- the best scene in the whole movie! Briony comes across them and is shocked by what she sees. This is the final third strike against Robbie and Cecilia. As the night goes on a horrible thing happens to Briony's older cousin Lola and Briony is right there to blame Robbie.Because of Briony's lies and confusion, she destroys any chance at happiness Robbie and Cecilia can have together. Briony's life is also ruined as you will come to see. Four years go by, Robbie is off fighting in France, Cecilia is a nurse separated from her family and Briony wants to make amends, but can't. There is tragedy on all ends and these three people will never be carefree or happy ever again. To the very end Briony is the one who tells this tale and you will be crying over her pain and suffering and that of her sister and her young lover, who only had a small moment together in that dark library against the shelves.Katiebabs",4,Tragic Lovestory (B+ Grade),1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,3557,"['Atonement', 'such', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'movie', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'perfectly', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'past', 'decade', 'act', 'screen', 'Even', 'someone', 'should', 'make', 'eat', 'hamburger', 'two', 'very', 'skinny', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'must', 'say', 'interpretation', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.This', 'very', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'what', 'someone', 'see', 'actions', 'set', 'motion', 'events', 'will', 'destroy', 'three', 'lives', 'also', 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'fairy', 'tale', 'have', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'love', 'beautiful', 'prince', 'evil', 'villainess', 'who', 'forever', 'villainess', 'finds', 'redemption', 'horrors', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'atone', 'sins.The', 'tragedy', 'what', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Briony', 'very', 'active', 'imagination', 'write', 'plays', 'stories', 'world', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'summer', '1935', 'England', 'right', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'should', 'be', 'carefree', 'summer', 'swimming', 'playing', 'enjoying', 'life', 'Briony', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'who', 'quite', 'worldly', 'Briony', 'up', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'treats', 'Briony', 'older', 'sister', 'would', 'annoying', 'younger', 'sister', 'Then', 'housekeeper', 'son', 'Robbie', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Briony', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'Robbie', 'humors', 'Briony', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'Cecilia', 'even', 'cold', 'Robbie', 'as', 'much', 'her.As', 'Briony', 'watches', 'bedroom', 'window', 'confrontation', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'assumes', 'something', 'wrong', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'misconstrued', 'ball', 'rolling', 'Robbie', 'been', 'invited', 'dinner', 'Briony', 'Cecilia', 'brother', 'see', 'typing', 'away', 'typewriter', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'note', 'apologize', 'Cecilia', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'very', 'sexual', 'graphic', 'bunt', 'note', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'Cecilia', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'read', 'anyone', 'instead', 'more', 'formal', 'note', 'BUT', 'accident', 'Robbie', 'graphic', 'note', 'Briony', 'give', 'Cecilia', 'OOOPS', 'Briony', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'age', 'what', 'one', 'words', 'Robbie', 'sex', 'fiend', 'still', 'note', 'Cecilia', 'who', 'very', 'intrigued', 'blunt', 'words.Poor', 'Robbie', 'goose', 'cooked', 'when', 'door', 'Cecilia', 'answers', 'come', 'agreement', 'how', 'feel', 'other', 'darkened', 'library', 'do', 'ever-', 'best', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'Briony', 'shocked', 'what', 'final', 'third', 'strike', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'night', 'horrible', 'thing', 'Briony', 'older', 'cousin', 'Lola', 'Briony', 'right', 'there', 'blame', 'Robbie.Because', 'Briony', 'lies', 'confusion', 'chance', 'happiness', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'can', 'have', 'together', 'Briony', 'life', 'also', 'ruined', 'will', 'come', 'see', 'Four', 'years', 'go', 'Robbie', 'off', 'fighting', 'France', 'Cecilia', 'nurse', 'separated', 'family', 'Briony', 'make', 'amends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tragedy', 'ends', 'three', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'carefree', 'happy', 'ever', 'again', 'very', 'end', 'Briony', 'one', 'who', 'tale', 'will', 'be', 'crying', 'pain', 'suffering', 'sister', 'young', 'lover', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'small', 'moment', 'together', 'dark', 'library', 'shelves.Katiebabs']",N/A
1143292,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0013K7ZPE,K. Driscoll,"[5, 6]","I suppose Ian McEwan'snovelwas memorable enough that I suddenly looked forward to seeing it on film, but it surprised me when I realized how attached to the story I was when the film jogged my memory a bit.  That is a pretty big compliment to the movie of course.  It's a great novel and an interesting story.  The ending hit much harder on paper than it did on film but that is a nitpicking.  Atonement, as a film is absolutely gorgeous.  The art direction, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, and the actors all look and sound amazing.  Young director Joe Wright makes films with the sensibility of someone in the twilight of their career.  His team captures remarkable images over and over again, all the while weaving this tale with great efficiency.  I didn't seePride & Prejudicebut given that many of the same talent was present there, I'm going to give that film a shot.  Joe Wright has more than solidified himself.  There is no doubt in my mind that this guy knows how to make movies.For those unfamiliar with the story, Atonement is broken out into four parts.  The first part follows Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13 year-old girl from a rich English family with two older siblings.  She wants to become a writer.  She has an older sister named Cecilia (Keira Knightly) who is in the midst of falling in love with their housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy).  Some miscommunication and some meddling interrupt their budding relationship suddenly and that incident's repercussions become the center of the story thereafter.  The second part moves forward four years where Robbie is in the military during the Second World War.  Briony (now played by Romola Garai) and Cecelia are both nurses for the war.  The third part focuses on Briony's experience as a nurse and eventually how she reconnects with Cecelia and Robbie.  The fourth part of the film meets Briony (played now by Vanessa Redgrave) as a successful novelist in her 70s who is terminally ill.  Overall, each section is certainly true enough to the novel from what I can recall, but then again I read it seven years ago.  Some details are missing that may not have been easy to include but they are mostly there in spirit to satisfy those who loved the book. One detail was left out that had me a bit perplexed, but the film was too good to not find forgiveness.It is hard to express how sad this story is without giving away significant spoilers but rest assured it is a powerful story and the film succeeds in that transition quite effectively.  A lot of credit must go to the screenplay from Christopher Hampton who won an Academy Award forDangerous Liaisonsand although only nominated here he delivers something of equal quality with Atonement.  There are also some shots in Atonement that are absolutely unforgettable, in particular the lengthy sequence where Robbie experiences the Dunkirk Evacuation.  It is one long single shot that must've required immense coordination from the crew and extras.  In and of itself it is a special achievement and it doesn't come off as unnecessary or intentionally flashy regarding the team's technical prowess in any way.  It is also hard not to mention the performances, which are all good and the leads are actually great.  Keira Knightly should definitely be taken very seriously as an actress and McAvoy really stands out to me for the first time. Atonement is certainly a successful adaptation of the McEwan novel but it is also one of the best films of 2007.",5,Profoundly Sad and Visually Stunning,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,3494,"['suppose', 'Ian', ""McEwan'snovelwas"", 'memorable', 'enough', 'suddenly', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'surprised', 'when', 'realized', 'how', 'attached', 'story', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'jogged', 'memory', 'bit', 'pretty', 'big', 'compliment', 'movie', 'course', 'great', 'novel', 'interesting', 'story', 'ending', 'hit', 'much', 'harder', 'paper', 'did', 'film', 'nitpicking', 'Atonement', 'film', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'music', 'actors', 'look', 'sound', 'amazing', 'Young', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'films', 'sensibility', 'someone', 'twilight', 'career', 'team', 'remarkable', 'images', 'over', 'again', 'while', 'weaving', 'tale', 'great', 'efficiency', 'did', ""n't"", 'seePride', 'Prejudicebut', 'given', 'many', 'same', 'talent', 'was', 'present', 'there', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'more', 'solidified', 'doubt', 'mind', 'guy', 'how', 'make', 'movies.For', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'Atonement', 'broken', 'out', 'four', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', '13', 'year-old', 'girl', 'rich', 'English', 'family', 'two', 'older', 'siblings', 'become', 'writer', 'older', 'sister', 'named', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'who', 'midst', 'falling', 'love', 'housekeeper', 'son', 'Robbie', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'miscommunication', 'meddling', 'interrupt', 'budding', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'incident', 'repercussions', 'become', 'center', 'story', 'thereafter', 'second', 'part', 'forward', 'four', 'years', 'where', 'Robbie', 'military', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Briony', 'now', 'played', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Cecelia', 'are', 'nurses', 'war', 'third', 'part', 'Briony', 'experience', 'nurse', 'eventually', 'how', 'Cecelia', 'Robbie', 'fourth', 'part', 'film', 'meets', 'Briony', 'played', 'now', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'successful', 'novelist', '70s', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Overall', 'section', 'certainly', 'true', 'enough', 'novel', 'what', 'can', 'recall', 'then', 'again', 'read', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'details', 'are', 'missing', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'include', 'are', 'mostly', 'there', 'spirit', 'satisfy', 'who', 'loved', 'book', 'One', 'detail', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'had', 'bit', 'perplexed', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'not', 'find', 'forgiveness.It', 'hard', 'express', 'how', 'sad', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'significant', 'spoilers', 'rest', 'assured', 'powerful', 'story', 'film', 'transition', 'quite', 'effectively', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'forDangerous', 'Liaisonsand', 'only', 'nominated', 'here', 'something', 'equal', 'quality', 'Atonement', 'are', 'also', 'shots', 'Atonement', 'are', 'absolutely', 'unforgettable', 'particular', 'lengthy', 'sequence', 'where', 'Robbie', 'Dunkirk', 'Evacuation', 'one', 'long', 'single', 'shot', 'must', ""'ve"", 'required', 'immense', 'coordination', 'crew', 'extras', 'special', 'achievement', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'unnecessary', 'intentionally', 'flashy', 'regarding', 'team', 'technical', 'prowess', 'way', 'also', 'hard', 'not', 'mention', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'leads', 'are', 'actually', 'great', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'actress', 'McAvoy', 'really', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'Atonement', 'certainly', 'successful', 'adaptation', 'McEwan', 'novel', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2007']",N/A
1143293,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B0013K7ZPE,Kelly Klepfer,"[2, 4]","Atonement is a difficult movie on several levels. Emotionally, it's a tale of twisting logic and the power of simple words unleashed. It's a story of what ifs and if onlys. An epic full of longing and sorrow, passion and pain, Atonement is not a movie to watch to unwind after a taxing day full of drama, unless intense drama onscreen helps you unwind. Though the writing is tight and intriguing and the acting spot-on, the transitions from some scenes to others left me scratching my head. Several scenes are revisited with different points of view. I also struggled with following a couple of time line events for the same reason. One character ages from ten or eleven to eighteen but the  stated time frame is only five years unless I missed a heading telling the viewers of a time change.I will have to watch Atonement again because I'm not sure I fully appreciated the message of the film. Though Atonement is the title, I'm not sure how this played out throughout the storyline. When it's all said and done, I don't see it. I can't say anymore without a spoiler, so I won't.Atonement is not going to appeal to the majority of movie lovers. Historical fans may not find enough historical richness though there are plenty of shadows and hints of the times. War epic fans may not find enough though there are strong and poignant war moments. Those who want cookie cutter endings definitely are going to want to avoid it unless in a mood to cry. Fans of tragedy or human character and the study of why people do what they do may really find the most satisfaction.Sensitivity warning...the war scenes are peppered with the F-word, and a young man pens a note sharing what he'd like to do sexually with the woman he loves and one crude anatomical word is shown several times. Child endangerment and adult-child inappropriateness are an issue early in the movie. A couple are shown in a sexual embrace though much is hidden by clothes and lighting, an assault with a glimpse of nudity as well as a young woman in a white, wet dress add to the need for the R rating. Some war injuries are moderately intense as are the death of some horses.The acting is the major reason I'd suggest the film. Cinematography and writing would be the secondary reasons. Otherwise, if you are ambivalent, rent before you buy or skip altogether unless you like your stories to go really deep into the reality of cause and effect.",4,Not For Everybody....,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2407,"['Atonement', 'difficult', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'Emotionally', 'tale', 'twisting', 'logic', 'power', 'simple', 'words', 'unleashed', 'story', 'what', 'ifs', 'onlys', 'epic', 'full', 'longing', 'sorrow', 'passion', 'pain', 'Atonement', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'unwind', 'taxing', 'day', 'full', 'drama', 'intense', 'drama', 'onscreen', 'unwind', 'writing', 'tight', 'intriguing', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'others', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'revisited', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'also', 'struggled', 'following', 'couple', 'time', 'line', 'events', 'same', 'reason', 'One', 'character', 'ten', 'eleven', 'eighteen', 'stated', 'time', 'frame', 'only', 'five', 'years', 'missed', 'heading', 'telling', 'viewers', 'time', 'change.I', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'Atonement', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'message', 'film', 'Atonement', 'title', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'storyline', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'spoiler', ""won't.Atonement"", 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'majority', 'movie', 'lovers', 'Historical', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'enough', 'historical', 'richness', 'are', 'plenty', 'shadows', 'hints', 'times', 'War', 'epic', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'enough', 'are', 'strong', 'poignant', 'war', 'moments', 'who', 'want', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'endings', 'definitely', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'avoid', 'mood', 'cry', 'Fans', 'tragedy', 'human', 'character', 'study', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'may', 'really', 'find', 'most', 'satisfaction.Sensitivity', 'warning', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'peppered', 'F-word', 'young', 'man', 'note', 'sharing', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'sexually', 'woman', 'one', 'crude', 'anatomical', 'word', 'shown', 'several', 'times', 'Child', 'endangerment', 'adult-child', 'inappropriateness', 'are', 'issue', 'early', 'movie', 'couple', 'are', 'shown', 'sexual', 'embrace', 'much', 'hidden', 'clothes', 'lighting', 'assault', 'glimpse', 'nudity', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'woman', 'white', 'wet', 'dress', 'add', 'need', 'R', 'rating', 'war', 'injuries', 'are', 'moderately', 'intense', 'are', 'death', 'horses.The', 'acting', 'major', 'reason', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'film', 'Cinematography', 'writing', 'would', 'be', 'secondary', 'reasons', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'ambivalent', 'rent', 'buy', 'skip', 'altogether', 'stories', 'go', 'really', 'deep', 'reality', 'cause', 'effect']",N/A
1143294,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0013K7ZPE,Kevin Killian,"[1, 1]","In ATONEMENT just misses being a masterpiece, but some of this has to be attributed to the moviemaker's obsessive fidelity to the source text--for once, they should have thrown out the book and just kept the cinematic elements.  Here the actors work overtime to embody the ultra-romantic lovers Ian McEwan created in his novel, but the one is so painfully thin, and the other so oddly short, that actually I didn't even think the army would take him, even if they were so desperate they were recruiting convicts during the dark days preceding Dunkirk.Knightley and McAvoy are otherwise perfectly convincing and oh, how I wanted them to have a happy life together!  Compounding what you might call ""identification"" problems in the movie is the way the director has used three different actresses to play the part of Briony Tallis.  The young girl is very good, but it's the grown up girl who's the best, Romola Garai, here outshining everything else she's done on the screen.  None other than Vanessa Redgrave plays Briony as an elderly woman, now a world famous novelist on the order of Iris Murdoch--Redgrave is a good ten years too young to play her convincingly, as the real life character would be really, really, really old, while Redgrave looks ready to play Renee Richards all over again.  She sort of called in the part, oddly enough, and maybe a relief after the anguish all the other actors have to express.  It is Redgrave who has to put over the big post modern twist in the story, and whether or not that falls flat depends on how much you believe her slightly wry delivery.  Her explanation for her character's actions may leave you walking away thinking, did she really expect us to believe her?We were in a crowded theater when James McAvoy is typing the incriminating letter that gets him into so much trouble, one letter at a time, type, type, type, each character filling the screen, and a little boy in the audience asks his mother, what does that word spell Mama?  Everyone laughed and I didn't hear what the mother told her son.  It was just awful, why take your toddlers to a movie called ""Atonement""?

I can never understand what the Motion Picture and Film Academy sees when they nominate dull and slow films like this for awards, especially when they nominate them for the biggest award there is. I know its members are easily influenced by hype -- Hollywood lives on hype, after all -- but I see movies better than this one almost every time I turn on the TV.Some of my friends thought otherwise, thinking the romantic storyline, clever ending -- where the heroine apparently atones for an earlier indiscretion -- or the hybrid real-fake scene of early World War II Dunkirk made the movie worth watching. I wish any of this had been true, that this film had mimicked any of the glorious storytelling from ""The English Patient"", a similarly-induced World War II-era romance.But, alas, this movie did not achieve that. In my opinion, ""Atonement"" needs to atone to its viewers for boring them to death. This is the slowest film I've seen in some months with just about nothing going on to keep the viewer engaged. Even its raison d'etre -- a scene early on where a young woman misidentifies an event and turns it into sexual misconduct -- is not very fetching. A few directorial and production highlights can't save this somnambulist's delight.So, to summarize, I'd say don't believe the hype about this movie. It is not Academy Award quality and, frankly, isn't very good. I watched ""Knocked Up"" the night after this and rediscovered the elements that make a film worthwhile and enduring -- humor, human attachment, a clever script, real life characterizations and a complete lack of pretense. I'd say rent ""Knocked Up"" and forget ""Atonement"".",2,Please atone for putting me to sleep,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,1864,"['liked', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'last', 'collaboration', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'not', 'having', 'high', 'hopes', 'similarly', 'good', 'engagement', 'here', 'hoped', 'better', 'got', 'sleepy', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'what', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Film', 'Academy', 'when', 'nominate', 'dull', 'slow', 'films', 'awards', 'especially', 'when', 'nominate', 'biggest', 'award', 'know', 'members', 'are', 'easily', 'influenced', 'hype', 'Hollywood', 'hype', 'see', 'movies', 'better', 'one', 'almost', 'time', 'turn', 'TV.Some', 'friends', 'thought', 'otherwise', 'thinking', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'clever', 'ending', 'where', 'heroine', 'apparently', 'earlier', 'indiscretion', 'hybrid', 'real-fake', 'scene', 'early', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Dunkirk', 'made', 'movie', 'watching', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'true', 'film', 'had', 'mimicked', 'glorious', 'storytelling', 'English', 'Patient', 'similarly-induced', 'World', 'War', 'II-era', 'romance.But', 'alas', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'achieve', 'opinion', 'Atonement', 'needs', 'atone', 'viewers', 'boring', 'death', 'slowest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'months', 'just', 'nothing', 'going', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'Even', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'scene', 'early', 'where', 'young', 'woman', 'event', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'not', 'very', 'fetching', 'few', 'directorial', 'production', 'highlights', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'somnambulist', 'delight.So', 'summarize', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'movie', 'not', 'Academy', 'Award', 'quality', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'watched', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'night', 'rediscovered', 'elements', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'enduring', 'humor', 'human', 'attachment', 'clever', 'script', 'real', 'life', 'characterizations', 'complete', 'lack', 'pretense', ""'d"", 'say', 'rent', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'forget', 'Atonement']",N/A

Saoirse Ronan who was Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actress as the young Briony Tallis does an excellent job of creating a lot of stir.  Ramola Garai takes over as Briony at age 18 and does a good job of trying to atone for her actions as a young girl.  Vanessa Redgrave is excellent, albeit in a thankless role, as Briony right before her death.  Redgrave has been nominated for Oscars for ""Morgan!"" (1966), ""Isadora"" (1968), ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (1971), ""The Bostonians"" (1984), and ""Howard's End"" (1992).  She won a supporting Oscar in 1977 for ""Julia.""  I have been watching her captivating performance inEvening.  As the aging author telling this tale, she is reduced to a TV interview show format.  Keira Knightly who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Pride & Prejudice"" in 2005 looks good.  James McAvoy, who plays Robbie Turner, was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes for this film.  He had previously been nominated for an Oscar in the powerfulThe Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition).  He's always very good in his films; however ""Atonement"" keeps him rather boxed in emotionally, despite the excellent scenes in the war.  Brenda Blethyn plays his mother Grace Turner in a nice cameo.  The best performance of the film for me was in the cameo of Jeremie Renier as Luc Cornet, a French soldier who dies from a scull injury in front of Briony.  It's a short but powerful performance.  Belgian Renier was nominated as Best Actor by the European Film Awards forL' enfant(The Child) in which he sells his baby.  In ""Atonement,"" he is touching with his mind going between memory and the present.My greatest disappointment with ""Atonement"" was the screenplay which tries to be clever by jumping back and forth with flashbacks and giving us only part of the story to be unhooked at the director's discretion.  Thus, rather than just telling a fairly interesting tale, we must wonder at how clever the screenwriter was.  It doesn't work and the final scenes like the flooded tunnel come as downer footnotes.  If depressing cinema is your forte, get your hanky for this one.  The performances and cinematography, however, are exquisite.

Still it was shortly afterwards, that the story became interesting.Based on the novel of the same name by British writer Ian McEwan and set just before and during the Second World War, Atonement stars Keira Knightley of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy and James McAvoy of The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. Yet despite Knightley and McAvoy receiving top billing, this is not their characters' story. The story belongs to the character of Briony Tallas who we ultimately see at three points in her life. At the age of 13 and in a wonderfully bitchy performance by young actress Saoirse Ronan, Briony is a girl who has a crush on Robbie Turner (McAvoy) and is jealous of his attraction to her older sister Cecilia. It is this jealousy that leads to the splitting apart of our lovers due to one big lie.  And although the performance of Saoirse Ronan will be the most memorable Briony, for me the most interesting part of the story is the journey of Briony at age 18 (played by the beautiful Romola Garai of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) as she begins her atonement. It isn't until we see a much older Briony (played by acting legend Vanessa Redgrave) however that revelations are revealed and the complete truth is told.If you're expecting a period drama for the whole family you probably won't find it with Atonement. This is due to the vulgar use of sexual language and the graphic grotesqueness of War. However for a few older members of the family they won't find anything they haven't heard of or seen before.All in all, despite the high calibre acting from the cast, for me the majority of the movie moves forward at a 2 and a 1/2 out of 5 star movie pace, then when Briony is 18 much later on in the film it steps up to being a 3 and a 1/2 star movie. Thankfully when it comes to the final truth the movie becomes a 4 star movie due to a wonderfully special moment- There are some movies and TV shows in which a climactic sudden emotional reveal can spread magical tingles down your spine, and as Atonement progressed I did not expect to be getting that feeling at the end, but I did and I am so happy about that. And that was when the movie reached its peak, and where to better put the movie's peak than at the end.",4,Magical Tingles,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,2366,"['Starting', 'romance', 'film', 'group', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'start', 'love', 'story', 'Still', 'was', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'story', 'became', 'interesting.Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'British', 'writer', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'set', 'just', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Atonement', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'trilogy', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Knightley', 'McAvoy', 'receiving', 'top', 'billing', 'not', 'characters', 'story', 'story', 'character', 'Briony', 'Tallas', 'who', 'ultimately', 'see', 'three', 'points', 'life', 'age', '13', 'wonderfully', 'bitchy', 'performance', 'young', 'actress', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Briony', 'girl', 'who', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'McAvoy', 'jealous', 'attraction', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'jealousy', 'splitting', 'apart', 'lovers', 'due', 'one', 'big', 'lie', 'performance', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'Briony', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'journey', 'Briony', 'age', '18', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Havana', 'Nights', 'atonement', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'older', 'Briony', 'played', 'acting', 'legend', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'however', 'revelations', 'are', 'revealed', 'complete', 'truth', 'told.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'period', 'drama', 'whole', 'family', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Atonement', 'due', 'vulgar', 'use', 'sexual', 'language', 'graphic', 'grotesqueness', 'War', 'However', 'few', 'older', 'members', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'seen', 'before.All', 'high', 'calibre', 'acting', 'cast', 'majority', 'movie', 'forward', '2', '1/2', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'pace', 'then', 'when', 'Briony', '18', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'up', 'being', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'when', 'final', 'truth', 'movie', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'due', 'wonderfully', 'special', 'moment-', 'are', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'climactic', 'sudden', 'emotional', 'reveal', 'can', 'spread', 'magical', 'tingles', 'down', 'spine', 'Atonement', 'progressed', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'getting', 'feeling', 'end', 'did', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'was', 'when', 'movie', 'reached', 'peak', 'where', 'better', 'put', 'movie', 'peak', 'end']",N/A

It seemed  too dreamy with too many scenes that might or just might not have happened.  I was wrong.  This film is as much a masterpiece as the book and was nominated for several Academy awards.  Perhaps it's because Ian McEwan, the author, who I consider to be a literary genius, had a role in adapting his book to the screen.  Perhaps it's because the details of the setting are so scrupulously adhered to.  And perhaps it's because the acting throughout is just so darn good.  Put together this film is an absolute gem.The film opens in an upscale house in the English countryside in 1935.  It seems an idyllic life, especially through the eyes of 13-year old Briony Tallis who is writing a play to be performed by her young cousins for the entertainment of her family.  Her older sister, Cecilia, is in love with Robbie, the son of the cook, who has been provided an education by her father and loves Cecilia in return.  But trouble ensues because of a misunderstanding based on the young Briony's active imagination.Fast forward to 1940.  England is now at War, Robbie has spent five years in jail and is now in the British army.  He and Cecilia are still in love and Briony is eighteen years old and a nurse in a British hospital.  The war is awful.  We see Robbie experiencing its horrors.  He is wounded and suffering as he waits nine days for evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk.  At this time, Briony has a change of heart, realizes that she has caused pain to her family because of her earlier lies, and seeks out her sister who she hasn't seen for the past few years.It is only later, after a lifetime, that we find out that this visit to her sister is not quite what it seemed.  This occurs when the elderly Briony gives up the secrets that bind this story together.  Wow!  What an impact!The setting and cinematography are exceptional and the acting is outstanding.  Kiera Knightly is cast as Cecilia and James Turner as Robbie. Briony is played by three different actors at different ages - Saaorise Ronan at 13, Ramola Garai at 18, and Vanessa Regrave as a the elderly woman.This is a fine, complex and nuanced film.

By the end it I was out the door running to the nearest theatre to see the movie. Often I find the movie takes far too much away from the book, and it forces you to see things in one particular light where as reading lets ones imagination run wild. Atonment is a rare fine. Never has a director and a writer followed the original so closely and in the process they lose nothing. Every beautiful word, every devastating scene is brought to life. Keira Knightley and James Mcavoy steal every scene and bring the picture full circle.

Had it not been for Kiera Knightly, James McAvoy, and Vanessa Redgrave's combined thespian talents ... this movie wouls have been a watery rendition of the story.Set in England in 1935, an imaginative and romantically jealous 13-year-old girl makes an accusation that ends up destroying three lives. Briony Tallis, a budding writer, secretly fancies Robbie Turner, the son of the family hosuekeeper. Just back from Cambridge, Robbie and Briony's older sister Cecilia, are fighting their internal feelings for one another on the hottest day of the year. A misplaced letter finds itself in the hands of Briony which triggers the fateful accusation that lands Robbie in jail and Cecilia estranged from her family.Five years later, the teenage Briony is a nurse in training in London during the second world war and tries to makes ammends to her sister. Robbie is fighting in the British army and stranded in France while Ceclia lives in a modest flat in Belham living off her hospital wages. Briony uses her literary ability to attone for her inner shame and guilt over what she did. However, there is nothing that can be done to restore Robbie or Cecilia's shattered lives.Through a series of flashbacks and other scenes we learn that Briony has relied on her imagination to heal the rift between her sister and Robbie. The very same imagination that caused her to rip them apart in the first place. In the end, there is no true attonement for any of them. Lynn Redgrave as the old Briony brings the story to its sad ending of unfinished business and love lost by one lie.",4,The Co-Stars Save the Film,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1665,"['Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'possible', 'fully', 'adapt', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'film', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'combined', 'thespian', 'talents', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'watery', 'rendition', 'story.Set', 'England', '1935', 'imaginative', 'romantically', 'jealous', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'accusation', 'up', 'destroying', 'three', 'lives', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'budding', 'writer', 'secretly', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'son', 'family', 'hosuekeeper', 'Just', 'back', 'Cambridge', 'Robbie', 'Briony', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'are', 'fighting', 'internal', 'feelings', 'one', 'hottest', 'day', 'year', 'misplaced', 'letter', 'hands', 'Briony', 'fateful', 'accusation', 'Robbie', 'jail', 'Cecilia', 'estranged', 'family.Five', 'years', 'later', 'teenage', 'Briony', 'nurse', 'training', 'London', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'tries', 'ammends', 'sister', 'Robbie', 'fighting', 'British', 'army', 'stranded', 'France', 'Ceclia', 'modest', 'flat', 'Belham', 'living', 'off', 'hospital', 'wages', 'Briony', 'literary', 'ability', 'attone', 'inner', 'shame', 'guilt', 'what', 'did', 'However', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'restore', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'shattered', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'other', 'scenes', 'learn', 'Briony', 'relied', 'imagination', 'heal', 'rift', 'sister', 'Robbie', 'very', 'same', 'imagination', 'caused', 'rip', 'apart', 'first', 'place', 'end', 'true', 'attonement', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'old', 'Briony', 'story', 'sad', 'ending', 'unfinished', 'business', 'love', 'lost', 'one', 'lie']",N/A

But his novels are not for everyone.  McEwan succeeds in portraying a defining moment in people's lives, and examines that moment in excruciating detail through the psychological interplay of complex characters.  Moreover, there is no living novelist who creates so successfully an elegant, mannerly style of writing that seems to harken back to another time.  McEwan is also not a linear writer, but one who freely goes back and forth between past and present.  For these reasons, McEwan is never easy to read, but the results are very satisfying.This background, I believe, provides some explanation as to why his novel is so difficult to follow in cinematic format.  When I was watching the movie for the first time, I too was confused as to time and place, and from whose perspective I was viewing events.  So it comes as no surprise that many reviewers had difficulty with the movie or simply dismissed it as an unsatisfying experience.However, after watching the movie for the third time, I realized that the screenwriter and especially the director had captured the novel perfectly.  In my opinion, they succeeded at adapting to film the novel's space-time continuum, and in demanding and receiving superb performances from all of the major actors.  There was not a weak actor in the cast, and like others, I was spellbound by the performances of the youngest and oldest Briony.  If Vanessa Redgrave is not the finest living actress, she is certainly among the best.In sum, the movie is a faithful and successful adaptation of a difficult novel, and illustrates for me that Joe Wright is not merely a fluke because of his wonderful ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Why this movie did not garner more Academy nominations and wins, especially in the important ""Best Director,"" ""Best Actor,"" and ""Best Actress"" categories simply proves that Hollywood wants the blockbuster, special effects type of movie and refuses to honor or recognize psychological dramas that this movie typifies.",5,An Incredibly Successful Adaptation Of A Masterpiece,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,2118,"['have', 'read', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'major', 'novels', 'Antonement', 'Amsterdam', 'Saturday', 'believe', 'be', 'best', 'living', 'novelist', 'novels', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'McEwan', 'portraying', 'defining', 'moment', 'people', 'lives', 'examines', 'moment', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'psychological', 'interplay', 'complex', 'characters', 'Moreover', 'living', 'novelist', 'who', 'so', 'successfully', 'elegant', 'mannerly', 'style', 'writing', 'harken', 'back', 'time', 'McEwan', 'also', 'not', 'linear', 'writer', 'one', 'who', 'freely', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'present', 'reasons', 'McEwan', 'never', 'easy', 'read', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'satisfying.This', 'background', 'believe', 'explanation', 'why', 'novel', 'so', 'difficult', 'follow', 'cinematic', 'format', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'too', 'was', 'confused', 'time', 'place', 'perspective', 'was', 'viewing', 'events', 'surprise', 'many', 'reviewers', 'had', 'difficulty', 'movie', 'simply', 'dismissed', 'unsatisfying', 'experience.However', 'watching', 'movie', 'third', 'time', 'realized', 'screenwriter', 'especially', 'director', 'had', 'captured', 'novel', 'perfectly', 'opinion', 'succeeded', 'adapting', 'film', 'novel', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'demanding', 'receiving', 'superb', 'performances', 'major', 'actors', 'was', 'not', 'weak', 'actor', 'cast', 'others', 'was', 'spellbound', 'performances', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'Briony', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'not', 'finest', 'living', 'actress', 'certainly', 'best.In', 'sum', 'movie', 'faithful', 'successful', 'adaptation', 'difficult', 'novel', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'not', 'merely', 'fluke', 'wonderful', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Why', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'garner', 'more', 'Academy', 'nominations', 'wins', 'especially', 'important', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Actress', 'categories', 'simply', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'special', 'effects', 'type', 'movie', 'honor', 'recognize', 'psychological', 'dramas', 'movie', 'typifies']",N/A

Until the very end, that is. When the wonderful Vannessa Redgrave takes over as Briony near the end of the film, that is when everything we've seen begins to make sense.

1143320,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B0013K7ZPE,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[4, 6]","*Spoilers ahead!*The opening sequence of the movie, with the camera tracking a young girl as she strides through a big mansion, instantly recalls the opening of `Pride and Prejudice' by the same director - but that is where the similarity ends. Instead of a complicated love story where all ends well, Atonement deals with thwarted passion, guilt, and war. During a hot summer before WW2, at some picturesque Jacobean country house, young Briony Tallis, misinterpreting a few things she sees and carried away by her own jealousy, accuses her sister's lover of a crime she knows he didn't commit. He is taken off to prison and then to war, while her sister becomes a nurse. Briony herself, too, decides not to go to Cambridge as planned, but to start work as a nurse in an act of atonement. Riddled by guilt, she spends the rest of her life trying to get the true story told in a novel. In the last fifteen minutes of the movie we cut forward to the present day, when she has become a famous author and has finally succeeded in her mission.Many things about this film are impressive. There is concentrated intensity in the acting, particularly that of James McAvoy as Robbie, the housekeeper's son who falls in love with Cecilia, the daughter of the mansion (Keira Knightley). Young Saoirse Ronan is impressively believable, too, as a determined, wilful, yet forlorn Briony. The atmosphere is dark and oppressive. The music is terrific, with the meaningful sound of the typewriter ingeniously worked into the score. WW2 London is convincingly evoked. The cinematography is lush and beautiful, though maybe the spectacular, continuous shot of the British troups on the French beach is a bit too self-consciously brilliant, and not quite in keeping with the rest of the movie's style. Time is dealt with in an interesting and novel fashion; we relive several scenes twice, from different perspectives. Reality and dream sometimes blend into each other - unfortunately, however, when their doing so becomes a main plot device the story falls apart.I did feel that the storyline itself was ultimately unsatisfying. Once the war starts, the plot seems to grind to a halt. We dwell extensively on Robbie roaming through French countryside and dreaming of a happy return to Cecilia; we see Briony and Cecilia herself confronted with the ravages of war; but nothing really happens and it remains unclear how these experiences, impressively filmed though they are, come to bear on the characters and their history. As a result, the whole war-theme seems tacked-on and random. Things start moving again when Briony tries to get in touch with Cecilia and is confronted with Robbie - but then we find this whole sequence is a fantasy and never actually happened.

But I definitely couldn't get my head around it the first time around.Why did I buy Atonement? I was actually curious about this movie. People rave about it, crying when they came out of the cinema etc. People saying it was only made to win awards. All these five star reviews. Which normally means I won't like the film.Although I was quite confused during the first half hour, as it flips between one person's viewpoint to another, but I soon got dragged into the movie. The cast do brilliantly in their roles, although I don't think I'm ever going to be a fan of James McAvoy. He's just not one of my favourite actors.I won't go into the whole story, as so many other reviewers have already done so. But while I'll agree that yes, the film has been made to win awards, it is a really good film. I didn't, however, cry after watching it. I was more shocked when the credits were rolling. The only bit I didn't like in the movie was the much celebrated tracking shot through Dunkirk. Why is it so special? I got bored when it was on screen, there was nothing special there. In my opinion, it was an overly long shot, which didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.Prepared to be shocked and surprised with this movie, as it takes you in a direction that I certainly didn't think it would. And I actually liked Keira Knightley for once. (I don't normally.) Although she's still far too skinny, but she'll never change. James McAvoy - I've seen him in a couple of films now - most recently Wanted - and I still don't like him. My personal opinion, other people start swooning when his name is mentioned, just not for me.Watching Atonement has made me want to re-try the book again. And definitely watch the film again, to see if I can spot the little 'clues' that there's supposed to be throughout.

1143323,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,B0013K7ZPE,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[9, 11]","Atonement is a exquisite work of a film. Both lush and heartbreaking, it just sweeps you off your feet into this movie going experience that you rarely experience now a days, completly wrapping you in its spell that has you transfixed through out the entire film, from its tone setting beginning to its heart wrenching finale.On a particularily hot day in the English summer of 1935, young Briony Tallis witnesses a moment of sexual tension between her older sister, Cecily, and their housekeepers son Robbie. Far to young to understand the meaning of this event, she initially takes it as something negative and believes Robbie intends to harm her sister. So one night, she draws from her sexual naivete and childish ways to accuse Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Because of this small understanding and act of betrayel, Briony unwittingly sets into motion a series events that will ultimatly change the lives of her sister, Robbie, even herself for years to come.Technically wise, the film just exceeds beyond what you have seen on film. The cinamatography and art direction are just flat out stunning. Everything just seems to radiate this ethereal and richly refined look in almost every single frame, from the warm pastels of the hot English country side to the cold, grim gray's of WWII, its almost as if you are viewing a work of moving art or better yet, your actually seeing the texts from the book just come alive on screen, which in my opinion is a very difficult feat to achive with a book of such intrisant detail and depth. It baffled me that the film did not win in those awards at the Oscars, which I felt they rightfully deserved.All the acting is just phenomenal. Both Keira Knightly and James McAvoy are just fantastic as the star crossed lovers (and both shamefully snubbed by Oscar) and each three incarnations of Briony are all seemless. Saoirse Ronan shows off such a poise and grace that far succeds her teenage years as the young Briony, Romola Garai exudes a sense of remorse you can almost feel the weight of her actions on your shoulders, and finally, Venessa Redgrave tops it off in a devistating performance in just under seven minutes, all the sadness of her actions expressed in her eyes.Christopher Hampton does an excellent job on the screenplay, adapting from such a complex and deep book that can rarely ever be done. And Joe Wright just excels in the directors chair (especially with the now famous Dunkirk scene) turning what could have easily been another sappy love story into something far more complex, from acts of betrayle, effects of war, and the sheer fantasy of ones mind. The music score is just so unique the way the composer uses the sound of clacking typewriters, as if the events going on in the film are being written at that exact moment in Briony's mind. What I also love about the film is the way the characters speak and act, with the whole naturalistic manner you saw way back in the 1930's where the words were given very promptly and in a very direct speech, its like an almost modernized version of all those old classic films, which will definently appeal to an older audience. Now, on that note, some people may be turned off by the whole speech thing (since a lot of people nowadays are not used to that sort of dialect) but its really not that big of a deal and after a few minutes, it is not a such a big deal.Beautifully acted, masterfully shot, and experatly scored, Atonement is a movie going experience that should be seen by all, one that will follow you days after the final, haunting shot.",5,"Mesmerizing, Sensual, and Beautiful",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3567,"['Atonement', 'exquisite', 'work', 'film', 'lush', 'heartbreaking', 'just', 'sweeps', 'off', 'feet', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'rarely', 'experience', 'now', 'days', 'completly', 'wrapping', 'spell', 'transfixed', 'entire', 'film', 'tone', 'setting', 'beginning', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'finale.On', 'particularily', 'hot', 'day', 'English', 'summer', '1935', 'young', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'moment', 'sexual', 'tension', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecily', 'housekeepers', 'son', 'Robbie', 'Far', 'young', 'understand', 'meaning', 'event', 'initially', 'something', 'negative', 'Robbie', 'harm', 'sister', 'So', 'one', 'night', 'sexual', 'naivete', 'childish', 'ways', 'accuse', 'Robbie', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'small', 'understanding', 'act', 'betrayel', 'Briony', 'unwittingly', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'will', 'ultimatly', 'change', 'lives', 'sister', 'Robbie', 'even', 'years', 'come.Technically', 'wise', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'cinamatography', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'stunning', 'Everything', 'just', 'radiate', 'ethereal', 'richly', 'refined', 'look', 'almost', 'single', 'frame', 'warm', 'pastels', 'hot', 'English', 'country', 'side', 'cold', 'grim', 'gray', 'WWII', 'almost', 'are', 'viewing', 'work', 'moving', 'art', 'better', 'yet', 'actually', 'seeing', 'texts', 'book', 'just', 'come', 'alive', 'screen', 'opinion', 'very', 'difficult', 'feat', 'achive', 'book', 'such', 'intrisant', 'detail', 'depth', 'baffled', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'awards', 'Oscars', 'felt', 'rightfully', 'deserved.All', 'acting', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'shamefully', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'three', 'incarnations', 'Briony', 'are', 'seemless', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'off', 'such', 'poise', 'grace', 'far', 'teenage', 'years', 'young', 'Briony', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'sense', 'remorse', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'weight', 'actions', 'shoulders', 'finally', 'Venessa', 'Redgrave', 'off', 'devistating', 'performance', 'just', 'seven', 'minutes', 'sadness', 'actions', 'expressed', 'eyes.Christopher', 'Hampton', 'excellent', 'job', 'screenplay', 'adapting', 'such', 'complex', 'deep', 'book', 'can', 'rarely', 'ever', 'be', 'done', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'just', 'excels', 'directors', 'chair', 'especially', 'now', 'famous', 'Dunkirk', 'scene', 'turning', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'sappy', 'love', 'story', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'acts', 'betrayle', 'effects', 'war', 'sheer', 'fantasy', 'ones', 'mind', 'music', 'score', 'just', 'so', 'unique', 'way', 'composer', 'sound', 'clacking', 'typewriters', 'events', 'going', 'film', 'are', 'being', 'written', 'exact', 'moment', 'Briony', 'mind', 'What', 'also', 'love', 'film', 'way', 'characters', 'speak', 'act', 'whole', 'naturalistic', 'manner', 'saw', 'way', 'back', '1930', 'where', 'words', 'were', 'given', 'very', 'promptly', 'very', 'direct', 'speech', 'almost', 'modernized', 'version', 'old', 'classic', 'films', 'will', 'definently', 'appeal', 'older', 'audience', 'Now', 'note', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'whole', 'speech', 'thing', 'lot', 'people', 'nowadays', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'sort', 'dialect', 'really', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'few', 'minutes', 'not', 'such', 'big', 'deal.Beautifully', 'acted', 'masterfully', 'shot', 'experatly', 'scored', 'Atonement', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'will', 'follow', 'days', 'final', 'haunting', 'shot']",N/A
1143324,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B0013K7ZPE,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[48, 72]","When the luminous Vanessa Redgrave as Briony, the elderly woman who seeks atonement throughout this film, takes the screen at the very end of ""Atonement,"" this film finally makes sense, catches fire, and becomes thoughtful and meaningful. Redgrave adds Weight to the proceedings: something sorely lacking in this ""Epic"" love story.With that being said, I found ""Atonement"" a very beautiful and stunningly produced film. For once, the shifting between time periods and between the lives of Briony (as a child, as a young woman and as an elderly woman), Cecelia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy: finally coming into his own with this subtle, heartfelt performance) is not a problem, does not confuse but instead adds texture, friction and verisimilitude: this is a film of remembrance after all...of events, reactions and situations recalled by Briony at various stages of her life: a life seemingly dedicated to righting a wrong from her young life.In fact, ""Atonement"" is a film of penance. A film about a Mistake, a Misinterpretation, a film about a child's misplaced, unwanted and unwarranted love gone awry. Director Joe Wright (""Pride and Prejudice"") carefully even reverentially directs this material which in several ways reminds me of Lillian Hellman's ""The Children's Hour"" in that a child is at the center of a controversy and her words literally cause big problems for an adult. Oddly enough Briony and Mary in ""TCH"" are both of a so-called ""elevated"" social class while the object of their invective is not. Wright should have mined this conflict between classes a lot more than he does. As it is, it is dropped and instead ""Atonement"" becomes less than what it could have been.McAvoy's Robbie, though from simple beginnings, is obviously meant for great things. His mentor is Cecelia's father and he is off to Cambridge very soon after the film begins. McAvoy plays him with just the right amount of bragadaccio and humility: he knows he's smart, he knows that he is a star yet he knows his place...at least for the time being. Knightley's performance is more problematic. Her reactions sometimes smack of something akin to that of an American high school cheerleader in their lack of depth and feeling.But, no one can deny the sexual heat that she and McAvoy produce in their terrific scenes together. You truly believe that these two could/can/would bed each other: the penultimate scene of Cecelia and Robbie in the Tallis estate library both clawing at each other like two cats in heat... reeks of musk, bristling stiff starched clothing and silk underwear.""Atonement"" then is not a complete success but instead is an example of lost opportunities on the one hand and of a director adhering too close to the source material on the other. Despite all of this, this is a film of uncommon physical beauty. If only the thought processes behind this film could have matched or surpassed the physical concerns we would have had a major triumph here.

It is a rich, sweeping production; a touching romantic drama that transports you back to a simpler, albeit more dangerous, time and place.There is also a surprise, absolutely unforgettable ending.Ian McEwan's acclaimed novel was adapted to the screen by Christopher Hampton and directed by Joe Wright.Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play the star-crossed lovers whose lives are destroyed by a vicious lie told by her younger sister, played at different times on the picture by Oscar-nominated Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.With a great film, like ATONEMENT, you see many things in a second viewing that you missed the first time around.  For example, the occasional sound of a typewriter on the soundtrack takes on an entirely new meaning, as does a brief scene of McAvoy walking through a field of poppies.There is also a 5-minute stedicam sequence on the beach at Dunkirk that makes Orson Welles' brilliant opening sequence in TOUCH OF EVIL look like child's play.The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains two excellent ""Making of"" featurettes, deleted scenes and audio commentary by director Wright.

1143327,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,B0013K7ZPE,Michael K. Smith,"[1, 1]","To put it simply, this is an amazing film, wrenching, mesmerizing, beautiful, and painful, alternating poetry and brutality. It's a story of self-righteous misunderstanding and unreliable narration (on several levels), in which the events an overly impressionable young girl witnesses lead to the destruction of two lives -- three, if you count her own life. And, like the book, the ending, in which Briony, now on the verge of death, tells the interviewer the truth she couldn't quite tell in her novel (she's not really very brave), is upsetting and painful as well. There are no clean endings in real life. The screenplay is beautifully written, and extremely close to the novel -- closer than I would have thought possible, in fact. Keira Knightley is very good as Cecelia, though she doesn't really get a chance to emote in this role, Cecelia being a rather closed-off sort of person. James McAvoy nails the part of Robbie Hunter, unjustly imprisoned on Briony's testimony and the victim of class differences -- especially in the scenes in northern France, after the bitter years of imprisonment have taken their toll. But Saoirse Ronan turns in the best work in the film as the thirteen-year-old Briony. Romola Garai is pretty good, too, as Briony at eighteen, and Vanessa Redgrave is competent in her brief section as the aging Briony.

Her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) is developing a relationship with Robbie (McAvoy) the servant.  Cecelia herself has a crush on Robbie and is a bit jealous.  She does see him as a seducer and wants to protect Cecelia.  When a friend of the family is raped on the grounds, Briony offers up a lie that will change the three of their lives forever.""Atonement"" is an interesting, if tragic, movie.  It straddles a thin line between youthful misunderstanding and jealous maliciousness.  Briony is a tragic figure, played well by Ronan, Garai, and Redgrave, who spends her life trying to make up for a wrong that may or may not have been intentional.  McAvoy is solid as Robbie, the person whose life is most directly affected by her actions.  Director Joe Wright does a good job bringing war torn Europe to life.  The problem with ""Atonement"" is that, aside from having a main character in Briony that is mostly unlikable, the film is a bit of a downer.  This will not be a hit with mainstream audiences, and really was the weakest of the Best Picture nominees in 2007.

1143329,A3APPKALUGB2GT,B0013K7ZPE,Michelle888,"[1, 1]","Allow me to mention first that ATONEMENT is neither an epic love story, nor an epic war movie despite what I have concluded from the trailer.  The first time I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it, not because I have read the book, but because I was intrigued by the premise of the story.  Jealousy and betrayal seemed such good basis for a grand love story.  And after garnering several nominations from the sadly unglamorous Globes this year, and now the BAFTAS, I knew that I couldn't put off my trip to the movies.The opening scene of the movie and the way the title ATONEMENT itself is typed letter by letter is suggestive of its import to the movie.  The first part takes place on a hot summer day at an English country house.  We meet thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis, an aspiring writer with an avid imagination.  Briony has a crush on Robbie, the housekeeper's son, which is instantly apparent to the viewers from her first conversation with him as she invites him to see her play.  This film proves how we should be cautious of young girls with a fertile imagination.  In the scene where she sees Robbie and Cecilia by the fountain, one could almost feel the hurt and jealousy in Briony's eyes.  And thus is the extent of her fanciful imagination and petty jealousy that when she witnesses encounters beyond her comprehension, Briony falsely accuses Robbie of a crime he did not commit, an accusation that would alter their lives forever.The film quickly fast forward five years to wartime London. While the lie hasn't destroyed Robbie and Cecilia's love, its devastating impact forces them apart.  The film now follows Robbie as a soldier in France during the Dunkirk evacuation.  Here, we are greeted by several minutes of haunting images of the horrors of war.  The scene moves in an almost delirious pace ending with our hero in a feverish state.  Moments later and we are taken to a London hospital where we see a benevolent Briony working as a nurse.  Her aspiration hasn't changed, but she is wracked with guilt and intent on making amends for her mistakes.  In the second and third part of the film, so much focus is made on Robbie and Briony's lives that we end up losing sight of Cecilia. Before we know it, it is decades later and Vanessa Redgrave appears as an older Briony, where the story provides an unexpected twist.  Redgrave delivers a compelling performance in the very few minutes she appears leaving a lasting impression to the viewers.James McAvoy and all the Briony characters provide quite outstanding performances and, once again, Keira Knightly pouts - and smokes - her way through the film.  My gripe, which initially left me detached in the beginning, was the lack of background on Robbie and Cecilia's relationship.  I felt that another five minutes or so of character development would have added credibility to Robbie's feelings for the haughty Cecilia. Instead, it came across as more of a deep and unsated sexual attraction (quickly remedied in the library).  I also found the shifts in time quite distracting.  The cinematography, however, is superb.  That long, continuous take at Dunkirk is amazing (although that moving ferries wheel was distracting and seemed rather inappropriate for the mood).  The film score is wonderful and very evocative of the grief and heartbreak of the characters.  Oh, did I mention that green dress was stunning?  All in all, I'd say it was a good movie, though I don't believe it lived up to the hype.",3,Perhaps I would have felt differently had I read the book first...,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,3494,"['Allow', 'mention', 'first', 'ATONEMENT', 'epic', 'love', 'story', 'epic', 'war', 'movie', 'what', 'have', 'concluded', 'trailer', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'story', 'Jealousy', 'betrayal', 'seemed', 'such', 'good', 'basis', 'grand', 'love', 'story', 'garnering', 'several', 'nominations', 'sadly', 'unglamorous', 'Globes', 'year', 'now', 'BAFTAS', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'trip', 'movies.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'way', 'title', 'ATONEMENT', 'typed', 'letter', 'letter', 'suggestive', 'import', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'place', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'meet', 'thirteen-year-old', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'avid', 'imagination', 'Briony', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'housekeeper', 'son', 'instantly', 'apparent', 'viewers', 'first', 'conversation', 'see', 'play', 'film', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'cautious', 'young', 'girls', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'scene', 'where', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'fountain', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'hurt', 'jealousy', 'Briony', 'eyes', 'thus', 'extent', 'fanciful', 'imagination', 'petty', 'jealousy', 'when', 'encounters', 'comprehension', 'Briony', 'falsely', 'Robbie', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'accusation', 'would', 'alter', 'lives', 'forever.The', 'film', 'quickly', 'fast', 'forward', 'five', 'years', 'wartime', 'London', 'lie', ""n't"", 'destroyed', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'love', 'devastating', 'impact', 'forces', 'apart', 'film', 'now', 'Robbie', 'soldier', 'France', 'Dunkirk', 'evacuation', 'Here', 'are', 'greeted', 'several', 'minutes', 'haunting', 'images', 'horrors', 'war', 'scene', 'moves', 'almost', 'delirious', 'pace', 'ending', 'hero', 'feverish', 'state', 'Moments', 'later', 'are', 'taken', 'London', 'hospital', 'where', 'see', 'benevolent', 'Briony', 'working', 'nurse', 'aspiration', ""n't"", 'changed', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'intent', 'making', 'amends', 'mistakes', 'second', 'third', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'made', 'Robbie', 'Briony', 'lives', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'sight', 'Cecilia', 'know', 'decades', 'later', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'older', 'Briony', 'where', 'story', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'Redgrave', 'compelling', 'performance', 'very', 'few', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'lasting', 'impression', 'viewers.James', 'McAvoy', 'Briony', 'characters', 'provide', 'quite', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'once', 'again', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'smokes', 'way', 'film', 'My', 'gripe', 'initially', 'left', 'detached', 'beginning', 'was', 'lack', 'background', 'Robbie', 'Cecilia', 'relationship', 'felt', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'credibility', 'Robbie', 'feelings', 'haughty', 'Cecilia', 'Instead', 'came', 'more', 'deep', 'unsated', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'quickly', 'remedied', 'library', 'also', 'found', 'shifts', 'time', 'quite', 'distracting', 'cinematography', 'however', 'superb', 'long', 'continuous', 'take', 'Dunkirk', 'amazing', 'moving', 'ferries', 'wheel', 'was', 'distracting', 'seemed', 'rather', 'inappropriate', 'mood', 'film', 'score', 'wonderful', 'very', 'evocative', 'grief', 'heartbreak', 'characters', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'green', 'dress', 'was', 'stunning', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lived', 'up', 'hype']",N/A

Kiera did a great job, and McAvoy is so dang handsome and does such a great job with emotion, that I connected with him in this story. In fact, I am becoming a huge fan of this actor. He says so much with his facial expressions and his eyes. Anyway, the story is a great account of how an eye witness testimony can cause innocent people harm, especially when the witness isn't sure and claims that they are because of deep hurt and jealousy. Well, this movie was a great example of that. But it also showed the intense regret later as well as the progression of events that could have been prevented and thus changed the course of their lives. So bittersweet. The ending was tragic, but the author's testimony and how she wanted to make things right in the book because in real life everything went so wrong... well, I loved that. It was her attempt at atonement that made sense of the entire story. I would watch this movie again because there is so much depth to it.",5,Loved this story.

You have been conned by the author.Warning:  Everything that follows is a spoiler.  Please read it.  The story spoiled my taste for ever so long and with luck I can spoil your taste for either the book or the movie.But to be fair, I will first use some more space to give you a chance to avoid the spoiler if such is your choice.The cinematography of the movie was great.  The telling of the tale in both movie and novel was excellent.  Ian McEwan is a difficult writer to read and many will leave his stuff unfinished; but that will simply be a matter of taste.  Those who like subtlety and prose that is almost poetry will like the use of language and in the movie will appreciate the translation.If only we in the audience were not being cheated even as we are involved in it!The constant typing that surges up between scenes and simply as part of the scenes in the movie is quite appropos, and I enjoy the way the typing becomes music, something not achievable in the novel, but a stroke of genius in the movie.Alright you had your chance.  If you're still here, I am going to tell you why the story is so bad, at least to me, and why I actually take delight in ruining it for anyone else.Book and movie consist of three parts.  Parts I and III are truth and part II is the conclusion of a novel contrived by the guilty part of part I as an atonement for her guilt from part I but only revealed as a fiction in part III.  Knowing this in advance helps you understand my and many other's dislike for the story.Everything comes down to story ultimately.  The telling, the process, the quality of writing or acting -- all that is nothing more than outer show, a gilding.  In this case it is not a lily that is being gilded but something slimy, self-serving, and evil.In part I, in England, thirteen-year-old Briony is infatuated by the family's gardener Robbie, whose education her family has been paying for and who is planning to go off to medical school very soon.Robbie is in love and lust with Briony's older sister Cecilia.  An error of haste has Robbie give Briony the wrong letter of two he has written to Cecilia.  The first letter was a quiet apology for apparantly slighting Cecilia.  The second letter was written in fantasy and expresses in bald sexual terms his real lust for Cecilia.  This holds no problem for Cecilia, who reciprocates Robbie's feelings.  But, alas, Briony has read the letter and feels both slighted by the man for whom she has had such school-girlish affection and affronted by the boldness of his sexuality, which seems boorish to her and not what one would expect of a knight in shining armor.All of this is told us bracketed in the same twenty-four hour period.  At this point we are halfway through part I.That evening the following pertinent events happen:First, Briony who has by now read the letter and delivered it to her sister sees her sister having sex with Robbie.  It is a quick glimpse and the impression Briony carries away with her is one of violence more than sexuality, confirming her impression that her beloved Robbie is really a devil in disguise, one who did not appreciate her own offered affections and worse who now seeks only her older sister.Second, late that evening, while looking for some twin boys (guests in the house) who have strayed from the house, Briony comes across the boys' older sister engaged in a sexual act with some man who runs off.  She assumes the girl was being raped, and when she asks the girl if this is true, the girl confirms it.  Briony says she knows who was doing it, but the girl herself says she was unable to see her attacker.  Briony deliberately lies and says is was Robbie.  In part II and again in part III, it is made clear that the so-called rapist was actually a guest in the household with whom the girl was having a tryst.  The girl was too embarrassed to admit it; nor would the older man admit he was having sex with an under-age girl.  Instead, Briony makes her false accusation which stands uncontested by evidence or admission.In part III, we learn what happened next.  (We'll get to Part II in a short while).Robbie is sent to prison.  World War II is started.  It's four years later.  Robbie is given the chance to get out of prison by enlisting in the army.  He does.  He has a miserable time of it and dies at Dunkirk.  End of story for Robbie.Meanwhile, his beloved Cecilia has broken with her family and becomes a nurse.  She dies as the result of a London bombing after a somewhat miserable existence, herself.  End of story of Cecilia.Briony has by then long realized her mistake, if it really was a mistake, but she is too egocentric to own up to her guilt.  She admits it to no one; but instead embarks on a career as a writer.  She is quite successful and has twenty published books to her name.  We are not told what pleasures in life she had enjoyed, how her fame and wealth has buttressed her, what lovers she has had; but she certainly seems to have done rather well with herself.Now as she enters her mature years, she learns she has a fatal disease and finishes her twenty-first novel, Atonement.  She claims it is a totally accurate account of what actually happened and that this novel is her atonement for what she did when she was thirteen years old.  But even this is lie.  The first part of the novel is truth, it seems, and I certainly won't contest it.  The first part of the novel is Part I of the novel we have read.  But it is Part II of the novel that is shameful.  Part II of the novel is presented to us as Part II of the novel we are reading, also.  And in it is a totally fictional account of Robbie surviving the war to return to his beloved Cecilia and to live with her in love and lust.  The only trouble is, that we readers are not informed this is Briony's false account of reality; we think we are reading Robbie's and Cecilia's actual story, so we buy into it.  Only to have the rug jerked out from under us in Part III, where the truth is revealed.So what do you think.  Has Briony the fantastically successful author by writing a totally fake happy ending to Robbie's and Cecilia's love affair really atoned for the misery she caused and the deaths her lies led to?  Or is she merely trying to get her reader's affection and sympathy for her bravery in telling this not-so-true story that shows her as more remorseful and acting on this remorse than ever she was or ever she did?Alas, there is no one to like or root for in this movie.  The characters that touch our hearts in Part II turn out, even in fiction, to be fictional.  We see them only for one day and the rest is made up as an ""atonement"" by a really sick little girl who lives another fifty years without her so-called guilt in any way impinging on her creative skills or her ability to live well.Gee, hip, hip, hooray.  Imagine Hitler living until he was 95 years old, then writing an essay saying how sorry he was really was and that it was only a bad mistake on his part, and how with this essay he has atoned for all he did.  Yeah, right.Bravo, Briony.Thanks a lot, Ian MacEwan, you got me once again.",1,A Story That Cheats You,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,7267,"['Having', 'read', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have',

Though it beautifully captures the bygone English country lifestyle, this is much more than a doomed romance in a picturesque period setting. It is a story about the meaning of stories. In 1935, as Great Britain is on the brink of war, 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) has just completed her first play, which she intends to put on for her brother's visit. Her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightly) is beginning to express her long-felt interest in the housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy), on whom young Briony also had a crush. When envy and inexperience lead Briony to misinterpret Robbie's actions, her accusations have devastating consequences for all.Narratively, ""Atonement"" spends its most interesting day at the Tallis country manor. Briony is agitated by one incident after another. Cecelia and Robbie's flirtation is evolving. The guest list spells disaster. And this grand house, photographed to seem utterly labyrinthine, looms over everyone. Kudos to director Joe Wright for preserving the different perspectives so essential to the characters' experiences. But, thematically, it is the jump forward in time 5 years, then 60 years, that tells us what we need to know -not about Cecelia and Robbie, but about the fiction that undid them and that which preserves them. We're left, once again, to judge Briony's account of events, her choice of lies. ""Atonement"" gives thoughtful consideration to the impact of stories, while Keira Knightly and James McAvoy have great chemistry, and Saorise Ronan projects enough tension to keep us worried.The DVD (Universal 2008): There are 2 featurettes, 7 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a feature commentary. ""Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of Atonement"" (26 min) interviews director Joe Wright, novelist Ian McEwan, screenwriter Christopher Hampton, cast, and crew about the characters, the Tallis home, filming the retreat to Dunkirk, and themes. ""From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic"" (5 min) interviews Wright, McEwan, Hampton, and producer Paul Webster about adapting the novel to film. The feature commentary by director Joe Wright is interesting and informative. He takes us through the film, explaining his decisions, commenting on characters and how themes of storytelling and perspective are expressed.

It's more of a horror movie than any romance, and I got stuck drudging through it simply because it's pretty.The basic premise: young, upper-class girl with crush on older sister's poor, working-class suitor, misinterprets?, imagines?, falsifies?, a rape charge against him; WWII begins, lovers are separated, and younger sister begins journey for the rest of her life trying to fix it, even if it's just in her mind.Joe Wright(Pride and Prejudice) is a fabulous director.  His long, single shots are absolutely amazing.  For that alone, I could almost watch this painful eulogy.  He uses many of the same actors as P&P.;  The ubiquitous Keira Knightly and James McAvoy, I could watch in anything, but Knightly, unfortunately, is not the main character here.  Their romance is more of a prop for the story than the relish.  I don't need comedy or a solid, happy ending to make a great romance, but this story is more of a fable about self-centeredness and jealousy setting off bad karma.  The moral: one act, one wrong, is all you need to infect, drown and screw up the people you supposively love to destruction. Hmm.  Maybe, that's true.  For some.The other stalwart actors, like Brenda Blethyn, do their usual good jobs, although one-dimensionally.The flick uses the tried and worn (like a typical Shocker) technique of change of perspective.

1143338,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B0013K7ZPE,mljkb,"[4, 4]","This is the kind of stunning, soul-shaking drama that was long thought to be near dead, if not extinct.  Far from the kind of gritty, hit-and-run indie flick that many superficially similar films have been, this baby wears its high production values and dramatic pedigree on its sleeve with jaw-dropping cinematography, piercing writing, impeccable directing and uniformly stellar acting.  Director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have scored big time, resurrecting the kind of high caliber and emotionally earnest film that used to be made with regularity by major movie studios.  Where, I ask you, have been the Bravehearts, the Apollo 13's, the Forrest Gumps, the Shawshank Redemptions and the like, the movies that found the right blend of old-school Hollywood grandeur and gloss with artistic risk and thematic richness; the movies that reminded us why we loved movies in the first place?  They're a rare breed now-a-days (The Lord of the Rings a glorious exception) as it seems its either grandeur and gloss (The Pirates franchise) or artistic risk (No Country for Old Men).  But that's just another reason to love ""Atonement:"" it brings it all back, even if, ultimately, it's only briefly.The film opens in aristocratic England in 1935, the prolonged lull between the two great wars.  There, Robbie (James MacAvoy) tends the gardens of the upper crust Tallis family, while harboring secret longings for their eldest daughter Cecelia (Keira Knightley).  All the while, the youngest daughter Briony (Saoirse Ronan) quietly pines for Robbie, jealous of the attention he seems to pay to her older sister.  Her only outlet for her newly adolescent uncertainty is her unusually fertile imagination that crafts stories of daring and desperation.  Secrets and false perceptions lead to both Robbie and Cecelia to realize their mutual feelings and their undoing as Robbie is wrongfully accused of a horrible crime and Cecelia becomes estranged from her family.  To give away too much would be to spoil the raw emotional depth charges that sneak up, suffice it only to say that Briony's gifted mind betrays her.The film then jumps to 1940, with the British on their heels and retreating from France and the rampaging Nazi war machine (the audacious, breath-taking tracking shot of the British high-tailing it out of Dunkirk captures the ungodly cost and waste of war).  Robbie has been drafted into the Army and Cecelia and Briony have volunteered for the nursing corps.  But Briony is the outcast for inadvertently causing such pain for her older sister and the love of her life.  The one meeting between Cecelia and Robbie in a London coffee house before Robbie was to be shipped off to France speaks to true love, but also to enormous regret and chances lost. .  Theirs is a sincere romance tragically done in by forces beyond their control.  Knightley and MacAvoy may be young, but their acting chops are immense and far beyond their years.And that goes double for Ramona Garai, who portrays the teenaged Briony.  Her name is unknown for sure, but nonetheless she turns in the finest performance of the film.  In a movie whose major themes include regret and chances lost, she personifies the most potent: the perhaps futile quest for forgiveness for past transgressions, compounded, for Briony, by powerful feelings of shame that begat the cowardice to set things right and the knowledge that all the horrors that befall Robbie and Cecelia can be traced back to her wrongdoings.  It's Briony that needs to atone, and when she finally lays herself at the mercy of Cecelia and Robbie for forgiveness, Garai cuts to the bone.  Her eyes desperately, pleadingly search for that which she knows she will never deserve and it rips your heart out.  Later in life she will use her uncanny abilities for storytelling to vicariously atone for her sins, but it may never be enough.  Would it ever be enough for anyone?  Ponder that question, but do more.  See this stunner of a movie and be reminded of why and how movies can be powerful and entertaining simultaneously.",5,"""Atonement"" is an Absolute Stunner",1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,4076,"['kind', 'stunning', 'soul-shaking', 'drama', 'was', 'long', 'thought', 'be', 'near', 'dead', 'not', 'extinct', 'Far', 'kind', 'gritty', 'hit-and-run', 'indie', 'flick', 'many', 'superficially', 'similar', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'baby', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'dramatic', 'pedigree', 'sleeve', 'jaw-dropping', 'cinematography', 'piercing', 'writing', 'impeccable', 'directing', 'uniformly', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'have', 'scored', 'big', 'time', 'resurrecting', 'kind', 'high', 'caliber', 'emotionally', 'earnest', 'film', 'used', 'be', 'made', 'regularity', 'major', 'movie', 'studios', 'Where', 'ask', 'have', 'been', 'Bravehearts', 'Apollo', '13', 'Forrest', 'Gumps', 'Shawshank', 'Redemptions', 'like', 'movies', 'found', 'right', 'blend', 'old-school', 'Hollywood', 'grandeur', 'gloss', 'artistic', 'risk', 'thematic', 'richness', 'movies', 'reminded', 'why', 'loved', 'movies', 'first', 'place', ""'re"", 'rare', 'breed', 'now-a-days', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'glorious', 'exception', 'grandeur', 'gloss', 'Pirates', 'franchise', 'artistic', 'risk', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'just', 'reason', 'love', 'Atonement', 'back', 'even', 'ultimately', 'only', 'briefly.The', 'film', 'opens', 'aristocratic', 'England', '1935', 'prolonged', 'lull', 'two', 'great', 'wars', 'Robbie', 'James', 'MacAvoy', 'gardens', 'upper', 'crust', 'Tallis', 'family', 'harboring', 'secret', 'longings', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Cecelia', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'while', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Briony', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'quietly', 'Robbie', 'jealous', 'attention', 'pay', 'older', 'sister', 'only', 'outlet', 'newly', 'adolescent', 'uncertainty', 'unusually', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'crafts', 'stories', 'daring', 'desperation', 'Secrets', 'false', 'perceptions', 'lead', 'Robbie', 'Cecelia', 'realize', 'mutual', 'feelings', 'undoing', 'Robbie', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'horrible', 'crime', 'Cecelia', 'becomes', 'estranged', 'family', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'raw', 'emotional', 'depth', 'charges', 'sneak', 'up', 'suffice', 'only', 'say', 'Briony', 'gifted', 'mind', 'her.The', 'film', 'then', '1940', 'British', 'heels', 'retreating', 'France', 'rampaging', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'audacious', 'breath-taking', 'tracking', 'shot', 'British', 'high-tailing', 'Dunkirk', 'ungodly', 'cost', 'waste', 'war', 'Robbie', 'been', 'drafted', 'Army', 'Cecelia', 'Briony', 'have', 'volunteered', 'nursing', 'corps', 'Briony', 'outcast', 'inadvertently', 'causing', 'such', 'pain', 'older', 'sister', 'love', 'life', 'one', 'meeting', 'Cecelia', 'Robbie', 'London', 'coffee', 'house', 'Robbie', 'was', 'be', 'shipped', 'off', 'France', 'speaks', 'true', 'love', 'also', 'enormous', 'regret', 'chances', 'lost', 'sincere', 'romance', 'tragically', 'done', 'forces', 'control', 'Knightley', 'MacAvoy', 'may', 'be', 'young', 'acting', 'chops', 'are', 'immense', 'far', 'years.And', 'double', 'Ramona', 'Garai', 'who', 'teenaged', 'Briony', 'name', 'unknown', 'sure', 'nonetheless', 'finest', 'performance', 'film', 'movie', 'major', 'themes', 'include', 'regret', 'chances', 'lost', 'most', 'potent', 'perhaps', 'futile', 'quest', 'forgiveness', 'past', 'transgressions', 'compounded', 'Briony', 'powerful', 'feelings', 'shame', 'cowardice', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'knowledge', 'horrors', 'befall', 'Robbie', 'Cecelia', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'wrongdoings', 'Briony', 'atone', 'when', 'finally', 'mercy', 'Cecelia', 'Robbie', 'forgiveness', 'Garai', 'bone', 'eyes', 'desperately', 'pleadingly', 'search', 'will', 'never', 'deserve', 'heart', 'out', 'Later', 'life', 'will', 'use', 'uncanny', 'abilities', 'storytelling', 'vicariously', 'atone', 'sins', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'enough', 'Would', 'ever', 'be', 'enough', 'anyone', 'Ponder', 'question', 'do', 'more', 'See', 'stunner', 'movie', 'be', 'reminded', 'why', 'how', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'powerful', 'entertaining', 'simultaneously']",N/A

It's what Brits do best - superbly photographed period drama with serious actors, seriously acting.In 30's England in a stately manor, we are introduced to two sisters.  The elder (Keira Knightley, looking absolutely ravishing, and speaking in her best clipped tones..) is in love with Robbie (James Macevoy), who is not upper class but been a friend of the family for some years.  A moment charged with sexual tension is observed by the younger sister, Briony, is misinterpreted, and ultimately leads to a false accusation.  It is the results of that accusation that drive the movie that follows, and Briony's growing understanding of what she has done and how she can atone for it.Acting, particularly the three actresses playing Briony, is superb.  Even better is the stunning photography which is both beautiful and imaginative... although the much hyped Dunkirk beach scene comes off as more showing off than intrinsically useful to the story, as audacious as it is.  The Oscar winning score is outstanding, striking sombre, aching and dramatic notes as required, and punctuating scenes with the staccato rhythm of a typewriter to great effect.However, there is a pacing problem with the movie.  By shortening the novel in the section which shows what Robbie endures as a result of the accusation, we do not get a deep enough sense of the tragedy to make the pay-off as effective as it should be.  It's a quibble, but one which robs the movie of a good deal of its emotional impact.This is a great director's calling card, and fantastic viewing on many levels.

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","ATONEMENT ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years, boosted by some brilliant color photography, a lyrical background score, a well crafted script, and some fine ensemble performances. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines, but otherwise the cast is impeccable.Basically it's a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the English countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman (Knightley) and a handyman at her father's estate (JAMES McAVOY). Their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister Briony (amazing performance from SAOIRSE RONAN), who happens to spy on them from an upper window. She's a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her. He does, but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely exposed them both to danger.From that point on, the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives. In director Joe Wright's hands, the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied, by the conclusion, that the tale has been told in a very effective way.VANESSA REDGRAVE comes in toward the end, as the older version of the young woman who told a lie, and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting way.The standout performances are given by SAOIRSE RONAN as young Briony and JAMES McAVOY. McAvoy is impressive throughout, totally in command of a difficult role, almost emotionally draining in the film's detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shell-shocked manner. His confrontational moments with the eighteen year-old Briony (RAMOLA GARAI) are brilliantly played by both performers.Many stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale. This one is very powerful and yet, at the core, remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depth.The background score by Dario Marianelli , distinguished by lots of piano music, is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multi-layered story.",4,Magnificent love story given Ivory-Merchant kind of treatment...,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2418,"['ATONEMENT', 'one', 'classiest', 'love', 'stories', 'told', 'recent', 'years', 'boosted', 'brilliant', 'color', 'photography', 'lyrical', 'background', 'score', 'well', 'crafted', 'script', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'KEIRA', 'KNIGHTLEY', 'falters', 'too', 'clipped', 'way', 'speaking', 'throwing', 'away', 'important', 'lines', 'otherwise', 'cast', 'impeccable.Basically', 'dreamy', 'looking', 'tale', 'wealthy', 'family', 'enjoying', 'summer', 'days', 'English', 'countryside', 'are', 'hints', 'gentle', 'romance', 'going', 'rather', 'snobbish', 'young', 'woman', 'Knightley', 'handyman', 'father', 'estate', 'JAMES', 'McAVOY', 'obvious', 'infatuation', 'other', 'only', 'jealousy', 'younger', 'sister', 'Briony', 'amazing', 'performance', 'SAOIRSE', 'RONAN', 'who', 'spy', 'upper', 'window', 'girl', 'who', 'once', 'threw', 'young', 'man', 'pretending', 'drown', 'so', 'would', 'jump', 'rescue', 'annoyed', 'when', 'purposely', 'exposed', 'danger.From', 'point', 'plot', 'forward', 'backward', 'structure', 'never', 'clumsy', 'even', 'past', 'events', 'present', 'tell', 'tale', 'how', 'single', 'lie', 'course', 'three', 'lives', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'hands', 'tale', 'never', 'maudlin', 'too', 'complicated', 'follow', 'see', 'development', 'strong', 'characters', 'are', 'satisfied', 'conclusion', 'tale', 'been', 'told', 'very', 'effective', 'way.VANESSA', 'REDGRAVE', 'end', 'older', 'version', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'told', 'lie', 'surprising', 'comments', 'make', 'wind', 'up', 'tale', 'oddly', 'affecting', 'way.The', 'standout', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'SAOIRSE', 'RONAN', 'young', 'Briony', 'JAMES', 'McAVOY', 'McAvoy', 'impressive', 'totally', 'command', 'difficult', 'role', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'film', 'detailed', 'war', 'scenes', 'have', 'wandering', 'around', 'almost', 'shell-shocked', 'manner', 'confrontational', 'moments', 'eighteen', 'year-old', 'Briony', 'RAMOLA', 'GARAI', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'performers.Many', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'where', 'lie', 'very', 'center', 'part', 'extending', 'whole', 'tale', 'one', 'very', 'powerful', 'yet', 'core', 'tender', 'love', 'story', 'tremendous', 'emotional', 'depth.The', 'background', 'score', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'distinguished', 'lots', 'piano', 'music', 'highly', 'effective', 'creating', 'many', 'changing', 'moods', 'multi-layered', 'story']",N/A

So how on earth do you transfer this level of complexity to the screen?Well, in this case, wholly successfully.

And the weaknesses? Only one... the reconstructions of Dunkirk and the soldiers' trek to it are too stylised and self-conscious and, as result, fail to reflect the bleakness and horror that McEwan projects.

Briony (played as a young girl by Saoirse Ronan), the youngest member of the family at 13, is a budding writer, concocting plays and other works to be presented at family gatherings. We also meet Cecilia Tallis (played with heartbreak by Kiera Knightley), Briony's gorgeous older sister. During the early course of the film, Cecilia learns that Robbie (James McAvoy), educated son of the family housekeeper, is in love with her. In a moment of almost-shock, Cecilia realizes that she returns this love.Young Briony, who happens to have a crush on Robbie herself, accidentally walks in on the two lovers one pivotal evening. Events later that night lead to Briony accusing Robbie of a crime he didn't commit. His quick arrest, and subsequent enrollment in the British army (WWI), deny Robbie and Cecilia the time together that they so long for.Years later, Briony sorts through what happened, understanding her terrible error and what it meant, leading to the title of the film.This film is beautiful to look at. Shots are carefully composed. Period costuming, hair, makeup, and props are impeccable. Keira Knightley wears an emerald gown that is a revelation. It is cut so delicately that it even makes her stick-thin body look curvy.Performances are amazing. Knightley portrays Cecilia as achingly bewildered by her feelings, then stricken with yearning at being separated from her lover. McAvoy's Robbie is a triumph, particularly in the scenes during his military service. There is a slow, uninterrupted shot of his face, during which he discovers the evidence of a mass execution, that will stay with me a long time. An older Briony is played in a genius turn by Vanessa Redgrave at the end of the film, summing up the heart of the tale.I sobbed like a baby at the end.

It is a project with fantastic actors, a great screenplay, an innovative director and pitch-perfect photography.The story starts in an English country house one hot summer. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), an imaginative 12 year-old is busy finishing her first play and trying desperately to get someone to act it out or even listen to her. Her older sister Cecilia is walking through the house not noticing anyone, especially not Briony, busy thinking about the housekeeper's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), who is obviously in love with her. A series of unfortunate events leads Briony to jealously tell a lie - a lie that will bring utter unhappiness to all three characters. Once separated, we follow these three through World War II, and watch as the story unfolds into unexpected directions.There is no real star of ""Atonement"" - everyone, absolutely everyone involved in the project is pitch-perfect. Be it young Briony, played with perfection by the newcomer Ronan - her performance is so natural, yet complex, she single-handedly draws you into the movie during the first few minutes. Knightley and McAvoy are a couple perfect for this kind of movie (""Atonement"" is, after all, the most romantic film of the year), sharing that old Hollywood glamour that has recently been forgotten - Knightley's Cecilia is your regular romantic heroine, especially during the intense, early scenes at the mansion, when she slides around in a silky green dress, detached from the environment by her own beauty and attitude. McAvoy, on the other hand, brings an emotional performance that we like to see in our romantic heroes.The movie features one strong, emotional scene after another.

Upper-class Cecilia {Keira Knightley} and grounds-keeper Robbie {James McAvoy} -- who is always GREAT -- have been attracted to each other forever.  Finally, they cannot deny their atttraction and love for one another.  Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, is always lurking around and is constantly stumbling upon situations involving Cecilia and Robbie.  To me, Briony, is nothing but a BAD SEED and trouble.  The young actress who played her, Saoirse Ronan, was GREAT.Briony witnesses a crime and accuses Robbie.  The write up on the movie box said Briony is confused and mistakenly accuses Robbie -- me?  I think she knew EXACTLY what she was doing.  Briony was an evil little brat.  Her blank stares gave me the creeps.  Ronan is a great little actress.The movie is wonderful, the book is probably excellent and I think I will give it another shot.  The movie flew by quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute!!!My only problem with this movie was I had a hard time understanding Keira Knightly.  She seemed to speak too softly and quickly and I had to back up several times to catch what she had said.Rent ATONEMENT, buy ATONEMENT, or read ATONEMENT.

Kellner ""PAK""","[7, 8]","""Atonement"" directed by Joe Wright and based off of the novel ""Atonement"" by Ian Mcewan.England, 1935; 13 year old Briony Tallis busies herself and her visiting cousins by attempting to put together a play she has written. Things fall apart and she decides to visit with her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightly) and the family's employee and friend Robbie Turner (James Mcavoy). With her visit over she returns inside. Through her window Briony views some interaction between Cecilia and Robbie. From her perspective the interaction seem tense and aggressive on Robbie's part. Another honest mistake on Robbie's part later that day coupled with a moment shared between Cecilia and Robbie not intended for others to see leaves Briony with the wrong impression and the results are catastrophic...My feelings on ""Atonement"" are mixed. On the one hand you have spectacular acting, great cinematography and directing giving you a beautiful movie to look at and on the other you have a story that comes across somewhat mish mashed lending to a feeling of meandering. The end of the movie wraps it all up and almost saves it but I was still left feeling like the end wasn't worth the journey there.The Good: As stated this was a great looking movie. The location selection, the directing and the cinematography are all spectacular. The acting was great all around. Keira Knightly on screen is also always a positive for me.The Bad: I had trouble getting behind how the story unfolded. I am ok with non-linear story lines but ""Atonement"" was broken up and re-hashed in a way that just didn't work for me. First you get one perspective then another, then it jumps forward 13 weeks, then back 9 to someone else's perspective. I was just left wondering the whole time where it was going and what it was all about. It felt like a train wreck all the way up to the end which did help Atonement to save some face.Overall: A great looking picture that fell short in delivery.

At first I thought the director was a little indulgent in making the mansion too much of a character in the film.  I got the point of wealth early on, but the theme may have been trodden down a bit with the endless walking through the hallways.  Next, it's been a while since I was in Britain and I found myself turning on the English subtitles in order to understand the dialog.  The actors, especially Keira Knightley who plays the older sister Cecelia, talked entirely too fast.  I have been in the conversations of aristocrats while in England and their manner is slow and deliberate, not speedy.  I guess we're to surmise her younger years and impetuousness precipitates her very rapid conversation.  I literally timed one sentence that was two full lines long spouted in about half a second...quite irritating.  So much so, I turned off the movie and watched at a later time when the house was quiet and I could put on my headphones to listen.  Next, and no fault of the movie, the plot.  Nothing rubs me wrong more than an unjustly convicted perpetrator.  I have lost count of how many times I've watched movies and TV shows where we know the hero has been locked up for a crime he didn't do.  And, finally, as in all British movies, the pace was a little tedious.  Watching the special features tells me the director was conscious of this and cut a few scenes to keep the main story alive.  So, I guess by British standards, it was fast.Now the things I liked.  Some excellent performances by Knightley (save for the rapid lips) and McAvoy.  The intensity was real and not contrived.  And I liked how the director kept the intensity and theme with the use of the typewriter sounds in synch with the music and movement of Briony.  The cinematography was excellent, especially the 5-minute walk-through of the chaos on Dunkirk beach.  This was real epic film making with very few special effects.  The director used some 1000 local extras to make it happen.  Finally, although I haven't read the book, I was led to believe that the screenplay was rewritten to follow the book as closely as possible.  This materialized into several flashbacks which could have been confusing until it was nicely rapped up with Vanessa Redgrave as the 77-year old Briony explaining the meaning of the novel ""she wrote.""This is not a feel good movie, so don't expect your typical chick flick happily ever after ending.

The acting too, is not bad, and for the first fifteen minutes I watched in happy anticipation. Then the rot set in. The storyline took a tremendous dip, from which it never recovered.  Suffice to say there's nothing uplifting about this story, and the only characters in it who enjoyed the least success and attainment of life's goals were the ones who least deserved it. I'm really not a great fan of bait and switch ads in movies, where a movie purports to be one thing, and when you come to see it, it's quite another. Obviously they didn't feel they could sell the story as it was.  I also couldn't believe the premise of the story, that it required at least two people to be so completely without conscience, not just for a moment, but through horrendous consequences, and that Cee was so ineffectual that she couldn't have explained the situation or got at at least one of the accusers to get to the truth.  Even the end of the movie has a twisting deception as to the outcome laid out in the middle, so to speak, so it's not just the previews that were misleading.

How does one believe a person to be telling the truth when he or she confesses to being a liar?)  Poststructuralism is the real star of this film, as the perception of what happened vs. reality battle it out to assert itself as official history.  The subtext here is that if personal history is subjective, then recounts of war events themselves bear reinspection.

1143364,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0013K7ZPE,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 3]","I started the book quite a while ago and dropped it after about the first third, mostly because I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  Full disclosure;  I listened on the audio version, usually while driving so it's possible that if I had read the actual ""book"" I might have enjoyed it more.  I think that part of my problem was the class thing--the characters seemed so snobby and over-privileged, especially the two sisters, that I had a hard time caring about them.So, in my case anyway, the film overcame that problem instantly by its gorgeous visuals.  From the first scene of the abundant greenery surrounding the huge country  home, I was taken in.  Then the casting---the stunning Keira Knightly and the hunky-but-sensitive James McAvoy--overcame any resistance I'd had to these characters.Of course the theme of the story is atonement and we are given a fascinating tale of how the words of a 13 year old girl lead to the destruction of the two people she most loves.  It's interesting to read the reviews of the film, here, and also of the book, to analyze Briony, the 13 year old.  Many reviewers see her as an evil child who deliberately lied about the crime due to her spurned crush on Robbie.  A few see Briony in a more charitable light--that of a spoiled and neglected younger child who lives in the world of her imagination so strongly that she may not realize her own mistake.  Some see her action as trying to protect Cecilia from Robbie, who, by that point, has become a monster in her eyes.What I see as a weakness in the film is the lack of the family background which would present Briony's action in a more understandable way.  Reviews of the book are more charitable to Briony than the film reviewers because of this lack of information, I think.  The book tells us that this is highly dysfunctional family; the father is frequently away with his mistress, leaving the mother suffering from incapacitating migraines.  Her consolation seems to lie in her children and she spoils the young Briony giving her delusions of grandeur for her literary ability.  The father has taken a liking to Robbie, the son of the servant, because he has motivation for academic success that his own son, Leon, lacks.  When Robbie outperforms Leon at University, this is a cause for the mother to dislike him, which lays the groundwork for the ensuing tragedy.  The alleged victim of the crime keeps still and allows an innocent man to go to prison, as does the real perpetrator.  The class system, itself, undoubtably plays a part in the injustice.  In my mind, there is plenty of blame to go around.There is a question of whether Briony deliberately and knowingly lied or if she was a victim of her own innocence,need for approval and genuine shock at the sexual scenario and honestly misunderstood what happened. As another reviewer of the book wrote, even Cecilia could have done more to discover the truth by questioning Briony and Lola, but she,too,was stuck in her own misperceptions.The book, too, gives more of the background of Lola, who is suffering from the fact that her parents are being divorced.  This makes her more than a willing party to the sexual advances of the chocolate king which are later interpreted as a crime. Indeed she later marries him.  The book gives such a thorough background of the whole family that it is an accident waiting to happen.  And on the hottest day of the summer, it does.The film, however, treats this as Briony's crime and we follow her as she matures and gradually realizes the seriousness of the consequences of her action.  We are given some graphic views of the war, which some people think are not necessary to the story.  My feeling is that in seeing the depth of Robbie's suffering, we feel the tragedy that this lie has brought about.Perhaps another screenwriter might have given us more of the psychological background of the family and less of the sheer physical horror of war and this might have made for a more satisfying story...who knows?The ending is problemmatic for many viewers, as well as for the readers of the book.  As I watched the film, I bought into the idea of the elder Briony atoning for her ""crime"" as well as she could by re-writing the story of Robbie and Cecilia, giving them, as an act of ""kindness, the time together that they deserved. One can speculate on the nature of art and the role of the writer in portraying reality but I won't bother here.I did feel that this ending was satisfying in an intellectual way but that it was thin soup emotionally.  The huge suffering that we saw built up a huge expectation of something equally great to wind up the story and this little performance by the elder writer in a tv interview really didn't do it for me.In sum, this is a wonderful film and certainly worth seeing.

And how the editing captured the tension, thought that was clever as well.  Loved the music with the imitation of the typewriter keys.The sex scene, could have been a lot better.  It was different, in how they shot it.  But it didn't seem to portray the heat of the moment, in the way they shot it, what they focused on, and what they had the actors doing or not doing.And it felt like, either the author of the book didn't have the depth in his story and characters, or the screenwriter didn't do a good adaption of it from book to script, or the director didn't wasn't pulling that intensity out of the actors for it to make it to the shots.  I know both the main actors, can do intensity..but I didn't feel the depth of how they felt when I watched them on the screen..they didn't burn and ache for each other on screen, like I felt, based on the story they were telling, demanded.And I felt the pacing of the film was a little lacking, which is why it seemed so long and drawn out to me...course this may have had to do with the film trying to cram so much of the book in it and/or because of the way the book was written.I did enjoy the ending however, but I assume I owe that to the author of the book, and not the film makers.Overall, it seemed pretty long and drawn out.",3,"A little long in the tooth, didn't captivate",1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,1465,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'Toss', 'upHave', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'book', 'version', 'film', 'version.I', 'thought', 'shots', 'were', 'very', 'clever..and', 'very', 'different', 'was', 'nice', 'how', 'editing', 'captured', 'tension', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'as', 'well', 'Loved', 'music', 'imitation', 'typewriter', 'keys.The', 'sex', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'was', 'different', 'how', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'portray', 'heat', 'moment', 'way', 'shot', 'what', 'focused', 'what', 'had', 'actors', 'doing', 'not', 'doing.And', 'felt', 'author', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'story', 'characters', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'adaption', 'book', 'script', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'pulling', 'intensity', 'actors', 'make', 'shots', 'know', 'main', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'intensity..but', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'depth', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'watched', 'screen..they', 'did', ""n't"", 'burn', 'ache', 'other', 'screen', 'felt', 'based', 'story', 'were', 'telling', 'demanded.And', 'felt', 'pacing', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'lacking', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'course', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'film', 'trying', 'cram', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'way', 'book', 'was', 'written.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'however', 'assume', 'owe', 'author', 'book', 'not', 'film', 'makers.Overall', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'long', 'drawn', 'out']",N/A

Much of the movie is coloured by perception. Most see Briony's 'lie' as the act of a spoilt, selfish brat motivated by jealousy. I see it as something different as an act from a young girl misintepreting what she sees and her mind embellishing on it. Briony sees the scene at the fountain, but doesn't 'see' it. She witnesses the back of Robbie and an upraised hand, followed by her sister stripping and diving into a pool, it is this that starts her off. Not the note, though the note does compound the issue and the library scene clarifies it for her in a heartbeat. That's not counting her 'talk' with Lola, who confirms that the note makes Robbie sound like a sex maniac and when the 'rape' happens. It is not wholly Briony's lie that seals Robbie's fate. Lola, does not talk and clear Robbie, because she doesn't want the real culprit to be found. When Briony misinteprets the scene, Lola allows her to settle on Robbie as the offender.The movie is dreamy and fairly slow, yet I do not see this as a handicap, it unfolds at the right place and draws you in. You are left at the end feeling sorrowful and yet surprised. Briony's 'atonement' also encompasses the revelation of the real 'rapist' and unfortunately this is not fully expounded upon. In the novel, it is made plain that the Marshalls' are sufficiently powerful to quash any scandal which is why the book takes so long to materialise, Briony must wait until her death to reveal the truth. It is the one place where the movie fails to keep up with the book and in doing so, we don't get a full feel of her atonement.A beautiful movie, gorgeous in look, feel and tone.

1143368,A1VHGHK5NN7NGN,B0013K7ZPE,Raymond Louis Llompart,"[0, 2]","I just finished watching ""Atonement"" AND reading both the original reviews from the NYTimes and the New Yorker.........BOTH more or less pan the movie primarily BECAUSE they have read the book and constantly make comparisons between the two. This is a more than rather unfair practice of reviewers, but arguably inevitable, since an assumption is that a film critic is a voracious reader as well and three or five (or ten) years the movie is released and it is extremely hard to separate the two. That has been the case for me, and all you do then is complain endlessly about how the book (because it is rarely the other way around) is so superior to the film.That wasn't the case today. I had read the original reviews to the Ian McEwan's masterly novel, but barely remembered plot, so my mind was without PREJUDICE.It is a more than entertaining movie. It is convoluted, because the director insists on playing with our intellect? in insisting to go back and forth in time with no seeming reason whatsoever. The device can be highly effective, but I found no place for it in its use here.Its pace is S-L-O-W, perhaps for the first 45 minutes, and we need to focus, and in this ever-increasing ""texting"" world---------well, WHERE will we find the mental ease to simply quiet down and let time pass? No wonder classical music continues to decline in its quota of those who make it a part of their lives..........Things ""pick up"" for the ""action"" crowd after a terrible injustice has been committed, and we are suddenly confronting the horrors of war. The above-mentioned reviewers were dissatisfied with its direction, but as one who saw ""Private Ryan"" several years ago, and NEVER RECOVERED from the mediocrity of Steven Spielberg's candy-coated melodramas (with an armor of insistence that they are intellectual triumphs), I found everything believable AND presented with a certain horror in a narrow example of war, and not all-encompassing. Nothing wrong with that.The lead couple are, well, beautiful, exquisitely photographed, and one (shallow) reason to see the movie, but again the playing around with events' timing is distressing and requires more than a bit of effort.At the end, I was touched and more than a bit satisfied with the film, but the fact that it is revealed (by no less than Vanessa Redgrave, in yet ANOTHER magnificent performance) that a lot of what we saw was imagined and not the truth is perplexing.The ""Atonement"" is hard to digest---------and creates, perhaps, another layer of doubt for the viewer as to how much of it has indeed been atoned----------for THEM or for US?????Don't go about presenting me a film in which we are following ""reality"" to then come to its end, and have one of its principal characters, a writer and the one who has struggled with her atonement, tell us that everything was a work of fiction that she created to ""atone"" for it all, and that much of what we saw in the film's blossoming of love between the couple was invented to have THEM, perhaps spiritually?, find unity---when none of it had happened and the truth was grim and appalling..........Ah------yes, it is more than a bit complicated, and a curious set of twists that make you doubt the entire resolution. Perhaps in prose all sorts of magic are given life to a rather plausible, yet bizarre denouement for us on the other side.Yet, again, it works in many ways--------its conveyance of wild, mad, deeply painful love has, to me, an allure that is fascinating to watch.......A CAVEAT: whenever this system of ratings was created, perhaps they were dealing with teenagers? I would give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars, what to me would be a standard, accepted way of rating through time (just check the explanation of the NYTimes' own rating stars) but here the CRUDE, cheap definition for choosing stars is extremely poor in its  creation-------this ""I like it"", ""I hate it"", ""I love it"" way of defining stars given is extremely adolescent and, well-----one is stuck with it...Why bother, then, no?...................",4,Convoluted--------- and more than a little fragmented.........,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,4037,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Atonement', 'reading', 'original', 'reviews', 'NYTimes', 'New', 'Yorker', 'BOTH', 'more', 'less', 'movie', 'primarily', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'constantly', 'make', 'comparisons', 'two', 'more', 'rather', 'unfair', 'practice', 'reviewers', 'arguably', 'inevitable', 'assumption', 'film', 'critic', 'voracious', 'reader', 'well', 'three', 'five', 'ten', 'years', 'movie', 'released', 'extremely', 'hard', 'separate', 'two', 'been', 'case', 'do', 'then', 'complain', 'endlessly', 'how', 'book', 'rarely', 'other', 'way', 'so', 'superior', 'film.That', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'today', 'had', 'read', 'original', 'reviews', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'masterly', 'novel', 'barely', 'remembered', 'plot', 'mind', 'was', 'PREJUDICE.It', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'convoluted', 'director', 'playing', 'intellect', 'insisting', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'seeming', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'device', 'can', 'be', 'highly', 'effective', 'found', 'place', 'use', 'here.Its', 'pace', 'S-L-O-W', 'perhaps', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'need', 'focus', 'ever-increasing', 'texting', 'world', '-well', 'WHERE', 'will', 'find', 'mental', 'ease', 'simply', 'quiet', 'down', 'let', 'time', 'pass', 'wonder', 'classical', 'music', 'decline', 'quota', 'who', 'make', 'part', 'lives', 'pick', 'up', 'action', 'crowd', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'been', 'committed', 'are', 'suddenly', 'confronting', 'horrors', 'war', 'above-mentioned', 'reviewers', 'were', 'dissatisfied', 'direction', 'one', 'who', 'saw', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'NEVER', 'RECOVERED', 'mediocrity', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'candy-coated', 'melodramas', 'armor', 'insistence', 'are', 'intellectual', 'triumphs', 'found', 'everything', 'believable', 'presented', 'certain', 'horror', 'narrow', 'example', 'war', 'not', 'all-encompassing', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'that.The', 'lead', 'couple', 'are', 'well', 'beautiful', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', 'one', 'shallow', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'playing', 'around', 'events', 'timing', 'distressing', 'more', 'bit', 'effort.At', 'end', 'was', 'touched', 'more', 'bit', 'satisfied', 'film', 'fact', 'revealed', 'less', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'yet', 'ANOTHER', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'lot', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'imagined', 'not', 'truth', 'perplexing.The', 'Atonement', 'hard', 'digest', '-and', 'creates', 'perhaps', 'layer', 'doubt', 'viewer', 'how', 'much', 'indeed', 'been', 'atoned', 'THEM', 'US', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'presenting', 'film', 'are', 'following', 'reality', 'then', 'come', 'end', 'have', 'one', 'principal', 'characters', 'writer', 'one', 'who', 'struggled', 'atonement', 'tell', 'everything', 'was', 'work', 'fiction', 'created', 'atone', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'film', 'blossoming', 'love', 'couple', 'was', 'invented', 'have', 'THEM', 'perhaps', 'spiritually', 'find', 'unity', '-when', 'none', 'had', 'happened', 'truth', 'was', 'grim', 'appalling', '.Ah', 'yes', 'more', 'bit', 'complicated', 'curious', 'set', 'twists', 'make', 'doubt', 'entire', 'resolution', 'Perhaps', 'prose', 'sorts', 'magic', 'are', 'given', 'life', 'rather', 'plausible', 'yet', 'bizarre', 'denouement', 'other', 'side.Yet', 'again', 'many', 'ways', 'conveyance', 'wild', 'mad', 'deeply', 'painful', 'love', 'allure', 'fascinating', 'watch', '.A', 'CAVEAT', 'whenever', 'system', 'ratings', 'was', 'created', 'perhaps', 'were', 'dealing', 'teenagers', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '3', '5', 'stars', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'standard', 'accepted', 'way', 'rating', 'time', 'just', 'check', 'explanation', 'NYTimes', 'own', 'rating', 'stars', 'here', 'CRUDE', 'cheap', 'definition', 'choosing', 'stars', 'extremely', 'poor', 'creation', 'like', 'hate', 'love', 'way', 'defining', 'stars', 'given', 'extremely', 'adolescent', 'well', '-one', 'stuck', 'Why', 'bother', 'then']",N/A

DelParto ""Rose2""","[1, 1]","Based on Ian McEwan's best-selling novel, Director Joe Wright produces an amazing and stunning film that respectively complements the book.  The film and storyline may appear to be the typical love story.  However, it is much more complicated and threefold.  First, the romance between Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and the wild imaginations of Cecilia's wide-eyed and presumptuous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who would cause her own lifetime of regret.  Second, Cecilia and Robbie finding their way back together despite a war torn landscape.  And third, Briony's attempt to reconcile and atone the wrong she had done between Cecilia and Robbie with the publication of her memoir.The cinematography is cleverly and beautifully shot.  If one closely looks at how the film proceeds like an Alfred Hitchcock mystery, the storyline is not cut and dry, and one will see how the fragments of events evolve and revise from the conflicting beginning to the climactic end.  Briony's character reveals how facts of her personal past can easily be changed for a desirable fictitious narrative; indeed, her character steals the show.  And although this may look like a love and war film as displayed in the grotesque and surreal Dunkirk scenes and scenes of Robbie's undying love for Cecilia, it is Briony's self-discovery and maturity she eventually achieves at the end of the film.As with many novels that have been made into films, the film is missing some of the graphic and detailed narrative that the novel provides.  If Wright had made a duplicate of McEwan's book, the film would have been longer.

This film is meant to capture the story of a young girl who due to unusual set of circumstances is a witness to the startling attraction between her beautiful sister and her own platonic love, housekeeper's son Robbie.  She is much younger that her sister and a young lad and confused and startled about their behavior while they are together. Her sister on the other hand, is beautiful and well aware of her high social standing.  The yound man Robbie, she is attracted to, is housekeeper's son and in spite of his obvious handsome apperance and smartness (he is a scholarship kid attending medical school at Ivies) far from a catch for a girl of her social standing.  But their mutual sexual attraction and electrofying desire will diminish all social constraints.  It is the young girl who stands in the way of their happiness and her accusation against the young man inexplicable even to herself, is a cause of their demise and her eternal sorrow for her actions.  I really enjoyed James McAwoy's performance and Vanessa Redgrave's appearance at the end of the movie is a real treat.

1143374,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,B0013K7ZPE,R. Geatz,"[2, 2]","I was initially attracted to the movie of Atonement, but decided to read the novel first. I had not read any of McEwan's work before, and was captivated by the book in ways I haven't been in a long time. I'm surprised by those who found it and the movie tedious; for me, it was that detail that made it so compelling. It's rare that I find myself reading passages over and over again simply because the language is so beautiful and clever. Of course the downside of enjoying a novel so much is that a movie adaptation can rarely live up to expectations. [SPOILERS AHEAD]This might be one of the best adaptations of a novel I have seen. And the concluding section where Brioni, near the end of her life (and played by the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave), sits down for a TV interview to explain her ""atonement"" was a masterful reinterpretation of what was more of an interior monologue in the novel. In some ways, visualizing what really happened to the lovers versus the ""better ending"" Brioni gave them in her novel made the multi-layered tragedy even more devastating.I know this kind of film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for me it's exhilarating when a filmmaker pushes the boundaries of standard Hollywood fare and succeeds. This isn't a ""feel good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a bit distressing reading comments from those who hated the movie. Some resented the repetition of scenes from different perspectives--but that was the point: we each see things differently based on many variables, sometimes with devastating results. I'm amazed to read those who wanted more ""atonement"" than they got. For them, I suspect, Brioni needed to do penance like some medieval nun, but how does one atone for ""innocently"" ruining loved ones' lives other than to live with the guilt and right it as best as possible by devoting your singular talent over the course of your adult life to give your sister the happier ending she deserved--in art at least, if not in life?I like mindless, entertaining movies like everyone else. But I also, occasionally, like to see movies that require me to be a more active participant, that challenge me to think in different ways, that touch my emotions in sometimes unpleasant ways. My dear sister, for instance, won't see any movie that ""might make me sad."" What I find troubling about some of the criticism of Atonement is that some impatient viewers not only didn't ""get it;"" they seem to resent the fact that the movie didn't allow them to be passive recipients of entertainment. That's sad.A plus of the DVD/blu-ray edition of this movie is the bonus materials. I'm always intrigued to see scenes that were ultimately cut from the final release and the rationale for doing so. And it's always interesting to see how some powerful scenes were accomplished technically--like the 360-degree pan of Normandy beach (which another reviewer here didn't like because it ""wasn't how it really happened."" Arrgh). Despite it's immense sadness, this is a movie I will watch repeatedly over the years.",5,A surpringly great adaptation of a very good novel,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,3040,"['was', 'initially', 'attracted', 'movie', 'Atonement', 'decided', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'McEwan', 'work', 'before', 'was', 'captivated', 'book', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'tedious', 'was', 'detail', 'made', 'so', 'compelling', 'rare', 'find', 'reading', 'passages', 'over', 'again', 'simply', 'language', 'so', 'beautiful', 'clever', 'course', 'downside', 'enjoying', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'can', 'rarely', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', '[', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', ']', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'novel', 'have', 'seen', 'concluding', 'section', 'where', 'Brioni', 'end', 'life', 'played', 'magnificent', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'down', 'TV', 'interview', 'explain', 'atonement', 'was', 'masterful', 'reinterpretation', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'interior', 'monologue', 'novel', 'ways', 'visualizing', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'lovers', 'versus', 'better', 'ending', 'Brioni', 'gave', 'novel', 'made', 'multi-layered', 'tragedy', 'even', 'more', 'devastating.I', 'know', 'kind', 'film', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'exhilarating', 'when', 'filmmaker', 'boundaries', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'bit', 'distressing', 'reading', 'comments', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'resented', 'repetition', 'scenes', 'different', 'perspectives', 'was', 'point', 'see', 'things', 'differently', 'based', 'many', 'variables', 'sometimes', 'devastating', 'results', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'read', 'who', 'wanted', 'more', 'atonement', 'got', 'suspect', 'Brioni', 'needed', 'do', 'penance', 'medieval', 'nun', 'how', 'one', 'atone', 'innocently', 'ruining', 'loved', 'ones', 'other', 'live', 'guilt', 'right', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'devoting', 'singular', 'talent', 'course', 'adult', 'life', 'give', 'sister', 'happier', 'ending', 'deserved', 'art', 'least', 'not', 'life', 'mindless', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'everyone', 'else', 'also', 'occasionally', 'see', 'movies', 'require', 'be', 'more', 'active', 'participant', 'challenge', 'think', 'different', 'ways', 'touch', 'emotions', 'sometimes', 'unpleasant', 'ways', 'dear', 'sister', 'instance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'might', 'make', 'sad', 'What', 'find', 'troubling', 'criticism', 'Atonement', 'impatient', 'viewers', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'seem', 'resent', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'passive', 'recipients', 'entertainment', 'sad.A', 'DVD/blu-ray', 'edition', 'movie', 'bonus', 'materials', ""'m"", 'always', 'intrigued', 'see', 'scenes', 'were', 'ultimately', 'cut', 'final', 'release', 'rationale', 'doing', 'so', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'were', 'accomplished', 'technically', '360-degree', 'pan', 'Normandy', 'beach', 'reviewer', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'how', 'really', 'happened', 'Arrgh', 'immense', 'sadness', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'years']",N/A
1143375,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B0013K7ZPE,R. Kyle,"[4, 7]","""Atonement"" is a difficult film to review.  Portions of the film are truly outstanding and well worth note, while possibly a  greater number just do not live up to expectations.The tale begins in 1935, with a creative young Briony Tallis writing a play to be performed that evening on the return of her brother, Liam.  The sheltered young girl misinterprets a series of events and through her youth and arrogance gives false testimony against a young man, sending him to prison for 4 years for rape, and later to Dunkirk with the British Army as was commonly done as an early parole.The story focuses primarily on Briony's grief as she realizes that she's given false witness and what the real cost of this testimony brought to her family.The tale is told in a mix of flashbacks, flash forwards and a scene which literally moves backwards.  While the time shifts are interesting artistically, the sussurus of whispers from the audience of the show I attended indicated I wasn't the only one asking my seatmate, ""Where the heck are we?""Much of the filming was stunning, but the music was far too heavy-handed and didn't at times enhance the scenes it played a role in.""Atonement"" got bogged down in WWII in the telling of the tale.  While many of the battle scenes were very well done--were all of them necessary?  Much of that material made the film seem more like a war story than a character exposition.Briony Tallis failed to capture my sympathy or interest at 13, (Saoirse Ronan), 18 (Romola Garai), or 60-ish (Vanessa Redgrave).Cecelia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy) were the standout performance through the whole show.  Every action seemed to speak their passion for each other. Their sex scene in the library was not the most showy, but the subtlety of the actors' words, movements all bespoke a far deeper passion than they even showed.  And they never gave up hope--even while Robbie was at Dunkirk in one of the bloodiest battles in history and Cecelia was in blitz torn London, it seemed they still believed every day they would return to each other.The film was not quite worth matinee fare or coming out to get wet on a cold, rainy day.

1143376,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0013K7ZPE,RMurray847,"[46, 57]","I have never read ATONEMENT (although I own the book, it has somehow never made it to my nightstand), so I brought no preconceived expectations, except that the story was emotionally shattering and the ending is supposed to be a mindblower.Based on the movie, neither expectation was even close to being met. This is the story of the Tallis family, whom we meet in 1935, at their country estate in England.  Oldest daughter Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is secretly but chastely in love with young Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the housekeeper, who apparently received a scholarship to a good school as a young man, and actually is anticipating going to medical school.  These two have obviously known each other for years, and the heat between them is just starting to really get cranked up.  This is unfortunate, because on this particular day, Cecilia's 13 year-old sister Briony seems to be making a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She is an aspiring writer, and clearly thinks very highly of herself.  While both sisters clearly are children of privilege and have a somewhat haughty attitude, young Briony is also a smart child whose self-esteem has probably been inflated to an inappropriate level.So the heat turns up on the two young lovers, and Briony is there to not only read a note from Robbie to Cecilia, but to catch them in a couple of intimate acts.  She misunderstands what she is reading and seeing, and this leads to disaster for Cecilia, and particularly for Robbie, who is accused of a horrible crime and sent to prison.This covers nearly the first half of the film, and this part of the film is quite compelling.  It's well-written, very well acted and oozes with atmosphere.  We feel everyone simply languishing...bored and open to getting into trouble.  It's dramatic stuff, and when the ""act"" ends with Robbie arrest, we anticipate an escalation of events and emotions that will take this film to the ""shattering"" levels.And here's where the film falls nearly completely apart.  Robbie is allowed into the army after 4 years in prison, and we see him at Dunkirk, the site of the historic evacuation of British troops from the mainland back to England.  This daring and costly evacuation of hundreds of thousands of troops was a turning point in the early days of the war...if the evacuation had failed, Britain would have been routed, and Germany could have invaded the island.  As a viewer, we are told none of this...we had just better know it.  However, we are instead allowed to follow Robbie as he wanders through some fields, sees some horrific sights and generally looks like a guy who has been through hell.  There is a scene on the beach that shows us the immensity of what the troops face.  It is about 5 minutes long and is done in one long take.  Technically, it is truly impressive...dramatically, it serves almost no purpose.  It shows off for no reason.Back in England, we see that Cecilia has become a head nurse and is estranged from her family.  Briony, a nurse-in-training, continues to write and apparently is still eaten up by guilt at what she has caused...because now, of course, she believes that what she saw was mis-interpreted.So we see some scenes of these three characters grappling with the ware.  So is this a war movie?  Why so much emphasis on the war when what we've been led to be interested in is these three characters...who play second fiddle to the war for nearly an hour.  War scenes are certainly inherently interesting, but in ATONEMENT they should be supplementing our understanding of the characters not overwhelming them.  By the time the brief third act starts, and all the surprises are revealed, we have pretty much stopped caring about the characters.  And the surprises really aren't that surprising.  The whole tone of the movie, and the way it has played around with time makes it a bit unsurprising when the truth is revealed.  I won't say I saw it coming...but I also didn't really feel surprised.  My wife felt the same.Another problem is the character Briony.  She is unlikeable throughout the film, at all ages.  We aren't given a reason to sympathize with her, as she goes from arrogance to cowardice to regret.  Big deal...none of those feelings compare to the damage she has wrought.Everyone does a decent acting job, and technically the film is accomplished.  But director Joe Wright doesn't handle the tone of the film well enough for us to accept all the shifts and leaps.  And without knowing the book, I have to say that the script, particularly later in the game, is pedestrian and truly fails its characters.  It's almost like the first half of the movie and the second half were written and directed by different people.I can't say I cared much for the film.  It's been nominated for a lot of awards, so clearly others will react to it with more affection.

To say the acting is superb is a vast understatement and I cannot say enough for the players and their dedication in bringing such full fleshed people to the screen.

1143381,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0013K7ZPE,Robert Moore,"[0, 1]","Warning!  Minor spoilers ahead.I'm going to attempt a relatively spoiler free review.  There are numerous minor and a couple of major twists in the film and I believe potential viewers would be best served by seeing this as ignorant as possible of what transpires.  I have not read Ian McEwan's novel (in fact, I very much regret that I have never read any of his novels, though he has long been on my ""List,"" the ever-expanding titles of books that I intend to read at some point), so I can't say how closely the film does or does not hew to the book.This is not as a whole a great film, but it unquestionably has many extraordinary moments.  It certainly is a very ambitious film and while it doesn't always succeed in its ambitions, it does often enough to make seeing it an unforgettable experience.  The film begins very, very slowly and twenty-five minutes into it I found myself almost completely uninterested in what was happening.  There was also some confusion about precisely who various characters were.  This does gradually get straightened out and after the first half hour the film definitely picks up dramatically in pace.From beginning to end I had trouble with the erratic placement of scenes within the narrative.  We often see scenes acted out twice in a row from different perspectives.  Once we jump back several years with little context provided.  I'm sure this is meant to be very cinematic, but the decision not to be linear in the narrative is sometimes confusing, and I'm not sure that there is a huge pay off.  This, however, along with the slowness at the beginning of the film, are about the only negatives I have with the film.The positives for the film are numerous and significant.  This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.  From beginning to end every scene looks perfect.  Occasionally the beauty seems an end unto itself.  Take the astonishing long scene shot on what is supposed to be the Dunkirk beach.  This is a very long shot apparently done in a single shot that is absolutely epic in scope.  I'm pretty certain that it was not, in fact, done in a single take.  There were probably a couple of wipes that allowed them to splice different takes.  My reason for saying this is that the scene was just too complex and gargantuan for anyone to have accomplished it in a single take.  The very long take that begins Orson Welles's A TOUCH OF EVIL was under far more controlled and simple circumstances.  The final minutes of Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was complex, but it also featured a couple of cuts.  There is a very long single-shot scene in Joss Whedon's SERENITY, but that scene is simplicity itself compared to the Dunkirk shot.  But here is my question:  does the Dunkirk scene, as glorious as it was, really achieve anything narratively?  It is just this gorgeous piece of bric-a-brac stuck in the middle of the film.  Mind you, I'm delighted that they put it in there.  It was a fascinating scene to watch.  But I'm not sure that it made ATONEMENT a better movie.  Contrast this with the very long single-shot scene from the end of CHILDREN OF MEN or the even longer car chase scene earlier in the same film, both of which made the movie much better and contributed to the overall tone of the film.The acting is marvelous and it could signal Keira Knightley moving to more adult roles and the beginning of a star career for James McAvoy.  I also loved many among the supporting cast.  All three of the actors playing Briony at various ages -- Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave -- were amazing.  But of the three, Ronan was perhaps the most astonishing.  I was not aware until afterward that she had received an Oscar nomination for her role as the 13-year-old Briony, but it was richly deserved.  I also learned that she is going to be starring in the Peter Jackson film THE LOVELY BONES as the young murdered girl who narrates the story (no spoiler there -- you learn it at the outset), which has tremendously increased my interest in the film.  And everyone in all the other supporting roles was equally as excellent.  My only regret was that Brenda Blethyn, who has to go on any short list of the world's greatest actors, had such a small role.All in all, while the film began very slowly and I think had some questionable issues surrounding narrative structure was all in all a remarkably good film.

1143384,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013K7ZPE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","""Atonement"" turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book.  But before I explain what I mean by that, a little background on the story may be in order.Ian McEwan's novel - which spans eight decades, from the 1930's to the present day - centers around Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in England.  Briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe, a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for.  One unusually hot summer day in 1935, Briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister, Cecilia, and the caretaker's son, Robbie, that her child's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved.  Her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time, through World War II and beyond.  As time passes and Briony grows to adulthood, she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done.  The coup de grace is that, due to circumstances beyond her control, Briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer.At the risk of offending devotees of the novel, I must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites.  For despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality, the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying.  As a writer, McEwan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description, but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story.  His plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy, and his dialogue, when indeed he deigns to use any, is almost always stilted and unconvincing (I have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when I was reading the crucial letter-swapping scene).Yet, something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen (suffice it to say, I didn't roll my eyes this time around).  Since film is a largely visual medium, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright are able to convey through images what it takes McEwan endless reams of paper to get across.  Here, an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders, a meaningful turn of the head, a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand.  And, indeed, the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling, a time, a place, sometimes even an entire theme, all on their own.  Even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece, that structure comes across as less fragmented, less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel.  Thanks to the seamless fluidity of Seamus McGarvey's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of Dario Marianelli's brilliant musical score, everything in the film version of ""Atonement"" feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece.Of the performers, only Keira Knightley is in any way problematic.  She looks positively gorgeous as the seductive Cecilia, and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character.  But she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped poutiness (a problem, too, in ""Pride and Prejudice"") eventually becomes annoying and distracting.  As Robbie, James McAvoy proves again why he is one of his generation's most exciting screen talents, while young Saoirse Ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old Briony.  Ramola Garai and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave do nicely as Briony in later stages of her life (although the ending, while moving, is a bit more reminiscent of ""Titanic"" than it needs to be).Wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical ""stunts"" into integral pieces of the drama: a beautifully realized, five-and-a-half-minute long tracking shot of the carnage at Dunkirk, the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score, a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking.  Through sight and sound, Wright creates a surrealistic, dreamlike tone, perfectly appropriate to the material at hand.  What's amazing is that, even with all these stylistic flourishes, Wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story's core.  In his direction, he displays an astonishing economy of means, moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed.  Not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece; it greatly enhances it.""Atonement"" ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted, as Briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity.  Watching ""Atonement"" is nothing short of a rapturous experience.",5,a rave review from someone who DIDN'T like the novel,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,5117,"['Atonement', 'out', 'be', 'much',

Or, in other words, what it is really like to be in the mind of a writer. Throughout ATONEMENT Briony exemplifies the role of a writer: she enjoys feeling like God (or believing that she is better than other people) and being in control of her characters--both in her fictional and ""real"" world. For example, she believes she is better than other people by talking down to them (her cousin, Lola, and the twins), not respecting other people's privacy (she reads Robbie's letter that is meant for Cecilia), and lying about a crime that has grave consequences for other people (Robbie, Cecilia and herself).  She enjoys being in control by tricking Robbie into saving her when she really wasn't drowning, and preventing Robbie and Cecilia being together since she can't have Robbie for herself. She even changes the ending of the Robbie and Cecilia story to suit her needs of a novelist. In some ways, ATONEMENT is very much like a Woody Allen movie--especially THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, and MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY. There's a scene in ATONEMENT where Robbie is in an abandoned movie theater in Dunkirk. By having him stand in front of a movie screen, it is suggested that art imitates life and life imitates art and who can tell the difference between the two. This scene is very similar to a scene in MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, which makes sense because Briony has difficulty separating her fictional world from her ""real"" world. She seems to think she can control the lives of the people around her as she does with the characters in her stories. I realize that the marketing department is trying to present ATONEMENT as a love story between Robbie and Cecilia. But I actually think the main character is Briony--both in the movie and book. ATONEMENT is one of the best movie adaptations--much better than THE ENGLISH PATIENT because it focuses on the main concept of the story and not on some sappy love story. It is also one of the best movies of the year. Of the five films nominated for Best Picture, the Academy Award should have gone to ATONEMENT.

1143387,A387BD735MI50R,B0013K7ZPE,R. Schultz,"[4, 5]","A lot of recent movies have tried to create suspense by telling their stories in bits and pieces. Flashbacks and flash-forwards abound. With ""Atonement,"" we get a number of these time displacements, plus we have the added fragmentation of a story sometimes told from different viewpoints, in brief imitation of ""Roshomon.""The Director apparently hoped to hold our interest by making archeologists of us all, uncovering one shard after another, engaging us, challenging us to put the pieces together into the final unified piece of pottery. Half-way through though, I felt as if there might just be too many missing pieces here to warrant my continued efforts.Another problem with the movie is that it set up false expectations. Its backdrops don't quite match its theme. The central tragedy of the film is launched in the 1930's in a large English estate taken right out of the pages of a classic Agatha Christie who-dun-it. There are long corridors and balconies, all slightly darkened, all gleaming sinisterly with polished wood. In standard Christie-style, some members of the upper-class gather here for a house party where they mingle with gardeners, butlers, and other factotums of the estate. The standard illicit love affairs, rivalries, and tensions brew among this cast of characters. All this leads the viewer to expect a neatly clipped murder in the library.However, while there is a crime committed, and while there is some question about who did it - the mystery is not at all the sort of puzzled contrivance that we have been set up for. The viewer is all of a sudden shifted into the very much less contained, much less solvable gore of the WWII evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk. From there, we're launched onto a sea of murky moral considerations and motives.The result is a somewhat pretentious collage of mismatched fragments that it gets a chore to relate and relate to. There might have been a good point buried here, about the inscrutability of a lot of human motivation and about how an off-the-cuff deception can lead to hugely tragic consequence.

There are plenty of reviews here that already say what I want to say, so I'll just summarize the three main things that bothered me.First, the movie plods.  And plods.  And plods.  And not only does it plod, but its non-linear time presentation makes it sometimes even more annoying, as we watch the same scene all over again from a different perspective, or learn something about a character only to get a ""Three months earlier"" notice in the next scene.Second, none of the characters were really all that likeable.  Cecelia was okay during the second half of the movie, but not at all sympathetic in the first half.  Briony never was.  Robbie was the only character at all that I felt any sympathy for.Third, the plot was annoyingly predictable.  It was very obvious who molested the girl because they had set it up a few scenes earlier.  It was entirely predictable that he was going to send the wrong letter. . . . and on and on.Finally, the manipulation of the fourth wall was, for lack of a better word, unconvincing.  ""We just showed you a scene when Robbie came back, but he really didn't because I made that up.  He was already dead.""  It just didn't work.I suppose that's four.  Sorry.

Unlike most love stories where the events unfold predictably and there are no major problems along the way, this one is wrought with disasters. Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightly) is a wealthy girl from a well-to-do family. She is the epitome of the well brought up girl; she's beautiful, she dresses well, she is charismatic, and she's smart. It is no small wonder that one of the house staff is enchanted with her. Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) is well educated but comes from a poor background, so he is not the ideal mate, but the mutual flirtation between this couple betrays their hidden desires. Enter Briony (Saoirse Ronan), Cecilia's younger sister with a vivid imagination and a crush on Robbie. She glimpses a few moments in the couple's flirtation with each other and assumes the worst and jeopardizes their happiness together.The story is uneven; it is exciting right from the start, but the excitement seems to wane a bit in the middle. It suffers from confusing moments and some pretentiousness, especially the long take on the beach during the war. It seems director Joe Wright wanted to do something to prove his abilities, but its gratuitousness seems more like showing off than anything and detracts from the quiet beauty of the rest of the film. Events continue to drag on, and right when one starts to lose interest, the story catches you and pulls you in hard. The ending is heartbreakingly memorable and an unusual finish to such a love story.This movie should have won the Oscars for best cinematography and best art direction. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at from the color choices to the framing of each scene. Looking back, there are so many vivid images to remember, such as Briony walking through the floral arches in the garden, the seductively rich colors in the study, the grey streets during the war... What is amazing about these choices is that in spite of each frame looking like a painting, the sets seem very real and lived in.

So, after watching the film of the same name, I looked up the word in the dictionary. Pertaining to the film, the word atonement means a reconciliation or a reparation for an offense. Yes, the film ceratinly was.Having not read the novel, I can't say that it followed closely to it or if it completely got derailed. However, watching the film was in fact like reading a novel. A few scenes are repeated to give other points of view and some scenes are even made up or even redone completely, depending on who's telling about them. It may get a little confusing to some. Had I not known the general synopsis of the film, I probably would have been. It's not rocket science mind you, but it does kind of throw the viewer off.The film is about two young and gorgeous people who are torn apart by a lie and who, for the next four years, see each other in and out of a terrible war. It seems prettly simple but there's a little more to it that that. I was expecting a sweeping love story. It's not. You hardly feel anything for the tragic couple simply because there's no real solid background of them having been together. You just know that there's something between them from the begining. So in that sense, I found it hard to believe that these two were each other's soul mates or what have you.Still, the film is extrodinarily beautiful. I patricularly liked the music very much. The concepts and ideas that it offered were intriguing if not fully realized. I liked the idea of a child having trouble not understaning adults; their actions, thoughts, and motives. It's a child, after all, that is the cause of such heartache for the two leads. But for me, the film just wasn't tecnically constructed right. It had great potential to be a sweeping love story. Insead it opt for being a miss mass of scenes (begining after Mcavoy is taken away by the police). It would jump around a lot and when it was done, it decided to back and change what I thought was an OK ending to a frustrating and unsatisfying ending. And the interesting thing about how it did end was that you realized the title's relevance. It does fit what really happened. Still, it doesn't make it satisfying. I was a little angered to tell you the truth. Yes, it's all gloriously tragic but I felt a little cheated.'Atonement' isn't a terrible film at all. It's just a little dissapointing and I'm not speaking of it's ""downer"" ending. I love depressing films but the way 'Atonement' was presented was like changing the past and I just wasn't for that.

I was pleasantly surprised as I watched this movie at how faithful the screenwriter was to the source, the only qualm I had was the ending, in the book you get a real insight into the thoughts of the elderly Briony and it is extremely revealing, she goes back to the estate, where they are throwing her a party and you lean the fate of all the characters, the way it's layed out is prefect and it is one of the best payoffs of any book I have read, in movie, however, this is given short shrift, we get six minutes of an out of it Redgrave, and its such a huge letdown to anybody who has had the pleasure of reading this fantastic book.  Having said that, however, I must say, overall, I loved this movie, the first act was perfect and the young girl playing Briony was perfect.  Knightley and McAvoy have great chemistry and they convey a yearning that you know would have lasted the test of time.  The second act is well done as well, though I was not as crazy about the actor playing the late teen Briony, she looks just like the younger Briony, but she cant sustain, the younger actors command of the character.  The third act as I mentioned earlier was a real letdown, but if you have never read the book, then you will most likly have little problem with the last act, but for those of us who had it was the difference between this being a five star film or a four star film.

Wozniak,"[0, 0]","I was so back and forth about wanting to watch this movie,because of so many negative and actually misquoted movie scenes in this movie.****Spoilers, but I read the spoilers too and decided to watch anyway so up to you!****The movie starts out with a very intelligent young woman who dabbles with writing and has a secret crush on Robbie (James McAvoy). After wanting telling Robbie she wants him to watch the play she has written, for her visiting brother and a few altercations, between her and her cousins(over starring in a play). The girl Briey is in a bad mood already,then sees her sister and Robbie having what looks like a slight tiff, between the two. The relationship between Robbie and her sister Cecelia is the classic poor boy loves a rich girl story. Their brother comes to visit and brings a friend of his who is an older man.Robbie decides to write Cecelia a letter which is what starts the wheel of the misunderstanding. Robbie writes an extremely crude letter and quickly realizes he can not send this letter, then rewrites another one. Apologizing over his actions towards Cecelia causing her to break a vase. While trying to get ready for a dinner party, Robbie becomes distracted and places the wrong letter in the envelope. He makes the blunder of handing it to her the younger sister briey who decides to read it and is shocked. Confused she confronts her cousin that is around her own age, Lola who gives her idea that Robbie is a sex crazed man. The young cousin is flushed,when talking to Briey and seems to have had some sort of fight. She brushes it off claiming it was her younger brothers. Then as Briey is walking down to dinner she walks in on Cecelia and Robbie in the fits of passion. Both embarrassed fix themselves and walk into dinner, while secretly caressing one another's hand. During dinner Briey is extremely rude and short with Robbie. It is discovered that the twin brother's are missing and decided to run away.The whole dinner party is out searching for these young boys, when yet again Briey has walked upon sexual encounter,but it is not with her sister,but her cousin Lola. With what seemed to be a man dressed the same as Robbie and dashing off as she drew closer. With no view of the face, Briey rushes to her cousin and asked what has happened. Then Briey makes them comment ""Was it robbie?""The cousin deemly shakes her head yes and says the violator covered her eyes and she didn't know who it was. Briey thinks that Robbie had attacked her sister as well since she walked in on their steamy love making in the library. She accuses him of being the one of the attack, then Robbie is carted off to jail and given a choice to rot or join the army.We fast forward to a few years later where Robbie is trying to make his way back to Cecelia. The story pretty much follows that of a love story, the 2 have gotten back together. But he is called off to duty and the eventually get married.Then the story changes to Briey 5 years later and feeling guilty. Putting off her education she goes into a hospital for soldiers and tries to help out as much as she can. There is a scene that shows her confronting Cecelia who has for the most part cut herself off away from her family. Cecelia is married to Robbie in a small apartment and Robbie sees Briey and is on the verge of killing her, but calms down. He pretty much tells briey that he wants a letter from her stating why she accused him of being the one who raped her cousin. It is told that she realized her mistake, because she remembered that the man who had run away from her cousin was her brother's friend, who was walking Lola down the isle. Briey has agreed and starts to leave, then we fast forward to I would say about 40 years later.We see a much older Briey and she is on a talk show promoting her last book, as she finds out she is dying. The story is true in the beginning, but after Robbie's arrest. Briey never knows if her sister and Robbie ever met again. Her sister cut herself off from the family and died on oct 15th, 1940 and Robbie Had died June 1st 1940. That the reason this was Briey's last book, is the reason she had never had the courage to confront Robbie and her sister, after the mistake she had made. That her writing the book in that fashion was to try, to giver her sister and Robbie the life they had deserved....The few issues I had with some reviews that I have read a lot were about the war, but Briey states everything for the most part is fictional at the end. People flipped that Briey makes a statement saying she had a crush on Robbie around 10 or 11,but the misunderstanding happened at age 13. She very well could have started the crush during that time and continued it. People flipped that he should have never handed off the letter to the child, well it's very obvious in the movie that he didn't mean to hand that to the girl and never intended for anyone to see it! He apologized to Cecelia for ever getting the letter and made the statement he had a different letter. A lot of reviews flipped saying Briey was a hateful child who purposely destroyed her sister's and Robbie's lives. Watch the movie it is kind of obvious it was a misunderstanding and this woman had been carrying this burden around for her entire life. She has finally decided that before she died to tell the truth, where the story could have just died off with her. Which is why she is atoning for her actions. She is the cause of 2 people not having the lives they deserve to have. It's a very sad ending, but to me actually realistic. Not everything ends on a happy note with love. I can understand having this secret that eats away at you.I really enjoyed the movie and the act a little of the dramatic side, but still all around a good movie!",5,I am so glad that I did not listen

1143399,A13STKDYQO5DQ8,B0013K7ZPE,"S. Hebbron ""S B H.""","[4, 4]","What is so very interesting about this film is the sense by which you cannot uniformly condemn the central character, Briony, for her vengeful actions as a child. It would be too easy to dismiss her as hateful and motivated by envy, but is this a fair assessment of a child's view? Are we being asked to question the nature of her style of upbringing, being sweet, nice, productive, even tempered, ordered and denying base human emotion to the point of barely having the capaicty to register such feeling and thus allow it to journey, untamed, unacknowledged in our actions?Did she believe what she saw? Was she manipulated by those who were perhaps not as innocent as they claimed to be for fear of lost power and respect?The damage done is far reaching, compellingly tragic and infuriatingly inequitable. The conclusion almost viewed by the central figure as having finally reached a virtual pay back, her life for those she ruined seemingly, so unwittingly.This a complex study of intense, raw human emotion and both the key and peripheral performances are beautifully executed. Immensley tragic and stunningly beautiful in terms of cinematography and musical score.The capturing of the dynamic and historic essence of the time is perfection and one is filled with the kind of questions about the human condition that are so incredibly difficult to answer affirmatively and rely upon.This along with the sense that Brionay is not so much an intensely spiteful child as a child whoes unmanaged longings express themselves with a sense of prolonged tragedy any child might easily fall victim too.",5,A moment of envy lives on with tragic consequences...,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,1597,"['What', 'so', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'sense', 'can', 'not', 'uniformly', 'condemn', 'central', 'character', 'Briony', 'vengeful', 'actions', 'child', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'hateful', 'motivated', 'envy', 'fair', 'assessment', 'child', 'view', 'Are', 'being', 'asked', 'question', 'nature', 'style', 'upbringing', 'being', 'sweet', 'nice', 'productive', 'even', 'tempered', 'ordered', 'denying', 'base', 'human', 'emotion', 'point', 'barely', 'having', 'capaicty', 'register', 'such', 'feeling', 'thus', 'allow', 'journey', 'untamed', 'unacknowledged', 'actions', 'Did', 'believe', 'what', 'saw', 'Was', 'manipulated', 'who', 'were', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'innocent', 'claimed', 'be', 'fear', 'lost', 'power', 'respect', 'damage', 'done', 'far', 'reaching', 'compellingly', 'tragic', 'infuriatingly', 'inequitable', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'viewed', 'central', 'figure', 'having', 'finally', 'reached', 'virtual', 'pay', 'back', 'life', 'ruined', 'seemingly', 'unwittingly.This', 'complex', 'study', 'intense', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion', 'key', 'peripheral', 'performances', 'are', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'Immensley', 'tragic', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'score.The', 'capturing', 'dynamic', 'historic', 'essence', 'time', 'perfection', 'one', 'filled', 'kind', 'questions', 'human', 'condition', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'answer', 'affirmatively', 'rely', 'upon.This', 'sense', 'Brionay', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'intensely', 'spiteful', 'child', 'child', 'whoes', 'unmanaged', 'longings', 'express', 'sense', 'prolonged', 'tragedy', 'child', 'might', 'easily', 'fall', 'victim', 'too']",N/A

1143402,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0013K7ZPE,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[9, 12]","Although I gave this film four stars overall, it is problematic.  Having said that, this movie is stunningly filmed and very well acted.The film has a wide appeal in that it's a period piece, a romance story, a war epic, and it's strongly centered around a theme we can all relate to, atoning for one's sin(s).  In addition, the acting in this film is first-rate.  Keira Knightly is both stunningly beautiful for such a fragile looking thing and shows that she can really act beyond her ""Pirates"" role to which this character is very far removed.  Also, James McAvoy is terrific and gives another star making performance (as he had done inThe Last King of Scotland).  All of the supporting cast members are equally excellent in this film.  Of course, one of the film's greatest assets is its cinematography.  This film is sumptuously filmed and the one take beach shot of the retreating British army is unforgettable.However, the telling of the story is the film's greatest problem in that there are shifts in point of view and time periods with little or no lead in or explanation.  Yes, I know they are intentional, but that doesn't mean they were done well.  Even when one is paying attention to the film, the shifts are often abrupt and very distracting until one figures out what is going on.  These shifts make the film seem disjointed and poorly edited.  I'm not sure who is to blame for this approach as it could be the director, the writers, the editor or some combination of all three, which is where I think the blame does lie.  Now, in spite of this very strong criticism, this is still an excellent film.The plot is outlined by Amazon very well, but their praise is, in my view, rather excessive.  In any event, you can read their summary which is informative and accurate.  In short form, it's the story that spans about four years in which a very young girl has a crush on the son of a house servant who himself has a crush on the oldest daughter in the home.  That quiet crush ends up being mutual and erupts into a secret love affair that is, unfortunately, discovered by the very jealous younger sister who feel betrayed by the boy and she sets out to destroy him.  It's the classic, ""If I can't have you, no one can"" scenario.  The young girl tells a huge lie that sends the boy to jail and then to war.  She attempts ""atonement"" not by ever saying she's sorry or by recanting her vicious accusation, but rather by becoming a nurse and caring for wounded soldiers.  The audience is left to decide if she achieves atonement or not by her actions.For myself, I am rather old fashioned about forgiveness in that I think little can substitute for a sincere and straight-forward apology to the persons affected.  How can one expect forgiveness if he or she never actually asks for it or even owns up to what he or she actually did?  In addition, the person asking forgiveness needs to understand that a simple ""I'm sorry"" doesn't ""fix"" the problems created and some times an apology isn't enough and needs to be coupled with appropriate reparations.Of course, the victim can certainly find it in his or her heart to forgive someone for a bad action even without the other asking for forgiveness, but that doesn't diminish the need/requirement of one to own up to what he or she did and simply trying to lead a better life afterwards, as done in this film, doesn't pay the bill entirely even though it is a praiseworthy thing to do.  An apology ought to also be coupled by a change in behavior and in this story the young girl does this, but I am very disturbed by her reluctance to ever tell anyone what she did or, at the very least, ask forgiveness directly from the people she hurt so much.Of course, the acceptance of an apology is often a tricky thing too and we have no clue how the main characters in this film would accept an apology if it was offered.  For starters, one has to examine if the apology is sincere or not.  Personally, I think people should be a graceful as possible in accepting apologies as it takes a lot of humility to offer an apology that includes noting the wrong that was done.  All too often in our society today we have this need to win at all costs and even when someone gives us a heartfelt apology, we sometimes feel the need to stomp all over the person anyhow.  Perhaps it is part of that eye for eye, tooth for a tooth mentality.  One accepts the apology, but must get some revenge anyhow to ""equal"" out things.  To me that's not accepting an apology as forgiveness means releasing a person from the burden of guilt he or she has with no strings attached. I can't help but think the characters in this story would have gone down this path had an apology been offered.  Well, one can only hope.Respectfully Submitted 06/08,Steve Hedge",4,"The problems with ""Atonement"" are forgivable.",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,4786,"['gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'overall', 'problematic', 'Having', 'said', 'movie', 'stunningly', 'filmed', 'very', 'well', 'acted.The', 'film', 'wide', 'appeal', 'period', 'piece', 'romance', 'story', 'war', 'epic', 'strongly', 'centered', 'theme', 'can', 'relate', 'atoning', 'one', 'sin', 's', 'addition', 'acting', 'film', 'first-rate', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'such', 'fragile', 'looking', 'thing', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'Pirates', 'role', 'character', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'Also', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'terrific', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'had', 'done', 'inThe', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'equally', 'excellent', 'film', 'course', 'one', 'film', 'greatest', 'assets', 'cinematography', 'film', 'sumptuously', 'filmed', 'one', 'take', 'beach', 'shot', 'retreating', 'British', 'army', 'unforgettable.However', 'telling', 'story', 'film', 'greatest', 'problem', 'are', 'shifts', 'point', 'view', 'time', 'periods', 'little', 'lead', 'explanation', 'Yes', 'know', 'are', 'intentional', ""n't"", 'mean', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'Even', 'when', 'one', 'paying', 'attention', 'film', 'shifts', 'are', 'often', 'abrupt', 'very', 'distracting', 'one', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'shifts', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'disjointed', 'poorly', 'edited', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'blame', 'approach', 'could', 'be', 'director', 'writers', 'editor', 'combination', 'three', 'where', 'think', 'blame', 'lie', 'Now', 'spite', 'very', 'strong', 'criticism', 'still', 'excellent', 'film.The', 'plot', 'outlined', 'Amazon', 'very', 'well', 'praise', 'view', 'rather', 'excessive', 'event', 'can', 'read', 'summary', 'informative', 'accurate', 'short', 'form', 'story', 'four', 'years', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'crush', 'son', 'house', 'servant', 'who', 'crush', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'home', 'quiet', 'crush', 'up', 'being', 'mutual', 'secret', 'love', 'affair', 'unfortunately', 'discovered', 'very', 'jealous', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'boy', 'out', 'destroy', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'can', 'scenario', 'young', 'girl', 'huge', 'lie', 'boy', 'jail', 'then', 'war', 'atonement', 'not', 'ever', 'saying', 'sorry', 'recanting', 'vicious', 'accusation', 'rather', 'becoming', 'nurse', 'caring', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'audience', 'left', 'decide', 'atonement', 'not', 'actions.For', 'am', 'rather', 'old', 'fashioned', 'forgiveness', 'think', 'little', 'can', 'substitute', 'sincere', 'straight-forward', 'apology', 'persons', 'affected', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'expect', 'forgiveness', 'never', 'actually', 'even', 'up', 'what', 'actually', 'did', 'addition', 'person', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'needs', 'understand', 'simple', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""n't"", 'fix', 'problems', 'created', 'times', 'apology', ""n't"", 'enough', 'be', 'coupled', 'appropriate', 'reparations.Of', 'course', 'victim', 'can', 'certainly', 'find', 'heart', 'forgive', 'someone', 'bad', 'action', 'even', 'other', 'asking', 'forgiveness', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'need/requirement', 'one', 'own', 'up', 'what', 'did', 'simply', 'trying', 'lead', 'better', 'life', 'afterwards', 'done', 'film', ""n't"", 'pay', 'bill', 'entirely', 'even', 'praiseworthy', 'thing', 'do', 'apology', 'ought', 'also', 'be', 'coupled', 'change', 'behavior', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'am', 'very', 'disturbed', 'reluctance', 'ever', 'tell', 'anyone', 'what', 'did', 'very', 'least', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'directly', 'people', 'hurt', 'so', 'much.Of', 'course', 'acceptance', 'apology', 'often', 'tricky', 'thing', 'too', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'accept', 'apology', 'was', 'offered', 'starters', 'one', 'examine', 'apology', 'sincere', 'not', 'Personally', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'graceful', 'possible', 'accepting', 'apologies', 'lot', 'humility', 'offer', 'apology', 'noting', 'wrong', 'was', 'done', 'too', 'often', 'society', 'today', 'have', 'need', 'win', 'costs', 'even', 'when', 'someone', 'heartfelt', 'apology', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'need', 'stomp', 'person', 'anyhow', 'Perhaps', 'part', 'eye', 'eye', 'tooth', 'mentality', 'One', 'apology', 'must', 'get', 'revenge', 'anyhow', 'equal', 'out', 'things', 'not', 'accepting', 'apology', 'forgiveness', 'releasing', 'person', 'burden', 'guilt', 'strings', 'attached', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'characters', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'path', 'had', 'apology', 'been', 'offered', 'Well', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope.Respectfully', 'Submitted', '06/08', 'Steve', 'Hedge']",N/A

Director Joe Wright proves here that Pride and Prejudice was no fluke as Atonement is well crafted, superbly photographed and with an intelligent script makes this film a total success and triumph. Beginning in the summer of 1935 in an English Manor we are introduced to Briony, a precocious and over imaginative young writer. The film starts as she tries to understand the relationship between her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) and the housekeeper's son Robby (McEvoy). After a horrendous attack on their cousin, Briony's innocence, naivety and jealously leads her to put the blame on Robby who is immediately taken away to jail.  Cut to 1940 and Robby, who got the chance to join the army, is now an evacuee in Dunkirk. Cecilia is a nurse in London as is Briony. What follows is Briony trying to come to terms with what she has done and trying to make peace with her sister. From the lush Countryside to the bleakness of the beaches of Dunkirk the photography is spellbinding. The direction is first rate with a stunning tracking shot of Dunkirk. Also the music and the use of the sound from the keys of the typewriter are used to perfect effect. The performances are first rate, notably Saoirse Ronan who plays the young Briony.  While the film does lull a bit during the middle, the performances carry the viewer through it.  A hugely enjoyable period/war drama, that's as ambitious as it is compassionate.

With piercing typewriter sounds blended into a strikingly catchy score and superlative acting all around, this is a sweeping, epic love story that is sure to receive Oscar attention in the coming months. Tragedies as rich and fulfilling as this are seldom indeed.Young Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) feels matured beyond her age of 13, and thinks only of adult tasks such as writing and conducting her play, The Trials of Arabella. When she sees her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightley) being approached by Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son, whom she has a childish crush on, she becomes jealous. That evening, visitor Lola Quincy is attacked and raped by a friend of the family during a search for her runaway brothers, and Briony names Robbie as the culprit. Wrongfully accused, but with no witnesses to clear him, he is sentenced to prison. Given the option to serve in the army rather than to rot in prison, he is quickly swept up into the atrocities of World War II. Meanwhile, Cecelia waits for him faithfully, serving as a nurse, and as Briony grows up she realizes the anguish she's put the two lovers through, and desperately seeks a way to right her wrongs.The most discommodious aspect of Atonement is the manner in which time is lapsed and then backtracked, and mixed up in every method possible. At points the film jumps forward by several years, slides back a few months, repeats events from different character's perspectives, and meets back up with itself at others. There's even a segment that plays in reverse and in slow motion. It is an artistic concept, but seems to serve little purpose in a film that focuses so heavily on character development and an unconventional love story.The love story is unique in the sense that the intervention by Briony causes a need for narration from only one viewpoint, despite scenes being shown from many character's perspectives. She struggles with the guilt of realizing how her meddling with their lives may prevent her from ever being able to achieve true atonement. The film follows her as she grows up and becomes a well-known author, and is finally able to write an autobiographical account of her life that includes her horrendous mistakes and how they affected Cecelia and Robbie. With the beauty of her brand of fiction comes embellishment and adjectives that mask the truth, for which she has abandoned in a final attempt to give the two lovers happiness. For her, truth no longer serves a purpose and in an effort to amend her estrangement from both family and ultimately love (what she refers to as an act of kindness), she writes her story the way she believes it ought to be told.Technically, while there are a few noticeable prop inaccuracies, the cinematography is gorgeous and the music is unforgettable. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey employs long tracking shots and seamlessly edited sequences in which the camera follows characters as they witness the aftermaths of various battlefields. The dead bodies of a young girl's school are laid out like railroad tracks, enemy horses are summarily executed like, ironically, humans, and a beachfront war zone showcases the dead and dying troops as they attempt to regroup. Through each scene, the score beautifully accompanies the wondrous imagery, and the most noticeable of all is the penetrating typewriter strokes that permeate the rhythms of the piano-heavy theme music.""Come back to me,"" Cecelia pleads with Robbie, who has undergone mental stresses that prevent him from fulfilling his dreams of marriage and living in a picturesque white beachside cottage.

This year, that film is ""Atonement"". A number of people have hemmed and hawed when I asked if they have already seen the film. ""I heard it was like ""The English Patient"""".  I loved ""The English Patient"" but opinion seems to be equally divided. But ""Atonement"" is very different. I think any film made in Britain, set during World War II is going to be identified with ""The English Patient"". That's a shame, because the two films are not very similar and many people intensely dislike the former Oscar winner, so much so that just the mention of it is enough to steer many away from a film that could be remotely like it.""Atonement"", based on the book by Ian McEwan, reteams Keira Knightley with her ""Pride and Prejudice"" director Joe Wright. They have created a masterfully crafted look at a romance interrupted by events beyond the couple's control.In the mid 30s, a hot summer leads everyone at a country house in the English countryside to become antsy. Briony (Saoirse Ronan), a precocious 13 year old, decides to write another play; she will perform it for the assembled houseguests with the help of her cousins and everyone is sure to love it and think she is just brilliant. Her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley) finds it difficult to deal with her growing attraction to Robbie (James McAvoy), the caretaker's son. They flirt and challenge each other to show their true affections. But Briony also has a schoolgirl crush on Robbie, and naturally, she doesn't understand all of these feelings or what she sees her older sister experiencing. Invited to dinner, Robbie writes Cecilia a letter and asks Briony to deliver it. He soon realizes he gave her a more explicit letter and yells for her to return. He tries to talk to Cecilia about it, but they give in to their carnal needs. Briony walks in and mistakes what they are doing. One thing leads to another and Robbie ends up in jail (there is a lot of stuff going on, I've only scratched the surface). When World War II begins, he is given the opportunity to join the army to get out of jail, and he is off to the battlefields of France. There, he pines over the letters he receives from Cecilia, who has disowned her family, and her sister, and works as a nurse. Briony (Romola Garai), now a young lady, has also become a nurse and desperately wants to right what she now realizes was a mistake.Directed by Joe Wright, ""Atonement"" is a great piece of romantic filmmaking.We initially meet Cecilia and Robbie, as they deal with the restrictions of their respective class standing in the way of their romance. Everyone has to be very proper, so they are unable to express their emotions. Then, frustrated by the constant flirting, Robbie writes a letter to Cecilia. But he is unable to come up with the right wording, the proper wording. Because of his inability to express his feelings, he writes an explicit letter, laughs and then writes another letter, a proper letter, but he mistakenly gives the wrong letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia. Briony is also attracted to the young man, so she sneaks a look at the letter and is shocked. All of this works so well because Wright and his screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, have perfectly captured McEwen's portrait of these rich folks who are languishing in the summer heat, bored and randy, letting their feelings overtake their better morals and better judgment.Briony is a precocious kid and we first meet her after she has finished a new play. Naturally, she has her mother and Cecilia read it, both of whom give their blessings. Then she ropes her cousins, twin boys and their older sister, into agreeing to perform it. But when the older cousin, who is a few years older than Briony, starts to try to take over, Briony gets frustrated. This is her play and she must be in control. Later, Briony's lack of control also helps to explain her actions as they spiral out of control, becoming more severe and damaging.Throughout the first half of the film, Robbie and Cecilia are clearly attracted to each other. Yet, because Robbie is the son of the family's caretaker, they are unable to express their desire. When Cecilia makes a mean comment about Robbie owing her father a lot of money for his schooling, we realize this is the same behavior two school children exhibit when they are interested in one another and unable to show it.Keira Knightley does a very good job of portraying Cecilia's frustrations. At one point, she lays on dock next to the lake, in a swimming suit. You can almost see the heat rising off of her body. So, when she and Robbie flirt, and they have a little tussle, she dives into the fountain to retrieve a broken piece of pottery, only to emerge in a drenched dress. Of course, this does nothing to assuage Robbie's desire and you have to think Cecilia is probably glad of the result. As Robbie and Cecilia dance around their feelings, Knightley brings a lot of complexity to the role. She argues with Robbie, she longs for him, she wants to hold him, but she can't. All of this is perfectly portrayed by the actress.When she receives the wrong letter from Robbie, she knows Briony has read it, but doesn't care. When he shows up for dinner, in evening dress, she leads him into the dark library ready to show him her true emotions. But Briony walks in and interrupts. She is shocked by what she sees.James McAvoy plays Robbie, the caretaker's (Brenda Blethyn) son. He knows there is a barrier between he and Cecilia and this only serves to make him all the more frustrated. When she suddenly appears out of the fountain, he is shocked, but seems more shocked because he would love to grab her and ravage her. But he can't do that. This all leads to the letter.  Like Cecilia, he is very frustrated and the heat isn't helping.The pair are extremely convincing and work well together. You can see the longing in their eyes as they yearn to touch each other.When the war hits, we watch as Robbie deals with life in the war-torn French countryside. He covets the letters Cecilia has sent to him and counts the days until he can return to England on leave and see her. Like many woman, Cecilia has become a nurse and tries to help out where she can. More interestingly, she has also disowned her family and lives in a small apartment in the middle of London. When they do reunite, it is an awkward moment, because he has been scarred by war and can't open up to her immediately. But she places her hands on his and all is well again.Briony, now a young woman, has been thinking about the events of that summer evening many years before. She realizes she mistook or misunderstood some things, and wants to make amends. She also realizes she has interrupted her older sister's romance and wants to set things right, but Cecilia will have nothing to do with her.One of the most striking things about ""Atonement"" is, strangely enough, the sound design of the film. As the film opens, we hear a typewriter clacking away and then watch as Briony finishes her play. But this same sound becomes almost a background noise through much of the film. At various points, we watch a character's actions through a certain point and then the typewriter sound becomes louder and the action shifts back a bit, and we watch the same events from a slightly different viewpoint. As Briony is presumably writing this, at some point in her life, it is fascinating to see the different viewpoints presented, almost as Briony seems to realize her mistakes. The typewriter sound blends into the music, adding a nice underscore to the melodic background.The typewriter and Briony's reexamining various events leads up the emotional, gut wrenching climax of the film. I defy you to not use the hanky you will wisely have in your hand, waiting for this very moment.""Atonement"" is a very good film, very romantic, and sure to bring a large number of people to tears. It is superbly made and you never once feel like you are watching something that hasn't happened.

Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola is raped, she tells the police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed when in fact it was a visitor to the estate. The storyline of Atonement is where this movie holds most of its impact. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me almost to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is.

1143413,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B0013K7ZPE,Tristan,"[1, 1]","As Atonement opens with stunning images of the tranquil English countryside where everything is a picture of perfection and everyone appears content; you cannot help but feel the atmospheric foreboding as nothing perfect lasts forever in this tarnished world. Based on the bestselling novel by Ian McEwan, it is an unforgettable, beautifully haunting love story that slowly slips into a devastating flood of such raw, overwhelming tragedy that you can feel the emotional journey of the characters; and its' thought-provoking themes of forgiveness, atoning, betrayal, and love stay with you for days afterwards.When Briony Tallis (played three different ages by by Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave) misinterprets an encounter between Robbie Turner (played by James McAvoy) and her sister Cecillia Tallis (played Keira Knightley), she tells a lie that carries such shocking consequences that it completely ruins their lives. Briony spends the rest of her life seeking forgiveness for her appalling act. The story is told against the backdrop of WWII from the three points of view, along with beautifully rendered and perfectly timed flashbacks and forwards.Director Joe Wright does a splendid job contrasting the two worlds. The beginning is filled with whimsical, pastel colors of the exquisite English Countryside drenched in glowing sunshine where everything has the sense of a timeless perfection; only to be followed by the dark, ominous, gritty images of a war torn France.The acting from the entire cast is top-notch. James McAvoy gives a strong emotion-filled performance of great depth; Keira Knightley effortlessly glides into her role as the high-class daughter, and as only she can do, speaks each line with such eloquence that it is a treat to just listen. Saoirse Ronan is truly one of the best child actresses of late as she acts with such a profound maturity and intensity; and Vanessa Redgrave is so perfect in her small role as Briony in her older years that she still manages to make an impression and is able to convey such emotion solely through her expressions.Every level of production is so perfect, it is an absolute triumph. Notably the cinematography which was dazzling, containing one of the most epic and complex single-take in movie history (yes it even topped Children of Men); as well as Dario Marianelli's magnificent, sweeping score filled with an original theme of simple yet exquisite beauty.Atonement truly is the best film of 2007.",5,The Best Film of 2007!,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2484,"['Atonement', 'stunning', 'images', 'tranquil', 'English', 'countryside', 'where', 'everything', 'picture', 'perfection', 'everyone', 'content', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'atmospheric', 'foreboding', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'forever', 'tarnished', 'world', 'Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'unforgettable', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'love', 'story', 'slowly', 'devastating', 'flood', 'such', 'raw', 'overwhelming', 'tragedy', 'can', 'feel', 'emotional', 'journey', 'characters', 'thought-provoking', 'themes', 'forgiveness', 'atoning', 'betrayal', 'love', 'stay', 'days', 'afterwards.When', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'played', 'three', 'different', 'ages', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'encounter', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'played', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'sister', 'Cecillia', 'Tallis', 'played', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'lie', 'such', 'shocking', 'consequences', 'completely', 'lives', 'Briony', 'rest', 'life', 'seeking', 'forgiveness', 'appalling', 'act', 'story', 'told', 'backdrop', 'WWII', 'three', 'points', 'view', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'flashbacks', 'forwards.Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'splendid', 'job', 'contrasting', 'two', 'worlds', 'beginning', 'filled', 'whimsical', 'pastel', 'colors', 'exquisite', 'English', 'Countryside', 'drenched', 'glowing', 'sunshine', 'where', 'everything', 'sense', 'timeless', 'perfection', 'only', 'be', 'followed', 'dark', 'ominous', 'gritty', 'images', 'war', 'France.The', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'top-notch', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'strong', 'emotion-filled', 'performance', 'great', 'depth', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'effortlessly', 'role', 'high-class', 'daughter', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'speaks', 'line', 'such', 'eloquence', 'treat', 'just', 'listen', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'child', 'actresses', 'late', 'profound', 'maturity', 'intensity', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'so', 'perfect', 'small', 'role', 'Briony', 'older', 'years', 'still', 'make', 'impression', 'able', 'convey', 'such', 'emotion', 'solely', 'expressions.Every', 'level', 'production', 'so', 'perfect', 'absolute', 'triumph', 'Notably', 'cinematography', 'was', 'dazzling', 'containing', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'complex', 'single-take', 'movie', 'history', 'yes', 'even', 'topped', 'Children', 'Men', 'as', 'well', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'magnificent', 'sweeping', 'score', 'filled', 'original', 'theme', 'simple', 'exquisite', 'beauty.Atonement', 'truly', 'best', 'film', '2007']",N/A
1143414,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0013K7ZPE,Turfseer,"[2, 6]","Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy.The first hour of Atonement is interminably long. The viewer soon discovers there's very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale. In a nutshell, Briony, a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with Robbie, the housekeeper's son, who lives on their estate. Briony is the Brit version of the 'Bad Seed' but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality (oh my, upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeeper's son having sex in the library!!!). Speaking of that library scene, do you really believe that Cecilia and Robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them? And what about the crude note Robbie gives to Briony to give to her sister? If he loved her so much, why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to Briony (who he could have easily guessed would have looked at it?).Worse than these plot contrivances, is the accusation of rape that lands Robbie in jail. Notice how Cecilia hardly sticks up for Robbie at all as he's hauled away by the police. Wouldn't she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family? The 'investigation' into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen. In real life, many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued. There's none of that here since 'Atonement' must fit the classic melodramatic mold--an innocent lover (victim Robbie) is broken by Bad Seed victimizer (Briony). At least there is an antagonist--for awhile--but Briony then disappears until the end of the movie, only to reappear (in the imagination) of a now elderly Briony who is working on her ""21st"" and ""last"" novel. The now reinvented Briony is a nurse (who opts not to go to Cambridge) and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the War effort. And the elderly Briony somehow 'atones' for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement: the 18 year old Briony apologizes to Robbie and allows the star-crossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore (this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by Briony the novelist that Robbie died at Dunkirk and her sister was killed during the Blitz).Atonement gets high marks for atmosphere and mood. It has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters. The characters here are one-dimensional in that the upper-class Brits are petty despots (the children reflect the parents' hostility) and the working class are hapless victims (exemplified by Robbie and his mother).

1143415,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0013K7ZPE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","Based upon the novel by Ian Mcewan, ATONEMENT is a beautifully shot and constructed movie that examines the power of perspective, the importance of truth, and how differences between the two can clash and affect people's lives.  The film opens in 1935 England in a beautiful country estate.  Thirteen-year old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) is a precocious girl attempting to establish herself as a writer by writing tales of fantasy and plays that she and her friends can act out for their families.  Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is in love with the son of one of the housekeepers, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), and is eager to marry and start her life anew.  Briony has a secret crush on Robbie which alters the perspective of some of the things she sees.  She thinks that there is something sinister about the flirtations between Cecilia and Robbie and when she catches them in a sudden moment of lovemaking, she believes that Robbie is a sex criminal who is attempting to hurt her sister.  That night when a young girl that is staying with the family is sexually assaulted, even though she did not see his face, Briony accuses Robbie of committing the crime.  He is arrested and taken away and the lives of Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, and all of their friends and family are horribly altered.The movie tells the story from two different perspectives: that of Briony's and that of what actually happened.  The story if first seen from Briony's perspective. Then after a certain sequence it rewinds to the beginning of the sequence and the audience is shown what actually happened.  This doesn't occur during the entire movie, but it does happen about four times throughout the film.  Some of the people I watched the movie with found the effect annoying, but I felt it fit with the story being told and the messages the film seems to be interested in having people discuss.As far as movies go, ATONEMENT is pretty much a straight drama interlaced with a bit of romance.  The plot itself isn't really interesting just by itself, but becomes intriguing when interlaced with the issue of perspective.  The acting is fairly well done and it's nice to Keira Knightley attempting to play a full-grown woman.  I was particularly impressed by the performances of James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, Saorise Ronan as the thirteen-year old Briony, and Romola Garai as the older Briony working as a nurse during WWII.The film's strongest points are the settings, cinematography, and editing.  The scenery is lush, vivid, and full of tones that reflect the mood and atmosphere of a particular scene.  The cinematography is amazing, particularly an extended five-and-a-half minute tracking shot take at what is supposed to be Dunkirk beach.  The set that was constructed in Redcar, England for the shot is an impressive piece of scenery and one of the most visually stunning I have seen built specifically for a movie in the past few years.  Director Joe Wright did a marvelous job of bringing it altogether.ATONEMENT isn't a very happy or uplifting movie.  There is very little joy in the picture and the story revolves around a girl trying to atone for the actions that disrupted her peaceful, idyllic existence and brought her into womanhood. Like some other excellent movies from 2007 (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THERE WILL BE BLOOD), the movie ends somewhat abruptly.  There is a sense of closure, but the audience is left at the end of the movie revaluating everything they have seen, trying to piece together what was real and what was not.Highly recommended for film buffs, especially those who enjoy excellent cinematography.  Also recommended for those who enjoy classy, English dramas with a bit of romance.",4,Dream Another Dream,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,3717,"['Based', 'novel', 'Ian', 'Mcewan', 'ATONEMENT', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'constructed', 'movie', 'power', 'perspective', 'importance', 'truth', 'how', 'differences', 'two', 'can', 'clash', 'affect', 'people', 'lives', 'film', '1935', 'England', 'beautiful', 'country', 'estate', 'Thirteen-year', 'old', 'Briony', 'Tallis', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'precocious', 'girl', 'attempting', 'establish', 'writer', 'writing', 'tales', 'fantasy', 'plays', 'friends', 'can', 'act', 'out', 'families', 'Briony', 'older', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'love', 'son', 'one', 'housekeepers', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'eager', 'marry', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'Briony', 'secret', 'crush', 'Robbie', 'perspective', 'things', 'something', 'sinister', 'flirtations', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'when', 'sudden', 'moment', 'lovemaking', 'Robbie', 'sex', 'criminal', 'who', 'attempting', 'hurt', 'sister', 'night', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'staying', 'family', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'face', 'Briony', 'Robbie', 'committing', 'crime', 'arrested', 'taken', 'away', 'lives', 'Briony', 'Cecilia', 'Robbie', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'horribly', 'altered.The', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'perspectives', 'Briony', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'story', 'first', 'seen', 'Briony', 'perspective', 'Then', 'certain', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'sequence', 'audience', 'shown', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', ""n't"", 'occur', 'entire', 'movie', 'happen', 'four', 'times', 'film', 'people', 'watched', 'movie', 'found', 'effect', 'annoying', 'felt', 'fit', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'messages', 'film', 'be', 'interested', 'having', 'people', 'discuss.As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'ATONEMENT', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'drama', 'interlaced', 'bit', 'romance', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'interesting', 'just', 'intriguing', 'when', 'interlaced', 'issue', 'perspective', 'acting', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'attempting', 'play', 'full-grown', 'woman', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'performances', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Robbie', 'Turner', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'Briony', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'older', 'Briony', 'working', 'nurse', 'WWII.The', 'film', 'strongest', 'points', 'are', 'settings', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'scenery', 'lush', 'vivid', 'full', 'tones', 'reflect', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'particular', 'scene', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'particularly', 'extended', 'five-and-a-half', 'minute', 'tracking', 'shot', 'take', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'Dunkirk', 'beach', 'set', 'was', 'constructed', 'Redcar', 'England', 'shot', 'impressive', 'piece', 'scenery', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'have', 'seen', 'built', 'specifically', 'movie', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'bringing', 'altogether.ATONEMENT', ""n't"", 'very', 'happy', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'joy', 'picture', 'story', 'around', 'girl', 'trying', 'atone', 'actions', 'disrupted', 'peaceful', 'idyllic', 'existence', 'brought', 'womanhood', 'other', 'excellent', 'movies', '2007', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'THERE', 'WILL', 'BE', 'BLOOD', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'abruptly', 'sense', 'closure', 'audience', 'left', 'end', 'movie', 'revaluating', 'everything', 'have', 'seen', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'not.Highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'buffs', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'Also', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classy', 'English', 'dramas', 'bit', 'romance']",N/A

Normally I like ""period pieces"" but this film felt like a poor man's ""Titanic"" with a tragic love story and an old lady at the end looking back on her youth. The battle scenes didn't feel real to me - more like the background scenery you'd see in 3-D video games. WWII films made by people who never went to war (I'm assuming the director never did) ring false to me. The soldiers in this film march around, all rolling in mud and fake blood, but I never felt they were in real danger. The hospital death scenes feel fake and cliched (complete with the dying soldier who can't speak English). Strangely enough, it's the last scene with Knightley huddling in the Tube station that feels more emotionally powerful to me (I assume the director has had more experience riding the subway than going to war). As for Keira Knightley, her eating disorder (whether she wants to admit it she has it or not) made it hard for me to watch her in this film. She would have been far more convincing as a concentration camp victim than as a 1940's lady (Ingrid Bergman had flesh on her!). Every time McAvoy embraced her, I was afraid her bones would break.

In many respects the film ""Atonement"" is about both these definitions and how they can define a life. When pre-teen Briony (Saoirse Ronan in a spectacular performance) a budding writer catches Robbie (James McAvoy) the bright, young groundskeeper and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley)having sex in the study she pieces this along with other things she has seen to create a ""story"" for the police when a crime is committed that rips the two lovers apart.Older and wiser Briony (Romola Garai)tries to make amends and repair her relationship with Cecilia (now a nurse)and Robbie (who is now being sent overseas to fight) as best she can during WWII but finds the road to forgiveness difficult and painful.Screenwriter Christopher Hampton (the scripts for ""The Quiet American"" and ""Dangerous Liaisons"") captures the essence of the novel capturing the spirit as well something that is rare for film adaptations from a popular novel. Director Joe Wright (""Pride and Prejudice"") is no stranger to the peril of translating a novel to film does a marvelous job of making ""Atonement"" cinematic in every respect. You'd be forgiven for the mistaken belief that this isn't adapted from another medium.ABOUT THE DVD: ""Atonement"" looks marvelous in its DVD incarnation with colors that perfectly capture both the pre-War bright colors of the film and the somber tones of London and France during WWII. Detail is sharp and a very nice, smooth film-like quality to the DVD.THE SPECIAL FEATURES:We get a solid batch of special features with ""Atonement"". The best special feature, however, is director Joe Wright's commentary track which provides intricate detail about the challenges of shooting the film--particularly the amazing tracking shot on the beach of Dunkirk which only took three takes (amazingly) to perfect. It's a good thing, too, since it was shot using Steadicam requiring the camera operator to lug the camera up and down the beach. It's a brilliant sequence easily as cinematic as anything that the Coens or Ridley Scott dreamed up for their big films from last year ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""American Gangster"".We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Wright, a solid featurette on the making of the film. The ""Novel to the Screen"" featurette is pretty interesting as well detailing the challenges of translating the written word to a visual medium without losing the very qualities that made the novel so memorable.The one flaw the film has is that it runs a bit too long and could have been trimmed without losing the dramatic power of the film. That observation is purely subjective however as some people will probably love the film just the way it is.Largely overlooked by Oscar this year, ""Atonement"" may be a bit stuffy and more conventional on the surface in a Masterpiece Theater way when compared to ""No Country for Old Men"", ""There Will Be Blood"" or the experimental ""I'm Not There"" but that surface is as deceptive as Briony's story.

After hearing about all of the accolades received by ""Atonement"", my wife and I decided to rent this film and give it a shot.  After all, anything voted ""Best Picture"" has got to be pretty decent.  Right?  Um, yeah.  I guess we were wrong.  I have now completely lost all respect and regard for some of these so-called ""professional movie critics"".  Atonement is painfully slow-moving, with dull characters and a complete lack of the dramatic.  By the time we reached the mid-way point, this movie had lost me completely and I found myself wishing that it would just end already.Some people out there would surely accuse me of needing to be spoon-fed nothing but action, violence, and gore.  Nonsense.  Try watching the movie ""Amadeus"", which is one of my favorite movies of all time and achieves a wonderfully dramatic and moving storyline without the use of such bells and whistles.  Truly a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling.  None of this is to be found in ""Atonement"", which is simply 130 minutes of crust.  There is a fine line between character/story development, and simply nothing happening outside of boring and pointless dialogue.  Atonement falls into the latter of the two categories.I'm sorry, but adding a WWII theme and dragging the story out to a 2+ hour run time does not simply result in an ""epic"" film, nor does it put the film into the same category as ""Titanic"", or even a ""Pearl Harbor"".

The production designs & costumes were absolutely breathtaking.  Especially during the first half of the movie, which took place at the Tallis' estate in Surrey.  The wallpaper in Briony's room being on such a large scale and the way the little toy animals & such were placed in such an exact fashion, toward Briony gives the viewer an instant insight into her world of complete control.  Right off there are subtle clues to all the main characters present & future.  The way the movie is  first shown thru Briony's eyes, then we see the same exact scenes from other point of view.  You know Briony is a control freak, especially when she tries to put on her play & when things don't go exactly as she planned, quickly abandons the whole idea.  Director Joe Wright uses everything at his disposal to create a true cinematic experience.  He jumps from wide shorts to extreme close ups, giving the viewer the sense that this is a very small part of a much larger world.  The soundtrack is perfect, in an exciting & haunting way.  It is used to the best advantage, the beat of the music in correlation to the action of the characters.The acting was first rate.  There is not one weak link in the entire movie.  Kiera Knightely is superb, starting out distant, cold & remote, then slowly transforming as she begins to truly grasp her true feelings about Robbie.  James McAvoy is so convincing as the perfect human being, absolutely no chips on his shoulders, despite being university educated, but working class & poor, he can comfortable switch from the two extreme classes.  You can easily see the worlds thru his optimistic view.  Then after the horrible lie told by Briony, he is a changed man.  Bitterness and oppression slowly creep in but his love for Cecilia keeps the battle going between light & dark.  You can easily watch the inner turmoil on Robbie's face.  The inner turmoil is beautifully reflected by the outer turmoil of war & destruction, especially during the Dunkirk sequence.  The moment when he enters the cinema, frantically looking for something to drink, only to be lead into empty movie theater, while a humongous screen is depicting two lovers desperately, passionately kissing one another.  All 3 actresses playing Briony are perfect, both in their resemblance of each other & portraying the emotions each are going thru at that time in Briony's life.This is not a movie for everyone.  It is an emotional journey, and an intelligent movie. It is a movie that makes you feel and question.  For those that like fast action, mindless entertainment, this will bore you to tears.

That was barely what the film was trying to convey!This film was an artistic vision of what most of us experience in our childhood and young adulthood but what we most want to mask and keep hidden behind society's facade and social etiquette; it's about how our ugly yet beautiful realities can shape who we become or how dire those consequences can reach and destroy our whole lives. It's about how our minds can conjure such nasty and ugly thoughts yet at the same time feel beautiful emotions of love and passion. It's a dichotomy of chaos and order filtering in our minds--from spitefulness to atonement, and in our realties--from war to peace.Consequence and time were also big themes in Atonement. The director showed that numerous times by making the shots have no editing with almost dance-like panning camera movements where the audience would think the time frame was going forward in the story-line when it was really going backward in time. The director also added many slow & fast motion rewinds to several crucial scenes--hence the feeling you get of how important time is in our lives and to try to savor it instead of rushing through it, as well as the serious consequence of not thinking before you act; and how one simple action can change myriad of events throughout one's lifetime.It leaves you with the sense of how different one little girl's life and a loving couple's story would have been like without that one single letter that sealed their fate into a tragedy.And in the end, the film conveys how fantasy, dreams and falsehoods may be the only things that can keep us sane and to endure.This is not to be missed if you share a deep understanding of how through film--and  not through dialogue and storyline--a  piece of art can be portrayed as a portal of what we humans truly feel and what we hide most dearly in polite society.Absolutely brilliant!",5,Brilliant Film!!!,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2830,"['brilliant', 'example', 'where', 'filming', 'music', 'editing', 'camera', 'panning', 'angles', 'colors', 'costumes', 'light', 'positioning', 'non', 'verbal', 'acting', 'so', 'on-translated', 'story', 'audience', 'such', 'depth', 'palpable', 'emotions', 'verbal', 'dialogue', 'storyline', 'become', 'insignificant.The', 'meaning', 'movie', 'what', 'director', 'translated', 'novel', 'was', 'conveying', 'nuance', 'characters', 'emotions', 'distorted', 'perceptions', 'especially', 'distorted', 'perceptions', 'one', 'innocent', 'little', 'girl', 'discovering', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'did', 'not', 'understand.It', 'rare', 'gift', 'when', 'director', 'can', 'make', 'squirm', 'seat', 'time', 'tried', 'show', 'lurking', 'emotions', 'characters', 'expressions', 'be', 'lust', 'debauchery', 'love', 'passion', 'evil', 'desolation', 'death', 'innocence', 'hope.Yes', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'torn', 'apart', 'foolish', 'misinformed', 'child', 'was', 'shallowest', 'part', 'can', 'grasp', 'film', 'was', 'barely', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'film', 'was', 'artistic', 'vision', 'what', 'most', 'experience', 'childhood', 'young', 'adulthood', 'what', 'most', 'want', 'mask', 'keep', 'hidden', 'society', 'facade', 'social', 'etiquette', 'how', 'ugly', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'realities', 'can', 'shape', 'who', 'become', 'how', 'dire', 'consequences', 'can', 'reach', 'destroy', 'whole', 'lives', 'how', 'minds', 'can', 'conjure', 'such', 'nasty', 'ugly', 'thoughts', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'beautiful', 'emotions', 'love', 'passion', 'dichotomy', 'chaos', 'order', 'filtering', 'minds', 'spitefulness', 'atonement', 'realties', 'war', 'peace.Consequence', 'time', 'were', 'also', 'big', 'themes', 'Atonement', 'director', 'showed', 'numerous', 'times', 'making', 'shots', 'have', 'editing', 'almost', 'dance-like', 'panning', 'camera', 'movements', 'where', 'audience', 'would', 'think', 'time', 'frame', 'was', 'going', 'forward', 'story-line', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'backward', 'time', 'director', 'also', 'added', 'many', 'slow', 'fast', 'motion', 'several', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'hence', 'feeling', 'get', 'how', 'important', 'time', 'lives', 'try', 'savor', 'instead', 'rushing', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'consequence', 'not', 'thinking', 'act', 'how', 'one', 'simple', 'action', 'can', 'change', 'myriad', 'events', 'one', 'lifetime.It', 'sense', 'how', 'different', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'life', 'loving', 'couple', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'single', 'letter', 'sealed', 'fate', 'tragedy.And', 'end', 'film', 'conveys', 'how', 'fantasy', 'dreams', 'falsehoods', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'things', 'can', 'keep', 'sane', 'endure.This', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'share', 'deep', 'understanding', 'how', 'through', 'film', 'not', 'dialogue', 'storyline', 'piece', 'art', 'can', 'be', 'portrayed', 'portal', 'what', 'humans', 'truly', 'feel', 'what', 'hide', 'most', 'dearly', 'polite', 'society.Absolutely', 'brilliant']",N/A
