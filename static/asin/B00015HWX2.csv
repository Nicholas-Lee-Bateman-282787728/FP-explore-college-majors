793568,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00015HWX2,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","This was an impressive 92 minutes of filmmaking. I cannot wait to see it again. They story was tight, the acting was decent, and it seemed to flow with the greatest of ease. There was a continuity in Dummy that is not seen in some movies today. Characters remained true to their initial structure. While events did happen that changed the overall outcome of the characters, they were true to themselves until the very end, and that is a very rare event in most Hollywood big name films.So, what stood out the most in this film? The first that comes to mind is the music. While sleep was forcing my eyes to open and close randomly, my ears stayed tuned to the wonderful music from this film. It reminded me of the music used in Wes Anderson's stories, but with a bit more edge. It seemed to come out of nowhere and leave a very big impression on you as it moved in and out of scenes. The music, both spoken word and score, made you think about the scene and why it was crucial to the story. It connected our random characters, making us see their true self, if only for a brief moment. The music to this film was very important to the overall storytelling and left the biggest impression on me.The ventriloquist dummy was one of the freakiest characters that I have ever seen. Director Greg Pritikin takes this simple object, and enhances the features (in some way) to give us a very lifelike co-star. The big green eyes that are constantly moving and head motions which draws away the attention from Brody himself, allow us to connect with this inanimate object. The dummy provides most of the humor in the film and yet is also the truest character in the film. While the others talk about their dreams and hopes yet do not follow them you discover that the words coming out of the dummy's mouth are the truth. He is the only character in this film doing what he is supposed to be doing. This is a film about discovery. Each character in this film has not found themselves yet. They are all harboring secrets that they are afraid to show to the real world. That is where the dummy comes in. He speaks the truth. He holds no secrets. He does not lie.Early in the film Steven learns that by having these motions with a dummy, it forces the audience to keep their eyes off your mouth and onto the actions of the doll. This was exactly the case in this film. My eyes, for the majority of the time, were not on Brody, but on his wooden counterpart. For the first time, I wanted to get to know the nameless prop before I wanted to see the living characters. This is hard for a film to do, but Dummy pulled it off with the greatest of ease. I understand that the dummy is a representation of Steven, and the words that are coming out of the dummy's mouth are actually Steven's inner thoughts, but there was something lifelike about the dummy. I saw it as the person that Steven wanted to be, but was afraid to become. This film reminded me of those movies that involve a character discovering who they really are with the aid of a sidekick (like small child, old person, or animal). Instead of a living being helping Steven through life, it is the dummy.You see the fruits of this friendship when Steven is actually forced to look at his life without the doll. Can he survive and be himself without the aid of his wooden friend? One of my favorite scenes of this film was the ending when Steven uses his talent of throwing his voice to help save his girlfriend and sister from the evil accountant. It is very rare that you find a film that uses this tactic, and I was jumping for joy when I witnessed it. Then, to summarize the freakiness of the doll, there was a final scene when it winked at Steven. Ahhhhh.............Overall, this was a fabulous film. If you find yourself in the mood for something light, yet dark, heavy, yet light, funny, yet wickedly disturbing, then I suggest Dummy. The acting was the only part I was having some trouble with throughout the film. I think everyone could have been a bit more over the top, but again, your eyes are mostly focused on the doll, and it gives the performance of a lifetime.Grade: **** out of *****",4,I look both ways when I cross the street.

793570,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00015HWX2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Dummy never really felt like anything substantial.  Certainly not worth recommending either.  It's about Adrien Brody who falls in love with a lady (counselor) at the unemployment line.His family consists of pretty generic characters such as a greedy and selfish sister always wanting to borrow a car and live the good life, a mother who's outspoken but never given enough time to shine, and a rocker chick for a friend that likes to have fun, be obnoxious and unintentionally embarrass everyone she's with in public due to her rude behavior.  She's by FAR the best character because she's the only one who I find remotely interesting.While Adrien Brody plays the role of a ventriloquist pretty well and I suppose a reasonable amount of time was devoted to him and his dummy, the storyline never really got off the ground as far as I could tell.  Everything is entirely ho hum and uninteresting.  It's basically all about Adrien's character impressing the lady he meets at the unemployment line so it's more a romance than anything else (and not a drama as advertised).  I guess the scene with Adrien sitting in his underwear practicing his ventriloquist skills when the cops walk into his bedroom is pretty funny, but nothing else really caught my attention.

So, it was a must-see! Adrien Brody (THE JACKET, SPLICE, PREDATORS) plays Steven Schoichet, a nebbish-y guy obsessed w/ ventriloquism. He purchases a DUMMY, and practices faithfully. Steven wants to go out w/ his employment counselor (Vera Farmiga- ORPHAN, THE CONJURING). Will she understand the weirdness of Steven and his family? Meanwhile, his sister Heidi's (Illeana Douglas- TO DIE FOR, OTIS) life is swirling down the emotional drain. Her ex is stalking her through Steven, while she arranges cheeezy weddings for a living. Milla Jovovich  (RESIDENT EVIL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT, .45) is phenomenal in her role as Steven's best friend, Fangora! She is a ball of raw emotion, let loose on anyone and everyone! Her singing for her punk rock band is both sincere and hilarious, especially during the wedding reception at the end of the movie. Speaking of singing, Ms. Douglas gets her turn to show what she can do, proving that she has pipes as well! Brody is great as the awkward, semi-insane heart of the story. DUMMY is funny, goofy, and endearing without turning into total goop! Hell, we even get Ron Leibman (SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE) and Jessica Walter (PLAY MISTY FOR ME) as Steven's parents!

TV GUIDE ONLINE critic Maitland McDonagh described this quirky young-adults-coming-of-age comedy as ""repetitive and obvious but somehow endearing, like a truly ugly dog with sweet eyes,"" and I pretty much agree with her assessment. This Long Island-based story of a pair of twentysomething siblings still living at home with their annoying, critical parents (real-life spouses Jessica Walter and Ron Leibman are so convincing as Mom and Dad, it's scary!) while trying to find their respective paths to independence could have been shrill and tiresome, and at times it teeters dangerously close to being so. Luckily, the superb leads bring a gentle, non-cloying sweetness and poignancy to their performances that makes you keep watching and rooting for them. That's saying quite a bit when you consider that the road to full-tilt adulthood for brother Steven (Brody) involves honing his ventriloquism skills (Brody learned ventriloquism for his role, and he does a good job! I wonder if Brody drops such acquired-for-a-role skills once the movie wraps, or if he keeps them honed just for fun?) with a rather unnerving, unnamed dummy (not to keep digressing, but with such rare exceptions as Charlie McCarthy, aren't most ventriloquist's dummies rather unnerving? :-) as he woos Lorena, his employment counselor (enchantingly played by Vera Farmiga), who's got issues of her own. High-strung sister Heidi (Illeana Douglas) has given up her dream of becoming a singer to forge a career as a wedding planner.  She's got her work cut out for her, what with an inept stalker ex-fiance (Jared Harris) dogging her every move, her first major professional assignment turning out to be a Jewish wedding where the bride insists on klezmer music, and not owning her own car; the scenes where Heidi has to beg their mom for the car are both funny and painful. Adding to all this anxiety-laced wackiness is Steven's high school pal Fangora, n&eacute;e Fanny (Milla Jovovich), an aspiring punk rocker and all-around nutty chick who claims she can play klezmer music so she'll get the wedding gig, as well as giving Steven well-meant but questionable advice on how to win Lorena's heart, such as spray-painting a message on Lorena's front door. Fortunately, in writer/director Greg Pritikin's world, even restraining orders and omnipresent ventriloquist's dummies can't block the path to love and happiness for long, and everyone gets what they deserve. Brody and Douglas are particularly well-cast; with their attractively angular faces, almond-shaped green eyes, and overall air of angst, they make very convincing siblings.

793578,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00015HWX2,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","""Dummy"" is one of the weirdest, most heartwarming indie films that most moviegoers have never seen. Unless they are rabid Adrian Brody fans.That's unfortunate, because this wild, slightly surreal film is enormous fun. It starts off with a quirky family, like a suburban Wes Anderson story, but slowly becomes something more heartwarming as the hero learns to follow his bliss. It's weird enough to be cool, but sweet enough to give you the warm fuzzies.Steven Schoichet (Adrian Brody) is a suburban Dilbert. His job is a dead end, and he's still living with his battleship-building dad, his sweetly oblivious mom and his embittered sister Heidi (Illeana Douglas). On impulse, he decides to buy a ventriloquist's dummy and learns how to use it. This, he decides, is his new job.Making things more complex is the fact that he is falling in love with his unemployment counsellor (Vera Farmiga). Punk-rocker Fangora (Milla Jovovich) decides to help Steven win her over, despite his weird family. But her advice only causes more problems, and soon Steven has to learn that the real him is the most attractive. Will the dummy help Steven find love, or will he lapse back into his dreary, passionless life?It's definitely a variation on a typical movie plot: Boy meets dummy. Dummy helps boy meet girl. Boy loses girl. Dummy helps boy pluck up the courage to get girl back. Yup, this is not your typical movie, since the hero's sidekick is a wooden doll.But while that's the surface of it, the real plot of ""Dummy"" is about following your bliss, whether it's your soulmate, a wooden dummy, a career or your art. In other words, cast off your ""realistic"" life if it doesn't make you happy, and just follow what you secretly long to do. You'll be happier for it.Yeah, it sounds mushy. But it's wrapped up in a plot so offbeat you won't notice, especially since there is a subplot about Fanny's punk band having to learn Yiddish klezmer music. Writer/director Greg Pritikin directs like a more relaxed Wes Anderson, with odd camerawork and deadpan humor (""You look like a child molester!"" Heidi says about the dummy).All the actors in this are good, no matter how minor their roles. Adrian Brody does a wonderful job as a Steven, whose real personality only shines through when he has his dummy to speak for him. He's sweet, sensitive and downtrodden. And Jovovich steals each scene as the foul-mouthed, fatigue-clad, shoplifting, exuberant and wild Fanny, who lives for her punk music.Romantics and black comedy fans will enjoy ""Dummy,"" with its weird characters and oddball humor.

Reminiscent of such masterpieces as ""The Fisher King"" and ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Dummy"" is that rare film that allows us the opportunity to comfortably laugh at our own cowardice and take ourselves less seriously. Adrian Brody dceparts dramatically from his somber role in ""The Pianist"" in this equally quiet but far warmer portrait of a dead-end drop-out who takes up the art of ventrilloquism while living with his parents. The perfect counterpart to his incurable shyness is played by Milla Jovovich, who masterfully captures the vibrant personality of a punk-rocking tom boy. As we observe Steven -- Brody's character -- fumble through common human endeavors such as love, survival and ambition, we leave a piece of our hearts in the hands of he and the whole hard-hitting cast. This at once hysterical and provocative story only falters as it succumbs to a Speilberg-like temptation to blind the audience with rose-colored glassesd as Steven, his sister and his punk-rocker side kick all suddenly realize their boldest dreams in a broad stroke of miraculous fate. It is a surprisingly mawkish turn of events for an indie film, but the movie is so strong as a whole that this unfortunately timed misstep does not distract from the power of the acting and the script.

After being fired he decides to go for his dream - to become a ventriloquist.  The most amazing side effect of working with a dummy is Steven develops an edge to his otherwise bland character and life takes on a whole new direction.Egged on by his best friend the punk, Fangora, a foul-mouthed, strident loser in her own right played with zero charm by Milla Jovovich, Steven takes risks that sound like bad ideas to him - and prove to be just that.Steven's not the only loser at home, his older sister - a hilariously deadpan Ileana Douglas - gave up her own dream of becoming a singer.  It's easy to see where the this pair of siblings lack of self esteem comes from once we meet Mom and Dad.  The entire family could easily fall into the realm of stereotype or caricature, but Jessica Walter and Ron Liebman make this material fresh and hilarious.  When Steven invites his potential paramour, a single mother, to a family dinner, the results are, predictably, outrageously funny.There is a love story woven into Dummy, but ultimately it's Steven's journey of self-awareness and acceptance that is the heart of this story and that impresses the most.

Maybe it was the DVD cover art or the title or the fact, that I'm a fan of many of the actors in the movie. Well, I'm glad I did, because ""Dummy"" turned out to be a small, charming, indie-style film, that leaves you with a good feeling.This comedy/drama is about a rather meek, shy guy named Steven (Adrien Brody), who has reached what seems like the crossroads of his life. He lives at home in suburbia with his dysfunctional family, works in a dead end job and dosn't have much going in the romance department.  Approaching thirty, he feels like his life is in a rut. This all changes, when Steven makes the decision to leave his job and in a awkward, yet determined fashion, follow his dream of becoming a professional ventriloquist. Everyone in his life seems to have both an opinion and advice about this. This includes Steven's cynical, romance-lorne sister, Heidi (Illeana Douglas) who works as a wedding planner, his emotionally volatile, best friend, Fangora (Milla Jovovich) and finally the young, pretty, career counselor, Lorena (Vera Farmiga), who is the object of Steven's romantic interests.Steven's actions seem to effect all these characters. They are all in one way or another unhappy people, who's lives change, when they follow Steven's example and follow their dreams. What those dreams are just might surprise you.This is a small film about changing lives. The characters are rather quirky, even sometimes hard to watch. But in the end the film has a charming, almost magical feeling, that will leave you with a smile on your face. All four of the film's lead actors give terrific performances.

Filthy-mouthed friend Fangora (Milla Jovovich) provides some humor, though her character was generally a nut case.Extras include deleted scenes, some ventriloquism pointers, and a lackluster commentary by ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and characters (though his own DVD is hiliarious.) Note it seems like there is a format problem with the disk, but make sure BOTH the DVD player and TV are set to 16:9 or widescreen, and it will look OK.

It's a shame, because the movie is good and the acting is excellent.  Personally, I think Adrien Brody is an excellent actor who slides into and becomes whichever character he is playing (see him in Midnight in Paris).  This role is no different, Brody is outstanding.The film was shot in 2002 the same year as The Pianist, Brody's breakout movie.  The Pianist was released in 2002 and Dummy, a year later.  Since Brody won an Oscar for The Pianist, I don't understand the lack of exposure this film received.

793586,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00015HWX2,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 5]","Adrien Brody followed his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Pianist"" by choosing this script about a loser transformed by his relationships with, first, a dummy and, second, a girlfriend.This is a quirky romantic comedy with a great cast including Ron Liebman, Illeana Douglas, Milla Jovovich and Jessica Walter. But none of these distinguished actors can turn this turnip into a rose, Brody included. They all try very hard, though, especially in their lurid intrafamily relationships.Ultimately, what I believe fails most in this film is the relationship between ventriloquist Brody and his dummy, which is eerily reminiscent of the relationship between psychotics and dummies in slasher films. In effect, the dummy runs Brody's life until he decides he can do it on his own.

It had me and my husband cracking up with laughter in almost every scene due to the dialogue between a whacky cast of characters, the physical humor/comedy, and the circumstances of the characters themselves!Adrien Brody stars in the leading role as Steven, a quiet, shy introverted loser, still living at home with his parents, despite being in his late twenties! Steven's parents are completely dysfunctional and out of touch with reality altogether. Also living at home are Steven's senile grandma and his adult, embittered/caustic sister who has given up on life & her dream of becoming a singer. She reluctantly becomes a wedding planner. To  top it all off, she's also being stalked by a deranged ex-fiance, whom her mother stills wants her to marry!Steven is fired from his day job and in turn decides to purchase a wooden dummy and become a ventroliquist---- a life long dream! The ""dummy"" becomes Steven's alter ego and helps him come out of his shell and become a better person. He falls in love with his career counselor and attempts to make a love connection with his career counselor with the help of his best friend, Fangora (or Fanny to her friends), played by Milla Jovovich.In Fact, Milla Jovovich steals every scene in this movie with her acting skills and gives a performance NOT TO BE MISSED!

This is a movie that, on the surface, would've never made my ""must see"" list.  Fortunately, my husband buys movies compulsively.  We have a stockpile of films yet to be seen, and he keeps buying more.  So, it's Friday night, the family is in the living room with pizza, and he puts Gothika into the player.  After the opening credits, the movie begins with a string of F-words and graphic dialogue, and that's when he decides it probably isn't a family-friendly film.  So, he walks into the room and puts in Dummy.  The kids and I couldn't help assuming the dummy was going to turn into a mass-murderer, knowing my husband's penchant for B-horror flicks.  Instead, we saw a heartwarming and sensitive but quirky film.  It completely engrossed me, and my boys, ages 13 and 10.  The 10 year old is quite a quirky character himself.  I'm sure this touched him on a completely different level.This film is funny, in an I-can't-believe-I'm-laughing-about-this-it-should-be-painful kind of way, yet poignant.  While not as dark as, say, ""Secretary"", it is still dark enough.  The whole thrust of the story is that we all have a place and a dream and we're not really complete until we give our dream some credence.The acting was terrific, across the board.  Each character is lovable and there is no magic cure-all moment where everything wraps up neat and tidy.  Even the side characters are multi-faceted.  At the end of the story, characters have grown but they also retain their personalities.  It is a charming, well-played story, and I highly recommend it.  If you could appreciate the charm of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", then you will ""get"" this movie.My only complaint is about the DVD itself.  It is full-screen, so you miss the edges.  Literally.  For example, the opening credits list ""rien Brody"" and ""Milla Jovo"" as the actors in this film.  There is also an integral scene at the family dinner table where the dialogue/action is at the edges of the screen, so you miss out on the important facial expressions.  It is frustrating in this day and age to see a movie released with such skimpiness.

793589,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00015HWX2,Lleu Christopher,"[0, 1]","Adrien Brody plays Steven, a nerdy, insecure and unemployed man who lives with his dysfunctional family. Illeana Douglas gives a typically excellent performance as his unhappy sister Heidi. Steven can't seem to find his niche, but when he decides to pursue  ventriloquism, things start to happen for him. He finds that by talking through his dummy, he is better able to express himself. His advisor at the unemployment office is an attractive woman named Lorena (Vera Farmiga) who he wants to ask out. He is inhibited by his shyness and awkwardness, but his wild musician friend Fanny (Milla Javovich) convinces him to declare his affection for  Lorena by sneaking to her house at night and writing on her door. This results in Lorena calling the police and getting a restraining order against Steven. This sequence of events highlights the edgy quality of Dummy that doesn't always quite work. Steven's behavior in much of the film, not only when he commits the above blunder, but  the way he constantly carries around and interacts with his dummy, borders on the bizarre and it is a stretch of the imagination to believe Lorena would want to continue seeing him. Still, Brody manages to convey a sincerity and vulnerability such that we can almost believe a normal woman like Lorena might overlook his strangeness. If Lorena seems nice and sane, she is about the only one in the film who is (a good thing; too many nice and normal characters makes for a dull story). Jovovich is good as the rebel punk  singer with an unpredictable energy. Steven's parents (Jessica Walter, Ron Leibman) are an odd pair;  his mother appears to be right out of a sitcom, always offering people food, but we learn that she really isn't all smiles and sunshine; his father, meanwhile, is obsessively preoccupied with building model ships. The anger and pain that erupts in places goes beyond the superficial tameness of most mainstream movies, and this is refreshing. Heidi's stalker ex-boyfriend (Jared Harris) makes several appearances to further complicate matters; his character is alternately frightening and amusing. Despite all this quirkiness, Dummy ultimately has the rather common movie message that following your dreams will solve all of your problems. Steven actually quotes Joseph Campbell at one point (&quot;follow your bliss&quot;). Dummy is an interesting film that hits you with unexpected moments of laughter, discomfort and poignancy; if writer/director Greg Pritikin hadn't felt compelled to force these elements into such a neat, Hollywoodish package it might have been even better.",3,Ventriloquism as therapy,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,2587,"['Adrien', 'Brody', 'Steven', 'nerdy', 'insecure', 'unemployed', 'man', 'who', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'typically', 'excellent', 'performance', 'unhappy', 'sister', 'Heidi', 'Steven', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'niche', 'when', 'pursue', 'ventriloquism', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'talking', 'dummy', 'better', 'able', 'express', 'advisor', 'unemployment', 'office', 'attractive', 'woman', 'named', 'Lorena', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'who', 'ask', 'out', 'inhibited', 'shyness', 'awkwardness', 'wild', 'musician', 'friend', 'Fanny', 'Milla', 'Javovich', 'declare', 'affection', 'Lorena', 'sneaking', 'house', 'night', 'writing', 'door', 'results', 'Lorena', 'calling', 'police', 'getting', 'restraining', 'order', 'Steven', 'sequence', 'events', 'highlights', 'edgy', 'quality', 'Dummy', ""n't"", 'always', 'quite', 'work', 'Steven', 'behavior', 'much', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'above', 'blunder', 'way', 'constantly', 'interacts', 'dummy', 'borders', 'bizarre', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'believe', 'Lorena', 'would', 'want', 'continue', 'seeing', 'Still', 'Brody', 'convey', 'sincerity', 'vulnerability', 'such', 'can', 'almost', 'believe', 'normal', 'woman', 'Lorena', 'might', 'overlook', 'strangeness', 'Lorena', 'nice', 'sane', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'who', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'many', 'nice', 'normal', 'characters', 'dull', 'story', 'Jovovich', 'good', 'rebel', 'punk', 'singer', 'unpredictable', 'energy', 'Steven', 'parents', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'are', 'odd', 'pair', 'mother', 'be', 'right', 'sitcom', 'always', 'offering', 'people', 'food', 'learn', 'really', ""n't"", 'smiles', 'sunshine', 'father', 'meanwhile', 'obsessively', 'preoccupied', 'building', 'model', 'ships', 'anger', 'pain', 'places', 'superficial', 'tameness', 'most', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'refreshing', 'Heidi', 'stalker', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'several', 'appearances', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'character', 'alternately', 'frightening', 'amusing', 'quirkiness', 'Dummy', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'common', 'movie', 'message', 'following', 'dreams', 'will', 'solve', 'problems', 'Steven', 'actually', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'one', 'point', 'quot', 'follow', 'bliss', 'quot', 'Dummy', 'interesting', 'film', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'laughter', 'discomfort', 'poignancy', 'writer/director', 'Greg', 'Pritikin', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', 'compelled', 'force', 'elements', 'neat', 'Hollywoodish', 'package', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better']",Dummy

You write a quality screenplay, assemble an ensemble of very strong actors, turn this cast loose to slightly overplay each of your quirky characters, and find a quality editor to creatively assemble the film.Of course writing or finding a screenplay this good is not easy nor is assembling a dream cast like this one. Getting Adrien Brody, Milla Jovovich, Illeana Douglas, Vera Farmiga, and Jared Harris to play your five main characters is almost unparalleled. All are extremely strong actors who were attracted to this quirky project because Pritkin was willing to turn them loose to play off each other. Because each character in ""Dummy"" is at least slightly off-kilter these over-the-top performances achieve a wonderful balance.The cast has a Ukrainian favor, with Jovovich and Farmiga.  Milla plays a hilarious role totally unlike anything you have seen from her (although there are similarities to her ""Zoolander"" character). The ""R"" rating is solely due to Milla's language much of which is simply the funniest swearing in film history. Vera is absolutely fantastic as the guest at the family dinner table-less extreme yet funnier than the family dinner scene in the ""The Nutty Professor"".Jovovich's line about doing the ""hora"" refers to a dance frequently done at Jewish weddings. If you want to do it at your own wedding here are some instructions: 1. Stand in a circle holding the hands of the people on either side of you. 2. When the music starts, follow the circle as it rotates. 3. Step to the side, passing your left foot behind your right. 4. Move the right foot beside the left foot. 5. Step to the side again, passing your left foot in front of your right this time. 6. Continue as the circle keeps spinning, adding a little hop to your steps as you go faster. 7. Move toward the center of the circle and throw your hands, still holding those of the people beside you, in the air. 8. Lower your hands and move backward. 9. Repeat several times. 10.

There was really no aspect in this movie Plot wise and story-wise to even merit this movie worth watching all the way through. Adrien Brody isn't my favorite actor and he's really queer as Steven in this movie. The Dummy his character owned made the movie hard to watch (anyone who owns those things, are friggin' weird). The ONLY reason to watch this movie, is Milla Jovovich's character ""Fangora,"" a jumpy, potty mouthed, woman that's in a band, who basically helps out Brody's character out of his so-called ""shell"" when she lands a deal with his sister to play at a wedding. Only problem is she doesn't know how to sing Yiddish so that's where Brody's character comes in. Sorta. Other than that, you can just skip through all the scenes missing Jovovich and just watch the one's that include her in it. I couldn't care less about the main character Steven and his would be romance with unemployment woman (whose name escapes me). but Fangora was really funny in this movie. Milla can really make you laugh with her oddball character if you allow her to.

Adrien Brody is wonderful in his portrayal of the Jewish loner who still lives with his parents and the only way he can easily communicate to the world is through his ventriloquist dummy.  Artisan did a wonderful job in their casting.  Ron Liebman and Jessica Walter are the perfect real couple to play the parents of Adrien and his sister played to perfection by Illeana Douglas.  Vera Farmiga plays Brody's love interest in such a way that you get the sense that she too has led a somewhat disoriented life.  Milla Jovovich, wow.  This is the first role I've seen her in where she actually speaks a lot and gets to sing.  She is remarkable as Brody's best friend Fanny...I'm sorry Fangora!  I had my mother watch this film with me and being Jewish, she loved it when Milla sang punk versions of Klezmer songs!The DVD is packed with wonderful features such as lessons on how to be a good ventriloquist with the help of Jeff Dunham, a cute mock featurette that shows Jeff teaching a class on Ventriloquism, commentary from Jeff and two of his own dummies, a Widescreen presentation of the film, and deleted scenes.

Rod Serling apparently didn't think so when he turned one into a raving psychopath in a memorable episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  In ""Dummy,"" the delightfully quirky comedy by writer/director Greg Pritikin, the dummy turns out to be just about the least creepy character in the film - and I mean that in the nicest way possible.Adrien Brody, in a film made prior to (but released after) his Oscar-winning triumph in ""The Pianist,"" stars as Steven Schoichet, a mild-mannered, socially backward man in his late 20's who still lives at home with his parents and his equally dysfunctional sister.  One day, Steven decides to purchase a ventriloquist's dummy, a move that finally gives him the courage to break out of his shell and pursue the woman of his dreams.Pritikin has come up with an extraordinary ensemble cast that includes, in addition to Brody, Illeana Douglas, as Steven's lovelorn, perpetually frustrated sister; Milla Jovovich, as Steven's foulmouthed wannabe punk rock star friend and companion; Jessica Walter as Steven's off-the-wall mother who figures she can keep her son happy if she perpetually feeds him sandwiches; and Ron Leibman as Steven's father who just wants to spend his time putting together model ships and who can't understand how he's ended up with two children so obviously devoid of purpose and direction in life.  Vera Farmiga is charming and winning as the unemployment counselor - perhaps the one ""uncertifiable"" character in the film - who opens her heart to both Steven and his dummy companion.Pritikin has taken some very simple material and woven it into a many-splendored tapestry, hitting just the right tone all the way through.  The film is wickedly funny one moment and touchingly romantic the next.  Yet, Pritikin never violates the uniquely quirky spirit of the premise he's established.  It is particularly fun watching Steven engage in long-running conversations with himself, using the dummy as a sounding board for working out his own insecurities and fears.Beautifully written, directed and acted, ""Dummy"" is one of the genuine, certified sleepers of the past several years.",4,an unanticipated delight,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,2198,"['anything', 'world', 'creepier', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'when', 'turned', 'one', 'raving', 'psychopath', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Dummy', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'writer/director', 'Greg', 'Pritikin', 'dummy', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'least', 'creepy', 'character', 'film', 'mean', 'nicest', 'way', 'possible.Adrien', 'Brody', 'film', 'made', 'prior', 'released', 'Oscar-winning', 'triumph', 'Pianist', 'Steven', 'Schoichet', 'mild-mannered', 'socially', 'backward', 'man', 'late', '20', 'who', 'still', 'home', 'parents', 'equally', 'dysfunctional', 'sister', 'One', 'day', 'Steven', 'purchase', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'move', 'finally', 'courage', 'break', 'shell', 'pursue', 'woman', 'dreams.Pritikin', 'come', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'addition', 'Brody', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Steven', 'lovelorn', 'perpetually', 'frustrated', 'sister', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Steven', 'foulmouthed', 'wannabe', 'punk', 'rock', 'star', 'friend', 'companion', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Steven', 'off-the-wall', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'son', 'happy', 'perpetually', 'sandwiches', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'Steven', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'spend', 'time', 'putting', 'together', 'model', 'ships', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'two', 'children', 'so', 'obviously', 'devoid', 'purpose', 'direction', 'life', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'charming', 'winning', 'unemployment', 'counselor', 'perhaps', 'one', 'uncertifiable', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'heart', 'Steven', 'dummy', 'companion.Pritikin', 'taken', 'very', 'simple', 'material', 'woven', 'many-splendored', 'tapestry', 'hitting', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'way', 'film', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'one', 'moment', 'touchingly', 'romantic', 'next', 'Pritikin', 'never', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'spirit', 'premise', 'established', 'particularly', 'fun', 'watching', 'Steven', 'engage', 'long-running', 'conversations', 'using', 'dummy', 'sounding', 'board', 'working', 'out', 'own', 'insecurities', 'fears.Beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'Dummy', 'one', 'genuine', 'certified', 'sleepers', 'past', 'several', 'years']",Dummy

Adrien Brody and Milla Jovovich have considerable talents.  Greg Pritikin, the director/screenwriter has since blamed a change of ownership in the distribution channels for its commercial demise.  I found it very grating in the first thirty minutes, then it grew on me briefly before descending into normal movie fantasyland.  What was so grating?  I think the director did not decide what he was doing, farce or lonely hearts finding each other or social satire, or the cliche version of standing up for oneself and then everything coming up roses.  Milla is very good as the highly emotional extrovert social misfit and she is mirrored by an exact opposite of a totally clamped down emotional-less Adrien Brody as a introverted social misfit.  However, both actors were pushed to extremes by the director, so the opening third seems unreal, and whatever affection you develop for the characters is balanced by a feeling of annoyance.  Likewise you are given an insight into the family background of both characters as motivation for their inability to function well...but it is so extreme, and cartoon-like it would be better as farce, except it is definitely not all that funny.  I think that is the main problem, pushing things in the direction of farce, and not making it all the way to funny, instead settling in a bog of  sentimentality.

A quirky comedy with an offbeat sense of humor it'll have you laughing so hard your stomach will hurt. I'm so glad I didn't miss this intelligent clever comedy. It's one of the best movies I've seen in years.Dummy follows the story of Steven, a shy late twenties man who lives with his dysfunctional parents and bitter sister. Fired from his dead-end job he decides to buy a ventriloquist's dummy and embark on his lifelong dream of becoming a ventriloquist. He goes down to the unemployment office and becomes attracted to his counselor Lorena on the first meeting. (I love how they're both wearing the same bland outfit; a wonderful comment on the stifling conformity of the workplace.) The dummy becomes an extension of Steven's personality and helps him overcome his shyness. With the help of his foul-mouthed tomboy friend Fangora he starts to pursue a romance with Lorena. Despite a series of blunders, (I love the scene where Fangora goes to the unemployment office. It's so funny it'll make you cry, ditto the crazy scene where he spray paints a thank-you note on her door) Steven manages to go on a few dates with Lorena. Just when things are about to get close, she breaks it off with Steven. He thinks it's his weirdness, but it's her own fears of failure in past relationships that cause the separation. At a Jewish wedding Fangora and Steven perform at, things reach a climax as he overcomes his shyness to win the woman he truly loves.This is a great movie; like another one of my favorite movies, How U Like Me Now it uses a simple story as a platform to develop complex multileveled characters. Each character in Dummy struggles to overcome a fear inside themselves and it's ironic that these inner struggles contrast the exterior personality they express. Steven is shy on the outside, but his dummy's alter ego is extremely confident. Fangora is a foul mouthed extrovert but is extremely withdrawn when confronted by her mother about her Jewish heritage. Lorena is a woman who is the picture of stability and secure on the outside but is extremely insecure. Steven's sister Heidi is a wedding planner who can't maintain a relationship. Steven's mother always comforts everyone with food because she can't express her emotions in a constructive manner. Steven's father spends most of his time making model ships of past wars but is afraid to confront the turmoil in his own home. Each of the characters with the exception of Steven's parents find true happiness when they embrace the inner parts of their personalities they have conflict with and pursue their dreams Steven finds happiness in his ventriloquism, Fangora when she embraces her Jewish heritage by performing traditional Jewish songs, Heidi when she sings at the reception and Lorena when she stands up to a former boyfriend.Director Greg Pritkin creates well-crafted film. He tells the stories of all these quirky offbeat characters beautifully. It's easy to identify with each of them and their struggles; being shy myself I could particularly relate to what Steven was going through in his life. Production values on Dummy are top notch. I especially love the cinematography; I felt like I was walking on those suburban streets. The screenplay is well written with some hilarious lines too good to spoil.The acting in this film is some of the best I've ever seen. Adrien Brody is in top form as Steven capturing his shyness (he even does his own ventriloquism) beautifully. Mila Jovovich gives the best performance of her career as Fangora. She steals all the scenes she's in; I wish she'd do more films like this instead of fanticrap like Resident Evil and Fifth Element. A few more quality films like Dummy would elevate her into the A-list where she belongs. Jessica Walter and Ron Leibman are hilarious as Steven's parents. Vera Farmiga gives a strong performace as Lorena. She plays the counselor with great depth expressing her fear and insecurities. Illeana Douglas is brilliant as Heidi. You feel all her frustrations but understand where she's coming from. Jared Harris is extra creepy as Heidi's greasy accountant ex-boyfriend.Dummy is a top ten Shawn James essential video.

She shines above all the rest and pretty much steals the show, though in saying that I must say too, that everyone in this film did a great job.This is a funny, touching film, and the added bonus is a pretty rippin' soundtrack.",5,Fabulous!,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1082,"['went', 'movie', 'really', 'caring', 'see', 'mainly', 'clowns', 'wooden', 'dummies', 'creep', 'am', 'glad', 'overlooked', 'general', 'revulsion', 'film.Adrien', 'Brody', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'loser', 'who', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'silent', 'knowing', 'grandmother', 'sister', 'who', 'played', 'Ileana', 'Douglas', 'only', 'friend', 'top', 'punk', 'rocker', 'played', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'follow', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'ventriloquist', 'process', 'counselor', 'unemployment', 'office.Other', 'side', 'plots', 'include', 'stalker', 'boyfriend', 'protagonist', 'sister', 'wedding', 'planner', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'singer', 'Jewish', 'wedding', 'trying', 'pull', 'together.As', 'Fangora', 'Jovovich', 'outstanding', 'type', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'rest', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'show', 'saying', 'must', 'say', 'too', 'everyone', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job.This', 'funny', 'touching', 'film', 'added', 'bonus', 'pretty', 'rippin', 'soundtrack']",Dummy
793605,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B00015HWX2,yaremar,"[1, 1]","In Greg Pritikin's refreshingly offbeat DUMMY, Adrien Brody (THE PIANIST) plays Steven, a milquetoast obsessed with the idea of becoming a professional ventriloquist. Although his career goal is derided by his sister (Illeana Douglas), herself an aspiring entertainer, and met with benign indifference from his self-absorbed parents (Jessica Walter, Ron Liebman), he gets moral support from his best friend Fannie (Milla Jovovich), an antisocial punk rocker, who also encourages Steven to romance a lonely employment counselor (Vera Farmiga).When comedies set out to be deliberately quirky, they often fall flat because the human element is ignored in favor of bizarre behavior and wild plot twists. DUMMY succeeds because it never forgets that it's basically a character-driven look at life among the dysfunctional. And though his lead characters skate along the edge of absurdity, writer-director Pritikin has the good sense to infuse them with a basic dignity that's rare in most modern comedy films. Adrien Brody strikes all the right notes as an introvert who ultimately finds his inner voice via his wooden partner, and his performance is matched by a uniformly excellent supporting cast. The usually glamorous Milla Jovovich is a standout in her scenes as a grungy rebel whose mood swings make her a foul-mouthed terror one minute and a sweetly compassionate companion the next.Producing a lot of smiles and some solid laughs, DUMMY is one smart comedy.",3,Smart humor,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1460,"['Greg', 'Pritikin', 'refreshingly', 'offbeat', 'DUMMY', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'THE', 'PIANIST', 'Steven', 'milquetoast', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'becoming', 'professional', 'ventriloquist', 'career', 'goal', 'derided', 'sister', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'aspiring', 'entertainer', 'met', 'benign', 'indifference', 'self-absorbed', 'parents', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Ron', 'Liebman', 'moral', 'support', 'best', 'friend', 'Fannie', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'antisocial', 'punk', 'rocker', 'who', 'also', 'Steven', 'romance', 'lonely', 'employment', 'counselor', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', '.When', 'comedies', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'deliberately', 'quirky', 'often', 'fall', 'flat', 'human', 'element', 'ignored', 'favor', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'wild', 'plot', 'twists', 'DUMMY', 'never', 'basically', 'character-driven', 'look', 'life', 'dysfunctional', 'lead', 'characters', 'skate', 'edge', 'absurdity', 'writer-director', 'Pritikin', 'good', 'sense', 'infuse', 'basic', 'dignity', 'rare', 'most', 'modern', 'comedy', 'films', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'right', 'notes', 'introvert', 'who', 'ultimately', 'inner', 'voice', 'wooden', 'partner', 'performance', 'matched', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'usually', 'glamorous', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'standout', 'scenes', 'grungy', 'rebel', 'mood', 'swings', 'make', 'foul-mouthed', 'terror', 'one', 'minute', 'sweetly', 'compassionate', 'companion', 'next.Producing', 'lot', 'smiles', 'solid', 'laughs', 'DUMMY', 'one', 'smart', 'comedy']",Dummy
