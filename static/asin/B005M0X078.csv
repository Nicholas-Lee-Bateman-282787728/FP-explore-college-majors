Carrozza""","[2, 3]","I have seen the Phantom several times on Broadway, and this was by far the must superb performance I have ever seen. I don't agree with some of the reviewers who complained about camera angles and shots - I thought they were magnificent. My only disappointment was that they didn't have the chandelier fall. I was a little unimpressed with the portrayal of Raoul, as I thought he came across a bit cocky and not sympathetic to Christine, but his singing was fantastic. Andre was a little weak. But Christine, the Phantom, the costumes, the staging, the sound, magnificent!! This does Blu Ray justice, and with my Bose sound system, I ended by simply saying, ""WOW!""",5,Fantastic!,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,664,"['have', 'seen', 'Phantom', 'several', 'times', 'Broadway', 'was', 'far', 'must', 'superb', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'complained', 'camera', 'angles', 'shots', 'thought', 'were', 'magnificent', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chandelier', 'fall', 'was', 'little', 'unimpressed', 'portrayal', 'Raoul', 'thought', 'came', 'bit', 'cocky', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'Christine', 'singing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Andre', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'costumes', 'staging', 'sound', 'magnificent', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'justice', 'Bose', 'sound', 'system', 'ended', 'simply', 'saying', 'WOW']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall
1494015,A3300SFI0JF7OM,B005M0X078,Adamtron,"[33, 46]","At long last, The Phantom of the Opera musical available on dvd...PROS:Phantom of the Opera for the first time on blu-ray ever!The vocals are greatThe acting is excellent and I felt it brought out the emotion of the production.The close ups allow you to see details on the props and costumes that you normally could not see otherwise.  The costumes look amazing in high definition and you can see the gemstones sparkling in the lightThe cinematography is good with multiple (including overhead) camera angles.CONS:The Royal Albert Hall was not the best place for this.  After seeing this, I think they should have chose Las Vegas (which has a theatre custom-built specifically for POTO and a breathtaking chandelier) instead.During the opening you do not see dramatic curtains pulling up and sliding away to reveal the d&eacute;cor and statues.The rise of the chandelier during the overture does not happen.  The chandelier is fixed to the ceiling.There is no elephant during HannibalThe scene where Christine sees a mannequin in a wedding dress and faints was altered.  Instead, she faints while ""under the spell"" of Phantom.The ""bringing down"" of the chandelier doesn't happen, again because it's fixed to the ceiling.When the Phantom appears during Masquerade, he does not walk menacingly down the stairs in time to the music.  He appears standing still in a doorway.  It just doesn't have the same impact.When Christine sees Phantom in the graveyard, he does not have the cane that shoots fire down upon Raul.  Instead, he waves his hands as flames pop up from the stage.Many backdrops and props were replaced with digital screens which may have looked alright if you were in the audience but unfortunately look terrible shot in HD.  During the close ups, the actors look as if they are performing in a ""digitized world"" with large round pixels (like you see on digital billboards) behind them.  This clash of Paris Opera House with 2012 digital screens is very distracting.Final verdict:This is as good as you're going to get for now and definitely worth owning for any POTO fan or for anyone that is not able to buy a ticket to see it live.  However, with everything that's lacking, I'm hoping another performance more true to the original staging gets released sometime in the future.",3,"Worth owning, but there's room for improvement",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,2291,"['long', 'last', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'musical', 'available', 'dvd', 'PROS', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'first', 'time', 'blu-ray', 'ever', 'vocals', 'are', 'greatThe', 'acting', 'excellent', 'felt', 'brought', 'out', 'emotion', 'production.The', 'close', 'ups', 'allow', 'see', 'details', 'props', 'costumes', 'normally', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'otherwise', 'costumes', 'look', 'amazing', 'high', 'definition', 'can', 'see', 'gemstones', 'sparkling', 'lightThe', 'cinematography', 'good', 'multiple', 'including', 'overhead', 'camera', 'angles.CONS', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'place', 'seeing', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'chose', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'theatre', 'custom-built', 'specifically', 'POTO', 'breathtaking', 'chandelier', 'instead.During', 'opening', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'dramatic', 'curtains', 'pulling', 'up', 'sliding', 'away', 'reveal', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'statues.The', 'rise', 'chandelier', 'overture', 'not', 'happen', 'chandelier', 'fixed', 'ceiling.There', 'elephant', 'HannibalThe', 'scene', 'where', 'Christine', 'mannequin', 'wedding', 'dress', 'faints', 'was', 'altered', 'Instead', 'spell', 'Phantom.The', 'bringing', 'down', 'chandelier', ""n't"", 'happen', 'again', 'fixed', 'ceiling.When', 'Phantom', 'Masquerade', 'not', 'walk', 'menacingly', 'down', 'stairs', 'time', 'music', 'standing', 'still', 'doorway', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'impact.When', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'graveyard', 'not', 'have', 'cane', 'fire', 'down', 'upon', 'Raul', 'Instead', 'hands', 'flames', 'pop', 'up', 'stage.Many', 'backdrops', 'props', 'were', 'replaced', 'digital', 'screens', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'alright', 'were', 'audience', 'unfortunately', 'look', 'terrible', 'shot', 'HD', 'close', 'ups', 'actors', 'look', 'are', 'performing', 'digitized', 'world', 'large', 'round', 'pixels', 'see', 'digital', 'billboards', 'clash', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', '2012', 'digital', 'screens', 'very', 'distracting.Final', 'verdict', 'as', 'good', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'now', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'POTO', 'fan', 'anyone', 'not', 'able', 'buy', 'ticket', 'see', 'live', 'However', 'everything', 'lacking', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'performance', 'more', 'true', 'original', 'staging', 'released', 'sometime', 'future']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

I loved it so much I wanted to go back and see it every time they showed it, but was busy for all of the other showings.  I was so excited to see that they have it available to purchase now.  This was the first time I had seen the full stage version of the show, however I am very familiar with the music.  The cast did a wonderful job, and in the end Andrew Lloyd Weber gave a speech and introduced the original cast and company.  Sarah Brightman performed Phantom of the Opera with 4 former phantoms who then sang and beautiful rendition of Music of the Night for which they were joined by the Phantom from that nights performance.  In my opinion this is Andrew Lloyd Weber's greatest work, and it is no mystery that it has lasted 25 years.

1494019,AY8JV2D8A80EK,B005M0X078,Amazon Customer,"[706, 719]","I just got back from watching this exact performance at my local theatre, and I must admit, I am most impressed.I was frightened that this might not be a staging at all, but more along the lines of a ""concert in costume"" much like the dissapointment I felt when I saw the Les Miserable's concert on Public TV.Fear not.  This production is pretty dead on to the staging that appears in the shows that I have watched live, and considering this was filmed ""live"" and simulcast, it is truly a sight to behold.While this performance can't even compare to ""being there"" it is far removed than the sterile affair put on the screen by Joel Schumaker.  Don't get me wrong.  There is plenty of things I like about the movie, (like the spine tingling opening sequence, or the red hot sexuality of Point of No Return).  But this by far is the most accurate ""filming"" I have seen of any ALW production.Unlike Joseph, JC Superstar and CATS, which were ""staged"" recordings specifically for video, with all the ""cuts"" that go with it, This is a live filming that was simulcast live around the world on Oct 2, 2011 and ran on limited encore performances in movie theatres for the next few days.  There are no ""best performances"" or ""second chances"".  We get what was actually presented to the audience on Oct 2, and that alone is worth the price of admission.Due to the height of the roof of the Royal Albert Hall and either logistics or safety concerns revolving around hurling a Chandalier from such a dizzying height, suffice it to say, the chandalier does not crash to the stage at the end of Act 1, nor does it ""float"" from the stage in it's glory during the overture.  Instead, the tarp is removed during the overture, and fireworks accompany the chandeliers destruction at the end of Act 1.  This is sure to be a bit of a disappointment to most Phantom fans, and if you need to experience a crashing chandalier, you will have to go to one of the live performances currently touring around the world.  On the plus side there are quite a few shots of the show taken ""throguh"" the chandelier onto the stage below, which gives you the feeling that you are the phantom, spying at the action below from top of the chandelier.  It's not as dramatic, but they did what they could and it's hard to fault them for something that was probably completely out of their control.The production also makes extensive use of LED screens as backdrops much like was done in Love Never Dies.  This can is be both effective and a bit disconcerting.  One example is the backdrop of Andre and Fermin's office, which is setup to look like a wall with opera posters posted on it.  From a distance, these work fine.  However, some of the cameras are really close to the stage and causes this effect to pixelate greatly which takes away some of the suspension of disbelief.The use of LED screens is also used to mimic Christines Mirror during her Angel of Music number in which Christine approaches the mirror with the Phantoms face singing in the upper right corner of the mirror.  Towards the end, the screen simply slides away to review the Phantom walking towards her with the fog rolling at his feet.Another different use of the screens is during ""Notes"" when the phantom is reading how Christine is to star in 'Il Muto, we see handwriting appearing as well as the phantom singing his instructions on how Christine is to be granted the role of the dutchess while Carlotta plays the pageboy.  One cool effect that the LED screens provided was during the end of Think of Me, Christine faces the rear of the stage, and the actual applause from the live audience is projected on the rear screens giving the audience the feeling that they are behind Christine and their own reaction is the reaction of the ""audience"" who just watched her aria from Hannibal.  It's hard to describe but a cool efect.It's also fair to note that these ""screens"" were necessary given the sheer size of the arena, and in the vastness of the RAH, some consideration had to be made to those in the nosebleed seats, so we see some scenes where the Phantom is projected on the real wall so that the paying customer in the back can better see the action.It's just that they lose much of their effectiveness when filmed.Speaking of filming, the camera work is stunning.  Thanks to HD and the extreme closeup we fully see the emotional range the Phantom shows at his love/hate relationship with Christine.  Some might say we see too much as I was distracted by wrinkles in the Phantoms facial prostesis where it was peeling from his neckline.  Proof positive that this was shot live.The performances from the cast were spot on, and it's amazing how I find different parts of the musical which resonate with me depending on the production.In the live stage productions I have seen, the ""Phantom of The Opera/Music of the Night"" sequence always sent shivers down my spine.  The motion picture's rendition of ""Past the Point of No Return"" has a sexual tension and animal magnetism not experienced on any stage performance I have seen.  The stand out number for me in this version clearly was ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.""  This has never been a favorite number of mine until now.  Sierra Boggess really sells that performance and my mouth was on the floor when it was over.The Phantom in this production is also more believable.  Ramin Karimloo brings out an anquished performance of a ""monster"" with the heart of an ""artist"".  His makeup is not over the top but grotesque enough to give someone pause.  My biggest beef about the motion picture is that no woman in her right mind would have rejected Gerard Butler's Phantom.  Even with his ""hideous"" makeup he was way too pretty.  A slight rash, a droopy eye and a swollen lip?  Really?  I've seen uglier people at Wal-Mart.  But Karimloo's Phantom is sufficiently hideous.  You sense the bravery it took Christine to kiss him in the final scene and that courage is not lost on the Phantom, which leads to his change of heart.One suprising highlight was the role of Carlotta.  In all the past performances, Carlotta was portrayed in Caricature.  Nowehre is this more apparant than in Minnie Drivers over the top performance in the film.  Here, Carlotta is almost a sympathetic character.  She clearly fears not only the Phantom, but also the rise of this ""precious little Ingenue"".  She clearly see's Christine as a threat to her dominance at the Opera and we see a true human side to her as portrayed by her fear when the piano starts playing by itself during the rehersal for Don Juan Triumphant.  In the past Carlotta had always been a throwaway part, but in this performance it is done with an authenticity that I have never before seen.Overall, the show is brilliant and I am ecstatic that it will be coming to DVD/Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately Phantom is no longer touring in North America, so my chances to see it live require a trip to New York, or Las Vegas to see the ""truncated"" version.  And if my children never have the opportunity to see it live, at least they can appreciate this version.  While it is nowhere close to experiencing Phantom for yourself, it is definitely more authentic than the movie, and slight staging differences aside, is as accurate a staging of the original show as could be done in the venue that it was pressented.One final bonus is the appearance on stage of the surviving Orignal London Cast including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  Unfortunately Michael does no singing, but we do get two numbers with Sarah and four previous phantoms.  The Phantoms are outstanding, but clearly Sarah's voice lacks the punch it had 25 years ago.  This is not a criticism but just a fact of growing older.  It was still nice to see the original production team on stage.While it seems I have levied quite a few criticisms in this review, it is simply there to let you know what you are getting before you buy.  The performance was outstanding and much more accurate to the original show than the movie.  If you are a fan of the original show, you will find plenty to like here.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will see different nuances than was presented by the film.Anyway, however you look at it.  At it's core, it is still Phantom, and a mighty fine one at that.  A must buy for anyone who loves this show, and anyone who has yet to see it performed on stage.",4,The closest thing to being at a live production,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,8385,"['just', 'got',

1494020,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B005M0X078,Amber MacDonald,"[0, 0]","Isn't it wonderful that this production can still be seen in all of its former glory? The story has become widely known for its whimsical, yet serious, mood-setting, storytelling. I find it to be almost Shakespearean in its plot, what with all of the madness and tragedy, you will laugh, cry, at first despise, and finally cheer for the phantom while watching this fabulous performance of the most successful theater production of all time. This story is one that can not be missed. There is a reason that it has grossed over 5 billion dollars in twenty five years, this performance (as seen at the Royal Albert Hall) delivers that reason in the form of an involved and experienced cast. I have always loved this story, and I finally had the chance to share it with my family. It is a classic that is most synonymous with good taste. Followers of theater probably have already picked this up, anyone who likes a good story should do the same. To not pick it up, would be missing out on perhaps the most important contribution to theater in its history.",5,The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1052,"[""n't"", 'wonderful', 'production', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'former', 'glory', 'story', 'become', 'widely', 'known', 'whimsical', 'yet', 'serious', 'mood-setting', 'storytelling', 'find', 'be', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'plot', 'what', 'madness', 'tragedy', 'will', 'laugh', 'cry', 'first', 'despise', 'finally', 'cheer', 'phantom', 'watching', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'most', 'successful', 'theater', 'production', 'time', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'reason', 'grossed', '5', 'billion', 'dollars', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'performance', 'seen', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'reason', 'form', 'involved', 'experienced', 'cast', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'story', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'share', 'family', 'classic', 'most', 'synonymous', 'good', 'taste', 'Followers', 'theater', 'probably', 'have', 'already', 'picked', 'up', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'should', 'do', 'same', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'contribution', 'theater', 'history']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall
1494021,AY4R8JIZO1LBH,B005M0X078,A music fan,"[3, 3]","Two words to describe this production: holy crap!I've been a Phantom fan (or is it phan?) ever since I saw the show in Los Angeles with Michael Crawford in 1990.  Since that performance, I have seen it several more times, but I have yet to see one that was able to match it in quality and emotion.  Well my friends, the search is over.  In sports, there is an old saying that athletes should leave it all out on the field.  This performance is the theatrical equivalent of leaving it all out on the field.Let me start off with the casting.  To quote the Phantom, it is, in a word, ideal.  Ramin Karimloo is clearly one of the stage stars of this decade and is an inspired choice to play the Phantom.  His presence on stage might have been enough, but his booming, brooding voice really makes the character come alive.  There is an apocryphal story that when Karimloo first saw a performance of Phantom as a teenager, he bet his friends that one day he would play the Phantom.  Not only did that come true, but it's even all the more amazing considering he has never had any formal vocal training.  Sierra Boggess is tremendous as Christine.  You can seriously feel her anguish oozing off the screen.  Beautiful voice, and every word comes through nicely.  Raoul is always a troublesome character to cast.  For some reason, the actors who typically play him come off as kind of wussy and stiff.  But not here.  The producers chose Hadley Fraser, a West End veteran, but one who has never played Raoul.  His Raoul is the first one to actually have a spine and come off as forceful and the protector that Christine seeks.  In the final scene, Fraser looks ready to throw down with the Phantom.  And he also has a great voice to boot.  I will say this, though: he did wear a bit too much eye make-up for my taste. =DAnother thing that makes this production work so well is that all of the performers really give their all.  You can feel and see the emotions of the characters so much more clearly than in any normal stage production thanks to the multiple camera angles used.  By the end of the show, you feel just as breathless as the actors.  You can really see them working on stage - you can see the sweat running down their faces from the hot stage lights and the makeup starting to run a bit.  That's how you know it's live. Some of the camera work could have been better, but overall they did a good job capturing a live performance with a slightly modified set to accommodate the limitations at Royal Albert Hall.  The lighting could also have been improved slightly, but I don't feel it really detracted from the overall show.A cool bonus at the end of the performance is the appearance of the original London cast, including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  Brightman sang, but Crawford curiously did not.  Then, four previous Phantoms appeared on stage - Anthony Warlow, John Owen Jones, Colm Wilkinson, and Peter Joback - and sang a duet with Brightman and then alternated on ""Music of the Night.""  Really amazing stuff, although I think it was wrong to leave out Howard McGillin from that group, since he played the Phantom more than anyone in history.All in all, this video is ten times better than the horrendous movie version that came out all those years ago with Gerard Butler.",5,Breathtaking!,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,3297,"['Two', 'words', 'describe', 'production', 'holy', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Phantom', 'fan', 'ever', 'saw', 'show', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Michael', 'Crawford', '1990', 'performance', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'one', 'was', 'able', 'match', 'quality', 'emotion', 'Well', 'friends', 'search', 'over', 'sports', 'old', 'saying', 'should', 'leave', 'out', 'field', 'performance', 'theatrical', 'equivalent', 'leaving', 'out', 'field.Let', 'start', 'off', 'casting', 'quote', 'Phantom', 'word', 'ideal', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'clearly', 'one', 'stage', 'stars', 'decade', 'inspired', 'choice', 'play', 'Phantom', 'presence', 'stage', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'booming', 'brooding', 'voice', 'really', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'apocryphal', 'story', 'when', 'Karimloo', 'first', 'saw', 'performance', 'Phantom', 'teenager', 'bet', 'friends', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'play', 'Phantom', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'come', 'true', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'considering', 'never', 'had', 'formal', 'vocal', 'training', 'Sierra', 'Boggess', 'tremendous', 'Christine', 'can', 'seriously', 'feel', 'anguish', 'oozing', 'screen', 'Beautiful', 'voice', 'word', 'through', 'nicely', 'Raoul', 'always', 'troublesome', 'character', 'cast', 'reason', 'actors', 'who', 'typically', 'play', 'come', 'off', 'kind', 'wussy', 'stiff', 'not', 'here', 'producers', 'chose', 'Hadley', 'Fraser', 'West', 'End', 'veteran', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'played', 'Raoul', 'Raoul', 'first', 'one', 'actually', 'have', 'spine', 'come', 'off', 'forceful', 'protector', 'Christine', 'final', 'scene', 'Fraser', 'ready', 'throw', 'down', 'Phantom', 'also', 'great', 'voice', 'boot', 'will', 'say', 'did', 'wear', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'eye', 'make-up', 'taste', 'thing', 'production', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'performers', 'really', 'give', 'can', 'feel', 'see', 'emotions', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'normal', 'stage', 'production', 'thanks', 'multiple', 'camera', 'angles', 'used', 'end', 'show', 'feel', 'just', 'as', 'breathless', 'actors', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'working', 'stage', 'can', 'see', 'sweat', 'running', 'down', 'hot', 'stage', 'lights', 'makeup', 'starting', 'run', 'bit', 'how', 'know', 'live', 'camera', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'overall', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'live', 'performance', 'slightly', 'modified', 'set', 'accommodate', 'limitations', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'lighting', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'slightly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'detracted', 'overall', 'show.A', 'cool', 'bonus', 'end', 'performance', 'appearance', 'original', 'London', 'cast', 'including', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Brightman', 'sang', 'Crawford', 'curiously', 'did', 'not', 'Then', 'four', 'previous', 'Phantoms', 'appeared', 'stage', 'Anthony', 'Warlow', 'John', 'Owen', 'Jones', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'Peter', 'Joback', 'sang', 'duet', 'Brightman', 'then', 'alternated', 'Music', 'Night', 'Really', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'think', 'was', 'wrong', 'leave', 'out', 'Howard', 'McGillin', 'group', 'played', 'Phantom', 'more', 'anyone', 'history.All', 'video', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'horrendous', 'movie', 'version', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'Gerard', 'Butler']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

1494040,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B005M0X078,Byron Kolln,"[6, 6]","I can say, without uncertainty, that this is ""Phantom"" for the ages.  For those who've long wished for a filmed record of the stage show, this is as close as we'll ever get.  Filmed live at the glorious Royal Albert Hall for a special three-performance 25th Anniversary event in October 2011, Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA sparkles like never before, with 100 cast members, and a 100-piece orchestra.I now completely understand why Lloyd Webber personally selected Sierra Boggess and Ramin  Karimloo (the original London leads of his sequel ""Love Never Dies"", which closed a few weeks before the 25th Anniversary of PHANTOM) to once again play Christine and the Phantom.  Their chemistry is like nothing else I've ever witnessed.  And only by playing opposite each other for quite some time can a set of Christine/Phantom's ever hope to match it.  The stage literally quivers when the pair first comes together, and by the time they've performed their erotic Act 2 duet ""The Point of No Return"", let's just say that fireworks wouldn't do them justice.  Ms Boggess will particularly astound you with her incredible acting performance as Christine - very rarely have I encountered such a full-blooded Christine in the many times I've seen the show onstage.There are naturally some shortcomings and restrictions in performing the full PHANTOM in a concert hall space.  Gone are some of the more spectacular effects (the famous chandelier no longer rises or falls but ""explodes"" at the climax of Act 1 with the aid of some pyrotechnic magic).  LED background projections provide the various scene changes; however the entire thing is closely modelled after the original Maria Bjornson designs - right down to the golden  proscenium arch.  PHANTOM purists will appreciate the lengths that have been taken to present the show in its signature look.The rest of the principals have all been associated with their PHANTOM roles in the past, with the exception being Hadley Fraser as Raoul.  Fraser's debut as Raoul is amongst the finest I've witnessed, taking who can be a rather prissy one-dimensional hero to a man who is a more than worthy adversary for the Phantom.Liz Robertson is Madame Giry (in addition to the London production she has also played Giry in ""Love Never Dies""), and the opera house managers are played by Barry James and Gareth Snook.  Wendy Ferguson (one of the best Carlotta's from PHANTOM's London run) came in at the last minute to replace an actual opera singer who had been cast as Carlotta, but who had fallen ill.  Ferguson's Carlotta is a much more sympathetic character than what is usually played, and she is truly deserving of having her performance finally documented here.  Wynne Evans plays Piangi, whilst international ballet star Sergei Polunin dances the Slave Master in ""Hannibal"" as well as the lead role in the ""Il Muto"" ballet.More surprises are revealed during the ""Grand Finale"" as Andrew Lloyd Webber brings Michael Crawford, the surviving original London cast members and the creative team onstage for a well-deserved ovation.  Sarah Brightman, backed by three of the best past Phantom's - Colm Wilkinson (Canada), Anthony Warlow (Australia) and John Owen-Jones (London) in addition to London's next Phantom, Peter Joback, then sing the Title Song as well as ""Music of the Night"".If you have been touched by the magic of PHANTOM you'll need to grab a copy of this.

1494048,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B005M0X078,Charity Bishop,"[1, 2]","Once in a lifetime, something incredible comes along. One of those things is Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. Loosely inspired by the French novel by Gaston Leroux, it follows the tragic story of a man forced by his deformity to dwell beneath the Paris Opera House, and the woman he loves.The Opera House has seen its share of misfortunes, so many in fact that the current manager has decided to retire - to New South Whales. He gladly turns over his many former responsibilities, including a diva in the form of Carlotta (Wendy Ferguson), her tag-along fellow performer and friend Piangi (Wynne Evans), and of course an Opera Ghost... one that demands Box Five be kept empty for his use, and also a salary of 1500 francs a month. When Carlotta refuses to go on after an upsetting backstage incident, the performance is turned over to the young and inexperienced Christine Daee (Sierra Boggess), whose voice catches the attention of a former childhood sweetheart, and the newest patron of the arts, Raoul de Chany (Hadley Fraser).What neither the new managers nor Raoul know is that the ballet dancer turned singer Christine is being trained in the musical arts by a mysterious man that lives beneath the Opera House. Known to her as the Angel of Music, to the managers as the Opera Ghost, and to the empirical ballet mistress Madame Giry (Liz Robertson) as the Phantom of the Opera, he will do anything in his power to see to it that Christine remains on stage, that she continues to pursue her education beneath his influence, and that Raoul will not win over her heart... even if it leads to his own destruction.The only true way to experience this magnificent musical is live, but this 25th anniversary production is the next best thing. Its incredible performances outshine the film's while still maintaining the integrity and structure of the stage production. Quibbles have been made over the cast but in my opinion the pairing up of Sierra Boggess, Ramin Karimloo, and Hadley Fraser is perfection. Ramin has the stage presence needed to convey the total control Erik (the Phantom) has over Christine. His delivery of certain lines is unique and there is such heart-wrenching agony in his final moments that I defy you not to be in tears. Sierra meanwhile is the finest Christine I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. Her facial expressions, her innocent wonder, and her utter heartache are mesmerizing. Hadley meanwhile gives the un-empathetic (and at times downright foolish) Raoul a gravity and strength that well offsets his considerably more formidable co-characters.Veterans of the original production will notice some changes here and there - lyrics have been altered, and the infamous mannequin is missing - but none of it intrudes on the flow and in some instances strengthens it. The stage is limited in the sense that crashing the chandelier was not possible and much of the background is made up of enormous screens, but it's easy to become accustomed to them and there are times (particularly when the Phantom is sending notes) that it actually assists in the narrative style. On occasion, the camera sweeps across the stage behind the audience but for the most part we forget it is live (other than the well-deserved applause) until the end, when the original cast and four of the most famous Phantoms take the stage. That Michael Crawford does not sing is unfortunate... but that John Owen Jones, Anthony Warlow, Colm Wilkinson, and Sarah Brightman do is glorious.The costumes are lovely, and if you have never seen the production live it will be an eye-opening glimpse of the cleverness that goes into transitioning between scenes on stage (including costume changes!). If you have never experienced The Phantom of the Opera, or have never seen any performance of it other than the film, rent this, or better yet, buy it.

Well, if I'm being honest, I actually turned slightly to my right and opened my laptop...THEN I ordered the Blu-ray!I can't say I've had a lot of experience with the Phantom of the Opera musical. I'm old enough to remember when the show first opened in the 80's. So, I also remember seeing Michael Crawford's performance of ""Music of the Night"" from highlights and award show appearances. Even as a teenager (showing my age yet?) I was intrigued and would like to have seen the show. However, I certainly didn't have the means to do so back then.Unfortunately, I must admit my first experience finally watching the production was from the Joel Schumacher movie. It's a handsome production. I thought Emma Rossum was good and most of the cast decent. But something was just ""off"" about the whole thing...besides Gerard Butler's key!Okay, I confess Butler wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. But that's the problem. Whoever plays the Phantom shouldn't be ""better"" than expected. He should be pretty darn awesome, right? Is it just me?So, back to a couple of weeks ago now, I realized at the last moment PBS was re-playing the 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom of the Opera. I had nothing better to do that night and I was ready to watch it. Frankly, some nights I might not be in the mood for a 3 hour plus musical.Thank goodness I was in the mood that Sunday night.This is impressively filmed at London's Royal Albert Hall. It's a eye popping spectacle and all the performances are fantastic. I would say ""perfect"" but I'm not some highfalutin expert on the subject of musicals. I do know what I like, however. And I love everything about this production. But I want to gush about the two leads, in particular.I immediately developed a crush on Sierra Boggess. She's beautiful, an incredible singer and a fine actress. The way she looks adoringly at our title character makes one understand why the Phantom falls hard for her. There's a moment where her Christine is starring in a role on stage, playing with an apple. I don't know quite how to put this but...she's seductive, yet innocent at the same time. It's kinda hot is what I'm saying. And, yes, her performance of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is a showstopper!To really make this work, you have to have the right actor as the Phantom. Ramin Karimloo is just awesome. The first thing you notice is the voice. Because we're not really introduced to him until after we hear him sing. I've heard him called a ""limitless tenor"" and I guess that's a fact. Man, can that guy sing! I supposed one could make a case that the Phantom's voice should be higher and creepier, but a case can also be made that he should be limitless. The Phantom is, after all, a musical genius who teaches Christine how to perfect her singing voice. Between Karimloo's vocal range and his inherent good looks, you can see his Phantom being a hugely successful entertainer if not for his facial deformities. This merely adds to his tragedy. The actor's halfway hidden handsomeness also allows us to buy into Christine's attraction to the Phantom. Sure, she's drawn to his hypnotic music, but it also helps us if we can actually imagine her being with the man behind the mask.But, like Boggess, Karimloo brings more to his role than charisma and an out-of-this-world voice. I was won over by him pretty early on. I thought he really nailed the famous ""Music of the Night"" scene in his lair. He also adds a vulnerability I didn't quite expect early on. While I was pleasantly impressed by him in those early scenes, it wasn't until his appearance in the ""All I Ask of You"" scene that I fully realized Karimloo's greatness in this role. The Phantom has just witnessed his beloved Christine with her childhood friend Raoul declaring their love for each other. Our Phantom is absolutely crushed by this. He's tearful, shaky, muttering to himself. He even tries in vain to cover his ears, still hearing the two lovers' voices singing...before exploding with vengeance.I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because there's something about the actor's take on the title character that I really identify and sympathize with. He totally breaks my heart at that moment. It's a special performance, along with Boggess, that makes the finale all the more devastating.The video and audio of the Blu-ray is incredible. The production was shot in HD so it's truly sharp and spectacular. Also the encores at the end in which we see former Phantoms singing together is a real treat. We also get a nice reunion with the original stars Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.But all that is icing on the cake. This is a truly wonderful experience thanks to the gorgeous production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's creative team, and especially the moving performances of Boggess and Karimloo.",5,I get the love

I've seen the stage production live 3 times, I read Gaston Leroux's novel, I read Susan Kay's novel, I have the original Broadway cast recording memorized, and when the movie came out in 2004, I was utterly disappointed at what a lousy hack job it was. Living in Hickville, Florida means that the live production doesn't come around very often, and I was hoping the movie would be a suitable substitution. It definitely wasn't -- but THIS IS!!I thought that this was something like Les Mis in Concert -- the performers are in costume and there is some staging, and that's it. This is actually a recording of the entire musical from start to finish. There are different camera angles and occasional video editing effects to spice it up. Otherwise, this is like sitting in the orchestra section on opening night.All of the cast members are phenomenal. One of the biggest problems with the movie is that the words were there, but there was no emotion. Not so in this production. I honestly think that the roles of the Phantom and Christine are among the most difficult Broadway roles to perform well, not only because of the range and other vocal demands, but because of the huge range of emotions that each has to take on in a 2 1/2 hour period. Both performers were absolutely phenomenal in bringing their characters to life.There are two scenes that have huge significance to me: Music of the Night, and the graveyard scene. I suffered through Butler's performance of MotN once, and only once. I refuse to ever sit through it again because of how bad it was. Ramin Karimloo not only has a seductive, velvet-like voice, but he also portrays the internal struggle of the Phantom entirely through his subtle actions and facial expressions. He doesn't just stand stiffly and stare at Christine. Now, the graveyard scene has been botched both in the movie and in the theater. ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is hugely personal to me, because I lost my father when I was 9. I know what it feels like to stand at my father's grave and want to move on but be afraid of letting go. I absolutely hate when actresses just stand there with no emotion except a sullen pout and maybe just walk around. At the end of the song, you can see that Sierra Boggess actually has tears in her eyes. She gives the song all of the fear, the anger, the desperation, and the hope that it is meant to have. During ""Wandering Child,"" there is so much intensity between the Phantom, Raoul, and Christine. I hate when directors cut it down to a duet and the harmony from Raoul's part is missing. I was thrilled to see this song performed in all its glory.The icing on the cake is the grand finale. I won't spoil it, because that was a wonderful surprise for me, but don't turn off the DVD player after the bows. :)",5,I've been waiting for this since I was 14!!,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,2838,"['have', 'been', 'love', 'Phantom', 'was', '14', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stage', 'production', 'live', '3', 'times', 'read', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'novel', 'read', 'Susan', 'Kay', 'novel', 'have', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'recording', 'memorized', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'was', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'what', 'lousy', 'hack', 'job', 'was', 'Living', 'Hickville', 'Florida', 'live', 'production', ""n't"", 'come', 'around', 'very', 'often', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'substitution', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'THIS', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'Les', 'Mis', 'Concert', 'performers', 'are', 'costume', 'staging', 'actually', 'recording', 'entire', 'musical', 'start', 'finish', 'are', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'occasional', 'video', 'editing', 'effects', 'spice', 'up', 'Otherwise', 'sitting', 'orchestra', 'section', 'opening', 'night.All', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'words', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'emotion', 'Not', 'so', 'production', 'honestly', 'think', 'roles', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'are', 'most', 'difficult', 'Broadway', 'roles', 'perform', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'range', 'other', 'vocal', 'demands', 'huge', 'range', 'emotions', 'take', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'period', 'performers', 'were', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'bringing', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'have', 'huge', 'significance', 'Music', 'Night', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'suffered', 'Butler', 'performance', 'MotN', 'once', 'only', 'once', 'refuse', 'ever', 'sit', 'again', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'not', 'only', 'seductive', 'velvet-like', 'voice', 'also', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Phantom', 'entirely', 'subtle', 'actions', 'facial', 'expressions', ""n't"", 'just', 'stand', 'stiffly', 'stare', 'Christine', 'Now', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'been', 'botched', 'movie', 'theater', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'hugely', 'personal', 'lost', 'father', 'when', 'was', '9', 'know', 'what', 'stand', 'father', 'grave', 'want', 'move', 'be', 'afraid', 'letting', 'go', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'when', 'actresses', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'emotion', 'sullen', 'pout', 'maybe', 'just', 'walk', 'around', 'end', 'song', 'can', 'see', 'Sierra', 'Boggess', 'actually', 'tears', 'eyes', 'song', 'fear', 'anger', 'desperation', 'hope', 'meant', 'have', 'Wandering', 'Child', 'so', 'much', 'intensity', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'Christine', 'hate', 'when', 'directors', 'cut', 'down', 'duet', 'harmony', 'Raoul', 'part', 'missing', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'song', 'performed', 'glory.The', 'icing', 'cake', 'grand', 'finale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'bows']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

Lane,"[1, 1]","First off, there is nothing that compares to the live production, sounds, depth, smells and that incredible sense of community, however, this release was terrific, and on a large widescreen (as well as the sensationl camerawork) I felt as if I had a special box (Box 5!) that cast me right there on-stage.I saw this production, maybe twelve years ago at the Murat here in Indy along with a young lady for whom I had even gotten the requisite rose (it helps to know the play you're going to see) and I still remember the pageantry and spectacle that is The Phantom of the Opera. I still have my playbill and the nifty color album that came with it.When I was in junior high school (a little bit back in time) I saw the 1925 silent version with legendary Lon Chaney Sr. and dressed up as the Phantom that Halloween. I have all of the primary versions that followed (1943 with Claude Rains, 1962 with Herbert Lom, 1983 with Maximilian Schell and Jane Seymour, 1989 with Robert Englund and Jill Schoelen, 1998 with Julian Sands and Asia Argento and 2004 with Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, which was the movie based off of this play).The cinematography is more than an equal to the choreography not only on this DVD but also on this 2011 production, and, of course, since this is a stage play in a beautiful auditorium the lighting and harmonics are clarion fantastique. As I've already said, this was awesome to watch.Ramin Karimloo's Phantom was painful to behold, and that was a great thing; his voice resonated from my TV, making me want to look around and see if he were sitting next to me. Not since the last Alice Cooper concert DVD have I felt as if I were right there enjoying the live performance. Universal did good!Sierra Boggess's beauty rivals that fabulous voice of hers; her rendition of Christine was spot-on and even this burly guy was brought to tears (got something in my eye, dangit!) as she wept her farewell to the Phantom.Lovely, phenomenal and cool beans, says me, just wow!",5,The Phantom is in my mind...,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1995,"['First', 'off', 'nothing', 'live', 'production', 'depth', 'smells', 'incredible', 'sense', 'community', 'however', 'release', 'was', 'terrific', 'large', 'widescreen', 'as', 'well', 'sensationl', 'camerawork', 'felt', 'had', 'special', 'box', 'Box', '5', 'cast', 'right', 'on-stage.I', 'saw', 'production', 'maybe', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'Murat', 'here', 'Indy', 'young', 'lady', 'whom', 'had', 'even', 'gotten', 'requisite', 'rose', 'know', 'play', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'still', 'remember', 'pageantry', 'spectacle', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'still', 'have', 'playbill', 'nifty', 'color', 'album', 'came', 'it.When', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'little', 'bit', 'back', 'time', 'saw', '1925', 'silent', 'version', 'legendary', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Sr.', 'dressed', 'up', 'Phantom', 'Halloween', 'have', 'primary', 'versions', 'followed', '1943', 'Claude', 'Rains', '1962', 'Herbert', 'Lom', '1983', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Jane', 'Seymour', '1989', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Jill', 'Schoelen', '1998', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Asia', 'Argento', '2004', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'was', 'movie', 'based', 'play', '.The', 'cinematography', 'more', 'equal', 'choreography', 'not', 'only', 'DVD', 'also', '2011', 'production', 'course', 'stage', 'play', 'beautiful', 'auditorium', 'lighting', 'harmonics', 'are', 'clarion', 'fantastique', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'was', 'awesome', 'watch.Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'Phantom', 'was', 'painful', 'behold', 'was', 'great', 'thing', 'voice', 'resonated', 'TV', 'making', 'want', 'look', 'around', 'see', 'were', 'sitting', 'next', 'Not', 'last', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'concert', 'DVD', 'have', 'felt', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'enjoying', 'live', 'performance', 'Universal', 'did', 'good', 'Sierra', 'Boggess', 'beauty', 'rivals', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'hers', 'rendition', 'Christine', 'was', 'spot-on', 'even', 'burly', 'guy', 'was', 'brought', 'tears', 'got', 'something', 'eye', 'dangit', 'wept', 'farewell', 'Phantom.Lovely', 'phenomenal', 'cool', 'beans', 'just', 'wow']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

I've seen it twice in NY and I own the movie version of it, not to mention some collectiables.But this, live 25 anniversary addition is so much better than the movie. ( of coarse it dosen't compare to seeing it live in person, but it's the next best thing.) The music is beyond words. It's soft,sometimes loud. Dark, haunting, hypnotic, out of this world, incrediable music. It dosen't get better than phantom. And the storyline is romantic and gothic.I love the Phantom. Especially his since of humor. For those of you who don't know what Phantom of the Opera is about it's about a musical genius who lives underneath the Paris Opera House and he falls obsessivly in love with the soprano singer at the opera, Christine. Raoul is the Phantom's rival for Christine's affections. There is a special surprize at the end of this addition of Phantom some guest stars come out along with Andrew Lloyd webber and sing. The only thing that I had a big problem with with this dvd is that the chandelier does not come crashing towards the audience like it would in the NY version if seen in person. I would think, since this version is supposed to be the best and they made a big deal over it, that it would have the chadelier crash. But nooo. That was my only let down for this.

Hadley Fraser is dreamy as her boyfriend!But what I enjoyed the most was having previous ""Phantoms"" make singing appearances on stage, after all the current players took their bows! Colm Wilkinson, Peter Joback, John Owens-Jones, Anthony Warlow all sang with the current Phantom, while Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cameron Macintosh, Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford watch from behind in absolute sheer bliss!

I've seen the stage production 3 times, with three different casts, and have long dreamt of a version on film that captures the soul of seeing it on the stage.  After seeing Phantom staged at the RAH on bluray my hopes and dreams have been almost fully realized.Pros:-It heals the hurts caused by the soul-less Joel Schumacher version.-The casting is fantastic!  The Phantom is great, but Christine and Raoul shine in their roles.-The wide shots are great, capturing the unique digital backdrops and staging.-Seeing a cast of over 100 performing Phantom is wonderful!-The little additions to the music (using a full orchestra) are great.-It is a great production, performed remarkably well, in a timeless setting.-The curtain calls, and all the bonus stuff afterward, is wonderful Phan service!Cons:-It is still a stage production, so the visible presence of microphones and stage makeup will likely jar some viewers.-The closer the camera zooms in, the more the digital backdrops look pixelated.-Despite the fact that it is Phantom, it is not staged as you would see it done on Broadway.  Large props (the elephant) are left out entirely, and the chandelier does not actually fall.  As long as you expect a new interpretation of some of these things, it is not a con.  And if this film inspires you to see it on the stage as it was meant to be seen, it is a good thing!Bottom line: if you are a Phantom Phan, this is a must have!

(More complete then the movie just a like cut here or there NOTHING to really get excited over.) This version is nothing short of incredible. Now fans of Sarah and Michael DON'T KILL ME, please. I saw this in the theater for the live broadcast and was amazed by the performances in this. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, who co-starred in the ""Phantom"" sequel ""Love Never Dies"" in London, reunited for the special production and with amazing chemistry. Having grown up on the OLC recording and owning about a half a dozen others I've never grown to really like the piece outside of the original cast. Maybe it's nostalgia for it or just the way others have sung it but this time I was blown away. Never in my life have I cried at this show until now. Ramin's Music of the Night was like hearing the song for the first time all over again and Sierra's high notes are flawless and clearer then ever Sarah did back in her early days. The odd standout performance for me was of all things Kiera Duffy as 'Carlotta'. She brought a fullness and venerability to the role I never ever thought about and her look go absolute terror during the rehearsals for The Phantom's opera still sticks out in my mind as genius.  The performances in this alone make this for me THE version of phantom.  Visually one should know off the bat that the chandler does not crash down... it is after all just a concert. The staging is mostly done with LED screens which, while not MY preferred thing, are alright. Small set piece are brought on and off and the costumes are all here in their glory. While I hope the LES screens don't make their way into the regular staging they did help to set the mood for the night, but it was hands down the cast and orchestra that makes this astounding.

While in London, we were able to catch the actual musical at one of the opera houses. It was an amazing experience. From the costumes to the cast, everything was beautiful. After we watched the musical I told my wife that there was a 25th Anniversary blu-ray that I think we should buy since it was done at the Royal Albert Hall. This blu-ray of the 25th Annvierary did all that is Phantom of the Opera justice. The cast was, again, amazing! Especially the one who played the Phantom, Ramin Karimloo, his voice matched the character so well. The cast on the blu-ray was four to five times bigger than the one we watched it London so it was overwhelming to see all those people fit on one stage.You HAVE to watch the whole disc. Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber makes an appearence with the original cast from London. The 'concert' at the end is amazing because you will see how each cast member appreciates each other. Some of the cast members on the disc were actully the ones performing at the live show we went to in London.Overall, this is an amazing disc.

However, as everyone is entitled to their opinion, I am also very fond of the Phantom movie from 2004. I think Emmy Rossum had a beautiful voice and played a sweet and innocent Christine in the film and Gerard Butler might not be Michael Crawford when it comes to the voice, but he played a dark and menacing phantom who hit the nail on the head in the various dramatic scenes he was required to play. I think there is room for both the film and the newly released HD Blu-ray. The camera angles caught this play so well and the lighting is so good.

Everything about this presentation captures how this classic story should look and feel--epic and grandiose, moving and emotional, majestic and enchanting. It is a perfect blend of orchestra, story, singing, mood and emotion; in short, it is a flawless musical.For one, the performers  are exceptional, and quite flawless, especially given that this was a live performance with the world watching. Sierra Boggess, as Christina Daae, is simply amazing, stealing the show with her beautiful voice and singing. She also has the perfect range of emotion in the scenes with the Phantom. Wendy Ferguson also does a fantastic job as well as Christina's foil. Ramin Karimloo does an exceptional job as the Phantom, giving the appropriate blend of pathos to the tragic figure.Furthermore, the production is visually stunning. There are so many scenes that are handled eloquently with the right amount of power and emotion (the graveyard scene with Christine, the masquerade scene, the opening, the finale). The Phantom of the Opera should be seen but also felt, and this production accomplishes this. You literally feel like you are there in the audience watching this. Any film version of The Phantom really pales in comparison to this. One reviewer said it best: it is the difference between fast food and filet mignon.There is also a Grand Finale with the original cast from 1986 coming out and singing with this cast. Andrew Lloyd Webber also makes an appearance. Very cool!The extras include a behind the scenes feature, looking at the preparation for before the big event, with the cast and crew getting ready for the world to see their performance. This really puts into perspective how much work the crew and cast did to get ready, and how much detail goes into this.The sound and picture quality are also great as well.There are so many good things to say about this production.

I saw the show on the 1st national tour years ago and loved it, due to what I now realize was an excellent cast. We saw it again about 7 years later, and liked it much much less, due mostly to a ""Christine"" who evoked a very strong image of a secretary from Queens hanging onto a subway strap. Wretched. I happened upon this Albert Hall production on PBS, and was shocked after just a few minutes by the atrocious acting. It was amazing to see that since the play has become so popular it has also lost, at least in this production, any finesse or sincerity. It was totally played to the audience, there was no illusion or subtlety or suspension of reality, as I had experienced in the first tour. There was also an irritating palpable modernizing of the characters delivery, other than possibly the two men who run the opera. Call me cuckoo..but I do not remember ""Christine"" delivering the pivotal ""Think Of Me"" with an unrelenting, beaming smile, as she saunters around the stage like a drag queen in a Burlesque palace...the touching emotions and drama that I remember feeling at this number were stomped on.  The ""Carlotta"" was a horrifically bad actress. The Phantom? They might as well have had John Stamos or David Dinklehoff play him..LOUSY. I seem to be in the minority in my opinion, but after my initial excitement upon happening onto this viewing last night, I quickly found my face contorting into a gruesome grimace which remained until i could bare it no more, and even the ""car wreck"" appeal soon dissipated.

Most of the former Phantoms performed along with Sarah Brightman.  They are still fabulous.  Michael Crawford was also there but didn't perform.  Does anyone know why?

I admit she looked a bit older and put a little of her weight back,(sounds like me)but I thought her voice was still great.This is the best 22.00 I ever spent.One last thing that doesn't have much to do with this show.

Recording such as this include the excitement and enchantment of audience reaction and that is a true showing of love. The production at Royal Albert Hall (huge though it is) is splendid - semi-staging, lighting, orchestral performance and singing. It just works very very well.One of the main reasons to purchase this DVD is to actually get to watch Ramin Karimloo weave his spell. Not only is his voice perfect for this role (and for the many other roles he is successfully adding to his repertoire) but his stage presence is completely within the concept of the original work. He has the audience spellbound with his acting, his physique, and his glorious singing. Much the same can be said for Sierra Boggess. She adds tremendously to the blending of voices that is so much a part of whether or not this wild tale works.Not only is this a fine tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber but it is also a tribute to the tenacity of fine musical theater. For all lovers of Webber's output this recording is a must.

1494093,A17771LTRWSKQ5,B005M0X078,Helen S. Lam,"[0, 0]","I saw the musical on Broadway twice, the 2004 movie 3 times and the 25th Anniversary on a 46' screen at the State Theatre.  This 25th anniversary edition has the strongest cast with beautiful singing by Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, the best Phantom and Christine.  Hadley Fraser's singing was also good.  I did not particularly like his portrayal of Raoul.  Whereas other portrayals of Raoul all show a dandy and kind gentleman who is the complete opposite of the Phantom, Fraser's Raoul is domineering and frankly a jerk.  (Perhaps Fraser was creating a new Raoul to better fit the one in the sequel, Love Never Dies.)  I was not particularly impressed by the other cast members. The set is nicely done although I am not crazy about the highly pixelated projects that passed for some of the scenery.Having seen all three incarnations of Phantom of the Opera, your choice really depends on your preference.  If you prefer beautiful music, you cannot go wrong with this 25th anniversary edition.  If you prefer a more cohesive plot and beautiful scenery (not to mention a very sexy Phantom played by Gerard Butler), go for the 2004 movie.

I have seen POTO over 25 times and this cast surpasses almost all others as an ensemble cast. (Yes, including Michael Crawford, my least favorite Phantom.)However, once again some young, overzealous film editor does not trust the performances, the director of the show, the music, the costumes and all other amazing aspects of this show enough to just let them be what they are. The editor cuts every 4 seconds to an arbitrary camera angle and no scene can be appreciated for its depth and staging which at many times looks like or should look like a painting,e.g., the frozen moment at the beginning of Masquerade. (Actually, it may not have been a real person doing the editing; it could have been done by a random number generator picking camera angles.) You would be better just to listen to the cd because the performances are top notch, the voices great, the orchestrations full and rich, the staging brilliant, but the constant change of camera angle creates an almost stroboscopic effect which might even cause seizures in many of us. Unfortunately, this has become the standard for filming live performances. My wish would be that when they put out a disc of a performance, they would offer an additional angle (something dvds and bds are able to do) of one stationary camera from the best seat in the house, just like it would be if you were actually attending a live production, and let the show be what it is. A good show does NOT need bizarre, haphazard, rapid fire cuts to make it exciting; the show itself is exciting.All of that said, how beautiful is Sierra Boggess' voice (Christine) ""wishing you were somehow here again"" and Ramin Karimloo (Phantom) who I saw in the London production of Love Never Dies; they are exciting and spectacular and the only reason to try to survive a viewing. Hadley Fraser (Raul) also does a fine job, actually better than I expected.(John Barrowman was decidedly the best Raul ever.)The add-ons at the end are fun and make it worth renting and watching once, which is what I did--not quite as exciting as the casts from the Les Miz anniversary disc, but still fun to see. (Sarah Brightman is still good enough.)I will not be buying this myself; I have pre-ordered the Love Never Dies disc and I shudder to think what it might look like after having endured this editing nightmare.",1,Great to listen to; Impossible to watch!,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2389,"['Let', 'be', 'frank', 'up', 'front', 'love', 'show', 'music', 'have', 'seen', 'POTO', '25', 'times', 'cast', 'almost', 'others', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Yes', 'including', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'least', 'favorite', 'Phantom', 'However', 'once', 'again', 'young', 'overzealous', 'film', 'editor', 'not', 'trust', 'performances', 'director', 'show', 'music', 'costumes', 'other', 'amazing', 'aspects', 'show', 'enough', 'just', 'let', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'editor', 'cuts', '4', 'seconds', 'arbitrary', 'camera', 'angle', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'depth', 'staging', 'many', 'times', 'should', 'look', 'painting', 'e.g.', 'frozen', 'moment', 'beginning', 'Masquerade', 'Actually', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'person', 'doing', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'random', 'number', 'generator', 'picking', 'camera', 'angles', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'just', 'listen', 'cd', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'voices', 'great', 'orchestrations', 'full', 'rich', 'staging', 'brilliant', 'constant', 'change', 'camera', 'angle', 'almost', 'stroboscopic', 'effect', 'might', 'even', 'cause', 'seizures', 'many', 'Unfortunately', 'become', 'standard', 'filming', 'live', 'performances', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'put', 'out', 'disc', 'performance', 'would', 'offer', 'additional', 'angle', 'something', 'dvds', 'bds', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'one', 'stationary', 'camera', 'best', 'seat', 'house', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'actually', 'attending', 'live', 'production', 'let', 'show', 'be', 'what', 'good', 'show', 'NOT', 'need', 'bizarre', 'haphazard', 'rapid', 'fire', 'cuts', 'make', 'exciting', 'show', 'exciting.All', 'said', 'how', 'beautiful', 'Sierra', 'Boggess', 'voice', 'Christine', 'wishing', 'were', 'somehow', 'here', 'again', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'Phantom', 'who', 'saw', 'London', 'production', 'Love', 'Never', 'are', 'exciting', 'spectacular', 'only', 'reason', 'try', 'survive', 'viewing', 'Hadley', 'Fraser', 'Raul', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'was', 'decidedly', 'best', 'Raul', 'ever', 'add-ons', 'end', 'are', 'fun', 'make', 'worth', 'renting', 'watching', 'once', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'exciting', 'casts', 'Les', 'Miz', 'anniversary', 'disc', 'still', 'see', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'myself', 'have', 'pre-ordered', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'disc', 'shudder', 'think', 'what', 'might', 'look', 'having', 'endured', 'editing', 'nightmare']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

This is the first stage play that I've seen and it amazes me how the actors and set changes and all that other stuff works together.Sierra Boggess was an excellent Christine. She had a wonderful voice and her acting was excellent. I didn't care for Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom as much as Gerard Butler the 2004 movie; he seemed too harsh. He had an awesome voice, though, I will give him that. As to Hadley Fraser as Raoul, I must admit I couldn't decide if I liked him a whole lot or not until the very end, when he sings the line, &#34;Just let me see her!&#34; I could hear the pain in his voice and I just loved him at the moment! He did a good job, he just seemed a little too intense at times.Personally I thought it was cool in the end when Andrew Lloyd Webber and the original Phantom Cast came on stage and sang The Phantom of the Opera and The Music of the Night.

1494115,A3SYG2WYQNZOZC,B005M0X078,J Wong,"[1, 1]","I really like this DVD of The Phantom of the Opera.  I usually have some difficulty with live shows for a few reasons:  before the use of individual microphones, I would have difficulty hearing dialog or understanding lyrics; being too far from the stage makes it difficult to appreciate facial expressions and acting.  Also, I tend to feel the mood of music before registering the lyrics.  This DVD remedies these difficulties.  The production itself as well as the performers are excellent.  The camerawork allows for close ups (facial expressions, dialog, acting, details of dance and costume) and the distance views allow for greater appreciation of the corps de ballet and other wider scenes, angles one would not have live.  For the most part, the editing and flow between different camera angles is well done.  Subtitles (or the libretto I saved from my LPs) enhance the storyline by making clear the dialog and lyrics when needed.  One criticism is the uneven volume: the opening fanfare (Universal Studios logo) is very loud; the following dialog is extremely soft, as if individual microphones were not used; the following Overture is loud again and blasted me out of my seat after having turned the volume up for the Prologue.  The first 30 minutes were spent experimenting with settings on my DVD player and TV to get the right balance without having to constantly adjust the volume.  Act II seems to be more even in volume, perhaps because there's less dialog and more continuous music.  (The dialog in the final scene was again inaudible at the lower volume setting.)  (Other DVDs of musicals and this show on PBS did not have this problem.)  It would have been nice to have some production notes included, similar to a Playbill.  I also would like to see this production on a large screen.I recently purchased Les Miserables, the 10th Anniversary DVD (concert style) and previously, Camelot at the Winter Garden (which was filmed for HBO in the 1980s).  I really do like this format.  It's like bringing the show home.  After years of listening to the recordings and closing my eyes to remember the visual, I have both again.

Therefore, I had no expectations which might be why I was blown away by this absolutely spectacular, almost perfect musical version, including the incredibly moving 25-year celebration of Phantom with the tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber at the end. I could write paragraphs about the beauty this music, this version brought into my life over the years, but I want to make it brief because words are just words. This version brought to life The Phanton of the Opera story in a way I had not experienced before. The musical talent was simply excellent. The drama of this story was almost done like a perfect painting. Evoking great emotion as the orchestra, the actors and the stage production came together in perfect harmony. I had my tissues out halfway through the production and in that moment at the end, when the current Phantom bowed before Mr. Crawford, the first and arguably the best of all the Phantoms in humble reverence for beginning the legacy in this emotional and intensely beautiful story, I sat in awe for once that I could find no hubris in the artistic community that often baffles me when they constantly shove garage at us and call it ""art."" All I can say is BRAVO, Mr. Webber! YOU are the reason we, the humble, simple masses who make up the audience continue to pay those high prices to see Phantom of the Opera after all these years. Phantom of the Opera is entertainment at its best. It takes us away on a sad, romantic, gorgeous journey for 2 and a half hours, and in the end, we (at least everyone I know) never feel cheated. This version is the best, and I, who deplore Hollywood's self-glorifying awards, for once felt the glory was rightly given. DO get this version and be prepared for a journey full of aching beauty, intense sadness, and simple good, old-fashioned entertainment. The actors are young, but they bring such fresh energy to this play, their talent so huge, to say they do justice to this wonderful story, is an understatement.  Sarah Brightman, surrounded by past Phantom actors in the final tribute, singing Christine's song is another reason to buy this version. And finally, seeing the current Christine and Phantom, and the original Christine and Phantom surround Andrew Lloyd Webber in the very end, well, that made this the perfect ending to an enduring Broadway play that will most likely go down in history as one of the best plays ever written, produced, and acted by the entertainment community.",5,PHANTOM OF THE OPERA AT ITS VERY BEST,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2796,"['stumbled', 'version', 'yesterday', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'having', 'seen', 'Majestic', 'Broadway', 'NYC', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'having', 'seen', 'humble', 'opinion', 'terrible', 'version', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'once', 'loving', 'listening', 'original', 'version', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'enough', 'know', 'heart', 'Therefore', 'had', 'expectations', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'almost', 'perfect', 'musical', 'version', 'including', 'incredibly', 'moving', '25-year', 'celebration', 'Phantom', 'tribute', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'end', 'could', 'write', 'paragraphs', 'beauty', 'music', 'version', 'brought', 'life', 'years', 'want', 'make', 'brief', 'words', 'are', 'just', 'words', 'version', 'brought', 'life', 'Phanton', 'Opera', 'story', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'experienced', 'musical', 'talent', 'was', 'simply', 'excellent', 'drama', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'done', 'perfect', 'painting', 'Evoking', 'great', 'emotion', 'orchestra', 'actors', 'stage', 'production', 'came', 'together', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'had', 'tissues', 'out', 'halfway', 'production', 'moment', 'end', 'when', 'current', 'Phantom', 'bowed', 'Mr.', 'Crawford', 'first', 'arguably', 'best', 'Phantoms', 'humble', 'reverence', 'beginning', 'legacy', 'emotional', 'intensely', 'beautiful', 'story', 'sat', 'awe', 'once', 'could', 'find', 'hubris', 'artistic', 'community', 'often', 'when', 'constantly', 'shove', 'garage', 'call', 'art', 'can', 'say', 'BRAVO', 'Mr.', 'Webber', 'YOU', 'are', 'reason', 'humble', 'simple', 'masses', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'audience', 'continue', 'pay', 'high', 'prices', 'see', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'years', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'entertainment', 'best', 'away', 'sad', 'romantic', 'gorgeous', 'journey', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'end', 'least', 'everyone', 'know', 'never', 'feel', 'cheated', 'version', 'best', 'who', 'deplore', 'Hollywood', 'self-glorifying', 'awards', 'once', 'felt', 'glory', 'was', 'rightly', 'given', 'DO', 'get', 'version', 'be', 'prepared', 'journey', 'full', 'aching', 'beauty', 'intense', 'sadness', 'simple', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'entertainment', 'actors', 'are', 'young', 'bring', 'such', 'fresh', 'energy', 'play', 'talent', 'so', 'huge', 'say', 'do', 'justice', 'wonderful', 'story', 'understatement', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'surrounded', 'past', 'Phantom', 'actors', 'final', 'tribute', 'singing', 'Christine', 'song', 'reason', 'buy', 'version', 'finally', 'seeing', 'current', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'original', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'surround', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'very', 'end', 'well', 'made', 'perfect', 'ending', 'enduring', 'Broadway', 'play', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'best', 'plays', 'ever', 'written', 'produced', 'acted', 'entertainment', 'community']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

So I was thrilled when I found that there was actually a professional recording of the stage version. This does not disappoint. Christine has a good voice, and her acting is wonderful. I adored Hadley Frasier as Raoul, and Ramin Karimloo was a wonderful phantom (though I found his Canadian accent a bit jarring at the beginning juxtaposed against everyone else's British). Every singe face Carlotta makes is golden.Honestly, the only thing I didn't like about it was the way they changed the scenery around. Instead of the full solid set they substituted large TV screens and projections for some of the background and for the mirror scene going into the title song.

I have seen the show twice before and loved it and have always loved the beautiful music.  Andrew Lloyd Webber did a great job with this (along with Cameron Mackintosh) production.  Ramin and Sierra shone as the Phantom and Christine.  I'm not going to lie -- I wan't sure about Sierra at first since I had never heard her sing before, but she's amazing.  And Ramin...my goodness!  I saw him as Enjorlas in the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables as well and he was so powerful there.  I knew he'd make the perfect Phantom.What I really loved about this was you truly felt like you were not only there at the Royal Albert Hall, but that you had a front row seat (better than a front row seat even).  The close-ups are amazing.  And this was not in a concert style format like Les Mis was last year.  It was the entire show (nothing left out!!) with the actors actually acting, not just standing at a microphone singing.The end of the show was just...I still, after two weeks of seeing it cannot even begin to explain the ending/encore.  Of course ALW came out and gave a speech and then introduced the original London cast minus Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.  I was a little bummed but of course, he announced them after the cast had come out.  So great to see both of them and I must say Michael looks as good now as he did in 1986!!!  And Sarah...wow.  She sings 'Phantom of the Opera' as four past Phantoms (including Colm Wilkinson, John Owen Jones and Anthony Warlow...there was one more but I forgot his name) came out and sang with her.  It was great!  But that wasn't it.  The four Phantoms (plus Ramin) sang the most beautiful version of Music of the Night.  I got goosebumps.  It was just gorgeous!  I wish that Michael Crawford had sung as well, but I'm guessing he had a good reason.This is definitely a DVD worth buying and watching over and over again.

1494137,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005M0X078,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Long before movies became the dominant force of nature when it comes to entertainment the theater held audiences captive around the world. The lure of the stage for actors' remains but the popularity comes and goes in waves. Twenty five years ago interest in the stage rose once more when Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA opened. Webber combined horror, musical theater and romance into one massive production and it is the benchmark that many musicals are now compared to.It's hard to believe that it's actually been 25 years since it was first performed. It remains fresh for the thousands who see it performed to this day. I was fortunate enough to see it performed live in both Chicago and Cleveland and it still gives me chills to think of the opening. When I heard about THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 25TH ANNIVERSARY PERFORMANCE LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL I was anxious to see how it would come out. It is amazing and a true treat for those who may have never seen it performed live.If you've never seen the stage performance (and by all means you should) or the movie version (good but doesn't nearly equal a live performance) then you need to watch this. While the Royal Albert Hall wasn't set up for stage performances the crew involved here to a stupendous job mixing the stage performance, live orchestra and video screens to bring it to life.The story itself (for those who've missed it so far) involves a young woman named Christine Daae (Sierra Boggess), a member of the chorus in the French Opera House, who has caught the eye of the mysterious Phantom (Ramin Karimloo). He's coached her and sets about to replace the Opera's reining diva with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Mishaps continue to occur until Christine is finally recognized by the new owners as well as their financial backer, Raoul (Hadley Fraser). It seems that he and Christine grew up together and were once in love.The Phantom continues his training of Christine in his underground labyrinth beneath the Opera house in a dwelling he's formed in the sewer system of the Paris. Here he composes songs meant just for her as well as teaching her how to perform. It's obvious he love her deeply but hides not just his emotions but his face behind a half mask due to scarring that took place some time ago.Raoul and Christine are joined together in love much to the displeasure of the Phantom who seeks to possess Christine body and soul. As he manipulates everything about the Opera house to bring her to stardom, a final confrontation between the two men for the love of Christine is imminent. She will have to make a decision between her long lost love and the man who inspires her music with his own.Instead of the scary and horrific monster we've been witness to for so many years when it came to the Phantom we are now presented with a deformed innocent who was tortured and ridiculed most of his life wanting nothing more than to be loved. This Phantom is the most sympathetic character in the film even though he murders, kidnaps and threatens to get his way. His longing for love, not lust, when it comes to Christine is sad and at moments you find yourself rooting for him instead of Raoul.The story would be enough to make this interesting but the music that goes with it only enhances the whole. Songs like ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" and ""Music of the Night"" are tunes that will remain in your memory long after witnessing this piece.As if it wasn't enough to see a near perfect performance of the musical once the entire cast takes its bow Webber himself takes the stage. He thanks so many for their help through the year and then introduces the original crew and then the cast from that first London performance including Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Brightman then performs ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with five of the actors that have done so in the past 25 years. These same men then perform ""Music of the Night"". It is an amazing thing to watch and enjoy.If you've never seen this musical then this is the way to do so short of finding it playing live. Not only is it a wonderful 25th anniversary present, it's a brilliant musical as well and the package put together to celebrate is one worth adding to your collection.",5,CAN IT REALLY HAVE BEEN 25 YEARS?,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4281,"['Long', 'movies', 'became', 'dominant', 'force', 'nature', 'when', 'entertainment', 'theater', 'held', 'audiences', 'captive', 'world', 'lure', 'stage', 'actors', 'remains', 'popularity', 'waves', 'Twenty', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'interest', 'stage', 'rose', 'once', 'more', 'when', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'THE', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'opened', 'Webber', 'combined', 'horror', 'musical', 'theater', 'romance', 'one', 'massive', 'production', 'benchmark', 'many', 'musicals', 'are', 'now', 'compared', 'to.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'actually', 'been', '25', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'performed', 'fresh', 'thousands', 'who', 'see', 'performed', 'day', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'performed', 'live', 'Chicago', 'Cleveland', 'still', 'think', 'opening', 'When', 'heard', 'THE', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', '25TH', 'ANNIVERSARY', 'PERFORMANCE', 'LIVE', 'AT', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'ALBERT', 'HALL', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'amazing', 'true', 'treat', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'performed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'stage', 'performance', 'means', 'should', 'movie', 'version', 'good', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'equal', 'live', 'performance', 'then', 'need', 'watch', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'stage', 'crew', 'involved', 'here', 'stupendous', 'job', 'mixing', 'stage', 'performance', 'live', 'orchestra', 'video', 'screens', 'bring', 'life.The', 'story', 'who', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'so', 'far', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'Sierra', 'Boggess', 'member', 'chorus', 'French', 'Opera', 'House', 'who', 'caught', 'eye', 'mysterious', 'Phantom', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'coached', 'sets', 'replace', 'Opera', 'reining', 'diva', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Mishaps', 'continue', 'occur', 'Christine', 'finally', 'recognized', 'new', 'owners', 'as', 'well', 'financial', 'backer', 'Raoul', 'Hadley', 'Fraser', 'Christine', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'were', 'once', 'love.The', 'Phantom', 'training', 'Christine', 'underground', 'labyrinth', 'Opera', 'house', 'dwelling', 'formed', 'sewer', 'system', 'Paris', 'Here', 'songs', 'meant', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'teaching', 'how', 'perform', 'obvious', 'love', 'deeply', 'not', 'just', 'emotions', 'face', 'half', 'mask', 'due', 'scarring', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'ago.Raoul', 'Christine', 'are', 'joined', 'together', 'love', 'much', 'displeasure', 'Phantom', 'who', 'possess', 'Christine', 'body', 'soul', 'everything', 'Opera', 'house', 'bring', 'stardom', 'final', 'confrontation', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'Christine', 'imminent', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'decision', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'music', 'own.Instead', 'scary', 'horrific', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'been', 'witness', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'came', 'Phantom', 'are', 'now', 'presented', 'deformed', 'innocent', 'who', 'was', 'tortured', 'ridiculed', 'most', 'life', 'wanting', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'loved', 'Phantom', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'even', 'kidnaps', 'get', 'way', 'longing', 'love', 'not', 'lust', 'when', 'Christine', 'sad', 'moments', 'find', 'rooting', 'instead', 'Raoul.The', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'music', 'only', 'whole', 'Songs', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'Music', 'Night', 'are', 'tunes', 'will', 'remain', 'memory', 'long', 'witnessing', 'piece.As', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'see', 'near', 'perfect', 'performance', 'musical', 'entire', 'cast', 'bow', 'Webber', 'stage', 'thanks', 'so', 'many', 'help', 'year', 'then', 'original', 'crew', 'then', 'cast', 'first', 'London', 'performance', 'including', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Brightman', 'then', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'five', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'past', '25', 'years', 'same', 'men', 'then', 'perform', 'Music', 'Night', 'amazing', 'thing', 'watch', 'enjoy.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'musical', 'then', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'short', 'finding', 'playing', 'live', 'Not', 'only', 'wonderful', '25th', 'anniversary', 'present', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'well', 'package', 'put', 'together', 'celebrate', 'one', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

1494144,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B005M0X078,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[3, 4]","""The Phantom of the Opera"" has always been one of my absolutely favorite stories.  Its exploration of true beauty, love, sacrifice and isolation is timeless and proves why this story never grows old.  Webber's musical adaptation of Gaston Lerroux's novel is sheer beauty.  This show was my first introduction to musical theatre, so I am, of course, biased.  Nevertheless, this 25th anniversary concert of this timeless show contains some of the best renditions of the music I have ever heard.The Paris Opera House is besieged by mysterious and often dangerous pranks.  A shadowy figure haunts its labyrinthian halls and secret underground passageways.  When this charismatic, dangerous and ultimately tormented ""Phantom"" falls in love with little-known chorus girl, Christine Daae, he begins molding her into a wondrous singer.  However, because of a severe facial deformity that has alienated him even from birth, this musical genius remains hidden from his protegee.  Although he instructs Christine, he cannot allow her to see him.  Christine struggles with loneliness and grief herself.  Orphaned at an early age, her mind is filled with the childhood stories of her deceased violinist father.  Her father promises Christine that he will send the ""Angel of Music"" to her when he is in Heaven.  Therefore, when an unseen voice begins teaching the young woman, she immediately falls under the Phantom's spell.  What follows is a riveting story in which two different yet ultimately similar individuals embark upon heartbreaking journeys of obsession, shattered innocence, and sacrifice.The cast members of this concert are truly breathtaking.  Ramin Karimloo does superb work as the Phantom.  His voice is mesmerizing in its silken smoothness, yet it can also throb with terrifying anger.  Sierra Boggess was beautiful as Christine; bringing vulnerability and hidden strength to her role as her innocence is lost.  Her rendition of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is perhaps the most beautiful and emotionally charged version of this song I have ever heard.  You really get a sense of Christine's longing for her father and for the kind, unseen ""Angel of music"" who gave her the gift of song.  Hadley Fraiser is good as Raoul, although no one will ever surpass Steve Barton's gentleness and sincerity.I was equally impressed by the supporting cast.  Most surprising of all, I was impressed with the singer portraying Carlotta.  Usually this character is flamboyant, obnoxious, and extremely unlikable.  However, the woman portraying the diva in this production brings an emotional depth to this role.  I actually felt sorry for Carlotta; a feat not easily accomplished!As a blind individual, I cannot comment on scenery or the costumes.  However, I can say that the renditions of the songs is the best part of this production.  If you are looking for visual spectacle, then know that this production is a concert.  Therefore, the famous ""chandelier"" scene, I have been told, is not present.  However, if you want a story with true emotional depth, then consider watching this production.  As an added treat, see the original Christine, Sarah Brightman, sing with four superb Phantoms.  I was especially moved by the mesmerizing finale in which such notables as Colm Wilkinson, John Owen-Jones, and two other well-known Phantoms sang a beautiful harmonic rendition of ""Music of the Night"".  Please give this excellent tour de force a chance.

1494151,ANIEU8QC4MT9K,B005M0X078,M. Lee,"[1, 1]","Ask yourself this question: Is it possible to make a scene emotional by the music, words, and the sadness in your face and demeanor without breaking your voice and sobbing through half of the lyrics?The pure heartbreak of the song ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" was never do to some gasping in between the notes or a dramatic flinging wide of the performer's arms; not to me. A gentle, wistful and defeated depiction of grief is often more moving than a sobbing, almost hysterical one. When someone is not crying aloud in agony, often it is not because they haven't reached that level of pain yet; it is because they have moved beyond it.Sierra Boggess unfortunately ruins the sting of that song with her overacting and disjointed singing. Her voice would be absolutely lovely were she not constantly breaking it in a sob or gasp of pain. Similarly, in some of the other songs she sings (""Think of Me"" and ""All I Ask of You""), she interrupts her own voice with quick breaths of nervousness or excitement. All this while flinging herself about in a wild manner that is not necessary even for a huge audience. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. However, I must add that in the last two songs, ""Past the Point of No Return"" and ""The Final Lair"", her acting improves considerably, and she is actually quite convincing as being heartbroken in the last scene. Her singing, too, is not so broken or exaggerated. In other words she seems to have calmed down a bit.Hadley Fraser's acting is actually quite good; but his voice seems often strained on the low notes and rather than being gentle and soothing as perhaps Raoul's voice ought to be, it made me feel tense and uncomfortable.On the other hand, Ramin Karimloo gives a quite literally stunning performance. He seems to be able to change his voice from one of powerful command to an incredibly soft and smooth lilt. I did not know one person could have so versatile a voice. He has the necessary high range for the songs he sings without having a thin voice, and his acting performance is often wild, insane, and abrupt; in other words, very good for the part he is playing. In his case, excessive theatrics are not unwelcome: the Phantom has mostly lost his mind and being wild and impulsive is warranted. But this does not often intrude into his wonderful vocals, and he commands the eyes not because of random changes of volume which cause you to turn to look at him just to see who on earth just punched him in the gut, but rather because you want to pay sufficient enough attention to catch his every glorious note and because you must see what he will do next as his character is obviously very unstable. He also gives an incredibly touching performance in the final scene where his character is brought back to sanity by love, even bringing tears to my eyes.The filming of this 25th Anniversary Edition is wonderfully done; rarely have I seen a stage performance so masterfully captured. The props and effects used on stage are all quite real looking and the way some of the scenes were set up was very inventive.The music and story of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" are always powerful, beautiful and moving. It is actually my favorite musical, and definitely worth seeing; however, I would recommend finding a different version. Perhaps this one is worth watching on the basis of the effects, filming, and Ramin Karimloo's performance alone; but I suggest checking it out at the library or renting it before buying.",3,Sometimes less really is more,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,3478,"['Ask', 'question', 'possible', 'make', 'scene', 'emotional', 'music', 'words', 'sadness', 'face', 'demeanor', 'breaking', 'voice', 'sobbing', 'half', 'lyrics', 'pure', 'heartbreak', 'song', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'was', 'never', 'do', 'gasping', 'notes', 'dramatic', 'flinging', 'wide', 'performer', 'arms', 'not', 'gentle', 'wistful', 'defeated', 'depiction', 'grief', 'often', 'more', 'moving', 'sobbing', 'almost', 'hysterical', 'one', 'When', 'someone', 'not', 'crying', 'aloud', 'agony', 'often', 'not', 'have', ""n't"", 'reached', 'level', 'pain', 'yet', 'have', 'moved', 'it.Sierra', 'Boggess', 'unfortunately', 'sting', 'song', 'overacting', 'disjointed', 'singing', 'voice', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'were', 'not', 'constantly', 'breaking', 'sob', 'gasp', 'pain', 'Similarly', 'other', 'songs', 'sings', 'Think', 'Me', 'Ask', 'own', 'voice', 'quick', 'breaths', 'nervousness', 'excitement', 'flinging', 'wild', 'manner', 'not', 'necessary', 'even', 'huge', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'cry', 'However', 'must', 'add', 'last', 'two', 'songs', 'Past', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'Final', 'Lair', 'acting', 'improves', 'considerably', 'actually', 'quite', 'convincing', 'being', 'heartbroken', 'last', 'scene', 'singing', 'too', 'not', 'so', 'broken', 'exaggerated', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'calmed', 'down', 'bit.Hadley', 'Fraser', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'voice', 'often', 'strained', 'low', 'notes', 'rather', 'being', 'gentle', 'soothing', 'perhaps', 'Raoul', 'voice', 'ought', 'be', 'made', 'feel', 'tense', 'uncomfortable.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'quite', 'literally', 'stunning', 'performance', 'be', 'able', 'change', 'voice', 'one', 'powerful', 'command', 'incredibly', 'soft', 'smooth', 'lilt', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'one', 'person', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'voice', 'necessary', 'high', 'range', 'songs', 'having', 'thin', 'voice', 'acting', 'performance', 'often', 'wild', 'insane', 'abrupt', 'other', 'words', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'playing', 'case', 'excessive', 'theatrics', 'are', 'not', 'unwelcome', 'Phantom', 'mostly', 'lost', 'mind', 'being', 'wild', 'impulsive', 'warranted', 'not', 'often', 'intrude', 'wonderful', 'vocals', 'eyes', 'not', 'random', 'changes', 'volume', 'cause', 'turn', 'look', 'just', 'see', 'who', 'earth', 'just', 'punched', 'gut', 'rather', 'want', 'pay', 'sufficient', 'enough', 'attention', 'catch', 'glorious', 'note', 'must', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'character', 'obviously', 'very', 'unstable', 'also', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'performance', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'brought', 'back', 'sanity', 'love', 'even', 'bringing', 'tears', 'eyes.The', 'filming', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'performance', 'so', 'masterfully', 'captured', 'props', 'effects', 'used', 'stage', 'are', 'quite', 'real', 'looking', 'way', 'scenes', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'inventive.The', 'music', 'story', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'are', 'always', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'actually', 'favorite', 'musical', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'finding', 'different', 'version', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'basis', 'effects', 'filming', 'Ramin', 'Karimloo', 'performance', 'alone', 'suggest', 'checking', 'out', 'library', 'renting', 'buying']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

These are usually operas, symphonic orchestras, ballets and other more traditional art forms.  I actually checked these out a couple times but the high ticket cost has kept me away.  I stumbled upon this Blu ray version of a live production in London of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom.""  This was in fact, the 25th anniversary production staged by Cameron Mackintosh.This is a fairly significant departure from the 2004 film version in terms of staging.  While some will quibble with some of the singing in the movie, there should be no issues with this fine stage production.  And a stage production is what this is.  At the same time you will get the sense of a film as cameras are everywhere and the editing is extremely good.  With this superb Blu ray transfer you may even be taken aback with some of the close-ups which show wig lines, make-up and mics.  I found it interesting and never an issue.  Speaking of the disc itself again.  The DTS-Master Audio sound is spectacular.  The surrounds are active throughout, not only with the music but with whispers, sound effects and individual instruments.While all of the singing is top notch, kudos to Wendy Ferguson as the plump Carlotta.  She does a lot with a small role.  And Sierra Boggess is amazing as Christine.  Her voice is spectacular to the point of bringing tears and her acting is perfect.  Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Hadley Fraser as Raoul are solid throughout.  The costumes, projection designs, choreography and set designs far exceed any of the many versions of the ""Phantom"" that I've seen.  If that isn't enough, after the production concludes, Andrew Lloyd Webber introduces former cast members from the first company and several ""Phantoms"" that followed throughout the years.

His vocal performance on the cast cd has always been what I have compared others take on the role to. Sorry to say this but I think I may like Ramin even a bit more. Sierra as Christine was wonderful. Both of their performances were really moving. You can feel the anguish for both Christine and the Phantom at the end. Something that even the 2004 movie lacked.  Also, a big surprise is the performance of Raoul. For once new life is breathed into what is a very  shallow part. Had the movie been close to what this filmed stage show is, it would have been so much better.  The movie was supposed to  capture the musical in the best version possible ( full sets, huge orchestra,) It didn't happen.  Thankfully this production came along. It is a better representation of the musical ( considering the changes that had to be made due to venue chosen).Note. I know a lot of people had a problem with the screens as opposed to using the full sets from the show.  I see the argument, but if anything I think it only adds to the theatrical side of the piece.  In a way having to use minimal sets and props, it sort of resembles a shakespeare play. Now, of course I wouldn't suggest doing this for the show  from now on, but for this occasion it worked really well.I give this five stars ( i'd give it ten if such a thing were possible)",5,Phantastic,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1422,"['performance', 'amazing', 'Firstly', 'Ive', 'always', 'liked', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Phantom', 'vocal', 'performance', 'cast', 'cd', 'always', 'been', 'what', 'have', 'compared', 'others', 'take', 'role', 'Sorry', 'say', 'think', 'may', 'like', 'Ramin', 'even', 'bit', 'more', 'Sierra', 'Christine', 'was', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'moving', 'can', 'feel', 'anguish', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'end', 'Something', 'even', '2004', 'movie', 'lacked', 'Also', 'big', 'surprise', 'performance', 'Raoul', 'once', 'new', 'life', 'breathed', 'what', 'very', 'shallow', 'part', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'close', 'what', 'filmed', 'stage', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'capture', 'musical', 'best', 'version', 'possible', 'full', 'sets', 'huge', 'orchestra', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Thankfully', 'production', 'came', 'along', 'better', 'representation', 'musical', 'considering', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'due', 'venue', 'chosen', '.Note', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'had', 'problem', 'screens', 'opposed', 'using', 'full', 'sets', 'show', 'see', 'argument', 'anything', 'think', 'only', 'theatrical', 'side', 'piece', 'way', 'having', 'use', 'minimal', 'sets', 'props', 'sort', 'resembles', 'shakespeare', 'play', 'Now', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'doing', 'show', 'now', 'occasion', 'worked', 'really', 'well.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'i', ""'d"", 'give', 'ten', 'such', 'thing', 'were', 'possible']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

There are some very good things about this performance and then there are the things I wished could have been better:  Some have argued that Ramin was not the best choice for the Phantom and his vocals are &#34;dodgy&#34;.  The vocals are indeed a bit off here and there but overall well done and no complaints about the acting.  Sierra has been called a much better vocalist than actress.  This is probably a fair assessment as she did out sing Ramin and he probably is the better actor overall.  However when you put the two of them together its magic even with the flaws.  Special shout out to Rosemary Ashe...she filled in as Carlotta at the last minute and she was great. Some argue that this just wasn't very well put together (lack of planning) and what's with the chandelier not crashing?  While I did see some issues, I believe that this is probably the best filmed version one will see...ever.  Then there is Michael Crawford...what was he thinking when he turned down the opportunity to sing?  I've read it was due to other commitments and needed to save his voice.  I could see clearly on his face he was in fact distressed by his decision not to...at 70 when this was filmed if he was going to do it that was it.  While the four phantoms were very entertaining (special shout out to Owen-Jones) can you think of anyone else more qualified to sing to Sarah Brightman &#34;Sing once again with me...&#34;?  Sarah probably should have dropped her acquired technique here to do the title track...except the very end.  Her final vocal run was exceptional.  I'd argue it sounds better than on the original recording.  It ALMOST makes up for Crawford's absence.  Do NOT miss Cameron's expression as she starts her final run and how he just keeps getting more pleased as she continues...it is priceless!  Ramin's and John's expressions as are pretty good too.  Some love Gerard Butler and Emma Rossem...while both put on a good show and even sound pretty good, it just does not match up with what Ramin and Sierra do.  Is this a perfect show...by no means.

I have never seen a stage production of &#8220;The Phantom of the Opera&#8221;, only viewing an old movie picture starring Claude Rains, where he played the Phantom.  I did enjoy listening to &#8220;Music of the Night&#8221; whenever I heard it, so that when I saw that there was a recent movie version of the opera on Amazon directed by Joel Schumacher, I decided to view it.  It stars the lovely Emmy Rossum as Christine.  Ms. Rossum was only eighteen when she played that role.  Evidently she had some opera experience singing with Puccini, and she has a rather lovely soprano voice.  The music composed by Andrew Webber is magnificent and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.Then I saw that Netflix had the stage production, so I decided to watch that to see what the difference was.  I was flabbergasted.  This is an extravagant production with wonderful sets and props that really drew you into the play.  This was a 25th Anniversary Celebration of Andrew Webber&#8217;s work.  At the end of the production there was a special treat wherein all the past actors who played the Phantom sang the Music of the Night.  The Royal Albert Hall in London is stunning and it was packed to the brim with thousands of patrons.  I understand that when it played (Fall 2011) they streamed it across the globe and thankfully they had the good sense to film it.The principle actor/singers, Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess as Christine, and Hadley Fraser as Raoul were excellent.  I must say that Sierra Boggess as Christine was extraordinaire, and the electricity between her and Ramin Karimloo was awesome.  Sierra Boggess&#8217;s soprano is out of this world, the beauty of the score sometimes bringing tears.  Some critics say that Sierra Boggess IS Christine, because of her talent in playing the role.  This production will blow your socks off.

But, if you have seen the stage production save your money and pass this dog up. Why did they not just film the stage version in Her Majasity theater where it has been playing for 25 years. Surly they could have had a reunion of the original cast to present at the end. But no we get Albert Hall, probably the worse place in the world to have a stage play. Constantly seeing bright LCD lights that distracted from this play, watching gang planks going up and down, noise, and about every part of the mechanics in view. The Phantom was so poorly sung and played I wondered if he every heard of his role. Apparently studying Michael Crawfors role was never considered. This dog was so poorly directed, and was held in such a poor location that not even the rising and crashing of the chandelier was possible, which is one of the most amazing part of the stage production. This done solely for money and nothing else.The movie version was terriable and this production is just barely better.Beg, borrow or steal money, fly to NY and see it on Broadway before one day it ends, you will never regret it.Stay away also from the 25 year special package also, not only does it not even have the show DVD, it's just a book.Maybe someday Andrew Lloyd Weber will explain why he never filmed the original play in London when it first played and had the original cast.Maybe he can explain why, if you are going to have a 25 year show you hire the finest singers and players in the world, then find a first class place to show it.

1494165,A1BVKUA32LKR2W,B005M0X078,Phantom Bookworm,"[1, 2]","As other reviewers have said, The Phantom of the Opera at Royal Albert Hall is the closest anyone can come to watching the live production without actually being there, aside from a few changes.As many of you know, The Phantom of the Opera is about a deformed musical genius who is obsessed with a young aspiring opera singer he has taken under his wing, posing as her Angel of Music, never showing her his face for fear of rejection. He has never known love from another person before and stops at nothing to obtain her love, not even when Raoul de Chagny, a handsome and wealthy man from Christine's childhood, reenters her world.I was first introduced to the story when the 2004 movie was released and saw it live on Broadway once in 2006. I've read the original novel and most of the book adaptations available through amazon. I guess I would call myself a seasoned 'phan'. I was super excited when I discovered this, since I've been longing to see the show on stage again but obviously tickets are expensive and currently there is no US tour of Phantom.I really enjoyed this performance a lot and even though there were things that were different (small and major), I still think this is a worthy addition to any 'phan's' collection. I would suggest buying it on Blu-ray because the costumes and set designs are simply magnificent. Everything is very sumptuous, high quality, and pleasing to the eye. Sierra Boggess (Christine) pretty much steals the show as she portrays a frightened and lost young woman who is striving to tear herself away from the memory of her deceased father. Sierra's performance brings Christine's character to life. She is strong yet naive, searching, and desperate to be free of the Phantom. Some may say that her style of acting is melodramatic, but I think it's apprpriate for this sort of musical and there's no denying she put every ounce of her heart and soul into her acting and singing.Hadley Frasier (Raoul) was different from how Raoul is commonly portrayed. Frasier brought a more take-change, demanding, ballsy sort of Raoul which is in contrast with the traditional sweet, gentle, charming, brave portrayal of the character. I found that the strength of his and Sierra's performances detracted from the power and menace of the Phantom. Even though Raoul is generally not a character who backs down to the Phantom, even when his life is threatened, Frasier came across more as angry and explosive. There's a part near the end when the Phantom has released Raoul from the noose and Christine has to restrain him from beating the Phantom to a pulp (and I believed without a doubt he was caapable of doing so.) This made the Phantom appear a lot more powerless for someone whose presence should dominate in a very sinister way -- but I just didn't feel it with Karimloo's portrayal of the Phantom. I suppose it made more sense to portray Raoul this way since he later becomes a drunken, gambling, wife beater in Love Never Dies.My least favorite part of the show was Ramin Karimloo. I know A LOT of people love him, but I just couldn't connect with him. Ever since Gerard Butler played the Phantom in the 2004 movie, I've noticed a trend of young, sexy Phantoms. The thing is, I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He's menacing, mysterious, sinister, preying, and yet the audience can still connect with him on a deeply emotional level. I didn't find Karimloo to be any of those things. He was not compelling in any way. He has a nice voice and everything, but he's not scary or intimidating and doesn't pack the punch the role requires for the show to tie together (this is all just my very humble opinion.) I tried really hard to like him and find what others appreciate in him, but still nothing clicked.Karimloo's best moment is in the PONR scene. That scene was done very well and is charged with sexual tension. This is probably the only part I connected with Karimloo's Phantom. There is a moment when Christine embraces him from behind and he reaches for her with trembling, vulnerable hands. Aside from the three main characters, I really enjoyed Madame Giry and Carlotta. It was refreshing to see a more complex version of Carlotta, even though I like the charicature too. The music is wonderful, as always, and there were some nice surprises at the end. It was interesting how they portrayed Christine as reluctant to leave the Phantom after their kiss. It was nice to see something different, but it was a little jarring to see such a drastic change in her behavior toward the Phantom and I wondered if they made the change to support the premise of Love Never Dies, which I don't and will never accept as a true continuation.Even though I was not toally satisfied with Karimloo's performance, this is still a really good show and I think people should go into it appreciating the fact that they're performing live and giving it all their best. Some people may not like how the chandelier doesn't fall or that the mannequin of Christine isn't present during the lair scenes, but those differences seem minimal in respect to how flawlessly the actors and orchestra deliver their portrayal of this timeless story.",4,Very good!,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,5163,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Royal', 'Albert',

It's all ""new!"" and ""improved!""....it's new all right but not improved.  I hate seeing new technology imposed on the stage.  Films have been ruined for years now by too much reliance on CGI and 3D....if this production of the ""Phantom of the Opera"" is any indication, reliance on ""technology"" has now invaded stage productions.  If so, this is unfortunate news for theatre lovers.With the LED screens, the producers have tried to meld the ""art"" of the video game with the art of the stage and it just doesn't work.  The LED screens are extremely distracting and totally spoil the suspension of disbelief.  While trying to get lost in the magic of the music and the story, you are instead distracted by the obvious fakeness of background ""sets"" imposed on the viewer via large television screens with the individual pixels in plain sight.  It is so distracting that the magic is lost and the action on the stage is, at times, laughable.  This is really quite a shame.The libretto is identical. Not one scene has been changed or left out.  However, the staging has been radically altered.  ""Masquerade"" for example, no longer takes place on the staircase of the Paris Opera House.  Instead, it takes up the entire stage with far too many people on that huge stage.  And the Phantom's mysterious entrance is entirely ruined by having him enter on a GIANT LED screen....it's awful.  Christine sings ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" to the AUDIENCE....not to her father's grave.  The ""grave"" is BEHIND her on a big ugly LED screen!  One of the best scenes was utterly ruined, at least for me.  There are horrible examples of this peppered throughout...just when you start getting into the beautiful music, you are distracted by the awful staging and the fakiness of the LED screens.On a rare positive note, the singing is crystal clear.  You can hear every single word clearly and the libretto is perfectly understandable.Also, because the camera can come in very close, you can see the acting of the performers and, for the most part, it is very good.  The last scene with Christine returning the Phantom's ring is especially moving.If you love ""The Phantom of the Opera"" as much as I do, I recommend that you rent this just to hear the wonderful libretto and see the expressions of the actors up close.  It's not a wise purchase however.  You probably won't want to see it again for the reasons I've mentioned.The best way to see ANY musical is in person at the theatre of course. I hope that the ""old"" Phantom will continue to be staged as it was originally.  However, I fear that this ""new and improved"" Phantom may displace the old and that will be darned shame.  If that happens, we will only have our cherished memories to remind us how great this show once was.",2,Very disappointing,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,2901,"['who', 'wanted', 'see', 'recreation', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'preserved', 'video', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'new', 'improved', '.it', 'new', 'right', 'not', 'improved', 'hate', 'seeing', 'new', 'technology', 'imposed', 'stage', 'Films', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'years', 'now', 'too', 'much', 'reliance', 'CGI', '3D', '.if', 'production', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'indication', 'reliance', 'technology', 'now', 'invaded', 'stage', 'productions', 'so', 'unfortunate', 'news', 'theatre', 'lovers.With', 'LED', 'screens', 'producers', 'have', 'tried', 'meld', 'art', 'video', 'game', 'art', 'stage', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'LED', 'screens', 'are', 'extremely', 'distracting', 'totally', 'spoil', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'trying', 'get', 'lost', 'magic', 'music', 'story', 'are', 'instead', 'distracted', 'obvious', 'fakeness', 'background', 'sets', 'imposed', 'viewer', 'large', 'television', 'screens', 'individual', 'pixels', 'plain', 'sight', 'so', 'distracting', 'magic', 'lost', 'action', 'stage', 'times', 'laughable', 'really', 'quite', 'shame.The', 'libretto', 'identical', 'Not', 'one', 'scene', 'been', 'changed', 'left', 'out', 'However', 'staging', 'been', 'radically', 'altered', 'Masquerade', 'example', 'no', 'longer', 'place', 'staircase', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'Instead', 'up', 'entire', 'stage', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'huge', 'stage', 'Phantom', 'mysterious', 'entrance', 'entirely', 'ruined', 'having', 'enter', 'GIANT', 'LED', 'screen', '.it', 'awful', 'Christine', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'AUDIENCE', '.not', 'father', 'grave', 'grave', 'BEHIND', 'big', 'ugly', 'LED', 'screen', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'was', 'utterly', 'ruined', 'least', 'are', 'horrible', 'examples', 'peppered', 'just', 'when', 'start', 'getting', 'beautiful', 'music', 'are', 'distracted', 'awful', 'staging', 'fakiness', 'LED', 'screens.On', 'rare', 'positive', 'note', 'singing', 'crystal', 'clear', 'can', 'hear', 'single', 'word', 'clearly', 'libretto', 'perfectly', 'understandable.Also', 'camera', 'can', 'come', 'very', 'close', 'can', 'see', 'acting', 'performers', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'last', 'scene', 'Christine', 'returning', 'Phantom', 'ring', 'especially', 'moving.If', 'love', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'recommend', 'rent', 'just', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'libretto', 'see', 'expressions', 'actors', 'up', 'close', 'not', 'wise', 'purchase', 'however', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'mentioned.The', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'ANY', 'musical', 'person', 'theatre', 'course', 'hope', 'old', 'Phantom', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'staged', 'was', 'originally', 'However', 'fear', 'new', 'improved', 'Phantom', 'may', 'displace', 'old', 'will', 'be', 'darned', 'shame', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'cherished', 'memories', 'remind', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'once', 'was']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall

1494198,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B005M0X078,Sky,"[1, 1]","I knew that I shouldn't have rented this....I should have bought it!!! And even though I just saw it as a rental, I have since indeed purchased it on Blu Ray. And to those looking to stream this via Instant Video, I hope that the device that you are streaming it to will play it in HD with DTS 5.1 Surround sound. If not, I'd recommend that you stream something else in your queue, and pick this up on DVD or Blu Ray. Because....If you have seen the live show, you may think before viewing this that a DVD could not possibly do justice to something that so captured your heart live on Broadway (or wherever you saw it live). I had the same thought too. I have seen the live show with several different companies on Broadway going all the way back to 1990, and every time I saw the show it affected me unlike any live performance that I have seen to date. From the spectacular stage design, to the talented performers, to the pure emotion emanated from every song, the show took me in, pulled on every heart string and left me dying for more. Now with the DVD I can attest that any preconceived notion that I had about it not living up to the live performance has evaporated.Clearly some of my enchantment with the DVD was because I have seen the show live. The bar is set very high for what I expected out of the performances of the actors/actresses, and ESPECIALLY what I expected from the sound quality and filming direction. And all of my expectations were exceeded!The performances are unforgettable. Any actor/actress looking to play the respective roles of The Phantom and Christine Daa&eacute; has to fill the shoes of original cast members Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (and the scores of talent that succeeded them). After all, you can have all of the elements in place to put on a Broadway show, but if you don't have the talent that makes you believe and puts everything that they have into their performance...it just won't work. The performances in the 25th Anniversary Celebration show have it all. Most importantly, Sierra Boggess in the role of Christine is outstanding...amazing...beautiful...and unforgettable. And lesser known Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Hadley Fraser as Raoul could have won the lead roles back in 1986. The performances are just phenomenal and the entire cast shines; everyone stands out in their own roles.When seeing a live show the booming sound of the live orchestra behind the performers contributes heavily to a memorable experience. The sound on the DVD is perfected and presented in DTS Surround where if you have a home theater that plays in 5.1 or better and you crank up the volume...well, you will think that you are literally at the live show. If you're adamant about streaming this instead of getting the DVD, you'd probably get satisfactory 2.0 sound using a pair of headphones, but this really is a big screen production and you will appreciate it more watching it in HD on a large flat screen.And finally, as far as the film direction for this performance...the camera was right where you would want it to be at every moment. Long, perfect angles for each shot with no inappropriate jumping around. The camera moved as if it were your own eyes moving to where they would move if you were in one of the first few rows of the show.As somewhat of a bonus, at the end of the show after the cast takes their bows, Andrew Lloyd Webber comes out for a bow too, and thanks everyone involved in the production going back to the beginning. The highlight being when he brings out Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Webber says that Brightman has agreed to sing, and she proceeds to perform Phantom of the Opera with several of the past Phantoms....except for Crawford! Word is that Crawford didn't sing because he had just finished performing in a matinee of The Wizard of Oz at the London Palladium...Um...so?!?

I for one enjoyed the movie. Now back to the review.Dark, gothic, haunting, murder, romance. I love this story. In this adaption, they changed some (minor) lyrics & a few other nitpicky changes. It does not however change the experience. I for one really liked that they humanized The Phantom. You could feel his heartbreak & pain. I for one am not usually a crier. But let me tell you, I had tears running down my face by the end of this performance. Ramin Karimloo was pitch perfect as The Phantom. Possibly the top two Phantoms I've seen.  There were times where I felt that The Phantom could have been more menacing & threatening. However, it got me thinking that is The Phantom truly evil or is he the victim of circumstance, who's just misunderstood. Is he all good? No. But he's not all bad either. Sierra Boggess's Christine was shining as well. You could see Christine's internal dialogue within herself near the end. Her love for both men is visible. Hadley Fraser's portrayal of Raoul was interesting. While he has a good voice, the character came off as kind of a bump on a log. Not much personality during the first viewing. However, near the end, the emotion & pain  in his eyes was incredible. Do I wish they kept the ""signature opening scene"" in? Absolutely. Do I miss the classic props rising up through the floor & the classic magic mirror? You bet. Does it affect the thrill, excitement,enchanting, mesmerizing & bewitching theatre experience at an affordable price?

Theatre purists may argue that there is nothing as good as live theatre but I can't agree.  I saw Phantom on stage in Toronto years ago and had excelent seats, yet I was more captivated by this filmed version.  The advantage of the Royal Albert version is that it had roving camera eyes -- when a long shot was required, as with the chandelier scene, the camera was viewing from an audience seat; when a close-up of the actors' faces was required, the camera was right there.  (How they do this without intruding on the performance or stepping on the actors' toes, I can't imagine.)  The advantage is far better and more intimate viewer involvement in the performance.  Of course, another advantage is that this video is a lot cheaper than the price of a theatre seat at a major venue.  This is a wonderful performance with top-notch performers and is filmed beautifully.  My only complaint, and it's a fixable one, is that at the end of the play, Andrew Llyold Webber comes out, speaks a bit, introduces Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (the original cast members) and four other former Phantoms who then sing with Ms Brightman.  It's a pleasant bit of business but anti-climatic to the play: it takes away from the emotional power of the main show.  I don't know how the DVD is formatted --whether this self-congratulatory part at the end is separated from the main film -- but my suggestion is that when Sir Andrew shows up, hit the stop button.  Watch this latter bit at a later time.  Enjoy this performance, as I think anyone who loves Phatom will.",5,Wonderful!

1494211,A2P0Y85C896QIB,B005M0X078,Thomas Raven,"[2, 2]","While this is an enjoyable performance of Phantom, it is also a little bit odd.  I can't for the life of me understand why they chose to stage this, a show that needs fly space, a proscenium, and wings, in a hall that has none of those things.  This production, in which the theatre itself is practically a character in the show, is a bit of a fish out of water for that reason.  The solution was to use large, low-res video screens in place of much of the scenery.  When seen in person, these probably looked pretty good, but when shot up close, as in this presentation, they look terribly pixelated and they distract from some good performances.Speaking of which, Sierra Boggess is a great Christine.  Her voice is much less shrill than Sarah Brightman's and her performance is top notch.  Ramin Karimloo, on the other hand, gives it the old college try, but he's miscast.  He's too slight of build and his voice is a bit too perfect.  Maybe I'm just biased.  I saw Michael Crawford perform the role on Broadway and don't think anyone else has nailed it since.  Crawford, who appears here briefly during extended curtain calls and encores, had a haunting quality and a physical presence that Karimloo simply lacks.Still, despite the issues, this is a good production and the music sounds as good as ever.  You owe it to yourself to see this if you've ever been a fan of Phantom, if for no other reason than to see the bits with ALW, Brightman, and Crawford at the end.

1494214,A1SF7RT2UNXW37,B005M0X078,Tinnean,"[1, 1]","And I'm not just saying that because out of the Phantom makeup Ramin Karimloo is gorgeous. ;-) Sierra Boggess, his Christine, has the most expressive eyes and face I've seen in forever. When she smiles, she smiles with her eyes, and when they sing ""Point of No Return"", she looks as if he's already seduced her.A friend first sent me the link on YouTube to the finale. Seeing all six Phantoms on stage together was a thrill. (I don't think Michael Crawford sang, but he did wave very enthusiastically.) So as soon as I learned it was going to be aired on PBS, I made sure to set up the VCR to tape it.It was good, even with all the pledge breaks, and I put it on my Amazon wish list. (The price on Amazon is excellent, although I don't understand why the CD is actually more expensive.) I ordered it, and it arrived last week.Now, you have to understand this about me: I'll order a DVD and it can sit in its wrapper for weeks, months, years before I finally watch it. That wasn't the case with Phantom. I've already watched it three times, and I'll probably watch it again tonight.The only quibble I have is with the sound. At times I could see Ramin's lips moving, but I couldn't hear anything. And when he says to Christine, ""You... try... my... patience...."" you have to be listening really hard to hear it. But seriously? That's a very minor quibble.He's made this Phantom very sympathetic. His cry, ""Why, Christine? Why?"" broke my heart. I wanted Christine to choose him. Yes, I know he killed, apparently without compunction, but some people are alive only because it's against the law to kill them. *cough*This is the actual play, not a concert, and while the chandelier doesn't actually come down, it does seem to explode.The music, the sets, the costumes, the acting... it all adds up to a magnificent experience.Oh, and right now? The price on Amazon has been reduced. So don't sit there reading this! Go and buy it!

I had the privilege of seeing it in the theater in the U.S. on 10/2/11 and once again on 10/5/11 as a rebroadcasted Encore performance.  I'm so excited that I'll be able to watch it again and again.  The taping of the show and cinematography were spectacular.  You by no means feel like you are in a seat in the audience watching it from may rows in front of the stage.  No, you are up close, on stage, beholding closeups of the various performers play their iconic roles to perfection.  You see the costumes like you've never seen them before, the rage and hurt in the Phantom's eyes, the conflict and yearning of Christine for two men.  The performances of Ramin Karimloo (Phantom), Sierra Boggess (Christine), and Hadley Fraser (Raoul) are nothing less than brilliant, as well as the rest of the cast.  If you love Phantom on stage, you'll love this DVD. The after performance reprisals of the Phantom of the Opera and the Music of the Night with legends such as Sarah Brightman, Anthony Warlow, John Owen Jones, and Colm Wilkinson will move you to tears, plus the appearance of Michael Crawford, Andrew Lloyd Webber (of course), Cameron Mackintosh, and Charles Hart.

Hutter ""v_rh""","[0, 0]","I have attended a live Broadway-touring company production of Phantom, own and view frequently Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom movie starring Gerard Butler and was curious to see the 25th anniversary London production at the historic Prince Albert Hall when PBS showed this production once again as part of their annual fundraiser.  It is magnificent:  the voice of the actress who plays Christine is pure and absolutely outstanding; several of the other cast members' voices are also excellent although I preferred a couple of the actors' voices from the movie to a few of this production.  My PBS station used this DVD as a premium along with the 2-CD sound track for a contribution of $185.00.  This DVD was less than $20 from amazon.com and includes the anniversary celebration of the original cast members from the first London production which was a treat seldom seen by audiences, including Sarah Brightman and four of the previous Phantoms singing hits from the show and some of the people who developed Phantom for the stage production 2 1/2 decades earlier.  Andrew Lloyd Webber hosted the celebration at the conclusion of the play and you could see the emotion in his face as he listened to and reacted to the audience's joy.  This DVD is a bargain for anyone who loves musical theatre at its finest and has not seen the longest-running musical ever to play on Broadway in the U.S.---and it certainly costs less than a trip to London.  Some  reviewers have stated that they prefer seeing the production live and a couple did not like the Phantom movie of 2004 but I love each of the three:  live, 2004 movie and this 25th anniversary production of 2012.  This would make a great addition to a DVD library for theatre and/or Phantom fans and/or gifts along with the 2-CD sound track from this 25th anniversary London production.

I give 5 stars just for the Show including the wonderful music, and spectacular performance of the entire cast, 4.5 stars for the stunning picture, but only 4 stars for the sound, because it lacked dynamic and volume for the vocals that often got a very low level sound compared to the sound of the orchestra. A wonderful Show that was almost damaged by a mistaken sound engineering. Also, lacked best sound involvement, and even the stereo effect was poorly exploited by putting the whole orchestra at center stage, unless I choose to play stereo sound with Dolby PLIIx when, in this case, the sound is more dynamic and engaging. However, when I saw the ""grand finale"", all the criticisms that I made with respect to the sound does not seem so important. From this point the sound gets more dynamic and with more volume, and ends up enriching greatly the guest Sarah Brightman's participation in the presence of the current and old phantoms, and together they conclude the show with an  ""grand, and exciting, finale"". I just read a review from a Brazilian who complains about the errors from the lyrics of songs in Portuguese-BR subtitles. Yes, it is true, if someone tries to follow the direction of history with subtitles, the person will be confused and don't  will understand the correct meaning of the phrase. This shows total lack of knowledge of the translation work. A shocking example was the inexplicable reversal of  English word ""masquerade"" to ""Carnaval"" in the subtitles, and several other inexcusable mistakes revealed in the subtitles for the Portuguese-BR(Brazil). However, selecting subtitles for the Portuguese-PT(Portugal), I could see that another translator did his best work of translation, where I can not identify translation errors that could confuse the reader.",5,This Blu-ray almost exceeded my expectations,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1862,"['would', 'be', 'perfect', 'Blu-Ray', 'was', 'not', 'sound', 'inconsistencies', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'Show', 'including', 'wonderful', 'music', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', '4.5', 'stars', 'stunning', 'picture', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'sound', 'lacked', 'dynamic', 'volume', 'vocals', 'often', 'got', 'very', 'low', 'level', 'sound', 'compared', 'sound', 'orchestra', 'wonderful', 'Show', 'was', 'almost', 'damaged', 'mistaken', 'sound', 'engineering', 'Also', 'lacked', 'best', 'sound', 'involvement', 'even', 'stereo', 'effect', 'was', 'poorly', 'exploited', 'putting', 'whole', 'orchestra', 'center', 'stage', 'choose', 'play', 'stereo', 'sound', 'Dolby', 'PLIIx', 'when', 'case', 'sound', 'more', 'dynamic', 'engaging', 'However', 'when', 'saw', 'grand', 'finale', 'criticisms', 'made', 'respect', 'sound', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'important', 'point', 'sound', 'more', 'dynamic', 'more', 'volume', 'up', 'enriching', 'greatly', 'guest', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'participation', 'presence', 'current', 'old', 'phantoms', 'together', 'conclude', 'show', 'grand', 'exciting', 'finale', 'just', 'read', 'review', 'Brazilian', 'who', 'errors', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'Portuguese-BR', 'subtitles', 'Yes', 'true', 'someone', 'follow', 'direction', 'history', 'subtitles', 'person', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'understand', 'correct', 'meaning', 'phrase', 'total', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'translation', 'work', 'shocking', 'example', 'was', 'inexplicable', 'reversal', 'English', 'word', 'masquerade', 'Carnaval', 'subtitles', 'several', 'other', 'inexcusable', 'mistakes', 'revealed', 'subtitles', 'Portuguese-BR', 'Brazil', 'However', 'selecting', 'subtitles', 'Portuguese-PT', 'Portugal', 'could', 'see', 'translator', 'did', 'best', 'work', 'translation', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'translation', 'errors', 'could', 'confuse', 'reader']",The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall
