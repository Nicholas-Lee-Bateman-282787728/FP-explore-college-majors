This movie had the best rating of any of her other movies, so I decided to buy it.I give ""Crimes of Fashion"" three stars as a good (meaning wholesome,entertaining) movie for its intended audience. In my opinion, that audience is the Hanna Montana set (young girls, 12 - 15 year of age). I believe all others will regret paying the money.That said, I was impressed with Kaley Cuoco's stage presence, fitality, and acting ability. She reminds me of the young actresses in ""Chasing Liberty"" and ""What a Girl Wants"" (both of which appeal to braoder, and older, audiences).Luckily, I have someone who will appreciate receiving it as a gift.",3,Buyer Be Warned: Good Movie for a Narrow Target Audience...,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,781,"['bought', 'movie', 'was', 'impressed', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'acting', 'good', 'looks', 'Transformers', '2', 'surprisingly', 'engaging', 'amusing', 'SciFi', 'movie', 'had', 'best', 'rating', 'other', 'movies', 'decided', 'buy', 'it.I', 'give', 'Crimes', 'Fashion', 'three', 'stars', 'good', 'meaning', 'wholesome', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'intended', 'audience', 'opinion', 'audience', 'Hanna', 'Montana', 'set', 'young', 'girls', '12', '15', 'year', 'age', 'believe', 'others', 'will', 'regret', 'paying', 'money.That', 'said', 'was', 'impressed', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'stage', 'presence', 'fitality', 'acting', 'ability', 'young', 'actresses', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'appeal', 'braoder', 'older', 'audiences', '.Luckily', 'have', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'receiving', 'gift']",Crimes of Fashion

1326284,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B0035ECHTK,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[10, 10]","Although this movie was copyrighted 2004 it was just released on DVD this year.  It apparently started out as a made-for-TV movie.  Kaley Cuoco has the lead role as a studious but unglamorous student at ""Fashion University"", Brooke Taylor (how good is that for a name in clothing fashion?) who soon learns that her grandfather, recently deceased, was a mob boss who left the family business to her.  A variety of plots ensue and intersect: whether or not her two closest friends at school (like her, they are not in the in-crowd) will still accept her once they learn the truth; what happens to the super-bitchy and glamorous Candace (Megan Fox) who wants to expose Brooke's secret mob-connected identity and get her expelled; the FBI agent assigned to take down the new, female mob boss and all her family who falls for her; the rival mob boss who wants to take over her turf; and what really happened to her grandfather.  The acting is frequently a bit over-the-top.  The ""mob"" is totally sanitized and seems pretty harmless.  There is no swearing, no sex scenes, no violence--this is really family fare, and if it were rated, could probably get a ""G"".  It's a comedy with a bit of love story thrown in.  The overall quality is compatible with a made-for-TV movie.  My wife & I both gave it a ""C"".  However it's harmless entertainment and there are some laughs here and there.  If you didn't see this on TV and you enjoy this sort of thing, then you may enjoy this on DVD.  There are subtitles; however there are no special features except one trailer on the DVD version.",3,Family Fare,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,1573,"['movie', 'was', 'copyrighted', '2004', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'DVD', 'year', 'apparently', 'started', 'out', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'lead', 'role', 'studious', 'unglamorous', 'student', 'Fashion', 'University', 'Brooke', 'Taylor', 'how', 'good', 'name', 'clothing', 'fashion', 'who', 'soon', 'grandfather', 'recently', 'deceased', 'was', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'left', 'family', 'business', 'variety', 'plots', 'ensue', 'intersect', 'not', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'school', 'are', 'not', 'in-crowd', 'will', 'still', 'accept', 'once', 'learn', 'truth', 'what', 'super-bitchy', 'glamorous', 'Candace', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'who', 'expose', 'Brooke', 'secret', 'mob-connected', 'identity', 'get', 'expelled', 'FBI', 'agent', 'assigned', 'take', 'down', 'new', 'female', 'mob', 'boss', 'family', 'who', 'rival', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'turf', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'grandfather', 'acting', 'frequently', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'mob', 'totally', 'sanitized', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'swearing', 'sex', 'scenes', 'violence', 'really', 'family', 'fare', 'were', 'rated', 'could', 'probably', 'get', 'G', 'comedy', 'bit', 'love', 'story', 'thrown', 'overall', 'quality', 'compatible', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'My', 'wife', 'gave', 'C', 'However', 'harmless', 'entertainment', 'are', 'laughs', 'here', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'TV', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'may', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'are', 'subtitles', 'however', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'version']",Crimes of Fashion
