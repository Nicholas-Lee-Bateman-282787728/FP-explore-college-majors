1614167,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B00ANDGYQS,CGScammell,"[1, 1]","This production with David Attenborough is a little different than the rest of his BBC programs.  This is a three-part production:  his Life on Camera, Understanding the Natural World, and Fragile Planet. There is more video of Attenborough the budding naturalist, as he hunts for elusive animals across Africa's plains.  There isn't as much spectacular scenery as there are in other BBC productions, since this DVD also shows older recordings when Attenborough was much younger but no less enthusiastic about wildlife and habitat but when video quality wasn't the best.Attenborough's passion for wildlife is evident here.  He is fascinated watching tree monkeys or gorillas or mating lions as much as he is feeling a giant beetle crawl up the side of his face.  Gaping mouths of alligators approaching him don't seem to startle him as much as it would a city slicker.  He is clearly comfortable being a part of their habitat, and his often youthful enthusiasm is contagious.I enjoyed all the footage of birds, and how the slow-motion footage shows the movement of the wings and feathers as a bird hovers over water watching its prey.  I also enjoyed the footage of the young geese learning to follow Attenborough, and learning to fly with his improvisations.  He never tires of these animals and his passion for them is clearly obvious.  This man is a natural.There is also a message here by Attenborough and his team:  man is destroying natural habitat for many of the animals featured in this production.  Ice caps are melting, jungles are being cut down, rivers and cities are getting polluted.Most of the video looks like outtakes from previous releases, and the format is brought to the viewer in small flashback to earlier footage of the 1990s or early 2000s.  When he's lecturing he's in his office in front of books, wearing his typical safari or jungle clothes and feeling very comfortable.  He is very animated when he speaks; his presentation demands a viewer's full attention.There is a lot to be learned in this production and it's worthwhile to view it all.  For those wanting jaw-dropping cinematography you may be disappointed.  For the curious naturalist this will be very pleasing.A copy was given to be to review in exchange of a review.",4,"Part autobiography, part scientific journey across decades",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2257,"['production', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'little', 'different', 'rest', 'BBC', 'programs', 'three-part', 'production', 'Life', 'Camera', 'Understanding', 'Natural', 'World', 'Fragile', 'Planet', 'more', 'video', 'Attenborough', 'budding', 'naturalist', 'elusive', 'animals', 'Africa', 'plains', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'are', 'other', 'BBC', 'productions', 'DVD', 'also', 'older', 'recordings', 'when', 'Attenborough', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'wildlife', 'habitat', 'when', 'video', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'best.Attenborough', 'passion', 'wildlife', 'evident', 'here', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'tree', 'monkeys', 'gorillas', 'mating', 'lions', 'as', 'much', 'feeling', 'giant', 'beetle', 'crawl', 'side', 'face', 'Gaping', 'mouths', 'alligators', 'approaching', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'startle', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'city', 'slicker', 'clearly', 'comfortable', 'being', 'part', 'habitat', 'often', 'youthful', 'enthusiasm', 'contagious.I', 'footage', 'birds', 'how', 'slow-motion', 'footage', 'movement', 'wings', 'feathers', 'bird', 'hovers', 'water', 'watching', 'prey', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'footage', 'young', 'geese', 'learning', 'follow', 'Attenborough', 'learning', 'fly', 'improvisations', 'never', 'animals', 'passion', 'clearly', 'obvious', 'man', 'natural.There', 'also', 'message', 'here', 'Attenborough', 'team', 'man', 'destroying', 'natural', 'habitat', 'many', 'animals', 'featured', 'production', 'Ice', 'caps', 'are', 'melting', 'jungles', 'are', 'being', 'cut', 'down', 'rivers', 'cities', 'are', 'getting', 'polluted.Most', 'video', 'outtakes', 'previous', 'releases', 'format', 'brought', 'viewer', 'small', 'flashback', 'earlier', 'footage', '1990s', 'early', '2000s', 'When', 'lecturing', 'office', 'front', 'books', 'wearing', 'typical', 'safari', 'jungle', 'clothes', 'feeling', 'very', 'comfortable', 'very', 'animated', 'when', 'presentation', 'viewer', 'full', 'attention.There', 'lot', 'be', 'learned', 'production', 'worthwhile', 'view', 'wanting', 'jaw-dropping', 'cinematography', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'curious', 'naturalist', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleasing.A', 'copy', 'was', 'given', 'be', 'review', 'exchange', 'review']",Life Stories
