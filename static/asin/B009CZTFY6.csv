1594875,A17B55N0YVR48L,B009CZTFY6,Gary M. Gerani,"[3, 3]","Always rather enjoyed Gene Barry's take on the legendary lawman BAT MASTERSON...  In a way, this suave and self-assured hero was something of a pre-Bond, taking on fatcat villains and their henchmen with both sly charm and macho fearlessness.  Bat a la Barry was both a rugged man's man and a dashing ladies' man, Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a few years ahead of time, but operating in the old West.  Apart from the pleasures of the show itself, I'm happy to report that the transfer quality of these 60 some-odd episodes is quite spectacular, as they are mastered from the original 35mm negatives.  And although this nifty ""Marathon"" box set doesn't contain every installment of the three-season series, it does have the pilot and most of Season One, and remains one heck of a great value.

The stories will be the same, but to own the 24 Hours boxset will enhance your TV Series collection, and stop the craving, at least for a while, to see the series again.Bat Masterson's trademark was his gold-knobbed cane, a derby hat, a custom built six shooter and his across-the-waist draw. He was unpredictable, surprising and one of the most colourful marshals and gun-fighters, but never killed unless he had to, and at all times was considered a threat. He was always found where trouble was, or maybe trouble found him. Liked by most men (and especially women), his enemies hated him with a vengeance.During his life he was an indian hunter, buffalo hunter, army scout, law enforcer and a gambler. His stories are legend, but historians have recorded two versions of how he won the ""Oriental"" gambling saloon.The American West would not be the same without the exploits of the one and only Bat Masterson, who was one among many to tame the Wild West, but shares the honor of which only a handful are remembered to this day and beyond. Gene Barry's portrayal of 'Bat' was to-a-tee, from his derby hat to his boots.Although the series will be out next month, I still recommend this boxset to any Bat Masterson fan, old or new alike, and I give this set five stars.

We were originally told that full-season sets of both shows would likely be offered by early November 2012.  As of this writing, however, this 62-episode ""Bat Masterson"" collection is the only one that has actually been made available.  I have purchased this set and have watched several episodes and can attest that the product is excellent and is a terrific value for the price.  The episodes are uncut and were evidently digitized from properly-preserved 35mm master prints.  The audio and video quality are exceptional for the age of the show.  The collection includes 8 discs in four boxes and the menus are very user-friendly.
