95437,A2WWW69QQWZE2O,0790731177,Charles M. Ciarametaro,"[0, 0]","Great film for all ages.  Very good acting, even from kids which is hard to find.  Very good plot and characters.  It was very good that they were on actual major league sites and used actual players in many scenes.  Most baseball movies have a bunch of baseball fan want-to-bez, but this film did not.  At times it was very realistic.  It truly shows how adults have messed us the game.  The film was able to use great statistics and actual baseball information to assist audience members that are not familiar with the game.  Two issues stopped me from rating it with 5 stars.  1: the sound was not very good.  At times I could not understand the main character and the music was much louder than the rest of the film.  I had to keep adjusting the volume. 2: It did show provocative images that in my opinion were not appropriate for kids.  They could have shown less and people would have gotten the idea.  Now I would not be allowed to show this to my students in elementary school.  Not good!  But over-all it is an excellent family film and worth the purchase price.",4,Little Big League review,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1072,"['Great', 'film', 'ages', 'Very', 'good', 'acting', 'even', 'kids', 'hard', 'find', 'Very', 'good', 'plot', 'characters', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'actual', 'major', 'league', 'sites', 'used', 'actual', 'players', 'many', 'scenes', 'Most', 'baseball', 'movies', 'have', 'bunch', 'baseball', 'fan', 'want-to-bez', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'times', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'truly', 'how', 'adults', 'have', 'messed', 'game', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'great', 'statistics', 'actual', 'baseball', 'information', 'assist', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'game', 'Two', 'issues', 'stopped', 'rating', '5', 'stars', '1', 'sound', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'main', 'character', 'music', 'was', 'much', 'louder', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'keep', 'adjusting', 'volume', '2', 'did', 'show', 'provocative', 'images', 'opinion', 'were', 'not', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'less', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'idea', 'Now', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'show', 'students', 'elementary', 'school', 'Not', 'good', 'over-all', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'purchase', 'price']",N/A

95440,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0790731177,Craig Connell,"[7, 7]","I almost canned it after the first 15 minutes, but I was glad I didn't because it turned to be a good movie.Thinking this was kid-safe, the first 15 minutes included two GDs by Dennis Farina and some uncalled-for vulgarity by Jason Robards, but everything settled down after those two exited the film soon after and it wound up being a ""cute"" baseball movie and very impressive in its realism.That ""realism"" was the most impressive aspect of the film to me. I had grown up seeing every baseball movie and never seeing any actors who knew what they were doing until Kevin Costner came along with his ""Field Of Dreams"" (and later with ""For Love Of The Game""). So I appreciate the more modern-era of movie-making where at least we see actors who can throw and hit. This movie is about as close to seeing real baseball as you're going to get: very realistic diamond action.The story was outlandish - an 11-year-old managing a Major League baseball team, but the baseball was so good and a good mix of comedy and drama made it turn out to be a satisfying film to watch. There are some nice shots of Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium in here, too.Luke Edwards, as the kid, was just fine and somebody you could root for. He was aided by adults John Ashton and Timothy Busfeld. The latter  couldn't have played a more likable ballplayer. He was great to watch.This a good film for adults, not just kids, and especially if you enjoy baseball.",4,Realism Makes This A Winner,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,1430,"['almost', 'canned', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'turned', 'be', 'good', 'movie.Thinking', 'was', 'kid-safe', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'included', 'two', 'GDs', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'uncalled-for', 'vulgarity', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'everything', 'settled', 'down', 'two', 'exited', 'film', 'soon', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'cute', 'baseball', 'movie', 'very', 'impressive', 'realism.That', 'realism', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'seeing', 'baseball', 'movie', 'never', 'seeing', 'actors', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'came', 'along', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'later', 'Love', 'Game', 'appreciate', 'more', 'modern-era', 'movie-making', 'where', 'least', 'see', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'throw', 'hit', 'movie', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'seeing', 'real', 'baseball', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'very', 'realistic', 'diamond', 'action.The', 'story', 'was', 'outlandish', '11-year-old', 'managing', 'Major', 'League', 'baseball', 'team', 'baseball', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'good', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'made', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'satisfying', 'film', 'watch', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'here', 'too.Luke', 'Edwards', 'kid', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'somebody', 'could', 'root', 'was', 'aided', 'adults', 'John', 'Ashton', 'Timothy', 'Busfeld', 'latter', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'more', 'likable', 'ballplayer', 'was', 'great', 'watch.This', 'good', 'film', 'adults', 'not', 'just', 'kids', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'baseball']",N/A

95443,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0790731177,Jason,"[1, 2]","Little Big League is the story of Billy Heywood, a kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and a grandfather who owns the Minnnesota Twins.  He's constantly around his grandfather because he has a single mother, and as a result, he lives, breaths, eats, and sleeps baseball.  Unfortunately for Billy, his grandfather dies.  On the bright side, little Billy inherits the Twins.With his first major decision as an owner, after briefly trying out a hard-nosed manager currently with the team, Billy names himself manager and coach.  The move is met with justified criticism and skepticism.  After all, he's a teenager who has shown nothing, and has not moved up the coaching chain.  And, at first, the nay-sayers appear to be correct, as Billy has difficulty balancing time between popping zits, playing Nintendo, and MANAGING A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM.  The concept is so ridiculous that it's not even worth mentioning; just go with it because it's fun.Well, the team sucks, sucked before Billy became manager, and nothing has changed.  The team blames their new precocious manager.  Afterall, how can a team relate to a kid who has never had a beer, chased a woman, or driven a car?Billy's infectious attitude eventually wins the team over, getting the team to play for fun and love of the game - a novel concept for today's athletes who think anything under 10million per year is an insult.  Naturally, the hijinks and winning ensues, and the team makes a run for the playoffs.  Along the way, Billy learns how to manage a baseball team, as well as the responsibilities of growing up.This is a great movie, very fun and entertaining.

The plot (teen inherits baseball team from grandfather and becomes manager) is wacky, the characters are stereotypes (""for the team"" vs. ""out for money""), and the ending is almost exactly what you would expect.Yet, putting those ""serious critiques"" aside, this is, as a baseball fan, one of my favorite films of all-time!  The reason?  It is able to capture the kind of humor that baseball fans will seize upon as their own.  Whether it be on-field tricks, clubhouse shenanigans, or the real-life ""adventures"" that players experience when not between the two white lines, all those areas are spot-on in their portrayal of the lighter side of America's pastime.The way I perceive this movie is as a nice little compliment to the Kevin Costner baseball persona.  Whereas Costner (in films like ""Field of Dreams"" and ""For The Love Of The Game"") re-creates the almost religious-like passion for the game of baseball that many fans have, this film does a similar deed...but from the comedic perspective.  For nearly every character that steps in front of the camera, you could (at some point in history) find a real-life major league counterpart.Thus, if you are a fan of baseball (especially the Minnesota Twins!) and are able to put your cynicism aside for about an hour and a half, this film will completely charm you with its hilarious antics and great baseball message (even if it is dripping in schmaltz).",5,"Really Nails The Concept Of ""Baseball Humor""",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,1479,"['face', 'value', 'Little', 'Big', 'League', 'nothing', 'more', 'kiddie', 'story', 'plot', 'teen', 'inherits', 'baseball', 'team', 'grandfather', 'manager', 'wacky', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'team', 'money', 'ending', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect.Yet', 'putting', 'serious', 'critiques', 'aside', 'baseball', 'fan', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'all-time', 'reason', 'able', 'capture', 'kind', 'humor', 'baseball', 'fans', 'will', 'seize', 'own', 'be', 'on-field', 'tricks', 'clubhouse', 'shenanigans', 'real-life', 'adventures', 'players', 'experience', 'when', 'not', 'two', 'white', 'lines', 'areas', 'are', 'spot-on', 'portrayal', 'lighter', 'side', 'America', 'pastime.The', 'way', 'perceive', 'movie', 'nice', 'little', 'compliment', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'baseball', 'persona', 'Whereas', 'Costner', 'films', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Love', 'Game', 'almost', 'religious-like', 'passion', 'game', 'baseball', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'film', 'similar', 'deed', 'comedic', 'perspective', 'nearly', 'character', 'front', 'camera', 'could', 'point', 'history', 'find', 'real-life', 'major', 'league', 'counterpart.Thus', 'are', 'fan', 'baseball', 'especially', 'Minnesota', 'Twins', 'are', 'able', 'put', 'cynicism', 'aside', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'will', 'completely', 'charm', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'great', 'baseball', 'message', 'even', 'dripping', 'schmaltz']",N/A
