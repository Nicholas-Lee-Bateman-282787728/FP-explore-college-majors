Is there any value in American popular culture?Filmmaker Havana Marking's startling documentary, ""Afghan Star,"" grapples with both Big Questions and---along the way---she shows us scenes we'd never imagine here in the U.S. The documentary covers the debut season of an Afghan network TV clone of ""American Idol."" You can chuckle at the quality of make-shift Afghan pop culture---such as it is after years of the Taliban and warfare. This new pop culture often is pretty basic stuff. Before one ""Afghan Star"" production, for example, the documentary cameras take us back stage to show the Afghan network-TV crew toggling together what looks like a jumbled pile of scrap electrical components they've found to run their lights and cameras.But ... You'll sit there through the whole thing fascinated by the window it opens into this mountainous country where we've been at war for so many years. I came away from the film deeply worried for the future of women and young people in Afghanistan. But I also came away greatly encouraged at the bravery and creative spirit of these young men and women delivering ""Afghan Star"" into families' living rooms whether they own big Kabul homes---or they're wiring a makeshift aerial on the roof of a mud hut in the mountains.Maybe Americans could learn a few things from the grassroots campaigning Afghans eagerly wage for their stars on this hit TV show! Unlike ""American Idol,"" there's very serious campaigning underway in Afghanistan. One reason is that the entertainers are chosen from across the country and represent many different ethnic groups. So Afghans from children to old men crisscross their regions, handing out simply made posters and handbills--urging Afghans to pick up their cell phones and vote for regional singers. It's amazing footage. Every American civics class should show ""Afghan Star"" to teach our youth something about the infectious power of democracy.We're not alone in recommending it. The film already has received praise from Oprah, Jon Stewart and the Sundance film festival among others. Enjoy it with friends.",5,Pop Culture Shows Us the Daring Search for Democracy in Afghanistan,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,2149,"['peace', 'semblance', 'democracy', 'possible', 'Afghanistan', 'there', 'value', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'Filmmaker', 'Havana', 'Marking', 'startling', 'documentary', 'Afghan', 'Star', 'Big', 'Questions', '-along', 'way', '-she', ""'d"", 'never', 'imagine', 'here', 'U.S', 'documentary', 'debut', 'season', 'Afghan', 'network', 'TV', 'clone', 'American', 'Idol', 'can', 'chuckle', 'quality', 'make-shift', 'Afghan', 'pop', 'culture', '-such', 'years', 'Taliban', 'warfare', 'new', 'pop', 'culture', 'often', 'pretty', 'basic', 'stuff', 'one', 'Afghan', 'Star', 'production', 'example', 'documentary', 'cameras', 'take', 'back', 'stage', 'show', 'Afghan', 'network-TV', 'crew', 'toggling', 'together', 'what', 'jumbled', 'pile', 'scrap', 'electrical', 'components', ""'ve"", 'found', 'run', 'lights', 'cameras.But', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'fascinated', 'window', 'mountainous', 'country', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'war', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'came', 'away', 'film', 'deeply', 'worried', 'future', 'women', 'young', 'people', 'Afghanistan', 'also', 'came', 'away', 'greatly', 'encouraged', 'bravery', 'creative', 'spirit', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'delivering', 'Afghan', 'Star', 'families', 'living', 'rooms', 'own', 'big', 'Kabul', 'homes', ""'re"", 'wiring', 'makeshift', 'aerial', 'roof', 'mud', 'hut', 'mountains.Maybe', 'Americans', 'could', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'grassroots', 'campaigning', 'Afghans', 'eagerly', 'wage', 'stars', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'American', 'Idol', 'very', 'serious', 'campaigning', 'underway', 'Afghanistan', 'One', 'reason', 'entertainers', 'are', 'chosen', 'country', 'represent', 'many', 'different', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'So', 'Afghans', 'children', 'old', 'men', 'crisscross', 'regions', 'handing', 'out', 'simply', 'made', 'posters', 'handbills', 'urging', 'Afghans', 'pick', 'up', 'cell', 'phones', 'vote', 'regional', 'singers', 'amazing', 'footage', 'Every', 'American', 'civics', 'class', 'should', 'show', 'Afghan', 'Star', 'teach', 'youth', 'something', 'infectious', 'power', 'democracy.We', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'recommending', 'film', 'already', 'received', 'praise', 'Oprah', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Sundance', 'film', 'festival', 'others', 'Enjoy', 'friends']",Afghan Star

The quality of the acts was much less than that of the American brand but their enthusiasm was infectious.  I was really getting a kick out of this documentary, until a woman contestant defied tradition.  And the results wiped the smile off of my face immediately.  As much as I would like for it not to be so, there are very serious differences between our societies, and very serious consequences to defying traditions in some of these third world countries.",4,"Afganistan's version of ""American Idol""",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,611,"['Initially', 'found', 'really', 'watch', 'confirmed', 'preconception', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'matter', 'where', 'come', 'quality', 'acts', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'American', 'brand', 'enthusiasm', 'was', 'infectious', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'kick', 'documentary', 'woman', 'contestant', 'defied', 'tradition', 'results', 'wiped', 'smile', 'face', 'immediately', 'As', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'differences', 'societies', 'very', 'serious', 'consequences', 'defying', 'traditions', 'third', 'world', 'countries']",Afghan Star

Yes, its not really a U.S. problem with what goes on in Afghanistan but who else is going to come along and help the Afghan people if not the U.S.A.?The Afghan people are a strong bunch who have survived way too many years of wars. A lot of their hardship could have been avoided if foreign powers had not meddled so much with the country and used it as a battlefield for a proxy-war.This film shows us how the Afghan people want music and desperately wish to express themselves democratically. The bravery of women participating the Afghan Star contest is astounding. In a country where people think its o.k. to kill a woman just because she danced a bit on a stage, I found this movie remarkable.The film is very honest, shows us exactly how life is in Afghanistan and is very accurate in expressing the feelings of its people towards this new 'American Idol' type contest.Just a few decades ago, Afghanistan was a not-so-bad place.

1315574,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0030OJPO0,stoic,"[0, 0]","I didn't have high hopes for the documentary Afghan Star, but I really enjoyed it. The story is simple - freed from the Taliban, Afghanis launch their own version of American Idol called Afghan Star. The show becomes a huge hit, with up to one-third of the population watching. More importantly, Afghanis' reactions to the show reveal much about their culture and about human nature.The documentary focuses on four contestants - two men and two women. All four are interesting, decent people and the viewer cheers for them. Western viewers will probably be most interested in the plight of the women, who must contend with Afghanis' ""traditional"" attitudes about the proper role of women. One woman - Setara - sets of a firestorm of controversy by dancing and showing her hair during her one of her performances.Afghan Star is both educational and entertaining.

This film presented a more relatable side to Afghanis through their enjoyment of pop music and the popularity of Afghan Star. I learned Afghanistan has different tribes and nations - such as Pashtuns, Hazara etc. I learned that when the Taliban ruled, dancing, music, and TVs were banned. During that time, men could not shave their beards or comb their hair.I can see Afghanistan is still a very conservative country. Poor Setara, her life is in danger just because she uncovered her hair a little bit and danced to music!This is a good film.
