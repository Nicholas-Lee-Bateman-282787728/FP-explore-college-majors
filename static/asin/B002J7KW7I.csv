And it became a reality when I became a performer. I can remember as I grew older and learning the ballet I loved so much as a child, I felt like a real princess.I miss it.Only now, I have a daughter who loves nothing more then to go in her room, put on her tutu, and practice the ballet steps she taught herself from a book. We plan on placing her in dance lessons soon, but right now, money is tight. Until then, she can only dream of the day she'll be able to dance on stage in a ballet as beautiful as The Nutcracker.That's why I was overjoyed to find out about a little treasure called Prima Princessa. These DVD's were created for the young and aspiring ballerina princess. Created by two amazing mamas, Mary Kate Mellow and Stephanie Troeller, who are on a mission to bring the magic and beauty of ballet to young children everywhere.I was privileged enough to review Prima Princessa Presents The Nutcracker for my own prima princessa. This DVD would make a wonderful holiday gift for any little girl! In all it's charm, it features England's famous Birmingham Royal Ballet performing the Christmas classic The Nutcracker. Filled with magical snow fairies, dancing mice, and toy soldiers, this ballet is a timeless treasure to share with your little girl. The DVD has a cartoon fairy that flutters around, narrating the ballet to help young children understand the story.In between each act, your little ones will be able to dance along! With their new fairy friend, students from New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet, and other tutu clad children, they will learn and practice classic ballet steps, such as first position, glissade, passe, and more.little girl dress up,dress up little girl,ballerina,ballet tutusWith plenty of fun bonus features, your royal ballerina will join in a holiday party, freeze dancing, crafts, and cookie decorating!This truly was an adorable DVD.

They love to dance their own dance style, so I was thinking that they would enjoy this, but I was amazed as they started to watch how much they were engaged in the film.Both of my girls had their eyes glued to the television and as they watched they loved trying out the dances that they were being taught. As an educator myself, I loved seeing the educational components within the film. This education was a true creative arts gem. It provided the opportunity for kids to not only learn about dance, but also about music and themselves.My kids have been told the story of the nutcracker in the past, but they have never seen the ballet itself, so this was an extra special treat for them.

But with a few added bonuses.  They show lots of scenes from the real ballet, but explain what is happening to make it easy for little ones to follow along. And in between scenes, they show your little ballerina how to do some of the dance steps themselves, which really makes them feel like they are a part of it.

I was so enamored with it as a little girl that I signed up for ballet one year just so I could play a part in it! I have missed seeing it since I moved away from home and hope to take Amber some day.Because of all that I was really excited to get to review Prima Princessa Presents the Nutcracker. It provided me a way to show Amber The Nutcracker in a way that was fun and easy for her to understand at her age now! She loved dancing along to it (as you can see!) and I was impressed with the gorgeous costumes & scenery during the ballet which I guess is not surprising considering it's the Birmingham Royal Ballet preforming. Like the other Prima Princessa DVD the breaks were cute and fun and Amber and I both really enjoyed it! This would make a perfect Christmas gift and you can't beat the $6.99 price tag!!!
