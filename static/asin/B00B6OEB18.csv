1622508,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00B6OEB18,a,"[0, 1]","I have seen several of these typical action/crime independent films released by Anchor Bay.  They usually follow a set formula, clocking in at just under 90 minutes and featuring a pretty decent array of actors in what is usually a character-driven piece. I usually enjoy them for what they are, such as ""Kill the Irishman"" and""Sinners and Saints,"" and ""Pawn"" is no exception. It delivered exactly what was expected, no more and no less.My one sentence review would be: ""Pawn"" is the story of a diner robbery gone wrong, with betrayals, miscommunication, and characters that you can't trust.  It actually reminded me very much of a film that Kevin Spacey directed called ""Albino Alligator."" However, that film was more straightforward and dialogue-driven while ""Pawn"" tries to be more violent, more edgy, and ultimately drifts into predictability and implausibility.I will say that the cast is very strong. Like most of the releases I've seen from Anchor Bay, this boasts a surprising number of recognizable faces for an independent production. I was particularly impressed by the malevolence of Michael Chiklis and Ray Liotta, while Sean Faris seemed to be channeling a young Tom Cruise.  This really is an ensemble piece, allowing each of the characters to shine individually. The only exception might be Forest Whitaker, whose screen time is severely limited.  It was nice to see him turn up in a production like this, even if only for about five minutes.  It's worth noting that like most Anchor Bay releases, this DVD includes one special feature: 25 minute behind-the-scenes documentary that is surprisingly insightful and features comments from most of the cast members.""Pawn"" is probably worth a rental for a Friday or Saturday evening at home, although I doubt I'll be revisiting it any time soon. It's an okay movie, a mild distraction, but don't expect too much from it, despite the good casting.",4,"A typical, well-cast thriller",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1907,"['have', 'seen', 'several', 'typical', 'action/crime', 'independent', 'films', 'released', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'usually', 'follow', 'set', 'formula', 'clocking', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'featuring', 'pretty', 'decent', 'array', 'actors', 'what', 'usually', 'character-driven', 'piece', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'such', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'Sinners', 'Saints', 'Pawn', 'exception', 'delivered', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'more', 'less.My', 'one', 'sentence', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'Pawn', 'story', 'diner', 'robbery', 'gone', 'wrong', 'betrayals', 'miscommunication', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'actually', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'directed', 'called', 'Albino', 'Alligator', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'straightforward', 'dialogue-driven', 'Pawn', 'be', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'edgy', 'ultimately', 'drifts', 'predictability', 'implausibility.I', 'will', 'say', 'cast', 'very', 'strong', 'most', 'releases', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'surprising', 'number', 'recognizable', 'independent', 'production', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'malevolence', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'seemed', 'be', 'channeling', 'young', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'really', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'allowing', 'characters', 'shine', 'individually', 'only', 'exception', 'might', 'be', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'screen', 'time', 'severely', 'limited', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'turn', 'up', 'production', 'even', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'worth', 'noting', 'most', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'one', 'special', 'feature', '25', 'minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'surprisingly', 'insightful', 'comments', 'most', 'cast', 'members', 'Pawn', 'probably', 'worth', 'rental', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'home', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'revisiting', 'time', 'soon', 'okay', 'movie', 'mild', 'distraction', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'casting']",N/A

But things are not what you think? The title of the movie is 'Pawn' so who is going to take the fall for this one?I enjoyed the storyline, the acting (I just love Michael Chiklis in this film!) and even though others say the ending just didn't hold up for them I thought it tied things up rather nicely.

Great acting by some well known and not-so well known actors, with stories interwoven in such a way that it holds your interest the entire way through.Good cops, bad cops, reformed thugs and in the moment predators all collide at an all-night diner. There's no doubt it's going to get bloody, but what's it really all for?  Just a quick hold up for jewelry and cash?  Nah... there's more at stake than that, and the innocents caught in the middle struggle to understand and survive.I'd recommend this film based upon Michael Chiklis' Irish accent alone! (Maybe it was English?  Whatever... liked it.)  Ray Liotta is basically 'Good Fellas' gone gray, but hey, it's Ray.  Forest Whitaker did a great job in his small role, and the supporting cast was outstanding.This isn't one you'll want to get up and get popcorn in the middle of, as you'll 'miss it' for sure.Nicely crafted, and while violent, enjoyably so.

Too violent, confusing, had no point.  Then I decided to watch it again: ""Who was the pawn""?  The second viewing started to make sense,from the opening credits' checkerboard / chess  floor, to the running game of chess between the manager and late-shift cop. Pawn twists and turns with many flashbacks and characters.  Almost everyone inside the diner, and some outside ordering SWAT, are corrupt.  No one involved can trust anyone, and isn't that the problem with corruption?  Only Nick (Sean Faris), just out of jail, is trying to reform.  He uses his mercurial wits and in the end does not adhere to the mess of the other players.  Great cast, especially Faris and Ray Liotta.  Liotta collects 18th Century death clocks.  Pawn's analogy of the process of producing beautiful gold-plated objects by gilding common metals with a mixture of gold and mercury and then burning off the mercury in extreme heat until only the gold remained and adhered to the common metal, is quite applicable.  Here Nick (Faris) is the mercury these criminals want to burn off as they try to pin every botched move on him as they struggle to end up with the golden veneer. I've seen it three times now and like this movie more and more every time. Also the credits at the end of the film done to a rap song-push back are like a little gem of a chess game. Every move is a game changer.

A shoot out in a hotel parking lot and no one seems to notice.- The bad guys exit from the diner is totally lame (I would say more but don't want to ruin it).- What happens with the bad cop is also lame because none of the other cops seemed to notice.- The movie ended with a WTF moment.  Loose ends left unresolved.- The first take of what happened is dumped and another story takes over.  I still don't understand what that was all about.- The pawn made a phone call to the police but they didn't show up for quite a while even though Forest Whitaker was right there.So, for me it had the potential to be better.

This movie doesn't self-consciously try to ape Quentin Tarantino like that one, but overall it isn't much better.  It's a muddled robbery/hostage story that on the whole isn't that great.Like many of these movies nowadays the timeline is all jumbled up to try to make it seem more like a puzzle.  Basically a guy named Nick gets out of jail and ends up at this diner owned by the Russian mob on the night that a crew of Brits led by Michael Chiklis (who incidentally is not British) rob the place.  But things go wrong and soon it turns into a hostage situation.The movie left me with several questions.  Such as:  the Russian mob is in Hartford?  And why is a crew of British guys hanging around there?  If you wanted British robbers why did you hire Michael Chiklis?  Are British actors too busy playing American superheroes for a project like this?  Why is the Russian gangster always wearing that ascot?  Does he have a horrible scar or tattoo under there?  Could they find a worse rapper-actor than Common to play the negotiator?  What was the point of Ray Liotta's ""Man in the Suit"" character?  What's with Forest Whitaker's left eye?

1622516,A23R3EOZ837242,B00B6OEB18,"Colin Brown ""Colin Brown Microsoft MVP""","[0, 0]","Pawn revolves around one character who just got released from a stint in prison for Grand Theft Auto, goes to a diner to meet his brother and ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time.The movie jumps around a little, from the present which is the holdup in the diner, to the past where you learn about events leading up to the holdup.  Each time the movie jumps to the events leading up to the holdup, some new piece of information falls into place and a new plot twist evolves.  This actually works really well and has been woven into the movie in a very good fashion.  It's hard to get too much into the details without giving it away suffice to say that with each new plot twist, it really draws you in and what you thought was a standard holdup definately is not.The acting in Pawn is generally very good with an excellent performance by Michael Chiklis showing just how much of a bad guy he can be. I was hoping to see more of Ray Liotta as the gangster as I think he's an excellent actor but although its not a bit part, its a side part so you don't get to see too much of him.The ending of the movie however is very ho hum.  With all the plot twists there could have been any number of endings but it all seemed to finish very quickly and the director took the most direct and probably least enjoyable out of the plethora of options he had.  Perhaps the movie was running out of budget?Overall it's a good movie. Not the best I've seen in a while but certainly enjoyable to watch and it hooks you in, but the last 10 minutes are a let down.

One of the highlights was Forest Whitaker but I was disappointed with how small his role was. There were twists and turns but these plot devices were a mixed blend swinging from being purposely illogical, plain obfuscation and even silliness. It seemed odd to have an English gang working in the US and the significance of this was never specified. The crooks were doing bad things though there was no sense of true evil which offended me. The bad guys were just being bad guys, all in a day's work. The diner patrons were horrible actors though to be fair it would be hard to play a mute or mostly mute victim of a long drawn out crime.Some of the acting wasn't bad. There were some big name character actors who did what they do and they did it well. They didn't have much of a script to work with and the dichotomy between the A list actors vs. the bit part players was stark. A few of the minor cop actors looked truly lost about why they were tasked with speaking the lines they'd been asked to deliver.

Armstrong is usually known for working behind-the-scenes as a cameraman for the ""Saw"" films but this time, the cinematographer becomes a director for the film ""Pawn"" written by Jay Anthony White (""Project 313&#8243;).The independent film features an all-star cast which include Forest Whitaker (""Platoon"", ""The Last King of Scotland"", ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai""), Ray Liotta (""Goodfellas"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""Hannibal""), Michael Chiklis (""The Commish"", ""The Shield"", ""Fantastic Four"" films), Nikki Reed (""Twilight"" films, ""Chain Letter""), Martin Csokas (""Lord of the Rings"" films, ""XXX""), Sean Faris (""Never Back Down"", ""Freerunner""), Jessica Szohr (""Gossip Girl"", ""Piranha""), Stephen Lang (""Avatar"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""The Men Who Star at Goats"") and Common (""Wanted"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""Terminator Salvation"").VIDEO:""Pawn"" is presented in 1080p high Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The majority of the film takes place in a diner and while picture quality is good and details are also good during close-ups, aside from detail of clothing textures, the scenes definitely look a bit on warm side.  But for the most part, picture quality in HD is very good and cinematographer Keith Dunkerley (""Paranormal Activity 3&#8243;, ""Matchstick Men"") did a good job on focusing more on character reactions, closeups and capturing the emotions of the characters.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Pawn"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  While the film is primarily dialogue driven, there are some scenes which showcase gunshots and sirens and are better utilized through the surround channels.  But for the most part, ""Pawn"" is a dialogue-driven film and is primarily front and center-channel driven. The lossless soundtrack was good but not immersive as most of the film focuses more on dialogue.Subtitles are in English and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Pawn"" comes with the following special features:Pawn: Behind the Scenes  - (23:08) Interviews with the cast of ""Pawn"" and discussions about their character and working on with the other star talents in the film.EXTRAS:""Pawn"" comes with both the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Usually when it comes to films with a large cast and involves a holdup, I realize there have been quite a few of those storylines on television.From the 2007 TV series ""The Nine"" about how a group of people are dealing with life after being held hostage inside a bank and also being accused of assisting the gunmen, to the 2008 film fragments which starred Forest Whitaker about a group of individuals who were in a diner having a normal day until a gunman came inside and started shooting people for no reason before killing himself and how others dealt with the post-traumatic stress.While there have been TV series and films about holdups, fortunately with David A. Armstrong and Jay Anthony White's ""Pawn"", what appears to be a normal hold up of a diner turns out to be two crimes being committed at the same time.One features three gunmen trying to steal money from the safe, while another group of bad police officers who are trying to steal a harddrive from the safe with incriminating evidence of corrupt police officers.And your protagonist is not some John McClane ""Die Hard"" bad ass but a young man named Nick who just got out of prison after serving time for stealing cars.  Now trying to be a father and not committing any more crimes and following the path on the right side of the law.But Nick ends up becoming the point contact between the police and the gunmen and not knowing exactly what the details are of these gunmen, the corrupted police officers think these gunmen are going after the harddrive and thus, they think Nick, a convicted felon is working with the gunmen, so the corrupted police officers kidnap his pregnant wife.Suffice to say, the film has several twist and turns and while not a high budget film and shot primarily inside a diner, the film makes up with a large number of talent.  Immediately looking at the cast list, you see names such as Ray Liotta (as always the mysterious character on the wrong side of the law), Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker, Michael Chiklis (who spent years playing the good guy, now a British bank robber), hip hop artist Common, Stephen Lang, Nikki Reed, Jessica Szohr and many more.So, the film is practically an exciting, enjoyable popcorn action drama that doesn't become too violent, nor does it try to do too much. It keeps things simple with a few twists along the way.  If I had any problems with the film was its use of talent.  For those expecting to see a lot of Forest Whitaker, unfortunately, you're not going to see much of him.There are also some plot holes in which I felt there was something building up for the character of Porter (portrayed by Common) and possibly a confrontation with Lt. Barnes.  The ending is played out a bit too safely for me, but it was appropriate and I think audiences will be happy with the overall film.As for the Blu-ray release, for an indie film, there is good detail when it comes to clothing textures and close-ups.  While picture quality is good, the lossless soundtrack is primarily dialogue-driven with a few moments of gunshots and ambiance coming through the surround channels.  And you get one ""making of"" special feature.  Also, as an extra, you also get both the Blu-ray release and a DVD version of the film.Overall, ""Pawn"" is a film that is an exciting crime drama that could have been bloody and serious, but sometimes you don't need to be that banal or violent and try to give something different, yet enjoyable for the audience.  While not the best robbery film made, nor the worst, ""Pawn"" is an indie crime drama that features an all-star cast and for the most part is enjoyable and a solid directorial debut for cameraman turned filmmaker David A.

'Pawn' really is a terse thriller, detailing what initially looks like a simple robbery gone wrong, as it unfolds into a much larger plan through the course of the film.  All of the actors bring their A-game and the dialog doesn't offer too much fluff.At times, the plot seems to get ahead of itself, as some actions don't seem totally natural, and some obvious tells (to the audience) go completely ignored by the characters on screen.  Also, Michael Chiklis is forced to deliver a Cockney accent which seems forced into the film to add some flavor.

1622524,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00B6OEB18,Drew from Oregon,"[0, 2]","This review contains spoilers.  I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this movie to review.Pawn is a thriller that has a whole list of well-known actors including Forest Whitaker, Michael Chiklis, Ray Liotta, Common, Nikki Reed, Marton Csokas, and Sean Faris among others.  It is a movie that will keep some entrenched, while it will bore others.  The movie seems to be a bit ""schizophrenic"" as bits and pieces of the story are added and changed throughout the movie, which makes it a bit hard to follow at times.The movie starts out with Will (Forest Whitaker), a cop, walking into a diner where he knows most of the people.  He can tell right away something is awry and people are acting strangely.  It turns out that he had walked in on a robbery in progress as we see someone, who turns out to be Derrick (Michael Chiklis), hiding behind the counter with a shotgun.  Some events unfold and it really doesn't show the outcome of this situation.The man in the suit (Ray Liotta), is seen at a hospital asking someone questions as to what went down at the diner.  The person he is questioning tells his part of the story.  It is at this point where we can see how the robbery started when the thugs barged in.  They were there to get something out of the safe, which had a timed lock on it, so they had to wait at the diner.  While the thugs were waiting for the time to come around, this is when Will walks in on them; however, the robbers tell everyone to act normal.  This version of events is a bit different from what is shown at the beginning of the movie as we see Will getting killed by Derrick and Derrick also gets the money as well.Cops bust into Derricks house and Lt. Barnes (Marton Csokas) asks Derrick for a favor.  Right away, we can tell that Lt. Barnes is behind this robbery attempt.  Lt. Barnes tells Derrick there is a hard drive with names on it and that hard drive is being stored at the diner in the safe.  The original plan was to go in at two minutes until midnight so they can make it a quick robbery attempt, but Derrick wanted to get some stuff of his own, so they go in thirty minutes early.  This is another bit of the story that is added that we didn't know before.  We also see a scene where Derrick takes the hard drive out of the safe.SWAT shows up at the diner and now the people who were inside are hostages.  Jeff (Common), a negotiator, talks with Derrick and, eventually, Derrick decides to let a hostage out.  Derrick gets Nick (Sean Faris), a former criminal, to walk a hostage out, but he has to go back into the diner or someone will get shot.  After seeing Nick, the police think Nick is behind the whole situation as they saw that he was a criminal convicted of theft.  Derrick also sends Nick out to talk with the cops and give them his demands, thus, further giving the cops more reason to think Nick is behind it.The man in the suit then interrogates Nick's pregnant wife.  Nick's wife tells the man in the suit that he was just going to the diner to meet with his brother, which we see a scene of in the movie, thus, giving us more of the storyline.  We see Nick going into the bathroom to splash water on his face and that's where he was when the robbery started.  The man in the suit calls the diner so Nick's wife can speak with him.  After talking with his wife, Nick then talks with the man in the suit.  The man in the suit tells Nick that he has 30 minutes to get the hard drive back in the safe or he won't see his wife again.Lt. Barnes, who was behind some of it, gives his officers the orders to kill everyone, including Nick, in the diner to clean up the mess.  When going outside to check on one of the demands, Nick gets shot by one of the policemen.  After this, Derrick implements his ""plan B"", which no one knows about, but it was really a plan for him to get out by himself.  Under his coat, he was wearing Will's bloody uniform and he acted like he was a hurt cop, so no one shot him.  He was able to steal a car and escape.Lt. Barnes finds out that Nick was just a pawn and the hard drive is still out there.  Nick realizes that he was being played as well and, while riding in the back of an ambulance, he jumps out and escapes.  Nick runs to the hotel where Derrick was at and breaks into Derrick's car and takes the hard drive.  Derrick went back outside with a couple of guys looking for the hard drive and, when he realized it wasn't in the car, he got killed.  As for the hard drive, Nick gave it to his brother, who works in Internal Affairs, and, now, Nick is in the clear and he can go on with his life.Overall, Pawn wasn't too bad of a movie, but it could have been better.  It was hard for me to follow at times and, I can see other people having trouble following it as well.

You could even say there's even a little bit ofMarathon Manthrown in for fun! What begins as a pretty straightforward hostage situation @  a diner turns into an awful day for the bad guys, an even worse day for the (supposed?) good guys and the worst-day-ever for the poor people caught in the middle of it all.The story centers around a Joe Nobody who is manipulated by people on both sides of the legal fence.  They're all convinced that he knows something, but he doesn't.  Everyone thinks that he's the center-of-gravity of what is going on, even though he isn't.  One would think that he can trust the cops, but in this film there are police officers who have renounced their oaths of public service and have become nefarious and untrustworthy.What he's left with is himself.  Nobody else;  just his own devices.  Can he outwith the bad guys, the cops, the fed and the bad cops?  He'd better do so if he wants to survive.  After all, the thugs in this movie aren't exactly Rhodes Scholars, but what they do excel at is being ruthless.For such an obscure project, the cast of this DVD is quite impressive.  It's obviously something that the big hitters in the cast (Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, etc) wanted to be a part of an ambitious production more than they were hoping to make a lot of $$.  {According to the Special Features, this was a low budget movie that was filmed in about 2wks time}So, if you're a fan of movies that are made like omelets & films with plenty of twists & turns, then this one would be a good addition to your DVD collection.

1622526,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00B6OEB18,E. David Swan,"[0, 1]","I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get with these direct to DVD movies even when they include top notch talent like Ray Liotta, Michael Chicklis and of course Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is one of my all time favorite actors but his appearance in a film is no guarantee that a film is good however in this case the film is one of the best direct to DVD film I've seen in quite some time.Pawn is about a young con just release from prison, crooked cops, lots of crooked cops, a mob boss, mistaken identity, a severely botched robbery and a hard drive. The details of the plot are kinda irrelevant and things often happen just to push the plot forward. The strength of the film is in the acting and it's almost universally well done. The one glaring weak performance is hip hop artist Common. Why so many direct to DVD films use hip hop artists is beyond me. They all seem to suffer from the same affliction; a serious lack of energy and a delivery like they're reading straight from the script. Although Common is in a decent amount of the movie his character could have been cut without harming the story. In fact one of the flaws of the film is excessive characters.Forest Whitaker gives a great but all too brief performance. I could probably watch the man give a performance where he changes the oil on a car and still enjoy it. The standout in the film has got to be Michael Chicklis sporting a rather convincing aussie accept. At least he sounded Australian to me despite someone saying he was British. Ray Liotta is separated from the rest of the action but I still enjoyed his performance.The budget is kept low by having nearly the entire film in a single restaurant. There is action but not a ton and the effects appeared to be practical effects rather than the stupid CGI blood that seems popular these days. I might be wrong about the effects but if they were CGI they were much more subtle than other films I've seen lately. The director did an effective job of making characters both believable and for the victims sympathetic creating real tension when it looked as if a character might be killed. There are occasions where the film gets a little goofy particularly in the latter second half but overall I give it high marks grading it against other direct to DVD films and I don't regret watching it at all.",4,An Admirable Direct to DVD Effort,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2324,"[""'m"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movies', 'even', 'when', 'include', 'top', 'notch', 'talent', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Michael', 'Chicklis', 'course', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Whitaker', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'appearance', 'film', 'guarantee', 'film', 'good', 'however', 'case', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'direct', 'DVD', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time.Pawn', 'young', 'con', 'just', 'release', 'prison', 'crooked', 'cops', 'lots', 'crooked', 'cops', 'mob', 'boss', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'severely', 'botched', 'robbery', 'hard', 'drive', 'details', 'plot', 'are', 'kinda', 'irrelevant', 'things', 'often', 'happen', 'just', 'push', 'plot', 'forward', 'strength', 'film', 'acting', 'almost', 'universally', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'glaring', 'weak', 'performance', 'hip', 'hop', 'artist', 'Common', 'Why', 'so', 'many', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'use', 'hip', 'hop', 'seem', 'suffer', 'same', 'affliction', 'serious', 'lack', 'energy', 'delivery', ""'re"", 'reading', 'straight', 'script', 'Common', 'decent', 'amount', 'movie', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'harming', 'story', 'fact', 'one', 'flaws', 'film', 'excessive', 'characters.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'great', 'too', 'brief', 'performance', 'could', 'probably', 'watch', 'man', 'give', 'performance', 'where', 'oil', 'car', 'still', 'enjoy', 'standout', 'film', 'got', 'be', 'Michael', 'Chicklis', 'sporting', 'rather', 'convincing', 'aussie', 'accept', 'least', 'sounded', 'Australian', 'someone', 'saying', 'was', 'British', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'separated', 'rest', 'action', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'performance.The', 'budget', 'kept', 'low', 'having', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'single', 'restaurant', 'action', 'not', 'ton', 'effects', 'appeared', 'be', 'practical', 'effects', 'rather', 'stupid', 'CGI', 'blood', 'popular', 'days', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'effects', 'were', 'CGI', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'director', 'did', 'effective', 'job', 'making', 'characters', 'believable', 'victims', 'sympathetic', 'creating', 'real', 'tension', 'when', 'looked', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'killed', 'are', 'occasions', 'where', 'film', 'little', 'goofy', 'particularly', 'latter', 'second', 'half', 'overall', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'grading', 'other', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching']",N/A

1622528,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B00B6OEB18,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[1, 2]","Get ready to take notes if you decide to view this movie.To start with, a cop goes into an all-night diner....Sounds like the lead-in for a joke, but this is anything but a laughy movie. An effort that went straight from conception and execution to DVD, it is worthy of viewing if only for the stellar cast involved. Ray Liotta. Stephen Lang. Forest Whitaker, who should draw viewers all by himself. Ronald Guttman, a great character actor who pops up with some regularity in various projects all the way back to ""The Hunt For Red October"", and whom people know they've seen but can't place. And Michael Chiklis, who doubles as a producer. You can't get a better cast.The story is built more or less around one person involved - Nick, a young man who has just done time for car theft. Played by Sean Faris (attention casting directors; should you need a young Tom Cruise, or a son of Tom Cruise, or any other close relative of Tom Cruise in any upcoming movie, here's your guy), Nick has vowed to plow the straight-and-narrow from here on, promising his pregnant wife that he will never again run afoul of the law. He just happens to be in the all-night diner when all hell breaks loose. Or did he 'just happen' to be there?Any divulging of events would likely screw some parts of the plot for anyone wishing to draw their own conclusions, so I won't get into details; I will warn those of delicate sensibilities that there is blood, violence, and language galour, but in the interests of the story one would have to get past that. The acting here is excellent, with a few unexplained red herrings; why is Chiklis, who plays a robber, portrayed as a Brit? In fact, why are ALL the bad guys cast as Brits? (Even a corrupt cop on this fictional Hartford, CT police force is a Brit.) Chiklis does an admirable job of an English accent, which would probably be accepted by everybody but actual Brits (a few too many pat ""Bollocks""-type Englishisms for me, but that's a small point), but the real story is the convoluted, impenetrable plot. Who's who? What is the actual objective? The biggest question for me is who the shadowy Man In The Suit - played by Ray Liotta - actually is. (I have to admit, I got the movie for him alone. That ravaged, cold-eyed face has intrigued me for decades.)There are a few throwaway bits. The formerly-hip-hop-artist Common is poorly served in a role that goes nowhere. He is a good actor, most recently seen in ""Hell On Wheels"", and deserves better shrift than he gets here as a negotiator. Similarly, the viewer never really gets a grip on the youngest member of the hit squad, Nigel (Cameron Denny).  Stephen Lang plays a role completely out of character of what we are used to; he is certainly no Sargeant of Avatar here, but pulls off the portrayal of a frail older manager pretty well. For whatever reason, many players are uncredited, amongst them the aforementioned Ronald Guttman, who doesn't have a lot of physical schtick in the production but does a good job of playing cool and collected.This was a tense, dark movie, so full of twists and turns that you really do need a scorecard to keep track of everything that's going on. There aren't any slow moments, so even if this has all been done before in different computations, it won't bore the avid viewer of cops-and-robbers-type movies.

That is a very weird thing given who is in it and the type of movie it is. I love the actors here and this kind of flick is one of my favorites. Director David Armstrong and writer Jay White did an excellent job with this film as I was into it the entire time. I am really glad I got the opportunity to check this flick out.The film opens with a cop walking into a dinner late one night. Once there things seem a little out of place and the people are acting a little weird. Turns out this officer has walked right into the middle of a robbery. Now the synopsis says that ""what happens next and what happened before you won't believe"" if I am remembering that right. Well I very much agree with that because there are some twists and turns that while some you see coming all are very interesting.The cast for this film is great with a lot of known and big names, but that means nothing if they aren't great performances. Well everyone here did a great job especially Michael Chiklis as the lead robber, as did his fellow robbers. Then of course we have Forest Whitaker who really surprised me here, I mean the character not his acting [great as always]. We also have Ray Liotta and Common amongst others, both very different characters. I could go on and on but I will just say that no one disappointed hereI have to say this was a very good movie and I should not have been surprised. Looking at the cast and even the synopsis will tell you all you need to know. This was a great independent low budget flick that did not disappoint.

Neighborhood terrorists. 88 minutes that gets your heart thumping in the first minute and maintains the tenseness till the final sixty seconds. It's wicked brutality, in your face violent, and certainly not for children. Not for adults with sensitivities against coarse language and complete disrespect for life.The award-winning cast gets kudos all-round for making this film seem real. Even when the final credits roll you'll be asking yourself and those viewing with you exactly who were the bad guys and who were the good guys, bad cops -good cops, guilty -innocent. Better NOT watch this alone.This amazing story of one night of terror jumps back and forth from the situational event, the activity leading up to the botched robbery, and events after the caf&eacute; was charged. Some terrific writing went into the telling. Due to the storyline there is never a moment without clutching suspense and frightful eminent action.This one could keep you awake at night.

He's begging his wife Amanda (gorgeous Nikki Reed of ""The Twilight Saga"" [The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2)] to give him a second chance.  During his first night of freedom, Nick becomes trapped in a diner that is being robbed by blood-thirsty Derrick [rugged Michael Chiklis of ""Fantastic Four"" [Fantastic Four / Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer [Blu-ray]]] and two fellow thugs.  As a SWAT team descends upon the diner and the body count rises, Nick, because of his criminal record, is set up by crooked cops to become the ultimate pawn who takes all the blame.Despite annoying flashbacks that sometimes hinder the plot, ""Pawn"" is an enjoyable crime drama that is extremely tense.  My girlfriend, Tammy, and her parents watched it with me and we were all kept on the edge of our seats throughout the entire film.  I feared for the lives of the innocent hostages.  There was a tremendous amount of shocking violence.  It soon became clear that Derrick was the villain/antagonist and Nick was the hero/protagonist.  Unfortunately, in this film, the bad characters outnumber the good ones.  To make matters worse, the viewer doesn't know the identity of all the evil doers.  The movie's tagline is correct when it states, ""If you want to live, trust no one.""""Pawn's"" cast of veteran actors and rising stars is most excellent.  Everyone, including the lead characters and the extras, gave superb, believable performances.  Concerning the script, absent were an overabundance of sexual perversion and foul language that are often found in crime dramas.  All the focus was on the bloody, tense events surrounding the hostage situation.  ""Pawn"" is David A. Armstrong's excellent directorial debut.  The DVD's interesting featurette, ""Behind the Scenes,"" consists of mostly interviews of cast members who praise Armstrong's professional directorial skills.While analyzing ""Pawn,"" I asked myself, what is the purpose of this film, other than to instill a fear that we may one day find ourselves surrounded by crooked cops?  The film consists of two teams--one headed by the evil Derrick and the other headed by the good Nick.  Derrick's team falls apart because it is held together by the greed and lust for money, which is fleeting.  Nick's team, consisting of his wife and brother, is held together by hope---the hope that love will always persevere, that love will get us out of any hostage-like situation that life may cruelly throw us into.  For this reason, I highly recommend ""Pawn"" for all fans of provocative crime drama.Joseph B.

Chambers,"[2, 2]","Knowing that Pawn was released directly to DVD, my expectations weren't too high, but the cast looked very solid, so I invested an hour and a half in the movie. I don't regret it a bit. This was a barnburner of a story, with plenty of blood but nothing too gory, and a surprise twist around every corner. Like other nonlinear films, the scenes are shown out of sequence, but unlike some of those films, it's never hopelessly confusing. I didn't have to watch it again to figure out what really happened.The cast made the story work so well. Michael Chiklis was superb as a vicious gangster holding up a late-night diner (and check out his great British accent). Forest Whitaker is the cop who comes in to play a little chess with the manager. He catches on to the robbers, all hell breaks loose, and the scene suddenly shifts to a hospital room where Ray Liotta is questioning a patient who was in the diner. And in my opinion, this may be Liotta's finest performance since Goodfellas.What you think you see isn't always what's really happening, which makes Pawn a fun film to watch, with all the twists that are thrown at you. And sometimes it's impossible to separate the good guys from the bad as the body count rises.Pawn is a fine film with a marvelous cast and some of the most suspenseful action I've seen in a while. Also, don't miss the Behind the Scenes special feature, where the actors talk about their roles.

I'm not sure why they show the shoot out with Forest Whitaker when he ends up dying in the bathroom without a shootout.  The movie is action packed and there is enough blood and guts for those who enjoy that type of thing.  The twists and turns of the movie kept me entertained.

1622540,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B6OEB18,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Pawn"" might be a straight-to-DVD thriller, but it boasts a surprisingly strong cast! Among a slew of recognizable faces, you've got Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, Common, Stephen Lang, Ray Liotta, Sean Faris, Nikki Reed, Max Beesley, Marton Csokas, and Jessica Szohr. But I was primarily intrigued by Michael Chiklis taking the film's most prominent role and serving as a producer. I'm a big fan of Chiklis, his Vic Mackey on ""The Shield"" will go down in my book as one of TV's greatest anti-heroes. And after viewing ""Pawn,"" a relatively low-budget affair, I could see what might have appealed to him. Setting up the classic heist-gone-wrong scenario, the film starts off as a stand-off between cops and robbers with a bounty of hostages caught in between. But director David A. Armstrong and screenwriter Jerome Anthony White clearly have other things on their mind. They want ""Pawn"" to be a twisty and clever enterprise that leaves the audience guessing about every character's real motivations. As the film progresses, flashbacks start to reveal that things might not be what they seem in this gritty, if flawed, movie.Chiklis plays a British thug (Why British? Who knows?) who leads a team on a late night heist on a popular midtown diner. Despite the lateness of the hour, the restaurant is packed with an assortment of innocent (and not-so-innocent) victims. When a local cop (Whitaker) enters the premises, the situation goes from bad to worse. But who, as they say, is zooming who? Who on the police force can be trusted? What was the goal of targeting the diner? And can anyone come out of this unscathed? I won't reveal anything relevant to the film's surprises other than to say that Faris quickly becomes the centerpiece of the hostage situation. As an ex-con caught up in the intrigue, is his presence at the diner merely a coincidence? That's a central question that haunts many of the principle characters as ""Pawn"" progresses.While ""Pawn"" positions itself as a twisty and clever thriller, it really isn't as smart as I would have liked. The metaphor of the chess piece is revealed late in the picture, but it's not particularly convincing. As major secrets are uncovered, the connections grew increasingly tenuous or unbelievable. Structured as a narrative puzzle, I felt that I had seen this device used to better effect in other films. The screenplay has a lot of great ideas, but many are left unexplored or go relatively nowhere. I especially liked how one character (Reed) was held and then inexplicably released. She had seen many of the major players involved in a grand conspiracy at that point, but they let her go like it was no big deal. This is also one of those movies that relies on the plot device that there is such organized corruption in the police force and this equates to having murder-for-hire thugs on the payroll.

1622542,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B00B6OEB18,Kyle Slayzar,"[0, 0]","I must admit, I had my doubts when I began watching Pawn.  Ever since Training Day with Denzel Washington, which was a great film, corrupt cop dramas have been a dime a dozen.  I examined the front cover of Pawn, read the back, checked out the cast, and shrugged thinking it was just another cop film squirming desperately to stand out from the rest in a good way.Having just watched the film from start to finish, I gotta admit, the film was actually pretty good albeit with a moderate degree of predictability.  It held my attention almost the entire time, sans one restroom break, and kept me interested in seeing how the somewhat intricate plot played out.  All the while the acting was well done, directing was solid, and the production value was not bad.  All in all, slightly above average film with a solid ""B"" rating.The premise is pretty basic; a seemingly... ""normal"" armed robbery of a local diner turns out to be more complicated than it seems, some characters are not what they claim to be, and people die while the plot thickens.  Nothing unusual, in fact, I've come to expect a body count of some kind in every film or, in the case of Call of Duty: Black Ops II (Or ""CODBLOPS II"" as I like to mockingly point out to Call of Duty fans), video games, Ray Liotta acts in.  Throw in that crazy guy from The Shield television show and you know the excrement is going to hit the rotor blades of some kind and people are going to die.At first, after watching the very nauseating opening credits jump literally all over the place, I thought Pawn would give homage to a style of storytelling similar to the film Vantage Point in that it would show the story from several different angles as it seemingly stated on the back of the box.  Then, Pawn shows an alternate way to open the film thus negating the opening sequence we just watched.  OK, so now the film wants to be Run Lola, Run.  Then, after blowing my original theory out of the water, it goes about the narrative normally with no real change in storytelling.  It's almost as if the editors couldn't agree on how to open the film, shouted out a loud, ""screw this,"" and decided to just tell the story normally but forgot to fix the opening.  It was... baffling to say the least.Once the storytelling began to be a little more consistent, I was able to enjoy watching the tale of intrigue unfold, although, I was able to predict several aspects and plot twists.  I won't say what they were, but when a guy dressed like an Italian mobster shows up in an unmarked SUV, escorted by a guy with a 90s ponytail and suppressed sidearm, neglects to identify himself or whoever he works for, it's generally a good idea NOT to get in the vehicle with him.  The only thing missing from the intentionally unnamed corrupt cop to complete the image is a black T-shirt saying, ""I went to Little Italy in New York, got bribed, sold out my buddies, got good people killed, and all I got was this lousy shirt... and a LOT of non-sequential $100 bills.""  No real spoilers in the film, but I enjoyed the story all the same... however, at the end it was unclear if a certain seemingly good cop was bad or not.  Maybe this is to make the viewer think, but unless you're putting out a sequel, very few of us will give it much thought.Back to the acting, it was pretty well done for a seemingly direct-to-DVD film.  Forrest Whitaker is always welcome in my theater room, Ray Liotta is his usual slimy self, there's that one Eastern European guy I saw on an episode of Star Trek: Voyager, and Michael Chiklis... well, never imagined him with a Cockney British accent.  It's quite entertaining as he sounds more like the British protagonist in the Saints Row video games than a genuine villain.  Chiklis still did a great job, but I had to laugh at his accent.Everything else about the film was OK but I felt as though the ending was rushed as the fallout could've been fleshed out a little more since it seemingly ended abruptly.  All in all, Pawn is worthy of a solid 85% rating in my book: not bad, not great, overall enjoyable but I probably won't watch it again.",4,Surprisingly Good If Not Somewhat Predictable,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,4105,"['must', 'admit', 'had', 'doubts', 'when', 'began', 'watching', 'Pawn', 'Ever', 'Training', 'Day', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'dramas', 'have', 'been', 'dime', 'dozen', 'examined', 'front', 'cover', 'Pawn', 'read', 'back', 'checked', 'out', 'cast', 'shrugged', 'thinking', 'was', 'just', 'cop', 'film', 'squirming', 'desperately', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'good', 'way.Having', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'albeit', 'moderate', 'degree', 'predictability', 'held', 'attention', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'one', 'restroom', 'break', 'kept', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'somewhat', 'intricate', 'plot', 'played', 'out', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'directing', 'was', 'solid', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'slightly', 'average', 'film', 'solid', 'B', 'rating.The', 'premise', 'pretty', 'basic', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'armed', 'robbery', 'local', 'diner', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'complicated', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'claim', 'be', 'people', 'die', 'plot', 'thickens', 'Nothing', 'unusual', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'body', 'count', 'kind', 'film', 'case', 'Call', 'Duty', 'Black', 'Ops', 'II', 'CODBLOPS', 'II', 'like', 'mockingly', 'point', 'out', 'Call', 'Duty', 'fans', 'video', 'games', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Throw', 'crazy', 'guy', 'Shield', 'television', 'show', 'know', 'excrement', 'going', 'hit', 'rotor', 'blades', 'kind', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'die.At', 'first', 'watching', 'very', 'nauseating', 'opening', 'credits', 'jump', 'literally', 'place', 'thought', 'Pawn', 'would', 'give', 'homage', 'style', 'storytelling', 'similar', 'film', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'would', 'show', 'story', 'several', 'different', 'angles', 'seemingly', 'stated', 'back', 'box', 'Then', 'Pawn', 'alternate', 'way', 'open', 'film', 'thus', 'negating', 'opening', 'sequence', 'just', 'watched', 'OK', 'so', 'now', 'film', 'be', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'Then', 'blowing', 'original', 'theory', 'water', 'narrative', 'normally', 'real', 'change', 'storytelling', 'almost', 'editors', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'how', 'open', 'film', 'shouted', 'out', 'loud', 'screw', 'decided', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'normally', 'forgot', 'fix', 'opening', 'was', 'baffling', 'say', 'least.Once', 'storytelling', 'began', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'consistent', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'tale', 'intrigue', 'unfold', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'several', 'aspects', 'plot', 'twists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'were', 'when', 'guy', 'dressed', 'Italian', 'mobster', 'up', 'unmarked', 'SUV', 'escorted', 'guy', '90s', 'ponytail', 'suppressed', 'sidearm', 'neglects', 'identify', 'whoever', 'generally', 'good', 'idea', 'NOT', 'get', 'vehicle', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'intentionally', 'unnamed', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'complete', 'image', 'black', 'T-shirt', 'saying', 'went', 'Little', 'Italy', 'New', 'York', 'got', 'bribed', 'sold', 'out', 'buddies', 'got', 'good', 'people', 'killed', 'got', 'was', 'lousy', 'shirt', 'LOT', 'non-sequential', '100', 'bills', 'real', 'spoilers', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'same', 'however', 'end', 'was', 'unclear', 'certain', 'seemingly', 'good', 'cop', 'was', 'bad', 'not', 'Maybe', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', ""'re"", 'putting', 'out', 'sequel', 'very', 'few', 'will', 'give', 'much', 'thought.Back', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'seemingly', 'direct-to-DVD', 'film', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'always', 'welcome', 'theater', 'room', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'usual', 'slimy', 'self', 'one', 'Eastern', 'European', 'guy', 'saw', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'well', 'never', 'imagined', 'Cockney', 'British', 'accent', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'more', 'British', 'protagonist', 'Saints', 'Row', 'video', 'games', 'genuine', 'villain', 'Chiklis', 'still', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'had', 'laugh', 'accent.Everything', 'else', 'film', 'was', 'OK', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'rushed', 'fallout', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'seemingly', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'Pawn', 'worthy', 'solid', '85', '%', 'rating', 'book', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again']",N/A

The apparent motive for the intrusion is robbery.  However, things are not as they seem.  We quickly learn that there are multiple subplots in this story, and many of the characters are not who they seem to be.About the only significant character in this film who is not currently a criminal is Nick, who is the ""Pawn"" in this movie.  Poor Nick is an ex-con who is trying to stay clean, but he somehow ended up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Nick is alternatively manipulated and accused of being part of the robbery, partially because of the manipulation.  Sadly, I can tell you little else about the plot without detracting from the fun.I can tell you that this film is heavily driven by characters and the plot.  The film has moments of action, but they are generally brief and are used as transition points in the film.  Indeed, this movie requires a significant amount of attention to follow because the movie is filled with details.  I consider this movie a ""thinking person's movie"" because it takes a bit of thought to keep track of the various plot threads.I wondered the other day why the film industry rarely seems to make movies like this one, which are character and plot driven rather than action driven.  After reading several of the negative reviews, I believe I understand why.  It appears that movie audiences generally fall into two groups.  One group has little interest in the plot and appears to desire satiation with constant action, violence, or both.  The other group appreciates a movie with an intelligent, complex, and interesting plot.  If you do not like the latter, then you will most likely not enjoy this movie.This movie seems like a rarity to me.  It has a complicated and intricate plot that requires a viewer to focus on the film from beginning to end.

Rashamon is the telling of a story from multiple view points to give the viewer a choice of what the truth is. Several films have used the concept of Rashamon to various degrees of success.  A pawn is the weakest piece on the chess board.  A pawn is usually sacrificed for the ""greater good.""Now the film Pawn use the rashamon concept and applies it to a simple armed robbery of an all night diner. Three robber enter the diner and...well things go to hell and believe me, you do NOT know who is the good guy and who is ""screwing"" who?The robbery is told in quick cut flashes that bounce from one character as the center to others.  In addition there are out side of the diner story lines mixed in.  The whole does keep one's attention and I found myself stopping and rewinding to check things.At the center is Michael Chiklis. The reason for this is Chiklis' opening scene.  He walks into the diner with a sawed off shotgun and a British accent.  As a matter of fact the henchmen too have British accents.  Why?  I don't know and while it bothered me, I found myself watching him all the more.  Ray Liotta once again does his usuall gangster character that we have seen many times before.The reason for the 4 stars is the ending.

The `70s weird insanity of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and grit of ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"". The `80s action of ""Die Hard"". Kubrick's ""The Killing"", Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", Ocean's ""Eleven"" and ""Thirteen"" (nuts to ""Twelve"" with the lame ""you look like Julia Roberts"" cop-out), ""Thief"", ""The Robber"", ""Point Break"", the list could go on and on.The plot ""Pawn"" is not too different than other heist movies (this doesn't really ""spoil"" anything):  There is a robbery going on.  Things go wrong.  Hostages are taken.  One of the hostages is an ex-con on his first day out of prison, and the police think he may be involve (the old ""mistaken identity"" subplot).  Or maybe he's being set up by crooked police.  Events unfold after that in a fairly unbelievable fashion.Where ""Pawn"" suffers is in execution of the plot.  Unfortunately it commits the worst ""movie offence"": it isn't great, and it isn't terrible.  It's just...there.  The problem with the film is that some of the weaker elements could have been pulled up by strong elements in other areas, but that does not happen.  Instead, the film is just mediocre all over.  There are some wonderful actors in minor roles (Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta), but they are pulled down by bad actors (Sean Faris) or good actors giving terrible performances (Michael Chiklis sounding like he is trying to do a terrible impression of Bob Hoskins from ""The Long Good Friday"").  The weak points in the story could have been glossed over had the direction or editing been interesting.  Instead, the pace of the film and cutting of the scenes play like someone who went to the Tony Scott school of editing, and the only thing they took away from it was ""fast & jerky=good"".  On the other hand, the bad direction and editing could have been ignored if the plot was solid.As I said, the movie is not the worst film that I have seen, but I would not recommend going out of your way to see it.

Indeed, just when you think that you've got everything figured out, the scene shifts backward or forward in time, and you are, once again, left wondering.  PAWN, directed by David A. Armstrong from Jay Anthony White's well-crafted screenplay, is one of those deliciously plotted movies, like THE USUAL SUSPECTS, that demands a second viewing.Chiklis, who co-produced the picture, is particularly powerful as the leader of the hold-up crew.  Also making a strong impression is Stephen Lang, playing the diner's manager and, in a relatively brief role, Liotta, who has a mesmerizing metaphoric moment.Suggestion: If you can avoid watching the trailer for PAWN before seeing the movie, do so.  Like so many trailers these days, this one reveals too much of the plot and, as previously suggested, that can spoil the enjoyment of the picture itself.The Blu-Ray/DVD contains a ""Making of"" featurette.

A cop walks in on a robbery in progress. But what happens next - and what happened just before - will change everything you think you know. Now the building is surrounded. There are fingers on every trigger. And one very intense hostage situation is about to take some extremely shocking twists.""And there are LOTS of twists.  Some predictable, some not.  Some credible, some not.  This is a film that bounces between extremes.  At times, it is gritty and gripping.  At other times, it has dialogue that's nearly laughable.  Frankly, I think if this exact same story had been told with better dialogue, it might actually have received wide release.  Better dialogue might also have drawn a better cast.  While the cast of PAWN is admirably eclectic, it is frustratingly uneven as well.We have the usually excellent Michael Chiklis in a COCKNEY gangster accent, for heaven's sake.  It's like he stepped out of a Guy Ritchie movie...but he's about as American as you can get.  And Marton Csokas, from New Zealand, is playing a New York/New Jersey cop with an accent that I'm not sure exists in real life.  The hard-as-nails Stephen Lange (AVATAR, GETTYSBURG) is a mild-mannered diner owner. Forest Whitaker is now apparently the Oscar-winner who is stuck making Direct-To-DVD films now (sharing that mantle with Cuba Gooding Jr., I guess).  At least Ray Liotta plays WITH type as a somewhat mysterious and dangerous bad guy.  And Common shows us as a hostage negotiator.  He looks and acts the part...but again, the dialogue undoes him.  But the worst of the script is reserved for Chiklis, whose cockney dialogue is so hackneyed, it's almost a parody.An actor named Sean Faris, whom I've never heard of and looks a lot like Jason Ritter, is the nominal hero of the movie.  He's too lightweight to be believable, although he seems like an amiable fellow.  Again, if the dialogue were better, it's likely the role might have attracted a more appropriate actor to anchor this film.But all that being said, I was never bored.  The story does take some good twists, and hostage situations (like courtroom dramas) always seem to lend themselves to film.  The film is well shot and competently edited.  It moves at a very brisk pace (it's only about 85 minutes), and the awkward moments are generally plowed right over...which is good.While I can't give it a glowing recommendation...I think someone looking for a slightly offbeat crime thriller could spend a pleasant enough evening with PAWN.  3 stars and a mild recommend.",3,VERY clunky dialogue diminishes the strengths of this twisty story.,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2715,"['never', 'do', 'let', 'quote', 'jacket', 'DVD', 'PAWN', 'give', 'set-up', 'simplicity', 'initial', 'minutes', 'correct', 'as', 'well', 'over-heated', 'tone', 'all-night', 'diner', 'cop', 'walks', 'robbery', 'progress', 'what', 'next', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'will', 'change', 'everything', 'think', 'know', 'Now', 'building', 'surrounded', 'are', 'fingers', 'trigger', 'one', 'very', 'intense', 'hostage', 'situation', 'take', 'extremely', 'shocking', 'twists', 'are', 'LOTS', 'twists', 'predictable', 'not', 'credible', 'not', 'film', 'extremes', 'times', 'gritty', 'gripping', 'other', 'times', 'dialogue', 'nearly', 'laughable', 'Frankly', 'think', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'better', 'dialogue', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'received', 'wide', 'release', 'Better', 'dialogue', 'might', 'also', 'have', 'drawn', 'better', 'cast', 'cast', 'PAWN', 'admirably', 'eclectic', 'frustratingly', 'uneven', 'well.We', 'have', 'usually', 'excellent', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'COCKNEY', 'gangster', 'accent', 'heaven', 'sake', 'stepped', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'movie', 'about', 'as', 'American', 'can', 'get', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'New', 'Zealand', 'playing', 'New', 'York/New', 'Jersey', 'cop', 'accent', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exists', 'real', 'life', 'hard-as-nails', 'Stephen', 'Lange', 'AVATAR', 'GETTYSBURG', 'mild-mannered', 'diner', 'owner', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'now', 'apparently', 'Oscar-winner', 'who', 'stuck', 'making', 'Direct-To-DVD', 'films', 'now', 'sharing', 'mantle', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'guess', 'least', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'WITH', 'type', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'guy', 'Common', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'part', 'again', 'dialogue', 'worst', 'script', 'reserved', 'Chiklis', 'cockney', 'dialogue', 'so', 'hackneyed', 'almost', 'parody.An', 'actor', 'named', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'lot', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'nominal', 'hero', 'movie', 'too', 'lightweight', 'be', 'believable', 'amiable', 'fellow', 'Again', 'dialogue', 'were', 'better', 'likely', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'attracted', 'more', 'appropriate', 'actor', 'anchor', 'film.But', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'story', 'take', 'good', 'twists', 'hostage', 'situations', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'always', 'seem', 'lend', 'film', 'film', 'well', 'shot', 'competently', 'edited', 'very', 'brisk', 'pace', 'only', 'about', '85', 'minutes', 'awkward', 'moments', 'are', 'generally', 'plowed', 'right', 'good.While', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'glowing', 'recommendation', 'think', 'someone', 'looking', 'slightly', 'offbeat', 'crime', 'thriller', 'could', 'spend', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'evening', 'PAWN', '3', 'stars', 'mild', 'recommend']",N/A

It reveals way, way too much of the plot twists.THE PLAYERS:There's a wide range of talent attached to this movie...Michael Chiklis (who also serves as a producer of this film), Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Nikki Reed from the ""Twilight"" films, Stephen Lang from ""Avatar"", Sean Faris, and many more.THE PLOT:The best way to describe this film is that it's a 3-man-heist-gone-wrong at a small diner, but with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at. In all honesty, offering any more information threatens to reveal too much, so I'll move on.DVD FEATURES:English or Spanish subtitles, no other options.EXTRAS:This is one bare-bones DVD. There's no trailers, no commentary tracks, just a 23 minute ""Behind the Scenes"" feature from most of the players, but it's missing input from Ray Liotta and Michael Chiklis.WHAT DID I LIKE?I loved the non-linear style of telling the story. This movie had several flashbacks, and sometimes the same scenes were shown but from different character points of view, which offered more information than in the first viewing. Anyone who's seen a Quentin Tarantino film knows his movies should be watched more than once, and Pawn invites you to do the same.I liked seeing Michael Chiklis and Forest Whitaker on screen, which brought back memories of their days together on ""The Shield"". Ray Liotta was quite a pleasant surprise, delivering one of the most chilling monologues I've ever heard in his career to date. I had to do a complete double-take when I saw Stephen Lang, who played a frail older man with a bad hip...a stark contrast to his role as Colonel Miles Quaritch in ""Avatar"". Sean Faris did extremely well with these veteran actors - he was able to play a roller coaster of emotions without hamming up his role.Most of all, I liked finding out that the director, David A. Armstrong, was the cinematographer of the ""SAW"" franchise. Just like the first ""SAW"" movie, Pawn was shot in one main location and very few other locations, and the director was able to hold my interest all the way through to the end.WHAT DID I NOT LIKE?Common's depiction of Jeff Porter, the hostage negotiator. Out of all the characters in this film, I felt this one was portrayed the weakest with his soft voice and flat affect. I wish he had studied Kevin Spacey's character from ""The Negotiator"". Thankfully, his weak characterization didn't ruin the rest of the film for me.I also didn't like the lack of features on this disc. I would have loved to hear the director's thoughts on an audio track.FINAL VERDICT?All in all, I liked Pawn. I was pleased to discover a film shot over the course of 15 days on a low budget which was able to entertain me and keep me guessing about different plot points. Some were obvious, while others were not.If you like crime dramas, I would definitely recommend seeing this at least twice to catch all the little subtleties.",4,It's your move...,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3352,"['one', 'harder', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'review', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'opposite', 'liked', '_so_', 'much', 'hope', 'would', 'choose', 'watch', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'prior', 'information.However', ""'re"", 'already', 'reading', 'review', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'tell', 'why', 'liked', 'try', 'keep', 'spoiler', 'material', 'bare', 'minimum', 'best', 'advice', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WATCH', 'THE', 'TRAILER', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'twists.THE', 'PLAYERS', 'wide', 'range', 'talent', 'attached', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'who', 'also', 'producer', 'film', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Twilight', 'films', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Avatar', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'many', 'more.THE', 'PLOT', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'film', '3-man-heist-gone-wrong', 'small', 'diner', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'honesty', 'offering', 'more', 'information', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'so', ""'ll"", 'move', 'on.DVD', 'FEATURES', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'other', 'options.EXTRAS', 'one', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'just', '23', 'minute', 'Scenes', 'feature', 'most', 'players', 'missing', 'input', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Michael', 'Chiklis.WHAT', 'DID', 'LIKE', 'loved', 'non-linear', 'style', 'telling', 'story', 'movie', 'had', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'sometimes', 'same', 'scenes', 'were', 'shown', 'different', 'character', 'points', 'view', 'offered', 'more', 'information', 'first', 'viewing', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'Pawn', 'do', 'same.I', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'screen', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'days', 'together', 'Shield', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'monologues', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'career', 'date', 'had', 'do', 'complete', 'double-take', 'when', 'saw', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'who', 'played', 'frail', 'older', 'man', 'bad', 'hip', 'stark', 'contrast', 'role', 'Colonel', 'Miles', 'Quaritch', 'Avatar', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'veteran', 'actors', 'was', 'able', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'hamming', 'up', 'role.Most', 'liked', 'finding', 'out', 'director', 'David', 'A.', 'Armstrong', 'was', 'cinematographer', 'SAW', 'franchise', 'Just', 'first', 'SAW', 'movie', 'Pawn', 'was', 'shot', 'one', 'main', 'location', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'locations', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'hold', 'interest', 'way', 'end.WHAT', 'DID', 'NOT', 'LIKE', 'Common', 'depiction', 'Jeff', 'Porter', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'characters', 'film', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'portrayed', 'weakest', 'soft', 'voice', 'flat', 'affect', 'wish', 'had', 'studied', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'Negotiator', 'Thankfully', 'weak', 'characterization', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'rest', 'film', 'me.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'lack', 'features', 'disc', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'director', 'thoughts', 'audio', 'track.FINAL', 'VERDICT', 'liked', 'Pawn', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'film', 'shot', 'course', '15', 'days', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'able', 'entertain', 'keep', 'guessing', 'different', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'obvious', 'others', 'were', 'not.If', 'crime', 'dramas', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'least', 'twice', 'catch', 'little', 'subtleties']",N/A

Why might one ask? Basically I feel the less said about it would be better. This is not to proclaim that this film is poor, quite the opposite actually.  I think that if I were to reveal too much of this film it would ruin its charm. Nevertheless I will do my best to shed a little light on this movie.The film is centered on three men who are in the process of robbing a diner.  There are many key players in this film; such as the police, the police negotiator, the owner of the diner, the FBI, the mob, the robbers themselves and the ex-con and this is only the beginning of the list.  It is difficult to determine who is good and who is bad.  This was the part of the film I found appealing, because I really had no clue what was going to happen next. The story is presented in a bit of a non-linear fashion.  In other words, the scenes are shown out of order to enhance the narration of the plot.  For example, the opening scene is the middle of the robbery in the diner.  As the film continues, the viewer will see what happens before and after this scene.As for the acting, I found it really good and believable.  The performers are people one might has seen before, such as Michael Chiklis, Stephen Lang, Forest Whitaker, Nikki Reed, Ray Liotta and Sean Faris (to list a few).  These performers aren't necessarily top marquee actors and actresses but they really deliver very good performances in this movie.  I was impressed with Common in this film as the police negotiator.  I am not familiar with him, but he was pretty good.  I am sometimes dubious of hip-hop artists turned actors, but he did a good job.  As for Sean Faris, I still see a young Tom Cruise when I watch him.  The prior statement is a compliment since I like Tom Cruise as an actor.I did find that the movie lagged a bit towards the last fifteen minutes or so.  Notwithstanding, this was a good crime/psychological thriller.  A word to the wise, this film is gritty, brutal and doesn't pull any punches.  I felt it was a refreshing piece of cinema that very much relied on the story and characters to carry it.  When I watched this movie I knew nothing about it and really liked it.

A group of thugs take over the diner in what seems to be a simple ""bag it and run"" operation. It soon becomes apparent that the leader of the group has an agenda different from the men working under him. In the midst of it all is a man named Nick (Sean Faris), a recently released convict seeking to keep his life in order. Nick wants nothing more than to return home to his wife and get on living with his life. However, he soon becomes a pawn involved in a game much larger than any he has ever played.PAWN features a stellar cast that includes such heavyweights as Nikki Reed, Ray Liotta, Forest Whitaker, Michael Chiklis, and Stephen Lang. Considering this is an extremely low budget movie filmed in just fifteen days, the cast list is rather impressive.Part of the plot of the movie is revealed through a series of flashbacks that reveal a different part of the story told from the perspective of a different character (think RASHOMON or VANTAGE POINT). I occasionally enjoy this style of storytelling in movies and I liked how it was used in PAWN. Unfortunately, the device is thrown away about halfway through the movie and the last part of the movie is told in a more linear fashion.Upon initially watching PAWN, I didn't think I was going to like it. The first few scenes left me disoriented and I wasn't sure what type of movie I was watching; I thought it was going to be a kind of heist movie, but after the first couple of scenes I thought I was watching some trippy time travel flick like DONNIE DARKO. However, once I got further along, I really started to enjoy the movie and began trying to unravel the tangled threads of the story myself.

The film was obviously low-budget - almost all of the action takes place in a diner and because of this, feels like a stage play. The opening credits ape David Fischer, moves on to kill off a character (spoiler here) unexpectedly early, like ""Psycho"" and the British thug who heads the gang acts a little like Hannibal Lector. In fact, the gang of criminals, with their English accents, seem like refugees straight out of a Guy Ritchie film. On top of that, the proceedings are reminiscent of hostage dramas like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""The Desperate Hours."" The out of sequence storytelling, with flashbacks galore, reminds me of ""Momento.""Despite all these ""homages"" to various films, I found myself enjoying it. There are some unexplained parts (why are a bunch of English thugs holding up an American diner, of all places?) and the convoluted twists and turns aren't terribly original (the ex-con is/isn't as guilty as he looks, the diners aren't all innocent, random strangers who just happen to get trapped) and the ending is too neat and pat. When Ray Liotta holds the ex-con's girlfriend hostage, he uses a chilling metaphor to describe what might happen to her boyfriend (how ancient clock makers accidentally harmed themselves by inhaling mercury used to bond gold to brass) and it's a great scene, but ultimately to no purpose, as the girlfriend is simply released after this, and all this tension leads to nothing.However, the acting by veterans Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, etc, are uniformly excellent, and ""Pawn"" is highly watchable and entertaining, if a little absurd at times.",4,"Enjoyable, Fast-Paced Thriller If Derivative of Other Movies",1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1730,"['Pawn', 'one', 'straight-to-video', 'releases', 'actually', 'better', 'films', 'actually', 'made', 'theaters', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'low-budget', 'almost', 'action', 'place', 'diner', 'feels', 'stage', 'play', 'opening', 'credits', 'ape', 'David', 'Fischer', 'moves', 'kill', 'off', 'character', 'spoiler', 'here', 'unexpectedly', 'early', 'Psycho', 'British', 'thug', 'who', 'gang', 'little', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'fact', 'gang', 'criminals', 'English', 'accents', 'seem', 'refugees', 'straight', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'film', 'top', 'proceedings', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'hostage', 'dramas', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'out', 'sequence', 'storytelling', 'flashbacks', 'galore', 'Momento', 'homages', 'various', 'films', 'found', 'enjoying', 'are', 'unexplained', 'parts', 'why', 'are', 'bunch', 'English', 'thugs', 'holding', 'up', 'American', 'diner', 'places', 'convoluted', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'ex-con', 'is/is', ""n't"", 'as', 'guilty', 'diners', 'are', ""n't"", 'innocent', 'random', 'strangers', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'get', 'trapped', 'ending', 'too', 'neat', 'pat', 'When', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'ex-con', 'girlfriend', 'hostage', 'chilling', 'metaphor', 'describe', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'boyfriend', 'how', 'ancient', 'clock', 'makers', 'accidentally', 'harmed', 'inhaling', 'mercury', 'used', 'bond', 'gold', 'brass', 'great', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'purpose', 'girlfriend', 'simply', 'released', 'tension', 'nothing.However', 'acting', 'veterans', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'etc', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Pawn', 'highly', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'little', 'absurd', 'times']",N/A

The place is strewn with secrets and betrayals waiting to bloom. People show up at the wrong time and an easy stickup devolves into a tense hostage situation. Guns are waved around, and there's plenty of macho bluster to vicariously enjoy. Though it loses some momentum towards the end when the plot obliges it to move out of its initial claustrophobic stage set, Pawn is still the dictionary definition of a solid crime thriller, with a cast a notch better than you expect. Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Michael Chiklis are on hand to bring a level of hey-there's-that-guy-ness and remind you that you're not watching TV.Now it is always a joy to see Michael Chiklis' big bald head hove into view. The blend of menace and likability he cultivated so well in The Shield carries over here except...he's doing an English accent. The guys knocking over the diner are three Cockneys named Derrick, Nigel, and Billy. (The movie misses an opportunity by not calling the Billy character David, thereby naming all its central villains after the members of Spinal Tap.) To my North American ears Chiklis' accent isn't incompetently done, but it's still distracting. The movie takes place in a nondescript American city. It doesn't make sense that these guys are English, is never remarked upon, and plays no role in the plot. You're supposed to be wrapped up in this tense standoff between robbers, hostages, and mobsters, and instead you're thinking, ""Was Chiklis unhappy about the accent, or was it his idea? Did he put his foot down and say, 'Robber #1 is English or I walk!'"" Though a hostage thriller, this is tense negotiation that Pawn leaves in your mind.",3,"Vic Mackey, Innit?",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1739,"['trio', 'thugs', 'hold', 'up', 'late', 'night', 'diner', 'not', 'everyone', 'inside', 'who', 'seem', 'place', 'strewn', 'secrets', 'betrayals', 'waiting', 'bloom', 'People', 'show', 'up', 'wrong', 'time', 'easy', 'stickup', 'tense', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Guns', 'are', 'waved', 'plenty', 'macho', 'bluster', 'vicariously', 'enjoy', 'momentum', 'end', 'when', 'plot', 'move', 'out', 'initial', 'claustrophobic', 'stage', 'set', 'Pawn', 'still', 'dictionary', 'definition', 'solid', 'crime', 'thriller', 'cast', 'notch', 'better', 'expect', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'are', 'hand', 'bring', 'level', ""hey-there's-that-guy-ness"", 'remind', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'TV.Now', 'always', 'joy', 'see', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'big', 'bald', 'head', 'hove', 'view', 'blend', 'menace', 'likability', 'cultivated', 'so', 'well', 'Shield', 'here', 'doing', 'English', 'accent', 'guys', 'knocking', 'diner', 'are', 'three', 'Cockneys', 'named', 'Derrick', 'Nigel', 'Billy', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'not', 'calling', 'Billy', 'character', 'David', 'thereby', 'naming', 'central', 'villains', 'members', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'North', 'American', 'ears', 'Chiklis', 'accent', ""n't"", 'incompetently', 'done', 'still', 'distracting', 'movie', 'place', 'nondescript', 'American', 'city', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'guys', 'are', 'English', 'never', 'remarked', 'role', 'plot', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tense', 'standoff', 'robbers', 'hostages', 'mobsters', 'instead', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Was', 'Chiklis', 'unhappy', 'accent', 'was', 'idea', 'Did', 'put', 'foot', 'down', 'say', ""'Robber"", '1', 'English', 'walk', 'hostage', 'thriller', 'tense', 'negotiation', 'Pawn', 'mind']",N/A
1622569,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00B6OEB18,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 5]","Cops and robbers is a genre that almost goes into very familiar territory whenever a film gets released. Director David Armstrong's ""Pawn"" is really no different, and yet it tries something new with some very familiar twists and turns. It's screenplay starts off very simple as a cop (Forest Whitaker) walks into a 24-hour diner to have his usual cup of joe. What happens is totally unexpected when a gang of thugs led by a ""Brit"" (Michael Chiklis) have taken over the diner to get the contents of the place's safe. Of course, we all can tell where the plot is about to go, as a stand off between the police and the hostage-takers ensue. But this is not a simple robbery as things are about to get much more complicated for the diner's patrons, this includes an ex-con (Sean Faris) as they are about to discover that there is more at stake here.First off, ""Pawn"" is an effective low-budget film. It has its own share of issues, but it manages to keep things together and focused. The twists and turns it presents are enough to engage the viewer as the main characters are developed through the use of occasional flashbacks, revelations were carefully placed within its screenplay, and it does serve up some genuine tension. Cops and robbers almost have a common staple around them; crooked cops, a cover-up, a few wannabe masterminds and a `pawn', and they all serve up to build on suspense and tension. It is a familiar deal, but the direction was wise enough to structure the story with a careful hand in execution.Low budget films often have several obstacles with the rendition of its production values, and this is an area where I think that the film would've benefited if it had a larger budget. I felt that the production designs felt a little too bland, limited and a even a little shaky at times. There weren't that many elements to really enthrall its viewer, it feels a little too plain. Sure, there were several scenes that stood out, and I liked the way that its premise did not require any use of CGI special effects and for awhile, it managed to generate a feeling of claustrophobia. The effects were done simply with the minimal use of practical effects and one would do well to remember that this is a low-budget flick.Michael Chiklis (who also co-produces) stood out as the ""Brit"". His performance was quite good as the main antagonist. Fans of ""The Shield"" would recognize his familiar swagger and flair, and the man certainly does a great British accent (or is he British?). Sean Faris' performance sadly is a little lukewarm as he severely demonstrates his limited acting skills. Not sure, his `ex-con with a new heart' bit felt a little too easy and I am afraid that he did not sell his role. Common plays Jeff Porter the negotiator and his role felt like a mild convenience to the plot; he lacked the necessary presence to really give his character the weight to drive its emotions. Marton Csokas played a convincing crooked cop but unfortunately, his was a very limited screen time. I also have an issue that Ray Liotta, Forest Whitaker, Stephen Lang and Ronald Guttman weren't well-used into the plot. I mean, these are actors with high caliber and they had such small roles? I think that may have been a bad move.The film is kind of brisk up to a point, suspenseful at times and the plot had enough strong points that I think fans of the crime genre would find it enjoyable. I think this is a worthy watch even if it really isn't anything special. Chiklis did a fine job as the ""Brit"", and he is supported with some quality performances from the actors that had limited roles. The script was strong enough to sell its twists and surprises, though admittedly I wished it had a stronger ending. I know it was a story about `changing for the better' but it felt somehow anti-climactic. Still, this would be a good Rental on a lazy evening. It is good as far as low-budget thrillers go.[3  Out of 5 Stars]",3,Good Enough as Far as Low-Budget Crime Thrillers Go,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3927,"['Cops', 'robbers', 'genre', 'almost', 'very', 'familiar', 'territory', 'whenever', 'film', 'released', 'Director', 'David', 'Armstrong', 'Pawn', 'really', 'different', 'yet', 'something', 'new', 'very', 'familiar', 'twists', 'turns', 'screenplay', 'off', 'very', 'simple', 'cop', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', '24-hour', 'diner', 'have', 'usual', 'cup', 'joe', 'What', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'when', 'gang', 'thugs', 'led', 'Brit', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'diner', 'get', 'contents', 'place', 'safe', 'course', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'plot', 'go', 'stand', 'off', 'police', 'hostage-takers', 'ensue', 'not', 'simple', 'robbery', 'things', 'are', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'diner', 'patrons', 'ex-con', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'are', 'discover', 'more', 'stake', 'here.First', 'Pawn', 'effective', 'low-budget', 'film', 'own', 'share', 'issues', 'keep', 'things', 'together', 'focused', 'twists', 'presents', 'are', 'enough', 'engage', 'viewer', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'use', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'revelations', 'were', 'carefully', 'placed', 'screenplay', 'serve', 'up', 'genuine', 'tension', 'Cops', 'robbers', 'almost', 'have', 'common', 'staple', 'crooked', 'cops', 'cover-up', 'few', 'wannabe', 'masterminds', 'pawn', 'serve', 'up', 'build', 'suspense', 'tension', 'familiar', 'deal', 'direction', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'structure', 'story', 'careful', 'hand', 'execution.Low', 'budget', 'films', 'often', 'have', 'several', 'obstacles', 'rendition', 'production', 'values', 'area', 'where', 'think', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'had', 'larger', 'budget', 'felt', 'production', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'bland', 'limited', 'even', 'little', 'shaky', 'times', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'elements', 'really', 'enthrall', 'viewer', 'little', 'too', 'plain', 'Sure', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'stood', 'out', 'liked', 'way', 'premise', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'use', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'awhile', 'managed', 'generate', 'feeling', 'claustrophobia', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'simply', 'minimal', 'use', 'practical', 'effects', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'remember', 'low-budget', 'flick.Michael', 'Chiklis', 'who', 'also', 'co-produces', 'stood', 'out', 'Brit', 'performance', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Fans', 'Shield', 'would', 'recognize', 'familiar', 'swagger', 'flair', 'man', 'certainly', 'great', 'British', 'accent', 'British', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'performance', 'sadly', 'little', 'lukewarm', 'severely', 'limited', 'acting', 'skills', 'Not', 'sure', 'ex-con', 'new', 'heart', 'bit', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'am', 'afraid', 'did', 'not', 'sell', 'role', 'Common', 'Jeff', 'Porter', 'negotiator', 'role', 'felt', 'mild', 'convenience', 'plot', 'lacked', 'necessary', 'presence', 'really', 'give', 'character', 'weight', 'drive', 'emotions', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'played', 'convincing', 'crooked', 'cop', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'have', 'issue', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Ronald', 'Guttman', 'were', ""n't"", 'well-used', 'plot', 'mean', 'are', 'actors', 'high', 'caliber', 'had', 'such', 'small', 'roles', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'move.The', 'film', 'kind', 'brisk', 'up', 'point', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'plot', 'had', 'enough', 'strong', 'points', 'think', 'fans', 'crime', 'genre', 'would', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'worthy', 'watch', 'even', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'Chiklis', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Brit', 'supported', 'quality', 'performances', 'actors', 'had', 'limited', 'roles', 'script', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'sell', 'twists', 'surprises', 'admittedly', 'wished', 'had', 'stronger', 'ending', 'know', 'was', 'story', 'changing', 'better', 'felt', 'somehow', 'anti-climactic', 'Still', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Rental', 'lazy', 'evening', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'low-budget', 'thrillers', 'go', '[', '3', 'Out', '5', 'Stars', ']']",N/A

Each time I thought I had it figured out, it pulled a switch, and then another.Michael Chiklis was fully convincing as an English gangster--as were his cronies. (Chiklis is not English--and New England doesn't count.) He was a wholly rational thug. He wanted the money, and he did not come across as a psycho. Mean and rational. However, Ray Liotta was chilling as a calm psychopath tasked with possibly killing the pregnant wife of a crime victim. His demeanor was cold to the core, but he wasn't a thrill killer--it was part of his job. Liotta does creepy quite well. Great performance.The style of the film was Pulp Fiction without the humor or music. The timeline and point of view changes, and what you think you're seeing and hearing really isn't. This film could have been a play performed using a changing diner  set  to give the audience a different angle on the unfolding events. Forrest Whitaker and the rest of the cast were all parts of a puzzle that was more a kaleidoscope where the puzzle pieces changed and changed again.
