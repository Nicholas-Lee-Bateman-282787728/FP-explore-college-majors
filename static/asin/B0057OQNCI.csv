I found Season 1 vol. 1 at the local disc replay store,  I was disappointed it wasn't the whole season.  And had some trouble finding it~ until I got on Amazon.

1445007,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0057OQNCI,Kasey G,"[3, 10]","What happened to ""Glee""? The first DVD ""The Road to Sectionals"" was fresh, fun, addictive television that possessed a well-written, naturally-paced, brilliantly executed story arc topped off with Lea Michele's sizzling rendition of ""Don't Rain On My Parade"". The second DVD release containing the last-half of Season One paled a little in comparison but was still great TV.Only into its sophomore season and it appears ""Glee"" is already falling apart and here's why:- It seems the writers are trying to keep the episodes more self-contained (to play better in future syndication) and there aren't many good story arcs.- Good characters/actors like Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Burt Hummell (Mike O'Malley) are wasted or don't get enough screen time.- Kurt's ladyvoice performing those over-the-top numbers is beyond annoying.- The Warblers are a terrible addition and their ""leader"" Blaine (Darren Criss) is the worst case of a dork being promoted as a heartthrob since Henry Winkler was playing Fonzie on ""Happy Days"". I keep hoping they'll get their own spin-off just to get them off the show.- Characters like April (Kristen Chenowith) and Holly (Gwyneth Paltrow) keep making returning engagements when they weren't that great to begin with.By the time we get to the episode ""Born This Way"", things start to improve but it's a case of too-little-too-late. The Prom show is definitely the high point of this set (it made Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" actually tolerable) but you have to wade through a lot to get there.I loved ""Glee"" in the beginning but the producers and writers have ruined it with too many unlikeable characters, and if they don't do some damage control and rebound in Season Three, it will become almost unwatchable.Three Stars.",3,Crash and Burn in Season Two,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1752,"['What', 'happened', 'Glee', 'first', 'DVD', 'Road', 'Sectionals', 'was', 'fresh', 'fun', 'addictive', 'television', 'possessed', 'well-written', 'naturally-paced', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'story', 'arc', 'topped', 'off', 'Lea', 'Michele', 'sizzling', 'rendition', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Rain', 'My', 'Parade', 'second', 'DVD', 'release', 'containing', 'last-half', 'Season', 'One', 'paled', 'little', 'comparison', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'TV.Only', 'sophomore', 'season', 'Glee', 'already', 'falling', 'apart', 'here', 'why', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'keep', 'episodes', 'more', 'self-contained', 'play', 'better', 'future', 'syndication', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'good', 'story', 'arcs.-', 'Good', 'characters/actors', 'Coach', 'Beiste', 'Dot-Marie', 'Jones', 'Burt', 'Hummell', 'Mike', ""O'Malley"", 'are', 'wasted', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time.-', 'Kurt', 'ladyvoice', 'performing', 'over-the-top', 'numbers', 'annoying.-', 'Warblers', 'are', 'terrible', 'addition', 'leader', 'Blaine', 'Darren', 'Criss', 'worst', 'case', 'dork', 'being', 'promoted', 'heartthrob', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'was', 'playing', 'Fonzie', 'Happy', 'Days', 'keep', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'get', 'own', 'spin-off', 'just', 'get', 'off', 'show.-', 'Characters', 'April', 'Kristen', 'Chenowith', 'Holly', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'keep', 'making', 'returning', 'engagements', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'begin', 'with.By', 'time', 'get', 'episode', 'Born', 'Way', 'things', 'start', 'improve', 'case', 'too-little-too-late', 'Prom', 'show', 'definitely', 'high', 'point', 'set', 'made', 'Rebecca', 'Black', 'Friday', 'actually', 'tolerable', 'have', 'wade', 'lot', 'get', 'there.I', 'loved', 'Glee', 'beginning', 'producers', 'writers', 'have', 'ruined', 'too', 'many', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'damage', 'control', 'rebound', 'Season', 'Three', 'will', 'become', 'almost', 'unwatchable.Three', 'Stars']","Glee: Season 2, Vol. 2"
