In spite of not being married herself, she is an excellent marriage and family therapist. While attending a charity event with a friend she catches the attention of a philanthropist who is used to having things his way. He decides she would be a good radio host for one of his programs. He notices a photographer at the event taking a photo of her with ""her husband and two kids."" Actually he is mistaken. The ""family"" is an old college acquaintance who has been a widower for three years, along with his two teenage kids. She just happens to be talking with them when a roving photographer stops to take their photo. She receives an invitation from ""Bish,"" the philanthropist to come to his ranch in New Mexico with her family to discuss the future. At the risk of losing this opportunity, Annie convinces Mark, the friend from her college days that she hasn't seen since her freshman year, to bring his kids and come with her, posing as her family. Mark is trying to raise money to keep his after school program going for local kids, so he recognizes the chance to pitch his program to ""Bish"" for funding. They all end up at the ranch--thousands of acres of New Mexico land with horses, ATVs, swimming pool, and its own Old West main street. The kids are having a great time while Annie and Mark are haunted by the lie they are living.  They just can't seem to find the opportunity to tell the truth, and they keep getting deeper into the lie.There is not a single inappropriate moment between Annie and Mark. There is no offensive language or suggestive dialogue. You truly can sit and watch with your whole family. The only negative I see about this ""family film"" is that the storyline comes across more as a chick flick to me, and I enjoyed it because I am a chick. I'm just not so sure that the men in my family would be as interested, though there are some scenes of manly things like riding horses and mending fences. There is also a fun little scene with two songs by former American Idol finalist Danny Gokey, who plays Bish's ""neighbor"".The movie stresses the value of honesty and does it without seeming ""preachy"". It was enjoyable, though predictable, with some reasonably good acting. It is only $13 at Wal-Mart, but if there isn't one nearby, you must live on the moon and you can order it here, though shipping may be astronomical!",4,"Good effort at family fun, but comes off more as a chick flick.",1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,2485,"['Having', 'witnessed', 'parents', 'go', 'messy', 'divorce', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'Annie', 'passionate', 'saving', 'marriages', 'families', 'spite', 'not', 'being', 'married', 'excellent', 'marriage', 'family', 'therapist', 'attending', 'charity', 'event', 'friend', 'attention', 'philanthropist', 'who', 'used', 'having', 'things', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'radio', 'host', 'one', 'programs', 'photographer', 'event', 'taking', 'photo', 'husband', 'two', 'kids', 'Actually', 'mistaken', 'family', 'old', 'college', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'been', 'widower', 'three', 'years', 'two', 'teenage', 'kids', 'just', 'be', 'talking', 'when', 'roving', 'photographer', 'take', 'photo', 'invitation', 'Bish', 'philanthropist', 'come', 'ranch', 'New', 'Mexico', 'family', 'discuss', 'future', 'risk', 'losing', 'opportunity', 'Annie', 'Mark', 'friend', 'college', 'days', ""n't"", 'seen', 'freshman', 'year', 'bring', 'kids', 'come', 'posing', 'family', 'Mark', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'keep', 'school', 'program', 'going', 'local', 'kids', 'chance', 'pitch', 'program', 'Bish', 'funding', 'end', 'up', 'ranch', 'thousands', 'acres', 'New', 'Mexico', 'land', 'horses', 'ATVs', 'swimming', 'pool', 'own', 'Old', 'West', 'main', 'street', 'kids', 'are', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Annie', 'Mark', 'are', 'haunted', 'lie', 'are', 'living', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'truth', 'keep', 'getting', 'deeper', 'lie.There', 'not', 'single', 'inappropriate', 'moment', 'Annie', 'Mark', 'offensive', 'language', 'suggestive', 'dialogue', 'truly', 'can', 'sit', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'only', 'negative', 'see', 'family', 'film', 'storyline', 'across', 'more', 'chick', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'chick', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'men', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'are', 'scenes', 'manly', 'things', 'riding', 'horses', 'mending', 'fences', 'also', 'fun', 'little', 'scene', 'two', 'songs', 'former', 'American', 'Idol', 'finalist', 'Danny', 'Gokey', 'who', 'Bish', 'neighbor', '.The', 'movie', 'value', 'honesty', 'seeming', 'preachy', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'predictable', 'reasonably', 'good', 'acting', 'only', '13', 'Wal-Mart', ""n't"", 'one', 'nearby', 'must', 'live', 'moon', 'can', 'order', 'here', 'shipping', 'may', 'be', 'astronomical']",Truth Be Told (Family Movie Night)

Besides the annoying premise, the story is predictable, mushy, and sugar sweet around the edges.  But it's clean: no language, violence, sex.  There's mild drama, a touch of romance, and lots of silliness.
