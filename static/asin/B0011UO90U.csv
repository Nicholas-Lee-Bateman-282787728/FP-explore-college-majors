1132843,A12KBUJ812LHZS,B0011UO90U,Dave's Film Review,"[0, 0]",This was one of the most well-written shows on TV in 2004. Brilliant direction and acting only added to its greatness. Too bad it was canceled way too soon. Would love to have this in my DVD collection with lots of extra features -- are there any unaired episodes?Would love to hear the cast and crew talk about this now as a look back and really get the inside scoop on the cancellation.,5,Best TV show...too bad it was cancelled...,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,388,"['was', 'one', 'most', 'well-written', 'shows', 'TV', '2004', 'Brilliant', 'direction', 'acting', 'only', 'added', 'greatness', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'canceled', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'Would', 'love', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'lots', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'there', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'Would', 'love', 'hear', 'cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'now', 'look', 'back', 'really', 'get', 'inside', 'scoop', 'cancellation']",Jack & Bobby - The Complete Series

1132846,A1XAWBA11WMFAP,B0011UO90U,S. Wilson,"[6, 6]","I watched Jack and Bobby when it first aired and instantly fell in love with the whole concept of the show and was so heart broken when it was cancelled. This was by far one of the best shows out there and as usual anything intellectual, non-reality based or soaked in sex dosen't last.  I was so ecstatic when recently the WB started putting their shows on demand and online to view.  I started watching the episodes and fell in love with the story all over again.  The cast was superb and the storylines were so relatable that it really captured me.  If you have never seen it google or you tube it...simply the best.  I hope this comes out on DVD so I can own this wonderful show.",5,Love this show...please put it on DVD,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,683,"['watched', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'whole', 'concept', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'heart', 'broken', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'there', 'usual', 'anything', 'intellectual', 'non-reality', 'based', 'soaked', 'sex', 'dose', ""n't"", 'last', 'was', 'so', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'recently', 'WB', 'started', 'putting', 'shows', 'demand', 'online', 'view', 'started', 'watching', 'episodes', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'storylines', 'were', 'so', 'relatable', 'really', 'captured', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'google', 'tube', 'simply', 'best', 'hope', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'own', 'wonderful', 'show']",Jack & Bobby - The Complete Series
