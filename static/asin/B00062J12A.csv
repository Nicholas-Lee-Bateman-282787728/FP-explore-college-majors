857579,A354H94JN81SHW,B00062J12A,"Gruntled ""Gruntled""","[0, 0]","I've been a long-time Gilmore Girls fan, but never thought to buy the show, until I discovered my girlfriend had never seen, or heard of, the show.  This collection is an excellent intro to the Gilmore Girls, and I recommend it highly.Here's the set-up:  Lorelai Gilmore had her daughter Rory at the age of sixteen, out of wedlock, embarrassing her wealthy and status-conscious parents.  It's now sixteen years later, and she runs the Independence Inn, while Rory (short for Lorelai, BTW), has qualified to go to Chilton, a ritzy college preparatory private school.  Desperate to pay the tuition, Lorelai grudgingly asks her parents for the money so Rory can attend and eventually go to Harvard.  The mother asks for one thing in return: both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the parents' house every Friday.  Lorelai and Rory have had minimal contact with them over the years, so this is an unwelcome change, but one they agree to.The clashes between Lorelai and her parents is fascinating, especially because the parents are just as complex as Lorelai and Rory, with character-driven surprises coming to view.  All of the characters change and grow in logical, organic ways, and the stories flow very well.Another treat is the rapid-fire banter the series is rightly celebrated for.  Laden with humor and obscure references, this is the best part of this wonderful show.  There is also, in the Season Two set, a booklet of &#34;Gilmore-isms&#34; that explain some of the more arcane references from that season.  You have to listen quickly to catch them all, or watch episodes again to get some of the references.  It's reminiscent of the best of Hepburn and Tracy, and then some.Most of the action takes place in the fictional town of Stars Hollow.  Replete with engaging characters, truly deserving of the greatly overused word &#34;quirky&#34;, they add charm and comedy, as well as some drama, to the show.  Each of the characters has a story, sometimes more than one, but many of them will remind you of people you know or have known.  The saying, &#34;All of us are stars in our own lives, and bit players in the lives of everyone else,&#34; has special meaning here.  All of the residents of Stars Hollow have their own stories, their own concerns and worries, some of which may seem trivial, but aren't played that way.  Stars Hollow doesn't exist in the real world, but I'd move there in an instant if it did.For all that it touches on serious matters, Gilmore Girls does so with an underlying sense of humor, but without making light of anything the characters experience.  Okay, not *too* light, but the humor and poignancy, as well as the real relationships with their ups and downs, are very enjoyable to watch.Since my girlfriend's introduction to Gilmore Girls, she can't wait to see more, and agrees it's very well written, and a joy to watch.  She's told her mother, sister and others about it, and now they can't wait to borrow this set to see what all the hullabaloo is about.I highly recommend Gilmore Girls to anyone with a heart, sense of humor, or love of good entertainment.",5,"Excellent Value, Great Show",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3106,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'long-time', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'fan', 'never', 'thought', 'buy', 'show', 'discovered', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'show', 'collection', 'excellent', 'intro', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'recommend', 'set-up', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'had', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'age', 'sixteen', 'wedlock', 'embarrassing', 'wealthy', 'status-conscious', 'parents', 'now', 'sixteen', 'years', 'later', 'Independence', 'Inn', 'Rory', 'short', 'Lorelai', 'BTW', 'qualified', 'go', 'Chilton', 'ritzy', 'college', 'preparatory', 'private', 'school', 'Desperate', 'pay', 'tuition', 'Lorelai', 'grudgingly', 'parents', 'money', 'Rory', 'can', 'attend', 'eventually', 'go', 'Harvard', 'mother', 'one', 'thing', 'return', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'must', 'attend', 'dinner', 'parents', 'house', 'Friday', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'have', 'had', 'minimal', 'contact', 'years', 'unwelcome', 'change', 'one', 'agree', 'to.The', 'clashes', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'parents', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'complex', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'character-driven', 'surprises', 'coming', 'view', 'characters', 'change', 'grow', 'logical', 'organic', 'ways', 'stories', 'flow', 'very', 'well.Another', 'treat', 'rapid-fire', 'banter', 'series', 'rightly', 'celebrated', 'Laden', 'humor', 'obscure', 'references', 'best', 'part', 'wonderful', 'show', 'also', 'Season', 'Two', 'set', 'booklet', '34', 'Gilmore-isms', '34', 'explain', 'more', 'arcane', 'references', 'season', 'have', 'listen', 'quickly', 'catch', 'watch', 'episodes', 'again', 'get', 'references', 'reminiscent', 'best', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'then', 'some.Most', 'action', 'place', 'fictional', 'town', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'Replete', 'engaging', 'characters', 'truly', 'deserving', 'greatly', 'overused', 'word', '34', 'quirky', '34', 'add', 'charm', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'show', 'characters', 'story', 'sometimes', 'more', 'one', 'many', 'will', 'remind', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'known', 'saying', '34', 'are', 'stars', 'own', 'lives', 'bit', 'players', 'lives', 'everyone', 'else', '34', 'special', 'meaning', 'here', 'residents', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'have', 'own', 'stories', 'own', 'concerns', 'worries', 'may', 'seem', 'trivial', 'are', ""n't"", 'played', 'way', 'Stars', 'Hollow', ""n't"", 'exist', 'real', 'world', ""'d"", 'move', 'there', 'instant', 'serious', 'matters', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'so', 'underlying', 'sense', 'humor', 'making', 'light', 'anything', 'characters', 'experience', 'Okay', 'not', '*too*', 'light', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'relationships', 'ups', 'downs', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Since', 'girlfriend', 'introduction', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'joy', 'watch', 'told', 'mother', 'sister', 'others', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'borrow', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'hullabaloo', 'about.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'anyone', 'heart', 'sense', 'humor', 'love', 'good', 'entertainment']",Gilmore Girls - The Complete First & Second Seasons

Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. It's an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estranged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible. Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the charm in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman, Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval. Meanwhile, Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. Coupled with rapid fire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show, Gilmore Girls is a rare gem indeed- great casting, engaging storylines and well-developed characters. A must-watch indeed!",5,"Witty, fun, and very addictive!",1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,2951,"['all-time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'episode', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'great', 'casting', 'difference', 'drama', 'life', 'exploits', 'single', 'mother', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', '[', 'amazing', 'Lauren', 'Graham', ']', 'who', 'only', 'child', 'Rory', '[', 'stunning', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', ']', 'idyllic', 'town', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'somewhere', 'Connecticut', 'amazing', 'drama', 'episode', 'here', 'Season', 'One', 'really', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'characters', 'main', 'secondary', 'come', 'care', 'what', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'Season', 'One', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Rory', 'accepted', 'prestigious', 'private', 'school', 'Chilton', 'Lorelai', 'grapple', 'problem', 'how', 'finance', 'desperation', 'estranged', 'parents', 'help', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'mother', 'daughter', 'electrifying', 'altogether', 'credible', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'Emily', 'Richard', 'Gilmore', 'are', 'portrayed', 'stuffy', 'upper-class', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'money', 'means', 'keep', 'tabs', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'course', 'stories', 'go', 'deeper', 'characters', 'develop', 'greater', 'depth', 'series', 'herein', 'charm', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'repartee', 'stellar', 'acting', 'characters', 'make', 'show', 'strength', 'strength', 'addict', 'viewer.The', 'residents', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'are', 'eccentric', 'bunch', 'indeed', 'be', 'Luke', 'Luke', 'Diner', 'Ms', 'Patty', 'dance', 'teacher', 'Taylor', 'town', 'councilman', 'Michel', 'crabby', 'concierge', 'Sookie', 'St', 'James', 'irreverent', 'cook', 'BFF', 'Lorelai', 'Lane', 'Kim', 'Rory', 'sidekick', 'come', 'love', 'characters', 'role', 'series.Season', 'Two', 'sees', 'revisiting', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'idyllic', 'little', 'Connecticut', 'town', 'home', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'are', 'interesting', 'plot', 'developments', 'season', 'Lorelai', 'engaged', 'Max', 'dilemmas', 'inner', 'conflict', 'Rory', 'stable', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'long-term', 'boyfriend', 'threatened', 'arrival', 'Jess', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'NY', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Luke', 'nephew', 'course', 'turbulent', 'relationship', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'Gilmore', 'more', 'upheaval', 'Meanwhile', 'Luke', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'are', 'other', 'interesting', 'developments', 'season', 'make', 'GG', 'addictive', 'must-watch', 'Rory', 'rivalry', 'Paris', 'Geller', 'Richard', 'forced', 'retirement', 'aftermath', 'Christopher', 're-entry', 'Gilmore', 'girls', 'lives', 'many', 'more', 'eccentric', 'townspeople', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'appeal', 'show', 'Taylor', 'Doose', ""'dictatorship"", ""'"", 'town', 'new', 'heights', 'Kirk', 'manic', 'antics', 'many', 'more', 'Coupled', 'rapid', 'fire', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'become', 'trademark', 'show', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'rare', 'gem', 'indeed-', 'great', 'casting', 'engaging', 'storylines', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'must-watch', 'indeed']",Gilmore Girls - The Complete First & Second Seasons
