1605739,A13UPPKNU1BO13,B00A4TMLMC,A. Irey,"[2, 2]","The big sell for this card was the return of Georges St-Pierre.  His last fight was April of last year where he defeated Jake Shields.  Hew as then scheduled to face Nick Diaz at UFC 137, and then Carlos Condit at the same event after some rescheduling.  With two weeks before the actual event it was reported that St-Pierre had to pull out of the fight due to a knee injury.  Then, in December with a new event on the horizon for the St-Pierre/Condit fight, St-Pierre then announced that he injured his ACL.  In a strange way, this can be seen as the beginning of UFC's bad luck with injuries continuing thus far into the year still.  In the time afterwards, Condit went on to capture the Interim Title in a fight that has been talked about and analyzed to the point of exhaustion.  So, 18 months later recuperated and healthy, fans are finally able to witness the fight that had originally been scheduled a year earlier.Mark Hominick started the night off with a fight against Pablo Garza.  Mark Hominick has had something of a rough streak since his loss against current champion Jose Aldo.  Not only has his professional career been on the downturn, he has suffered personal loss as well.  As a fan favorite with an exciting style and strong heart I've had a hard time seeing his decline so this fight served as a good chance for him to get back in the winner's column.  In all fairness though, Pablo Garza was in very much the same situation.  He had a great deal of success, winning his first two fights in the UFC with great first round finishes, before losing his last two fights.  With his name on the chopping block it was apparent that both men had a lot to fight for on this night.  Initially it was a rather competitive fight with both fighters looking strong but it wasn't long until one fighter just became too much for the other to handle.  If you're like me, it's one of those fights that becomes hard to watch as the performance of the loser was just too little for any real interest to build.The next fight was unfortunately for me, something of a low-point.  Mark Bocek is known as a very good ground specialist and while he has found moderate success in the UFC he has never been able to break into top contendership, always losing against the bigger guns of the Lightweight division.  Given the state of the Lightweight division though that should not come across as a surprise since that is a shark tank of a division.  Honestly, what other division has had as much turn over in the past five years of the company's existence?  Oh, maybe the Light-Heavyweight but I digress.  Rafael dos Anjos is similar to Bocek in several respects.  With a reputation for having a pretty good ground game he has also displayed some power in his fists, which by combining the two has allowed him to have some success in the UFC.  Unfortunately, this fight was just flat out boring for me.  I don't discredit the skills of either man but for the life of me I could not get into this fight.  I will say the winner played the kind of fight he needed in order to start challenging the best in the division although how much his skills have improved will definitely be something to gauge in his next fight.I said the last fight was something that I considered a low-point but this is the fight that takes the cake.  This may come across as harsh but Tom Lawlor and Francis Carmont had arguably one of the worst fights of the year.  I'll be honest, Tom Lawlor is a funny guy with some very interesting walk-ins and his weigh-ins are typically pretty entertaining.  Along with this, he's one of The Ultimate Fighter alumni to find a steady career in the UFC which is nothing to scoff at given how poorly some do.  His opponent, Carmont, has won three straight fights since coming to the UFC and was looking pretty strong with two submission finishes in that run.  If the fight was competitive it only had its moments which is kinda sad since it looked like this fight had a lot going for it.  Honestly, this is the kind of fight you would go on to forget about if weren't for the fact that the victor seemed to come as a surprise to almost everyone.  Of course, to say there was a winner is... maybe not the best terminology.In the co-main event Martin Kampmann squared off against Johny Hendricks.  Kampmann has had something of an interesting career if you've followed him since his arrival in the UFC.  He's always had great technique, both on the ground and the standup, and for some reason most of his fights are pretty exciting.  Kampmann started his career at Middleweight, which is almost shocking given how at home he seems at Welterweight, before losing to Nate Marquardt and coming down a weight class.  He's had incredible success throughout his career only losing a handful of times against the top of his respective divisions so it seems right that he should be in such a good marquee fight, which holds title shot implications.  In his way is a wrestler known as Johny Hendricks.  Hendricks made his debut in the UFC after only 6 fights and since has been on an absolute tear of the division.  With his only hiccup coming at the hands of Rick Story his MMA record is pretty damn good.  His fights are a toss up between two styles of fights: the first is the kind where he allows his wrestling skills to dictate the fight and this has been sort of successful to pretty successful, the second kind involves his left hand landing square on the jaw of an individual and cancelling out any relative thoughts, feelings, or movements in the following seconds.  Think Dan Henderson's right hand in the left hand of a welterweight, I joke you not.  Now, with both fighter's pension for exciting fights I thought this looked like an interesting fight, and while the fight itself may not be interesting the finish certainly is.  The only reason I say the fight isn't all that interesting is because the fight itself only lasts little over half a minute before the finish happens so take what you will from that.  So, just don't blink or be prepared to rewind a lot because the finish is quick and nasty.As I've stated, the big hype around this night was the return of GSP.  Not only that, but he was coming back a legitimate threat to his crown in Carlos Condit who was the Interim Champion.  Add to that the fact that St-Pierre was returning in his home country of Canada and you had pure energy.  I'm not going to lie or sugarcoat it, I had straight out goosebumps.  It was almost like getting an early Christmas present.  Now, I've talked enough about how this fight came to be but in talking about the fight itself it's really hard to say much without giving too much away.  It's the kind of fight that really allows both fighters to look strong and shine.  Not only that, but the fight itself is exciting and regardless of who you're a fan of I think everyone who has watched this fight came away happy about the performances.  If this fight doesn't end up on ""The Best of 2012"" (IN FULL!!!) then I will be extremely disappointed.Given how I've talked about the last two fights it may come across strange for how low a score I'm giving the event itself but one good fight and one awesome finish does not save an entire card in my mind.  The prelims did not provide a lot of strong moments as well so overall while the main draw of the event was successful the entire card was not in my opinion.",3,UFC 154...,1353888000,"11 26,

1605740,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B00A4TMLMC,Cestmoi,"[0, 1]","Only one fight was worth watching. That was the one between Marck Hominick and Pablo Garza. All three rounds captivated me. It's because it's a balanced fight where both fighters had equal skills. In round 1, fighter 1 took down Fighter 2 and hit him hard many times. In round 2, fighter 2 turned the table. Now, he's the one who was on top literally. Round 3 was very suspenseful to me because I could not predict who was going to win. It's also a bloody fight too. One of the fighters got multiple cuts on his face and bled a lot. It's scary.I'm sorry I could not refer to these fighters by their real names. Otherwise, it would ruin your enjoyment.The long-awaited bout between Georges St-Pierre and Carlos Condit was a huge disappointment. One guy dominated the fight from beginning till the end.
