Im a former soilder myself and have been witness to similiar situations in combat that have really left a post tramatic impression on me. Thank god I have had alot of support from my family and friends, unfortunatly that is not the case with Jim. He has no family whatsoever other then his surrogate brother portrayed exceptionally by Freddy Rodriguez. He is alone, frustrated with his life, and is a deeply troubled individual. He is in search of happiness but rejects it when it is knocking on his door. He has a chance to marry his beautiful girlfriend but choses a life of violence in joining a special op task force for the homeland security dealing with drug cartels in south america. This flick can be disturbing at times, not for the faint of heart, but it is really realistic in the portrayal of friendship, loyalty, and true brotherhood. I give David Ayer props for this gutsy story he has written and directed. I have to say that this movie is almost good as Training Day which he wrote as well. He is a talented up and coming director. Deserving of 4.5 stars but I gave it 5 because of the connection that I had with Christian Bales character. Its a great movie that is underated and probably misunderstood.

645257,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00005JP2Y,Anton Ilinski,"[24, 37]","If you think you know what to expect from David Ayer... you're quite right. Films he wrote scripts for share much in common. Training Day and Dark Blue were just like twin brothers, The Fast and the Furious and S.W.A.T. also had this theme of contemporary criminal cities. So here's Harsh Times. LA again, South Central again, plot revolving around two main characters again except now Ayer occupied the director's chair.Harsh Times came out to be rather small and maybe modest, but on the exterior only. It has a huge amount of meaning and sense inside. At first glance the film looks pretty simple but the next day after watching it a thought came to my mind - hey, this seems to be the second Taxi Driver! In 1976 Scorsese showed us the lost generation returning from the Vietnam war, its frustrations and inability to become integrated into a normal life. Now, 30 years later we see the situation's the same. New wars - old problems. Only in Taxi Driver we probably saw a person being transformed mentally bacause of the war, and here Ayer deliberately emphasise the fact that war alone doesn't change people. It changes dreadfully those who were mentally unstable from the very beginning, who shouldn't have gone to the army at first place. There are violent individuals who go to war to have a possibility to kill people. These individuals have to be cured instead of being enlisted. Because when they come back they're changed forever and the only way they know from that moment on is the way of the gun.We see this in Christian Bale's character - the way he smiles during the battle in the beginning of the film showing he derives pleasure from what's going on, the way he acts in normal life afterwards where he can't get used to everything's changed. And we see he wants to join police force because it's pretty much the same to what he got used to. He accepts a possibility to go on a special mission to Colombia with enthusiasm - because he will be able to kill again.Ayer's hidden an important message in Harsh Times - as long as governments see their soldiers as cannon fodder, they'll keep getting mentally ill and lethally dangerous individuals at the outlet. A country's recovery can only be achieved if establishment cares about its people. Other way we'll keep on receiving one lost generation after another because wars don't seem to end in nearest future. We see a small, particular case in this film and God knows how many of these cases are out there. It makes you think. I hope this movie will make a lot of people think and will become for this decade at least a small part of what Taxi Driver has become for 70s and 80s.",4,TAXI DRIVER... 30 YEARS LATER,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2646,"['think', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'David', 'Ayer', ""'re"", 'quite', 'right', 'Films', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'share', 'much', 'common', 'Training', 'Day', 'Dark', 'Blue', 'were', 'just', 'like', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'S.W.A.T', 'also', 'had', 'theme', 'contemporary', 'criminal', 'cities', 'So', 'here', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'LA', 'again', 'South', 'Central', 'again', 'plot', 'revolving', 'around', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'again', 'now', 'Ayer', 'occupied', 'director', 'chair.Harsh', 'Times', 'came', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'small', 'maybe', 'modest', 'exterior', 'only', 'huge', 'amount', 'meaning', 'sense', 'inside', 'first', 'glance', 'film', 'pretty', 'simple', 'next', 'day', 'watching', 'thought', 'came', 'mind', 'hey', 'be', 'second', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '1976', 'Scorsese', 'showed', 'lost', 'generation', 'returning', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'frustrations', 'inability', 'become', 'integrated', 'normal', 'life', 'Now', '30', 'years', 'later', 'see', 'situation', 'same', 'New', 'wars', 'old', 'problems', 'Only', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'probably', 'saw', 'person', 'being', 'transformed', 'mentally', 'war', 'here', 'Ayer', 'deliberately', 'emphasise', 'fact', 'war', 'alone', ""n't"", 'change', 'people', 'dreadfully', 'who', 'were', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'very', 'beginning', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'army', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'violent', 'individuals', 'who', 'go', 'war', 'have', 'possibility', 'kill', 'people', 'individuals', 'have', 'be', 'cured', 'instead', 'being', 'enlisted', 'when', 'come', 'back', ""'re"", 'changed', 'forever', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'moment', 'way', 'gun.We', 'see', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'character', 'way', 'battle', 'beginning', 'film', 'showing', 'pleasure', 'what', 'going', 'way', 'normal', 'life', 'afterwards', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'everything', 'changed', 'see', 'join', 'police', 'force', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'what', 'got', 'used', 'possibility', 'go', 'special', 'mission', 'Colombia', 'enthusiasm', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'kill', 'again.Ayer', 'important', 'message', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'as', 'long', 'governments', 'see', 'soldiers', 'cannon', 'fodder', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'getting', 'mentally', 'ill', 'lethally', 'dangerous', 'individuals', 'outlet', 'country', 'recovery', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'establishment', 'cares', 'people', 'Other', 'way', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'receiving', 'one', 'lost', 'generation', 'wars', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'end', 'nearest', 'future', 'see', 'small', 'particular', 'case', 'film', 'God', 'how', 'many', 'cases', 'are', 'there', 'think', 'hope', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'will', 'become', 'decade', 'least', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'become', '70s', '80s']",N/A

I'll get to the point.  The only reason I even bring it up is because we've had to change our movie rental affiliations.  We used to be regular and frequent customer of Hollywood video because the last 2 places we lived were a short walk away from the local affiliate.  But not long ago we found out it was more economically practical to use Netflix (no late fees and lots of movies at a fixed monthly rate).  Now, we live a short walking distance from a Blockbuster store, where we can now use the gift cards which have been languishing and accumulating following the last couple of Christmas seasons that our residential proximity has until recently favored Hollywood Video.So what in the hell does this have to do with the movie HARSH TIMES?  I'm not entirely sure I like the tone you're using, but it's a fair question.  We rented this movie and several others as a means of circumventing the waiting time it would take us to get them on Netflix.  Why this film in particular?  Because Christian Bale tends to pick interesting projects and does a pretty good job in them, so we figured it might be worth a look.Bale stars as Jim Davis, a U.S. Army soldier returning to inner-city Los Angeles from combat in the war on terror (more likely in Afghanistan than Iraq, based on the flashback sequence).  He has 3 major goals on his return to the States:  join the L.A.P.D., marry his Mexican sweetheart (who is actually from and still in Mexico), and get into trouble with all his ""homies"".  For reasons that will soon become apparent to the audience, his application is rejected by the L.A.P.D. in spite of his otherwise outstanding credentials.  This is an unfortunate catalyst for several reasons.  Not only does it complicate his goals and ignite his frustration and embitterment, but also because Jim is not the kind of guy who should remain idle for significant periods of time, lest his darker/more unstable side should take a more influential role in guiding his actions.Although Jim was supposedly an exceptional soldier in an elite unit, his personal characteristics seem to belie a personality that wavers between engaging in sporadic mayhem and even towards self-destructive decision-making.  His best friend Mike (Freddy Rodriguez) is a loyal buddy and might even be a good guy in some ways, although he also shares Jim's proclivity for irresponsible behavior and often lacks or fails to demonstrate a grown-up sense of propriety.  These two borderline ne'er-do-wells spend their days getting wasted - and in Mike's case - blowing off job searching and leaving phony messages about job interviews, for the benefit of his finitely patient wife (Eva Longoria).Just as it seems Jim's life might irrevocably tumble down a spiraling path of chaos and nihilism, a remarkably fortuitous opportunity for Jim presents itself.  But in order for this to work out, Jim would have to overcome the impulse-driven behavior that seems to be a firmly ingrained facet, and his time is quickly running out with no change in sight.  Although you won't like Jim, you still hope that he will finally clean up his act.I thought Bale did a really good job of defining the character and portraying him believably, using his talent for combining understated performances with high octane bursts of furious energy, all with effective timing.  Although, I did have some reservations about his character's believability.  In my military experience (which includes 3 years in the Special Operations command), Jim's more disturbing character traits would not have been compatible with success in the Army Rangers.  Though the SEALs and Delta Force may have a little of an air or reputation for roguishness, the Ranger community is a more strictly orthodox environment of formality which expects not only remarkable soldiering abilities like the other elite military units, but one that also demands outstanding bearing and conduct and appearance at all times.  Even if he is exceptionally brave and tough and competent, I just don't see a guy with Jim's background and obvious character lapses making it long enough to earn his Ranger tab.  I'm not saying it could never happen, but it is highly unlikely and difficult to believe.Another thing that the film left me with was a thought about a guy I knew in the service.  In some ways, he reminded me a little of the Jim Davis character (including a mild physical resemblance).  They were both gung ho, strong, tough, charismatic, and had other positive attributes which helped others overlook - but sometimes were in jeopardy of being undermined by - some substantial emotional/mental issues.  Another parallel between them was that one had an incident which took his career down a path where it eventually stalled just as it looked like he was really going places, while the other got a second chance at professional redemption; conversely, one of them ended up with a decent life otherwise, while the other did not.",3,Thought-provoking and evocative more than likable,1184025600,"07 10,

Middleton,"[3, 4]","Following Christian Bales acting career is like watching an Olympic swimmer, pushing the boundaries, pushing the improbable to finally win the gold medal to then come back after fours years and do it all again, breaking world records performing like a new star. There seems there's nothing this actor will not attempt to do to push his talent and skill in terms of submerging himself into a character. Whether his performance as the yuppie killer inAmerican Psychoor the emaciated empty headed somnambulist inThe Machinistor even the serious caped crusader in the excellentBatman Beginsall characters hit the mark, all believable, all extremely well done.In this realistic drama, he portrays a post traumatic psychotic returned from a tour of duty from somewhere in the Middle East. Bale as Jim Davis does a believable performance, however, does not gain the sympathy (so required in a role like this) from the audience. Something is missing but what exactly is missing?Freddy Rodriguez,Six Feet Underas Mike Alonzo does a fair job as the irresponsible old buddy badly influenced by Jim Davis's pleas to party and make trouble when Freddy should be looking for a job. Their repartee in Davis's car is realistic and sadly true of two old friends holding on to their respective past, and refusing to grow up. Despite the fact that the two characters are in their late twenties, the dialogue is distinctly adolescent as their drunken and pot fuelled antics while driving the streets of South Central L.A. all too often reveal.The beautiful Eva LongeriaDesperate Housewivesplays Alonzo's lawyer wife, gently pushing the boy like a concerned and nagging mother to get a job. Similar to a confused teenager, to cover the fact that he's drinking with Davis, has his friends telephone his home and leave messages as potential employers. He gets caught to then act like a guilty fourteen year old as his beautiful wife kicks him out of the house - loser realism at its most pathetic.The film begins to change as the two boy's finally land jobs. Although for the psychotic recent war Vet, Jim Davis, his behaviour turns bad, his psychotic breaks more out of control, and the entire fate of these characters and the film now heads on a downward rollercoaster to hell.Apart from the fact that these druggy antics and violent behaviours from Jim Davis went on far too long throughout the film, Bale never shows us something in the character we can sympathize with...the character is insane to begin with and he just goes more insane as the film progresses. Because the boy is a Vet and most likely a war hero in the traditional sense, like Vietnam, society will not let him back into `normality' because trained killers, soldiers who return from action, are more often damaged goods.This is the message of the film: Western governments send our boys to war and expect them to do their duty and kill the enemy. But the support they so direly need when returning from the hell of war, attempting to fit back in to society is forgotten. That is why some soldiers continue going back for extra tours, because that's all they know and can do.Harsh Times is a realistic film, well acted but missed one aspect so necessary in a story of this kind, creating sympathy for the main character. We get the point but as the character is too far gone, we'd rather not look at it or... care.",3,Ayer film hits hard but misses necessary emphasis,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,3363,"['Following', 'Christian', 'Bales', 'acting', 'career', 'watching', 'Olympic', 'swimmer', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'pushing', 'improbable', 'finally', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'fours', 'years', 'do', 'again', 'breaking', 'world', 'records', 'performing', 'new', 'star', 'nothing', 'actor', 'will', 'not', 'attempt', 'do', 'push', 'talent', 'skill', 'terms', 'submerging', 'character', 'performance', 'yuppie', 'killer', 'inAmerican', 'Psychoor', 'emaciated', 'empty', 'headed', 'somnambulist', 'inThe', 'Machinistor', 'even', 'serious', 'caped', 'crusader', 'excellentBatman', 'Beginsall', 'characters', 'hit', 'mark', 'believable', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.In', 'realistic', 'drama', 'post', 'traumatic', 'psychotic', 'returned', 'tour', 'duty', 'somewhere', 'Middle', 'East', 'Bale', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'believable', 'performance', 'however', 'not', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'so', 'required', 'role', 'audience', 'Something', 'missing', 'what', 'exactly', 'missing', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Underas', 'Mike', 'Alonzo', 'fair', 'job', 'irresponsible', 'old', 'buddy', 'badly', 'influenced', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'pleas', 'party', 'make', 'trouble', 'when', 'Freddy', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'job', 'repartee', 'Davis', 'car', 'realistic', 'sadly', 'true', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'holding', 'respective', 'past', 'refusing', 'grow', 'up', 'fact', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'late', 'twenties', 'dialogue', 'distinctly', 'adolescent', 'drunken', 'pot', 'fuelled', 'antics', 'driving', 'streets', 'South', 'Central', 'L.A.', 'too', 'often', 'reveal.The', 'beautiful', 'Eva', 'LongeriaDesperate', 'Housewivesplays', 'Alonzo', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'gently', 'pushing', 'boy', 'concerned', 'nagging', 'mother', 'get', 'job', 'Similar', 'confused', 'teenager', 'cover', 'fact', 'drinking', 'Davis', 'friends', 'telephone', 'home', 'leave', 'messages', 'potential', 'employers', 'caught', 'then', 'act', 'guilty', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'kicks', 'house', 'loser', 'realism', 'most', 'pathetic.The', 'film', 'change', 'two', 'boy', 'finally', 'jobs', 'psychotic', 'recent', 'war', 'Vet', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'behaviour', 'bad', 'psychotic', 'breaks', 'more', 'control', 'entire', 'fate', 'characters', 'film', 'now', 'downward', 'rollercoaster', 'hell.Apart', 'fact', 'druggy', 'antics', 'violent', 'behaviours', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'Bale', 'never', 'something', 'character', 'can', 'sympathize', 'character', 'insane', 'begin', 'just', 'more', 'insane', 'film', 'boy', 'Vet', 'most', 'likely', 'war', 'hero', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Vietnam', 'society', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'back', 'normality', 'because', 'trained', 'killers', 'soldiers', 'who', 'return', 'action', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'damaged', 'goods.This', 'message', 'film', 'Western', 'governments', 'send', 'boys', 'war', 'expect', 'do', 'duty', 'kill', 'enemy', 'support', 'so', 'direly', 'need', 'when', 'returning', 'hell', 'war', 'attempting', 'fit', 'back', 'society', 'forgotten', 'why', 'soldiers', 'continue', 'going', 'back', 'extra', 'tours', 'know', 'can', 'do.Harsh', 'Times', 'realistic', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'missed', 'one', 'aspect', 'so', 'necessary', 'story', 'kind', 'creating', 'sympathy', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'point', 'character', 'too', 'far', 'gone', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'look', 'care']",N/A

645266,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00005JP2Y,C. Sawin,"[19, 19]","Jim is the type of guy that anyone may know. He served his time as a soldier and now it's his dream to become a cop in Los Angeles. The problem is not only does he spend most days drinking, smoking pot, and looking for ways to either get laid or kick the snot out of someone, but his time as a soldier gets to him more than he lets on. He has nightmares every night and usually wakes up screaming, has cold chills, and is just one step away from the brink of insanity. His best friend, Mike, just wants to get a job so he can make his wife happy, but his drinking problem gets him into more trouble than it should. Jim and Mike hang out all the time, so when one gets in trouble the other one has his back. While Mike has his wife, Sylvia, Jim has a girlfriend, Marta, back in Mexico who he hopes to get across the border once he gets that dream job. So when Jim gets a call from Homeland Security and Mike has an interview go really well at one of the best businesses in town, they think their lives are beginning to look up. But what'll happen when Jim finally gets pushed too far? Who will he take it out on and how many people will be caught in the crossfire?This movie kind of plays out like some of my favorite songs. Things start off slow, but are slowly building towards a big finale. Once things start rolling, it's inevitable to try and resist the mayhem that's sure to ensue. That's a perfect way to describe Harsh Times. The film is generally about a subject I usually have no interest in, but the characters involved, the way events unfold, and the way Christian Bale portrays Jim Luther Davis kept me watching. Watching Jim and Mike basically flush their lives down the toilet by being the screw ups they are was enough to keep my attention, but the film's true gem, other than Christian Bale's performance(which I'll get to momentarily), is the last twenty minutes or so of the film.Other than the ending, the film has one really surprising scene that caught me off guard. It's just so spontaneous and no one will see it coming. It's an interesting scene, as well. It puts what Jim went through as a soldier into perspective as what happens in said scene doesn't phase him at all, but Mike is practically traumatized in the process. It seems kind of unimportant at the time, but is one of the first scenes that comes to mind after the credits begin to roll.Christian Bale never ceases to amaze me in the films he's a part of and he's done so yet again. It's interesting that he's had so many different accents amongst all the roles he's had and he's added another one to his repertoire. I guess the weirdest thing for me was watching him as Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and then watching this after that. Now I'm going to expect to hear Batman say something like, ""Yeah, homie. That's how we roll in these streets, dawg,"" the next time I see either one of those films. It's just a transition I didn't expect him to make and so flawlessly. Bale's characterization is also shown in top form in this film, as well. The transformation he makes from beginning to end is incredible. The way the film is edited when Jim is going through one of his episodes is also a nice touch. You know that once the screen has that yellow tint to it that something big is about to go down.Harsh Times is a crime, drama, thriller that is definitely worth the watch. While the film may not appeal to everyone, it probably has more to offer than anyone gives it credit for. Christian Bale doesn't disappoint as his characterization is as strong as ever this time around. If you're a Christian Bale fan, then there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this film. If not, then I still highly recommend it for the finale of the film alone. If you like films ending on an intense note, then you're sure not to go away empty handed. This seems like a film that tends to be overlooked by people that should definitely be giving it more praise than I've ever heard anyone give it. See this film.",4,Overlooked.

Mike, his friend, is also searching for a job, but choosing instead to party it up with Jim.  But the attrocities Jim saw (and committed) in the war begin to wear on him, encouraging the violent side that lay dormant until then, and he slowly drags Mike down with him, spiraling to a breakdown that could shatter their friendship...if they survive it.I wasn't sure what to expect from ""Harsh Times.""  I've become quite a fan of Christian Bale lately; and I loved Freddy Rodriguez in ""Planet Terror,"" and thought he would be a great dramatic actor (little did I know, he has a lot of experience in the field; my bad homey, as Mike would say).  But I wasn't sure about the concept, if it could hold my attention the entire two hours of the film.Well, it did, largely thanks to two great performances from the leads.  True, Bale doesn't flesh out this role as well as he has others, but he's still one of the best out there.  Rodriguez matches him step-for-step, creating one of the best dramatic pairings I've seen in quite some time.  Eva Longoria and Tammy Trull, as the love interests on the two men, shine in their brief--yet important--performances.  J.K. Simmons offers some nice levity as a Homeland Security agent; it's one of the few light-hearted moments in the film, and even then there's something simmering underneath--when Simmons mutters to Bale ""We're all a little wacko here,"" a momentary chill runs down your spine.The script--by director David Ayer--is fairly good, especially in the film's second half; it's first half feels like Street Lingo 101, full of ""dudes"" and ""homeys"" and the like.  It's also a bit strange, seeing the Welsh Bale acting like an American soldier who wants to be an Hispanic gangbanger; Bale's Spanish is spoken low and rapidly, probably so we don't pick up on the accent.  Still, those are just minor flaws; once the movie pulls you in--as it will--you'll be on the edge of your seat, moved by tragedy (there's little redemption here, sorry) these two men face as their friendship slowly unravels.

It is a pretty good depiction of relationships and the street life. BTW, there won't be much plot discussion here as it has been done plenty already. Why rehash it? Anyway Christian Bale is brilliant in his portrayl of a returning Vet to the mean streets of South Central(that would be LA if you don't know)who falls into his old patterns and takes Freddy Rodriquez, his homie, along the inevitable tragic and destructive path. There is plenty of violence, some of it schocking. It is one of those movies where you are enjoying the mayhem but know it is going to be a sad ending. Well sad, if only you sympathize with the characters, which apparently many people did not. If testosterone driven movies are your thing than you will love this movie. If you over think it you might not like it. Back to Bale's character, which is totally believeable and full of rage, confusion and macho supercharged. These guys exist, I've met them , known them and stayed clear of them.They are hell bent on self destruction and are taking prisoners, in this case, Freddy Rodriguez. Christian Bale is a psycho-cool guy who walks the line between the socio-cultural world of his ""homies"" and the straight world of law enforcement(homeland security)like a well balanced cat. His character can go from saying ""yo vato"" to ""yes sir"" without missing a beat. It is fun to watch. I  really enjoyed his performance, thought Freddy Rodriguez was  above average and Eva Longoria(now Parker)was smoking hot and the only sensible character in the movie. I loved the relationship between Bale and Longoria. It was the hate my man's best friend but love my man relationship. She fights to keep him to her self.Why do some women do that? Anyway this movie was very cool, had me riveted throughout but the first half was better than the I-know-this-is-going-to-end-bad second half.If you can relate to the world of homies and their cronies, like action flicks and want to see a good performance by Christian Bale than check this movie out.",4,Gritty  performance dawg,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,2108,"['reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'came', 'away', 'feeeling', 'film', 'misunderstood', 'pretty', 'good', 'depiction', 'relationships', 'street', 'life', 'BTW', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'plot', 'discussion', 'here', 'been', 'done', 'plenty', 'already', 'Why', 'rehash', 'Anyway', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'brilliant', 'portrayl', 'returning', 'Vet', 'mean', 'streets', 'South', 'Central', 'would', 'be', 'LA', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'old', 'patterns', 'Freddy', 'Rodriquez', 'homie', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'destructive', 'path', 'plenty', 'violence', 'schocking', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'enjoying', 'mayhem', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'sad', 'ending', 'Well', 'sad', 'only', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'apparently', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'testosterone', 'driven', 'movies', 'are', 'thing', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'might', 'not', 'Back', 'Bale', 'character', 'totally', 'believeable', 'full', 'rage', 'confusion', 'macho', 'supercharged', 'guys', 'exist', ""'ve"", 'met', 'known', 'stayed', 'clear', 'them.They', 'are', 'hell', 'bent', 'self', 'destruction', 'are', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'case', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'psycho-cool', 'guy', 'who', 'line', 'socio-cultural', 'world', 'homies', 'straight', 'world', 'law', 'enforcement', 'homeland', 'security', 'well', 'balanced', 'cat', 'character', 'can', 'go', 'saying', 'yo', 'vato', 'yes', 'sir', 'missing', 'beat', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'thought', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'now', 'Parker', 'was', 'smoking', 'hot', 'only', 'sensible', 'character', 'movie', 'loved', 'relationship', 'Bale', 'Longoria', 'was', 'hate', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'love', 'man', 'relationship', 'keep', 'self.Why', 'do', 'women', 'do', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'had', 'riveted', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'better', 'I-know-this-is-going-to-end-bad', 'second', 'half.If', 'can', 'relate', 'world', 'homies', 'cronies', 'action', 'flicks', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'performance', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'check', 'movie', 'out']",N/A
645273,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00005JP2Y,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","While watching this flick I couldn't help but think of how much it reminded me of ""Training Day."" Then I find out both scripts had the same writer and it all came flooding in.Here's the scoop. Jim is back from a tour in the Mid-East where he was a ranger and saw and did a lot of nasty stuff. He's in Mexico with some bad nightmares and a woman he plans to marry. He heads back up to the US to clinch a job with the L.A.P.D. He hooks up with his long-time bud Mike, who is supposed to be looking for a job, and the two set off on various self-destructive adventures.It's tough watching Jim, a guy on the edge, not only get into situations that can do him nothing but harm, but also to pull his weak-willed buddy down with him. Mike has a commitment to his wife to find a job but spends his days boozing and drugging with Jim. They also get into tight situations where they are buying and selling drugs and guns. This is South Central L.A. Not the place to be doing this sort of thing if you value your life. It's one ugly episode after another with the tension dial rising with each one. Therein lies part of the problem with this film. It's a downward spiral of someone you are supposed to feel sorry for but don't. Yes he's haunted by the war but he's a bad guy so you don't care as much as you should. And Mike is so weak willed you want to shake him and tell him to grow a pair. Even in a key scene, after he's found a job, and is mending things with his wife, he throws it all away because he cannot stand up to his bud.Another problem, as in ""Training Day"", is that a potentially horrible scene is relived through a coincidence. In ""Training Day"" it happens once. Here it happens three times. Sorry. Ain't happening. But the writing overall, particularly the dialogue, is really good. The viewer gets a good feel for the grit on the streets. The acting is all top shelf and the directing, editing, music, etc. are all spot on. This is a good movie that may or may not have had the potential to be great. A few tweeks in the script might have helped, but it's still pretty dismal to watch.",4,Underline the Word Harsh,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2094,"['watching', 'flick', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'reminded', 'Training', 'Day', 'Then', 'find', 'out', 'scripts', 'had', 'same', 'writer', 'came', 'flooding', 'in.Here', 'scoop', 'Jim', 'back', 'tour', 'Mid-East', 'where', 'was', 'ranger', 'saw', 'did', 'lot', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'Mexico', 'bad', 'nightmares', 'woman', 'marry', 'back', 'up', 'US', 'clinch', 'job', 'L.A.P.D', 'up', 'long-time', 'bud', 'Mike', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'job', 'two', 'set', 'off', 'various', 'self-destructive', 'adventures.It', 'tough', 'watching', 'Jim', 'guy', 'edge', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'situations', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'harm', 'also', 'pull', 'weak-willed', 'buddy', 'down', 'Mike', 'commitment', 'wife', 'find', 'job', 'days', 'boozing', 'drugging', 'Jim', 'also', 'get', 'tight', 'situations', 'where', 'are', 'buying', 'selling', 'drugs', 'guns', 'South', 'Central', 'L.A.', 'Not', 'place', 'be', 'doing', 'sort', 'thing', 'value', 'life', 'one', 'ugly', 'episode', 'tension', 'dial', 'rising', 'one', 'Therein', 'part', 'problem', 'film', 'downward', 'spiral', 'someone', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'haunted', 'war', 'bad', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'Mike', 'so', 'weak', 'willed', 'want', 'shake', 'tell', 'grow', 'pair', 'Even', 'key', 'scene', 'found', 'job', 'mending', 'things', 'wife', 'away', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'bud.Another', 'problem', 'Training', 'Day', 'potentially', 'horrible', 'scene', 'relived', 'coincidence', 'Training', 'Day', 'once', 'Here', 'three', 'times', 'Sorry', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'happening', 'writing', 'overall', 'particularly', 'dialogue', 'really', 'good', 'viewer', 'good', 'feel', 'grit', 'streets', 'acting', 'top', 'shelf', 'directing', 'editing', 'music', 'etc', 'are', 'spot', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'few', 'tweeks', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'still', 'pretty', 'dismal', 'watch']",N/A

645276,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B00005JP2Y,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[2, 3]","Gritty doesn't begin to describe this somber, very dark vision of two close friends in Los Angeles. A warning right here: this movie is not for the faint of heart. I'm sure Los Angelenos would rather not have this image of its citizenry emblazoned on the minds of the movie-viewing public, but I'm beginning to get the impression that at least certain areas of that city are pretty dangerous places to visit.Jim Davis (Christian Bale) returns from Iraq with a serious case of killing fever and a burning ambition to become a law enforcement officer. His childhood best friend Mike (Freddy Rodriguez), a likeable follower, doesn't realize that his friend, whom he obviously hero-worships, has gone over to the dark side; he is visibly troubled by early exhibitions of the change in Jim (road rage directed at a stranger after reading a turn-down letter from the LAPD) but apparently assumes it is a passing phase. Together the two buddies drift into a pattern of cruising the streets and reconnecting with questionable old contacts and smoking and drinking the day away. Mike is ostensibly out leaving resumes (he is out of work) and under pressure from his successful wife (Eva Longoria), who is a lawyer, to get a job. Jim is Mike's transportation; and Jim goes from highs to lows in his endeavours to become an officer. After his turn-down from the City, he indulges in a little sorry-for-himself pot-smoking with Mike; and the next day receives a call from Homeland Security to come in for a urine test. I'm not exactly sure what procedure he applies to circumvent the residual THC in his urine - it appeared to be painful - but whatever he does, he somehow passes the test and is called back by the Feds. They aren't exactly fooled by him, however; the leader of an elite force within Homeland Security is shopping for a character like Jim, who can kill with impunity and lack of remorse and is willing to bypass a few inconsequential points like pot-tainted pee. This is the opportunity Jim has been waiting for and he jumps at it.There is a hitch, however; Jim has a sweetheart in Mexico whom he wants to marry, but the Feds convince him now is not the time. They sign him up to ship him out the next week, and he decides to have one last fling in Mexico, and take his buddy Mike and another good friend along for the ride.From here a story that has been grim and heartless almost throughout sinks into despair. Jim suffers from flashbacks, which are aggravated by conflict; Mike, a basically sweet guy who at heart wants to straighten up and fly right chooses, against the will of his wife, to go to Mexico - right after he has won her approval of him by getting a great job; she argues with Jim about taking her husband on a fool's errand, and Mike misses the warning signs of Jim's flashpoint anger and decides to side with his buddy over his wife. In retrospect, he really should have stayed at home.This is a sad, dark movie, aptly named. It's hard to work up any empathy for anyone in it, except possibly for Mike and his wife, who are struggling (and succeeding, on the part of the wife) to come out on the sunny side. Mike has been guilty of bad behaviour in the past, and is guilty of going along with Jim's schemes now, but with a finite point in view; ultimately he is reaching for respectability. Jim is like a man-eating tiger; he has gotten the taste of death in his mouth, and cannot escape the need for it.For those who appreciate such violent, bloody films (there is a high body count here), it is well-acted, well-paced, and understandable. It certainly kept my attention.

There is this certain pride people get out of being out of control. The central character is this and more. Harsh Times has an appropriate title. The best thing about the movie is the last one minute. I loved the last scene. One's able to relate to a lot of paranoia the central characters feel in this city world. Christian Bale was a bit too convincing in his role, there is no reason one can possibly like his character. Freddy R acted quite well and came up with the goods though I kept wondering where I've seen him before. Freddy's character is passive while Christian Bale does his own ""American History X"" The first hour reminded me of a movie called ""Knockaround Guys"" in terms of the animated characters and impulse driven scenes. The reason this film fails to deliver the knockout punch is mainly because of Bale's character.

You can obviously see that Ayer is sticking to the sort of territory that he's most comfortable with, so it's hard to blame the guy for trying to recreate the same magic in his directorial debut, ""Harsh Times.""  This story revolves around Jim (Christian Bale) and Mike (Freddy Rodriguez), two buddies who spend their days cruising the streets of L.A. on the lookout for trouble. Jim is a war veteran who's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, while Mike wants to straighten up and fly right - if only to prevent his longtime girlfriend, Eva Longoria, from walking out on him. Ayer emphasizes an appropriately gritty sense of style, refusing to shy away from some of the more unpleasant aspects of Jim and Mike's tumultuous lives. And though Rodriguez and Bale have an equal amount of screen time, there's absolutely no denying that Bale is the central attraction here. Ever since Rodriguez left his role in ""Six Feet Under"" he has been regulated to supporting roles in ensemble movies, like ""Poseidon"" and ""Lady in the Water,"" but this is the first role of significance for him since becoming a prominent actor on ""SFU.""  He is very good here, and he has great chemistry with Bale. Whereas Eva Longoria character is badly underwritten and deserves a far meatier role to show of her undeniable acting skills.There is nothing new or original in this film, but it is never dull or boring and it keeps you with it until the end, despite its incredible flights of implausible incidents and odd coincidences. It does have the distinction though of being the first film to focus on a contemporary Iraq war veteran, but we sadly only see the violent effects of Jim's supposed post-war psychosis and not a hint of explanation as to the causes of his inner demons. Shot quickly over 26 days with a lot of energy and fizz, using super 16mm stock and real locations, the film looks suitably realistic and grimy and you quickly buy into the gritty urban landscape and the skuzzy and confused people who inhabit it.Unfortunately, Ayer doesn't quite know when to quit, and as a result Harsh Times goes on for a good half hour longer than it needs to. The engaging vibe of the first half is replaced with something far more sinister towards the end, and though it seems logical that these characters would wind up where they do, the film does become somewhat less engaging because of it. Still, there's no doubt that Harsh Times - as a first effort - comes off as uncommonly well, primarily thanks to Bale who is also the executive producer of this film.",3,"[3.5]--""Dude the army messed you up man...you should sue them.""",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2587,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'can', 'obviously', 'see', 'Ayer', 'sticking', 'sort', 'territory', 'most', 'comfortable', 'hard', 'blame', 'guy', 'trying', 'recreate', 'same', 'magic', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'story', 'Jim', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Mike', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'two', 'buddies', 'who', 'spend', 'days', 'cruising', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'lookout', 'trouble', 'Jim', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'suffering', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'Mike', 'straighten', 'up', 'fly', 'right', 'only', 'prevent', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'walking', 'out', 'Ayer', 'appropriately', 'gritty', 'sense', 'style', 'refusing', 'shy', 'away', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'aspects', 'Jim', 'Mike', 'tumultuous', 'lives', 'Rodriguez', 'Bale', 'have', 'equal', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'absolutely', 'denying', 'Bale', 'central', 'attraction', 'here', 'Ever', 'Rodriguez', 'left', 'role', 'Six', 'Feet', 'been', 'regulated', 'supporting', 'roles', 'ensemble', 'movies', 'Poseidon', 'Lady', 'Water', 'first', 'role', 'significance', 'becoming', 'prominent', 'actor', 'SFU', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Bale', 'Whereas', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'character', 'badly', 'underwritten', 'far', 'meatier', 'role', 'show', 'undeniable', 'acting', 'skills.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'film', 'never', 'dull', 'boring', 'end', 'incredible', 'flights', 'implausible', 'incidents', 'odd', 'coincidences', 'have', 'distinction', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'focus', 'contemporary', 'Iraq', 'war', 'veteran', 'sadly', 'only', 'see', 'violent', 'effects', 'Jim', 'supposed', 'post-war', 'psychosis', 'not', 'hint', 'explanation', 'causes', 'inner', 'demons', 'Shot', 'quickly', '26', 'days', 'lot', 'energy', 'fizz', 'using', 'super', '16mm', 'stock', 'real', 'locations', 'film', 'suitably', 'realistic', 'grimy', 'quickly', 'buy', 'gritty', 'urban', 'landscape', 'skuzzy', 'confused', 'people', 'who', 'inhabit', 'it.Unfortunately', 'Ayer', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'when', 'quit', 'result', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'longer', 'engaging', 'vibe', 'first', 'half', 'replaced', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'end', 'logical', 'characters', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'where', 'do', 'film', 'become', 'somewhat', 'less', 'engaging', 'Still', 'doubt', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'first', 'effort', 'off', 'uncommonly', 'well', 'primarily', 'thanks', 'Bale', 'who', 'also', 'executive', 'producer', 'film']",N/A

It's an urban crime drama with a heavy human element, similar in theme to the scripts he wrote for Training Day, Dark Blue, and S.W.A.T.  While the themes are similar, this is an original plot, with rich characters that the viewer might just have a hard time sympathizing with.  The movie is set in South Central Los Angeles and focuses on the job searches of two best friends, the violently unbalanced ex-Army Ranger Jim (played by Christian Bale) and the partying, fast-talking sales-guy-type Mike (played by Freddy Rodriguez).  Jim and Mike spend more time cruising, drinking, and smoking pot than they do looking for work.  Both have female love interests--Jim's beautiful Mexican girlfriend and Mike's no-nonsense wife Sylvia.The two men are utterly unlikable as they mooch of society and commit crimes.  Jim is especially violent and unpredictable, and seems unsuited for civilian life after leaving the Army.  The women in the movie bring out the human side to the pair of friends.  Jim is turned down for a job by the LAPD, but gets snagged by the Department of Homeland Security for high-level consulting in Columbia.  He wants to pull of one last scam before shipping out, and the movie climaxes in one unforgettable night around the Mexican border.

unpredictable character.His service in the military has ""pernamently"" destroyed a person who was once not much different than you or I.An individual who was more stable and even tempered at one time.No longer.After his dischange from the military and strugling to fit into his new civillian lifestyle,Jimmy(Bale) more or less does what he wants.He drinks in the moring,or more or less throughout the day,smokes weed and basically attempts to antagonize others.It is obvious from the begining he is on a self destructive path and drags his friends and all else along for the ride.This certainly also isn't a good film for military recruitment.If this is what they do to people who enlist and then not do anything for them unpon their release,the federal government should be ashamed.I am a fan of Christian Bale,he is turning out to be a great actor and he also takes risks with is acting career doing small films such as this.I don't really care much about Eva Longoria and perhaps I'm biased because I hate the T.V show she is on,""Desperate House Hookers"".Her character wasn't interesting and I didn't really care what happened to her.Freddy Rodriguez(correct me if I'm wrong) was Jimmy's right man,his best friend.His involvement in this unstable friendship between him and Jimmy was the focal point of this film.They more or less had a ""negatively dependent relationship"".They both drank,did drugs and everything else together.This film is basically about Jimmy headed on a downward spiral of violence and bad flash backs from his military experiences all leading to the very uneasy and depressing end.This was a decent film,but I honestly didn't really care for it.Bales portrayl of an man who was more or less ""loosing it"" was just too much.This isn't a film with a Disney ending and it was pretty ugly from start to end.The performances were grand,but the film leaves a bad taste and flavor.See it for the superb acting,but I can't recomend this film

645290,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B00005JP2Y,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[3, 12]","After watching ""Harsh Times"" we wondered ""Is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life?"" we couldn't believe what we were watching. It was meant to be the new 2006 version of ""Training Day""--they even got Christian Bale to play the lead role--but only in the eyes of the people involved in it. It was a miscalculation and we'll explain why.Brief Story:The movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of L.A. Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a mentally unstable young Iraq War veteran. Now in the States, he is looking for a job as a cop. Jim's best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) is also unemployed, but when his friend comes to visit, they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities--selling drugs, guns, getting high just to name few. To spend time with his friend, Mike has to lie to his girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria) making her believe that he is looking for a job. She doesn't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face.Review:""Harsh Times"" has many problems, but the most notorious one is the crime ""video game"" feeling it has throughout the film. The characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a ""Grand Theft Auto"" or ""Scarface: The World Is Yours"" video game adaptation with a little bit of ""Cheech & Chong"" in the mix. There is no climax--we just see them driving to different places, arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end. Christian Bale's accent in this movie doesn't help either, not only it changes through out the film, but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate. The dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like--also there is no chemistry between them. The acting in this movie is disappointing, especially from Bale who we liked in movies like ""American Psycho"", ""Batman Returns"" and ""The Prestige."" It is clear that he was miscast this time. He just cannot do what Denzel Washington did in ""Training Day."" Because of his accent and terrible acting in this film, we believe this is his worst performance to date. This is something he doesn't want to add to his resume.The Verdict:Christian Bale Returns, but this new American Psycho cannot find his Equilibrium. ""Harsh Times"" tries too hard to create the edgy, dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that ""Training Day"" had, but it doesn't even come close to achieve that goal. We laugh at the silliness of the story, overdramatic acting and Christian Bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year. He probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor. This is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent.",2,"Christian Bale Returns, but this new American Psycho cannot find his Equilibrium.",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2794,"['watching', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'wondered', 'comedy', 'are', 'just', 'mocking', 'inner', 'city', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'new', '2006', 'version', 'Training', 'Day', 'even', 'got', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'play', 'lead', 'role', 'only', 'eyes', 'people', 'involved', 'was', 'miscalculation', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'why.Brief', 'Story', 'movie', 'place', 'mostly', 'dangerous', 'inner', 'city', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'young', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veteran', 'Now', 'States', 'looking', 'job', 'cop', 'Jim', 'best', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Alonzo', 'Freddy', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'also', 'unemployed', 'when', 'friend', 'visit', 'prefer', 'hang', 'out', 'commit', 'kinds', 'illegal', 'activities', 'selling', 'drugs', 'guns', 'getting', 'high', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'spend', 'time', 'friend', 'Mike', 'lie', 'girlfriend', 'Sylvia', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'making', 'believe', 'looking', 'job', ""n't"", 'know', 'world', 'crime', 'are', 'involved', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'might', 'face.Review', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'many', 'problems', 'most', 'notorious', 'one', 'crime', 'video', 'game', 'feeling', 'film', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'watching', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'Scarface', 'World', 'Yours', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'little', 'bit', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'mix', 'climax', 'just', 'see', 'driving', 'different', 'places', 'arguing', 'committing', 'kinds', 'crimes', 'anything', 'conclusive', 'very', 'end', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'accent', 'movie', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'accent', 'trying', 'emulate', 'dialogue', 'two', 'friends', 'feels', 'forced', 'teenager-like', 'also', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'Bale', 'who', 'liked', 'movies', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'Prestige', 'clear', 'was', 'miscast', 'time', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'did', 'Training', 'Day', 'accent', 'terrible', 'acting', 'film', 'believe', 'worst', 'performance', 'date', 'something', ""n't"", 'want', 'add', 'resume.The', 'Verdict', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Returns', 'new', 'American', 'Psycho', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'Equilibrium', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'too', 'hard', 'create', 'edgy', 'dramatic', 'style', 'dangerous', 'inner', 'city', 'life', 'Training', 'Day', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'achieve', 'goal', 'laugh', 'silliness', 'story', 'overdramatic', 'acting', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fake', 'accent', 'film', 'be', 'worst', 'year', 'probably', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'miscalculation', 'great', 'proportions', 'agent']",N/A

He's not as fluid and mesmerising as Al Pacino in ""Dog Day Afternoon"", but you still can't take your eyes off Bale in this film.  This isn't a perfect work of art by any means, and it's hard to like two characters who roll around LA in a big car getting drunk and high all the time and talking trash.  But like it or not, this story has its feet planted in street reality.  I believed Bale's character with all his evil baggage and his complete inability to rebuild his life and redeem himself.  It was obvious that he had left the best parts of himself behind in Afghanistan and nobody back home was ever going to help him get his mind right.  The character arc is no doubt predictable.  You know our man is a bomb and he's going to explode.  But the way it happens seems totally believable to me.  The way Ayer handled the violence in this film reminds me of Michael Cimino's work in ""Year of the Dragon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"".  It creeps up on you slow and in your face, but still shocks and rattles you.  ""Harsh Times"" is not a family flick.  And yeah, it's damned depressing.  You won't watch it with your girlfriend or young children.  But it deserves a good hard look.  These vets will all be coming home one of these days.

However, with that being said, even Christian couldn't save this movie. Forgive me for saying, but Christian Bale is NOT! what's wrong with this movie. This was just another attempt at re-creating ""Training Day"" that failed miserably. Don't get me wrong, these 2 movies do have the same Director, and they do share the same mood, feeling, elements, and qualities. It's just that with ""Harsh Times"" I couldn't connect with this story, and I felt that it was dragged out at times. Frankly, I thought this movie was all over the place. I think that Christian Bale has a talent for playing these very dark and borderline psychotic characters, and there was no exception with this movie, but if you wanna be impressed I suggest you watch..""The Machinist"", ""The Prestige"", ""American Psycho"" or even ""Batman Begins"" to get a good Christian Bale fix. In my opinion, all those films have way more of a plot and depth to them which I found way more interesting than seeing him as a shell shocked former soldier reduced to a common, drug abusing, homicidal, street thug on the warpath. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed with the movie as a whole, and it's not Christian's fault. Afterall, he was just doing the best he could do with what he was given.

As a south central Los Angeles streetwise white guy, it's astonishing to hear this Brit nail the speech mannerisms and character of what fundamentally amounts to a crazed loser who doesn't know a good thing when he sees it.Still having nightmares about his experience in the Gulf War as a soldier, Jim Davis (Bale) gets rejected by the LAPD for a job, but also gets contacted by Homeland Security--they're interested in him as a candidate. With a girlfriend in Mexico and his best friend a Mexican-American Angeleno (Freddy Rodriguez as Mike), Davis goes cruising with Mike through the mean streets of the city, basically looking for trouble. Davis is fluent in Spanish--another reason Homeland Security is interested in him (you'll see what I mean when you see the movie).And they find it. Murder figures largely in this movie--one of the murders is really shocking--as well as humiliation, deception, and truly crazed behavior. Eva Longoria turns in a solid performance as a somewhat believable girlfriend of Mike who's now a lawyer, but still ""addicted"" to street language when he provokes her into it based on devious behavior. And old reliable J.K. Simmons is fine in a small role as a Homeland Security agent who knows Davis is a man with trouble embedded deep inside him.As one of the producers of the movie, Bale obviously had more at stake here than just his role as an actor, but he really does ""tear up the screen"" as the DVD cover blurb states. Directed by David Ayer, who also wrote the screenplay for Training Day--a similar movie in which Denzel Washington proved he could be as great a bad guy on screen as he could a good guy--Harsh Times has the same close juxtaposition of good and evil in a dangerous environment.Davis' Mexican girlfriend, Marta, really loves him a lot--so much so that even when he starts truly flipping out on her, she still tells him she is madly in love with him.

For me, its trash talking macho adolescent high jinks where the plot moves fast, the action never stops and there are guns and violence and drugs.  My kind of film!That's the plot of this 2005 flick I caught on TV the other night.  It stars Christian Bale as the war veteran.  He starts off all lovey dovey with his Mexican sweetheart.  He's American and is going back over the boarder to get a job as a cop.  He tells her he will return to Mexico, marry her, bring her to America and live happily ever after.  Yeah!

Jim reconnects with his childhood friend Mike (Freddy Rodriguez) from the hood after returning from serving as a Ranger in Iraq or Afghanistan (I never caught the specifics) where his anger issues were put to good use by the government.  As the men renew their brotherly bond, they also revisit their drinking, drugging and gansta days while Jim waits to hear back from his LA police application and Mike supposedly looks for another job after being laid off.We know no good can come from their slide backwards and we watch in horror as it unfolds violently before us.  Although Jim is turned down by the police department, that is not what leads to his ultimate undoing.  It is when he stands at a cross road and makes a decision that on paper would seem to be the better choice that leads to his furious descent.  Jim appears to be the essential Ranger material, stoic and unafraid of anything but we see the truth when he can't sleep without horrific nighmares , we see the cost of his outer bravado that not even his best friend Mike can crack. Jim obviously has problems that are only excerbated by the career path he has chosen over the simple life with his Mexican girlfriend.  The beauty and peacefulness of his life in the poor and desolent town in Mexico is poignantly juxtapositioned against the more desirable yet destructive and violent life in California.  We also see the comparision of Jim and Mike, both from the same neighborhood and with the same problems yet the choices made at the end, seals their different fates.One of the points the film seems to make it that it's just as important - if not more - to pay attention to the inner self as much as the exterior or material.  It didn't matter how many second chances Jim was given, we knew he was never going to make it but couldn't help watching to the very end.",4,not great but keeps you glued to the screen,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,2299,"['rated', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'even', 'felt', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'little', 'removed', 'character', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'plot', 'kept', 'glued', 'screen', 'waiting', 'Jim', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'totally', 'self-destruct', 'yet', 'delivered', 'unexpected', 'way.I', 'watched', 'film', 'expecting', 'one', 'thing', 'reading', 'blurb', 'Jim', 'self-destructs', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'LA', 'police', 'department', 'summary', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'anywhere', 'close', 'Jim', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'hood', 'returning', 'serving', 'Ranger', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'never', 'caught', 'specifics', 'where', 'anger', 'issues', 'were', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'government', 'men', 'renew', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'also', 'revisit', 'drinking', 'drugging', 'gansta', 'days', 'Jim', 'waits', 'hear', 'back', 'LA', 'police', 'application', 'Mike', 'supposedly', 'job', 'being', 'laid', 'off.We', 'know', 'good', 'can', 'come', 'slide', 'backwards', 'watch', 'horror', 'violently', 'Jim', 'turned', 'down', 'police', 'department', 'not', 'what', 'ultimate', 'undoing', 'when', 'cross', 'road', 'decision', 'paper', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'furious', 'descent', 'Jim', 'be', 'essential', 'Ranger', 'material', 'stoic', 'unafraid', 'anything', 'see', 'truth', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'horrific', 'nighmares', 'see', 'cost', 'outer', 'bravado', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'Mike', 'can', 'crack', 'Jim', 'obviously', 'problems', 'are', 'only', 'excerbated', 'career', 'path', 'chosen', 'simple', 'life', 'Mexican', 'girlfriend', 'beauty', 'peacefulness', 'life', 'poor', 'desolent', 'town', 'Mexico', 'poignantly', 'juxtapositioned', 'more', 'desirable', 'yet', 'destructive', 'violent', 'life', 'California', 'also', 'see', 'comparision', 'Jim', 'Mike', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'same', 'problems', 'yet', 'choices', 'made', 'end', 'seals', 'different', 'fates.One', 'points', 'film', 'make', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'not', 'more', 'pay', 'attention', 'inner', 'self', 'as', 'much', 'exterior', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'second', 'chances', 'Jim', 'was', 'given', 'knew', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'watching', 'very', 'end']",N/A

It sounded interesting enough.  What I didn't realize was how powerful of a movie it was going to be.  Christian Bale plays a man who grew up in a Latino community and his best friend is played by Freddy Rodriguez.  Bale fought terrorists in Afganastan or some place over there and the way they explain his character he sounds like a killing machine. He and Freddy Rodriguez are looking for jobs and Christian Bale already has one set up.  But then he gets a letter saying he is uneligible to become part of the LAPD.  He freaks out a bit, but then gets recruited by Homeland Security.  So now he just has to drive Freddy Rodriguez around so he can find a job.  This leads to a lot of drinking and driving and leaving fake messages on Freddy Rodriguez's answering machine so his wife thinks he is actually looking for a job.  But, Christian Bale little by little ends up going crazy because of the effects of going to the war, and Freddy Rodriguez doesn't realize it until too late.  I really don't want to give anything away, but the thing I liked most about this movie was that all the events played out like you would think they would in real life.  The violence, the way friends talk to eachother, the job process...  The movie just gets better and better as it goes along, and only lets up a bit towards the end, but it is still a great movie.  Christian Bale is amazing as expected, but Freddy Rodriguez really blew me away.

His accent is not present at all, which is a change from most of the movies in which he plays an American. Even though the character is deplorable and mostly unlikeable, you find yourself on his side for most of the movie. That's hard to pull off in a film, but I give credit to Bale and not the writing.-Mike Alonzo does a very good job as the hapless straight man to Bale's insane man. And Alonzo is a very underrated actor.-Some moments were laugh out loud funny, while others were genuinely emotional.Now on to the negative--This film has terrible pacing. Scenes do not flow organically at all. It will jump from wacky hijinks to murder in 3 seconds, and some scenes just end abruptly before they feel complete.-The plot is thin. As in it barely exists. The story feels like it's the last chapter of a book, but we never got to read the rest of it before we got there.-Some of the dialog is so bad it makes me cringe.-Bale and Alonzo carried the movie, completely.If you like Training Day more than a lot, you'll like this.

Good guys are never just good guys in real life, or in a David Ayer script (TRAINING DAY). Sometimes they are conflicted and sometimes they're just plain old criminal punks. And sometimes they're walking on the edge of a criminally insane abyss. Ayer writes mostly crime drama with rogue cop elements and cop-gone-bad conflict. Ayer directs here for the first time. Christian Bale plays Jim, a whacked-out psychopathic ex-Ranger, recently discharged from Active Duty in The Middle East. Jim drags his best friend Mike, played by Freddy Rodriguez, thru the crime ridden streets of Hispanic East L.A. and down into the dark abyss of his personal psychosis. The two wander aimlessly thru their days drinking, smoking reefer, looking for trouble, and trying to sell a stolen gun. Mike is pretending to look for work, while Jim searches for a law enforcement job that will provide him with a license to kill. The L.A.P.D. doesn't want him, but Homeland Security does. But, something insane is about to spoil Jim's ""dream job"" ...That something is Jim.While the plot appears mundane, the inner life of these two men is anything but prosaic.The script is an actor's dream. It is a showcase character piece for the fine acting talent of Christian Bale. He produced the film. In my opinion, this is his best performance. (I thought he was ""F"" ing Great in AMERICAN PSYCHO and THE MACHINIST, but he really excels in this performance. Not once did I think I was watching Christian Bale. Or Patrick Bateman.) Everytime he squints his eyes or turns his head in this film, you're bracing yourself for what might follow. A brilliant actor in an amazing role. Freddy Rodriguez is equally impressive in his role. At first, the two seem oddly incompatible. By the end of the film, they are wallowing in on-screen chemistry. They also have great comic timing together. Excellent job!Eva Longoria plays Mike's girlfriend. She is poignant and beautiful.The dialogue is a humorously realistic mix of brazen street lingo and (subtitled) Spanish. Some of it is downright hilarious!""That's a serious breech of the homey code, man.""Like other reviewers, I was instantly struck with this film's resemblance to TAXI DRIVER.

They walk among you, they hold good paying high profile ""respectable"" jobs; however, if you had any idea what goes on inside thier heads - you would hide under your bed.

It's actually decent, and very reminissent of training day...which both films are from the same director. It was slow at points, but I was captured in the plot because I wanted to see How the whole thing would fall appart...and it eventually does.  One other reviewer said he didn't see right away Christian Bale's character was crazy, no, to me it was pretty clear.  And Rodriguez's performance was great as well.  This I feel is a gem of a movie, especially the acting, just poorly promoted.  THe storyline is unique as well. Check it out, its different, in a good way.  It makes you  think about our soldiers and also those we hire for police and security as well.",4,"Interesting Movie, great performances, Definitely Harsh time.",1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,722,"['ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'taking', 'such', 'thrashing', 'actually', 'decent', 'very', 'reminissent', 'training', 'day', 'films', 'are', 'same', 'director', 'was', 'slow', 'points', 'was', 'captured', 'plot', 'wanted', 'see', 'How', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'fall', 'appart', 'eventually', 'One', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'right', 'away', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'character', 'was', 'crazy', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Rodriguez', 'performance', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'feel', 'gem', 'movie', 'especially', 'acting', 'just', 'poorly', 'promoted', 'THe', 'storyline', 'unique', 'as', 'well', 'Check', 'out', 'different', 'good', 'way', 'think', 'soldiers', 'also', 'hire', 'police', 'security', 'as', 'well']",N/A
