Instead he's been replaced with ""Spyke,"" nephew of Storm.There's no reason for this substitute except for ""diversity"" and this unnecessary change really lessens the quality of the story.I'm a huge Ice-Man fan.

758902,A133QJQ67D3CI1,B00009WVLJ,Lindsay Ann Comeau,"[0, 0]","I first encountered this series as a child and since then have kept a sweet place for it in my mind. I always enjoyed the re-runs and watched all of the seasons with avid passion. For anyone who doesn't know what X-Men Evolution is all about, it follows the chronicles of everybody's young favorite mutant as they travel through awkward teen years/high school/ and the discovery of their mutant powers. For anyone yearning to rediscover favorite characters I highly recommend this. Excellent animation, loved the storylines and character portraits. Once I heard that this wonderful series had not only been taken off the air, but been taken off the market, I ran to Amazon because I knew I had to find it. Reasonable pricing, arrived ahead of due date in great condition.I enjoyed rediscovering this fun series and although perhaps aimed at a younger audience, there is a beautiful depth to many of the on-screen characters (Rogue, Nightcrawler and Scarlett Witch, to name a few).

758903,A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B00009WVLJ,Pecos Bill,"[6, 6]","It's certainly true that X-Men: Evolution is toned down in terms of violence.  It's aimed more for PG-13, not R as the other rater seems to want.But it's still an excellent show, and anyone who can enjoy the movies should certainly enjoy the animated series.  If you hated the movies due to inaccuracies with the comic books then you won't like this series either.  The characters in the series are nearly identical to the ones from the movies, with the exception of Nightcrawler.  In the movies, he was blue and covered with self-inflicted tattoo scarring.  In the series he's blue, fuzzy and lighthearted.  Wolverine, Cyclops, Xavier, Magneto, etc, are characters you'll be immediately familiar with from the movies.Is this a show intended to capture the attention of X-Men comic book loyalists?  Probably not.It's a show about a group of young people coming into mutant powers who find themselves thrust into the role of superhero.... or supervillian, depending on if they chose to join the X-Men or ally with Magneto.  The animation style is colorful and contemporary, the voice acting is excellent, there's enough action and laughs to entertain the younger crowd and enough character development and plotline to keep an older crowd entertained as well.  It's X-Men in a format friendly enough for primetime.  The character interactions are much richer than you typically find in animated superhero shows and it's just an all around great show.Like any book (or comic book) converted to film, don't get so hung up on what got changed or ""left out"" and this will be a series you can really enjoy.Also, check out the boxed set which has all of season 1.",5,"If you liked the X-Men movies, you should love this",1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,1655,"['certainly', 'true', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'toned', 'down', 'terms', 'violence', 'aimed', 'more', 'PG-13', 'not', 'R', 'other', 'rater', 'want.But', 'still', 'excellent', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'should', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'animated', 'series', 'hated', 'movies', 'due', 'inaccuracies', 'comic', 'books', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'either', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'nearly', 'identical', 'ones', 'movies', 'exception', 'Nightcrawler', 'movies', 'was', 'blue', 'covered', 'self-inflicted', 'tattoo', 'scarring', 'series', 'blue', 'fuzzy', 'lighthearted', 'Wolverine', 'Cyclops', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'etc', 'are', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'be', 'immediately', 'familiar', 'movies.Is', 'show', 'intended', 'capture', 'attention', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'book', 'loyalists', 'Probably', 'not.It', 'show', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'coming', 'mutant', 'powers', 'who', 'find', 'thrust', 'role', 'superhero', 'supervillian', 'depending', 'chose', 'join', 'X-Men', 'ally', 'Magneto', 'animation', 'style', 'colorful', 'contemporary', 'voice', 'acting', 'excellent', 'enough', 'action', 'entertain', 'younger', 'crowd', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'plotline', 'keep', 'older', 'crowd', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'X-Men', 'format', 'friendly', 'enough', 'primetime', 'character', 'interactions', 'are', 'much', 'richer', 'typically', 'find', 'animated', 'superhero', 'shows', 'just', 'around', 'great', 'show.Like', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'converted', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'hung', 'up', 'what', 'got', 'changed', 'left', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy.Also', 'check', 'out', 'boxed', 'set', 'season', '1']",X-Men: Evolution - UnXpected Changes
