Wilkins ""star gazer""","[0, 0]","While there was no final outcome, and there should have been, to properly end this series,  there were still some great episodes here. Samurai vs. Samurai was a funny episode in which Jack must deal with a crude rude upstart who has far more braggadocio than he does skill. The Scotsman again returns to discover Jack has run afoul of something nasty enough to wipe his mind and he takes an unwilling Jack on a journey to get his mind back in a wonderful two part episode that is something of a take off on &#34;Star Wars&#34;. There is again plenty of &#34;Star Wars&#34;-like action where we hear what sounds like Jeff Daniels of C-3PO fame, taking on the role of Chitron-6, a robot belonging to a prince and princess on an urgent mission to save their world when they fall afoul of Aku. There is also a funny mano y mano fight between Aku and Jack as Jack forces him to fight on his level and a flash back story to a younger time while Jack trained in Africa. The very last, Jack and the baby, dealt with a baby held captive for dinner by trolls and his efforts to return him to his mother. While this season was good, it wasn't really finished, and I wished it could have been, because I'm sure it would have been spectacular.",5,"Great, but needed closure....",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1230,"['was', 'final', 'outcome', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'properly', 'end', 'series', 'were', 'still', 'great', 'episodes', 'here', 'Samurai', 'Samurai', 'was', 'funny', 'episode', 'Jack', 'must', 'deal', 'crude', 'rude', 'upstart', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'braggadocio', 'skill', 'Scotsman', 'again', 'discover', 'Jack', 'run', 'afoul', 'something', 'nasty', 'enough', 'wipe', 'mind', 'unwilling', 'Jack', 'journey', 'get', 'mind', 'back', 'wonderful', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'something', 'take', 'off', '34', 'Star', 'Wars', '34', 'again', 'plenty', '34', 'Star', 'Wars', '34', 'action', 'where', 'hear', 'what', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'C-3PO', 'fame', 'taking', 'role', 'Chitron-6', 'robot', 'belonging', 'prince', 'princess', 'urgent', 'mission', 'save', 'world', 'when', 'fall', 'afoul', 'Aku', 'also', 'funny', 'mano', 'y', 'mano', 'fight', 'Aku', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'fight', 'level', 'flash', 'back', 'story', 'younger', 'time', 'Jack', 'trained', 'Africa', 'very', 'last', 'Jack', 'baby', 'dealt', 'baby', 'held', 'captive', 'dinner', 'trolls', 'efforts', 'return', 'mother', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'finished', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spectacular']",Samurai Jack: Season 4

We'd come to the tv when the new episode was coming on - we couldn't wait to see it. I think my husband and I loved the artwork the most in this show - we'd be so amazed at how beautiful the art and colors were. We had great fun watching Samurai Jack together.Season 4, the last Season - we tried to catch all the episodes on tv and were very sad that the very last episode did not allow us to see Jack getting home. The series didn't seem to have a polish to it near the end. We were really very disappointed that we were just left hanging at the end, that episode being like any other episode in the series, in where you're still hoping for him to get home and you have no satisfaction of finality either.Regardless of this disappointing detail, this series, the show, the story,  the writers, the illustrators, and the creator gets 5 stars from us!  We're very happy to own the entire series. Thank you for putting it out on DVD for us.Side note: We loved Mako's voice as Aku, and when we started watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, we realized right away that Uncle Iroh and Aku's voice were the same. Through this we learned a little about Mako and his life, and truly enjoyed his voice-acting work in these two of our favorite animated series.",5,"Hope You Get Home Somehow, Samurai Jack",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1300,"['watched', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'family', 'loved', ""'d"", 'come', 'tv', 'when', 'new', 'episode', 'was', 'coming', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'think', 'husband', 'loved', 'artwork', 'most', 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'amazed', 'how', 'beautiful', 'art', 'colors', 'were', 'had', 'great', 'fun', 'watching', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'together.Season', '4', 'last', 'Season', 'tried', 'catch', 'episodes', 'tv', 'were', 'very', 'sad', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'see', 'Jack', 'getting', 'home', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'polish', 'end', 'were', 'really', 'very', 'disappointed', 'were', 'just', 'left', 'hanging', 'end', 'episode', 'being', 'other', 'episode', 'series', 'where', ""'re"", 'still', 'hoping', 'get', 'home', 'have', 'satisfaction', 'finality', 'either.Regardless', 'disappointing', 'detail', 'series', 'show', 'story', 'writers', 'illustrators', 'creator', '5', 'stars', ""'re"", 'very', 'happy', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'Thank', 'putting', 'out', 'DVD', 'us.Side', 'note', 'loved', 'Mako', 'voice', 'Aku', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'realized', 'right', 'away', 'Uncle', 'Iroh', 'Aku', 'voice', 'were', 'same', 'learned', 'little', 'Mako', 'life', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'voice-acting', 'work', 'two', 'favorite', 'animated', 'series']",Samurai Jack: Season 4

1074889,AM4UVNWCW9NJE,B000QCU534,iansomniak,"[7, 8]","Unpredictable.  Illogical.  Impossible.  He is THE ONE!  Samurai Jack--defender of truth, freedom, and talking dogs--is back for a fourth and final season of futuristic hacking and slashing.  Set 4's two discs come in a cardboard slipcase, tastefully decorated in a gold honeycomb pattern with Aku's hideous likeness prominently featured on the front (unless your fold-out disc-holder is upside-down and backwards, as mine was).  Disc 2 includes a nice selection of extras like promos, deleted scenes, and a very interesting visit with the show's creators entitled, `Genndy's Roundtable.'Among these thirteen stellar episodes is the hilarious two-parter, `The Scotsman Saves Jack,' in which we meet a goofy guy in a red jacket by the name of Brent Worthington, who just happens to look exactly like Jack.  In episode XLII, Jack encounters a hip-hoppin', jive-talkin' ""Sam-u-rai,"" and teaches him that, ""You can never defeat another if you know not how to defeat yourself.""In XLI, Jack traverses the devastated streets of Andromeda and is attacked by the awesome Mondo-bot.  The frightened robotic Andromedan citizens lead the wandering samurai warrior to a Gundam-like mobile suit and Jack attacks the Mondo-bot Voltron style.Episode XLIII begins with yet another battle with the fiendish Aku.  But this time, Aku calls the fight off early because he's afflicted with a nasty cold virus.  Unfortunately, before leaving, the shape-shifting villain coughs up a piece of himself...a piece which Jack accidentally swallows!  Our hero is slowly but surely possessed by the evil black spirit of all-enshrouding Akuness, and so he must travel to the watery temple of the lizard-monks for help.XLVII is an obvious homage to 'Star Wars,' featuring the butterfly-like Prince Astor and Princess Verbina of Alepidopterans.  The insectoid siblings (along with their golden assistant, Chitron 6) are relentlessly pursued by Squoomian gunships as they leave their home on Chrysalis to search for their royal navy.  They crash-land in Samurai Jack's world and are quickly captured by Aku's demonic minions.Episode L introduces an emotional robot hit man in a black trench coat and wingtip shoes who's pining for his little lost dog, Lulu, a.k.a. ""sweet thing.""  The merciless Aku is holding Lulu hostage in order to coax her mechanized owner out of retirement.  Aku wants Samurai Jack terminated, and the twin pistol-wielding dog-lover is more than willing to do the job...as soon as the rain stops.So, at long last, all of Jack's adventures are available on DVD.  But, it is a bit disappointing to learn that, like `Lost in Space,' this spectacular series does not have a satisfactory finale.  Genndy Tartakovsky says there might be a Samurai Jack movie someday.  Let's hope that day comes very soon.  In the meantime, the screaming baby episode will have to do.",5,"""He who runs with aggression walks without dignity.""",1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2847,"['Unpredictable', 'Illogical', 'Impossible', 'ONE', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'defender', 'truth', 'freedom', 'talking', 'dogs', 'back', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'futuristic', 'hacking', 'slashing', 'Set', '4', 'two', 'discs', 'come', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', 'tastefully', 'decorated', 'gold', 'honeycomb', 'pattern', 'Aku', 'hideous', 'likeness', 'prominently', 'featured', 'front', 'fold-out', 'disc-holder', 'upside-down', 'backwards', 'mine', 'was', '2', 'nice', 'selection', 'extras', 'promos', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'very', 'interesting', 'visit', 'show', 'creators', 'entitled', 'Genndy', 'Roundtable', 'thirteen', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'hilarious', 'two-parter', 'Scotsman', 'Saves', 'Jack', 'meet', 'goofy', 'guy', 'red', 'jacket', 'name', 'Brent', 'Worthington', 'who', 'just', 'look', 'exactly', 'Jack', 'episode', 'XLII', 'Jack', 'hip-hoppin', 'jive-talkin', 'Sam-u-rai', 'can', 'never', 'defeat', 'know', 'not', 'how', 'defeat', 'XLI', 'Jack', 'devastated', 'streets', 'Andromeda', 'attacked', 'awesome', 'Mondo-bot', 'frightened', 'robotic', 'Andromedan', 'citizens', 'lead', 'wandering', 'samurai', 'warrior', 'Gundam-like', 'mobile', 'suit', 'Jack', 'Mondo-bot', 'Voltron', 'style.Episode', 'XLIII', 'yet', 'battle', 'fiendish', 'Aku', 'time', 'Aku', 'fight', 'off', 'early', 'afflicted', 'nasty', 'cold', 'virus', 'Unfortunately', 'leaving', 'shape-shifting', 'villain', 'up', 'piece', 'piece', 'Jack', 'accidentally', 'hero', 'slowly', 'surely', 'possessed', 'evil', 'black', 'spirit', 'all-enshrouding', 'Akuness', 'so', 'must', 'travel', 'watery', 'temple', 'lizard-monks', 'help.XLVII', 'obvious', 'homage', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'featuring', 'butterfly-like', 'Prince', 'Astor', 'Princess', 'Verbina', 'Alepidopterans', 'insectoid', 'siblings', 'golden', 'assistant', 'Chitron', '6', 'are', 'relentlessly', 'pursued', 'Squoomian', 'gunships', 'leave', 'home', 'Chrysalis', 'search', 'royal', 'navy', 'crash-land', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'world', 'are', 'quickly', 'captured', 'Aku', 'demonic', 'minions.Episode', 'L', 'emotional', 'robot', 'hit', 'man', 'black', 'trench', 'coat', 'wingtip', 'shoes', 'who', 'pining', 'little', 'lost', 'dog', 'Lulu', 'a.k.a', 'sweet', 'thing', 'merciless', 'Aku', 'holding', 'Lulu', 'hostage', 'order', 'coax', 'mechanized', 'owner', 'retirement', 'Aku', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'terminated', 'twin', 'pistol-wielding', 'dog-lover', 'more', 'willing', 'do', 'job', 'as', 'soon', 'rain', 'stops.So', 'long', 'last', 'Jack', 'adventures', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'learn', 'Lost', 'Space', 'spectacular', 'series', 'not', 'have', 'satisfactory', 'finale', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'might', 'be', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'movie', 'someday', 'Let', 'hope', 'day', 'very', 'soon', 'meantime', 'screaming', 'baby', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'do']",Samurai Jack: Season 4

I will admit that I am a big kid and love animation, but I am also picky and don't have time to waste on sub-par series.  Samurai Jack is certainly a cut above most.  From its offbeat theme song and stylized animation, you know you are getting something special -- and that isn't even taking into account the premise of the shows!  My son even wanted to be called Jack for a several months, and has been inspired to learn the art of the samurai sword in his Tae Kwon Do class.  All because of this series.I missed most of Season 4 because of Cartoon Network's constant shifting of the show.  I am not sure why it did not go on for another few seasons as it was always fresh and exciting.  It is one of the few shows that really miss being able to see.  We have the other 3 seasons on DVD and they were well worth the purchase price.  Excellent stories, high flying action, and great characters make Samurai Jack a cartoon for the ages.  I expect the Season 4 DVD will continue to live up to those high standards.EDIT:  Got the DVDs and have been watching them with my kids.  Yep, it was worth the wait.

1074901,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000QCU534,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","Samurai Jack comes to a close, which is a real shame.  This show should've gotten another season, at the very least.  But they saved some of the best stories for last.40.  Samurai vs. Ninja:  Aku sends a ninja to destroy Jack.  This is a great episode through & through, but last fight sequence is so spectacular that it would've been worth watching just for that.  A+41.  Robo- Samurai vs. Mondo-Bot:  Jack helps protect a city inhabited by robots by piloting a robo-samurai to battle the threatening Mondo-Bot.  I love Japanese giant robot anime (Voltron, Robotech, macron 1 & more) so naturally I love this homage.  A+42.  Samurai vs. Samurai:  A cool samurai punk wants to battle with Jack in order to prove that he is the best.  A very funny episode.  A43.  The Aku Infection:  Aku sneezes on Jack, & Jack slowly becomes infected with Aku's evil.  The scariest episode of the whole series.  A+44.  The Princess and the Bounty Hunters:  When Aku raises the bounty on Jack, the best bounty hunters in the world gather to capture him.  Despite the fact that Jack is barely in this episode and doesn't say anything, this is still an awesome episode.  A+45-46.  The Scotsman Saves Jack:  Jack has lost all memory of who he is, and it's up to the Scotsman to put the pieces of the puzzle together by sailing straight into the perils of the Great Unknown.  I just realized one of the shortcomings of season 3: no Scotsman!  They make up for that though, with a double dose that's just as good as the previous ones with him.  A+47.  Jack and the Flying Prince and Princess:  Jack helps save a prince and princess whose ship has been shot down to Earth.  This is the worst episode of the season.  The Star Wars homages are good, but Jack seems out of character here, not helping the kids when he had a chance.  Still, it had a good opening & a good ending, so I shouldn't be too hard on it.  C48.  Jack VS Aku:  Tired of all his bounty hunters and robots failing, Aku fights Jack, mano-a-mano.  This sort of plot has been done before, but never as good as this.  A49.  Seasons of Death:  As Jack journeys through summer, fall, winter and spring, he must battle the perils each season brings.  This a very unique episode.  A+50.  The Tale of X49:  Aku forces an old, ace robot out of retirement to eliminate the ultimate mark - Jack.  This is my other favorite of the Jack-lite episodes.  A+51.  Young jack In Africa:  Young Jack is brought to Africa for part of his training, but when his tribe is abducted, practice quickly becomes a battle of life and death.  Now THIS is how you do a prequel episode.  Jack's training would have actually made a great season 5.  A+52.  Jack & the Baby:  Jack finds a baby and the two travel together as Jack tries to return the boy to his mother.  This is the second worst episode of the season.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but not what I would've wanted in a final episode.  Still, I won't complain since it could have been much worse (a clip show, for instance).  B+When only 2 episodes are below A, you now it's a great set.  No ending, but hey we'll get that when the movie is made, whenever that is.  Maybe if you go & buy all the seasons the movie will finally see the light of day.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy all of these.

It's the fourth, and sadly last, season of one of the greatest action series that has ever graced the airwaves of Cartoon Network: Samurai Jack.  The series created by Genndy Tartakofsky (Of Clone Wars and Dexter's Lab fame) may have reached its end, but Jack's quest still continues nonetheless.  As long as he has his powerful sword and his vengeance toward Aku, the story will never end.And now, here's my very last top five episodes from season four.  Here goes.5. ""Jack and the Baby"" - Jack discovers a infant boy and takes the child along with him.  Now he must find the baby's mother and fast.4. ""Jack and the Four Seasons of Death"" - Jack faces the dangers of winter, spring, summer, and autumn.  And by dangers I mean the perils that each season spawns.3. ""The Aku Infection"" - An unwell Aku sneezes on Jack and pretty soon, Aku's evil has taken over Jack's body.2. ""The Scotsman Saves Jack"" (parts 1 & 2) - The Scotsman, one of Jack's allies, attempts to rescue Jack who has lost his memory.  After rescuing his friend, the Scotsman and the Samurai challenge each other to see who's the best.1. ""Jack vs. Aku"" - It's the ultimate showdown as Jack and Aku go one-on-one with each other.Honorable mention: ""Robo-Samurai vs. Mondo-Bot"" - Jack has been proclaimed the ""Chosen One"" in a new city.  He then enters the body of the Robo-Samurai and attempts to defeat the evil Mondo-Bot destroying the city.Don't forget to check out a couple of special features which include a commentary with the creators of the show and exclusive promos plus never-before-seen footage.Well, they say that all good things must come to an end.  And a series as good as Samurai Jack might as well end, too.  Jack's adventures still continue in Cartoon Network Action Pack comic books, but those won't compare to the brilliant award-winning series that won the hearts of many viewers.  (And as weird as it seems, there was an episode of ""Duck Dodgers"" that was totally inspired by this series.)Either way, have faith in the Samurai.
