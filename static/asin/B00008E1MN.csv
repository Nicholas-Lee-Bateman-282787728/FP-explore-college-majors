This DVD is the closest to the real PT course that I have found.  The workouts are tough for beginners (my friend was panting 10 min. through) but with practice, you get further and feel stronger.  I love the PT drills, but they kick my butt!Have fun with this one.",4,Tough DVD!!,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,401,"['bought', 'DVD', 'had', 'attended', 'Marine', 'PT', 'training', 'class', 'wanted', 'have', 'workouts', 'cost', 'PT', 'course', 'DVD', 'closest', 'real', 'PT', 'course', 'have', 'found', 'workouts', 'are', 'tough', 'beginners', 'friend', 'was', 'panting', '10', 'min', 'practice', 'get', 'further', 'feel', 'stronger', 'love', 'PT', 'drills', 'kick', 'butt', 'Have', 'fun', 'one']",David Kirsch's Sound Mind Sound Body Ultimate Fitness Boot Camp
740467,A2ZAOT2HEBQOUW,B00008E1MN,Eva H.,"[2, 2]","I like the workout in the DVD, because of several reasons:1. It is a well-thought total body workout:David makes the workout that works the entire body by either combining a cardiovascular effect with a traditional weight movement (e.g. jumping jacks with shoulder presses or extension of arms to sides and upwards), or incorporating total-body movements (e.g. squats thrusts, knee-ins).The DVD has 4 sequences of jumping (they appear separated from each other, throughout the DVD):-Jumping Jacks with shoulder presses-Frog jumps-Power Squats or Squat Jumps-Jumping Jacks with extended arms to the sides and overhead2. It is made for home, even one with no spaceThe most space-requiring movement in the DVD is the squat thrusts - in other words, you don't need more than the length of your own height.I live in an upper floor of an apartment unit and am often worried that the impact of my jumping might annoy my downstair neighbors. I use a yoga mat when I do the workout, and this nicely absorbs the shock of my weight, wiping out my concern for noise.3. The workout is adjustable to different fitness levels/daily energy levels with one's own modificationYes, it's a tough workout, but because it is not technically challenging (we already know and can do lunges, squats etc.), after the initial trial of the DVD, I quickly learned to adjust the exercise to my daily motivation and energy levels. For example, if I felt very energetic, I might do the entire jumping jack sequence with shoulder presses (the standard one in the DVD is first jump the jacks around 10 times, then add the shoulder presses and jump for another 10 or so times, and finally jump few more times without the shoulder presses). On the other hand, on my lower energy days I might do the pushups with my knees on the floor and so on.The DVD incorporates 5 pushup sequences (2 in the beginning, 3 towards the end).4. The workout does not look silly in front of the ""home audience""This may not be a concern for everyone, but I often feel distracted, if I do a dance-oriented workout at home, while the entire family watching. I know that I'm supposed to shake my booty and feel sexy for extra calorie burn...but in front of my grandma...?This DVD is great on a day, when I have home audience because I don't feel ""silly"" doing lunges, side squats or arnold presses!If you like a total body workout that requires little room and helps  to tone your body, this DVD won't disappoint.",5,Effective Total Body Workout that Requires No Space,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2453,"['like', 'workout', 'DVD', 'several', 'reasons:1', 'well-thought', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'David', 'workout', 'entire', 'body', 'combining', 'cardiovascular', 'effect', 'traditional', 'weight', 'movement', 'e.g', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'extension', 'arms', 'sides', 'upwards', 'incorporating', 'total-body', 'movements', 'e.g', 'squats', 'thrusts', 'knee-ins', '.The', 'DVD', '4', 'sequences', 'jumping', 'appear', 'separated', 'other', 'DVD', '-Jumping', 'Jacks', 'shoulder', 'presses-Frog', 'jumps-Power', 'Squats', 'Squat', 'Jumps-Jumping', 'Jacks', 'extended', 'arms', 'sides', 'made', 'home', 'even', 'one', 'spaceThe', 'most', 'space-requiring', 'movement', 'DVD', 'squat', 'thrusts', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'length', 'own', 'height.I', 'live', 'upper', 'floor', 'apartment', 'unit', 'am', 'often', 'worried', 'impact', 'jumping', 'might', 'annoy', 'downstair', 'neighbors', 'use', 'yoga', 'mat', 'when', 'do', 'workout', 'nicely', 'shock', 'weight', 'wiping', 'out', 'concern', 'noise.3', 'workout', 'adjustable', 'different', 'fitness', 'levels/daily', 'energy', 'levels', 'one', 'own', 'modificationYes', 'tough', 'workout', 'not', 'technically', 'challenging', 'already', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'lunges', 'squats', 'etc', 'initial', 'trial', 'DVD', 'quickly', 'learned', 'adjust', 'exercise', 'daily', 'motivation', 'energy', 'levels', 'example', 'felt', 'very', 'energetic', 'might', 'do', 'entire', 'jumping', 'jack', 'sequence', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'standard', 'one', 'DVD', 'first', 'jump', 'jacks', '10', 'times', 'then', 'add', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'jump', '10', 'so', 'times', 'finally', 'jump', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'other', 'hand', 'lower', 'energy', 'days', 'might', 'do', 'pushups', 'knees', 'floor', 'so', 'on.The', 'DVD', '5', 'pushup', 'sequences', '2', 'beginning', '3', 'end', '.4', 'workout', 'not', 'look', 'silly', 'front', 'home', 'audience', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'concern', 'everyone', 'often', 'feel', 'distracted', 'do', 'dance-oriented', 'workout', 'home', 'entire', 'family', 'watching', 'know', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'shake', 'booty', 'feel', 'sexy', 'extra', 'calorie', 'burn', 'front', 'grandma', 'DVD', 'great', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'home', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'silly', 'doing', 'lunges', 'side', 'squats', 'arnold', 'presses', 'like', 'total', 'body', 'little', 'room', 'tone', 'body', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint']",David Kirsch's Sound Mind Sound Body Ultimate Fitness Boot Camp

There is a lot of jumping and strength moves (ie push-ups) that will be very, very challenging to the beginning exerciser.  For the intermediate/advanced - it's great.  Using 5 pounds is probably the maximum amount of weight you can use, without causing any injury.  This workout combines cardio strength moves, isometrics with the basics - squat thrusts, push-ups, crumches...etc.  You do feel energized after doing it!  David is a great motivator and not annoying at all.  In fact he is quite funny: ""Your butt...IT'S STINGING!""  My only complaint is the music.  It sucks.  I wish the music wasn't so wimpy for such an intense workout.  Also he does tend to speed up near the end of each set of exercises, but what can I say...he's pumped up!!

However, he is monotonous, a little dull and he doesn't cue well.  This workout is good, don't get me wrong.

740470,A2W30R08QPWM4M,B00008E1MN,"Minnesota Raven ""Viking Vixen""","[66, 66]","I like David's style in that he is trying to get the viewer to not only work on performing the exercise, he wants to get you to think about visualizing what it is you are trying to achieve.  So he is constantly asking the exerciser to do a mind and body connection.I would have given this video 4 stars had his cueing and pacing been consistent.  I do a lot of home videos and so have seen good and bad.  They perform on the sand on a beach and this may be a factor in how well he paces some of the moves.  For instance he does an exercise where you swing your leg out in front of you in an arc and then do a squat.  Well he does some of them at one speed then another speed and then yet another speed.  It's means you find yourself out of sync with him if you keep a consistent rhythm going.  This happens in at least three of the routines.  The other point is he miscounts.  He will say you have 5 more to go and then end in 3.  Not a big thing but it is just one more thing that might annoy some.I liked the actual exercises they are indeed going to make you feel like you have exercised.  I usually use between 8 to 15 pound weights with most exercise training videos but not with him.  Believe him when he tells you to get light weights.  I use 3 pound weights and towards the end they seem impossibly heavy as he does a lot more shoulder work than most videos.  High repetitions while also working the lower body will definitely make you feel it.",3,"Quick Pace, Needs Better Cueing, Heart Thumper",1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,1452,"['like', 'David', 'style', 'trying', 'get', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'performing', 'exercise', 'get', 'think', 'visualizing', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'constantly', 'asking', 'exerciser', 'do', 'mind', 'body', 'connection.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'video', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'cueing', 'pacing', 'been', 'consistent', 'do', 'lot', 'home', 'videos', 'so', 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'bad', 'perform', 'sand', 'beach', 'may', 'be', 'factor', 'how', 'well', 'moves', 'instance', 'exercise', 'where', 'swing', 'leg', 'out', 'front', 'arc', 'then', 'do', 'squat', 'Well', 'one', 'speed', 'then', 'speed', 'then', 'yet', 'speed', 'means', 'find', 'sync', 'keep', 'consistent', 'rhythm', 'going', 'least', 'three', 'routines', 'other', 'point', 'will', 'say', 'have', '5', 'more', 'go', 'then', 'end', '3', 'Not', 'big', 'thing', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'might', 'annoy', 'some.I', 'liked', 'actual', 'exercises', 'are', 'indeed', 'going', 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'exercised', 'usually', 'use', '8', '15', 'pound', 'weights', 'most', 'exercise', 'training', 'videos', 'not', 'Believe', 'when', 'get', 'light', 'weights', 'use', '3', 'pound', 'weights', 'end', 'seem', 'impossibly', 'heavy', 'lot', 'more', 'shoulder', 'work', 'most', 'videos', 'High', 'repetitions', 'also', 'working', 'lower', 'body', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'feel']",David Kirsch's Sound Mind Sound Body Ultimate Fitness Boot Camp
740471,A33PJLHEXRK880,B00008E1MN,Morgana,"[18, 21]","I bought this DVD because based on other user reviews I felt it might help me push myself beyond my intermediate fitness level.  It definitely has helped to do that because it really gets my heart racing with the drills, and I like the fact that he integrates hand weights into the routine.But there are a couple of reasons why this is not a great fitness DVD and why it deserves only 3 stars.First proper form and technique are not discussed.  Kirsch himself even flails through some of the drills without proper form.  There is one series where you squat down with your hands on the floor, kick your legs back, bring them back in and then stand up with your hands raised above your head that is especially grueling on the knees and wrists. And I have not been known to have bad knees and wrists.Second, either the way the music is laid over the video on the DVD I received is messed up, or Kirsch has no rhythm whatsoever.  I find this annoying and sometimes I just turn the volume off completely.There is also a strange intro by Kirsch at the beginning of the DVD where he talks about mind-body connection and demonstrates exercises with some model woman that always makes me laugh.Overall, I think this is an okay DVD to integrate into your home workout routine as long as you don't use it too often because you'll probably wind up hurting yourself.",3,"Okay, but be careful not to hurt yourself",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1353,"['bought', 'DVD', 'based', 'other', 'user', 'reviews', 'felt', 'might', 'help', 'push', 'intermediate', 'fitness', 'level', 'definitely', 'helped', 'do', 'really', 'heart', 'racing', 'drills', 'like', 'fact', 'hand', 'weights', 'routine.But', 'are', 'couple', 'reasons', 'why', 'not', 'great', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars.First', 'proper', 'form', 'technique', 'are', 'not', 'discussed', 'Kirsch', 'even', 'drills', 'proper', 'form', 'one', 'series', 'where', 'squat', 'down', 'hands', 'floor', 'kick', 'legs', 'back', 'bring', 'back', 'then', 'stand', 'up', 'hands', 'raised', 'head', 'especially', 'grueling', 'knees', 'wrists', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'known', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'wrists.Second', 'way', 'music', 'laid', 'video', 'DVD', 'received', 'messed', 'up', 'Kirsch', 'rhythm', 'whatsoever', 'find', 'annoying', 'sometimes', 'just', 'turn', 'volume', 'completely.There', 'also', 'strange', 'intro', 'Kirsch', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'where', 'mind-body', 'connection', 'exercises', 'model', 'woman', 'always', 'laugh.Overall', 'think', 'okay', 'DVD', 'integrate', 'home', 'workout', 'routine', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'too', 'often', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wind', 'up', 'hurting']",David Kirsch's Sound Mind Sound Body Ultimate Fitness Boot Camp
