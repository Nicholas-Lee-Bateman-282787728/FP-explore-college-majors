My favorite part is when John de Lancie, as an animated pony, sings about the various aspects of brony fandom. My other favorite part is when a young brony explains to his dad that he loves My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, even though his dad remembered and did not like the old show from the 80s. He also tells his dad what the show is about and why he likes it. I would recommend this documentary for anyone who loves My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and want to watch other bronies express their love of the show.",5,AWESOME!,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,606,"['loved', 'documentary', 'showed', 'what', 'brony', 'phenomenon', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'John', 'de', 'Lancie', 'animated', 'pony', 'sings', 'various', 'aspects', 'brony', 'fandom', 'other', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'young', 'brony', 'dad', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Friendship', 'Magic', 'even', 'dad', 'remembered', 'did', 'not', 'old', 'show', '80s', 'also', 'dad', 'what', 'show', 'why', 'would', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'who', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Friendship', 'Magic', 'want', 'watch', 'other', 'bronies', 'express', 'love', 'show']",N/A
167666,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,0988849631,Armando N. Roman,"[7, 9]","I don't even know where to start with this review. I've been trying to figure out what to even say about the documentary for the last 4 months.Ok let me ask you a question. You're a Brony- a male fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. You wear MLP shirts, have Cutie Mark stickers on your car, collect MLP figures and stuffed animals, get together with other guys who like MLP, and other seemingly innocent things. None of this would be seen as weird for any other show/movie/book (Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc.). But with this being an animated show about ponies, with the target audience being young girls, regardless of how well-written it is, you're probably aware that people are probably going to make fun of you for being that into it, right?Before I continue, let me make it clear that I have nothing against the show or the fans. Nor am I a Brony. Ok? Stay with me on this.You're harassed by other people for liking cartoon ponies, and have a hard time even making it known to your family and friends, as if it's some kind of serious medical condition. You want everyone who looks down upon the Bronies to understand that you're just a big fan, and that this isn't any different from people who get painted up and go to big sport events, cosplay and go to conventions, or go to a midnight screening of a big movie in costume. So someone starts up a Kickstarter to film a documentary on Bronies and Bronycon, earning well over 300k dollars. That's A LOT of money. You donate some of your own money, and the end result is something that doesn't follow its own title, doesn't exactly use the best examples of its fans to explain anything, AND it essentially comes off as an advertisement for Bronycon more than anything else. Wouldn't you be a little irked? Wouldn't you want to see a receipt or something to see where exactly all that money went?Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony starts out well enough, opening with dozens of guys talking about what they like about the show, then it cuts to news media footage of people talking about how weird it is for grown men to like it. One news caster even mentions that he's never seen a single episode, yet here he is bashing the show and its fans. Nice huh? That about does it for adult men explaining why they like the show, as we're then introduced to a couple of guys (ranging from young to late teens) who talk about their personal problems, and eventually how they [for lack of better term] came out to their family and friends as fans of the show. Based on how these kids act, you'd think that they were living in the age of the Salem Witch Trials, and saying anything MLP-related would get them stoned to death. The youngest of the three is trying to convince his parents that everything's normal, and he wants his dad, who really doesn't approve of his son liking ponies, to attend Bronycon with him. One of the others is a socially awkward teen with Asperger's, and is heading out to another Bronycon, by himself, as well. The oldest of these three lives in a southern-type state, and seems to have the biggest problems of all. His car was smashed up by a group of other kids who didn't exactly like how the car was decorated. If you have tons of Cutie Marks (including butterflies as one of them) on one window, and a giant Princess Luna and Princess Celestia on the back window, and you're a boy in a state like that, aren't you pretty much asking for trouble? You may as well stroll through Detroit at night wearing a Confederate belt buckle and a shirt that reads ""Cowboy Up"".Once Bronycon comes up, that's the majority of the documentary, and the film loses focus, becoming an advertisement for the convention, and gushing with praise for Lauren Faust, as well as lots of footage of Tara Strong talking about Bronies. I'm all for getting to see more of Tara Strong, whatever the reason may be, but to be fair, she isn't needed here. This is supposed to be about Bronies- you could have cut out Tara's segments and replaced them with someone who is more of a Twilight Sparkle, rather than a Pinkie Pie, talking about their hobby. What bugged me the most though, was that the film makes everyone out to be the victim, as if there really isn't anything wrong with the fandom. Come on. You can see it in some of the Bronies' eyes when they're explaining/defending themselves about why they like the show, always mentioning the same things (the animation, the art, the writing). Do one image search for My Little Pony with the adult filter off and tell me how many innocent images show up. There is quite a large number of fans out there who really take this love for MLP to another level, and -they- are the ones who aren't making the fan base look any better in the public's eyes. It also doesn't help when they can't even have one guy who isn't a super diehard fan who happens to be a Brony to follow around for a while. Look at how many geeky Star Wars fans there are out there who don't breathe/eat/live Star Wars- they can be normal people too. You wouldn't think that about Bronies when watching this documentary. Everyone comes off as eccentric with no hobbies outside of the show, aside from one guy who is a DJ that performs at Bronycon.I have nothing against anyone who is a big fan of something. There's nothing wrong with having a hobby or being really into something. But good lord, the people presented in this documentary aren't doing their sub-culture much help by being how they are on film. A good documentary isn't one-sided. This one is completely one-sided. Had they spent half as much time at Bronycon, and more time with individuals not coming off as complete Derpys, it could have been better, and even gotten a good point across.Instead of giving it 1 star, I'm giving it 2 because it did have some good parts, though they may be unintentionally good. The parts with the dad attending Bronycon had my laughing out loud. As soon as he gets there and sees the Bronies in their natural habitat, his face changes and you can tell that he's done with life right then and there. And as I said earlier, getting to see Tara Strong looking fine as usual is always nice, even if she's not here for any good reason other than to have a star of the show try and make things appear better than they are. I also got a kick out of the woman who created Bronycon, looking absolutely miserable most of the time, even at the convention, in the front row when Lauren Faust was present. There's also an embarrassingly hilarious segment featuring a doctor talking about how Bronies have higher intelligence than some non-Bronies. I'll let you figure out if that was included to defend them or as a desperate effort to get another positive note, again, ignoring anything negative about the culture.The only people who can give this documentary 5 stars are people who are blind and can't see that there's nothing that isn't fluff here. This documentary is a waste of three hundred thousand Benjamins, as well as a missed opportunity for the Bronies who were hoping for something to show that they aren't all bad. Where DID all that money go? Maybe I should get a Kickstarter going to make an audio book of The Bible read by Gilbert Gottfried.And if you haven't seen it, check out the Brony episode of Bob's Burgers.

167667,A2S0PELQX7R57K,0988849631,"Chris Stoner ""Bibliophile""","[1, 1]","I have taught gender studies classes for the last few years, and I was fascinated when I heard about the Brony fan community.  This documentary does a good job of providing a beginner's introduction to this fandom.  There has been some criticism of this documentary, primarily that it doesn't focus much attention at all at the female adult fans of MY LITTLE PONY (some consider themselves Bronies as well, though some prefer the term Pegasister) and that it doesn't include any criticism of the fandom.  I sympathize with the first complaint as there are times where the documentary almost makes it seem as if only adult men are fans of the show, but I think this stems from the fact that men's enjoyment of the show is much more at odds with our traditional gender expectations.  As for a lack of a negative perspective, I don't think that fandoms like this necessarily need to have a negative perspective shown as so much about fandom by nature is subjective; the negative perspective would just be people who don't share the enjoyment of that particular cultural object.  Viewers of the documentary can watch the source material themselves and determine how they feel about it.This movie is fun and presents an interesting cross-section of people from within this fan community and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys light-hearted documentaries about pop culture.",5,Fascinated By Bronies,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1368,"['have', 'taught', 'gender', 'studies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'fascinated', 'when', 'heard', 'Brony', 'fan', 'community', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'beginner', 'introduction', 'fandom', 'been', 'criticism', 'documentary', 'primarily', ""n't"", 'focus', 'much', 'attention', 'female', 'adult', 'fans', 'MY', 'LITTLE', 'PONY', 'consider', 'Bronies', 'as', 'well', 'prefer', 'term', 'Pegasister', ""n't"", 'include', 'criticism', 'fandom', 'sympathize', 'first', 'complaint', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'documentary', 'almost', 'seem', 'only', 'adult', 'men', 'are', 'fans', 'show', 'think', 'fact', 'men', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'odds', 'traditional', 'gender', 'expectations', 'lack', 'negative', 'perspective', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fandoms', 'necessarily', 'need', 'have', 'negative', 'perspective', 'shown', 'so', 'much', 'fandom', 'nature', 'subjective', 'negative', 'perspective', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'enjoyment', 'particular', 'cultural', 'object', 'Viewers', 'documentary', 'can', 'watch', 'source', 'material', 'determine', 'how', 'feel', 'it.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'interesting', 'cross-section', 'people', 'fan', 'community', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'light-hearted', 'documentaries', 'pop', 'culture']",N/A

Then the three of us watched it together.What we saw were portraits of several young men (and one woman) who are Bronies, none of whom fit the negative stereotypes, as they make their way to and attend Brony conventions.(I have to add that we have an extremely liberal household. ""Gay"" is not a bad word here. But stereotyping all Bronies as ""gay or pedophiles"" is obviously inaccurate and downright mean. A little education was in order.)This documentary was insightful and engaging; we were all three glued to it for its duration. It covered a fair amount of ground, showing Bronies internationally. The producers clearly sought out some of the biggest names in Brony fandom. I especially liked the gathering of rough tough military men who self-identify as Bronies; talk about dispelling the myths!Obviously, this documentary was limited in scope and could not be all things to all people; several of the other reviews hit on this. But it was created to dispel myths about Bronies, and this it did beautifully. I would have liked to have seem more of an emphasis on female Bronies, but since they are in the minority and time was limited, I can let that go. Besides, the film did a great job of covering vast ground by bringing on Q/Discord in the form of a teacher pony who rapidly filled in the blanks.This documentary is both well worth the money and well worth watching.

This little documentary was much more interesting than I expected. I actually watched it twice in one week.2. It&#8217;s about how the show &#8220;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&#8221; was created to use the classic My Little Pony characters as archetypes for various positive character traits, and challenge female stereotypes. It was aimed at little girls.3. What nobody expected is that guys got obsessed with the show, too, and began to call themselves &#8220;bronies&#8221; - which is a combination of &#8220;bro&#8221; and &#8220;pony&#8221;. Their favorite form of greeting is the fist bump - which they call the &#34;bro hoof&#34;.4. The movie follows several different bronies from all over the world, and how they found each other. It also goes into the difficulties they face for being open about how much they like a&#8220;girlie show&#8221;. It also shows their journeys to various &#8220;BronyCons&#8221;, which are huge conventions of bronies.5. People that are uncomfortable with bronies suspect that they are either gay, or the opposite - they like little girls too much. This movie does a good job of dispelling those myths. One of the more interesting scenes is a gathering of bronies in the military.6. What&#8217;s fascinating is how this show has obviously hit a real nerve among men - this is not an isolated phenomenon. We see people from redneck small towns, couples in Germany, a DJ in Israel, and a British kid with Asperger's Syndrome. This is not an isolated fetish.7. Some bronies feel this documentary is too one-sided, by making bronies all look socially awkward and prone to discrimination. It also tends to ignore grown women that like the show (they call themselves &#8220;pegasisters&#8221;)8. Other bronies are upset that the movie doesn&#8217;t talk about clopping - which is the porn part of My Little Pony fandom.9. I&#8217;m not a brony, but I support them. This movie makes the point that men can be sensitive and inclusive and loving. In a world where violence among men is &#8220;normal&#8221;, but friendship and love is &#8220;deviant&#8221;, the movie shows that the problem is with the brony-haters, not the bronies.",5,Surprisingly informative and entertaining,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2276,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Bronies', 'Extremely', 'Unexpected', 'Adult', 'Fans', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', '8221', '1', 'little', 'documentary', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'expected', 'actually', 'watched', 'twice', 'one', 'week.2', '8217', 's', 'how', 'show', '8220', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Friendship', 'Magic', '8221', 'was', 'created', 'use', 'classic', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'characters', 'archetypes', 'various', 'positive', 'character', 'traits', 'challenge', 'female', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'aimed', 'little', 'girls.3', 'What', 'nobody', 'expected', 'guys', 'got', 'obsessed', 'show', 'too', 'began', 'call', '8220', 'bronies', '8221', 'combination', '8220', '8221', '8220', 'pony', '8221', 'favorite', 'form', 'greeting', 'fist', 'bump', 'call', '34', 'bro', 'hoof', '34', '.4', 'movie', 'several', 'different', 'bronies', 'world', 'how', 'found', 'other', 'also', 'difficulties', 'face', 'being', 'open', 'how', 'much', '8220', 'girlie', 'show', '8221', 'also', 'journeys', 'various', '8220', 'BronyCons', '8221', 'are', 'huge', 'conventions', 'bronies.5', 'People', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'bronies', 'suspect', 'are', 'gay', 'opposite', 'like', 'little', 'girls', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'dispelling', 'myths', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'gathering', 'bronies', 'military.6', 'What', '8217', 'fascinating', 'how', 'show', 'obviously', 'hit', 'real', 'nerve', 'men', 'not', 'isolated', 'phenomenon', 'see', 'people', 'redneck', 'small', 'towns', 'couples', 'Germany', 'DJ', 'Israel', 'British', 'kid', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'not', 'isolated', 'fetish.7', 'bronies', 'feel', 'documentary', 'too', 'one-sided', 'making', 'bronies', 'look', 'socially', 'awkward', 'prone', 'discrimination', 'also', 'ignore', 'grown', 'women', 'show', 'call', '8220', 'pegasisters', '8221', '8', 'Other', 'bronies', 'are', 'upset', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'talk', 'clopping', 'porn', 'part', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'fandom.9', '8217', 'm', 'not', 'brony', 'support', 'movie', 'point', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'sensitive', 'inclusive', 'loving', 'world', 'where', 'violence', 'men', '8220', 'normal', '8221', 'friendship', 'love', '8220', 'deviant', '8221', 'movie', 'problem', 'brony-haters', 'not', 'bronies']",N/A

I actually have a friend that is part of the &#34;Brony&#34; phenomenon who while is a strange person, is nevertheless a nice guy.  But lets be honest, the majority of the My Little Pony fan base is strange and creepy. This documentary which is made is obviously made by hardcore fans of the show is here to debunk that claim and fails so in every possible way.Why does this film fail so bad? It's because it tries so hard to paint the culture in a positive light, that you can tell they know how weird and ridiculous their own culture is and they don't want to admit it, so they go to extraordinary lengths to paint it in a positive light. In doing so the documentary uses constant emotional manipulation in order to get the viewer to feel bad for the Brony fans. Trying to get a viewer to feel bad for a fan by making a point of them having aspergers was more offensive than it was in trying to help the fan prove it's point. The other cases feel more staged than anything such as rednecks threatening boys who have a pony sticker on their truck and a father disapproving of his sons fandom until he goes to the Brony Convention. By the end of the film they even start throwing absolutely ridiculous claims out of the blue without any evidence. The most shocking is they have a so-called &#34;doctor&#34; claim that research shows that Brony fans have extremely high IQ's without any evidence. Give me a break! And if for some strange reason that doesn't convince you this is propaganda, the documentary doesn't ONCE show or even mention any the extreme and dark side of the fanbase such as the cloppers!  It really infuriated me not just as poor film making, but also as a lame and untruthful propaganda attempt to get us to feel sorry and side with this wacky fanbase.This documentary did the exact opposite of what it was intended to do and made me have even less respect for this crazy culture.
