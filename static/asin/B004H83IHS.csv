The breadth of the subject matter is an amazement as is  Bennett's wit, humor and scholarship. This is the definition of entertainment. I am so happy that decision was made to issue these DVDs. There are several other Alan Bennett programmes including THE ABBEY WITH ALAN BENNETT that I would love to have on DVD. My VHS copy of THE ABBEY is almost worn through from my constantly showing it to friends in my home. And where are: THE OLD CROWD, ONE FINE DAY, ME!

1408137,A3RSFJIFMFSMZ0,B004H83IHS,Malcolm Baird,"[2, 2]","Alan Bennett is one of the UK's greatest playwrights and it seems odd that he has not received any sort of royal honour such as an OBE or even a knighthood.  Maybe he has followed the example of his fellow Yorkshireman J.B.Priestley by turning down honours with the sole exception of the O.M.This selection is very much a mixed bag and I would not recommend sitting through it all at once.  But each part has its special  value.""A woman of no importance"", played brilliantly by Patricia Routledge,  starts in comic vein and ends in stark tragedy.For cold war afficionados we have ""An Englishman Abroad"".  The final scene is a gem, with Guy Burgess (played by Alan Bates) strutting flamboyantly through a Moscow snowstorm in his newly-arrived English clothes, to the patriotic strains of Gilbert and Sullivan's song ""...for he is an English Man"".Last but not least, reality fans will enjoy the fly-on-the wall documentary from the Crown Hotel in Harrogate.  Brilliant editing and a thoughtful commentary by Bennett.  It goes to show the truth of the old Yorkshire saying, ""there's nowt so queer as folks.""
