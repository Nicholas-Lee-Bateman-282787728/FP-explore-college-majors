I get to live out the dream of being the first to review a popular product AND give a rave to the third season of one of my favorite shows on TV. I have to say: I have given a pass to nearly every network series of the past ten years, preferring the more complex and adult dramas and comedies found on cable-TV. But THE GOOD WIFE fulfills all of my requirements for great entertainment: gripping plotlines, complex characters and brilliant acting, writing and directing. Julianna Margulies anchors the show beautifully as Alicia Florrick, and Season 3 gives her great new material to play, particularly at the start of the season with her boss, Will Gardner (Josh Charles). How their affair plays out - and draws in her ex-husband Peter (Chris Noth) and her OTHER boss, Diane Lockhart (the always amazing Christine Baranski) makes for great drama that never descends to soapiness. Alan Cumming expands his role as Eli Gold, now practicing law in Alicia's office even as he juggles his career as a political consultant, and he provides many of the comic highlights throughout the season. Matt Czuchry deepens his portrayal of Cary Agos, having switched sides from defense to the D.A.'s office. And of course, there's my (and probably most other viewers') favorite character, Kalinda Sharma (Archie Punjabi) whose friendship with Alicia went up in smoke at the end of Season Two. The fallout of this event, as well as the other troubles she encounters, make Kalinda appear more vulnerable than ever before. By season's end, several intriguing questions about her character are answered, even as new mysteries surrounding her past begin. Chris Noth and Mary Beth Peil round out the exceptional cast of characters, with Jackie's antagonism Alicia providing some stellar moments. Great talent, great court cases, great season ending cliffhanger. I, for one, am eagerly looking forward to Season Four.

Lisa Edelstein, the actress, plays an attorney who is a thousand times more annoying than Cuddy, the hospital administrator and doctor from HOUSE.  And, of all things, she is a former love interest of Will Gardener's!Other than that, the show is great though.  Alicia has a murder case this time out.  There is a lot of tension in the firm over just about everything.  Eli is insisting on getting more and more assistance and since he is paying the firm big, he is a hard guy to deny. Diane thinks the firm needs to bring in a bankruptcy division because of the economy.  It is the one specialty that does extremely well in bad times.Although the rift between the two women still hasn't been smoothed, I personally think we are getting set up for a much bigger rift to open up between Alicia and the firm through her current involvement with Will. And when that explodes, she also must still contend with her vendetta seeking husband and his new henchman, Carey.

CBS has used this show as a political ploy to get low information voters to vote on the left. If anyone thinks the political climate in Chicago is anything less and corrupt they are just blind. The real reality is that Chicago is rife with corruption and is not as flowery and sweet as this show would have anyone to believe. Its just gotten out of hand and I'm sorry it sickens me.

Believable roles played by actors with the talent to fit.  Excellent casting.  I can't emphasize enough.There are several plots and subplots. What I like most is the satisfactory resolution of each story line in each episode;compounded by back stories on each of the characters which is ongoing and continues to develop.No character leads a perfect life. Although completely believable, are not like anyone I would know personally. Sometimes I am amused or disgusted by their foibles and other times, I sympathize. In short, there are plenty of twists and turns to contemplate, lots of complexity in the plots.I am a little curious about &#34;Will Gardner&#34;....he looks tired, with dark circles around his eyes. Is this intended to show him in ill health? Is that makeup or are we experiencing foreshadowing?I'm not so sure I would ever vote for Mr. Frollic....he needs to be made more loveable, so far is is half Rat.Eli Gold...love him...his body language fits the complexity of his role...his x-wife, however, doesn't fit. Great casting here.Calinda...interesting role...not so sure her &#34;secrets&#34; are that important in this age.  The actress does a good job playing that part, however. Her wardrobe is completely unprofessional for a law office. But I suppose she does most of her work in the street.She needs to have some changes of wardrobe to fit in with the variety of places she must go to investigate. An undercover agent would probably do that.The good wife...her role, so far, hasn't been about being a wife, thank goodness. Running around in high heels all the time isn't to realistic...she needs to dress in tennis shoes then change to heels, much more believable in the big city.Cary...so cute, he deserves more complexity, perhaps it will develop in his role over time.Lockhart...powerful role, done really well. She may be headed for a nervous breakdown??Who is my favorite character?  Calinda, I think. Always wondering what the firm will give her to investigate...much more important than her private life.Maddy...another political Rat.The Mothers-in-Law....well, can't you just strangle them. No advice here. Their roles so far just irritate and provide pause before the main plots.  Perhaps they &#34;need a lawyer&#34; now and then as their high jinks could be made amazing.Although the characters look professional in clothing, etc. as indicative of a professional law firm, there is no overblown fluff about designer clothing, labels or false glamour. It's all about the plot(s).  Thank you, some aspects like costume design need to be in background....by the way, the costume designer is doing a great job.Some nights I watch 2 or 3 episodes on Amazon Prime and am never bored.

1439463,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B0053O89YM,Kate McMurry,"[34, 38]","I am delighted to report that Season 3 of my favorite network-TV drama is as consistently top notch across every episode asSeason 1andSeason 2.As Season 3 opens, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) has emerged with greatly increased confidence in herself, both as a woman and as an attorney at Lockhart/Gardner, after the intense personal and professional struggles she endured during Season 2. She has left her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) after finding out he had a one-night stand years ago with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjaba), the firm's mysterious private investigator. In spite of the fact that Kalinda did not know Alicia then, this explosive revelation makes it impossible for Alicia to be anywhere near Kalinda without feeling an overwhelming urge to scream at her friend or burst into tears--which is a real problem since they have to work together on cases at Lockhart/Gardner.Kalinda, who normally is a really tough nut, is shown at the end of Season 2 visibly heartbroken over losing her friendship with Alicia, which was clearly one of the closest relationships she'd ever had. On the heels of what Alicia sees as a double betrayal, she has kicked Peter out of their apartment and dumped him and his possessions into an apartment she obtained for him without his prior knowledge. As apparent retaliation, Peter, who has just been re-elected to his old office as State's Attorney, strictly because of Alicia's high-profile loyalty and support during his campaign, has hired Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) to be his second-in-command. Cary has been Alicia's enemy since Season 1 when she beat him out for an associate position at Lockhart/Gardner.Alicia has begun talks with Lockhart/Gardner's barracuda divorce attorney, David Lee (the immensely talented Zach Grenier), and launched a torrid affair with Will Gardner (Josh Charles). For multiple reasons, Alicia and Will opt to keep their affair top secret: he is her boss, she is still legally married to Peter, and she doesn't want her kids to know about the affair.This show does a fantastic job this entire season, as it did the previous two seasons, delivering interesting cases for Lockhart/Gardner to represent. The series's excellent writers (led by award-winning, writer/producer, husband-and-wife team, Michelle and Robert King) keep these cases enthralling to viewers by offering spicy--and sometimes humorous--conflicts for the lawyers, such as client chicanery to be worked around, in-house rivalries threatening to torpedo the success of a given case, or mysteries for the ruthlessly capable Kalinda to solve in order to prove a client's innocence or win a case. In addition, whatever the overarching legal plot, it always deftly intertwines with several personal-relationship subplots every week. All of the main characters are linked to each other and numerous other subcharacters in an ever expanding web of secrets, lies and conniving. This could easily become confusing rather than pleasantly intriguing in less skillful hands than those of the show's writing team, but they never drop any plot threads, and never allow the show to slide into outright soapiness, a failing that seems to afflict the vast majority of nighttime drama.The acting continues to be terrific. I concur 100% with the Emmy wins of Julianna Margulies for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Archie Panjabi for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and the nominations of Josh Charles as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and Christine Baranski, as Diane Lockhart, for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.Though Matt Czuchry has not yet been nominated for an Emmy for this show, he contributes greatly to its success by his capable handling of his recurring role as ambitious attorney, Cary Agos. I quite enjoyed the growth arc of his relationship with Alicia this season. Czuchry's outstanding ability to portray Cary's intense emotions through subtle facial expressions--in keeping with the poker face that men in general employ, and lawyers especially are forced to cultivate--never fails to entertain.Mary Beth Peil as Jackie Florrick continues her excellent work as the ambitious mother of Alicia's husband, Peter, and Peter also gets a lot of stage time this season as he contemplates a run for the governor's office. This goal is made all the more fascinating because it is impossible to achieve without the cooperation of both Alicia and cagey political operative, Eli Gold.Eli is one of my favorites on a show overflowing with talented actors playing plum parts. Alan Cumming's portrayal of Eli is filled with delightful contradiction. Just when Eli's ruthlessness is about to push him over the edge into the territory of unsympathetic, irredeemable jerk, out peeks a soft-heartedness that is often quite funny to behold. After Season 1, Cumming received an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Apparently because his work was so exceptional that year, he was promoted to a recurring role, and for Season 2, he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.I could go on and on about the caliber of the many actors with recurring guest roles, but two in particular deserve special attention: Michael J. Fox received his 12th Emmy nomination for his portrayal of attorney Louis Canning, who cynically attempts to gin up sympathy from judges and juries for his Parkinson-type symptoms in order to win his cases. Martha Plimpton (Emmy winner as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series forRaising Hope) plays cutthroat attorney Patti Nyholm who, like Louis Canning, uses a physical health condition--in her case pregnancy and later the baby that resulted from that pregnancy--to deceive and manipulate her opponents.If you haven't been watching this show every week, or even if you have, this DVD is a worthwhile investment in some of the best TV drama of this season or any other.",5,Another great season--this show is consistently terrific!,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,5934,"['am', 'delighted',

1439468,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0053O89YM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There seems to be a tendency to think that ANY TV show that we watch and like should automatically warrant a five star review rating. I have never felt that to be so and would accordingly rank the various shows I watch on a regular basis from 3-5 stars (most falling into the 4 star designation). I say this in preface to my comments about the third season of CBS's ratings challenged but critically acclaimed drama ""The Good Wife"" because it is a show that has improved substantially since its debut.  Almost instantly, critics lauded the Julianna Margulies vehicle for its timely presentation of a political wife scorned.  As Margulies set about restructuring her world, the first season was a mix of politics, family, workplace, and courtroom drama.  Margulies masterfully juggled the intracacies of the varying plot threads, but not all things were created equal.  In my opinion, the element that really made the show stand out was Margulies relationship with her husband, Chris Noth, and other aspects of the show were certainly less compelling.  The program, however, has become one of the richer and more rewarding endeavors on TV over the next two years.  (For my taste, I'd rank Season One at 3 1/2 stars, Season Two at 4 1/2 stars, and Season Three at 5 stars).The twenty-two episode Season Three is easily one of the smartest and most surprising entries on the network TV landscape.  While Margulies is still front and center, ""The Good Wife"" has skillfully developed the most talented and reliable supporting cast of any show on contemporary television.  While this sounds like hyperbole (and I hate hyperbole), I honestly think that it is true.  Margulies starts the season contemplating a new relationship with Will (Josh Charles) but the promise of this love affair may be more enticing than its payoff.  Charles has his biggest year yet as his entire career is put on the line.  Christine Baranski shows more depth and grit as the woman struggling to keep the firm together.  Archie Panjabi, as an enigmatic investigator, unravels more secrets to what makes her TV's most fascinating supporting player.  Noth still has a strong presence, as does Matt Czuchry, in the prosecutor's office as sometimes foes and sometimes allies.  Alan Cumming has an increased presence as well taking an office within the central firm.Anyone of these personalities can step up to take an episode lead without the show faltering, that is how well integrated they are now.  But in addition to the irresistible core cast, ""The Good Wife"" has a literal revolving door of other lawyers and judges that are handled by a stellar group of actors.  Michael J. Fox continues an invaluable recurring role (and I always appreciate the reappearance of the creepy Dylan Walsh and the hysterically off-putting Martha Plimpton), but it seems that everyone that steps in for a day or two is at the top of their game with interesting quirks and relatable foibles.  I credit the show's writing for developing every character with precision.  The cases continue to be as good as always, but what really elevates Season Three are the continuing story threads.  Some HUGE changes, ENORMOUS power struggles, and REVELATORY surprises occur this year.  And as the dramatic imperative keeps upping the stakes, ""The Good Wife"" also remains (slyly) one of the funniest dramas on TV.  It's a terrific balancing act.Margulies' kids remain the weak spot of the show.  As every other aspect of the program has gotten so good, they continue to stand out.

First off, Millennials should be offended by how they're being portrayed on this show. It seems that all the new characters are 20- or 30-something, and they're all 1) preposterously gorgeous with perfect bodies; 2) glib, jaded, snarky and humorless (especially if they work for the State Attorney's Office).They also treat sex like something you do when you're bored. Where's the heart in these characters? And if Cary Agos doesn't wipe that squinting-eyed smirk off his face I'm going to slap him with a lawsuit for intentional inflection of emotional distress.Also: Why is the whole world against Alicia Florrick? Currently:  Her ex mother-in-law is snooping through her apartment, trying to get the goods on her; her former colleague (via her ex-husband) is trying to find a way to bring down her entire law firm in general and her boss-boyfriend in particular; and a new, young, blonde associate (didn't she used to date Don Draper?) is leaving drool-spots all over Lockhart Gardner's expensive Berber carpets as she schemes to swipe Will away from Alicia before the next commercial break. Not only that, but Diane Lockhart is staring at her creepily through the glass walls because she suspects that Alicia and Will are violating the firm's sexual harassment policy. And oh yes, her best friend slept with her husband. And her kids are giving her the Third Degree about how she spends her time when they're at their dad's, as if she's not allowed to date. I'm starting to worry for Our Heroine. Can't the writers bring in Lisa Kudrow to play Alicia Florrick's therapist? I really think she needs one at this point.Trying as all this is on my nervous system, there's still much gold to be mined this season: seeing big stars in small roles (not quite cameos, but almost) has always been part of TGW's fun, and so far we've had Harvey Fierstein, Parker Posey and Bob freaking Balaban!

But they are actually about five years older than their characters, so how much longer can it go on, realistically?The British former consultant to ..... Has been written poorly this time, I thought. First, how did he get to have such a large part in the law firm, so large he is contemplating a take-over? Very little he does is realistic; especially sex. There is no chemistry between him and the very unattractive woman who hovers about him, and professes her lust. Then he reciprocates, but it is totally unbelievable, and his going to bed with her seems just icky. Most of what this actor, who is a very good actor, does in this season seems weakly written and brings the show down.The writers, in the comments, seem in love with their guest women; they laugh. I found them, the ex-wife of the Brit (Parker Posey? I should have refamiliarized myself with everyone's name since I have anomia) and the comedian Sedaris seem to have been inserted in a kind of blinders-on way, the way you might try to palm off stoned, hilarious 'creativity' even after the high wears off. I felt used, that someone's laziness wasted my time during all those too-long bits.The actor who plays Kalinda, like all the actors, is very good. But her fluctuating British posh-not-posh accent is distracting. Sometimes I think some Brits have a very low opinion of Americans' view of British accents -- that they're all the same. But we've seen enough regional British movies that we can almost place some characters' accents within Britain and between classes. Kalinda's fluctuating one is distracting in itself but especially when she effects a more upper-class accent. Then, all I can think of is, 'she's doing that again'.

It just so happens that for me, the law holds limited appeal. But - the story lines are intriguing, the personal relationships are very complex, the characters are nuanced - not easy to figure out.  Each episode leaves me wanting more.  There is an element of suspense.  And the main character, Alicia Florrick (played brilliantly by Julianna Margulies) is maturing, growing and evolving over time (as are most of the principal characters.)  Maybe the most fascinating of all is Kalinda (Archie Panjabi, also amazing).  Kalinda plays it so close to the vest that when she shows her hand even a little, it is a revelation. And as an ensemble cast, they all work together beautifully.
