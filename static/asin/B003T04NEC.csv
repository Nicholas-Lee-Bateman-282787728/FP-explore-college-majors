1361831,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B003T04NEC,Anthony Pittore,"[5, 7]","Jonathan Merrick (Wes Bentley) has it all: a beautiful girlfriend, a successful writing career, the respect of his colleagues. All of this is put on the line, however, when he unwillingly becomes entangled with a student, Ligeia (Sofya Skya), who has become unhealthily interested with him through his lectures on the macabre. Unbeknownst to Jonathan, his returned infatuation with Ligeia comes not from her Eastern European beauty or sexy accent, but from the black magic which she practices in order to seek the immortality that her ancestors before her could not attain.In recent years, there have been a huge number of indie straight-to-video adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories & poems, including literally a dozen versions of 'The Tell-Tale Heart.' Poe's story 'Ligeia' has only been the source material for a few adaptations, though, with the most well known being the Roger Corman/Vincent Price matchup 'The Tomb of Ligeia' (1964). There are reasons why 'Ligeia' is not as popular to adapt as other Poe pieces like 'The Fall of the House of Usher' or 'The Raven.' For one, it's not as popular a story as some of those others. But, the real reason is that it's simply just a difficult story to adapt. The original source material does not spread far with plot and it's told, like much of Poe's work, within the head of our narrator. Therefore, there are a lot of additions that a screenwriter would have to make to be able to make this an interesting and entertaining film. Unfortunately, writer John Shirley ('The Crow') did not succeed there in the slightest.To be memorable in the independent sector of horror, a film must either be very bad or very good. There are hundreds of horror films released each year and the wide majority of those will go unseen by even the most dedicated horror fan. This is why mediocrity is just about the worst curse for a horror film that wishes to be appreciated, or even remembered. For rookie director Michael Staininger, the graveyard of mediocrity is sadly where his first film will be laid to rest. This is because nearly every aspect of 'Ligeia' falls in the ranges of unimpressive or subpar. The acting is bland and boring, even from typically dependable actors like Michael Madsen, Eric Roberts, and Wes Bentley, who has performed well in the past with films like 'American Beauty' and 'P2' (though, his recovery from drug abuse may be a cause of this downfall). There is very little creativity with cinematography, even though the crew did have quite a few excellent locations which would have played nicely with talent behind the camera. However, the real reason for the film's lackluster quality is, without a doubt, the main creative components: the script & the directing. It's sad to see John Shirley, who started his film career with a bang penning the cult classic 'The Crow' in the '90s, sunk to the level of straight-to-video boredom like this film. Also, the rookie director's lack of ability to properly execute anything special with the mundane material also crippled the film's chances. These two components, as they would for any film, killed all opportunity 'Ligeia' had from ever reaching anything worthwhile.To sum up, other than the intriguing concept and the various settings, there isn't much to see with this film. It's poorly executed, boring, and boasts some truly disappointing performances by a usually impressive cast.Final Verdict: 4/10. Not a good start to the Fright Fest.-AP3-",2,An intriguing concept marred by bland acting and a boring script,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,3461,"['Jonathan', 'Merrick', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'successful', 'writing', 'career', 'respect', 'colleagues', 'put', 'line', 'however', 'when', 'unwillingly', 'entangled', 'student', 'Ligeia', 'Sofya', 'Skya', 'who', 'become', 'unhealthily', 'interested', 'lectures', 'macabre', 'Unbeknownst', 'Jonathan', 'returned', 'infatuation', 'Ligeia', 'not', 'Eastern', 'European', 'beauty', 'sexy', 'accent', 'black', 'magic', 'practices', 'order', 'seek', 'immortality', 'ancestors', 'could', 'not', 'attain.In', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'number', 'indie', 'straight-to-video', 'adaptations', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'stories', 'poems', 'including', 'literally', 'dozen', 'versions', ""'The"", 'Tell-Tale', 'Heart', 'Poe', 'story', ""'Ligeia"", 'only', 'been', 'source', 'material', 'few', 'adaptations', 'though', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'being', 'Roger', 'Corman/Vincent', 'Price', 'matchup', 'Tomb', 'Ligeia', '1964', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', ""'Ligeia"", 'not', 'popular', 'adapt', 'other', 'Poe', 'pieces', ""'The"", 'Fall', 'House', 'Usher', 'Raven', 'one', 'not', 'popular', 'story', 'others', 'real', 'reason', 'simply', 'just', 'difficult', 'story', 'adapt', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'spread', 'far', 'plot', 'told', 'much', 'Poe', 'work', 'head', 'narrator', 'Therefore', 'are', 'lot', 'additions', 'screenwriter', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'writer', 'John', 'Shirley', 'Crow', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'there', 'slightest.To', 'be', 'memorable', 'independent', 'sector', 'horror', 'film', 'must', 'either', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'hundreds', 'horror', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'wide', 'majority', 'will', 'go', 'unseen', 'even', 'most', 'dedicated', 'horror', 'fan', 'why', 'mediocrity', 'just', 'worst', 'curse', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'appreciated', 'even', 'remembered', 'rookie', 'director', 'Michael', 'Staininger', 'graveyard', 'mediocrity', 'sadly', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'laid', 'rest', 'because', 'nearly', 'aspect', ""'Ligeia"", 'falls', 'ranges', 'unimpressive', 'subpar', 'acting', 'bland', 'boring', 'even', 'typically', 'dependable', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'who', 'performed', 'well', 'past', 'films', ""'American"", 'Beauty', ""'P2"", 'recovery', 'drug', 'abuse', 'may', 'be', 'cause', 'downfall', 'very', 'little', 'creativity', 'cinematography', 'even', 'crew', 'did', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'excellent', 'locations', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'nicely', 'talent', 'camera', 'However', 'real', 'reason', 'film', 'lackluster', 'quality', 'doubt', 'main', 'creative', 'components', 'script', 'directing', 'sad', 'see', 'John', 'Shirley', 'who', 'started', 'film', 'career', 'bang', 'penning', 'cult', 'classic', 'Crow', ""'90s"", 'sunk', 'level', 'straight-to-video', 'boredom', 'film', 'Also', 'rookie', 'director', 'lack', 'ability', 'properly', 'execute', 'anything', 'special', 'mundane', 'material', 'also', 'crippled', 'film', 'chances', 'two', 'components', 'would', 'film', 'killed', 'opportunity', ""'Ligeia"", 'had', 'ever', 'reaching', 'anything', 'worthwhile.To', 'sum', 'up', 'other', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'various', 'settings', ""n't"", 'much', 'see', 'film', 'poorly', 'executed', 'boring', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'performances', 'usually', 'impressive', 'cast.Final', 'Verdict', '4/10', 'Not', 'good', 'start', 'Fright', 'Fest.-AP3-']",N/A

I watched it and immediately fell in love with it. I went online to look up the original short story by Poe to compare and contrast what i had seen. And i intend to check out Roger Corman/Vincent Price's adaptation as well. As we all know, Vincent Price was the master of horror and all movies related to Poe! I think all the actors and actresses, some fresh faces and others well known like Wes Bentley and Michael Madsen. Wes Bentley has that unique look and presence that makes him perfect for his part as Professor Merrick and the actress playing Ligeia couldn't be more fitting!

This is probably one of the best none vampire movies I have ever seen. If only ""Queen of the Damned"" could have been this well produced? I thought this film was well done and very unique in its own right. The actress Sofya Skya was stunning to look at. And I am guessing  the people that wrote these reviews aren't fascinated with the MaCaBrE? This is a very sexy story and and a very dark tale about a woman that seduces and manipulates. She is also a witch with a ulterior motive to live forever ! The movie was paced well had beautiful scenery in Russia what more can you want? I thought it was well produced and could have made the big screen in my opinion. It didn't appear at all that this was on a skeleton budget or rushed. I think if you like beautiful seductive evil women you should check this out. If you don't ? Then this may not be your cup of tea at all. I like the film because it was dark , beautiful, Twisted and sexy as H*ll ! I also felt it was the best out of the Fangoria Fright fest and was unlike anything else I have ever seen. The only other one I would recommend out of that batch of films is ""The Hunger"" and its nothing new but well done. Keep in mind this is based off a short tale by ""Edgar Allan Poe"" called ""Ligeia"". Which was her name in the film which I found rather exotic and sexy. Watch this film on your own merit don't go off the reviews, because you may miss out on a good film. I almost passed on this one and this turned out to be my favorite out of the series. And if you want to see a really sick movie watch ""Grimm Love"" its based of true events. I personally thought it was done well but i didn't care for the subject matter. But those are the only other two that I thought were well acted that I would recommend.",5,Edgar Allen Poe's ....

Well, there are plenty of options in the horror section, but this one is among the worst.  Really, if you smash protons together you'll find more realistic character motivation than in this movie.The plot to this movie, based loosely on ""Ligeia"" by Edgar Allen Poe, jumps from scene to scene without the sort of connective tissue that most movies use to explain the change (professionals call this a ""story"").  What is it exactly that motivates Ligeia to do... whatever it is that she's doing?  All of the sex, violence, forgiveness and love happens only to fill screen time, with none of it coming from who the characters are.
