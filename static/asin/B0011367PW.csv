1129316,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0011367PW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[11, 12]","Quite popular in its home country of Japan, ""Boys Love"" (2006) has just recently been released in a subtitled DVD in the US.The film tells the story of Mamiya, a 20-something journalist, who is assigned to do a profile on popular teen model (and amateur artist) Kisaragi Noeru.  Mature for his years, Noeru takes control of their meeting, and later of Mamiya himself, as he introduces the young journalist to his first experience with man-to-man sex.  Visiting Noeru a few days later, Mamiya learns that Noeru is more than a bit of a slut, and seems incapable of settling down with one person or keeping his word to anyone, including his best friend Chidori, who has an unrequitted crush on Noeru.  After Noelru picks the wrong person to go home with, and is the victim of a gaybashing, Mamiya learns from him why he is leery of forming a close relationship with other. amd pledges to be there for him, which turns Chidori into a jealous rage.It's actually a simplistic story, stretched out to fill almost an hour and a half.  Though the film is chock full of great eye candy, the acting is a bit ""over the top"" and tedious at times.  I could also have done without the ""proverbs"" used by the director to transition from one scene to another, which I found to be anmoying after a while.  The ending seemed contrived and hardly logical, as well as unnecessarily depressing.  I would rate it four out of five stars for the eye candy, but only two for everything else, so let's call it an average of three stars out of five.",3,"Great eye candy, but not much else",1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,1521,"['Quite', 'popular', 'home', 'country', 'Japan', 'Boys', 'Love', '2006', 'just', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'subtitled', 'DVD', 'US.The', 'film', 'story', 'Mamiya', '20-something', 'journalist', 'who', 'assigned', 'do', 'profile', 'popular', 'teen', 'model', 'amateur', 'artist', 'Kisaragi', 'Noeru', 'Mature', 'years', 'Noeru', 'control', 'meeting', 'later', 'Mamiya', 'young', 'journalist', 'first', 'experience', 'man-to-man', 'sex', 'Visiting', 'Noeru', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'Mamiya', 'Noeru', 'more', 'bit', 'slut', 'incapable', 'settling', 'down', 'one', 'person', 'keeping', 'word', 'anyone', 'including', 'best', 'friend', 'Chidori', 'who', 'unrequitted', 'crush', 'Noeru', 'Noelru', 'wrong', 'person', 'go', 'home', 'victim', 'gaybashing', 'Mamiya', 'why', 'leery', 'forming', 'close', 'relationship', 'other', 'amd', 'pledges', 'be', 'there', 'Chidori', 'jealous', 'rage.It', 'actually', 'simplistic', 'story', 'stretched', 'out', 'fill', 'almost', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'acting', 'bit', 'top', 'tedious', 'times', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'done', 'proverbs', 'used', 'director', 'transition', 'one', 'scene', 'found', 'be', 'anmoying', 'while', 'ending', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'hardly', 'logical', 'as', 'well', 'unnecessarily', 'depressing', 'would', 'rate', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'eye', 'candy', 'only', 'two', 'everything', 'else', 'let', 'call', 'average', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",N/A

1129318,A3SZOI769OV86F,B0011367PW,Mike Ross,"[6, 6]","I initially approached the movie from a manga-esque, bishonen point of view, and I was not too off the mark. My expectations were not too high for the intelligibility of the script, but focused mainly on Asian eyecandy -- in which regard I wasn't disappointed.I half expected to see some sort of anime/manga-based art work on the walls as Taishin (Kotani Yoshikazu) interviews Noel (Saito Takumi) on his 'art,' but groaned when I saw kindergarten-level art instead. Already the story line was apparently unraveling. Thankfully Noel had a modeling career, and that didn't seem too far fetched, given his beauty. Suspension of disbelief was engaged, and I moved forward.But, surprisingly, overall, the movie quality was good and the acting was quite decent and believable, and I found I had to start re-evaluating my prior assessment of the film as the character interactions became more complex, and more of the story line was revealed. I was equally pleasantly surprised how the movie shifted from initial sex to the gradual telling of how the characters were falling in love. The movie was actually becoming better and better. Some people might object to the occasional quotes on the nature of love during the course of the movie; I actually quite liked them. They didn't detract, in my estimation, but underscored various aspects of the film and the changes occurring in and between the main characters.Although the story line was somewhat predictable, the movie was, nevertheless, engaging and quite enjoyable. It was fun watching Taishin learn to swim and Noel to box. There was an onscreen chemistry between the two. I was thoroughly enjoying the film right up to the end -- and then I had a major reality disconnect as well as quite a shock. Without giving things away, it wasn't so much that they went to the ocean, it was WHY they went to the ocean and not to a much more obvious, rational place, especially given their current plight. And then there was the final scene... Immeasurably sad. And, yet, I shouldn't have been in shock given my original mind set -- Manga. It all made sense, in a way, given that point of reference. I had, simply, become engrossed in the movie and forgotten the obvious.If you're looking for a light, frivolous, fun film such as 'Another Gay Movie,' this is not it. I watched the film three days ago and I'm still thinking about it. For me it held a visceral punch at the end which continues, as I said, to linger with me.  Still, I recommend it and feel it deserves a better rating than some have given.",4,Visceral,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2543,"['initially', 'approached', 'movie', 'manga-esque', 'bishonen', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'mark', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'high', 'intelligibility', 'script', 'focused', 'mainly', 'Asian', 'eyecandy', 'regard', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.I', 'half', 'expected', 'see', 'sort', 'anime/manga-based', 'art', 'work', 'walls', 'Taishin', 'Kotani', 'Yoshikazu', 'Noel', 'Saito', 'Takumi', ""'art"", 'groaned', 'when', 'saw', 'kindergarten-level', 'art', 'instead', 'Already', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'apparently', 'unraveling', 'Thankfully', 'Noel', 'had', 'modeling', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'given', 'beauty', 'Suspension', 'disbelief', 'was', 'engaged', 'moved', 'forward.But', 'surprisingly', 'overall', 'movie', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'decent', 'believable', 'found', 'had', 'start', 're-evaluating', 'prior', 'assessment', 'film', 'character', 'interactions', 'became', 'more', 'complex', 'more', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'equally', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'movie', 'shifted', 'initial', 'sex', 'gradual', 'telling', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'falling', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'becoming', 'better', 'better', 'people', 'might', 'object', 'occasional', 'quotes', 'nature', 'love', 'course', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'estimation', 'underscored', 'various', 'aspects', 'film', 'changes', 'occurring', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'movie', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'engaging', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'Taishin', 'learn', 'swim', 'Noel', 'box', 'was', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'then', 'had', 'major', 'reality', 'disconnect', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'shock', 'giving', 'things', 'away', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'went', 'ocean', 'was', 'WHY', 'went', 'ocean', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'rational', 'place', 'especially', 'given', 'current', 'plight', 'then', 'was', 'final', 'scene', 'Immeasurably', 'sad', 'yet', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shock', 'given', 'original', 'mind', 'set', 'Manga', 'made', 'sense', 'way', 'given', 'point', 'reference', 'had', 'simply', 'become', 'engrossed', 'movie', 'forgotten', 'obvious.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light', 'frivolous', 'fun', 'film', 'such', 'Gay', 'Movie', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'three', 'days', 'ago', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'held', 'visceral', 'punch', 'end', 'said', 'linger', 'Still', 'recommend', 'feel', 'better', 'rating', 'have', 'given']",N/A

I could tell from the very beginning that I was going to like this feature as there was an air of class. Again, like many of the foreign movies I have seen and reviewed recently, this one can be added to the list of countries. As I repeated before it is not just the gay subject what make these movies fascinating to me, but the cultures and the people that are being portrayed as well.This is again another tragic story, a love triangle. There is three main characters: Noel, Mamiya, and Chirodi. Noel and Chirodi are high school students. Noel is a famous beautiful model and painter. Chirodi is the nerd, shy, intelligent boy who is secretly in love with Noel. They are both gay. Mamiya (that is his last name) is an editor in a magazine who is doing a column on Noel.The first interview between Mamiya and Noel includes an expensive dinner in a fancy restaurant, and the seduction by Noel to Mamiya in the bathroom. Mamiya is shocked and gets extremely angry refusing to continue on this story, telling his boss the following day.As the days go by, Mamiya starts to question his sexuality and the experience in the bathroom. He goes back to Noel's place to find him in bed with another man. Mamiya makes a pact with Noel to stop whoring himself and the friendship and love develops between the two of them.Chirodi becomes enraged with Noel's new found love and tells him how he feels about him. Noel goes on a drinking rampage and gets raped and beaten on the streets. Mamiya reads it on the paper and comes to his friend aid, is then that he realizes that he is in love with Noel. Chirodi catches both of them in the bedroom and tells his employer of his affair. Mamiya looses his job but he is happy. He finds a new job in Noel's model agency.The story ends tragically when Chirodi surprises both of them and stabs Noel with a knife. The final scene shows Mamiya taking his lover to an ocean spot which is one of Noel's painting. This painting has something to do with a boy from his childhood who he was in love with but dies.There are quotations throughout the movie from famous people in history dealing with love, they are nice and inspirational, adding class to the movie.I like this movie, it has class. It focus on love between men. There are a few male nude scene, not frontal. There was never sex between Mamiya and Noel nor Chirodi, just the love triangle. There is featurette on the making of the movie, interviews of the directors and actors. Saito Takumi (Noel) is extremely handsome, the other young actors are very boyish in their looks. They all stated that they are not gay. I am not sure the director is gay.",4,Classy,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2679,"['Japanese', 'Picture', 'production', 'could', 'tell', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'feature', 'was', 'air', 'class', 'Again', 'many', 'foreign', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'reviewed', 'recently', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'list', 'countries', 'repeated', 'not', 'just', 'gay', 'subject', 'what', 'make', 'movies', 'fascinating', 'cultures', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'portrayed', 'well.This', 'again', 'tragic', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Noel', 'Mamiya', 'Chirodi', 'Noel', 'Chirodi', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Noel', 'famous', 'beautiful', 'model', 'painter', 'Chirodi', 'nerd', 'shy', 'intelligent', 'boy', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Noel', 'are', 'gay', 'Mamiya', 'last', 'name', 'editor', 'magazine', 'who', 'doing', 'column', 'Noel.The', 'first', 'interview', 'Mamiya', 'Noel', 'expensive', 'dinner', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'seduction', 'Noel', 'Mamiya', 'bathroom', 'Mamiya', 'shocked', 'extremely', 'angry', 'refusing', 'continue', 'story', 'telling', 'boss', 'following', 'day.As', 'days', 'go', 'Mamiya', 'question', 'sexuality', 'experience', 'bathroom', 'back', 'Noel', 'place', 'find', 'bed', 'man', 'Mamiya', 'pact', 'Noel', 'stop', 'whoring', 'friendship', 'love', 'develops', 'two', 'them.Chirodi', 'becomes', 'enraged', 'Noel', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'how', 'Noel', 'drinking', 'rampage', 'raped', 'beaten', 'streets', 'Mamiya', 'paper', 'friend', 'aid', 'then', 'love', 'Noel', 'Chirodi', 'bedroom', 'employer', 'affair', 'Mamiya', 'job', 'happy', 'new', 'job', 'Noel', 'model', 'agency.The', 'story', 'ends', 'tragically', 'when', 'Chirodi', 'stabs', 'Noel', 'knife', 'final', 'scene', 'shows', 'Mamiya', 'taking', 'lover', 'ocean', 'spot', 'one', 'Noel', 'painting', 'painting', 'something', 'do', 'boy', 'childhood', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'are', 'quotations', 'movie', 'famous', 'people', 'history', 'dealing', 'love', 'are', 'nice', 'inspirational', 'adding', 'class', 'movie.I', 'movie', 'class', 'love', 'men', 'are', 'few', 'male', 'nude', 'scene', 'not', 'frontal', 'was', 'never', 'sex', 'Mamiya', 'Noel', 'Chirodi', 'just', 'love', 'triangle', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'interviews', 'directors', 'actors', 'Saito', 'Takumi', 'Noel', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'boyish', 'looks', 'stated', 'are', 'not', 'gay', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'director', 'gay']",N/A
