I thought it was cool at the time, for I watched Erin Gray, the love interest in the film, on ""Silver Spoons"" and ""Buck Rogers."" (Little did I realize that the coolest person in the film would turn out to be Diane Lane, who would go on to get an Oscar nomination in 2003. Of course, her biggest claim-to-fame then was ""A Little Romance."")When it came out months later, everyone crowded the theater to see how the whole thing came out. And it was bad. To give you an example of how bad the film was, it has a character in it named Breezy, and it's about unruly children and NASCAR racing.But the town was recognizable, so that's something interesting. I can say I've walked past the same Western Auto that Diane Lane did in that rain scene.(To see more films made in my hometown, rent Steve Martin's A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE, which was a modern version of ""Silas Marner."" It bombed at the box office like this one, though the reason it bombed is because ""Silas Marner"" is awful.)Anyway, SIX PACK is bad.",1,"This movie is bad, but it was filmed in my hometown.",1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,1136,"['Once', 'time', ""'80s"", 'when', 'was', 'elementary', 'school', 'film', 'crew', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'invaded', 'Buford', 'filming', 'scenes', 'SIX', 'PACK', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'time', 'watched', 'Erin', 'Gray', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'Silver', 'Spoons', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'Little', 'did', 'realize', 'coolest', 'person', 'film', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '2003', 'course', 'biggest', 'claim-to-fame', 'then', 'was', 'Little', 'Romance', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'months', 'later', 'everyone', 'crowded', 'theater', 'see', 'how', 'whole', 'thing', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'bad', 'give', 'example', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'character', 'named', 'Breezy', 'unruly', 'children', 'NASCAR', 'racing.But', 'town', 'was', 'recognizable', 'something', 'interesting', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'same', 'Western', 'Auto', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'did', 'rain', 'scene', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'made', 'hometown', 'rent', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'A', 'SIMPLE', 'TWIST', 'OF', 'FATE', 'was', 'modern', 'version', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'one', 'reason', 'bombed', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'awful', 'Anyway', 'SIX', 'PACK', 'bad']",N/A

There's some fond memories tied to it.  That's why I gave it 5 stars.  Purely selfish reasons.  You should probably downgrade it 1.5 stars (making it 3.5 stars) to get a more accurate review.Six Pack reminds me of other, much better, movies such as THE BAD NEWS BEARS.  It never has the cleverness of BEARS, but it has a certain appeal that makes its downfalls forgivable.  It's biggest strength lies in the wonderful cast.  The troup of young actors come off quite well.  I couldn't keep my eyes off &quot;Breezy&quot;.  What a doll!  I think that actress was in EDDIE AND THE CRUSERS.  Kenny Rogers was at a high point in his popularity too.  He has some good moments here.Avoid if you have really &quot;younguns&quot; around because of the language (which is unfortunate, since &quot;younguns&quot; will enjoy this most).

Everything he did was pure gold. He can sing a little too. I run into people each day that tell me they wish they could go back and live in the 80s. I always tell them that my solution to time travel is about 4 months away, but they can capture everything great about the decade by picking up anything with Kenny Rogers. It is a lot to say one man summed up a decade, but KRog did that. One listen to Islands in the Stream by Kenny and that girl with big thingies just leaves you speechless. It's how a song should be performed. They are saying they are islands in a stream, that's all they are. Only Fish from Barney Miller said so much by saying so little and he's dead I think.Well, I know I can't do it justice(that's saying a great deal because I'm brilliant), but I'll try to sum up the sheer mass of six pack. You know how people love NASCAR all around the world now? In 1982, most people weren't aware that there was such as thing as driving in circles for hours to amuse simple minded hicks. Six pack let everyone in on the secret throught the power of pint sized Kurt Bushes and Danica Patricks. Tony Stewart would be selling appliances on street corners if it weren't for Kenny Rogers selling a country on auto racing. You know what, Enya has gotten better looking over the years, I'd probably think about doing her now. Back to Kenny, the only thing I would change about this movie would be to have him sing his lines because america, heck, the world, loves Kenny singing a tune. Well, in the end the kids win the Coke 250 by 18 laps because they develop a special fuel made of poop. It is a simple story, but your life will never be the same.

It has heart & soul, and the ending is beautiful. If you are a Kenny Rogers or Diane Lane fan this would be a great movie to add to your collection. A young Diane Lane gives a great performance as Breezy. If you want a movie mixed with country music, racing and some real passion, then you need to get this movie. It is highly recommended by me.",5,Not Just A Racing Flick,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,454,"['Most', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'racing', 'movie', 'Well', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'not', 'heart', 'soul', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'are', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'young', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'great', 'performance', 'Breezy', 'want', 'movie', 'mixed', 'country', 'music', 'racing', 'real', 'passion', 'then', 'need', 'get', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
