604067,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005JLR5,Anyechka,"[1, 3]","This is one of those films that's so complex, multi-faceted, and thought-provoking that it really isn't fair to judge it based on just one viewing alone.  It gets better and makes more sense with repeated viewings.  The audio commentary also helps in understanding it better, explaining or clearing up some things that might not be fully understood, like some of the back stories or scenes that were deleted.  There are so many wonderful deep themes running through this film, like tolerance, the ability to communicate, how the Armenian Genocide has shaped 4 generations (the survivor Arshile Gorky, who was a real historical figure and an amazing artist; Edward Saroyan, the director of the film within the film, the son of a survivor; Ani and her dead first husband, the grandchildren of survivors; and finally young Raffi, the great-grandchild of survivors), memory, denial, the power of symbols, and the fine line between what is real and what is an illusion.  The device of a film within a film particularly brings this lattermost point home; it's used so effectively and hauntingly that often one is left wondering if we're seeing actual historical events in flashback, the inner thoughts and memories of the painter Gorky, the film being shot by Saroyan, or the film as it's being played at its premiere.  It often feels as though one is watching actual events instead of scenes being filmed for another film; a prime example of this is when Ani storms onto the set, destroying a scene that took quite some time to set up, and is berated by the actor playing Dr. Clarence Ussher, who really seems to be talking from the pov of his character, as though he's living these horrific heartbreaking events, and not just some actor who's justifiably angry that she ruined the scene for a seemingly trivial reason.  It's also high time that a film depicted the Armenian Genocide, although of course the Turks are still denying this happened over 90 years later, which makes me livid with rage.However, this film does seem a bit over-reaching at times, with so many different themes, subplots, and characters, and only a bit under two hours to cover them all and to try to tie them all back together at the end.  We have the film within the film; the story of Arshile Gorky and his famous painting based on a picture taken of him and his mother in 1912; the story of Ali, who plays the evil character Jedvet Bey and who, off-screen, is the partner of Philip; the soon-to-be-retired customs agent David's struggle to accept the fact that his son Philip has left his wife and come out of the closet; the back story of how exactly Ani's second husband died; Ani's troubled relationship with her stepdaughter Celia; Raffi's affair with Celia (they're not blood-related, so it's not incest, even though most people don't accept the idea of stepsiblings having romantic or sexual relationships); Ani's strained relationship with her son Raffi; and finally one of the main plots, Raffi's long interrogation with David, who is convinced that he's smuggling drugs into Canada in what he unwaveringly argues are cans of exposed film for the film within the film.  Much of the film is told as a flashback during this interrogation, during which Raffi is able to explain the Armenian Genocide to an odar (non-Armenian), and ultimately to validate his own experience as a fourth-generation survivor and who he really is, what being Armenian and what this legacy of memory mean to him.As thought-provoking and moving as this film is, however, it can seem a bit like it overshot the mark, since not all of the subplots seem to be fully resolved or dealt with by the end.  For example, there didn't seem to be any resolution to Ali's story, this half-Turkish actor who feels that his people are the ones telling the truth about these events, who gets scarily into his evil character, and yet who also says this is a new country and that past hatreds and wounds should be put aside.  Perhaps it would have been even better had it been even longer, with more time to fully resolve and explore some of these subplots and back stories, or if a few of them had been eliminated altogether or just scaled back, to allow for the most important stories to take centre stage.  Still, in spite of feeling uneven in spots, this very multi-layered film is designed to make people think, and is a good sight better than most of the trash coming out of Hollywood these days.  The soundtrack is also gorgeous, and many of the songs use genuine Armenian instruments.  It also helps that most of the actors are Armenians themselves, so one gets even more of a feeling that they're acting out their people's real history instead of odars attempting to capture the essence of the Armenian spirit and their people's national consciousness and collective memory.  I'm an odar myself, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in this potent story and history, both Armenian and odar.",4,"Perhaps a bit over-reaching, but still very good",1161648000,"10 24,

604068,A35QKJ2THM46RK,B00005JLR5,Arthur C. Hurwitz,"[13, 21]","I liked this movie because unlike most movies about massacre and persecution in the Old World, this movie follows up on the persecuted peoples, in this case the Armenians, as they find the life in their new country-of-refusge, Canada.  As is the case with real, live human beings, escaping persecution to safety and &quot;freedom&quot; is not enough to address the complexity of the human soul.  All of the Armenian-Canadians portrayed in the film live in a New World context and suffer from New World problems along with the alienations and isolations of New World lives.  As in all Egoyan movies, most of the film protagonists in this exsemble work do not exist merely as didactic sterotypes.  They breath, their relationship to their heritage is compromised in the personal life, they suffer.  They suffer in a way which is special to the New World, Canada and The United States alike.Instead of bringing us a dry, linear account, the story of the Armenian massacre in Eastern Turkey is told indirectly, through the filming of a film about it.  In many instances the viewer is confused, not certain if it actually is a flashback to the actual past or merely the scenes of the massacre being filmed for the film.  Does it matter?  What is the relationship between the actual events and the events portrayed in the film?  One keeps wondering about that.Like all Egoyan films, the production is professional and smooth.  The themes of his earlier movies about emotional disconnection and the use of video and vice to overcome that disconnection appear here as well.  That is perhaps what makes this movie special:  In exploring his own Armenian heritage, he never drops the ball of his old themese and concerns.  He never forgets or ignores thay they are all in Canada now and that the fact that the Armenians were persecuted in the Old World, does not solve their problems of existentiality and their own estrangement in a New World Society.Egoyan offers us a new model for the making of films about cataclyismic, life ruining problems.

While it isn't always successful (some of the actors aren't quite up to the task), I didn't care.In case anyone misses it, Arshile Gorky (the film's artist) was a real painter. He didn't speak until he was 6, but he could express himself incredibly well through art. Gorky's mother had seen her own father nailed to a church door, and she was forced to watch as the Turks murdered her first husband. She later died by Gorky's side as the fled east of their home away from the Turks.The photograph of Gorky and his mother is also a real artifact that inspired (and tormented) his later work. Gorky took his name later in life when he came to America. It means ""bitter"" in Russian. In 1946, his studio burnt down, and a later operation gave him a colostomy bag. Finally, a car crash and a physical altercation with his wife led to his family leaving him in 1948.

604073,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005JLR5,Doug Anderson,"[8, 12]","This film is considered important because it brings to light a virtually forgotten(by some) episode in twentieth-century history: the genocide of  1.5 million Armenians by the Turks during WWI. Unfortunately the film never really explains why it happened nor does it explain why it was forgotten. In other words the history is presented but not examined. What is examined is how the genocide continues to haunt the Armenians.For those interested in the facts I would suggest a recent book: The Burning Tigris, The Armenian Genocide and America's Response by Peter Balakian.Arsinee Khanjian plays Ani an art history professor who has just written a book about Arshile Gorky. She has also been twice widowed. One of her husbands died trying to assassinate a Turkish official( a revolutionary act or an act of terrorism depending on your perspective) and another husband committed sucide or fell or was pushed from a cliff--uncertainty informs every aspect of these characters lives.  Ani lives in a kind of academic cocoon; she hides behind her expertise and only indirectly deals with the past by studying and lecturing about Gorky who was a survivor of the genocide.  When she is hired as a consultant on a film version of the genocide she reluctantly accepts the position and  compromises her reputation and integrity. Why she does this is unclear. Her son(by the revolutionary-terrorist)  meanwhile is having an affair with his stepsister(her dad the one that fell or was pushed). Both children struggle with their private histories and each comforts the other one as they try to come to terms with a past that their mother avoids.  Confused? Well the film makes it all clear, to a point. The psychologies of these three are explored and they are each intriguing individuals dealing with the past in their own private way. Arguably though they are not explored  thoroughly enough and even at the end of the film I am not certain there is any real understanding between these three or if the audience has been given enough information to really feel they know what they each have gone through.  It is perhaps a minor (or major) fault of the film that it is so complex that you find yourself focusing more on keeping the plot straight than on really understanding what drives the characters. I watched it twice however and even after a second viewing there is still a lot that reamins vague about these characters to me still.  Why did Ani accept the consulting position? What does her son learn when he visits Ararat by himself and how does this transform him?  Does the daughter really love her brother or is this just her way of taking revenge on her mother?Egoyan films are fascinating because they enter into realms of emotion that no man (at least no film maker) has gone before. The psychologies Egoyan focuses on are all in pain so his films are difficult on the emotions.  The actress who played the daughter Cecile(I beleive she is Spanish) is particularly excellent.  As difficult at it is to watch her performance is an eerlily authentic one.Arshile Gorky's famous self-portrait as a child standing next to his mother  represents the irrevovable past and lost innocence. But it bothered me that Ani allowed herself to be used by the film within a films director and writers who simply wanted her name to lend credibility to the very uncredible fictionalizing of Gorky's life.Elias Koteas plays a Turkish actor hired to play a Turkish official in the film within a film. On screen he gives a powerful performance and offscreen he openly denies that the genocide actually occured. It is a role(and attitude) which could have been explored more thoroughly. Instead it just feels like a token gesture to represent the Turkish version of the genocide (which in Egoyan's view is simply one of denial).The ambition behind Ararat is commendable but I think ultimately the film either should have been longer to allow for more character development (especially with the Koteas character) or there should have been fewer plot lines. It feels kind of like a juggling act at times with one too many items in the air.  Perhaps Egoyan purposely leaves many things unresolved because that is the way life is but as art it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Too many loose ends. They are interesting loose ends nonetheless.

604074,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B00005JLR5,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","This film is one that I approached viewing, after holding out for an edition with the bonus features that the supplementary second DVD of this one includes, with great expectation and even trepidation. After viewing ""Ararat"", with and without Atom Egoyan`s commentary on the movie itself and on the deleted scenes (as well as all of the many other bonus features), it left me even more profoundly moved even than I had expected to feel. I won`t write any extended review. The film is wonderfully rich and layered, with several strands of narrative weaving in and out along with many different perspectives on the part of the various characters in the movie. It takes careful viewing to appreciate how much this variety contributes to the film`s greatness and profundity, something that negative critics who find it confusing do not appreciate.The Armenian genocide is a delicate issue. I long have been involved with it through my interactions, here in Canada as well as in Turkish Kurdistan itself (where I made an humanitarian mission under joint Kurdish patriotic and U.S./Canadian Independent Lutheran auspices) in very intense involvement with the Kurds of Turkish occupied Kurdistan, a people who shared the ancestral lands which they inhabited along with the Armenian people. The tribe of two interrelated and intermarried Kurdish families with whose members I undertook most of the mission, in the greater Diyarbakir area (after two days with the Kurdish community of Istanbul outside of Kurdistan but within Turkey) included numerous Kurds of partial Armenian ancestry, although they all had become Muslim over the years since the time of the Armenian troubles prior to and during W.W. I.I was privileged to share the memories, passed on from one generation of them to the next, of how the Armenian genocide took place, not in this case in Van of the film`s setting, but in the Diyarbakir region, where other horrendous atrocities took place that have yet to be documented satisfactorily. The Turks had abused Kurds and Armenians alike over those long years, though at the time of the Armenian genocide the Kurds had been tricked into collaborating with the Turks, who turned on the Kurds once their cynical plans had been carried out, to the shame of the Kurds, who honestly repented of what they had done, and who since have acted in great solidarity (along with Greeks) of the cause of the Armenians who wish to expose and publicise the infamies of the ""Young Turks"" who overthrew the relatively tolerant Ottoman regime to establish a virulent Turkish racial and nationalist exclusivism that only tolerates Kurds, Greeks, Armenians, and other non-ethnic Turks if they assimilate.One of the most searing memories of the mission was standing at the top of an ancient ziggurat, from the heights of which my Kurdish hosts pointed out to me the path along which the Armenians were lined up from their own Kurdish village (one of the terminal points of this particular and spectacular massacre), single file, right to the city of Diyarbakir itself and gunned down or otherwise butchered for miles of corpses on end. Another memory was of seeing, elsewhere within the province of Diyarbakir, the ruins (only its foundation left) of the Armenian Orthodox Church in the Kurdish town and venerable Christian and Muslim holy site of Egil, on one of the steep slopes of this town which straddles two facing mountainsides. There I learned from eye-witnesses of this church`s destruction in the 1960s, decades after the famous Armenian attrocities, but years during which the Turks continued to destroy the antiquties of and Armenians and Kurds alike.  The antiquities in Egil, however, are not so arrestingly striking to the eyes as those in Van, which ""Ararat"", the film and the special features, shows in all of their delapidated, hauntingly strange splendour.I appreciate both Atom Egoyan's passion for his subject, in ""Ararat"", as well as his admission of some extenuating circumstances that help to soften the culpability of the Turks' cruel and rapacious behaviour at the time of W.W. I and later. The Armenians, to at least some extent, were aiding and abetting the Russian foes of the Ottoman Empire/burgeoning Republic of Turkey. However, the sheer brutality of the massacre of Armenian in Van and Diyarbakir, as the film shows the former, were inexcusable and utterly barbaric, way out of proportion to any just and limited retribution for some Armenians' collusion with the Russian Tsar's empire. Just how barbaric those purges were the film shows in terrifying vividness, as well as the impact of all this upon later generations of Armenians who have had to come to terms with such an heritage of suffering and loss.",5,"A Fine Cinematic Treatment of the Contentious Issue of the Armenian Genocide, Beautifully Filmed",1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,4727,"['film', 'one', 'approached', 'viewing', 'holding', 'out', 'edition', 'bonus', 'supplementary', 'second', 'DVD', 'one', 'great', 'expectation', 'even', 'trepidation', 'viewing', 'Ararat', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 's', 'commentary', 'movie', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'left', 'even', 'more', 'profoundly', 'moved', 'even', 'had', 'expected', 'feel', 'won', 't', 'write', 'extended', 'review', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'rich', 'layered', 'several', 'strands', 'narrative', 'weaving', 'many', 'different', 'perspectives', 'part', 'various', 'characters', 'movie', 'careful', 'viewing', 'appreciate', 'how', 'much', 'variety', 'film', 's', 'greatness', 'profundity', 'something', 'negative', 'critics', 'who', 'find', 'confusing', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate.The', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'delicate', 'issue', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'interactions', 'here', 'Canada', 'as', 'well', 'Turkish', 'Kurdistan', 'where', 'made', 'humanitarian', 'mission', 'joint', 'Kurdish', 'patriotic', 'U.S./Canadian', 'Independent', 'Lutheran', 'auspices', 'very', 'intense', 'involvement', 'Kurds', 'Turkish', 'occupied', 'Kurdistan', 'people', 'who', 'shared', 'ancestral', 'lands', 'inhabited', 'along', 'Armenian', 'people', 'tribe', 'two', 'interrelated', 'intermarried', 'Kurdish', 'families', 'members', 'undertook', 'most', 'mission', 'greater', 'Diyarbakir', 'area', 'two', 'days', 'Kurdish', 'community', 'Istanbul', 'Kurdistan', 'Turkey', 'included', 'numerous', 'Kurds', 'partial', 'Armenian', 'ancestry', 'had', 'become', 'Muslim', 'years', 'time', 'Armenian', 'troubles', 'prior', 'W.W.', 'I.I', 'was', 'privileged', 'share', 'memories', 'passed', 'one', 'generation', 'next', 'how', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'case', 'Van', 'film', 's', 'setting', 'Diyarbakir', 'region', 'where', 'other', 'horrendous', 'atrocities', 'took', 'place', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'documented', 'satisfactorily', 'Turks', 'had', 'abused', 'Kurds', 'Armenians', 'alike', 'long', 'years', 'though', 'time', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'Kurds', 'had', 'been', 'tricked', 'collaborating', 'Turks', 'who', 'turned', 'Kurds', 'once', 'cynical', 'plans', 'had', 'been', 'carried', 'out', 'shame', 'Kurds', 'who', 'honestly', 'repented', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'who', 'have', 'acted', 'great', 'solidarity', 'Greeks', 'cause', 'Armenians', 'who', 'wish', 'expose', 'publicise', 'infamies', 'Young', 'Turks', 'who', 'overthrew', 'relatively', 'tolerant', 'Ottoman', 'regime', 'establish', 'virulent', 'Turkish', 'racial', 'nationalist', 'exclusivism', 'only', 'Kurds', 'Greeks', 'Armenians', 'other', 'non-ethnic', 'Turks', 'assimilate.One', 'most', 'searing', 'memories', 'mission', 'was', 'standing', 'top', 'ancient', 'ziggurat', 'heights', 'Kurdish', 'hosts', 'pointed', 'out', 'path', 'Armenians', 'were', 'lined', 'up', 'own', 'Kurdish', 'village', 'one', 'terminal', 'points', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'massacre', 'single', 'file', 'right', 'city', 'Diyarbakir', 'gunned', 'down', 'otherwise', 'butchered', 'miles', 'corpses', 'end', 'memory', 'was', 'seeing', 'elsewhere', 'province', 'Diyarbakir', 'ruins', 'only', 'foundation', 'left', 'Armenian', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'Kurdish', 'town', 'venerable', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'holy', 'site', 'Egil', 'one', 'steep', 'slopes', 'town', 'two', 'facing', 'mountainsides', 'learned', 'eye-witnesses', 'church', 's', 'destruction', '1960s', 'decades', 'famous', 'Armenian', 'attrocities', 'years', 'Turks', 'continued', 'destroy', 'antiquties', 'Armenians', 'Kurds', 'alike', 'antiquities', 'Egil', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'arrestingly', 'striking', 'eyes', 'Van', 'Ararat', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'shows', 'delapidated', 'hauntingly', 'strange', 'splendour.I', 'appreciate', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'passion', 'subject', 'Ararat', 'as', 'well', 'admission', 'extenuating', 'circumstances', 'help', 'soften', 'culpability', 'Turks', 'cruel', 'rapacious', 'behaviour', 'time', 'W.W', 'later', 'Armenians', 'least', 'extent', 'were', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'Russian', 'foes', 'Ottoman', 'Empire/burgeoning', 'Republic', 'Turkey', 'However', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'massacre', 'Armenian', 'Van', 'Diyarbakir', 'film', 'former', 'were', 'inexcusable', 'utterly', 'barbaric', 'way', 'proportion', 'just', 'limited', 'retribution', 'Armenians', 'collusion', 'Russian', 'Tsar', 'empire', 'Just', 'how', 'barbaric', 'purges', 'were', 'film', 'shows', 'terrifying', 'vividness', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'upon', 'later', 'generations', 'Armenians', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'come', 'terms', 'heritage', 'suffering', 'loss']",Ararat
604075,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JLR5,Grady Harp,"[23, 32]","ARARAT is one of the more demanding films by the talented Atom Egoyan and at the same time is one of the more satisfying and literate.  Many viewers have commmented on how confusing the film is in its narrative technique, but it is this intricate maze effect of telling a story that for me is its most powerful quality. Perhaps having recently read Peter Balakian's THE BURNING TIGRIS  added to the experience of the historical aspect of Egoyan's story: the Armenian Genocide by the Turks is profoundly felt by not only Armenians but by all defenders of human rights and at the same time the Turks utterly deny this incident in history.  How genteel of Egoyan to put the whole 'debate' into the form of a movie within a movie.  He has contemporary characters (Raffi, a young man searching for the truth to his past incredibly well portrayed by David Alpay, Ani his mother is an Art Historian played to perfection by Arsinee Khanjian, Christopher Plummer is a Customs Agent who is dealing with his own demons, Elias Koteas is an actor asked to play the role of a Turk in the film being directed by Charles Aznavour and just happens to be the gay lover of Christopher Plummer's son). Egoyan has Raffi photograph the few remaining shrines that stand for the evidence of the existence of his lost people while his mother continues to teach about the artist Arshille Gorky who escaped the genocide to move to New York and become established as an exemplary painter but was only able to erase the memories of the genocide by his own suicide.  Egoyan constantly shifts from the contemporary story to historical re-enactments as they are being shot as scenes for a film.  Yes, there are moments of time warp when as a viewer we are never sure just what is real and what is manufactured on film, but isn't that the main problem with the question of the Armenian Genocide?  With quiet intensity Egoyan places us in the shoes of history, of memory, of personal demons, of ethnic and national demons and in doing so he opens our eyes more powerfuly than an ordinary documentary ever could.Not only is the story superb, but the filming and the acting is absolutley first rate.  While the overall story is about despair and sadness, there are moments of ecstatic joy that come when you least expect them. Some fragments of the story are resolved, some are left for further introspection.

604079,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JLR5,Jeffrey Leach,"[36, 45]","The Armenian genocide constitutes one of the twentieth century's most shameful incidents. Largely forgotten today due to later, better publicized exterminations, the systematic killing of some one million Armenian people by the crumbling Ottoman Empire in 1915 still stirs controversy today. Turkey goes to great lengths to deny such an atrocity ever took place, but Armenian survivors and their descendants know better. The reasons for this event involved Ottoman politics of the time, with the rise of the reformist Young Turk movement within the Ottoman political system and its &quot;promise&quot; about granting autonomy to ethnic and religious minorities. In a case of &quot;meet the new boss, same as the old boss,&quot; the Young Turks soon reneged on their promises and began a series of suppressions. Armenia suffered the most from the Young Turks sudden political reversal. Only with the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire after World War I did the genocide end. President Woodrow Wilson redrew the boundaries of Armenia, a process that angered the Turks and directly led to the current revisionism concerning the massacre. Atom Egoyan's film &quot;Ararat&quot; deals directly, and indirectly, with this horrific historical event.Thanks to an individual who really knows her stuff about film, I decided to pay a visit to Atom Egoyan. &quot;Ararat&quot; was my first choice, and a good one at that even though the film is often confusing--often wonderfully so--in structure. The primary reason for this concerns the numerous storylines weaving their way through the tapestry of the film. We meet, by turns, an Armenian art historian named Ani (played by the gorgeous Arsinee Khanjian), her son Raffi (David Alplay), a customs official named David (Christopher Plummer), two men making a film about the genocide (played by Eric Bogosian and Charles Aznavour), Ani's stepdaughter and David's lover Celia (Marie-Josee Croze) and an up and coming actor in a relationship with David's son named Ali (Elias Koteas). Ani is an art historian working on a project about the famous Armenian painter Arshile Gorky, who was so affected by the loss of his mother in the genocide that he painted a picture of her when he arrived in America. Unable to deal with the memories of the massacre, Gorky ultimately committed suicide. As Ani documents this troubled man's life, she must deal with the highly inappropriate relationship between her son David and her French Canadian stepdaughter Celia. Celia believes Ani drove her father to commit suicide, a claim Ani fervently denies.Meanwhile, we meet customs official David, an embittered soul set to retire from his job in a matter of days. He is angry that his son left his wife in order to form a relationship with an out of work actor of Turkish descent named Ali. Ali receives a phone call from two filmmakers offering him the role of Jevdet Bey, one of the thugs responsible for the Armenian genocide. At roughly the same time, the two filmmakers, one of whom had intimate knowledge of the massacre, approach Ani about consulting on the film. Raffi soon arrives on the scene to work on the picture, and ultimately ends up taking a trip to the area where the massacre took place. On his return, he finds himself held up at customs by--surprise--David, who believes the young man is probably a heroin smuggler. As the film unfolds, most of what we know about the characters comes through flashbacks in an extended conservation between Raffi and David. Egoyan also employs a &quot;film within a film&quot; technique that adds further doubts about the veracity of unfolding events.&quot;Ararat&quot; is a brilliant film, even more so after you have seen it and think through some of the issues presented by Egoyan. I agree with the editorial reviews that state the movie deals with memory and how it affects people through time and across space. Celia's hostility towards Ani marks one aspect of how memory often assumes a slippery dimension, but the real kicker supporting this theme occurs during the lengthy conservations between David and Raffi. The whole dialogue is an effort on the part of Raffi to convince David that the Armenian genocide took place. David is a world-weary cynic unwilling to believe in Raffi's story, but he comes around in the end and ultimately accepts it. Or does he? The last scene where David opens a certain item and sees what is in it encapsulates the entire idea of the film. Should we believe in Raffi's story, especially after we see what David finds? Where is the evidence of the massacre? Is it in the ruins Raffi filmed on his trip and then showed to David? How do we really know these ruins represent the genocide? There are accounts left behind by American missionaries and other Europeans who were there when the events unfolded, but should we trust personal recollections? By forcing us to rely on narrative accounts regarding the massacre and not hard evidence, Egoyan shows us how it is possible for the Turks to deny their involvement in the slaughter.&quot;Ararat&quot; is a challenging film. I don't think this summary resolves any of the movie's numerous issues, but hopefully it will provide the impetus for you to get out and pick up a copy. Even if you have little interest in watching the film for the deeper issues, check it out for the wonderful acting. The scene where Ali challenges Raffi over the reality of the genocide should not be missed by anyone who appreciates powerfully compelling performances. &quot;Ararat&quot; is a brutal film containing recreations of Turkish atrocities, so it is definitely off limits to the kiddies, but it isn't horrific for the sake of sensationalism. This is a film worth watching more than once (and probably necessary to watch more than once in order to understand it).",5,Egoyan is a genius,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,5821,"['Armenian',

604080,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JLR5,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 31]","ARARAT is a sincere attempt on the part of the film's creators to acquaint the audience with the horrors of the genocide delivered by the Turkish government upon its Christian Armenian citizens during the First World War, and which resulted in the deaths of over a million, or about two-thirds of the Armenian population. The screenwriter tried to tell the story in an imaginative way. Unfortunately, the screenplay came out too clever to the point of being a boondoggle, and I came away disappointed and with a headache. Four different timelines and several subplots converge into such a mess that it'll be difficult to write a lucid synopsis.Gosh, where to begin?In several brief flashbacks, it's 1931 and Armenian artist Arshile Gorky (Simon Abkarian), having emigrated to North America, is shown painting a portrait based on a photograph of him and his mother taken in Turkish Armenia in 1912. Gorky's mother was subsequently killed in the genocide, and her memory haunts him deeply.In the recent past, art historian Ani (Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian), an Armenian living in Toronto, gives lectures on the life of Arshile Gorky and uses his painting of 1931 as a backdrop for her presentations . Ani is also a collaborator with film director Edward (Charles Aznavour) in the making of a film, also called ARARAT, about the Turkish army's seige and capture of the Turkish Armenian city of Van in 1915 based on the memoirs of an American missionary, Clarence Ussher (Bruce Greenwood), stationed there. The inhabitants are subsequently burned alive, mutilated or tortured, or driven out into the desert where most are raped, bayoneted or shot. A young Gorky (Garen Boyajian) is one of the survivors. The 1915 timeline, and the events surrounding the Van abomination, are depicted in the scenes of the film within the film, ARARAT within ARARAT.The last and most recent timeline has Ani's young, adult son Raffi (David Alpay) returning to Canada after spending time in Turkey filming footage of Van's ruins that could be used in the making of Edward's ARARAT. On his way through Customs, he's stopped by David (Christopher Plummer), a humorless inspector spending his last day on the job before retirement. In an extended sequence that apparently lasts hours, David interrogates Raffi about the contents of several film cans (of supposedly exposed film). David suspects they contain heroin, but listens to Raffi's earnest explanation of the ARARAT film and the events that inspired it because the young man is obviously a True Believer.There's another subplot, which occurs before Raffi takes off to Turkey, involving Ani, Raffi, and the former's stepdaughter Celia (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze). Raffi is sleeping with Celia despite the fact that the latter believes Ani drove her second husband (Celia's father) to suicide. The relationship between Ani and Celia is decidedly not warm and fuzzy, and Raffi is caught in the middle. Raffi's own father, Ani's first husband, was an Armenian ""freedom fighter"" killed while trying to assassinate a Turkish official.Have I lost you yet?Perhaps director/producer/writer Atom Egoyan got so wrapped up in the artistic aspects of his creation that he lost his way amidst unnecessary complexity and simply blundered into his original goal, which was to produce a film that indeed thrusts the Armenian Genocide into the viewer's consciousness (and will perhaps throw gasoline on the smoldering embers of hatred of those who'd prefer not to forget past tribal vendettas). The David/Raffi and Ani/Celia interactions might better have been left on the cutting room floor and the old adage, ""keep it simple"", taken to heart. Certainly, truly great and memorable films about the bloody and savage business of ethnic cleansing can be made. SCHINDLER'S LIST comes immediately to mind.

I loved the movie; I thought that it was intricate, had great characters which were subtle and well written, and flowed from the past to the present beautifully. My friend could not forgive the ""movie about making a movie"" plot; he thought it was just too cheesy and it ruined the whole experience for him.There are some heated reviews of this movie based on it's subject--did it really happen? did it really happen as Egoyan portrayed it? are people using the term ""Holocaust"" and ""genocide"" injudiciously?For me, when I think of this movie, I think of the conversation between me and my friend. Just as a movie, regardless of Armenian ""experience"", this is still a great movie.What I loved about it was the personal relationships outside of the broader scope of historical events-- a young man trying to navigate between his relationship with his mother and his girlfriend, a father coming to terms with his gay son, an actor trying to portray something larger than himself, and all the characters trying to come to terms with an event from which they are all far removed. For me this movie is about a historical event (subject to much debate) _AND_ the inter-twining lives of people who otherwise would never have met.In response to my sullen and disappointed friend: I thought the ""movie about making a movie"" plot was brilliant because you never know what you are watching--the ""truth"" about what really happened, or the ""movie"" the characters are making about what happened or what they want people to *think* happened.Now, one could make an argument that it's impossible for me to disregard the controversial ""subject"" of the movie and just see an inter-play between characters, and for those of you who think that . . . well, that's what I enjoyed about this movie.PS: I thought the speacial features on the DVD were kind of lame and didn't match my emotional experience watching the movie.

The customs officer (Christopher Plummer) begins a long and tedious interrogation in regards to the tin containers, which has it roots in a 1915-1918 genocide of Turkish Armenians.  The story that the young man reveals is tied to him, his fathers death 15 years ago, stepfather's death, a film director, a film production, his step sister, his mother, a gay couple, a famous painter, and how the Armenian holocaust affects them in today's society.  The cross-examination also brings a symbolic meaning to whether the 1915-1918 genocide of Turkish Armenians, which is still denied to this day by the Turkish government, ever took place.  Egoyan brings another cerebral story to the audience as he displays his vast knowledge of human behavior and the denial people deal with under unpleasant circumstances.

604084,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JLR5,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 9]","The Canadian writer/director, Atom Egayan, is of Armenian heritage, and his 2002 film tries to be an historical account of the murder of one million Armenians by Turkey in 1915.  This is a controversial issue because the Turkish government still insists that it never happened.  The film itself leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  And delves much deeper than mere historical events.  The general plot is about a film being made about the atrocities, and the interrelationships between everyone concerned with it.  The director combines various time periods, levels of reality, family relationships and questions about historical accuracy.  The acting is uniformly excellent. But the film is so confusing that somehow something gets lost.I found it almost impossible to follow the plot and kept replaying parts of the DVD to make sure I understood what was going on.  Basically, it centers around a young man, Raffi, played by David Alpay, whose father was slain while trying to assassinate a Turkish official during a visit to Canada.  His mother, played by Arsinee Khangian, is an art historian of Armenian heritage and there are lots of comparisons of their relationship with that of the Armenian artist, Arshile Gorky whose mother was murdered in the slaughter.  Add to this mix an aging customs inspector, played by Christopher Plummer, who attempts to determine if Raffi is smuggling drugs and who just happens to have a troubled relationship with is own son whose lover played a Turkish officer in the film.  And then there is Raffi's stepsister, with whom Raffi is having a romantic relationship, whose father committed suicide after a brief marriage to Raffi's mother. Confusing?  Well, yes it is.And yet this is a film with a lot to say.  It's about genocide.  It's about complex family relationships.  It is about the search for truth.  And, mostly, it is about the many personal decisions that have to be made about what reality is.  I was intrigued and fascinated throughout.  And saddened and horrified by the violence.  And yet, because I was constantly confused by what was going on and trying to follow the plot, I never really got swept away with the story in a way that made me feel emotion.  I recommend this film to those interested in history and also for those interested in the work of a brilliant director.  However, I think most people will find the storyline just too confusing to get the dramatic impact of the theme.",4,Great theme.  Fine acting.

To fully understand and appreciate the pure brilliance of this film, one must look beneath the surface. There is so much detail, so much depth and so much beauty underneath the very important and very moving storyline. The film is extremely crucial for the Armenian people and depicts the events of the Armenian Genocide through a film-within-a-film which connects all the characters and events. This, in my opinion, was a wonderful way to tell the tragic story of the Armenian Genocide. Egoyan got his point across with minimal, if any, propaganda.

604086,A13U4RT7VHFD18,B00005JLR5,"M. Colford ""chlotrudis""","[19, 23]","I had no idea what to expect with Atom Egoyan's new film ARARAT. It has received many negative reviews and scant few good ones. As a big Egoyan fan, I was worried. Would this be the first of his films that I wouldn't enjoy? And the subject, the Armenian Genocide... I just couldn't imagine what Egoyan would attempt that put off so many people. Needless to say, I was completely surprised at how amazing this film is.ARARAT is not a film about the Armenian genocide. It is a film about truth and history. About how sometimes the way we tell a story is more important than the story itself. He uses the Armenian genocide as the backdrop... the subtext... There's a film within the film that IS in fact about the Armenian genocide. I think the people who didn't like Egoyan's film were looking for something more akin to the film within the film. I was much more interested in the film Egoyan chose to make.In this film, Charles Aznavour plays a well-known director who is making a film about the Armenian genocide. His style is very over-the-top, with a strong Hollywood epic feel to it. After hearing a lecture by Ani (Arsin&eacute;e Khanjian), an art history scholar who has recently written a book about a famous Armenian artist who survived the genocide, he and his writer (Eric Bogosian) decide to enlist her help on the movie as a historic consultant, in order to provide accurate details on the film even as they stretch the truth even further to make a dramatic story. Ani's son Raffi is also hired as a production assistant on the film in the hopes that he will come to better understand what happened between the Armenians and Turks and why. Raffi's father was killed in a failed attempt to assassinate a Turkish diplomat 15 years ago. Raffi also has a step-sister, who was the daughter of Ani's first husband. She blames Ani for her father's death (murder? suicide?) and continually appears at Ani's book readings asking disturbing questions linking the subject of her book (who also committed suicide) with her first husband. And there's even more...There were so many things I admired in this complex, ambitious film. I love the way Egoyan jumps around in time and doesn't really give you any clues... you just have to sit back and figure it out. The film within the film... the one actually about the Armenian Genocide... is stilted and overblown, much like most big Hollywood productions, but not without the horror and tragedy inherent in situation. There are some amazing scenes in ARARAT, especially the ones where Egoyan tries to find an understanding in the Turks point of view regarding the genocide and their inability to accept it. And amazing performances as well. Charles Aznavour is terrific as the director. Christopher Plummer is superb in a quiet performance as an airport customs officer who interviews Raffi on his return to Toronto after a trip to Turkey. And how delightful to see Arsin&eacute;e in such a large, dramatic part. She really shines in this difficult role. David Alpay is fairly strong in the tricky role of Raffi, especially in his dramatic scenes with Christopher Plummer.One of the many criticisms I've read about ARARAT is how the dialogue is so expository. I didn't find it so at all. One of the points of the film is how the story of the Armenian genocide has been lost, and that people don't talk about it. There's a lot of explanation on what happened in that period of history told through dialogue, which is as it should be in this film. After all, it's NOT a film about the genocide itself, but who it has been dealth with. Plummer's David, when trying to determine if Raffi is smuggling drugs explains that while it's true, trained dogs could easily sniff out the drugs, he prefers his method of talking to the suspect to find out the truth through dialogue. It's a powerful moment, especially in retrospect when the entire film is revealed.ARARAT is complex, ambitious, thought-provoking, and masterful. I was so delighted by it after expecting something very different.",5,ARARAT is a complex and ambitious work,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,4028,"['had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'new', 'film', 'ARARAT', 'received', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'scant', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'big', 'Egoyan', 'fan', 'was', 'worried', 'Would', 'be', 'first', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'subject', 'Armenian', 'Genocide', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'Egoyan', 'would', 'attempt', 'put', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'how', 'amazing', 'film', 'is.ARARAT', 'not', 'film', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'film', 'truth', 'history', 'how', 'sometimes', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'backdrop', 'subtext', 'film', 'film', 'fact', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'Egoyan', 'film', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'film', 'Egoyan', 'chose', 'make.In', 'film', 'Charles', 'Aznavour', 'well-known', 'director', 'who', 'making', 'film', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'style', 'very', 'over-the-top', 'strong', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'feel', 'hearing', 'lecture', 'Ani', 'Arsin', 'eacute', 'Khanjian', 'art', 'history', 'scholar', 'who', 'recently', 'written', 'book', 'famous', 'Armenian', 'artist', 'who', 'survived', 'genocide', 'writer', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'decide', 'enlist', 'help', 'movie', 'historic', 'consultant', 'order', 'provide', 'accurate', 'details', 'film', 'even', 'stretch', 'truth', 'even', 'further', 'make', 'dramatic', 'story', 'Ani', 'son', 'Raffi', 'also', 'hired', 'production', 'assistant', 'film', 'hopes', 'will', 'come', 'better', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'Armenians', 'Turks', 'why', 'Raffi', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'failed', 'attempt', 'assassinate', 'Turkish', 'diplomat', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'Raffi', 'also', 'step-sister', 'who', 'was', 'daughter', 'Ani', 'first', 'husband', 'Ani', 'father', 'death', 'murder', 'suicide', 'continually', 'Ani', 'book', 'readings', 'asking', 'disturbing', 'questions', 'linking', 'subject', 'book', 'who', 'also', 'committed', 'suicide', 'first', 'husband', 'even', 'more', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'admired', 'complex', 'ambitious', 'film', 'love', 'way', 'Egoyan', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'clues', 'just', 'have', 'sit', 'back', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'actually', 'Armenian', 'Genocide', 'stilted', 'overblown', 'much', 'most', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'not', 'horror', 'tragedy', 'inherent', 'situation', 'are', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'ARARAT', 'especially', 'ones', 'where', 'Egoyan', 'find', 'understanding', 'Turks', 'point', 'view', 'regarding', 'genocide', 'inability', 'accept', 'amazing', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Charles', 'Aznavour', 'terrific', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'superb', 'quiet', 'performance', 'airport', 'customs', 'officer', 'who', 'Raffi', 'return', 'Toronto', 'trip', 'Turkey', 'how', 'delightful', 'see', 'Arsin', 'eacute', 'such', 'large', 'dramatic', 'part', 'really', 'difficult', 'role', 'David', 'Alpay', 'fairly', 'strong', 'tricky', 'role', 'Raffi', 'especially', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Christopher', 'Plummer.One', 'many', 'criticisms', ""'ve"", 'read', 'ARARAT', 'how', 'dialogue', 'so', 'expository', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'One', 'points', 'film', 'how', 'story', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'been', 'lost', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'lot', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'period', 'history', 'told', 'dialogue', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'NOT', 'film', 'genocide', 'who', 'been', 'dealth', 'Plummer', 'David', 'when', 'trying', 'determine', 'Raffi', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'true', 'trained', 'dogs', 'could', 'easily', 'sniff', 'out', 'drugs', 'method', 'talking', 'suspect', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'dialogue', 'powerful', 'moment', 'especially', 'retrospect', 'when', 'entire', 'film', 'revealed.ARARAT', 'complex', 'ambitious', 'thought-provoking', 'masterful', 'was', 'so', 'delighted', 'expecting', 'something', 'very', 'different']",Ararat

If he had only made the elegant and stunning ""The Sweet Hereafter"" his place among the pantheon of directors would be assured. So what happened with ""Ararat?""In a nutshell, ""Ararat"" is too complicated; filled with too many sub-plots and extraneous material not central to the plot. It's as if Agoyan, in his need to set the record straight about the Armenian Genocide says too much.  The problem with all of this is that it takes away from the dramatic core of the movie: ""Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.""The Armenian Genocide by the Turks at the beginning of the 20th. Century is innately rife with sorrow, pathos and human despair but Atom Egoyan would have better served his people and his subject had he made a simple, straightforward dramatic film based on Clarence Ussher's Diaries, an American doctor and an eye-witness.Several story elements do work, though: the story of Arshile Gorky and his mother become a touchstone for the entire film: it's emotional center. Also, Raffi's (David Alpay) plot line with the customs official (Christopher Plummer) though realistically implausible is nonetheless dramatically true.  Some of the performances are also first rate: David Alpay, Christopher Plummer and Charles Aznavour as the director of the film-within-a-film.As in most of Egoyan's films, events and how they are recalled and thereby inevitably interpreted by a group of people is at the core of ""Ararat."": Recollection as a way of eventually getting at the truth of a thing.For the most part, ""Ararat"" is well thought out and humane and it definitely brings to the forefront a piece of history many of us know nothing about. But ultimately ""Ararat"" does not carry it's grim burden well: telling the horrific story of the decimation of a people; a story too long hidden away in the history books (if there at all) of these heroic Armenians many of whom survive today and remain irrevocably scarred by it.",3,The Innocents,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,2023,"['Atom', 'Egoyan', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'directors', 'making', 'movies', 'today', 'reproach', 'had', 'only', 'made', 'elegant', 'stunning', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'place', 'pantheon', 'directors', 'would', 'be', 'assured', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'Ararat', 'nutshell', 'Ararat', 'too', 'complicated', 'filled', 'too', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'extraneous', 'material', 'not', 'central', 'plot', 'Agoyan', 'need', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'Armenian', 'Genocide', 'too', 'much', 'problem', 'away', 'dramatic', 'core', 'movie', 'who', 'forget', 'history', 'are', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'Armenian', 'Genocide', 'Turks', 'beginning', '20th', 'Century', 'innately', 'rife', 'sorrow', 'pathos', 'human', 'despair', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'served', 'people', 'subject', 'had', 'made', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'dramatic', 'film', 'based', 'Clarence', 'Ussher', 'Diaries', 'American', 'doctor', 'eye-witness.Several', 'story', 'elements', 'do', 'work', 'story', 'Arshile', 'Gorky', 'mother', 'become', 'touchstone', 'entire', 'film', 'emotional', 'center', 'Also', 'Raffi', 'David', 'Alpay', 'plot', 'line', 'customs', 'official', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'realistically', 'implausible', 'nonetheless', 'dramatically', 'true', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'first', 'rate', 'David', 'Alpay', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Charles', 'Aznavour', 'director', 'film-within-a-film.As', 'most', 'Egoyan', 'films', 'events', 'how', 'are', 'recalled', 'thereby', 'inevitably', 'interpreted', 'group', 'people', 'core', 'Ararat', 'Recollection', 'way', 'eventually', 'getting', 'truth', 'thing.For', 'most', 'part', 'Ararat', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'humane', 'definitely', 'forefront', 'piece', 'history', 'many', 'know', 'nothing', 'ultimately', 'Ararat', 'not', 'carry', 'grim', 'burden', 'well', 'telling', 'horrific', 'story', 'decimation', 'people', 'story', 'too', 'long', 'hidden', 'away', 'history', 'books', 'heroic', 'Armenians', 'many', 'whom', 'survive', 'today', 'remain', 'irrevocably', 'scarred']",Ararat

It is like trying to have a conversation with someone on speed.The first 15 minutes play out like an art film, leaving you aching to turn off the remote.

604090,A1MSARPH08VX3I,B00005JLR5,Pharoah S. Wail,"[15, 33]","There's really no other way for me to say this. This movie really disappointed me. Obviously the intent was to bring some attention to this horrible moment in time that has been largely forgotten (or never known of) by people who were not directly affected by it. That is why I rented this movie. I've read a few books on the topic, and Armenian musics are some of the world's best, but this movie is a clunker.There is too much garbage going on. I don't mean that it is hard to follow, because it isn't at all. It's just that 75% of what's happening is trite, as well as extraneous to anything having to do with the genocide itself. There is more than enough tear-jerking ""human drama"" potential within the stories of the genocide itself, so why is so much of the movie wasted on trying to unravel this insipid love-gone-bad tangent among Raffi's mom, her dead ex-husband, and Raffi's step-sister (Daughter of dead ex-husband. She's also Raffi's girlfriend)? The step-sister is a waste of space whom you can't even begin to care about. All she does is whine about her dead father, who had absolutely nothing to do with any storyline related to the genocide.Then there is the actor playing Raffi. His scenes in customs with Christopher Plummer are painful. He has no emotional power whatsoever. He will relate some horrendous story of the genocide, and then try to ""sell it"" to us by doing his Tom Cruise jaw-muscle flex thing and pretending to be haunted, as he longingly looks into Plummer's eyes. It's horrible. I think only Bokeem Woodbine or Keanu Reeves could have given worse performances here.Oh did I mention that Christopher Plummer's son is gay and he (dad) is having trouble coming to terms with it. Oh did I mention that Plummer's gay son is dating Elias Koteas who just happens to also be a Turkish colonel or something in the ""movie within a movie"" about the genocide, yet he (Elias' ""real life movie character"", rather than his ""movie in a movie"" character) doesn't think the genocide ever actually happened because all he read about were some deportations as well as the standard ravages of war?If at this point you're thinking my review is annoying in its mention of all this drivel that has nothing to do with the actual genocide, well, you now have a good picture of exactly what this movie is like. It's as if the director pitched this idea to a studio and the studio said yeah we can do a movie on this topic... as long as it's in the background since we need to add in a love triangle, a step-sister's bare breasts, the strained relationship of a father and his gay son, a boring filmmaker who gives his all to make sure a customs official knows the story of the genocide as they wonder whether or not there is heroin in his film canisters, etc...Woops did I mention a fictionalized story of Arshile Gorky? It's here, too!Knowing the story of this atrocity, I fully expected there to be no way I'd get through this movie without breaking down in tears. For me, the Armenian Genocide is one of those events along the lines of Rwanda 1994, or Sudan of the past couple decades, etc... Horrible events that are almost worse (not that that's possible) just for the simple fact that almost no one seems to care, notice, or remember, simply because there seems to be no political or economic gain in caring.The one great performance in this movie is given by Elias Koteas. Not so much during the ""movie within a movie"" scenes (as it's obvious that movie was going to be worse than Ararat), but during the ""now"" parts of this movie, where he is the gay Turkish actor who doesn't believe the genocide happened. Elias completely inhabits the role of the apathetic, uneducated ""Hey just get over it!"" persona that is so widespread both here in the USA and elsewhere in the world in relation to other atrocities. Thank you Elias! Yes your character was a quiet jerk, but you played him perfectly... easily the most powerful performance of the film. I just feel bad for you that you were stuck having to give this performance in a movie as bad as this.This event deserves better. I hope someone else makes a movie on this topic someday.

Instead Atom Egoyan makes us confront history as imperfect, frustrating and necessary.As with all Egoyan film, narration is never taken for granted and we follow several interconnected stories including that of a film-maker producing a straightforward film of Armenian genocide, another of a young man who is interrogated by Canadian immigration, a reflection on the life of Amil Gorky, the great Armenian artist as its retold by a historian who in turn is stalked by a step-daughter who holds the historian responsible for her own father's death.While grief and loss are often on display in Egoyan's film, those feelings are typically mediated by his presentation of powerful ideas and oblique storytelling.  In Ararat, the grief and loss aren't as mediated.  Egoyan is part Armenian and the story he tells is personal and heartfelt.  That feeling comes through on film and yet it doesn't slop over into easy sentiment or self righteousness.

604092,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00005JLR5,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 2]","This was by no means ambitious film by Atom Egoyan.  By addressing complex relationship of a contemporary family between a mother, her son from her first marriage to an Armenian terrorist/freedom fighter (depending on who is talking about the poor lad); her stepdaughter who happens to be her son's lover as well as her deceased husband's daughter from previous relationship, we get to learn about Armenia's history, it's people, art and region.  One of the main points of the movie is to address year 1915 genocide of the Armenian nation by Turks what neither Turks nor the rest of the world have ever fully acknowledged perhaps due to the fact that everyone was busy fighting the WWI.  On pretense of making a historical film about the event, we witness the usual: brutality, muder, rape.  But underneath it all is a story about family and complex emotions that bind any family together.  Choices that we make, affect our families.  The ones that feel consquences of these choices the most are the children.  It seems that for those children it is unbearable that they are unable to control events around them and stop the loss of the people they innately love.  As their parents perish in war, sacrifice themselves for ideals over their family, or seemingly commit suicide over life's disappointments - their children turn to most self-destructive ways or feeling of being alive.  They choose their own path that often is a path of death which puts them closer to their lost parents they still love and miss terribly.  But their death is a slow one and it is thru pain and hurt that they come to the light and get to enjoy the life around them.  As I said in the beginning, it is overly ambitious movie but a nice tribute to a nation, human self sacrifice and love that binds us all at the end.",3,Story of the Armenian nation,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1797,"['was', 'means', 'ambitious', 'film', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'addressing', 'complex', 'relationship', 'contemporary', 'family', 'mother', 'son', 'first', 'marriage', 'Armenian', 'terrorist/freedom', 'fighter', 'depending', 'who', 'talking', 'poor', 'lad', 'stepdaughter', 'who', 'be', 'son', 'lover', 'as', 'well', 'deceased', 'husband', 'daughter', 'previous', 'relationship', 'get', 'learn', 'Armenia', 'history', 'people', 'art', 'region', 'One', 'main', 'points', 'movie', 'address', 'year', '1915', 'genocide', 'Armenian', 'nation', 'Turks', 'what', 'Turks', 'rest', 'world', 'have', 'ever', 'fully', 'acknowledged', 'perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'everyone', 'was', 'busy', 'fighting', 'WWI', 'pretense', 'making', 'historical', 'film', 'event', 'witness', 'usual', 'brutality', 'muder', 'rape', 'story', 'family', 'complex', 'emotions', 'bind', 'family', 'together', 'Choices', 'make', 'affect', 'families', 'ones', 'feel', 'consquences', 'choices', 'most', 'are', 'children', 'children', 'unbearable', 'are', 'unable', 'control', 'events', 'stop', 'loss', 'people', 'innately', 'love', 'parents', 'perish', 'war', 'sacrifice', 'ideals', 'family', 'seemingly', 'commit', 'suicide', 'life', 'disappointments', 'children', 'turn', 'most', 'self-destructive', 'ways', 'feeling', 'being', 'alive', 'choose', 'own', 'path', 'often', 'path', 'death', 'closer', 'lost', 'parents', 'still', 'love', 'miss', 'terribly', 'death', 'slow', 'one', 'thru', 'pain', 'hurt', 'come', 'light', 'get', 'enjoy', 'life', 'said', 'beginning', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'nice', 'tribute', 'nation', 'human', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'love', 'end']",Ararat
604093,AZVTZVW7RJX48,B00005JLR5,"RHC ""TemporaryOne-1""","[0, 1]","First, thank you 2007-2008 Men's World Figure Skating Champion Jeffrey Buttle for skating to the score of Ararat this recently completed skating season.This was the only Egoyan film I had not yet watched, for several reasons, but when I watched one of your first Grand Prix skating long programmes this past season, I was so enthralled by the score, I considered watching the film. After your breathtaking Worlds programme, I was finally inspired to watch the film, and purchased it.This film would have been more effective if the director presented the Armenian sequences as genuinely crafted extensive historical flashbacks (to show the extent of the massacres) with enhanced context and cinematography and acting performances, and provided more cohesive continuity, instead of using clich&eacute;d soundstage re-enactments discordantly interpolated throughout the underdeveloped and choppy present-day plotline.I understand that Egoyan was trying to use an innovative method to capture and maintain the audience's attention - threading together a summarized record of the history of the Armenians and their massacre with poignant depictions of present-day ""diaspora"" Armenians in Canada struggling with identity, cultural, and ethnic crises, but, because of the gravity of the topic, he should have scaled back the innovation and instead focused on cinematically illustrating in enhanced historical detail Armenian history and the massacre, and broadened the overall acting performances by providing depth to the characters.What Egoyan does demonstrate, either intentionally or intentionally, is that the self-victimization of the Armenian characters, and their explicit, unhindered, relentless focus on the Armenian massacre, impeded their ability to not only understand each other and their own individual crises, but their ability to reconcile with each other to preserve and defend and promote their culture and language (which they did retain) and traditions and history, to preserve and defend and promote their national identity and roots.The Armenian characters, not even the mom and Saroyan the film director, did not realize their acculturation to the country they were living in (which happened to be Canada) dramatically minimized and virtually muted their ethnic connection to Turkey/Armenia.They were so intent on trying to publically prove the specific event of the massacre - which they failed to do because Egoyan only presented one instance of killings that occurred during the siege of the city of Van - that they forgot about presenting Armenia's historology and culture and achievements, and, when Elias Koteas tried to discuss the historical context of the massacre, and Saroyan immediately dismissed him, Saroyan's reaction and unjustified explanation for the reaction negated the gravity and credibility of the massacre itself, and discredited the overall self-victimization of the Armenian characters.We have a group of people who were massively decimated, and that type of mass carnage is obviously horrific, but what must we automatically sympathize with the descendants of the massacred ancestors who were born and raised in a completey different geopolitical location? What if the ancestors were ""illegally occupying"" Turkey? What if they were an indigenous group of people with draconian traditions whom were actively revolting against the Turkish powers? What if they were the progenitors of Turks and the first occupants of the land who had been systematically killed because they refused assimilation? And for those of us already familiar with Armenian history, what if the armed Armenian nationalist groups (Hunchaks, Dashnaks, etc) and the Armenian populace were plotting to join forces with the Russian Czar's Christian army to seize Anatolia and the Caucasus in order to re-establish ancient Anatolia, which led to Turkey countering the nationalistic forces in order to prevent another war front in the Ottoman Empire?Massacre or no Massacre, the Armenians in the film had zero interest in learning about the cultural backdrop of their own ancestry (not even Rafi, he only wanted to validate his mother's stories because the thought of his mother as a liar was clearly more upsetting to him than any massacre), nor did they have any remote interest in celebrating and preserving their heritage or achievements, except to promote a painting and an autobiography that proved a massacre. Their sole interest was to pretend to be victims - despite being born and raised in Canada and acculturated in a Western lifestyle - and dismiss any attempts at examining their historical background and observing cultural traditions.The film depicts ""diaspora"" Armenians as a culture firmly fixated on a massacre and firmly alienated from Armenian culture (past and present).The cultural reference to the pomegranate was an astronomic miscalculation and indication that Egoyan himself is oblivious to history: the pomegranate, contrary to Armenian belief, first emerged as a fruit and as a cultural and culinary symbol in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and India, then spread as a cultural and culinary symbol throughout the entire Middle East, and Asia, Eurasia, Greece, Spain, Mexico, and beyond.The symbolic meaning of the pomegranate was clear - pomegranates only grow in dry conditions, the Armenians only feel and grow and ""progress"" when they are void of and ignore their own history and culture (except language), pomegranates root and decay in wet conditions, the Armenians mentally decay when floods of critical questions and doubts and history in its full context inundate them.Returning to the diaspora concept, none of the Armenians, except Rafi, exhibited any tangible desire to visit Turkey/Armenia, nor did they view their ethnic land as a desirable location to return to, an actual ancestral land where they could unite and rebuild their culture and nation. None of them, except the enigmatic non-Armenian David (Christopher Plummer) exhibited any reticence or discontent with being acculturated into Canadian/Western culture, none of them appeared to feel alienated or insulated from their own ethnic roots, not even the girlfriend, who was strictly frustrated because of Ani's trivialization and dismissal of her father's (and Ani's second husband's) death.Nothing the Armenians did indicated they wanted a restoration of their original homeland and nation, that they vicariously related to their ancestral homeland, they engaged in any kind of ethnocummunal solidarity, and that meant the Armenians were not ""diaspora"" because diaspora indicates a nation scattered from an ancestral homeland that desires to re-unite and return to the homeland.And, strangely, nothing the characters presented conclusively proved a ""genocide"" or even massacre occurred.Egoyan's presentation of the film's strongest theme - memory versus facts versus the fabricated realities people con themselves into believing to make their lives bearable - indicated the massacre itself either never occurred or was exaggerated.I had the impression that since they were ashamed that their ancestors were unable to defend themselves against violence they themselves possibly instigated, they were exaggerating the circumstances of their deaths to transform the shame and embarrassment and guilt into justifiable scapegoatable anger towards the Turks.Egoyan ignored the historical fact that during the early 1900's the Turks and other Muslims were also being raped and massacred and expelled from their homes and entire villages and cities by the Russians and Britain and France. The Russians laid inhumane waste and destruction to Anatolia, which resulted in raging starvation and epidemics that killed Turks, in addition to Armenians.He also ignored the historical fact that Armenians fought side by side with the Ottomans and were serving in the Ottoman government, and that the Ottomans never killed Armenians in Istanbul, Izmir, or Aleppo.And while the Armenian tragedy was real and horrific, Egoyan ignored the fact that other national groups suffered massive killings at that time, many of which were at a larger scale then the Armenian killings, thus negating the use of the intellectually dishonest and distorted and revisionist use of the term ""genocide"".During WWI, 1,500,000 Armenians were killed, 1,700,000 Russians were killed, 1,327,000 French people were killed, 1,100,000 Austrian-Hungarians were killed, 908,371 British people were killed, 460,000 Italians were killed, etc, etc.Saroyan asserts massive genocidal systematic killings occurred based on one eyewitness account, and Rafi's mom insists the killings occurred based on one painter's childhood, and both accounts are repudiated by Egoyan when he has Saroyan refuse to discuss the historical backdrop of Turkey in 1915, when he has Rafi's mother continuously exaggerate the painter's feelings and insist her husband was a hero and insist on dismissing the death of her second-husband out of guilt because she admittedly caused him to commit suicide (which correlates to Armenians feeling guilt about possibly instigating violence against themselves and being unable to defend themselves), when Egoyan has David (Plummer, in an Oscar-deserving performance) violate criminal laws by releasing Rafi despite the heroin in the film reel, when he has Rafi construct his lie to David in order to subconsciously reveal his version of the truth, and when he has Saroyan's film partner place Mount Ararat close to the city of Van which is geographically incorrect.The sum total of which Egoyan directly illustrates to us that truth is subjective and virtually unknowable, which ironically means that, according to Egoyan's own thematic logic, it is unknowable whether or not an Armenian massacre occurred.This film can either be a 5/10 for its face value (lackluster everything, linear acting, only Plummer was intensely impressionable and effective) or a 10/10 for its fathomless subtextual, hermeneutical, semiotic value.",5,600 Ancient Seeds Of Imperfection,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,9999,"['First', 'thank', '2007-2008', 'Men', 'World', 'Figure', 'Skating', 'Champion',

604095,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLR5,Roland E. Zwick,"[18, 27]","In 1915, right in the midst of World War I when the eyes of the world were focused on other corners of the planet, the Turks slaughtered over a million of their own Armenian citizens in a holocaust that the Turks to this day deny ever happened.  Atom Egoyan's complex, though not entirely successful film, ""Ararat,"" attempts to show just how long a shadow this horrific genocide still casts over the Armenian people today.Rather than simply make a film set at the time of the genocide, Egoyan has chosen to set his film in the present and have his vast assortment of characters reflect on what this almost century-old event means to them in their present lives (most of them are second generation Armenians and Turks living in Canada).  One of those characters is an aged film director who, in honor of his mother who endured the atrocities, has come to Canada to make a film about the event.  Thus, all the glimpses we get of the actual genocide are film-within-a-film reenactments.  In a bit of irony, Egoyan shows just how difficult it is for any work of art to faithfully capture the ""truth"" of such an event, for falsehoods inevitably creep into the picture the moment the artist alters even minor facts under the guise of ""artistic license.""  This is particularly ironic given the fact that ""truth"" and ""facts"" are such an important part of the case the Armenians have built against the Turks.  The film deals head-on with what is ""truth"" and how much of history comes down to a matter of personal perception.Egoyan has provided a veritable labyrinth of characters and events, so much so that it becomes almost impossible to provide anything near a comprehensive summary of either the plot or the people who are caught in its entanglements and complexities.  Suffice it to say that the film deals with such weighty themes as the intricacies of mother/child relationships, coming to terms with the ghosts from both the private and collective past, and the part denial plays in assuaging our own sense of guilt and responsibility for unspeakable events in history.  This denial then allows us to live our lives in unconcerned complacency.Egoyan views his film almost as a giant canvas and he keeps throwing characters onto it, often without painting the strokes in clear enough detail for us to understand fully what is going on (an apt analogy, given the fact that one of the characters is an actual painter and he deliberately leaves part of his artwork unfinished).  Some of the people we meet are fascinating and complex, while others seem underdeveloped and too enigmatic to make much of a contribution to our comprehension of the material.  Occasionally, we get the nagging impression that a number of the minor characters and plot strands are left hanging in a state of unresolved limbo.  Moreover, the film occasionally lapses into a pedantic tone, as if the writer felt it more important to provide us with a history lesson than involve us in a drama.  What promises to be an enlightening character study frequently becomes a polemic.Structurally, ""Ararat"" is very complex, with the director cutting back and forth between characters in the present, one character in the past, and the events of the genocide as depicted in the film being made.  Egoyan deserves credit for bringing it all together even if the very artifice of the format ends up distancing the audience from the emotional immediacy of this very grim subject matter.  ""Ararat"" is more of an intellectual exercise than an emotionally involving drama, but it does serve a salutary purpose in raising the public's consciousness about a shameful, tragic moment in history that has for too long gone unrecognized by the general public.",3,important but flawed view of an ethnic tragedy,1059004800,"07 24, 2003",2003,3708,"['1915', 'right', 'midst', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'eyes', 'world', 'were', 'focused', 'other', 'corners', 'planet', 'Turks', 'slaughtered', 'over', 'million', 'own', 'Armenian', 'citizens', 'holocaust', 'Turks', 'day', 'deny', 'ever', 'happened', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'complex', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'film', 'Ararat', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'long', 'shadow', 'horrific', 'genocide', 'still', 'Armenian', 'people', 'today.Rather', 'simply', 'make', 'film', 'set', 'time', 'genocide', 'Egoyan', 'chosen', 'set', 'film', 'present', 'have', 'vast', 'assortment', 'characters', 'reflect', 'what', 'almost', 'century-old', 'event', 'present', 'lives', 'most', 'are', 'second', 'generation', 'Armenians', 'Turks', 'living', 'Canada', 'One', 'characters', 'aged', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'honor', 'mother', 'who', 'endured', 'atrocities', 'come', 'Canada', 'make', 'film', 'event', 'Thus', 'glimpses', 'get', 'actual', 'genocide', 'are', 'film-within-a-film', 'reenactments', 'bit', 'irony', 'Egoyan', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'work', 'art', 'faithfully', 'capture', 'truth', 'event', 'falsehoods', 'inevitably', 'creep', 'picture', 'moment', 'artist', 'alters', 'even', 'minor', 'facts', 'guise', 'artistic', 'license', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'given', 'fact', 'truth', 'facts', 'are', 'important', 'part', 'case', 'Armenians', 'have', 'built', 'Turks', 'film', 'deals', 'head-on', 'what', 'truth', 'how', 'much', 'history', 'down', 'matter', 'personal', 'perception.Egoyan', 'provided', 'veritable', 'labyrinth', 'characters', 'events', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'impossible', 'provide', 'anything', 'comprehensive', 'summary', 'plot', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'entanglements', 'complexities', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'deals', 'such', 'weighty', 'themes', 'intricacies', 'mother/child', 'relationships', 'coming', 'terms', 'ghosts', 'private', 'collective', 'past', 'part', 'denial', 'plays', 'assuaging', 'own', 'sense', 'guilt', 'responsibility', 'unspeakable', 'events', 'history', 'denial', 'then', 'live', 'lives', 'unconcerned', 'complacency.Egoyan', 'views', 'film', 'almost', 'giant', 'canvas', 'throwing', 'characters', 'often', 'painting', 'strokes', 'clear', 'enough', 'detail', 'understand', 'fully', 'what', 'going', 'apt', 'analogy', 'given', 'fact', 'one', 'characters', 'actual', 'painter', 'deliberately', 'part', 'artwork', 'unfinished', 'people', 'meet', 'are', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'others', 'seem', 'underdeveloped', 'too', 'enigmatic', 'make', 'much', 'contribution', 'comprehension', 'material', 'Occasionally', 'get', 'nagging', 'impression', 'number', 'minor', 'characters', 'plot', 'strands', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'state', 'unresolved', 'limbo', 'Moreover', 'film', 'occasionally', 'pedantic', 'tone', 'writer', 'felt', 'more', 'important', 'provide', 'history', 'lesson', 'involve', 'drama', 'What', 'be', 'enlightening', 'character', 'study', 'frequently', 'polemic.Structurally', 'Ararat', 'very', 'complex', 'director', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'characters', 'present', 'one', 'character', 'past', 'events', 'genocide', 'depicted', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'Egoyan', 'credit', 'bringing', 'together', 'even', 'very', 'artifice', 'format', 'up', 'distancing', 'audience', 'emotional', 'immediacy', 'very', 'grim', 'subject', 'matter', 'Ararat', 'more', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'drama', 'serve', 'salutary', 'purpose', 'raising', 'public', 'consciousness', 'shameful', 'tragic', 'moment', 'history', 'too', 'long', 'gone', 'unrecognized', 'general', 'public']",Ararat

It seemed it would be an artsy-fartsy film (pardon the expression), and not illuminating the history behind the Armenian genocide of WWI.  It turned out to be much more than what I had expected, and I think everyone concerned about terrorism should see this; there's so much to ponder on in this film.  The action takes place in the present; the past, the history of Armenia, is discussed as a film is being produced on the subject which revolves around an Armenian modern artist's portrait of himself and his mother.  The artist was named Gorkiy.  He tries to resurrect the memory of his mother, who died in the genocide, in that portrait; his only memento of his family is a photograph that he treasured taken of himself and his mother which he recreates in the portrait.  That portrait was the topic of research for an Armenian woman, an art history professor, mother of Raffi, the main character in this movie by Atom Egoyan.  She describes his actions as his attempt to take his memory of her from off the pile of corpses to place her on a pedestal of life.  I loved how that was said, so I chose that for my title of this review.  The artist left the hands of his mother, which lie unfolded in her lap, unfinished.  The way he paints the faces of his mother and himself echo artwork on the walls of an ancient church in his village.  How he finishes painting her hands reveals his deepest longings to reach for her physical presence which was so violently taken from him.Be forewarned that there is some language and nudity in this film, although it is not overly vulgar; the film is realisitic and honest, but not family friendly.  The contents are heavy.  The only nudity in the film is a love scene between Raffi and his French Canadian girlfriend, and a scene in the fictional film showing Armenian girls dancing nude holding hands in a circle mimicking a bridal dance while the turks douse their bodies with gas, the girls' grisly anointing, before igniting them.  I hate to even mention these atrocities-so much for the sanctity of HUMAN, living, breathing life.  Also, be forewarned that you will hear told nauseating details of the massacres, eyes gouged out (Samson-style), pregnant women raped and then having their wombs slashed open and fetuses slain, boys raped, genitals mutilated etc.  These violent acts, however, do not pervade this film; there is a lot of other material in this film to reflect on.Ararat is the mountain on which Noah's ark came to rest upon after the biblical flood in Genesis 6-9.  Armenia was the first christian nation before Rome; the Roman emperor Constantine declared christianity its state religion in 300 A.D. or so about the time when the Armenian church went its own way.  The country of Armenia is within Turkey, mount Ararat within its domain.  The Armenian genocide of WWI is significant in that, finally, there are many eyewitness accounts, documentation from people from other nations such as the U.S. and Great Britain.  Armenia is in a strategic location militarily and commercially as it lies within the corridor between Asia and the middle east.  All that is not in this movie, but you NEED to know it!  Attitudes about Armenia are brought out masterfully through discussions between Raffi and an airport security official, played by Christopher Plummer, in several scenes and another between Raffi and the actor, of turkish descent, who plays the brutal pasha of Gorkiy's villayet.  Often viewed as terrorists, in actuality, when these Armenians do fight, it is in resistance, self-defense, against ignoble powers that be.Many reviewers say that Ararat is thought provoking, and I ditto that.

Lets not forget these turks, these people who call us racists and call this movie racist.

This movie helpes Armenians understand a neccesary heritage and will help others understand this very central event of the 20th century.The Armenians genocide was the first of this century, but not he last. It served as a blueprint for other mass executions from Hitler to Stalin to Pol Pot.  The Armenians were murdered when no one was looking, just like the Jews.  Unlike the Jews the Armenians have not garned much attention, because everyone in the western press wants to call Islam a religion of 'peace'.  Islam, as we see in this great film, is a religion of hate and intolerance and nothing more.  This film will make you yearn for  revenge against the enemy,  and will make you understand the motive of the Armenians terrorists who used to kill Turkish diplomats(a deed for which heaven reserves a special place).This movie is not to be missed, it is a great rendition of a classic struggle between the self, the soul and the nation.

The so called ""Armenian holocaust"" is the fabric from which director Egoyan spins his narrative, and this event so heavily laden with emotional baggage, becomes almost impossible to approach with intellectual objectivity. The lines between fact and fiction are constantly blurred as in a scene where the protagonist walks onto a movie set about the ""holocaust"" and one of the characters scolds her, not as an actor, but as a very real character from that time. At times this constant commingling loses focus, but Egoyan's heartfelt attempt to bring back the dead through his art imitating art approach, succeeds surprisingly well. Although the ""holocaust"" is shown graphically, Egoyan is aware that we connect most deeply with that to which we can all relate, and this is shown right from the start as an artist attempts to transfer his childhood memories of murdered loved ones to a painter's canvas; the details of a mothers dress . . . the skin of a mothers hand . . . her fingers knitting a quilt. The vivid colors and simple reality of that hand are so compelling they can reach out across decades of despair to caress the forehead, reduce fever, and impart a sense of belonging - a reason for being.  From this inauspicious beginning, Egoyan is able to arrive at a much greater truth: the inherent need for human beings to believe in something - whether or not that belief is grounded in reality or can be proven scientifically. Finally, ARATAT concludes with a simple truth that is just as powerful: the immeasurable but often neglected joy at being able to look upon our loved ones and to hold them in an embrace of life.",4,a giant multi-colored tapestry,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1764,"['film', 'film', 'film', 'out', 'myriad', 'interconnected', 'stories', 'sewn', 'giant', 'multi-colored', 'tapestry', 'so', 'called', 'Armenian', 'holocaust', 'fabric', 'director', 'Egoyan', 'narrative', 'event', 'so', 'heavily', 'laden', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'almost', 'impossible', 'approach', 'intellectual', 'objectivity', 'lines', 'fact', 'fiction', 'are', 'constantly', 'blurred', 'scene', 'where', 'protagonist', 'walks', 'movie', 'set', 'holocaust', 'one', 'characters', 'scolds', 'not', 'actor', 'very', 'real', 'character', 'time', 'times', 'constant', 'commingling', 'focus', 'Egoyan', 'heartfelt', 'attempt', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'art', 'imitating', 'art', 'approach', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'holocaust', 'shown', 'graphically', 'Egoyan', 'aware', 'connect', 'most', 'deeply', 'can', 'relate', 'shown', 'right', 'start', 'artist', 'attempts', 'transfer', 'childhood', 'memories', 'murdered', 'loved', 'ones', 'painter', 'canvas', 'details', 'mothers', 'dress', 'skin', 'mothers', 'hand', 'fingers', 'knitting', 'quilt', 'vivid', 'colors', 'simple', 'reality', 'hand', 'are', 'so', 'compelling', 'can', 'reach', 'out', 'decades', 'despair', 'caress', 'forehead', 'reduce', 'fever', 'impart', 'sense', 'belonging', 'reason', 'being', 'inauspicious', 'beginning', 'Egoyan', 'able', 'arrive', 'much', 'greater', 'truth', 'inherent', 'need', 'human', 'beings', 'believe', 'something', 'not', 'belief', 'grounded', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'proven', 'scientifically', 'Finally', 'ARATAT', 'simple', 'truth', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'immeasurable', 'often', 'neglected', 'joy', 'being', 'able', 'look', 'loved', 'ones', 'hold', 'embrace', 'life']",Ararat

The film trivializes a horrific crime and then pathetically concludes with the whine that Turkey still denies that the genocide has taken place.And this film will only help in their efforts to claim that it is all a fraud by those dirty silly delusional Christian Armenians.Artists should always be kept away from serious subjects and only be allowed to deal with stories about phallus symbols, Gay progaganda and how wonderful it is to be them. Leave the adult important things to the mere hacks.Embarrasing tripe.",1,2 Million Armenian Christians were murdered by Muslims but this has nothing to do with me so who cares?,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2665,"['ARARAT', '2002', 'Starring', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'gaggle', 'modern', 'day', 'Canadian', 'liberals', 'artists', 'are', 'having', 'type', 'narcisistic', 'problems', 'characters', 'SEINFELD', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'picture', 'go', 'One', 'just', 'discovered', 'son', 'turned', 'homosexual', 'getting', 'last', 'shot', 'movie', 'success', 'oh', 'so', 'self', 'important', 'teen', 'putz', 'having', 'sex', 'stepsister', 'smuggling', 'dope', 'Turkey', 'resorts', 'vandalism', 'art', 'father', 'just', 'committed', 'suicide', 'instead', 'getting', 'cooly', 'Repeat', 'me..a', 'Terrorist', 'man', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'Zzzzz', 'killed', 'trying', 'assassinate', 'someone', 'stepbrothers', 'finally', 'just', 'trying', 'lecture', 'dead', 'armenian', 'artist', 'being', 'heckled.Luckily', '1915', 'Muslem', 'Turks', 'committed', 'genocide', 'Christian', 'Armenians', 'thus', 'allowing', 'someone', 'learn', 'embrace', 'Gay', 'Agenda', 'let', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'off', 'Spielberg', 'ala', 'SCHINDLERS', 'LIST', 'get', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'learn', 'take', 'responsibility', 'whatsoever', 'actions', 'mother', 'learn', 'should', 'stop', 'worrying', 'dead', 'armenian', 'artists', 'pick', 'son', 'up', 'airport.Is', ""n't"", 'just', 'great', 'two', 'million', 'Armenians', 'died', 'horrible', 'deaths', '20th', 'centurys', 'first', 'Thank', 'Muslems', 'progresive', 'efforts', 'field', 'genocide', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'solve', 'Liberals', 'personal', 'problems', '2002', 'appalling', 'pile', 'self', 'centered', 'pretentious', 'rubbish', 'much', 'Liberal', 'attitudes', 'current', 'war', 'terror', 'matter', 'what', 'Evil', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'world', 'final', 'analysis', 'always', 'Liberals', 'really', 'groovy', 'bit', 'lint', 'navels', 'everybody', 'film', 'talk', 'care', 'about', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'up', 'neck', 'excrement', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'tried', 'character', 'impossible', 'film', 'nasty', 'potshots', 'ONLY', 'decent', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'THE', 'FORTY', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'MUSA', 'DAGH', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'wretched', 'film', 'horrific', 'crime', 'then', 'pathetically', 'whine', 'Turkey', 'still', 'genocide', 'taken', 'place.And', 'film', 'will', 'only', 'help', 'efforts', 'claim', 'fraud', 'dirty', 'silly', 'delusional', 'Christian', 'Armenians.Artists', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'kept', 'away', 'serious', 'subjects', 'only', 'be', 'allowed', 'deal', 'stories', 'phallus', 'symbols', 'Gay', 'progaganda', 'how', 'wonderful', 'be', 'Leave', 'adult', 'important', 'things', 'mere', 'hacks.Embarrasing', 'tripe']",Ararat
