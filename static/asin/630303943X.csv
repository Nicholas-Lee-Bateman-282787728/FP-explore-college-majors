After Dr. Vengard asks stressful questions about her husband Larry (Douglas), Jill's hiccups return. That night, Jill decides that the work-distracted Larry isn't at all attentive when he fails to notice she's spent all day at the beauty salon.At her next therapy visit, Jill meets Alexander Sebastian, a somewhat misanthropic artist (Meredith) and they in time become romantically involved. Larry's attempt to make Jill jealous by claiming he has a girlfriend fails and Sebastian moves into the Baker home after Larry goes to a hotel.We are left to ask: Do Jill and Sebastian find happiness together, or does she reconcile with Larry, and if the latter, how can it possibly come about?.Merle Oberon fans are ""certain"" to enjoy:A SONG TO REMEMBER (1945). This Technicolor biopic stars Oscar-winner Cornel Wilde as Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin and Oberon as crossdressing novelist George Sand. Paul Muni co-stars.

He introduces her to the world of art, especially modern painting; and, rapt with novelty, and a man who seems to take an interest in her as a person, rather than a trophy, she falls for him.  To win her back, husband Melvyn Douglas must apply his salesman genius to his marriage.'Feeling', like the films of his late years, is relatively muted Lubitsch - there are few of the visual conceits or accumulated comic hysterics we have come to expect from his 'touch'.  The one major comic set-piece, a dinner given for Hungarian clients led by a man called Kafka (!), leads into strange, fragmented territory, and a beautiful, suspended eroticism.Lubitsch is eminently fair-minded (or cynical!): both partners are liable to take the other for granted, and must learn to forgoe selfish power games in favour of a more satisfying equality - Meredith is a negative, very funny spanner in this process.for a film that makes middlebrow fun of the excesses of modern art, 'That Uncertain Feeling' is a model example of modernism, Lubitsch's precise geometry of style, his use of frames (photos, paintings etc.) within tight compositions leading to the cool irony that complements the underlying, rarely stated emotion.

352148,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,630303943X,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[16, 17]","A blithe screwball comedy from director Ernst Lubitsch about an ""ideal"" modern couple (known to their friends as ""the Happy Bakers"") whose marriage is on the rocks... Merle Oberon has a six-year itch; her husband (Melvyn Douglas) is a bit of a boob, an all right guy, but a bit obsessed with his work and at times inattentive.  When Merle bumps into a free-thinking, artsy malcontent (a young Burgess Meredith, in a choice, juicy role), she falls in his arms and throws her marriage away.  The story was originally filmed by Lubitsch in the silent era, but whether it's 1925 or 1941, the plot is still startlingly frank and modern: Douglas takes the affair and divorce in his stride, and even does a bit of fooling around on his own in a bid to get his wife back... The film features brisk, witty dialogue and a zippy start, and though it kind of loses a little steam midway through, it's still pretty fun.

But this attraction is only superficial and it gets boring in its turn by the total unpredictability of the new man and the film implies woman wants some stability and regularity.

352158,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,630303943X,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 2]","""That Uncertain Feeling,"" is an 84 minute, black and white Hollywood comedy: what the English used to call a drawing room comedy; with a definite pre-war flavor.  It was released in April 1941, and America was at war by December, 1941.  It's a rather frivolous film, in fact, considering World War II was already being fought elsewhere. However, it was directed by the great German Ernst Lubitsch, (Ninotchka) who specialized in the frivolous, and was made by his own production company. (Don't feel too bad about this flop though, Lubitsch had several great films yet in him, 1942'sTo Be or Not to Be, 1943'sHeaven Can Wait (The Criterion Collection), and 1946'sCluny Brown (1946) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Italy], among others.)  Anyway, THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING is a loose remake of Lubitsch's own 1925 silent film KISS ME AGAIN, and was a flop at its release.  The film also has a definite European flavor, as it was based on the work of the French playwright Victorien Sardou.  It might also have been considered dated at its release, as Sardou was a 19th century figure, whose play ""Tosca"" was the libretto for the opera of the same name.  Donald Ogden Stewart, considered a witty man, wrote the screenplay.  Visual and sound quality are both poor in this release, and there are no subtitles, so many viewers will never know if the film is witty or not.The picture opens with a lot of mittel euro flavor, lots of mention of Budapest and Hungarian goulash, heaven knows why.  Anyway, young Park Avenue housewife Jill Baker, played by the Indian-born beauty Merle Oberon (Wuthering Heights) contracts a case of hiccups six years into her marriage. Her neglectful, otherwise occupied insurance agent husband Larry, played by the suave Melvyn Douglas, (NINOTCHKA) sends Jill to Freudian psychologist Dr. Vengard, played with dry humor by British actor Alan Mowbray.  Vengard concludes that the hiccups are caused by Jill's boredom with her marriage. As to that, well, Jill meets in the doctor's waiting room entertaining but highly Narcissistic concert pianist Alexander Sebastian, played by Burgess  Meredith, (trainer in the Rocky films,Grumpier Old Men), who really gets to chew the scenery here.  Jill forms a relationship with Sebastian and files for divorce. Her husband Larry, who is still in love with her, initially agrees, but he has some tricks up his sleeve and the couple soon reunites.  Eve Arden, (Grease,Our Miss Brooks) is substantially wasted in the small part of Sally.  Though she does manage to add some bite to the artificial proceedings as secretary to lawyer Kafka.

The ""bonus features"" appear not to exist.Still, this is a reasonably priced way to view these two delightful films.  I was already familiar with ""Beat the Devil"" so I really got this for Lubitsch's ""That Uncertain Feeling"" and I was not disappointed - it's a delightful comedy with some interestingly suggestive moments (""When I come, they go"" - hmmm, it would seem she needs to come more often..) and some great discussions of modern art and music.  I wouldn't mind a better print of this film, but at present there only seem to be over-priced ""imports"" around.""Beat the Devil"" is a somewhat silly, but quite enjoyable film that plays off Bogart's established screen persona to good effect.  Robert Morley and Peter Lorre are quite amusing and everyone has a good time.  A rather slight film all things considered, but well worth watching.Why the DVD producers called this ""Comedy Noir"" I couldn't tell you (Lubitsch certainly isn't noirish at all and I'm not really convinced that ""Beat the Devil"" counts as noir either, but maybe) nor why they belong on the same DVD (other than both being in the public domain).Definitely worth a few bucks and let's hope someone issues more classic Lubitsch in a superior edition soon!",4,Great movies - acceptable prints,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,1377,"['review', 'DVD', 'Beat', 'Devil/That', 'Uncertain', 'Feeling', 'not', 'other', 'editions.The', 'prints', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'found', 'quite', 'watchable', 'bonus', 'features', 'appear', 'not', 'exist.Still', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'way', 'view', 'two', 'delightful', 'films', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'Beat', 'Devil', 'really', 'got', 'Lubitsch', 'Uncertain', 'Feeling', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'interestingly', 'suggestive', 'moments', 'When', 'come', 'go', 'hmmm', 'would', 'seem', 'come', 'more', 'often..', 'great', 'discussions', 'modern', 'art', 'music', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'better', 'print', 'film', 'present', 'only', 'seem', 'be', 'over-priced', 'imports', 'around', 'Beat', 'Devil', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Bogart', 'established', 'screen', 'persona', 'good', 'effect', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'everyone', 'good', 'time', 'rather', 'slight', 'film', 'things', 'considered', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Why', 'DVD', 'producers', 'called', 'Comedy', 'Noir', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Lubitsch', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'noirish', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'convinced', 'Beat', 'Devil', 'noir', 'maybe', 'why', 'belong', 'same', 'DVD', 'other', 'being', 'public', 'domain', '.Definitely', 'few', 'bucks', 'let', 'hope', 'someone', 'issues', 'more', 'classic', 'Lubitsch', 'superior', 'edition', 'soon']",That Uncertain Feeling VHS
