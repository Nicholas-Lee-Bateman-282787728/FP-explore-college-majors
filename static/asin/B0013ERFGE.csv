1141613,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B0013ERFGE,Amanda Richards,"[25, 28]","Bridget Cardigan (Diane Keaton) suddenly finds herself out of money and upper class home when her husband Don (Ted Danson) gets downsized from his company.  Unable to find a job, and out of desperation, she takes a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank, and as soon as she lays eyes on the vast fortune sitting around locked in plain sight, she starts hatching a plan to liberate some of it.Her ingenious and simple plan requires the help of two other people, and soon she persuades the reluctant Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah) and the ditsy Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes) to aid and abet her scheme to steal worn out bills before they get shredded.All together now:And the money kept rolling in from every sideJackie's pretty hands reached out and they reached wideNow you may feel it should havebeen a conscience-pricking schemeBut that's not the point my friendsWhen the money keeps rolling in, you don't ask howThink of all the people guaranteed a good time nowBridget called the needy to her, opened up the doorsNever been a fund like the Federal Reserve Bank plan*After a while, there are thoughts of calling it a day, but Bridget pushes hard for milking it for all it's worth.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)1. The lack of money is the root of all scheming2. People who live with poor spouses shouldn't clean banks3. A dollar saved is a dollar earned4. Don't throw the money out with the trash paper5. Money changes everything6. Two things are certain - theft and taxesThis is a light hearted comedy about three women from different backgrounds who come together to pull off an unlikely heist from a secure facility.  Undeniably, there are more plot holes than plot, but who's counting?  There are some funny moments, and some interesting twists, and even though the movie mostly misses the mark, Keaton and Latifah are as good as always.

1141614,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013ERFGE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I totally expected to hate this, and really I ONLY watched it because my wife wanted to; that and the fact that Queen Latifah is so amazing in everything (even the movies that are horrible).  What I found so fascinating was that I actually was highly entertained, despite the fact that the film starred the `ever-so-crazy' Katie Holmes and Diane Keaton, the queen of neurotic overacting.  Let's face it, Keaton was once a goddess on the coat-tails of Meryl Streep.  Her early work with Woody Allen is beyond genius, and her early 80's success was well deserved (UGH, watch her in `Reds'...she is simply flawless), but as of late Keaton falls victim to her own talent.  Where her neurotic spasms once felt fresh and endearing (watch her in `Manhattan Murder Mystery', where she is crazy yet totally delightful), they now appear overreaching and overdone.Like a turkey; a burnt one.In `Mad Money' I was kind of expecting `Because I Said So' (horrifyingly ridiculous movie) Keaton, but what I got was more like `Something's Gotta Give' (much better film, MUCH better performance) Keaton.  She is all over the place, but in a good way.  She's actually really funny, and she manages to capture a little piece of the Keaton I fell in love with all those years ago.The film is one of those movies that is so preposterous it might actually make sense.  You ever hear one of those stories that is so stupid and so unbelievable that it can't be made up?  That's how `Mad Money' feels.  It's one of those plots that is beyond believable, so far-fetched that it actually could be possible; you know.Bridget Cardigan likes being rich, but when her husband gets laid off she finds her checks bouncing and her house up for sale.  She winds up taking a custodial job in order to receive benefits and concocts this plan to rob the bank she's cleaning.  She enlists the help of Jackie, the diabetic half-wit and Nina, a single mother trying to do right by her two sons, to help her rob the bank of money their just going to destroy anyways.  It's a full proof plan, until Bridget gets a little too greedy.  I'm telling you, watch it, it's one of those ridiculous plots that starts to make a LOT of sense when it's all said and done.I think my wife is going to start working at the local bank tomorrow.The film is far from perfect, but it is enjoyable, really enjoyable.  Keaton is her neurotic self, but it works here.  Latifah is a little laid back for my tastes, but she handles herself well and when she hits, she hits hard.  Katie Holmes reminded me of what I saw in her pre-Cruise.  She is sweet and charming and endearing, despite her character's apparent craziness.  The men here are just kind of bystanders, but Ted Danson (who had a major comeback with `Damages') fits right into the mood of the film, and Adam Rothenberg will have the ladies paying attention (he reminds me of Butler, which is a good thing).Watch it.  It's funny.  Sure, it's not a `great' movie, but it's entertaining, and as one of my Ammy friends (looking at you MKIA) said to me recently...I need to just lighten up, and so I did.",4,"Is it just me, or was this kind of funny?",1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,3093,"['totally', 'expected', 'hate', 'really', 'ONLY', 'watched', 'wife', 'wanted', 'fact', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'so', 'amazing', 'everything', 'even', 'movies', 'are', 'horrible', 'What', 'found', 'so', 'fascinating', 'was', 'actually', 'was', 'highly', 'entertained', 'fact', 'film', 'starred', 'ever-so-crazy', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'queen', 'neurotic', 'overacting', 'Let', 'face', 'Keaton', 'was', 'once', 'goddess', 'coat-tails', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'early', 'work', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'genius', 'early', '80', 'success', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'UGH', 'watch', 'Reds', 'simply', 'flawless', 'late', 'Keaton', 'victim', 'own', 'talent', 'Where', 'neurotic', 'spasms', 'once', 'felt', 'fresh', 'endearing', 'watch', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'where', 'crazy', 'yet', 'totally', 'delightful', 'now', 'appear', 'overreaching', 'turkey', 'burnt', 'one.In', 'Mad', 'Money', 'was', 'kind', 'expecting', 'Said', 'So', 'horrifyingly', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'Keaton', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'more', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'MUCH', 'better', 'performance', 'Keaton', 'place', 'good', 'way', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'capture', 'little', 'piece', 'Keaton', 'fell', 'love', 'years', 'ago.The', 'film', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'preposterous', 'might', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'ever', 'hear', 'one', 'stories', 'so', 'stupid', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'up', 'how', 'Mad', 'Money', 'feels', 'one', 'plots', 'believable', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'actually', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'know.Bridget', 'Cardigan', 'likes', 'being', 'rich', 'when', 'husband', 'laid', 'checks', 'bouncing', 'house', 'up', 'sale', 'up', 'taking', 'custodial', 'job', 'order', 'receive', 'benefits', 'concocts', 'plan', 'rob', 'bank', 'cleaning', 'help', 'Jackie', 'diabetic', 'half-wit', 'Nina', 'single', 'mother', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'two', 'sons', 'help', 'rob', 'bank', 'money', 'just', 'going', 'destroy', 'anyways', 'full', 'proof', 'plan', 'Bridget', 'little', 'too', 'greedy', ""'m"", 'telling', 'watch', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'plots', 'make', 'LOT', 'sense', 'when', 'said', 'done.I', 'think', 'wife', 'going', 'start', 'working', 'local', 'bank', 'tomorrow.The', 'film', 'far', 'perfect', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'Keaton', 'neurotic', 'self', 'here', 'Latifah', 'little', 'laid', 'back', 'tastes', 'well', 'when', 'hard', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'reminded', 'what', 'saw', 'pre-Cruise', 'sweet', 'charming', 'endearing', 'character', 'apparent', 'craziness', 'men', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'kind', 'bystanders', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'comeback', 'Damages', 'right', 'mood', 'film', 'Adam', 'Rothenberg', 'will', 'have', 'ladies', 'paying', 'attention', 'Butler', 'good', 'thing', '.Watch', 'funny', 'Sure', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Ammy', 'friends', 'looking', 'MKIA', 'said', 'recently', 'need', 'just', 'lighten', 'up', 'so', 'did']",N/A

1141621,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B0013ERFGE,Brad Baker,"[2, 2]","Anchor Bay has just released the DVd transfer of ""Mad Money"", or how to rip-off the U.S. Treasury.  ""Mad Money"" is a remake of the 2001 BBC production: ""Hot Money"".  Dinae Keaton plays pampered Bridget Cardigan, who lives with hubby Don(Ted Danson) in their sprawling Midwestern home.  But things aren't so good. Don lost his six-figure job, and he owes $285,000 on his credit card(or something like that). What to do? Bridget gets a janitorial job at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.  She meets young Jackie Truman(Katie Holmes) and bored-to-death Nina Brewster(Queen Latifah).  Nina's job is to burn worn-out currency. Bridget schemes to steal the bills before they're destroyed. Why not stuff them in your panties and walk right out the door? This improbable chick-flick comedy is a real laugher, or it would be, if more of the jokes didn't fall so flat. Scenes with the black sex-starved treasury guard go on too long, and just aren't funny. The shots of our intrepid trio trying to stash large bundles of ""green loot"" in their homes are certainly a hoot. Those bills do look so real. And Katie Holmes is very good as the ditzy Jackie. Extras include a commentary, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, and two trailers.  Good comedy is timing, and a better screenplay would have helped. But there's a lot of talent here, and it is nice to look at all that money. And this is surely your only chance to see Diane Keaton cleaning toilets.

I'm one of those people who gamely stay in my seat watching a movie no matter how bad it is, but with Mad Money, I couldn't even muster up enough to energy to care about the characters.The plot was thinly carried out. Basically Keaton has been unemployed and gets a job as a maid in the Federal Depository. That in itself was rather unbelievable. She sees all this money being shredded and hooks up with Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes to find a way to rescue some of it. Ted Danson, plays Keaton's husband, and is probably executes the best acting in this farce.Keaton is an Oscar winner and for the life of me I can't figure out why she agreed to do this film. Same goes for Queen Latifah. Katie Holmes is the weakest link with acting so bad it made me squirm. Keaton is not terribly believable as the rich yuppie now turned maid due to a down turn in her and her husband's job.

As she watches worn out currency being shredded, she hatches a seemingly fool proof scheme to steal the money. To do so, she'll need some help from her coworkers Nina Brewster and Jackie Truman. The scheme works, but the three and their significant others need to be careful and avoid being caught with their ""Mad Money"".""Mad Money"" is a funny, enjoyable if at times unbelievable movie. From the beginning of the movie you know the three get caught (which does take away some of the suspense) so the fun is in watching them cook up the scheme, how it works, and how it backfires on them. The way they get away with stealing the money is unrealistic, but anyone who has ever dreamed of getting rich quick will cheer on the three women. While the movie is largely from Bridget's viewpoint, I found that while her attempts to reenter the work world made her a sympathetic character, her greediness made her an unlikable character at times. Nina was the best written character - a single mother who wants the best for her children, but afraid of letting the stealing go on too long, she is the moral compass of the group. Jackie was the least well written of the three - very little is shown of her home life and you're never really sure of her motivation to join the other two. It's nice to see strong roles for women and all three actresses (Diane Keaton as Bridget, Queen Latifah as Nina, and Katie Holmes as Jackie) nail their parts.

Their children are grown up & gone and ostensibly don't even keep in touch anymore.Pressed to desperation, Bridget (Keaton) goes to work as a janitor at a federal depository.

While there she meets up with Nina (Queen Latifah) and Jackie (Katie Holmes).  Together, they finally decide that enough is enough.  They want to finally get a ""piece of the pie"" that has so long been denied them.So, they endeavor to come up with an ingenious plan to steal $$ from the depository.  They almost cover all their tracks, but.....eventually greed gets the better part of their ability to reason.  Listening to Bridget rationalize about how she is justified in her actions almost makes you believe she's telling the truth!  Along the way we get plenty of laughs at these amateur con-artists who are able to steal sums that would make cat burglars jealous.While the ending is a little too good to be true, movies like this would not be very fitting if they had tragic finales.

There's brilliant comic potential right there.But alas, that comic potential is not realized in ""Mad Money,"" a limply long-winded comedy that strives to be quirky, original and distinctly girly. Unfortunately the comic timing is always at least a little off, the writing is mediocre, and the three lead actresses are either given little to work with, or just don't have the acting muscle to make you care.Bridget (Diane Keaton) is living a comfortable upper-middle-class existence in the suburbs -- until her laid-off hubby Don (Ted Danson) reveals that they are up to their ears in debt, and he can't get another job. Goodbye suburban splendor.So Bridget rushes out to get a job, only to find that the only job an unskilled older woman can get is as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank. But when she sees Nina (Queen Latifah) shredding the worn-out bills, Bridget becomes hungrily determined to save her luxe lifestyle by smuggling out those about-to-be-destroyed bills... or ""recycling"" them, as she puts it.So -- with the help of the impoverished Nina and funky, spacey young coworker Jackie (Katie Holmes) -- Bridget concocts a complex plan to smuggle out the bills, involving garbage cans, security cameras, locks and big panties. And for a time, it seems their troubles are over -- but of course, as the flash-forward interrogations show, things are not going to just go smoothly for those who steal, even if the money is worn out.In theory, ""Mad Money"" is a funny movie -- it has a plot that hasn't really been dealt with before, and any complex series of escapades inevitably offers room for comedy. But somehow ""Mad Money"" never gels into something really entertaining -- instead, I spent most of the seemingly endless plot waiting for something unexpected to happen. Occasionally, I chuckled reluctantly.A lot of the blame for that lies on Callie Khouri's shoulders -- she skims over potentially funny moments, and tries to draw out extremely unfunny ones by padding them with unspeakably lame dialogue (""Is this an intervention?""). And despite its manic energy (throwing bills around the bedroom), the plot unfolds at a painfully sluggish pace, which only gets interesting near the crazy finale.Nor do acting and characterization save the day. Keaton does a solid, slightly manic job as a desperate woman who feels she has no choice but to ""recycle,"" although she's a bit too spoiled to be likable. Latifah plays the same feisty-sista role she's played in a dozen other movies, and a snarly-haired, blank-eyed Holmes demonstrates the acting range of a pair of dentures. But with more exposed teeth.""Mad Money"" has plenty of money shown, but very little madness.

She can not even pay her housekeeper for cleaning her house. Her housekeepr gives her the idea to work for the Federal Reserve Bank, located in Kansas City where they live. Bridget is hired into the maintenance department, into a job otherwise known as a ""janitor"".After being hired, she is given a tour of how strictly the security department monitors the flow of money which is given to the Federal Reserve Bank by banks who collect the worn and torn money for eventual destruction. It eats at her why all that good money is destroyed and burned. One day, when she is shopping at a Home Depot type store, she makes a great discovery: they sell exactly the same type of locks used by the government. The lock is used on a cart which holds loads of old money ... She devises a cunning plan of how to obtain this ""to be destroyed"" money for herself - by replacing the lock during her housekeeping rounds - at a crucial moment and later replacing it with the real one, all totally undetected by the cameras. Her only problem is, she can not do this alone. She needs the help of two other employees. She sells her plan to Nina, a black women in her early 30s, a single mother raising two school-aged sons, who could use the money for their education and Jackie, a young 20-something who has a quirky and wacky personality. They succeed beyond their wildest imaginations until ... one of them gets careless and starts spending more than is advisable. After that, the Feds begin monitoring their activities and the real fun begins ...This is a totally funny and well written plot on a subject near and dear to many people, how to obtain a huge amount of money, without having to work for it. Diane Keaton is a believable middle-to-upper class suburbanite. Nina played by Queen Latifah, is a highly believable black single mother, working hard to make ends meet and build a solid life for herself and her children. Jackie played by Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise), is funny and nutty in her role as a twenty-something trailer-living housekeeper for the Federal Reserve Bank. She lives with her boyfriend who is currently unemployed. There are humorous twists and turns after things get fowled up. When the Feds get involved the matters really rock and roll. The conclusion of the film is hilarious as they do indeed ""get away with it.""  Highly recommended summer comedy.

1141643,ATJE929ETFFNH,B0013ERFGE,"Fred ""Fred""","[5, 6]","Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Katie Holmes are the main characters in Callie Khouri's Mad Money. Callie Khouri is the screenwriter of one of the better movies I've seen (Thelma & Louise) so I hoped her transition into directing would be as much of a success.Alas.Mad Money is a comedy about three common women who decide to do something uncommon: rob a bank. Diane Keaton's character learns that she's about to lose it all when her husband (Ted Danson) is fired. As an erstwhile stay-at-home mom and wife, she is forced to get a job, but with no skills to speak of, she finally gets the only job she can as a janitor at a Federal Reserve Bank.There, she meets up with Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes who each have both financial and other problems. They form a bond and devise a plan to smuggle currency out of the bank. At first they succeed beyond their wildest dreams, but as usual with these heist stories, things fall apart and they are in real danger of getting snapped up by the law.My problem with the movie has nothing to do with the plot which actually contains the seeds of a really good comedy. The pacing is good and I wasn't bored at any time watching. The train starts to leave the tracks for me in the plausibility of the story itself followed quickly by the acting. Keaton is not really funny nor properly motivated; nor are any of the others' with the possible grudging exception of Queen Latifah--her motivation rings true and she's got great screen presence. Holmes has never been able to act as far as I'm concerned.That said, the ersatz motivations are feeble and again, unbelievable. For a heist movie, I didn't see those features that I like: the planning, the suspense as we watch whether that planning will be executed flawlessly and as the inevitable lawman starts snapping at their heels, how do they get away? Yes, in a properly-executed heist movie, the viewer almost roots for the bad guys but it is important that we identify with them (hence motivation).A possible saving grace would have been if the characters had shown some guilt at the trouble they'd caused. There are no remorseful glance-backs on the characters' parts in Mad Money, no regret which is important to me as it brings a human angle to the story.I wanted these women to get caught and rot in jail, something most decidedly not comedic.

1141646,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0013ERFGE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I just wasn't feeling this one. I dig heist movies, truly. But MAD MONEY, insipid and bland, just isn't a good representative of the genre. The heist movie conventions may be present, but they don't much sparkle, not with wit or imagination. I've always enjoyed the planning stages of a caper, but this time that aspect gets a perfunctory glossing over. The execution of the crime lacks believability and panache (Really? One extra lock cures what ails these women?) Robbing the Federal Reserve Bank can't be this simple, can it? The ridiculousness of the plot isn't toned down to something more palatable. Would you really let a frivolous space cadet, a total stranger, in on your lawbreaking scheme? MAD MONEY holds few thrills and no intensity, but it does boast a pace which plods; this, to me, is not a winning formula. And, even though the film does have some funny bits, it mostly strikes out as a comedy. I struggled thru the story, which to be blunt is dull. And the story is dull because the characters are dull.Diane Keaton, I feel, is a big reason this film underwhelmed. She's the lead, after all. To her go the bulk of the praise and, conversely, the bounty of jeers. Keaton plays Bridget, a middle-aged, upper-class yuppie mastermind who discovers that she's about to lose her posh lifestyle. She lands a custodial gig at the Federal Reserve Bank and finds a way to circumvent the bank's supposedly ""foolproof"" system of disposing old, worn-out bills. Keaton is simply not good here. I've never felt so uncomfortable watching her ""act"" (read: mugging). Here, she drops more over-the-top furtive glances than a silent film star. Bridget is an exasperating and unlikable woman. This is made clear quite early on, from her treatment of her cleaning woman to how she recruits a possible member of her ""gang"" (she basically stalks her and wears her down). And so if the lead doesn't engage you, then where's your investment in watching?Really, the rest of the cast gets the broad brush treatment. Bridget's two initial accomplices are Nina and Jackie. Queen Latifah's Nina is down-to-earth, a working single mom (she shreds money in the bank), and is motivated primarily by her concern for her two kids. We see Nina's story arc coming a mile away. However, when she enrolls her kids to an upscale school, she does end up with the funniest line in the film. And, good acting aside, I actually got a kick out of Katie Holmes' waifish, free spirited, spacy Jackie. She's a trailer honey and delivers the carts of tired currency destined for death. Wished I knew more about Jackie, other than she's diabetic and likes to perkily dance as she toils. Hated the guy who played her vapid boyfriend, though. Meanwhile, Ted Danson's Don is Bridget's sensible husband who cautions his fellow felons: ""Don't get greedy. See, that's how people get caught."" Don's a good guy, and I like him.The chemistry among the three women is unconvincing and forced. I just don't see it, these three getting together. Even the moments intended to be joyous and celebratory come off as false. I couldn't buy that scene of the damsels-in-crime on the bed and reveling in cash money. And, of course, something was bound to go wrong. Months and months of repeat heists; it was only a matter of time before these thieves fell prey to complacency and stupidity and to not knowing when to stop. The downfall begins with Bridget's avarice, and Jackie's dumb-as-earwax boyfriend provides the crowning touch. The big bad IRS drops in and then it's on to the annoyingly improbable climax. But, at least, the film was consistent. It let me down from start to finish.There's a chance MAD MONEY will strike a deeper chord with female viewers. Maybe. Although, you'd think, a bad movie remains a bad movie, no matter the gender which screens it.

Remember how Ahnuld was the villain in ""Terminator One"" but once he was mega-popular he was the hero in ""Terminator Two.""  The same has happened with Latifah.  In ""Set It Off,"" she was the most violent and money-obsessed of the crew.  Here, she is the one with the most morals and common sense.  Both movies deal with women joining to do a dangerous, illegal activity.  Both movies ask the question, ""When is the scheme taking it too far?""  Both ask, ""How will this affect our love lives?""  Both will sometimes have the viewer's heart in her or his throat wondering if things will work.  Now that I think of it, some may be annoyed at how this just repeats ""Set It Off.""There aren't enough roles for older actresses and full-figured actresses, so this is helpful to that group.

1141655,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B0013ERFGE,Jem,"[3, 3]","Since many reviewers have already outlined the plot, I'll just briefly mention that three women plot to steal money that is slated to be shredded at the Federal Reserve.  The actual plan to steal the money is definitely over the top.  Some convoluted scam involving lock swaps and keys that would never be trusted to just one person, let alone these people!  And the plan is never fully drawn out, you just see the women implement it.  But this is not a heist film like Oceans' 11, so a clever Hollywood conceit is fine for making a comedy work.Overall, the movie is mindless entertainment, although it does suffer from a few noticeable flaws. The most glaring issue I had watching this film was that only two of the main characters were really introduced. Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes) is only given the most cursory examination, and you never really find out anything more about her than the fact that she's poor and she's air-headed, but supposedly not a druggie. The other main characters are introduced in much greater detail, which gives a more complete picture of their motives and explains their willingness to risk everything for the big payoff. At one point in the movie the characters are sitting around a table discussing why they want the money, and Jackie's only reason is, ""Why not?"" In contrast, one of the other women is an ex-socialite (Diane Keaton) whose excessive lifestyle landed her in the poor house, and the other is a lower-middle-class single mother (the Queen) who wants to send her children to better schools. In a film solely about crime, conveying motives is an extremely important detail. I admit it - I love Queen Latifah.  She plays comedic roles very well, and is just a likeable celebrity.  So, I'm not sure if her performance stood out because of my bias, or that her character was just better designed than the other two.  Diane Keaton easily filled the shoes of a former socialite and I had no trouble buying Katie Holmes as a dingbat.  The dialog among the principals was interesting and believable for the most part - you can imagine these three people actually talking and acting this way.  Certainly, there are some funny moments in here, but for the most part the film is just slow.  The women spend years stealing the money.  And naturally enough, they are eventually suspected of something.The ending left something to be desired.  At no point in the movie did the ""good guys"" actually compare the serial numbers on the cash to those that had been erased (supposed to be shredded), which would have immediately given them concrete evidence. I realize this is a comedy, but this made the Feds come off as idiots instead of the women cleverly getting the better of them, which would have been more satisfying.  ""Mad Money"" also tried to follow in the hallowed footsteps of heist films - they need to get away with it.  When watching a heist film, the audience wants the thieves to make off with the cash, especially in a ""victimless crime"" (e.g. robbing a casino - no hostages, no killing).  Secretly we want to be able to get the better of the big guys.  But, this didn't work for the comedy because the women did come under investigation, and getting their happily ever after was beyond contrived.  So, if you are expecting something likeThe Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition), a heist film with some humor, you won't find it here.  However, it was fun to watch if you've got nothing else you're dying to see.",3,"Fun, but slow...",1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,3461,"['many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'outlined', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'briefly', 'mention', 'three', 'women', 'plot', 'steal', 'money', 'slated', 'be', 'shredded', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'actual', 'plan', 'steal', 'money', 'definitely', 'top', 'convoluted', 'scam', 'involving', 'lock', 'swaps', 'keys', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'trusted', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'let', 'alone', 'people', 'plan', 'never', 'fully', 'drawn', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'women', 'implement', 'not', 'heist', 'film', 'Oceans', '11', 'so', 'clever', 'Hollywood', 'conceit', 'fine', 'making', 'comedy', 'work.Overall', 'movie', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'suffer', 'few', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'most', 'glaring', 'issue', 'had', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'introduced', 'Jackie', 'Truman', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'only', 'given', 'most', 'cursory', 'examination', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'anything', 'more', 'her', 'fact', 'poor', 'air-headed', 'supposedly', 'not', 'druggie', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'much', 'greater', 'detail', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'motives', 'willingness', 'risk', 'everything', 'big', 'payoff', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'sitting', 'table', 'discussing', 'why', 'want', 'money', 'Jackie', 'only', 'reason', 'Why', 'not', 'contrast', 'one', 'other', 'women', 'ex-socialite', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'excessive', 'lifestyle', 'landed', 'poor', 'house', 'other', 'lower-middle-class', 'single', 'mother', 'Queen', 'who', 'send', 'children', 'better', 'schools', 'film', 'solely', 'crime', 'conveying', 'motives', 'extremely', 'important', 'detail', 'admit', 'love', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'comedic', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'likeable', 'celebrity', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'performance', 'stood', 'out', 'bias', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'better', 'designed', 'other', 'two', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'easily', 'filled', 'shoes', 'former', 'socialite', 'had', 'trouble', 'buying', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'dingbat', 'dialog', 'principals', 'was', 'interesting', 'believable', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'imagine', 'three', 'people', 'actually', 'talking', 'acting', 'way', 'Certainly', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'just', 'slow', 'women', 'spend', 'years', 'stealing', 'money', 'naturally', 'enough', 'are', 'eventually', 'suspected', 'something.The', 'ending', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'point', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'guys', 'actually', 'compare', 'serial', 'numbers', 'cash', 'had', 'been', 'erased', 'supposed', 'be', 'shredded', 'would', 'have', 'immediately', 'given', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'realize', 'comedy', 'made', 'Feds', 'come', 'off', 'idiots', 'instead', 'women', 'cleverly', 'getting', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Mad', 'Money', 'also', 'tried', 'follow', 'hallowed', 'footsteps', 'heist', 'films', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'When', 'watching', 'heist', 'film', 'audience', 'thieves', 'make', 'off', 'cash', 'especially', 'victimless', 'crime', 'e.g', 'robbing', 'casino', 'hostages', 'killing', 'Secretly', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'better', 'big', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'comedy', 'women', 'did', 'come', 'investigation', 'getting', 'happily', 'ever', 'was', 'contrived', 'So', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'likeThe', 'Italian', 'Job', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'heist', 'film', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'However', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'else', ""'re"", 'dying', 'see']",N/A

What if that job was at a federal reserve bank where faded and worn bank notes are destroyed?Mad Money employs such a scenario. In addition there is the aspect of an overly confident manager who is so sure his security is drum tight that no one could possibly sneak money out of his facility.Diane Keaton plays the housewife with an unemployed husband (Ted Danson) who gets a job at the federal reserve. There she meets the struggling single mom (played by Queen Latifah) and the young druggie (played by Katie Holmes--I hope th Scintologists approved). Together they concoct a plan to sneak money out despite the security efforts (random body checks, special keys and locks that should only be opened in the presence of guards, etc.) Of course there are tense moments, such as snap inspections by the manager. And when a security guard gets suspicious, soon he's part of the gang.But the druggie's boyfriend starts investing huge sums of money and the feds are on their case. If one person talks, they all go down--all except the one who should talk and get an easier sentence. So, who talks? Will the feds get their criminals?

This location just so happens to be the place where they shred all of the old dollar bills of all denominations.Diane Keaton plays the mastermind behind the sheme to steal thousands of dollars each day from her new place of work.  Hey, who is going to know, they are throwing it away anyhow.  She enlists two others she meets at work.  One working the shredder and one carting the bills to be shredded.There are definately some funny moments as her husband and others get involved in the plot to get money out of the fed.  The story is not only comical, it is touching in places.  Queen Latifa is a single mom teaching her boys to stay out of crime and getting them to focus on studying to get ahead.  Those she is involved with in the crime of the century care about her situation.  She is really funny and the movie would not be the same without her antics.Katie Holmes plays a ditzy trailer trash type who is more like a valley girl in a way.  She is very good in her role as the one who talks too much and sometimes way too loud.Ted Danson plays the reluctant husband whose loss of a job and pending loss of a house that he and his wife have lived in for years starts the whole process.Overall, this movie will not dissappoint you it will surprise you at actually how good it is.  Not much by way of language, a little by way of inuendo, but very little and the references to sexuality are rather light.  In fact, there are some scenes where one person is harrassing all the women in the work place and the other guy is being rather decent.  Very tastefully done too.Without giving away the story, I recommend this movie to families and friends.  Good story, good theme, good presentation.  One thing I like is that you did not see them stealing the money over and over again where the attempt was to get you to be anxious, the focus was on the people who were involved and what they were doing to hide or get around the difficulties of the plan.Functionally, the DVD was overall okay.  I liked the fact that you there was an immediate choice to view the previews/trailers or go right to the main menu.  I really liked the trailer of the movie ""The Visitor.""  The extras were rather slim though.  Would have preferred an interview or quick documentary on why the fed destroys the older bills.  Maybe some outtakes or deleted scenes as well.  The pakaging was simple and actually a little more functional than others although the disc was a little more difficult to get out of the holder.So, simply put, get Mad Money.

But when she sets out to apply for jobs this college educated woman gets no respect because of her age and because she's been out of the work force for some time. Eventually, she does find work. As a janitor at the Kansas City Federal Reserve, Bridgett comes up with a way to help herself to a lot of money; worn out cash that was going to be destroyed anyway. Never mind that she works in a ""totally secure environment"" where everyone is watched, everywhere, every minute. She's sure her plan will work if she can find help. She convinces two other employees to partner with her: Nina (a level-headed single mother with two sons, played by Queen Latifah) and Jackie (a woman who's a bit spacey but has good sense when it counts, played by Katie Holmes). And then the men in their lives join in.Even though Bridget, Nina and Jackie were doing something they had no business doing (stealing is wrong no matter what reasons they had for taking the money), when they were happy about all of the money they managed to sneak out of the Federal Reserve the first time I was happy for them.

And our hopes were dashed, like a pony pinata broken in many places bleeding candy on a coffee table and floor, when we found out through a helpful steward that the inflight movie ENCHANTED had been replaced with another entirely different show called MAD MONEY.  Not one person on the plane had ever heard of it, but once the lights went down, you could hear the joy emanating from the audience, young and old, male and female, gays and straights, even people who were asleep, it didn't matter, when the titles revealed the name of ""Katie Holmes"" all burst into spontaneous applause.  How long has it been, we asked ourselves.  It was an itch we didn't even know we had been missing, that fondness for a girl who is not only a hot paparazzi ""get,"" but one who has been acclaimed around the globe for her stellar acting in such disparate roles as DAWSONS CREEK, THE ICE STORM, THE GIFT, PHONE BOOTH, ABANDON, and PIECES OF APRIL.The pilot broke through our reverie by announcing that below we could spot famous Lake Tahoe, but no one paid him a bit of mind.  Instead we were all flashing back to Katie Holmes' last movie, BATMAN BEGINS opposite Christian Bale, and how we didn't know it then, but that was to be the last time we would see her on screen until--until now, three years later and a million gossip items later.  The plot involved Katie Holmes starring as ""Jackie Truman,"" a loveable misfit who picks up trash at the Federal Reserve Bank, and who wears headphones and dances to her own private beat.  Just like the real Katie, she harks to the sound of a different drum, but here Jackie Truman has larceny in mind--she develops a brilliant plan (which Diane Keaton, somewhat stereotypically, takes complete credit for) involving stealing millions of money destined for a shredder.Due to her brilliant skills at improv, Katie Holmes brings us up against the bitter edge of the career criminal, how no amount of ""mad money"" is every really enough, not when your blood is boiling and your heart is pounding against your chest like mad.  With her own girl next door good looks, she vividly conveys the sexual excitement that fuels the addict's behavior, helping us understand that the unholy trinity of Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Katie Holmes are not to be trifled with by mere goody two shoes rhetoric.  These three live for the thrill of defying society, much as Artaud did in the France of his silent era, or perhaps the way the Marquis de Sade, a long ago hero, defied provincial mores and brought pain into the repertoire of the bedroom.  Keaton and Latifah have their own place in cinema (and in Latifah's case, in rap) history of course, but without Katie Holmes to inspire them, they would be flapping and floundering inside the inanities of Callie Khouri's lame script for MAD MONEY, like the dead fish they basically are.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and if you happen to be in a plane, the clapping that your hands will start at the end of the movie, will be enough to be mistaken for sheer turbulence, and you will not be allowed to go and line up for the one bathroom at the very back of the plane.

After all, what's the point of going on a journey if thedestination is well known in advance. Okay, bad example. To be moreprecise, what would the point be in watching ""American Idol"" if you knewthe winner at the beginning of the season? Rarely does this techniquework because it takes all the suspenseful wind out from under the sail.This is a problem with ""Mad Money,"" though it's not fatal. No, the fatalproblem in this film is the script. Though I'm sure Diane Keaton, QueenLatifah, and Katie Holmes shoulder some of the blame for agreeing tostar in this movie, it does them no service that the script has themacting like unlikable tramps the whole time.Diane Keaton in particular stands out. Here is one of the greatestactresses of our time. She's one of the few actresses to win an Oscarfor a comedy film (""Anne Hall""), and it's amazing how off her comictiming is in this movie. She stars as Bridget, a wife who is forced togo back to work after her husband Don (Ted Danson) has been unemployedfor over a year, leaving them over $200,000 in debt. She winds upworking as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. To makea long (as well as simple) story short, Bridget enlists the help ofLatifah and Holmes characters to help steel worn old bills that are tobe shredded.Actually, I take it back, this is a good idea. I mean, if you're goingto steel something, you may as well steel something that's untraceable.Not only that, these women need money to get out of debt, so why not?Well, you know how the old movie clich&eacute; goes: Once you get money, youwant more. Lots more. So these women steel. They steel, and steel, andsteel. Then they spend the money they steel on things they don't need.Of course this draws attention to themselves which makes them a targetfor...oh who am I kidding, we all know they get caught. How can we not?After all, the movie begins with the characters getting caught. So sincewe know the result of this game, the only thing left is to enjoy the ride.But how can we enjoy the ride when the scheme seems so simple and thecharacters so unlikable. Latifah's character is the only character whocomes close to likable (she's doing this for her kids), but everyoneelse seems to be steeling for pure greed. The jokes fall flat most ofthe time, and I don't consider the girls making sexual remarks atinappropriate times to be funny. The cast seem bored, with Keatonlooking desperate for a job, Latifah stuck in the ""misunderstood blackwoman"" stereotype she's been playing for awhile, and Holmes silentlypondering why she had to give up making the sequel to ""Batman Begins""for this. Even Ted Danson must be feeling nostalgic for his ""Cheers""days, when he was asked to deliver jokes that were actually funny.Though I know it's a bad pun, it has to be said: You'd be mad to spendyour hard earned money on ""Mad Money.""Rating: * star",1,This Movie Drove Me Mad Crazy,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,2946,"['Whenever', 'movie', 'end', 'story', 'tend', 'get', 'littlecautious', 'what', 'point', 'going', 'journey', 'thedestination', 'well', 'known', 'advance', 'Okay', 'bad', 'example', 'be', 'moreprecise', 'what', 'would', 'point', 'be', 'watching', 'American', 'Idol', 'knewthe', 'winner', 'beginning', 'season', 'Rarely', 'techniquework', 'suspenseful', 'wind', 'sail.This', 'problem', 'Mad', 'Money', 'not', 'fatal', 'No', 'fatalproblem', 'film', 'script', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'QueenLatifah', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'shoulder', 'blame', 'agreeing', 'tostar', 'movie', 'service', 'script', 'themacting', 'unlikable', 'tramps', 'whole', 'time.Diane', 'Keaton', 'particular', 'stands', 'out', 'Here', 'one', 'greatestactresses', 'time', 'one', 'few', 'actresses', 'win', 'Oscarfor', 'comedy', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hall', 'amazing', 'how', 'off', 'comictiming', 'movie', 'Bridget', 'wife', 'who', 'forced', 'togo', 'back', 'work', 'husband', 'Don', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'been', 'unemployedfor', 'year', 'leaving', '200,000', 'debt', 'upworking', 'janitor', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Bank', 'Kansas', 'City', 'makea', 'long', 'as', 'well', 'simple', 'story', 'short', 'Bridget', 'help', 'ofLatifah', 'Holmes', 'characters', 'help', 'steel', 'worn', 'old', 'bills', 'are', 'tobe', 'shredded.Actually', 'take', 'back', 'good', 'idea', 'mean', ""'re"", 'goingto', 'steel', 'something', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'steel', 'something', 'untraceable.Not', 'only', 'women', 'need', 'money', 'get', 'debt', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Well', 'know', 'how', 'old', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Once', 'get', 'money', 'youwant', 'more', 'Lots', 'more', 'women', 'steel', 'steel', 'steel', 'andsteel', 'Then', 'spend', 'money', 'steel', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'need.Of', 'course', 'attention', 'targetfor', 'oh', 'who', 'am', 'kidding', 'know', 'get', 'caught', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'movie', 'characters', 'getting', 'caught', 'So', 'sincewe', 'know', 'result', 'game', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'enjoy', 'ride.But', 'how', 'can', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'when', 'scheme', 'so', 'simple', 'thecharacters', 'so', 'unlikable', 'Latifah', 'character', 'only', 'character', 'whocomes', 'close', 'likable', 'doing', 'kids', 'everyoneelse', 'be', 'steeling', 'pure', 'greed', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'most', 'ofthe', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'girls', 'making', 'sexual', 'remarks', 'atinappropriate', 'times', 'be', 'funny', 'cast', 'seem', 'bored', 'Keatonlooking', 'desperate', 'job', 'Latifah', 'stuck', 'misunderstood', 'blackwoman', 'stereotype', 'been', 'playing', 'awhile', 'Holmes', 'silentlypondering', 'why', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'making', 'sequel', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Even', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'must', 'be', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'Cheers', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'deliver', 'jokes', 'were', 'actually', 'funny.Though', 'know', 'bad', 'pun', 'be', 'said', ""'d"", 'be', 'mad', 'spendyour', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'Mad', 'Money', 'Rating', '*', 'star']",N/A
1141667,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0013ERFGE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","While I gave ""Mad Money"" four stars, it truly deserves a solid three-and-a-half stars (I round up as a rule).  Diane Keaton heads up a great cast in this criminal comedy about three women who pull off the perfect crime at a federal reserve bank.  Keaton plays Bridget Cardigan, a woman desperate for money when her husband Don (Ted Danson) fails to find work after losing his job.  She takes a job as a janitor at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, where she concocts a scheme with single mother Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah) and trippy trailer girl, Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes).  They manage to make quite a profit off of their seemingly no-fail scheme, but how long will it last?For what they have to work with, Keaton, Latifah and Holmes do excellent jobs.  All three are quite funny in their respective roles.  Ted Danson steals every scene he is in, and I believe that he delivers one of the best performances in the flick.  Roger Cross executes well as Barry, a security guard with a crush on Nina.  Christopher McDonald has a small but enjoyable role as the Cardigans' neighbor.  Adam Rothenberg plays the dim Bob, Jackie's husband and handles the role quite well.  One last mention deserves to go to Stephen Root who plays the head of the bank.  He, much like Danson, is a scene-stealer.What keeps ""Mad Money"" from being an excellent comedy seems to be a combination of the writing and the direction.  Glen Gers' screenplay lacks the punch necessary to keep this film from getting boring at times.  This left the actors with a weak script that, despite their best efforts, couldn't lift the the film from the lulls at times.  I also think that director Callie Khouri is also to blame.  Quicker pacing might have helped the film stay afloat.Overall, though, ""Mad Money"" isn't a bad film.  I rather enjoyed it, especially the moments that involved the trio of ladies planning their scheme and anything involving Danson.  It received a PG-13 rating for sexual material, brief language and brief drug references.  I feel that the sexual material referred to was particularly light (and funny) but not deserving of a PG-13 rating.

With a degree in comparative literature and no useful office skills, the only job she can get is as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank. However, once she sees the banks inner workings, Bridget hatches a plan to steal the money that is going out of circulation. With the help of the woman in charge of shredding the bills (Queen Latifah) and a woman who pushes around the carts of money (Katie Holmes), she steals an uncountable sum over the course of three years.Mad Money is a girl bonding film and it was completely entertaining from start to finish. It's obviously not going to win any Oscars, but I had a good time while I was watching it and even laughed out loud a few times, which is good enough for me. This story is just a fantasy come to life because everyone's thought about doing something crazy once in their life and this is the story of what happens when these women just went for it.

There, worn-out bills are taken (by Katie Holmes' character) to be shredded (by Queen Latifah's character).  Bridget comes up with a fool-proof plan with the other two ladies to take the money home instead of shredding it.  Who's to know?This movie is loosely based on an incident that occurred in England.  Despite the talented cast, I didn't like this movie.  I WANTED the women to get caught and punished.  Bridget's manic greediness went way past annoying and became offensive.  I hated her.  They lived in a mansion.  If they needed money, they could sell it.  And her husband could have gotten off the couch in almost two years and found a job, but he didn't.  I couldn't respect or like either of them.The characters aren't developed beyond a brief overview:  Bridget's a rich and spoiled, Holmes plays a drugged-out space cadet, and Latifah plays the world's best mother.  That's it; we never see them develop a friendship or any common ground except greed.  I did like Latifah's  character and thought Roger Cross (Curtis in24) was excellent as a kind-hearted security guard, but the hysterical pleasure the women take in breaking the law just rubbed me the wrong way.In the movie, someone asks, ""When you go to a bank, don't you think about stealing all the money?""

Johnson ""Three-time published author""","[1, 1]","The Fed has screwed America --- just ask financial experts such as Jim Cramer:Jim Cramer's Stay Mad for Life: Get Rich, Stay Rich (Make Your Kids Even Richer). So why shouldn't three ordinary women strike back a laThelma & Louise? There's no Brad Pitt in this movie, but there is the adorable Roger Cross as well as the convincingly slackerish Adam Rothenberg. It's definitely better than Diane Keaton's last film, ""Because I Said So,"" although Diane Keaton does get stuck with the upper-middle-class naive white woman shtick. She is, however, the mastermind as a janitor in the Federal Reserve of Kansis City. Queen Latifah excels in the sympathetic but predictable black-single-mom-holding-onto-her-kids role. Katie Holmes shows off just what she can do without Tom, and a potentially lackluster role such as the free-spirit-on-the-edge-of-society pops off the screen thanks to Katie throwing herself into the character as a typical twentysomething grooving to her iPod.The movie, written and directed by Callie Khouri, who masterminded ""Thelma and Louise,"" has some incisive social commentary inside the fantastic plot. The women (as well as their husbands and boyfriends) are stealing money that the fed has earmarked to be thrown away. While consumerism and debt aren't an excuse for what the three female masterminds cook up, they are a reality of our society. Queen Latifah's character never entirely gets seduced by materialism (buying a nicer house is as daring as she gets), which would have strenghtened the movie's point. One of the funniest moments involves Adam Rothenberg cavalierly discussing how he became a day trader and made seventeen percent on his investments---which is a teeny problem because the IRS is always watching you. Darn the Fed!This movie is pure fluff and mostly feel-good fantasy, with a DVD that only has commentary and a ""Making Of"" featurette.

She directed ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.""  In the DVD special features, she said that she wanted to make a funny movie.  This one is kind of funny.Diane Keaton won her Oscar in 1977 for ""Annie Hall"" and has been nominated for ""Reds,"" ""Marvin's Room,"" & ""Something's Gotta Give.""  She was not nominated for an Oscar for ""Mad Money,"" but it wasn't because she didn't try.  The scene where Mr. Arbogast comes into the bathroom and she thinks she's busted but blusters this crazy complaint about how people can't get their business in the toilet instead of around the toilet is hysterical.  It is a great comic moment.Queen Latifah was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Chicago"" in 2002.  Like Keaton, she also did not get another nomination for this film.  That doesn't mean she wasn't good in the film.  I particularly liked Diane Keaton's comment in the DVD featurette that I recall as something like, 'Queen Latifah is so good because she does anything you ask her to do.'  I enjoyed Latifah's Nina Brewster's relationship with her kids.  It seemed so real and affectionate.  It made the ending believable.Katie Holmes has never even once been nominated for an Oscar!  However, I did enjoy her performance inPhone Booth.  She was also in ""Batman Begins.""  Aside from a few wrinkles that made her look too old to be bopping around to music with her headphones, she did a pretty nice job.  Her wardrobe was pure trailer park chic.The men!  What can we say about the men?  Ted Danson from TV's ""Cheers"" & ""Becker"" had some good comic timing when he got his energy up.  Stephen Root from TV's ""NewsRadio"" & ""Leatherheads"" was such a sensitive guy, which made Latifah's ultimate attraction believable.  Newcomer Adam Rothenberg who follows this film with ""Tennessee"" with Mariah Carey looked good in the film and did a good job of seeming unintelligent.  Christopher McDonald who played the bank manager Bryce Arbogast was in two films I liked, ""Flubber"" & ""Lawn Dogs.""  His character part was played with bravado.The difficulty the story has is trying to make us root for people who are committing a crime.  They approach that by emphasizing that the money would have been destroyed anyway.  The flashback scenario also showed them being caught; so you watched the entire film waiting for them to be discovered.  This actually dulled the story for me rather than focused it.  This is neither the worst nor the best comic film you will ever see.  It's certainly worth an evening's viewing.

The movie, starring Diane Keaton, Katie Holmes, Queen Latifah, and Ted Danson respectively, is very enjoyable if you keep its light-hearted nature in mind.  This is a film about desperate measures and what people will do to maintain their current lifestyles, even if it requires crime.""Mad Money"" did remind me a lot ofFun with Dick and Janealthough I felt that that movie was far less silly and a little more believable.  This one was produced by an independent film company, which explains the slightly somber tone that it has, even though it isn't a very serious movie.  Both ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" and ""Mad Money"" revolve around people who are about to lose their comfortable lifestyles and go to desperate measures to obtain financial security, the difference is the people in ""Mad Money"" definitely have decent heads on their shoulders as opposed to ""Dick and Jane"" who come across as insane.The main highlight about the film was the sense of comrade that you get from the three lead characters.  Diana Keaton is fantastic as Bridgette, a women desperate to not become financially destitute.  Queen Latifah is fun, but a little underused as Nina, a single mother struggling to give her children a good life and education.  Even Katie surprised me in her role as Jackie, she plays an almost hippie free spirit type.  All three of these characters forge a deep bond, as they get deeper and deeper in to their crime.If I recommend this film for any reason, it would be on the strength of the performances and not on the strength of the story telling which is relatively weak.

I mean take a woman who wrote THELMA AND LOUISE, actresses that have starred in a number of hot hit films, toss them together and you would expect something fantastic. Unfortunately that doesn't happen with MAD MONEY.Admit it, it sounded good when you saw the previews. When you read about it you thought hey this could be nice. Be ready to be disappointed, but not overly so.The movie stars Diane Keaton as Bridget Cardigan, a well to do wife whose husband Don (Ted Danson) has just lost his job. Worse yet, she discovers that they are in debt far above anything she could imagine and are about to lose everything. To get by, she searches for a job and ends up getting one as a janitor at the nearby Federal Reserve where they destroy old and used bills.As she moves through the halls cleaning and wiping, told non stop by the bank's president Glover (Stephen Root) that they are watched at all times, she sees a weakness in the system that would allow a group to steal money from the bank unnoticed. But it will take more than one person to do so.She enlists the aid of two other women at the bank. One is Nina (Queen Latifah), a single mother trying to raise her two children to do better and have more, who actually shreds the cash. The other is Jackie (Katie Holmes), an apparently air headed worker who transports the money in glass cases from point to point. Once these two are on board, the plan kicks in.The girls get away with it, netting nearly $30,000 each the first time out. Keaton's home is saved, Latifah's kids get to go to the best school and Katie...well she gets to change a little. Danson protests what his wife is doing but resigns himself to the fact that it's taking care of the money problems they had. And Holme's hubby Bob (Adam Rothenberg) is more of an airhead than she even appears to be so he offers no complaints.Things begin to change with the amount of money that they heist. The more they take, the more they want. And one plot point that makes no sense is after seeing them do things like pay off the house, pay to send the kids to school and buy a new motor home, they suddenly decide they shouldn't spend the money for fear of being caught. Hello? You just spent how many thousands already, why are you concerned now?The latter part of the film deals with the girls near foul up at the bank and the realization that someone some where has caught on. Now it's about trying to avoid being caught. Toss in a romantic interest for Latifah in the form of bank guard Barry (24's Roger Cross) and you have a comedy that is light as a feather but with heart.The only problem is that it feels like an hour long TV episode rather than a full fledged feature film. I kept looking at the clock thinking shouldn't this be over soon only to realize it had another hour to go.The acting is there but little more. To me only Katie Holmes shined as the dingy chick who was smarter than anyone gives her credit for. Keaton and Latifah just move through the paces as good actors do, bringing nothing new to the screen.Yes, this movie is an enjoyable one that will entertain. No, it is not a movie that will live on in the memories of millions nor garner praise from critics world wide. For fans of the three leads, for fans of movies where women are empowered, this movie is for you. For al others, expect something light and you'll walk away happy.",3,IS THIS CALLED A TAX STIMULUS PACKAGE?,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3446,"['movies', 'sound', 'good', 'paper', 'sound', 'better', 'things', 'fall', 'place', 'mean', 'take', 'woman', 'who', 'wrote', 'THELMA', 'AND', 'LOUISE', 'have', 'starred', 'number', 'hot', 'hit', 'films', 'together', 'would', 'expect', 'something', 'fantastic', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'happen', 'MAD', 'MONEY.Admit', 'sounded', 'good', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'When', 'read', 'thought', 'hey', 'could', 'be', 'nice', 'Be', 'ready', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'overly', 'so.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Bridget', 'Cardigan', 'well', 'do', 'wife', 'husband', 'Don', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'just', 'lost', 'job', 'Worse', 'yet', 'are', 'debt', 'far', 'anything', 'could', 'imagine', 'are', 'lose', 'everything', 'get', 'job', 'up', 'getting', 'one', 'janitor', 'nearby', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'where', 'destroy', 'old', 'used', 'bills.As', 'halls', 'cleaning', 'wiping', 'told', 'non', 'stop', 'bank', 'president', 'Glover', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'are', 'watched', 'times', 'weakness', 'system', 'would', 'allow', 'group', 'steal', 'money', 'bank', 'unnoticed', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'do', 'so.She', 'aid', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'bank', 'One', 'Nina', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'single', 'mother', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'do', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'who', 'actually', 'cash', 'other', 'Jackie', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'apparently', 'air', 'headed', 'worker', 'who', 'money', 'glass', 'cases', 'point', 'point', 'two', 'are', 'board', 'plan', 'in.The', 'girls', 'get', 'away', 'netting', 'nearly', '30,000', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'Keaton', 'home', 'saved', 'Latifah', 'kids', 'get', 'go', 'best', 'school', 'Katie', 'well', 'change', 'little', 'Danson', 'what', 'wife', 'doing', 'fact', 'taking', 'care', 'money', 'problems', 'had', 'Holme', 'hubby', 'Bob', 'Adam', 'Rothenberg', 'more', 'airhead', 'even', 'be', 'so', 'complaints.Things', 'begin', 'change', 'amount', 'money', 'heist', 'more', 'take', 'more', 'want', 'one', 'plot', 'point', 'sense', 'seeing', 'do', 'things', 'pay', 'house', 'pay', 'send', 'kids', 'school', 'buy', 'new', 'motor', 'home', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'should', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'fear', 'being', 'caught', 'Hello', 'just', 'spent', 'how', 'many', 'thousands', 'already', 'why', 'are', 'concerned', 'now', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'deals', 'girls', 'foul', 'up', 'bank', 'realization', 'someone', 'where', 'caught', 'Now', 'trying', 'avoid', 'being', 'caught', 'Toss', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Latifah', 'form', 'bank', 'guard', 'Barry', '24', 'Roger', 'Cross', 'have', 'comedy', 'light', 'feather', 'heart.The', 'only', 'problem', 'hour', 'long', 'TV', 'episode', 'rather', 'full', 'fledged', 'feature', 'film', 'kept', 'looking', 'clock', 'thinking', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'soon', 'only', 'realize', 'had', 'hour', 'go.The', 'acting', 'little', 'more', 'only', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'shined', 'dingy', 'chick', 'who', 'was', 'smarter', 'anyone', 'credit', 'Keaton', 'Latifah', 'just', 'move', 'paces', 'good', 'actors', 'do', 'bringing', 'nothing', 'new', 'screen.Yes', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'will', 'entertain', 'No', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'live', 'memories', 'millions', 'garner', 'praise', 'critics', 'world', 'wide', 'fans', 'three', 'leads', 'fans', 'movies', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'empowered', 'movie', 'al', 'others', 'expect', 'something', 'light', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'happy']",N/A

Unfortunately, that answer is...not much.Mad Money is an absolutely unmemorable vehicle for a few recognizably named stars to pick up a nice little paycheck.  Nothing about it will incite the reviewer to smash the DVD into shards but it is not a movie that one will leap into the memory even if the objective is light, undemanding entertainment.  Diane Keaton seems to have found a niche in her post-fifty acting career and to her credit, she tends to get all that can be expected out of the same character mold movie after movie. Queen Latifah has arrived at a comfort level as well, however she has far too much talent to continue to accept these bootstrapping/struggle to enlightenment/modern paradigm stereotypical roles. Katie Holmes...well, she's still cute...and so is Ted Danson.So what we end up with is variation on a theme: Fun with Dick and Jane, How to beat the High Cost of Living, Thelma and Louise(adopt Pippi Longstocking), Mad Money.  All perfectly enjoyable movies but even in these often challenging economic times, sometimes the screenwriters ask for a suspension of disbelief that is beyond the sensibilities of the movie goer.While the title of this movie has multiple meanings, it's probably exactly what the producers told these actors they would be receiving for agreeing to participate in this project.",3,Recipe for mediocrity,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,1851,"['anyone', 'had', 'question', 'regarding', 'outcome', 'bringing', 'together', 'generally', 'appealing', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'multi-medium', 'performer', 'supplementing', 'reasonably', 'endearing', 'actress', 'who', 'gained', 'chops', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'television', 'drama', 'then', 'supporting', 'lead', 'actors', 'bevy', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'laudable', 'performances', 'plethora', 'programs', 'including', 'comedic', 'icon', 'one', 'best', 'situation', 'comedies', 'ever', 'answer', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'answer', 'not', 'much.Mad', 'Money', 'absolutely', 'unmemorable', 'vehicle', 'few', 'recognizably', 'named', 'stars', 'pick', 'up', 'nice', 'little', 'paycheck', 'Nothing', 'will', 'incite', 'reviewer', 'smash', 'DVD', 'shards', 'not', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'leap', 'memory', 'even', 'objective', 'light', 'undemanding', 'entertainment', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'have', 'found', 'niche', 'post-fifty', 'acting', 'career', 'credit', 'get', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'same', 'character', 'mold', 'movie', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'arrived', 'comfort', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'however', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'talent', 'continue', 'accept', 'bootstrapping/struggle', 'enlightenment/modern', 'paradigm', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'well', 'still', 'cute', 'so', 'Ted', 'Danson.So', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'variation', 'theme', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'How', 'beat', 'High', 'Cost', 'Living', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'adopt', 'Pippi', 'Longstocking', 'Mad', 'Money', 'perfectly', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'even', 'often', 'challenging', 'economic', 'times', 'sometimes', 'screenwriters', 'ask', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'sensibilities', 'movie', 'title', 'movie', 'multiple', 'meanings', 'probably', 'exactly', 'what', 'producers', 'told', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'receiving', 'agreeing', 'participate', 'project']",N/A
1141681,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0013ERFGE,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","Mad Money accomplishes its goal of treating a serious topic in such a light hearted way that you actually enjoy watching the film. The acting is extremely convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace. It held my attention every step of the way!The action starts when Bridget Cardigan (Diane Keaton) finds out that she and her husband Don (Ted Danson) have finally gone broke after a year of his being unemployed after a ""downsizing."" Bridget tries in desperation to find work until her former maid gives her a tip that the Federal Reserve Bank is hiring--janitors. Bridget goes from being a wealthy suburbanite to a bank janitor very quickly as she attempts to save the house she has with her husband Don.When she works at the bank, Bridget can't believe how much money she sees--and none of it, of course, is hers. They actually shred it! She soon concocts a plan to ""recycle"" some of the money and therefore steal it for herself and her husband. Yet Bridget knows she will need help; she can't do that big a job by herself. She eventually enlists ""space cadet"" Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes) who lives in a trailer with her husband Bob (Adam Rothenberg). She also gets help from an initially very reluctant Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah) who does the actual shredding of the money.It isn't long before the women successfully make their first robbery--they pull it off! They're just beginning to celebrate when Bridget's husband Don walks into the room and there's some pretty big explaining to do. Bridget, no matter what, eventually convinces everyone with her aggressive attacks that more heists are necessary for them to have ""what they want.""Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. What happens when a security guard finds out what these three women are doing--will he go along with them and join them or will he turn them in? What about Bridget's plans to spend the money--that doesn't sit well with Nina who wants it very inconspicuous that there's been any changes in their financial situations--will Bridget or Nina win the tug of war? What about the management of the bank and the people they call in as advisers about theft--will THEY catch on and find that these women are stealing? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out! The ending has a few plot twists that may surprise you!The DVD comes with a commentary; and you can watch it in either widescreen or full screen mode. There's also a cute but very brief ""making of"" featurette.Overall, while Mad Money is not exactly going to win best comedy of the year, it isn't bad either. I recommend this movie for a few light hearted laughs and the acting is splendid.

1141682,A22JG2WG04EJSL,B0013ERFGE,Matthew Moses,"[4, 6]","This was my in-flight movie selection on the way out to Seattle, and these are really the best [and only] circumstances under which this movie should be viewed.The movie begins with Diane Keaton as Bridget and Ted Danson as Don shredding money over the toilet as the FBI masses outside. Keaton escapes out the back, leaving her husband to be arrested. Elsewhere Queen Latifah as Nina burning money, and Katie Holmes as Jackie rigging her trailer to explode. Assuming that this is enough to interest its audience in the story, we then flash back three years.Bridget is an upper middle class skeleton living in a huge house and giving a simply delightful garden party, wherein she learns that her husband has put their house up for sale. He has lost his job and has been unable to find work. Bridget, quite accustomed to her lifestyle, goes on about how she cannot be without the finer things, and says that she will get a job. She has absolutely no skills, and after a montage of leadenly obnoxious calls to prospective employers, finally settles on a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank. We are invited to laugh at how horrible it is for a refined upper-crust woman to clean toilets and floors. I, for one, did not accept the invitation. Afterward Bridget goes to Home Depot, and discusses how much nicer consumer good look when they are on display. The movie is making gestures in the direction of satirizing an addiction to a consumerist lifestyle, but can't go through with it enough, lest we begin to dislike Bridget. More, of course, than we already do.I should also mention that when watching Mad Money on an airplane, and pulling out one's notebook to catch the subtle nuances and record them for later, one must be prepared to stand the incredulous stares of strangers seated next to one as they think ""WHY would this guy be taking NOTES on THIS?""Intercut with our action are strikingly avant-garde flash-forwards to all of the characters being interviewed by the FBI. Those not able to follow such cutting-edge narrative techniques are advised to steer well clear. Anyway, we see that Queen Latifah's Nina lives in a housing project with her two sons, one of whom brings home a list of weapons he is prohibited from bringing to school. Sign of the times, huh? Crazy world we live in. Also at the bank is Katie Holmes' Jackie, who goes around all day dancing to music in her headphones as she cleans and empties trash.Anyway, part of the women's jobs is shredding old currency that is being taken out of circulation. Bridget gets the idea to take the money, as no one will miss it, and approaches Nina and then Jackie with the idea. Jackie is a bad idea for a partner in crime from the start, evidenced most clearly when she jumps into the crime at once, with a perky ""Why not?"" Soon enough they've completed one round.Don finds out about it right away, and advises Bridget against doing it again, but they do anyway. Nina says all of them must not spend the money, as that will attract the attention of the law. Regardless, Bridget uses her money to buy a $62,000 diamond ring, despite the fact that we have earlier learned that they are $280,000 in debt and have no insurance. Yes, this is your ""likeable"" character, who is happy to let her husband work to earn money for her, but goes around buying expensive jewelry for herself when she comes upon a little cash. We are supposed to thrill to the tragedy of her loss when Nina flushes the ring down the toilet. Despite her own advice not to spend the money and draw attention, Nina pays for an entire year for her son at an expensive private school in advance and also indicates she will make a large donation. This action receives not examination, let alone criticism, because of course... well, you know.SPOILERS > > >God, I can't believe I'm still writing about this movie. Anyway, more and more people keep getting drawn in, and eventually some strange guy starts hanging around Bridget's house and getting a tour of the bank. He interviews the head of security at the bank, who would find the situation very uncomfortable if he were to have found to have failed his job so badly. At one point he says ""these are not white-collar people,"" indicating that as such they couldn't be capable of planning such an ingenious scheme. Blow struck for the working class? Well not really, when you realize that it took quite white-collar Bridget to think up the scheme.So we're back at the beginning, only this time we get to watch Jackie's trailer explode. They are indicted, and Jackie confesses on the condition that Latifah's Nina be granted immunity so she can be around to take care of those two kids! The sentiment itself is not nauseating, but the way the movie is ignorant of the sentimental clich&eacute;s it embodies--not to mention the way it uses it to deflect attention away from our characters' other serious moral deficiencies--is. The move ends in a way that requires that none of the characters suffer any consequences for their actions and no one has to do any examination of their characters. Which is how life should be, don't you think?&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDI honestly can't imagine the kind of person who would WANT to see this movie, but I do know that I don't want to know them. I do get a little chuckle out of the fact that we know poor Tom Cruise had to sit through it--one can imagine him gritting his teeth and trying to make nice. The problems are too many to enumerate, but early on I thought that Bridget was quite a surprisingly obnoxious character--and it occurred to me that the movie would have been considerably stronger if she was even MORE obnoxious. If she had been completely venal the movie could have developed a wicked sense of humor that would draw one in [a la The Devil Wears Prada] and--well, it would still suck, but at least it wouldn't be like a two hour-old bowl of Cream of Wheat.",1,Sorry excuse,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,5902,"['was', 'in-flight', 'movie', 'selection', 'way', 'Seattle', 'are', 'really', 'best', '[', 'only', ']',

Her husband Don (Ted Danson) lost his job when a multinational corporate buyout made him redundant.  Now, their home is going up for sale.  They're 280 thousand dollars in debt.  Don's on the couch unable to think of anything to do.And she's got to get a job.And as one of the personnel managers she visits states, ""People of your age in the workplace are a real pain...""Her former maid tells her she can clean up at the Federal Reserve Bank--as long as she doesn't have a criminal record.  Pretty soon after crafty Bridget is hired as a cleaning lady, she realizes how simple it would be to steal the old money that was being taken out of circulation--and it really wouldn't be theft, it would be 'recycling.'In order to do this, she needs two cohorts.  One who works in the transportation of carts of money and the other who works at the money shredder.Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah), a single Mom, is her choice for the shredder. Nina's not interested, til Bridget shows her a use for the money--getting her two young sons a better education.They both look for the transporter and choose Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes), a happy-go-lucky girl who dances around listening to music all the time.  They worry about the tracks on her arms--not realizing she's a Type I Diabetic.Pretty soon, the three of them are rolling in the dough.  Of course, problems arise.  Don isn't too fond of the idea of his wife stealing to support them.  Nina's forcing them to not spend the money, etc.The complications of dealing with bagloads of illicit money are fascinating. It's also interesting to see the three different types of criminals functioning:  Bridget's a grasping schemer, Nina's only doing what she's doing to give her kids a better life, and Jackie's just having fun.But all of them surprise you.Probably the most interesting aspects of this film are at the end.

This tale of three virtuous women who turn to a life of crime emerges as one of the better screwball comedies of recent vintage, thanks to a clever, snappy script by Glenn Kers, lively direction by Callie Khouri, and mega-delightful performances by Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, Ted Danson, Adam Rothenberg and Stephen Root.Keaton, who has rarely been better, plays Bridget Cardigan, an upper-middle class housewife whose husband (Danson) is suddenly laid off as a result of corporate downsizing.  When she lands a job as janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, she devises a scheme to steal some of the cash that has already been earmarked for destruction.  To accomplish her goal, she enlists the aid of two of the women who work there (Latifah and Holmes) who are also having trouble making ends meet.Out of this rather dubious premise, the filmmakers have spun pure comic gold, providing us with one hilarious scene after another as the women go from law-abiding citizens to master thieves to incarcerated suspects in the course of the story.  There are subtle little jabs at consumerism and the lure of the American dream along the way, but this is primarily a sharp, witty and sublimely silly spoof on all those innumerable heist pictures that have come our way over the years (I suggest we simply think of this as ""Ocean`s 14"" and have done with it).

Granted you can argue her lack of being able to put people in theater seats well predates her meeting her husband. First Daughter anyone? Not surprisingly her latest outing tanked at the box office debuting at a meager seventh place.That is not to say Mad Money (not to be confused with the Jim Cramer television show, which actually makes an appearance) is at all unwatchable. Holmes plays third banana to Diane Keaton (Father of the Bride) who is forced to get a job cleaning toilets at the Federal Reserve Bank when her husband gets fired. There she comes up with a plan to get back to living the upper class lifestyle she is used to by recycling the old and worn money about to be shredded for her own personal use.As the person actually doing the shredding, Queen Latifah (Bringing Down The House) if the first person she recruits with Holmes entering the fold later. Not to pile on Holmes, but she is the weak link in the trio as the flaky, free spirited character seemed to be more fitted for someone younger and with actual comedic timing.The movie really shines with its supporting cast. First there is Stephan Root as head of the bank playing a more serious Jimmy James. Ted Danson (Getting Even With Dad) gets plenty of laughs as Keaton's now unemployed husband. Finesse Mitchell, who Saturday Night Live should bring back to play Barak Obama, gets the most laughs as the guard that hits on every woman that goes through the metal detector. And even my big brother Shooter McGavin makes a way too short appearance.Unfortunately the movie starts off in the third act, one of my least favorite plot devises, with the main players being arrested before flashing back. But how they pull off the caper still is entertaining despite the miscast Holmes. Still they should have gotten caught well sooner than it happened because the movie ends up going about twenty minutes too long where you just think to yourself, go ahead and caught already.",4,No One Has Beat the System in a Hundred Years,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2140,"['Ever', 'infamous', 'couch', 'jumping', 'episode', 'incident', 'not', 'only', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'films', 'underperformed', 'also', 'had', 'negative', 'affect', 'reason', 'jumping', 'wife', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Granted', 'can', 'argue', 'lack', 'being', 'able', 'put', 'people', 'theater', 'seats', 'well', 'meeting', 'husband', 'First', 'Daughter', 'anyone', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'latest', 'outing', 'tanked', 'box', 'office', 'debuting', 'meager', 'seventh', 'place.That', 'not', 'say', 'Mad', 'Money', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Jim', 'Cramer', 'television', 'show', 'actually', 'appearance', 'unwatchable', 'Holmes', 'third', 'banana', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Father', 'Bride', 'who', 'forced', 'get', 'job', 'cleaning', 'toilets', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Bank', 'when', 'husband', 'fired', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'back', 'living', 'upper', 'class', 'lifestyle', 'used', 'recycling', 'old', 'worn', 'money', 'be', 'shredded', 'own', 'personal', 'person', 'actually', 'doing', 'shredding', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'first', 'person', 'Holmes', 'entering', 'fold', 'later', 'Not', 'pile', 'Holmes', 'weak', 'link', 'trio', 'flaky', 'free', 'spirited', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'fitted', 'someone', 'younger', 'actual', 'comedic', 'timing.The', 'movie', 'really', 'supporting', 'cast', 'First', 'Stephan', 'Root', 'head', 'bank', 'playing', 'more', 'serious', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Getting', 'Even', 'Dad', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'Keaton', 'now', 'unemployed', 'husband', 'Finesse', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'should', 'bring', 'back', 'play', 'Barak', 'Obama', 'most', 'laughs', 'guard', 'woman', 'metal', 'detector', 'even', 'big', 'brother', 'Shooter', 'McGavin', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'appearance.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'plot', 'devises', 'main', 'players', 'being', 'arrested', 'flashing', 'back', 'how', 'pull', 'caper', 'still', 'entertaining', 'miscast', 'Holmes', 'Still', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'caught', 'well', 'sooner', 'happened', 'movie', 'up', 'going', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'where', 'just', 'think', 'go', 'ahead', 'caught', 'already']",N/A

1141709,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B0013ERFGE,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","the actresses/actors were very good. loved seeing a woman mastermind a caper. my favorite scene was when the Diane Keaton character bought this beautiful ring with her ill-gotten gold after she'd promised to not buy any big ticket items (which, after she purchased it, makes her a liar as well as a thief). the impish glint in her eye as she gives in to temptation to try on the bauble shows why she is a master actress in her class: priceless. The Queen was solid, and Katie Holmes shows her comedic chops. Ted was good and the gentlemen playing Katie Holmes husband/boyfriend and Queen Latifah's boyfriend were too. I liked the story structure, and soundtrack music was very good.my only dislikes were:(1) the caricatured government bureaucrat - tired story convention having a stupid government employee, just lazy writing;(2) that a sane person like the Diane Keaton character would apparently have no problem stealing. the writer should've done a better job showing her do at least one sneaky thing before she decided to steal from the government which would've established her criminal tendencies or that she felt the rules did not apply to her (this would've strengthened the story though admittedly her character would've come off as a jerk, and probably made it harder for producers to get a star).  As written, having her decide to rob the government because she and her husband were enduring economic difficulty wasn't strong enough story-wise - she needed to be a rule breaker somewhere in her life before jumping in the deep end and stealing from the U.S. government. I mean couldn't they have shown her stealing a candy bar first or something?the writer established the economic dire straits she and her husband were in, and I understand usually law-abiding citizens will break the law under extreme duress, but stealing from the treasury without a hint of worry about getting caught just made her seem too out there, because in all other ways the writer established her as a normal upper middle class housewife: didn't mesh. I understand it was necessary for her to appear innocuous and to have no record to get the job, but as the story eventually revealed her to be this brilliant criminal mastermind capable of outmaneuvering the U.S. government without even breaking a sweat, the audience needed to be shown something, anything, before she did that to accept that she'd be capable of it. I mean where did that come from? Does a person wake up one morning a completely fearless and cocky criminal genius after decades working as a housewife? How in the world does she (believably) make that transition. This movie provides no bridge except financial necessity, which is too weak.Story gives us a middle age woman whose husband couldn't find a job and who was in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Said woman initially couldn't find a job and when she found one, she complained about the work, and then stole from her employer, with no guilt whatsoever, though her employer provided the health benefits she said she and her husband needed. Talk about ungrateful.  Only an accomplished comedian like Diane Keaton (and good writing of some minor characters, i.e., lady who interviews Diane for a job, and lady who trains her at the treasury) could make that work; and(3) unbelievable that these ordinary women with no previous history of theft would be able to successfully out-play the government with just a tax attorney hired on the fly.  In real life I think the women would've had not only the treasury department after them, and the IRS as presented, but the FBI, and who knows who all else. Very likely the anti-terrorist part of the government would've investigated them just to make sure there were no terrorist ties.  The women would've been in legal trouble for years and their families destroyed, not brought together through adversity, as portrayed in the film.and to have the Diane Keaton character smirk at the authorities as her lone attorney (in real life they'd have had a team of defense attorneys) outplayed (abit smugly) the government was totally unbelievable; she'd have been terrified of going to prison for many years. And with regards to that smirk, the officers would've pursued her for that alone, given she'd been robbing the government for years and was clearly unrepentant.and the kindly detective interrogating the other members of the crew at the police station, who reassuringly told the Queen Latifah character that she'd basically been let off the hook when the Katie Holmes character obligingly decided to accept responsibility for the crimes - do officers do that? I mean be so concerned about a criminal's psychological well-being that they'd seek to spare a bank robber the unnecessary worry about the possibility of losing custody of their children?  Uh, no. An officer's job in that situation would be to lean, lean, lean on the criminal, to apply as much pressure as possible to make them confess to the crime, not to hold their hand or attempt to comfort them (unless they were playing good cop/bad cop as has been presented in other films, and I only saw one questioner in the sequence so the writers weren't trying for that).I believe there are many honorable officers in this country, but on a weekly basis you can read about some, who, shall we say focus on the punitive side of their job. The detective as written was just too kind to be believable. Also, would a regular police detective be interrogating the perps? Wouldn't the FBI do that? I believe the robbers were stealing from the federal government, so the feds would be overseeing this case. The policing officers were far too weak in this story to be believable, as if they didn't have a zillion laws (and prosecutors) backing them up.it's these chinks in storytelling, the mistakes writers make in (I guess) trying to have an actor appear heroic (in this case the Katie Holmes' character), that is so unbelievable it pushes me right out of the story. I like Katie Holmes' acting in this story, she plays an airhead and I don't mind that she wanted to be a hero, but I dislike the way the writer did it here because it's so unbelievable given what an officer's job would be in that situation in real life.a story only works if the character's behavior and the audience behavioral rules operate in the same reality. The film is based on a true story which took place in England, but even there one person went to prison.I still like the film, mostly because of the outstanding acting of the six leads and it's good to see women actors headlining a film, and also because as a poor person it's fun to see ordinary characters with tons of money being able to buy whatever they want, especially in these hard economic times. The negative was having the villains win, but it was presented so unbelievably that there was no way to take the story seriously. Three and a half stars.P.S. Wish we'd get more women power stories. Don't mind women villains, very much like them in fact, but prefer a more believable story. Oh well. The ladies did a nice job.

1141710,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B0013ERFGE,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[1, 1]","Intentional or not, this crime caper film has an air of immediacy to it as it deals with issues arising from our current state of (shhhh!) recession.  Opening with the layoff and subsequent depression of newly unemployed Don Cardigan (Ted Danson), we see the turmoil of a middle-aged couple having to come to grips with suddenly not being able to maintain their status of living.  As such, Bridget Cardigan (Diana Keaton) decides she will need to join the workforce for the first time in her life.  The opening segments of the film setting this up and showing her series of job interviews immediately draws you in.  We are quickly on Keaton's side as she struggles to find a place to just make a buck or two!Finally she lands a job at the Federal Reserve as a janitor.  Not so glorious - but before long she begins to wonder about all that money around her!  She soon learns about the daily destruction of inactive money, and hatches a scheme to steal it.  In her mind, the money is going to be destroyed anyway, so it ""technically"" isn't stealing - it's just removing something from the trash!  That little moral issue aside, she begins looking for accomplices, which ultimately leads to Nina Brewster (Latifah) and Jackie Truman (Holmes).  The three figure out a way to lift the money right out from under the noses of their employers.  All this leading up to the first heist is intriguing and enjoyable to watch.The problem, however, is that this first heist occurs midway through the film, and once it has come and gone,  the screenwriters suddenly seem out of ideas.  The second half of the film basically just bides it's time with the girls repeatedly pulling off the heist until it reaches the 90- minute mark.  I found myself preparing for any number of certain twists and turns, but none of these ever came.  The second half of the film plays out by the numbers and ends on a less than thrilling note.  In the end, what's on the screen is fine, but it's what is missing that could have been so much more!Performances are largely on track.  Keaton's usual lovable yet slightly neurotic style is in full force - Latifah continues to find roles that let her play wise and likable - and Holmes is essentially the airhead of the troupe.  Danson is mainly a side character here.  Yet even with a female led cast, the film never quite feels like a simple chick-flick or made for Lifetime movie - I'll give it that.  But in the end, it was missing a certain attitude or bite that made director Callie Khouri's screenplay for THELMA AND LOUISE so memorable.Bottom Line:  You won't hate yourself for watching it, but you will quickly forget about it once it is over.",3,"It's not a loser, but it isn't breaking any new ground either.",1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,2665,"['Intentional', 'not', 'crime', 'caper', 'film', 'air', 'immediacy', 'issues', 'arising', 'current', 'state', 'shhhh', 'recession', 'Opening', 'layoff', 'subsequent', 'depression', 'newly', 'unemployed', 'Don', 'Cardigan', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'see', 'turmoil', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'having', 'come', 'grips', 'suddenly', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'maintain', 'status', 'living', 'such', 'Bridget', 'Cardigan', 'Diana', 'Keaton', 'will', 'need', 'join', 'workforce', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'opening', 'segments', 'film', 'setting', 'up', 'showing', 'series', 'job', 'interviews', 'immediately', 'draws', 'are', 'quickly', 'Keaton', 'side', 'find', 'place', 'just', 'make', 'buck', 'two', 'Finally', 'job', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'janitor', 'Not', 'so', 'glorious', 'long', 'wonder', 'money', 'soon', 'daily', 'destruction', 'inactive', 'money', 'scheme', 'steal', 'mind', 'money', 'going', 'be', 'destroyed', 'anyway', 'technically', ""n't"", 'stealing', 'just', 'removing', 'something', 'trash', 'little', 'moral', 'issue', 'aside', 'looking', 'accomplices', 'ultimately', 'Nina', 'Brewster', 'Latifah', 'Jackie', 'Truman', 'Holmes', 'three', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'lift', 'money', 'right', 'noses', 'employers', 'leading', 'up', 'first', 'heist', 'intriguing', 'enjoyable', 'watch.The', 'problem', 'however', 'first', 'heist', 'midway', 'film', 'once', 'come', 'gone', 'screenwriters', 'suddenly', 'seem', 'ideas', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'basically', 'just', 'time', 'girls', 'repeatedly', 'pulling', 'off', 'heist', '90-', 'minute', 'mark', 'found', 'preparing', 'number', 'certain', 'twists', 'turns', 'none', 'ever', 'came', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'out', 'numbers', 'less', 'thrilling', 'note', 'end', 'what', 'screen', 'fine', 'what', 'missing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Performances', 'are', 'largely', 'track', 'Keaton', 'usual', 'lovable', 'yet', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'style', 'full', 'force', 'Latifah', 'find', 'roles', 'let', 'play', 'wise', 'likable', 'Holmes', 'essentially', 'airhead', 'troupe', 'Danson', 'mainly', 'side', 'character', 'here', 'even', 'female', 'led', 'cast', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'feels', 'simple', 'chick-flick', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'end', 'was', 'missing', 'certain', 'attitude', 'bite', 'made', 'director', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'screenplay', 'THELMA', 'AND', 'LOUISE', 'so', 'memorable.Bottom', 'Line', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hate', 'watching', 'will', 'quickly', 'forget']",N/A

1141712,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B0013ERFGE,TheBandit,"[2, 2]","""Mad Money"" was directed by Callie Khouri - a name I recognized, of course, as the writer of the classic ""Thelma and Louise.""  I didn't know her from anything else, and after a quick perusal of her filmography I understood why.  ""Mad Money"" is only the third film she has directed (including one TV movie).  As a screenwriter she has been only slightly more prolific - with four credits to her name since 1991.That said, I like ""Thelma and Louise"" so much that I had somewhat high hopes for ""Mad Money.""  That they weren't met doesn't mean I wasn't entertained.  It was just surprising to me how superficial is was.  Maybe the fact that Khouri didn't write it had something to do with how lightweight the movie is.  Whatever the case, ""Mad Money"" is a frequently funny bit of cinematic cotton candy.  Don't expect to reminisce about how great it was by any means - just enjoy it while it in the moment.  I doubt I'll feel the need to revisit the movie anytime soon.Diane Keaton and Ted Danson are a married couple who have fallen on tough times, relatively speaking.  They are most defintely upper-class, but Danson's character has lost his job and he doesn't want to settle for anything less than what he was making.  So his wife (Keaton) must find work - and she does, in the janitorial department of a federal reserve bank.  She quickly devises a plot to steal retired currency before it reaches the industrial-size shredder.  For assistance she recruits two co-workers played by Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes.  Latifah is a working-class single mom and Holmes is a flighty twentysomething.The movie could've developed all three of these primary characters much better.  I didn't feel like I knew or related to them in any way.  Katie Holmes's character in particular is unsympathetic - she's a ditz!  It doesn't help much that Holmes isn't very believable in the role.  She comes across as an intelligent person attempting to ""play dumb"" rather than truly inhabiting the part.  Latifah fares better - instilling her character with an endearing earthiness.  But Keaton - a comedy pro who acquits herself just fine - turns in the best performance despite having the least likely character.  How does a woman like this think she can get away with this major crime?  More to the point, why did the filmmakers think the audience would even root for her?  At least Latifah's character is struggling to put food on her kid's table.  Keaton and Danson are merely trying to restore their income level to their previous high standard.Don't think about it too much and you will likely have a pleasant time-passer with this one.",3,"Featherweight entertainment, but enjoyable",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,2621,"['Mad', 'Money', 'was', 'directed', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'name', 'recognized', 'course', 'writer', 'classic', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'else', 'quick', 'perusal', 'filmography', 'understood', 'why', 'Mad', 'Money', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'directed', 'including', 'one', 'TV', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'been', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'prolific', 'four', 'credits', 'name', '1991.That', 'said', 'like', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'somewhat', 'high', 'hopes', 'Mad', 'Money', 'were', ""n't"", 'met', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertained', 'was', 'just', 'surprising', 'how', 'superficial', 'was', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'Khouri', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'how', 'lightweight', 'movie', 'case', 'Mad', 'Money', 'frequently', 'funny', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'cotton', 'candy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'reminisce', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'means', 'just', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'need', 'revisit', 'movie', 'anytime', 'soon.Diane', 'Keaton', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'tough', 'times', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'are', 'most', 'defintely', 'upper-class', 'Danson', 'character', 'lost', 'job', ""n't"", 'want', 'settle', 'anything', 'less', 'what', 'was', 'making', 'wife', 'Keaton', 'must', 'find', 'work', 'janitorial', 'department', 'federal', 'reserve', 'bank', 'quickly', 'plot', 'steal', 'retired', 'currency', 'industrial-size', 'shredder', 'assistance', 'two', 'co-workers', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Latifah', 'working-class', 'single', 'mom', 'Holmes', 'flighty', 'twentysomething.The', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'three', 'primary', 'characters', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'knew', 'related', 'way', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'particular', 'unsympathetic', 'ditz', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'Holmes', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'across', 'intelligent', 'person', 'attempting', 'play', 'dumb', 'rather', 'truly', 'inhabiting', 'part', 'Latifah', 'better', 'instilling', 'character', 'endearing', 'earthiness', 'Keaton', 'comedy', 'pro', 'who', 'just', 'fine', 'turns', 'best', 'performance', 'having', 'least', 'likely', 'character', 'How', 'woman', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'major', 'crime', 'More', 'point', 'why', 'did', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'audience', 'would', 'even', 'root', 'least', 'Latifah', 'character', 'struggling', 'put', 'food', 'kid', 'table', 'Keaton', 'Danson', 'are', 'merely', 'trying', 'restore', 'income', 'level', 'previous', 'high', 'standard.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'pleasant', 'time-passer', 'one']",N/A

1141714,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0013ERFGE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 16]","January is a dumping ground for films studios have no confidence in. As they roll out their Oscar hopefuls to more and more screens, theaters have a certain number of screens to fill while the studios concentrate their efforts on getting ""Atonement"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" as many Oscar nods as possible. They release films like ""One Last Call"", ""Rambo"" and ""Mad Money"" hoping to eke a few dollars out of unsuspecting movie goers. While I can't subject myself to films like ""One Last Call"" or ""Rambo"", I had a faint hope the combination of Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah and Callie Khouri might yield an unexpected surprise.""Mad Money"", the new film from first time director Callie Khouri (writer of ""Thelma and Louise"") is being released in January. Nuff said. That studio managed to get a portion of the $8.75 I spent to see this film at a matinee. That is $8.75 and 100 minutes I will never get back.Let's start with the worst and work our way up to the `best'. In the case of ""Mad Money"", the best is like getting poked with a rusty nail twice and you only get tetanus once.Katie Holmes plays Jackie Truman, a young woman who works at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. She spends every day moving carts of old money from one floor to the next. This might sound like a mind numbingly boring job, and it is, but Jackie spends every moment with her walkman headphones on and is happy to bop to the music playing in her head as she completes this boring job. She shimmies and shakes and looks vaguely like Mata Hari. Or a woman experiencing epileptic convulsions.Jackie isn't too smart. Her husband, Bob (Adam Rottenberg) works at a meatpacking plant, they live in a trailer, but they are in love. This seems to be Khouri and screenwriter Glenn Gers attempt to show how three very different women can become involved in the same crime. Jackie and Bob represent the dumb, white trash element of society. See, Bob isn't smart and doesn't know the meaning of words and doesn't completely understand everything. Jackie is no better. When they manage to get the headphones off, she has a weird grin on her face, like everything is slowly making sense, or she is recovering from a stroke. Jackie seems designed to be very dumb. But really, this is the worst stereotype of a lower class Caucasian. The cheap white trash jokes abound. When they start to get some payoff from their activities, the first thing Jackie and Bob do is buy a bigger trailer. Har har har. Not funny or very original for that matter. The woman who wrote ""Thelma and Louise"" thought this was funny and worthy of her time?When Bridget (Diane Keaton) comes up with her plan, she recruits Nina (Queen Latifah) and they look for another person, eventually settling on Jackie. Once they decide to include her, they immediately assume she is using drugs (a fair assumption as needles fall out of her purse), but Jackie does nothing to dissuade them, even though it isn't true, finding it comforting they care enough to intervene on her behalf. Huh?Actually, perhaps Mrs. Cruise isn't the worst thing about this film. The more I think about it, the more I keep returning to Callie Khouri. Khouri, one of the most respected screenwriters in Hollywood, has waited a long time to direct her first film. And she chooses ""Mad Money""? The film isn't funny enough, smart enough or interesting enough to carry her name. Khouri practically redefined the buddy movie with her first screenplay so why would she deign to work on this film? I understand things are tough in Hollywood, but she should do what many other writer - directors have done. Write a screenplay everyone wants and attach yourself as a director. If they won't let you direct, don't sell the screenplay. It's worked for others. It can work for Khouri. But instead, she chose to direct someone else's screenplay and the film is little better than a made for cable movie. A made for the Hallmark Channel cable movie.Bridget (Keaton) is trying to help her husband Don (Ted Danson, so much for the terrific notices he earned for his work on ""Damages"") through his unemployment. But one day, she learns Don has put the house up for sale; things are that bad. Bridget decides to get a job and ends up working at the Federal Reserve Bank, cleaning the bathrooms and emptying the garbage. Her boss (Stephen Root) goes around trying to intimidate the employees saying things like ""I watch everything"" and ""There has never been a robbery at the Federal Reserve"". Then Bridget gets an idea, but she will need help. She approaches Nina (Latifah), a single mom with two kids, who is initially reluctant, but when she sees the beauty of the plan, she decides to go ahead. Then, they recruit Jackie. After their first job, they realize how easy this is going to be and continue, no one is the wiser until Don walks in on the three women (literally) throwing the money around. Soon, Bob is involved and they recruit one of the guards (Roger Cross, Curtis on TV's ""24"") who has a crush on Nina. How nice and symmetrical. Everyone has a partner and they are pretty much exactly alike, class, race and intelligence. How sweet.One of the major problems with ""Money"" is that Khouri and Gers want it to be a caper film, but it just doesn't have enough edge. There is never any hint of real danger to this crew of women. And they are painted so broad and artificially it almost seems like we are watching a 1950s sitcom. A bad 1950s sitcom.Diane Keaton has done some amazing work on film. She has also made some very bad choices. ""Mad Money"" would have to be classified as the latter. There are a couple of moments, early in the film, when Bridget begins to realize the extent of her money problems, when you think there might be something here. There are some nice observations and some interesting moments as Bridget has to deal with things like paying the maid and dealing with her upper-class friends. But these moments are short-lived. As soon as she starts working at the Federal Reserve, there is never a moment when she appears natural, or human, and we just fail to connect with her character.Every time Bridget is startled, and this happens frequently, she is trying to rob a bank after all, she begins flapping her heads and moving her head rapidly, much like a chicken with it's head cut off. This is a trademark Keaton move, and is usually funny at least once. But when she does it repeatedly, it wears thin real fast. Worse, it is supposed to be funny and it just seems tired.Queen Latifah is, as usual, the best thing in the film. She appears to make an honest effort to make Nina a real person. As she struggles with the idea of participating in Bridget's plan, she has real concerns about it. A single mother of two, she knows she has to do everything to care for them. She can't jeopardize their well being for a moment. In fact, she only becomes sold on the plan when it occurs to her she can send her kids to a better school and buy a small house with the money they will steal. I know, twisted logic, but at least she thinks about it and doesn't run around waving her arms in  the air as she does it.I sort of wish ""Mad Money"" had been released last year, so I could include it on my Worst of the Year list. As it is, I'll have to wait a long time before I can include it on my list for 2008. Don't worry. I'll remember it. I'll remember the wasted $8.75 and 100 minutes of my life.",1,"I""m ""Mad"" That I Wasted My ""Money""",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,7407,"['January', 'dumping', 'ground', 'films', 'studios', 'have',

Having not worked in years, the only job opening she is able to find is the janitor at a Federal Reserve Bank. As she watches the shredding of worn out bills day in and day out, she concocts a plan.However for her plan to work she needs two people to help her, and before long she solicits their help. They are Nina (played by Queen Latifah) the shredder, and Jackie (played by Katie Holmes) the carrier. As everything goes according to plan they start smuggling out hoards of cash and before long they have everything they could want...except for more. As they keep taking more, their actions catch the eye of the IRS, and their perfect plan starts spiraling out of control.No, it doesn't have the intensely, complicated wit of other heist movies like the Oceans 11-13 or The Italian Job, but it is fiendishly entertaining. How nice to just sit back and enjoy this as entertainment, rather than try and figure out or follow all the intricate plot twists of other crime films.It is refreshing to see a more ""feminist"" film from Hollywood, with all three leads as well as the director being women. I always wonder if women ever get annoyed at the lack of female lead roles in Hollywood films (especially since Jodie Foster only makes one film per year!).All three actresses have great chemistry, and do well on their own. Diane Keaton is the queen of comic (yet not over-the-top) acting, Queen Latifah is sensible and sophisticated, and Katie Holmes morphs back into a teenage-twenty-something with flair.This is an simple, enjoyable crime romp, with a great script that is just MAD FUN!",4,MAD FUN!,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2028,"['Diane', 'Keaton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'screenwriter', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'come', 'together', 'so', 'perfectly', 'entertaining', 'crime', 'adventure.Bridget', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'wife', 'laid-off', 'corporate', 'manager', 'Don', 'played', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'downsizing', 'selling', 'beautiful', 'house', 'living', 'simpler', 'etc', 'job', 'desperately', 'keep', 'respective', 'status', 'Having', 'not', 'worked', 'years', 'only', 'job', 'opening', 'able', 'find', 'janitor', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Bank', 'shredding', 'worn', 'out', 'bills', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'plan.However', 'plan', 'work', 'two', 'people', 'help', 'long', 'help', 'are', 'Nina', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'shredder', 'Jackie', 'played', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'carrier', 'everything', 'according', 'plan', 'start', 'smuggling', 'out', 'hoards', 'cash', 'long', 'have', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'more', 'keep', 'taking', 'more', 'actions', 'catch', 'eye', 'IRS', 'perfect', 'plan', 'spiraling', 'control.No', ""n't"", 'have', 'intensely', 'complicated', 'wit', 'other', 'heist', 'movies', 'Oceans', '11-13', 'Italian', 'Job', 'fiendishly', 'entertaining', 'How', 'nice', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'entertainment', 'rather', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'follow', 'intricate', 'plot', 'twists', 'other', 'crime', 'films.It', 'refreshing', 'see', 'more', 'feminist', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'three', 'leads', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'being', 'women', 'always', 'wonder', 'women', 'ever', 'get', 'annoyed', 'lack', 'female', 'lead', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'especially', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'year', '.All', 'three', 'actresses', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'do', 'well', 'own', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'queen', 'comic', 'yet', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'sensible', 'sophisticated', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'morphs', 'back', 'teenage-twenty-something', 'flair.This', 'simple', 'enjoyable', 'crime', 'romp', 'great', 'script', 'just', 'MAD', 'FUN']",N/A

Three women (Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah and Kate Holmes)do something about it. Faced with losing her house and working a humilating job as a women's janitor after her husband (Ted Danson)loses his job, Bridget Cardigan (Keaton) approaches her two new co-workers that work at the Federal Reserve destroying old, worn out money to ""recycle"" the cash in a way they can all benefit from it.""Mad Money"" has a good pedigree but even with a good pedigree sometimes a worthless mutt will show up in the litter. Director Callie Khouri (the writer of ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood"") does a good job of working with the actors. The film just doesn't have much to it. ""Mad Money"" wants to be a kooky caper film but lacks the elements of humor that makes the best within that genre work so well. Imagine, say, ""Ocean's 11"" with women pulling the scam and you'll get an idea of the potential of this film.Keaton is quite good as is the rest of the main and supporting cast. The film just doesn't gel even with the awesome cast and talent behind the camera. It happens. ""Mad Money"" isn't necessarily a bad film just uninspired and predictable at every turn. I just didn't care about the characters or their woes and that's essential in a film like this. Khouri insures that the film looks good and her direction is smooth as silk but silk can be slippery and sadly nothing funny sticks to the silky material we're given here.The DVD transfer looks and sounds quite good.The DVD has some nice extras for fans including a feature length audio commentary by the director where she discusses the British TV movie that was the inspiration for this film. We also get a solid behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the film as well as the theatrical trailer.""Mad Money"" doesn't quite pay off in the end. While there are all the right elements for a delightful caper film here, the comedy just doesn't work and the characters aren't all that involving.
