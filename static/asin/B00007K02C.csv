729977,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00007K02C,atmj,"[2, 2]","Okay, if you like this movie, don't read this review and remember it is my opinion.Some really high powered actors are found in this movie. It is a movie within a movie.  You see an interview taking place that is really part of the movie and then you see the character's real lives.The line from movie to &quot;reality&quot; gets blurred.  However the use of video quality scenes versus the kind generally used in Hollywood movies helps provide the definition of which is which.There are several characters.  Focal to this movie in primarily name only is Gus.  All the players are planning (except for one) to go to a birthday party in his honor in the near future.A young black actor, who in the movie plays second fiddle to a well known actor.An actress who plays a reporter.A VP of Human resources that is nearly a basket case.The sister of the VP of Human resources, who is also massage therapist, who has a unique connection to the birthday boy.  She also plans on meeting a blind date from the internet soon.A director of the movie, who's life is falling apart.  It is pretty obvious why, with his victim mentality.The director's partner, who does off Hollywood plays as well as producing this movie and hopes to meet a blind date on the internet.All these characters are played by well-known actors in this self-obsessed movie.  The only point is our moods and actions are so dependent on our sense of safety.I can't say I found this movie entertaining, but only mildly diverting and for the most part pointless.

I do not care for excessive profanity, partially due to personal convictions, but also due to what repetitive profanity represents artistically--a lazy vocabulary.  Passion and anger and shock and dejection and even annoyance cannot effectively receive proper expression by the same handful of vulgarities.  In this story in particular, characterization is blurred by poorly articulated emotions.Tenderness which peaks out during the final scenes might have resonated more richly had the script employed more creative lines and less repetion of a generic shock-word which typically dulled the audience's comprehension of a character's motives and intentions.Nearly all actors involved served their parts well.  Julia Roberts' role seemed underdeveloped (not her fault), and Nicky the Nazi felt cartoonish and tacked onto the otherwise love and lust driven plot.Filming technique enhanced more than it detracted.  Music was generally apropos.  The varying storylines intersected well, and the concise production length enabled the viewer's sufficient emotional investment in each tale.",3,"diluted tenderness, lazy vocabulary",1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,1206,"['When', 'script', 'f-word', 'ten', 'times', 'scene', 'traffic', 'light', 'find', 'wanting', 'beam', 'thesaurus', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'excessive', 'profanity', 'partially', 'due', 'personal', 'convictions', 'also', 'due', 'what', 'repetitive', 'profanity', 'artistically', 'lazy', 'vocabulary', 'Passion', 'anger', 'shock', 'dejection', 'even', 'annoyance', 'can', 'not', 'effectively', 'receive', 'proper', 'expression', 'same', 'handful', 'vulgarities', 'story', 'particular', 'characterization', 'blurred', 'poorly', 'articulated', 'emotions.Tenderness', 'out', 'final', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'resonated', 'more', 'richly', 'had', 'script', 'employed', 'more', 'creative', 'lines', 'less', 'repetion', 'generic', 'shock-word', 'typically', 'dulled', 'audience', 'comprehension', 'character', 'motives', 'intentions.Nearly', 'actors', 'involved', 'served', 'parts', 'well', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'role', 'seemed', 'underdeveloped', 'not', 'fault', 'Nicky', 'Nazi', 'felt', 'cartoonish', 'tacked', 'otherwise', 'love', 'lust', 'driven', 'plot.Filming', 'technique', 'enhanced', 'more', 'detracted', 'Music', 'was', 'generally', 'apropos', 'varying', 'storylines', 'intersected', 'well', 'concise', 'production', 'length', 'enabled', 'viewer', 'sufficient', 'emotional', 'investment', 'tale']",Full Frontal
729979,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B00007K02C,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[5, 7]","Full Frontal is a difficult movie to watch and to fully understand on its first viewing. With patience and careful listening this movie opens outward like an onion as layer upon layer begins to emerge. This is the movie quotes Soderbergh that Woody Allen would have made if he moved west and dropped a lot of acid. That may or may not be the case.What Full Frontal is is a carefully crafted exploration of Hollywood relationships. In its format it reminded me a little of Robert Altman's Short Cuts in that we have multiple storylines with the same characters. Also we have a movie within a movie within yet another movie. If this all sounds confusing it is. But go along with the premise and it becomes enjoyable.This is a fine ensemble piece with some of Hollywood's biggest stars: Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood, David Hyde Pierce,Catherine Keener, and Mary McCormack. The film , or rather multiple films chronicle the relationships between the characters leading up to the 40th birthday of movie producer, Gus Delario (David Duchovny).The film shot both in 35mm and grainy DV presents challenges to its viewers and may be one of the more intelligent films of last year and is well worth a viewing or two.The DVD presents the film and a large group of extras tht really add to the presentation. There are the usual director and screenwriter commentaries, on camera in character interviews with the cast, deleted scenes, spy cam shots and an interview ith Soderbergh.

729980,A2VZ11U5DXM8J5,B00007K02C,"C. Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[1, 3]","I know of a guy who, when he hit forty, went through a divorce.  His response was to go back to college, literally.  He walked away from the big bank job and everything else and started living as a 21-year-old all over again.  Steven Soderbergh reminds me of that guy.  Having made ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich,"" it's like he decided to go back to college and make an edgy--and what student does not want edgy?--film on a film student's budget.  I don't know what happened to the banker, but I know what happened to Soderbergh: he made ""Full Frontal,"" and it succeeds more than half but not entirely.The effort has a lot of fine parts but the whole does not do them justice.  This is a ""day in the life of"" dash between interrelated lives and the daisy chain of events that connects them; mostly they are held together by the shared experience of living in LA and working either in one of the media or in the fringes.  David Hyde Pierce is extraordinary as a writer faced with an array of serious losses in this single day, unaware of one more that hangs in the balance.  He is the moral touchstone in a town and film where soul is an endangered species.  David Duchovny is the dark angel, a producer turning 40 in a town where that is a risky move.  Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood come off as rather plastic, kind of slumming it with the indie crowd, but appropriately their story line is that of characters who are revealed to be in a film within a film about an actor in a television show, etc., etc.  Catherine Keener careens throughout like a pinball spiked by the worst essences of LA., and as grating as she is at first, much comes to depend on how she will make it through the day.  Nicky Katt's storyline is barely tacked on, but he makes the most of it as a small-time stage actor who has wisely not quit his day job.The biggest problem in this project is the smugness in which Soderbergh revels as he deploys indie conventions that are no longer that special: grainy, choppy film; jumpy hand-held cameras; zoom shots that are engaged like someone hitting the accelerator instead of the brakes; location shots in all low-ceiling spaces; and the assumption that regular people use words that can't be said on television as routine discourse.  It's kind of like he went out and bought jeans that were already worn and had rips in them, somebody else's jeans.",3,Excellent Parts Dampered By Whole,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2371,"['know', 'guy', 'who', 'when', 'hit', 'forty', 'went', 'divorce', 'response', 'was', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'literally', 'walked', 'away', 'big', 'bank', 'job', 'everything', 'else', 'started', 'living', '21-year-old', 'over', 'again', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'guy', 'Having', 'made', 'Traffic', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'make', 'edgy', 'what', 'student', 'not', 'want', 'edgy', 'film', 'film', 'student', 'budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'banker', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Soderbergh', 'made', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'more', 'half', 'not', 'entirely.The', 'effort', 'lot', 'fine', 'parts', 'whole', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'day', 'life', 'dash', 'interrelated', 'lives', 'daisy', 'chain', 'events', 'mostly', 'are', 'held', 'together', 'shared', 'experience', 'living', 'LA', 'working', 'either', 'one', 'media', 'fringes', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'extraordinary', 'writer', 'faced', 'array', 'serious', 'losses', 'single', 'day', 'unaware', 'one', 'more', 'balance', 'moral', 'touchstone', 'town', 'film', 'where', 'soul', 'endangered', 'species', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'dark', 'angel', 'producer', 'turning', '40', 'town', 'where', 'risky', 'move', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'plastic', 'kind', 'slumming', 'indie', 'crowd', 'appropriately', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'film', 'film', 'actor', 'television', 'show', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'pinball', 'spiked', 'worst', 'essences', 'LA.', 'as', 'grating', 'first', 'much', 'depend', 'how', 'will', 'make', 'day', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'storyline', 'barely', 'tacked', 'most', 'small-time', 'stage', 'actor', 'who', 'wisely', 'not', 'quit', 'day', 'job.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'project', 'smugness', 'Soderbergh', 'revels', 'indie', 'conventions', 'are', 'longer', 'special', 'grainy', 'choppy', 'film', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'zoom', 'shots', 'are', 'engaged', 'someone', 'hitting', 'accelerator', 'instead', 'brakes', 'location', 'shots', 'low-ceiling', 'spaces', 'assumption', 'regular', 'people', 'use', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'television', 'routine', 'discourse', 'kind', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'jeans', 'were', 'already', 'worn', 'had', 'rips', 'somebody', 'else', 'jeans']",Full Frontal

Director Soderbergh is in a unique position to retain indie ""cred"" (""Schizopolis"", ""The Limey"") AND pump out box office hits (""Erin Brockovich"", ""Traffic"") that earn him the freedom to do more personal projects. ""Full Frontal"" falls somewhere between ""Welcome To L.A."" and ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" with its movie-within-a movie structure and self-absorbed Angeleans. Good performances abound, particularly from David-Hyde-Pierce as a neurotic Woody Allen type. Catherine Keener (as Pierce's straying wife, an HR director with a rather unique method of conducting applicant interviews) continues her legacy of caustic, self-loathing ice-queens (she's beautiful, and a fine actress, but will she EVER play a likable character?!) Julia Roberts is so low key that she is nearly unrecognizable, which I found oddly appealing. Nicky Katt is the funniest Hitler since Dick Shawn, and David Duchovny is memorable as the pivotal character who ultimately ties all the stories together (and helps Soderbergh play the biggest ""in joke"" af all time on ""X-Files"" fans who remember psychic Peter Boyle's vision of how Fox Mulder would ultimately meet his demise!).

I am a big fan of indie experimental original movies but this one gives the term bad meaning. As hard as they tried, the talented performers ((David Hyde Pierce, Catherine Keener, Mary McCormack, Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood) could not make their lifeless characters interesting enough for me to care. I love Catherine Keener in every movie I've seen her but she's played the same role in better films. She is much more interesting in Neil LaBute's ""Your Friends & Neighbors"" (1998) which reminds in some ways Full Frontal. Both, Neil LaBute's and Soderbergh's films picture selfish and often unpleasant and despicable people who are not happy with themselves and can't make happy those close to them. Another Keener's film that came to my mind, is Living in Oblivion (1995), a 91 minutes long low-budget independent movie about trials and tribulations of making a low budget independent movie. Tom DiCillo's smart, funny, playful, and highly enjoyable Living in Oblivion has surreal, strangely poetic and amusing quality to it. Unlike, Soderbergh's empty exercise in self-indulgence, wonderful cast of Living in Oblivion has something interesting to play and the characters created by Steve Buscemi, Catherine Keener, Chad Palomino, Dermot Mulroney and Peter Dinklage (in a very funny cameo) are alive and three-dimensional. I am a fan of Soderbergh's work since I saw his fascinating debut, the Palme d'Or winner ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"". I read that ""Full Frontal"" is in a way a sequel to Soderbergh's first feature.

729995,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00007K02C,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 3]","Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors working today. Although I don't like everything he has done, some of his work is truly brilliant (""Schizopolis"" is a personal favorite), while some is mainstream and less intriguing. All of it is interesting to try to understand, and in that regard ""Full Frontal"" is no exception. Soderbergh views ""Full Frontal"" as a more contemporary ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" and is one of his more personal ventures into the world of low budget filmmaking (the budget was two million dollars). When Soderbergh does something with a small budget, the creativity is normally inversely high, and the originality factor is definitely present here.The film features a non-linear plot, where differing stories involving interconnected pairs of people explore modern Hollywood life. The creative ""movie within a movie"" concept is used to good effect, but must be carefully watched to ensure that you understand whether you are seeing the actors or the characters they are portraying. To assist with this understanding, Soderbergh has provided the viewer with several subtle clues that truly reveal the hand of a master craftsman. The film within a film (""Rendezvous"") is shot on film, has brilliant color, has music and sound effects, while the rest of the movie is shot in a more documentary style on a digital camera, done with natural light (and was made to look even grainier in postproduction, as revealed in the commentary), has no sound effects, and no background music.The interactions between the characters were very interesting to watch and were sometimes nonsensical (as random dialogue between two people tend to be when background information is not present). I was especially fond of the characters played by David Hyde Pierce and Blair Underwood, and found their characterizations most natural. I think Julia Roberts was adequate in her role, but perhaps not as suited to the more improvisational nature of this type of film. I found Catherine Keener's character pointedly annoying, and while that served the ultimate goal of the film, I found it to be difficult to endure. (I did enjoy the multiple games of catch with a beach ball globe while she grilled various people to name all the countries in Africa, though.) Nicky Katt was amazing as a truly wretched art house Hitler in a production of ""The Sound and the Fuhrer"", which I suppose counts as a play within a movie revealing extra complexity. (If you ever wanted to imagine Hitler on a date or in therapy accompanied by avant-garde dancing Nazis, this is a must see.) I was also delighted with the dog owned by David Hyde Pierce that had eaten six hash-laced brownies; rarely has an animal been so perfect in a role.The writing by Coleman Hough (with help from Soderbergh and the actors) is frequently full of unexpected gems like ""I have confused my personality quirks with standards"", but they are so subtly played that they tend to slip by unless the viewer is watching intently. That characterizes the entire film: it contains a lot of good material, but requires extreme attention to detail to understand it all.The DVD features many extras, most of which are excellent (although the ""Director's Spy Cam"" feature is a complete bust). The commentary with Soderbergh and Hough is especially enlightening, as is the interview with Soderbergh. The ""In-Character Interviews"" were interesting, and served as an excellent outlet for improvisation; some are more successful than others. While the interview with David Hyde Pierce was excellent, the interview with Julia Roberts was tepid at best, and the interview with Blair Underwood was excruciating. For people genuinely interested in filmmaking, Soderbergh's comments are always enlightening, and I found them the most enjoyable part of the DVD, and therein a problem resides. If the commentary is the most interesting part of the DVD, then perhaps the material is not among his most brilliant, and in this case I think that's partially fair. The issue is that much of the material is strong, but some isn't and tends toward boring; I especially found that to be true with the characters of Keener and David Duchovny, who came across as not only self-absorbed, but totally unlikable as well. Their roles were ill-defined and I kept waiting for them to reveal their integral importance to the plot and to explain why I should find them to be worthy of attention; with a bit of an exception from Keener at the end, I never found them to be sympathetic characters, nor did I find them to be as compelling as the remainder of the cast.On balance, I find this movie more worthy of study from the point of view of how it was made and why various choices were made in its production rather than as an organic piece of entertainment. People familiar with Soderbergh's big budget pictures will likely not find this to their liking (although in addition to Roberts, there is a cameo with Brad Pitt; Pitt fans should watch the film to the very end) while fans of indie and Soderbergh's lower budget films (especially ""Schizopolis"") will be much more open to the quirky charms of ""Full Frontal"".",3,"Mix ""Sex, Lies, And Videotape""

729996,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00007K02C,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","""Full Frontal"" is built on a remarkably juvenile screenplay by performance artist Coleman Hough; it's pretty amazing director Steven Soderbergh saw anything in it. It's literate enough, but about all the neurotic, postmodern things we've grown to loathe: weird sexual fetishes, the debate of  ""reality"" vs. ""unreality"", that two-degrees-of-separation-in-LA material, and, finally, unnervingly, Hollywood mechanics. We did not need another ludicrous, didactic structural analysis of Hollywood.Boy do we get it. ""Full Frontal"" begins with an introduction of the characters through series of random, purposeless monologues drawn from different points in the film, then the opening scene of what looks like a big budget romance movie between an actor (Blair Underwood) and a journalist (Julia Roberts), just staged and false enough to let you know it's winking, before commencing with seemingly unrelated subplots that wink like an old creep with a pocket of butterscotch candies.Another journalist (David Hyde Pierce) is clinging to his magazine job and his marriage to a human relations executive of some kind (Catherine Keener) who is quite clearly deranged or a descendant of the inquisition: She conducts interviews, all day it seems, by throwing a plastic blowup globe at her applicants and demanding the names of all the countries in Africa. This story is intercut with the opening of a second-rate stage comedy about Hitler, with a lead actor (Nicky Katt) channeling Cary Grant and quoting Peter Ustinov; and a massage therapist (Mary McCormack) who eventually crosses the paths of all the characters. David Duchovny appears in a cameo as a kinky movie producer that proves he's pretty hard up in life after ""The X-Files.""Soderbergh is usually pretty savvy with a variety of film styles and camera lenses, but using cheap digital cameras mutes the small victories of comedy Hough's script does deliver. The hand-held jitter is agonizing as well. There's only so much of the follow-the-globe cam we can take.Mostly, though, ""Full Frontal"" is a painful (and refreshing) reminder that not every chic, self-absorbed New Yorker like Hough can waltz into LA and force audiences to acknowledge her obvious highbrow wit and trendy verbal gymnastics by inserting bizarre non-sequitors like vampires, marijuana brownies and guys crawling along hotel floors. Keener especially rants and moans her way into the pantheon of grating personas. It could be said that Roberts acquits herself in a small role - Roberts seems to be doing a lot of that lately - while Pierce most closely approaches a performance of resonance.Based on its less-is-nothing marketing campaign, Soderbergh and others basically knew ""Full Frontal"" was inside baseball, pertinent to the few, aimless for the rest.

But perhaps that's what makes Steven Soderbergh such an intriguing director.To put it simply, Full Frontal confused me. Its look at Los Angeles movie-industry culture has a way of telescoping further and further outwards. Using the visual technique for which he won the Oscar for Best Director on Traffic (he again operates as his own director of photography on this movie under the alias of Peter Andrews), he separates the different storylines and worlds with different visual looks. Much of the film is shot on digital video, giving it a harsh, washed-out look. The movie-within-the-movie is on standard 35mm. And there are two move levels even beyond that, one featuring David Fincher and Brad Pitt.I had trouble gaining full acceptance for Full Frontal. It covers its emotional resonance with layer upon layer of stylization and apathy. He holds the characters at arms length, never really showing any sympathy for their situations. Part of this is his visual style, which, while helpful in understanding the way the movie operates, tends to lend more of a documentary feel to the proceedings. Its wild tonal shifts can throw the viewer off ..., and Catherine Keener's behavior through the first two acts make it difficult to connect with her breakdown in the third.Perhaps die-hard film geeks will rave about Full Frontal for its cleverness and its ""offbeat""ness. But that cleverness comes at the expense of the emotion that lies at the heart of this story.All style and no substance, which is probably what Soderbergh was going for. And for that, it works. But it's difficult to care.",3,"ER, WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN?",1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,2016,"['quiet', 'little', 'picture', 'called', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'big', 'punches', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Traffic', 'Steve', 'Soderbergh', 'charted', 'quite', 'route', 'even', 'made', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'big-name', 'movies', '2001', 'Ocean', 'Eleven.Full', 'Frontal', 'was', 'where', 'probably', 'got', 'kicks', 'doing', 'something', 'offbeat', 'Not', 'many', 'directors', 'can', 'would', 'want', 'knock', 'off', 'quick', 'small-budget', 'movie', 'major', 'projects', 'perhaps', 'what', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'intriguing', 'director.To', 'put', 'simply', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'confused', 'look', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'movie-industry', 'culture', 'way', 'telescoping', 'further', 'further', 'outwards', 'Using', 'visual', 'technique', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director', 'Traffic', 'again', 'own', 'director', 'photography', 'movie', 'alias', 'Peter', 'Andrews', 'different', 'storylines', 'worlds', 'different', 'visual', 'looks', 'Much', 'film', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'giving', 'harsh', 'washed-out', 'look', 'movie-within-the-movie', 'standard', '35mm', 'are', 'two', 'move', 'levels', 'even', 'one', 'featuring', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Brad', 'Pitt.I', 'had', 'trouble', 'gaining', 'full', 'acceptance', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'layer', 'layer', 'stylization', 'apathy', 'characters', 'arms', 'length', 'never', 'really', 'showing', 'sympathy', 'situations', 'Part', 'visual', 'style', 'helpful', 'understanding', 'way', 'movie', 'lend', 'more', 'documentary', 'feel', 'proceedings', 'wild', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'can', 'throw', 'viewer', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'behavior', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'make', 'difficult', 'connect', 'breakdown', 'third.Perhaps', 'die-hard', 'film', 'geeks', 'will', 'rave', 'Full', 'Frontal', 'cleverness', 'offbeat', 'ness', 'cleverness', 'expense', 'emotion', 'heart', 'story.All', 'style', 'substance', 'probably', 'what', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'going', 'difficult', 'care']",Full Frontal

I figured out, at the very beginning, that it was a story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story which was very confusing.  The grainy quality of the ""real"" story made it seem amateurish.  I was disappointed that David Duchovny only had about four scenes.  He made the most of his few scenes, however,even though they were at the very end.  What I didn't expect was his character's death from auto-erotic asphixiation.

729999,A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B00007K02C,Steward Willons,"[1, 2]","Judging from all the negative reviews, I'm guess this film attracted a lot of mainstream viewers who enjoy Soderberg's other films like ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Traffic"". That's not really the intended audience and I can understand their frustration. However, much of the criticism heaved at this film is due mostly to a misunderstanding of how to view it.My best example is in the acting. I've heard so many complaints that the acting is horrible. It's not horrible - it's just a different style. An improvisatory, more natural style. One usually finds this type of acting in Dogma 95 films (think Lars Von Trier). It feels unrehearsed and has an immediacy that is quite appealing, if you know what you're looking at. If you're seeing major stars and their acting is different than in their other films, that's only because Soderberg's whole approach is different on this project. He creates the situations with an outline of character motivation. From there, the actors create the characters, in great depth.The story is another point of contention. Anyone disappointed in the supposed lack of a narrative was looking for something that just wasn't there. The film is episodic, much like Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita."" It's really about the characters, their lives, and their struggles. There isn't a major ""goal"", there isn't a beginning or an end, and we never reach any sort of closure. There are small stories happening throughout the film and they do have a beginning, middle, and end; but overall, it's a brief look at a wide variety of individuals - some interesting, some not. One of the most clever parts of the film is the love story, which Soderberg immediately identifies as a film within a film. It's his cynical way of pointing out that the masses want a love story in their film. Well, he gives us one, but he also points out that it is completely contrived and false.I find these characters completely fascinating. The acting is just incredibly real and raw. Soderberg's direction is top notch and reminds me just how great of a filmmaker he really is. It's easy to consider him a mainstream hack when he releases multiple ""Ocean"" films, but he's brilliant.As one can tell by reading all the one-star reviews, this film is not for everyone. It's not technically ""experimental"" because this style is well precedented, but to those unfamiliar with neorealism or Dogma 95 films, it might as well be avant garde. If I could offer one piece of advice, it would be to shed your expectations of how a film functions. You'll just be disappointed. Try to enjoy just watching the characters without trying to form detailed connections between them. The scenes are really just brief episodes that serve to show us the characters and they don't necessarily form a teleological progression from A to Z.Finally, a word on the craftsmanship. Soderberg filmed most of this in digital video, so it doesn't have the same richness as film. This is fairly typical with this sort of realist film. Directors in this style often like to travel light, so the film crew is unobtrusive and extremely flexible. On a few occasions, Soderberg does switch to film, but it's for the film-within-a-film, and the dramatic change in look clues us into what we're watchingTo a minority, this will be a great and rewarding film, full of detailed, nuanced performances. For many, it will be frustrating and tedious, so long as we insist on trying to make it into a regular film. It's worth watching, but keep only the expectation of seeing something 'different.'",4,Soderberg's take on neo-realism,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,3532,"['Judging', 'negative', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'guess', 'film', 'attracted', 'lot', 'mainstream', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Soderberg', 'other', 'films', 'Ocean', '11', 'Traffic', 'not', 'really', 'intended', 'audience', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'However', 'much', 'criticism', 'heaved', 'film', 'due', 'mostly', 'misunderstanding', 'how', 'view', 'it.My', 'best', 'example', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'complaints', 'acting', 'horrible', 'not', 'horrible', 'just', 'different', 'style', 'improvisatory', 'more', 'natural', 'style', 'One', 'usually', 'type', 'acting', 'Dogma', '95', 'films', 'think', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'unrehearsed', 'immediacy', 'quite', 'appealing', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'major', 'stars', 'acting', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'only', 'Soderberg', 'whole', 'approach', 'different', 'project', 'situations', 'outline', 'character', 'motivation', 'there', 'actors', 'create', 'characters', 'great', 'depth.The', 'story', 'point', 'contention', 'Anyone', 'disappointed', 'supposed', 'lack', 'narrative', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'film', 'episodic', 'much', 'Fellini', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'really', 'characters', 'lives', 'struggles', ""n't"", 'major', 'goal', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'end', 'never', 'reach', 'sort', 'closure', 'are', 'small', 'stories', 'happening', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'overall', 'brief', 'look', 'wide', 'variety', 'individuals', 'interesting', 'not', 'One', 'most', 'clever', 'parts', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'Soderberg', 'immediately', 'film', 'film', 'cynical', 'way', 'pointing', 'out', 'masses', 'want', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'Well', 'one', 'also', 'out', 'completely', 'contrived', 'false.I', 'find', 'characters', 'completely', 'fascinating', 'acting', 'just', 'incredibly', 'real', 'raw', 'Soderberg', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'easy', 'consider', 'mainstream', 'hack', 'when', 'multiple', 'Ocean', 'films', 'brilliant.As', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'reading', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'technically', 'experimental', 'style', 'well', 'precedented', 'unfamiliar', 'neorealism', 'Dogma', '95', 'films', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'avant', 'garde', 'could', 'offer', 'one', 'piece', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'shed', 'expectations', 'how', 'film', 'functions', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Try', 'enjoy', 'just', 'watching', 'characters', 'trying', 'form', 'detailed', 'connections', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'brief', 'episodes', 'serve', 'show', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'form', 'teleological', 'progression', 'A', 'Z.Finally', 'word', 'craftsmanship', 'Soderberg', 'filmed', 'most', 'digital', 'video', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'richness', 'film', 'fairly', 'typical', 'sort', 'realist', 'film', 'Directors', 'style', 'often', 'travel', 'light', 'film', 'crew', 'unobtrusive', 'extremely', 'flexible', 'few', 'occasions', 'Soderberg', 'switch', 'film', 'film-within-a-film', 'dramatic', 'change', 'look', 'clues', 'what', ""'re"", 'watchingTo', 'minority', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'rewarding', 'film', 'full', 'detailed', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'frustrating', 'tedious', 'so', 'long', 'insist', 'trying', 'make', 'regular', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'expectation', 'seeing', 'something', ""'different""]",Full Frontal

I should have remembered it from my days as a Theatre major but for the record - actors are boring, directors are boring, most movie people sit around doing nothing in order to get ten minutes of footage put together. Even if these people aren't boring, they aren't nearly as interesting as their characters on screen.And Soderbergh really captures the dullness of Hollywood living as these characters go about their lives, reading their scenes, making the adjustments to their personal lives that personal trainers and therapy allows for. There are about 5 different storylines going through this movie but they have one thing in common - they are all forgettable. In fact I remember snippets like feeding the dog marijuana brownies or the divorce letter that never gets sent. I find myself realizing why David Duchovny wasn't a major star before &lt;b&gt;The X-Files&lt;/b&gt;. He might be hilarious on the talk shows, but his understated droll delivery only works if he's talking about alien conspiracies.

730001,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007K02C,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Though &quot;Full Frontal&quot; boasts of its great casts including Julia Roberts, the film is rather an experimental indie film, mostly shot in 18 days with a digital camera (which cost only $ 4,600).  That is not a problem if the film is interesting -- I mean, interesting characters, interesting techiniques, interesting stories, or anything.  No such luck, sorry.  Though some actors are giving their best efforts, the film looks more like a self-indulgent film-school student's work.The film follows the events that happen to the characters (whose profiles are revealed in the introductory part).  Journalist Julia Roberts is interviewing TV star Blair Underwood; Cathrine Keener is doing the most uncomfortable job of the human resorce office (that is, firing the employees); her sister Mary McCormack is talking about the guy she met on the net; David Hyde Pierce (who shows uncanny resemblance with director Soderbergh himself) is rehearsing the stage drama for the always quizzical Nikky Katt.  When the day comes close to the end, these assorted people find themselves strangely entangled in the web of human relations, which is represented by the dinner party for &quot;Gus,&quot; powerful Hollywood producer played by one star from &quot;X-Files.&quot;The film also includes 'film within film&quot; device (and even &quot;film within film within film&quot; devide, too), which might confuse some of the viewers.  Fortunately, the device is not overused, and soon you will understand what is doing on.The trouble is, except for some moments including talented Keener, none of the characters can really grab your attention.  They are facing the critical moments of life, the film implies, but strangely we do not care.  And as the experimental film, &quot;Full Frontal&quot; is not as innovative as &quot;Schizopolis&quot; (in which Soderbergh himself starred).Possibly, here is the reason for its half-baked result: first, incredible you might say, but Soderbergh's use of digital camera is so poor like someone's home movies.  At one scene, you see Sandra Oh very briefly.  Well, but I couldn't see whether it was her or not because of a blurred image (I knew her voice, and saw her name in the credits), and I was thinking -- what is the point of doing that?  The poorly shot images just detract our attention to the characters which should not be sacrificed for the dirctor's unnecessary &quot;experiments.&quot;Some parts of the film might interest you (if you're a film buff).  You see many cameos -- Brad Pitt, Terence Stamp, and David Fincher (as the perfectionist director who needs 49 takes for one breif shot).  But they are not enough for us to keep being interesting in the story which should really count.  The conculsion is this; you just cannot use this great cast just because you want to be experimantal.  Life is too short to do that, especially with this cast.",2,Experiment?  Ensemble Drama?
