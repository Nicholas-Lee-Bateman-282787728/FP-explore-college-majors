There were maybe a couple scenes that were funny, but besides that, it was bad.  You could tell it was a low budget movie.

It was funny to me, and I read the reviews and I don't care.  It has a big cast and even though I can see why it went straight to DVD, it gave me laughing fits from beginning to end.
