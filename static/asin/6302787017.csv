333868,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6302787017,Douglas M,"[2, 3]","""Flirtation Walk"" is a large scale Warner Brothers production of 1934, released after the implementation of the Hays Code, the constraining censorship which sanitised American films for over 20 years. The censorship is in full swing here. Musical sweethearts Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler are teamed but out of a tough backstage milieu and into a screenplay which would have been suitable for the whole family (not a compliment).The story tells of regular army private Powell's travails through officer school, West Point, in fact, and his on-again off-again romance with the Colonel's daughter. This is all very predictable and while Keeler and Powell benefit from the famous Frank Borzage's careful direction, they are as dull as can be. The film was a Best Picture Nominee, acknowledging that it is very well made but there is absolutely no excitement in the screenplay. For those interested in the history of Westpoint, there are some carefully interpolated sequences shot on location but for Powell, it seems that getting through merely involves rushing to parade for endless marching in a variety of different uniforms and cowtailing to the bullying of those above him!Ross Alexander plays Powell's sidekick and steals every scene in which he appears. Pat O'Brien plays Powell's sergeant from the regular army and it is indicative of the corn on display that his nickname is ""Scrapper"" and he cries when Powell graduates. Since the leads were musical stars, the film gets in a couple of songs towards the end under the guise of the graduates putting on ""The Annual Show"". The title song and ""Mr and Mrs is the Name"" are charming and benefit from the chorus accompaniment and orchestration of Ray Heindorf.This is a Warner's Archive Collection release so we pay a very high price for a no frills DVD with an unrestored, and in this case merely adequate, print and no extras except the original theatrical trailer.",2,Dull expensive DVD,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1916,"['Flirtation', 'Walk', 'large', 'scale', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'production', '1934', 'released', 'implementation', 'Hays', 'Code', 'constraining', 'censorship', 'sanitised', 'American', 'films', '20', 'years', 'censorship', 'full', 'swing', 'here', 'Musical', 'sweethearts', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'are', 'teamed', 'tough', 'backstage', 'milieu', 'screenplay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'not', 'compliment', 'story', 'tells', 'regular', 'army', 'private', 'Powell', 'travails', 'officer', 'school', 'West', 'Point', 'fact', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'romance', 'Colonel', 'daughter', 'very', 'predictable', 'Keeler', 'Powell', 'benefit', 'famous', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'careful', 'direction', 'are', 'as', 'dull', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Nominee', 'acknowledging', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'absolutely', 'excitement', 'screenplay', 'interested', 'history', 'Westpoint', 'are', 'carefully', 'interpolated', 'sequences', 'shot', 'location', 'Powell', 'getting', 'merely', 'rushing', 'parade', 'endless', 'marching', 'variety', 'different', 'uniforms', 'cowtailing', 'bullying', 'Ross', 'Alexander', 'Powell', 'sidekick', 'steals', 'scene', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Powell', 'sergeant', 'regular', 'army', 'indicative', 'corn', 'display', 'nickname', 'Scrapper', 'when', 'Powell', 'leads', 'were', 'musical', 'stars', 'film', 'couple', 'songs', 'end', 'guise', 'graduates', 'putting', 'Annual', 'Show', 'title', 'song', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Name', 'are', 'charming', 'benefit', 'chorus', 'accompaniment', 'orchestration', 'Ray', 'Heindorf.This', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'release', 'pay', 'very', 'high', 'price', 'frills', 'DVD', 'unrestored', 'case', 'merely', 'adequate', 'print', 'extras', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
333869,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302787017,James L.,"[6, 7]","Dick Powell stars as an Army private stationed in Hawaii who becomes tangled up with a general's daughter (Ruby Keeler) involved with another man.  When things end badly and he is accused of not behaving like a gentleman, he transfers to West Point so that he can become an officer (and a gentleman) while also forgetting her.  Of course, she re-enters the picture and his successful training is placed in jeopardy.  The plot is pretty thin, which was often the case in the Warner Brothers musicals of the Thirties.  Although the often co-starred Powell and Keeler are comfortable with each other, riveting they are not.  They play their roles earnestly, as does the rest of the cast, which includes Pat O'Brien as Powell's proud former sergeant and Ross Alexander as Powell's fellow cadet.  The songs are generally forgettable, and apart from the marching in formation, there's little here visually to distinguish the film, unlike so many of the studio's other Thirties musicals.  The film seems to lack energy and charisma, building little momentum or interest.  It passes the time, but does little else.",3,Thin Plotting,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,1106,"['Dick', 'Powell', 'Army', 'private', 'stationed', 'Hawaii', 'who', 'tangled', 'up', 'general', 'daughter', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'involved', 'man', 'When', 'things', 'end', 'badly', 'accused', 'not', 'behaving', 'gentleman', 'West', 'Point', 'so', 'can', 'become', 'officer', 'gentleman', 'also', 'forgetting', 'course', 'picture', 'successful', 'training', 'placed', 'jeopardy', 'plot', 'pretty', 'thin', 'was', 'often', 'case', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'musicals', 'Thirties', 'often', 'co-starred', 'Powell', 'Keeler', 'are', 'comfortable', 'other', 'riveting', 'are', 'not', 'play', 'roles', 'earnestly', 'rest', 'cast', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Powell', 'proud', 'former', 'sergeant', 'Ross', 'Alexander', 'Powell', 'fellow', 'cadet', 'songs', 'are', 'generally', 'forgettable', 'apart', 'marching', 'formation', 'little', 'here', 'visually', 'distinguish', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'studio', 'other', 'Thirties', 'musicals', 'film', 'lack', 'energy', 'charisma', 'building', 'little', 'momentum', 'interest', 'time', 'little', 'else']",N/A
333870,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302787017,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","""Flirtation Walk"" has some very entertaining musical numbers and the acting is convincing, too. I liked the musical score and the sound stage for the Hawaiian luau was the largest sound stage manufactured at Warner Brothers' Studios (well, First National Pictures which was operated by Warners) at the time. The casting reflects good forethought; the cinematography is terrific and the choreography shines especially in the musical numbers and the military marching scenes. (Parts of this movie were actually filmed at West Point Military Academy.) Unfortunately, however, the latter part of the film drags somewhat; they could have taken out ten or even fifteen minutes of the film without too many people even noticing.At the beginning of the film we meet Private Richard Palmer Grant ""Canary""/ ""Dick"" Dorcy (Dick Powell) who isn't afraid to rattle Sergeant ""Scrapper"" Thornhhill (Pat O'Brien); and even though ""Scrapper"" sometimes even punches Dick for being rude Dick always seems to have yet another sarcastic remark flowing right out of his mouth. Enter General John Brent 'Jack' Fitts and his daughter Kathleen 'Kit' Fitts (Ruby Keeler); Kit is engaged to Lieutenant Robert Biddle (John Eldredge) but since Robert is very busy they assign Dick to show Kit around the island--even leaving the military base which they shouldn't have done! Of course, Kit and Dick fall for one another; but when Robert Biddle and others find them together they order Dick and Kit back to the base and Scrapper expects that Dick will be court-martialed and thrown into military jail for years as punishment for his transgressions.However, Dick is fortunate enough not to be court-martialed (I'll leave out why so as not to spoil that part for you); and he enlists at West Point to become an officer. Kit goes her own way with her father and the years pass with Dick eventually doing very well at West Point.And just when Dick is close to graduation from West Point, Kit and her father re-enter the picture. Not only is Kit's father the new superintendent at West Point, Robert Biddle is there, too! The rest of the plot is essentially how the love triangle is resolved and there are two or three well done musical numbers, too.Look also for solid performances by Ross Alexander as West Point Cadet Oscar Berry; Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams as a soldier nicknamed ""Sleepy"" and John Arledge as Cadet ""Spike"" Dukowe.""Flirtation Walk"" provides relatively light-hearted entertainment. While I've left out some of the story to avoid spoilers, you may see the resolution coming but yet the musical numbers and the superbly choreographed and filmed marching scenes at West Point give the picture a good lift. It should have been edited down a bit when it shows the Cadets including Dick going through their four years at West Point; but fans of the actors in this movie will certainly want this for their collections anyway. In addition, people who enjoy musicals will want this film.",4,"a Warner Brothers military musical that has some drama, too",1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,2959,"['Flirtation', 'Walk', 'very', 'entertaining', 'musical', 'numbers', 'acting', 'convincing', 'too', 'liked', 'musical', 'score', 'sound', 'stage', 'Hawaiian', 'luau', 'was', 'largest', 'sound', 'stage', 'manufactured', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Studios', 'well', 'First', 'National', 'Pictures', 'was', 'operated', 'Warners', 'time', 'casting', 'good', 'forethought', 'cinematography', 'terrific', 'choreography', 'shines', 'especially', 'musical', 'numbers', 'military', 'marching', 'scenes', 'Parts', 'movie', 'were', 'actually', 'filmed', 'West', 'Point', 'Military', 'Academy', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'somewhat', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'ten', 'even', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'noticing.At', 'beginning', 'film', 'meet', 'Private', 'Richard', 'Palmer', 'Grant', 'Canary', 'Dick', 'Dorcy', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'rattle', 'Sergeant', 'Scrapper', 'Thornhhill', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'even', 'Scrapper', 'sometimes', 'even', 'punches', 'Dick', 'being', 'rude', 'Dick', 'always', 'have', 'yet', 'sarcastic', 'remark', 'flowing', 'right', 'mouth', 'Enter', 'General', 'John', 'Brent', ""'Jack"", 'Fitts', 'daughter', 'Kathleen', ""'Kit"", 'Fitts', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'Kit', 'engaged', 'Lieutenant', 'Robert', 'Biddle', 'John', 'Eldredge', 'Robert', 'very', 'busy', 'assign', 'Dick', 'show', 'Kit', 'island', 'even', 'leaving', 'military', 'base', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'course', 'Kit', 'Dick', 'fall', 'one', 'when', 'Robert', 'Biddle', 'others', 'find', 'together', 'order', 'Dick', 'Kit', 'back', 'base', 'Scrapper', 'Dick', 'will', 'be', 'court-martialed', 'thrown', 'military', 'jail', 'years', 'punishment', 'transgressions.However', 'Dick', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'court-martialed', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'part', 'West', 'Point', 'become', 'officer', 'Kit', 'own', 'way', 'father', 'years', 'pass', 'Dick', 'eventually', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'West', 'Point.And', 'just', 'when', 'Dick', 'close', 'graduation', 'West', 'Point', 'Kit', 'father', 're-enter', 'picture', 'Not', 'only', 'Kit', 'father', 'new', 'superintendent', 'West', 'Point', 'Robert', 'Biddle', 'there', 'too', 'rest', 'plot', 'essentially', 'how', 'love', 'triangle', 'resolved', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'well', 'done', 'musical', 'numbers', 'too.Look', 'also', 'solid', 'performances', 'Ross', 'Alexander', 'West', 'Point', 'Cadet', 'Oscar', 'Berry', 'Guinn', 'Boy', 'Williams', 'soldier', 'nicknamed', 'Sleepy', 'John', 'Arledge', 'Cadet', 'Spike', 'Dukowe', 'Flirtation', 'Walk', 'relatively', 'light-hearted', 'entertainment', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out', 'story', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'may', 'see', 'resolution', 'coming', 'yet', 'musical', 'numbers', 'superbly', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'marching', 'scenes', 'West', 'Point', 'give', 'picture', 'good', 'lift', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'bit', 'when', 'Cadets', 'including', 'Dick', 'going', 'four', 'years', 'West', 'Point', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'collections', 'anyway', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'musicals', 'will', 'want', 'film']",N/A
333871,A37S3ACL57LN62,6302787017,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[5, 5]","Dick Dorcey (Dick Powell) has a wise mouth and he doesn't hesitate to show it off to Sgt. Thornhill (Pat O'Brien), who he affectionately calls ""Scrapper."" Why is Dick in the army then? That's a good question. He doesn't like authority and gets himself into plenty of trouble, but he aspires to be an officer. His surroundings don't make it easy. Kathleen Fitts (Ruby Keeler) is on the base to visit her high-ranking father, and Dick is assigned to chauffeur her around. Feeling adventurous, she orders him to break many rules in favor of showing her the real Hawaii. She also saves him from punishment, but he tries to cut himself off from further problems by shipping himself to West Point for training. There, he rises steadily toward his dream, but he can't escape fate in the shape of a beautiful woman.Flirtation Walk is quite a bit different than the typical Warner Brothers musical. The pacing is much less snappy and frantic, which gives director Frank Borzage a chance to stretch his legs. The visuals are fantastic; Borzage makes Hawaii look lush and languid with his soft lighting and stylish directing. He makes the most of his actors. Powell is cocky and funny, but still as likable as in previous films. Keeler is a breath of fresh air in this film; she finally proves that she can act after all. She can sing too! O'Brien is stalwart and likable, and Ross Alexander as Dick's army friend is hilarious and enjoyable.The musical numbers are not as exciting as Busby Berkeley's, but they're pleasant. The first actually resembles Berkeley's style. It takes place in a Hawaiian luau where the natives form circles and are watched from above on a hill. Later, songs like ""Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name"" and ""Flirtation Walk"" are staged as scenarios, each with their own merits. Powell is an expert at playing his lyrics as he sings them, and Borzage's visuals are a wonderful companion. This is yet another Borzage film that has been neglected over time; here is hoping it will see a DVD release in the future.",4,"""No Horse, No Wife, No Mustache""",1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,2015,"['Dick', 'Dorcey', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'wise', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'show', 'off', 'Sgt', 'Thornhill', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'affectionately', 'Scrapper', 'Why', 'Dick', 'army', 'then', 'good', 'question', ""n't"", 'like', 'authority', 'plenty', 'trouble', 'be', 'officer', 'surroundings', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'easy', 'Kathleen', 'Fitts', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'base', 'visit', 'high-ranking', 'father', 'Dick', 'assigned', 'chauffeur', 'around', 'Feeling', 'adventurous', 'orders', 'break', 'many', 'rules', 'favor', 'showing', 'real', 'Hawaii', 'also', 'punishment', 'cut', 'off', 'further', 'problems', 'shipping', 'West', 'Point', 'training', 'steadily', 'dream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'fate', 'shape', 'beautiful', 'woman.Flirtation', 'Walk', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'typical', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'musical', 'pacing', 'much', 'less', 'snappy', 'frantic', 'director', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'chance', 'stretch', 'legs', 'visuals', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Borzage', 'Hawaii', 'look', 'lush', 'languid', 'soft', 'lighting', 'stylish', 'directing', 'most', 'actors', 'Powell', 'cocky', 'funny', 'still', 'as', 'likable', 'previous', 'films', 'Keeler', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'film', 'finally', 'can', 'act', 'can', 'sing', 'too', ""O'Brien"", 'stalwart', 'likable', 'Ross', 'Alexander', 'Dick', 'army', 'friend', 'hilarious', 'enjoyable.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', ""'re"", 'pleasant', 'first', 'actually', 'Berkeley', 'style', 'place', 'Hawaiian', 'luau', 'where', 'natives', 'form', 'circles', 'are', 'watched', 'hill', 'Later', 'songs', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Name', 'Flirtation', 'Walk', 'are', 'staged', 'scenarios', 'own', 'merits', 'Powell', 'expert', 'playing', 'lyrics', 'Borzage', 'visuals', 'are', 'wonderful', 'companion', 'yet', 'Borzage', 'film', 'been', 'neglected', 'time', 'here', 'hoping', 'will', 'see', 'DVD', 'release', 'future']",N/A
