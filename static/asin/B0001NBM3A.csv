Two of them are set during Batman the animated series.  In Mask of the Phantasm, the past and present collide for Bruce Wane.  Several gangsters in Gothum are being killed by a terrifying figure known only as the Phantasm.  And Batman is accused of being the murderer.  Now, he must discover the identity of this mysterious assassin, and keep one step ahead of the Joker as well.  As far as I know, this movie may be set some time around the first season of the animated series.In Subzero, which seems to take place directly after the events in episode 84(Deep Freeze), Mister Freeze is desperate to find a blood transfusion for his beloved wife, who's stasis tube was shattered.  The Comissioner's daughter, Barbara, has the appropriate blood type.  Now Batman has to rescue her.Return of the Joker is set during the Batman Beyond animated series.  It seems as if Batman's greatest nemesis has returned, but an aged Bruce Wane refuses to believe that this clown is the real deal.  Now Bruce's successer Terry must do all he can to find the answers.  Fans of the series are in for a real treat along the way as well.  This one's one of my favs.  So enjoy this set if you choose to purchus it.",5,"If you like the Batman animated series, you'll like these.",1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,1286,"['have', 'cash', 'why', 'not', 'purchus', 'three', 'hit', 'movies', 'together', 'one', 'package', 'Two', 'are', 'set', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'past', 'present', 'collide', 'Bruce', 'Wane', 'Several', 'gangsters', 'Gothum', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'terrifying', 'figure', 'known', 'only', 'Phantasm', 'Batman', 'accused', 'being', 'murderer', 'Now', 'must', 'discover', 'identity', 'mysterious', 'assassin', 'keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Joker', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'set', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'animated', 'series.In', 'Subzero', 'take', 'place', 'directly', 'events', 'episode', '84', 'Deep', 'Freeze', 'Mister', 'Freeze', 'desperate', 'find', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'beloved', 'wife', 'who', 'stasis', 'tube', 'was', 'shattered', 'Comissioner', 'daughter', 'Barbara', 'appropriate', 'blood', 'type', 'Now', 'Batman', 'rescue', 'her.Return', 'Joker', 'set', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'animated', 'series', 'Batman', 'greatest', 'nemesis', 'returned', 'aged', 'Bruce', 'Wane', 'believe', 'clown', 'real', 'deal', 'Now', 'Bruce', 'successer', 'Terry', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'Fans', 'series', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'way', 'well', 'one', 'one', 'favs', 'So', 'enjoy', 'set', 'choose', 'purchus']",Batman Collection: (Mask of the Phantasm / SubZero / Return of the Joker)

I see a lot of people complaining about how misleading the title is, but what is so misleading about it? It lists the movies it has in it very clearly (Phantasm, Sub-Zero, and Return of the Joker), and anyone who already owns or has heard of them should know what to expect.The reason Mystery of the Batwoman isn't included, I'd imagine, is because this set was probably assembled before MotB came out. And for those of you complaining that ""Return of the Joker"" wasn't really a Batman movie just because it starred the ""Beyond"" Batman, bite me. Batman Beyond was an excellent show. Now, if it had been an hour long movie starring ""The Batman""  (the more recent Year 3 version of Batman), then there'd be a reason to complain, but there's nothing wrong with Terry Mcginnis.And BITE me, John Q.
