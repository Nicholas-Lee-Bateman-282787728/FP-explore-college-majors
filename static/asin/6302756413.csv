It might be considered similar to an onion, in that as you peel away one layer, another presents itself.Be prepared to have a relaxed suspension of belief.  If you watch it with an uncritical eye, it will entertain.The cinematography is excellent, and the scenes (all within a few hundred miles of the northeastern Arizona border) are noteworthy. Most of the scenes are between Navajo Bridge, the Vermillion cliffs, Page Arizona and Lake Powell.Some reviewers like to include a synopsis in their reviews.  I do not do this, as IMDB has more details, often by professional critics.  As such, please do not slam this review for a lack of detail about the movie. I only mention this, as there are a number of Amazon users who appear to like to criticize evaluations, and are stupid enough to believe that being critical and negative makes them appear intelligent.  If they only knew. . .If you enjoy movies such as 'Road to Hell' or other fringe movies, you will find this movie well worth the time.",5,"Very wierd, but in a very good way",1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1089,"['bizarre', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'challenging', 'grasp', 'levels', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'similar', 'onion', 'peel', 'away', 'one', 'layer', 'presents', 'itself.Be', 'prepared', 'have', 'relaxed', 'suspension', 'belief', 'watch', 'uncritical', 'eye', 'will', 'entertain.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'few', 'hundred', 'miles', 'northeastern', 'Arizona', 'border', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'Navajo', 'Bridge', 'Vermillion', 'cliffs', 'Page', 'Arizona', 'Lake', 'Powell.Some', 'reviewers', 'include', 'synopsis', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'IMDB', 'more', 'details', 'often', 'professional', 'critics', 'such', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'slam', 'review', 'lack', 'detail', 'movie', 'only', 'mention', 'are', 'number', 'Amazon', 'users', 'who', 'appear', 'like', 'criticize', 'evaluations', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'believe', 'being', 'critical', 'negative', 'appear', 'intelligent', 'only', 'knew', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'such', ""'Road"", 'Hell', 'other', 'fringe', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'well', 'time']",N/A
331739,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6302756413,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[0, 1]","The key to enjoying a movie like 'Motorama' is, I believe, not knowing much about it before watching.  In fact, the less said about it the better - the potential viewer is apt to appreciate it more if they catch it fifteen minutes into the story on late night cable.  Even in that case, there will still only be a small favorable audience for 'Motorama'.  I doubt it was ever intended for a larger crowd - it's too idiosyncratic for that.  What's left are those who enjoy the offbeat, the quirky, the bizarre filmmaking touches that generally catapult a film into 'cult classic' territory - and even that subset of movie buffs (to which I belong) are going to be further divided on the merits of 'Motorama'.  Personally, I think it's mostly weirdness for weirdness sake, though I wouldn't dispute someone who saw something deeper, or felt that the film resonated with them.Plot synopses for movies like this generally do not convey the reasons behind their popularity (or lack thereof).  This is mostly because cult movies depend less on the story as they do small details and bizarre characters.  'Motorama' isn't any different.  A ten year old boy, Gus, leaves an abusive household, steals a cherry red Mustang, and strikes out one the road.  Seeing a sign advertising the Motorama contest, sponsored by Chimera Gas Company, he dedicates himself to collecting the game cards at the participating stations - to win, he must find cards that spell 'Motorama'.  Each advance in the contest accompanies a corollary sacrifice or hardship for the boy, and as he travels from state to state, he peals away layer after layer of civilization until he is immersed in a gritty, ugly world.There's more than one way to look at 'Motorama' - and I do think there was a interesting premise behind the film.  I just felt that it didn't translate well onto the screen.  I do know the marketing for the film is misleading - probably purposefully so.  Looking at the DVD cover, one would think that Drew Barrymore plays a significant role, but her screen time is limited to only a few minutes.  Other cameos include Meat Loaf and Garrett Morris, but it's Gus' show - everyone else is either a support or an obstacle to his quest.  A quest that, ultimately, never seems to get out of the neutral gear, and despite the inspired idea, leaves me indifferent and unruffled.",3,A Road Movie Stuck in Neutral,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,2350,"['key', 'enjoying', 'movie', ""'Motorama"", 'believe', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'watching', 'fact', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'potential', 'viewer', 'apt', 'appreciate', 'more', 'catch', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'story', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'Even', 'case', 'will', 'still', 'only', 'be', 'small', 'favorable', 'audience', ""'Motorama"", 'doubt', 'was', 'ever', 'intended', 'larger', 'crowd', 'too', 'idiosyncratic', 'What', 'left', 'are', 'who', 'enjoy', 'offbeat', 'quirky', 'bizarre', 'filmmaking', 'touches', 'generally', 'catapult', 'film', ""'cult"", 'classic', 'territory', 'even', 'subset', 'movie', 'buffs', 'belong', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'further', 'divided', 'merits', ""'Motorama"", 'Personally', 'think', 'mostly', 'weirdness', 'weirdness', 'sake', 'would', ""n't"", 'dispute', 'someone', 'who', 'saw', 'something', 'deeper', 'felt', 'film', 'resonated', 'them.Plot', 'synopses', 'movies', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'convey', 'reasons', 'popularity', 'lack', 'thereof', 'mostly', 'cult', 'movies', 'depend', 'less', 'story', 'do', 'small', 'details', 'bizarre', 'characters', ""n't"", 'different', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Gus', 'abusive', 'household', 'cherry', 'red', 'Mustang', 'out', 'one', 'road', 'Seeing', 'sign', 'advertising', 'Motorama', 'contest', 'sponsored', 'Chimera', 'Gas', 'Company', 'collecting', 'game', 'cards', 'participating', 'stations', 'win', 'must', 'find', 'cards', 'spell', ""'Motorama"", 'advance', 'contest', 'corollary', 'sacrifice', 'hardship', 'boy', 'state', 'state', 'away', 'layer', 'layer', 'civilization', 'immersed', 'gritty', 'ugly', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'look', ""'Motorama"", 'do', 'think', 'was', 'interesting', 'premise', 'film', 'just', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'do', 'know', 'marketing', 'film', 'misleading', 'probably', 'purposefully', 'so', 'Looking', 'DVD', 'cover', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'significant', 'role', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'Other', 'cameos', 'include', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'Gus', 'show', 'everyone', 'else', 'support', 'obstacle', 'quest', 'quest', 'ultimately', 'never', 'get', 'neutral', 'gear', 'inspired', 'idea', 'indifferent', 'unruffled']",N/A
331740,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302756413,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 5]","Written by Joseph Minion (After Hours, Vampire's Kiss) and directed by Barry Shils (Wigstock: The Movie), Motorama (1991) stars Jordan Christopher Michael (""Full House"", The Favor) as Gus, a ten year old boy from a dysfunctional family who decides one day to take it on the road.  Also appearing is a great many semi-recognizable names and/or faces including Dick Miller (Piranha), Jack Nance (""Twin Peaks""), Robert Picardo (""Star Trek: Voyager""), Flea (The Blue Iguana), Mary Woronov (Night of the Comet), Garrett Morris (""Saturday Night Live""), Michael J. Pollard (Roxanne), John Diehl (Stargate), Martha Quinn (Chopper Chicks in Zombietown), Sandy `Jack Klompus' Baron (""Seinfeld""), Vince Edwards (""Ben Casey""), Meat Loaf (Fight Club), Charles Tyner (The Longest Yard), Irwin Keyes (House of 1000 Corpses), Susan Tyrrell (Cry-Baby), Shelley Berman (Meet the Fockers), and Drew Barrymore (Scream), who is featured prominently on the DVD cover but appears for all of about ten seconds in the film.As I mentioned earlier, Jordan Christopher Michael plays Gus, a ten year old boy who, fed up with this messed up family, decides to hit the road by stealing a cherry late model Mustang.  Now I should probably mention the film, which appears to be set in the American southwest, actually takes place in a sort of alternate type reality where the states have different names than those we might expect...for example, the landscape featured may lead one to believe we're in Arizona, but within the film a sign might say we're in the state of Essex.  Anyway, along the way Gus starts participating in a game called `Motorama', sponsored by a gas station chain.  The game involves cards that are given to customers after purchasing at least five dollars of gas.  As participants collect cards, they remove the affixed sticker, hopefully to reveal a letter, the idea being to collect all the letters to spell out the word `Motorama' and win the grand prize which is 500 million dollars.  As Gus travels from filling station to filling station (always buying only five dollars worth of gas), he comes across all kinds of bizarre individuals including a pious gas station attendant (Diehl), a motel operator (Nance) who has an unusual prejudice towards squirrels, a psychotic, simple-minded busboy (Flea), a vindictive security systems designer (Baron), and so on...as Gus collects more and more cards, the game becomes somewhat of an obsession, one that begins to take its toll both physically and mentally (Gus seems to be aging fairly rapidly).  Eventually his travels lead Gus to a virtual no man's land, a nightmarish state marked by an over industrialized landscape (oil refineries and what not) and a plethora of individuals even more bizarre that previously experienced, all in search of the final card he needs to win the game, or so he thinks (as always, be sure to read the fine print).If what I've written doesn't make a whole lot of sense, then you should try watching this film.  I suppose there's a message or two that emerges by the end, but after about ten minutes in I stopped trying to comprehend of much of what happened as the story doesn't seem to be written to accommodate viewers expecting a straightforward tale.  By the way, on the surface this may appear to be a film geared towards children but that's certainly not the case as there is some violence, profanity, and even a bit of nekkidness, all of which contributed to the movie's `R' rating.  There are some comedic bits throughout, but many of these seem to include a dark element.  One scene in particular features Gus, in need of funds, stopping at a roadside rest stop and challenging a family man, played by Dick Miller, to a game of horseshoes for money.  Miller's character loses and has to pay up, forcing him to pull a Hansel and Gretel routine on his two, small children (seems he can afford to support his entire clan the rest of their journey).  This is the tone of much of the humor, so if it doesn't sound appealing, then you'd best skip this film altogether.  I'm unsure if I was supposed to like the character of Gus as throughout the film he's portrayed as not only a criminal (stealing a car, Motorama cards, and siphoning gas), but he also appeared a somewhat smarmy, smart-mouthed, patronizing punk in need of a beating (which he does receive, more than once).  But then again it's not like I related to any of the grownups in the movie, so whatever...I mentioned earlier a number of performers appearing in the film but one should known most of these performances are brief as Jordan Christopher Michael is the only person we spend any meaningful amount of time with...he seems like a decent actor but with this type of material it seemed to me one could act any number of ways and still have the film come off relatively the same, that being an eccentric road trip into the land of the mondo.  There was one aspect I found annoying, even after I stopped trying to make sense of things, and that was the near the end when things come full circle, in a manner of speaking.  At times it seemed the film was being weird just for the sake of being weird (which I dislike), but other times there seemed some genuineness, so I'm willing to give the movie the benefit of the doubt.  All in all this is a real curiosity piece, one that probably won't appeal to most audiences.The picture format on this Columbia/Tristar DVD release seems something of an oddity to me as it is presented in fullscreen anamorphic.  That's right, I said fullscreen anamorphic...what the hell is the point?  Seems to me those interested in only the fullscreen format would care less if the picture was anamorphic, and those interested in the anamorphic aspect would be looking for the original aspect ratio as presented theatrically.  Either way it is kind of a shame as there are tons of scenic desert vista shots that would have come across much better in the original widescreen format.  The picture itself comes across clean, and the Dolby Surround 2.0 audio comes through well enough, with subtitles available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  As far as extras there's squat, unless you count a trailer for the 2001 David Spade film The Adventures of Joe Dirt, which I don't...Cookieman108By the way, Andy Summers, former member of the band The Police, supplied the original music for this film.  Some of it's good, but there was a repetitive quality that got on my nerves a little.",4,"""I forgot to tell you...if you catch any squirrels, give them to me.""",1160697600,"10 13,

331743,AY12DBB0U420B,6302756413,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","I pick a lot of my movies for night-time viewing off the DVD bargain rack at Ross stores. I know, it's a little weird, and it requires something of a depth of knowledge regarding entertainment, but, what the hey, you can get a DVD for under 4 bucks and sometimes they're really good. Last's night's selection was ""Motorama."" I was really uncertain about this one because the rack was really depleted and four of those left out of about a dozen were Motorama. I'd never heard of the movie. There was nothing on the DVD case that made it look interesting or appealing. Then I spotted the names Flea, Meat Loaf and music by Andy Summers. Hmmmmm. That made it worth a try.Motorama is a really, really weird movie. It's like having a long very realistic, drawn out  and bizarre dream, but one that twists and turns when you least expect it and goes off in all sorts of strange and unexpected directions. I didn't really understand it at all the first night  I  viewed it, but it was somehow compelling viewing. What can I say? Tonight I was back viewing it again. Go figure. Here I am re-viewing a movie I didn't particularly care for two nights in a row, and I still don't understand it. I don't think it has any deep meaning. And I'm not going to try to give it one.Motorama is the story of a ten-year-old boy driving a bright red stolen Mustang across five desert ""states."" The states are all whimsically named and the movie was apparently shot in the greater four-corners region (New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona) of the Colorado Plateau at a time when the speed limit on wide-open highways was 55. The boy (Gus) was playing a gas company game of Motorama in which cards given out for the purchase of at least five dollars worth of gas could be collected. When the top was removed, it might reveal a letter and if you got all letters in the word Motorama, then you were eligible for the grand prize. Of course, no one ever won the grand prize (a half-billion dollars), but it could be a game of excitement and fond recollections. The movie chronicles Gus' surrealistic journey. Do you like strange and really creepy characters? Then this is a movie for you. Do you like Unexpected, unexplained and unresolved twists in the plot? This is your movie. Do you like leaving a movie and wondering what the hell was that all about and then keep wondering for days afterwards? Here it is, folks.Personally, I didn't particularly care all that much for the movie. It's well done. No question. The filming was excellent. The sound is good.

The disc is very good quality, no real image quality problems to speak of. The sound was fine, i didnt really notice any problems or any spectacular moments. Extras are pretty much non existant, so dont buy it expecting anything but the movie itself. The film is strange, as stated before the 10 year old boy runs away from home, and goes cross country in a mythical country, very similar to america or canada. along the way he meets a cast of crazy characters, mostly horribly mean, and starts to play a gasstation game, MOTORAMA. There isnt much more to the movie. It consists of Gus buying/stealing motorama cards then getting beat up, i nthat order for a good hour. Then the ending comes up, and unless you like thinking about your movies your gonna hate the ending. It is very stange, and you kinda have to draw your own conclusion as to whats going on. The ending reminded me of Baron Munchausen's finale. The acting isnt spectaular, the script isnt astounding, but its fun enuff to watch once just for entertainemnt value. rent this when you have nothing better to do o na rainy afternoon.

""What's the point?"".Some have labeled ""Motorama"" as the worst movie they've ever seen.I feel sorry those who possess such a miniscule scope of imagination when it comes to the world of cinema.At the end of the film.... wasn't Gus back where he started?  And what does this normally tell us has happened?  Was it actually something that he experienced.... or something he dreamed/imagined?No... this is not a cinematic masterpiece.  In fact, there is one scene in which the editing is so terrible, they literally missed a huge on-screen error.  During the gas station scene (which is set in the middle of ""no-where, Canada""), the attendant is supposedly alone when Gus arrives.  Gus cuts the man's kite string... the man runs down the barren highway.... then lo and behold... on the left-hand side of the screen we can see several people running beside the road as well.  Obviously, the director thought they were out of sight for the camera... but they weren't... and this stood out to me as a huge error in the film.But the story itself is unlike any other.  It should be noted that even those who have complained and whined and panned this movie.... most have admitted that they sat and watched the entire film.  Why?  Because this movie is mesmerizing to view.  Whether someone wishes to admit it or not, it is literally impossible to get up and walk away from this film.  And the reason is quite simple.... it's fascinating to the mind.... and we don't know where the story is going to take us next.  Seems to me, that is a key element of success in any work of art.... in film or otherwise.Although ""Motorama"" does star a 10-year-old boy in the lead role, this is definitely not a film for children.And for those hoping to see Drew Barrymore, her role in this film is not likely more than 30 seconds.I am willing to admit that this film drew me in from the start, and I never paused the film to grab a soda or snack.

331753,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,6302756413,The Night Falcon,"[5, 9]","Well, here comes another one of my long reviews which I think this movie warrants. So, go get a cup of coffee or your favourite tea, and curl up for some good reading. I'll have to leave some parts out of my review, because Amazon's computers only hold about 9 pages of Microsoft word text and this review ended a little over 10 pages when I was done.When writing a screen play, you should know that film makers are taught in film school that there are no meaningless details in any screen play. However, when you first view Motorama, you have to either think the writer was on drugs when Joseph Minion wrote it or he was writing from a brilliant premise and knew what he was doing. There is no third choice. The best way to understand this film, in my experience as a scientist and a scholar, is to break it down from a metaphysical standpoint. By metaphysical, I mean scientific or even a supernatural-ethereal perspective. Supernatural does not mean this story is out there in left field with its reality, not when you really know what the Universe is all about, but that there are things about this story; it will take our science to explain. The study of mythology and the religions of the world help too in breaking down the format of this film.First off, there is a major scientific premise you have to first wrap your mind around when you first view this film and study its format. The format premise in the script is that the boy, Gus, in this film, goes through what is called in scientific circles as a ""causality loop"" or predestination paradox in quantum physics dealing with time travel. A ""what loop"" you just asked? Well, you can read up on it more in Wikipedia, if you'd like. Basically it is a phenomena described in forth dimensional mathematics where it is possible to move through time and space from one point, go to an endpoint and wind up back where you started as the end point of your journey while negating all points in between. Put in simpler mathematical terms, it can be written as A = B; B = C; C = D; so A = D; where D becomes A in the end and points B and C never happened. It's another way of describing a sort of circle, but it is a circle that finally negates all the other parts of the circle, once you arrive at the end, as though the circle never existed in the first place. This is the premise this film operates under; as Gus, the boy in this film, reaches the end of the loop in the script or story line, negating his original journey, once it is over; while not forgetting what he learned when he is returned to point A. Want it simpler? A layman's way of putting it, is he gets a second chance at life by the Universe, starting from one specific point in his past, by being sent back into time to try it again. Naturally, causality loops are only theoretical, but they are plausible in the study of time travel.So, here is a detail of this story called Motorama and its spiritual and/or metaphysical premises, as best as I can communicate it in our language. If you grab onto the movie at the level of thinking I just detailed out, a lot of the down to earth particulars will more easily fall into place and make sense after you watch this film several times; maybe even a dozen times.Anyway, enters ten year old Gus (Jordan Christopher Michael) at the start of the movie; living near the bizarre State of South Lydon. Is it planet Earth in a parallel Universe? Who knows? Gus is a kind, sweet, loving, courageous and brave boy, who is born to parents who are held together only, through lust, sex and hate: Parents who know nothing about real love. Understand, that throughout this entire film, the only sane person in this film will be this boy; Gus. All adults are seen as either stupid, passive, delusional or psychotic: More correctly; the adults who pursue money are the true sinners of Gus's world the writer would have us understand, and are cruel; but not the boy Gus who is simply trying to survive it all. The play of good vs. evil in this film is interesting to, say the least. That message is brought out early in the story when Gus pulls up to a gas station, early in the story, where he meets Phil, the station attendant, (John Diehl); for the first time. You find throughout the film that the law is always Gus's true friend represented by the police officer in the story, even though Gus fears the law. All the dead things the world has to offer, including material wealth, are Gus's enemy.Gus goes through three cleansings in this film that make him more divine through each cleansing, as he wises up to how the real world really is, with all its hypocrisy, evil and cruelties. These cleansings are symbolized by the appearance of water in the movie each time Gus must wash himself, as he becomes more whole in his understanding of the world. Fire and water always are symbolic of cleansing in mythology or dream language too, which is why it is easy to first think this whole thing is a dream, when its not.By the way, the Mustang in this film that Gus drives is not what I would call ""a cherry red"" in color, like some of the other reviewers describe it. It's more an orange/red color. Cherry would be a much deeper red than the color used on Gus's Mustang. Its interesting this color is used, because in civilized culture, such a color screams ""harlot"" and says something about the journey Gus is about to embark on, as life ""rapes"" this kid of his innocence while he travels through Hell and back in his own heroes journey to find true freedom in a world that is truly insane, but wears masks to hide its insanity.From the beginning we know Gus is divine, as evidenced by his nearly golden blonde hair and his kindness toward others in his journey, as well as toward life in his efforts to survive a hellish path he has been put on. Someone on one of the IMDB chat boards called him a ""punk"" in this film. No doubt that person never got even this far in understanding the metaphysics behind this story's premise. Gus is no punk, but frankly a saint going through an incredible journey no ten year old should have to face. We live in too sanguine a culture these days in the developed countries, with everyone too protected in their lives, who write some of these reviews I've noted over the years. You should try visiting some orphanages to see the tougher side of life kids have to face, not to mention how children were treated a hundred or more years ago, as they tried to survive in this world without real love or when they lost their real parents.I don't see it an accident that Jordan Christopher Michael was chosen for this role. I think the Universe and casting director (Linda Francis) picked this boy to play this role, because his heavenly, beautiful male looks play a heavy role in the message behind the metaphysics and mythological side of this film in my view and what defines a divine nature vs. total depravity in a person. Jordan carried his character extremely well in this movie. Its clear Jordan was a bright kid and easy to direct. I was mesmerized watching this boy's acting. He should be highly praised for pulling off such a character on screen, having been given such a challenging role to play in a motion picture film. For a ten year old boy to carry an entire film like this, takes real talent and great direction on the part of the director (Barry Shils)What Gus puts up with, would take any ten year old great courage and bravery to go through in today's world. If you start with all this in mind, you'll do well to get into the head of the writer. A number of scenes appear comical in content through this film and I think people tend to respond this way, because they can not see the horror this boy is going through, as he tries to survive his journey through hell on Earth, while having the veil of innocence taken away that keeps most ten year olds from seeing the way the world truly is; full of idiots, mindless gnomes, liars of every kind and cruelty un-imaginable.After Gus takes his parent's Mustang, having made leg extensions for his feet to reach the gas peddle and brake peddle, his first stop is at a place called the ""Wagon Wheel"". The very name Wagon WHEEL is our first clue Gus is about to enter into a causality loop. He meets a sleazy bunch of characters (Harper Flaherty, Susan Tyrrell, John Laughlan and Kurt Bryant). It is here where Gus first gets his first disgusting taste of the world and the cruelty people have toward each other through total indifference, because they are afraid of anyone outside their private orbit of friends. People form ""clicks"", because it makes them feel comfortable and in control of the world around them, when in truth, none of us are in control of much of anything that happens in our lives, if we were to truly take a look at our lives at any given moment.Gus does not stay at this place, after ordering a coffee; and is quickly back into his Mustang, down the road looking for his future. It is at this time, he pulls off the road and goes through his first spiritual cleansing, symbolized by a stream where he washes his face. Prior to this scene, two of the men in the Wagon Wheel throw an old man into the river. This is where we are told the final scene in the loop, before it happens in the Chimera tower at the end where Gus is thrown through the mylar window to his supposed death. The man's head is wounded pouring blood into the stream. The stream is full of old rusting parts, symbolic of death and decay. Gus is ""baptized"" into the pathway of blood, hell or death he must travel through first, before he sees the truth about the world and himself in the world, as far as what is truly important in life. Too bad parents like to shield their children from movies like this, because life is all a far cry from being Disneyland in the end.Once back into his Mustang, he sees his first MOTORAMA sign and decides his wealth, as well as a good future, lies in his playing the game to make his fortune, providing he fills his tank every $5 fill to get Motorama cards. He fails to see from the get go that even once he gets all eight cards, it does not mean he is an instant winner, but what he learns in the end makes for an ending with quite a twist in it and this is where the causality loop premise enters the film at the end of the story which you don't see coming. This is why some people put in their reviews that they thought the whole thing was a dream, but it isn't; because Phil, at the end of the story, is not made whole from his contact with the white truck of death. However, Gus is made whole. So we are dealing with a form of time travel in this story, not a dream, if all the parts are to make sense. This film should have been marketed as a science fiction film once you see this. Keep this in mind when you watch this film. Everything is really happening to Gus, in other words, and this is no dream.His first stop is at a gas station run by a sweetheart of a fellow named Phil (John Diehl). Phil represents heaven on earth and Gus is given the chance to work at the gas station, stop his pursuit of Motorama and work at the station where he will have a good life and be loved which he can't see yet. This is the preverbal ""fork in the road"" for Gus's spiritual path. The sign over the gas pumps, which read ""Be-Full Filled"", states it all with what the world is all about, before Gus learns to let go of the world for all the emptiness it has to offer as a fulfilment. I interpret the sign to mean that from that point on in the road where the gas station is located, all is emptiness and when you've had your fill of all the emptiness life has to offer, only then can you receive the light of the Universe and be fully satisfied with what God originally handed you. Phil represents Gus's salvation and redemption in the end, but Gus does not see this right away either. The law officer, named Jerry Perkins, also represents Gus's salvation in the film, played by Robert Picardo. This is the lesson Gus is about to learn.Phil also has this kite flying, which he wants God to see, so he goes to heaven when he dies. However, as Gus leaves the station in his Mustang, he releases the kite to go down the road ahead of him, forcing Phil to run to save his kite, so his message reaches God. Instead, Phil runs into a white truck coming down the road out of no where, which puts Phil into a full body cast we see at the end of the movie. This truck appears three times in this film and each time it appears, it comes as the ""angel of death"" in the film to kill whoever is travelling this roadway to hell and emptiness.The number three is common throughout the Universe. This entire Universe we live in is based on the number three in every way and three is always the number of divine calling, either in death or mastery of ascent. You see this in all the religions of the world, as well as mythology. The fact that Gus must wash himself three times in the story, symbolizes his spiritual cleansing of first, his mind, then heart, then body, as he awakens at the soul level to see things the way they really are and go beyond all the masks people wear to cover up their evil hearts. Trust me, not one adult in this movie, except the gas station attendants and the police officer, has a good heart as the story unfolds. You learn to hate everyone who is cruel to Gus throughout the film.The ""death truck"", which is what I like to call it, is also symbolic of three near death encounters Gus must go through, as he is reborn through each near death encounter; where the last death out of the Chimera tower might count as a forth death, it is really just a looping back into the first cleansing Gus receives where Gus first started his journey, which ends the causality loop and a rebirth and resurrection for Gus in the end. Just buy the DVD. Read my review again and it will all make great sense.We learn the roadway Gus is on is indeed the roadway to hell, as soon as Gus leaves the gas station where he met Phil; for we hear the song ""highway to hell"" playing on his car radio to help get that point across. As he begins his journey, we see a sign on the side of the road that says ""Welcome to South Lydon - The Lonesome State"". While I'm not sure what South Lydon is suppose to mean, I think all of us can identify with the words ""lonesome"" which pretty well sums up Gus's journey in a nutshell. There are three other States we see on the way. Welcome to Tristana - the Green State: Welcome to Bergen - the Long State and Welcome to Essex - the Last State. We are eventually shown a map of this world Gus lives in and also learn there is a State called Mercer. None of this exists on the current Earth we live in I might add. If this is on another planet or parallel Universe, it's nice to see they like the Ford Mustang. I always loved that particular model myself.From here on, things only get worse for Gus in his quest for the wealth of the world to support him, given how intolerable his parents were to live with. As he leaves the gas station, he goes through these different ""states of ascended consciousness"" which are actually different states of transformation for Gus, as his life's journey teaches him the divine path through abject humiliation and deficiency of every kind. This is what the physical States mean in the movie that he keeps passing through. Gus is even told by Phil that their current life is not really important. Even the money in Phil's pocket, which he shows to Gus and throws away, is meaningless, but Gus doesn't get the message right away that his pursuit after Motorama is not the answer to his happiness. So we see in Phil all that is pure and good in the world at the spiritual level on the Earth. Phil represents the human attached to no material possessions which brings perfect peace. The same message was taught in ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon""; the story of St. Francis of Assisi.  Even the gas station Phil operates which is new and fresh looking, sits in the middle of no where, serving as a reminder of how people do not see pure gold, as something you find in the unlikely of places when it comes to real truth.In fact, in all the great literary stories; you find that all true wisdom and useful knowledge is not found in the grand office buildings of life, but in the caves and cubby holes of life. This has been my real experience with the world also, even as a scholar, who has lived as long as I have dealing with this world. This is where the true sages are to be found, because their insight into absolute truth is something the world puts no monetary value on. As such these sages and wise men must seek out modest accommodations to keep a roof over their head. This is the main reason why you don't find them in expensive office buildings. Only liars and cheats are usually found in expensive office buildings, because these people cheat their victims out of their money, while delivering a cover up to the real truth in their promises. This is what Gus will learn in the end when the story fully plays out. We as the audience get to share in his lessons, as the story unfolds. It all makes for great story telling I might add.Gus's next stop is at a Motel with a deranged Motel manager (Jack Nance) who loves to kill squirrels. The significance of the squirrels is not made clear to me in this movie, but the deranged manager tells the audience Gus has embarked into the world of the insane. All masks are removed off of all adults in this movie, so you can see their true nature, unlike the way people might act toward you in life. When the masks are removed, we learn underneath each mask, which people wear in life, are depraved, crazed people who grew to be adults and who have all sorts of phobias and hatred in them or a form of abject darkness. Gus learns fast that the entire world is as crazy as his parents, full of sin and wickedness of every kind, but he keeps his focus on his dream goal and that is to become rich through Motorama, so he can find his heaven on earth; so to speak. In fact, once in his hotel room, Gus sees himself in the hotel room mirror in a tweed suit with a cigar and his hair slicked back. It is here where he becomes an adult in his thinking and starts to play the world's game, realizing his goal will not be easy to achieve.He leaves the Motel and travels the road where he stops at a scenic view where a young couple has sex in the back seat of his car. (Cynthia King) This scene really has no significance to me quite frankly. However, in film schools, you are taught that all successful films must have focus on power, money and sex in them, so maybe Joseph Minion was simply taking liberty to add the sex part to the story equation, given he had already covered the power and money issue quite well. But since there are suppose to be no meaningless details in any screenplay, there may be a meaning I'm missing in my study of this film. Hard to tell: Otherwise this part could have been left out of the story in my opinion.Next, one of Gus's tires blows in need of repair or replacement. He is forced to stop at a gas station to get a replacement tire by two gas station owners. (Garrett Morris and Michael J. Pollard) Along the way the officer appears again (Robert Picardo) to check up on Gus to make sure he is alright. Always the police officer, who represents the law is kind to Gus and is Gus's friend. I sense some influence from Alfred Hitchcock films here, because Hitchcock always hated policemen, since he was a boy; when you read up on his work. So, Hitchcock made officers to be somewhat creepy in his films, as a result. Hitchcock didn't care too much for the world system and its ills, including the establishment, seeing it all as un-natural and something that never should have been created. So you get a sense of that with the police officer in this film I've noted.Gus then needs more money, so he pulls into a cafeteria type eatery where he buys a false nose and moustache out of a machine. He wears it on his face and then enters the main kitchen, saying he is there to do a surprise inspection. It's humorous, but a bit creepy that everyone can not see he is only a ten year old boy telling them what to do. He manages to con $30 off the chief (Paul Willson) for his sloppy kitchen and pays a bus boy (Flea) to help get him a gas can and hose to siphon gas from an elder couples car (Sandy Baron and Mary Woronov) to put into Gus's car. But he gets caught by the couple and is whacked by the owner of the car (Sandy Baron) who badly damages Gus's left eye.The metaphysics behind this part of the script suggests Gus is starting to lose sight of what is truly important in life, when he loses his one eye. Even when the doctor comes (Vince Edwards), that the couple calls, to see what can be done about Gus's eye, the owner of the car (Sandy Baron) says ""Loss builds character"" which drives the message more home what Gus is to learn about life and the things he took for granted, like the health of his body.It is at this time Gus has a dream of being on a beach with a beautiful girl calling to him (Drew Barrymore) telling him he has not won Motorama yet. Then Gus sees in his dream that he has sand crabs crawling all over his feet, which creeps him out while he screams himself awake. Feet always represent the spiritual pathway in dreams, if we go by what Edgar Casey says about the symbol of feet, even in dreams. So to have crabs at your feet in a dream means your spiritual pathway is blocked by something ugly that needs to be taken out of the path in order for true progress to be made. The couple who had kidnapped Gus then cover his mouth with lipstick while putting a patch over his damaged left eye, but he is released in the morning, after suffering the abuse and humiliation this couple put him through. It is here where Gus learns all things have a price attached to them in life. At this point, Gus goes through a second spiritual cleansing, symbolized by an old tractor wheel full of water. The tractor wheel is a revelation to all of us that Gus is in a causality loop. Washing his face to get the lipstick off and clean his badly beaten left eye is the symbol of the cleansing of his heart and opening of his inner spiritual vision. The first cleansing was just his face, symbolic of the cleansing of his mind. A third cleansing is yet to come.Gus's next stop is at a Beer Joint where he meets Vern (Meat Loaf), who is arm wrestling for dollars. Gus is forced into an impossible arm wrestle when the police officer enters the beer joint and Gus must put up some kind of smoke screen to make sure the officer doesn't discover him there. But his cleverness gets him into trouble with the bikers who want to collect on his lost rounds of arm wrestling. Gus lets them know he is playing Motorama and needs the missing letters TORA, which the bikers are glad to give Gus by giving Gus a major tattooing on his right arm with those letters and the mark of the serpent on his forearm.You should know that usually the sign of the serpent in most of mythology, other than Christian, is a sign that the hero on his journey is about to consume the power of the serpent after mastering it in battle. In Christian culture, the serpent is the sign of the Devil. Still, I think my first definition applies in this film, not the Christian version.So Gus is now minus one eye, with the arm sleeve of his running parka torn where his arm has been marked with the serpent, as a sign he is overcoming the evil in his journey on the ascended masters path to divinity. I could not help but think of the movie ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" when Gus is left with the word ""TORA"" on his right arm or the cry matadors make when they are fighting a bull in a bull ring to taunt the bull. Such is the cry of any warrior who has gone into battle to save his life or his homeland, if you were born in Asia or Spain. All signs point to Gus being a warrior going through the heart of hell in the story which I think the writing is bringing forth rather well; when you put all the symbols together.Vern (Meat Loaf) even refers to Gus as an ""old pirate"", not seeing he is addressing a 10 year old boy, but Gus is really not a pirate in this story, but a brave hero. These remarks also show how people in the world judge only the surface value of each person they see and not the depth of a person they meet. Gus's hair keeps changing along the way, showing he is aging, as the story progresses. You should know that accelerated aging of the body related to exposure to conditions of chronic fear can really happen in any animal, especially man. Gus's loss of his hair and change in hair color, with it going white at the end of the film, is a real medical phenomenon. So Gus is losing his youth and innocence fast through this nightmare of a life he is experiencing.Next Gus approaches a picnic area where he plays a few games of horse shoes with a man (Dick Miller) to win some gas money, which he successfully does. I remember first seeing Dick Miller in the Disney movie Explorers. I loved that film except for its ending. Anyway, this scene between the woman and her son (Sandy Williams and Jacob Kenner) where her son points to Gus saying Gus is a man with only one eye, proves I'm understanding what is happening to Gus when Gus responds ""That's alright. I use to be the same way!"" meaning Gus use to be innocent with full physical eyesight like the boy with his mother. It is here we learn Gus is really waking up to what the world really is all about where the full loss of his innocence is complete. While he has lost his one physical eye, his spiritual eyesight is coming to bear, as he sees the world the way it really is in absolute truth and not what Gus might have believed at first. Gus sees the world is a pig sty full of evil people who are all crazy. Still this is only true, if you travel the highway to hell, like the song said earlier in the story when Gus left Phil at the gas station. After Gus wins $100 from the guy he plays horse shoes with, he's back on the road again searching out his fortune by collecting Motorama cards.Gus finally passes through a tunnel that says ""Entering Essex: The Last State"".  As Gus exits the tunnel, he sees the total abject depravity of the world. I had to ""stop and go"" my DVD player to see the scenes being played out at this point, given they go by so fast and here is what I saw: A drug attic in his living room shooting up; a hooker catching a business man; a homeless man; a battered housewife; shooting of the Pope, symbolic of religious hatred; and racial discrimination represented by the burning of a black man by the KKK. I'm sure, if the film makers could have kept the time down in the final cut of the film, they would have added more scenes like this to show the atrocities of the world to make a more full plate of the world's horrors Gus must see at this point in his life's journey. Gus drives slowly through this area, as he watches all the worlds' best atrocities at work. Given he has only one eye to see with, he no longer sees duality in the symbolism of his vision, but sees with only one eye of absolute truth.It is here where he stops at a Motel and washes for the third time in a shower. This time he is washing his whole body, completing his full divine transformation. It is here where he sees what all the sins of the world are about and where they lead. This is the place where wisdom is now being birthed into Gus, but has not fully bloomed yet. Gus is about to meet his redemption; symbolized by the missing ""R"" he still needs to complete his Motorama card deck he has been collecting.Finally, he enters the city where the Motorama corporate officers work at and his last gas stop; hoping for the final ""R"" needed to complete his journey. At this point the white truck appears again, nearly killing him, but he swerves his beautiful Mustang car out of the way. Another car has already crashed. It is here Gus meets his older self. This older self is ending another causality loop inside the loop Gus is already travelling in that we, as the audience, don't know about just yet. We learn the other car has an old man (Charles Tyner) in it that has been playing Motorama all his life and is also looking for the final ""R"" needed to complete his deck of cards. The old man dies while giving a warning to Gus the ""R"" is just up the road. When Gus gets to his final gas station, he washes his hands of the blood from the old man and sees in the mirror where he is washing up, that he is the old man when he looks at his reflection. He still looks the same as his ten year old body which has aged, when he walks away from the mirror. His hair has gone grey and white, even though he is still only 10 years old.There is only one big red button at this last station that sounds off a siren to call for service. Once pushed, only the attendant Elmer (Irwin Keyes), a hunchback, can turn off the siren. When the attendant appears, we find he is not too bright and acts more like a mindless Gnome. Gus simply asks for $5 of gas again and gets one Motorama card. To his surprise he learns it's the final card he needs to fulfil his deck of eight M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A cards.From here he goes to the Chimera corporate headquarters, who has sponsored the contest, thinking he has won, only to find out he is now only ""eligible"" to win the grand prize of $500 million dollars and that he has not won anything yet. Hurt and angry, he takes the elevators to the floor of this very tall skyscraper to talk to Miss Lawton (Robin Duke) who tells him all of this on the lobby phone in the corporate offices. Prior to his talk with this secretary Miss Lawton, he meets the receptionist (Allyce Beasley). I remember Beasley playing the receptionist in the old television series Moonlighting which started a yet to be famous Bruce Willis back in my youth in my early twenties. When he learns that Miss Lawton is only a secretary, he insists on seeing the ""head honcho"" in charge of Motorama. Instead both Miss Lawton and a security guard (Marvin Elkins) take away his cards and hurl Gus out through the mylar windows of the high rise, 102 stories up, where it appears Gus falls to his death. During his fall, his tattoo disappears off his right arm and his arm sleeve is returned to normal. His hair returns to its normal color and his eye is made whole while his eye patch flies off his head. When he lands at the bottom, where there is a water pool at the bottom of the tower, Gus finds himself back at the first stopping place in the movie where he first washed his face. The causality loop is complete. Gus has all the wisdom now to tell him not to take the Motorama road when he sees the Motorama sign, through this second chance at real life and real love he has just been given by the Universe.From here, he throws away his foot extensions he used to drive the Mustang and leaves the Mustang abandoned, so his cruel parents will never find him. As he hitchhikes for a ride, he is picked up by the kindly police officer (Robert Picardo), who is off duty in a station wagon, asking where Gus would like to go. Gus says doesn't know. So, the officer takes him to the gas station where Phil is in a full body cast, like I said at the beginning of this review. Since the causality loop begins before the gas station scene with Phil, it is hard to understand why Phil's body is not whole as well. I think Joseph Minion was just trying to reinforce the idea that all of this actually did happen to Gus and was no dream. Still, Phil's body should be whole too to make the science correct.Having been offered the job at the gas station in the beginning of the film, Gus takes the job, finally realizing that he can only find true happiness among those who are alive, kind and caring like Phil, not the road to material riches which is full of death and deceit.The next morning, Gus fills the tank of a car belonging to a man who has just won a million dollars at a local casino (Shelley Berman). This man teases Gus with the money, but Gus is not interested. As the new millionaire leaves the station to travel down the road that leads to hell, the white truck appears for the third time taking this man's life to end his evil attitude. The movie ends with Gus and Phil together at the place where all truth begins and so ends the movie. (Rev 3d)",5,Motorama or Motortrauma?

Unfortunately, some knowledge of myths and legends is required to fully understand a lot of the details and references. Since its release it's been sent to inappropriate audiences to unsuccessfully fend for itself. People seem to hate it or like it for what I sense are all the wrong reasons.The information on the packaging is COMPLETELY misleading. Re-marketed and set in front of the right viewers I think this would be judged a minor classic. It's a lost movie that needs some help. A Criterion release of this film might place it in the right hands, as incredible as that may sound to detractors.Four stars because it's not perfect, but it's still in my top 50.PS: I'm finding this movie in $3 bargain bins.

The film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual; like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.Most of the characters are nasty to Gus on his trip. They tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. Some oddball actors like David Lynch incumbent Jack Nance, Meat Loaf &amp; Flea also make appearences.
