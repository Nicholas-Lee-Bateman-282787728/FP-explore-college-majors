182593,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,1559600136,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","Sidney Sheldon won the Oscar for his original screenplay of this bright B&W; comedy from 1947, which inverts the usual generational split between youth and maturity.  Myrna Loy stars as a conservative judge who encounters Cary Grant, an artist with a penchant for getting into night-club scrapes, in her courtroom.  Shortly thereafter Grant attracts the attention of the Judge's high-school-aged sister (played by Shirley Temple), who becomes fixated on him.  To defuse the situation the judge orders Cary to date Shirley, with predictably comic results.  Grant and Loy were so smooth together that they were paired the following year in MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, with even greater hilarity.  Temple, in an ing&eacute;nue role, performs well as does her ""regular"" teen-age beau (Johnny Sands); watching the two of them try to act like sober adults is fun in itself.  A very capable supporting cast includes Ray Collins and Rudy Vallee.

Margaret's teenage sister Susan (Shirley Temple) later forms a strong infatuation for Richard, so Margaret ""sentences"" him to date Susan until the crush runs it's natural course.  Things get complicated when Richard starts falling for Margaret, and Susan starts talking about marriage!A surprise Academy Award winner for 'Best Original Screenplay' in 1947, THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER is an irresistible screwball comedy with the brilliant star combination of Cary Grant and Myrna Loy--who went on to be paired the following year in ""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"".  Shirley Temple puts in a fun performance as the lovestruck teen trying to act more mature.  The cast also features Rudy Vallee, Ray Collins, Harry Davenport and Johnny Sands.Despite the fun exhibited on the screen, by all accounts the shoot was not a happy one for Cary Grant.  He reportedly hated director Irving Reis (and wanted RKO to bring in Leo McCarey, with whom he'd just worked in ""The Bishop's Wife"").  Nevertheless, THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER opened to rave reviews in 1947, and strong box-office receipts helped the struggling RKO Studios through a very lean financial period.The DVD release also features the Technicolor cartoon ""Little Tinker"", complete audio of the Lux Theater radio broadcast with Grant and Temple reprising their roles; and a Cary Grant trailer gallery.

He finds himself doing things that really don't suit his age. Eventually, he gets together with her elder sister, Margaret.This is Cary Grant's 50th movie and his second with Myrna Loy, and the only time he will be directed by Irving Reis. THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER, is an interesting movie, which won an Oscar for Best Screenplay for Sidney Sheldon.Grant plays Richard Nugent, a gentleman painter, who gets caught up in a public disturbance in a nightclub, and appears before Judge Margaret Turner, played by Myrna Loy. His case is dismissed because of lack of evidence.That day Mr. Nugent appears at the local high school where Ms. Turner's sister, Susan, played by Shirley Temple, goes to school and Susan immediately, develops a crush on Nugent, her knight in shining armor. Susan goes to Nugent's apartment under the pretext of getting her portrait painted, and Margaret comes to her rescue, but hits the assistant district attorney and is put in jail.It is decided by Susan's uncle, a psychologist, that in order for Susan to get over Nugent and have his sentence reduced, that he should make a play for Susan. It all comes off so incredibly easy, and in turn Margaret and Richard become attracted to one another.Cary is at his best in playing Richard Nugent and the review from THE NEW YORK TIMES, dated July 25, 1947, states, ""The performance of Cary Grant . . . is one of the brightest and sharpest of his many light comedy jobs.

There's the marquee value of a seductively handsome Cary Grant coupled with that spunky symbol of all-American innocence Shirley Temple, enough at the time to draw in ticket-buying throngs with its naughty innuendo of daring departure and forbidden pleasure. In fact, the underage subtext lingers beneath much of the movie's plot and humorous settings, but in a totally innocent manner, proving that this is not yet the more permissive 1960's. One slip, however, and this light-hearted souffle could easily have become burnt-toast of the most tasteless variety. Fortunately, there are no slips.Once the pace picks up, this comedy sparkles as brightly as any other Cary Grant madcap, which is to say, about as good as comedy gets. The night club scene is an absolute triumph of timing, staging, and scripting. The laughs build as the party table becomes more and more chaotic, interrupted by one petty annoyance after another, finally reducing the worldly Grant to speechless exasperation. This is the type of soaring comedic architecture that requires real artistry, but has been sadly replaced in contemporary film by a dumbed- down world of bathroom jokes, insult gags, and other cheap forms of humor that appeal mainly to juveniles.

By the time The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer was made, screwball comedy was winding down. Since screwball comedies were Grant's main area of expertise, he then had difficulty finding good scripts to do and was often forced to settle with somewhat inferior romantic comedies like this one (he still did make some other excellent films afterwards).But, as I said earlier, although this lacks the originality and sparkle of some of his earlier films, it is not bad. By today's standards it is excellent - and as an added bonus it contains no obscene language or inappropriate scenes. Like all Grant's films it is tasteful, innocent and good entertainment for the whole family.Essentially, this movie is a lighthearted romantic comedy that describes what happens when a debonair artist (Cary Grant) is stuck with a teenage girl chasing him (Shirley Temple). As an added bonus, the teenage girl's older sister (Myrna Loy) is also around. This movie has many funny situations, especially one where Grant is forced to participate in a childish series of races at a local fair.The acting is quite good, and, all in all, this is an amusing, cute movie.",4,Amusing...,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,1246,"['movie', 'not', 'one', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'best', 'comedies', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'quite', 'amusing', 'time', 'Bachelor', 'Bobby-Soxer', 'was', 'made', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'was', 'winding', 'down', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'were', 'Grant', 'main', 'area', 'expertise', 'then', 'had', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'good', 'scripts', 'do', 'was', 'often', 'forced', 'settle', 'somewhat', 'inferior', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'one', 'still', 'did', 'make', 'other', 'excellent', 'films', 'afterwards', '.But', 'said', 'earlier', 'originality', 'sparkle', 'earlier', 'films', 'not', 'bad', 'today', 'standards', 'excellent', 'added', 'bonus', 'obscene', 'language', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'Grant', 'films', 'tasteful', 'innocent', 'good', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family.Essentially', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'when', 'debonair', 'artist', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'stuck', 'teenage', 'girl', 'chasing', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'added', 'bonus', 'teenage', 'girl', 'older', 'sister', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'also', 'around', 'movie', 'many', 'funny', 'situations', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'Grant', 'forced', 'participate', 'childish', 'series', 'races', 'local', 'fair.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'amusing', 'cute', 'movie']",N/A
182610,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,1559600136,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","THE BACHELOR & THE BOBBY-SOXER (Dir. Irving Reis, 1947, 95 minutes) was a bit of fluff which has its ups and downs - mainly the strain to show a bit of teenage high school life as it was post-WWII. Playboy artist Dick (Cary Grant) runs afoul of a circuit court judge (Myrna Loy). What is worse is when the judge's younger sister Susan (a stunning Shirley Temple) falls for Dick.The plotline and basic story are really very stupid, and could have been handled far better, with far better lines and ... I can't stop myself if I go on describing how this film went wrong. It has hilarious moments which only highlight what might have been. Yet this film, if you know a bit about things, shows how awful life can be for all involved.When this was shooting, Cary Grant and the director apparently thought none too highly of each other, and Reis at one point walked off the picture. Grant was smarting from the death of a beloved friend, while another of his friends, Howard Hughes, was recuperating from a near-fatal plane crash.Myrna Loy was being hounded by the House for allegedly being a communist, and Shirley Temple's young marriage was on the rocks. Believe me, despite the excellent and professional work you'll see here, the awful strain shows too. I noted it right away because Grant has a brief few seconds when he is clearly giving the evil eye to someone on the crew (probably the director) - and that little slip-up remains in the film.To be frank, I cannot imagine how anyone got through this production.Rudee Vallee, apparently trouble-free here, gives one of his usual stilted and weird performances; the rest of the characters you might recognize but I won't say anything about them. One youngster I'll mention is Susan's former beau, Jerry played by gorgeous half-Cherokee Johnny Sands, and that is one gay looking beauty if ever I saw one.Sands had only a brief film career in the 1940s and 1950s - this is really his 1st and only major film role. I felt that of the two, he was far sexier and prettier than Temple but that's just me. The natural, sweet charm Johnny Sands displays shamelessly here was a real shot in the arm and I wonder what he was like in real life. He left Hollyweird in 1953 to become a real estate agent, was happily married and got fan mail til the end of his long life.It's sad to look at this from ""a Cary Grant movie"" perspective. Just before this, he'd madeNotorious; afterward he starred inThe Bishop's Wife (1947)and the underratedMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House(see my review). But it seems to me THE BACHELOR was a sort of downfall for Grant, who would go on for about ten years appearing in sub-par crapola. He would only come to break this spell in 1957 inAn Affair to Remember.On top of all that, as of 1957, Grant would only have about another decade worth of movies left in him before deciding to retire - which in my estimation was a huge error on his part. Just to round out my Grant soliloquy, it always makes me sad that I have been a patient right in the hospital room where Grant died. He happened to be visiting a town very near my home town when his final illness claimed his life.Even so, I think this film has lots of interest, is a quasi-classic, and should be viewed at least once. It shows the 1940s getting ready to morph into the 1950s and it isn't always pleasant: I think people should have a chance to see that. I have a love/hate relationship with the role of the black maidservant in the judge's household, played by the ever wonderful Lillian Randolph.While Randolph's brief appearance at the start of the film can never be robbed of its dignity and beauty, I just have a tremendous problem with the portrayal of black servants. My father was black, descended from Ethiopians, and he was certainly no servant. My own life is filled with childhood memories of segregation, which did not affect me personally, as I am lily-white, but my poor parents! That's enough for me to have attitude about this, no matter how true to life it was.",5,"Full stars for a rough, rough road",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,4011,"['BACHELOR', 'THE', 'BOBBY-SOXER', 'Dir', 'Irving', 'Reis', '1947', '95', 'minutes', 'was', 'bit', 'fluff', 'ups', 'downs', 'mainly', 'strain', 'show', 'bit', 'teenage', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'was', 'post-WWII', 'Playboy', 'artist', 'Dick', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'afoul', 'circuit', 'court', 'judge', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'What', 'worse', 'when', 'judge', 'younger', 'sister', 'Susan', 'stunning', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Dick.The', 'plotline', 'basic', 'story', 'are', 'really', 'very', 'stupid', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'far', 'better', 'far', 'better', 'lines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'go', 'describing', 'how', 'film', 'went', 'wrong', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'only', 'highlight', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'know', 'bit', 'things', 'how', 'awful', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'involved.When', 'was', 'shooting', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'director', 'apparently', 'thought', 'none', 'too', 'highly', 'other', 'Reis', 'one', 'point', 'walked', 'picture', 'Grant', 'was', 'smarting', 'death', 'beloved', 'friend', 'friends', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'was', 'recuperating', 'near-fatal', 'plane', 'crash.Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'being', 'hounded', 'House', 'allegedly', 'being', 'communist', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'young', 'marriage', 'was', 'rocks', 'Believe', 'excellent', 'professional', 'work', ""'ll"", 'see', 'here', 'awful', 'strain', 'shows', 'too', 'noted', 'right', 'away', 'Grant', 'brief', 'few', 'seconds', 'when', 'clearly', 'giving', 'evil', 'eye', 'someone', 'crew', 'probably', 'director', 'little', 'slip-up', 'remains', 'film.To', 'be', 'frank', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'anyone', 'got', 'production.Rudee', 'Vallee', 'apparently', 'trouble-free', 'here', 'one', 'usual', 'stilted', 'weird', 'performances', 'rest', 'characters', 'might', 'recognize', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'One', 'youngster', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'Susan', 'former', 'beau', 'Jerry', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'half-Cherokee', 'Johnny', 'Sands', 'one', 'gay', 'looking', 'beauty', 'ever', 'saw', 'one.Sands', 'had', 'only', 'brief', 'film', 'career', '1940s', '1950s', 'really', '1st', 'only', 'major', 'film', 'role', 'felt', 'two', 'was', 'far', 'sexier', 'prettier', 'Temple', 'just', 'natural', 'sweet', 'charm', 'Johnny', 'Sands', 'shamelessly', 'here', 'was', 'real', 'shot', 'arm', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'left', 'Hollyweird', '1953', 'become', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'was', 'happily', 'married', 'got', 'fan', 'mail', 'end', 'long', 'life.It', 'sad', 'look', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'movie', 'perspective', 'Just', ""'d"", 'madeNotorious', 'starred', 'inThe', 'Bishop', 'Wife', '1947', 'underratedMr', 'Blandings', 'Dream', 'House', 'see', 'review', 'THE', 'BACHELOR', 'was', 'sort', 'downfall', 'Grant', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'ten', 'years', 'appearing', 'sub-par', 'crapola', 'would', 'only', 'come', 'break', 'spell', '1957', 'inAn', 'Affair', 'Remember.On', 'top', '1957', 'Grant', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'decade', 'worth', 'movies', 'left', 'deciding', 'retire', 'estimation', 'was', 'huge', 'error', 'part', 'Just', 'round', 'out', 'Grant', 'soliloquy', 'always', 'sad', 'have', 'been', 'patient', 'right', 'hospital', 'room', 'where', 'Grant', 'died', 'happened', 'be', 'visiting', 'town', 'very', 'home', 'town', 'when', 'final', 'illness', 'claimed', 'life.Even', 'so', 'think', 'film', 'lots', 'interest', 'quasi-classic', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'least', 'once', '1940s', 'getting', 'ready', 'morph', '1950s', ""n't"", 'always', 'pleasant', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'role', 'black', 'maidservant', 'judge', 'household', 'played', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'Lillian', 'Randolph.While', 'Randolph', 'brief', 'appearance', 'start', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'robbed', 'dignity', 'beauty', 'just', 'have', 'tremendous', 'problem', 'portrayal', 'black', 'servants', 'father', 'was', 'black', 'descended', 'Ethiopians', 'was', 'certainly', 'servant', 'own', 'life', 'filled', 'childhood', 'memories', 'segregation', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'personally', 'am', 'lily-white', 'poor', 'parents', 'enough', 'have', 'attitude', 'matter', 'how', 'true', 'life', 'was']",N/A

In fact, I was surprised that it had garnered an Academy Award for best screenplay, as I found the premise of the film belabored, and though it features an excellent cast, the film flounders in its quest for laughs.The premise of the film is ludicrous. When a very handsome, debonair artist and bachelor about town (Cary Grant) lectures at a local high school, one of its students, a cute seventeen year old bobbysoxer (Shirley Temple) develops an enormous crush on him, seeing him as her knight in shining armor.When our hapless artist finds himself in an absurd and compromising situation with our enterprising bobbysoxer, he is ordered by a judge to date her till she gets over him. Finding himself over a barrel, he dates her as ordered. She also happens to be the sister of another judge (Myrna Loy), with whom he has had legal contact previously. It also just so happens that Ms. Loy's beau is an Assistant District Attorney (Rudy Vallee), who is also involved in the dating scheme. Of course, anyone with half a brain can figure out who ends up with whom in this film.Cary Grant is the standout in this film, as he is gives a credible, polished, and funny performance. Shirley Temple, of whom I am a big fan, simply grates in this film, as it seems as if the director wanted to reprise her youthful cuteness. Well, what is cute as a five years old doesn't usually work when one is a teenager. I expected her to break out into a rendition of the ""Good Ship Lollipop"" at any time.As for Myrna Loy, who is an excellent actress, her performance falls flatter than a pancake, as it is hard to imagine Cary Grant falling for such a stern, cold fish. She exudes no charm and there is simply no chemistry between her and Cary Grant, making their romance simply not believable. Rudy Vallee, however, holds his own in his small role, as does the rest of the supporting cast.Rent this film, rather than buy it.

Pow! she sees him as a knight in shining armor and is off to corral him. She doesn't know of course that big sis judge Myrna Loy has just had him in her courtroom and has formed a low opinion of his reputed womanizing. Shirley even finds a way to gain access to the unknowing Cary's apartment, where he then unjustly gets slammed with a jailbait charge. Hey, where's this going? Well, Myrna and her assistant DA beau Rudy Vallee decide that the only way for Shirley to get over Cary is for him to date her and probably bore her with his adult ways. And of course, nothing works out like anyone has planned, least of all smug Myrna. As I wrote above, the movie really picks up after about 15-20 minutes and then becomes quite hilarious, with Rudy Vallee particularly good as an eccentric WASP, the sort of thing he does so well .

This is another comedy teamed up with Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The movie tries to tackle an interesting situation; what would happen if a young teenage girl develops a schoolgirl crush over a much older man like Cary Grant, especially when her big sister (Myrna Loy) is the judge at county court. It is a tough call when you learn that the judge herself develops a soft corner for the bachelor.Cary Grant plays a charming artist named Dick Nugent who finds himself into troubles when he least expect it, because women can't resist him, and their men get jealous and go after him. He goes to court for such a reason, and judge Margaret Turner (Myrna Loy) lecture him about his behavior, and he delivers a lecture on his dedication to art at the local high school. This catches the attention of young Susan Turner (Shirley Temple). The little girl gets a little adventurous and manages to break into Nugent's apartment and falls asleep. Dick returns from work and gets ready for bed without noticing the young intruder on bed. When she wakes up and say hello to him, and at the same time he finds that local police, accompanied by the D.A., named Tommy (Rudy Vallee) and Judge Turner herself are knocking on his door. This is not the kind of problem Nugent was looking for: He finds himself arrested and charged. Judge Turner is convinced by her uncle Matt (Ray Collins) to go easy on him; if she isn't, then young Susan will think of Nugent as a martyr. So he gets a suspended sentence on the condition he cooperates with authorities and help young Susan to forget him. He seeks (bribes) the help of Susan's ex-boyfriend Jerry (Johnny Sands) to steal the bobby-soxer from him.Cary Grant was fortunate enough to play with some of the most beautiful and talented women of Hollywood. Myrna Loy is not exactly at the top of this list; the element of comedy triumphs at the expense of the element of romance. I would have liked more Grant and Loy romantic situations; nonetheless this is still a very delightful comedy. My favorite moments are when Susan attempts to pass herself off as both Dick's mother and Margaret's sister to help Dick escape from jail. The disruption of the dining scene at the club when Dick and Margaret try to spend a romantic evening is also a funny moment.This is beautifully written for the screen by Hollywood veteran, Sidney Sheldon who also wrote such classics as; Dream Wife, Easter Parade, and I Dream of Jeannie (TV episodes).1.Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House2.The Cary Grant Signature Collection (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House / Destination Tokyo / The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer / My Favorite Wife / Night and Day)3.The Major and the Minor (Universal Cinema Classics)",4,Shirley Temple is adorable as bobby soxer,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,2822,"['Screwball', 'slapsticks', 'done', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'comedy', 'teamed', 'up', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'tackle', 'interesting', 'situation', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'schoolgirl', 'crush', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'especially', 'when', 'big', 'sister', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'judge', 'county', 'court', 'tough', 'call', 'when', 'learn', 'judge', 'soft', 'corner', 'bachelor.Cary', 'Grant', 'charming', 'artist', 'named', 'Dick', 'Nugent', 'who', 'troubles', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'men', 'get', 'jealous', 'go', 'court', 'reason', 'judge', 'Margaret', 'Turner', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'lecture', 'behavior', 'lecture', 'dedication', 'art', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'attention', 'young', 'Susan', 'Turner', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'little', 'girl', 'little', 'adventurous', 'break', 'Nugent', 'apartment', 'asleep', 'Dick', 'returns', 'work', 'ready', 'bed', 'noticing', 'young', 'intruder', 'bed', 'When', 'say', 'hello', 'same', 'time', 'local', 'police', 'accompanied', 'D.A.', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'Judge', 'Turner', 'are', 'knocking', 'door', 'not', 'kind', 'problem', 'Nugent', 'was', 'looking', 'arrested', 'charged', 'Judge', 'Turner', 'convinced', 'uncle', 'Matt', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'go', 'easy', ""n't"", 'then', 'young', 'Susan', 'will', 'think', 'Nugent', 'martyr', 'suspended', 'sentence', 'condition', 'authorities', 'help', 'young', 'Susan', 'forget', 'bribes', 'help', 'Susan', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jerry', 'Johnny', 'Sands', 'steal', 'bobby-soxer', 'him.Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'play', 'most', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'women', 'Hollywood', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'not', 'exactly', 'top', 'list', 'element', 'comedy', 'triumphs', 'expense', 'element', 'romance', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'Grant', 'Loy', 'romantic', 'situations', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'very', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'favorite', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Susan', 'pass', 'off', 'Dick', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'sister', 'help', 'Dick', 'escape', 'jail', 'disruption', 'dining', 'scene', 'club', 'when', 'Dick', 'Margaret', 'try', 'spend', 'romantic', 'evening', 'also', 'funny', 'moment.This', 'beautifully', 'written', 'screen', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'such', 'classics', 'Dream', 'Wife', 'Easter', 'Parade', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'TV', 'episodes', '.1.Mr', 'Blandings', 'Dream', 'House2.The', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', '/', 'Destination', 'Tokyo', '/', 'Bachelor', 'Bobby-Soxer', '/', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', '/', 'Night', 'Day', '3.The', 'Major', 'Minor', 'Universal', 'Cinema', 'Classics']",N/A
182640,A2YT63K4RSOCFC,1559600136,Robert E. Henry,"[5, 7]","An excellent screwball comedy by Cary Grant and his favorite costar, Myrna Loy, with an allstar support cast. I find several reasons for the appeal of this thoroughly enjoyable film. One is the lovely escapism of the setting: sunny, charming, bucolic, post-World War II suburban California, populated with attractive folks you'd like to meet succeeding at life (even when they goof up). This is American Society happy with itself, working harmoniously and supportively, before everyone went their own ways in the mid-60s -- this is family, without a trace of alienation, and deep down inside we'd all like to live that way.On the personal level, the main attraction is our desire to see Cary get caught up in a real jam -- one that causes him to redefine his immature character -- and give us some real laughs as he fights his way to a resolution of his win-or-lose-it-all conflict. No actor has ever surpassed Cary's persona of the elegantly befuddled smoothie.On a technical level, we enjoy the movie because the script is engaging and perfectly suited to each character. We aren't treated to brisk, warm, articulate scriptwriting like this anymore.But perhaps the real glue that holds this film together for the viewer is the integrity of the plot, for while lighthearted, it is not trivial in principle. Ever present within this little gem is the story of the quintessential playboy having his superficial lifestyle -- which he is VERY content to continue -- catch up with him. We are fascinated at the spectacle of a member of ""The In Crowd"" having to buckle down and contribute to life (that means work) like the rest of us, instead of simply coasting by on their superior, God-given talents. Cary plays a talented artist cruising through life in this fashion, noncommittally ""doing his thing"" and inadventantly causing trouble for the average folks he enocunters, by his disregard for convention ... until Life taps him on the shoulder and insists that he join society and grow up. Coupling this plot premise with our instinctive desire to see the heroic Cary wrestle his way out of a preposterous circumstance that he's created for himself keeps the viewer entertained throughout the story.The cast is magnificent, and the pace is elegantly screwball, never missing a beat, yet not too fast for the humor to feel real. It's great entertainment, and it stands up to multiple viewings better than almost any comedy I can pull off the shelf. Now ... when will it find its way onto DVD?

Susan is young, naive and passionate and Margaret is a judge who lives by the facts, and those facts make it the law.""You know I'd die for you, only sometimes it's so hard living with you. ""When Susan falls for Dick(Cary Grant)an older man who comes to speak at her school about art, she's determined to pose for him, and make him her knight in shining armor.Of course the plot thickens when Jerry(Johnny Sands) whose heart beats only for Susan, gets jealous, and it seems like Margaret may have a thing for Dick, herself.It's an adorable tale of growing up, learning to give other second chances, and I suppose your knight in shining armor isn't always who you'd have guessed.As far as special features go, there's not much; as these classics tend to go, we're just happy they're released at all!",4,"""That's great.
