303745,A30AO422P01XK0,6302247004,Daniel Mackler,"[6, 7]","Aside from one unnecessary sex scene and a doom-and-gloom ending, this movie was about as near to perfect as any I've ever seen.  It captures the horror and hopelessness and spiritual death of so many in our modern world, and it offers an unusually huge and beautiful and inspiring glimpse into the potential for something new and great.Rantes, the main character, is a modern and believable Jesus figure - a born leader with passion and wisdom and a rare soul.  Although this movie presents him as an alien who has superhuman power and lacks feelings, he really represents the human ideal - and the inner teacher and inner capacity for perfection we all have.His intelligent and all-but-hopeless psychiatrist represents the broken norm - desperately struggling to find truth but unable to accept or acknowledge it when it comes knocking on the door.The therapy in the movie represents the emotional reality of the modern mental health system - spiritually corrupt, anti-healing, drugged to the hilt, and boundariless when it suits the therapist (who has sex with his patient's best friend - though the movie fails to acknowledge the betrayal in this and instead presents it in a somewhat positive light!).The caring patient, on the flip side, becomes the template for a good therapist, and his scenes of healing - especially the scene in which he leads the outdoor orchestra - are no less than magnificent.I recommend this movie, in spite of its few flaws, with all my heart.  It offers more scenes that got me to cry harder and deeper than any movie I've seen in a long time.  Give yourself the gift and watch it.  If only we could all become like Rantes.  Perhaps we can.  And perhaps this movie's negative ending need not be reality...",5,One Of The Most Beautiful Films I've Ever Seen,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1739,"['Aside', 'one', 'unnecessary', 'sex', 'scene', 'doom-and-gloom', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'perfect', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'hopelessness', 'spiritual', 'death', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'world', 'unusually', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'glimpse', 'potential', 'something', 'new', 'great.Rantes', 'main', 'character', 'modern', 'believable', 'Jesus', 'figure', 'born', 'leader', 'passion', 'wisdom', 'rare', 'soul', 'movie', 'alien', 'who', 'superhuman', 'power', 'lacks', 'feelings', 'really', 'human', 'ideal', 'inner', 'teacher', 'inner', 'capacity', 'perfection', 'have.His', 'intelligent', 'all-but-hopeless', 'psychiatrist', 'broken', 'norm', 'desperately', 'struggling', 'find', 'truth', 'unable', 'accept', 'acknowledge', 'when', 'knocking', 'door.The', 'therapy', 'movie', 'emotional', 'reality', 'modern', 'mental', 'health', 'system', 'spiritually', 'corrupt', 'anti-healing', 'drugged', 'hilt', 'boundariless', 'when', 'suits', 'therapist', 'who', 'sex', 'patient', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'acknowledge', 'betrayal', 'instead', 'presents', 'somewhat', 'positive', 'light', '.The', 'caring', 'patient', 'flip', 'side', 'template', 'good', 'therapist', 'scenes', 'healing', 'especially', 'scene', 'outdoor', 'orchestra', 'are', 'less', 'magnificent.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'spite', 'few', 'flaws', 'heart', 'more', 'scenes', 'got', 'cry', 'harder', 'deeper', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Give', 'gift', 'watch', 'only', 'could', 'become', 'Rantes', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'negative', 'ending', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'reality']",N/A

I remember this film as powerful, simple but moving in its theme:  the ""extraterrestial"" being observes people on earth and cannot figure out why they make themselves unhappy and why they cannot respond to each other's unhappiness.  The psychiatrist assigned to work with this being, who sees more deeply into humans than the psychiatrist himself, has a chance for happiness but rejects it because he can't believe in the simplicity of the solution.  He acquiesces in destroying the one person who has tried sincerely to help him.  A very strange and ironic film that tries to bring human beings to their senses but suggests that they are beyond help and must destroy any potential saviors.

I saw it about 10 years ago and come here periodically to check to see if it's available on DVD...it looks like maybe it will be available soon!!This is an incredible movie.  It forces the viewer to examine all parts of his/her life and begs the questions, who is crazy and who isn't.In the movie's storyline, the question of course is, who is crazy--the mental patient or the psychiatrist?  Both men seem to be equally intelligent and believeable. But the doctor has the upper hand in this situation, unfortunately.From the opening sequence with the heavy footsteps of the nurse and her shocking news to the famous ""blue liquid"", this movie is both magical in its innocence and brilliant in its examination of human nature.The movie also serves as a commentary on mental illness and how even in this day and age, we as the ""sane public"", feel uncomfortable enough with mental illness to wish it to be suppressed, quieted and hidden.  What's sad and surprising about this movie, however, is that the psychiatrist also follows popular opinion and denys the existance of the possibility of what may actually be right in front of him.  Instead of being a man of science, instead of being curious, the doctor takes the easy way out.  But I guess one can't fault the doctor for being terrified of the unknown, but since the patient seems to offer no reason to fear him, the doctor could have taken another path.This movie and the topic shown reminds me of a college professor who talked so much about ""absolute knowledge"".  Hitler possessed absolute knowledge about Jewish people and we all know the results of that ""knowledge"".  The psychiatrist also possesses absolute knowledge...he knows Rantes(if I remember the character's name correctly after 10 years) certainly can't be an alien, therefore he must be insane.  But there is evidence in the movie to the contrary and the doctor is blind to that evidence.  Therefore, the doctor operates on his absolute knowledge that eventually results in death...just like Hitler.  Sooner or later, people realize that absolute knowledge exists mainly and only in mathematics...certainly not in human nature.Hopefully the viewer learns a thing or two from this movie and always views life with an open mind.
