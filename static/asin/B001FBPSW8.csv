1191569,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001FBPSW8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[71, 75]","Maureen Jennings is a fine writer of mysteries. She develops complex plots, creates interesting characters and shows us a world -- Toronto in the 1880's -- that can be pleasant for the well-to-do with their over-stuffed morality and desperately dangerous for the poverty stricken. Those dangers not only come from hunger, cold, sickness and filth, but often from the doings of those who go to church often, dine well and move in upper-class society or middle-class respectability. In the middle of this humanity is Detective William Murdoch. He's on the Toronto police force. Murdoch is a good Irish Catholic, which means he doesn't fit in comfortably most places. He's a hard-worker, ambitious but not pushy, convinced that scientific methods are better at catching criminals than simply pounding confessions out of suspects. He tends to be sympathetic to those with whom the better off want nothing to do. He's rather shy, especially with women, and has had the tragic experience of the death of a woman he was engaged to and loved dearly. Jennings' mysteries, in other words, are first-rate.That brings us to The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection, three 90-minute television programs based on Jennings' first three books. Except the Dying is the story of a young woman's corpse found tossed on a cobblestone street in the middle of Toronto's red light district. Murdoch discovers she was not a prostitute, but a chambermaid from a respectable household. Poor Tom Is Cold begins with the apparent suicide of a young Toronto policeman Murdoch knew. Murdoch doesn't accept this and finds himself confronted with venality, madness and the stark cruelty of a hospital for the mentally ill. Under the Dragon's Tail starts with the death of a grubby abortionist and soon leads to blackmail, respectable wives and the murder of a young boy.At best, if you've read Jennings' books, these three programs are variable. At their worst, they seriously mess about with Murdoch. The programs feature fine production values. There is a good sense of the 1880's, all cobblestone streets, gaslights, filthy runnels, dignified homes, and characters that range from smudged tykes and raucous prostitutes to mutton-whiskered inspectors and choleric judges. Peter Outerbridge, who plays Murdoch, to my taste looks too well-bred, but he's a good actor and conveys Murdoch's shyness and persistence very well. The three programs stick closely to the plots in the books, which means the stories keep us guessing and keep us interested. On the downside, the production team brings in romantic interest for Murdoch, first with Toronto's first female coroner, Dr. Julia Ogden (way off the mark with the character from the books), and then, bizarrely and over-lapping, with a lower-class, tattered prostitute we first encounter working the streets. By the end of the third program, Dr. Ogden has disappeared and Detective Murdoch and his cleaned up, respectable doxie, now with much less of a lower-class accent, seem to have found love and appear to be accepted as a couple by Murdoch's boss and fellow cops. Well, this is fiction. Except the Dying was interesting. Poor Tom Is Cold was very good. Under the Dragon's Tail had a first class story but wound up putting Murdoch in a personal television melodrama so unlike the character as to be silly. These special movies were cancelled after this last, third program. Murdoch was resurrected four years later, minus the doxie and with Ogden back, with a new cast. It's now a regular television series.My recommendation if you haven't read Jennings' Murdoch mysteries before...rent this set before you buy and read one or two of the books before you watch. As I mentioned, the plots are well done. If you like the Murdoch books, see if you can find the three mysteries Mark Graham wrote featuring Detective Wilton McCleary. They're set in 1870's Philadelphia. Graham (which may be a pseudonym) only wrote these three, which were released in standard paperback editions. As far as I can tell, he never wrote anything else. If anyone knows what happened to him, post a comment. I'd like to know. The three books areThe Killing Breed,The Resurrectionist (Old Philadelphia Mystery Series)andThe Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia).",4,"Toronto in the 1880's, with murder, gaslights and Detective William Murdoch.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Before he was the protagonist of a TV series, Detective William Murdoch had a DIFFERENT kind of mystery series -- three TV movies starring Peter Outerbridge.And ""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection""  is very different from the gleaming, quirky steampunk of the TV series. Instead, the three TV movies are less glamorous and more realistic in tone -- they're more about the dirt, seediness and shadows of Victorian Toronto, where prostitution, drugs, insane asylums and brutal murders can only be served by a quiet man on a bike.""Except the Dying"" puts Murdoch (Outerbridge) on the case of a girl found naked and strangled near the homes of several prostitutes. An autopsy by coroner Dr. Julia Ogden (Keely Hawes) reveals that the girl was not only drugged with opium, but was pregnant. And Murdoch soon discovers that the girl was connected to a rich, powerful family with some nasty secrets of their own.In ""Poor Tom is Cold,"" Murdoch is shocked by the apparent suicide of a bright young policeman. But when his fingerprint evidence is dismissed in court, he has to find new evidence to support the murder theory -- including a prostitute hired to act, a family with a madwoman who may not be mad, and a fiancee who was engaged to two men at once. Who had the means, motive and opportunity?Finally, ""Under the Dragon's Tail"" has Murdoch discovering that an alcoholic woman's death may have been due to something else -- she was an illegal abortionist. Despite his revulsion, Murdoch begins investigating the many motives, including her religious neighbors and the one-off boyfriend of a pregnant girl. But his case goes into nasty territory when he learns of a connection to a wealthy, prominent judge and his family... and a missing book that holds all the dead woman's secrets.""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a much darker kind of mystery than the spinoff series -- everything seems grimy and shadowy, lit by unflattering gas lamps. There's a greater emphasis on the struggles of women (prostitution, the brutally nightmarish asylum) and the lower classes than you usually see in late 1800s/early 1900s stories, as well as the early stages of modern police work.However, the grimness of Murdoch's working life is gently leavened with a tinge of romance, and some gently humorous scenes (Murdoch's attempts to learn how to waltz, which his tired teacher compares to a ""water buffalo""). The biggest problem is that the denouements of the first two mysteries are... a little confusing. The motives of the murders aren't fully explained.And Peter Outerbridge does a simply superb job as Murdoch -- he captures the sadness and compassion of a man who genuinely believes in justice, guided by his strong Roman Catholic faith. Even when he condemns a murder victim (like the abortionist) he still tries to give them the justice they deserve, respecting every one even after death (""Someone must speak for the dead"").And there's a solid supporting cast, especially the two women who come to love Murdoch: Keely Hawes as a cool, clever doctor with a knack for autopsies, and Flora Montgomery as a fiery prostitute/fortune-teller. The always-awesome Colm Meaney makes a good Inspector Brackenreid, who often puts political pressure on Murdoch's investigations; and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Joy (who later plays Ogden in the TV series) has a single brilliant role here.""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a darker, grimmer kind of Detective Murdoch story than you may be used to, but the brilliant performances and subtle crimes are stellar.",4,Murder in gaslight,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,3552,"['was', 'protagonist', 'TV', 'series', 'Detective', 'William', 'Murdoch', 'had', 'DIFFERENT', 'kind', 'mystery', 'series', 'three', 'TV', 'movies', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Outerbridge.And', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'very', 'different', 'gleaming', 'quirky', 'steampunk', 'TV', 'series', 'Instead', 'three', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'less', 'glamorous', 'more', 'realistic', 'tone', ""'re"", 'more', 'dirt', 'seediness', 'shadows', 'Victorian', 'Toronto', 'where', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'insane', 'asylums', 'brutal', 'murders', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'served', 'quiet', 'man', 'bike', 'Dying', 'Murdoch', 'Outerbridge', 'case', 'girl', 'found', 'naked', 'strangled', 'homes', 'several', 'prostitutes', 'autopsy', 'coroner', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Ogden', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'girl', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'drugged', 'opium', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Murdoch', 'soon', 'girl', 'was', 'connected', 'rich', 'powerful', 'family', 'nasty', 'secrets', 'own.In', 'Poor', 'Tom', 'Cold', 'Murdoch', 'shocked', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'bright', 'young', 'policeman', 'when', 'fingerprint', 'evidence', 'dismissed', 'court', 'find', 'new', 'evidence', 'support', 'murder', 'theory', 'including', 'prostitute', 'hired', 'act', 'family', 'madwoman', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'mad', 'fiancee', 'who', 'was', 'engaged', 'two', 'men', 'once', 'Who', 'had', 'means', 'motive', 'opportunity', 'Finally', 'Dragon', 'Tail', 'Murdoch', 'discovering', 'alcoholic', 'woman', 'death', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'illegal', 'abortionist', 'revulsion', 'Murdoch', 'investigating', 'many', 'motives', 'including', 'religious', 'neighbors', 'one-off', 'boyfriend', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'case', 'nasty', 'territory', 'when', 'connection', 'wealthy', 'prominent', 'judge', 'family', 'missing', 'book', 'dead', 'woman', 'secrets', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'much', 'darker', 'kind', 'mystery', 'spinoff', 'series', 'everything', 'grimy', 'shadowy', 'lit', 'unflattering', 'gas', 'lamps', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'struggles', 'women', 'prostitution', 'brutally', 'nightmarish', 'asylum', 'lower', 'classes', 'usually', 'see', 'late', '1800s/early', '1900s', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'stages', 'modern', 'police', 'work.However', 'grimness', 'Murdoch', 'working', 'life', 'gently', 'leavened', 'tinge', 'romance', 'gently', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'Murdoch', 'attempts', 'learn', 'how', 'waltz', 'tired', 'teacher', 'water', 'buffalo', 'biggest', 'problem', 'denouements', 'first', 'two', 'mysteries', 'are', 'little', 'confusing', 'motives', 'murders', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explained.And', 'Peter', 'Outerbridge', 'simply', 'superb', 'job', 'Murdoch', 'sadness', 'compassion', 'man', 'who', 'genuinely', 'justice', 'guided', 'strong', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'Even', 'when', 'murder', 'victim', 'abortionist', 'still', 'give', 'justice', 'deserve', 'respecting', 'one', 'even', 'death', 'Someone', 'must', 'speak', 'dead', '.And', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'come', 'love', 'Murdoch', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'cool', 'clever', 'doctor', 'knack', 'autopsies', 'Flora', 'Montgomery', 'fiery', 'prostitute/fortune-teller', 'always-awesome', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'good', 'Inspector', 'Brackenreid', 'who', 'often', 'political', 'pressure', 'Murdoch', 'investigations', 'H', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'Joy', 'who', 'later', 'Ogden', 'TV', 'series', 'single', 'brilliant', 'role', 'here', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'darker', 'grimmer', 'kind', 'Detective', 'Murdoch', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'subtle', 'crimes', 'are', 'stellar']",The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection

That's as religious as this Victorian low-life crime show gets.It's off to nude bodies, rape, abortionist, prostitutes, pub dancers, drugs, murdered cop, romantic vengeance, blood, and other sordid filth.Details of the Victorian police investigations of Murdoch (Peter Outerbridge), like handcuffs restraining like screw C-clamps, are fascinating. Stories are riveting. The 'NEW' techniques Murdoch employs ,such as forensic facts, finger marks, crime scene Kodak Moments, fiber & writing analysis, and autopsy findings (to name a few) help him solve the unsolvable. Murdoch is mentor to George Crabtree (Matthew MacFadzean), teaching him the cutting-edge evidence techniques. Yes, there's a beautiful woman: Ettie (Flora Montgomery).The 3 feature-length stories inspired a TV series (Murdoch Mysteries), 2 seasons now also available on DVD. The TV series is recast but astonishingly the characters appear similar as cast mimic the mini-series (MM Movie Collection) cast in speech and actions. Both old and new casts are excellent. Murdoch flirts with subtle Victorian-correct romance in the MM TV series which adds 26 new episodes to enjoy.Murdoch is like a cop of the 21st century but allows us a beautiful look at the Victorian Era even if it is a bit on the seedy side of the track at times. The proper and sophisticated Murdoch makes viewers want to return to life in 1890 (with modern conveniences, of course.)Unrated, but this is obvious 'ADULT' crime mystery drama. NO SUBTITLES nor CC.
