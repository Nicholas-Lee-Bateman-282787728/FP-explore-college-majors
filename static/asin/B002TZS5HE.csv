I imagine about 95% of the other viewers from Spokane would say the same thing.  There really isn't much else to say about this movie.  Sarah Roemer is certainly charming and appealing, but these characters are so poorly developed that it really is hard to care about what happens to them (as if we didn't already know that everything turns out JUST FINE).  Lightweight, not awful, good enough.  Spokanites will have fun laughing at the attempt to pass Downtown Spokane as New York City.  Imagine that!",3,"Lightweight, moderately entertaining --- 3 stars is just right",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,674,"['anyone', 'else', 'Spokane', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'get', 'look', 'Paulsen', 'Building', 'penthouse', 'where', 'good', 'deal', 'action', 'place', 'imagine', '95', '%', 'other', 'viewers', 'Spokane', 'would', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'say', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'certainly', 'charming', 'appealing', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'really', 'hard', 'care', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'everything', 'out', 'JUST', 'FINE', 'Lightweight', 'not', 'awful', 'good', 'enough', 'Spokanites', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'laughing', 'attempt', 'pass', 'Downtown', 'Spokane', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Imagine']",N/A

It is hard to do romantic comedy well- and most film makers do not try to do more than provide an adequate workmanlike product following the familiar formulas that have worked before.  Some folks would say that this film also followed the formula and to some extent that is true but there were some significant departures that added real poignance to the story.  It helps that the female lead was the luminous Sarah Roemer, who also also shined in the fabulous, and literally riotous, Brazilian comedy ""Romeo and Juliet get Married"" (A romantic comedy that is also the all time greatest satire on soccer fans ever made- and yes I have seen the original English version of 'Fever Pitch').  Sarah has made my personal list of favorite actresses.  In this film she continued to display the same sure touch and sense of timing.  However, the rest of the cast also did very well.",5,Charming Romance,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,896,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'hard', 'do', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'well-', 'most', 'film', 'makers', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'do', 'more', 'provide', 'adequate', 'workmanlike', 'product', 'following', 'familiar', 'formulas', 'have', 'worked', 'folks', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'also', 'followed', 'formula', 'extent', 'true', 'were', 'significant', 'departures', 'added', 'real', 'poignance', 'story', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'luminous', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'who', 'also', 'also', 'shined', 'fabulous', 'literally', 'riotous', 'Brazilian', 'comedy', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'get', 'Married', 'A', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'also', 'time', 'greatest', 'satire', 'soccer', 'fans', 'ever', 'made-', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'English', 'version', ""'Fever"", 'Pitch', 'Sarah', 'made', 'personal', 'list', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'film', 'continued', 'display', 'same', 'sure', 'touch', 'sense', 'timing', 'However', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'did', 'very', 'well']",N/A

It's distracting to see Harry in bright red lipstick, but what's almost as annoying is to see his lipstick change color and even disappear with different shots of the same scene.

So wanted to see the whole thing, The relationship of the main characters and the supporting actors intrigued me with the contrast in the 'rich girl - poor man' plot. In some ways it is a bit schmaltzy and you can almost guess what is going to happen, but it takes a while to resolve. In addition to the romance aspect, it is also a story about how folks judge others by their looks and their station in life.",5,njce twist on a romance,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,492,"['bought', 'DVD', 'saw', 'part', 'movie', 'TV', 'missed', 'first', 'half', 'So', 'wanted', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'relationship', 'main', 'characters', 'supporting', 'actors', 'intrigued', 'contrast', ""'rich"", 'girl', 'poor', 'man', 'plot', 'ways', 'bit', 'schmaltzy', 'can', 'almost', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'while', 'resolve', 'addition', 'romance', 'aspect', 'also', 'story', 'how', 'folks', 'judge', 'others', 'looks', 'station', 'life']",N/A

I still like her but I suppose everyone has to have a stinker early in their career.The story follows a young NY man/nursing student who loses his dad to a handball game (literally) so the family has to get odd jobs to keep the family home. His job ends up being a door man working for a strict boss (played well by Pantoliano), a mellow coworker played by Snoop, and the token beautiful trust-fund daughter/resident of the building played by Roemer. Through several painful script setups our two characters court and find love. The strength of this would be the NYC footage, both day and night. Pantoliano is always fun to watch, and Snoop was very believable - he showed off his character better than anyone else in the film. The writing felt forced, and the scenes kept getting more contrived as the film played on - it was actually a relief for them to end it.The 2.0 sound is poorly done and the picture is average quality. The supplement is a music video/picture montage of them making the film, lasts a couple minutes - completely forgettable. Cannot classify this as a romantic comedy as there is maybe one laugh, but I suppose if you are looking for a light, escapist NYC romantic film - you will not be too disappointed. Three stars for Pants, Snoop and NYC, zero for the rest. Recommend seeing Roemer inFired Up (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray], she was a lot more fun in that one. Enjoy.",3,"Corny, contrived, Snoop does well though",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1542,"['had', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'Sarah', 'Roemer', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'nice', 'screen', 'presence', 'made', 'sure', 'get', 'couple', 'store', 'still', 'suppose', 'everyone', 'have', 'stinker', 'early', 'career.The', 'story', 'young', 'NY', 'man/nursing', 'student', 'who', 'dad', 'handball', 'game', 'literally', 'family', 'get', 'odd', 'jobs', 'keep', 'family', 'home', 'job', 'up', 'being', 'door', 'man', 'working', 'strict', 'boss', 'played', 'well', 'Pantoliano', 'mellow', 'coworker', 'played', 'Snoop', 'token', 'beautiful', 'trust-fund', 'daughter/resident', 'building', 'played', 'Roemer', 'several', 'painful', 'script', 'setups', 'two', 'characters', 'court', 'find', 'love', 'strength', 'would', 'be', 'NYC', 'footage', 'day', 'night', 'Pantoliano', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Snoop', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'showed', 'off', 'character', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'writing', 'felt', 'forced', 'scenes', 'kept', 'getting', 'more', 'contrived', 'film', 'played', 'was', 'actually', 'relief', 'end', 'it.The', '2.0', 'sound', 'poorly', 'done', 'picture', 'average', 'quality', 'supplement', 'music', 'video/picture', 'montage', 'making', 'film', 'couple', 'minutes', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Can', 'not', 'classify', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'maybe', 'one', 'laugh', 'suppose', 'are', 'looking', 'light', 'escapist', 'NYC', 'romantic', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'Three', 'stars', 'Pants', 'Snoop', 'NYC', 'zero', 'rest', 'Recommend', 'seeing', 'Roemer', 'inFired', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'one', 'Enjoy']",N/A
