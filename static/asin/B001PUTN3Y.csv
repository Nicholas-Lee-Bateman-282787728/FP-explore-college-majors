Catherine's daughter isn't blonde, but aside from that she, TOO, is EXACTLY how I imagined the character to be. Nelly is older than in the book, but her character is still the same. There is no Mr. Lockwood but the script of this version seems to be written in such a way that you never really miss him. Also Hareton is exellent. He's my favorite character and the way he was shown in this version is just the best!Nothing further to say, except that if anyone thinks this is going to be the same 'edition' of the movie they watched on youtube, it's not. Same version, but this DVD appears to be taped off of PBS except with slightly better quailty than a VHS. We even get the masterpiece intro scenes at the beginning.

1229988,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B001PUTN3Y,Andrew Raker,"[16, 20]","I believe this 2009 adaptation captured the essence of Emily Bront's novel better than the 1992 adaptation. However, the 1998 is still my favorite. However, I am NOT saying this adaptation was very different from the 1998. (In many respects, the films are nearly identical. Most of the same scenes are shown in each adaptation.)None of the adaptations could be considered true miniseries where the novel is acted out in entirety. (I an certain many people would find that boring.) Therefore, I am not writing this review as a critique of how well this film or any other film can substitute for reading the novel. What I am saying is that I think the 1998 Masterpiece adaptation is better in telling in the story.My Main Reasons:1.While this adaptation is slightly longer, I don't really think it developed minor characters any better than the 1998. (It does possibly develop Joseph's character slightly more but not Nelly's.)2.Some scenes in the 1998, for example, Heathcliff hanging a dog by the hook or trashing Thrushcross Grange after Linton's death showed Heathcliff's hate, grieve, etc. better than the alternative gambling scenes in this 2009 film.3.The conclusion of this film is a letdown. The 1998, and even the 1992, end better than this film. In this adaptation, I feel I am being led to think, ""Now Heathcliff is dead and can be with Catherine"" rather than focusing in Catherine II's future and happiness.FINAL THOUGHTS:I am not saying I do not recommend this film. Certainly, for someone who loves Emily Bront's ""Wuthering Heights"" and enjoys watching film adaptations. this individual can probably find something in the film he or she likes. I know that the film was interesting to watch once, if not simply to compare with previous adaptations.However, for the adaptation I would most like to watch MORE THAN ONCE, the 1998 adaptation (not the 2009) is my choice.One might also try Youtube for Wuthering Heights (1978), which is the most loyal adaptation and not currently available in Region 1 media markets.",3,Just Not My Favorite Adaptation...,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2025,"['believe', '2009', 'adaptation', 'captured', 'essence', 'Emily', 'Bront', 'novel', 'better', '1992', 'adaptation', 'However', '1998', 'still', 'favorite', 'However', 'am', 'NOT', 'saying', 'adaptation', 'was', 'very', 'different', '1998', 'many', 'respects', 'films', 'are', 'nearly', 'identical', 'Most', 'same', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'adaptation', 'None', 'adaptations', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'true', 'miniseries', 'where', 'novel', 'acted', 'out', 'entirety', 'certain', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'boring', 'am', 'not', 'writing', 'review', 'critique', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'substitute', 'reading', 'novel', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'think', '1998', 'Masterpiece', 'adaptation', 'better', 'telling', 'story.My', 'Main', 'Reasons:1.While', 'adaptation', 'slightly', 'longer', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'developed', 'minor', 'characters', 'better', '1998', 'possibly', 'develop', 'Joseph', 'character', 'slightly', 'more', 'not', 'Nelly', '2.Some', 'scenes', '1998', 'example', 'Heathcliff', 'hanging', 'dog', 'hook', 'trashing', 'Thrushcross', 'Grange', 'Linton', 'death', 'showed', 'Heathcliff', 'hate', 'grieve', 'etc', 'better', 'alternative', 'gambling', 'scenes', '2009', 'film.3.The', 'conclusion', 'film', 'letdown', '1998', 'even', '1992', 'end', 'better', 'film', 'adaptation', 'feel', 'am', 'being', 'led', 'think', 'Now', 'Heathcliff', 'dead', 'can', 'be', 'Catherine', 'rather', 'focusing', 'Catherine', 'II', 'future', 'happiness.FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'Certainly', 'someone', 'who', 'Emily', 'Bront', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'watching', 'film', 'adaptations', 'individual', 'can', 'probably', 'find', 'something', 'film', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'once', 'not', 'simply', 'compare', 'previous', 'adaptations.However', 'adaptation', 'would', 'most', 'like', 'watch', 'MORE', 'THAN', 'ONCE', '1998', 'adaptation', 'not', '2009', 'choice.One', 'might', 'also', 'try', 'Youtube', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', '1978', 'most', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'not', 'currently', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'media', 'markets']",Wuthering Heights
1229989,A311Z9223A52RW,B001PUTN3Y,"Ayesha ""Kathy""","[4, 6]","When I was in high school, I remember having to read such classics as ""Jane Eyre"", ""The Canterbury Tales"" (a poem), and the John Steinbeck novel, ""East of Eden.""  Each of these great works left its indelible mark and I never forgot them.  When a story sticks with you for years and years, you know it's a good one.  Outside of that, I never ventured much into the reading of classics.  And then I had the good fortune to see Masterpiece Theater's rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" on public television a few months ago, a classic that I had never read but thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  So when Masterpiece Theater aired ""Wuthering Heights"" recently, I thought I was in for another treat.Ignorant as to its storyline, I watched ""Wuthering Heights"" expecting a story more along the lines of ""Pride and Prejudice.""  The longer I watched, the more I expected something good to happen; that the boy who grew up under the loving eye of his caring benefactor and experienced the affection of his vivacious stepsister would overcome past hurts and would somehow make amends with his disaffected stepbrother.To those who haven't read the novel or watched the movie, you may want to skip the rest of my review as there will be plenty of spoilers.The heroine, Cathy, was young and inexperienced - yet I felt that she truly loved Heathcliff and was willing to run off with him rather than marry the wealthier Linton.  In her confusion, though, she acknowledges that she would be wealthy, considered a ""great lady"" by the townsfolk if she married Linton; but determines that it's truly Heathcliff whom she loves and could not live without.  Heathcliff overhears her boast of marrying Linton, being rich and considered a ""great lady""; but that's all he hears.  He immediately takes off without saying good-bye and isn't heard from again...until three years later when Cathy finally marries Linton.I couldn't help wondering...since Cathy waited so long to marry Linton...WHY didn't Heathcliff show up BEFORE she got married, like when he heard of their engagement, just to make sure whether she still loved him or not?  No, he does nothing of the kind.  Instead, he waits until right after their marriage and then shows up to cause trouble.  From then on, Heathcliff is a lost soul who becomes increasingly angry and besotted with revenge.  How he succeeds in destroying everyone around him, including himself, is what makes up the remainder of the movie.Seriously, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Heathcliff WENT OUT OF HIS WAY to make himself miserable.  I'm not sure I have ever seen a movie (especially one I initially considered a ""romance"") as depressing as this one.This movie is all about unbridled, obesessive passions; uncontrolled passions geared toward selfish desires and destructive ends.  At every turn, I kept hoping that something would happen that would compel Heathcliff toward regret, restraint, compassion, mercy, kindness, ANYTHING like that...but the more the movie progressed, the worse he became.  Cathy's death was an unmitigated tragedy that, I was surprised, didn't send him over the edge of madness.  Well, it did....eighteen years later.  That it took that long to do so I found unbelievable.  There is a scene where, after Heathcliff nearly kills his stepbrother, his wife tells him that his loving her would have been worse than his having hated her.  That says a lot about the character of Heathcliff.Another adjective that comes to mind when describing this movie is bizarre.  One of the most bizarre scenes out of a bizarre movie was when Heathcliff, 18 years after Cathy's death, literally digs up her grave, opens her coffin, and sees her lying there - beautiful, untouched by decay, and looking as if she were merely sleeping.  It's only in alternating camera angles that you see her body is nothing but a rotting skeleton, the scene giving the impression that he slept with her during the night.  I was confused as to whether this was supposed to have actually happened, or if he merely dreamed it.The story of the children...Cathy's daughter, Catherine, now a young woman; Heathcliff's son, a sickly young man who dies not long after his enforced marriage to Catherine (enforced by Heathcliff, no less), and Cathy's brother's son (can't remember his name) who was raised by Heathcliff, is adversely affected by Heathcliff's cloying passion for his dead lover.  When Heathcliff sees Cathy on the stairway landing, he follows her upstairs - and the next thing you hear is the gunshot wound that ends his miserable life.I suppose the final scene was supposed to convey some sort of ""positive"" ending as Catherine and her cousin walk arm-in-arm toward an awaiting carriage loaded with their belongings, as the supposed ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff look on.  It, however, didn't dissipate the sadness and depressing atmosphere of the movie - at least, not for me.Still...I thought the movie was well made, well acted and well written - despite its theme - and for that, I gave it 5 stars.  I'm not sure I've ever watched a Masterpiece Theater production that I didn't think was quality movie-making at its finest.  I am thankful for one thing...that this ""classic"" novel was NOT one that was required reading in high school!",5,Obsessive love at its most destructive,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,5261,"['When',

The thing that made this version so bloody awful is the writing. I could do a better job. That should give you an idea how bad it really is.Bronte's classic is presented to us by Peter Bowker as subtly as if we are reading a road map. We are told early on repeatedly that Heathcliff is a ""Gypsy"" who has not and never will make peace with God, and that he is out for revenge. We do not have to guess whether or not his character will alter, much less mature. In this adaptation they might get older, but they will never grow. Otherwise the dullest viewer might, heaven forbid, miss the trivial lessen passing by that he is now required to grasp.The world is so full of wonderful variations on the towering novels of Jane Austen and the Brontes that it is a wonder that until now none were really second-rate.

1229995,A3PO3YRFX4BI2J,B001PUTN3Y,CMCM,"[5, 6]","Wuthering Heights was one of my favorite novels from my youth.  I never particularly appreciated the Olivier film because Olivier himself did not in the least fit the physical conception of Heathcliff my mind had created when I read the novel.  Tom Hardy, however, mostly certain DOES play the perfect incarnation of Heathcliff:  His performance is passionate and exceptional, and he has a deep, powerful, resonant voice that reminds me of what I first noticed about the late Heath Ledger.  Hardy portrays Heathcliff as I think Bronte might have envisioned him:  Darkly handsome, powerful, dangerous, an undercurrent of evil obsessed with vengeance,  a commanding and compelling presence in every single scene, and strongly sensual beneath it all.  Unfortunately, I did not not feel Charlotte Riley  was the right actress for Cathy because she simply did not match Hardy's intensity and presence.  Riley is lovely and a good actress, but somehow she did not come across believably as the type of woman to inspire such undying passion in Heathcliff.  She seemed too conventional and reserved to appeal to him, and the various scenes portraying Cathy and Heathcliff running about the hills together was just too tame and was unconvincing as any sort of proof of her wilder side.  Cathy needed to be played by someone with an undeniably wild and uncontrollable nature such as we see in actresses like Angelina Jolie, for example.  Cathy needed to be shown as unconventional and wild, and that simply did not come across as Riley and this production portrayed her.  Heathcliff needed a Cathy who was a match for himself in feminine form, a woman who was a force of nature, so to speak.  Riley was just too tame.  The actress who portrayed Cathy's daughter Catherine actually seemed a bit stronger character compared to Cathy, but even she was a too mild in my opinion.  Other characters in this film were well done, however.It had been a very long time since I read Wuthering Heights, and I also noted that in this production the way the story line jumped about with the timeline was a bit confusing, and it took awhile before I remembered the details original story and how all the characters related to each other.  If I'd never read the book I would have been quite confused about the relationships.  For example, Heathcliff's son Linton appears early on, but I'd forgotten exactly who he was and who his mother was and what the circumstances of his life were.  All in all, I think Masterpiece Theater would have done better to make this longer by another 2-hour episode, just to flesh out all the missing details that were glossed over a bit too  much for continuity.Despite the flaws, this production was absolutely gorgeous and the accompanying music was perfect to set the mood, and it was very compelling to watch.  Good enough that I've ordered the film to re-watch it, mainly because of Hardy's wonderful performance.  He really was the perfect Heathcliff, the one I've imagined all my life.For those who haven't read the novel, this really is one of the most intense love stories ever written.  The author Emily Bronte wrote only this one novel, which was published in 1847, only about a year before her death at age 30.

1230000,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001PUTN3Y,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[134, 140]","Director Coky Giedroyc provides the newly thrice-spliced Masterpiece Theatre with a two and a half-hour remake of Emily Bronte's Gothic classic, ""Wuthering Heights (Signet Classics)"" that adequately depicts the passionate love/hate relationship made famous by Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff for readers since 1847.I have not had the pleasure of rereading the novel for a few years, but this adaptation seems remarkably true to the overall spirit of the story.  It includes the two generations of Earnshaws and Lintons most noticeably removed from the 1939 film version starring Lawrence Olivier as Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as Catherine (Wuthering Heights 1939 Classic Black and White with Original Theatrical Trailer (Import, All-Region)).  The non-linear time sequencing of the film's plot mirrors the timeline of the novel; the only real difference here is the absence of the novel's first person narrators, Mr. Lockwood (Heathcliff's tenant) and Nellie (housekeeper of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange).  Giedroyc's version employs a third person technique in both the flashback and present day storyline to retell the Earnshaw/Linton history rather than rely on the biased comments of Bronte's storytellers.Lockwood's absence also means the sequence of events revolving around the apparition of Catherine's ghost does not move the plotline.  Instead the opening scene treats us to a vengeful Heathcliff, manipulating his sickly son Linton's marriage to the second generation Catherine, daughter of Edgar and his love.  In fact, the entire aspect of the supernatural is not touched upon in the film as intensely as in the novel.  Heathcliff yearns for his dead companion, and participates in a ghoulish digging up of Catherine's corpse.  In a fantastic feat of cinematography the audience is privy to two vantage points:  Heathcliff's vision of her--young and fully fleshed as if alive--and then the gruesome reality seen from behind Heathcliff's back--Catherine's decomposing skull.  This film emphasizes the real and the gritty rather than the ethereal.Similarly, it includes some passionate and psychologically intense moments that add carnality to the overall telling of the story that fits well with and enhances the wild emotions portrayed by Bronte.  Heathcliff and his Catherine consummate their love on the moors; Edgar desperately makes love to Catherine in their marriage bed and Heathcliff commands that his wife not look at him as he takes her after their impromptu elopement.  Somehow these moments add drama and needed adult content and motivation to what the other adaptations skirted around.  When Heathcliff realizes that his woman has slept with Edgar, his anger boils over with helpless indignation.  He wants revenge and after witnessing his closeness to Catherine, the audience sees him more as a jilted second choice despite his accomplishment; the face of the gypsy orphan still stares back at him.Not that actor Tom Hardy resembles a gypsy in any way. His incontrollable mop of dark brown hair flops annoyingly onto his face; it definitely could use a trim or a ribbon holding it away.  Nevertheless, he does the character of Heathcliff and the Byronic hero justice; he most decidedly reigns supreme in the scenes in which he participates.  His passion seems almost Pilate-controlled from a steel core that is both practical and functional within the constraints of his world.  However, like the novel's character, he loses himself frequently with a cynic's paranoia that lashes out with the intent to destroy whatever is in its path.Cathy, on the other hand, as portrayed by Charlotte Riley has a feral beauty that aptly suggests the novel's heroine.  However, Riley's Catherine has been ""de-bratted""; the novel depicts Cathy with a nasty selfish streak while this Masterpiece Presentation shows us a confused child/woman that indeed does what she chooses but then seems at odds with the results.Isolation plays a big part in Bronte's novel.  However, this film fills the screen with an assemblage of others that makes the entire presentation more real.  Rather than just the dire foursome and their progeny, villagers, church-goers, barroom card players and fighting children add authenticity to the period and in comparison more starkness to the actual footage shot on the moors.Bottom Line?  The 2009 presentation of ""Wuthering Heights"" created for Masterpiece Theatre Classics smolders with a raw sexuality and practical strength that will probably not please most purists.  Nevertheless, the film's team put together a good adaptation that brings the feel of the novel to life without imitating other film presentations of the past.

The cinematography was great, sound excellent, and sets and scenics beautiful. When I say this is the best version, that would be among those I have seen. In looking on the internet, there appear to have been at least 11 productions of this, plus, of course, the original book. I have seen the old one with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, directed by William Wyler, and the one with Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche. All 3 vary a bit from the book, and all 3 are somewhat incomplete when compared with the book. But, until someone makes a 6 hour version or something, some matter has to be left out. What this focused on was the middle part of the book, which was the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. I don't think Lockwood is even mentioned in this film version.

In fact, the movie came in parts 1 and 2 as if these were two separate hours of TV viewing. It was surprisingly little altered from the TV version, but I'm not complaining. The movie was well produced. I particularly liked the bleak and gloomy far north glaciated setting. I'd guess it to be filmed in northern Scotland. Somehow the bleak setting fit in remarkably well with the story as it unfolded. The old castle-like setting was magnificent. The costuming and acting were first rate, as was the cinema. To make it short, the movie was very well done.Wuthering Heights is a classical and widely-acclaimed novel and several movies have been made based on it. Well, sorry, but I just didn't care for the story at all and I would never, now, read the book or go back and watch or re-watch any of the movie versions. Whether it's movies or novels, I just don't care for stories that severly depress me and this one certainly did. I can see literary or cinema critics loving it. Somehow, that's easy. It's a bleak and dreary love story where everyone suffers and everyone loses. Well, I feel that I lost in watching it. However, that's just a personal opinion and others may feel quite differently.

The moors are stark with Wuthering Heights looming like an ancient curse.The primary story is about three children--Hindley, Catherine and Heathcliff.  Catherine and Heathcliff become soul mates while Hindley allows hate and disgust for Heathcliff to fester.  His harsh treatment of his ""brother"" lays the seeds for future misery and death.Edgar and Isabella Linton are tragic figures caught in the star crossed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. Edgar marries Catherine and Isabella marries Heathcliff.  While Edgar loves Catherine with a passion, she cannot love him with the same passion. Heathcliff cannot love Isabella which brings her a joyless existence.The secondary story deals with the three offspring.  Hareton, son of Hindley; Catherine, daughter of Edgar and Catherine; and Linton, Heathcliff and Isabella's son are victims in Heathcliff's desires for revenge.  Heathcliff by treachery acquires Wuthering Heights and Hareton as his servant.Like all gothic novels the characters suffer.  Their lives are destined for misery.Heathcliff is a tragic hero and villain rolled into a complexity which unravels as he allows his grief for Catherine, his true love, to dominate Wuthering Heights and all of those connected to it.  He is a cruel taskmaster as he relives his childhood abuse in those he torments.  Like a cruel chess master he shows no mercy, no compassion, even for his own son.  When Catherine died many years before, Heathcliff's soul died.  He is now a man with no compassion, no love, no soul, and no light.Wuthering Heights was the only novel written by Emily Bronte under the name Ellis Bell. Emily was a parson's daughter.

1230010,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B001PUTN3Y,Hikari,"[4, 6]","This is a beautifully-photographed but ultimately rather flat adaptation of the classic Gothic romance by Emily Bronte.  There is much to love: a haunting, delicate score, fantastic production values for a project made for television; brooding moors and a real find in newcomer Charlotte Riley, who makes a fetchingly fiesty gamine and suitably northern Cathy Earnshaw.  For me this production stumbles on a few crucial points, however.  Tom Hardy brings a silky menace to Heathcliff which is an interesting take on a famously brutish character, but with his full lips, small squinty eyes and soft features, on the whole I couldn't buy him as Bronte's brutal yet sexy Gypsy.  His delivery was too polished by far for an illiterate stablehand as well, though that served him better in the later parts of the film after Heathcliff has turned himself into a gentleman of sorts.  This version allows Cathy and Heathcliff a few scenes of real passion, but despite them, I didn't quite feel the irresistible animal attraction between this pair.  I was completely thrown by the series' first half hour, which jumped back and forth in time so much I thought I'd accidentally selected the second half of the program.  The familiar beginning is completely gone.I may be in the minority by preferring the 1992 theatrical version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes.  Fiennes succeeded rather better at Heathcliff's cruelty, but also his passion.  Charlotte Riley is a more authentic Cathy in terms of her heritage, but Binoche offers a more nuanced performance; contrast the 'My love for Edgar is like the foliage in the woods; time will change it.  My love for Heathcliff is like the eternal rocks beneath . .'speech of the two for proof. Ms. Riley still has some growth ahead of her as an actress.People often forget that Nelly is the narrator, and therefore the heart of the novel, since she is so often given a background role in the cinematic treatments, but it's crucial that Nelly be a strong character, functioning as she does as confidant and conscience of the entire household--essentially a mother to all.  Sarah Lancashire's meek and mousy portrayal of a fairly standard 19th century household servant can't touch Janet McTeer's maternal yet fiery perfomance in the earlier film.  The other supporting characters are conventionally-done as well, though no expense has been spared in the period costumes and detail.  Worthwhile if you are a Wuthering Heights fanatic, but in my view, the 1992 version was the definitive one, making this one, at best, redundant.",3,Bleak House,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,2565,"['beautifully-photographed', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'flat', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'much', 'love', 'haunting', 'delicate', 'score', 'fantastic', 'production', 'values', 'project', 'made', 'television', 'brooding', 'moors', 'real', 'find', 'newcomer', 'Charlotte', 'Riley', 'who', 'fetchingly', 'fiesty', 'gamine', 'suitably', 'northern', 'Cathy', 'Earnshaw', 'production', 'few', 'crucial', 'points', 'however', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'silky', 'menace', 'Heathcliff', 'interesting', 'take', 'famously', 'brutish', 'character', 'full', 'lips', 'small', 'squinty', 'eyes', 'soft', 'features', 'whole', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Bronte', 'brutal', 'yet', 'sexy', 'Gypsy', 'delivery', 'was', 'too', 'polished', 'far', 'illiterate', 'stablehand', 'as', 'well', 'served', 'better', 'later', 'parts', 'film', 'Heathcliff', 'turned', 'gentleman', 'sorts', 'version', 'Cathy', 'Heathcliff', 'few', 'scenes', 'real', 'passion', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'irresistible', 'animal', 'attraction', 'pair', 'was', 'completely', 'thrown', 'series', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'jumped', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'thought', ""'d"", 'accidentally', 'selected', 'second', 'half', 'program', 'familiar', 'beginning', 'completely', 'gone.I', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'preferring', '1992', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Fiennes', 'succeeded', 'rather', 'better', 'Heathcliff', 'cruelty', 'also', 'passion', 'Charlotte', 'Riley', 'more', 'authentic', 'Cathy', 'terms', 'heritage', 'Binoche', 'more', 'nuanced', 'performance', ""'My"", 'love', 'Edgar', 'foliage', 'woods', 'time', 'will', 'change', 'love', 'Heathcliff', 'eternal', 'rocks', 'beneath', ""'speech"", 'two', 'proof', 'Ms.', 'Riley', 'still', 'growth', 'ahead', 'actress.People', 'often', 'Nelly', 'narrator', 'therefore', 'heart', 'novel', 'so', 'often', 'given', 'background', 'role', 'cinematic', 'treatments', 'crucial', 'Nelly', 'be', 'strong', 'character', 'functioning', 'confidant', 'conscience', 'entire', 'household', 'essentially', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Lancashire', 'meek', 'mousy', 'portrayal', 'fairly', 'standard', '19th', 'century', 'household', 'servant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'maternal', 'yet', 'fiery', 'perfomance', 'earlier', 'film', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'conventionally-done', 'well', 'expense', 'been', 'spared', 'period', 'costumes', 'detail', 'are', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'fanatic', 'view', '1992', 'version', 'was', 'definitive', 'one', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'redundant']",Wuthering Heights

I confess that my main reason for getting excited to watch this movie is because of Twilight.  Remember how Bella and Edward are always talking about Cathy and Heathcliff?  I wanted to see what all that fuss was about.All I remembered from reading the book back in high school was that the story is sad and set on the moors.  Watching the movie brought it all back to me, though: just how sad the story is and what a love/hate relationship Cathy and Heathcliff truly have.I think that Tom Hardy as Heathcliff did an excellent job.  His mannerisms were perfect and gave him an air of manic desperation.  He was longed to be with Cathy, but his own arrogance got in the way of happiness.  Instead, he turned into a scorned, spiteful being whose only purpose was hate and bringing despair to those he felt wronged by.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, although on the whole, the story is dark and haunting.

Charlotte Riley and Tom Hardy are spot on as Catherine and Heathcliff.  The chemistry between the two is electrifying.  I was not surprised to learn these two are a real-life couple.***WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY***Wuthering Heights is a dark and forbidden love story between a young woman, Catherine, and her adopted gypsy brother, Heathcliff.  The movie is based on the novel and portrays the possessive, violent and obsessive nature of the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff beautifully.  Even though neither of the starcrossed lovers is a particulary good person, you can't help but want them to be together.  After the death of Catherine's father, her brother returns and takes over Wuthering Heights and control of Heathcliff; treating him like a servant and abusing him.  I actually felt sorry for Heathcliff.  He was treated horribly by Cathy's brother and was ultimately betrayed by Cathy.  He genuinely loved her and she had broken his heart.  Her betrayal is what made him so cruel and started his downward descent into madness.  Catherine was quite an unlikable character as she dismisses Heathcliff for wealth and her reputation in ""proper society.""

Also the music and cinematography was great.On the downside, there's a scene when Heathcliff and Catherine are in a chapel, and Heathcliff says one sentence that makes me cringe and puts me off, and I don't remember it being in the book, so I really don't understand why they added that to the movie. My other gripe with this movie is the ending, they (Spoiler alert) have Heathcliff blowing his brains out.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[3, 3]","""Wuthering Heights"" the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of the 1847 publication for the 2009 audience is interesting and holds your interest.  Much artistic license was added to the Bronte novel, but it still  has the strong message of class differences in 19th-century England.The first scene shows a revengeful Heathcliff, forcing his son (who is dying from a mysterious illness) to marry the daughter of Cathy, who was/is his true and only love.  Heathcliff is then shown digging up the grave of Cathy and hugging a skeleton with huge sobs as he lay in the grave with her.  That may shock the viewer as haunting and gross, but the story then quickly flashes back to when he met her.The privileged Earnshaw children have a doting father.  He goes out on trips often and  when he returns to their home, Wuthering Heights, usually bring them presents.  As the story opens Cathy (Charlotte Riley)  and her brother are given the gift of a Gypsy step-brother, Heathcliff (Tom Hardy), after one of their father's trips.  They expected other gifts, but got Heathcliff instead.  He is quiet and mysterious, wearing dark and raggy clothes.  There are some hints in the dialogue that Heathcliff is their father's illigitimate son, which would make him a half-brother.  Cathy is a free spirit and a tom boy and enjoys the friendship of Heathcliff as they grow up together.  Her brother, Hindley (Burn Gorman) is insanely jealous and resentful of Heathcliff infringing on his life and possibly his inheritance.  He never forgives his father for bringing him home.  After their father dies unexpectedly, he makes Heathcliff a servant/slave and unfit husband material for Cathy.  Heathcliff and Cathy have a deep enduring love, but Cathy wants security and marries Edgar Linton (Andrew Lincoln) that can provide for her.  This causes repercussions and revenge for generations.Overall the story is an  engrossing and revived period classic, with beautiful cinematography of Wuthering Heights, Thrushcross Grange, and the Moors.  The cast is fabulous and move smoothly together.  Also, the story is a bit more exciting as it is touched up with a bit of 21st Century passion/carnality.",4,Classic Novel Altered for Today's Audience,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,2169,"['Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'adaptation', '1847', 'publication', '2009', 'audience', 'interesting', 'interest', 'Much', 'artistic', 'license', 'was', 'added', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'still', 'strong', 'message', 'class', 'differences', '19th-century', 'England.The', 'first', 'scene', 'revengeful', 'Heathcliff', 'forcing', 'son', 'who', 'dying', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'marry', 'daughter', 'Cathy', 'who', 'was/is', 'true', 'only', 'love', 'Heathcliff', 'then', 'shown', 'digging', 'up', 'grave', 'Cathy', 'hugging', 'skeleton', 'huge', 'sobs', 'lay', 'grave', 'may', 'shock', 'viewer', 'haunting', 'gross', 'story', 'then', 'quickly', 'back', 'when', 'met', 'her.The', 'privileged', 'Earnshaw', 'children', 'have', 'doting', 'father', 'out', 'trips', 'often', 'when', 'home', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'usually', 'bring', 'presents', 'story', 'Cathy', 'Charlotte', 'Riley', 'brother', 'are', 'given', 'gift', 'Gypsy', 'step-brother', 'Heathcliff', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'one', 'father', 'trips', 'expected', 'other', 'gifts', 'got', 'Heathcliff', 'instead', 'quiet', 'mysterious', 'wearing', 'dark', 'raggy', 'clothes', 'are', 'hints', 'dialogue', 'Heathcliff', 'father', 'illigitimate', 'son', 'would', 'make', 'half-brother', 'Cathy', 'free', 'spirit', 'tom', 'boy', 'friendship', 'Heathcliff', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'brother', 'Hindley', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'resentful', 'Heathcliff', 'infringing', 'life', 'possibly', 'inheritance', 'never', 'father', 'bringing', 'home', 'father', 'dies', 'unexpectedly', 'servant/slave', 'unfit', 'husband', 'material', 'Cathy', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy', 'have', 'deep', 'enduring', 'love', 'Cathy', 'security', 'marries', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'can', 'provide', 'repercussions', 'revenge', 'story', 'engrossing', 'revived', 'period', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Thrushcross', 'Grange', 'Moors', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'move', 'smoothly', 'together', 'Also', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'exciting', 'touched', 'up', 'bit', '21st', 'Century', 'passion/carnality']",Wuthering Heights

As a former college professor, I found it difficult to engage my students in reading the novel instead of Cliff's Notes. I think this film version of the novel would definitely inspire those not used to reading 19th century lit to attack the novel with new eyes. I say fresh rendering because the torrid love/hate relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy is the core of the film. It is also about abandonment, including Cathy's. The film is not burdened by the triple narratives of the book. The novel is a Gothic one, but the film dispenses with the supernatural elements that would seem distracting if included.  Heathcliff's plea to the dying Cathy to haunt him so they can still be together, Cathy's plea that he let her die in his arms,imagining that she would be tossed out of heaven for loving him too much, the etchings on the wooden wall reading Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton, Catherine Heathcliff, all of these hint at the resignation of the lovers that their lives together are doomed.I am appreciative of the inclusion of carnal scenes, implicit and explicit, that are merely intimated in  the novel. Heathcliff and Cathy tearing each other apart on the crag where they had earlier ""lay with each other"" and Heathcliff's anguished lovemaking to Isabella where he attempts to feel Cathy's body instead of his wife's. ""Turn your face away,"" he tells her.I thought the actors wonderful. Tom Hardy's embodiment of  the brooding, obsessive Heathcliff is remarkable and the newcomer playing Cathy very good despite shrinking a bit in Hardy's tour de force.Purists will probably not endorse this version, but it is far and away the best film to capture the essence of the novel, the raw, violent passion between the lovers which is the lynchpin of the story.",5,Not your mother's Heights,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,1873,"['adaptation', 'fresh', 'rendering', 'complex', 'passions', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'former', 'college', 'professor', 'found', 'difficult', 'engage', 'students', 'reading', 'novel', 'instead', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'think', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'would', 'definitely', 'inspire', 'not', 'used', 'reading', '19th', 'century', 'lit', 'attack', 'novel', 'new', 'eyes', 'say', 'fresh', 'rendering', 'torrid', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy', 'core', 'film', 'also', 'about', 'abandonment', 'including', 'Cathy', 'film', 'not', 'burdened', 'triple', 'narratives', 'book', 'novel', 'Gothic', 'one', 'film', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'would', 'seem', 'distracting', 'included', 'Heathcliff', 'plea', 'dying', 'Cathy', 'haunt', 'so', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'together', 'Cathy', 'plea', 'let', 'die', 'arms', 'imagining', 'would', 'be', 'tossed', 'heaven', 'loving', 'too', 'much', 'etchings', 'wooden', 'wall', 'reading', 'Catherine', 'Earnshaw', 'Catherine', 'Linton', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'hint', 'resignation', 'lovers', 'lives', 'together', 'are', 'doomed.I', 'am', 'appreciative', 'inclusion', 'carnal', 'scenes', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'are', 'merely', 'intimated', 'novel', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy', 'tearing', 'other', 'apart', 'crag', 'where', 'had', 'earlier', 'lay', 'other', 'Heathcliff', 'anguished', 'lovemaking', 'Isabella', 'where', 'feel', 'Cathy', 'body', 'instead', 'wife', 'Turn', 'face', 'away', 'her.I', 'thought', 'actors', 'wonderful', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'embodiment', 'brooding', 'obsessive', 'Heathcliff', 'remarkable', 'newcomer', 'playing', 'Cathy', 'very', 'good', 'shrinking', 'bit', 'Hardy', 'tour', 'de', 'force.Purists', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'endorse', 'version', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'film', 'capture', 'essence', 'novel', 'raw', 'violent', 'passion', 'lovers', 'lynchpin', 'story']",Wuthering Heights

Schwartzman ""That '70s Guy""","[4, 6]","Based on all that has been written on the blogs and discussion boards, this latest production of ""Wuthering Heights"" has certainly incited passions about the changes and omissions from the book (such as how Catherine's explanation of why she will marry Edgar unfolds and numerous other tweaks to the story). Personally, I thought the narrative thread was disjointed, which makes it somewhat hard to follow unless one is already very well acquainted with the book. In this respect (and for this reason alone), I prefer the previous Masterpiece version from 1998.

1230056,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B001PUTN3Y,Strawgold,"[2, 2]","It is my suspicion that ""Wuthering Heights"" was Emily Bronte's own personal fantasy.  Such a tale of impossible, dark beauty of passionately requited, obsessive love between two star crossed lovers torn asunder by demands of class and society could only be born in the mind of one who personally desired, but never found what she was looking for herself.  For one thing, Emily Bronte (a preacher's daughter) was very like her heroine, Cathy; never at home anywhere beyond the moors, a free spirit denying the influence of others; even using a pseudonym to protect herself (and I'm sure, her family) from censure as she cast this iconoclastic novel to the winds of literary fate.  In dying at age 30, she perhaps never came close to a Heathcliff of her imagination, but she left a story of enduring proportions for the rest of us.  Once seen, it is unforgettable; truly worthy of the acclaim of ""Masterpiece"".  The book, which I haven't read for many, many years stirs the imagination; the movie brings the vibrance of life - the essential dimension.Heathcliff initially appears at Wuthering Heights with the patriarch of the family, who has been away on business and reappears with a strange young boy in tow, whom he says he found wandering the streets of London and decided to adopt him.  (the whispered public opinion of this was that the boy was the result of a  misalliance between the old gentleman and a Gypsy lady of the evening, which actually is more plausible when you think of it; but it is not truly revealed as such, it is left dangling, open to interpretation)  He already has two children, a beautiful little girl, Cathy and her surly older brother, Hindley - who immediately becomes insanely jealous of Heathcliff, whom he views as the usurper in his comfortable world.  Cathy and Heathcliff are also immediately attracted to each other, because they are alike in every way that matters - first as children playing on the Moors;  the bonding emotions deepening in natural progression as they mature - flaming into obsessive passions, sharing their very souls as well.  But the problems of family interventions begin to appear at that point, throwing them headlong into the turmoil of ""for appearances sake and the station in life"" thing.Finally driven out by his own pride and the unrelenting torment of his insecure and jealous foster brother after the father dies, Heathcliff leaves - but grimly vows to return with the means to destroy those who ruined his own life and thwarted his chances with the love he wants from Cathy.  But it takes time to prepare for revenge, and time is never a friend of youth in matters of the heart.  When he does return, having amassed his own worldly goods ""the same way it is always done, taking advantage of the weaknesses of other men"", it is far too late and thereby lies the tale that leaves them all destitute in its wake.  The final moments of the film are symbolic of the aftermath, with the bittersweet victory revealed in the strangest of ways.""Oh, my fortune has changed me in every *way* - except one - and I would change that too, if I could."" (Heathcliff to Cathy)Perhaps it's because I'm secretly an admitted incurable romantic in many ways but this is my favorite of the ""Wuthering Heights"" films; I have seen several versions.  This one smolders in the chemistry between the actors; taking far more freedom in portraying the heady love story - as it so richly deserves.  The casting is superb; Tom Hardy in long hair as the brooding and angry Heathcliff, and Charlotte Riley, taking the role of Cathy, the beautiful, willful woman whom he loves and loses, driving him beyond the brink of madness.The ""forward"" comments for Masterpiece Theatre by Laura Linney highlight the ""story behind the story"" life of the author of this intriguing tale, reminding us once again that not everything great is appreciated at first blush.

I watched it from end to end without drawing breath, until the last scene, when their ghosts watch the children leave the Heights for good.
