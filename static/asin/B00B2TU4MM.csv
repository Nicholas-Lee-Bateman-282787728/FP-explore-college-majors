The man is part of a group of guardians that must protect the Tamayori Princess. And much to her surprise, Tamaki happens to be that Tamayori Princess. All the guardians have special powers to guard her from creatures and from an organization that wants to harness her powers for their own. The guardians reluctantly follow Tamaki around. But little by little she wins over their hearts and they become friends. During her stay at the shrine the part demon man's powers are awakening and her powers to control him have yet to surface. Meanwhile, her grandmother is plotting to do something terrible that involves her and the guardians.I just happened to come across this show one morning and had to keep watching. The story has some romance and comedy mixed in with magic and adventure. There are so many great characters in the story. The scenery is colorful and realistically magical. It takes place during Fall when the leaves are changing colors. The music is amazing and beautiful. I love the theme songs of both seasons. The singer has such a beautiful voice. I'm glad the show continued with another season.",5,"Romantic, Adventure, Magical Story, Beautiful Music",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1238,"['Tamaki', 'visit', 'grandma', 'attacked', 'strange', 'creatures', 'only', 'be', 'rescued', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'demon', 'man', 'part', 'group', 'guardians', 'must', 'protect', 'Tamayori', 'Princess', 'much', 'surprise', 'Tamaki', 'be', 'Tamayori', 'Princess', 'guardians', 'have', 'special', 'powers', 'guard', 'creatures', 'organization', 'harness', 'powers', 'own', 'guardians', 'reluctantly', 'follow', 'Tamaki', 'little', 'little', 'hearts', 'become', 'friends', 'stay', 'shrine', 'part', 'man', 'powers', 'are', 'awakening', 'powers', 'control', 'have', 'yet', 'surface', 'Meanwhile', 'grandmother', 'plotting', 'do', 'something', 'terrible', 'guardians.I', 'just', 'happened', 'come', 'show', 'one', 'morning', 'had', 'keep', 'watching', 'story', 'romance', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'magic', 'adventure', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'characters', 'story', 'scenery', 'colorful', 'realistically', 'magical', 'place', 'Fall', 'when', 'leaves', 'are', 'changing', 'colors', 'music', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'love', 'theme', 'songs', 'seasons', 'singer', 'beautiful', 'voice', ""'m"", 'glad', 'show', 'continued', 'season']",N/A
1621302,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B00B2TU4MM,NC,"[13, 21]","In three episodes. I'm not kidding. Most of this series is utterly pointless and it can be condensed into three episodes. You can literally watch the first couple episodes and then skip to the final episode. You won't really miss much. I came to the end of this series and was totally enraged because it strings you along till then and then you realize how pointless much of this show is. I wanted my 300 minutes back that I wasted on this.However, lets consider that this is in part, a reverse harem series for girls. The characters themselves are not badly done. But it does follow very predictable story arcs. She is pretty transparent in who she likes from the first episode, which is similar to traditional harem anime on the boys side too. The romance side plays on it's tip toes which is similar to regular harem. Season two is said to make things better but I couldn't stomach to let this series have any more of my time.Onto to the main story and action, the battles are just way too one sided and this doesn't change. It isn't like others where eventually things get even. It is a common routine of: get butt kicked, feel sad, cheer up time, get macho, charge in, rinse and repeat. Then you have antagonists which are beyond moronic and take their sweet time for no real reason. Which to me is just to make filler till the final episode. Don't get me wrong, stuff happens during the show, but it isn't necessary to draw out the entire series just to make it happen when you have stories this thin. You can argue it is for character building but so many of the characters are so cookie cutter that you really don't need to get to know them. You know the character it is from the moment you meet them!This is a very underwhelming series. It should have not been given a full season run let alone a season two. But if you haven't seen better then I'm sure this series is anime gold. I'm just warning the rest of you that it'll keep you watching till the end and then you'll realize how poor the show is. If you must, give it a rental to know if it is a show you like. Otherwise stay away from this one. Generic reverse harem mixed with weak supernatural battling and poor storytelling = blech!",2,A story which can be easily told...,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,2200,"['three', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'Most', 'series', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'can', 'be', 'condensed', 'three', 'episodes', 'can', 'literally', 'watch', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'then', 'skip', 'final', 'episode', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'much', 'came', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'totally', 'enraged', 'till', 'then', 'then', 'realize', 'how', 'pointless', 'much', 'show', 'wanted', '300', 'minutes', 'back', 'wasted', 'this.However', 'consider', 'part', 'reverse', 'harem', 'series', 'girls', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'badly', 'done', 'follow', 'very', 'predictable', 'story', 'arcs', 'pretty', 'transparent', 'who', 'first', 'episode', 'similar', 'traditional', 'harem', 'anime', 'boys', 'side', 'too', 'romance', 'side', 'tip', 'toes', 'similar', 'regular', 'harem', 'Season', 'two', 'said', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'let', 'series', 'have', 'more', 'time.Onto', 'main', 'story', 'action', 'battles', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'one', 'sided', ""n't"", 'change', ""n't"", 'like', 'others', 'where', 'eventually', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'common', 'routine', 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'feel', 'sad', 'cheer', 'up', 'time', 'get', 'macho', 'charge', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'Then', 'have', 'antagonists', 'are', 'moronic', 'take', 'sweet', 'time', 'real', 'reason', 'Which', 'just', 'make', 'filler', 'final', 'episode', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'stuff', 'happens', 'show', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'draw', 'out', 'entire', 'series', 'just', 'make', 'happen', 'when', 'have', 'stories', 'thin', 'can', 'argue', 'character', 'building', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'know', 'know', 'character', 'moment', 'meet', 'very', 'underwhelming', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'full', 'season', 'run', 'let', 'alone', 'season', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'better', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'series', 'anime', 'gold', ""'m"", 'just', 'warning', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'till', 'end', 'then', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'how', 'poor', 'show', 'must', 'give', 'rental', 'know', 'show', 'Otherwise', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'Generic', 'reverse', 'harem', 'mixed', 'weak', 'supernatural', 'battling', 'poor', 'storytelling', '=', 'blech']",N/A
