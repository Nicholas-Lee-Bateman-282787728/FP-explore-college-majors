1094598,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000UAFDR0,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The Werewolf, 1956 filmLegends of werewolves goes back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The movie begins in a bar. A stranger is passing through town. After he leaves a man tries to rob him; a bad career move. ""Only an animal can do that."" Get your guns! ""Those are wolf tracks."" Colby was hurt pretty bad. Will he get the Pasteur treatment for rabies? A murder report must be submitted. That stranger awakes in the morning and puts on his socks and shoes. The people in town are banned from hunting in the woods. Can a lightly dressed man survive in the woods in winter? The roads are blocked. Reporters are inquisitive. Duncan Marsh shows up at Doctor Gilchrist's house with a memory loss. What happened to him? He runs away. The sheriff will search the woods with the townsmen. Can they take him alive? We see Dr. Morgan Chamber's laboratory where he has dogs in a cages. Can people be immunized against radiation? [This provides a skimpy background to this strange story.] Mrs. Helen Marsh with her son Chris arrive in an Oldsmobile to search for her husband.The search for the werewolf goes on. Drs. Morgan Chambers and Emery Forrest search for Marsh in the hills. Stress affects Marsh, he turns into a monster and attacks Forrest. Later an attack on a sheep creates a new alarm in the country. Can a bear trap catch the werewolf? They find Duncan Marsh's abandoned car. The werewolf takes the bait and is caught in the bear trap, but he escapes. Chambers and Forrest discuss a cover-up for what they did. ""Newspapers are always looking for a sensation."" The Sheriff and the townsmen search for Marsh with a new device, a portable voice amplifier. [The right to keep and bear arms was unquestioned.] The wolfman is captured alive and put into a jail cell. What caused this to happen? Its quiet in the night. Chambers and Forrest are up to no good again. [Does Chambers' domination of Forrest have a hidden clue?] Their plans go awry! [Poetic justice?] Marsh escapes, the townsmen search in the woods. Torches are thrown at the monster. The chase goes on. The men shoot at him. In the end Marsh changes back to a human form.This low-budget movie used little-known actors (who look like real people). Its story echoes earlier horror movies. Yet is has value as a morality play for that era. It is worth watching. Some say ""horror movies"" become popular in a depression or recession, and some parts of a country are more affected. The story of ""scientists"" who experiment on people without informed consent was all too true. [Read the book ""Journey Into Madness"".] The legends of werewolves in olden times often originated after an outbreak of rabies. Wolves and other wild animals are often carriers of rabies. Anyone bit by a rabid wolf would, as the disease progressed, become violent and attack other people. There was no cure or prevention before Louis Pasteur's discovery of a vaccine. Some compared the legends of werewolves to the economic cycle where a number of good years would be followed by a number of bad years, seemingly beyond human control, like the weather.***Creature with the Atom Brain, 1954 filmA man drives a Ford to a house. He delivers a satchel with $20,000 to Hennessey, a good take. Then a man crashes into the window to kill him! Others break in and shoot at him, but he keeps on going. ""Drive home."" The first one is eliminated, there are others. The two men dress in protective gear to enter a laboratory. ""Different parts of the bodies die at different times. The brain is the first to go."" The police arrive to investigate. ""The killer had enormous strength."" His fingerprints are luminous! The scientists said the blood had crystalline substances but no hemoglobin. It is highly radioactive too! This creature can't be killed with bullets. ""I don't believe it."" The fingerprints identify the perpetrator: he died weeks ago in prison! Next DA McGraw is killed in his garage. What is the connection? How could the dead come back to life? Michael Faraday showed how dead frog legs could move. Nowadays it could be radioactive forces.""Why did it happen in my administration?"" asks one official. The newspaper reports two dead men walk the streets. Daughter Penny can't read the comics or watch TV. Uncle Dave found out when McGraw and Hennessy worked together to convict Buchanan. The Captain warns the others that Buchanan may be back and they must be on guard. Buchanan has disappeared along with his German doctor Steig. [Note the old TV set.] A truck with a detector on its roof passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala of the brain. A truck with a detector passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala. Could this be applied to humans? Buchanan directs Steig to his next task. The Police Chief is asked to stop the search, or else.There are many accidents in trains, planes, and vehicles on the roads and highways! The Governor declares a state of emergency. ""Carry your papers when you travel"" is the advice for the people. Captain Harris becomes a victim and test subject! Penny opens the door for Uncle Dave (his hand is cold). Capt. Davis visits the two men kept hidden in jail. There is an APB on Harris when the bodies are found. Harris is taken to a hospital for an examination. [You can guess how this story will end.]This is an interesting story that combines a murder mystery (the search for a killer) with a horror story of a new man-made monster (like Dr. Victor Frankenstein's creation) and the novel feature of atomic radiation. This story uses atomic radiation as a power source. But atomic radiation only kills, it doesn't create life Was it meant to symbolize the dangers from atomic bombs?",4,Weird Science in the Rockies / When the Dead Walk in the Daylight,1308096000,"06 15,

1094602,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B000UAFDR0,Chip Kaufmann,"[13, 13]","Seeing these four films again, which were TV staples when I was growing up, makes me realize just how much I miss the drive-in theatres that they were made for. They not only provided cheap entertainment and a place to be alone with your certain someone but they also gave filmmakers the opportunity to make a wide variety of movies with limited resources. Scorsese, Coppola, and Spielberg first cut their teeth on films like these as viewers and then later as burgeoning low budget filmmakers.Today no one cranks out films with the speed and efficiency that producer Sam Katzman did in the 50s and early 60s and that's truly a shame. Between 1955 and 1961 Katzman's Clover Productions turned out an astonishing 36 films for Columbia Pictures many of them directed by the two men represented here Fred F. Sears and Edward L. Cahn. Look them up on imdb for a complete listing of their films many of which are drive-in classics but too numerous to go into here.Sears has the distinction of having the best and worst films in this set with THE WEREWOLF a surprisingly moody and moving film and THE GIANT CLAW with the worst giant monster ever. The poor actors never saw the creature until after it was added in which is why they treat it so seriously whereas the bird itself seems a deliberate parody of bad special effects.""Fast Eddie"" Cahn as he was known in the trade shoots his two films CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU with as few edits as possible in order to economize and that makes them very interesting to watch if you're aware of this. CREATURE is the better film with a few genuine shocks and interesting technology while ZOMBIES seems a dry run for Cahn's cult classic INVISIBLE INVADERS a few years later.To add to the fun Sony has thrown in trailers, a 1930s Columbia comedy short, and even a Mister Magoo cartoon. All the materials are beautifully transferred and you can't beat the price for what you get. Just like the drive-ins were in real life. Too bad they're a thing of the past but with this set you can certainly get a feel for what it was like.

1094609,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000UAFDR0,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 3]","Sam Katzman (1901-1973) began his film career on Hollywood's ""poverty row,"" working as an independent producer selling low budget genre films to Monogram Studios.  He was prolific and he stayed within budget, so it wasn't long before he was at Columbia, where he continued in the same vein but with slightly better budgets and somewhat longer shooting schedules.  In the 1960s he would move to MGM, where found himself grinding out films for the likes of Elvis Presley, but although he had a long career, and although his movies typically did well at the box office, he was essentially a ""B"" movie producer--and when he did have the chance to work with large budgets and big stars at MGM he found he didn't like it.Most of the movies Katzman produced were forgotten almost as soon as the audience left the theatre, but four of his horror movies have developed a cult following of sorts: THE GIANT CLAW, CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN, ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, and THE WEREWOLF.  All were filmed in the mid-to-late 1950s, with THE GIANT CLAW infamous for its terrible special effects.  Directed by Fred F. Sears--one of Katzman's favorite directors; he also directed ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK and THE WEREWOLF--the film has a good pace and a reasonable cast, but it also has one of the most ridiculous monsters ever to hit the screen: a bird from outer space that looks something like Phyllis Diller without a wig.  According to leading man Jeff Morrow, audiences laughed so much at the premier that he quietly slipped out a side door before he could be recognized.If THE GIANT CLAW might be regarded as a ""C"" or ""D"" or even ""F"" movie, the other three films in this four pack are solid ""B.""  CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is directed by Edward L. Cahn, creator of IT! THE TERROR FROM FROM BEYOND SPACE.  With Richard Denning heading the cast, it offers a tale of a killer bent on revenge who teams with a semi-mad scientist to turn normal men into killing zombies.  Although it is probably best recalled for its blatant 1950s sexism, it plays out at a nice pace.  Much the same is also true of THE ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, also directed by Cahn and featuring Allison Hayes, best known for the cult classic ATTACK OF THE FIFTY FOOT WOMAN.  On this occasion, zombies protect diamonds in Africa--and although the movie doesn't show a single black person in the entire continent, it clips along nicely.And then there is THE WEREWOLF, directed by Fred F. Sears, and which is almost as awful as Sear's THE GIANT CLAW.  In this little ditty, the wolfman is the product of scientific experiment by two evil doctors, whose radioactive injections have turned an innocent bystander into a wolfman killer on the prowl.  The transformation scenes are unsuccessful, to be generous about it; the story and script are tedious; and the cast, particularly werewolf Steven Ritch, is notable for lack of interest.  The whole thing is singularly ho-hum.Now, some people like 1950s ""B"" movies and some do not.  If you are among those who do, you'll likely enjoy this four pack.  The prints are extremely good, almost pristine, and the sound is very good as well.  Recommended for fans of the genre, just be away that only fans of the genre are likely to any of them.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Mixed Bag of 1950s Low-Budget Horror,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3248,"['Sam', 'Katzman', '1901-1973', 'began', 'film', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'poverty', 'row', 'working', 'independent', 'producer', 'selling', 'low', 'budget', 'genre', 'films', 'Monogram', 'Studios', 'was', 'prolific', 'stayed', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'was', 'Columbia', 'where', 'continued', 'same', 'vein', 'slightly', 'better', 'budgets', 'somewhat', 'longer', 'shooting', 'schedules', '1960s', 'would', 'move', 'MGM', 'where', 'found', 'grinding', 'out', 'films', 'likes', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'movies', 'typically', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'essentially', 'B', 'movie', 'producer', 'when', 'did', 'have', 'chance', 'work', 'large', 'budgets', 'big', 'stars', 'MGM', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'it.Most', 'movies', 'Katzman', 'produced', 'were', 'forgotten', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'audience', 'left', 'theatre', 'four', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'developed', 'cult', 'following', 'sorts', 'GIANT', 'CLAW', 'CREATURE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ATOM', 'BRAIN', 'ZOMBIES', 'OF', 'MORA', 'TAU', 'WEREWOLF', 'were', 'filmed', 'mid-to-late', '1950s', 'THE', 'GIANT', 'CLAW', 'infamous', 'terrible', 'special', 'effects', 'Directed', 'Fred', 'F.', 'Sears', 'one', 'Katzman', 'favorite', 'directors', 'also', 'directed', 'ROCK', 'AROUND', 'THE', 'CLOCK', 'THE', 'WEREWOLF', 'film', 'good', 'pace', 'reasonable', 'cast', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'monsters', 'ever', 'hit', 'screen', 'bird', 'outer', 'space', 'something', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'wig', 'According', 'leading', 'man', 'Jeff', 'Morrow', 'audiences', 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'premier', 'quietly', 'slipped', 'out', 'side', 'door', 'could', 'be', 'recognized.If', 'THE', 'GIANT', 'CLAW', 'might', 'be', 'regarded', 'C', 'D', 'even', 'F', 'movie', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'four', 'pack', 'are', 'solid', 'B', 'CREATURE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ATOM', 'BRAIN', 'directed', 'Edward', 'L.', 'Cahn', 'creator', 'IT', 'THE', 'TERROR', 'FROM', 'FROM', 'BEYOND', 'SPACE', 'Richard', 'Denning', 'heading', 'cast', 'tale', 'killer', 'bent', 'revenge', 'who', 'semi-mad', 'scientist', 'turn', 'normal', 'men', 'killing', 'zombies', 'probably', 'best', 'recalled', 'blatant', '1950s', 'sexism', 'out', 'nice', 'pace', 'same', 'also', 'true', 'THE', 'ZOMBIES', 'OF', 'MORA', 'TAU', 'also', 'directed', 'Cahn', 'featuring', 'Allison', 'Hayes', 'best', 'known', 'cult', 'classic', 'ATTACK', 'THE', 'FIFTY', 'FOOT', 'WOMAN', 'occasion', 'zombies', 'protect', 'diamonds', 'Africa', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'single', 'black', 'person', 'entire', 'continent', 'along', 'nicely.And', 'then', 'WEREWOLF', 'directed', 'Fred', 'F.', 'Sears', 'almost', 'as', 'awful', 'Sear', 'THE', 'GIANT', 'CLAW', 'little', 'ditty', 'wolfman', 'product', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'two', 'evil', 'doctors', 'radioactive', 'injections', 'have', 'turned', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'wolfman', 'killer', 'prowl', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'are', 'unsuccessful', 'be', 'generous', 'story', 'script', 'are', 'tedious', 'cast', 'particularly', 'werewolf', 'Steven', 'Ritch', 'notable', 'lack', 'interest', 'whole', 'thing', 'singularly', 'ho-hum.Now', 'people', '1950s', 'B', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'are', 'who', 'do', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'four', 'pack', 'prints', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'almost', 'pristine', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Recommended', 'fans', 'genre', 'just', 'be', 'away', 'only', 'fans', 'genre', 'are', 'likely', 'them.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Icons of Horror Collection: Sam Katzman (The Giant Claw / Creature with the Atom Brain / Zombies of Mora Tau / The Werewolf)

As an example, I was watching ""The Werewolf"" last night and just could not BELIEVE the picture quality--I was floored, it literally looks brand new!  The prints of these movies shown on TV in the past have been downright murky--""Zombies of Mora Tau,"" in particular, always looked so foggy/hazy/grainy it was actually difficult to tell what was going on!  No longer--these prints are clear as a bell--and it's like seeing them with a new set of eyes!Sony, PLEASE keep up the good work, these ""Icons of Horror"" (and now ""Icons of Adventure"" -- equally awesome!) collections are really among the industry standards relating to transfer quality of older low-budget films which normally would have been overlooked--very impressive.

There is no blood and gore, no reeking viscera, and no severed body parts.  For example:In ""Creature with the Atom Brain"", when a remote-controlled, atom-powered dead man lifts his victim over his head to break the man's back - you see only the shadow of the event on the wall. . . .In ""The Giant Claw"", when the toothy, battleship-sized buzzard swoops down and snaps its maw closed on a helpless pilot suspended beneath his parachute - the action is so far away you can't see the gory details. . . .In ""Zombies of Mora Tau"", when a zombie breaks the neck of crewman Johnson - you only see the zombie pull Johnson into the dark waters, with his demise out-of-sight under water. . . .In ""The Werewolf"", when a man is threatened by a mugger, he changes into a werewolf, savagely lacerating the mugger's neck - this deadly event takes place out-of-sight in an alley. . . .Note:  The film with the most jumble of scientific jargon is ""Creature with the Atom Brain"".  The film wrongly references Faraday's famous frog experiment - it was actually Luigi Galvani's experiment: he found that a dead frog's leg muscle would twitch when sparked.Extras:""Mysterious Island, Episode 2 'Sinister Savages' "" (1951) - 16 minutes.  (A confusing chapter.)""Midnight Blunders"" (1936) - 17 minutes.

1094625,AST7UNIXVOAVA,B000UAFDR0,Mark Shanks,"[12, 12]","So, just who the heck is Sam Katzman, anyway? Most boomers will remember these flicks from late-night ""Creature Features"" or Saturday afternoons with Sir Graves Ghastly, but never associated them together, much less with a specific producer. But Katzman was an old hand by the time these were made. He was the man who got Johnny Weismuller out of the leopard skin and into the safari gear as ""Jungle Jim"". He's generally credited for coining the term ""beatnik"". He did the ""East Side Kids"" movies, including two with Bela Lugosi. He was also the producer for two early Ray Harryhausen flicks, ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" (with the lovable six-armed octopus) and ""Earth vs the Flying Saucers"". He even did a couple of Elvis pics: ""Harum Scarum"" and ""Kissin' Cousins"".These four are from 1955-1957. ""Creature with the Atom Brain"" (1955) has an ex-Nazi (wow, were these guys into *every*thing!) creating atomic-powered zombies, complete with glowing serum in their veins. These middle-aged creeps stalk their victims to help a typical crime lord take over the city. They're hard to spot, except for the flip-top skulls. Story by Curt Siodmak, who sure came a long way downhill from his brilliant ""I Walked with a Zombie"".The following year (and 10 movies later!), ""The Werewolf"" jumps out. No full moon needed here - he's a radioactive werewolf! (See a trend?) Poor guy gets in an auto wreck and some helpful docs fix him up with an experimental serum. You can guess the rest.....""Zombies of Mora Tau"" is certainly original - these zombies are amphibious! They're the remains of a ship's crew, guarding a treasure of diamonds in the underwater wreck. These dudes are the original ""Terminators"" - shooting, stabbing, or whapping them in the skull with a board: makes no difference, they keep a'comin'.And maybe the most (in)famous of all: ""The Giant Claw"", whose monster was so over-the-top ludicrous that it couldn't be featured on the film's poster. A giant, anti-matter, butt-ugly space buzzard from another galaxy! Play the ""Giant Claw"" drinking game at your own risk: every time someone says ""flying battleship"", it's down the hatch. May be extremely hazardous to your physical AND mental health.Most people of a ""certain age"" will remember one or more of these from their heyday on TV. In spite of three different directors and (at least) four writers, all have a goofiness factor that only Ed Wood comes close to. Earnest, fast-paced, and always entertaining, these are great reminders of the time when Hollywood was cranking out flicks at a frantic pace and wasn't totally dependant on mega-bucks blockbusters. The sets are usually claustrophobic, 75% of the film seems to take place at night or in pitch-black settings (except for ""Claw""), and the ""plots"" are beyond unbelievable.

""The Giant Claw"" and ""Zombies Of Mora Tau"" balance numbskull MST3K-style fun with moments of extreme boredom, but they're worth viewing. In all honesty, I wouldn't have purchased them as stand-alone movies, but as part of this set, it's no harm, no foul.The two undeniable classics are ""Creature With The Atom Brain"" and ""The Werewolf."" Too bad these films couldn't have been packaged on a single DVD, a laCult Classics: Earth vs. the Spider/War of the Colossal Beast. Still, the price is right, and so is Amazon...these two films are rich in the heritage of Universal's classic black & white monster films, and they bring in the added element of 50s paranoia. Both are incredibly atmospheric, the kind of films you can lose yourself in during a Saturday afternoon / evening ""Creature Features"" wave of nostalgia. TRUE fans of horror / sci-fi movies love the full spectrum, from the inept and lovable trash of Ed Wood's films to the mind-numbing creativity and spectacular cinematography of the Universal classics. These movies fall somewhere in between.I'd say that ""The Giant Claw"" and ""Zombies Of Mora Tau"" fall somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars, while ""Creature With The Atom Brain"" and ""The Werewolf"" are 5 stars all the way.

1094628,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B000UAFDR0,mrliteral,"[1, 2]","There's no getting around it:  the 1950s were not a great era for horror and science fiction films.  Yes, there are a few excellent movies, but for the most part, the genre was relegated to B-movie status, and even there, it was rarely treated with much respect.  Despite a lack of true quality, however, many of these movies can be fun to watch, even in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way.  The Sam Katzman - Icons of Horror Collection provides four such movies.Katzman was a B-movie producer and few of his films are really well-known.  In an era when the studios produced a lot more movies, many were quite forgettable, and Katzman's movies fit into that category.  Only a truly dedicated film fan would be able to recall the movies in this set.Creature with the Atom Brain is one of the horror films with a little bit of everything:  zombies, gangsters, radioactivity and Nazi scientists.  Written by Curt Siodmak (who created the modern werewolf with The Wolf Man), Creature deals with a gangster out for revenge against those who forced him into exile.  With the aid of the scientist, he is able to create zombie slaves of incredible strength.  Richard Denning (from The Creature From the Black Lagoon) is the earnest cop/scientist who, pipe always in hand, is out to stop the threat.  Although this movie has a little too much talk and not enough action, it does feature one of the most brutal murders of the Production Code era (and at the beginning of the movie, too).You can literally see the strings in The Giant Claw, a giant monster movie with a enormous alien bird terrorizing the world.  The science in this movie is around as flimsy as the effects, with the monster's invulnerability due to an antimatter shield and the eventual solution involving mesons (I won't spoil the ending in explaining how; actually I can't, since it is as ludicrous as everything else in this film.Zombies of Moro Tau is the one truly supernatural movie, with the undead protecting a stash of diamonds that are at the bottom of a river in a remote jungle.  Treasure hunters go after the gems, but nothing will stop these cursed creatures.  In the pre-Night of the Living Dead era, this slow-moving film is around par for the course for zombie films (although there have been good ones such as White Zombie and I Walked with a Zombie).The rather unimaginatively titled The Werewolf deals with a werewolf.  In this case, the hapless soul who's turned into a monster is a nice family man who was transformed by mad scientists.  He wreaks havoc in a small mountain town while the scientists pursue him; there's little in this film that hasn't appeared in dozens of other werewolf movies.Whether you enjoy these movies or not depends a lot on your mood.

1094629,AD44WZGK0FVHS,B000UAFDR0,Nightflyer,"[16, 16]","I am thrilled to have all these films on DVD at last, but the main reason I bought it was for THE WEREWOLF.  Opinions on the other films may differ (I personally think ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU is vastly underrated and is a great early entry in the zombie genre--it may seem silly now but it sure didn't then!), but few would deny that THE WEREWOLF is a terrific film.  I saw it when it first came out, double-billed with EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS.  I was 10 at the time, and had already seen all sorts of horror films, but none of them scared me.  My parents weren't sure I should see this film, but I insisted.  They were right--this movie scared the hell out of me, as no film had before or has since.  I had nightmares for weeks.I watched the film many times during the next 10 years, first at matinees, then on the late show (it used to be a staple of late-night horror broadcasts).  Then the film virtually disappeared, until recently when TCM showed it now and then.  Although the movie doesn't have quite the same impact on me today as it did when I was 10, I still think it's damn scary.  And now FINALLY it's available on DVD.Although the transformation scenes and the werewolf's appearance are frightening enough, the great things about this film are the acting (Steven Ritch in the title role gives a wonderful performance), the plot and script, and the location photography.  Also, it's one of the first films to combine horror with sci-fi.  And it's played straight--there's none of the silliness and self-parody that mars more recent entries in the werewolf genre.I urge everyone who loves werewolf movies to check this one out.

1094630,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B000UAFDR0,Otto Correct,"[6, 6]","This is an excellent set of 50's Sci-Fi and Horror B-movies.  ""Creature With The Atom Brain"" is fullscreen, the rest are in anamorphic widescreen, and all four movies look great!  They are practically flawless prints with great sound.  But how are the movies?  Here's my breakdown:THE GIANT CLAW:  One of the all time anti-classics in B-movie history, ""The Giant Claw"" tells the story of humanity fighting against a giant anti-matter space buzzard, which is one of the most gloriously goofy movie monsters ever made.  Its a giant marionette that looks like something Jim Henson woulda thought up were he on bad acid at the time.  The strings are always visible and the wings hardly ever move when flying.  Seeing this ridiculous puppet flop around a table trying to eat a toy train is the kind of thing that can convert a normal person into a crazed B-movie schlock lover.  A tremendously entertaining film, easily worth the price of the whole set.CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN:  Short movie (all of 69 minutes) that makes suprisingly good use of its non-existant budget.  A gangster finances a scientist's experiments to turn dead bodies into radio controlled zombies, then uses said zombies to seek revenge on those who crossed him.  The movie mixes those scenes with a police procedural as the authorities try to figure out whats going on.  You get an interesting, fast moving story with above average writing for a 50's cheapie, some fun hard-boiled detective dialogue, some really effective scare scenes (my wife got really creeped out when the zombie broke a guys back in the opening scene), and a news reporter named Dick Cutting!  Seriously, Dick Cutting!  I kept waiting for an emergency broadcast to happen then for a voice to say ""We now return you to Dick Cutting.""  I liked this movie more than I thought I would, it was really fun.ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU:  A group of treasure hunters seeking some diamonds lost in a shipwreck encounter the zombified crew of the wreck guarding them!  A fairly original idea, but they could've used a little makeup on the zombies, its kinda weird to see two women screaming with terror at what, by all appearances, is just a guy who's a little damp.  This movie starts great, but doesn't really know how to end and just kinda peters out.  Still, its fun enough, and the underwater scenes are kinda interesting considering that none of them were actually filmed underwater.THE WEREWOLF:  Interesting Werewolf tale, as the monster in question here was the victim of a science experiment gone wrong, not of a gypsy's curse.  Great location shooting, good moodiness, the werewolf in question is very troubled and overacts his pathos quite well, but like ""Zombies..."" it also kinda peters out instead of ending dynamically.  Still, the first two acts are great, and make for a fun movie.Tons of fun for the B-movie fan, these films are all more entertaining than they could've been.  The extras are great too, as one disc contains a comedy short and a Mr. Magoo cartoon, and the other has a part of a serial, so if you watch the shorts first, then the two movies on either disc, you've just re-created what they'd do for drive-in double features!",5,"Great films, excellent set!",1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,3183,"['excellent', 'set', '50', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'B-movies', 'Creature', 'Atom', 'Brain', 'fullscreen', 'rest', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'four', 'movies', 'look', 'great', 'are', 'practically', 'flawless', 'prints', 'great', 'sound', 'how', 'are', 'movies', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'GIANT', 'CLAW', 'One', 'time', 'anti-classics', 'B-movie', 'history', 'Giant', 'Claw', 'story', 'humanity', 'fighting', 'giant', 'anti-matter', 'space', 'buzzard', 'one', 'most', 'gloriously', 'goofy', 'movie', 'monsters', 'ever', 'made', 'giant', 'marionette', 'something', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'woulda', 'thought', 'up', 'were', 'bad', 'acid', 'time', 'strings', 'are', 'always', 'visible', 'wings', 'hardly', 'ever', 'move', 'when', 'flying', 'Seeing', 'ridiculous', 'puppet', 'flop', 'table', 'trying', 'eat', 'toy', 'train', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'convert', 'normal', 'person', 'crazed', 'B-movie', 'schlock', 'lover', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'film', 'easily', 'price', 'whole', 'set.CREATURE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ATOM', 'BRAIN', 'Short', 'movie', '69', 'minutes', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'use', 'non-existant', 'budget', 'gangster', 'scientist', 'experiments', 'turn', 'dead', 'bodies', 'radio', 'controlled', 'zombies', 'then', 'said', 'zombies', 'seek', 'revenge', 'who', 'crossed', 'movie', 'mixes', 'scenes', 'police', 'procedural', 'authorities', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'whats', 'going', 'get', 'interesting', 'fast', 'moving', 'story', 'above', 'average', 'writing', '50', 'cheapie', 'fun', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'dialogue', 'really', 'effective', 'scare', 'scenes', 'wife', 'got', 'really', 'creeped', 'out', 'when', 'zombie', 'broke', 'guys', 'back', 'opening', 'scene', 'news', 'reporter', 'named', 'Dick', 'Cutting', 'Seriously', 'Dick', 'Cutting', 'kept', 'waiting', 'emergency', 'broadcast', 'happen', 'then', 'voice', 'say', 'now', 'return', 'Dick', 'Cutting', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'was', 'really', 'fun.ZOMBIES', 'OF', 'MORA', 'TAU', 'group', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'seeking', 'diamonds', 'lost', 'shipwreck', 'encounter', 'zombified', 'crew', 'wreck', 'guarding', 'fairly', 'original', 'idea', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'little', 'makeup', 'zombies', 'kinda', 'weird', 'see', 'two', 'women', 'screaming', 'terror', 'what', 'appearances', 'just', 'guy', 'who', 'little', 'damp', 'movie', 'great', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'end', 'just', 'kinda', 'peters', 'out', 'Still', 'fun', 'enough', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'are', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'considering', 'none', 'were', 'actually', 'filmed', 'underwater.THE', 'WEREWOLF', 'Interesting', 'Werewolf', 'tale', 'monster', 'question', 'here', 'was', 'victim', 'science', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'not', 'gypsy', 'curse', 'Great', 'location', 'shooting', 'good', 'moodiness', 'werewolf', 'question', 'very', 'troubled', 'pathos', 'quite', 'well', 'Zombies', 'also', 'kinda', 'peters', 'out', 'instead', 'ending', 'dynamically', 'Still', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'are', 'great', 'make', 'fun', 'movie.Tons', 'fun', 'B-movie', 'fan', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'entertaining', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'one', 'disc', 'comedy', 'short', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'cartoon', 'other', 'part', 'serial', 'so', 'watch', 'shorts', 'first', 'then', 'two', 'movies', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'just', 're-created', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'drive-in', 'double', 'features']",Icons of Horror Collection: Sam Katzman (The Giant Claw / Creature with the Atom Brain / Zombies of Mora Tau / The Werewolf)

I'd never seen ""Atom Brain"", but have been looking for the other 3 on DVD for a long time. Anyone who knows schlock horror MUST love Jeff Morrow, Allison Hayes & Richard Denning. The Werewolf is especially good for it's sweet simplicity; really a sad film about stuff that happens which is out of our control. The Giant Claw is terrific, with Mr. Morrow's customary over-acting and a big bird on strings. Atom Brain is OK, but was done better in ""Indestructible Man"" with the most under-rated Lon Chaney, Jr. My favorite is Zombies of Mora Tau, an absolutely riotous display of silly mixed with a reasonably good plot, with good characters. The beautiful Autumn Russell shines here; wonder whatever happened to her... I guess you had to be there at the outset, to REALLY enjoy these films. Make popcorn, turn out lghts and enjoy how black & white films can be effective.

Steven Ritch portrays Duncan Marsh, a family man injected by an unscrupulous doctor experimenting with a serum derived from wolves resulting in horrific consequences for Marsh, his family, and anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. The film succeeds because all of the central characters are well written, engaging, and well acted by a fine cast as the story unfolds taking its time in presenting it's truly frightening werewolf.  Moreover,this film is an interesting combination of a traditional supernatural subject with a science fiction angle popular in 50s films.

For me 'The Giant Claw' is now my favorite to watch because of the ridiculousness of the creature and the terrible miniatures. The first time I saw this flick I was with a friend and wasn't really paying attention, but it is a riot! I consider the other films to be a bit more serious and horror-like. 'Creatures With The Atom Brain' and 'Zombies Of Mora Tau' are both from the zombie genre, but 'Creatures' adds a lot of other horror / sci-fi clich&eacute;s. 'Mora Tau' is a slower film, but worth watching for the occasionally water logged living dead. 'The Werewolf' could stand toe to toe with most werewolf movies that came before and after it. This time the creature is a product of science instead of the supernatural. My friend who is a werewolf movie fanatic loved this 50s gem and so did I. Every movie here is worth watching any number of times and you will discover something special with each viewing. Sam Katzman was a genius of the B-movie scene and the pictures presented on this box set have never looked better!

But then again, these newer viewers will never know of that magical time when these flicks were lighting up the huge screens in Movie Palaces and Drive-In theaters throughout the country.It will be the true enthusiasts of this genre who will see this set as a home run, especially at these prices.

CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is a fairly good movie and the second best one of the four.  ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU has a good cast of B-movie regulars but a rather average plot.  Which brings us to THE GIANT CLAW, which is really not a bad film if you can get past the rather stupid-looking flying monster.  The actors try hard but the Japanese did the flying creature much better in RODAN!  Perfect film to watch on Thanksgiving to go along with eating your turkey dinner.  DVD has the trailers to all the films plus a few extra ones.  Nice mix of 50's werewolf (the makeup looks very much like the werewolf in the Bela Lugosi film RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE), zombies and cheesy special effects.
