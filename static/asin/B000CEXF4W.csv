I didn't hesitate to purchase it because I had previously had it on tape which eventually wore out.It's a charming and heart felt story of a young girl who survives the Russian Revolution and the death of most of her family.  You will become enamored with the storyline and the joys and hardships of Zoya growing from a young girl into the matriarch of her children and grand daughter.Don't think twice about purchasing this lovely story.  You won't be disappointed.,5,One of the best Danielle Steel novels brought to the screen,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,592,"[""'d"", 'been', 'waiting', 'find', 'Zoya', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'see', 'listed', 'found', 'quite', 'accident', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'purchase', 'had', 'previously', 'had', 'tape', 'eventually', 'wore', 'charming', 'heart', 'felt', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'death', 'most', 'family', 'will', 'become', 'enamored', 'storyline', 'joys', 'hardships', 'Zoya', 'growing', 'young', 'girl', 'matriarch', 'children', 'grand', 'daughter.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'purchasing', 'lovely', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Danielle Steel's Zoya: Parts 1-2

I think Sasha and Zoya have a good relationship with each other until her father Clayton has died which was very sad to her especially her mother Zoya which Sasha does not think her mother is thinking about him and also when her mother has found second love with Simon Hirsch. I think she is acting so rebelious because of Simon Hirsch and Matthew coming between their relationship with them and also does not spend enough time with her because of him and her work. Also when Zoya have to raise her grandchild, opens up her own store, retires from working at her store and also returns to her hometown with her granddaughter Zoe at the end of the film. The sad part of the movie is when her brother Nicky along with her parents has dies in the war in Russia, she and her grandmother Evengia has moved to Paris to lived there during the war and also tries to arrange marriage to Zoya to marry Vladimir which she does not love and also is a good friend to her and her grandmother. Also I did like it when she quit her night job as a stripper and worked at the department store to support her children. It was sad when she has to raise them alone when Clayton has died. She had to sell everything to pay off the debts and she and her children had to life in an apartment which was on fire. Sasha has adored her father a lot and she thinks her mother does not love him or pay any attention to her because of her second love with Simon Hirsch which she hates very much and also became very rebellious because of that. When she works at the Ballet Russe in Paris a ballerina and also meets her first love which is Captain Clayton Andrews and falls very deeply in love with him for the first time which her grandmother does not approve, also when her uncle Feodor has died, when she and Clayton marry and moves to America after the death of her grandmother also when her daughter Sasha dies in a car accident & has to raise her granddaughter, Zoe, when she and her children were in the fire also survived it and their dog Sava has died in the fire which was very sad and also saved their lives and also when Zoya works at night as a stripper for her and her children can survive and also gets a job at a local dress store. Also at the end of the movie Zoya has retired from the store& also returns to her hometown St. Petersburg,Russia with her granddaughter, Zoe.Danielle Steel Zoya along with Changes, Safe Harbour, Fine Things, Family Album, Jewels, Daddy, Once in a Lifetime and Remembrance are ten of my most favorite movies to watch on DVD which I have and they are my soap operas and I watch them as often as I can especially the full lengths ones which are Zoya, Fine Things, Jewels and family Album on special holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve.",5,Danielle Steel Zoya,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,3028,"['movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'real', 'couples', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'portraying', 'very', 'own', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'most', 'favorite', 'actors', 'arein', 'movie', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Philip', 'Casnoff', 'think', 'Sasha', 'Zoya', 'have', 'good', 'relationship', 'other', 'father', 'Clayton', 'died', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'especially', 'mother', 'Zoya', 'Sasha', 'not', 'think', 'mother', 'thinking', 'also', 'when', 'mother', 'found', 'second', 'love', 'Simon', 'Hirsch', 'think', 'acting', 'so', 'rebelious', 'Simon', 'Hirsch', 'Matthew', 'coming', 'relationship', 'also', 'not', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'work', 'Also', 'when', 'Zoya', 'have', 'raise', 'grandchild', 'up', 'own', 'store', 'working', 'store', 'also', 'returns', 'hometown', 'granddaughter', 'Zoe', 'end', 'film', 'sad', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'brother', 'Nicky', 'parents', 'dies', 'war', 'Russia', 'grandmother', 'Evengia', 'moved', 'Paris', 'lived', 'there', 'war', 'also', 'arrange', 'marriage', 'Zoya', 'marry', 'Vladimir', 'not', 'love', 'also', 'good', 'friend', 'grandmother', 'Also', 'did', 'like', 'when', 'quit', 'night', 'job', 'stripper', 'worked', 'department', 'store', 'support', 'children', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'raise', 'alone', 'when', 'Clayton', 'died', 'had', 'sell', 'everything', 'pay', 'off', 'debts', 'children', 'had', 'life', 'apartment', 'was', 'fire', 'Sasha', 'adored', 'father', 'lot', 'mother', 'not', 'love', 'pay', 'attention', 'second', 'love', 'Simon', 'Hirsch', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'became', 'very', 'rebellious', 'When', 'Ballet', 'Russe', 'Paris', 'ballerina', 'also', 'first', 'love', 'Captain', 'Clayton', 'Andrews', 'very', 'deeply', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'grandmother', 'not', 'approve', 'also', 'when', 'uncle', 'Feodor', 'died', 'when', 'Clayton', 'marry', 'moves', 'America', 'death', 'grandmother', 'also', 'when', 'daughter', 'Sasha', 'car', 'accident', 'raise', 'granddaughter', 'Zoe', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'fire', 'also', 'survived', 'dog', 'Sava', 'died', 'fire', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'also', 'saved', 'lives', 'also', 'when', 'Zoya', 'night', 'stripper', 'children', 'can', 'survive', 'also', 'job', 'local', 'dress', 'store', 'Also', 'end', 'movie', 'Zoya', 'retired', 'store', 'also', 'hometown', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Russia', 'granddaughter', 'Zoe.Danielle', 'Steel', 'Zoya', 'Changes', 'Safe', 'Harbour', 'Fine', 'Things', 'Family', 'Album', 'Jewels', 'Daddy', 'Once', 'Lifetime', 'Remembrance', 'are', 'ten', 'most', 'favorite', 'movies', 'watch', 'DVD', 'have', 'are', 'soap', 'operas', 'watch', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'especially', 'full', 'lengths', 'ones', 'are', 'Zoya', 'Fine', 'Things', 'Jewels', 'family', 'Album', 'special', 'holidays', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve']",Danielle Steel's Zoya: Parts 1-2

It is near mint condition and I got it under $40.00 and this was a great find. Only issue I had was the DVD was not on the holder in the case.
