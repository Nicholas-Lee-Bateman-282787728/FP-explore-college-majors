The dot com bubble had burst but nobody new how bad things were going to get with September 11 just around the corner. Hartnett is quite convincing in the role and I enjoyed it to an extent, although it dragged in places. I wasn't sorry to see this arrogant young man brought undone, and I liked the irony of the Buddha statue which he gave to his parents as a gift from the company. He is forced to let go of everything he's built shortly after on his own way towards wisdom and enlightenment.",3,Okay,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,583,"['thing', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'captured', 'spirit', 'times', 'dot', 'com', 'bubble', 'had', 'burst', 'nobody', 'new', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'September', '11', 'just', 'corner', 'Hartnett', 'quite', 'convincing', 'role', 'enjoyed', 'extent', 'dragged', 'places', 'was', ""n't"", 'sorry', 'see', 'arrogant', 'young', 'man', 'brought', 'undone', 'liked', 'irony', 'Buddha', 'statue', 'gave', 'parents', 'gift', 'company', 'forced', 'let', 'go', 'everything', 'built', 'shortly', 'own', 'way', 'towards', 'wisdom', 'enlightenment']",August

Josh Hartnett deserved a best actor nomination and I am not exaggerating.  This movie is about the problems a small business sees during the post 9/11 era.  Josh Hartnett is outstanding as a business owner facing the facts that his business is failing.  He's partners with his brother, and the brother tries to get Josh to face the reality that they need to sell the company and get out.  Josh is reluctant at first, but he soon starts to realize that his brother has a family to support, and the business was failing.

1156437,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00177YA74,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 13]","Austin Chick's second feature since ""XX/XY"" @ Sundance is like the dot-com metaphor about which the film tells its story.  It's a disaster.  Josh Hartnett who looked good in even the turkeyLucky Number Slevin (Widescreen Edition)and really good inThe Black Dahlia (Widescreen Edition)by Brian DePalma gives a paper-thin performance about a self-centered jerk who risks his family for pride.  At one point, Tom is leaving the office to an important business conference & has apparently not bathed.  He changes shirts, smells his armpit, wrinkles his nose, puts on a fresh shirt, and heads out the door.  Will someone please give the stinky man a washcloth?  Dorothy Parker once wrote about Katherine Hepburn on Broadway that she covered all the emotions ""from A to B.""  This about describes the level of dejection that Hartnett is able to reach.Adam Scott who was inKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)in 2007,Monster-in-Law (New Line Platinum Series)in 2005 &The Aviator (Two-Disc Special Edition)in 2004 looks the best as Tom's brother Joshua who has a new baby and must place concerns for his family above his brother's business needs to raid his bank account.  Scott reaches an excellent level of anxiety as he tries to evade his brother, but ultimately loves him even in failure.Naomie Harris from ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2 & 3"" and ""Miami Vice"" does fairly well in a thin role as the object of the affections Tom Sterling can spare on anyone but himself.  Rip Torn who has a lone supporting Oscar nomination for ""Cross Creek"" in 1983 is a bit over the top as his father David.  Caroline Lagerfelt who was in ""Minority Report"" and works sporadically did well as the mother who can't quite keep her grown family together.  David Bowie's appearance is brief, but he looks good.The best thing about this film is its look.  The cinematography and the wild nightclub look suit the story well.  I also liked the black and white photography on the cover of the DVD.  The big problem with the film is that the protagonist Tom Sterling is not likeable so when he fails we really don't care.  Boy creates business; boy is a creep; boy loses business, end credits.

I think this is one of the first films to really show his diversity. The man can act! I think that down the road we're gonna look back on this film as the turning point in his career - the point at which he starts working on more than just big/predictable Hollywood films. I heard he's now acting on the London on the live-stage version of Rain Man. The film has a really good story about the dot com crash back in 2001 - which is really appropriate with what's going on with the stock market right now.

1156440,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00177YA74,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","In ""August,"" Josh Hartnett plays a cocky, twenty-something entrepreneur named Tom Sterling who, for the past several years (the movie is set, rather portentously, in August 2001), has been riding the dot.com wave to easy fame and fortune - though he isn't quite prepared, either financially or emotionally, for the crash that is to come.  Landshark, the company he founded with his brother, Joshua (Adam Scott), and of which he is currently CEO, has a couple hundred employees on its payroll, but pretty much everyone who works there is at a loss to explain just what it is the firm does or produces.  Even worse, the company that was once valued at well over three-and-a-half million dollars is now worth just a paltry fraction of that amount, the ""business model"" having apparently failed to pan out as expected.As written by Howard A. Rodman and directed by Austin Chick, ""August"" is essentially a cautionary tale set against the get-rich-quick hysteria that came to dominate in the early days of the internet, when virtually anybody with a half-baked idea and a smidgen of techno-savviness could become a high-stakes player on Wall Street.  That many of these people were making their fortunes out of little more than the cyber equivalent of chewing gum and bailing wire - while producing nothing of any real substance or value in the long run - is what eventually led to disaster for so many of them and for the economy as a whole.""August"" does a reasonably effective job capturing the moral emptiness and emotional shallowness of the characters and the world they inhabit, but, when all is said and done, the movie lacks the dramatic heft and focus needed to turn it into a profound and major work.  The minor characters are bland and insufficiently developed, and even Tom is deficient in the kind of depth and shading he would need to make him a representative ""tragic hero"" for our time. That being said, the movie does offer some intriguing insights into the way the business world works these days and into which type of individual typically succeeds in the new arena.

I don't know why but i always like to look at the bad reviews first and then take a look at the good ones. I decided to buy it because Josh Hartnett is one of my favorite actors.After I watched the movie I was really impressed with everything.  The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that I never really did find out what Land-shark does as a company.  It struck me as a little depressing but it also has some real in it.  I am sure this type of thing happened to so many dot com start ups back in those days that its not even funny.  Someone who had no status at all starts a dot com and it blows up and they get WAY more money then they should have ever got and then everything falls apart because they don't know how to manage all of there success.  I am sure this happened to so many people so when i was watching this i couldn't help but think of all that.The bottom line is that this was a really good movie if you are into this kind of thing.  I don't like how some people just ""Dog"" this movie and talk down on it because I thought it was really good.  I would recommend it only to those who are into this kind of movie.And I would only ask that if you found this review helpful in your decision to purchase this item that you could click the button and let me know.

1156442,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B00177YA74,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[13, 18]","I had wondered when a mainstream film would attempt to show the business sector just prior to 9/11, and this was advertised to be it - all the way down to the month name in the title. By itself August would mean nothing in a title unless it had something to do with what changes the world a couple weeks later.The casting choices also peaked my interest with David Bowie, Rip Torn, Chirqui and Naomie Harris. Josh Hartnett plays the CEO of an Internet company going through significant financial troubles. He plays the front of the future being extremely bright and everything being OK, even though his company should have been folding yesterday. Especially once the mandated recovery deadline of September 14th passes, the world should be his oyster. With them actually mentioning an important date for their company, I thought the film might go that far chronologically, but they do not.The story starts right out in the high gear Hartnett's character plays most of the film, but it quickly dissipates into boring subplots, tons of unanswered questions, and eventually really bad acting. Even Torn's performance was staged (on purpose I guess since he is way better than this). The one saving grace comes towards the end with David Bowie's three minutes on screen; he was very believable as the hostile takeover kind of guy. But he vanishes and the film comes to an ambiguous ending that never even alludes to the upcoming destruction. It just fades to black and you realize you just wasted 90 minutes. They do interject one CGI shot of the twin towers, but nothing else ties together to the title relevance.Hartnett is adequate, but his upcoming role in I Come With the Rain looks significantly more challenging and productive. Chirqui's role was for two scenes, and Torn for just a few minutes.
