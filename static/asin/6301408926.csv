Excellent use of humor as well -- everyone should use humor. Powerful characters, spot-on performances, moving stories.  I immediately felt this was filmed entirely on location, and I was right.  It also felt like cheap hand-held cameras were used to capture the reality without glossing over it, so you can see the color and the beauty but also the seedy underneath at the same time.  Such seeming contradictions are India.  In the hands of tihs filmmaker, Bombay becomes a character too.  The credits said 52 locations in 52 days, I think, so I'm sticking to my impression of cheap hand-held cameras.  The movie is simply perfect.  My attempts to predict the plot failed, and yet the plot unfolded so naturally from the characters that it isn't ""plotted"" at all.

That was a movie on a certain kind of new India, a new India that unfortunately still does not touch many in that country. For many Indians life is still what you will find in Salaam Bombay, or a bit better, maybe. This movie is grim, grey, hopeless. This is the grim story of a boy abandoned to himself, without reasons, by the traveling circus he is working for. He will end up doing odd jobs in a Bombay brothel, where he will slowly but stobbornly save the money he needs to go back home. But don't expect a happy ending, because this movie is about despair, and life in a place where the only certainty is abuse.

251568,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301408926,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","A film I did not expect to hit me as it did, `Salaam Bombay' is a small yet impressive feature that details a tragic slice of culture we may not be wholly aware of.  Mira Nair directs her debut feature with sincerity and passion and drags out of every frame the angst, grit and honesty needed to compel each and every viewer, not just those directly affected by the film's core focus.The film follows a young boy named Krishna who is sent off into the world on his own at the ripe old age of eleven by his mother after he breaks something belonging to his brother and costing 500 rupees.  He is told not to come home until he has the money to pay for it.  Instead of joining the circus, Krishna flees to Bombay where he joins a gang of homeless children and comes under the wing of a drug addicted man who befriends Krishna.  Working for mere pennies, Krishna is saving so that he can go home, but the people that come in and out of his life threaten his foreseeable future.What Mira Nair does here is remarkable; giving us such a straightforward and honest look at the lives lived by those on the streets.  Taking these characters and making them feel hardened and true, we can feel them under our skin.  Whether they are prostitutes, pimps, addicts, dealers or the children caught in their wake, these people are real people (most of the extras and even the film's star were from the streets) and their fragility seeps into every frame.  It is impossible to not be moved by this tremendous film, filled to the brim with social relevance no matter what side of the world you're from.",5,Real world issues brought forth with grit and honesty...,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1584,"['film', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'hit', 'did', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'small', 'yet', 'impressive', 'feature', 'details', 'tragic', 'slice', 'culture', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wholly', 'aware', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'debut', 'feature', 'sincerity', 'passion', 'frame', 'angst', 'grit', 'honesty', 'needed', 'compel', 'viewer', 'not', 'just', 'directly', 'affected', 'film', 'core', 'focus.The', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Krishna', 'who', 'sent', 'off', 'world', 'own', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', 'eleven', 'mother', 'something', 'belonging', 'brother', 'costing', '500', 'rupees', 'told', 'not', 'come', 'home', 'money', 'pay', 'Instead', 'joining', 'circus', 'Krishna', 'Bombay', 'where', 'gang', 'homeless', 'children', 'wing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'man', 'who', 'Krishna', 'Working', 'mere', 'pennies', 'Krishna', 'saving', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'people', 'come', 'life', 'threaten', 'foreseeable', 'future.What', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'here', 'remarkable', 'giving', 'such', 'straightforward', 'honest', 'look', 'lives', 'lived', 'streets', 'Taking', 'characters', 'making', 'feel', 'hardened', 'true', 'can', 'feel', 'skin', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'pimps', 'addicts', 'dealers', 'children', 'caught', 'wake', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'most', 'extras', 'even', 'film', 'star', 'were', 'streets', 'fragility', 'seeps', 'frame', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'tremendous', 'film', 'filled', 'brim', 'social', 'relevance', 'matter', 'what', 'side', 'world', ""'re""]",Salaam Bombay VHS

Erland,"[1, 1]","Note: The film is presented in Hindi with English, Spanish and French subtitles.The 1998 film `Salaam Bombay' weaves a heartbreaking tale that is lived out everyday by many children living in the alleys and sidewalks of Bombay. They do what they must to stay alive as they move amongst drug addicts and dealers, pimps and prostitutes and anyone else who might wish to exploit them.Director Mira Nair does a masterful job at capturing the angst, loneliness, and loss of innocence of those referred to as ""the flowers that never open"". How appropriate, and sad but true. These are lives without hopes and dreams, their fate is nothing more than a struggle for survival. She should also be commended for not sugar coating the plight of the disenfranchised youth by wrapping up the storyline in a happy ending to lighten the overall mood of the film and make it more commercial. It's obvious she had a message to deliver and I congratulate her on her success.If there is any fault with this film it might be found in what I call the watch-ability factor.

251570,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6301408926,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[17, 18]","Wow, what a tremendous story of innocence lost, of the anonymity of the powerless poor in the big city, and of the global theme of vices that trap such lost souls and suck them dry.  This is a monumental film that touched me on so many levels that I can't put it all into words.Almost the entire film takes place on the streets of Bombay, far from the ""Bollywood"" silliness of musical melodrama that we in the US usually associate with Indian cinema.  These are runaways, prostitutes, junkies, and thieves, but director Mira Nair refuses to treat any of them as props or cliches, showing them as nothing less than fully fleshed human beings.  The lead character is an innocent little boy who finds himself thrust into this world, and he becomes closest to two equally innocent young girls who are also on the verge of being swallowed up by the filth around them.  Their journey through these few weeks is heartbreaking and chilling, and the ending will stay with you for quite some time.Mira Nair has gone on to direct several feature films, including Indian-American productions like ""Mississippi Masala"" with Denzel Washington, but this is far more realized than that one, partly because the characters are more real and partly because the story is much more perfectly and completely told.  In ""Salaam Bombay!"" the actors are mostly street people, several of them so malnourished it hurts to look at them.  The realism of the players reflects the unblinking realism of the story, ultimately condemning the situation while celebrating the humanity of the people involved.This film should be required viewing for anyone who says they like movies.",5,A rose in the gutter,1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,1646,"['Wow', 'what', 'tremendous', 'story', 'innocence', 'lost', 'anonymity', 'powerless', 'poor', 'big', 'city', 'global', 'theme', 'vices', 'trap', 'such', 'lost', 'souls', 'suck', 'dry', 'monumental', 'film', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'streets', 'Bombay', 'far', 'Bollywood', 'silliness', 'musical', 'melodrama', 'US', 'usually', 'associate', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'are', 'runaways', 'prostitutes', 'junkies', 'thieves', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'treat', 'props', 'cliches', 'showing', 'nothing', 'less', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'human', 'beings', 'lead', 'character', 'innocent', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'thrust', 'world', 'closest', 'two', 'equally', 'innocent', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'verge', 'being', 'swallowed', 'up', 'filth', 'journey', 'few', 'weeks', 'heartbreaking', 'chilling', 'ending', 'will', 'stay', 'quite', 'time.Mira', 'Nair', 'gone', 'direct', 'several', 'feature', 'films', 'including', 'Indian-American', 'productions', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'far', 'more', 'realized', 'one', 'partly', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'real', 'partly', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'perfectly', 'completely', 'told', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'street', 'people', 'several', 'so', 'malnourished', 'look', 'realism', 'players', 'unblinking', 'realism', 'story', 'ultimately', 'condemning', 'situation', 'celebrating', 'humanity', 'people', 'involved.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies']",Salaam Bombay VHS
251571,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6301408926,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[9, 10]","Salaam Bombay, the critically acclaimed, award-winning film debut, for director and producer, Mira Nair, lives on as a timeless ode to the poverty, hopelessness and tragedy of young street kids, and other residents of the ghettos of Bombay (now Mumbai), India.  Nair clearly did her research, for this film, manages to bring out stunningly powerful acting in her young actors (particularly, the lead actor, Shafiq Sayed, as Krishna), and leaves us with haunting and cautionary imagery of the sad reality of street life.Krishna is a young, uneducated Indian boy, from a small village, who ventures out into Bombay, via train, when he must repay 500 rupees to his family, for reasons that aren't clear to us.  He ends up in the one of the poorest, most desolate sections of town, amongst the street urchins and prostitutes.  What start out as a transitional living space, for him, and lifestyle (as he makes his money, selling chai), becomes all the more permanent and--ultimately--impossible.  He encounters Chillum, a drugdealer he befriends, who starts out as an ally, but whose character and relationship to him changes overtime.  He also meets Manju, the daughter of a prostitute, so young and, yet, already so exposed to the darker side of life.As the film progresses, we forget that these children are acting, and this is a recreation of real-life events.  It is amazing, thought-provoking and ultimately heartbreaking......This was only the beginning, for Nair, who has gone on to have a remarkable and brilliant body of work...",5,a brilliant debut for Mira Nair......,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1534,"['Salaam', 'Bombay', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'award-winning', 'film', 'debut', 'director', 'producer', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'timeless', 'ode', 'poverty', 'hopelessness', 'tragedy', 'young', 'street', 'kids', 'other', 'residents', 'ghettos', 'Bombay', 'now', 'Mumbai', 'India', 'Nair', 'clearly', 'did', 'research', 'film', 'bring', 'out', 'stunningly', 'powerful', 'acting', 'young', 'actors', 'particularly', 'lead', 'actor', 'Shafiq', 'Sayed', 'Krishna', 'haunting', 'cautionary', 'imagery', 'sad', 'reality', 'street', 'life.Krishna', 'young', 'uneducated', 'Indian', 'boy', 'small', 'village', 'who', 'ventures', 'out', 'Bombay', 'train', 'when', 'must', 'repay', '500', 'rupees', 'family', 'reasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'up', 'one', 'poorest', 'most', 'desolate', 'sections', 'town', 'street', 'urchins', 'prostitutes', 'What', 'out', 'transitional', 'living', 'space', 'lifestyle', 'money', 'selling', 'chai', 'more', 'permanent', 'ultimately', 'impossible', 'Chillum', 'drugdealer', 'who', 'out', 'ally', 'character', 'relationship', 'changes', 'overtime', 'also', 'Manju', 'daughter', 'prostitute', 'young', 'yet', 'already', 'so', 'exposed', 'darker', 'side', 'life.As', 'film', 'forget', 'children', 'are', 'acting', 'recreation', 'real-life', 'events', 'amazing', 'thought-provoking', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'Nair', 'who', 'gone', 'have', 'remarkable', 'brilliant', 'body', 'work']",Salaam Bombay VHS
251572,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6301408926,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[7, 7]","Mira Nair shows the realities of living on the streets in Bombay where children sleep under bridges and sell tea to the prostitutes in brothels as they try to earn money to live from day to day ... Primarily, the film revolves around Krishna, a young boy of 11 years, who left his village to work on the streets of Bombay to earn 500 rupees to pay back his brother, whose bicycle he destroyed. He becomes part of a group of kids who hang out together and look out for one another ... They associate with drug dealers and prostitutes. While the film does show how drugs can destroy lives and how young innocent girls are lured into prostitution there is also a truthfulness and innocence which is conveyed ... The film depicts how the kids survive amidst poverty and how they manage to create a sustainable lifestyle with some semblance of happiness and a wonder for life despite having next to nothing in a material sense.One of the best extra features on this DVD is the commentary by the director. Mira Nair provides insights into how many of the unique scenes were shot. She discusses particular angles and views used by the camera to capture the pure honesty of this lifestyle. She also describes difficulties encountered and how they were resolved, the major one was meeting the budget, the other was was getting big name actors and actresses for the key roles. Fortunately the subject matter was of such importance, a large British studio Filfour agreed to help fund the project if Ms Nair could raise 51% of the budget herself. Another plus was, the subject of the film was deemed a ""governement film"" and therefore she received funds as well as access to areas which otherwise would be denied, such as the children's home where street kids were taken after arrested. Ms Nair managed to get a popular male stage actor who had never done films to play one of the lead roles and to her delight, he has since become one of India's most famous leading male film actors. She also snared a popular female television soap opera star to play the female lead ...One of the most unusual but appealing elements in this film is how Ms Nair used actual street children to be the key actors in the film. She  held auditions and made selections then held seven week long workshops where they learned their parts via pictures of scenes which they memorized. Another captivating aspect of this film is how real streets with shop keepers and shoppers were filmed along with the real train station and the natural activities which fit the storyline of the film. This film is a magnificent study of a way of life that few people can imagine but it is all too common in poverty stricken areas of the world. Through this film, Mira Nair has brought the attention of the world to the plight of homeless children in India. She has made a great contribution to improving their lives on many levels. Due to her efforts, trusts have been established in Bombay and other major cities to educate and assist these children. The film itself is a mix of documentary and fiction which captures the intimate details of their reality in vivid color, detail, and honesty. This is a most highly recommended film.

I love this film!  This is my favorite film in the whole world and in my opinion one of the best films ever made.  After searching for such a long time for this film in which I finally found one used copy on VHS, having this film on DVD is a reale prize.  Not only do you get the film itself and the quality of the picture is fantastic, but you get so many special features.  A major highlight of this DVD is that you get special features with several of the actors that acted in the film.  The features present recent interviews with Shafiq Syed the lead character in the film as well as with the other actors.  These feastures are nice because you see the child actors in what they look like now and what became of their lives.  You also get footage on a brief history on how the actors were recruited off the streets and the making of the film.

It is done through the experience of young Krishna, an illiterate, country  bumpkin of a boy, who is abandoned by his mother at a circus and told not to come home until he has five hundred rupees for having broken something that belonged to his brother. While Krishna is on an errand, the circus packs up and leaves town, and he is left alone to fend for himself.Krishna uses his last few rupees to travel to a city, which by luck of the draw turns out to be Bombay. Thrust into the life of the street children of Bombay, living among the pimps, hustlers, drug addicts, prostitutes, and throw away children that proliferate in India's urban settlements, a modern day jungle, Krishna struggles to survive. His resourcefulness holds him in good stead. He quickly develops some street smarts and forms attachments. He struggles to earn and save money, so that he can return home to his mother and the family whom he misses, only to be duped in the end by one whom he had trusted. His story breaks one's heart, as he learns some hard lessons in life.This is a gritty look into the underbelly and plight of Bombay's poor street children, who call the gutters of its filthy urban streets home. It is filled with the sights and sounds of this urban nightmare.

It is SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE without the millionaire. The entire film is shot on location in the slums of Bombay (now Mumbai) and it feels like you're right there with all the filth, the squalor and the mobs of people. The filmmakers also used real street children for the film. Krishna, an 11 year old boy, has been sent by his mother to work in the circus to earn money. One day, the circus leaves without him and he finds his way to the nearest 'big town', Bombay. There we meet the other main characters, street children, pimps, druggies and prostitutes. In their own way, they stick together and fight to survive. When they try to earn money honestly, the employers take advantage of them, knowing they have no one to defend them. Others give up on honest wages and turn to crime and drugs to survive. But they are all real people and have a story and that's the strength of this movie. You really feel like you have entered into the lives of these people and walked with them in their journey, however short and difficult it may be. Krishna's only goal is to make 500 rupees to take home, a modest goal for most people, but a huge obstacle in that environment. While there are plenty of depressing moments in the film, there is also hope, that with the right kind of guidance and opportunity, these are bright and resourceful children who would be successful in legitimate society if they were given a chance. The sad truth is that very few of them will have that life changing opportunity. There are millions of street children in India and around the world. Many of them just waiting for a sponsor to get them out of the cycle of poverty and crime through organizations that are doing a great work of love and compassion. One of the outstanding ones is COMPASSION INTERNATIONAL. If you watch the film, and I highly recommend it, don't stop there, get involved in making a difference. It changes our lives, too.

The audience is not lectured to but, rather, given the story of a young (pre-teen) Indian boy.  He is a very likeable lad and we take an immediate interest in his well-being.  He seems to do all the right things while finding himself in all the wrong circumstances.  Even though he finds himself among the unsavory of society there is still a loose but visible structure for him to hang onto.  Unfortunately, a key element of the story is the way he continues to become seperated from those he trusts and depends on.  It reinforces the vulneralibility of our young waif.  The ending to the movie is both outstanding and heartbreaking.  It makes the statement of the tragedy of abandoned children in metropolitan India.The acting in ""Salaam Bombay"" is very good and the juvenile actors hold up their end of the movie.  Despite the apparently sour theme, the movie moves along quite well and is entertaining throughout.  I watched it with my 12 year old son.
