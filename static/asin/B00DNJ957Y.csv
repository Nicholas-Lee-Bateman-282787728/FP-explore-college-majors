Within that pool of talent there were highs and lows. On the low end, a couple of actresses do over emphasize their lines a bit making them seem a little pantomime. On the high end however, there was the likes of Marylee Osborne, an actress not unfamiliar to Henrique Couto's experiments in film, and newcomer to the Couto films, Erin R. Ryan. Both of these women are fantastic to watch but for very different reasons.Marylee's half buzzed hair and piercings make her visually interesting and her sarcastic wit, which I'm pretty sure isn't all an act, brings much of the humor that is interspersed throughout the film.Ryan on the other had comes across as the pretty girl next door. The one you can never say no to when she comes collecting for some cause of fundraiser. Together they bookend the film and make getting from one scene to the next a pleasure. They portray the unlikeliest of best friends, but thanks to Henrique's script, you buy into every bit of it!One last thing I want to mention, and I would be pretty remiss if I didn't, the gore! Amazingly understated to be honest! Not saying there wasn't plenty to be had, but it was done with a great amount of taste and well within the confines of the films minuscule budget. Smartly, no one tried to pull off anything they couldn't achieve believably. Thanks to quick cuts and brilliant make-up work you won't miss the fountains of blood or piles of entrails that are often the norm for this type of movie.What else to say? Oh! One thing that this film DOES have in abundance is nudity! Couto gives us either blood or boobs every 10 minutes or so to keep the audience interested. Just about every woman in the film gets down to nothing at some point. (I honestly think the nudity wasn't necessary and the film would stand well on its own without it, but hey.. Who am I to argue?)OK, so my overall rating for Babysitter Massacre?

The plot has holes you can drive a semi truck through and little, if anything, is explained at the end.I will give it more than one star because it had &#34;real&#34; size women -- not anorexic stick figures and a few interesting ideas that raise this awful movie to the merely meh factor.Plot . spoilers (and the word plot is used liberally)Apparently, with no background, there was a babysitter's club of 14 year old girls from the local town.  At halloween, two went out to trick or treat and some creepy white masked guy apparently kidnapped one of the girls.Now, seven years later, the missing girl has been pronounced dead by authorities,.  The girl that was with her at the time is largely a pariah but has maintained friendship with &#34;the girl next door&#34;.I find that trying to explain this movie is giving me a headache.  Suffice to say that someone in the plain white head mask is capturing and/or murdering the members of this former circle of babysitters -- all in the name of true love (you don't really want to know more, but you will probably watch anyway).  In a bit of a nod to standard horror tropes, several of the victims get naked before they are killed (I can't call this a redeeming quality, but it is what it is).  This skirts into torture porn and would be disturbing if the production values were greater.

But don't worry they just sit there as they talk so it's not visually dynamic or anything, so if you're concerned about your bad heart, you won't get too excited so you'll be fine.  And then the first two thirds is mostly filled with random people the director conned into getting naked being killed.  And then we have our leads who wear lingerie in a house and aren't involved with any of the stuff going on, and don't know about any of the murders, so we get to see them have conversations about bnot being assertive enough, like a Lifetime movie shot on a camcorder.  We also have some angry girl who runs around (that's pretty much her function).  Then in the last twenty minutes someone figured hey, we should have something happen to the lead characters!  So the killer shows up and it's a surprise because it's the most obvious and pretty much only person it could be.  Why is that a surprise when it was so obvious?  Because knowing it was THAT obvious you'd think the filmmakers would spend an extra two minutes to come up with something better, but they have weed to smoke so hard work is out!

Now they are being killed off with only one suspect.The film lacked the dialog to be a classic, yet at the same time had some weird scenes like the candy scene with Stephanie Michael. The slasher aspect was mediocre. What the film had going for it was an abundance of nudity of healthy girls.Parental Guide: F-bomb, No sex. Full frontal nudity (Erin R. Ryan, Tara Clark, Odette Despairr, Stephanie Michael, Joni Durian)3 1/2 stars for the nudity.",4,TIS THE SEASON,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,555,"['Seven', 'years', 'ago', 'April', 'was', 'killed', 'Halloween', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'was', 'part', 'babysitters', 'club', 'Now', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'suspect.The', 'film', 'lacked', 'dialog', 'be', 'classic', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'weird', 'scenes', 'candy', 'scene', 'Stephanie', 'Michael', 'slasher', 'aspect', 'was', 'mediocre', 'What', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'abundance', 'nudity', 'healthy', 'girls.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'No', 'sex', 'Full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Erin', 'R.', 'Ryan', 'Tara', 'Clark', 'Odette', 'Despairr', 'Stephanie', 'Michael', 'Joni', 'Durian', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'nudity']",Babysitter Massacre
1659693,AGSBVCZ1L0XYO,B00DNJ957Y,Timothy Collins,"[1, 3]",This film comes from the mind of Henrique Couto and yes his mind may be a little off kilter. Having met him and seen him in other independent films I am surprised at the intense horror that comes out of him. This is the 2nd film I have seen which is been very intense. The first one was Bleeding Though and that was more psychological then straight up horror. This film harkens back to the early days of the slasher genre in the 80's. It reminds of such films like the Prowler and Sleepaway Camp. It follows a group of likeable characters that are slowly being butchered by an unseen assailant (and I do mean butchered). You can see that Henrique has a love for these types of films and he pours that love into this film. It is nice to see how good something can be when it is done by a true fan of the genre. Very nicely done with good effects and equally good camera work. There are several extras on the DVD that Henrique uses to explain his reasons for doing this film and his general motivation when it comes to film making.,5,Old School Slasher,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1029,"['film', 'mind', 'Henrique', 'Couto', 'yes', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'off', 'kilter', 'Having', 'met', 'seen', 'other', 'independent', 'films', 'am', 'surprised', 'intense', 'horror', '2nd', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'been', 'very', 'intense', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'Bleeding', 'Though', 'was', 'more', 'psychological', 'then', 'straight', 'up', 'horror', 'film', 'back', 'early', 'days', 'slasher', 'genre', '80', 'such', 'films', 'Prowler', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'group', 'likeable', 'characters', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'butchered', 'unseen', 'assailant', 'do', 'mean', 'butchered', 'can', 'see', 'Henrique', 'love', 'types', 'films', 'love', 'film', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'done', 'true', 'fan', 'genre', 'Very', 'nicely', 'done', 'good', 'effects', 'equally', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Henrique', 'explain', 'reasons', 'doing', 'film', 'general', 'motivation', 'when', 'film', 'making']",Babysitter Massacre
