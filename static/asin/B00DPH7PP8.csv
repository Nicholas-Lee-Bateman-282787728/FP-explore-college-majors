We often wear different masks around different people, because we want various people to perceive us in various ways.  We even lie to ourselves pretending that we are more good, more wise, more strong, more happy, more beautiful, or more brave than we really are.  For most people, the only fear greater than knowing who we truly are, is the horror that others might realize who we truly are as well.Kokoro Connect is an excellent series.  It allows the viewer to truly feel the fear of their inner being laid bare for others to see.  In each of 4 arcs, a god causes some sort of phenomenon to occur to the 5 characters that allows--and forces--them to see parts of each other's lives which they would normally keep hidden.  For example in the first arc, the god causes the 5 to switch bodies with each other at random times.  Thus these five friends, who have never shared the naked truth of their family lives, or lives outside of school in general, now experience each other's lives first-hand.  The series makes you realize how little you may know those people that are closest too you, and it forces you to be honest about how little you allow others to know yourself.I apologize for what I'm about to say, because I'm about to commit one of my own pet peeves...  As awesome as the series is, I have to complain about the way it's being released.  Kokoro Connect is a 17 episode series.  Depending on the time-block one airs in, a season of anime is between 11 and 13 episodes.  For this reason, the last four episodes were aired as specials.  These last four episodes are not included in the set; they are being released separately.SeeKokoro Connect Ova: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]Most of the time in anime OVAs are side stories:  extra background material, or the obligatory beach/hot springs event...  This is not the case with Kokoro Connect.  It's not until this final arc of the series that the character development really ties together.  If I didn't know and I bought this set for $60, I would be aggravated to find out I needed to spend another $35 so that I could have the last 4 episodes of the series.Again, Kokoro Connect is excellent.  It has great characters and deep emotion.  It's hard to recommend buying it with the way it's being released, but it is definitely a show you should watch.",4,Excellent series... but NOT complete set,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2435,"['wear', 'mask', 'Everyday', 'put', 'mask', 'walk', 'door', 'fear', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'often', 'wear', 'different', 'masks', 'different', 'people', 'want', 'various', 'people', 'perceive', 'various', 'ways', 'even', 'lie', 'ourselves', 'pretending', 'are', 'more', 'good', 'more', 'wise', 'more', 'strong', 'more', 'happy', 'more', 'beautiful', 'more', 'brave', 'really', 'are', 'most', 'people', 'only', 'fear', 'greater', 'knowing', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'horror', 'others', 'might', 'realize', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'well.Kokoro', 'Connect', 'excellent', 'series', 'viewer', 'truly', 'feel', 'fear', 'inner', 'being', 'laid', 'bare', 'others', 'see', '4', 'arcs', 'god', 'sort', 'phenomenon', 'occur', '5', 'characters', 'forces', 'see', 'parts', 'other', 'lives', 'would', 'normally', 'keep', 'hidden', 'example', 'first', 'arc', 'god', '5', 'switch', 'bodies', 'other', 'random', 'times', 'Thus', 'five', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'shared', 'naked', 'truth', 'family', 'lives', 'school', 'general', 'now', 'experience', 'other', 'lives', 'first-hand', 'series', 'realize', 'how', 'little', 'may', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'closest', 'too', 'be', 'honest', 'how', 'little', 'allow', 'others', 'know', 'yourself.I', 'apologize', 'what', ""'m"", 'say', ""'m"", 'commit', 'one', 'own', 'pet', 'peeves', 'As', 'awesome', 'series', 'have', 'complain', 'way', 'being', 'released', 'Kokoro', 'Connect', '17', 'episode', 'series', 'Depending', 'time-block', 'one', 'airs', 'season', 'anime', '11', '13', 'episodes', 'reason', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'aired', 'specials', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'separately.SeeKokoro', 'Connect', 'Ova', 'Complete', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Most', 'time', 'anime', 'OVAs', 'are', 'side', 'stories', 'extra', 'material', 'obligatory', 'beach/hot', 'springs', 'event', 'not', 'case', 'Kokoro', 'Connect', 'not', 'final', 'arc', 'series', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'bought', 'set', '60', 'would', 'be', 'aggravated', 'find', 'out', 'needed', 'spend', '35', 'could', 'have', 'last', '4', 'episodes', 'series.Again', 'Kokoro', 'Connect', 'excellent', 'great', 'characters', 'deep', 'emotion', 'hard', 'recommend', 'buying', 'way', 'being', 'released', 'definitely', 'show', 'should', 'watch']",N/A

1660353,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B00DPH7PP8,RavenRing,"[3, 3]","Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi, and Yui are all completely normal high school students, until one day when they all start switching bodies. The switches can happen at any time of day, last different amounts of time, and only occur within their little group. After the initial shock, they start trying to just make it through each day without raising suspicion. Then, as suddenly as it started, it stops. Only something else strange has taken its place...When I initially heard about this series I wasn't the slightest bit interested. I thought it would be filled with awkward/stupid scenes of guys and girls switching bodies. But while there is the awkwardness of guys ending up in their cute female classmates' bodies, it is reasonably handled and then they move on. The thing about this series is that it isn't about the body switching, it is about how the characters handle the body switching and other strange events that happen. The character behind the strangeness seems to be testing the characters', well, character.One thing that should be noted about this series - it is 17 episodes long, but the last 4 episodes were released separately from the first season. I don't know why this was done, but fortunately, all of it is being released domestically, though in two separate sets. This set has the first 13 episodes and the last four are here:Kokoro Connect Ova: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]. I've only seen the first 13 epsidoes since I watched this on Crunchyroll and that is all they had. I intend to finish the series as soon as the OVA is released here.This series is an interesting study of people and relationships.

The animation is done well a little mix of Haruhi Suzumiya and Ouran Host Club,the soundtrack is also done well a nice tempo melodic pace and fast paced when the action or comedy starts.The voice cast for the English and Japanese dubbed and subbed did a great job for their characters showing their talent,the extras for the set are pretty standard so on that part don't expect too much.
