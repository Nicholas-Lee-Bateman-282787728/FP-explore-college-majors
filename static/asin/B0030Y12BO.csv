Season 8 still has lots of great stories and scenery. The season opener is tight and taut and features young Donna Mills and David Birney as well as the ever delightful and charming Kigh Deigh as Wo Fat. Wo Fat is probably the best villain ever created and just so much fun to watch, even if he does get snookered by Steve in the end. Helen Hayes delivers a wonderful performance with her son Jim McArthur in Retire in Sunny Hawaii...Forever. Some other wonderful characters and performances are delivered in The Defector, The Case against McGarrett, Target? The Lady (Susan Dey), and Wooden Model of a Rat (Ed Asner). Also gorgeous Hawaiian scenery in McGarrett is Missing (Big Island)and Turkey Shoot at Makapuu (hang-gliding ai-yi-yi!) Danny's horrible plaid suit was ditched in favour of a much nicer medium blue one and he gets still more face time, always a pleasure of the series 8-).

1316159,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B0030Y12BO,Gary P. Cohen,"[3, 4]","Hawaii Five-0 is one of my three all-time favorite shows.  There are so many reasons why this was such a great series: the great location work, terrific scripts, great music, opening and one of the greatest themes of all-time.  However the most important thing in the success of Five-0 is two words: Jack Lord.  I don't think there has ever been a more dominant actor in a more commanding role.  The man was absolutely perfect.  There was never a second whereLord was less than totally believable as the head of the Hawaiian State Police.  Now I understand that Lord was a perfectionist and supposedly difficult to work with.  (Over the years I have met two of the co-stars of Five-0, James MacArthur and Al Harrington.  I asked them about working with Lord and they echoed what I have said.)  However Lord was the moving force between the excellence that was Hawaii Five-0 and for that he has my total respect.  (As I am sure many have heard CBS has commissioned a pilot for a new Hawaii Five-0 and it is very sure to be picked up for a series next season.  Young Austrailian actor, Alex O'Laughlin, formerly the star of the prematurely-cancelled CBS series ""Moonlight"" is set to star as McGarrett.  This is a very poor idea.  Sorry gang, there is only one Steve McGarrett and that was Jack Lord.  The only ones who might be enthusiastic about this series are those young people who have never seen or heard of the original ""Hawaii Five-0.""  The only thing that could have been worse was another unsold ""Hawaii Five-0"" pilot that was supposed to star Gary Busey as McGarrett.)""Hawaii Five-0"" lasted twelve years.  However, in all honesty, it really was ""played out"" (as my father used to say) by about its tenth season.  After season 11, James MacArthur dropped out and in its 12th and last season, Jack Lord was surrounded by an all-new cast.  It really didn't work and this great series was laid to rest after that season.This season, its 8th., the show was still running on all gears and had some very good episodes.  My favorite is the episode ""Death's Name is Sam.""  This concerns some fictional terrorist group getting ahold of some SAM (Surface to Air Missiles) that they want to use to take out the plane of some fictional world leader visiting Hawaii.  The conclusion with the Five-0 team on both sides of the runway shooting up flares to attract the heat-seeking missiles, as the plane attempts to land, is one of the most exciting conclusions to any episode I've seen and this episode, guest starring Star Trek's George Takei, is one of my all-time favorites.  The last scene, freezed-framed, is of an exhausted McGarrett, still standing tall however, in front of an enormous American flag.  A very apt conclusion.  That is the McGarrett I remember, played by one of the greatest TV actors ever, the great Jack Lord.  That is ""Hawaii Five-0"" to me and that is why, 30 years after its last episode, it is still one of the all-time best.",5,One of the All-Time Greats,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2947,"['Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'one', 'three', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'series', 'great', 'location', 'work', 'terrific', 'scripts', 'great', 'music', 'opening', 'one', 'greatest', 'themes', 'all-time', 'However', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'success', 'Five-0', 'two', 'words', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'more', 'dominant', 'actor', 'more', 'commanding', 'role', 'man', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'was', 'never', 'second', 'whereLord', 'was', 'less', 'totally', 'believable', 'head', 'Hawaiian', 'State', 'Police', 'Now', 'understand', 'Lord', 'was', 'perfectionist', 'supposedly', 'difficult', 'work', 'years', 'have', 'met', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Five-0', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Al', 'Harrington', 'asked', 'working', 'Lord', 'echoed', 'what', 'have', 'said', 'However', 'Lord', 'was', 'moving', 'force', 'excellence', 'was', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'total', 'respect', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'heard', 'CBS', 'commissioned', 'pilot', 'new', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'very', 'sure', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'series', 'season', 'Young', 'Austrailian', 'actor', 'Alex', ""O'Laughlin"", 'formerly', 'star', 'prematurely-cancelled', 'CBS', 'series', 'Moonlight', 'set', 'star', 'McGarrett', 'very', 'poor', 'idea', 'Sorry', 'gang', 'only', 'one', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'was', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'enthusiastic', 'series', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'original', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'was', 'unsold', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'pilot', 'was', 'supposed', 'star', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'McGarrett', 'Five-0', 'lasted', 'twelve', 'years', 'However', 'honesty', 'really', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'father', 'used', 'say', 'tenth', 'season', 'season', '11', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'dropped', 'out', '12th', 'last', 'season', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'surrounded', 'all-new', 'cast', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'great', 'series', 'was', 'laid', 'rest', 'season.This', 'season', '8th.', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'gears', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Death', 'Name', 'Sam', 'fictional', 'terrorist', 'group', 'getting', 'ahold', 'SAM', 'Surface', 'Air', 'Missiles', 'want', 'use', 'take', 'out', 'plane', 'fictional', 'world', 'leader', 'visiting', 'Hawaii', 'conclusion', 'Five-0', 'team', 'sides', 'runway', 'shooting', 'up', 'flares', 'attract', 'heat-seeking', 'missiles', 'plane', 'attempts', 'land', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'conclusions', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'guest', 'starring', 'Star', 'Trek', 'George', 'Takei', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'last', 'scene', 'freezed-framed', 'exhausted', 'McGarrett', 'still', 'standing', 'tall', 'however', 'front', 'enormous', 'American', 'flag', 'very', 'apt', 'conclusion', 'McGarrett', 'remember', 'played', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'actors', 'ever', 'great', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'why', '30', 'years', 'last', 'episode', 'still', 'one', 'all-time', 'best']",N/A

They certainly don't make TV shows like that any more. The quality of the previous 7 Seasons of Five-0 was always great, and I would certainly expect that Season 8 will follow in the same tradition. However, even if they produced it in Black and White, I'd still give it 5 STARS.  By the time Season 8 had rolled around in 1975, some of the plots were not quite up to par like they were in some of the earlier Seasons, but I still love watching every one of them. A few years ago I previously purchased all 12 Seasons of Five-0 which were mainly just old copies that were probably made directly from TV broadcasts, which even included the commercials. And I've even enjoyed watching those old versions, no matter how poorly they were copied.

Well, I'll tell you: For the past few years, I have heard that, after Season 6, Five-0 really fell off. In my opinion, that simply is NOT true. Granted Five-0 changed after Season 6. It became more mature, taking a more intellectual look at issues and details. We certainly wouldn't have spent an hour in Season 1, learning about the art world, yet we did in Season 7 (""How to Steal a Masterpiece""), and we are all the better for it.In Season 8, we continue to learn. In ""Death's Name is Sam,"" we learn about heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles - hand-held ones, in fact. This was brand new technology in 1975, when this was filmed. Even now, it is fascinating to watch as McGarrett tries to divert the missile with flares in order to keep the aircraft from being shot down. Fortunately, the experimental effort was successful. But Season 8 isn't all about technology and learning.Steve has a new love interest in Season 8 (""Sing a Song of Suspense""). She is Chelsea Merriman, and she is a professional singer. After witnessing a brutal murder, she is taken to Steve's beach house for safekeeping. Oh, how the romantic sparks fly between them. As he leaves for work, she tells him to ""Call if you're going to be late tonight, dear."" I had to wonder whether Lois Nettleton, who portrayed Chelsea, didn't ad lib some of those lines.The Five-0 Team has settled in nicely with McGarrett, Danno, Chin Ho, Duke, Jenny, Che Fong, and Doc - and the Governor, of course. Sadly, Season 8 was Doc's last on the show. He will be missed.All the way through, not a single dud came to light. Not every episode was bottle rockets and roman candles, but every one was good and held my attention from beginning to end. Don't miss it. McGarrett and the Five-0 Team are still right on top.

Another note of reality was Kam Fong as Chin, who was a former real life policeman.  Then there was the backdrop of beautiful Hawaii, they filmed all around the island of Oahu at parks, beaches, attractions, luxury hotels and millionaires' homes, enticing armchair travelers like myself to come visit (which I fortunately did on several occasions).  The stories were solidly told, with plenty of chases and action, and there were many recognizable guest stars of the 1970s on this Season 8 six-DVD set, whose episodes are listed below along with their featured guest stars:Disc 1Murder-Eyes Only  - Donna Mills, David BirneyMcGarrett Is Missing - Charles Cioffi, Jack HoganTermination With Extreme Prejudice - Juliet Mills, Dan O'HerlihyDisc 2Target?

1316171,A1BJYEMRX782D3,B0030Y12BO,J. Herman,"[4, 6]","I recently picked up Season 8 and skimmed through most of the shows, which I haven't seen in some time.  Overall, I think season 8 is an improvement over season 7, with better guest stars (Ed Asner, Donna Mills, Susan Dey, Dan O' Herlihy, Lew Ayres, George Takei, John Colicos, Pat Hingle, Charles Durning, Adam Arkin, Helen Heyes), and of course several strong episodes at the top of the season to kick things off.  Additionally, McGarrett has ditched the awful cream-colored suit and jet black hair dye (he doesn't seem quite so pasty as in the last few seasons).  In fact, the sideburns seem a little shorter, the suits are a little less garish, and the music scores are very good.The 2-hour opener has great production values and is a good espionage thriller with Wo Fat, although he doesn't seem to have much to do other than sit around on his hydrofoil and let his henchman handle all the dirty work.Other great episodes include ""McGarrett is Missing"" wherein he survives a plane crash in the jungle with a convict from season 2; ""Death's Name is SAM"" in which terrorists attempt to blow up a jetliner using surface-to-air missiles; ""The Case Against McGarrett"" features McGarrett being held hostage in prison by Honore Vashon, and is the wrap-up to the season 5 Vashon trilogy; ""Retire in Sunny Hawaii Forever"" features Helen Hayes as Danno's aunt investigating murder at a retirement home;  ""The Defector"" is another great espionage thriller involving a Red Chinese agent; ""Deadly Persuason"" features a psycho out to murder the visiting royal family; ""A Touch of Guilt"" is about a senator's son who's involved in a gang rape.  I think overall there are fewer lousy episodes this season than season 7.Some other observations about the DVD set itself:-The song used in ""Sing a Song of Suspense"" is intact-The disclaimer on the box from previous seasons, ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"", is NOT on the box this time around.-They use the same shot of Danno and Duke on both the front and the back of the box-Either I'm getting used to it, or the JL picture on the front of the box looks better than it did in the web artwork.  Maybe they touched it up a tad so it didn't look quite so photoshopped.-It's interesting that inside the disc cases, they have another new nighttime shot of downtown Honolulu, again looking very modern like the season 7 cover shot.I am watching S8 upconverted to 1080p on a Blu-ray player on a 46"" plasma, and I actually think S8 looks sharper and less grainy than several of the previous seasons.  This could have more to do with the film stock they shot on back then, which I suspect changed throughout the show's run, and also with how the film was processed back then.  I don't really think the remastering has changed during the DVD releases, as really the resolution looks the same throughout each.  I also suspect the earliest seasons looked brighter and more colorful simply because shows in the late 60's in the early days of color TV seemed to go crazy with lots of bright colors (Star Trek, Five-0, Lost in Space, Gilligan's Island, etc.).I have really been enjoying the new music scores from many of the season 8 episodes.  Morton Stevens, Bruce Broughton and Don B. Ray, the music supervisor of Season 8, introduced a number of music cues in season 8 that I liked a lot(most of them didn't seem to get used in further seasons unfortunately). In fact, I think season 8 was one of the very best seasons for consistently great new musical scores.4 more seasons to go, and season 9 (hopefully coming sometime this summer) is another winner.

1316177,A5NKC5NBCE6EM,B0030Y12BO,Philip,"[3, 4]","Background to review.... 8th SeasonWe have found that if you can't be in Hawaii, 50 is the next best thing. We have been to Hawaii 4 times in the last 9 years. We love it and can't get enough of it. Last Christmas my sister-in-law gave me a gift card. I had purchased all the Magnum PI seasons that I could so I decided to give H50 a try as my late mother was a faithful 50 fan. I was pleasantly surprised by H50 Season 1.  Now besides Magnum PI I can get my Hawaiian fix between trips with H50. Well we developed a craving for H50 so that I have purchased and viewed all 7 seasons and 3/4 the way through season 8.I have found that all the H50 seasons are great 1 through 8. They seem to get better and better with scripts and settings. The only thing that could have been better is if they had more local actors to mix the blend of them from episode to episode. What I mean by that is in this week's episode you will have one actor playing a really bad guy and next week he or she is back as a good guy. This is a similar pattern that started with The 60's in ""Wild Wild West"" where that used the same group of bit actors over and over again.  Robert Conrad commented that this made them a winning team because of the relationships formed. However this process in any series can be a little monotonous as in ""West"" or in Hawaii 50.The other question came to me: Why wasn't a movie made of H50? If it was good enough for older TV series like the Lone Ranger why not a movie of Hawaii 50?Finally, since I am running out of H50 episodes, I hope that fellow fans like all of you will look at a predecessor of H50 namely ""Hawaiian Eye"" DVDs which are currently Out of Stock by Amazon. If enough of you put yourselves on the ""Wait List"" it would make it available with large requests. In conclusion I recommend all Hawaii 50 seasons 1-8. I haven't gotten to ""9"" yet.

Hawaii Five O was my absolutely favorite show as a teenager and it has not lost its appeal now that I'm in my fifties.  Jack Lord was so good looking to me back then and he still has it.  Steve McGarrett is such a fascinating and sexy man who knows his business.  The episdoes are still well written and wonderfully acted.  I do miss Kono, though, I wish he hadn't left the series after 4 seasons.I usually rely heavily on the reviews on Amazon, but I didn't need to have a reccommend for this one.  I knew without doubt I wanted to own this DVD season.I have heard they are making a new Hawaii Five O but there is no way it can even begin to compare with the original.

1316183,A17FLIUHSEQC8D,B0030Y12BO,"S. Ward ""stephengward""","[17, 22]","I must admit, Season 8 was the season that I started to tune out of Five-0. I'm a big fan of the first six seasons - for me, these seasons represent superb escapist television at its very best. In these early years, Jack Lord was coolness personified and the show was a no nonsense gritty AND entertaining drama.Unlike in the latter years, in those early seasons, McGarrett's anger never appeared contrived or forced - you really felt this man's rage! Circa 1974 this changed and McGarrett's spontaneous outburst against life's injustices became elongated rants to whoever was within ear shot.Additionally, the big attraction of the show was how one week you could see a light-hearted episode and the next you'd see a hard hitting thought provoking instalment - season 4 demonstrates this nicely, `Odd Man In' and then `Skinhead' could hardly be more different, but they were encompassed together within the same season. This kind of contrast was rife in the early years and, more importantly, superbly executed. With Season 7 there were signs of wear and I'm afraid that this increased with during season 8.  It's really a paradox that the earlier episodes seem fresher and less dated than anything post 1974. What's the saying, quit whilst you're ahead, sadly this wasn't heeded, however, that said, there are still some very good episodes within this eighth season.The opener, `Murder - Eyes Only' is a feature length special and is pretty good - this is how i'd have liked to have seen the show continue,  i.e. as two hour long specials, maybe 6 or 7 in a season - that way we'd have kept quality over quantity.  Unfortunately this wasn't to be and the remaining 22 episodes are the usual 50 minute affair.  Other good episodes are `McGarrett Is Missing', `Termination With Extreme Prejudice', `The Case Against McGarrett', `Retire In Sunny Hawaii - Forever'. As I say, good episodes, but nothing truly outstanding - and IMO, this season is nowhere near the quality of Seasons 3;4;5 and 6.I'm now in receipt of this DVD set and, with regards to remastering, its the usual mixed affair. Some episodes look very good, with rich vibrant colours - however, 'Wooden Model Of A Rat' appears less striking than other episodes on the set in this respect. As usual there is evidence of 'dirt' in certain scenes in certain episodes too. These are minor setbacks as the quality of even the lesser remastered episodes is way above anything I've seen broadcast on tv for this season.All episodes contain episodic promos except for the opener, 'Murder - Eyes Only' - this feature length special is unabridged, coming in at just shy of 100 minutes in length.I've rated this set 3 stars because previous seasons set the benchmark extremely high - that said, in comparison to many shows of today and in terms of entertainment, this set would attain a five star rating.",3,"Book 'em, Murder One",1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2855,"['must', 'admit', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'season', 'started', 'tune', 'Five-0', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'seasons', 'represent', 'superb', 'escapist', 'television', 'very', 'best', 'early', 'years', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'was', 'coolness', 'personified', 'show', 'was', 'nonsense', 'gritty', 'AND', 'entertaining', 'drama.Unlike', 'latter', 'years', 'early', 'seasons', 'McGarrett', 'anger', 'never', 'appeared', 'contrived', 'forced', 'really', 'felt', 'man', 'rage', 'Circa', '1974', 'changed', 'McGarrett', 'spontaneous', 'outburst', 'life', 'injustices', 'became', 'elongated', 'rants', 'whoever', 'was', 'ear', 'shot.Additionally', 'big', 'attraction', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'one', 'week', 'could', 'see', 'light-hearted', 'episode', 'next', ""'d"", 'see', 'hard', 'hitting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'instalment', 'season', '4', 'nicely', 'Odd', 'Man', 'then', 'Skinhead', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'were', 'encompassed', 'together', 'same', 'season', 'kind', 'contrast', 'was', 'rife', 'early', 'years', 'more', 'importantly', 'superbly', 'executed', 'Season', '7', 'were', 'signs', 'wear', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'increased', 'season', '8', 'really', 'paradox', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'seem', 'fresher', 'less', 'dated', 'anything', 'post', '1974', 'What', 'saying', 'quit', 'whilst', ""'re"", 'ahead', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'heeded', 'however', 'said', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'eighth', 'season.The', 'opener', 'Murder', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'feature', 'length', 'special', 'pretty', 'good', 'how', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'continue', 'i.e', 'two', 'hour', 'long', 'specials', 'maybe', '6', '7', 'season', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'kept', 'quality', 'quantity', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'remaining', '22', 'episodes', 'are', 'usual', '50', 'minute', 'affair', 'Other', 'good', 'episodes', 'are', 'McGarrett', 'Missing', 'Termination', 'Extreme', 'Prejudice', 'Case', 'Against', 'McGarrett', 'Retire', 'Sunny', 'Hawaii', 'Forever', 'say', 'good', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'IMO', 'season', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'Seasons', '3', '4', '5', '6.I', ""'m"", 'now', 'receipt', 'DVD', 'set', 'regards', 'remastering', 'usual', 'mixed', 'affair', 'episodes', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'however', ""'Wooden"", 'Model', 'A', 'Rat', 'less', 'striking', 'other', 'episodes', 'set', 'respect', 'usual', 'evidence', ""'dirt"", 'certain', 'scenes', 'certain', 'episodes', 'too', 'are', 'minor', 'setbacks', 'quality', 'even', 'lesser', 'remastered', 'episodes', 'way', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'broadcast', 'tv', 'season.All', 'contain', 'episodic', 'promos', 'opener', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'feature', 'length', 'special', 'unabridged', 'coming', 'just', 'shy', '100', 'minutes', 'length.I', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'set', '3', 'stars', 'because', 'previous', 'seasons', 'set', 'benchmark', 'extremely', 'high', 'said', 'comparison', 'many', 'shows', 'today', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'set', 'would', 'attain', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

None of the episodes grabbed you like other classics(Over Fifty?--Steal, The Vashon Trilogy, One Big Happy Family etc) and repetitiveness started seeping in. Late in this season there are back to back kidnapping episodes. Two episodes(The Capsule Kidnapping and Death's name is SAM) saw car-airplane chases at the end. Another pair of episodes had McGarret in the grasp of the episodes villians(Case Against McGarret and McGarret is missing)Two other episodes(Anatomy of a Bribe and Deadly Persuasion) had villains who were more than a few cards short of a full deck but their actions at the climax didn't add up when compared to the rest of the episode. Honoree Vashon also became more and more unhinged as The Case Against McGarrett progressed. Season 8's writers kept coming back to the same themes.Two episodes(The Waterfront Steal and Love Thy Neighbor Take his Wife) have the daughter of the bad guy involved with the criminals or the person being framed for the crime.Richard Kiley could have made a great guest villain but he is given little to do in A Killer Grows Wings except to drive a car between sugarcane fields.The best episodes, Retire in Sunny Hawaii--Forever, The Case against McGarret, Turkey Shoot at Makapu,  Honor is an Unmarked Grave, and A Touch of Guilt, were very good but only Retire(and just marginally) ranks among Five-0's all-time best episodes. With the possible exception of Deadly Persuassion and Wooden Model of a Rat, there isn't a bad episode during the season.
