From the technical aspects-cinematography, editing, sound, ect.-to the writing and overall acting, it makes you want to pop the first film in the  DVD player and watch it yet again.One of the criteria for judging a movie  such as this is how easily and naturally it causes the tears to flow.  With  part 1, I was in tears with no difficulty at all.  The drama was so real  and spontaneous.  But with the second film you get the feeling they are  trying to grab your eyeballs to squeeze every little tear out of them.  This makes for very strained proceedings indeed.Everything considered,  Wilford Brimley and Doug McKeon DO manage to rise slightly above the  material and keep this film from getting a one-star rating but I still  think you're better off sticking with the original.",2,Stick with Part 1!,951609600,"02 27, 2000",2000,855,"['Nearly', 'everything', 'film', 'comparison', 'original', 'technical', 'aspects-cinematography', 'editing', 'sound', 'ect.-to', 'writing', 'overall', 'acting', 'want', 'pop', 'first', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'watch', 'yet', 'again.One', 'criteria', 'judging', 'movie', 'such', 'how', 'easily', 'naturally', 'tears', 'flow', 'part', '1', 'was', 'tears', 'difficulty', 'drama', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'spontaneous', 'second', 'film', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'trying', 'grab', 'eyeballs', 'squeeze', 'little', 'tear', 'very', 'strained', 'proceedings', 'indeed.Everything', 'considered', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'Doug', 'McKeon', 'DO', 'manage', 'rise', 'slightly', 'material', 'keep', 'film', 'getting', 'one-star', 'rating', 'still', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'sticking', 'original']",Where the Red Fern Grows II

Its WAY to sad and depressing, not to say  it isn't worth seeing if you havn't seen it yet. &quot;Where the Red Fern  Grows 2&quot; is years after the first one  and Billy is now returning home  after fighting in World War II. His grandpa (Wilford Brimley) suprises him  with two red-bone hounds just like the ones he had when he was a boy. At  first he doesn't accept them but finally takes them to train them to track  down racoons. Has a little bit of humor and is to a point more mature than  the first. Even though you won't be able to hold back  tears at the end,  you will treasure this classic later on and come back to see it again and  again.
