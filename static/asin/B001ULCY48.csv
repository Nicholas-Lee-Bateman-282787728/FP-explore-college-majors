I am only half way through it on disc #3 and my disappointment with the shoddy production values of this final season has already caused me to return to the customer reviews to see if anyone else had the same experience. Yes, seasoned fans have discussed in length the copyrighted music substitutions, but am I the only one who experienced the appallingly horrendous episode transfers to disc? I have a bluray player which is designed to enhance  DVDs, and it usually does. Disc #1 played beautifully, but right from the start of disc #2, the color took on a dominant deep red bleed that remained unnaturally distracting throughout all of the five episodes. And the contrast of the disc was so severe that most exterior and interior scenes had backgrounds that were consistently near total dark blackness. Disc # 3 had all of the same problems, but so far the second episode had the additional distraction of scenes where the image broke down into pixal-like bits, went sluggish and lost sync with the soundtrack. The overall effect was not unlike a bootleg transferred from a poorly video taped copy rather than a professional distribution of a studio season release. I am grateful to finally complete my library's EVERWOOD collection, but it pains me to end it with something of this amateurishly poor level of disrespect and neglect.

I guess enough people eventually got out there and bought that set because we will soon be able to buy this fourth and final season of the classic WB drama, Everwood. This season contains the final 22 episodes of Everwood:A Kiss to Build a Dream OnThe Next StepPut On a Happy FacePieces of MeConnect FourFree FallPro ChoiceSo Long, Farewell...Getting to Know YouGhostsLost and FoundYou're a Good Man, Andy BrownAn Ounce of PreventionAcross the LinesThe Land of ConfusionTruth...All the Lonely PeopleEnjoy the RideReckoningGoodbye, LoveForeverwood Part 1Foreverwood Part 2The final season stuck true to the tone that the show had established in previous seasons. Each season had it's own themes though and each can be classified with an overall theme. Season 1 was a year of hope and innocence, season 2 and the aftermath of the season one finale found a year of growth while coping with depressing realities, season 3 brought us realistic hope and season four brought us a maturity and understanding. Personally I prefer season's one and three of the show the best but this entire series was as fantastic as a network family/small town drama can get. So get out there and buy the third season set so that we can eventually get the option of owning the fourth.And for anyone who loves this show and is looking for another small town/family drama I suggest NBC's fan loved but little known show, Friday Night Lights. The first season of which is fantastic and one of the best seasons of a television series ever. The show isn't just about high school football but about life, the Texas town of Dillon and the lives of the people in it. The show uses football like Everwood uses Andy being a doctor, it's not the story but merely a means to open up the story. While the second season became overdramatized for a short while it's third, fourth and fifth seasons have been fantastic. We've now lost another great show as the fifth season was the final one but I highly recommend the series on DVD.
