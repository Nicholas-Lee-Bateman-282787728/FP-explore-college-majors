I was only slightly disappointed because some things were changed for the movie but overall, what makes this movie memorable are the wonderful performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, and Octavia Spencer are fantastic! In the beginning of the film, when Davis glances over at a picture of her son, and has to look away fast...oh my god that scene just broke my heart! The ending is very sad too so make sure you have some tissues nearby! The Help is a heartwarming drama, and it's even better the second time around!

1391390,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B004A8ZWVK,A Forest Fan,"[6, 27]","I hope the book brings people together better than the movie. White people of the early sixties are depicted as the most demonically evil creatures who ever cursed the surface of the earth, or at least the whites who lived in Jackson, Mississippi. African Americans are sainted portraits of nobility, standing taller than a granite statue of MLK jr. It is as if Pleasantville had been crossed with the Stepford Wives and Uncle Tom's Cabin. Heck, Simon Legree is a nicer person than the society people of Jackson Miss in this film. This is history the modern Hollywood way, crafted to win the stars Oscars and make the audience feel guilty for things that didn't happen.Did black maids in the sixties really get fired for using the same toilet they cleaned every day? Did white people really all live in mansions and have servants in the deep south? In reality, the deep poverty and squalor that one sees in Hollywood depictions of the south was equally shared by poor whites who lived in those times, too. In Hollywood, they seem to confuse the utter servility of slaves from the 1800s with how people got along in the sixties. I got news for you, Hollywood: Rich people tend to treat all of their employees equally, like servants. My mother worked $5 an hour for a domineering woman who expected her to be a secretary, janitor, housekeeper, and babysitter. And the skin color didn't matter, that's how some rich people abuse their power.I cannot see how any person of any ethnicity can walk away from this movie thinking that it betters race relations. The Reverend Jesse Jackson famously spit in white diner's food in the sixties when he worked at a restaurant. I can see this movie leaving minorities with a similar attitude, isn't that healing? The movie could have explored how today hispanics are lumped into maid jobs that once belonged to blacks, but that would get in the way of the message. This movie isn't a statement against hate, it is hate personified. I sincerely hope the book has a better message than the dumbed-down movie I just saw.For the younger people who were not actually alive in those times (such as the Hollywood types who wrote this screenplay), there's a wealth of reading material out there to see the real history of the civil rights era of the sixties as it happened. Read the Reverend Ralph Abernathy's autobiography, go watch MLK jr's speech at the Washington Mall, or read Malcolm X's excellent autobiography (written with Root's Alex Haley). Heck, go get the DVD of Roots, it says far more about the factual history of this country than this movie ever could.The message of ""The Help"" is that black people should hate whites even more, and whites should feel guilty for ever having been born. It might be a featured selection for Michelle Obama's bridge club, didn't she say repeatedly that only now is she proud of this country? I think this movie shows how fractured race relations are today, not of yesteryear. In that is its only value, for it shows how Hollywood views America today. And it's ugly. Sorry I paid money for it, thinking it would make a nice Christmas gift.On a totally separate matter, the DVD itself probably has the most poorly designed menu ever created in the history of DVD entertainment. The DVD opens by asking what language you want. Once you select that, you are given a forced advertisement warning against pirating movies. There is no option to skip. Then you are forced to watch movie previews. If you choose the MENU option to get out of it, it dumps you back into the previews. Hitting NEXT repeatedly finally got me the movie. When you play that, you have to sit through no less than four copyright and anti-piracy notices before the movie will even start. I would remind the movie studio that a pirate has to put up with none of this garbage, they can start watching the movie immediately. Why are legitimate buyers PUNISHED with all of this nonsense? We legally bought the DVD, yet we're punished for buying it! Thumbs down to whomever put this DVD package together, they should have stricken you of your multimedia degree.",2,This improves race relations?,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,4098,"['hope', 'book', 'people', 'together', 'better', 'movie', 'White', 'people', 'early', 'sixties', 'are', 'depicted', 'most', 'demonically', 'evil', 'creatures', 'who', 'ever', 'cursed', 'surface', 'earth', 'least', 'whites', 'who', 'lived', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'sainted', 'portraits', 'nobility', 'standing', 'taller', 'granite', 'statue', 'MLK', 'jr', 'Pleasantville', 'had', 'been', 'crossed', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'Cabin', 'Heck', 'Simon', 'Legree', 'nicer', 'person', 'society', 'people', 'Jackson', 'Miss', 'film', 'history', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'crafted', 'win', 'stars', 'Oscars', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'guilty', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.Did', 'black', 'maids', 'sixties', 'really', 'get', 'fired', 'using', 'same', 'toilet', 'cleaned', 'day', 'Did', 'white', 'people', 'really', 'live', 'mansions', 'have', 'servants', 'deep', 'south', 'reality', 'deep', 'poverty', 'squalor', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'depictions', 'south', 'was', 'equally', 'shared', 'poor', 'whites', 'who', 'lived', 'times', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'seem', 'confuse', 'utter', 'servility', 'slaves', '1800s', 'how', 'people', 'got', 'along', 'sixties', 'got', 'news', 'Hollywood', 'Rich', 'people', 'tend', 'treat', 'employees', 'equally', 'servants', 'mother', 'worked', '5', 'hour', 'domineering', 'woman', 'who', 'expected', 'be', 'secretary', 'janitor', 'housekeeper', 'babysitter', 'skin', 'color', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'rich', 'people', 'abuse', 'power.I', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'person', 'ethnicity', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'thinking', 'race', 'relations', 'Reverend', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'famously', 'white', 'diner', 'food', 'sixties', 'when', 'worked', 'restaurant', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'leaving', 'minorities', 'similar', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'healing', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'how', 'today', 'hispanics', 'are', 'lumped', 'maid', 'jobs', 'once', 'belonged', 'blacks', 'would', 'get', 'way', 'message', 'movie', ""n't"", 'statement', 'hate', 'hate', 'personified', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'book', 'better', 'message', 'dumbed-down', 'movie', 'just', 'saw.For', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'actually', 'alive', 'times', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'wealth', 'reading', 'material', 'there', 'see', 'real', 'history', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'sixties', 'happened', 'Read', 'Reverend', 'Ralph', 'Abernathy', 'autobiography', 'go', 'watch', 'MLK', 'jr', 'speech', 'Washington', 'Mall', 'read', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'excellent', 'autobiography', 'written', 'Root', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'Heck', 'go', 'get', 'DVD', 'Roots', 'far', 'more', 'factual', 'history', 'country', 'movie', 'ever', 'could.The', 'message', 'Help', 'black', 'people', 'should', 'hate', 'whites', 'even', 'more', 'whites', 'should', 'feel', 'guilty', 'ever', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'might', 'be', 'featured', 'selection', 'Michelle', 'Obama', 'bridge', 'club', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'repeatedly', 'only', 'now', 'proud', 'country', 'think', 'movie', 'how', 'fractured', 'race', 'relations', 'are', 'today', 'not', 'yesteryear', 'only', 'value', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'America', 'today', 'ugly', 'Sorry', 'paid', 'money', 'thinking', 'would', 'make', 'nice', 'Christmas', 'gift.On', 'totally', 'separate', 'matter', 'DVD', 'probably', 'most', 'poorly', 'designed', 'menu', 'ever', 'created', 'history', 'DVD', 'entertainment', 'DVD', 'opens', 'asking', 'what', 'language', 'want', 'Once', 'select', 'are', 'given', 'forced', 'advertisement', 'warning', 'pirating', 'movies', 'option', 'skip', 'Then', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'movie', 'previews', 'choose', 'MENU', 'option', 'get', 'back', 'previews', 'Hitting', 'NEXT', 'repeatedly', 'finally', 'got', 'movie', 'When', 'play', 'have', 'sit', 'less', 'four', 'copyright', 'anti-piracy', 'notices', 'movie', 'will', 'even', 'start', 'would', 'remind', 'movie', 'studio', 'pirate', 'put', 'up', 'none', 'garbage', 'can', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'immediately', 'Why', 'are', 'legitimate', 'buyers', 'PUNISHED', 'nonsense', 'legally', 'bought', 'DVD', 'yet', ""'re"", 'punished', 'buying', 'Thumbs', 'down', 'whomever', 'put', 'DVD', 'package', 'together', 'should', 'have', 'stricken', 'multimedia', 'degree']",N/A

Based on the novel of the same name by Kathryn Stockett, The Help stars Emma Stone as Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, an intrepid young journalist during Civil Rights era America who decides to write a surely controversial novel about the experiences of black maids from the maids' perspectives. During the course of her interviews, Skeeter befriends her subjects and an unlikely bond develops, lending Skeeter's project a new sense of import and purpose. Though I felt the film somewhat glossed over its racial themes, the power of the performances, including superb turns by co-stars Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, helped to elevate the picture to 3 stars.

1391396,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B004A8ZWVK,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[0, 2]","Although I didn't read Kathryn Stockett'sThe Help Deluxe Editionbook, I found Tate Taylor's movie THE HELP very touching and entertaining. The movie does touch on racism in the south during the 60s, but it isn't necessarily about racism; the film is really a moving tribute to the real women who were the ""help"" by giving them a voice.In a nutshell, the movie is told through the words of ""Aibileen Clark"" (played by Viola Davis) as she tells her story to ""Skeeter Phelan"" (played by Emma Stone) who wants to become a reporter and finds the perfect angle to a story: getting the point-of-view from the perspective of the maids. Skeeter also gets stories from Aibileen's best friend, ""Minny Jackson"" (played brilliantly by Octavia Spencer), but it isn't just to get a job: Skeeter's own nanny/maid ""Constantine"" (played by Cicely Tyson) suddenly disappears without saying a word and leaves Skeeter with a broken heart and many unanswered questions.For those of us not born in the South, I think that it's not so unusual for white children to be brought up with black nannies. I have a friend who was born in the south and a black woman raised him, although he had both parents around, and in the special features, both Stockett and Taylor (director) grew up with black nannies. So it seems unusual to me, but perhaps it isn't that unusual at all.Anyway, the movie also touches on the friendships that happens between the women, regardless of color. I wouldn't go so far as to call it this generation'sThe Color Purple (Two-Disc Special Edition), but there are shades of it. Remember, the movie (like TCP) is a snap shot of a time and place, and isn't meant to be a criticism or analysis of people but rather showing the human spirit as it is able to rise above the challenges of life.*****  SPECIAL FEATURES  ******""Making of The Help: From Friendship To Film"" -- 23:25-minutes FeaturetteInterviews with the director, Tate Taylor, author of the book Kathryn Stockett, actors Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and others, and private homeowner Jack Johnson whose house was used in the movie.

1391397,AGEIT17HENDIS,B004A8ZWVK,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 3]","Every once in a while I get thrown off by a film. No, not the usual disappointment of a hyped movie that goes flat. Or films that come out of nowhere to attract my attention against all reason like the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series. Here my dilemma is of a different sort. And, perhaps, I have only myself to blame. See, I saw the film under review, The Help, under ""false pretenses."" As a short-cut for not having to read the book, a book about the trials and tribulations of black maids and their junior league jim crow employers having their stories publicized, once someone told me that the film pretty well followed the lines of the book. Of course not reading the book before-hand meant that while I was vaguely familiar with the theme I was not prepared for what was to come.And this is where taking a short-cut, while not always fatal, played me false this time. Not that there was anything particularly wrong with the film as a piece of feel good, moral uplift, pseudo-post racial society fluff. At that level it did what one reading the novel would have expected (according to my source who had read the book and seen the film). See the time frame of the film, in the cauldron of the black civil rights movement down South in Mississippi burning in 1963 or so is all wrong for the light-hearted treatment. So it is very hard, very, very hard for a man of the ""generation of `68"" to take in a ""fluff"" film about those very maids, gardeners, janitors, steelworker, laundresses, and seamstresses who, along with the SNCC students, formed the core of the civil rights struggle back then. So maybe, just maybe in another fifty or one hundred years when we are meaningfully closer to that post-racial society that some benighted politicians and academic keep heralding this film might seem  appropriate look at a primitive time well past.

The true stars are Viola Davis (Doubt) and Octavia Spencer (Dinner for Schmucks), who play maids Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, respectively. Both drive this film with wonderful performances, bringing their characters to life. The previews make the film look like it revolves mostly around Stone's character Skeeter, but it is both of these maids who truly make the movie. Also noteworthy are Jessica Chastain (The Debt) as outcast socialite Celia Foote, and Bryce Dallas Howard, continuing her 2011 wretched characters (see50/50), as antagonist Hilly Holbrook; after seeing her confrontation with ex-maid Jackson, I will never look at pie the same way again. The best thing about this film -- besides the performances -- is the story, which provides a snapshot to a way of life that most of the newer, younger generation do not truly know or acknowledge.

1391412,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004A8ZWVK,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 7]","You can chunk this in that pile of `films to make you hate white people', for `The Help' really exposes to our generation the cruelty and just plain overwhelming ignorance of our forefathers.  Yes, racism is in full swing in this recent adaptation (and current Oscar contender), adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name.  That isn't to say that `The Help' is a complete downer of a film, because at its heart this is an inspirational (of sorts) film filled with love, hope, redemption and humor.But MY GOD this script is all sorts of awful.I'm just going to get out with the obvious.  `The Help' is rather mediocre.  The dialog is simplistic, the character development is minimal, the characterizations are complete clich&eacute;s and overblown caricatures and the actual plot is somewhat insulting in a way.  I can't get behind Hollywood's fixation on seeking white redemption through a barrage of race-related films where the sole savior of the black race is that one white person who sees through it all.  I mean, I know that not all whites were evil (and I'm white, so don't think that I'm coming from another vantage point here) but it is somewhat ridiculous that blacks are so often portrayed as helpless in these types of films.  They lack all convictions and courage until some bullheaded white person stokes their fire.  Sure, the fact of the matter is that these poor people were segregated in a `white world' and thus at the mercy of ignorant fools who thought so little of them as a whole, but they fought for their own rights and they made the difference for themselves.  `The Help' tries to spin that thought process towards the end, especially with regards to Aibileen, but this is certainly centered around Skeeter and the difference `she' made.With that said, the acting here is largely triumphant and thanks to the dedicated performances, this film shines brightly.Viola Davis is phenomenal as Aibileen.  The way she evokes such rich emotional depths in a film that is surrounded with shallowness is remarkable.  Jessica Chastain is funny, bubbly and, at her core, shatteringly heartbreaking.  Her loneliness and despair is masked by her airheaded demeanor, and she colors all her shades very well.  Octavia Spencer is witty and grounded as the comic relief here, and while I didn't find the depth I wanted to in her performance, she absolutely delivers the best line readings here.  Bryce Dallas Howard plays a ridiculous clich&eacute; of a woman, hardened and horrible, and yet she nails the tone perfectly.

1391430,A3D4ZIEM6OZ98A,B004A8ZWVK,Atrab Aon&lt;3,"[0, 0]","The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, was a fantastic movie. The acting was marvelous, the plot was more than interesting, and the message was one that needed to be heard by all, no matter the color of their skin. The movie, which took place in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1962, was about the black maids that worked for the (sometimes) rich white women. The employers, such as Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), are not always so nice to their maids, Minny (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen (Viola Davis). Along comes Skeeter (Emma Stone), aspiring novelist and journalist, who is currently stuck with a job writing a housekeeping column for the Jackson Journal. Skeeter's idea, to write an anonymous book about what it is like being a black maid in Jackson, first does not go over well with the maids; it's just too dangerous. Slowly, they join this project, but meanwhile, they all have to deal with issues, like money, family issues, and crazy or mean employers. This movie was based on the book by the same name by Kathryn Stockett. As I read the book before seeing the movie, I wondered what parts they would keep and what they would take out. Obviously, not everything could stay- it was a 525 page novel squeezed into a two and a half hour movie. I was very impressed by the way that they used direct quotes from the book in the movie. The message, one of how anybody can be equals, no matter their race, was a very important one that people should take through their whole lives with them. People think that nowadays, now that we have laws against segregation, racism has suddenly just evaporated from the world. There was one line in the movie that stood out to me, that was supposed to be funny, when Hilly is talking to Skeeter, and she says, ""You know, there are real racists in this town."" If that's what she honestly thought, when she herself was quite against black people only because of their skin color, that should make us think about ourselves a little bit deeper.Although this movie is only two and a half hours, for those few hours, you feel transported back fifty years and as if you were dropped into the middle of these women's lives. I think that the length was perfect- short enough that it didn't seem meandering, but long enough that you felt angry at the parts when Minny was angry, excited when Skeeter was excited, and content when Aibileen was. It was as if they were your best friends for that period of time you spent in the theater. The ending was not completely satisfying, as you are still wondering what will become of them, but it really made you think, which I'm sure is what the director was going for.For this movie, I think that those who make up ratings for movies did a good job by rating it PG-13. There is a small amount of domestic violence and the police are very rough with someone, but overall there is not much violence. There is also a scene where one of the characters gets drunk while driving, which is a bad influence for young kids. Parents' biggest concern, though, would probably be the amount of cursing. Many of the characters curse as part of their speech, but there is one word that really moves the plot along, so it is used quite often. Personally, I think that kids are used to cursing, as they hear a lot of it starting around the age of ten, but parents might not want to intentionally expose their kids to these words yet. The ideal minimum age for this movie, in my mind, is probably either eleven or twelve. There really is no maximum age, as I believe that it is a movie that anyone can enjoy. The novel itself was an adult novel, yet when the movie came out, it was loved by both teens and adults.The acting portrayal in this movie is terrific. The actors show a great amount of feeling, and they say their lines with heartfelt emotion. Out of all the very talented actors and actresses in this movie, I would say that the best was Viola Davis, as Aibileen. You can really see that she feels she is Aibileen. One of the best scenes in terms of acting, though, is one without Aibileen at all. This is the scene where Yule May asks Hilly for a loan. Yule May is trying to put her twin sons through college, and she is short just seventy five dollars. She asks Hilly, her cruel employer, for a loan. Not only does Hilly say no, she has the nerve to tell Yule May that ""it's for her own good"". The way Hilly speaks to Yule May, in such a phony, condescending way, makes you despise her, wonder how anyone could possibly act the way she does and not feel disgusted with herself. Aibileen put it perfectly: ""You a godless woman, Hilly Holbrook.""",5,Fanatstic Movie,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,4629,"['Help', 'directed', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'was', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'marvelous', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'message', 'was', 'one', 'needed', 'be', 'heard', 'matter', 'color', 'skin', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', '1962', 'was', 'black', 'maids', 'worked', 'sometimes', 'rich', 'white', 'women', 'employers', 'such', 'Hilly', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Elizabeth', 'Ahna', ""O'Reilly"", 'are', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'nice', 'maids', 'Minny', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Aibileen', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Skeeter', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'journalist', 'who', 'currently', 'stuck', 'job', 'writing', 'housekeeping', 'column', 'Jackson', 'Journal', 'Skeeter', 'idea', 'write', 'anonymous', 'book', 'what', 'being', 'black', 'maid', 'Jackson', 'first', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'maids', 'just', 'too', 'dangerous', 'Slowly', 'join', 'project', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'deal', 'issues', 'money', 'family', 'issues', 'crazy', 'mean', 'employers', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'wondered', 'what', 'parts', 'would', 'keep', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'out', 'Obviously', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'stay-', 'was', '525', 'page', 'novel', 'squeezed', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'used', 'direct', 'quotes', 'book', 'movie', 'message', 'one', 'how', 'anybody', 'can', 'be', 'equals', 'matter', 'race', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'one', 'people', 'should', 'take', 'whole', 'lives', 'People', 'think', 'nowadays', 'now', 'have', 'laws', 'segregation', 'racism', 'suddenly', 'just', 'evaporated', 'world', 'was', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'when', 'Hilly', 'talking', 'Skeeter', 'know', 'are', 'real', 'racists', 'town', 'what', 'honestly', 'thought', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'black', 'people', 'only', 'skin', 'color', 'should', 'make', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'few', 'hours', 'feel', 'transported', 'back', 'fifty', 'years', 'were', 'dropped', 'middle', 'women', 'lives', 'think', 'length', 'was', 'perfect-', 'short', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'meandering', 'long', 'enough', 'felt', 'angry', 'parts', 'when', 'Minny', 'was', 'angry', 'excited', 'when', 'Skeeter', 'was', 'excited', 'content', 'when', 'Aibileen', 'was', 'was', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'period', 'time', 'spent', 'theater', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'are', 'still', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'really', 'made', 'think', ""'m"", 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'for.For', 'movie', 'think', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'ratings', 'movies', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'rating', 'PG-13', 'small', 'amount', 'domestic', 'violence', 'police', 'are', 'very', 'rough', 'someone', 'overall', 'not', 'much', 'violence', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'characters', 'drunk', 'driving', 'bad', 'influence', 'young', 'kids', 'Parents', 'biggest', 'concern', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'amount', 'cursing', 'Many', 'characters', 'curse', 'part', 'speech', 'one', 'word', 'really', 'plot', 'used', 'quite', 'often', 'Personally', 'think', 'kids', 'are', 'used', 'cursing', 'hear', 'lot', 'starting', 'age', 'ten', 'parents', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'intentionally', 'expose', 'kids', 'words', 'yet', 'ideal', 'minimum', 'age', 'movie', 'mind', 'probably', 'either', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'really', 'maximum', 'age', 'believe', 'movie', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'novel', 'was', 'adult', 'novel', 'yet', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'loved', 'teens', 'adults.The', 'acting', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'terrific', 'actors', 'show', 'great', 'amount', 'feeling', 'say', 'lines', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'was', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Aibileen', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'Aibileen', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'terms', 'acting', 'one', 'Aibileen', 'scene', 'where', 'Yule', 'May', 'Hilly', 'loan', 'Yule', 'May', 'trying', 'put', 'twin', 'sons', 'college', 'short', 'just', 'seventy', 'five', 'dollars', 'Hilly', 'cruel', 'employer', 'loan', 'Not', 'only', 'Hilly', 'say', 'no', 'nerve', 'tell', 'Yule', 'May', 'own', 'good', 'way', 'Hilly', 'Yule', 'May', 'phony', 'condescending', 'way', 'despise', 'wonder', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'act', 'way', 'not', 'feel', 'disgusted', 'Aibileen', 'put', 'perfectly', 'godless', 'woman', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook']",N/A

1391440,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B004A8ZWVK,Blago Jones,"[0, 0]","Pros: The entire cast does a fantastic job of filling the roles that they were chosen to fill. Specifically, Viola Davis makes the most of her limited opportunity and turns her character into an appropriate central figure, while Octavia Spencer makes a fine effort of stealing every scene she's in. I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the ""Godless woman"" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naivete. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (&lt;-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).Cons: I tend to struggle with works like this. On the one hand, it appears to be doing some good by shedding light on the sh***y circumstances for black people in the deep south during the time of segregation. On the other hand, however, there is room for the argument that it doesn't go far enough, and that it is arguably still detrimental to equality by continuing some stereotypes. I generally end up siding with the idea that any progress is a positive sign, and the only ultimate ""cure"" for inequality is time, while movies like this (and hopefully real world people like some of the characters in it) can help usher along the process.But I do still have a hard time with dialog as cliche and hard to swallow as, ""You is good, you is kind, you is special."" I can't say for certain whether this kind of dialog is appropriate to the time, place, and people. I'm aware that African American Vernacular English does exist, but I'm hardly an expert on it, and as such I cannot figure out where my comfort line should be drawn with its use. Parts of the dialog in this movie seemed to make, for instance, the strong central figure of Aibileen still appear weak. Some aspects of the script were actually pretty good and entertaining, with sharp and funny dialog and a plot worth following after the first half hour or so. But then Davis gets saddled with lines like that... It really is pretty impressive that she was able to shine through some of what the author/scriptwriter decided she ought to say.Something that bothered me on a bit more of a superficial level was the fact that Emma Stone's character was supposed to be unattractive. I understand Hollywood likes to cast attractive young actresses as ""the ugly girl,"" but they at least generally try to make her look ugly. This movie didn't even try to do that. Stone just kept walking around, looking her normal cute self, while everyone referred to how visually unappealing she was. Let's have a little more effort there, filmmakers...Overall: A number of scenes were indeed entertaining to watch, but all too much of it just made me uncomfortable. I don't blame the movie, of course, for portraying people and situations that are all too real and have every reason to make me uncomfortable (oh yea, and pretty angry). I encourage you to sit down and watch it, and if you are able to sit through the whole thing without being bothered by the actions of any of the white people in it, tell me so that I can know I have no interest in talking to you ever again. All told, it's a decent movie with good acting, an engaging plot, and a shaky script, and that ultimately doesn't really have anything other than a decent message to make it special. While wanting to give it a higher rating because I believe in the idea behind the story, I ended up giving it a 7 out of 10 just because the movie itself didn't knock my socks off.",4,"Good Idea, Okay Movie",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3872,"['Pros', 'entire', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'job', 'filling', 'roles', 'were', 'chosen', 'fill', 'Specifically', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'most', 'limited', 'opportunity', 'character', 'appropriate', 'central', 'figure', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'fine', 'effort', 'stealing', 'scene', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'courage', 'part', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'play', 'role', 'was', 'cast', 'most', 'people', 'viewing', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'see', 'Godless', 'woman', 'always', 'have', 'little', 'extra', 'respect', 'actors', ""'m"", 'struggling', 'not', 'yell', 'characters', 'screen', 'highlight', 'performance', 'however', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'individual', 'incredibly', 'lovable', 'naivete', 'just', ""n't"", 'realize', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'viewed', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'white', 'superior', 'lt', 'sarcasm', 'counterparts', 'most', 'easily', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', '.Cons', 'tend', 'struggle', 'works', 'one', 'hand', 'be', 'doing', 'good', 'shedding', 'light', 'sh***y', 'circumstances', 'black', 'people', 'deep', 'south', 'time', 'segregation', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'room', 'argument', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'arguably', 'still', 'detrimental', 'equality', 'continuing', 'stereotypes', 'generally', 'end', 'up', 'siding', 'idea', 'progress', 'positive', 'sign', 'only', 'ultimate', 'cure', 'inequality', 'time', 'movies', 'hopefully', 'real', 'world', 'people', 'characters', 'can', 'help', 'usher', 'process.But', 'do', 'still', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'dialog', 'cliche', 'hard', 'swallow', 'good', 'kind', 'special', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'certain', 'kind', 'dialog', 'appropriate', 'time', 'place', 'people', ""'m"", 'aware', 'African', 'American', 'Vernacular', 'English', 'exist', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'expert', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'comfort', 'line', 'should', 'be', 'drawn', 'use', 'Parts', 'dialog', 'movie', 'seemed', 'make', 'instance', 'strong', 'central', 'figure', 'Aibileen', 'still', 'appear', 'weak', 'aspects', 'script', 'were', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertaining', 'sharp', 'funny', 'dialog', 'plot', 'worth', 'following', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'then', 'Davis', 'saddled', 'lines', 'really', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'was', 'able', 'shine', 'what', 'author/scriptwriter', 'decided', 'ought', 'say.Something', 'bothered', 'bit', 'more', 'superficial', 'level', 'was', 'fact', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'unattractive', 'understand', 'Hollywood', 'likes', 'cast', 'attractive', 'young', 'actresses', 'ugly', 'girl', 'least', 'generally', 'try', 'make', 'look', 'ugly', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'do', 'Stone', 'just', 'kept', 'walking', 'around', 'looking', 'normal', 'cute', 'self', 'everyone', 'referred', 'how', 'visually', 'unappealing', 'was', 'Let', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'there', 'filmmakers', 'Overall', 'number', 'scenes', 'were', 'indeed', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'movie', 'course', 'portraying', 'people', 'situations', 'are', 'too', 'real', 'have', 'reason', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'oh', 'yea', 'pretty', 'angry', 'encourage', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'are', 'able', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'being', 'bothered', 'actions', 'white', 'people', 'tell', 'can', 'know', 'have', 'interest', 'talking', 'ever', 'again', 'told', 'decent', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'engaging', 'plot', 'shaky', 'script', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'other', 'decent', 'message', 'make', 'special', 'wanting', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'believe', 'idea', 'story', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', '7', '10', 'just', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'socks', 'off']",N/A

After hearing a commentator talk about it, I had almost decided not to watch it, but I'm glad I did. I'm old enough to have lived through the time period covered. What I observed as a small child was only the tip of the iceberg. This movie brought out so much more that I just hadn't noticed or thought about. While the movie itself was done in an entertaining manner, I just have a sick feeling. I don't think I'll ever forget some of the scenes.I recommend the movie, and that's the bottom line.Years ago I got my first job, downtown, when I was 16 years old. The job was too hard for me and after a couple of days I was let go. As I waited for the bus in the department store lounge with a dozen or so other people, I picked up the phone and called my mom. I could only blurt out the words, ""Mom, I lost my job"" and just started crying. Nobody else in that room said anything or reacted. A very large black woman jumped out of her chair and just came over and held me while I cried. She kept saying, ""Oh, you poor sweet little child. You sweet little angel."" That woman was the first black person I had ever been close to, and I immediately loved her. She and her family are still in my prayers today, many years later. Now, after watching this movie, I have so many thoughts about what her life was like back then. She was in the same position as the women in this film. She had to know that I, a little white teenaged girl, had so many more job options than she would ever have, but she took the time to comfort me with everything she had to offer, and it was a great blessing to me.I'm going to be thinking about The Help for a long time.

Let's navelgaze at how bad our past was and congratulate ourselves for not employing illegal aliens as maids now...oops, OK, well, we treat our maids well and pay them union wages...Oh, we don't...Oh, never mind, just watch this movie then."" I guess that means the movie about Latino or Filipina maids abused and bullied across the globe will come out in 2062.Anyway, I found the actual movie ponderously slow. It takes a full hour and a half of buildup to get interesting. Why so much back story? We get it. Pick up the pace!The acting is overall good bar Dallas Bryce Howard who can't act her way out of a paper bag. The token bone of a love ""story"" for Emma Stone was unnecessary and seemed completely irrelevant. There is a distinctive lack of males in this chick flick overall and even the abusive husband of one of the maids we never even see. Not that the one scene is not effective but it was like they wanted to show an African-American world where men only existed offscreen. In fact the major references were news stories of the time shown in a magazine article on Medger Evers and the TV broadcast of the Emmett Till murder. (Those of you unaware, Wiki both names and learn something of the Civil Rights Movement from something other than movies).The story would have been better served by tighter editing, axing at least 30 minutes off the long drawn-out snoozefest start and having way way more of Ocatvia Spencer's character onscreen.The extras are shameful. All we get is deleted scenes. Come on! This DVD was a perfect opportunity to have an actual mini-documentary on what life was really like for these maids in Mississippi in the '60s. After all, the movie is really supposedly a life lesson on the evils of racism.",2,help me speed up this movie!,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1946,"['Look', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'plan', 'movie', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'pats', 'backs', 'Oh', 'look', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movie', 'bestselling', 'book', 'injustice', 'happened', 'now', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Let', 'navelgaze', 'how', 'bad', 'past', 'was', 'congratulate', 'ourselves', 'not', 'employing', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'maids', 'now', 'oops', 'OK', 'well', 'treat', 'maids', 'well', 'pay', 'union', 'wages', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'Oh', 'never', 'mind', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'guess', 'movie', 'Latino', 'Filipina', 'maids', 'abused', 'bullied', 'globe', 'will', 'come', 'out', '2062.Anyway', 'found', 'actual', 'movie', 'ponderously', 'slow', 'full', 'hour', 'half', 'buildup', 'get', 'interesting', 'Why', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'get', 'Pick', 'up', 'pace', 'acting', 'overall', 'good', 'bar', 'Dallas', 'Bryce', 'Howard', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'token', 'bone', 'love', 'story', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'seemed', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'distinctive', 'lack', 'males', 'chick', 'flick', 'overall', 'even', 'abusive', 'husband', 'one', 'maids', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'Not', 'one', 'scene', 'not', 'effective', 'was', 'wanted', 'show', 'African-American', 'world', 'where', 'men', 'only', 'existed', 'offscreen', 'fact', 'major', 'references', 'were', 'news', 'stories', 'time', 'shown', 'magazine', 'article', 'Medger', 'Evers', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'Emmett', 'Till', 'murder', 'unaware', 'Wiki', 'names', 'learn', 'something', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'something', 'other', 'movies', '.The', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'tighter', 'editing', 'axing', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'snoozefest', 'start', 'having', 'way', 'way', 'more', 'Ocatvia', 'Spencer', 'character', 'onscreen.The', 'extras', 'are', 'shameful', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Come', 'DVD', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'have', 'actual', 'mini-documentary', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'maids', 'Mississippi', ""'60s"", 'movie', 'really', 'supposedly', 'life', 'lesson', 'evils', 'racism']",N/A

1391456,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B004A8ZWVK,bunnyrabbit4,"[6, 8]","Everyone should be able to find something to enjoy about this movie, but you have to grow up in this culture to fully appreciate the nuances of this film. I remember as a child of seven or eight (in the late 50's-though the movie is set in the 60's), beaming with compassionate pride as I handed a mentally challenged, elderly, black man who did lawn work for my grandparents a pair of long johns. My aunt had purchased them for him and they often gave him hand me downs or small items. That day he was poorly dressed and the weather bitterly cold for the South. I remember that his calloused hand felt as cold as stone when he took the clothing from me. Looking back I never questioned that I was told to let him into my grandfathers freezing shed and turn on a tiny space heater so he could undress and put on his new ""warm"" clothes. Giving him the clothes was saintly, letting him into my grandfather's special domain kindly, letting him into the warm house to dress simply wasn't done. I never knew where he lived but it was as if this cold world was his comfort zone and we were not required to change that.This movie captures beautifully those kind of condescending social assumptions prevalent in parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. It was an assumption of superiority maintained in innumerable small acts of ""kindly"" diminishment. I still remember my mother saying that my aunt's maid, who raised her five children, stole socks. However, since she was a good maid my aunt let her ""get away with it"". I never knew whether this tale was truth born of poverty or the purest fiction driven by a need to enforced the social distance between them. My guess is that she found most of her socks the first time here washing machine was serviced and kept it to herself. In the end, long after her loyal servant was too old to work, she was forever remembered ""fondly"" as the sock thief. It was as if that made it okay not to wonder what she was living on in retirement.This assumption of  moral superiority is driven home in the  film when a young maid who ""doesn't know her place yet"" asks her rich employers for a loan of $75 dollars so she can send both of her twin sons to college. She offers to work for free until the money is paid back. The woman tells her that won't be working for free because she owes money and ""the Lord"" intends for her to earn it on her own. She ends my assuring her that one day she will thank her for this moral lesson. In the end the maid finds a ring long lost behind a couch and pawns it. Since no maid should have a ring like that, the authorities are called, the ring traced and maid arrested with no consideration given to the real magnitude of the crime.The Help, successfully renders southern paternalism with accuracy, sadness, warmth and even humor. The film captures relationships bounded by a lack of any obligation to avoid harm and the assumption that those of the lower social order fully accepted their place and wanted nothing more. Moods simply do not have to be contained by those who have the upper hand and it is more important to be seen as ""in control"" of another human being than compassionate. We see this in a scene where the young writer's mother fires a servant who has been with them for a lifetime. She does this because a group she is entertaining feel she is not properly ""controlling"" her servant.In the end, aside from the young writer, Skeeter, who tells the story, it is the socially ostracized ""white trash"" homemaker of the group who first breaks with tradition to offer humane treatment to her maid Millie. This is followed by the writer's mother who is ill and perhaps has little to lose at this point. Skeeter leaves to find her fortune far from home, an all too familiar story common to those young people who don't fit the Southern mold. But the story does not end on a sour note. What is won in the end is not the outward freedom which is still decades away, but an inner wealth that leads the audience to applaud the human spirit as the credits role.",5,"The Movie, the Time and the Place",1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,4025,"['Everyone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'culture', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'nuances', 'film', 'remember', 'child', 'seven', 'eight', 'late', ""50's-though"", 'movie', 'set', '60', 'beaming', 'compassionate', 'pride', 'handed', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'elderly', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'lawn', 'work', 'grandparents', 'pair', 'long', 'johns', 'aunt', 'had', 'purchased', 'often', 'gave', 'hand', 'small', 'items', 'day', 'was', 'poorly', 'dressed', 'weather', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'South', 'remember', 'calloused', 'hand', 'felt', 'as', 'cold', 'stone', 'when', 'took', 'clothing', 'Looking', 'back', 'never', 'questioned', 'was', 'told', 'let', 'grandfathers', 'freezing', 'shed', 'turn', 'tiny', 'space', 'heater', 'could', 'undress', 'put', 'new', 'warm', 'clothes', 'Giving', 'clothes', 'was', 'saintly', 'letting', 'grandfather', 'special', 'domain', 'kindly', 'letting', 'warm', 'house', 'dress', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'never', 'knew', 'where', 'lived', 'was', 'cold', 'world', 'was', 'comfort', 'zone', 'were', 'not', 'required', 'change', 'that.This', 'movie', 'captures', 'beautifully', 'kind', 'condescending', 'social', 'assumptions', 'prevalent', 'parts', 'Louisiana', 'Mississippi', 'was', 'assumption', 'superiority', 'maintained', 'innumerable', 'small', 'acts', 'kindly', 'diminishment', 'still', 'remember', 'mother', 'saying', 'aunt', 'maid', 'who', 'raised', 'five', 'children', 'stole', 'socks', 'However', 'was', 'good', 'maid', 'aunt', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'never', 'knew', 'tale', 'was', 'truth', 'born', 'poverty', 'purest', 'fiction', 'driven', 'need', 'enforced', 'social', 'distance', 'guess', 'found', 'most', 'socks', 'first', 'time', 'here', 'washing', 'machine', 'was', 'serviced', 'kept', 'herself', 'end', 'long', 'loyal', 'servant', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'work', 'was', 'forever', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'sock', 'thief', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'living', 'retirement.This', 'assumption', 'moral', 'superiority', 'driven', 'home', 'film', 'when', 'young', 'maid', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'place', 'yet', 'rich', 'employers', 'loan', '75', 'dollars', 'can', 'send', 'twin', 'sons', 'college', 'work', 'free', 'money', 'paid', 'back', 'woman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'working', 'free', 'money', 'Lord', 'earn', 'own', 'assuring', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'thank', 'moral', 'lesson', 'end', 'maid', 'ring', 'long', 'lost', 'couch', 'maid', 'should', 'have', 'ring', 'authorities', 'are', 'called', 'ring', 'traced', 'maid', 'arrested', 'consideration', 'given', 'real', 'magnitude', 'crime.The', 'Help', 'successfully', 'renders', 'southern', 'paternalism', 'accuracy', 'sadness', 'warmth', 'even', 'humor', 'film', 'relationships', 'bounded', 'lack', 'obligation', 'avoid', 'harm', 'assumption', 'lower', 'social', 'order', 'fully', 'accepted', 'place', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'Moods', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'contained', 'who', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'more', 'important', 'be', 'seen', 'control', 'human', 'being', 'compassionate', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'writer', 'mother', 'servant', 'who', 'been', 'lifetime', 'group', 'entertaining', 'feel', 'not', 'properly', 'controlling', 'servant.In', 'end', 'aside', 'young', 'writer', 'Skeeter', 'who', 'story', 'socially', 'ostracized', 'white', 'trash', 'homemaker', 'group', 'who', 'first', 'tradition', 'offer', 'humane', 'treatment', 'maid', 'Millie', 'followed', 'writer', 'mother', 'who', 'ill', 'perhaps', 'little', 'lose', 'point', 'Skeeter', 'find', 'fortune', 'far', 'home', 'too', 'familiar', 'story', 'common', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Southern', 'mold', 'story', 'not', 'end', 'sour', 'note', 'What', 'won', 'end', 'not', 'outward', 'freedom', 'still', 'away', 'inner', 'wealth', 'audience', 'applaud', 'human', 'spirit', 'credits', 'role']",N/A

1391470,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B004A8ZWVK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","I found this movie to be very entertaining, heartwarming, and an interesting approach to a complex issue.  Having grown up in the South and having the loving support of a Black domestic worker as a child, I could certainly identify with the situations being depicted in the film.  To entertain it may have been necessary for the film to overstate the forces of good and evil and to overly exaggerate characters and their unique personalities.  This may have made the injustice of Jim Crow laws more easily understood by the viewers, many of which have no remembrance of the days when there were separate bathrooms for Blacks and Whites and different water fountains in department stores.To the degree that this film entertains while simultaneously exposing contemporary audiences to the racial injustices of the past, then the film succeeds. Whereas the film makes reference to the assassinations of Medgar Evans and President Kennedy, it is not a documentary in any sense of the word.  For the most part the film shows that suppression of one race by another for financial gain and dominance requires group norms that support racism and injustice rationalized.  Of course within any social network there are enforcers who make sure everyone in the pack follows the pack rules and the character of Hilley is a great depiction of the person who is an opinion leader in a community and enforces pack norms, in this case racism.The character of Skeeter is also very interesting for her challenging attitude to the racial norms of her community.  I think the film made good point that her liberal attitude had its origins in the loving relationships she had with the domestic worker that worked for 29 years in her parent&#8217;s home. Black women who loved and cared for privileged White children were in fact were engaged in the most radical of social actions, love of another.  Of course not all privileged White children had their eyes open to the hardships, unfairness, injustice, and poverty that the White ruling class inflicted upon the Black population. But there were those like Skeeter for whom the loving relationship formed the basis for courage to act against strict social norms of the community.There is a reason I did not give the film 5 stars and selected 4 instead.  For those of us who lived in the era of the 1950s and 60s knows that violence was used against Blacks to deprive them of economic and political rights. They could rent but no mortgages companies could give a Black family a mortgage to buy a home.  There were constant social cues that Blacks were less than human and should be given the most menial service jobs.

In short: Blacks are terrorized by racists (was the rule) whites in Jackson, MS, most whites are evil, some actually care, most who were evil ended up caring without traces of evil (although blacks are still the help and whites are the masters!) and blacks have something to smile about in the end - but whites end up looking like saints!This is pretty much what I expected from this film before I saw it and it was as expected.  I know it goes along with the story, but the black leads were so terrified of whites that they anticipated the feelings of the whites, did not talk back, did not think for themselves and were basically slaves in a new era.  This was shameful to watch, but this type of thing was indeed real.  THe actreses (black leads) were great and the acting was indeed worth of Oscars, but they played their parts a little too well, especially Octavia Spencer!  She over-played that ""fried chicken"" scene too much.  I would not have played that scene.  With all of the hate from whites, it was shocking when we only heard the ""N"" word about once or twice!Of course a feel good film about blacks getting an eas in racism from whites and white seeing some of the light while only one is still a hard-core racist, could not be comeplete without making the black MAN look the most evil of ALL!  We did not see his face, but Minnie's husband was a woman beater and vicious, while the other black males in the films had minimal lines and were all willing servants and scared stright while the black women were strong!  The only strong black man was the woman beater!  This is a trend in Hollywood.  I trend I don't like!The picture quality was excellent and the film itself was great, just much of the content is what I don't like.  Ocatavia Spence reminded me of some Amos N Andy type characters with her eye movements, body movements such as he acting nervous whenever something happened to a white character and he hands almost flailing up as well.  Either she did some great acting or this reminded me of watchin blacks in a 1930's or 40's film!

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","Based on the best seller by Kathryn Stockett and adapted and directed by her childhood friend Tate Taylor, The Help is a personal film that is affecting in its depiction of social injustice in the treatment of black females who served as nannies and maids in the Old South during the turbulent 1960's. As an ensemble piece, it features a host of memorable, Oscar caliber performances.A black female, Aibileen (Viola Davis), in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960's relates a story of life during that period where white families relied on black housekeepers to cook, clean and even raise their white children. These housekeepers in effect became second mothers to these children and did so for generations.  Aibileen works in one such household, as does her combative friend, Minny (Octavia Spencer), who works for the stern Hilly (grandly played for nastiness by Bryce Dallas Howard).  Fresh from college, Skeeter (Emma Stone) has a reunion of sorts with her old friends (including Hilly) from the community.  Absent is the local outcast, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who is shunned by the group.  Dreaming of being a writer, Skeeter has been curious about the life of these house servants and the injustices and humiliating treatment they must face that border on outright racism that has been passed down from family to family.  Even as a child, Skeeter has fond memories of her own housekeeper Constantine (Cicely Tyson) who left one day under mysterious circumstances.  Encouraged by her publisher, she decides to write a book based on the experiences of these servants.  Under the fear of being discovered and fired (or worse), one by one these black women come forth to tell their stories.  When civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, is murdered, it creates a firestorm of violence as these women risk everything to get the truth in print, and the results will forever alter their lives.As a chronicle of a lesser known civil rights issue and injustice, this film offers some interesting insights into a modern form discrimination.  While most of the white community is portrayed as villains and almost caricatures, perhaps that's just the point: that such a backwards culture existed not that long ago.  There are a number of subplots including the attempts to set up Skeeter on a blind date and Celia's awkward attempts hide her domestic inadequacies from her husband by hiring a maid.  Then there is the fate of Skeeter's Constantine that is heartbreaking.As much as the acting is superior across the board, the film does not quite work as a whole as well as one would hope.  The narrative seems a bit uneven so things don't flow smoothly from scene to scene.  It's the only thing that keeps the film from being even better than it is.  In a way the parts or scenes are better than the whole, and many of those scenes are quite good and authentic.  Despite its serious subject, the film does have its humorous moments especially in the infamous confrontation between Minny and Hilly where justice is served!  It is the highlight of the film.There are any number of performances that shine particularly Davis (a standout), Spencer, Howard, Chastain, and Stone.  Even Sissy Spacek has a witty, offbeat role as an elderly mom at odds with her daughter Hilly.  But it's the film's moments that will stay with you; they buoy The Help into our hearts.",4,The HELP and the Women Behind the Scenes,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3353,"['Based', 'best', 'seller', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'adapted', 'directed', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'Help', 'personal', 'film', 'affecting', 'depiction', 'social', 'injustice', 'treatment', 'black', 'females', 'who', 'served', 'nannies', 'maids', 'Old', 'South', 'turbulent', '1960', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'host', 'memorable', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performances.A', 'black', 'female', 'Aibileen', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', '1960', 'story', 'life', 'period', 'where', 'white', 'families', 'relied', 'black', 'housekeepers', 'cook', 'clean', 'even', 'raise', 'white', 'children', 'housekeepers', 'effect', 'became', 'second', 'mothers', 'children', 'did', 'so', 'generations', 'Aibileen', 'one', 'such', 'household', 'combative', 'friend', 'Minny', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'who', 'stern', 'Hilly', 'grandly', 'played', 'nastiness', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Fresh', 'college', 'Skeeter', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'reunion', 'sorts', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'Hilly', 'community', 'Absent', 'local', 'outcast', 'Celia', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'shunned', 'group', 'Dreaming', 'being', 'writer', 'Skeeter', 'been', 'curious', 'life', 'house', 'servants', 'injustices', 'humiliating', 'treatment', 'must', 'face', 'border', 'outright', 'racism', 'been', 'passed', 'family', 'family', 'Even', 'child', 'Skeeter', 'fond', 'memories', 'own', 'housekeeper', 'Constantine', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'who', 'left', 'one', 'day', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Encouraged', 'publisher', 'write', 'book', 'based', 'experiences', 'servants', 'fear', 'being', 'discovered', 'fired', 'worse', 'one', 'one', 'black', 'women', 'come', 'forth', 'tell', 'stories', 'When', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'murdered', 'firestorm', 'violence', 'women', 'risk', 'everything', 'get', 'truth', 'print', 'results', 'will', 'forever', 'alter', 'lives.As', 'chronicle', 'lesser', 'known', 'civil', 'rights', 'issue', 'injustice', 'film', 'interesting', 'insights', 'modern', 'form', 'discrimination', 'most', 'white', 'community', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'almost', 'caricatures', 'perhaps', 'just', 'point', 'backwards', 'culture', 'existed', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'number', 'subplots', 'including', 'attempts', 'set', 'up', 'Skeeter', 'blind', 'date', 'Celia', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'hide', 'domestic', 'inadequacies', 'husband', 'hiring', 'maid', 'Then', 'fate', 'Skeeter', 'Constantine', 'heartbreaking.As', 'much', 'acting', 'superior', 'board', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'work', 'whole', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'narrative', 'bit', 'uneven', 'so', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'smoothly', 'scene', 'scene', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'being', 'even', 'better', 'way', 'parts', 'scenes', 'are', 'better', 'whole', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'authentic', 'serious', 'subject', 'film', 'have', 'humorous', 'moments', 'especially', 'infamous', 'confrontation', 'Minny', 'Hilly', 'where', 'justice', 'served', 'highlight', 'film.There', 'are', 'number', 'performances', 'shine', 'particularly', 'Davis', 'standout', 'Spencer', 'Howard', 'Chastain', 'Stone', 'Even', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'witty', 'offbeat', 'role', 'elderly', 'mom', 'odds', 'daughter', 'Hilly', 'film', 'moments', 'will', 'stay', 'buoy', 'Help', 'hearts']",N/A

I loved the high production values, the beautiful lighting, the shots of ripe agricultural fields in the Deep South. I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable. She's as big-eyed and woebegone as a DW Griffith Gish sister. I have no idea why Emma Stone is the star. She can't act much and she isn't a drop dead beauty. Maybe she knows someone.""The Help"" is about black-white relations in Mississippi in the early 1960s. Jim Crow Mississippi was a terrorist state. That sounds like an extremist statement; it is not. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission planted spies in every nook and cranny of Mississippi life. It aided at least one assassin, Byron de la Beckwith, who murdered Medgar Evers. This deadly serious, tense, historic era is reduced, in ""The Help,"" to a very pretty soap opera featuring magical Negroes - a term used to describe black characters in mostly white films who exist only to provide a means for the main, white character to grow.You notice immediately in ""The Help"" that the white women are all slim, elegantly and flatteringly dressed, and pretty. The black women are plump, older, and plain. But, this is an uplifting film about Civil Rights, so all the black women are noble, giving, selfless, and saintly, while all, except one, of the whites are vicious, vacuous, selfish, and bad mothers. Also, all the whites are filthy rich. Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo.Maybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made. If they interest any viewers in the Civil Rights movement, that's not a bad thing. Maybe it will inspire some to see a truly worthy film series, ""Eyes on the Prize.""Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965 (African American History (Penguin))",3,Pretty Soap Opera with Magical Negroes,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,2648,"['enjoyed', 'Help', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'loved', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'beautiful', 'lighting', 'shots', 'ripe', 'agricultural', 'fields', 'Deep', 'South', 'especially', 'loved', 'exquisite', 'tailor-fit', 'vintage', 'early', '1960s', 'dresses', 'worn', 'white', 'actresses', 'got', 'huge', 'kick', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'living', 'person', 'bit', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'villainess', 'love', 'hating', 'grimace', 'when', 'cackle', 'inevitable', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'nightmare', 'revenge-dream-fantasy', 'downfall', 'Howard', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'soul', 'depth', 'can', 'make', 'cry', 'just', 'walking', 'room', 'deep', 'rich', 'heart', 'otherwise', 'silly', 'film', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'adorable', 'big-eyed', 'woebegone', 'DW', 'Griffith', 'Gish', 'sister', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'much', ""n't"", 'drop', 'dead', 'beauty', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'Help', 'black-white', 'relations', 'Mississippi', 'early', '1960s', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'Mississippi', 'was', 'terrorist', 'state', 'extremist', 'statement', 'not', 'Mississippi', 'Sovereignty', 'Commission', 'planted', 'spies', 'nook', 'cranny', 'Mississippi', 'life', 'aided', 'least', 'one', 'assassin', 'Byron', 'de', 'la', 'Beckwith', 'who', 'murdered', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'deadly', 'serious', 'tense', 'historic', 'era', 'reduced', 'Help', 'very', 'pretty', 'soap', 'opera', 'featuring', 'magical', 'Negroes', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'black', 'characters', 'mostly', 'white', 'films', 'who', 'exist', 'only', 'provide', 'means', 'main', 'white', 'character', 'grow.You', 'notice', 'immediately', 'Help', 'white', 'women', 'are', 'slim', 'elegantly', 'flatteringly', 'dressed', 'pretty', 'black', 'women', 'are', 'plump', 'older', 'plain', 'uplifting', 'film', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'black', 'women', 'are', 'noble', 'giving', 'selfless', 'saintly', 'one', 'whites', 'are', 'vicious', 'vacuous', 'selfish', 'bad', 'mothers', 'Also', 'whites', 'are', 'filthy', 'rich', 'Was', 'really', 'way', 'have', 'ask', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'Mississippi', 'one', 'highest', 'white', 'poverty', 'rates', 'US', 'whites', 'joined', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'struggle', 'performing', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'giving', 'own', 'lives', 'Still', 'waiting', 'feature', 'film', 'Viola', 'Liuzzo.Maybe', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'simplistic', 'overtly', 'exploitative', 'movies', 'get', 'made', 'interest', 'viewers', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'will', 'inspire', 'see', 'truly', 'worthy', 'film', 'series', 'Eyes', 'Prize', 'Eyes', 'Prize', 'America', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Years', '1954-1965', 'African', 'American', 'History', 'Penguin']",N/A

1391509,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B004A8ZWVK,Dave,"[0, 1]","I will not go into detail and give anything away, but this film was unusually heartfelt, not because it so well told a story, but because it told a story that, in my opinion, has not been told enough or thought about sufficiently.  The story, to simplify, is that man does not appreciate others to the extent he should and is much weaker for it.  Man's strength comes from the appreciation and love of others, particularly if those others derive their strength from a source that is generally not appreciated as a source, but as a weakness they feel exists within themselves that can become a strength when harnessed to a will to tell the truth, even when one doubts the courage to be able to do so.  I can only ask you to view this film to be able to understand my review that may not be as clear as I would like.  Other films have been made that are similar, but to the best of my knowledge, few have delivered the story and the message as well as ""The Help"".  You would have to be one cold hearted SOB (which I may approach) not to appreciate the telling of this story.  I would urge you to view it because it so well addresses a problem that still exists in our society with intelligence and humanity that is rare and fruitful beyond what we often have the opportunity to experience.As a transplant from Pennsylvania and my wife from the Netherlands before that, our kids were born and raised in Tennessee.  Because of some of the cultural differences that exist and even strengthen our family, I will make sure we view this film together for the purpose of one of our frequent family dinner table discussions which now include a son-in-law and daughter-in-law, the goal of which is for us to check our thoughts and their alignment with our beliefs and actions.  This is an exercise we started many years ago because it makes for good dinner conversation, particularly when our kids were much younger, but it also helps teach how to have a difference of opinion without insulting and maintaining respect for one another.  But, what is important with this film is its history of race relations that my kids did not live through when violence was the method of resolving differences and hate was the prevalent emotion.  The Help is an excellent film that lends itself to family discussion what those in our family believe are important principles that we want to hold dear even though we are not perfect in out execution.Even though I was not familiar with any of the actors, the acting in The Help is very good because it is simply believable with none of the parts being the victim of over acting and exaggeration.  I felt that these were real people being filmed in a real story.  It also seemed as if I got to know and accept the parts played as real people with real problems.  I also could not detect any deviation from the time period even though the video depiction of the age added important realism to the story.I had heard on the news today that The Help might be up for an academy award but I did not hear for what categories it was being considered.  I believe the film should be seriously considered for best picture.  I have this opinion because the film was so well assembled, with an equal level of good acting, a great screenplay and story, etc,etc.  There were just too many good things in this movie for any to stand out except for best picture.  When I finish this review in a few minutes I will go and check the results and probably learn how wrong I was.  But then I will never understand how those people making so much money must also have the adoration of their fans and the ""Academy"".  When most other professions have to live with love or money, actors must have both.  I guess that's OK if they continue to make movies like ""The Help"".",5,A beautiful telling of a story about the heart of humanity.,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3766,"['will', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'unusually', 'heartfelt', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'told', 'story', 'opinion', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'enough', 'thought', 'about', 'sufficiently', 'story', 'simplify', 'man', 'not', 'appreciate', 'others', 'extent', 'should', 'much', 'weaker', 'Man', 'strength', 'appreciation', 'love', 'others', 'particularly', 'others', 'derive', 'strength', 'source', 'generally', 'not', 'appreciated', 'source', 'weakness', 'feel', 'exists', 'can', 'become', 'strength', 'when', 'harnessed', 'will', 'tell', 'truth', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'courage', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'only', 'ask', 'view', 'film', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'clear', 'would', 'like', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'are', 'similar', 'best', 'knowledge', 'few', 'have', 'delivered', 'story', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'Help', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'cold', 'hearted', 'SOB', 'may', 'approach', 'not', 'appreciate', 'telling', 'story', 'would', 'urge', 'view', 'so', 'well', 'problem', 'still', 'society', 'intelligence', 'humanity', 'rare', 'fruitful', 'what', 'often', 'have', 'opportunity', 'experience.As', 'transplant', 'Pennsylvania', 'wife', 'Netherlands', 'kids', 'were', 'born', 'raised', 'Tennessee', 'cultural', 'differences', 'exist', 'even', 'strengthen', 'family', 'will', 'make', 'sure', 'view', 'film', 'together', 'purpose', 'one', 'frequent', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'discussions', 'now', 'include', 'son-in-law', 'daughter-in-law', 'goal', 'check', 'thoughts', 'alignment', 'beliefs', 'actions', 'exercise', 'started', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'good', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'particularly', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'much', 'younger', 'also', 'teach', 'how', 'have', 'difference', 'opinion', 'insulting', 'maintaining', 'respect', 'one', 'what', 'important', 'film', 'history', 'race', 'relations', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'when', 'violence', 'was', 'method', 'resolving', 'differences', 'hate', 'was', 'prevalent', 'emotion', 'Help', 'excellent', 'film', 'family', 'discussion', 'what', 'family', 'believe', 'are', 'important', 'principles', 'want', 'hold', 'dear', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'out', 'execution.Even', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'actors', 'acting', 'Help', 'very', 'good', 'simply', 'believable', 'none', 'parts', 'being', 'victim', 'acting', 'exaggeration', 'felt', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'being', 'filmed', 'real', 'story', 'also', 'seemed', 'got', 'know', 'accept', 'parts', 'played', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'also', 'could', 'not', 'detect', 'deviation', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'video', 'depiction', 'age', 'added', 'important', 'realism', 'story.I', 'had', 'heard', 'news', 'today', 'Help', 'might', 'be', 'up', 'academy', 'award', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'considered', 'believe', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seriously', 'considered', 'best', 'picture', 'have', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'assembled', 'equal', 'level', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'screenplay', 'story', 'etc', 'etc', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'best', 'picture', 'When', 'finish', 'review', 'few', 'minutes', 'will', 'go', 'check', 'results', 'probably', 'learn', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'then', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'must', 'also', 'have', 'adoration', 'fans', 'Academy', 'When', 'most', 'other', 'professions', 'have', 'live', 'love', 'money', 'actors', 'must', 'have', 'guess', 'OK', 'continue', 'make', 'movies', 'Help']",N/A

It tells the story of two groups of people, the black and the white, living in the same community but living two distinctly different kinds of lives because of the fact of their births.The story centers on the life of a young white woman named Skeeter Phelan, played by Emma Stone, who has recently graduated from college and her decision to write a story from the perspective of the help which is synonymous with the servants. This opens the door to more than she ever expects and changes her life and the lives of many others as well. The story is set at the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.""The Help"" is a touching reminder of how far we have come regarding the respect each of us deserve as individuals.

1391518,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B004A8ZWVK,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","This 2011 blockbuster, based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, has reminded me  of the only aspect in the ""Communist Manifesto"" that Marx had 100 % right is that the workers and the poor can be exploited under a capitalist system.Thankfully in America, the situation can be improved by strikes, labor unions, petitions, the ability to sue employers, and what I would call the Dickensian approach( after Charles Dickens, whose well-known literary works helped reform British societal ills in the 19th century)--writing a good and effective expose.In the Mississippi of the early 1960s, the last of those becomes the objective of one young journalist, appropriately named Eugenia(Greek for ""Well-born"")""Skeeter"" Phelan, a debutante, who, unlike most of her peers, feels there is more to life than bridge games, gossip, new dresses, and babies.A member of the Junior League, she is privy to the unjust aims of the local head of that organization, the villainous Hilly Holbrook(a firey Bryce Dallas Howard), whose petitions for the upscale homes in Jackson to have separate bathrooms for their non-white servants, due the the spread lie(highly reminiscent about those spread about Jews in Nazi Germany) that they carry different diseases than whites. These people who, while in many instances earning no real salaries, and who in some instances are willed to children by their masters, tend their gardens, clean their homes,  cook for them, and raise their children are deemed unfit to use their bathrooms!Also privy to this conversation is the middle aged maid narrating the story,Aibileen Clark( a world-weary Viola Davis), who works for Raleigh and Elizabeth Leefolt(Shane McRae, Ahna O'Reilly), and is the nanny to their toddler, Mae Mobley(Emma and Eleanor Henry). A neglectful mother to her child, Elizabeth, who is a weak-willed lackey to Hilly, is soon expecting another. We learn Aibileen has cared for 17 white children from the time she was in her early teens.In her Oscar winning turn as Minnie Jackson, the maid to the Holbrooks, Best Actress Octavia Spencer is a hard-bitten and sassy woman in a thankless job, and also raising six children while dealing with an abusive and drunken husband.Skeeter initially writes a newspaper column on housekeeping tips, some of which she gets from her girlfriends' housekeepers, and at home, she ponders the mysterious disappearance of the maid who loved and raised her, Constantine Jefferson(Cecily Tyson), an issue about which her ailing mother, Charlotte(Allison Janney) and her father, Robert(Brian Kerwin), are notoriously silent.As the Civil Rights struggle grows even further, Skeeter comes up with the idea of interviewing the maids of prominent families to inform the world of their plight in such crucial times. She contacts Harper and Row editor Elaine Stern(Mary Steenbergen) in New York, and through their phone conversations, we are led through various stages of the project's development. Notable moments in the Civil Rights battle are key to this aspect of the story as well.A side note to this story are the matchmaking attempts of both Charlotte and Hilly to fix Skeeter up with oil rig worker Stuart Whitworth(Chris Lowel). But Skeeter's project will have its impact even there.Encouraged by her pastor's(David Oyelowo) sermon about Moses, Aibileen, who keeps journals, reluctantly  begins her interview sessions with Skeeter, and Minnie eventually follows.We learn of the tragic death of Aibileen's son, Treelore, resulting from racist policies of the time, and follow  the blacks through innumerable slights and indignities.During a tornado, Minnie fans Hilly's dementia-plagued mother, Missus Walter(Sissy Spacek), and gets fired for not using the outdoor chamber despite the perilous weather. It is on this occasion that Missus Walter sums up Hilly's character in one sentence:""Daddy ruined you!""Appearing contrite due to her inability to find work after Hilly lied to other prominent families, saying Minnie was a thief, Minnie retaliates in a way that slaves --especially cooks had done in times past--by placing something unseemly in a food item and tricking the one who wronged them into eating it.Hilly will have the humiliation of having everyone in town know about it.There is a blatant irony to Hilly's presiding over a charity ball on behalf of starving children in Africa while treating the African descendants of her daily life with such contempt.As we discover, not only do those of Jackson's High Society dance to the music of those they are determined to keep as second class citizens, but Hilly's cruelty knows no racial bounds. She placed her own mother in a nursing home simply for laughing at what Minnie did to her.Skeeter gets in her digs at Hilly as well.Another person rejected by Hilly is the alleged bottle blonde, Celia Foote(played by Jessica Chastain with a Marilyn Monroe-like fragility). Deemed ""White trash"" by Hilly, et. al, she is married to Hilly's former sweetheart, Johnny Foote( Mike Vogel), and she is the only woman willing to give Minnie a job, especially since she needs to learn how to run a big upscale household.Minnie tends to her through one of her several miscarriages, and we see the sunny, bubbly beauty overcome social awkwardness to take a swipe at Hilly, and perform an act of kindness and gratitude that encourages Minnie to improve her life.The death of Medgar Evers encourages more maids to tell their stories to Skeeter despite great risks.Skeeter finally learns the truth about her own beloved Constantine's departure, which she is required to include in the book.""The Help"" becomes a bestseller that causes quite a stir in Jackson.Hilly angrily denies the episode that all know pertains to her, and vows recriminations on those responsible.Aibileen and Minnie receive plaudits for their courage in church, Charlotte praises her daughter's courage, and the lives of the three female protagonists take different turns--in one case, at the expense of a little girl who loses the only person who truly cared for her at Hilly's command.But a final question asked of Hilly is one that could be asked of any perpetual hater with a vengeful streak: ""Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?""Aujanue Ellis plays the maid Yule Mae, who makes a fateful decision, Nelsan Ellis is Henry, the waiter,  LaChance is Constantine's daughter, Rachel,Ted Welch is William Holbrook, Ashley Johnson is Mary Beth Caldwell, and Anna Camp plays Jolene French.Under the masterful direction of Tate Taylor, and with an impressive score by Thomas Newman, audiences can review the truth about a not-too-distant time in American history in an emotion-laden and thought-provoking way.",5,"Going Dickensian...Or ""Ain't You Tired Miss Hilly?

1391524,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004A8ZWVK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 2009, Kathryn Stockett's novel ""The Help"" was released and praised by book critics of major publications.For a book that was rejected by dozens of literary agents, the book would eventually become a major hit in 2011 as five million copies of the books have been sold and it spent more than 100 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers List.Kathryn's childhood friend, Tate Taylor (director of the film ""Pretty Ugly People), who grew up with Stockett in Jackson, Mississippi, gave Taylor the film rights and in 2011, the film adaptation of ""The Help"" was released and the film would receive rave review from film critics and the film which was budgeted at $25 million, would go on to earn over $196 million in the box office.The period film would feature a talented cast which would include Emma Stone (""Easy A"", ""Zombieland"", ""Superbad""), Viola Davis (""Doubt"", ""Solaris"", ""Far From Heaven""), Bryce Dallas Howard (""Spider-Man"", ""Terminator Salvation"", ""The Village""), Octavia Spencer (""Spider-Man"", ""Seven Pounds""), Jessica Chastain (""The Tree of Life"", ""The Debt"", ""Take Shelter""), Allison Janney (""The West Wing"", ""Juno""), Cicely Tyson (""Sounder"", ""Roots"", ""A Lesson Before Dying"") and Sissy Spacek (""Carrie"", ""Coal Miner's Daughter"").VIDEO:""The Help"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  The film looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.  The film manages to capture the details of the South quite effectively, especially certain details that are much clearer such as the freckles on Emma Stone's face,  the cut on Minny's forehead or even cold sore on Hilly's mouth.  If anything, the clarity and detail of this film is much more evident, especially during the closeup of the characters and the details of scenery, including the homes such as Aibilene's home as we can see the paint gone from the old home.Also, felt that part of the efficacy of this film was location and costume design.  Cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt (""Closer"", ""Batman Forever"", ""Lethal Weapon"") did a great job in capturing the look and feel of the 1960's and it really helps to find a location such as Greenwood, Mississippi retain the look that the city of Jackson had a long time ago.  But costume/makeup and hair design was well-done and really made this film come alive! And it all looks great on Blu-ray!I didn't see any banding, edge enhancement, artifacts or any problems on this Blu-ray.  If anything, ""The Help"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Help"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHZ/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  For this type of film, there is not much of action.  In fact, the film is primarily dialogue and music-driven.  While surround channels are mostly used for the ambiance of a crowded room or church area, I wasn't expecting ""The Help"" to have an immersive soundtrack.  But for the most part, dialogue is clear and the music compositions by Thomas Newman (""WALL-E"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""American Beauty"") sounds fantastic on HD!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Help"" comes with the following special features:The Making of ""The Help"" From Friendship To Film - (23:29) Featuring interviews with director Tate Taylor, writer Kathryn Stockett, producer Chris Columbus and Brunson Green and the cast of ""The Help"".  From the challenges of making this film and working among friends.In Their Own Words: A Tribute To The Maids Of Mississippi - (11:51) Featuring a interview done by Tate Taylor and Octavia Spencer with Tate's maid and also other maids (and their daughters) in regards to their memories of working during the turbulent '60s.Deleted Scenes - Five deleted scenes with introductions by Director Tate Taylor.""The Living Proof"" music video by Mary J. Blige - (5:08)EXTRAS:""The Help"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD.  The DVD is presented in 1:85:1, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:A powerful film with a magnificent performance by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, ""The Help"" is a moving drama that opens your eyes to the difficulties of Black maids during that era in time.There is no doubt in my mind that in order for ""The Help"" to be as effective for its film adaptation, you're going to need talent that can make viewers feel the raw emotion that these characters go through onscreen.  But also people who have experienced having a Black maid and also were passionate in giving a voice to those maids.You have to give credit to author Kathryn Stockett and screenplay writer and director Tate Taylor for sticking to their guns for the making of this film because without this friendship, I'm not sure if the film would have been as successful as it was.For one, these two grew up together.  Both came from broken homes and both were raised by their Black maids.  For Stockett, the novel was therapeutic to write about her past but also making her think about her maid Dimitri and how she was part of her family for over 30 years.  And while her book was being shopped with no success, as best friends with Taylor, she had always wanted Tate to direct the film, whether or not it was low-budget or high-budget.And what is most remarkable is the dynamic among these best friends but also their close friends around them.  Actress Octavia Spencer worked with Tate Taylor as production assistants on the 1996 film ""A Time to Kill"" and both moved from the south to Los Angeles earlier in their career.  Octavia played a role in Stockett's novel, giving her input (even her disdain at first but as a friend of Tate, she read it).  Also, a close friend was actress Allison Janney who was part of Tate's circle of friends and producer Brunson Green and both worked with Tate in his smaller films.But they faced major opposition because Tate was not a well-known director and when Hollywood told Stockett that she can use her friend to direct the film, she wasn't going to budget.  And it goes to show you how close these best friends are.  And fortunately because Tate was friends with producer/director Chris Columbus (""Night at the Museum"" films, ""Fantastic Four"" films, ""Harry Potter"" films) and his wife loved the Stockett's novel and Chris knows Steven Spielberg (who co-founded Dreamworks), Spielberg gave the thumbs up to the project and Kathryn Stockett's best friend Tate Taylor would eventually get this opportunity to direct this film.And this is what I found to be magical about ""The Help"".  It's a film that features a close circle of friends who believed in the project but also a story that is so personal for both Kathryn Stockett and Tate Taylor and their love for the maids that raised them, that ""The Help"" was made possible.  And for the most part, the critics and viewers enjoyed this film.Not only is it a powerful, honest and entertaining period film, ""The Help"" is an important film because it does give a voice for to those women who worked during those turbulent times.  Is the story perfect?  Probably not.  While the best-selling novel was loved by film critics and readers, it was also criticized by the Association of Black Women Historians for distorting and ignoring the experiences of Black domestic workers.  I know there are many stories of challenges and dangers that many other maids out there but at least ""The Help"" does give people the opportunity to talk about the past.  For surviving Black maids, their daughters to talk about stories from the past and if anything, giving America and people around the world a portrait of how things were at that time.While the film focuses on the lives of Black maids, it was important for the film adaptation to put the mental image of how wrong these women were treated.  While the novel is much more darker than the film and even more heartbreaking, I do credit Tate Taylor for giving viewers some hope with this film, than giving the exact ending of what took place in the book.But if there is one thing that brings Kathryn Stockett's novel-to-life, its the performances.  Both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have done a magnificent job in this film and I can only hope these two women are nominated for various film awards because their performance was outstanding!You can sense the fear in Davis' character of Aibelene as she doesn't know if she can trust a white woman with her story.  You can see the frustration of Octavia Spencer's character of Minny as she tries her best to keep quiet when her boss is often criticizing her and making her out as if she is nothing. It's all in the eyes and the facial expressions and both women are able to effectively show those raw emotions onscreen.As for Emma Stone, it was quite interesting to see her in a more serious role than the last films I have seen her in, especially actress Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother Charlotte Phelan.  But as far as the antagonist goes, it was great to see actress Bryce Dallas Howard doing a good job playing such an appalling role of Hilly Holbrook.  In fact, my wife (who has watched this film several times) was often saying expletives each time Hilly showed up on screen and just loved the scenes that dealt with Minny's pie.And it was great to see Cicely Tyson in the film as well and see how her role as Constantine made a big impact in the life of Skeeter.  But also Sissy Spacek who plays Missus Walters and her jabs at her uptight daughter Hilly were effective in breaking down the seriousness of the movie with humor.As for the Blu-ray release, it was great to have the ""Making of the Help: From Friendship to Film"" which goes into more detail of the friendship between Stockett and Taylor and their circle of friends that took part in this film, also to include ""In Their Own Words: A Tribute to the Maids of Mississippi"" included with the Blu-ray release but also deleted scenes which feature two additional scenes such as Hilly confronting Skeeter on the commode situation but also a deleted scene showing what happened to Minny after the book was released.  I do agree for pacing purposes, these deleted scenes were best left out.I would have loved to hear a director's commentary or even cast commentary included but still, are a few special features included with this Blu-ray & DVD combo release that were quite entertaining to watch.  Picture quality was very good, the lossless audio soundtrack was appropriate.Overall, ""The Help"" is a fantastic film that takes a look back at the racism endured by Black maids back in the 1960's.  Although there is more to the story of what other types of harassment or difficulties Black maids have had in the job, nor does the film focus on the lives that these women have when they do return back home after work, there are many scenes throughout the film that are heartbreaking but also inspirational.""The Help"" is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray (4.5 stars): Heartbreaking, inspiring and

1391525,A20Q4HD6A2B8W9,B004A8ZWVK,Dennis Brandt,"[5, 11]","This is a rather captivating, feel-good movie that reveals an ugly part of Southern history albeit not with sublime historical accuracy.  The blu-ray image is excellent as is the sound, although this isn't an action film so don't expect your subwoofers to leap off the floor.I was troubled by the film's portrayal of Southern women.  While filmdom long ago - and gratefully - set aside the Willie Best/Stepenfetchit stereotypes, it has no problem stereotyping women of the era as empty-headed, evil creatures whose entire life centered around making everyone with black skin feel insignificant.  Stereotyping is wrong; I don't care who the target is.  I do not argue the historical validity of the film's view of the Southern racial system.  Neither do I deny that it existed or even suggest that there was anything good about it.  But I am a descendant of Southerners on my mother's side and actually lived through that era and can tell you that just ain't the way the good old gals behaved back then.  They actually had brains, which no one in this film has other than Skeeter Phelan and, at the end, her mother (who, as an aside, had an awful lot of energy for a women with cancer).  Women of that period weren't the cruel bitches this film portrays, although the real women of the era were themselves locked into a racial caste system that, as individuals, they were powerless to change, nor did they then have any impetus to do so.  I know all you liberals out there will howl ""racist!"" and/or ""insensitive"" at that comment because the usual liberal knee-jerk reaction is to scream without engaging brain.

1391526,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B004A8ZWVK,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 6]","Despite some heart-tugging/over-the-top stereotypes to which some may object as disrespectful to the Civil Rights theme, director Tate Taylor of ""The Help,"" based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett (The Help (Movie Tie-In)), creates a faithful rendition of the story's tone--depicting the sometimes uneasy coalition between the white and black communities of Jackson, Mississippi in the early 60s as epitomized by the voices of three distinct personalities: Skeeter, a young white graduate from Ole Miss whose ambition to be a writer overrides her desire to please her mother and marry, Abelene, a black maid who has raised seventeen white children and Minny, an outspoken black domestic whose big mouth never fails to lose her a good position.Emma Stone trades outrageous romantic comedy for a more ambitious and sedate role of portraying the earnest work-a-bee Skeeter.  Physically, Stone is much more attractive than the Skeeter of the novel; I got the feeling she was holding back in her depiction--attempting to tone down her natural enthusiasm to emulate the book's character--a young woman whose body type refuses to conform to the beauty of that time and psychologically poised on the fence between the generations of the repressed 50s and the more liberated 70s.  Overall, her performance seems to lack sparkle, coming off at times as madcap comedy--the scene where she straightens her hair for her big date and then arrives with her head askew from a frantic ride in a tractor-toting truck--or quietly appalled--her sneaky behind-the-scenes writing fails to indicate enough nervousness that would suggest the horrific life-threatening repercussions of the time period.Abelene (Viola Davis) possesses a quiet dignity that sometimes seems too modern a sensibility for a black domestic that faced the loss of her livelihood, a severe beating, a jail sentence, death or a combination of all four.  Nevertheless, the actress does a great job with her material and will most likely be cited for an Oscar nomination.  In a similar manner, Octavia Spencer completely replicates the novel's Minny and is a joy to behold.Some of the other character choices left more to be desired--in particular, Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother.  Not only was the sense of her relationship with her daughter in the film different from the Steel Magnolia who stubbornly combats cancer in the novel, her exuberant persistence seems out of context for the novel's more rigid 1960s' South.  Here, the screenplay must claim most of the blame; Skeeter's mother shows definite liberal tendencies--speaking of ""courage skipping a generation"" and tossing the horrific Hilly off her front porch as if that would ever happen in a world where appearances and crisp cool emotionless interchanges were uppermost for the upper crust.Along this line, the entire scene where the mystery of Constantine is finally relayed to the unsuspecting Skeeter seemed completely out of character and out of context with the sensibility of the milieu.  Never, in a million years would Skeeter's mother ever tell her about the episode with Constantine, her daughter Rachel and the women's group meeting in the Phelan home.  And why not make the character of Rachel look white as depicted in the book?  Would it make sense for Rachel, the daughter of the domestic, to come to the front door, no matter where `Up North' she was living?  Wouldn't Mrs. Phelan have handled that in the kitchen where such situations, at that time, belonged?  Why ruin the drama of the `she looks white' surprise moment?  The novel's 1960s' Mrs. Phelan would never think twice about her decision and she would never approve of Skeeter crossing the line and writing a book promoting the roles of black maids in a white household.  Obviously, Taylor as director and screenwriter of this film version of ""The Help"" decided to give the film a modern twist that would better appeal to the sensibilities of today's audience.  This almost saccharine-y veneer adds a positive gloss to the book's less descriptive outcome for the three main characters.Nonetheless, ""The Help"" completely absorbs its audience for the full length of its two hour and seventeen minute running time.  Throughout, a sense of fun prevails as epitomized by Minny's frequent and ominous wailing over ""the Terrible Awful"" she enacted upon the malicious Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the viewer's growing awareness and eventual understanding of just what this is as seen from the vantage points of those it effects: Missus Walters (the wonderful Sissy Spacek), Hilly, Minny and Celia Foote (played with just the right ""ditz"" factor by Jessica Chastain).  Lacking only is the feeling of imminent danger for the black women involved in a scheme that could have cost them their lives and a real sense of Skeeter committing the forbidden--the book's scene of Skeeter reading the Jim Crow laws in the library, subsequently stealing the pamphlet and consequently fearing Hilly will see the stolen goods and--oh no--the working manuscript of the maids' interviews when Skeeter leaves behind her messenger bag is reduced to a two second sequence where Hilly glimpses the pamphlet during a conversation between the two characters.  The audience never fully understands the consequences of Skeeter's flouting and straying from tradition.  She is shunned, at first for her misfit personality, her anti-Junior League appearance and then for her outrageousness, but she doggedly carries on her clandestine Civil Rights campaign suggesting immunity to her circumstances rather than the impact of a lived experience.Bottom line?  For the most part, by viewing Tate Taylor's ""The Help"" as a madcap escapade where one white woman and a bevy of black women band together to speak out during the treacherous times of the Civil Rights Movement in the Jim Crow South and flout, in their small way, the traditions of generations will insure a good film experience. The depiction of Hilly and her band of Junior Leaguers as overtly malicious, gossipy and superficial wielders of ultimate power over the lives and welfare of their black servants might seem almost cartoon-ish and disrespectful to the reality of a treacherous time in American history.  However, this is meant as a devise to increase the innate gravitas of Viola Davis' performance--her eyes alone convey a lifetime of pain infused with resilience gleaned by small joys--and to spotlight Minny, although beaten by a drunken husband as she is, as another symbol of perseverance through the other avenue of outrageous outspokenness and familial familiarity combined with the innate mothering aspects of the true nurturer.  Whether or not you can overlook what may be deemed as stereotypical matters not in the overall outcome.  The film entertains with a feel good sentimentality that works despite some jarring modern sensibilities thrown into the ultimate mix that is not unlike Minny's celebrated pie:  rich chocolate-y goodness and pure blarney.

1391541,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004A8ZWVK,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Directed by Tate Taylor in only his second full-length effort, this 2011 period film isn't perfect, but its precarious blend of gravitas, pathos and humor tugs at the heartstrings in a way that makes the story emotionally riveting without veering into the maudlin or being condescending, no small feat considering the ongoing temptations in Tate's fully ripened screenplay. Set in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961 just as the civil rights movement was taking hold of the Deep South, the film benefits immeasurably from its excellent cast, in particular, a gut-wrenching performance from Viola Davis, a brilliant actress who blazed through just eight minutes of screen time as the singularly focused Mrs. Miller in John Patrick Shanley'sDoubt. Showing more nuanced shades of her trademark stoic strength here, she serves as the film's emotional center as Aibileen, a haunted middle-aged maid who has spent most of her life raising white children and just recently lost her only son to racially motivated violence.Based on fellow Jacksonian Kathryn Stockett's popular2009 novel, this immensely satisfying adaptation faithfully covers most of the book's major plot points and fluidly shifts viewpoints between Aibileen; her sassy best friend Minny, who can't help but show her contempt for her racist employers; and Skeeter Phelan, a young white woman and recent college graduate who after moving back home, discovers that Constantine, the dedicated maid who helped raise her since childhood has mysteriously disappeared. The three women's stories intertwine seamlessly to explain how life in Jackson revolved around the co-existence of blacks and whites in a state of casual yet hostile intimacy. The symbol of institutionalized segregation is the bathroom, a firebrand issue led by Hilly Holbrook, the town's demonic debutante who is pushing to pass an ordinance to support her belief that all homes should have separate bathroom facilities for the ""colored"" help. This revelation makes Skeeter realize how deep the racial divide is in her town. Ambitious to become a serious writer, Skeeter pitches an idea to the publishing house of Harper & Row to write a book that would show her world from the black maids' perspectives, an idea fraught with danger to all who dare to participate. Spurred on by civil rights activist Medgar Evers' assassination in Jackson, the maids unify in their support of the book (a scene that reduced me to tears), and it becomes a big success but not without certain sacrifices.Beyond Davis' sterling turn, there is an embarrassment of acting riches - Octavia Spencer's tart-tongued turn as Minny threatens to steal the picture entirely, especially in a hilariously vengeful chocolate pie scene that almost belongs in a completely different movie; an extravagantly coiffed and costumed Bryce Dallas Howard, surprisingly effective as Hilly, the most venal and unrepentant of racists; Jessica Chastain in full-blown Marilyn mode as the white-trash wife ostracized by the bridge club set; Sissy Spacek easily stealing her brief comic scenes as Hilly's dotty mother fully aware of her daughter's character shortcomings; Allison Janney as Skeeter's acidic, status-conscious mother who proves it's never too late to change your ways; Cicely Tyson lending unforced dignity and an uncanny Jane Pittman countenance to the flashback scenes of Constantine; and smoky-voiced Emma Stone, who officially graduates from comic supporting roles and truly comes into her own as Skeeter. The whole cast deserves to be remembered during awards season. Not by accident, the men are given short shrift here. A more experienced filmmaker than Taylor could have instilled a greater sense of fearlessness in the movie's approach, although at the same time, few would be as generous with such an outstanding cast. Despite some moments that border on being too broad, the film represents superior entertainment about a period of American history that needs to be remembered.",5,Civil Rights with a Human Heart in an Emotionally Cathartic Film Led by the Incomparable Viola Davis,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,3988,"['Directed', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'only', 'second', 'full-length', 'effort', '2011', 'period', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'precarious', 'blend', 'gravitas', 'pathos', 'humor', 'tugs', 'heartstrings', 'way', 'story', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'veering', 'maudlin', 'being', 'condescending', 'small', 'feat', 'considering', 'ongoing', 'temptations', 'Tate', 'fully', 'ripened', 'screenplay', 'Set', 'hometown', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', '1961', 'just', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'was', 'taking', 'hold', 'Deep', 'South', 'film', 'benefits', 'immeasurably', 'excellent', 'cast', 'particular', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'who', 'blazed', 'through', 'just', 'eight', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'singularly', 'focused', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'John', 'Patrick', ""Shanley'sDoubt"", 'Showing', 'more', 'nuanced', 'shades', 'trademark', 'stoic', 'strength', 'here', 'film', 'emotional', 'center', 'Aibileen', 'haunted', 'middle-aged', 'maid', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'raising', 'white', 'children', 'just', 'recently', 'lost', 'only', 'son', 'racially', 'motivated', 'violence.Based', 'fellow', 'Jacksonian', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'popular2009', 'novel', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'adaptation', 'faithfully', 'most', 'book', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'fluidly', 'shifts', 'viewpoints', 'Aibileen', 'sassy', 'best', 'friend', 'Minny', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'show', 'contempt', 'racist', 'employers', 'Skeeter', 'Phelan', 'young', 'white', 'woman', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'who', 'moving', 'back', 'home', 'discovers', 'Constantine', 'dedicated', 'maid', 'who', 'helped', 'raise', 'childhood', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'three', 'women', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'seamlessly', 'explain', 'how', 'life', 'Jackson', 'revolved', 'co-existence', 'blacks', 'whites', 'state', 'casual', 'yet', 'hostile', 'intimacy', 'symbol', 'institutionalized', 'segregation', 'bathroom', 'firebrand', 'issue', 'led', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook', 'town', 'demonic', 'debutante', 'who', 'pushing', 'pass', 'ordinance', 'support', 'belief', 'homes', 'should', 'have', 'separate', 'bathroom', 'facilities', 'colored', 'help', 'revelation', 'Skeeter', 'realize', 'how', 'deep', 'racial', 'divide', 'town', 'Ambitious', 'become', 'serious', 'writer', 'Skeeter', 'idea', 'publishing', 'house', 'Harper', 'Row', 'write', 'book', 'would', 'show', 'world', 'black', 'maids', 'perspectives', 'idea', 'fraught', 'danger', 'who', 'dare', 'participate', 'Spurred', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'assassination', 'Jackson', 'maids', 'unify', 'support', 'book', 'scene', 'reduced', 'tears', 'big', 'success', 'not', 'certain', 'sacrifices.Beyond', 'Davis', 'sterling', 'turn', 'embarrassment', 'acting', 'riches', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'tart-tongued', 'turn', 'Minny', 'steal', 'picture', 'entirely', 'especially', 'hilariously', 'vengeful', 'chocolate', 'pie', 'scene', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'extravagantly', 'coiffed', 'costumed', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Hilly', 'most', 'venal', 'unrepentant', 'racists', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'full-blown', 'Marilyn', 'mode', 'white-trash', 'wife', 'ostracized', 'bridge', 'club', 'set', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'easily', 'stealing', 'brief', 'comic', 'scenes', 'Hilly', 'dotty', 'mother', 'fully', 'aware', 'daughter', 'character', 'shortcomings', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Skeeter', 'acidic', 'status-conscious', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'ways', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'lending', 'unforced', 'dignity', 'uncanny', 'Jane', 'Pittman', 'countenance', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Constantine', 'smoky-voiced', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'officially', 'comic', 'supporting', 'roles', 'truly', 'own', 'Skeeter', 'whole', 'cast', 'deserves', 'be', 'remembered', 'awards', 'season', 'Not', 'accident', 'men', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'here', 'more', 'experienced', 'filmmaker', 'Taylor', 'could', 'have', 'instilled', 'greater', 'sense', 'fearlessness', 'movie', 'approach', 'same', 'time', 'few', 'would', 'be', 'generous', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'moments', 'border', 'being', 'too', 'broad', 'film', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

It was one of those rare stories that captured the attention of readers across the board, and garnered critical and commercial success. It was no surprise, then, when the novel was optioned for a film adaptation.As the film begins, we meet Aiblileen (Viola Davis), a black maid maid working for a young, white family in Jackson, Mississippi, 1962. She carries a sense of wisdom, as she raises the young daughter of the family, her seventeenth white baby. Despite the loss of her son, he couldn't get the proper care in the ""colored"" hospital, Aibileen finds a kind of solace through her job, her faith, and her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer). Minny is also a maid. While she is praised for her cooking skills, her sassy mouth has gotten her in trouble with previous employers, and finds her with no job and a husband who beats her regularly.Eugenia Phealan, Skeeter (Emma Stone), is a fresh out of college, 22 year old white woman, who has returned home, to her mother's dismay, without a husband. We learn that Skeeter has always had trouble fitting in with what society, and her mother, expect of her. Upon her return home, she is shocked to learn that the maid who raised her, Constantine, has left the family home, and no one seems to want to tell Skeeter what happened to her. Saddened by the loss of her childhood companion and eager to get a job at a big publishing company, Skeeter decides to write something important. After a chance encounter with Aibileen, Skeeter enlists her and her friends to tell their stories of being, ""The Help"" to white families.The movie is extremely faithful to the novel, becoming one of those rare films that truly seems to bring the story to life.

Gentile,"[6, 12]","Okay..I didnt exactly hate it, but I was let down as, tho i should know better, I expected this to be different from the overly produced overly hyped style of films today. It started off slow but promising, but it quickly turned into a cliche. The 2 main ""maids"" were just fine in their roles, but in contrast, almost everyone else seems cartoon like. The synopsis of this film sounds great, but, if I want to see something involving the civil rights era, I will watch a documentary, or ""A Raisin In The Sun"", with its amazing acting and modest look. I admittedly am NOT a fan of films where the production values are so ""perfect"" that it becomes Disneyesque, and the desire to get it authentic and ""real"" actually has the opposite effect. Okay..I'm going to say it, I greatly disliked this film, the several good performances aside. It's of the Oprah/Color Purple school, that beats you over the head with a huge budget, sweeping emotions, schmaltz, and sweeping score to accompany it all. Sorry, but this just leaves me cold. I much prefer indie, ""little"" films, where the message and the ability to genuinely amuse or move you is much more possible, at least to me. OH!!..and, I could have come up with 10 better, funnier ways to express the fired maids frustration and anger at being unjustly dismissed, rather than the vulgar, gross, juvenile, predictable making of a pie made out of her own crap..I found that not only gross but it had the opposite effect on me, I found it non sympathetic and demoralizing to her character. STUPID. As far as the popularity of this film, well..there's 2 possible explanations: Either I am not only hopelessly behind the times but also have lousy taste, Or: The masses are asses.

Disney extended an invitation to all the BlogHer attendees to a screening at the historic Reading Gaslamp Theater on 5th Avenue in San Diego. The theater was packed with conference goers and Disney even treated us all to FREE popcorn and soft drinks.In ""The Help,"" Emma Stone plays Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, a young woman who is just returning to 1960's Jackson, Mississippi after completing four years of college. In her absence, all her childhood friends have married, had kids and are now living a modern day version of their parents lives, including having underpaid African American maids come in to their houses to cook, clean and raise their kids. Skeeter wants more than to just play bridge with her friends and climb the social ladder. She wants to be writer. So she gets a job at the local paper writing about the only thing that a woman in the 1960's South is allowed to write about: household cleaning.Skeeter's best friend Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) has became the controlling town socialite who keeps all the young wives in line by intimidating them if they fail to follow her lead. After Skeeter learns that her family's maid was fired by her mother after over 20 years of faithful service, she decides to write a book based on the point of view of the black maids in Jackson who daily leave their own homes and children to go and cook, clean and the raise kids in other homes where they are not even allowed to use the bathroom.Skeeter's plans are complicated by the fact what she plans to do is considered illegal under Mississippi law and because Hilly is the town bigot who is pressuring everyone to build separate bathroom facilities for the maids because she believes that blacks and whites cannot even share the same bathrooms in the privacy of their own homes.Skeeter is friends with Elizabeth Leefolt (played by Ahna O'Reilly) and Skeeter talks Elizabeth's maid, Aibileen Clark into telling her story for the book.  Viola Davis gives the most wonderful performance of the movie as Aibileen, a maid who has lost her own son due to bigotry and is currently struggling with turning a blind eye to how Elizabeth treats her 3 year old daughter who Elizabeth considers to be ugly and therefore does not deserve any of her time or effort.The movie follows how Skeeter finds out what the maids are really thinking and how woman, no matter the color of skin or the amount of money, are struggling with finding their way in a male dominated southern society.This is a wonderful, complex movie that shines a light on the difficult way of life for most blacks in the 1960's south.  It is obvious in the movie that most people in town are not bigots like Hilly, but they are so afraid of losing their place in society, that they go along with keeping the status quo and treating their help just a little better than slaves.  The movie also shows the struggle of women in the 1960's who want to be more than housewives and mothers.I predict were will be lots of Oscar nominations for this film.  Actress great Cicely Tyson had a small, but moving part in this film that had everyone crying in the audience as the Phelan maid who is fired after 20 years of service just to save face at a society dinner party.Actress Sissy Spacek was laugh-out-loud funny as Hilly's aging mother who is suffering from early Alzheimer's.  I think that actress Allison Janney who played Skeeter's mother will get an Oscar for her performance as a woman dieing of cancer and struggling with doing what she knows is right, even if it means losing all her society friends.  And also actress Octavia Spencer, was wonderful as Minny Jackson, the maid that first worked for the biggest bigot in town and then for the socialite from the wrong side of the tracks while also struggling with domestic violence in her own home.This is a wonderful movie that everyone will enjoy. It is rated PG-13 due to implied off screen violence, language and adult themes.",5,It takes courage to do the right thing...,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,4097,"['One', 'things', 'was', 'most', 'looking', 'forward', 'attending', 'BlogHer', 'was', 'special', 'advance', 'screening', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Help', 'Disney', 'extended', 'invitation', 'BlogHer', 'attendees', 'screening', 'historic', 'Reading', 'Gaslamp', 'Theater', '5th', 'Avenue', 'San', 'Diego', 'theater', 'was', 'packed', 'conference', 'goers', 'Disney', 'even', 'treated', 'FREE', 'popcorn', 'soft', 'drinks.In', 'Help', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Eugenia', ""'Skeeter"", 'Phelan', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'returning', '1960', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'completing', 'four', 'years', 'college', 'absence', 'childhood', 'friends', 'have', 'married', 'had', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'parents', 'lives', 'including', 'having', 'underpaid', 'African', 'American', 'maids', 'come', 'houses', 'cook', 'clean', 'raise', 'kids', 'Skeeter', 'more', 'just', 'play', 'bridge', 'friends', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'be', 'writer', 'job', 'local', 'paper', 'writing', 'only', 'thing', 'woman', '1960', 'South', 'allowed', 'write', 'household', 'cleaning.Skeeter', 'best', 'friend', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook', 'played', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'became', 'controlling', 'town', 'socialite', 'who', 'young', 'wives', 'line', 'intimidating', 'fail', 'follow', 'lead', 'Skeeter', 'family', 'maid', 'was', 'fired', 'mother', '20', 'years', 'faithful', 'service', 'write', 'book', 'based', 'point', 'view', 'black', 'maids', 'Jackson', 'who', 'daily', 'leave', 'own', 'homes', 'children', 'go', 'cook', 'clean', 'raise', 'kids', 'other', 'homes', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'allowed', 'use', 'bathroom.Skeeter', 'plans', 'are', 'complicated', 'fact', 'what', 'do', 'considered', 'illegal', 'Mississippi', 'law', 'Hilly', 'town', 'bigot', 'who', 'pressuring', 'everyone', 'build', 'separate', 'bathroom', 'facilities', 'maids', 'blacks', 'whites', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'share', 'same', 'bathrooms', 'privacy', 'own', 'homes.Skeeter', 'friends', 'Elizabeth', 'Leefolt', 'played', 'Ahna', ""O'Reilly"", 'Skeeter', 'talks', 'Elizabeth', 'maid', 'Aibileen', 'Clark', 'telling', 'story', 'book', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'most', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'movie', 'Aibileen', 'maid', 'who', 'lost', 'own', 'son', 'due', 'bigotry', 'currently', 'struggling', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'how', 'Elizabeth', '3', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'considers', 'be', 'ugly', 'therefore', 'not', 'deserve', 'time', 'effort.The', 'movie', 'how', 'Skeeter', 'out', 'what', 'maids', 'are', 'really', 'thinking', 'how', 'woman', 'matter', 'color', 'skin', 'amount', 'money', 'are', 'struggling', 'finding', 'way', 'male', 'dominated', 'southern', 'society.This', 'wonderful', 'complex', 'movie', 'light', 'difficult', 'way', 'life', 'most', 'blacks', '1960', 'south', 'obvious', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'not', 'bigots', 'Hilly', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'losing', 'place', 'society', 'go', 'along', 'keeping', 'status', 'quo', 'treating', 'help', 'just', 'little', 'better', 'slaves', 'movie', 'also', 'struggle', 'women', '1960', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'more', 'housewives', 'mothers.I', 'predict', 'were', 'will', 'be', 'lots', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'Actress', 'great', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'had', 'small', 'moving', 'part', 'film', 'had', 'everyone', 'crying', 'audience', 'Phelan', 'maid', 'who', 'fired', '20', 'years', 'service', 'just', 'save', 'face', 'society', 'dinner', 'party.Actress', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'was', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Hilly', 'aging', 'mother', 'who', 'suffering', 'early', 'Alzheimer', 'think', 'actress', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'who', 'played', 'Skeeter', 'mother', 'will', 'get', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'woman', 'dieing', 'cancer', 'struggling', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'even', 'losing', 'society', 'friends', 'also', 'actress', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Minny', 'Jackson', 'maid', 'first', 'worked', 'biggest', 'bigot', 'town', 'then', 'socialite', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'also', 'struggling', 'domestic', 'violence', 'own', 'home.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'due', 'implied', 'off', 'screen', 'violence', 'language', 'adult', 'themes']",N/A

But The Help had a couple of things going for it that drew me to it personally: the primary reason being that I was a small child during the era depicted in the film and I wanted to see if they got the details down right.  But there are so many more reasons to see The Help than just nostalgia; the first is a great story about the quiet people who went about their business, doing their jobs, while momentous events were happening all around them.  The second is a terrific cast of great actresses in great roles, even in the smaller parts: Octavia Spencer steals the show as Minny, she won the Oscar, but she is in some great company: Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, Alison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Mary Steenburgen, and old pros  Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson have their best parts in years.  The third is a great script, based on Kathryn Stockett's novel, that gives it characters room to develop and drive the story, it never goes over the top or resorts to cheap feel-good sentiment; the cruelty and tragedy of the Jim Crow South is allowed to speak for itself.  And for some of the characters, there is no promise that life will be happy from this point on, just that life will go on, even though evil people get their way, and that is a triumph in itself.  There are some ""chick flick"" staples, especially in The Help's depiction of its male characters, with one or two exceptions, they are all weak, shallow and disinterested in how the women in their lives really feel.  I strongly recommend getting the Blu-Ray edition, which truly brings out the beauty of the Mississippi locations.  And yes they do get the details right, bringing back for me  that long ago time of Bee-hives and Bouffants; flip flops and RC Colas, and the Four Seasons blasting on the radio.",5,Much better than I expected.,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1986,"['Being', 'movie', 'buff', 'always', 'make', 'attempt', 'year', 'see', 'many', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominees', 'possible', 'sometimes', 'sitting', 'few', 'chick', 'flicks', 'necessary', 'Help', 'had', 'couple', 'things', 'going', 'drew', 'personally', 'primary', 'reason', 'being', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'era', 'depicted', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'got', 'details', 'down', 'right', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'reasons', 'see', 'Help', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'first', 'great', 'story', 'quiet', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'business', 'doing', 'jobs', 'momentous', 'events', 'were', 'happening', 'second', 'terrific', 'cast', 'great', 'actresses', 'great', 'roles', 'even', 'smaller', 'parts', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'show', 'Minny', 'won', 'Oscar', 'great', 'company', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Alison', 'Janney', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'old', 'pros', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'have', 'best', 'parts', 'years', 'third', 'great', 'script', 'based', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'novel', 'room', 'develop', 'drive', 'story', 'never', 'top', 'resorts', 'cheap', 'feel-good', 'sentiment', 'cruelty', 'tragedy', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'allowed', 'speak', 'characters', 'promise', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'point', 'just', 'life', 'will', 'go', 'even', 'evil', 'people', 'get', 'way', 'triumph', 'are', 'chick', 'flick', 'staples', 'especially', 'Help', 'depiction', 'male', 'characters', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'are', 'weak', 'shallow', 'disinterested', 'how', 'women', 'lives', 'really', 'feel', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'truly', 'out', 'beauty', 'Mississippi', 'locations', 'yes', 'do', 'get', 'details', 'right', 'bringing', 'back', 'long', 'ago', 'time', 'Bee-hives', 'Bouffants', 'flops', 'RC', 'Colas', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'blasting', 'radio']",N/A

There is no daughter and granddaughter of a maid who has had a talk show for 25 years. Now is the time to go deep into the south, to peer through the bent back tulips, to see how the other half lives, to explore the life of the black maid against the burgeoning backdrop of the civil rights movement.Life is not fair if you are a black maid. Some people say fair is foul and foul is fair. Some will not just say it, but prove it.Eugenia aka Skeeter personifies the progressive educated female. Well traveled, broad minded, she hopes to become a writer in New York. Returning to Jackson she discovers that her maid from childhood has mysteriously disappeared.Hilly Holbrook, the antagonist, childhood friend of Sketer, queen bee housewife personifies the status quo, with her bouffed up sprayed in place hair, and a WITCH (Woman In Total Control of Herself) glint in her eye, she campaigns for a law requiring people with home help to build an additional toilet for the help only, the Home Health Sanitation Initiative. She proclaims that she promotes 'separate but equal,' and warns her friend Skeeter that there are 'real racists' in this town. If everyone is equal then why do they need to be separate?Hilly will find a suitable match for her friend Skeeter.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play long suffering maids Aibileen and mouthy Minny respectively. One embittered, tragic, looks Oprahesque, the other sassy.The toilet becomes a recurring symbol, metaphor, inciting incident, turning point. Other symbols include the maid uniform, the bus, pies, the ring, Crisco, and grits.So the sweltering summer of our discontent may become glorious Autumn with this story of suffering maids, and their condition may be made better by writing an anonymous tell all book. It may also be maide worse.Minny caught short during a severe storm asks insistently to use the house bathroom. Hilly refuses. She goes. The WITCH, boiling with anger, bangs on the door. The maid without peeing insolently flushes the toilet to get under her bosses skin. The narrator says: 18 people died in that storm, 10 white, 8 black.When Aibileen tells her tragic story I could feel emotion welling in my chest and while remaining in the moment was transported to Oscar night, where they show the scene from the movie. When Skeeter (Emma Stone)did her monologue, I had a similar somewhat intense experience. It takes great talent to evoke that kind of response.Rarely do you get such a strong ensemble with a mostly female cast, with such well written acting roles. The movie Doubt also starring Viola Davis, got four Oscar nominations for acting, and I expect this movie will get several acting nominations including a second nomination for her, perhaps victory this time.While I loved how these relationships worked, and how the movie plays on our emotions it has story weaknesses. Specifically, the lack of a strong inciting incident. The story could have been strengthened if Medgar Evers was a character. As he lived in Jackson at the time, how difficult would it be to have one or two scenes with him in it, and then we would be much more emotionally involved in the real life event of his assassination by a 'real' racist.Shortly after watching this I watched In the Heat of the Night, and Gran Torino, which I consider a masterpiece, although it's politically incorrect, and therefore did not win any Oscars. It had to settle for being hugely popular. While both explore racial tension and explicit racism through a masculine lens, The Help explores a more shaded implicit racism of denial through a feminine lens. The covert racism of going along to get along, bowing to peer pressure, not daring to risk punishment by social exclusion.If you're like me you may wonder how it is relevant to today, when we have Obama in the White House, Oprah in our living rooms, and Beyonce topping the charts. Racism still exists, except that nowadays we are very polite about it, we may even be in denial about it like Hilly. She refuses her maid a loan, hires and fires maids left, right and center, yet raises money for children in Africa. She says separate but equal, but does not mean equal. If a landlord says to someone I won't rent you a house becuse you can't afford it, or because I have already rented it, or your credit is not strong enough, he may mean something else entirely.Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly could win an Oscar. Her gleeful wicked witch of the West meets Cruella De Ville performance, at first deceptively inconsequential builds throughout the movie, reaching an impressive crescendo. I hope she and Viola Davis can both win by being nominated in different categories.Minny wants equality, yet when Celia Foote sits at her table, and treats her like an equal, her conditioning kicks in and she asks her to sit elsewhere. I liked that her character was more active.Emma Stone could get an Oscar nom. She is a crusader, and does battle adversity but she is not the subject of adversity, and does not have a dog in the fight. The stakes are less serious for her.I liked Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain, as poor white trash married into money. She has no understanding of the social norms, and status, because she apparently was raised on Mars. She has a Jayne Mansfield body.I feel pretty certain that The Help will be nominated for best picture, and the issue of race relations has been well favored in the past for example, the movie Crash, won with a similar theme. What will prevent if from winning is that though it is popular it takes no risks, also it presents the issue in a comedic way. From a masculine point of view, I yearned for a major events and turning points, for some crash bang wallop, but that desire was left unfulfilled.Each year Oscars get awarded for mostly two types of roles:1. A person battling adversity, mental illness, social discrimination, physical or mental handicap of some kind, the underdog. A stuttering king, as in Colin Firth, a mentally ill ballerina as in Natalie Portman, a crusader as in Sandra Bullock, or Hilary Swank, or Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. Hattie McDaniel won playing a maid and a slave in Gone with the wind set in 1863.2. The psychopath sociopath. Anthony Hopkins Silence of the Lambs, Javier Bardem No Country for old men, Kate Winslet in The Reader. Angelina Jolie as a sociopathic mental in Life interrupted. Charlize Theron as serial killer. A racist housewife could fall in this category.If you like The Help, I recommend you also seeThe Debt, a brilliant suspense thriller also starring Jessica Chastain, with Helen Mirren. If you are like me, I think you will be amazed at how talented JC is in a leading role. It's my favorite movie of the 60 or so I have seen this year. She also plays the lead actress in The Tree of Life [Blu-ray] which I recommend somewhat cautiously. I don't know if you will like the movie, but I think you will love her performance.If you do decide to get The Help, I recommend you also watchGran Torino (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray], Mississippi Burning or In the Heat of the night, because all have similar themes with some crash bang wallop.I hope you found this review helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",4,Maids in Mississippi- so hard to

I saw the movie before I read the book, but enjoyed both of them thoroughly and can't decide on which is better.  Basically, they are both good and the movie is very true to the book in all the right ways.The Help is set in Jackson MS in the early 1960's, when most of the rich or up and coming white families had maids.  Skeeter (her nickname due to her height and thin build, one of many things that her mother despairs of in finding her a husband) just got back from college and gets a job writing a housekeeping column under another name.  Of course, she knows nothing about housekeeping, so goes to one of her friend's maids, Aibileen, for help.  She can't go to her own, because the maid she grew up with, who essentially raised her, has left and no one will tell her why.In attempting to get a job in NYC, Skeeter is encouraged by a big city editor, and decides to approach the maids to tell their stories and put them together in a book.  This is very risky business considering the climate of the time, where the least that might happen to them if they are found out is that they will lose their jobs.  We get to meet several of them, including the unfolding of Aibileen's story, Minny's story (the best of the lot and this actress deserved all the praise she got!), and more...plus the stories of the &#34;white ladies&#34; they work for such as the poor but hopeful Elizabeth, the &#34;white trash&#34; Celia who married the best looking man around, and the infamous Miss Hilly, who runs just about every social organization she can in the town of Jackson.  Don't worry...she gets what's coming to her with the &#34;Terrible Awful,&#34; a plot point that you will never forget.Beautifully told, with a great script and wonderful acting, I loved this movie...and ended up laughing and crying in equal measure.  The whole 1960's look of the homes and the clothing was also well done.  But the real winners of the movie were Aibileen and Minny, whose lives I was far more interested in than that of Miss Skeeter's.  I don't know how accurate some of the movie was to the time and the place, but it definitely highlights a moment in history when great changes were beginning, including the heartbreak and pain along the way.Highly highly recommended!",5,Will Make You Laugh and Cry,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2382,"['have', 'watched', 'movie', '5', 'times', 'now', 'first', 'bought', 'wish', 'now', 'had', 'gone', 'see', 'theatre', 'saw', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'better', 'Basically', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'right', 'ways.The', 'Help', 'set', 'Jackson', 'MS', 'early', '1960', 'when', 'most', 'rich', 'up', 'coming', 'white', 'families', 'had', 'maids', 'Skeeter', 'nickname', 'due', 'height', 'thin', 'build', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'mother', 'despairs', 'finding', 'husband', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'college', 'job', 'writing', 'housekeeping', 'column', 'name', 'course', 'nothing', 'housekeeping', 'so', 'one', 'friend', 'maids', 'Aibileen', 'help', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'own', 'maid', 'grew', 'up', 'who', 'essentially', 'raised', 'left', 'one', 'will', 'tell', 'why.In', 'attempting', 'get', 'job', 'NYC', 'Skeeter', 'encouraged', 'big', 'city', 'editor', 'approach', 'maids', 'tell', 'stories', 'put', 'together', 'book', 'very', 'risky', 'business', 'considering', 'climate', 'time', 'where', 'least', 'might', 'happen', 'are', 'found', 'out', 'will', 'lose', 'jobs', 'get', 'meet', 'several', 'including', 'unfolding', 'Aibileen', 'story', 'Minny', 'story', 'best', 'lot', 'actress', 'deserved', 'praise', 'got', 'more', 'stories', '34', 'white', 'ladies', '34', 'work', 'such', 'poor', 'hopeful', 'Elizabeth', '34', 'white', 'trash', '34', 'Celia', 'who', 'married', 'best', 'looking', 'man', 'infamous', 'Miss', 'Hilly', 'who', 'just', 'social', 'organization', 'can', 'town', 'Jackson', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'what', 'coming', '34', 'Terrible', 'Awful', '34', 'plot', 'point', 'will', 'never', 'forget.Beautifully', 'told', 'great', 'script', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'loved', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'crying', 'equal', 'measure', 'whole', '1960', 'look', 'homes', 'clothing', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'real', 'winners', 'movie', 'were', 'Aibileen', 'Minny', 'lives', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'Miss', 'Skeeter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'was', 'time', 'place', 'definitely', 'moment', 'history', 'when', 'great', 'changes', 'were', 'beginning', 'including', 'heartbreak', 'pain', 'way.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The setting of the story in the 1960s is well recreated and it is truly tough to see how the folks in Jackson, Mississippi treated African Americans knowing that the group of bigoted WASPs were mirrored across the country.  To be reminded of just how atrocious racial relations were in the time of JFK, Martin Luther King, JR et al makes of tough watching.  This story, THE HELP, has be told and retold so many times that it lacks freshness and when the story is pulled like hot taffy for over 2 1/2 hours it wears thin.Viola Davis is magnificent as Mother Earth Aibileen but for this viewer her performance is almost matched by Octavia Spencer as her best friend Minny: both are excellent. And it takes a lot of chutzpah for the actresses playing the disgusting wives and members of the Junior League and Bridge Club who treat the help in such a demeaning way - so kudos to the 'worst' of them, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ahna O'Reilly, the smarmy Allison Janney, et al.  There is a fine cameo for Cicely Tyson, and major star turn for Jessica Chastain as the only white woman (other than the author Skeeter as played by Emma Stone) for whom we care.It is a story about making a story (book) that changes the life of a small Southern town in the midst of Social Revolution.

They brought up Minnie's ""terrible awful"" incident and I asked, ""Haven't you just wished that once you could do that to someone, sometime?"" The reaction was unanimous amid riotous laughter.The Help takes place in 1963 -- the same as season two of Mad Men -- but this is set in the deep south, as the civil rights movement was gaining national notice, violence was on the rise> And while some thought the injustices would never end, others were either unaware of them or looked the other way.Emma Stone, as Skeeter, discovers far more than she really thought about. It simply wasn't discussed. When she embarks what seems to be a simple story idea, it grows to a living, breathing work that attacks the social and political abyss to a more personal, more identifiable level. Not only are the two ladies who are her narrativer touchstones (played to Oscar perfection by Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis) real ""iron chefs"" in courage, endurance and moral integrity, they're people with faults, wounds and talent. And a sense of humor -- perhaps the best survival tool of all.While the institutionalization of bigotry depicted in The Help is a experience too heinous to be understood fully except by those who suffered through it, most of us at some time has been wronged by a boss, a co-worker, teacher, parent or any person who held sway over our fate (or made us feel that they held sway). You can't help root for Abileen and Minnie, as well as cheer when the most loathsome character (played to the glorious hilt by Bryce Dallas Howard) is taken down more than a few notches.To me, The Help is also a story about the power of the written word. Yes, it's a movie, and the visuals are superb, but Skeeter's book is the catalyst that finally sets so much in motion. While we now live in an age of high tech and endless visuals, words can still change history, especially when those words bring issues to the personal attention of those who might be otherwise unaware of them.There is no audio commentary on the discs, which is unfortunate, but the behind the scenes featurette is among the best of its kind.

1391588,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B004A8ZWVK,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","If I had world enough and time (especially time!), I'd be one of those people who--when it came to comparing a movie to its source novel--could always state authoritatively which was better. I imagine that nine times out of ten, it really would be the book, BUT according to the critics, there have been numerous, and very notable, exceptions (THE GODFATHER, JAWS, M*A*S*H, among other--probably arguable--examples).  Well, I like to read and am an avid movie goer, but how often can I (or anyone living in the real world) say that we're even in a position to compare the two?  For me, book vs. movie is usually an either/or proposition.  I either haven't read the book prior to taking in the movie OR I read it so far in the past, that I've forgotten the plot.So it was really by almost the sheerest of coincidences that I recently saw not ONE but two films based on books I'd only just read: THE HELP and the abbreviatedly entitled HEDGEHOG (why they downplayed its elegance is a mystery to me).  And, yes, both were reasonably faithful to the original's plotline and were obviously done with great respect--and maybe even love--for the source material, neither really captured the essence of the literary work that inspired it.  And both seemed too hasty, too choppy and underdeveloped.  I came away from them with a certain respect for the filmmakers' chutzpah in trying to adapt serious, idea-rich literature to the big screen but wondering if it's really worth the effort.When I read Kathryn Stockett's THE HELP, it really didn't seem all that sprawling a novel.  Stockett was able to juggle the various plotlines handily, and in truth, they all did interrelate to a large degree. (It's Skeeter's concern of the fate of her own family's maid, Constantine, that inspires to seek out the personal stories of Jackson's other ""colored"" maids and relate them to the rest of the world.  One storyline feeds off the other in a very real sense.  Even the Celia Foote sub-plot which might sound kind of schematic and obvious in outline form(girl from the wrong side of the tracks--or the town line--is as much an object of scorn as any of ""the help""), but Celia is too loveable and vividly portrayed to be simply a plot device.In general, the book's relatively leisurely pace gives us as much time as we need to get to know its numerous characters.  In all fairness, that's an almost insurmoutnable task to set before a filmmaker.  You can't tell EVERYONE's story in just over two hours.  You can hint at those stories, but almost all the characters are going to end up cheated on some level or other.  Everything about the film version of THE HELP seems too rushed, too obvious and a tad awkward. Every line seems rushe: every emotion telegraphed. Even Skeeter's unruly, frizzy hair seems fake.  It's like a bad perm.  (If actress Emma Stone really DOES have naturally curly hair, I'll eat my toupee.)  And, really, she's just too pert and petite and, yeah, PRETTY to effectively play the oft-times socially and physically awkward Skeeter.When I heard that Jessica Chastain would be appearing in THE HELP, I thought that she would be ideal for the role of Skeeter and was surprised to learn that she would be portraying Celia.  Ms. Chastain is a skillful actress who seems to transform herself physically for her roles:  she's really quite attractive in a way that some might describe as ""handsome,"" she has that kind of coltish athleticism that the role of Skeeter would seem to require.  As it turns out, she's also quite good as the sexy, skittish Celia.  She is clearly a young actress to watch, in every sense of the word.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring real depth to what you could call their ""title roles.""  Of course, Aibileen and Minny were co-narrators in the novel, so you would hope and expect their characters to be among the more developed ones in the film.  But Skeeter's role in the novel is just as significant, and the film really doesn't do justice by her.  Davis, especially, gets the screen time she needs to develop the character of Aibileen and establish her as the film's cornerstone.It's understandable that the filmmakers give Aibileen the spotlight, I suppose.  She is the film's sole narrator, and that's a justifiable choice.  The novel's three different voices would have been impossible to convey cinematically. One of those voices HAS to become dominant, and in 2011 you can say it's pretty much high time that that dominant voice be the one offering the African American perspective.That's one of many things that the film really does get right.  It's clear that the project was a labor of love on the part of director Tate Taylor.  I only learned recently that Taylor and Stockett are close friends and that the filmmaker had started development on the project even before the novel was finished.  In a way, that surprised me though, since even his ""insider perspective"" didn't seem to prevent him from taking apparent shortcuts that often don't work and sometime come a cropper, the botch of a job telling Constantine's story, for instance.Taylor can count on his stellar cast to help him get over many of the awkward moments.  Bryce Dallas Howard somehow is able to inject a bit of humanity into the otherwise despicable character of Hilly.  In the book, Hilly was a devoted mother at least, and in her own way, something of a caring friend to Skeeter.  The script, by contrast, doesn't offer much insight into Hilly's inner workings. But Howard is somehow able to convey something of Hilly's human-ness, despite those limitations.  She makes Hilly a little less of a caricature than the role might otherwise have been.  Which is not to say that she doesn't DESERVE that pie...",4,HELP is on the way...,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,5717,"['had', 'world', 'enough', 'time', 'especially', 'time', ""'d"", 'be', 'one',

The new Gwen Stacy leads a solid cast in one of the best films of the year. (However, The Artist earned Best Picture fair and square; I think that Viola Davis should have tied with Meryl Streep for Best Actress, though I have not yet seen The Iron Lady, and that Berenice Bejo & Jessica Chastain should have tied with Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress; it has happened before, you know...two actors winning the same award). Throughout the film, I couldn't help but think with regret over how I impulsively ended a friendship I had with a black girl last year who had never been anything but nice to me. And that I sincerely regret.There was one aspect of a scene that I did not like, and it's probably not the scene you're thinking of. Though I will not say what that aspect is, I just had to say that.I give the movie three stars because it profanes God's name by combining His Name wth a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity.

Leads of Davis and Spencer that stole the spotlight. DVD to own, not rent.The only drawback with the DVD is the sparse bonus material. 4 min. of 2 deleted, and a 5 min. music video of one of the film's songs. Pathetically weak bonus, but then it is a 5.5 star film. Everyone asks to borrow our copy, I should have bought 2.Oh yes, there are SUBTITLES.We attended the opening matinee; we'll view it again, that good. Is `The Help' the soul of 60s era race relations? This worthy film based on Kathryn Stockett's #1 best-seller is equally a first-class view as true for the read. The story of 3 daring Mississippi women is as absorbing as any you'll see this year. The plot is writing a book which attempts to tell the truth about B/W relations in the city of Jackson, between wealthy whites and `the help'; but doing it anonymously. Without being fired or lynched.There is humor in the way the Jackson Belle socialites operate, and eventually react to the book publication. Bryce Dallas Howard is the personification of Bad Girl, Hilly. Although beautiful, I loathed Hilly in the film and book, as you are supposed to. And Jessica Chastain (Murder on the Orient Express) has all it takes to be the scene stealer while playing Celia. Truly believable!Humor erupts in how the help secretly reacts to their treatment. There's sadness at some injustice.Viola Davis plays a slimmer/sexier Aibileen than was my mental image while reading the book. Octavia Spencer is right on as Minny. Both girls pack their roles with perfection.The film has intrigue through the months of secret interviews.There's a mystery related to Skeeter's (Emma Stone) own childhood maid's story, which is a larger part of the story in the book.Skeeter, Aibileen, & Minny are the key book writers. The casting is near perfection. Should be some Oscar nominations someplace.Some other stars too, like, Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, & Mary Steenburgen (Proposal, Joan of Arcadia).I remember reading the book and doing it as quickly as possible toward the end; and praying that all the `help' have a happy ending, but expecting some casualties. With the movie, it is evident when the story is climaxing, and then you just wish that you could make it last another hour or two. An excellent story, but then we all knew that from the book.It is a tribute to the story that you forget it is fiction. How much is real, a docu-drama of the early 1960's of the south (& north)? We need reviews from the real-life `help' of the early 60's. Only they know!If you view only one film this year...this should be it. See it soon, & as the film's dialogue states, ""Before the whole civil rights thing blows over."" That line brought a theater audience LOL.As Aibileen believes, quoted from the book, ""We done something brave and good here.

My wife, however, has read this book and is more into this kind of reading that I am.  After having watched it, she said that it left some things out from the book, but that's true of most any book to movie adaptions.  She said overall though that it was pretty close, from what she could remember.  All in all though, we both very much enjoyed this movie.  The acting was superb and the story was very good and at the same time humbling.  In this day & age of tollerance for your fellow man/woman, no matter what the race, it's really hard to believe that there was a period of such racism in our country...but surely enough it happened.  A dark period of time in our nation's history if you ask me.  We are all equal in God's eyes...it's a shame that so many people couldn't understand that and thought themselves superior.

1391611,A2WHV0YLBOK0I0,B004A8ZWVK,Inspiring Insomnia,"[0, 0]","""The Help"" is one of those films I can watch over and over.  After seeing it at the theater and about five times (so far) on TV, I cannot imagine any other actresses playing any of the roles.  All were exceptional and worthy of the many accolades and rewards they received for the film.  Emma Stone was overshadowed by some of the showier roles of her co-stars, but she gave a great performance as Skeeter.  The scene with her mother (played by Allison Janney) where the two discuss the fate of their former maid, Constantine, brings tears to my eyes every time.An actress other than Bryce Dallas Howard, as the contemptible Hilly, may have played the role as a one-note cliche.  But Howard's portrayal of Hilly's racism was fantastic.  At times, she seethes with outright rage; at other times, we merely see it simmering beneath the surface.  But she is always frighteningly believable.  Howard makes Hilly both detestable and pitiable; her final scene made me hurt, albeit just a little, for Hilly.Jessica Chastain broke out in 2011, due in large part to her role as the innocent and unaffected Celia.  Her scenes with her maid, Minny (Octavia Spencer), were some of my favorites in the film.  One can only hope that the trusting, respectful, and affectionate relationship depicted by the pair truly existed in 1960's Mississippi.Saving the best for last: Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis.  These two shine both individually and in their depictions of their close friendship.  Spencer earned her Supporting Actress Oscar with her feisty, fierce performance and with the best lines in the film: ""Minny don't burn fried chicken.""  Davis, in the starring role as Aibileen, won a slew of awards but lost out on the Oscar to Meryl Streep.  She perfectly portrayed Aibileen's unwavering strength and dignity, even in the face of outrageously racist abuse.For a film threaded with racism throughout, I was surprised at how much I laughed.  In fact, ""The Help"" portrays humor better than many conventional comedies.  We also see the damage caused by all degrees of racism.  Obviously, there is Hilly's overt variety at one end of the spectrum which seems rooted in ignorance, fear, and insecurity.  At the other end of the spectrum is Allison Janney as Charlotte.  We never see Charlotte interact one-on-one with a black character, but I would guess Charlotte would behave with respect and kindness in this situation.  We do, however, see Charlotte succumb to a kind of racist peer pressure, and it's awful to watch.  One could argue (and I would) that Charlotte's behavior is worse than Hilly's, as her actions cannot be explained away by stupidity.""The Help"" is one of the best films I've seen in years.  So much warmth and laughter with this exceptional cast, and I recommend it highly.",5,"I laughed, I cried, I was horrified, and I was deeply touched",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,2782,"['Help', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'watch', 'seeing', 'theater', 'five', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'TV', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'other', 'actresses', 'playing', 'roles', 'were', 'exceptional', 'worthy', 'many', 'accolades', 'rewards', 'received', 'film', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'showier', 'roles', 'co-stars', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Skeeter', 'scene', 'mother', 'played', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'where', 'two', 'discuss', 'fate', 'former', 'maid', 'Constantine', 'tears', 'eyes', 'time.An', 'other', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'contemptible', 'Hilly', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'one-note', 'cliche', 'Howard', 'portrayal', 'Hilly', 'racism', 'was', 'fantastic', 'times', 'outright', 'rage', 'other', 'times', 'merely', 'see', 'simmering', 'surface', 'always', 'frighteningly', 'believable', 'Howard', 'Hilly', 'detestable', 'pitiable', 'final', 'scene', 'made', 'hurt', 'albeit', 'just', 'little', 'Hilly.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'broke', 'out', '2011', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'role', 'innocent', 'unaffected', 'Celia', 'scenes', 'maid', 'Minny', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'were', 'favorites', 'film', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'trusting', 'respectful', 'affectionate', 'relationship', 'depicted', 'pair', 'truly', 'existed', '1960', 'Mississippi.Saving', 'best', 'last', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'two', 'shine', 'individually', 'depictions', 'close', 'friendship', 'Spencer', 'earned', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'feisty', 'fierce', 'performance', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'Minny', 'do', ""n't"", 'burn', 'fried', 'chicken', 'Davis', 'starring', 'role', 'Aibileen', 'won', 'slew', 'awards', 'lost', 'out', 'Oscar', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Aibileen', 'unwavering', 'strength', 'dignity', 'even', 'face', 'outrageously', 'racist', 'film', 'threaded', 'racism', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'laughed', 'fact', 'Help', 'humor', 'better', 'many', 'conventional', 'comedies', 'also', 'see', 'damage', 'caused', 'degrees', 'racism', 'Obviously', 'Hilly', 'overt', 'variety', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'rooted', 'ignorance', 'fear', 'insecurity', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Charlotte', 'never', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'interact', 'one-on-one', 'black', 'character', 'would', 'guess', 'Charlotte', 'would', 'behave', 'respect', 'kindness', 'situation', 'do', 'however', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'succumb', 'kind', 'racist', 'peer', 'pressure', 'awful', 'watch', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'would', 'Charlotte', 'behavior', 'worse', 'Hilly', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'stupidity', 'Help', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'So', 'much', 'warmth', 'laughter', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

Gilligan ""Overeducated culture vulture""","[2, 4]","Considering all the praise that's been heaped upon it--not to mention Oscar nominations and other awards--""The Help"" left me feeling rather ambivalent. Yes, it features some ""very important"" themes and it begs to be called a ""movie about issues"" (namely, racism and women's rights). And yes, the actors deliver fine performances--Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career--certainly better than anything she did in that ""Twilight: Eclipse"" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received.

1391627,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B004A8ZWVK,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 1]","For an award-winning film, I was a little skeptical about seeing this film. For one, I'm getting tired of movies based on books, are we becoming that illiterate and unoriginal? For another, I'd already seen a lot of movies dealing with the Segregation era of the 50's and 60's. It was only after hearing a good friend recommend it and seeing it on sale at Wal-Mart that I figured I'd try, awards or not. Turned out to be up my alley.The heroine in this is my kind of protagonist, one willing to go out on a controversially risky limb to help others out, even at numerous costs. And costs really were numerous. Skeeter, a young woman who's in her early 20's and still single (causing her mother to worry if she's a lesbian) has a new job at a local newspaper, writing a column on housekeeping. While doing that, she's working on another project, a book from the point-of-view of black maids and what all they go through. Well, since it's set in one of the darkest times in modern American history, things do not always go well. A lot of times, white women won't refer to their maids as human beings or women, but as ""negro""es, though a couple times in the film, they're called the more explicit version. Once with indifference to how they would feel, and the other time with anger.Skeeter, knowing the risks of what she's writing, takes all the risks necessary to show the blight, and her editor says some things need to get provoked anyway (I definitely agree). But while Skeeter is focused on showing the blight, a friend is more focused on a  rather ridiculous thought- making separate bathrooms for their black maids, claiming they have certain diseases that are not localized in America (I wonder if that's a nod to the miniseries ""Roots""?), which was frequently frustrating. Well, her obsession with separate bathrooms backfires on her in more than one comical way (in one instance, a ""Yard of the Month"" becomes my comical scene of the night). And she doesn't only have one problem, a maid she fired shows an apology, but just like the overt racism has teeth, so does the maid's attitude, and man does it become a truly comical storytelling device through the rest of the film. I'm not sure if I'll want chocolate pie after this movie!There are many moments where the humor is not only knee-slapping, but also cheer-on worthy. Then again, there are moments that are deeply moving, nearly getting me to cry (I probably didn't have enough to drink for tears), so it became an appropriately-timed emotional roller coaster. Some people were completely likable, even if not 100% believable. Others were downright nasty (including one who warns that there are racists in ""this town,"" yet fails to recognize her own hypocrisy in the statement, but does evil really ever see itself when it talks about itself?), and had me glad I wasn't a kid during then.If anything, the only real problem I had with this movie was, occasionally, it would switch back and forth from when Skeeter was a little girl to a young woman with no indication it switched times, so I had to learn at those random times what Skeeter looked like as a little girl.Her past, each of the maidens' pasts, the racial blight of then, and the numerous story layers and twists and turns helped create a movie that not only got my attention in the long run, but also helped me see why this film got the awards it did.Why isn't there more thought-provoking movies like this out there? Maybe we're too afraid to see where we came from so we don't repeat history?Regardless, I truly did love this movie!",4,The past has fangs... and pie!,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,3561,"['award-winning', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'seeing', 'film', 'one', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'are', 'becoming', 'illiterate', 'unoriginal', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'dealing', 'Segregation', 'era', '50', '60', 'was', 'only', 'hearing', 'good', 'friend', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'sale', 'Wal-Mart', 'figured', ""'d"", 'try', 'awards', 'not', 'Turned', 'out', 'be', 'up', 'alley.The', 'heroine', 'kind', 'protagonist', 'one', 'willing', 'go', 'out', 'controversially', 'risky', 'limb', 'help', 'others', 'out', 'even', 'numerous', 'costs', 'costs', 'really', 'were', 'numerous', 'Skeeter', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'early', '20', 'still', 'single', 'causing', 'mother', 'worry', 'lesbian', 'new', 'job', 'local', 'newspaper', 'writing', 'column', 'housekeeping', 'doing', 'working', 'project', 'book', 'point-of-view', 'black', 'maids', 'what', 'go', 'Well', 'set', 'one', 'darkest', 'times', 'modern', 'American', 'history', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'go', 'well', 'lot', 'times', 'white', 'women', 'wo', ""n't"", 'refer', 'maids', 'human', 'beings', 'women', 'negro', 'es', 'couple', 'times', 'film', ""'re"", 'called', 'more', 'explicit', 'version', 'Once', 'indifference', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'other', 'time', 'anger.Skeeter', 'knowing', 'risks', 'what', 'writing', 'risks', 'necessary', 'show', 'blight', 'editor', 'things', 'need', 'get', 'provoked', 'anyway', 'definitely', 'agree', 'Skeeter', 'focused', 'showing', 'blight', 'friend', 'more', 'focused', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'thought-', 'making', 'separate', 'bathrooms', 'black', 'maids', 'claiming', 'have', 'certain', 'diseases', 'are', 'not', 'localized', 'America', 'wonder', 'nod', 'miniseries', 'Roots', 'was', 'frequently', 'frustrating', 'Well', 'obsession', 'separate', 'bathrooms', 'backfires', 'more', 'one', 'comical', 'way', 'one', 'instance', 'Yard', 'Month', 'comical', 'scene', 'night', ""n't"", 'only', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'maid', 'fired', 'shows', 'apology', 'just', 'overt', 'racism', 'teeth', 'so', 'maid', 'attitude', 'man', 'become', 'truly', 'comical', 'storytelling', 'device', 'rest', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'want', 'chocolate', 'pie', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'humor', 'not', 'only', 'knee-slapping', 'also', 'cheer-on', 'worthy', 'Then', 'again', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'deeply', 'moving', 'nearly', 'getting', 'cry', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'drink', 'tears', 'became', 'appropriately-timed', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'people', 'were', 'completely', 'likable', 'even', 'not', '100', '%', 'believable', 'Others', 'were', 'downright', 'nasty', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'racists', 'town', 'yet', 'recognize', 'own', 'hypocrisy', 'statement', 'evil', 'really', 'ever', 'see', 'when', 'had', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'kid', 'then.If', 'anything', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'occasionally', 'would', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'when', 'Skeeter', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'young', 'woman', 'indication', 'switched', 'times', 'had', 'learn', 'random', 'times', 'what', 'Skeeter', 'looked', 'little', 'girl.Her', 'past', 'maidens', 'pasts', 'racial', 'blight', 'then', 'numerous', 'story', 'layers', 'twists', 'turns', 'helped', 'create', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'attention', 'long', 'run', 'also', 'helped', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'awards', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'movies', 'there', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'too', 'afraid', 'see', 'where', 'came', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'history', 'Regardless', 'truly', 'did', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

The men in the audience were equally vocal because men in this story are not demonized: Racism and ignorance are the villains here.The casting is to die for:* Viola Davis (""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is Aibileen, the heart, brains and soul of this wonderful story.* Emma Stone (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is Skeeter, the well-meaning young wannabe writer.

Seriously, I think I went through half a box of Kleenex, and I'm tearing up again as I'm typing this.All the performances are wonderful, the script and direction are spot-on, and the musical score is well-chosen and evocative.It surprises me to hear that the book is a work of fiction.  These stories seem so real.I am also saddened to think that although race relations may have improved since the early sixties, the chasm in our society between rich and poor most definitely has grown ever larger.Today the one percent is every bit as smug and complacent as the rich white women depicted in this film, and they employ the rest of us to take care of them at slave wages.It is interesting to note that ""The Help"" refers not just to the maids depicted here, but the book they contributed to, speaking truth to power and wealth.Let us hope that works of art like ""The Help"" continue to spotlight the inequities that threaten the fabric of our society today.",5,A Windfall for the Kleenex Industry,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1130,"['ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'say', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'chick', 'flick', ""'m"", '59-year-old', 'white', 'man', 'movie', 'made', 'cry', 'eyes', 'out', 'Seriously', 'think', 'went', 'box', 'Kleenex', ""'m"", 'tearing', 'up', 'again', ""'m"", 'typing', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'spot-on', 'musical', 'score', 'well-chosen', 'evocative.It', 'surprises', 'hear', 'book', 'work', 'fiction', 'stories', 'seem', 'so', 'real.I', 'am', 'also', 'saddened', 'think', 'race', 'relations', 'may', 'have', 'improved', 'early', 'sixties', 'chasm', 'society', 'rich', 'poor', 'most', 'definitely', 'grown', 'ever', 'one', 'percent', 'bit', 'smug', 'complacent', 'rich', 'white', 'women', 'depicted', 'film', 'employ', 'rest', 'take', 'care', 'slave', 'wages.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Help', 'not', 'just', 'maids', 'depicted', 'here', 'book', 'contributed', 'speaking', 'truth', 'power', 'wealth.Let', 'hope', 'works', 'art', 'Help', 'continue', 'spotlight', 'inequities', 'threaten', 'fabric', 'society', 'today']",N/A

I first tried reading the highly touted book but I was so put off by the dialect that I couldn't even make it through the first page, so I don't know why I thought the movie would be better. It's not. There is no subtlety in this movie; characters are either completely good (e.g., Skeeter and Aibilene and impish Minny) or completely cruel and beyond redemption, e.g., Hilly. All of which I could have tolerated, and written off the movie as yet another over-rated chick-flick, were it not for the PIE. The whole thing was so predictable but so unlikely, and so puerile. And the joke just goes on and on and on...ad nauseum, in this over rated, overly long movie. But if you like the idea of a movie where the premise is that a socially sensitive, privileged white chick helps a bunch of poor black maids to stand up for themselves, and in the process, realize how lucky they are to know her, well, then you're gonna love this flick.

This film is real, at times maybe too real for some, for example the not so subtle villain Hilly makes you want to reach right up on the screen and throttle her. The sad thing is that despite the best efforts of everyone, we see that nothing has changed by the end of the film, in fact, she has morphed into an out and out liar  by the end on top of being a first class bigot.The author clearly had some charisma to persuade the African American women to confide in her, this along with relating the story in their own way under their own terms makes for an honest, refreshing film with a happy end that is not all that happy.  There are ups and downs, just like life, but to me the biggest surprise was that the story participants never seemed to be surprised at events as they occurred.  They adjusted and they seemed to adjust well.  I would have liked to have known more about  what happened to some of the characters in the film.  It appeared that one of the main characters may have gotten seriously hurt, but the film never explained what happened to her.

The social stigma of segregation and racism is running strong and the help feel it the most in their daily lives and work. This movie is about an important time in American history when times are changing and assassinations are taking place in our country.Young college graduate ""Skeeter"" (Emma Stone) is looking for a job after being turned down in New York to be a writer and editor. She gets a job working for the local Jackson Mississippi Journal newspaper as a column writer for house cleaning. Unfortunately for her she has never cleaned in her life and has to ask a black maid, Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), to help her answer cleaning questions. One question leads to another and Skeeter wants to write a book written from the maid's point of view. During these times this was punishable by imprisonment and both of them have to be careful in this risky and courageous endeavor.Skeeter also would like to know what happened to her old friend and the real mother who raised her, the maid Constance. Digging in Skeeter finds a world of racism, prejudice and hatred that is shocking to her. Blacks have to use their own toilets, buses, schools, hospitals, stores, eating utensils and prisons. While working for minimum wage and no social benefits they are the mothers and caregivers for white children whom they love like their own while they cannot even care for their own kids as they are always working.One of the best roles in the movie is ""Minnie"" (Octavia L. Spencer) who is a black maid working for the worst racist in town. She is wrongly fired and she joins into the book writing group. Stories told are that the colored help raise the white children who love them and in 20 years they are the boss and are just like their parents because of the social stigmas. The maids want to explain how they feel about it.This movie is sad and wonderful at the same time. The friendships and trusts that develop are amazing and the help finally getting to speak their mind about how they are treated and how they feel about their lives. More maids join in and the book becomes a masterpiece that brings to light the racial inequality in America at that time.

I lived in Montgomery, Alabama during the bus strike. And, as the movie states, Mississippi was, indeed, the longest hold out state with the worst conditions for blacks. I believe that a movie like this is very important now when enough time has gone by that a lot of people don't even remember what times were like back then. Even young African Americans don't really know what it was like or having been told by parents and grandparents don't really believe it. I bought this movie expecting light entertainment and thinking I would be disappointed that it wasn't better but I was  very surprised at the way it was done.

Just to make sure it was what I thought it was.This book hit home for me because I am--now--a 66 year-old White southerner who was raised by an African-American woman who was for all intents and purposes my mother. Not that I did not love my parents--both of them--but the day to day life an upper class white child in the 1950's south from year 1 to 6 was in the company of this wonderful lady, her husband and her friends. I would be in her church on Wednesday Prayer Meetings, Sunday night Services and often would play with the children of the adult friends of his lady, me being the ONLY white child among them.I was very lucky because I feel that I had a COMPLETE southern upbringing.  I can also say that my mother who was president of the local PTA was instrumental in making the Transition from segregation to integration in 1954-1955 in our local school as smooth as possible.When I finally saw the movie ""The Help"" last summer all of these memories poured over me.  I remembered Mary and the way she raised me--which is what she did--to adulthood.  She was kind but strict.  No sassing. So back talk and always say Yes 'Mam and Yes Sir to adults...including HER!!!!I went and visited her grave recently and said a little prayer of thanks.  This movie is very special to me. Every character in the movie has a corresponding person in my own growing up.It was a very emotional experience for me.EXCEPT for one SMALL detail.....no southern Black church in the 1950's would EVER have a minister THAT YOUNG.

1391669,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B004A8ZWVK,kacunnin,"[21, 36]","I'm not sure what to make of THE HELP.  Director Tate Taylor takes the comic route with Kathryn Stockett's best selling novel, so that the racial tensions at the center of the story are tempered by a succession of feel-good moments and ""you go, girl!"" affirmations. But what's it really all about?As in the novel, recent Old Miss graduate Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns home to 1963 Jackson, Mississippi to discover the shocking truth that black maids aren't given much respect by their white mistresses.  Skeeter has vague notions of being a writer, and when a NYC publisher (Mary Steenburgen) suggests that she ""write about what disturbs [her] that doesn't seem to disturb anyone else,"" she decides to write a book about the experiences of the black maids in Jackson.  Skeeter manages to talk two maids into helping her with the book - Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) - and their stories become the heart of the film.There's just something a little to ""pat"" and homogenized about THE HELP.  All of the white racists are so over-the-top awful that they become caricatures, which makes them way too easy to laugh at and thus dismiss.  The despicable Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who wants the governor to institute a law that all white homes in the state must provide separate toilet facilities for their ""colored help,"" is just so blatantly cruel and evil that she might as well be wearing a black hat as she twirls her mustache.  White trash neighbor Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) is so adorably nave and clueless that she doesn't know enough to be racist - she just can't help but sit down and eat fried chicken with Minny.  Hilly's semi-senile mom (Sissy Spacek) is hysterically funny making fun of her racist daughter, and Skeeter's mom (Allison Janey) has cancer but decides not to die so that Skeeter can take a job in New York.  It's just all so friendly and fun, and everything works out so nicely in the end - the bad guys get their comeuppance, the good guys get revenge, and Skeeter gets her book published.  It's sort of like THE COLOR PURPLE meets ""Andy of Mayberry.""Somewhere in all this the real racial divide that existed in the 1960's (and still exists today, if less obviously) is missing in action.  Why is Hilly such a crazy racist if her mother seems downright enlightened?  Or are we to assume that senility cures racism?  Why is silly white trash Celia Foote without a racist bone in her body?  Or are we to assume that being born poor protects us from being prejudiced and cruel?  And finally, why didn't Skeeter ever notice how blacks were treated in Jackson until she graduated from college?  And why doesn't she ever once stand up to her racist friends and tell them what she really thinks of them?I enjoyed THE HELP, but it also made me uncomfortable.  This is a movie that encourages black viewers to delight in their many opportunities to laugh at the stupidity of the white racist women on the screen.  There's nothing wrong with that - and some of the scenes are very, very funny.  But it's also a movie that encourages white viewers to feel better about themselves - after all, we're not as bad as Hilly, right?  No, we're like Skeeter, who loved the black maid who raised her.  As long as all this racism stuff was something that happened a long time ago, involving people so horrible we can never see glimpses of ourselves in them, then we can sit back and enjoy this film.I did like the movie.

Having absolutely loved the book, I felt sure that the movie adaptation would be just as good.  Read my review of the novel by Kathryn Stockett here.I watched The Help during my 11-month old's naptime, which meant that I watched it with subtitles to keep the volume down.  I think I got more out of the movie that way.  Some of the dialogue was difficult to understand, and watching with subtitles meant that I didn't miss a word.Of course, there were some changes from the book to the movie version, but they did not bother me too much.  I did feel like some of the important scenes were omitted from the movie, especially the part about Minnie and the miscarried baby.The casting was excellent and everyone did such a good job.  I especially loved Viola Davis as Abilene and Octavia Spencer as Minnie.  And Emma Stone is such a good little actress!  I have really enjoyed all of her movies to date.

1391698,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,B004A8ZWVK,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[34, 49]","Kathryn Stockett's bestselling novel about a young white woman enlisting the aid of maids in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi to write a tell-all book of about life as domestic servants in well-to-do white households has been turned into an appealing, safe movie. Stockett's book can be justly criticized for its use of dialect, its melodramatic excesses of plot and its untidy narrative structure; but in smoothing out the rough edges and turning it into a polished-looking film screenwriter and first-time director Taylor Tate has largely drained whatever truth the original had. At least Stockett included suggestions of the real horror blacks faced in the segregationist South: a maid's teenage son is badly beaten and blinded for accidentally using the wrong bathroom at a business establishment, and there is an extended and chilling description of what might befall a domestic and her family if she crosses her white employer. Little of this context remains in the filmed ""Help,"" save for a harrowing scene where the maid Aibileen (Viola Davis) and a male companion are ordered off a segregated bus and forced into the dangerous night (civil rights activist Medgar Evers has just been murdered in front of his family).Instead, the film's focus is on spunky Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), who has graduated from college with a new awareness of her world's injustices and a yearning to be a writer. Her beloved housekeeper Constantine, who raised her, has recently left under mysterious circumstances. Skeeter presses her friend Elizabeth's maid Aibileen, and Aibileen's sharp-tongued best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) into the aforementioned book-writing project, all the while keeping a wary eye on the unashamedly bigoted local Junior League president Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is pushing a ""Home Sanitation Initiative"" designed to guarantee that white employers and their domestics never, ever have to use the same toilet.

Aibileen, a wise African-American maid and caretaker suffers after the loss of her own child. And Minny, Aibileen's sassy best friend, struggles to find and hold a job.

Skeeter, frustrated with the restricted gender role of her social class, wondered about her long-time maid, Constantine, who disappeared from her family while she was away at Ole Miss in early 1960's.  She couldn't fit in with her friends because of their conservatism and narrow-mindedness of racist Mississippi culture.After Hilly's racist proposal that every home has a separate toilet for the help and her mother's insulting comments toward the help, Skeeter decided to write a book about the help in Jackson Mississippi.  In order to do so, she has to have at least five maids/nannies.  Given the repressive racist nature of Jackson society, they refused to talk to Skeeter. Only one, Aibileen Clark, decided to be interviewed by her.  Even she didn't want to talk to her about the racism of Jackson's finest households because she feared punishment.That movie sanitized that painful chapter of America's history by shoving the Civil Rights movement to the sidelines, with mentionings of Medgar Evers and the March on Washington.  Blacks in the South feared reprisals and even death if they dare to talk about those injustices.  In the movie, Blacks get fired when telling stories about working for upper class White families and their horrible treatment by them.  The only exception was Celia Foote, who is an outcast because she came from a lower-class background and whom the snobby, closed-minded upper class women of Jackson shun.Then there's the matter of Skeeter's nanny, Constantine.  When Skeeter came back home from College, she was greeted by Pascagoula instead of Constantine.  She constantly asked her mother what happened to her, all she got was lies and deception by her.  It wasn't until her literary agent urged Skeeter to add something about the nanny that raised her until college, her mom finally confessed about Constantine's mysterious disappearance.  Her mother fired her because she wanted to keep appearances while entertaining the Daughters of the American Revolution at her home.  Few days later, Constantine moved to Chicago with her daughter and died.This movie is more about Skeeter's coming of age and of her discontent with traditional gender roles of her social set than it is about the struggles and humanity of Blacks who serve elite White families of Jackson, Mississippi.",3,The Help is a Coming of Age Movie,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,2377,"['privileged', 'single', 'white', 'woman', 'two', 'black', 'maids', 'Skeeter', 'frustrated', 'restricted', 'gender', 'role', 'social', 'class', 'wondered', 'long-time', 'maid', 'Constantine', 'who', 'disappeared', 'family', 'was', 'away', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'early', '1960', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'friends', 'conservatism', 'narrow-mindedness', 'racist', 'Mississippi', 'culture.After', 'Hilly', 'racist', 'proposal', 'home', 'separate', 'toilet', 'help', 'mother', 'insulting', 'comments', 'help', 'Skeeter', 'decided', 'write', 'book', 'help', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'least', 'five', 'maids/nannies', 'Given', 'repressive', 'racist', 'nature', 'Jackson', 'society', 'refused', 'talk', 'Skeeter', 'Only', 'one', 'Aibileen', 'Clark', 'decided', 'be', 'interviewed', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'racism', 'Jackson', 'finest', 'households', 'feared', 'punishment.That', 'movie', 'sanitized', 'painful', 'chapter', 'America', 'history', 'shoving', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'sidelines', 'mentionings', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'March', 'Washington', 'Blacks', 'South', 'feared', 'reprisals', 'even', 'death', 'dare', 'talk', 'injustices', 'movie', 'Blacks', 'get', 'fired', 'when', 'telling', 'stories', 'working', 'upper', 'class', 'White', 'families', 'horrible', 'treatment', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'Celia', 'Foote', 'who', 'outcast', 'came', 'lower-class', 'background', 'whom', 'snobby', 'closed-minded', 'upper', 'class', 'women', 'Jackson', 'shun.Then', 'matter', 'Skeeter', 'nanny', 'Constantine', 'When', 'Skeeter', 'came', 'back', 'home', 'College', 'was', 'greeted', 'Pascagoula', 'instead', 'Constantine', 'constantly', 'asked', 'mother', 'what', 'happened', 'got', 'was', 'lies', 'deception', 'was', ""n't"", 'literary', 'agent', 'urged', 'Skeeter', 'add', 'something', 'nanny', 'raised', 'college', 'mom', 'finally', 'confessed', 'Constantine', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'mother', 'fired', 'wanted', 'keep', 'appearances', 'entertaining', 'Daughters', 'American', 'Revolution', 'home', 'Few', 'days', 'later', 'Constantine', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'daughter', 'died.This', 'movie', 'more', 'Skeeter', 'coming', 'age', 'discontent', 'traditional', 'gender', 'roles', 'social', 'set', 'struggles', 'humanity', 'Blacks', 'who', 'serve', 'elite', 'White', 'families', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi']",N/A

I was impressed across the board, but if Octavia Spencer doesn't win the Academy Award, let there be pitchforks outside the Kodak Theatre!Now, for what I didn't like:  it's yet ANOTHER story about how a white person saved the day for a group of oppressed black people.  I appreciate the context of the times, etc., but I hate that the story had the maids empowered by a white teenager.  Skeeter may be merely the vehicle used to tell the story of what it was like for domestic workers in those times, but I think it's demoralizing for young black people today to be exposed over and over again to the concept that without white intervention, black has no hope.  Another example would the ""The Blind Side.""

Bryce Dallas Howard as the nasty Miss Hilly and Jessica Chastian as the good hearted  poor white ditz are so badly acted, so over the top, that they come off as caricatures. In the hands of finer actresses, all of their characteristics: the malicious racism concealed by a sugary exterior, and the pathetic vulnerability of the poor girl who made it to the big house, would have made this a much better effort.There are some pretty good analyses made by other reviewers already why this book was a fairly simple minded feel good treatment of a tragic period in American history [ yes I did read it] , but if you can put your critical brain on hold and watch with your heart [ albeit a sentimental one] the movie is enjoyable.Sometimes Octavia Spencer's fried chicken comments and the infamous poo-pie were a bit too much, but she too did well considering what she had to work with. Viola Davis, however, is the pivot around which the whole film turns, and if you have been privileged enough to know older ladies who grew up in the south and lived this reality, she will break your heart.If you can find it please see Nothing but a Man, with Ivan Dixon and Abby Lincoln. I saw it more than 25 years ago and I haven't been able to forget it. It's a serious treatment of racism in the south and how one man tries to deal with it. Another film which I really thought well of at the time of its release is To Sleep with Anger, which uses African folk traditions and folkways from the deep south to tell the story of a trickster, played by Danny Glover, and his effect on a family he visits in L.A.

I've seen some other film adaptations of books lately and have been disappointed.  And so I must say that I was completely delighted with the film adaptation of ""The Help"".  Not only did it stay true to the book, it was so well cast that every character rang true.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I felt real emotion throughout.  The filmmakers did an outstanding job and I want to shout ""Bravo"".The story is set in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's.  Emma Stone is cast as a young white college graduate who yearns to be taken seriously as a writer.  Her first job is writing a column on cleaning house in the local paper and so she starts interviewing the African American women who work as maids in the homes of her friends.  Immediately, her eyes are opened to the realities of their lives and decides to turn her knowledge into an eventual book.Viola Davis is excellent in the role of Aibileen who gives the child she cares for an abundance of love and attention.  Octavia Spencer is cast as Minnie, another maid with a strong personality who is full of grit and gumption.  And Bryce Dally Howard is cast as Hilly, an obnoxious young white social-climbing woman who we all love to hate.The plot moves swiftly and even though the film is 2-1/2 hours long, I was so caught up in it that I didn't want it to end.  Here was a snapshot in a time of racial prejudice and the exploitation of household help in a era that has hopefully passed into history.

Her friends welcome her back, but Skeeter's changed in ways that they have not.  For one thing, Mississippi in the 1960's was a hotbed of racial segregation, and Skeeter's no longer comfortable with that. Her first summer home, she observes the way her friends (mis)treat their black maids, and, gradually, convinces some of the maids to talk to her about their lives, about which Skeeter knows very little. Soon, she has a publisher interested in compiling those interviews into a book.The Help is written and directed by Tate Taylor, who elicited fine performances from his primarily female cast. Viola Davis, as the maid Aibilene, is the lynchpin that holds the story together, showing depths of carefully modulated  dignity, strength, and emotion in her dealings with employers and friends alike. The other standout is Jessica Chastain,  who plays the  white trash bombshell who snagged the town's most eligible bachelor and is shunned by everyone but Skeeter. Her ability to project vulnerability and honesty without pathos is awesome. Bryce Dallas Howard, in the thankless role of beautiful, dyed-in-the-wool racist and social leader Hilly,  personifies the ugliness of the racial situation with aplomb. Emma Stone represents those looked their consciences square in the face and took up the banner in the civil rights movement, and as Skeeter, shows how much courage was necessary in that dangerous environment.The Help  has taken a lot of critical flak from folks who have an ax to grind about how it presents the issue of segregation. But, first and foremost, The Help is a movie, based upon a novel,  not a sociological treatise. It's intelligent, thought provoking entertainment.  It shows how things were, and in many cases, still are, and if it brings awareness to the minds of people who weren't yet born during the 60's, it's done its job.

1391730,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B004A8ZWVK,Lisa Siegel,"[0, 0]","After hearing about the incredible reviews that The Help was getting in theaters, I decided I should probably read the book then see the movie (which is what I usually do).  First off, I LOVED the book!  It has become one of my favorite books of all time.  I loved how it is written in the POV of the three main characters, Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.  Such detail and so much history goes into the book of what really went on in Mississippi in the 1960s.Now on to the movie.  Of course there were pieces left out of the book (which always happens...and I really don't like that), but in this case, it worked in a way because some of the scenes from the book were in different places in the movie which I thought worked rather well (i.e. Minny telling Skeeter & Aibileen about the ""special pie"" for Hilly before telling Celia).  Other than that, I personally adored the movie.  The actors are amazing and everyone fit their roles perfectly.Although I adore Meryl Streep, I really think that Viola Davis deserved the Oscar for her performance as Aibileen.  She was just...I can't even put into words how incredible she was!  She really brought the character to life and I just loved the way in which she narrated the movie.  Until Doubt in 2008 I didn't really know who Viola Davis was; now she is up there as one of my favorite actresses!Octavia Spencer who plays Minny was GREAT!  She truly deserved her Oscar for her role.  When I was reading the book, I kept picturing her as Minny.  I already knew that she played her in the movie, but it was just so easy to picture her in the book as well.  She told the truth and didn't care who heard her!  My favorite scene was definitely when she brought Hilly the pie...that special pie just for Hilly.  I won't say any more just in case people have not seen the movie or read the book; but if/when you do, you will just burst out laughing!Emma Stone was brilliant as Skeeter (Eugenia).  I had never really seen her in anything serious like this before.  She has mainly been in comedies so at first when I heard she was in this movie, I will admit I was a little skeptical.  I am so glad I was proven wrong.  Emma portrays Skeeter to a ""T"" in my opinion.  From her insanely curly hair to her charm to the way she would mouth off at Hilly or her mother at times was great.  I do wish that we got to see a few more scenes of Skeeter and Stuart though.  And I wish we got to see her telling him about the book instead of his reaction.  But all in all, Emma gets an 'Easy A' (haha).Allison Janney...oh my goodness.  I think that the role of Charlotte was made for her.  She was really lovable at times and then you just wanted to yell at her (especially when you find out about Constantine).  I do wish that there was more of a build up to Skeeter finding out about her mother's condition rather than it being known to her already, but I guess that's what you have to do in movies.  Still, it was quite effective.  Especially their talk towards the end.And then of course there is Bryce Dallas Howard.  Oh Hilly.  Bryce was simply brilliant in portraying the villainess here.  She was just as sarcastic, rude, and stuck up as she was in the book.  I do wish that there was a scene (I think there may have been but it was deleted) where she convinces Elizabeth (the woman Aibileen works for) to get an outdoor bathroom for Aibileen.  However it was mentioned in another scene after the bathroom was put in.  Bryce really sold the character here and really made you hate her.  At times I forgot I was watching a movie!I cannot recall their names, but the two little girls who played Mae Mobley (or Baby Girl as Aibileen calls her) were terrific.

1391744,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B004A8ZWVK,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[5, 11]","The Help is a maid for Oscar story of Mississippi maids set in 1963.  The book,The Helphas become a literary phenomenon.  There is no black president.  There is no daughter and granddaughter of a maid who has had a talk show for 25 years.  Now, as we go deeper into the deep south, we peer through the bent back tulips, to see how the other half lives,  to explore the life of the black maid against the burgeoning backdrop of the civil rights movement.As we go to Jackson 1963, a microcosmic experience unfolds.  Don't imagine the elephant in the room. Imagine invisible maids under a microscope. Life through a female lens.  Life is not fair if you are a black maid. Some people say foul is fair.  Some will not just say it, but prove it.Eugenia aka Skeeter personifies the progressive educated female. Well traveled, broad minded, she hopes to become a writer in New York. Returning to Jackson she discovers that her maid from childhood has mysteriously disappeared.Hilly Holbrook, the antagonist, alpha female housewife personifying the status quo, with her bouffed up sprayed in place hair, and a WITCH (Woman In Total Control of Herself) glint in her eye, campaigns for a law requiring people with home help to build an additional toilet for the help only.She is not racist enough not to hire a black maid, and she will kiss her small child before passing it to the outstretched arms of the hovering maid.  She is racist enough to pay below minimum wage. She will find a suitable match for her friend Skeeter.  She proclaims that she promotes 'separate but equal,' and warns her friend Skeeter that there are 'real racists' in this town.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play long suffering maids Aibileen and mouthy Minny respectively.  One embittered, tragic, looks Oprahesque, the other sassy.The toilet becomes a recurring symbol, metaphor, inciting incident, turning point.  Other symbols include the maid uniform, the bus, pies, the ring, Crisco, and grits.Now is the sweltering summer of our discontent maid  glorious Autumn by this story of suffering maids and their condition may be made better by writing a tell all book.  It may also be maide worse.The dilemma of peeing.  A sassy maid caught short during a storm insistently asks to use the house bathroom and gets refused.  She goes.  The WITCH, boiling with anger, bangs on the door.  The maid without peeing insolently flushes the toilet to get under her bosses skin. 18 people died in that storm, 10 white, 8 black. A maid risks not only getting fired but also life and death, and having to pee in a storm on the way home.When Aibileen tells her tragic story I could feel the emotion welling in my chest and while remaining in the moment I was transported to Oscar night, where they show the scene from the movie. When Skeeter (Emma Stone)did her monologue, I had a similar somewhat intense experience. It takes great talent to evoke that kind of response.Rarely do you get such a strong ensemble with a mostly female cast, with such well written acting roles.  The movieDoubtalso starring Viola Davis, got four Oscar nominations for acting, and I expect this movie will get several acting nominations including a second nomination for her, and probably victory this time.While outstanding in the acting, and pathos, with many of the most memorable scenes you will experience this year, it has weaknesses in the story.  Specifically, the lack of a strong inciting incident. The story could have been strengthened by having Medgar Evers as a character.  As he lived in Jackson at the time,  how difficult would it be to have one or two scenes with him in it, and then the storyteller would have us much more emotionally involved in the real life event of his assassination by a  'real' racist.While other movies such asMississippi Burning, set around the same time,In the Heat of  the Night (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition), orTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition), explore the racial tension and explicit racism through a masculine lens, The Help explores a more shaded implicit racism of denial. The covert racism of going along to get along, bowing to peer pressure, not daring to risk punishment by social exclusion, and using moral justification without compassion as with Hilly.  It's racism without the demeaning word, the more punishing racism of the workplace and the pocketbook, not the racism of the thug.Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly could win an Oscar.  When she is good she is very very good.  When she is bad she is better.  Her gleeful wicked witch of the West meets Cruella De Ville performance, at first deceptively inconsequential builds throughout the movie, reaching an impressive crescendo. I hope the nominater is smart enough to nominate her in a different category from Viola Davis, so both can win.Minny wants equality, yet when Celia Foote sits at her table, and treats her like an equal, her conditioning kicks in and she asks her to sit elsewhere.  I liked that her character was more active.Emma Stone could get an Oscar nom. She is a crusader, and does battle adversity but she is not the subject of adversity, and does not have a dog in the fight.  The stakes are less serious for her.I liked Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain, as poor white trash married into money.  She has no understanding of the social norms, and status, because she apparently was raised on Mars. She has a Jayne Mansfield body.I feel pretty certain that The Help will be nominated for best picture, and the issue of race relations has been well favored in the past for example, the movie Crash, won with a similar theme.Each year Oscars get awarded for  mostly two types of roles:1. A person battling adversity, mental illness, social discrimination, physical or mental handicap of some kind, the underdog. A crusader. A stuttering king, as in Colin Firth, a mentally ill ballerina as in Natalie Portman, a crusader as in Sandra Bullock, or Hilary Swank, or Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. Hattie McDaniel won playing a maid and a slave in Gone with the wind set in 1863.2. The psychopath sociopath.  Anthony Hopkins Silence of the Lambs,  Javier Bardem No Country for old men,  Kate Winslet in The Reader. Angelina Jolie as a sociopathic mental in Life interrupted. Charlize Theron as serial killer.If you like The Help, I recommend you also see The Debt, a brilliant suspense thriller also starring Jessica Chastain, with Helen Mirren.  I wonder which one you will like best.  If you are like me, I think you will be amazed at how talented JC is in a leading role. It's the best movie of the 60 or so I have seen this year. She also plays the lead actress  inThe Tree of Life [Blu-ray] which I recommend somewhat cautiously.  I don't know if you will like the movie, but I think you will love her performance.I hope you found this review helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",4,The best maid movie you will see this

Watched ""The Help"" yesterday and LOVED it! The movie follows the book pretty closely. Wonderful story about a girl in the South named Skeeter. Skeeter was raised in a home whom had a black maid. As an adult, Skeeter enjoyed writing and got a job answering the newspapers equivalent of ""Dear Abby for house cleaning."" Since Skeeter never cleaned her own home, she has asked one of the maids in the area to help with the answers. One day, after hearing the local white woman talking down to their help, Skeeter decides to try to interview the maids to get their view of working for the whites. This story takes place during a time when blacks could be lynched for any kind of ""injustice"" towards whites. Segregation of schools, churches, buses, bathrooms, etc. Will the maids agree to talk? Will anyone be killed for speaking to Skeeter? This movie is serious yet still has a lot of light hearted moments.This movie should be shown in history classes!

1391757,A129YBX5BVNW2,B004A8ZWVK,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","Some have criticized ""The Help"" and its depiction of racism as way too easy on the eye and cheery on the ear - slyly dodging the 'physically' violent reality of segregation in 1960's Southern America in favour of entertainment. But I think that's being massively unfair to the movie's genuine achievement - it's brilliant portrayal of the 'mental' apartheid levelled every day at black people - which ran hand-in-hand with the opposite side of the coin - the love given to white children by black maids.Adapted from Kathryn Stockett's book and Directed by Tate Taylor in 2011 - ""The Help"" has a virtual flood of truly blistering performances from black and white actresses at the top of their game - women given meaty material they want to do justice to. It's resulted in global box office success and a whopping 53 nominations - followed by as many wins (BAFTA and OSCAR included).While Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Aunjanue Ellis have rightly been praised for their layered portrayals - I was blown away by the most difficult role of all - that of the odious Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is awesome as a truly hateful white woman with meanness literally hardwired into her DNA. Hilly Holbrook sits in her car and spitefully takes pleasure as she watches a black maid who crossed her be arrested by white cops - in the bathroom she marks the individual toilet sheets with a pen to see if her black maid crosses that sanitation line. Jessica Chastain too as the blonde and ample social outcast Celia Foote - who is perceived as a husband robber but is just lost - another belter of a performance. Lesley Jordan as a mouthy newspaper editor, Sissy Spacek as a mentally ailing mum, Mary Steenburgen as a New York book editor - so many class acts.The story goes like this - a headstrong 22-year Southern gal called Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan decides to become a real writer (anything to avoid her mother's constant scheming towards marriage). Her subject matter is going to be the black maids who raised the white children of Alabama and their side of the story. The author will be 'Anonymous' and the book will be entitled ""The Help"". But of course because of fear and intimidation it doesn't prove easy to document and the journey tests Skeeter's loyalties and personal courage to the maximum too (spot-on casting in the lovely and hugely talented Emma Stone). It proves even more traumatic to her 'one-of-the-gals' mother Charlotte (a stupendous turn from Allison Janney) who makes a staggeringly crass mistake on the back of white peer pressure. But to get started - Skeeter needs a cohort. So when a middle-aged maid she knows gets fired - Skeeter gets her first interviewee. Giving a deeply humane performance, Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark. Aibileen is 53 and works 8am to 4pm six days a week for peanuts money servicing husband and wife Raphael and Elizabeth Leefolt. She's also a full-time nanny to young Mae Mobley Leefolt their 3-year old daughter (she's mothered 17 children in her life). Aibileen has also lost her grown-up son Treelore to haphazard white working practices and now her job over a trumped-up 'theft of silver' charge. But she loves children - and even when useless mom Elizabeth callously fires her - Aibileen grabs the vulnerable and hurting child Mae Mobley - and in tears - reiterates her mantra of life positivity to her (those words title this review).Aibileen's best friend is Minny Jackson - an ace cook and rotund force of nature (despite her husband's occasional beatings). After a hilarious incident involving pie and a non-nutritional substance contained within it (a really great joke that is milked for a good twenty minutes) - she too becomes involved (an unbelievably powerful and committed Octavia Spencer). Skeeter's nanny is the elderly and wise Constantine (beautifully played by veteran actress Cicely Tyson) - a source of love, encouragement and constancy in Skeeter's life. Her disappearance after 29 years service brings Skeeter face to face with her own mother's terrible attitudes...Speaking of the darker side - there are scenes in ""The Help"" that genuinely shock. Black people forced to use the 'colored entrance' at the side of a cinema - rich beauty-parlour white mothers talking about diseases being passed from negroes to their white children through toilets - and worst of all - the chilling reading out of the ""Mississippi"" Law Book with its craftily-worded segregation tactics and Jim Crow rules that will literally have you wincing in your seat in disbelief.Filmed on location in Greenwood, Mississippi - the homes and interiors are all real - and Stephen Goldblatt's incredible cinematography of the local scenery gives all of its 146 minutes a deeply rich hue. Better still - it's defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio - so the picture fills your entire screen (no bars top or bottom). It means that the BLU RAY image is full-on beautiful all of the time. Add to this a gorgeous and emotive score by THOMAS NEWMAN (""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Green Mile"", ""The Road To Perdition"" etc) and the whole thing feels special the moment it opens. The only downer for me came at the film's end in the form of the ubiquitous saccharine ballad - 'Living Proof' by Mary J. Blige. It would have been far better to simply play out to Newman's affecting music - and classier too.EXTRAS: even though it's only 24 minutes long - the 'Making Of' is genuinely informative and even moving in places. The Author Kathryn Stockett and Director Tate Taylor are from Jackson, Mississippi and have known each other since childhood. More importantly they both came from broken homes and had black maids whom they loved and admired. It was a story they felt had to be told. Combining this with the magic touch of Steven Spielberg (one of the Executive Producers) - and you begin to understand why and how the lovely tone of the film was achieved and maintained - the right people were let do the job and not some Hollywood name. At just under 12 minutes duration - the 'In Their Own Words...' extra where Tate Taylor and Octavia Spencer talk to real 'Maids of Mississippi' is too short - but what there is of it - is wonderfully insightful and uplifting.To sum up - touching, funny, horrifying and ultimately moving - ""The Help"" blew my family and myself away.Well done to Kathryn Stockett, Tate Taylor, DreamWorks and all the good souls who fought to see it made.BLU RAY Specifications:PICTURE: 1080p High Def, 1.85:1 Aspect RatioAUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1; French, Spanish and Russian Dolby Digital 5.1SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Spanish, Russian and UkrainianEXTRAS:1.

1391759,A30TW9R3R0NODW,B004A8ZWVK,Mark Kittell,"[9, 15]","We get either another Tyler Perry movie about the angst of affluent black women, the ""feeling good about feeling bad"" melodrama, or this Lifetime Channel mendacity. Here we have a story about a white female who feels ""guilty"" about being part of a society that degrades blacks, and as atonement she decides that the black maid isn't so far beneath her station to converse with in normal human terms. Eventually this is a story of white empowerment over guilt, a moral victory over ignorance. But the black people are still black, and there is the consolation of knowing that if the social pressure gets too hot, you are still white, and you abandon your pretenses, and all will be well again. But the guilt of belonging to a racist society is gone, because despite the fact that you have the good fortune of living in a world of white ""privilege,"" within the confines of your mind you have satisfied yourself that you do not personally hate. But you've done nothing to change the wider culture that maintains your status, nor do you wish to.The problem with this particular film is that guilt cannot be washed away simply on personal whim; the ugly truth remains. In the mid 1960s, James Baldwin wrote an essay about white ""guilt"" and history. ""The guilt remains, more deeply rooted, more securely lodged, than the oldest of old trees; and it can be unutterably exhausting to deal with people who, with a really dazzling ingenuity, a tireless agility, are perpetually defending themselves against charges which one has not made. One does not have to make them. The record is there for all to read. It resounds all over the world. It might as well be written in the sky. One wishes that Americans, white Americans, would read, for their own sakes, this record, and stop defending themselves against it. Only then will they be enabled to change their lives. The fact that Americans, white Americans, have not yet been able to do this- to face their history, to change their lives-hideously menaces this country. Indeed, it menaces the entire world."" In other words, those who forget history are bound to repeat it. And deeds speak louder than words.People will say that the world has changed, and to a certain extent it has. White America accepts blacks insofar as they can entertain them, like the gladiators of ancient Rome who were nevertheless tied to a subservient social strata. We even have a black president, who serves as a ""beacon"" for American tolerance--but nevertheless is a figure viewed with suspicion and fear by many, kept on a leash so that he will not change the culture of white privilege. That is one picture; another picture is that white women, like the protagonist in this film, have the lowest unemployment rates and the highest college enrollment, while black men have the highest unemployment rates (probably double the ""official"" rate), and there are more black men in jail than in college. We may ""debate"" the reasons for this, but there is no mistaking that it has come to be ""accepted."" Heck, even Oprah accepts it, even rejoices in it; she still doesn't realize that white people still have their hands on all the levers (just look at her audience).Anyone who thinks that this film (let alone the book)is representative the ""progress"" that we've made is deluding themselves. We've hardly moved from that place; the dogs and fire hoses are gone, but the mindset and what is set before our eyes remains. This is a story about how one person removed guilt by denying an ongoing history.",2,"No more guilt, no more truth",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,3513,"['get', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'angst', 'affluent', 'black', 'women', 'feeling', 'good', 'feeling', 'bad', 'melodrama', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'mendacity', 'Here', 'have', 'story', 'white', 'female', 'who', 'guilty', 'being', 'part', 'society', 'blacks', 'atonement', 'black', 'maid', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'station', 'converse', 'normal', 'human', 'terms', 'Eventually', 'story', 'white', 'empowerment', 'guilt', 'moral', 'victory', 'ignorance', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'black', 'consolation', 'knowing', 'social', 'pressure', 'too', 'hot', 'are', 'still', 'white', 'abandon', 'pretenses', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'again', 'guilt', 'belonging', 'racist', 'society', 'gone', 'fact', 'have', 'good', 'fortune', 'living', 'world', 'white', 'privilege', 'confines', 'mind', 'have', 'satisfied', 'do', 'not', 'personally', 'hate', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nothing', 'change', 'wider', 'culture', 'status', 'do', 'wish', 'to.The', 'problem', 'particular', 'film', 'guilt', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'washed', 'away', 'simply', 'personal', 'whim', 'ugly', 'truth', 'mid', '1960s', 'James', 'Baldwin', 'wrote', 'essay', 'white', 'guilt', 'history', 'guilt', 'more', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'more', 'securely', 'lodged', 'oldest', 'old', 'trees', 'can', 'be', 'unutterably', 'exhausting', 'deal', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'dazzling', 'ingenuity', 'tireless', 'agility', 'are', 'perpetually', 'defending', 'charges', 'not', 'made', 'One', 'not', 'have', 'make', 'record', 'there', 'read', 'world', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'written', 'sky', 'One', 'Americans', 'white', 'Americans', 'would', 'read', 'own', 'sakes', 'record', 'stop', 'defending', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'enabled', 'change', 'lives', 'fact', 'Americans', 'white', 'Americans', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'this-', 'face', 'history', 'change', 'lives-hideously', 'menaces', 'country', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'world', 'other', 'words', 'who', 'forget', 'history', 'are', 'bound', 'repeat', 'speak', 'louder', 'words.People', 'will', 'say', 'world', 'changed', 'certain', 'extent', 'White', 'America', 'blacks', 'insofar', 'can', 'entertain', 'gladiators', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'who', 'were', 'nevertheless', 'tied', 'subservient', 'social', 'strata', 'even', 'have', 'black', 'president', 'who', 'beacon', 'American', 'tolerance', 'nevertheless', 'figure', 'viewed', 'suspicion', 'fear', 'many', 'kept', 'leash', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'culture', 'white', 'privilege', 'one', 'picture', 'picture', 'white', 'women', 'protagonist', 'film', 'have', 'lowest', 'unemployment', 'rates', 'highest', 'college', 'enrollment', 'black', 'men', 'have', 'highest', 'unemployment', 'rates', 'probably', 'double', 'official', 'rate', 'are', 'more', 'black', 'men', 'jail', 'college', 'may', 'debate', 'reasons', 'mistaking', 'come', 'be', 'accepted', 'Heck', 'even', 'Oprah', 'even', 'still', ""n't"", 'realize', 'white', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'hands', 'levers', 'just', 'look', 'audience', '.Anyone', 'who', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'book', 'representative', 'progress', ""'ve"", 'made', 'deluding', ""'ve"", 'hardly', 'moved', 'place', 'dogs', 'fire', 'hoses', 'are', 'gone', 'mindset', 'what', 'set', 'eyes', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'removed', 'guilt', 'denying', 'ongoing', 'history']",N/A

1391761,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004A8ZWVK,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It seems these days that young people tend to ignore history or to relate to it only in the amount of time they've had on Earth. Anything beyond that is unimportant to them. At the same time they tend to focus more on social and media material than on things as simple as books, limiting themselves to the intake of knowledge. With the release of THE HELP, one can only hope that it inspires them to look deeper, to find out the real story of what happened with the civil rights questions of the sixties.Set in the early sixties in Jackson, Mississippi, the story revolves around the black maids of this racially segregated town. These are the days when separate entrances and water fountains were considered normal. And while they are called on to use separate areas, the maids are considered good enough to basically raise white children and take care of white houses.The main character in question is Aibileen (Viola Davis), a maid who works for a respectable family, taking care of their child Mae Mobley and teaching and taking care of her as well as cooking and cleaning the house. The friction in her world has been buried beneath years of racial prejudice but comes to a head when the leader of the Junior League, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) tells the girls in the club everyone should have a separate bathroom for their hired help because they carry germs. She's so convinced she's written an initiative and sent it to the governor in hopes that it can be turned into a law.Aibileen knows she can not react but it doesn't set well with her either. Neither does it set well with Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone). Just back from college and hoping to find a job as a writer, Skeeter has just taken a job as a writer taking on letters concerning cleaning which she knows nothing about. Seeking advice and help, she turns to Aibileen who knows all sorts of cleaning secrets. When Hilly makes her bathroom initiative know, Skeeter doesn't think much of it and pushes back mentioning it in the Junior League's newsletter indefinitely.As Skeeter and Aibileen get to know one another, Skeeter asks her if she'd be interested in talking to her about what its like to be a maid in Mississippi, what it's like to raise white people's children only to see them grow and become more like their parents. While she turns her down at first, eventually Aibileen realizes that she needs to find the courage it takes to let the truth be known. Once she does, the two begin putting together the book that will become known as THE HELP.Skeeter does have an ulterior motive but she's up front with Aibileen from the start. Skeeter wants to be a serious writer and a publisher in New York would be interested in the stories she's seeking. As they progress she finds that the publisher wants more than just one or two maid's tales, they need more. Aibileen first recruits her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer), a brash and at times abrasive maid who's having problems finding new employment as Hilly has recently fired her. Eventually due to other circumstances more maids join in.But this is just the story of the maids that is the main focus. What also comes into play here is the story of Hilly and her controlling nature as well as her racist attitudes. Hilly rules the Junior League with an iron fist and the girls that belong follow her lead to the letter. This is the social atmosphere of Jackson at this time, a world where social stature is the most important thing. All women desire to be added to their midst and fear being shunned by the League and Hilly. But Hilly's actions eventually have consequences.The story reveals itself as the world is changing. Medgar Evers is shot at one point and JFK's funeral is mentioned. Not only do these items bring the historical aspect of the time into play but they set the tone for what the world was like during this period. This is the most important thing that young people can gain from watching this. My guess is none of them would believe that anyone could be so backwards as is seen here but it did happen.The revelations of the stories the maids have to tell and how they are treated by their white employers brings the tale of racism to a personal level, especially those of Aibileen and Minny. And Skeeter, who was raised in this atmosphere, has her eyes opened as well as each story is told to her. It's as if she's seeing the world around her for the first time.THE HELP is not a movie that will give details and specific incidents to young people who see it concerning the civil rights movement. But as I stated earlier, it will be a nice jumping on point for them to begin looking into it. Many would be stunned to learn that there are still areas of the country that continue on this way.The best part of this movie is that it's not a slap in the face. It's not an attack that paints one group as superior to the other or sets one race against another. Instead it uses Hilly to represent that vocal minority that leads others by the nose and forces them to do these things they know they shouldn't, sitting back and accepting things as they are in the hopes of being part of the in crowd. It uses Skeeter to represent the people who have stood by silent but are waking up to the realities around them. And it uses Aibileen and Minny to represent those who have been oppressed and have hope for a different future.  This is a movie that needs to be seen by youngsters who don't know what it was like. Perhaps in so doing they can realize that change was needed and needs to carry on.",4,A TALE THAT NEEDS TOLD,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,5550,"['days', 'young', 'people', 'tend', 'ignore',

The film is artistic with great dialogue and sets; but it pulls no punches about the evils of prejudice as most white people in Jackson, Mississippi degrade their ""help"" (maids they hire for peanuts) while showing that the ""help"" need to be careful just to survive--one maid's cousin's car was set on fire just because he wanted to vote! The film could have been edited very slightly (maybe 5 minutes) to make it a bit tighter; but this is minor. Honestly, the entire film captivated me; and near the end there were 1 or 2 times my eyes welled up with tears--and that's saying a lot because I almost never cry!Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns to Jackson, Mississippi after graduating from ""Old Miss."" Skeeter aspires to be a writer and quickly gets a job writing a housekeeping column at a local newspaper. However, Skeeter doesn't know much about housework--her parents had their maid too, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter while Skeeter's mother (Allison Janney) had herself a good time with ""the girls."" Skeeter also wants to know why Constantine left while she was away; she doesn't believe her parents' explanation.Then come the white women in town who want maids to feel superior--and not to ever worry, not even when their own child is crying for comfort right in front of them. One of the very worst bigots is Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard); she treats her maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) incredibly poorly and this could cause tension--Minnie herself has a temper. Hilly wants an ""initiative"" to make the ""colored help"" use separate bathrooms outside the house so white people don't  ""catch their diseases."" There is another wonderful portrayal of a maid, Aibileen (Viola Davis), who raised 17 white children while their mothers essentially ignored them!Skeeter now wants to write a book about the lives of the maids; but they are terrified--this could even get them killed. Skeeter changes names for anonymity and Aibileen eventually agrees to let Skeeter interview her--then Minnie agrees. But after Medgar Evers is brutally murdered in Jackson, more maids want to tell their stories of dehumanization so Skeeter can get her anonymous book published by a New York City company.There's even more. We don't know until the end why Constantine left Skeeter's family; and we see consequences when Minnie serves homemade ""chocolate pie"" to Hilly. There's also the (allegedly) ""white trash"" outcast in town, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who might hire Minnie because of politics. We see who keeps their job as a maid and who doesn't. There's also Skeeter and her first boyfriend--will they become a loving couple? Moreover, look for a fine performance by Sissy Spacek.As for extras, I particularly liked the deleted scenes and we get a music video by Mary J. Blige.The Help succeeds at portraying the incredible chasm between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" in the deep South at a time when simply being African-American could be quite dangerous. Fans of the actors will certainly want this; people studying the civil rights movement should also get this film.",5,"""What does it feel like to raise a white child when your own child's at home being looked after by somebody else?""",1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,3215,"['Help', 'disgraceful', 'bigoted', 'way', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'treated', 'deep', 'South', 'early', '1960s', 'film', 'artistic', 'great', 'dialogue', 'sets', 'punches', 'evils', 'prejudice', 'most', 'white', 'people', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'degrade', 'help', 'maids', 'hire', 'peanuts', 'showing', 'help', 'need', 'be', 'careful', 'just', 'survive', 'one', 'maid', 'cousin', 'car', 'was', 'set', 'fire', 'just', 'wanted', 'vote', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'very', 'slightly', 'maybe', '5', 'minutes', 'make', 'bit', 'tighter', 'minor', 'Honestly', 'entire', 'film', 'captivated', 'end', 'were', '1', '2', 'times', 'eyes', 'welled', 'up', 'tears', 'saying', 'lot', 'almost', 'never', 'cry', 'Eugenia', 'Skeeter', 'Phelan', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'graduating', 'Old', 'Miss', 'Skeeter', 'be', 'writer', 'quickly', 'job', 'writing', 'housekeeping', 'column', 'local', 'newspaper', 'However', 'Skeeter', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'housework', 'parents', 'had', 'maid', 'too', 'Constantine', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'who', 'raised', 'Skeeter', 'Skeeter', 'mother', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'girls', 'Skeeter', 'also', 'know', 'why', 'Constantine', 'left', 'was', 'away', ""n't"", 'believe', 'parents', 'explanation.Then', 'come', 'white', 'women', 'town', 'who', 'want', 'maids', 'feel', 'superior', 'not', 'ever', 'worry', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'own', 'child', 'crying', 'comfort', 'right', 'front', 'One', 'very', 'worst', 'bigots', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'maid', 'Minnie', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'incredibly', 'poorly', 'could', 'cause', 'tension', 'Minnie', 'temper', 'Hilly', 'initiative', 'make', 'colored', 'help', 'use', 'separate', 'bathrooms', 'house', 'white', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'diseases', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'maid', 'Aibileen', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'raised', '17', 'white', 'children', 'mothers', 'essentially', 'ignored', 'Skeeter', 'now', 'write', 'book', 'lives', 'maids', 'are', 'terrified', 'could', 'even', 'get', 'killed', 'Skeeter', 'changes', 'names', 'anonymity', 'Aibileen', 'eventually', 'let', 'Skeeter', 'interview', 'then', 'Minnie', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Jackson', 'more', 'maids', 'want', 'tell', 'stories', 'dehumanization', 'Skeeter', 'can', 'get', 'anonymous', 'book', 'published', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'company.There', 'even', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'end', 'why', 'Constantine', 'left', 'Skeeter', 'family', 'see', 'consequences', 'when', 'Minnie', 'homemade', 'chocolate', 'pie', 'Hilly', 'also', 'allegedly', 'white', 'trash', 'outcast', 'town', 'Celia', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'might', 'hire', 'Minnie', 'politics', 'see', 'who', 'keeps', 'job', 'maid', 'who', ""n't"", 'also', 'Skeeter', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'will', 'become', 'loving', 'couple', 'Moreover', 'look', 'fine', 'performance', 'Sissy', 'Spacek.As', 'extras', 'particularly', 'liked', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'music', 'video', 'Mary', 'J.', 'Blige.The', 'Help', 'portraying', 'incredible', 'chasm', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'deep', 'South', 'time', 'when', 'simply', 'being', 'African-American', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'dangerous', 'Fans', 'actors', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'people', 'studying', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'should', 'also', 'get', 'film']",N/A

1391774,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004A8ZWVK,M. Bullions,"[289, 317]","""Oscar season"", as it's typically referred to, is a period of time, usually beginning in late November, and ending in late January. This year, it starts early, with ""The Help"".""The Help"" is based on the well-known novel by Kathryn Stockett, someone who I had never heard of before discovering this film and book. For the most part, when I hear about a film that I want to see, I try to read the book prior to viewing the movie, to enhance the whole experience. Usually I get bored, or stop mid-way through one of these said books, before I end up watching the movie.But ""The Help"" grabbed me. Stockett kept me on a leash, dying to know what happened next, and I ended up finishing its 530 pages in a few sittings. And, I'm glad it did, because ""The Help"" is not only the best movie I've seen this summer, but it very well could be the best one I see all year.The film centers on Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny (Davis, Stone and Spencer, respectively) three very different women in Mississippi, in the year 1962. Skeeter is returning from college with a journalism degree, whose beloved childhood black maid Constantine has disappeared, and no one will tell her where she has gone. Aibileen is a maid who has raised 17 white children in her life. The word ""maid"" is pretty blandly used. She's a nanny to these children, if not a surrogate mother. Her outspoken friend Minny has never been able to keep quiet, or, because of this, hold onto a job very long, and she is hired on the sly by Celia (Chastain), a white-trash rich girl who has some grave secrets of her own. Skeeter decides to write a tell-all book of interviews from the maids of Jackson, Mississippi, which, as you could imagine, was a very taboo, and perhaps even illegal thing to take on in the time of Jim Crow, and segregation.One of the reasons that this film succeeds is that not a single character is miscast, and there is not a single caricature. In the book, Stockett paints a vivid picture of each character, and the actors clearly got lost in their characters. Emma Stone is becoming a very important actress. I haven't seen her in a role that I didn't love her in. After getting her first notable role in 2009's ""Zombieland"", and then livening and carrying the otherwise bland teen comedy ""Easy A"", this is her first dramatic role, as Skeeter, one of the lead characters. While she sometimes blends into the background in this movie, she shines beautifully with the rest of the cast. She's definitely one to watch.While Stone is great, this movie belongs to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Davis's Aibileen is perfect. She has a silent sadness about her, a lot of pride, and a great sense of anger, her expressive eyes displaying a silent protest, while never raising her voice the whole film. She handles emotional scenes beautifully, reducing the audience to tears in more than one scene. She's a early in the year front-runner for Best Actress this Oscar season.Spencer also does a beautiful job as Minny. Octavia Spencer was the original inspiration for the character of Minny, who voiced the character's section in the audio-book. She was clearly made to play this role. She does a lot more for this movie, than just adding comic relief, however, she does plays the comedic side the best. The ""terrible awful"" that her character does in the book, is made into the funniest thing in the whole movie.The supporting cast is dead-on too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the town's snobby ringleader, Hilly. She's absolutely chilling, nailing the evil character. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek is a hoot. The town's secretive lush, and Minny's boss, Celia, is played by scene-stealing newcomer Jessica Chastain, who wowed earlier this year in ""The Tree of Life"". She was completely like I envisioned her character in the book. Chastain would be perfect to play Marilyn Monroe. Just saying.  There's not enough typing space in this review to describe how much I loved the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone was dead-on.I was under the assumption that this would be yet another disappointing film of a book loved by many. The reason for this was the director and writer. I had never heard of this Tate Taylor, and because of that, I wasn't sure that I trusted him. He had a large part in making this movie all that it was. One of the big reasons that ""The Help"" works as a movie is because it feels authentic. It was filmed in Mississippi, where it's based, it is set in the 1960's, and every feeling about the movie hits the right note.I later discovered that Taylor was a childhood friend of the book's author. Not some Hollywood hack. I forget the many disappointing film adaptations of books I loved that were made by the Hollywood elite. ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Ron Howard, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" by Rob Marshall, ""Eat, Pray, Love"" by Ryan Murphy. Enough said. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone better-suited to making the film.What is special about this film is that it is not what a lot of people will probably write it off as. It's not a film designed to make audiences feel less ""white guilt"", and it isn't about how black folks need white ones to succeed. It's about good-hearted people wanting to make a change to a world that is unjust. It avoids the usual sentimentality and melodrama that typically plagues this kind of film. I don't know how, but it succeeds in that, like I thought it wouldn't.While some changes are (intelligently) made from the book, it's almost a scene-for-scene adaptation of the book. Some things are different, because they need to be, and things are a little more concise, yet it's almost like watching an abridged version of the book, onscreen. It will stir up emotions in you that you didn't know you had. At the ending of this film, in a packed house, there was a thunderous applause. Almost everyone in the theater stayed seated through out the ending credits. I cannot remember a time where a movie evoked such emotion from its audience, that it wasn't until after the credits had ended that people actually started walking out. This is gripping stuff. Don't miss it.Grade: A+",5,The Help: The best novel adaptation in a loooong time.,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,6106,"['Oscar', 'season', 'typically', 'referred', 'period', 'time', 'usually',

If it was truly reminiscent of pre-civil-rights Mississippi, she would've been tracked down and killed!

After the fiasco that was Eat, Pray, Love, I had a hard time trusting my mother's ability to pick out a film for us to watch.  Female sagas of love and harrowing times seems overdone, clich&eacute;, boring.  I expected The Help to be just another blah movie that left me cold and unsatisfied.The Help is the story of a young college grad named Skeeter, an aspiring journalist, and her attempt to tell the stories of the black maids that lived and worked for white families in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s.  Skeeter is a feisty girl who doesn't want to live the life that society has her pegged for - an obedient housewife who plays bridge and gives birth to babies she won't even care for.  The biggest influence in her life was her family's housekeeper Constantine, the black woman who raised her when her mother ignored her in favor of friends and shopping.  Constantine inspires her to seek out these maids and ask them to tell their stories and experiences, challenging the status quo of society in a great period of racial turmoil in Jackson.  The story combines hope, fear, hatred, and willpower from various viewpoints, telling the stories of various women whose lives are deeply affected by Skeeter's goal.Viola Davis' performance as Aibileen, a maid for a well-to-do Jackson socialite, is impressive, along with Emma Stone's solid performance as Skeeter, but the star of The Help is Octavia Spencer's amazing and heartfelt portrayal of Minnie.  While only a supporting role, Spencer's performance was superb and Oscar-worthy, bringing together a sense of comedy with fear and anger, not only at the family she works for but also the life that she's been forced to live and pull her children through.The performances are what makes this story and brings it to life.  I haven't read the book and cannot speak for it, but everything I saw on screen felt real and powerful.  The lives of these women, from the maids to the snotty housewives and socialites, from the budding journalists to the despairing young wives trying to satisfy their husbands and their societies, each was affecting and felt true and powerful.I went into the movie expecting boring and dull.  I left satisfied and ready to talk about these times, wanting to know more about the time period and ask my grandparents (from the deep south) about their experiences during the time.

The movie version of ""The Help"" really stays true to the spirit of Kathryn Stockett's popular novel. Set in Jackson, Mississippi, in the early 1960s, the film takes a close look at what life was like for the African American women who worked as maids in the homes of upper-class whites. The casting is spot on. This is the first movie I've ever seen Emma Stone in, believe it or not, and I am now officially a fan of hers. You can also see why Octavia Spencer won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a result of her work in this film...she's fantastic! I appreciate that this is a long movie, so not as much needed to be cut from the book (though I was disappointed they omitted the whole toilet-training process, which is pretty central to the book, in my opinion).

The themes of justice, perseverance, and survival never fade away.  This is why ""The Help"" is destined to be a true classic; both as a book and movie.  As another reviewer has already so eloquently stated, this movie is not merely about a historical time period, but about how people's actions, (both good and bad), shed either light or darkness in this world.The acting is magnificent by every cast member.  I was especially impressed with Octavia Spencer's portrayal of Minnie.  Her sass and, ultimately, her kind heart shine through.  Ms. Spencer truly portrayed the character as I envisioned her.  Bryce Dallas Howard was mesmerizing as Hilly Holbrook, the character who is the personification of evil.  Beautiful outwardly, Hilly is a true menace who, with a whispered word of malicious intent, can doom a person to live a life of loneliness and pain.  Ms. Howard is truly talented.

While her parents believe she should find a husband and settle down (after all she is getting old), she has a dream to set the literary world on fire. Living in the South (Jackson, Mississippi) during very turbulent times (the 1960's), Skeeter decides to write a story from the perception of the ""help"" (black maids). Secretly interviewing those around her, she finds more than she ever bargained for. Looking to her own home, and the relationship she had with her own housekeeper (Constantine, played by Cicely Tyson, who left under mysterious circumstances), Skeeter hopes that she can do the overall story justice, as well as shed light on what it means to be a second hand citizen.The story revolves around the lives of Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis). Minny (a rebellious maid) works for quite the character, Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Howard) whose sole focus is to keep the help in their place, maintain her position in Jackson society,  and starting a movement to build separate facilities for the black help. While Minny does not hold her tongue or take anything from anyone, she accepts her role, while a victim of domestic violence. Then there is Aibileen who spends more time raising others children instead of her own. Regretting not being there for her own son who was killed years earlier, she looks at her participation in the project as a way of healing. Feeling that it is her duty to empower the children she is raising, she gives them a mantra to create character and belief in themselves. As the story culminates and the turbulent south erupts following the death of Medger Evans, Skeeter soon has enough participants to write quite the story.In conclusion, ""The Help"" was a wonderful story told by a very talented cast. Perhaps stealing the show was the charmingly beautiful Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who wants nothing more than to be accepted by those in her community and have a child. Celia proves to be what Minny needs to give her the strength to do what she never had the strength to do (leave her abusive husband), while Minny accepts Celia for who she is. Their mutual respect and understanding make them a force to be reckoned with and you know that they will both find happiness.

1391798,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004A8ZWVK,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","It's during the JFK Presidency and there are talks of civil rights by Martin Luther King but things haven't changed much for the black folks in Jackson, Mississippi and you can see the great division between them and the whites: separate hospitals, different neighborhoods, other parts of the bus and even the female maids, who take care of the little white children, are told to use a different bathroom because it is believed they carry diseases different from the white folk. It's pretty unsettling to see something that was taken as the norm and yet only happened quite recently in our history. A progressive white woman (Emma Stone) decides to get the maids to open up and talk about what it's like and after a lot of resistance (because they could easily be killed or beaten by white supremacists) they begin to share the injustices of their jobs as well as their little victory/revenge moments (which are recorded anonymously). Some of the white wives treat their maids as you would expect: some are nice, most follow the societal norm and a minority are just plain out manipulative and cruel. Octavia Spenser, who would pick up Best Supporting Actress from the Academy Awards, plays the smart mouthed Minny Jackson who gets that special moment with the pie. The cruel white girl ringleader had a mother she forces into a rest home. Until I saw the credits I didn't realize that was Sissy Spacek. Allison Janney (from the ""West Wing"") plays the mother of the main character. The budget for this picture was $45M and it has so far made over $206M (Wiki). The Academy Awards additionally nominated this film for Best Actress and Best Picture. It is based on a novel of a similar title by Kathryn Stockett.

1391804,A2ZSUIGBPVGKHN,B004A8ZWVK,Moira,"[0, 0]","This movie is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi and tells the story of an aspiring young Southern journalist who wants to tell what it is like to work as a housemaid/domestic helper from the black woman's perspective. Skeeter, whose friends are busy spending their days in a privileged world of playing bridge, serving in the Junior League, and entertaining, wants nothing more than to gain experience as a writer so she can go to New York and work for a large publishing company. Skeeter's friends are married and living in their perfect world of owning the right house, in the right neighborhood, having babies, and depending on their black maids to do the work of raising their children, cleaning their homes, doing their shopping and cooking their meals. Skeeter doesn't date or have a boyfriend; her goal is to become a writer, which is an embarrassment to her mother, and scandalous to her friends. Despite the times, Skeeter has a deep sense of how wrong the blacks are treated and she is both liked and respected by those who work for her own family as well as those who work for her friends. This is not the case with the snobby Miss Hilly and Miss Elizabeth, who both view their maids as less than human because they are black. Miss Hilly draws up an initiative to require all households who employ black help to build a special toilet for them because ""they carry different diseases from us"". This was a time when blacks were prohibited from using the same public toilets as whites, and were also forbidden from drinking from the same water fountain, as well as many other discriminatory practices that made Mississippi such a shameful bastion of racial segregation and discrimination.Aibileen and Minnie are the two maids that work for Miss Elizabeth and Miss Hilly, and are best friends who share their personal sorrows with each other. After Miss Hilly catches Minnie in her bathroom during a violent thunderstorm that prevents her from going outside to use the toilet, she fires Minnie and spreads lies that will insure Minnie is unable to find employment anywhere else in town. Aibileen tells Minnie that Celia Foote, an outcast from Hilly's social circle, and the woman who is married to Hilly's past boyfriend, is looking for help. Minnie, desperate for a job to support her children, swallows her pride and goes to work for Celia. It turns out Celia lives in a huge old mansion that her husband's family have owned for generations. She is a simple and sweet girl raised on the wrong side of the tracks who wants nothing more than to find a place in the world her husband was born into. She accepts Minnie as an equal, something that immediately raises Minnie's suspicions because of the prevailing racial prejudices in the Deep South against blacks. Both of them being outcasts from the circle of the Miss Hilly's world, and with reputations that are tarnished by Miss Hilly, they forge a bond slowly that will benefit them both in unique ways.Aibileen is approached by Skeeter to tell what it is like to work as a maid and, although at first resistant to the idea, she reluctantly begins to open up about the things she has experienced over many years working in the homes of white women and raising their children. It is a dangerous thing for both Skeeter and Aibileen in the climate of racial prejudice that exists, and they must keep their project secret. Skeeter has promised that she will never use Aibileen's real name, nor her own as the writer, and encourages Aibileen to see if Minnie might be willing to also tell of her perspective as to what it has been like to work as a maid for white families. Minnie is bitter over what she has suffered at the hands of the cruel Hilly, and grudgingly agrees to share as long as her name isn't used. Before long their trust in Skeeter and the years of resentment they have felt over their treatment leads Aibileen and Minnie to give up the secrets of the white women of Jackson as Skeeter sympathetically listens and pens their stories for a book titled ""The Help"".Minnie's desire to get revenge on Hilly leads her to carry out an act she calls ""the terrible awful"", something that is so outrageous that she is ashamed to ever tell anyone what she has done. It also is hilarious, and Hilly's slightly senile and forgetful mother witnesses it and laughs uproariously at Minnie's revenge, but this leads Hilly to put her mother in a nursing home because she is afraid she will tell everyone in town what happened and make her the laughing stock of Jackson. Eventually when racial tensions and injustices, including the murder of Medgar Evers, lead to the brutal treatment of one of the maids in Jackson, it serves as the catalyst that encourages the other maids of Jackson to open up to Skeeter about the way they have been treated over the years while working for white families, and they agree to spill their secrets, some of which are terribly sad, some of which are bittersweet, some of which are hilarious, and some of which are damning for the white families. Minnie tells Aibileen about ""the terrible awful"" she did to Miss Hilly and each maid knows that they have ""insurance"" to protect them since Miss Hilly would never let anyone believe the stories are set in Jackson once they are published, because Minnie's story of ""the terrible awful"", which is included in the many stories that will come to be told in ""The Help"", would make Hilly the joke of Jackson if anyone ever knew what Minnie did to her. As their stories are written, Skeeter prepares to include her own story of Constantine, the black maid who raised her from infancy, and how Skeeter's mother betrayed the loyalty and love Constantine had for the Phelan family, especially for Skeeter.Once finished and sent off to the publishing house in New York, the manuscript is hastily published to coincide with Dr. Martin Luther King's march on Washington, something that will bring the civil rights movement to the forefront of America as the struggle for racial equality tears at the fabric of the Old South, revealing the humiliating treatment of blacks which has been kept largely untold in other parts of the country.Skeeter's book comes at a time ripe for the telling. Once it hits stores in Jackson, everyone is buying it and wondering where the stories were originated because they seem to divulge things that fit with events among Jackson's white families although no mention is made of the author (simply ""anonymous"") or the town where the stories took place. As more and more interest in the book develops, Hilly buys it and when she reads about ""the terrible awful"" she knows Skeeter has written the book, but she tells everyone the book can't possibly be about Jackson. She confronts Skeeter about the book but Skeeter stands her ground and tells Hilly she can't prove anything, and Hilly can't - unless she wants to make herself and every other white family in her social circle look bad and expose the secrets which they had assumed would always be safe in the climate of white superiority, where the lives of their black maids could be ruined for the slightest reason. Now everything has changed and the tables have turned!Finally, Celia Foote decides to make an appearance at the annual Christmas Junior League gala so she can tell Miss Hilly that she never stole away her old boyfriend, because she believes this is why Miss Hilly hates her and has deliberately excluded her from being in the Junior League and the circle of wealthy white women that form Hilly and Elizabeth's coterie of friends. Little does she realize that she is about to make herself look like a fool among the snobby women of Jackson, even though she is married to the influential son of an old monied family. She is also about to discover that she will never be accepted, even if she tries to tell Hilly of her innocence in Hilly's breakup with Johnny. Although it makes for a sad and yet funny scene, the wheels are set in motion for everything to change as the The Help's stories circulate among Jackson's citizens and expose the terrible secrets and the injustices toward blacks that have been buried in secrecy for so longThroughout the movie are moments of extreme hilarity and moments of great sadness as the story unfolds, but the ending is one that provides redemption for Skeeter, Aibileen, Minnie, and even Celia Foote. The strength and empowerment that comes to those who have never known anything but powerlessness is the redemption, and the beginning of hope for a better life in the changing times of the civil rights movement.Having grown up as a white child in the South during the time this story takes place, I remember so vividly how racial segregation was - the signs that separated the use of public facilities for blacks and whites, as well as a time when blacks were not allowed to ride anywhere except the back of buses. It is a time that is burned into my mind and makes me deeply ashamed of the degrading treatment blacks suffered at the hands of whites. Even as a child, I remember the downcast eyes and the role of subservience that defined how blacks were expected to behave in the presence of whites. There is no exaggeration in this book as to the black experience in the Deep South. The ending of the movie was so uplifting as I'm The Living Proof is sung by Mary J. Blige! It is simply a marvelous movie. I highly recommend it!",5,Heart touching and funny too,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,9385,"['movie', 'set', '1960s', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'story', 'aspiring', 'young', 'Southern', 'journalist',

1391805,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004A8ZWVK,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","A relatively unknown director, Tate Taylor pulls a rabbit out of the hat with this surprisingly good film.  Admittedly the film is pointed at followers of Oprah as it never overplays the police violence, the murders, and the church desecrations of the black churches.  There are incidents but they are kept off screen for the most part.  Instead the film focuses on the mental abuse of black maids working for middle class whites in 60's Jackson Mississippi.A young writer played by Emma Stone manages to get a gig writing a book about maids in the south.  She struggles to get interviews with ""the help"" as they do not want to jeopardize their jobs or their lives.  Eventually they give in.  I didn't live in the South during this era, but the events seem pretty authentic to me.  Black maids raise children and the children eventually grow up and become the maid's bosses or the maid's daughter's bosses as their ""ownership"" is passed down.  The movie at well over 2 hours moves along briskly as we continue to root for maids in their effort to highlight their lives to the rest of the country.The filmmakers do a good job differentiating between the characters.  Every white person is not evil.  Every black person isn't an angel.  Of the evil white ladies, none is more evil than Hilly, nicely played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  Celia (Jessica Chastain) on the other hand is a sympathetic girl of ""white trash"" origins.  While Stone has a nice scene with her mother (Allison Janney), the real stars are Viola Davis as Aibileen, the first maid to come forward and her best friend Minny (Octavia L. Spencer).  Both give Oscar-worthy performances.  I was especially taken with Ms. Spencer who gives great depth and dimension to her character.",4,4 1/2 stars for another excellent fim of 2011,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,1740,"['relatively', 'unknown', 'director', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'rabbit', 'hat', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'pointed', 'followers', 'Oprah', 'never', 'police', 'violence', 'murders', 'church', 'desecrations', 'black', 'churches', 'are', 'incidents', 'are', 'kept', 'off', 'screen', 'most', 'part', 'Instead', 'film', 'mental', 'abuse', 'black', 'maids', 'working', 'middle', 'class', 'whites', '60', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi.A', 'young', 'writer', 'played', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'get', 'gig', 'writing', 'book', 'maids', 'south', 'get', 'interviews', 'help', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'jeopardize', 'jobs', 'lives', 'Eventually', 'give', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'South', 'era', 'events', 'seem', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'Black', 'maids', 'raise', 'children', 'children', 'eventually', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'maid', 'bosses', 'maid', 'daughter', 'bosses', 'ownership', 'passed', 'down', 'movie', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'moves', 'along', 'briskly', 'continue', 'root', 'maids', 'effort', 'highlight', 'lives', 'rest', 'country.The', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'differentiating', 'characters', 'Every', 'white', 'person', 'not', 'evil', 'black', 'person', ""n't"", 'angel', 'evil', 'white', 'ladies', 'none', 'more', 'evil', 'Hilly', 'nicely', 'played', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Celia', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'other', 'hand', 'sympathetic', 'girl', 'white', 'trash', 'origins', 'Stone', 'nice', 'scene', 'mother', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Aibileen', 'first', 'maid', 'come', 'forward', 'best', 'friend', 'Minny', 'Octavia', 'L.', 'Spencer', 'give', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'was', 'especially', 'taken', 'Ms.', 'Spencer', 'who', 'great', 'depth', 'dimension', 'character']",N/A

It was a time when everyone had to pull together to make ends meet when white families were so large and depended on farms and the Blacks would become extended parts of the family for their own survival as well and were never treated as less than we were.  It was just everyone helping each other as I innocently remember it and this movie brings back wonderful memories of those times.

While Emma Stone has seemingly proven that she can do no wrong (for me at least), it was Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who shined in this film which exposed both positives and negatives about the lives of ""the help"" in Mississippi during the Civil Rights movement.  Granted, there were more negatives, but that was to be expected.  This film is just a few steps from being considered a documentary.  While the plot may be depressing at times, it brings it's appropriate share of laughs and Miss Octavia Spencer is largely to thank for that.  I was also pleased to see Allison Janney in this picture as I've been a fan of hers since ""The West Wing"".  Like Ms. Stone, Miss Janney did not dissappoint as she plays a mother who's clearly dealing with the moral conflict of not being racist in Mississippi in the 1960s while dealing with her struggles against cancer.  Side note:  could I get the name of the acting coach who taught everyone their southern accents...that just made it all better.  Anyway, Viola Davis as a maternal figure who finds her oppurtunity to change what she sees as a never-ending cycle of oppression is terrific.  Miss Davis's more intraverted manners balance nicely with the outgoing nature brought by Octavia Spencer.  While Emma Stone's character traits aren't really unique or memorable except for her wanting to be judged for her mind instead of her body (i.e. she didn't major in ""husband hunting"" during her university years), it was these non-original, stock-character traits that fit her perfectly into the story, allowing the three leading ladies to develop the right amount of chemistry for this film.

I watched the DVD with my best friend, who had gotten it for Christmas. It seems to be pitched as a ""feel good"" movie, but I didn't feel all that good after seeing it.Don't get me wrong, as story it did what story is supposed to do: emotionally engage, entertain, and portray a world of its own creation. But once the curtain came down, it left me feeling unsettled and chagrined.The positives are that the time and place are vividly envoked--so much so that I was almost surprised when I looked out my window and saw December in Pennsylvania and not Jackson in the summertime. The plot certainly does grab and hold your attention, and the acting is terrific throughout.Things that were a bit out of kilter: as someone who grew up in the sixties, I knew right away that Skeeter's hair was way wrong. Everyone, but EVERYONE in 1962 had helmet hair. No way would a girl from an upper-class Southern family be allowed to leave the house with that cloud of spirals floating around her face. Also, the women are too thin. It was the norm for a woman, even a young one, to have a little pot below her waist. Check out period clothing, and you will see that the skirts are actually cut for that type of figure.I enjoyed the story and portrayal of the maids finally opening up and telling Skeeter their stories, but I was uncomfortable with the idea that blacks could only improve their lot when a benevolent white benefactor swooped down from the sky to lift them up. However, on further reflection I think that is to a certain extent true. This was a period in which blacks were automatically completely discounted as not intelligent enough to lift themselves up, so that it did take a white person becoming involved before most whites would even notice enough to disagree. Not because blacks are by nature stupid and ineffective; but because they were simply invisible to the white world.I also was hoping Skeeter would stay in Jackson and work for Civil Rights there, but again thinking further, I realized that a woman in her position most likely would've chosen to go to New York. She would probably have believed she could do more good getting her information out to a wider--and white Northern (and therefore more influential) audience, and she would have known there was no future for her as an individual in Mississippi.So although the film ended as it probably should have, as the denoument to a story it wasn't quite satisfying. But, the film is well put together, the narrative is strong, and the portrayals are excellent. I certainly recommend it, not only as a story but as a launching pad for discussion and real thought about the past and its role in shaping a better future.",4,"A ""Feel Good"" Movie?

While I feel that there were some great scenes and good acting, most notably  the character Minny, played by Octavia Spencer, the film really didn't measure up to the book.  The book at least had some detail and of course not all of that could be covered in a movie.  Also like a lot of books adapted to movies some of the elements are changed to make the outcome look better than it actually is, like what really happens to Skeeter's mom, played by Allison Janney.  Also I felt that most of the characters were flat--there was no dimension to them.  They were either mean spirited or kind.  Minny was the only one that showed any sort of emotion--she was outspoken, funny, and at the same time had a lot of compassion especially with her employer Celia, the ""white trash"" outcast who desperately needed a friend.

1391866,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B004A8ZWVK,P. Walker,"[0, 0]","This is a remarkable film of contrasts. Not just the blatantly obvious contrasts of black and white, rich and poor, free and slave, good and evil, courage and cowardice, or between those fighting for equality and those fighting to keep others from being equal. The film does a great job in showing the considerable contrast within Christianity itself. The conflict between the compassionate, loving, understanding attitude, contrasted with the fearful, vengeful, punishing attitude, all within groups of the same religion. Although, some may argue, this is inherent in man's nature, i.e., a ""Lord of the Flies"" type of characteristic.The true contrast is between faith and fear, although both are basically the same, belief. For example, if you have a fear of snakes then you must believe in the ability of a snake to harm you or you would not fear it. If a shepherd cannot get his sheep to follow by faith and trust, he drives them with fear using the dogs. We see this contrast in religions that emphasize either an extreme punishment or an extreme reward. The film is remarkable in the way it demonstrates the power of both faith and fear. The oppressed stand in faith against all odds prejudicial to them and the oppressors spew fear and hate in order to subjugate them. People will either recognize faith, love and hope, or they will recognize fear and hate and will lean toward one or the other.Fear causes torment, which leads to hate. A person is driven by fear and hate and begins to recognize the familiar communal voice of fear and hate around them. This voice redirects the fear and hate against whomever or whatever it chooses. Any inhibition is removed by destroying the morals and conscience through self-righteousness and self-justification. The voice, which is the actual source of the fear, then becomes the controlling influence. Depending on the source, fair and balanced, if truthfully noted, is actually fear and bias.The thing about contrast is that you can see perspective very clearly and this film refuses to allow any gray areas. No matter how much Hilly Holbrook tries to justify her iniquitous ways by lying to others and herself, you see through it without question. The scene where Celia comes to the bridge party and Hilly has everyone hide, even though the driveway and street are filled with cars. Or the benefit she holds for hungry African children, while at the same time she subjugates, persecutes, and oppresses the same in her own household and community. Or by taking pride in her warped sense of Christian charity by helping her maid by actually not helping her. Hilly lives in self-delusion and believes her own lies and thinks she has everyone else fooled also. Curiously, it is not Hilly's character that I find the most disgusting and offensive. Racists, bigots, homophobes, hate and fear-mongers can be recognized, we see them for what they really are, controlled by fear. It's Elizabeth's character that I find the most disturbing. The level of cowardice she exhibits by being a pawn is horrible. She doesn't realize she is simply being used. Hilly does not care for Elizabeth or anyone else, she controls them through fear in order to become substantial in her own eyes and those she deceives.The films strong message shows the only path to true freedom. Only by accepting the truth can you truly be free. If you continue to lie to yourself eventually you will meet someone who refuses to acknowledge the facade. Having the courage to define yourself and refusing to allow others to tell you how you should live your life is true freedom.

The acting is superb, and the storyline is almost always excellent (there are a few exceptions that I will mention later). But first, I want to address the criticism that this film perpetuates the ""mammy"" stereotype.I'm not sure the critics and I were watching the same film, because, frankly, this movie didn't do that. These are not subservient, complacent, happy to do as they were bid African American maids and nannies. These were women who lived in a world where black people could be lynched, or utterly ruined, by a white person's whim. They took the jobs that were available to them -- the jobs that white people didn't want. The fact of the matter is that generations of black women filled jobs like these after the civil war -- not because they liked it, or didn't have ambitions or abilities beyond raising white people's kids, but because white people set up a system that allowed them little else. These women came across as real people -- who saw the injustice in life, but also lived in a time and place where it was literally dangerous to say or do anything about it. They were resigned, but not ""mammies"".I do understand that this is a sensitive issue, but I think the critics should evaluate the characters, not just the occupations those characters held. Considering the ways these women buck the system -- from the ""horrible nasty"" to collaborating on a book to Aibileen authoring her own books -- I would say that what these maids did were not the acts of ""mammies"".There were a few things I did not like about this movie. One was Aibileen's use of ""You is..."" I don't remember her using any such phrases anywhere in the movie except when she was talking to her young charge. Otherwise, she has an exceptional command of the English language, is very well spoken, and ends up a writer (!!); there didn't seem a need for this dialect.Secondly, there was the latrines on the lawn bit. It's a good gag, but it didn't come off as very believable that people would dump old toilets on a prize winning lawn -- especially not without checking first.I also have reservations about the ""horrible nasty"" (I won't mention what that was, in case you don't already know)...I can't make up my mind if it was hilarious or not, and it doesn't help that it is referenced a LOT during the movie. Deserved, yes. Too far over the line? The jury is still out.That, though, is the extent of what I thought could have been improved. Otherwise, the characters were all very well done, and the storyline very interesting (and sad!). The acting, though, is the crown jewel in this film...everyone, and I do mean everyone, did such a good job. The actresses were really the ones who made this movie.

One woman is a maid and has lost her inner fire, and the other woman is trying to find herself despite the social restrictions and pressures of who she's ""supposed to be"".  Both women end up working together, writing a book about the lives of ""The Help"" in their small town, a behind the scenes look at the lives of poor black women in Mississippi.There were some absolutely great moments in this movie, some that broke your heart or even made you laugh outloud.

Also, I did not believe the character development of the maid was as good as it should have been.  The idea for the movie, was fantastic, but the idea needed a little more work in the writing and development department.Sometimes a good movie gets a lot of attention, partially because it's so unusual (the story) and the timing of when it came out (nothing else like it).

Viola Davis carries her main character with so much grace and dignity - it is magical to see her portray a housekeeper who is also a nanny.  Story is placed in the deep south, during 1960s when civil rights movement is taking its momentum.  But like every movement, it takes time for it to reach rural areas and small towns.Emma Stone plays Skeeter, a white girl from privileged family who is not looking for husband after her college graduation; she is looking to establish herself as a journalist and writer.  She is sensitive and caring person and she her physical appearance fits perfectly for her role.  Her curly hair expresses her inner rebellion of the world around her; her big eyes communicate a much deeper emotions which are hearbreaking once she starts meeting with maids who tell her their stories from their years of service to while affluent families in town.This is a fabulous movie for every generation and both genders.

The message of this film and its historic significance tip the scales in its favor. It is the first film I've been to in a very long time where the theater audience stood and applauded at the end. Some may say this is just a &#34;guilty white folks film&#34;, but having grown up in the South and having come of age (I graduated from high school in 1963) during the era in which this film is set, I can relate to much of the story. It is authentic in its telling of the relationship between white families, especially wealthy white families, and their &#34;Help&#34;. I say that from a white perspective; but I suspect the same is true for blacks who matured during that era. This story though is not heavy handed; it is balanced with just the right amount of pathos and humor; you will be laughing out loud one minute and reaching for a tissue the next. Hard to believe this is the first directorial effort for Tate Taylor, as he has crafted a masterful work here. The casting too is perfect. Viola Davis, who we don't see much on the big screen, shows why she is such a highly regarded stage actress with her portrayal of the maid, Aibileen Clark. Octavia Spencer delivers a superlative performance too, as Minny Jackson. Emma Stone, in what I believe is her best performance, plays the lead, Skeeter Phelan, an aspiring young writer, who coaxes the stories from the &#34;help&#34; for her book, appropriately titled &#34;The Help&#34;.

That has always seemed unfair to me, and is always annoying. Director Tate Taylor has assembled a dedicated, focused cast, and has presented a tale of fiction that may be pretty much like it was. To get away from the mundane lot of the abused Black maids, we have a white character, the sweet and clueless Celia, played to perfection by Jessica Chastain, whose inclusion just adds to the nastiness of the white female antagonists.Most males might be put off by this film, which has no major male characters and is purely from a female perspective. The book, too, was most popular with females. The bottom line is that this is a film with heart and integrity, an earnest attempt to present a riveting narrative. The acting is excellent, without exception. Viola Davis is fine as the central character, though she never really has a big ""scene"", but consistent in her sad demeanor, on a road to nothingness. Emma Stone is fine as Skeeter, the real protagonist; Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderfully nasty; Sissy Spacek is wonderfully spunky; the great Cecily Tyson has a too brief appearance, an important character, Skeeter's true inspiration. Allison Janney, too, is like an older version of Howard's. Octavia Spencer's Minny is feisty and fun, sweet and sad, the whole nine yards.But it's Jessica Chastain's Celia that is so fully formed, presenting practically every emotion available to an actress. Though from the ""wrong side of the tracks"", she's not stupid. She's definitely a fish out of water, is treated with contempt and ridicule, is truly devoted to her husband, makes light of regular disappointments, and is ready to give up until she meets Minny. I won't blab away the plot, but a particular scene where Minny comes to her rescue is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I can recall, handled by 2 very capable actresses.I enjoyed ""The Help"" very much. The innate goodness of people is well explored, as well as the conditioned, ignorant meanness of others. A good lesson in how to treat your fellow human being. Despite the ugliness that occurs, it's really a joyous film. Unfortunately, ALL the stories may never be known, and, I'm sure, weren't as positive.

1391890,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004A8ZWVK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 12]","&lt;strong>The Help&lt;/strong> (Tate Taylor, 2011)By any technical metric you would care to name, &lt;em>The Help&lt;/em> is an unqualified success. Writer/director Tate Taylor, normally an actor (&lt;em>Winter's Bone&lt;/em>), hit one out of the park in almost every imaginable way with this movie, only his second full-length feature behind the camera. Every cast member is excellent in his or her role, and a roster of solid performers all bring their A games to the table. The script is warm, funny (which I did not expect at all), and exceptionally well-paced. The cinematography is very pretty, if conventional. Even the soundtrack is manipulative without being too obtrusive (Thomas Newman > John Williams, but then these days everyone > John Williams). In other words, as a surface feature, or looked at as an entirely separate phenomenon than the book, &lt;em>The Help&lt;/em> is an unqualified success, one that deserves every bit of its hype and the almost-in-the-top-250 rating it has on IMDB as I write this.On the other hand, Hollywood, we need to sit down and have a talk about two phenomena prominently on display in this movie that have pissed a whole lot of people off. I'm not sure I'm the right person to have this talk with you, Hollywood, since I'm a white, almost-middle-aged male writing from a position of (at least relative) privilege. But you don't listen when black folks talk about it, even the black folks you seem to be so fond of. Maybe it'll sound different coming from someone else.First off: let's talk a little about the Magical Negro. (Those of you not reading this on Amazon who have never heard the term can find out a great deal more about it on wikipedia: [link removed for Amazon consumption].) What's up with that? Are we somehow incapable of mixing races in a mainstream Hollywood film without adding a Magical Negro trope? (The last film I remember that did so successfully was Wes Craven's &lt;em>The Serpent and the Rainbow&lt;/em> twenty-five years ago.) While there can be no doubting that Constantine (played here by the great Cicely Tyson--coincidentally, aunt to Cathy Tyson, who was so distinctly non-magical in &lt;em>The Serpent and the Rainbow&lt;/em>) fits the trope to a T, did you really have to go our of your way to hit every signpost? Couldn't you have made her, you know, a real, flesh-and-blood character? I realize that a superhuman ideal is great for tugging on the heartstrings when the inevitable confrontation occurs (we know from the movie's first five minutes that something has happened to Constantine, we just don't know what), and if your goal is to get people to get out the tissues while still in the theater, good on ya, you achieved your objective. If you want people to actually empathize with the character, so you get butts in seats for repeat showings despite outrageous ticket prices, however, you want to create a character who people can actually identify with. This is why the bean counters are more interested in the second week's gross for a film (and the percentage drop) than the media, who couldn't care less about anything but opening weekend. How many butts came &lt;em>back&lt;/em> for a second viewing? Like any other trope, the Magical Negro is a cardboard cutout, a person with little if any personality, a projection of the ideals of the screenwriter rather than a fully fleshed-out character. And like any other cardboard character, we look at them, we pity them... but we don't identify with them. We don't care.Second: for the love of god, Hollywood, you have suffered from this sickness as long as I've known you. In fact, from what I hear from people older than I am, you've suffered from it as long as you've been around. And it's time someone told you about it. It's this habit you have of optioning books, and then hiring screenwriters whose sole purpose, it seems, is to strip out any part of the book that might actually provoke thought. Now, before I launch into this diatribe, I will say right up front I have not yet read the book. I spent the drive home from the cinema listening to my wife detail the differences between book and film, and then went and backed that up with some research. While I understand that books need to be dumbed down for Hollywood for time constraints if nothing else (note: I don't know a single person who would have complained if Jackson's Lord of the Rings adaptations had been three times as long and included, you know, the rest of the story), it's the changes that are made that define whether an adaptation has an agenda or not. I love the way Mark Blankenship puts it, writing at The Critical Condition: ""Though it tells roughly the same story as the novel, it makes several small changes that seriously upend the racial balance. Much more than the novel, the movie is a story about white people being awesome and noble."" For example, Abilene's final monologue in the film speaks to oh-look-how-empowered-I-am-now!, and without knowing what happens immediately after that, the viewer is inclined to think ""hey, you know, she owes a [censored for Amazon consumption] of a lot to Skeeter"", rather than ""hey, Abilene used this newly-cultivated writing ability to go take Skeeter's old job at the Jackson Journal, which is why Mae Mobley was Abilene's last white child"". We go from Abilene being passively grateful to Abilene actively being &lt;em>empowered&lt;/em>. It makes me wonder how those who say the movie stuck so close to the book actually find a way to believe that. While we're on the subject of Abilene, stopping her first conversation with Skeeter at the ""I drank too much coffee"" joke makes for a nice feel-good scene, to be sure. It never gets into the subject which is actually supposed to be at the heart of the movie: &lt;em>why&lt;/em> Abilene had seventeen white children--the process of inculcation those white children went through that starts with ""you're my real mommy, Abilene!"" and ends with Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), a Klansman in lipstick. That's not something you can simply take out and still have a movie that's functionally the same as the book; it's a &lt;em>main theme&lt;/em>. It would be like, for example, taking John W. Campbell's novella ""Who Goes There?"" and making it into a film where the monster isn't a shapeshifter and there are women in the story. (Oh, wait, Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks did that in 1951 and called it &lt;em>The Thing from Another World&lt;/em>. John Carpenter's 1982 adaptation &lt;em>The Thing&lt;/em> is much closer to the original source material--and a far superior film.) And I haven't even touched on the whole Rachel debacle, mostly because that's what most critics (and I here use the term in the sense of ""people who are pillorying this adaptation"") touch on when they're looking at scenes that, in Blankenship's somewhat euphemistic language, ""seriously upend the racial balance.""I know how I sound here, and I feel kind of guilty about it. I know at least half of you reading this are staring at the screen with a slightly cocked expression thinking ""why does a white guy care about this stuff?"". For the same reason I care about the fact that Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks changed what is, arguably, the most terrifying monster ever seen in a horror novella (so wonderfully recreated by Rick Baker in the eighties) into James Arness in a suit that makes him look like giant rutabaga. Because these things are in the book, and the reason they are in the book is because the author felt they were important enough to include in the book. Because these changes were made specifically for the purpose of pulling in audiences (and the fact that I feel I have to parenthetically add that I mean &lt;em>white&lt;/em> audiences is telling), which brings up concepts of art vs. capital and which one always wins in the end if you put up with the Hollywood machine. But more than either of those things it's because &lt;em>this is our history&lt;/em>. This is our culture. And whether you're willing to admit it or not, Hollywood, how the generations below mine conceive of our history and culture in past time periods has a whole [censored for Amazon consumption] of a lot more to do with how you portray it than with what they read in history books, so every time you choose to sanitize some seemingly-niggling piece of detail in order to make something more palatable, you are potentially changing the historical viewpoint of &lt;em>an entire generation of moviegoers&lt;/em>. This is doubly distressing when you realize that even in cultures where there is a thriving film industry (Nigeria, India, Turkey, Ghana, New Zealand, France, and England all come to mind), the importation, distribution, and screening of American films, especially high-grossing Hollywood fare, is a billions-of-dollars-a-year business. &lt;em>Billions&lt;/em>. And you know how much is in a Ghanian schoolkid's history book about US history? As much as there is in an American kid's schoolbook about the history of Ghana... which means that all those kids overseas, assuming they're not told any different by older relatives who are far more in touch with world events than most Americans of the same age, have no other recourse for figuring out what actually happened.And needless to say, if you do realize all of this and you're still doing it? That's not neglectful. That's evil. That's The Party (a la Orwell) [censored for Amazon consumption]. ""We are at war with Eurasia. We have always been at war with Eurasia."" becomes ""blacks are free in America only because white people fought for their civil rights."" And a century from now when there's no one left alive who was actually there, no one left to set the story straight, what happens?Wow. Maybe I went a little overboard when I was doing that research. And it really is a testament to Taylor (who, I just read, is a ""longtime friend"" of Stockett's, though no details were given) that despite my outrage, which keeps growing the more I think about those ""minor"" changes, I can still turn around and recommend this movie without hesitation. To reiterate, this cast is outrageously good, and many of them are giving their best performances in years. I can't remember Sissy Spacek, whose role in the film is far too small for her character's irrepressible personality, having been this good in a movie since &lt;em>'night, Mother&lt;/em> in 1986. Allison Janney is always a treat. Emma Stone came into her own last year in &lt;em>Easy A&lt;/em>, and she does just as well here. Viola Davis, nominated for an Oscar for her work in &lt;em>Doubt&lt;/em>, fills the role of Abilene with a warmth and comfort rarely seen on a screen, and Octavia Spencer, who I think has been in every movie that's come out in the past ten years, is a perfect foil for her as trash-talking, hyper-caffeinated Minnie. And I'm just scratching the surface here. It's a [censored for Amazon consumption] of a roster, and it seems to me that everyone involved believed in the film just as passionately as did Taylor; enough, at least, to have all acted their hearts out. And as far as all the behind-the-scenes stuff goes, it's all very well executed, though I doubt anyone's going to be winning awards for, say, sound mixing here. So see it. But I beg you: please think about the process involved in making it after you do. Go out on the web and do the research, or read the book yourself, and then spend some quality time thinking about not just the empirical changes that were made, but the ways in which those changes affect how you think about the characters. Or, far more importantly, how Tate Taylor, who did the adaptation, and Dreamworks, who released the film, &lt;em>wanted&lt;/em> you to think about the characters. (How much of the finished film was Taylor's actual screenplay and how much was studio interference is one of those questions to which it's almost impossible to get a good answer, where any film is concerned; even the ""director's cut"" of any given mainstream movie, unless it's self-released, still goes through the studio system, the MPAA, etc. And, of course, if studio interference happens before shooting, pieces of screenplay may never get filmed.) Using the film as a springboard to think about the Hollywood studio system and the way it sanitizes history is far more useful than using it as ""rah rah rah, white people helped the poor [censored for Amazon consumption] out of their misery and now everything's peachy!"" propaganda. *** ",4,Warning: I got a little passionate in this review...,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,12507,"['lt',

1391891,AE31M52VLKOG6,B004A8ZWVK,Robert G Yokoyama,"[13, 15]","The Help is the best film I have seen this year.  This film is about the examples of accepted racism in the early sixties, but it is also about the friendship between women. I like the way director Tate Taylor deals with both subjects equally well.There is a very beautiful song included in the movie. It is entitled ""The Living Proof"". It is performed by R and B singer Mary J. Blige.  This is such a moving song about enduring hard times but still having a sense of dignity about life.  The soundtrack also includes classic songs by Chubby Checker and Frankie Valli, but the new Blige song is definitely the highlight in regards to the music.The performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are excellent.  They are two black maids who both work for white families.  They cook, clean and raise other people's children.  These maids do their jobs do their jobs with such dignity.  I admire these fictional characters.  They seem like real people to me.  These actresses bring the characters of a novel to life on screen.  Emma Stone plays an aspiring writer who documents the experiences of these two women in a book entitled The Help.  Bryce Dallas Howard plays a racist white woman.  Jessica Chastain plays another white female character with a much softer heart. Sissy Spacek gives the movie a humorous element with her performance.  I laughed and cried watching The Help.

1391893,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B004A8ZWVK,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","This is a fine film, about a group of women in a dynamic time when many certainties and ways of doing things are coming into question.  The setting is Mississippi, perhaps the most violent Jim Crow state in the Union, composed of many, many layers.  There are the affluent whites, most of whom have no empathy for those not in their narrow world, and ""the help"", the black women who do most of the chores around the house and are participants but not part of the family.Enter into the mix a feisty young college grad, who has vivid memories of her nanny, played by the amazing Cicely Tyson, and who is accepted by the ""good"" whites but never quite fit in.  There is a mystery to her disappearance from the family and the young lady, who wants to write for a living, can't get answers from her rigid mother.  She finally get a job at the local paper in the journalistic underclass that writes for a name-brand columnist on rather mundane household issues.  But what she really wants to do is a book on the domestics, who she goes about cultivating.  The nannies are afraid to talk for the record, realistically fearing that they may be lynched or ostracized.  Of course, with the push of an aggressive editor (a wonderfully realistic and manipulative character played by Steenbowgen), she gets their stories as events unfold.  The stories are wonderful.A subplot is a fight she has with one of her old friends, who displays the kind of racism that is in the bones of many southerners - not overt, and fully justified in her mind (""they are different"", ""separate but equal""), and ultimately cruelly lacking in empathy or understanding.  The writer plays her along, never confronting her, yet working to expose her hypocrisy and narcissism and in the end, almost blackmailing her into silence.Interestingly, the good guys in this are not the best looking.  This is a very fun reversal.  The film also strives to be realistic, without a hint of over-played comedy yet many funny and ironic moments that are very real.  The only relatively weak performance, unfortunately, was the writer; some of her acting did not always ring true to me.The film moved me for many reasons.  I too had a nanny, as my mother was one of the first career women of her generation, and I benefitted greatly from her intelligence and support while growing up.  I loved her, yet also feel I never did enough to thank her.  This brought tears to my eyes.  I also had relatives in the south, some of whom I still consider close family.  Their attitudes to race shocked me, though some of them struggled with it.  The film helped me to reflect on this yet again.",4,a moving and realistic look into a changing deep south,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,2631,"['fine', 'film', 'group', 'women', 'dynamic', 'time', 'when', 'many', 'certainties', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'coming', 'question', 'setting', 'Mississippi', 'perhaps', 'most', 'violent', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'state', 'Union', 'composed', 'many', 'many', 'layers', 'are', 'affluent', 'whites', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'empathy', 'not', 'narrow', 'world', 'help', 'black', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'most', 'chores', 'house', 'are', 'participants', 'not', 'part', 'family.Enter', 'mix', 'feisty', 'young', 'college', 'grad', 'who', 'vivid', 'memories', 'nanny', 'played', 'amazing', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'who', 'accepted', 'good', 'whites', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'mystery', 'disappearance', 'family', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'write', 'living', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'answers', 'rigid', 'mother', 'finally', 'get', 'job', 'local', 'paper', 'journalistic', 'underclass', 'name-brand', 'columnist', 'rather', 'mundane', 'household', 'issues', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'book', 'domestics', 'who', 'cultivating', 'nannies', 'are', 'afraid', 'talk', 'record', 'realistically', 'fearing', 'may', 'be', 'lynched', 'ostracized', 'course', 'push', 'aggressive', 'editor', 'wonderfully', 'realistic', 'manipulative', 'character', 'played', 'Steenbowgen', 'stories', 'events', 'unfold', 'stories', 'are', 'wonderful.A', 'subplot', 'fight', 'one', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'kind', 'racism', 'bones', 'many', 'southerners', 'not', 'overt', 'fully', 'justified', 'mind', 'are', 'different', 'separate', 'equal', 'ultimately', 'cruelly', 'lacking', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'writer', 'along', 'never', 'confronting', 'yet', 'working', 'expose', 'hypocrisy', 'narcissism', 'end', 'almost', 'blackmailing', 'silence.Interestingly', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'looking', 'very', 'fun', 'reversal', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'realistic', 'hint', 'over-played', 'comedy', 'yet', 'many', 'funny', 'ironic', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'only', 'relatively', 'weak', 'performance', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'writer', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'ring', 'true', 'me.The', 'film', 'moved', 'many', 'reasons', 'too', 'had', 'nanny', 'mother', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'career', 'women', 'generation', 'benefitted', 'greatly', 'intelligence', 'support', 'growing', 'up', 'loved', 'yet', 'also', 'feel', 'never', 'did', 'enough', 'thank', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'also', 'had', 'relatives', 'south', 'whom', 'still', 'consider', 'close', 'family', 'attitudes', 'race', 'shocked', 'struggled', 'film', 'helped', 'reflect', 'yet', 'again']",N/A
1391894,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B004A8ZWVK,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[0, 0]","This movie and the book which originally inspired it undoubtedly takes some liberties with explaining race and gender relations.I watched it as a person with disabilities who did grow up with my own restrictions and laws. The book and this film does not deal with disability (except for fleeting references to cancer in Skeeter's mother), but I could certainly relate to the experiences and issues raised in 'The Help'.I give the screenplay kudos for publically explaining that the women did face discrimination and segregation on a regular basis. It realistically portrays the numerous rules and customs which governed the mobility of Abileen and the other domestic workers in 1960's Jackson. Limited mobility translated into difficult and limited life choices.When Skeeter 'really' interviews Aibileen, both are obviously cautious when she goes to the house in the 'Negro' part of town. Having researched State laws then on the books, Skeeter visibly starts to understand how much trouble these interviews could actually cause. It is different than asking a domestic to 'help' answer a newspaper advice column.Because she is not undertaking this assignment lightly, she then wins over the trust of Minny and others who were initially more skeptical of motives for wanting to write about 'their' lives.  They come to trust Skeeter, forming a multi-cultural sisterhood out of the business arrangment.Of course, you would be skeptical too after a life-time of mistreatment, having to clean up for others for inadequate pay. The domestics could not even use the in-house toilets of their employers! And they witnessed the abuse which these 'good' women subject their own families to, refusing to change a child's soiled diaper until their morning arrival.While I'm uneasy how much gennuine 'care' a domestic actually felt towards the children of their employers, arriving at a house and seeing a young child in soiled clothing had to be troubling and frustrating because of inevitably produced health problems. Proving the insanity of racism, the domestics were actually being stereotyped as the 'unclean' ones!Bryce Dallas Howard gives a great performance as the evil Hilly Holbrook. This president of the Jackson Junior League is so interested in collecting canned food for 'poor starving children in Africa'. Holbrook thne ironically chooses to ignore the extreme poverty and violent conditions her own domestic and others routinely face every single day because of Jim Crow Laws. Becoming a domestic was the only kind of work which these women were able to obtain!And then, several neighbors believe that only a 'negress' wrote the book-within-a-movie which eventually gets published from these interviews. The idea that another white person could be interested enough to listen to 'those people' is genuinely unfathomable: Domestics are expected to listen to families as part of their job, but their employers aren't ever expected to recognize their hard work.An exception is Ceila Foote who is herself 'different' in this era. She is recovering from a series of miscarriages and really does need an extra pair of hands as part of her road to recovery. She proactively eats in the kitchen with Minny and provides Minny with the care to escape domestic violence which Hilly and other employers never would. This actually shocks the usually-outspoken Minny. She recognizes that important cultural and social barriers were being broken--wanting them finally broken and actually getting to this point were two very different actions.As much as she needs a job, Minny is intially unsure if Ceila is playing some kind of 'game' with her. Unlike Hilly, the lower-income Celia is less concious of the racial barriers of the era. She and her husband (who actually might have harassed Minny in another screenplay) are sincerely nice to Minny.An obvious strength of this movie and why I was interested in seeing it was that the civil rights movement is used as backdrop. It shows everyday people actually working to change their difficult conditions during the era, something which should still resonate in our era of Occupy Wall Street. The women weren't just passively accepting the discrimination and segregation which was very much a part of their daily lives. And they are also very much concious of 'national' events such as President Kennedy's and Medgar Evers's assassination, without themselves being these 'famous' names.Skeeter did help the domestics initially tell their stories. But Aibileen and her colleagues are the only ones who were then capable of taking the received book royalty money and deciding what to do with it. They helped each other and themselves make a better life.My only real complaint is the menu design--which looks like it was pirated.

1391910,A1A61HHIIDFZMT,B004A8ZWVK,Sarah,"[10, 12]","Reading the book first would definitely be my advice before viewing this movie because with the movie it seems to focus solely on racial tensions and that's honestly not what the book is about. The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, ""Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought."" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, ""Rachel"" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't. It's mediocre at best. The book is truly wonderful.",3,Please read the book first!,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,5936,"['Reading', 'book', 'first', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'advice', 'viewing', 'movie', 'movie',

1391917,A2VM2PGEJQ7FSW,B004A8ZWVK,Scott W. Bryant,"[0, 0]","After initially being rejected by over 60 publishers, Kathryn Stockett's The Help was finally published in February of 2009.  Since that time, this incendiary tale of the small and not-so-small abuses suffered by black housekeepers in the 1960s has gone on to sell over 5 million copies, as it spent over 100 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List.Set in Jackson Mississippi during the early 1960s, the film tells the story of Skeeter Phelan, a young southern society girl who longs to become a writer.  When Skeeter's beloved housekeeper is suddenly dismissed under pressure from her mother's society friends, Skeeter is concerned and begins to document the stories of her friend's domestic workers.  As one black woman after the next courageously steps forward to tell her tale, the book begins to take shape, and a town will be forever changed.My reaction to this film is somewhat hard to pin down.  On the one hand, I am always drawn to stories where someone has the courage to swim against the stream, and in so doing, brings justice to those that have been oppressed.  These are important stories to tell, for they remind us that change does not often begin in the corridors of power.  Change begins when insignificant people dare to speak prophetic truth into a world that is desperate for truth to be spoken.On the other hand, movies like this sometimes feel ""safe"" because they are told from a distance.  Fifty years after the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, how many people would genuinely argue that black people did not suffer under white society?  So it's easy to root for the heroes, demonize the villains, and feel as if  ""the job is done.""  And there is a danger in that feeling as if the ""job is done"" because we are encouraged to believe that we can sit safely in the comforts of our own homes.How much more exciting would it be to see a story set in the contemporary world in which someone dared to tell the story of the plight of modern day Native Americans or modern day slaves?  How much more compelling would it be to have to face our own complicit guilt in avoiding the issues and burying our collective heads in the sand?In the end, I strongly recommend viewing The Help, and dare you not cheer as Hilly eats the pie.Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.",4,The Help: A One-Minute Film Review,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2334,"['initially', 'being', 'rejected', '60', 'publishers', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'Help', 'was', 'finally', 'published', 'February', '2009', 'time', 'incendiary', 'tale', 'small', 'not-so-small', 'abuses', 'suffered', 'black', 'housekeepers', '1960s', 'gone', 'sell', '5', 'million', 'copies', 'spent', 'over', '100', 'weeks', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Best', 'Seller', 'List.Set', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'early', '1960s', 'film', 'story', 'Skeeter', 'Phelan', 'young', 'southern', 'society', 'girl', 'who', 'become', 'writer', 'When', 'Skeeter', 'beloved', 'housekeeper', 'suddenly', 'dismissed', 'pressure', 'mother', 'society', 'friends', 'Skeeter', 'concerned', 'document', 'stories', 'friend', 'domestic', 'workers', 'one', 'black', 'woman', 'next', 'courageously', 'forward', 'tell', 'tale', 'book', 'take', 'shape', 'town', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'changed.My', 'reaction', 'film', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'one', 'hand', 'am', 'always', 'drawn', 'stories', 'where', 'someone', 'courage', 'swim', 'stream', 'so', 'doing', 'justice', 'have', 'been', 'oppressed', 'are', 'important', 'stories', 'tell', 'remind', 'change', 'not', 'often', 'begin', 'corridors', 'power', 'Change', 'when', 'insignificant', 'people', 'dare', 'speak', 'prophetic', 'truth', 'world', 'desperate', 'truth', 'be', 'spoken.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movies', 'feel', 'safe', 'are', 'told', 'distance', 'Fifty', 'years', 'dawn', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'United', 'States', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'genuinely', 'argue', 'black', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'white', 'society', 'easy', 'root', 'heroes', 'demonize', 'villains', 'feel', 'job', 'done', 'danger', 'feeling', 'job', 'done', 'are', 'encouraged', 'believe', 'can', 'sit', 'safely', 'comforts', 'own', 'homes.How', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'story', 'set', 'contemporary', 'world', 'someone', 'dared', 'tell', 'story', 'plight', 'modern', 'day', 'Native', 'Americans', 'modern', 'day', 'slaves', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'face', 'own', 'complicit', 'guilt', 'avoiding', 'issues', 'burying', 'collective', 'heads', 'sand', 'end', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'Help', 'dare', 'not', 'cheer', 'Hilly', 'pie.Further', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bloodstainedink.wordpress.com']",N/A

Hollywood has been making variations of the same tired movie for half a century now.  It's the classical neo-liberal trade-off -- you want to simultaneously vilify whites as a race and get whites to buy tickets, so you show one of them championing the Hollywood version of the black cause.  It's both insulting to whites, the vast majority of whom have nothing to answer for, and insulting to blacks, because it paints them as being unable to succeed without liberal whites to save them.As with most made-for-Oscars liberal agit-prop pieces, the acting is quite good and the fit-and-finish are above reproach.  Hollywood's alien elite typically pulls out all the stops for these template movies, and this is no exception.  Leukophobes and self-styled liberal saviors of black America will love it.

1391933,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B004A8ZWVK,S. Morales,"[1, 2]","The Help in its idea alone is perhaps one of the most original ideas to come along in recent film history. I mean to say, a movie based on the hardships and life of African-American female housemaids during the 1960s? Not only that, but their Caucasian house bosses and all the social borders, stigmas, prejadices and love that intermix. The Help stars a stellar cast who some by no surprise are up for 2011 Oscar nominations, not to also mention the film's Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the Year. A very well-deserved achievement.The film takes us into a fairly well off suburban neighborhood during the 1960s, when the first few ripples of the civil rights movement was beginning, and how it affected the always strict relationship that these Caucasian homeowners had with their maids. The film stars the up and coming Emma Stone as Skeeter, the single, headstrong, and brave writer who is on a mission to write a book detailing all the stories of the African-American maids around the neighborhood, to create a piece from their own point of view. This of course causes much controversy as not only are the maids hesitant to take part, as doing so may cause them to get into heaps of trouble, as well as risk their ability to ever be hired again, but also frightens her Caucasion relatives and friends, as writing such a book would risk bringing a dramatic change to their comfortable and stable domineering relationship with their housemaids. Viola Davis and Octavian Spencer play 2 other housemaids with their own house bosses - the spoiled, trite and cruel 'Hilly' played by Bryce Dallas Howard and 'Celia' played entertainingly and adorably well as the bubbly and joyful yet strong new-girl-on-the-block by Jessica Chastain. Viola and Octavian put on Oscar-nominated performances and truly steal the show, bringing us humor, compassion and stellar wit to their characters. Their Oscar nominations are extremely well-deserved. Veteran actress Allison Janney plays the insecure and emotionally struggling mother of Skeeter, who is most on the fence about her firing of her oldest housemaid, struggling with her love and compassion vs. her social status.The film brings shows us all the troubles and tribulations of the housemaids (there are others besides Viola and Octavia in more minor roles with their own homeowners played well by other supporting cast members), but not only that, the film also displays the tension between the Caucasian homeowners themselves, thus showing us that even though they are at a socially sigmatic position as the white ""slave-drivers,"" they do not embrace such a status, yet struggle to show as much compassion to their housemaids meanwhile maintaining the authority society tells them they must have.Our star, Skeer (Emma Stone) encounters tension from both sides, as well as from her mother who can't stand to see her single anymore. She eventually begins her work with writing her book and things flair up from there.What makes this such an incredible film is its love for the characters. Dialogue throughout is extremely precise in terms of dialect and tone, not to also mention interesting and very well written. The amazing performances only highlight this aspect, and we grow to love the characters through all their struggles. The most vital being 2 in particular - Skeeter's frustration with her family as the firing of their oldest maid to her is akin to the firing of her own mother (as the housemaid for the most part RAISED Skeeter herself), and Aibileen's (Viola Davis) struggles with overcoming the death of her son and all the scars that has left her in terms of virtually all Caucasians; she walks the line between humility and deeply embedded anger, meanwhile always walking in a state of ongoing sadness.The drama with the homeowner side of things eventually grows as more of the comedic relief throughout the film, but the audience will be much more interested in how the housemaids overcome their side of things. If there was any flaw, I felt that towards the end, while the struggles with the White homeowner's relationships build to be more entertaining and not so much heartfelt, things felt a bit forced by the end, yet it never goes so far as to step over the line of unbelievability.The pacing and editing in the film is spot-on, and even with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, you'll feel the need to watch this one again and again, simply because the setting, pacing and dialogue in the film is simply either too entertaining, passionate and soothing as a whole.Lastly, for all the guys out there worried about their girlfriends or wives dragging them to see this one, please keep in mind that this is NOT a ""Chick Flick."" Far from it. No, this is a realistic fiction (although based on the author's true life story) film about the struggles of people trying to live through an era where they were being both pushed down, intimidated, yet freed from years and years of segregation. Instead of this being a film displaying the civil rights movement as a whole (as in the film Malcom X), this scopes in on one suburban neighborhood, showing us what everyday people did to deal with the societal changes, and all the inner struggles as they now had to find a line between tradition and societal progression.Overall a fantastic, heartwarming, gritty, and truely moving film.",5,"A

1391938,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B004A8ZWVK,S. Schell,"[2, 3]","Few films have the power to make me cry.  There are the rare ones out there that have made me misty, sometimes even managing to encourage a tear or two to roll down my cheek.  There are also few films adapted from books I've read of which I've not been disappointed by the result, however small or great.  A film's impact, however, becomes abundantly clear when the audience remains in their seats in poignant silence nearly ten minutes after the end credits have started rolling, so moved by what they've seen that they take that much time to reflect and/or regain their composure.  This is the point at which film transcends it medium and becomes art.  Laughter, tears, and catharsis - this was my experience seeing ""The Help"".Adapted from author Kathryn Stockett's mega best seller of the same name, ""The Help"" tells the story of the impenetrable and time-tested bonds between women and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, setting it against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the sweltering summer temperatures and racially-charged atmosphere of Jackson, Mississippi.  Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Stone) is the film's central character, an Ole Miss graduate who instead of aspiring to marriage and children like all her friends before her dreams of making a name for herself as a journalist and author.  Brought up in an era where African-American housemaids and field workers were commonplace (she was raised by a black housekeeper herself), Skeeter sets herself apart from the rest of Jackson's residents with her staunchly liberal views.  Confounded and opposed to the treatment that friends and family bear upon the help, she is even more horrified when her best friend Hilly Holbrook (Howard) issues a ""Household Sanitation Initiative"", a proposal which strongly recommends that a separate bathroom for blacks be a requirement in every white home.Fed up with the unrelenting bias of nearly everyone around her, Skeeter embarks on a radical and risky project - to document the stories of black housemaids and share their viewpoints in the effort to open people's minds.  Starting first with veteran housemaid Aibileen (Davis) and growing to more than 30 different women over time, Skeeter's book attempts to rip the blindfold of ignorance from everyone's eyes and spur a collapse in Jackson's longstanding racial divide.Written and directed for the screen by Tate Taylor, ""The Help"" serves as his directorial debut and considering the actors with whom he worked he had an easy time about it.  The cast is superior - Emma Stone is golden as Skeeter, a less than stellar beauty who shines nonetheless with ambition and integrity, a woman who stubbornly pursues the truth while battling quietly with uncertainty.  Octavia Spencer is uproarious as the feisty Minnie; Bryce Dallas Howard manages to incur all the intended hatred for the character of Hilly, her high nose and icy stare masterful; Jessica Chastain is delightful as the ditzy and buxom Celia Foote, her squeaky giggles, flirtatious prancing, and high, timid speech seeming to spring directly from Stockett's pages.  It should serve as no surprise that Academy Award nominee Viola Davis gives the film's most arresting performance, able to detain a viewer's heart with one raw and penetrating look, one succinctly delivered line.  The film's final scene is the most heartrending, Aibileen bidding both fond and hard-edged farewells alike as she walks down a long suburban road, one that serves as a symbol to the long road that many African-Americans have walked in their pursuit for equality.Bottom line: Though a few things have been changed for dramatic effect (a commonality for adaptations), ""The Help"" is a movie of which readers of Stockett's novel should be proud.  Despite its obvious invitation to controversy, the film packs an emotional punch with its historical backdrop, stirring story and bravado performances.  To all the women in the audience: be it a tissue or a shirt sleeve, you will find yourself at a loss for words and wiping away tears when all is said and done.",5,Sublime,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,4081,"['Few', 'films', 'have', 'power', 'make', 'cry', 'are', 'rare', 'ones', 'there', 'have', 'made', 'misty', 'sometimes', 'even', 'managing', 'encourage', 'tear', 'two', 'roll', 'down', 'cheek', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'films', 'adapted', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'result', 'however', 'small', 'great', 'film', 'impact', 'however', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'when', 'audience', 'seats', 'poignant', 'silence', 'nearly', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'started', 'rolling', 'so', 'moved', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'reflect', 'and/or', 'regain', 'composure', 'point', 'film', 'medium', 'art', 'Laughter', 'tears', 'catharsis', 'was', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Help', '.Adapted', 'author', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'mega', 'best', 'seller', 'same', 'name', 'Help', 'story', 'impenetrable', 'time-tested', 'bonds', 'women', 'right', 'life', 'liberty', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'setting', 'backdrop', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'sweltering', 'summer', 'temperatures', 'racially-charged', 'atmosphere', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'Eugenia', 'Skeeter', 'Phelan', 'Stone', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'graduate', 'who', 'instead', 'aspiring', 'marriage', 'children', 'friends', 'dreams', 'making', 'name', 'journalist', 'author', 'Brought', 'up', 'era', 'where', 'African-American', 'housemaids', 'field', 'workers', 'were', 'commonplace', 'was', 'raised', 'black', 'housekeeper', 'Skeeter', 'apart', 'rest', 'Jackson', 'residents', 'staunchly', 'liberal', 'views', 'Confounded', 'opposed', 'treatment', 'friends', 'family', 'bear', 'help', 'even', 'more', 'horrified', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook', 'Howard', 'issues', 'Household', 'Sanitation', 'Initiative', 'proposal', 'strongly', 'separate', 'bathroom', 'blacks', 'be', 'requirement', 'white', 'home.Fed', 'up', 'unrelenting', 'bias', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Skeeter', 'radical', 'risky', 'project', 'document', 'stories', 'black', 'housemaids', 'share', 'viewpoints', 'effort', 'open', 'people', 'minds', 'Starting', 'first', 'veteran', 'housemaid', 'Aibileen', 'Davis', 'growing', 'more', '30', 'different', 'women', 'time', 'Skeeter', 'book', 'attempts', 'rip', 'blindfold', 'ignorance', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'spur', 'collapse', 'Jackson', 'longstanding', 'racial', 'divide.Written', 'directed', 'screen', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'Help', 'directorial', 'debut', 'considering', 'actors', 'whom', 'worked', 'had', 'easy', 'time', 'cast', 'superior', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'golden', 'Skeeter', 'less', 'stellar', 'beauty', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'ambition', 'integrity', 'woman', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'truth', 'battling', 'quietly', 'uncertainty', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'uproarious', 'feisty', 'Minnie', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'incur', 'intended', 'hatred', 'character', 'Hilly', 'high', 'nose', 'icy', 'stare', 'masterful', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'delightful', 'ditzy', 'buxom', 'Celia', 'Foote', 'squeaky', 'giggles', 'flirtatious', 'prancing', 'high', 'timid', 'speech', 'seeming', 'spring', 'directly', 'Stockett', 'pages', 'should', 'serve', 'surprise', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'film', 'most', 'arresting', 'performance', 'able', 'detain', 'viewer', 'heart', 'one', 'raw', 'penetrating', 'look', 'one', 'succinctly', 'delivered', 'line', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'most', 'heartrending', 'Aibileen', 'bidding', 'fond', 'hard-edged', 'farewells', 'alike', 'down', 'long', 'suburban', 'road', 'one', 'symbol', 'long', 'road', 'many', 'African-Americans', 'have', 'walked', 'pursuit', 'equality.Bottom', 'line', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'commonality', 'adaptations', 'Help', 'movie', 'readers', 'Stockett', 'novel', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'obvious', 'invitation', 'controversy', 'film', 'emotional', 'punch', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'stirring', 'story', 'bravado', 'performances', 'women', 'audience', 'be', 'tissue', 'shirt', 'sleeve', 'will', 'find', 'loss', 'words', 'wiping', 'away', 'tears', 'when', 'said', 'done']",N/A

1391940,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B004A8ZWVK,Steven Carrier,"[112, 127]","""The Help"" works as well as it does because it doesn't offer easy answers. This lovely and sometimes extraordinary film is not concerned with big sermons about clivil rights, religion or easy to swallow messages. The film is simply about behavior; how we should act, morally, towards other people, no matter who they might be. This thematic line is structured nicely throughout the film by zeroing in on a select group of people. This was a smart move since the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s is just too large a subject to truly flesh out in a 2 hour film. Because the film is about actual characters instead of predisposed, prepackaged lessons, the audience can take with them what they choose from the story (none of the characters have a major epiphany, each just starts to become aware of their behavior and effects, both good and bad- they all have so much more life to live). Surprisingly the film rarely gets melodramatic, and when it does it almost seems cheep and easy. Thankfully the films few flaws (structure, pacing, some silly dialogue here and there- ""You broke her heart...!"") can be overlooked due to the tremendous performances. Each actress is exceptional in their own ways with the wonderful Viola Davis stealing the film. Emma Stone is reliable here as always and proves that she can be funny and carry dramatic weight in the same film. I have always considered Bryce Dallas Howard to be a very accomplished actress and hopefully her scathing, pointed work will be recognized. Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain find a tender chemistry all their own. I have to say that ""The Help"" really, truly surprised me. I have never read the mega-selling novel from which it's based but I can tell you the film is a beautiful testament to American history and is a great display for some truly fine acting. For those who are turned off by sermonizing, preachy, obnoxious message movies (like myself), ""The Help"" is far from that.

The last deleted scene - while only about a minute in length adds more to the story.The BluRay set includes the above as well as more deleted scenes and an 11-minute featurette where local women and their mothers (who were ""help"" during the 1960s discuss the real life of being a ""help"").

1391968,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B004A8ZWVK,The Cool Guy,"[63, 104]","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***I watched this movie and, for what it is worth, enjoyed it at the time. But upon further reflection, I think this movie is not very good.There are good moments in the movie, but then there are other moments that seem jarringly unrealistic. In another movie I wouldn't care. But in a film that at its core purports to accurately depict racism in the 50's / 60's, this starts to become a big problem for me later on.And yes, I know it is just a movie - not non-fiction. But with the amount of people touting this as an ""important"" or ""life changing"" movie, I think a bit of extra thinking is in order.One of the problems to me is that the main characters seem very shallow. Skeeter is the plucky young writer who is willing to face injustice, no matter the cost. Hilly is the EVIL racist who is set on destroying black people's lives. There's also an airhead blonde who serves little purpose in the movie, and a few bad mothers tossed in for fun. The black maids are all portrayed pretty similarly. They are all shown as good, honest people, many of whom raise and care for the babies of bad white mothers.Skeeter in particular seemed like a very unrealistic character. When the person who wrote the story makes the main character a writer, you know you are in for trouble. It comes off as self-indulgent as best. Mostly, it feels anachronistic. She's a liberal crusader for civil rights, and she arrived at this position how? From the maid being fired? I'm not buying it. Sure, there were some white people in Mississippi who cared about equal rights for blacks, but not many. And those who acted upon those beliefs were punished for it.And that brings me to another problem I have with Skeeter. She never suffers the true consequences of her actions. Never gets fired. Never receives death threats. Instead, she gets rewarded. She gets a nice cushy job in New York. The end of the movie sees her abandoning her black ""friends"" in Mississippi and heading off to a nice career for herself, never to have to worry about race-related matters again.What? You say her boyfriend dumped her for her beliefs? That was negative, right? Oh, puh-lease. That in no way compared to the kind of things that true civil rights advocates suffered. Losing a boyfriend would have been the least of her worries.That brings me to another thing I don't like in this movie - how it portrays men. The men are either non-existent, or fools. Buffoons or worse. Mostly, they just exist as props for the women in the story, who comprise the main characters. Nothing wrong with that, but I would have preferred for the movie to at least made some attempt to not show every man in it as a blockhead.The movie makes some attempt to avoid stereotypes and give the characters some depth, but still falls flat. I could not relate at all to most of the main characters. Maybe that's because I'm a guy, but I don't think so. It feels like weak writing.The writing went off the rails in a lot of scenes. One that stood out to me was when all the toilets were delivered to Hilly's front yard, and she has this big over-dramatic public meltdown. First, I find it hard to believe that people would dump that many toilets without at least knocking on the door. Second, I don't see a tough character like that bawling in public at all. But both events served the author of the story in her effort to make us feel that Evil Hilly got what she deserved.Speaking of Hilly... Bryce Dallas Howard stars, and man is she hot! God, what a babe. It's hard to believe she's related to Clint ""Have some tranya"" Howard. Dang, that guy looks like he was hit with the ugly stick. Okay, getting back on topic...There were a lot of things in this movie that didn't make sense to me. Like the whole deal on Constantine getting fired. I didn't understand why the black daughter wouldn't just go around the back. Surely the white lady had entertained visitors before, hadn't she? And even if she hadn't, what's the big deal about being asked to go around back? And then when she does come in the front anyway, why is everyone so upset about it? It is viewed by the guests as an act of defiance, worthy of firing the black lady. To me, it just looks like a simple misunderstanding that the white lady would have easily explained and shrugged off. I'm supposed to believe that most white people back then were so racist that they never had any common sense at all? I don't know about that. The Constantine firing seems forced to me.And then later, we are told that Constantine has died, and Skeeter just takes it. Hello? She still has a daughter, people! A family! Maybe you could try to visit? Maybe even apologize? Nah, that's too much trouble.The movie has a lot of sentimental feel-goodisms that I didn't really care for. Like the cancerous mother who - inspired by her daughter - ""decides to live"" and suddenly becomes her own champion for social justice. Or Evil Hilly, who gets forced to eat it. Oh, and she also gets a cold sore at one point. Because that's what happens to EVIL people - cold sores!The worst part is when it takes sentimentalism and combines it with a lack of logic in order to create a result that makes you feel good - until you wonder what you are cheering about. A good example is when the maid steals a ring and tries to pawn it. We're supposed to feel sorry for her later when the evil redneck cops arrest her. Why? Because Hilly is EVIL, so to heck with her. And the woman really, REALLY needs the money. It's for the children. Also, she just ""found"" the ring, she it's not really stealing. Um, no.Yes, I know she stole out of desperation for her kids. And if Hilly had been caring enough or not-racist enough, she would have loaned her the $75 she needed. But wait a minute! We're supposed to hate Hilly because she won't loan the lady $75? That makes her racist? Hello, people! That's a lot of money for back then! Personally, I wouldn't even loan that much money to my brother today, let alone back then. Racism's got nothing to do with it.One of the odd things about this movie is the very premise of it. A white woman is trying to ""help"" black women by telling their side of the story. But the only thing she ends up ""helping"" is getting herself a nice a job and getting the main black maid fired (along with countless others, probably). So by helping these women, she is actually exploiting them. Am I missing something? Or am I just blind? Why are other people seeing a virtue here where I'm not?Let's face it. A book like The Help would never have been published, let alone become a hit. What white woman back then would have been interested in buying a book showing a black person's side of the story? The fact that the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation still existed shows that the vast majority of whites weren't too interested in what black people thought about anything.Another thing that irked me was how Abilene was fired at the end after Skeeter abandoned her, but we are supposed to be okay with that because Abilene says she's going to become a writer. (Again with the ""Writer"" Heroines... Sheesh!) I didn't expect a happy ending. But become a writer? Yeah, right.There's another thing worth mentioning. Many have taken to writing glowing reviews of the incredible acting of Viola Davis in this movie. That's much ado about nothing to me. She was okay. Not bad acting, but nothing outstanding either. I think people who do this are mostly white people who are trying to overcompensate and prove they don't have any internal racism by giving big props to a black actress. I mean, the woman is certainly talented and competent, but no more than anyone else in the movie.I will say this. My 1 star review is not fair. The movie deserves more than that. But my review won't get read if I give it a higher rating, so from my self-centered viewpoint, 1 star it is. There are plenty of 5-star ratings already, so it's not like my rating is going to make a difference.One thing I liked was seeing a few scenes from Clarksdale, Mississippi in this movie. Having been to Clarksdale many times, I thought this part was really cool.Back to the story. The main problem I have upon watching this is I don't know what to believe. The world has changed so much from the Jim Crow era that I'm unwilling to accept the history of it wrapped in a saccharine-sweet feel-good movie. I would like to see a movie depicting the real struggles that took place, without a bunch of sentimental fluff. I want the harsh truth. Not a sugar-coated feel-good summer chick flick. Guess I'll keep looking.I want to see the world the way it really was, if possible. Where blacks pulled themselves out of the hole through a lot of grit and determination, not the storybook movie lie where long-suffering blacks are finally ""saved"" by kindly, progressive white people. At least this movie made me think about that, and want to read more of the actual history. So that's something.",1,"Yeah, I gave it 1 Star - So let the angry comments begin!",1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,8953,"['***', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', '***I', 'watched', 'movie', 'what', 'worth',

1391971,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004A8ZWVK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie is set in Jackson, Mississippi. The upper crust society employs black people in a way that is not far from slavery. The racial attitudes were such that it made me tearful and sad. Emma Stone plays the overly hip daughter, Skeeter, who has come home from her 4 years at Old Miss. She was taken a job as a journalist with the Jackson newspaper. She is ahead of her time as she doesn't share many of the racial views, or typical roles women must play. Her job at the paper requires her to take over a column on giving household hints, something she knows nothing about and must go to ""the help"" for advice. She is also stirred by the fact the family fired Constance(Cicely Tyson), the ""woman who raised her.""Skeeter aspires to be a book writer. She decides to write a book from the view of the maids who raise white children and aren't allowed to use the same restrooms in the house (black people carry different diseases than white people). The only problem with the idea is that no maid wants to tell on their boss for fear of getting fired, or having their house burn down. It was also illegal in Mississippi for Skeeter to write such a book.After a few incidents and a rousing sermon about courage, Aibileen, played magnificently by Viola Davis, breaks down and consents to tell her story followed by Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). Skeeter also hangs out with her white friends led by Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) who has written a bill for the state attorney's general requiring families that hire black people be required to have a separate restroom for them. (There is nothing worse than going over to a white person's help knowing the maid uses the guest toilet.) Eventually the maids tell their stories, some nice, some not so nice.Skeeter's mom is concerned that her daughter isn't married or has a boyfriend and sets her up at every opportunity.The movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride. One second you are laughing, the next sad. You go from angry to joyful. It was superbly acted and directed and will certainly get some kind of Oscar. It is that good.

1391974,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B004A8ZWVK,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[0, 0]","This movie explores an aspect of the civil rights movement that I never registered: the plight of poor black housekeepers.  Not a thrilling premise, but stay with me.  It was an entertaining picture.The real value in The Help is not in its ""message"" or uplifting resolution.  It is the humor.  There are some good one-liners and carefully set-up punchlines that deliver mild, but reliable laughs.  The African American maids in the film have great personality and timing, and in some ways their body language and delivery make you feel for their struggle to find the humor in their awful lives.  And the spoiled-rotten stay-at-home white broads that take full advantage of their servants are such wild exaggerations of Southern belle busybodies that you have to laugh at the parody.  The humor it cutesy and simple, but I'll take well-placed and playful jokes over gross-out bodily fluid gags seven days of the week.A clever social hierarchy study goes on.  The movie reveals the behind the scenes perspective that ""the help"" in any institution, be it a church, law firm, place of higher learning, bank, or whatever, gets to experience firsthand.  The maids swap rumors and stories about the real and imperfect lives of their employers and gossip over all the dirty secrets.  Blending into the wallpaper as a  go-fer has simpleton entertainment perks.  This is one lesson of The Help, but as the servant you always have to keep your lips sealed and avoid the temptation to talk back.  Or to grab revenge, at least not until the time is right.  There is some sweet revenge in this movie, but I won't give it away.  All I can say is that anyone who has worked in the service industry will appreciate pulling a big one over on a rude and ungrateful customer, or, in this case, a snotty and unbearable employer.Another thought that occurred to me is how African American women went from being indentured servants in the mid-19th Century to being ""free"" but still less-thans in the mid-20th Century.  These women were not independent. They were highly dependent upon their ""masters,"" the wealthy, cozy, elitist Southern whites.  (The practice of leaving a servant to a descendant in one's will that is discussed in the movie is further evidence for how little the possessive and entitled mindset of the white ruling class had changed.)  I am sure the maids were paid a virtual pittance, although we never find out exactly.

The characters Stockett creates were so alive and so true to the era that I was convinced Hollywood would interfere or meddle with the world that Stockett creates, but the movie instead hews quite faithfully to the book, retaining all of its resonance and emotional punch.  That's truly a rarity in movie adaptations and what gives ""The Help"" its punch is the stellar ensemble cast as much as the taut screenplay.  The plot should be fairly well known by now; an aspiring author (Skeeter Phelan, played pluckily by Emma Stone) determines to chronicle life from the perspective of American-American maids in the Kennedy-era Jim Crow South.  The maids (led by Abileen Clark, played to stoic perfection by Viola Davis) are understandably skeptical of this interloper and the potential danger cooperating with her endeavor brings. As the movie unfolds it gives viewers a sense of the tensions of that era as Jim Crow was slowly being beaten down and the nascent Civil Rights movement was taking form. Usually filmmakers' approaches to this era aren't well done, lacking in nuance and depth but that isn't the case here as ""The Help"" accurately captures the dynamics in both the black and white communities and between the two in a fundamentally honest and accurate way. And while there is understandable tension in the movie it is leavened by the performances of Alison Janey (as Skeeter's mother) and Octavia Spencer (in an Oscar worthy role as the outspoken, scene stealing Minny Jackson).There are obvious concerns about a movie touching on this era devolving into minstrelry or perpetuating tired stereotypes and thankfully ""The Help"" avoids those traps. Some may worry that it plays into the trope that only white people could ""save"" African-Americans in this era, but the truth is both were working together to the same goal and ""The Help"", likeThe Long Walk Homeand wonderful PBS series ""I'll Fly Away"" hint at that.  Indeed, ""The Help"" follows in the same vein as both of those and the truly phenomenalEyes on The Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954-1965series.  More than anything I came away touched by the bravery and courage that each individual must have possessed during that era if they believed in social justice and racial equality.  It was not an easy path to take, and looking at those who opposed it now one can only laugh at how narrow minded they were.  But it was no laughing matter at the time.  No one then could have known the outcome and many lives and careers were destroyed for being outspoken on either side.  Ultimately ""The Help"" is a glimpse into our nation's soul, where we were as a people, and how far we've come.  That is ultimately validating and life affirming that we are on the path to becoming a better people and a better nation.",5,Captures the era in a profoundly moving way,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,2960,"['Having', 'read', 'Kathryn', ""Stockett'sThe"", 'Help', 'Deluxe', 'Editionfirst', 'was', 'concerned', 'had', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'movie', 'could', 'how', 'vivid', 'book', 'had', 'become', 'reading', 'characters', 'Stockett', 'creates', 'were', 'so', 'alive', 'so', 'true', 'era', 'was', 'convinced', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'interfere', 'meddle', 'world', 'Stockett', 'movie', 'instead', 'quite', 'faithfully', 'book', 'retaining', 'resonance', 'emotional', 'punch', 'truly', 'rarity', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'what', 'Help', 'punch', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'as', 'much', 'taut', 'screenplay', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'now', 'aspiring', 'author', 'Skeeter', 'Phelan', 'played', 'pluckily', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'chronicle', 'life', 'perspective', 'American-American', 'maids', 'Kennedy-era', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'maids', 'led', 'Abileen', 'Clark', 'played', 'stoic', 'perfection', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'are', 'understandably', 'skeptical', 'interloper', 'potential', 'danger', 'cooperating', 'endeavor', 'movie', 'viewers', 'sense', 'tensions', 'era', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'was', 'slowly', 'being', 'beaten', 'down', 'nascent', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'was', 'taking', 'form', 'Usually', 'filmmakers', 'approaches', 'era', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'done', 'lacking', 'nuance', 'depth', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'Help', 'accurately', 'dynamics', 'black', 'white', 'communities', 'two', 'fundamentally', 'honest', 'accurate', 'way', 'understandable', 'tension', 'movie', 'leavened', 'performances', 'Alison', 'Janey', 'Skeeter', 'mother', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'role', 'outspoken', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Minny', 'Jackson', 'are', 'obvious', 'concerns', 'movie', 'touching', 'era', 'devolving', 'minstrelry', 'perpetuating', 'tired', 'stereotypes', 'thankfully', 'Help', 'avoids', 'traps', 'may', 'worry', 'trope', 'only', 'white', 'people', 'could', 'save', 'African-Americans', 'era', 'truth', 'were', 'working', 'together', 'same', 'goal', 'Help', 'likeThe', 'Long', 'Walk', 'Homeand', 'wonderful', 'PBS', 'series', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'hint', 'Indeed', 'Help', 'same', 'vein', 'truly', 'phenomenalEyes', 'Prize', 'America', 'Civil', 'Rights', '1954-1965series', 'More', 'anything', 'came', 'away', 'touched', 'bravery', 'courage', 'individual', 'must', 'have', 'possessed', 'era', 'believed', 'social', 'justice', 'racial', 'equality', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'path', 'take', 'looking', 'who', 'opposed', 'now', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'laugh', 'how', 'narrow', 'minded', 'were', 'was', 'laughing', 'matter', 'time', 'one', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'outcome', 'many', 'lives', 'careers', 'were', 'destroyed', 'being', 'outspoken', 'side', 'Ultimately', 'Help', 'glimpse', 'nation', 'soul', 'where', 'were', 'people', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'ultimately', 'validating', 'life', 'affirming', 'are', 'path', 'becoming', 'better', 'people', 'better', 'nation']",N/A

1391988,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004A8ZWVK,Turfseer,"[54, 153]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.  Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.  Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, ""feel-good"" character of Skeeter. No book like ""The Help"" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would ""The Help"" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits!While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually--they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenes since there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if ""The Help"" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive--do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's ""abusive"" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him?For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.",1,"Anachronistic,

Then I saw archival footage from the direst events of the period depicting rabid women screaming for violence against blacks.The truth is that none of the horrors that occurred in this country's long, slow, agonizing (and ongoing) climb out of the cesspool of race hatred could have occurred without the encouragement of white women, the group most threatened by the impending loss of undeserved privilege. White men may have been the boot on the necks of blacks, but white women were wearing that boot.The film fails to explore the awful metamorphosis of women who were lovingly raised by blacks, and who then entrusted their own children to the care of blacks, into virulent bigots.

Not the kind of anticipation you would get from a Harry Potter or Star Wars film. Every now and again a film about a real point in time that caused a major change in history is released and since the new millennium none were priased as `The Help'This is a film based on a fantastic book about women growing up in the deep south in the early 1960s and the African American women that helped them in their everyday lives. Yet, in this time there was only a select few that knew that times were changing. In this film that person was enveloped in a girl named Skeeter, who knew there was an important story to tell that these Black women were afraid to tell, but had no idea what it would do to two races of people.I was fortunate to read this novel and I have to say that this was an incredible film adaption. The ensemble cast was amazing and the story is so heartwarming and uplifting. While this film does revolve around females it is by no means a `chick flick'. It is a story about hope and learning to step up and take a chance for what you believe in. Even if you have no idea what the consequences will be. `The Help is a great film that tells the story about a time in American history that is not really touched upon in such depth and this movie really brings out the humanity in the time and it is a true classic.",5,An important must see film.,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1378,"['Rarely', 'film', 'get', 'released', 'such', 'anticipation', 'Not', 'kind', 'anticipation', 'would', 'get', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'now', 'again', 'film', 'real', 'point', 'time', 'caused', 'major', 'change', 'history', 'released', 'new', 'millennium', 'none', 'were', 'priased', ""Help'This"", 'film', 'based', 'fantastic', 'book', 'women', 'growing', 'up', 'deep', 'south', 'early', '1960s', 'African', 'American', 'women', 'helped', 'everyday', 'lives', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'knew', 'times', 'were', 'changing', 'film', 'person', 'was', 'enveloped', 'girl', 'named', 'Skeeter', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'important', 'story', 'tell', 'Black', 'women', 'were', 'afraid', 'tell', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'two', 'races', 'people.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'read', 'novel', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'adaption', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'amazing', 'story', 'so', 'heartwarming', 'uplifting', 'film', 'revolve', 'females', 'chick', 'flick', 'story', 'hope', 'learning', 'step', 'up', 'take', 'chance', 'what', 'believe', 'Even', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'consequences', 'will', 'be', 'Help', 'great', 'film', 'story', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'not', 'really', 'touched', 'such', 'depth', 'movie', 'really', 'out', 'humanity', 'time', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

Hughes ""VC Hughes""","[0, 0]","I normally limit my reviews to German History and Stem Cells but this story was so good I was compelled to write a review. The setting is early 1960s Jackson, MS and one of the main characters, ""Skeeter"" played by Emma Stone has just landed a job as a domestic writer for a local newspaper. Her world is composed of  southern social gatherings of girl friends (who are all married with children), her ailing mother (Allison Janney), and the ""help"" whose main characters are played by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, with a special appearance by Cicely Tyson...they are superb. Skeeter is consumed with the absence of Constantine, the maid she grew up with and who served as a second mother to her, played by Tyson. Skeeter has a warm spot for all maids and has empathy for their place in the social order of the time. Her ambition and past compels her to write a book about the maids experience and feelings about their white employers and scant existence. Though there is resistance at first, she reaches her quota of twelve maids' stories when a maid is arrested for stealing a piece of jewelry from her employers home.In the midst of writing the book, a literary insurance policy is injected into the manuscript involving Octavia Spencer's character (Minnie). Upon being fired for using the house cammode she responds by making a chocolate pie with a special ingredient and presents it to her employer with an apology. This story is injected into the book as amunition against the employer if they ever found out who wrote and contributed to the book. Minnie lands another job at a plantation owner whose wife is afflicted with miscarriages and an outcast in the Jackson social circle. Minnie graciously and hilariously teaches her how to cook and deal with the white socialites in town. If the audience thought the movie would end upon the book being published, they were thankfully wrong. While Skeeter's name was not anywhere in the book, nor were the real names of the maids, the stories were too close to home not to be found out from non other than the pie eating white socialite who wrote legislation for maids to have separate (but equal) commodes. Words were passed and threats were made but ultimately what transpired between Minnie and Hilde would remain anonymous fulfilling the purpose of the insurance policy of the book. Skeeter's mother reveals to her what actually happened to Constantine and praises her for having the courage she did not posess, a trait that has touched so many then...and now. Sissy Spacek, who played Hilde's mother also gives an oscar worthy performance. This film is funny, moving, and compared to many other films involving race issues, it is soft enough to be watched again and again without losing the take home message of the film. Which is black maids in the deep south genuinely cared for and loved the white children they shared time with, they knew their boundaries to their white counterparts in society, and lived the life their mother's had known. The love between the white children and black maids is undeniable...as love is color-blind. The director, author, producers, and actors have done what so many race centered movies fail to do...enable people to walk out of the theatre feeling good.

1392009,AP3B615GM191G,B004A8ZWVK,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Despite ""The Help"" being nominated for many Academy Awards, it took me a long time to pop it into my Blu-Ray player.  Why?  Because I was worried that the racial message would be too preachy or political, and I cannot stand those types of films.  When I finally did view the picture, however, I was pleasantly surprised by its straightforward nature.For a basic plot summary, this story takes place in the 1960s deep South (Jackson, Mississippi, to be exact), where Southern Belles like Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) hire black maids to do their housework and raise their children.  The maids are treated with little respect and given no rights whatsoever.  When young Skeeter (Emma Stone), an aspiring journalist, comes home to Jackson after graduating college, she begins to see how wrongly the maids are being treated.  In secret, she begins collaborating with Aibileen (Viola Davis) & Minnie (Octavia Spencer) to write a book espousing ""their side of the story"".There are two primary reasons why this movie is so gripping and enjoyable:First, of course, is the heartfelt story.  I honestly do not know how close to reality the stories fall, but even if a sliver of them are true it is still a story that needs to be told.  Racially-themed films can be a touchy subject, but ""The Help"" doesn't get too preachy or overly political.  Instead, it focuses squarely on the players at hand, the right move for this type of film.Secondly, this is a period piece almost unlike any other.  Thanks to the incredible acting and period music/clothing/sets, you will feel transported into that time period for the duration of viewing.  Combine the racial aspects of Denzel Washington's ""The Great Debaters"" with the Southern feel of ""Walk The Line"" and one would be close to describing the overall ambiance of ""The Help"".On a quick note, I don't quite understand why Emma Stone was not given more ""Academy love"" for her performance.  Though the two primary maids (Spencer & Davis) are spot-on as well, it truly is Stone who carries the movie along.  She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today and her performance alone in ""The Help"" is reason enough to give it a try.Thus, I really don't have too much bad to say about ""The Help"".  It made me think, transported me to another era, and got me emotionally invested in the characters.  With the possible grey area of being ""based on true events"", what more can a film accomplish?",5,"Watch First, Judge Later",1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2432,"['Help', 'being', 'nominated', 'many', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'pop', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'Why', 'was', 'worried', 'racial', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'preachy', 'political', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'types', 'films', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'view', 'picture', 'however', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'straightforward', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'story', 'place', '1960s', 'deep', 'South', 'Jackson', 'Mississippi', 'be', 'exact', 'where', 'Southern', 'Belles', 'Hilly', 'Holbrook', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'hire', 'black', 'maids', 'do', 'housework', 'raise', 'children', 'maids', 'are', 'treated', 'little', 'respect', 'given', 'rights', 'whatsoever', 'When', 'young', 'Skeeter', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'home', 'Jackson', 'graduating', 'college', 'see', 'how', 'wrongly', 'maids', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'secret', 'collaborating', 'Aibileen', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Minnie', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'write', 'book', 'espousing', 'side', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'gripping', 'enjoyable', 'First', 'course', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'close', 'reality', 'stories', 'fall', 'even', 'sliver', 'are', 'true', 'still', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'Racially-themed', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'touchy', 'subject', 'Help', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'preachy', 'overly', 'political', 'Instead', 'squarely', 'players', 'hand', 'right', 'move', 'type', 'film.Secondly', 'period', 'piece', 'almost', 'other', 'Thanks', 'incredible', 'acting', 'period', 'music/clothing/sets', 'will', 'feel', 'transported', 'time', 'period', 'duration', 'viewing', 'Combine', 'racial', 'aspects', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'Southern', 'feel', 'Walk', 'Line', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'close', 'describing', 'overall', 'ambiance', 'Help', '.On', 'quick', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'more', 'Academy', 'love', 'performance', 'two', 'primary', 'maids', 'Spencer', 'Davis', 'are', 'spot-on', 'well', 'truly', 'Stone', 'who', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'performance', 'alone', 'Help', 'reason', 'enough', 'give', 'try.Thus', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'bad', 'say', 'Help', 'made', 'think', 'transported', 'era', 'got', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'possible', 'grey', 'area', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'film', 'accomplish']",N/A
1392010,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B004A8ZWVK,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","Surely it's bad form to extensively quote another reviewer in one's own review (especially right at the start), but having stumbled upon the perfect quote, it's hard to resist. It's with that recognition and understanding that I quote the introduction to David Denby's review of ""The Help"" from August's issue of The New Yorker:""'The Help,' based on Kathryn Stockett's best-selling 2009 novel, is, in some ways, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on.""As Denby says, this isn't a necessarily unpredictable movie. I would add that there's plenty that this movie glosses over regarding race relations in 1960s Mississippi, but this is a Disney film meant for mass-consumption and a kind of salve on white guilt - along those lines, is it any surprise that the only church scenes we see are uplifting ones in the black churches, rather than the massively racist rants of white preachers at the time? For the reality of the situation, though, the curious should head to the classroom or to important novels of the time, such as John Howard Griffin's impactful ""Black Like Me"". That being said, this film, written and directed by relative newcomer Tate Taylor, offers an important primer on the importance of respect and equality, even in the face of adversity.Emma Stone, nominated for a Golden Globe for last year's flip ""Easy A"" earns her status as a leading lady here, capturing the humor, strength and tenacity of Skeeter, a would-be journalist in a tumultuous time. The rest of the cast is equally strong, with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer providing the emotional gravitas to buoy the story. Davis provides solid and grounded depth while Spencer mixes her performance up providing some much-needed comic relief. Bryce Dallas Howard works exceptionally well as a holier-than-thou white supremacist - all smiles and ""love"" while working to disenfranchise those around her. Jessica Chastain shows a surprising comic side as a ditzy blonde and Allison Janney continues her streak of  powerful supporting characters. All said, this is an undeniably strong all-female cast and it's exciting that a film like this performed so well at the box office.The story itself centers around Skeeter (Stone) on her return to Jackson after completing a degree in journalism. Deciding that she wants to make a difference with her writing she sets out to record the stories of the local maids in the area - what it's like for them to make a living raising white children while their own children sit at home, perhaps under the care of someone else. There's a lot of discussion of the risk these women face exposing their employers to a journalist, and not much payoff in that area, but luckily that's not the only story here. With the aforementioned supporting cast in tow, Skeeter covers much more emotional and political ground over the course of the movie.Overall, ""The Help"" does simplify things a bit, creating some caricatures and predictable situations, but Taylor was lucky enough to have a dynamite cast on his hand that handles even the cheesiest of dialogue with a deft hand. Towards the end, each and every scene turns into a tearjerker, and this somehow manages to be a welcome and appreciated dramatic turn. The Help may not be the deepest movie of the year, but it offers important lessons and stories for our own time. As Oscar season approaches, here's hoping that the powerful acting in this film won't be overlooked.",4,Incredibly well-acted and emotional movie,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,3590,"['Surely', 'bad', 'form', 'extensively', 'quote', 'reviewer', 'one', 'own', 'review', 'especially', 'right', 'start', 'having', 'stumbled', 'perfect', 'quote', 'hard', 'resist', 'recognition', 'understanding', 'quote', 'introduction', 'David', 'Denby', 'review', 'Help', 'August', 'issue', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Help', 'based', 'Kathryn', 'Stockett', 'best-selling', '2009', 'novel', 'ways', 'crude', 'obvious', 'up', 'broad', 'new', 'swath', 'experience', 'screen', 'parts', 'are', 'so', 'moving', 'well', 'acted', 'objections', 'what', 'second-rate', 'seem', 'matter', 'less', 'movie', 'Denby', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'would', 'add', 'plenty', 'movie', 'regarding', 'race', 'relations', '1960s', 'Mississippi', 'Disney', 'film', 'meant', 'mass-consumption', 'kind', 'salve', 'white', 'guilt', 'lines', 'surprise', 'only', 'church', 'see', 'are', 'uplifting', 'ones', 'black', 'churches', 'rather', 'massively', 'racist', 'rants', 'white', 'preachers', 'time', 'reality', 'situation', 'though', 'curious', 'should', 'head', 'classroom', 'important', 'novels', 'time', 'such', 'John', 'Howard', 'Griffin', 'impactful', 'Black', 'Me', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Tate', 'Taylor', 'important', 'primer', 'importance', 'respect', 'equality', 'even', 'face', 'adversity.Emma', 'Stone', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'last', 'year', 'flip', 'Easy', 'A', 'status', 'leading', 'lady', 'here', 'capturing', 'humor', 'strength', 'tenacity', 'Skeeter', 'would-be', 'journalist', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'strong', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'providing', 'emotional', 'gravitas', 'buoy', 'story', 'Davis', 'solid', 'grounded', 'depth', 'Spencer', 'mixes', 'performance', 'up', 'providing', 'much-needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'holier-than-thou', 'white', 'supremacist', 'smiles', 'love', 'working', 'disenfranchise', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'surprising', 'comic', 'side', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'streak', 'powerful', 'supporting', 'characters', 'said', 'undeniably', 'strong', 'all-female', 'cast', 'exciting', 'film', 'performed', 'so', 'well', 'box', 'office.The', 'story', 'around', 'Skeeter', 'Stone', 'return', 'Jackson', 'completing', 'degree', 'journalism', 'Deciding', 'make', 'difference', 'writing', 'out', 'record', 'stories', 'local', 'maids', 'area', 'what', 'make', 'living', 'raising', 'white', 'children', 'own', 'children', 'sit', 'home', 'perhaps', 'care', 'someone', 'else', 'lot', 'discussion', 'risk', 'women', 'face', 'exposing', 'employers', 'journalist', 'not', 'much', 'payoff', 'area', 'luckily', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'here', 'aforementioned', 'supporting', 'cast', 'tow', 'Skeeter', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'political', 'ground', 'course', 'movie.Overall', 'Help', 'simplify', 'things', 'bit', 'creating', 'caricatures', 'predictable', 'situations', 'Taylor', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'dynamite', 'cast', 'hand', 'even', 'cheesiest', 'dialogue', 'deft', 'hand', 'end', 'scene', 'tearjerker', 'somehow', 'be', 'welcome', 'appreciated', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'Help', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'deepest', 'movie', 'year', 'important', 'lessons', 'stories', 'own', 'time', 'Oscar', 'season', 'approaches', 'here', 'hoping', 'powerful', 'acting', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'overlooked']",N/A
