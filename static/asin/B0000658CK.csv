699509,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0000658CK,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[16, 17]","Our daughter loves the ""Angelina Ballerina"" books by Katherine Holbird and Helen Craig, and when we decided to start letting her watch TV, this was one of the first titles I thought would be good for her to watch... Unfortunately, the cartoons are *very* different from the books, in an entirely negative way.Most alarming of all is how whiny, self-centered and deceitful Angelina is -- almost every episode involves her telling a fib and then having to make up for it.  This is horrible role modeling for younger children, particularly since she KEEPS LYING from episode to episode -- there's no character growth, just Angelina being dishonest over and over again, until she gets caught or her conscience catches up with her.  I'm also not fond of the ultra-competitiveness shown between Angelina and the other characters.  In the books, Angelina always gets the lead role, but she is considerate of others, and shares the spotlight genrously.  By contrast, these cartoons show a never-ending series of backstabbing and manipulation... The supporting characters, including Angelina's friends, are made more flawed and unlikable than they are in the books.  Alice, for example, is transformed from a perfectly nice little girl into a clumsy, fat, self-pitying hanger-on who is embarassed and envious of Angelina's success.  The Pinkpaw twins are new characters who seem to have been invented just to be bad guys -- they try to undercut Angelina at every turn -- and Angelina herself is far less likeable here than in the original books.  Frankly, I'm amazed that the book's author, Ms. Holabird, allowed such terrible, distorted versions of her stories to be produced.The books are magical, but the TV shows left a bad taste in our mouths.  They are not on our ""safe to watch"" list anymore.  Parents who were charmed by the books might want to preview these cartoons first, before letting your kid soak them up... It would be a shame to let them ruin the books for your mouse-loving little ones.",2,"If you like the books, you might want to avoid the cartoons",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1995,"['daughter', 'Angelina', 'Ballerina', 'books', 'Katherine', 'Holbird', 'Helen', 'Craig', 'when', 'decided', 'start', 'letting', 'watch', 'TV', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'titles', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'cartoons', 'are', '*very*', 'different', 'books', 'entirely', 'negative', 'way.Most', 'alarming', 'how', 'whiny', 'self-centered', 'deceitful', 'Angelina', 'almost', 'episode', 'telling', 'fib', 'then', 'having', 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'role', 'modeling', 'younger', 'children', 'particularly', 'KEEPS', 'LYING', 'episode', 'episode', 'character', 'growth', 'just', 'Angelina', 'being', 'dishonest', 'over', 'again', 'caught', 'conscience', 'up', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fond', 'ultra-competitiveness', 'shown', 'Angelina', 'other', 'characters', 'books', 'Angelina', 'always', 'lead', 'role', 'considerate', 'others', 'shares', 'spotlight', 'genrously', 'contrast', 'cartoons', 'show', 'never-ending', 'series', 'backstabbing', 'manipulation', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'Angelina', 'friends', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'flawed', 'unlikable', 'are', 'books', 'Alice', 'example', 'transformed', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'little', 'girl', 'clumsy', 'fat', 'self-pitying', 'hanger-on', 'who', 'embarassed', 'envious', 'Angelina', 'success', 'Pinkpaw', 'twins', 'are', 'new', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'invented', 'just', 'be', 'bad', 'guys', 'try', 'undercut', 'Angelina', 'turn', 'Angelina', 'far', 'less', 'likeable', 'here', 'original', 'books', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'book', 'author', 'Ms.', 'Holabird', 'allowed', 'such', 'terrible', 'distorted', 'versions', 'stories', 'be', 'produced.The', 'books', 'are', 'magical', 'TV', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'watch', 'list', 'anymore', 'Parents', 'who', 'were', 'charmed', 'books', 'might', 'want', 'preview', 'cartoons', 'first', 'letting', 'kid', 'soak', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'let', 'ruin', 'books', 'mouse-loving', 'little', 'ones']",N/A

The main character bullies and then abandons her little cousin Henry because she doesn't want to look after him, and the poor kid is sobbing as he wanders the haunted house, where adults notice but do nothing.  She refuses to buy him a blue balloon even after denying him the merry go round because she only has enough money for one thing, and she wants cotton candy (""candyfloss""). Yes, I am aware this is a cartoon, but I was teared up over it and just about sobbing when Angelina says she hates him.My almost 4 year old daughter, however, loves anything with Angelina and didn't notice either the distressing situation or my distress.

699513,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0000658CK,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Yes, I have to agree with other reviewers that the DVD set-up is annoying. It doesn't allow viewers to pick the episode they want to watch, or skip the commercials. But, we haven't any other choice, and hopefully future releases of the show will take customers views into consideration.As for the show itself, this DVD contains 4 episodes:In the first, Angelina learns to overcome her fear, in the second Angelina is forced to take her young cousin Henry to the fair and behaves in a beastly manner towards him until she loses him and then learns a valuable lesson, i.e. to be considerate of others' feelings. In the third episode, Angelina manages to get scarce tickets to a famous show, and in the last episode,Angelina's friend is blamed for something Angelina did, and Angelina learns the value of taking responsibility for one's actions.The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",4,"Despite annoying DVD set-up, the stories are still captivating",1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,1463,"['Yes', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'set-up', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'allow', 'viewers', 'pick', 'episode', 'want', 'watch', 'skip', 'commercials', 'have', ""n't"", 'other', 'choice', 'hopefully', 'future', 'releases', 'show', 'will', 'take', 'customers', 'views', 'consideration.As', 'show', 'DVD', '4', 'episodes', 'first', 'Angelina', 'overcome', 'fear', 'second', 'Angelina', 'forced', 'take', 'young', 'cousin', 'Henry', 'fair', 'beastly', 'manner', 'towards', 'then', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'i.e', 'be', 'considerate', 'others', 'feelings', 'third', 'episode', 'Angelina', 'get', 'scarce', 'tickets', 'famous', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'Angelina', 'friend', 'blamed', 'something', 'Angelina', 'did', 'Angelina', 'value', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'one', 'actions.The', 'animated', 'stories', 'remain', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'Katharine', 'Holabird', 'retain', 'original', 'illustrations', 'Helen', 'Craig', 'quality', 'animation', 'above', 'average', 'lending', 'almost', 'real-life', 'quality', 'little', 'mice', 'language', 'clear', '[', 'British', 'accent', 'used', 'here', ']', 'animated', 'episodes', 'are', 'scenes', 'actual', 'dance', 'lessons', 'ballet', 'folk', 'others.I', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'Angelina', 'Ballerina', 'series', 'DVDs', 'aspiring', 'young', 'dancers', 'who', 'love', 'immersing', 'world', 'inhabited', 'adorable', 'little', 'mice', 'probably', 'suited', 'preschoolers', 'up']",N/A
