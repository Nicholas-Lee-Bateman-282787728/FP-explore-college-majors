I got the same cast but I did not get the same enjoyment. This one was not worth much.The story is of the furthering encroachment by the English and the Boers into the Zulu kingdom. Shaka is not a king to be trifled with and is in many way ""primitive"" but that does not keep him from sophisticated thinking as well. He is portrayed as a great leader of his people who can be violent but who is also willing and indeed eager to learn new things. So much they got right.A great part of this story tells of Shaka being betrayed and captured by slavers. He vows vengeance but tempers that vengeance because of the example of an Englishwoman who shows him kindness. This part of the story is very simplistic and is dramatically flat. So too is most of the rest of the story. The one good acting job in this sequel is that of the title role. He tries to portray the complexity of the character. The rest are one dimensional.",2,A Disappointment,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,1042,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'miniseries', 'featured', 'same', 'cast', 'reason', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'same', 'got', 'same', 'cast', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'same', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'much.The', 'story', 'furthering', 'encroachment', 'English', 'Boers', 'Zulu', 'kingdom', 'Shaka', 'not', 'king', 'be', 'trifled', 'many', 'way', 'primitive', 'not', 'keep', 'sophisticated', 'thinking', 'as', 'well', 'portrayed', 'great', 'leader', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'violent', 'who', 'also', 'willing', 'indeed', 'eager', 'learn', 'new', 'things', 'So', 'much', 'got', 'right.A', 'great', 'part', 'story', 'tells', 'Shaka', 'being', 'betrayed', 'captured', 'slavers', 'vengeance', 'tempers', 'vengeance', 'example', 'Englishwoman', 'who', 'kindness', 'part', 'story', 'very', 'simplistic', 'dramatically', 'flat', 'So', 'too', 'most', 'rest', 'story', 'one', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'sequel', 'title', 'role', 'portray', 'complexity', 'character', 'rest', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional']",Shaka Zulu - Last Great Warrior
886295,A3LQ06WS0PMWSQ,B0007PALUC,"Khyraen ""Superintendent, Barlow Christian Aca...","[1, 5]","I am rating this movie as a stand alone movie.  I had not even heard of the mini-series until after renting this movie.  So, my review is based solely on this movie and how it rates on it's own accord.I enjoyed this movie.  The love interest between the ship's captain and his lady passenger was an irritating distraction, but besides that, the movie progressed very nicely.  There wasn't a moment when I was sitting around, bored, waiting for the story line to pick itself out of a rut and move on.I found the characters, for the most part, interesting.  I think, again, that the development of the characters involved in the romance was stunted by the romance and the unbelievable influence it had on them, but the rest of the characters were well developed and believable.They were not stereo-types, but complex people with tough decisions to make under sometimes terrible circumstances.  The humiliation of the Zulu king was very real and believable, and you felt sympathy for both sides, the settlers and the Africans, in the final conflict.I enjoyed entertaining the questions put forward by this movie.  Such questions as: When is it not weakness to forgive a wrong and forgo vengeance?  How far does the blame of slavery really reach?  If Europeans didn't settle other lands with the intentions of intermingling with the locals and treating them as equals, then what were they really planning?  How responsible are they for some of the horrific events that have followed the settlements?The theme of the story, suffering and forgiveness, was excellently done.  You weren't certain how everything would end, or perhaps even how you wanted it to end.Overall, this movie makes you think--think about important issues.  I am shocked by all the negative reviews; this movie is worth watching.",4,Why All the Negative Reviews?

Although I didn't think it was as terrible as some of the other reviews state, it was pretty bad overall.  The story has a lot of holes and nonsensical moments.  The overall character development is weak.  I never felt as though I really knew a single character in the film.  There was no major villian, although there were certainly some bad guys (slave traders).  I'm really not sure what the point of the film was.The best part of the film took place on the slave ship.  That one part of this film really drew me in and made me shudder.  Those scenes helped remind me of how horrible a crime slavery actually was, and how we how lucky we are today.  Then, those scenes ended with an unintentionally laughable escape sequence.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but the slave ship scenes were enough for me to give it 2 stars.",2,Weak movie with a few bright spots,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,920,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'mini-series', 'am', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'terrible', 'other', 'reviews', 'state', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'overall', 'story', 'lot', 'holes', 'nonsensical', 'moments', 'overall', 'character', 'development', 'weak', 'never', 'felt', 'really', 'knew', 'single', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'villian', 'were', 'certainly', 'bad', 'guys', 'slave', 'traders', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'was.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'slave', 'ship', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'drew', 'made', 'shudder', 'scenes', 'helped', 'remind', 'how', 'horrible', 'crime', 'slavery', 'actually', 'was', 'how', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'today', 'Then', 'scenes', 'ended', 'unintentionally', 'laughable', 'escape', 'sequence.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'slave', 'ship', 'scenes', 'were', 'enough', 'give', '2', 'stars']",Shaka Zulu - Last Great Warrior
886299,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0007PALUC,PJR,"[9, 10]","Knowing nothing about the real Shaka Zulu I enjoyed this film. The photography is beautiful and the characters are interesting and the issues they confront are interesting. It does indeed have some soft spots, however.From the start it seemed obvious that this could not possibly be history, so I just took it as a story, and I think this was the right thing to do and that is why I could enjoy it despite the soft spots and various unbelievable happenings.Then I watched the director's commentary, which is really one of the better ones I have seen.He made it clear that this was not history and was only a sequel to his TV mini-series in the sense that it was made later. It is in fact simply a thought experiment in ""what if"" and was intended to stimulate thinking about race relations and their sad history in Africa and elsewhere in the world. In that sense it was like a lot of science fiction, not intended to be taken seriously in any academic sense, but intended to explore ideas. The director was very passionate about what he was trying to do with this film and his views and this film expression of his views are well worth spending some time with.Folks who are in the market for beautiful and thoughtful films will miss something if they are put off by the comments that the plot is unbelievable and a-historical. Also, try to overlook the soft spots here and there in acting. Even the treatment of the slaves on the ship is unrealistically mild compared to depictions in DVDs such as the Middle Passage. But Shaka Zula makes the point well enough.What is real historically is that the practice of slavery was (and is) inhuman, and that it did have multicultural dimensions in Africa.It may also be interesting to keep in mind that in too many parts of the world the laws against slavery are not enforced, and slavery does still exist (easily found with google).",4,A thought experiment,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,1875,"['Knowing', 'nothing', 'real', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'issues', 'confront', 'are', 'interesting', 'indeed', 'have', 'soft', 'spots', 'start', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'history', 'just', 'took', 'story', 'think', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'why', 'could', 'enjoy', 'soft', 'spots', 'various', 'unbelievable', 'happenings.Then', 'watched', 'director', 'commentary', 'really', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'have', 'seen.He', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'not', 'history', 'was', 'only', 'sequel', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'sense', 'was', 'made', 'later', 'fact', 'simply', 'thought', 'experiment', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'stimulate', 'thinking', 'race', 'relations', 'sad', 'history', 'Africa', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'sense', 'was', 'lot', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'academic', 'sense', 'intended', 'explore', 'ideas', 'director', 'was', 'very', 'passionate', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'film', 'views', 'film', 'expression', 'views', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'spending', 'time', 'with.Folks', 'who', 'are', 'market', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'will', 'miss', 'something', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'comments', 'plot', 'unbelievable', 'a-historical', 'Also', 'try', 'overlook', 'soft', 'spots', 'here', 'there', 'acting', 'Even', 'treatment', 'slaves', 'ship', 'unrealistically', 'mild', 'compared', 'depictions', 'DVDs', 'such', 'Middle', 'Passage', 'Shaka', 'Zula', 'point', 'well', 'enough.What', 'real', 'historically', 'practice', 'slavery', 'was', 'inhuman', 'did', 'have', 'multicultural', 'dimensions', 'Africa.It', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'interesting', 'keep', 'mind', 'too', 'many', 'parts', 'world', 'laws', 'slavery', 'are', 'not', 'enforced', 'slavery', 'still', 'exist', 'easily', 'found', 'google']",Shaka Zulu - Last Great Warrior

Whatever merit the original version must have, I confess that I don't know.  I watched this shorter one as stand-alone piece, and as such, the film is barely watchable.This is said to be the sequel to the 1986 Mini-series, but let's forget about it.  All I can say is that Shaka Zulu is played by same actor Henry Cele, who is the only reason to watch this film.  While Shaka Zulu, the mighty king of Africa is talking about the future of the land with Captain Farewell (James Fox, brother to Edward Fox who was in the 1986 version), an English slaver Mungo (wow! it's David Hasselhoff!!) heads for the coast of Africa, with Captain's daughter Kathleen (Karen Allen).These two sets of characters meet in a most incredible, and unconvincing way.  Shaka Zulu is captured and brought to Mungo's ship, on which you see bad things done to the slaves -- including one assaulted girl -- and somehow, well, just somehow, Kathleen falls in love with Mungo.  And ... should I continue?The film is curious mixture of convincing locations (in Morocco) and unconvincing plot.  If the Michael Caine's 'Zulu' was conventional, it knew what it was doing with full of actions.  In here, you don't have many actions, and if we have one, it is marred by the contrived stort.The only thing I find good about the film is Henry Cele's dignified portrait of Shaka Zulu.
