1064155,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B000OHZKYU,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 1]","I'm now watching the 5th season of this show and am somewhat bewildered by why only one season of this show is on DVD.  I am NOT someone who took to this reality tv show genre with two big exceptions.  I do watch this show and PROJECT RUNWAY.  I have not even been tempted to watch any of the other reality tv shows.I first saw Kathy on SEINFELD.  Jerry is remarking to Kramer how terrible a stand up comic Kathy is and Kramer turns around and tells Kathy this dig.  In retaliation, Kathy stages a new show which completely tears apart Jerry Seinfeld, the stand-up comic, and it is a big hit, especially with everyone Jerry knows.Nowadays Kathy Griffin does stand up comedy shows plus also her own reality tv show.  The basis for the title is that Kathy is so far down the food chain as a celebrity that she is on the D List and hasn't got a chance of hitting the Hollywood A list (where Jerry Seinfeld is).The show is Kathy trying to forge her way up the food chain and beyond being on the D list.  She has some hilarious moments doing gigs that most other comics would rather die first before doing.  However, Kathy is unstoppable.  She is also incapable of being insulted.  Like most stand-up comics, she is very fast on her feet and can come back with rejoinders right away.  She also involves everyone she can in her quest and her parents have become mini stars in their own right. (her Dad has since died but her Mom remains a big hit)Since this first season she has won two Emmys for the show.  We are now on the 5th Season and Kathy Griffin, I submit, is no longer on the D list.  I don't know if she is on the A list yet, I doubt it, but she is moving up fast on the inside track.  I've also noticed that some of the bigger names are now getting her on their shows.  For example, during the time Letterman was getting pilloried over his Sarah Palin jokes, he brought Griffin on and she managed to get off a few key lines which helped Letterman's cause.  I also saw her appear on Howard Stern TV and there was nothing that he and his band of goons could say to fluster her.  She is so on top of her comedic game that they didn't have a chance up against her.  They were not able to land one blow on her, try as they did.  This was the first time I ever watched that show because normally I totally hate everyone on it.  Kathy is also the emcee for the Joan Rivers roast which is being broadcast this month.It really is great to see a female stand up comic start to make it like a Jerry Seinfeld.  Griffin is out there in the vanguard and doing one heck of a job.",5,Kathy Griffin Is A Wonderful Comedian & Stand Up Comic,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2570,"[""'m"", 'now', 'watching', '5th', 'season', 'show', 'am', 'somewhat', 'bewildered', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'show', 'DVD', 'am', 'NOT', 'someone', 'who', 'took', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'two', 'big', 'exceptions', 'do', 'watch', 'show', 'PROJECT', 'RUNWAY', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'tempted', 'watch', 'other', 'reality', 'tv', 'shows.I', 'first', 'saw', 'Kathy', 'SEINFELD', 'Jerry', 'remarking', 'Kramer', 'how', 'terrible', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'Kathy', 'Kramer', 'around', 'Kathy', 'dig', 'retaliation', 'Kathy', 'new', 'show', 'completely', 'apart', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'big', 'hit', 'especially', 'everyone', 'Jerry', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'shows', 'also', 'own', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'basis', 'title', 'Kathy', 'so', 'far', 'down', 'food', 'chain', 'celebrity', 'D', 'List', ""n't"", 'got', 'chance', 'hitting', 'Hollywood', 'A', 'list', 'where', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', '.The', 'show', 'Kathy', 'trying', 'forge', 'way', 'food', 'chain', 'being', 'D', 'list', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'doing', 'gigs', 'most', 'other', 'comics', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'first', 'doing', 'However', 'Kathy', 'unstoppable', 'also', 'incapable', 'being', 'insulted', 'most', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'very', 'fast', 'feet', 'can', 'come', 'back', 'rejoinders', 'right', 'away', 'also', 'everyone', 'can', 'quest', 'parents', 'have', 'become', 'mini', 'stars', 'own', 'right', 'Dad', 'died', 'Mom', 'big', 'hit', 'first', 'season', 'won', 'two', 'Emmys', 'show', 'are', 'now', '5th', 'Season', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'submit', 'no', 'longer', 'D', 'list', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'A', 'list', 'yet', 'doubt', 'moving', 'up', 'fast', 'inside', 'track', ""'ve"", 'also', 'noticed', 'bigger', 'names', 'are', 'now', 'getting', 'shows', 'example', 'time', 'Letterman', 'was', 'getting', 'pilloried', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'jokes', 'brought', 'Griffin', 'managed', 'get', 'off', 'few', 'key', 'lines', 'helped', 'Letterman', 'cause', 'also', 'saw', 'appear', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'TV', 'was', 'nothing', 'band', 'goons', 'could', 'say', 'fluster', 'so', 'top', 'comedic', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'up', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'land', 'one', 'blow', 'try', 'did', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'watched', 'show', 'normally', 'totally', 'hate', 'everyone', 'Kathy', 'also', 'emcee', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'roast', 'being', 'broadcast', 'month.It', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'female', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'start', 'make', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Griffin', 'out', 'there', 'vanguard', 'doing', 'one', 'heck', 'job']",N/A
1064156,ANTNA7JTP686X,B000OHZKYU,Coaster Pal,"[0, 0]","I'd seen Kathy Griffin live at a local theatre, and also enjoyed her on ""Suddenly Susan"" and particularly when she co-hosted a New Year's Eve show this past December 31 with Anderson Cooper, not to mention her many appearances on TV over the years.  She always makes me laugh, and that's the main reason I wanted to catch up on ""D-List,"" as I don't have cable and the DVD was on sale for a remarkably low price.  I'm not sure it's best to watch too many episodes in a row, as I did when I first got the DVD (four episodes in a row, for example, on my first viewing), as Kathy is one intense woman--at least as portrayed here.  That's not a bad thing overall, as her intensity is part of the reason she can be so overwhelmingly funny, but I would suggest taking a break between episodes.  It's fascinating to watch her hang with her parents, ""her gays,"" as she calls two of her best male friends, her assistant, and her husband as she navigates the clearly treacherous waters of life in Hollywood.  Never has it been both so glamourous and so depressing--it should be viewed by anyone wanting to break into that lifestyle, for cautionary purposes!  But, in the end, the viewer gets the feeling you could survive--and laugh--through most of it if one of your friends in Hollywood happened to be Kathy.  I recommend this DVD if you're a fan of Kathy's or if you're fascinated by behind-the-scenes Hollywood...or if you just like to laugh!",4,"Fascinating, funny, revealing",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,1435,"[""'d"", 'seen', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'live', 'local', 'theatre', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'particularly', 'when', 'co-hosted', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'show', 'past', 'December', '31', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'not', 'mention', 'many', 'appearances', 'TV', 'years', 'always', 'main', 'reason', 'wanted', 'catch', 'up', 'D-List', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'DVD', 'was', 'sale', 'remarkably', 'low', 'price', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'best', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'row', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'row', 'example', 'first', 'viewing', 'Kathy', 'one', 'intense', 'woman', 'least', 'portrayed', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'overall', 'intensity', 'part', 'reason', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'funny', 'would', 'suggest', 'taking', 'break', 'episodes', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'hang', 'parents', 'gays', 'two', 'best', 'male', 'friends', 'assistant', 'husband', 'clearly', 'treacherous', 'waters', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'Never', 'been', 'so', 'glamourous', 'so', 'depressing', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'break', 'lifestyle', 'cautionary', 'purposes', 'end', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'could', 'survive', 'laugh', 'most', 'one', 'friends', 'Hollywood', 'happened', 'be', 'Kathy', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Kathy', ""'re"", 'fascinated', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'laugh']",N/A

Griffin has long maintained the fact that she is a ""D-list"" celebrity and she claims this status was solidified with her appearance on Celebrity Mole: Hawaii, which she won. The series gives viewers a real insight into her life as it is entirely unscripted and features Kathy's husband as well as her parents and friends. When Kathy is shown going from venue to venue to perform, viewers are almost given an all access pass backstage as they get to see her planning her act as well as trying out material with her family and friends. The series is effective in conveying how Griffin is seen on the social scale in Hollywood and also shows that behind all her bravado, she can be quite fragile and sensitive.

Beloved by gays for demystifying the celebrity ""gift bag"" and the hefty portions of celebrity dish she serves up, Griffin shows that she does not need to be onstage to be funny.  Her observations are razor sharp, but she also pokes fun at herself and her celebrity status as a  D list celebrity.  There are still some remains of a little greasy triangle on my TV screen from my nose pressed up against the picture tube (At least that is what I tell everyone it is)during what has to be the funniest 6 hours of television- rivaled only by the second season.  Here is hoping for lots of extras.  Kathy has something for everyone to laugh at...er with.  I'm hoping for a big gift set with the 2 (so far) seasons and all her Bravo concerts.
