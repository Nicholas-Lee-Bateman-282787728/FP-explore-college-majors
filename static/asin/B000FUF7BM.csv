The protagonist is a likeable young girl and the Maori lady is a very interesting one.  i found it under the Family film genre, and I'm not quite sure I'd put it under that category.  While the protagonist is young there were a few of the more minor swear words in the movie, an underlying crush between the girl and her much older marching instructor, and a touch of idolatry in one scene.  Admittedly, the film leaves one with a nice and pleasant feeling.

It's a treat to watch a great family movie inspired by true events. Thirteen-year-old Elizabeth has a quest to convince the Queen of England to visit her small town in New Zealand. In the midst of this quest, she meets a reclusive native who is being pestered by her troublesome brother and his friends. Vicky Haughton is incredible as the elderly Maori woman, Hira. Hira gives young Elizabeth a lesson in how history books often make up their own version, rather than the truth. She also teaches Elizabeth to find her own personal courage in standing up for what she believes in, even if it makes her 'stand out' from the crowd. This is enlightening entertainment that is well-suited for younger audiences.Chrissy K.

996084,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000FUF7BM,Deborah Earle,"[7, 7]","This 2001 film shows off the beauty of New Zealand, and recreates the grace and charm of its society in the 1950s when it hosted the newly coronated Queen Elizabeth II.In some ways, I view  this fictional story of a fantasy-prone teenaged girl as a counterpart to the tragic true-to-life story of two fantasy-prone  teenaged girls in need of a reality check, portrayed in Peter Jackson's  ""Heavenly Creatures"", which took place in New Zealand around the same time. But Director Mark J. Gordon's tale is heartwarming and triumphant.With her large eyes and crooked smile, Sally Andrews gives a sincere performance as Elizabeth Wakefield, a dreamy 13-year-old living in Middleton, New Zealand in 1953, with her cheesemonger father (Mark Clare), mother(Alison Routledge), delinquent brother Stuart (Craig Elliott), and dog, Kupe (Hercules).She is a civic-minded young girl who enjoys school, being part of the marching squad, time spent with her best friend, Annabel Leach(Anna Sheridan), and determinedly writing letters to the Queen, enthralled by the pomp and splendor of the recent coronation.The postman, Nigel Osgood(Geoff Snell), left mute in battle during World War II, empathizes with her plight. He will come through for the young girl at a very critical moment, and will receive a miracle of his own.Elizabeth also has a schoolgirl's crush on her handsome young marching instructor, Ian Dixon (Cameron Smith), and the audience is treated to a cute dream sequence involving that issue. But realistically, she will experience a disappointment there.When her brother throws a brick through the window of a the small shack where an old Maori chief's daughter resides, Elizabeth smashes his piggybank, and accompanied by a frightened and reluctant Annabel, leaves money for reparation of the window.When she goes back later to retrieve her shoe, the old woman, Hira Mata (""Whale Rider's"" superb Vicky Haughton)angirly confronts her  about the breakage of her window, and Elizabeth gradually finds the answer for her brother's conduct. The young girl gradually begins to spend time talking to Hira and is given a different perspective on local history from the one she normally hears. Later, after the two discuss  the new Queen's  scheduled visit to Middleton, Hira tells the young girl about a tragedy that befell her family and tribe at the hands of locals in the wake of a previous Royal visit.Sobered by Hira's story, Elizabeth must find a way to reconcile the old woman's teachings with the desires of the local White population, as well as those of her family--who have a connection to Hira's tragedy--and her own dreams of meeting the Queen.The pompous, vain, arrogant, and immoral Virginia Hobson (the late Liddy Holloway), President of the Rhododendron Trust, and chairwoman of the Royal Welcoming Committee (who had intially scoffed at Elizabeth's letter-writing campaign inviting the Queen to Middleton)and the ladies' club to which Elizabeth's mother belongs, creates difficulties for Hira and the Wakefields as the big day approaches. But one redeeming aspect of that situation is that Mrs. Wakefield is not one of Mrs. Hobson's brownnosers, unlike her fellow committee members. In due time, Mrs. Hobson's mysterious influence over the Mayor(David Stott) and decisons about what the Queen will see in the town, will be exposed.Elizabeth displays a lot of moral courage in standing up on behalf of Hira, even the wake of her father's admonishments about visiting her, harassment by her brother and schoolmates, and the near loss of her friendship with Annabel.The great day in question will find one more major obstacle in Elizabeth's way, which she overcomes partially with advice from Hira, and help from Kupe and Annabel.It will prove to be a day of justice, and redemption in more ways than one as the young Queen (Rachel E. Wallis)and Prince Phillip (Andrew Bolton) arrive,and a young girl's dream comes true, proving to be beneficial to Hira as well. To everyone's surprise  the Queen's--and consequentially the town's-- attention will be drawn to a part of town that many had shunned, but which was wholly deserving of attention on that grand occasion.As the Royal party depart, there is a wonderful spirit of alacrity among the townspeople, and a sense of satisfaction from the visibly moved Hira that the past has been reconciled in the present, and a sense that two young friends will have glowing memories to share with posterity.",5,"Fantasies, Truth, Justice, and Redemption",1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,4455,"['2001', 'film',

996085,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000FUF7BM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","The reviews here give a good feel for the story, so I'll add a few observations that might help the would-be fan of this great American film set in New Zealand.1. The charming young Elizabeth's musically adept fantasy scenes are worth it...and I think she sings well, if that is her voice.2. This film really captures the early 1950s and the craze over Elizabeth's visit to New Zealand. I understand it was filmed in the country and at certain areas of Auckland. Beautiful to behold.3. All the actors except for the wonderful Vicky Haughton (WHALE RIDER) are famous in New Zealand but not outside of the country. I hope this film will help them become famous--they are delightful and incredibly talented, as we know from the likes of Sam Neill and Lucy Lawless.4. I loved the storyline about the old Maori woman Hira Mata (Haughton), the last of her line except for her nephew. It resonates as well as did RABBIT PROOF FENCE when it comes to the English pillaging of Natives everywhere...and it serves as a reminder for Americans' treatment of our own Natives.Get this sweet, delightful film, sugary at times though it may be.

996086,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000FUF7BM,Kevin Killian,"[1, 1]","Director Mark Gordon has a little bit of Baz Luhrmann-itis, and interrupts his own film several times to stage dream sequences for his 12 year old heroine, including one Busby Berkeley number of her dancing on a giant round of cheddar cheese.He didn't really need these added attractions to keep us interested in his story, which the actors splendidly invest with a lot of emotional and visceral truth.  For once a father-daughter film in which the mother is not painted as an ogre!  Here she's rather sweet, and acts as the emotional conduit between her husband and daughter, eventually giving away the game to the daughter by revealing the tragic back story the father has had to deal with all through his life, involving crimes against the Maori people.The mean brother, Stuart, is startlingly evil--and seems totally beyond redemption.  To me this left a sour note in the super happy resolution of the movie.  Just as well, since the conclusion of the movie is enough to make you scream with over-the-topness.  Everything you thought you knew about cliches in the movies is brought to a boil here--yes, even the one character who has been rendered psychically mute through trauma learns how to speak and say something heartwarming.  I can't even bring myself to tell you how the heroine's wonderful dog Kupe saves the day--even in the days of Rin Tin Tin the writers would have thought that too corny.And would the Queen of England actually do or say any of the things she is made to do and say in this multicultural parable?
