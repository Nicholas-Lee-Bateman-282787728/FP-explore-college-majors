That's what the people who made this movie expect you to believe.  And so the only way to enjoy this film is not to take it too seriously.I wish that they didn't make this movie.  The original was so perfect that any subsequent movie could only diminish the great beast's reputation. But while this movie looks crappy compared to its original, it looks brilliant and competent compared to the two sequels that would follow it.Anyone who hasn't seen this movie and gets it should not expect to be terrified.  What made the first Jaws movie great is that we didn't actually see the shark until the very end whereas in this film we see it in the opening sequence.  This takes away the mystery and the fear of the unknown but I guess by now the director figured everyone knew what the shark would look like anyways.  The only difference in how this shark looks is that in the early part of the movie the shark gets burned on a side of its face which does give it a cool kind of look.  And how the shark is killed in this film is almost as clever as in the original.Again, don't expect to be terrified.  This movie is a far better action/adventure story than a horror film.  Here are my rankings of the four Jaws movies:Jaws: 5 stars.Jaws 2: 3 stars.Jaws 3: 2 stars.Jaws the Revenge: 1 and 1/2 stars.For most people this film will be a waste of time.

It's nice to see a good chunk of the cast from the original, but the story overall just plays out as a rehash of the original with a few twists and turns.  What works in the movie is Roy Scheider's performance as a shell-shocked survivor of the first film who suspects that his town is about to suffer another shark problem when several people begin to disappear again off Amity's waters.  His fears are confirmed when he discovers both of his sons are in peril at the mercy of a shark during a sailing excursion with other teenagers.This movie is watchable and enjoyable, but it's not the shocker the original ""Jaws"" was.  The body count is higher in this movie, but the shark attacks are bloodless for the most part and don't pack the punch they did in the first film.  The shark doesn't look as realistic this time around either and they show way too much of it.  Jaws 2 plays out as more of a drive-in B monster movie and less of a shockfest like the first film.

200750,A16A2URPIZ7EEZ,6300182177,"Arthur S. Almquist ""art_the_movie_critic""","[1, 3]","I was six when I first saw the original ""Jaws"" in the theatre, so I saw ""Jaws 2"" in its theatrical release at the far more mature age of nine.  At the time, I really liked this sequel more.  I don't feel this way now, but my reasoning wasn't bad for a pre-adolescent: the shark scenes are complicated and beautifully staged (especially the first attack on the catamarans), Roy Scheider's performance fleshes out even more depth of his character, and John Williams' score is a masterpiece....but of course it's not better than the original.A few thoughts: the original has always received all the accolades, and then all of the coverage (a la interviews, behind the scenes info, etc.).  I love all that this DVD has to offer: the documentary brings in Zanuck & Brown (not surprisingly, both very smart and articulate), Joe Alves, Carl Gottlieb, and director Jeannot Szwarc.  (I do wish that Scheider had participated.)  As a theatrical actor, director, and teacher of theatre, I couldn't get enough of all that those connected with the film offered.  Szwarc particularly impressed me; some have criticized his direction of the film as a Spielberg ..., but he demonstrates that he did his homework and made a film that was truly his own.  For example, I've never liked the fact that the film shows the shark in all its glory so early, but Szwarc explains why this was a deliberate choice.  (I still don't agree, but it's good to hear a smart director defend his choices.)Actor/director Keith Gordon also delivers a wonderful short film chronicling his experience with ""Jaws 2,"" and it is also not surprisingly excellent, full of great story-telling and humor.  (If you haven't seen ""The Chocolate War"" and ""A Midnight Clear,"" these are two superb independent films which he directed.)I do have a few complaints.  Is it me, or does the widescreen here look just slightly squashed from side-to side?  It looks like it needed some more black on the letterboxing to me...also, I don;t have home theatre, so I can't tell if the sound is as disappointing as some of these reviews have said.And finally, the one shot in the film that drives me crazy is the one that concludes the extraordinary sequence in which Mike is pulled on board the catamaran just as the shark propels by the boat.  Everything works until the shark opens its mouth, and the rubber or the shark's nose bends in a totally unnatural way.  Szwarc explains how difficult that shot was to get so we can forgive it...but it's always taken me out of the moment of suspense to see that, and I wish that he had said ""[darn] it, I wish the nose didn't do that.""Well, this is nit-picking, isn't it?

It was the highest grossing film of it's day, and one of the scariest. So, it was only disappointing that that fine effort got the sequel treatment that went straight into the ground. While this 1978 sequel is not bad at all, it could've been worse. It could of been Jaws 3-D, or Jaws 4 : The Revenge. Unfortunatley, this sequel isn't without damaging flaws. The filmmakers basically took a high quality Hollywood production like the original film, and tried to do the same with this one, only wrapping it up in predictable horror sequel cliches and predictability. The film is basically a re-hash of the original, and it's a shame that original screenwriter Carl Gottlieb was involved. Sheriff Martin Brody, once again played by the solid and dependable Roy Scheider(the film's only human saving grace)is still the sheriff in the small quaint town of Amity(really Marth's Vineyard). When two divers go missing, and more strange occurences and disappearences start to occur, it doesn't take the good sheriff long to realize that he might have another killer shark on his hands. The town's mayor, played again by Murray Hamilton, is put off by this and basically acts the same as he did in the original. Instead of people going out for the shark, the killer beast sets his sights on a group of young teens out sailing. And of course, two of them are Brody kids. This is where the horror sequel cliches come in. No real story. Just a re-doing, albeit weakly, of the first one. The cast of potential shark food is pumped up more, with a few more deaths, and more footage of Bruce the killer shark, who looks more like the mechanical one at Universal Studios than a real one, like in the original. Director Jeannot Szwarc, who also directed 1984's hideous, ""Supergirl"", shamelessly tries to emulate Spielberg, but without the depth, heart, and stirring character study. The kids aren't fleshed out and quite frankly, nothing to really root for. Donna Wilkes, who plays Jackie, will get on your nerves fast. The only other person in the bunch of kids you might recognize is Keith Gordon, who went on to do some early to mid 80's films. Scheider is the one who saves it, delivering another finely crafted and nuanced performance of Martin Brody, but without the right script to back him up. Lorraine Gary gets a little more action here, but not much. Basically the same wife role that has her looking concerned in the background.

I didn't think the ""Jaws"" brand name would be sold out so cheaply. But it was when it allowed itself to be applied to this stinker. Not only is the writing lousy, the characters are shallow at best, including municipal leaders who conveniently have very short memories as they relive the past and fall perfectly in line with the unimaginative story line. The Brody's themselves seem to have short memories, but they merely symbolize the rest of the town who, despite some awfully familiar clues, jump in and out of the water with wreckless abandon w/o giving the possibility of a shark even a remote consideration. And the shark itself takes on something of a slasher personna in its predatory behavior in the way it chooses its prey. Not to mention how unlike in the original, this shark plays to the camera and takes on un-shark like characteristics, expanding a little more on the original sharks acrobatics. All this sequel needs (as well as the 3rd and 4th installments) is a hockey mask for the shark and the creativity for the plot line would be complete.

JAWS 2 suffered countless problems in production, which caused for the removal of the original director (John D. Hancock) in place of longtime television director Jeannot Szwarc. The resulting film serves as a continuation of the events that occurred four years earlier, bringing back many familiar faces including Roy Scheider and Lorraine Gary as Martin and Ellen Brody, as well as Murray Hamilton and other returning members of Amity's city council. We are also introduced to the town's teens, whose day sailing adventures set the menu for the new shark. The once stern Chief Brody is reduced to a delusional mess when faced with another summer of blood, let alone the disbelieving council members that want to avoid another public humiliation. Unlike in the original, the shark emerges quite early on in this sequel, which relies on the viciousness of the attacks to earn its scares rather than the implied terror of the first. In doing so, the tension and suspense have both been dramatically reduced. John Williams plays a slight variation on his earlier themes, injecting them with a frenetic energy and creating a sense of immediacy in each strike. Outside of the slower pacing, the major flaw with this first sequel is that it attempts to mirror the structure of the original, but with less interesting characters found in the teenagers and a far less epic finale. Where Szwarc does succeed is in establish a sense of continuity in the similar look and feel of the film, while bringing back much of the same humor and heart in the script. As sequels go, it is a valid followup, but one that lacks bite.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Jaws 2,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1855,"['When', 'two', 'divers', 'disappear', 'coast', 'pictures', 'underwater', 'camera', 'reveal', 'police', 'chief', 'Martin', 'Brody', 'greatest', 'fear', 'Great', 'White', 'shark', 'begun', 'prowling', 'waters', 'Amity', 'Island', 'JAWS', '2', 'suffered', 'countless', 'problems', 'production', 'caused', 'removal', 'original', 'director', 'John', 'D.', 'Hancock', 'place', 'longtime', 'television', 'director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'resulting', 'film', 'serves', 'continuation', 'events', 'occurred', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'bringing', 'back', 'many', 'familiar', 'including', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'Martin', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'as', 'well', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'other', 'returning', 'members', 'Amity', 'city', 'council', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'town', 'teens', 'day', 'sailing', 'adventures', 'set', 'menu', 'new', 'shark', 'once', 'stern', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'reduced', 'delusional', 'mess', 'when', 'faced', 'summer', 'blood', 'let', 'alone', 'disbelieving', 'council', 'members', 'want', 'avoid', 'public', 'humiliation', 'original', 'shark', 'quite', 'early', 'sequel', 'viciousness', 'attacks', 'earn', 'scares', 'rather', 'implied', 'terror', 'first', 'doing', 'so', 'tension', 'suspense', 'have', 'been', 'dramatically', 'reduced', 'John', 'Williams', 'slight', 'variation', 'earlier', 'themes', 'injecting', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'creating', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'strike', 'slower', 'pacing', 'major', 'flaw', 'first', 'sequel', 'mirror', 'structure', 'original', 'less', 'interesting', 'characters', 'found', 'teenagers', 'far', 'less', 'epic', 'finale', 'Where', 'Szwarc', 'succeed', 'establish', 'sense', 'continuity', 'similar', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'bringing', 'back', 'much', 'same', 'humor', 'heart', 'script', 'sequels', 'go', 'valid', 'followup', 'one', 'bite.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

In 1979, director Jeannot Szwarc had given us the film, JAWS 2, the highly anticipated sequel to its successful predecessor.It is 1979, just four years after the great white shark had terrorized the peaceful community island of Amity Island in New York State. MARTIN BRODY (again played by Roy Scheider) is still the chief of police in Amity Island. He and his wife, ELLEN BRODAY (again played by Lorraine Gary) still reside in Amity Island, with their two sons, MICHAEL (played by Mark Gruner), now 17-years old, and SEAN (played by Marc Gilpin), now 7-years old. Brody is on his way to a new hotel in Amity Island, where Ellen has thrown together an opening-night party for the hotel. The Amity High School Orchestra is playing some great music, while LARRY VAUGHN (again played by Murray Hamilton), still the mayor of Amity, gives a speech. All of Amity shows up, including Sean, Michael, and Michael's friends, which include, TINA WILCOX (played by Ann Dusenberry), EDDIE MARCHAND (played by Gary Dubin), who is Tina's boyfriend, LARRY VAUGHN JR. (played by David Elliott), who is Larry Vaughn's son, DOUG FETTERMAN (played by Keith Gordan), TIMMY WELDON (played by G. Thompson Dunlop), BROOKE PETERS (played by Gigi Vorgan), & ANDY NICHOLAS (played by Gary Springer). While this party is going on, nobody has a clue that two divers have gone under water, where a boat has been sunk for four years. That boat turns out to be...ORCA, the boat where Brody, Hooper, and Quint had sailed on to kill the first shark. As the two divers take under-water-pictures of each other in front of this boat, another great white shark comes along and kills them both.The next morning, while Michael, Andie, Larry Jr., Doug, Timmy, Tina, Eddie, and Brooke are setting up to go sailing, Brooke's cousin, JACKIE PETERS (played by Donna Wilkes) shows up, as a blind date for Michael. They all head out to go sailing. Later on in the afternoon, while Eddie and Tina are making out on the beach, there is a water skier riding around. She is killed by the shark, leaving her mother, who is driving the boat, to wonder what had happened, leading her into fighting the shark. She tries to blow the shark up, but the gasoline is poured over her, where the flames catch on her and explode the entire boat, allowing the shark to get away free. Tina, Eddie, and a nearby old lady call Brody. Brody knows it instantly.The next afternoon, Brody and his friends find a half-eaten killer whale on the beach, giving Brody more of a reason to believe that the town is having another shark problem. He discusses this with Larry Sr., but Larry, as usual, shows no interest because of his want for money. At that same time, Brody finds the girl's skiing board, where the driver's burnt up dead body appears, leading Brody to take matters into his own hands. He is forced to take matters into his own hands anyway, since Matt Hooper is unavailable until the following Spring.The next morning, Brody causes panic on the beach, for he thinks he may have spotted the shark and decided to shoot at it. He realizes that the only shot at a school of bluefish. That night, after only earlier in the week where Brody found the camera used by the divers from the beginning, has the film in the camera developed, where a picture of the shark is revealed. He runs over to the townhall and shows it to Larry Sr. and Ellen's boss. They decide to fire Brody from his job, rather than help the town out.The next morning, Michael sneaks out of the house to go sailing with his friends. His sneaking out is so he can do this, since Brody gave him a job that'll last Michael through the whole summer. Sean decides to go along with Michael. The kids set out, as Eddie and Tina stay behind to have some fun of their own, but that is cut short when Eddie is killed by the shark, leaving Tina in shock. Jeff Hendricks, Brody's deputy, who is also in the first film, reveals to Brody and Ellen that Michael and his friends had gone out. Ellen, Hendricks, and Brody head out to get to them, where they find Tina. Ellen takes her out to a hospital, where Brody sets out to find the kids.The kids are attacked by the shark, but luckily, nobody is hurt. Unfortunately, their boats had been ripped almost into pieces, stranding them in the middle of Amity's ocean. Michael had been hurt. Timmy's boat hasn't been damaged. He uses his boat to take Michael to the hospital. Brody finds them, where Michael tells him that Sean is out there with Michael's friends.

Well if you haven't read my review for that one, I'll fill you in on what ruined this movie and its one word: (dramatic pause) TEENAGERS!!! Did we really need them, besides Brody's kids? OK, a girlfriend and two, three friends tops for Michael would've been fine but at least it could've made their scenes watchable! The only reason teenagers were even included in the script, from what I've observed and researched anyway, was because of the then rising popularity of the slasher film (Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween particular) They're given way too much screen time and I was begging that the shark was going to eat more of them. Yes, it was sad when the girl who saved Sean's life got devoured right in front of the poor boy's eyes but one heroic act is not enough for me to give this a favorable review. I already don't like kid actors and after this movie, now I have to add teen actors to the list (the ones from Power Rangers don't count, they were pretty much in their twenties anyway).",2,Tolerably Watchable,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2064,"['know', 'said', 'only', 'one', 'week', 'had', 'post', 'review', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'know', ""'m"", 'gon', 'get', 'lot', 'hate', 'mail', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'measurable', 'third', 'film', 'acting', 'great', 'Scheider', 'very', 'believable', 'paranoia', 'shark', 'anger', 'when', 'council', ""n't"", 'agree', 'story', 'great', 'know', 'film', 'technically', 'rehash', 'first', 'film', 'least', ""n't"", 'have', 'rehashed', 'copout', 'ending', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Cut', 'Superman', 'II', 'review', 'day', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'John', 'Williams', 'would', 'expect', 'anything', 'less', 'action', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'shocking', 'ending', 'sorry', 'horrible', 'pun', 'dramatic', 'action', 'oriented', 'like', 'subtle', 'reference', 'non-Jaws', 'rip-off', 'Orca', 'Killer', 'Whale', 'heck', 'even', 'shark', 'looked', 'great', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'when', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'compared', 'supposedly', 'bad', 'fourth', 'film', 'Well', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'one', ""'ll"", 'fill', 'what', 'ruined', 'movie', 'one', 'word', 'dramatic', 'pause', 'TEENAGERS', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'Brody', 'kids', 'OK', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'three', 'friends', 'tops', 'Michael', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fine', 'least', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'scenes', 'watchable', 'only', 'reason', 'teenagers', 'were', 'even', 'included', 'script', 'what', ""'ve"", 'observed', 'researched', 'anyway', 'was', 'then', 'rising', 'popularity', 'slasher', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Halloween', 'particular', ""'re"", 'given', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'begging', 'shark', 'was', 'going', 'eat', 'more', 'Yes', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'girl', 'who', 'saved', 'Sean', 'life', 'got', 'devoured', 'right', 'front', 'poor', 'boy', 'eyes', 'one', 'heroic', 'act', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'favorable', 'review', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kid', 'actors', 'movie', 'now', 'have', 'add', 'teen', 'actors', 'list', 'ones', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'twenties', 'anyway']",N/A

Everything about the first film was pitch perfect from the cast to the script to the special effects (or lack thereof) to the director to the music. So ""Jaws 2"" goes for a complete change of pace, and manages to remain an entertaining if not a classic film.The poor folks of Amity are slowly recovering from the events of the first film when a second shark comes along and begins munching on hapless divers before the opening credits even finish rolling. Chief Brody begins to suspect they may have another man eating shark preying on vacationers...but of course a land developer and the town council don't want to hear that...so they ignore his warnings. The buffet gets set when a group of kids decide to go party at a deserted light house.The first half of the film is a slow build where we follow Cheif Brody through his daily routine and his investigation into two missing divers. When signs begin pointing to a shark attack and Brody begins to panic, the film sort of comes into it's own. I like the idea of Brody having to face his worst nightmare all over and all on his own this time.But once the kids set sail for the light house is where ""Jaws 2"" firmly plants it's feet into B-Movie territory. The film then has all of the substance of a 1980's slasher film....but instead of a masked killer...you get a disfigured great white shark doing the killing. That might sound as though I didn't care for this part of the film...and that would be wrong. I love 1980's slasher films, and love the formula of people rendered helpless and placed in jeopardy...(I've seen every ""Halloween"" & ""Friday the 13th"" film in the theater...both of which have milked this premise for multiple sequels) If anything I wish they had exploited this angle a bit further with more gratuitous bloodshed and killing. I guess they were trying to stay within PG parameters but it's still a fun little ride even with this tamer approach.I think ""Jaws 2"" is worth owning, and worth adding to your DVD collection, while not nearly in league with the original film, you'll still find yourself pulling this one out every now and again for a cheap thrill.",3,"A Shark ""Slasher"" Film",1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,2194,"['Let', 'face', 'topping', 'original', 'Jaws', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'Everything', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'cast', 'script', 'special', 'effects', 'lack', 'thereof', 'director', 'music', 'Jaws', '2', 'complete', 'change', 'pace', 'remain', 'entertaining', 'not', 'classic', 'film.The', 'poor', 'folks', 'Amity', 'are', 'slowly', 'recovering', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'second', 'shark', 'along', 'munching', 'hapless', 'divers', 'opening', 'credits', 'even', 'finish', 'rolling', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'suspect', 'may', 'have', 'man', 'eating', 'shark', 'preying', 'vacationers', 'course', 'land', 'developer', 'town', 'council', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'so', 'ignore', 'warnings', 'buffet', 'set', 'when', 'group', 'kids', 'decide', 'go', 'party', 'deserted', 'light', 'house.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'slow', 'build', 'where', 'follow', 'Cheif', 'Brody', 'daily', 'routine', 'investigation', 'two', 'missing', 'divers', 'When', 'signs', 'begin', 'pointing', 'shark', 'attack', 'Brody', 'panic', 'film', 'sort', 'own', 'like', 'idea', 'Brody', 'having', 'face', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'own', 'time.But', 'once', 'kids', 'set', 'sail', 'light', 'house', 'where', 'Jaws', '2', 'firmly', 'plants', 'feet', 'B-Movie', 'territory', 'film', 'then', 'substance', '1980', 'slasher', 'film', '.but', 'instead', 'masked', 'killer', 'get', 'disfigured', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'doing', 'killing', 'might', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'love', '1980', 'slasher', 'films', 'love', 'formula', 'people', 'rendered', 'helpless', 'placed', 'jeopardy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'theater', 'have', 'milked', 'premise', 'multiple', 'sequels', 'anything', 'wish', 'had', 'exploited', 'bit', 'further', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'bloodshed', 'killing', 'guess', 'were', 'trying', 'stay', 'PG', 'parameters', 'still', 'fun', 'little', 'ride', 'even', 'tamer', 'think', 'Jaws', '2', 'worth', 'owning', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'not', 'nearly', 'league', 'original', 'film', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'pulling', 'one', 'now', 'again', 'cheap', 'thrill']",N/A

Granted, not as much as the 1975 original classic, but this second installment in the series had some very scary and tense moments of its own. The helicopter being eaten by the predator was a bit much, but still interesting.I thought the group of young people assembled to form the cast of ""Jaws 2"" did a darn good job. Reactions to the situations facing them seemed genuine, in my opinion. And the dialogue used by the writers seemed to fit 1978 standards.

200782,A3FDHJWK54LHAO,6300182177,"""dbzub22""","[0, 0]","When I was just a kid, and I watched Jaws for the first time on t.v., it amazed me, and to this day, it still does! But as soon as the movie was over and the credits began to roll, I was left wanting more. Would I never see that mechanical fin, accompanied by Williams' classic score again?Not long after that, my parents mentioned to me that a sequel had been made, and that it was available on video. Needless to say, I nagged them into renting it, and I was not dissapointed.Jaws 2 sort of appealed to a different age group, but it still maintained the spirit of the first film. John Williams also returned, providing a score that was in every way as good as the first, which made the movie even better. However, I notice this movie never really gets the praise it deserves. This movie was a great 'creature feature', and I've seen them all! I think one of the things that worked against this movie the most was that its predececcor was one of the most famous movies in american cinema history, not to mention it was the title that launched Steven Spielberg's smashing career. So how can Jaws 2 possibly live up to all of this? I honestly don't care. It's a story about a Great White shark attacking vacationers off the waters of a small picturesque town, it isn't Gone With The Wind! Besides, it's far better than most movies of this genere. Many of which [were similar to]scenes in this movie. Some obvious ones were in Deep Blue Sea. Killing a shark with an electrical cable!? Attacking a helicopter!? I've seen it before, and I enjoyed it more in Jaws 2.In short, I believe this movie served its purpose well as both a 'creature feature' and a sequel. It let us see more of the shark than we ever saw in the first movie, and answered the question as to what would happen if another great white shark ever stalked the waters of Amity Island.I am also very pleased that Univeral has finally released this movie on DVD. Visually, this movie looks just as good as its predecessor. The sound quality is great. It may not be 5.1, but at least the original sound effects haven't been replaced with inferior ones like the first Jaws DVD.As far as the extras were amazing, especially for a Jaws sequel. The 'making of' documentary was interesting and entertaining, and didn't drag on and on like the one for the first Jaws.The interviews with with John Williams and Keith Gorden were short but sweet, and offered some interesting insight regarding their experience in the making of this movie.In addition, there were also four deleted scenes in a bonus section. I found the deleted scenes in Jaws 2 to be of much better quality than the ones in Jaws. Jaws 2 even offers an additional shark sequence, or rather an extension of an existing scene, which is what most viewers probably want to see. This one involves the shark attacking a pilot trapped underwater in his helicopter. I honestly think all of the scenes should've been re-edited in the movie.I was also pleased how the trailer for the orignal Jaws was included with this DVD. Too bad there wasn't a trailer for Jaws 3 and Jaws The Revenge as well.All in all, this movie delivers as a sequel. I highly recommended this title to any Jaws fan. But to those who still buy vhs, I say don't even bother with the so called 'special edition' of this movie. Its biggest feature is a ten minute documentary.

It wasn't the shark that made Jaws and Jaws 2 so loveable on a personal note, but the character of Chief Brody - husband, father, and just your everyday guy you can relate to and want everyone to listen to.  The cast in Jaws 2 loses the sting of the original, this time focused more on a group of teenagers rather then the 3-some combination of Brody, Hooper and Quint of the original.  The inclusion of younger teens in the mix adds a bit to the horror element though, as opposed to pitting much more experienced men in the scenario.  But the overall horror in the movie felt a little more toned down.  The shark is more visible throughout this film, and looks even more fake this time.  The absence of seeing the shark throughout most of the first film is what kept the horror intense.  Overall, this is a good sequal, and the only good sequal in the series.Brody's character takes on even more of a lead role this time, and Scheider does a fantastic job.  He is still the guy you can relate to, just making a living, taking care of family, and trying to do the right thing by standing by it to the very end - literally, when he gets fired from his job.  The town leaders are ignorant, again, to the supposed facts of another shark until its too late.  A group of teenagers (including both of Brody's sons) set out sailing in rather flimsy boats and get attcked by the shark, leaving them adrift, slowly heading for a small rock island known as ""Cable Junction"" - the last hope before hitting the open ocean.  I actually enjoyed the first half of this film much more, it sets everything up well, especially with Brody.  The second half of the film is more about the shark attacks on the teenagers, which is fun but the characters and the plot lose the intensity of the first half, oddly enough.  The dvd includes some deleted scenes, one is actually pretty decent with the shark attack on the helicopter pilot, trapped in his helicopter after it flipped over in the water.  I would have loved them to include this scene in the film.Jaws 2 distances itself from the original in terms of a tight cast, script and story, but is still much better than Jaws 3 and 4.  The overall plot is actually very similar to the first film, just not as neatly produced. The horror elements are certainly there, but again, not quite as exciting.  This is still worth checking out, especially to see Roy Scheider in another fantastic acting role.Acting - 4Characters - 4Horror - 4Story - 3.5Overall - 4",4,The only worthy sequal in the series,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,2691,"['news', 'was', 'shocking', 'watched', 'Jaws', '2', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'admiring', 'only', 'superb', 'standout', 'film', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'performance', 'then', 'learning', 'next', 'morning', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'passed', 'away', 'was', ""n't"", 'shark', 'made', 'Jaws', 'Jaws', '2', 'so', 'loveable', 'personal', 'note', 'character', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'husband', 'father', 'just', 'everyday', 'guy', 'can', 'relate', 'want', 'everyone', 'listen', 'cast', 'Jaws', '2', 'sting', 'original', 'time', 'focused', 'more', 'group', 'teenagers', 'rather', 'then', '3-some', 'combination', 'Brody', 'Hooper', 'Quint', 'original', 'inclusion', 'younger', 'teens', 'mix', 'bit', 'horror', 'element', 'though', 'opposed', 'pitting', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'men', 'scenario', 'overall', 'horror', 'movie', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'shark', 'more', 'visible', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'fake', 'time', 'absence', 'seeing', 'shark', 'most', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'kept', 'horror', 'intense', 'Overall', 'good', 'sequal', 'only', 'good', 'sequal', 'series.Brody', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'lead', 'role', 'time', 'Scheider', 'fantastic', 'job', 'still', 'guy', 'can', 'relate', 'just', 'making', 'living', 'taking', 'care', 'family', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'standing', 'very', 'end', 'literally', 'when', 'fired', 'job', 'town', 'leaders', 'are', 'ignorant', 'again', 'supposed', 'facts', 'shark', 'too', 'late', 'group', 'teenagers', 'including', 'Brody', 'sons', 'set', 'out', 'sailing', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'boats', 'get', 'attcked', 'shark', 'leaving', 'adrift', 'slowly', 'heading', 'small', 'rock', 'island', 'known', 'Cable', 'Junction', 'last', 'hope', 'hitting', 'open', 'ocean', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'everything', 'up', 'well', 'especially', 'Brody', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'more', 'shark', 'attacks', 'teenagers', 'fun', 'characters', 'plot', 'lose', 'intensity', 'first', 'half', 'oddly', 'enough', 'dvd', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'shark', 'attack', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'trapped', 'helicopter', 'flipped', 'water', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'include', 'scene', 'film.Jaws', '2', 'distances', 'original', 'terms', 'tight', 'cast', 'script', 'story', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'Jaws', '3', '4', 'overall', 'plot', 'actually', 'very', 'similar', 'first', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'neatly', 'produced', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'certainly', 'there', 'again', 'not', 'quite', 'exciting', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'especially', 'see', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'role.Acting', '4Characters', '4Horror', '4Story', '3.5Overall', '4']",N/A

As played in this film, Brody is a tightly wound time bomb who instantly becomes irrational and then wonders why he's fired after going on a shooting spree in the middle of a beach filled with people.  As misplayed by Scheider, Brody now exhibits a mania that doesn't make sense nor does it ever ring true.  It's an artifice for story sake only.  At this point, even a little of Scheider's wild eyed buffoon is way too much; he managed to turn a likable/sympathetic character into an obnoxious hysterical loony.  I was beginning to hope the shark would eat him along with the shrieking girl.I have to say I'm torn where this movie is concerned.  As presented, I only like the last half of this sequel.  There's just way too much of the Brodys and the usual lineup of teens from central casting.  I wish they could have gotten Richard Dreyfuss to reprise his character but he's only referenced briefly.  It doesn't help that half of these characters act as if they've forgotten the first film.  Murray Hamilton basically just repeats his role as the idiot mayor with the identical skepticism seen in the first film: what shark, where, when, what are you talking about?  It's maddening the way the story is written, stacking everything against the chief of police, forcing him to become the one and only hero because apparently he's surrounded by fools.  This film could have done with fewer writers and more rewrites.  Still, you can't beat the shark action and the helicopter scene (plus, there's Joseph Mascolo; Stefano DiMera!).",4,"""Sharks don't take things personally Mr. Brody.""",1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,1653,"['complaint', 'same', 'why', '4', 'years', 'did', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'wait', 'have', 'meltdown', 'go', 'berserk', 'played', 'film', 'Brody', 'tightly', 'wound', 'time', 'bomb', 'who', 'instantly', 'irrational', 'then', 'wonders', 'why', 'fired', 'going', 'shooting', 'spree', 'middle', 'beach', 'filled', 'people', 'misplayed', 'Scheider', 'Brody', 'now', 'mania', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'ever', 'ring', 'true', 'artifice', 'story', 'sake', 'only', 'point', 'even', 'little', 'Scheider', 'wild', 'eyed', 'buffoon', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'managed', 'turn', 'likable/sympathetic', 'character', 'obnoxious', 'hysterical', 'loony', 'was', 'beginning', 'hope', 'shark', 'would', 'eat', 'along', 'shrieking', 'girl.I', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'torn', 'where', 'movie', 'concerned', 'presented', 'only', 'last', 'half', 'sequel', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Brodys', 'usual', 'lineup', 'teens', 'central', 'casting', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'reprise', 'character', 'only', 'referenced', 'briefly', ""n't"", 'help', 'half', 'characters', 'act', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'first', 'film', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'basically', 'just', 'repeats', 'role', 'idiot', 'mayor', 'identical', 'skepticism', 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'shark', 'where', 'when', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'maddening', 'way', 'story', 'written', 'stacking', 'everything', 'chief', 'police', 'forcing', 'become', 'one', 'only', 'hero', 'apparently', 'surrounded', 'fools', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'fewer', 'writers', 'more', 'rewrites', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'shark', 'action', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'Joseph', 'Mascolo', 'Stefano', 'DiMera']",N/A

I must have been the only kid in the third grade who had not seen this new and exciting phenomenon!  Three years later, having heard the sequel was more tame and less bloody, they let me see JAWS 2.  I was also able to see it at an old movie house in a small beach town in the Hamptons, adding to the effect of where the movie took place.So there lies my sentimental connection with this film.  Yes, it's not as good as the original, and who in 1978, in their right mind ever thought it would be when they were paying for their ticket?  What I've always admired about this film is that, if nothing else, it tried to be a new and different film.

200796,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300182177,Erik North,"[0, 0]","JAWS 2 goes under my designation of films which I call ""Curiously Frustrating""--a group that also includes HALLOWEEN II and THE RAGE: CARRIE 2. Yes, these are all sequels, and as a rule sequels almost never live up to the originals, especially if the first films are bonafide classics. JAWS 2 falls under this category because there are as many sub-par elements in it as there are good ones.It has been three years since Amity Island was terrorized by a Great White shark that took several lives. Unfortunately, there happens to be more than one killer Great White in the Atlantic waters off the island; and when police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) investigates a number of stange things (divers investigating the wreck of the ""Orca"" who mysteriously disappear; a woman in a speedboat being killed in an explosion; a whale beaching itself with large bite marks), he wonders if a second shark isn't causing this.Not surprisingly (except maybe for audiences), he runs into conflict once again with the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and the town's business interests, who once more are concerned with the almighty dollar (in the form of real estate developments) than with human lives. This time, however, the battle is very bitter, and Scheider loses his job after he causes an unintended panic on the beach. Virtually the only support he gets in this comes from his wife (Lorraine Gary) and deputy (Jeffrey Kramer).But when groups of teens, including his two sons, involved in a boating regatta, suddenly have run-ins with the shark, it is Scheider who once more must take matters into his own hands. After considerable mayhem (including a Coast Guard chopper being chewed up by the shark), Scheider, as he had to do the first time around, must resort to unconventional means to finish off this killer fish.Though it had fewer problems in production than the first one did, those fewer problems led to the audience seeing the shark more, which wasn't the case the first time around. The trouble is that the director Jeannot Szwarc, who made the 1975 horror film BUG, indulges in a lot of shark's-view shots to make up for his inability to create mounting suspense the way Steven Spielberg did it the first time around. Except for Scheider, most of the characters in JAWS 2 are either too thinly drawn or too unsympathetic to arouse our sympathy. Would this have been rectified had Spielberg helmed this film, and Richard Dreyfuss returned as Matt Hooper, as had been hoped? Almost certainly.On the other hand, Scheider's determined performance carries the film through the utter contrivances of the Carl Gottlieb-Howard Sackler screenplay (the chopper sequence being spectacular but most ludicrous), as does another great John Williams score. In the end, JAWS 2 could never really hope to measure up to its illustrious predecessor, unless Spielberg wanted to step in. When compared to its two successors and the scores of imitations the original spawned, however, that assessment is perhaps higher praise than it actually sounds like.",3,There's More Than ONE Fish In The Sea,1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,3032,"['JAWS', '2', 'designation', 'films', 'call', 'Curiously', 'Frustrating', 'group', 'also', 'HALLOWEEN', 'II', 'THE', 'RAGE', 'CARRIE', '2', 'Yes', 'are', 'sequels', 'rule', 'almost', 'never', 'live', 'up', 'originals', 'especially', 'first', 'films', 'are', 'bonafide', 'classics', 'JAWS', '2', 'falls', 'category', 'are', 'many', 'sub-par', 'elements', 'are', 'good', 'ones.It', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'Amity', 'Island', 'was', 'terrorized', 'Great', 'White', 'shark', 'took', 'several', 'lives', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'killer', 'Great', 'White', 'Atlantic', 'waters', 'island', 'when', 'police', 'chief', 'Martin', 'Brody', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'number', 'stange', 'things', 'divers', 'investigating', 'wreck', 'Orca', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'woman', 'speedboat', 'being', 'killed', 'explosion', 'whale', 'beaching', 'large', 'bite', 'marks', 'second', 'shark', ""n't"", 'causing', 'this.Not', 'surprisingly', 'maybe', 'audiences', 'conflict', 'once', 'again', 'mayor', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'town', 'business', 'interests', 'who', 'once', 'more', 'are', 'concerned', 'almighty', 'dollar', 'form', 'real', 'estate', 'developments', 'human', 'lives', 'time', 'however', 'battle', 'very', 'bitter', 'Scheider', 'job', 'unintended', 'panic', 'beach', 'Virtually', 'only', 'support', 'wife', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'deputy', 'Jeffrey', 'Kramer', '.But', 'when', 'groups', 'teens', 'including', 'two', 'sons', 'involved', 'boating', 'regatta', 'suddenly', 'have', 'run-ins', 'shark', 'Scheider', 'who', 'once', 'more', 'must', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'considerable', 'mayhem', 'including', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'chopper', 'being', 'chewed', 'up', 'shark', 'Scheider', 'had', 'do', 'first', 'time', 'must', 'resort', 'unconventional', 'means', 'finish', 'off', 'killer', 'had', 'fewer', 'problems', 'production', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'fewer', 'problems', 'led', 'audience', 'seeing', 'shark', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'trouble', 'director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'who', 'made', '1975', 'horror', 'film', 'BUG', 'lot', ""shark's-view"", 'shots', 'make', 'up', 'inability', 'create', 'mounting', 'way', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Scheider', 'most', 'characters', 'JAWS', '2', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'thinly', 'drawn', 'too', 'unsympathetic', 'arouse', 'sympathy', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'rectified', 'had', 'Spielberg', 'helmed', 'film', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'returned', 'Matt', 'Hooper', 'had', 'been', 'hoped', 'Almost', 'certainly.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Scheider', 'determined', 'performance', 'film', 'utter', 'contrivances', 'Carl', 'Gottlieb-Howard', 'Sackler', 'screenplay', 'chopper', 'sequence', 'being', 'spectacular', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'great', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'end', 'JAWS', '2', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'hope', 'measure', 'up', 'illustrious', 'predecessor', 'Spielberg', 'wanted', 'step', 'When', 'compared', 'two', 'successors', 'scores', 'imitations', 'original', 'spawned', 'however', 'assessment', 'perhaps', 'higher', 'praise', 'actually']",N/A

Enriquez ""Counselor and lover of life""","[2, 5]","It is impossible for a film to follow Jaws and maintain the grip it had on the audience, but this film does stand up on it's own.  The story follows the original family and their struggle against the Amity community.  It does a wonderful job with character and story development, but the action here focuses on the teen culture on Amity.  The actresses playing Tina &amp; Jackie are the best scream queens I have ever seen!  I have never seen terror portrayed with such intsense and convincing emotion.  The teens have so much fun in the film, are adequately developed and distinguishable, and the action sequences are incredible.  This film has terror, story, and action wrapped together beautifully.  From the moment the boats collide to the &quot;Raft of Medusa&quot; moment, the heroic rescue of little John by his &quot;baby-sitter&quot;, and the final shark attack.  You'll be on the edge of your seat.The DVD includes a great hour long featurette on the making of the film covering everything from the different pitches by various writers to capturing the film's final moment.  This is not one of those 15 minute featurettes that serves nothing more than a trailer.  It is great to learn about the trials and tribulations of making a sequel, plus a director's commitment to character and plot development.  Deleted scenes include an incredible sequence with the helicopter pilot struggling underwater!  If you loved the first film, don't let this pass you by.

200804,A319SKSB556033,6300182177,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 4]","In the wake of Steven Spielberg's original game-changer there came many, many imitators, most of which were so lazy that they were just named after whatever leviathan might be eating people on that occasion (Orca, Piranha, Great White, Alligator) and they were all absolute garbage (although Orca does have some decent melancholic pathos). Jaws 2 seems to have been degraded by the flurry of imitators, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's actually quite good.Three years after Martin Brody destroyed the original shark another (with a rather cool Phantom of the Opera burn across its 'face') has come to Amity Island and is gobbling-up the locals. No one wants to listen to Brody's suspicions, leaving him to deal with it all on his own. His two sons, meanwhile, go out sailing with a bunch of friends and are terrorized by the shark when it paralyzes their flotilla.Many critics have compared Jaws to a teenage slasher movie, which I think is unfair. That particular sub-genre didn't really take-off until the release of Halloween, which came out 4 months later. Plus the teenagers in this movie are actually likable and have decent characterization. Even the stuck-up Mayor's son is good character. In a modern movie he'd die horribly as creating unlikable fodder is a common way for lazy writers to encourage blood-lust in the audience.However, the movie is very, very short on blood, which is one of its biggest faults. These shark attacks are far too clean and sterile. The first movie had way more, why not this one? Jeannot Szwarc is no Steven Spielberg, and struggles to build tension and suspense. His effort is ""not bad"", especially during early scenes such as the dead whale, and body in the surf, but the poor editing of the action scenes suggests he couldn't capture much on camera and left it to the editors (Verna Fields did not touch this film) to put it together any way they could. Brody is somewhat demoted to a sideshow character in the second half as the teenagers shout and scream at the circling dorsal fin. A better balance of scenes could have been found here.John Williams' score is a step-down from the first, though still a good score in its own right. It's just a pity that the movie has only ever been released in Mono as the music could use a decent, spacious remastering.I feel that if a different, more prominent and skilled 70s director had taken control of Jaws 2 (such as John Frankenheimer or William Friedkin) then we might have ended up with a tighter, more exciting film. As it is, Jaws 2 is merely a respectable sequel before the excruciating awfulness of the further two that followed.The DVD looks horrible and the film needs a strong remastering. The sound is in Mono only, but there are a few decent extras. Universal should put this out on Blu-ray, but they need to do some work on it first.",4,The ONLY decent Jaws sequel,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2845,"['wake', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'original', 'game-changer', 'came', 'many', 'many', 'imitators', 'most', 'were', 'so', 'lazy', 'were', 'just', 'named', 'leviathan', 'might', 'be', 'eating', 'people', 'occasion', 'Orca', 'Piranha', 'Great', 'White', 'Alligator', 'were', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'Orca', 'have', 'decent', 'melancholic', 'pathos', '2', 'have', 'been', 'degraded', 'flurry', 'imitators', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good.Three', 'years', 'Martin', 'Brody', 'destroyed', 'original', 'shark', 'rather', 'cool', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'burn', ""'face"", 'come', 'Amity', 'Island', 'gobbling-up', 'locals', 'one', 'listen', 'Brody', 'suspicions', 'leaving', 'deal', 'own', 'two', 'sons', 'meanwhile', 'go', 'out', 'sailing', 'bunch', 'friends', 'are', 'terrorized', 'shark', 'when', 'flotilla.Many', 'critics', 'have', 'compared', 'Jaws', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'movie', 'think', 'unfair', 'particular', 'sub-genre', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'take-off', 'release', 'Halloween', 'came', 'out', '4', 'months', 'later', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'are', 'actually', 'likable', 'have', 'decent', 'characterization', 'Even', 'stuck-up', 'Mayor', 'son', 'good', 'character', 'modern', 'movie', ""'d"", 'die', 'horribly', 'creating', 'unlikable', 'fodder', 'common', 'way', 'lazy', 'writers', 'encourage', 'blood-lust', 'audience.However', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'blood', 'one', 'biggest', 'faults', 'shark', 'attacks', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'clean', 'sterile', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'way', 'more', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'build', 'tension', 'suspense', 'effort', 'not', 'bad', 'especially', 'early', 'scenes', 'such', 'dead', 'whale', 'body', 'surf', 'poor', 'editing', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'much', 'camera', 'left', 'editors', 'Verna', 'Fields', 'did', 'not', 'touch', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'could', 'Brody', 'somewhat', 'demoted', 'sideshow', 'character', 'second', 'half', 'teenagers', 'shout', 'scream', 'circling', 'dorsal', 'fin', 'better', 'balance', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'here.John', 'Williams', 'score', 'step-down', 'first', 'though', 'still', 'good', 'score', 'own', 'right', 'just', 'pity', 'movie', 'only', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'Mono', 'music', 'could', 'use', 'decent', 'spacious', 'remastering.I', 'feel', 'different', 'more', 'prominent', 'skilled', '70s', 'director', 'had', 'taken', 'control', 'Jaws', '2', 'such', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'tighter', 'more', 'exciting', 'film', 'Jaws', '2', 'merely', 'respectable', 'sequel', 'excruciating', 'awfulness', 'further', 'two', 'followed.The', 'DVD', 'horrible', 'film', 'strong', 'remastering', 'sound', 'Mono', 'only', 'are', 'few', 'decent', 'extras', 'Universal', 'should', 'put', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'need', 'do', 'work', 'first']",N/A

200810,AJ4CR2LM73UCK,6300182177,"J. COSBY ""ZePequeno""","[1, 1]","No possible way to be better than the original.  No way.  Because the original was basically a creative and productive fluke that became a staple suspense classic due to primarily two things: Spielberg's amibitious direction and Verna Fields' FLAWLESS editing.  (She won that Oscar for a damn good reason.)  ""Jaws"" was nothing but mistakes, but Verna Fields' editing covered up every single one.  It's basically a miracle of filmmaking, now how can you surpass a miracle?""Jaws 2"" does one thing EXTREMELY right: it spends time analyzing the trauma resulting from shark attacks, or people that have witnessed them.  One of my favorite parts of this sequel is when Brody and some men rescue that girl whose boyfriend got eaten the day before.  She was cowering under the rim of the boat the entire night, muttering incoherently, and nearly catatonic from primal fear.  I didn't think a sequel to ""Jaws"" could invoke something so relatable.  That right there gets my props.The Editorial Review for this is too mean-spirited.  It ain't necessarily wrong, but it just focuses on the superficial negatives.  Watch the film, and a real story does emerge.  Chief Brody, forever scarred by his aquatic showdown with Bruce, acts somewhat rash and a little obsessive, but can any one of us blame him?  Spielberg put this guy through a wet Hell three years prior (see review title).I'll just say some things I enjoyed about it.  It's the only sequel that comes closest to reflecting the visual cadence of the original.  Contrary to the above, it does have a nice style, and the photography might be the prettiest you get in the entire franchise.  Why does a ""Jaws"" movie look so pretty?  It is directed by a Frenchman, after all.  Apparently, Jeannot Szwarc knew Zanuck and Brown by directing episodes of ""Night Gallery"" like Spielberg did, too.  He pulls off some gorgeous and difficult shots in this film.  (Keep an eye on the shark's POV of the waterskier -- it ain't miniature, it's full-scale live.)  Surprisingly, the gore is considerably less than the original, which is basically a bloody mess of a film if you think about it.  There is some nasty violence in it though: the attack on the boyfriend I mentioned before, and the girl that gets swallowed whole near the end.Look, just have fun with the helicopter attack and the manic girl that won't stop screaming at the end.  Love the shark the filmmakers nicknamed ""Scarface"" and the fact that he can survive an explosion being only inches away from it.  But best of all, enjoy Roy Scheider giving his wife's boss some come-uppance with a parking ticket.  ""Jane Eyre"" this film is not.Overall, check this out, it's not a waste at all.  I watched this with my sister, a marine biologist, which is a novel way to view something like this.  She can attest to some facts about the beached killer whale, but great whites just don't get as big as Shamu.  It's fun to imagine if they did.Ironically, perhaps the best piece of the DVD is the Behind The Scenes Making Of Feature.  It is thorough, comprehensive, informative, and engaging as hell.  AT LEAST as good as the ""Jaws"" Behind The Scenes with Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss, which was exceptional.  These ""Jaws"" crews know how to make something out of nothing, that's for sure.Not necessarily essential, but still recommended.",4,"""I don't intend to go through that hell again!""",1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3323,"['possible', 'way', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'way', 'original', 'was', 'basically', 'creative', 'productive', 'fluke', 'became', 'staple', 'suspense', 'classic', 'due', 'primarily', 'two', 'things', 'Spielberg', 'amibitious', 'direction', 'Verna', 'Fields', 'FLAWLESS', 'editing', 'won', 'Oscar', 'damn', 'good', 'reason', 'Jaws', 'was', 'nothing', 'mistakes', 'Verna', 'Fields', 'editing', 'covered', 'up', 'single', 'one', 'basically', 'miracle', 'filmmaking', 'now', 'how', 'can', 'surpass', 'miracle', 'Jaws', '2', 'one', 'thing', 'EXTREMELY', 'right', 'time', 'analyzing', 'trauma', 'resulting', 'shark', 'attacks', 'people', 'have', 'witnessed', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'sequel', 'when', 'Brody', 'men', 'rescue', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'got', 'eaten', 'day', 'was', 'cowering', 'rim', 'boat', 'entire', 'night', 'muttering', 'incoherently', 'nearly', 'catatonic', 'primal', 'fear', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'sequel', 'Jaws', 'could', 'invoke', 'something', 'so', 'relatable', 'right', 'there', 'props.The', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'too', 'mean-spirited', 'ai', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'wrong', 'just', 'superficial', 'negatives', 'Watch', 'film', 'real', 'story', 'emerge', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'forever', 'scarred', 'aquatic', 'showdown', 'Bruce', 'somewhat', 'rash', 'little', 'obsessive', 'can', 'one', 'blame', 'Spielberg', 'put', 'guy', 'wet', 'Hell', 'three', 'years', 'prior', 'see', 'review', 'title', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'sequel', 'closest', 'reflecting', 'visual', 'cadence', 'original', 'Contrary', 'above', 'have', 'nice', 'style', 'photography', 'might', 'be', 'prettiest', 'get', 'entire', 'franchise', 'Why', 'Jaws', 'movie', 'look', 'pretty', 'directed', 'Frenchman', 'Apparently', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'knew', 'Zanuck', 'Brown', 'directing', 'episodes', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'too', 'gorgeous', 'difficult', 'shots', 'film', 'Keep', 'eye', 'shark', 'POV', 'waterskier', 'ai', ""n't"", 'miniature', 'full-scale', 'live', 'Surprisingly', 'gore', 'considerably', 'less', 'original', 'basically', 'bloody', 'mess', 'film', 'think', 'nasty', 'violence', 'attack', 'boyfriend', 'mentioned', 'girl', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'end.Look', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'helicopter', 'attack', 'manic', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'screaming', 'end', 'Love', 'shark', 'filmmakers', 'nicknamed', 'Scarface', 'fact', 'can', 'survive', 'explosion', 'being', 'only', 'inches', 'away', 'best', 'enjoy', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'giving', 'wife', 'come-uppance', 'parking', 'ticket', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'film', 'not.Overall', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'waste', 'watched', 'sister', 'marine', 'biologist', 'novel', 'way', 'view', 'something', 'can', 'attest', 'facts', 'beached', 'killer', 'whale', 'great', 'whites', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'big', 'Shamu', 'fun', 'imagine', 'did.Ironically', 'perhaps', 'best', 'piece', 'DVD', 'Scenes', 'Making', 'Feature', 'thorough', 'comprehensive', 'informative', 'engaging', 'as', 'hell', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'as', 'good', 'Jaws', 'Scenes', 'Spielberg', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'was', 'exceptional', 'Jaws', 'crews', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'something', 'nothing', 'sure.Not', 'necessarily', 'essential', 'still', 'recommended']",N/A

Well, this sequel made quite a bit of money for the studio, however critics bashed it left and right.Let's look at the most obvious reason. Without Dreyfuss and Shaw, we are left with Schieder and a bunch of teenagers who are barely able to act (with the exception of Keith Gordon later of &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;).Next: the story. The town is still not capable of believing Schieder's shark alert after the events of the first film?  Also, there is a lot of unnecessary filler, like the dedication of the new hotel. The script also picks at Sheriff Brody, making him a drunk when he's under pressure.The saving grace of the film is the abundance of effects. The director wisely realized that since his actors are weak, he must shift focus onto the shark, which is seen a lot more in part 2. The shark is scarred by a fire early on in the film. It's as if producers wanted us to know this is a different shark than the one used in the first film.The film is basically geared toward a younger audience.

200819,AR2JF8MCZ54JM,6300182177,Joshua Chipman,"[43, 46]","To believe that any effort to make a 'Jaws' sequel could compare with the impact of Steven Spielberg's original was a doomed notion even in 1978: the original was and is a cinematic classic of the highest order (despite having spent much of the '90s in almost-infinite rerun on the Turner networks), so much so that no sequel would ever have been able to measure up to its legacy. What happened basically is this: Universal execs saw the budget and schedule for 'Jaws' balloon so badly because of all its production troubles that they told Spielberg he'd never work in Hollywood again, UNTIL the movie was released and broke every box-office record imaginable.  As they are wont to do in the face of staggering profit, these moneymongers quickly turned keel and told Spielberg they were behind him 100 percent the whole time and they wanted to know when he was planning to start shooting 'Jaws 2'.  Spielberg, being smart, said 'No thanks', so the execs decided to go ahead with 'Jaws 2' without him.  BIG mistake.Thankfully, though, producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown remained in charge of things, and got the highly-underrated director Jeannot Szwarc to try to pick up the pieces, even going so far as to re-enlist the incomparable John Williams to score the film.  The end result is a sequel that is essentially the 'Jurassic Park 2' of its day - critically landblasted, commercially eschewed, yet despite its dramatic idiosyncracies and the impossibility of competing with the original film, proves to be an entertaining follow-up nonetheless.Much of the original cast returns, save Richard Dreyfuss (who, like Spielberg, was smart enough to know when to pass) and Robert Shaw (who, apart from his character being killed in the original, had himself died of a heart attack in 1978).  But Roy Scheider's return is the saving grace here, as now he's given new dimensions to his character: his growing spite toward his wife's boss, his desperation in trying to prove that a new shark has arrived despite a more skeptical public this time around (since sharks rarely attack the same place twice, you can't really blame them). The acting remains solid in 'Jaws 2' - Murray Hamilton's character is a refreshing surprise, still just as disbelieving yet he can't help but be a little sympathetic for Brody this time - and remains that way even during the straining final hour of the film when Szwarc has to resort to the all-out terror of having the teenage daysailers menaced by the monolithic maneater.Then there's the whole aspect of the shark itself.  Since there's only so many times you can have a different giant shark attack the same island, the movie stretches its premise to the maximum level of plausibility.  The shark's feats this time around are, to say the least, improbable - outrunning a speedboat and being able to sink a mini-copter, in particular - but Szwarc captures them on film quite well, and their absurdity pales in comparison to what we get in the last two entries in the series.  And Szwarc and screenwriters Carl Gottlieb (returning from the original) and Howard Sackler (who contributed to the original but turned down screen credit) send their shark out in a death scene that has much more panache than the 'shoot-the-scuba-tank-stuck-in-its-mouth' gag.'Jaws 2' has its bland and silly moments, but if you loved the suspense of the original, then this entry in the series is about the only follow-up that you might find truly worth your time and money.",4,"No Masterpiece, But Still Worthwhile...",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,3486,"['believe', 'effort', 'make', ""'Jaws"", 'sequel', 'could', 'compare', 'impact', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'original', 'was', 'doomed', 'notion', 'even', '1978', 'original', 'was', 'cinematic', 'classic', 'highest', 'order', 'having', 'spent', 'much', ""'90s"", 'almost-infinite', 'rerun', 'Turner', 'networks', 'so', 'much', 'sequel', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'measure', 'up', 'legacy', 'What', 'happened', 'basically', 'Universal', 'saw', 'budget', 'schedule', ""'Jaws"", 'balloon', 'so', 'badly', 'production', 'troubles', 'told', 'Spielberg', ""'d"", 'never', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'broke', 'box-office', 'record', 'imaginable', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'face', 'staggering', 'profit', 'moneymongers', 'quickly', 'turned', 'keel', 'told', 'Spielberg', 'were', '100', 'percent', 'whole', 'time', 'wanted', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'planning', 'start', 'shooting', ""'Jaws"", '2', 'Spielberg', 'being', 'smart', 'said', ""'No"", 'thanks', 'execs', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', ""'Jaws"", '2', 'BIG', 'mistake.Thankfully', 'producers', 'Richard', 'Zanuck', 'David', 'Brown', 'remained', 'charge', 'things', 'got', 'highly-underrated', 'director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 're-enlist', 'incomparable', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'film', 'end', 'result', 'sequel', 'essentially', ""'Jurassic"", 'Park', '2', 'day', 'critically', 'landblasted', 'commercially', 'eschewed', 'yet', 'dramatic', 'idiosyncracies', 'impossibility', 'competing', 'original', 'film', 'be', 'entertaining', 'follow-up', 'nonetheless.Much', 'original', 'cast', 'returns', 'save', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'when', 'pass', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'who', 'apart', 'character', 'being', 'killed', 'original', 'had', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', '1978', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'return', 'saving', 'grace', 'here', 'now', 'given', 'new', 'dimensions', 'character', 'growing', 'spite', 'wife', 'boss', 'desperation', 'trying', 'prove', 'new', 'shark', 'arrived', 'more', 'skeptical', 'public', 'time', 'sharks', 'rarely', 'attack', 'same', 'place', 'twice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'acting', 'solid', '2', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'character', 'refreshing', 'surprise', 'still', 'just', 'disbelieving', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'little', 'sympathetic', 'Brody', 'time', 'way', 'even', 'straining', 'final', 'hour', 'film', 'when', 'Szwarc', 'resort', 'all-out', 'terror', 'having', 'teenage', 'daysailers', 'menaced', 'monolithic', 'maneater.Then', 'whole', 'aspect', 'shark', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'have', 'different', 'giant', 'shark', 'attack', 'same', 'island', 'movie', 'premise', 'maximum', 'level', 'plausibility', 'shark', 'feats', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'say', 'least', 'improbable', 'outrunning', 'speedboat', 'being', 'able', 'sink', 'mini-copter', 'particular', 'Szwarc', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'absurdity', 'pales', 'comparison', 'what', 'get', 'last', 'two', 'entries', 'series', 'Szwarc', 'screenwriters', 'Carl', 'Gottlieb', 'returning', 'original', 'Howard', 'Sackler', 'who', 'contributed', 'original', 'turned', 'down', 'screen', 'credit', 'send', 'shark', 'death', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'panache', ""'shoot-the-scuba-tank-stuck-in-its-mouth"", 'gag', '2', 'bland', 'silly', 'moments', 'loved', 'suspense', 'original', 'then', 'entry', 'series', 'only', 'follow-up', 'might', 'find', 'truly', 'time', 'money']",N/A

The summer resort island of Amity is once again facing a  threat from a great white shark.  After several mysterious deaths Brody is  convinced that a another shark is lurking in the waters. The Mayor and town  council think otherwise. Brody's two sons and a large group of their  friends take off in their sailboats and big trouble ensues. Acting alone,  it's up to Brody to come to the rescue.While lacking the intial shock  and surprise Jaws generated, this sequel manages to capture a couple of  nice surprises. The film's big climax is geniunely exciting. Roy Scheider  delivers a first rate performance. The young cast does fine as the periled  day sailors. John William's score is simply terrific and in some ways  better than than his music for the original.

When I came to the US, JAWS 2 came out and it is the first movie I have seen in a US theater. I must have been eight at the time. I had a great time watching it.When they re-released JAWS, I saw that too....and was so traumatized by the movie that I couldn't bear to sit through a second viewing as my sister wanted to. Then I realized how weak the sequel is.Of course, JAWS 2 pale in comparison to its predecessor. Took place several years after the first one, this time another great white moves in on Amity...except that the wrinkle this time is that only Chief Brody is convinced that another shark is out there while everybody thinks it's business as usual.Well, it IS business as usual as the shark does its work in total secrecy.Director Jeannot Szwarc did an excellent job in re-capturing the look, atmosphere and feel of the town of Amity from the first movie. The storyline itself is adequate. However, what the movie suffers most is the PACING. There is a long gap between the attack on the water skier and then to Tina's boyfriend....and what is in between? A whale carcass, a burnt body in the surf, a massive panic on the beach, Brody getting fired and so on. And more than once I was yawning from boredom. Get to the chompin already!Even when the shark do attack, it is not as graphic or shocking as the first movie. Who can forget Susan Backlinie from JAWS? She became the most famous shark victim in movie history. In JAWS 2, the only memorable attack was the water skier (hence the movie poster)...but that happened way too quick...as in all the other attacks.Aside from that, the movie is well acted, espcially from the reliable Roy Schieder and Lorraine Gary, also the distaff members of the teen group victimized by the Great White: Ann Dusenberry, Gigi Vorgan, Martha Swatek, Cynthia Grover, and who can forget, Donna Wilkes and her now famous display of hyper hysterics.John Williams lend more of his talent to the movie and composed a score which equal in scope to the original.It is also interesting that a deleted scene found on the DVD...in which we see the shark attacks the helicopter pilot underwater, is restored on TV broadcasts.Overall, JAWS 2 is a still a worthy sequel to the first one, despite the fact that it suffers from a host of pre-production problems from changing directors to constant re-writes. It is a wonder a coherent movie came out at all.The two movies that came after JAWS 2....Jaws 3-D, and Jaws: The Revenge...it is best they be deposited in the stomach of a real great white.",3,Sequel Lacked Bite.....but still a good effort,999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,2606,"['When', 'JAWS', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'When', 'came', 'US', 'JAWS', '2', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'US', 'theater', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'eight', 'time', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'it.When', 're-released', 'JAWS', 'saw', 'too', '.and', 'was', 'so', 'traumatized', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'sit', 'second', 'viewing', 'sister', 'wanted', 'Then', 'realized', 'how', 'weak', 'sequel', 'is.Of', 'course', 'JAWS', '2', 'pale', 'comparison', 'predecessor', 'Took', 'place', 'several', 'years', 'first', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'white', 'moves', 'Amity', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'only', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'convinced', 'shark', 'out', 'there', 'everybody', 'business', 'usual.Well', 'business', 'as', 'usual', 'shark', 'work', 'total', 'secrecy.Director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 're-capturing', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'feel', 'town', 'Amity', 'first', 'movie', 'storyline', 'adequate', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'suffers', 'most', 'PACING', 'long', 'gap', 'attack', 'water', 'skier', 'then', 'Tina', 'boyfriend', '.and', 'what', 'whale', 'carcass', 'burnt', 'body', 'surf', 'massive', 'panic', 'beach', 'Brody', 'getting', 'fired', 'so', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'yawning', 'boredom', 'Get', 'chompin', 'already', 'Even', 'when', 'shark', 'do', 'attack', 'not', 'graphic', 'shocking', 'first', 'movie', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Susan', 'Backlinie', 'JAWS', 'became', 'most', 'famous', 'shark', 'victim', 'movie', 'history', 'JAWS', '2', 'only', 'memorable', 'attack', 'was', 'water', 'skier', 'hence', 'movie', 'poster', 'happened', 'way', 'too', 'quick', 'other', 'attacks.Aside', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'espcially', 'reliable', 'Roy', 'Schieder', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'also', 'distaff', 'members', 'teen', 'group', 'victimized', 'Great', 'White', 'Ann', 'Dusenberry', 'Gigi', 'Vorgan', 'Martha', 'Swatek', 'Cynthia', 'Grover', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Donna', 'Wilkes', 'now', 'famous', 'display', 'hyper', 'hysterics.John', 'Williams', 'lend', 'more', 'talent', 'movie', 'composed', 'score', 'equal', 'scope', 'original.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scene', 'found', 'DVD', 'see', 'shark', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'underwater', 'restored', 'TV', 'broadcasts.Overall', 'JAWS', '2', 'still', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'first', 'one', 'fact', 'host', 'pre-production', 'problems', 'changing', 'directors', 'constant', 're-writes', 'wonder', 'coherent', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'all.The', 'two', 'movies', 'came', 'JAWS', '2', '.Jaws', '3-D', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'best', 'be', 'deposited', 'stomach', 'real', 'great', 'white']",N/A

The huge profits of the novel by Peter Benchley and the even greater success of the filmed version guaranteed a celluloid sequel.  Spielberg decided to bow out as director as did Dreyfus as the icthyologist Matt Hooper.  Shaw's character was gobbled up so that left only Scheider and the shark to carry the film in a dramatic sense.  Scheider tries mightily as does Bruce the shark, but the lack of Dreyfus and Shaw does not permit Scheider to do more than to complain loudly that a man eating shark is back in the waters off Amity.  Perhaps if new director Jeannot Scwarc had tried to do more than just reshoot a plot that resonated in the original but fizzled in the sequel, then JAWS 2 might have had more going for it than watching an aquatic version of a teen slasher flick.  The only way JAWS 2 might have been significantly different would have involved more human interest and less focus on shark canines.  The problem with the sequel of any hit film is to recapture the freshness of the original, or if failing that, to stake out and create a new sense of dramatic interest.  In THE GODFATHER 2, director Coppola moved back in time to fill in the blanks of young Vito Coreleone's life.  In ALIENS 2, director James Cameron humanized the alien by giving it maternal instincts.  Nothing of the sort was done here.  The shark was presented in both films as a feeding machine.

""Jaws 2"" is a well above average sequel that actually manages to be quite different when compared to its predecessor instead of just being a re-hash.This one is basically about a group of teenage friends who deside to form a great katamaran caravan and attempt to sail from one part of Amity Island to another.  Along the way, though, they encounter a monstrous Great White Shark who decides to try and make a floating smorgasboard out of them.  When Sheriff Brody (portrayed excellently again by Roy Scheider) learns that his two sons, Mike and Sean, are with the group of teens, he immediately heads out to rescue them, having suspected that another killer shark had been frequenting the warm island waters through out the entire film.  Eventually, Brody catches up with the surviving teens and brings yet another shark to an explosive and rather ""electrifying"" conclusion.Featuring another fine musical score by renowned composer John Williams, and an excellent cast comprised primarily by returning members from the first film, ""Jaws 2"" is a very good movie in its own right that should not be found missing from anyone's video collection.  Actually I recommend buying all four ""Jaws"" films.  The best is ""Jaws III"", followed very closely by the original and then ""Jaws 2"".  ""Jaws: The Revenge"", the fourth film in the series, although not nearly as good as the other three, still manages to be a fairly entertaining (though not entirely plausible) sequel.The problem with this edition isn't the movie at all.  ""Jaws 2"" as far as sequels go is actually a very good and entertaining film.The problem is the extra features added at the end of the video, which consist of a 10+ minute ""making of"" featurette containing a very brief commentary on the making of the film, a partial theatrical trailer, interviews with some of the cast and crew, and a couple (very short - about 5 seconds each) deleted scenes.  Big Deal.I don't know why Universal chose to do a single tape special edition of this well above average film.  Why they didn't do a two tape special edition as they did with both ""Jurassic Park"" films and the original ""Jaws"" is entirely beyond me.  I guess that Universal, as with every other movie company out there now, is trying extremely hard to push their DVDs (which almost always have a ton of extras on them, while the video versions come with next to none or no features at all) and seem to think that everyone out there prefers DVD to Video.At any rate if you don't have this video in your collection yet, but want to own it, go ahead and get this edition.  However, if you still have the previous edition and are questioning yourself as to whether or not it's worth ""getting"" this ""special"" edition, I would suggest just sticking with the copy you have.Again the extra features on this edition are only o.k. at best.  I just hope that Universal does a better job with its upcoming video re-release of ""Halloween II"", even though I've read that they're now planning on releasing that one as just the movie itself without making it a special edition as originally announced.I once had a lot of faith in Universal as far as the releasing of most of their videos went, but that faith is quickly diminishing.",3,"Good Sequel, Not So ""Special"" Edition.",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,3289,"['Just', 'When', 'Thought', 'Was', 'Save', 'Go', 'Back', 'Water', 'Jaws', '2', 'well', 'average', 'sequel', 'actually', 'be', 'quite', 'different', 'when', 'compared', 'predecessor', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 're-hash.This', 'one', 'basically', 'group', 'teenage', 'friends', 'who', 'deside', 'form', 'great', 'katamaran', 'caravan', 'attempt', 'sail', 'one', 'part', 'Amity', 'Island', 'way', 'though', 'encounter', 'monstrous', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'who', 'try', 'make', 'floating', 'smorgasboard', 'When', 'Sheriff', 'Brody', 'portrayed', 'excellently', 'again', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'two', 'sons', 'Mike', 'Sean', 'are', 'group', 'teens', 'immediately', 'out', 'rescue', 'having', 'suspected', 'killer', 'shark', 'had', 'been', 'frequenting', 'warm', 'island', 'waters', 'entire', 'film', 'Eventually', 'Brody', 'up', 'surviving', 'teens', 'yet', 'shark', 'explosive', 'rather', 'electrifying', 'conclusion.Featuring', 'fine', 'musical', 'score', 'renowned', 'composer', 'John', 'Williams', 'excellent', 'cast', 'comprised', 'primarily', 'returning', 'members', 'first', 'film', 'Jaws', '2', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'missing', 'anyone', 'video', 'collection', 'Actually', 'recommend', 'buying', 'four', 'Jaws', 'films', 'best', 'Jaws', 'III', 'followed', 'very', 'closely', 'original', 'then', 'Jaws', '2', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'three', 'still', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'not', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'sequel.The', 'problem', 'edition', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Jaws', '2', 'as', 'far', 'sequels', 'go', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'film.The', 'problem', 'extra', 'features', 'added', 'end', 'video', 'consist', '10+', 'minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'containing', 'very', 'brief', 'commentary', 'making', 'film', 'partial', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'couple', 'very', 'short', '5', 'seconds', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Big', 'Deal.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Universal', 'chose', 'do', 'single', 'tape', 'special', 'edition', 'well', 'average', 'film', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'two', 'tape', 'special', 'edition', 'did', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'films', 'original', 'Jaws', 'entirely', 'guess', 'Universal', 'other', 'movie', 'company', 'there', 'now', 'trying', 'extremely', 'hard', 'push', 'DVDs', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'ton', 'extras', 'video', 'versions', 'come', 'next', 'none', 'features', 'seem', 'think', 'everyone', 'prefers', 'DVD', 'Video.At', 'rate', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'video', 'collection', 'yet', 'want', 'own', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'edition', 'However', 'still', 'have', 'previous', 'edition', 'are', 'questioning', 'not', 'worth', 'getting', 'special', 'edition', 'would', 'suggest', 'just', 'sticking', 'copy', 'have.Again', 'extra', 'features', 'edition', 'are', 'only', 'o.k', 'best', 'just', 'hope', 'Universal', 'better', 'job', 'upcoming', 'video', 're-release', 'Halloween', 'II', 'even', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'re"", 'now', 'planning', 'releasing', 'one', 'as', 'just', 'movie', 'making', 'special', 'edition', 'originally', 'once', 'had', 'lot', 'faith', 'Universal', 'as', 'far', 'releasing', 'most', 'videos', 'went', 'faith', 'quickly', 'diminishing']",N/A

Three years later (and still I wasn't around) a second shark came back to make sure we didn't dip a toe in the ocean.Thirty plus years on from the first movie, it makes me terrified to even think about going near the ocean. (And I like beach holidays.) Jaws 2, not the best movie to watch on a bright sunny day, but it certainly passed the time. I did feel that it could have been edited slightly better, even by 10 minutes, cos it did seem to drag between killings, and shark sightings.The great thing about Jaws 2 is that some of the original cast come back. I don't think it would have worked without Roy Schneider personally. He made the first movie for me, and he was even better in the second movie.You know the storyline. A shark is back in the waters surrounding Amity Island, looking for meat, human meat is its favourite. The deaths start happening, people start mysteriously disappearing, a killer whale is washed up on the beach with huge bites taken out of it, and it's up to Brody to convince everyone that the shark is back. Bigger and better than ever.Despite its length, and the fact you saw more of the shark this time, for me it was definitely scarier. The shark gets burnt early on in the movie, and it gives it a whole new look. Definitely scared the bejeezus out of me. The film doesn't really hit its peak until the last 35 minutes, when I was holding my breath, and trying not to look away from the screen.I won't reveal too much more about the movie, you have to see it. After this, I hear the sequels got downright awful, so I think this will be the last of my Jaws reviews! They sound awful. But I do think my mum has all of them. Shocking.

200848,A1SMWZVAKDPZU7,6300182177,"Michael D. Kuhlman ""koolman""","[0, 0]","There are some genuinely terrifying scares in this movie, some really creative camera setups (the camera on the shark's back is brilliant, a different view than we saw in the first Jaws), inventive shark attacks and action set-pieces (I'd put everything director Jeanot Zwarc did right up there with anything Spielberg did in the original Jaws), and an underlying tension that builds and never lets up!  The three leads from the first film (Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton), as well as Brody's sons and a bunch of their teenaged friends stuck on their tiny Catamaran sailboats with the marauding shark cruising around them looking for its next meal, serve up credible and believable performances within the confines of Carl Gottlieb's by-necessity rushed script re-write.  We really feel the kids' fear, and their pain, in losing their loved ones.Jaws 2 is scarier than the first Jaws, because, in the first Jaws, despite Quint's best effort to sabotage it, at least the guys were on a boat that had a MOTOR, so they could propel themselves out of there!  In Jaws 2, on their tiny Catamarans, some of which get capsized and destroyed, the kids are totally vulnerable, exposed, at the shark's mercy!That said, the only down-shot of this movie, aside from a plot that I, if I wrote the screenplay, would have stationed in a completely different part of the United States, with a completely different species of shark (Bull, Mako, Tiger, etc.) and a completely different cast, with Brody called in as a ""consultant"", is the shark itself:  It looks fake.  Even in the first Jaws, the filmmakers created a foam rubber mold for the shark that was ""stylized"" from what a real Great White shark looks like.  The first time around, for the most part, it worked, because the shark didn't show its ugly head until 2/3 of the way through the movie, behind Brody as he is chucking chum into the water.  In this film, the shark's ugly head is seen almost from the get-go, from the first attack on the poor hapless driver of the boat who is attempting to see what happened to her water-skier friend she was towing who was eaten, to the end.  This would be OK, if the shark looked real.  Since it doesn't, seems director Zwarc didn't follow Spielberg's mantra of ""what you don't see is scarier"" that worked so well in the first film.For a film with the word ""Jaws"" in it, you'd think more care would have been taken in the creation of the jaws, the mandibles themselves, in the foam rubber mold, to make the jaws of the mechanical shark look like the jaws of a real Great White shark.  In the first Jaws, at least they got the TEETH right.  In Jaws 2, the shark looks like it went to the dentist to get its teeth cleaned, was handed a clean bill of health and a tube of Colgate toothpaste with MFP Fluoride and teeth-whitening gel, told by the dentist to keep up the good work!  The shark's dentes look immaculate, pearly white.  I know this is a ""movie shark"", but c'mon, guys.One wonders why, when given such great real archival footage shot by Ron and Valerie Taylor, Australian divers who filmed footage of real Great Whites that was used for both Jaws and Jaws 2, as well as the numerous photographs of real Great Whites in books and research of the time, Roy Arbogast, who designed the shark this time, and Joe Alves, production designer who helped design the mechanical shark for the original Jaws, and who here serves as production designer and associate producer, didn't take more time prior to production to perfect the LOOK of the MOLD of the mechanical shark!  Given the phenomenal success of the original Jaws, surely there was more than ample time (and money) between 1975 and 1978 to perfect the design, and they KNEW there was going to be a sequel right after Jaws shattered box office records in 1975, so they could've gotten right to work on creating a shark that was far superior to the original.The mechanical shark does MOVE better in this film, than in the first film, thanks to the guys perfecting the armature of the underwater mechanism, and the pneumatics, to work better in the open ocean.  Maybe that's where all their R & D went, and the LOOK of the mold was considered ""fluffy"", ""superfluous"", an afterthought.To give both Alves and Arbogast credit, both really talented guys, they WERE embroiled in the creation of sets and FX for Spielberg's next film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, at the time, between 1976 and 1978, so they only had a limited amount of time to scramble to create a working series of mechanical sharks for this film between Close Encounters' release in 1977 and 1978, the release of Jaws 2.(sigh)  Well, Jaws 2 IS a Hollywood movie, not a National Geographic documentary.  If you can ignore the fake-looking shark, which kinda undermines the direction, ingenious camerawork and acting performances, which are quite good, you're in for some genuinely primordially exciting good scares, fun in the summer sun!

200853,A1E15WYG9C47X1,6300182177,"""mobby_uk""","[1, 1]","As far as sequels are concerned, Jaws 2 is not a bad follow-up to one of the greatest films ever made.The producers of course must have faced a near impossible task to do another segment of an all time classic, for while a sequel was inevitable due to the huge returns that Jaws brought in, the shape, development and style of the film had to be faithful to the original in varying degrees to ensure another commercial and artistic success on their hands and not just a lame imitation.And surely they have had their share of difficulties with the sacking of the first director assigned to the task John Hancock, bringing in Frenchman Jeannot Szwarc,doing several rewrites, facing very harsh filming condition, before the final product hit the big screens.And to be fair Jaws 2 has a lot going for it,Firstly,hiring the same writers, production team,and keeping most of the old characters from the first film ensured familiarity to the viewer.Casting Roy Scheider again as chief Brody and Lorraine Gary as his wife, in addition to Murray Hamilton as Mayor Vaughn, the story of Jaws 2 was in a way a continuation rather than an imitation of the first film , and this alone guarantees a certain appeal.The acting in Jaws 2, especially from Scheider is way above average,and the excellent scene when Brody is sacked and comes back to the arms of his comforting wife, is a short but valuable distraction into family drama territory.Secondly, Jeannot Szwarc is an able director,who now concentrates on TV work( directing episodes of Ally Mc Beal and CIS Miami) but who has had good films to his name, most notably the underrated spy thriller Enigma and the romantic weepie Somewhere in Time.While in Jaws, Quint's speech about the Indianapolis attacks was chilling and a classic, I felt that the last part of Jaws 2 with all the kids trapped in a sea of wreckage at the mercy of the shark was inspired directly by this incident.Thirdly, the DVD extras are brilliant! The making of segment is 44 minutes long!! and you get a good insight into the making of the film and the difficulties they faced, while the deleted scenes although just three, are very interesting. For instance we see what happened to the helicopter pilot under water! and the voting of the town's council that resulted in the sacking of Brody.Well of course Jaws 2 is not flawless, and what works against it in my opinion is the following,First the shark does look more mechanical than it did in the first film. The fact that the writers decided to burn half of the shark's head at the begining of the movie in its boat attack/accident, somehow accentuated the mechanical look of the animal. Morever,the use of real shark footage from the stock of Ron and Valerie Taylor was minimal and not as much as in Jaws, which would have brought more needed authenticity to the look of the shark.So Jaws 2 is a good follow up to Jaws, not as great as the first (no film in this genre will come close to that classic), but at least it is done with a lot of dedication from all involved, a movie that will still make you look at the ocean with a sense of trepidation and fear.",4,Worthy Sequel,1066694400,"10 21, 2003",2003,3127,"['As', 'far', 'sequels', 'are', 'concerned', 'Jaws', '2', 'not', 'bad', 'follow-up', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made.The', 'producers', 'course', 'must', 'have', 'faced', 'near', 'impossible', 'task', 'do', 'segment', 'time', 'classic', 'sequel', 'was', 'inevitable', 'due', 'huge', 'returns', 'Jaws', 'brought', 'shape', 'development', 'style', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'faithful', 'original', 'varying', 'degrees', 'ensure', 'commercial', 'artistic', 'success', 'hands', 'not', 'just', 'lame', 'imitation.And', 'surely', 'have', 'had', 'share', 'difficulties', 'sacking', 'first', 'director', 'assigned', 'task', 'John', 'Hancock', 'bringing', 'Frenchman', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'doing', 'several', 'rewrites', 'facing', 'very', 'harsh', 'filming', 'condition', 'final', 'product', 'hit', 'big', 'screens.And', 'be', 'fair', 'Jaws', '2', 'lot', 'going', 'Firstly', 'hiring', 'same', 'writers', 'production', 'team', 'keeping', 'most', 'old', 'characters', 'first', 'film', 'ensured', 'familiarity', 'viewer.Casting', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'again', 'chief', 'Brody', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'wife', 'addition', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Mayor', 'Vaughn', 'story', 'Jaws', '2', 'was', 'way', 'continuation', 'rather', 'imitation', 'first', 'film', 'alone', 'certain', 'appeal.The', 'acting', 'Jaws', '2', 'especially', 'Scheider', 'way', 'average', 'excellent', 'scene', 'when', 'Brody', 'sacked', 'back', 'arms', 'comforting', 'wife', 'short', 'valuable', 'distraction', 'family', 'drama', 'territory.Secondly', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'able', 'director', 'who', 'now', 'TV', 'work', 'directing', 'episodes', 'Ally', 'Mc', 'Beal', 'CIS', 'Miami', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'films', 'name', 'most', 'notably', 'underrated', 'spy', 'thriller', 'Enigma', 'romantic', 'weepie', 'Somewhere', 'Time.While', 'Jaws', 'Quint', 'speech', 'Indianapolis', 'attacks', 'was', 'chilling', 'classic', 'felt', 'last', 'part', 'Jaws', '2', 'kids', 'trapped', 'sea', 'wreckage', 'mercy', 'shark', 'was', 'inspired', 'directly', 'incident.Thirdly', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'brilliant', 'making', 'segment', '44', 'minutes', 'long', 'get', 'good', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'difficulties', 'faced', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'just', 'three', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'instance', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'water', 'voting', 'town', 'council', 'resulted', 'sacking', 'Brody.Well', 'course', 'Jaws', '2', 'not', 'flawless', 'what', 'opinion', 'following', 'First', 'shark', 'look', 'more', 'mechanical', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'fact', 'writers', 'decided', 'burn', 'half', 'shark', 'head', 'begining', 'movie', 'boat', 'attack/accident', 'somehow', 'accentuated', 'mechanical', 'look', 'animal', 'Morever', 'use', 'real', 'shark', 'footage', 'stock', 'Ron', 'Valerie', 'Taylor', 'was', 'minimal', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Jaws', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'needed', 'authenticity', 'look', 'shark.So', 'Jaws', '2', 'good', 'follow', 'up', 'Jaws', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'film', 'genre', 'will', 'come', 'close', 'classic', 'least', 'done', 'lot', 'dedication', 'involved', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'look', 'ocean', 'sense', 'trepidation', 'fear']",N/A

200861,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6300182177,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","It's hard to match such a big hit as Jaws but this sequel tries pretty damn hard. Not in the same class as it's predecessor but an entertaining shark show nevertheless.Roy Scheider returns as the white knight in the same role as before, but his kids have aged and entered that rebellious stage. His wife (Lorraine Gary) is entering some sort of political position and gets a stronger role although I preferred her more in the first as a background character. Brody again suspects a shark but the victims aren't as in your face as the first flicks and it's harder to prove. You would think people would believe him after the first incident but perhaps they think the poor chief's just been through too much. He no longer has the help he did in the original and now has to combat the beast alone when it threatens close to home -- his own children. (enter dramatic noise now)Mayor Larry Vaughn returns, still played by Murray Hamilton, and he's *still* skeptical about Brody. The council has their own little meeting once Brody brings pictures in from a victim's underwater camera that aren't clear enough to see detail. (To them maybe not but I sure as hell saw an eye!) Amongst themselves it is decided the poor chief is under too much pressure lately and needs to take himself a little ""vacation"". So yep, things are worse for our leading man this time around.Before I dive into the picture's faults I'll serve up the delectable slices. Some terrific death scenes -- especially the skier -- loved how that panned out and it really stuck with me. We have the POV viewpoints of the shark coming out of the water with great music, and what follows after with the boater...:) How anyone couldn't enjoy this movie at least a little for that scene alone is beyond me. The threat that a shark could take down a large killer whale was also impactual , as it was meant to be, but I couldn't help hating the so-called shark expert on scene. She was too bitchy, too pompous, and I would have paid to see her smug face get shredded by Jaws Jr. When a certain girl gets chomped trying to climb onto a boat, great scene there.The beginning is just as strong (well, almost) as the first. We have some underwater divers skirting around the sunken Orca with cameras and such. When one stands in front of the boat and starts doing his little hand movements the classic Jaws score kicks up but this time it's freaking enhanced and I was cheering in my seat. Great close ups of eyes when the attacks happen.Yet another exceptional part was when the team of divers were underwater, and we have a nice little chase scene going down. The man comes up so afraid he's in shock and has blood in his nose and mouth. A more realistic response to the shark than some other movies have. The girl Tina and her boyfriend in the boat was an excellent as hell scene.Needless to say...this movie is just full of adrenaline-high deaths!!The great directing by Jeannot Szwarc, and with these tricks I've mentioned above I think he did a great job. Although the plot was weak in a few spots (But hey, its a sequel of a killer shark, we can't expect miracles) there were some great shots, especially the POV of the shark, with the score leavened up from the first to have a more depressing edge.Whenever the chief is shown I was delighted. The man makes the movie. The rest of the actors make good shark chow but not much else. The ending was pretty weak; the way the shark went down was choppy and too unreal. The screaming girl got on my last nerve (would she never shut up??) and the boats looked like a strong wind could have blown them over. Were they made of plastic?The film drifted a too slowly at times and I found myself bored with the interaction between the forgettable teenagers; they just weren't interesting and there was nothing there. This stands as the biggest flaw.The shark itself seemed more vindictive. He killed relentlessly and seemed to be almost teasing Brody. Rubberish but realistic enough he looked like a demonic fish with half of his face burnt from a boat explosion. And did anyone else hear him growl? Instead of coming off as fierce, it came off more...well, cute.A keepable exciting flick that was the best that could be done as a sequel to something like Jaws. Enjoy it, relish it, because, trust me - no other good sequels are going to swim your way.",4,"May not be as epic as the original, but entertaining",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4349,"['hard', 'match', 'big', 'hit', 'Jaws', 'sequel', 'pretty', 'damn', 'hard', 'Not', 'same', 'class', 'predecessor', 'entertaining', 'shark', 'show', 'nevertheless.Roy', 'Scheider', 'returns', 'white', 'knight', 'same', 'role', 'kids', 'have', 'aged', 'entered', 'rebellious', 'stage', 'wife', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'entering', 'sort', 'political', 'position', 'stronger', 'role', 'preferred', 'more', 'first', 'background', 'character', 'Brody', 'again', 'shark', 'victims', 'are', ""n't"", 'face', 'first', 'flicks', 'harder', 'prove', 'would', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'believe', 'first', 'incident', 'perhaps', 'think', 'poor', 'chief', 'just', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'no', 'longer', 'help', 'did', 'original', 'now', 'combat', 'beast', 'alone', 'when', 'close', 'home', 'own', 'children', 'enter', 'dramatic', 'noise', 'now', 'Mayor', 'Larry', 'Vaughn', 'returns', 'still', 'played', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', '*still*', 'skeptical', 'Brody', 'council', 'own', 'little', 'meeting', 'Brody', 'pictures', 'victim', 'underwater', 'camera', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'see', 'detail', 'maybe', 'not', 'sure', 'hell', 'saw', 'eye', 'Amongst', 'decided', 'poor', 'chief', 'too', 'much', 'pressure', 'lately', 'take', 'little', 'vacation', 'So', 'yep', 'things', 'are', 'worse', 'leading', 'man', 'time', 'dive', 'picture', 'faults', ""'ll"", 'serve', 'up', 'delectable', 'slices', 'terrific', 'death', 'scenes', 'especially', 'skier', 'loved', 'how', 'panned', 'out', 'really', 'stuck', 'have', 'POV', 'viewpoints', 'shark', 'coming', 'water', 'great', 'music', 'what', 'boater', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'least', 'little', 'scene', 'alone', 'threat', 'shark', 'could', 'take', 'down', 'large', 'killer', 'whale', 'was', 'also', 'impactual', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'hating', 'so-called', 'shark', 'expert', 'scene', 'was', 'too', 'bitchy', 'too', 'pompous', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'see', 'smug', 'face', 'get', 'shredded', 'Jaws', 'Jr', 'When', 'certain', 'girl', 'chomped', 'trying', 'climb', 'boat', 'great', 'scene', 'there.The', 'beginning', 'just', 'strong', 'well', 'almost', 'first', 'have', 'underwater', 'divers', 'skirting', 'sunken', 'Orca', 'cameras', 'such', 'When', 'one', 'front', 'boat', 'doing', 'little', 'hand', 'movements', 'classic', 'Jaws', 'score', 'up', 'time', 'freaking', 'enhanced', 'was', 'cheering', 'seat', 'Great', 'close', 'ups', 'eyes', 'when', 'attacks', 'happen.Yet', 'exceptional', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'team', 'divers', 'were', 'underwater', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'chase', 'scene', 'going', 'down', 'man', 'up', 'so', 'shock', 'blood', 'nose', 'mouth', 'more', 'realistic', 'response', 'shark', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'girl', 'Tina', 'boyfriend', 'boat', 'was', 'excellent', 'hell', 'scene.Needless', 'say', 'movie', 'just', 'full', 'adrenaline-high', 'deaths', 'great', 'directing', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'tricks', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'plot', 'was', 'weak', 'few', 'spots', 'hey', 'sequel', 'killer', 'shark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'miracles', 'were', 'great', 'shots', 'especially', 'POV', 'shark', 'score', 'leavened', 'up', 'first', 'have', 'more', 'depressing', 'chief', 'shown', 'was', 'delighted', 'man', 'movie', 'rest', 'actors', 'make', 'good', 'shark', 'chow', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'way', 'shark', 'went', 'down', 'was', 'choppy', 'too', 'unreal', 'screaming', 'girl', 'got', 'last', 'nerve', 'would', 'never', 'shut', 'up', 'boats', 'looked', 'strong', 'wind', 'could', 'have', 'blown', 'Were', 'made', 'plastic', 'film', 'drifted', 'too', 'slowly', 'times', 'found', 'bored', 'interaction', 'forgettable', 'teenagers', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'was', 'nothing', 'there', 'biggest', 'flaw.The', 'shark', 'seemed', 'more', 'vindictive', 'killed', 'relentlessly', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'teasing', 'Brody', 'Rubberish', 'realistic', 'enough', 'looked', 'demonic', 'fish', 'half', 'face', 'burnt', 'boat', 'explosion', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'hear', 'growl', 'Instead', 'coming', 'off', 'fierce', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'well', 'cute.A', 'keepable', 'exciting', 'flick', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'sequel', 'something', 'Jaws', 'Enjoy', 'relish', 'trust', 'other', 'good', 'sequels', 'are', 'going', 'swim', 'way']",N/A

It was only a matter of time before the Universal released a sequel.  Jaws 2 was released in 1978 and while it predictably did not live up to the original in terms of quality and box office success, taken on its own, it is a great film.  Roy Scheider gives a stellar performance as Chief Martin Brody.  Still disturbed by the events from the first movie, Chief Brody slowly unravels as the signs of another shark invading Amity start showing up.  Again, the powers that be in Amity refuse to believe that they have a shark problem on their hands.  Brody reaches a breaking point when he snaps on a crowded beach and starts shooting up the water when he thinks he sees a shark and is fired as a result of the incident. Mr. Scheider perfectly conveys the sense of a man who has finally been beaten by the system.  Meanwhile, his two sons, Mike &amp; Sean and a bunch of their friends are out day sailing when the shark hunts them down and starts attacking.  There is a good deal of suspense in these scenes leading up to the climatic showdown between Brody and the shark.  The sequel is definitely more violent and bloodier than the first one.

So scary that it sent people who were avid ocean lovers desperately shrieking back to shore, never wanting to swim again (Cmon, you know that if you are swimming in the ocean and that jaws theme pops into your head that you are going to FREAK out and want OUT of that water fast!).Jaws 2 is one of the best sequels ever made (The only other better one I can think of off the top of my head is Aliens) and it hasn't gotten the credit it deserves. The shark in this film is angry and out for blood.Where the predecessor won viewers over with suspense and pacing, this film takes off out of the gates like seabiscuit and doesn't relent. There are a lot more shark attacks and although the ""cheese"" factor is higher and the tone is less serious than the first, this movie really, really works!This is certainly the best of the films, in my opinion.

I enjoyed the first Jaws, because there was a reason you wanted to identify with the characters, you went on the boat with them, you threw out the barrells with them, you sang songs with them, and almost had a drink with them.  You could identify to the characters, and had fun with them, in fact, you even learned a little bit about sharks. In other words, you cared what happened to them...In this film, it is nothing more than a Shark attacking people.

The story was told and there's no more to tell!  Sequel?  The Exorcist fell victim to this as well.  Some movies you can make sequels to because you can actually take the story somewhere else.  The Terminator's a good example.  But when you get a simple open and shut premise like Jaws, the only thing a sequel will do is rehash the plot of the original film in one way or another coz there's no new territory to take a story like Jaws in.  Friday The 13th is a good example of this.  So, what we get with Jaws 2 is basically the same plot as the first one, so immediately the suspense is down a notch coz you know what to expect.  Personally I can't buy the concept of another giant shark invading the same area for no reason.  People say it's an offspring of the original shark.  Yeah, right.  Now I'm sold on it.  Kind of like Son Of Dracula, eh?  Roy is back and is a saving grace for the film.  There's some gruesome shark attacks as well as a few fairly suspenseful ones.

Roy Scheider reprises his role as Amity's police chief Brody, who is finally getting past his fear of the sea and his terrifying tribulations on the Orca three years before.  Just as he feels that it is safe to go back into the water, his renegade son goes on a forbidden sailboat trip--only to have a huge twenty-five foot shark stalk them in the middle of the deserted ocean.Director Jeannot Szwarc is certainly no Spielberg and fails to create the fearsome atmosphere and the suspense that the original became famous for.  The film staggers as the plot develops, but is ultimately saved by Scheider when he comes to the rescue.  Not as intelligent, not as scary, and not as good.

200896,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6300182177,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","With the release ofJaws [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)on Blu-ray, I thought it was time to revisit the first--and best--sequel in the film series.An entertaining and largely unnecessary sequel ""Jaws 2"" does have its moments and most of those moments are due to the cast members that returned from the original film particularly the late Roy Scheider who returns as Cheif Brody. His performance is energetic and adds to the quality of the film.Director Jeannot Szwarc (Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)and the TV showFringe: The Complete Fourth Season)had cut his teeth directing TV shows such asNight Gallery - The Complete First SeasonandIronside - The Complete First Seasonmuch like Steven Spielberg but his career took a very different direction. Replacing director John D. Hancock after shooting began when (Hancock ticked off a couple of Universal executives), Szwarc constantly fought with Scheider during the shoot who was reluctant to return to his role initially but was forced to when he leftThe Deer Hunter [Blu-ray + DVD] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)after conflicts with THAT director (Michael Cimino).The DVD looks pretty good overall and the print used is relatively clean although it's clear some restoration could be done for the film. There are some noticeable compression artifacts in the presentation. Audio sounds quite nice although it would be nice to see this remixed for a 5.1 presentation. John Williams score while it does echo ""Jaws"" has quite a bit of different and new music composed for the film. Szwarc initially asked Williams to write a more complex score because he felt the sequel was more complex than the original.The special features are also quite nice. First up we get a 45 minute documentary on making the shark as well as an eight minute interview with co-star (and now director) Keith Gordon who plays one of the teenagers in the film and a brief interview with Williams discussing the score. We also get a bit of background on WHY the film had a slightly different title in France (where the title suggested that the film was, well, ca-ca).Also included are deleted scenes. Criticized by some for showing the shark too early and too often the director recognized that there was no way to create the impact that Spielberg had with his first film so opted for a different approach. The deleted scenes include a cut sequence where the chopper pilot is attacked by the shark that was cut to secure a PG rating but the brutal sequence also demonstrates that Szwarc was going for a more blunt approach. We also get storyboards and other material included as well.Sadly, Scheider didn't participate while he was alive probably because he made the film under duress although he WAS well compensated for getting gross points of the film that amounted to $500,000 back in the day (more than his salary for the film). Szwarc doesn't really provide much information about his on set conflicts with Scheider (at one point they got into a physical fight).Although ""Jaws 2"" isn't as good or as strong as the original the director Szwarc does enough right to make the film interesting and different enough when compared to the original film to make it entertaining.",3,"""Jaws 2"" has its moments although it isn't as strong as the first film",1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,3248,"['release', 'ofJaws', '[', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', ']', 'Universal', '100th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'revisit', 'first', 'best', 'sequel', 'film', 'series.An', 'entertaining', 'largely', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', 'Jaws', '2', 'have', 'moments', 'most', 'moments', 'are', 'due', 'cast', 'members', 'returned', 'original', 'film', 'particularly', 'late', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'who', 'Cheif', 'Brody', 'performance', 'energetic', 'quality', 'film.Director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'TV', 'showFringe', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'had', 'cut', 'teeth', 'directing', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', 'asNight', 'Gallery', 'Complete', 'First', 'SeasonandIronside', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonmuch', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'career', 'took', 'very', 'different', 'direction', 'Replacing', 'director', 'John', 'D.', 'Hancock', 'shooting', 'began', 'when', 'Hancock', 'ticked', 'off', 'couple', 'Universal', 'executives', 'Szwarc', 'constantly', 'fought', 'Scheider', 'shoot', 'who', 'was', 'reluctant', 'return', 'role', 'initially', 'was', 'forced', 'when', 'leftThe', 'Deer', 'Hunter', '[', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', ']', 'Universal', '100th', 'Anniversary', 'conflicts', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cimino', '.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'print', 'used', 'relatively', 'clean', 'clear', 'restoration', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'are', 'noticeable', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'presentation', 'Audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'remixed', '5.1', 'presentation', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'echo', 'Jaws', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'new', 'music', 'composed', 'film', 'Szwarc', 'initially', 'asked', 'Williams', 'write', 'more', 'complex', 'score', 'felt', 'sequel', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'original.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'nice', 'First', 'up', 'get', '45', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'shark', 'as', 'well', 'eight', 'minute', 'interview', 'co-star', 'now', 'director', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'who', 'one', 'teenagers', 'film', 'brief', 'interview', 'Williams', 'discussing', 'score', 'also', 'get', 'bit', 'background', 'WHY', 'film', 'had', 'slightly', 'different', 'title', 'France', 'where', 'title', 'suggested', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'ca-ca', '.Also', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Criticized', 'showing', 'shark', 'too', 'early', 'too', 'often', 'director', 'recognized', 'was', 'way', 'create', 'impact', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'opted', 'different', 'approach', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'cut', 'sequence', 'where', 'chopper', 'pilot', 'attacked', 'shark', 'was', 'cut', 'secure', 'PG', 'rating', 'brutal', 'sequence', 'also', 'Szwarc', 'was', 'going', 'more', 'blunt', 'approach', 'also', 'get', 'storyboards', 'other', 'material', 'included', 'well.Sadly', 'Scheider', 'did', ""n't"", 'participate', 'was', 'alive', 'probably', 'made', 'film', 'duress', 'WAS', 'well', 'compensated', 'getting', 'gross', 'points', 'film', 'amounted', '500,000', 'back', 'day', 'more', 'salary', 'film', 'Szwarc', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'much', 'information', 'set', 'conflicts', 'Scheider', 'one', 'point', 'got', 'physical', 'fight', 'Jaws', '2', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'as', 'strong', 'original', 'director', 'Szwarc', 'enough', 'right', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'different', 'enough', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'film', 'make', 'entertaining']",N/A
