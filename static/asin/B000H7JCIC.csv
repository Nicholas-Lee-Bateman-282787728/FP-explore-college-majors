A live performance she gave at Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, New York on July 18, 1993 that aired on NBC as a Thanksgiving special later that year. So why is it labeled as the ""authentic"" MTV Unplugged performance? I guess somebody felt the need to lie to people so that they'd be tricked into buying the DVD so that their regular yacht payment could keep comming in on time like it usually does ;-)And they are deceptive, aren't they? They, literally, took the photo that the MTV Unplugged CD used and stuck it on this DVD package to help with the con. Did these dummies ever think maybe, just maybe, it would've been better if they got Viacom to actually let them release the REAL performance Mariah gave for MTV Unplugged back in the day? NO!

As a long time Mariah fan, its evident to me that she has been unable to capture the pure innocence of this concert in her later works. I would love for her to revisit her Unplugged Days again - because to me, this remains the most vital and essential Unplugged of the whole lot (yes, I prefer this to the Nirvana one as well!).Remember, that the live version of ""I'll Be There"" that Mariah sings here with friend Trey Lorenz was tentatively released to radio back in the day, and ended up becoming a No. 1 smash. That must be one of the few No. 1 Singles that was recorded off a TV Show! Equally stellar is her stunning performance of ""If It's Over"", which I can (and have) played back to back just to listen to her voice. That voice!Mariah also used this concert to shut up her detractors. She used the whistle register here (at the end of ""Emotions"") and the crowd just goes wild. You can feel the respect and awe in the air, and a fresh faced Mariah is never vain - instead, she chooses to let her voice do the talking and doesn't indulge in useless stage banter. Her final song ""Can't Let Go"" is a slow burner that just oozes sensuality. And that voice! Again, it bears repeating!I have got to say - even if you're not a Mariah fan, get this. Of all her DVDs, this is undisputably the best Mariah Carey DVD on the market, and if you have to own just one thing by her, this would be it.Absolutely indispensable.

Just good, old-fashioned Soul singing.  Most of the songs performed here are from her debut ""Mariah Carey"" and her sophomore ""Emotions"" discs. IMO, the ""Emotions"" CD, which features incredible vocals, production and material deeply rooted in R&B;, remains Carey's best album to date.Carey is backed by a great band and some fantastic backup singers, including the Price Sisters (with Kelly Price) and Trey Lorenz.  Carey breezes comfortably through cuts from both albums as well as her Grammy-nominated duet with Trey, ""I'll Be There"". It's also great to see some of her best music videos, namely ""Can't Let Go"" and ""Make It Happen"", which both make their DVD debut here.I only have one complaint about this DVD.  Due to copyright protection, this DVD can not be played on a computer DVD player.  Other than that, this DVD is the best live performance from Mariah that has been captured on video thus far.
