This documentary does a good job of dispelling that myth.People who have never lived under a dictatorship as ruthlessly efficient as the Nazis can never know the kind of courage it would take to stand-up to such a regime, despite the infinitesimal chance that their efforts would result in the fall of the Nazis or death of Hitler. Given that the Nazis killed or imprisoned many of their opponents shortly after their takeover and the Gestapo was constantly on the lookout for dissenters afterwards, resistance to the Nazis involved such people risking everything they had, including their lives and the lives of their families.Due to the filmValkyrie, most people are aware of the attempted assassination on July 20, 1944 and the filmSwing Kidsbrought attention to the early resistance to the Nazis by young people active in Germany's 1930s jazz subculture. But these films were made mostly by casting Hollywood stars to lure people into theaters and featuring soundtracks to entertain us with music.The Restless Conscienceis a documentary and offered nothing more than the information most people did not possess before seeing it. While it may seem to be dry in its delivery, resembling a television report more than anything else, it shows us some of the bravest of the German people: those who dared resist the Nazis when most Germans either could not - or would not - do so.I wish that the 2004 filmEdelweiss Pirates (Original Germain Version With English Subtitles)was also available for Instant download, but you can buy the DVD.",5,Martyrs in the War Against Hitler,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1747,"['Too', 'little', 'known', 'Germans', 'who', 'did', 'resist', 'Nazis', '1933', '1945', 'especially', 'many', 'had', 'been', 'taught', 'childhood', 'German', 'people', 'supported', 'Hitler', 'when', 'was', 'power', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'dispelling', 'myth.People', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'lived', 'dictatorship', 'ruthlessly', 'efficient', 'Nazis', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'kind', 'courage', 'would', 'take', 'stand-up', 'regime', 'infinitesimal', 'chance', 'efforts', 'would', 'result', 'fall', 'Nazis', 'death', 'Hitler', 'Given', 'Nazis', 'killed', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'opponents', 'shortly', 'takeover', 'Gestapo', 'was', 'constantly', 'lookout', 'dissenters', 'afterwards', 'resistance', 'Nazis', 'involved', 'such', 'people', 'risking', 'everything', 'had', 'including', 'lives', 'lives', 'families.Due', 'filmValkyrie', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'July', '20', '1944', 'filmSwing', 'Kidsbrought', 'attention', 'early', 'resistance', 'Nazis', 'young', 'people', 'active', 'Germany', '1930s', 'jazz', 'subculture', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'mostly', 'casting', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'lure', 'people', 'theaters', 'featuring', 'soundtracks', 'entertain', 'music.The', 'Restless', 'Conscienceis', 'documentary', 'offered', 'nothing', 'more', 'information', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'possess', 'seeing', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'dry', 'delivery', 'resembling', 'television', 'report', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'bravest', 'German', 'people', 'who', 'dared', 'resist', 'Nazis', 'when', 'most', 'Germans', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'so.I', 'wish', '2004', 'filmEdelweiss', 'Pirates', 'Original', 'Germain', 'Version', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'was', 'also', 'available', 'Instant', 'download', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

Hava Beller does an outstanding job of walking us through the efforts to assassinate Hitler.  Progressive forces in the military - many decorated Generals with family pedigrees for generations - were on board with the attempts.  They even approached England and France for assistance - which, had it come to light, would have meant certain death.  They were rebuffed by both.  Of course, all of the progressive military officers who figured in these plots were executed after the failed July 20th attempt, and by horrific means.  But the film really succeeds in getting the viewer to ask why England and France were unwilling to offer assistance.  The question is only asked, not answered.
