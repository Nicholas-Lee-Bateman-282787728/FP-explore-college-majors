So when I heard that Zombie Nation had: a serial killer who hides behind a badge; a 17-year-old girl who seeks help from a group of voodoo priestesses to avoid becoming the cop's next victim; and hot female zombies who rise from their graves seeking bloody vengeance, it sounded to me like ""Zombie Nation"" was a can't miss B-movie; it wasn't.The acting was insipid, the casting was horrific, the special effects were awful, and the dialogue was indescribably bad. Some bad movies are so bad that they are fun to laugh at, this isn't one of them. This is so bad that you find yourself thinking about writing a ""bad"" review of the move while you are watching it. This is a movie where the zombies go directly, and without explanation, from being so ""zombie like"" that they eat the people who stop to offer them rides to crying about the fact that since they are zombies they can't go home again. Shortly after subjecting us to all of this ""zombie melodrama"" the zombies go back to eating people.There are some movies that rise above low budgets. This isn't one of them. This is a movie where you find yourself looking at the police station and thinking, this looks like the inside of a warehouse. Then you watch a scene where the main character lives in a (familiar looking) warehouse, followed by a scene where you find out that the main character moonlights at a warehouse.

Once the women are handcuffed in the warehouse loft, the renegade cop performs the following steps:(A) He checks their teeth with a miniature flashlight.(B) He injects their buttocks with an unknown but presumably lethal substance.(C) He watches some television.(D) He tosses the women into an extra-wide shopping cart and conveys them to a queen-sized bed.(E) He jots down the names of the women in a small notebook.(F) He crams the women into giant-sized duffle bags, and transports them to diverse places of interment.Eventually, a group of Voodoo women are shown performing an arcane ceremony over the sprawled body of a blonde girl in fishnet stockings. Voodoo Ritual Ingredients: (1) snake, (1) tarantula, (1) bleeding pig's head, and (1) set of preserved shark's jaws.The girl in the fishnets is shortly thereafter kidnapped by the renegade cop, subjected to the aforementioned steps (A) through (F), and then buried at sea. However, thanks to the Voodoo Ritual, the girl in the fishnets returns from the dead; unexplainably all of the other non-Voodoo-treated women are resurrected as well. The undead status of the she-zombies is solely indicated by the black spray paint around their eyes, which causes them to look more like raccoons than zombies. (The she-zombies are shown to be mildly decayed in their mirror images; according to the Voodoo women, the she-zombies' physical appearance is based on their own perception, and since they apparently perceive themselves as raccoons rather than she-zombies, their default appearance is non-decayed.) The she-zombies emasculate and de-tongue a couple of male victims before working their way to the renegade cop. Cut and print!Congratulations!

1023252,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000J10EQK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","Zombie Nation (Ulli Lommel, 2004)According to the voting at IMDB, Zombie Nation is the fourteenth worst movie of all time as I write this (3 November 2009). I disagree. It's barely the fourteenth worst movie I've seen this week, and two, Grizzly Park and Dark Remains, stand out as far more worthy of inclusion on IMDB's 100-worst list (for comparison's sake, Zombie Nation sits at 1.6, while Grizzly Park rates a 4.1 and Dark Remains a 5.2). Don't get me wrong, this movie is terrible in ways that make me want to curl up in a corner and suck my thumb, but believe me when I tell you that worse things exist in the dark corners of your video store.The barely intelligible plot involves a corrupt cop, Joe Singer (Gunther Ziegler, a veteran of this sort of direct-to-video crap who showed up very briefly in Get Smart! last year), who really has a thing for killing women. His new partner, Vitalio (Brandon Dean), suspects something is up, but because he's a braindead moron, doesn't really get it. This interplay takes up the first hour of this eighty-minute movie, so I'd not tell you any more for fear of spoilers except that, well, the movie is called Zombie Nation. So you probably figured out that one of his victims is under the protection of voodoo priestesses, and so they all come back to get their revenge.This is far more urban drama/really awful mystery than it is horror movie. The gore effects are cheap and minimal and all the supposed horror is packed into the final twenty minutes. (Those unwise enough to have seen more of Lommel's post-Fassbinder work will probably recognize the idiotic flashback technique enough to understand what's going on, but for those of you who haven't, just roll with it, it will all be made clear eventually, Kind of.) This can sometimes be effective if your movie is actually building tension with great characters or an amazing script (viz. Paranormal Activity), but everything about this movie is so far below average that gutter would be a step up. I do have to give Lommel points, however, for managing to keep an hour and ten minutes of footage in an hour and twenty minute film in the same location. (Almost the entire film was shot in one large warehouse. Which gets really, really funny in the police-precinct scenes.) This is a man who knows how to take no budget and turn it into serious no-budget crap. If you look at it as a stupid unintentional comedy that you can use as, say, a drinking game, then there is some value to be had here. But I could go on all day about how horrible this movie is and we'd still be here at closing time. So just take my word for it; you want to avoid this movie unless your only other choices are Sci-Fi Channel Originals. *",1,"If Ulli Lommel continues to make movies and no one hears, do they still exist?",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2717,"['Zombie', 'Nation', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', '2004', 'According', 'voting', 'IMDB', 'Zombie', 'Nation', 'fourteenth', 'worst', 'movie', 'time', 'write', '3', 'November', '2009', 'disagree', 'barely', 'fourteenth', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'week', 'two', 'Grizzly', 'Park', 'Dark', 'Remains', 'stand', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'IMDB', '100-worst', 'list', 'comparison', 'sake', 'Zombie', 'Nation', '1.6', 'Grizzly', 'Park', 'rates', '4.1', 'Dark', '5.2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'terrible', 'ways', 'make', 'want', 'curl', 'up', 'corner', 'suck', 'thumb', 'believe', 'when', 'tell', 'worse', 'things', 'exist', 'dark', 'corners', 'video', 'store.The', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'plot', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Singer', 'Gunther', 'Ziegler', 'veteran', 'sort', 'direct-to-video', 'crap', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'very', 'briefly', 'Get', 'Smart', 'last', 'year', 'who', 'really', 'thing', 'killing', 'women', 'new', 'partner', 'Vitalio', 'Brandon', 'Dean', 'something', 'up', 'braindead', 'moron', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'interplay', 'up', 'first', 'hour', 'eighty-minute', 'movie', ""'d"", 'not', 'tell', 'more', 'fear', 'spoilers', 'well', 'movie', 'called', 'Zombie', 'Nation', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'one', 'victims', 'protection', 'voodoo', 'priestesses', 'so', 'come', 'back', 'get', 'revenge.This', 'far', 'more', 'urban', 'drama/really', 'awful', 'mystery', 'horror', 'movie', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'cheap', 'minimal', 'supposed', 'horror', 'packed', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'unwise', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Lommel', 'post-Fassbinder', 'work', 'will', 'probably', 'recognize', 'idiotic', 'flashback', 'technique', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'just', 'roll', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'eventually', 'Kind', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'effective', 'movie', 'actually', 'building', 'tension', 'great', 'characters', 'amazing', 'script', 'viz', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'everything', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'below', 'average', 'gutter', 'would', 'be', 'step', 'up', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'Lommel', 'points', 'however', 'managing', 'keep', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'footage', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minute', 'film', 'same', 'location', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'one', 'large', 'warehouse', 'Which', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'police-precinct', 'scenes', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'take', 'budget', 'turn', 'serious', 'no-budget', 'crap', 'look', 'stupid', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'can', 'use', 'say', 'drinking', 'game', 'then', 'value', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'could', 'go', 'day', 'how', 'horrible', 'movie', ""'d"", 'still', 'be', 'here', 'closing', 'time', 'So', 'just', 'take', 'word', 'want', 'avoid', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'choices', 'are', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Originals', '*']",Zombie Nation

The plot / script of this movie is out of control, going this way, then that way, with dangling plot threads never to be resolved. The lighting was bad, the camera work was bad, and the sound was horrible! Minimal blood and gore. The make up of the zombies consisted of raccoon eyes. That's it. Yup. Really. Raccoon eyes. The nest thing about this movie, (other than rejoicingly watching the end credits roll) is the cover art. Too bad that this zombie or even that this type of make up never appears in this movie.3) ZOMBIES: The only familiarities between the zombies (all 5 of them...hardly a ""nation"" as the title suggests...) and current day zombies are that they are indeed, dead, and that they eat flesh. That's it. Really. They walk, talk, and carry on like everyday people. They even join the police force!
