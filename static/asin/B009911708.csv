A time where networks didn't have the mind set that only T&A, extreme violence (especially against women and children), vulgar language and other types of shows unacceptable to the moral majority are the ""in"" way to go.  I'm by no means a prude but I am so sick of having these type of shows being the only thing available most evenings.  There are a few exceptions where one can still catch a pretty good show, but very few.  Thank heavens for TCM and the availability of good classic movies thereon, The Discovery Channel, PBS, National Geographic to name a few, as well as the availability of shows such as the F.B.I. on DVD.",5,From a time when there were decent shows on T.V.,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,727,"['series', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'quality', 'decent', 'entertaining', 'T.V', 'shows', 'time', 'where', 'networks', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'mind', 'set', 'only', 'T', 'A', 'extreme', 'violence', 'especially', 'women', 'children', 'vulgar', 'language', 'other', 'types', 'shows', 'unacceptable', 'moral', 'majority', 'are', 'way', 'go', ""'m"", 'prude', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'having', 'type', 'shows', 'being', 'only', 'thing', 'available', 'most', 'evenings', 'are', 'few', 'exceptions', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'catch', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'very', 'few', 'Thank', 'TCM', 'availability', 'good', 'classic', 'movies', 'thereon', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'PBS', 'National', 'Geographic', 'name', 'few', 'as', 'well', 'availability', 'shows', 'such', 'F.B.I', 'DVD']",The FBI: The Third Season Part Two

Much more simple than today with so many choices available!Efrem Zimbalist, JR. passed away at the age of 95 today and his death reminded me of this series.  They were filed with action, adventure and in fitting  the scope of the FBI line they also had kidnapping, espionage and murder.

I've waited a long time for this because I like the way Quinn Martin presented the show - Act I, II ... and Epilogue.I was pre-teens when I watched this on tv and at that time, the FBI were the good guys, untainted by politics or scandal. Maybe that's why the show appeals to me still - reminds me of when the Feds were still regarded by most as decent.Plots are interesting with occasional shoot-outs.Think the DVDs so far are the earlier episodes before the narrator explained the FBI's involvement.",4,The good old days.,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,592,"['SUSPECT', 'series', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'like', 'way', 'Quinn', 'Martin', 'presented', 'show', 'Act', 'II', 'Epilogue.I', 'was', 'pre-teens', 'when', 'watched', 'tv', 'time', 'FBI', 'were', 'good', 'guys', 'untainted', 'politics', 'scandal', 'why', 'show', 'appeals', 'still', 'when', 'Feds', 'were', 'still', 'regarded', 'most', 'decent.Plots', 'are', 'interesting', 'occasional', 'shoot-outs.Think', 'DVDs', 'far', 'are', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'narrator', 'explained', 'FBI', 'involvement']",The FBI: The Third Season Part Two
