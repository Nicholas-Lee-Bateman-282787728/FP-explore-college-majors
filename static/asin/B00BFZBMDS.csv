Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the five movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case. Video/audio quality varies by disc, but is generally excellent; these discs also include a variety of special features that take you behind the scenes of the making of the movies.The Fast and Furious films vary greatly in quality, but they are all entertaining.  If you are into cars or the racing culture, then these movies are made for you.  I'm not much of a car guy myself, but I enjoyed these films because of the car chases and stunts, which have become progressively more over-the-top but are always fun to watch.  My favorite of the films is the most recent one, ""Fast Five"", which is less of a racing film and more of a heist movie.In addition to the blu-ray disc, each movie also comes with a Digital Copy (compatible with iTunes) and an Ultraviolet copy which allows you to stream the film on various devices.If you've never seen the Fast & Furious films, or if you're a fan but have yet to buy them, then this collection of five films on blu-ray is the perfect set for you and comes highly recommended.Here are the links to the individual releases:The Fast and the Furious (Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)2 Fast 2 Furious (Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)Fast & Furious (2009) (Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)Fast Five (Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)",4,"""The Fast and the Furious"" Bundle",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1556,"['bundle', 'five', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movies', 'Please', 'note', 'not', 'box', 'set', 'just', 'five', 'movies', 'sold', 'together', 'movie', 'own', 'separate', 'blu-ray', 'case', 'Video/audio', 'quality', 'varies', 'disc', 'generally', 'excellent', 'discs', 'also', 'include', 'variety', 'special', 'features', 'take', 'scenes', 'making', 'movies.The', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'films', 'vary', 'greatly', 'quality', 'are', 'entertaining', 'are', 'cars', 'racing', 'culture', 'then', 'movies', 'are', 'made', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'car', 'guy', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'car', 'chases', 'stunts', 'have', 'become', 'progressively', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'favorite', 'films', 'most', 'recent', 'one', 'Fast', 'Five', 'less', 'racing', 'film', 'more', 'heist', 'movie.In', 'addition', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'movie', 'also', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'compatible', 'iTunes', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'stream', 'film', 'various', 'devices.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'films', ""'re"", 'fan', 'have', 'yet', 'buy', 'then', 'collection', 'five', 'films', 'blu-ray', 'perfect', 'set', 'highly', 'are', 'links', 'individual', 'releases', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', '2', 'Fast', '2', 'Furious', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Fast', 'Furious', '2009', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Fast', 'Five', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet']",N/A

Paul Walker and Vin Diesel (were) are a good team and the supporting cast is usually just as interesting (Han especially). The best of the series in my book is probably a tie between No. 1 and No. 5 although they are all fun to watch. No. 4 gets a few demerits because the CGI of the tunnel chase seems to show some cost cutting and Braga isn't the best villain. No. 2 gets a few knocks because of Paul Walker and Tyrese's constant use of &#34;cuz,&#34; &#34;bro,&#34; etc. It's strange how that all disappeared when they were all reunited in the later movies. Tokyo Drift (no. 3, but apparently the events take place after 6) is surprisingly well done even without most of the original cast (Diesel makes a brief cameo that seemed unimportant when 3 was released but now is much more key to the series). The drifting in particular was very beautifully shot, especially in the mountain scenes.This package deal that Amazon sells is well worth the price since Universal hasn't found it necessary to issue a box set yet (presumably they are waiting for part 7 to be released).
