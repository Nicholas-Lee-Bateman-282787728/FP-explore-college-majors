144641,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792840038,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","The film begins with a rehearsal in a movie factory. Then a telephone call tries to reach some people but they won't accept the call. Jonathan wants to make a new picture with these people. Then there are flashbacks to the past life in Hollywood. Jonathan Shields began working in Hollywood; his father left him little. He has an idea for a horror film to suggest fear with minimal effects and costs. It works. Then they take on a script that the other studios rejected. We see how his friend is wounded and disappointed when a more experienced director is chosen. The daughter of a famous actor tries out for a bigger role. Does she have a problem? Will Jonathan take care of it? The scenes show the repetition that goes into creating a movie. The big budget film is a big hit that repays the investors. [They don't discuss the financial backing in this business.]Georgia goes to see Jonathan and gets a surprise! She takes it hard, and leaves for another studio. Then we see how a college professor goes to Hollywood to work in pictures. His wife acclimatizes to Hollywood life. The professor finds it tough working there (a different atmosphere?). Jonathan knows how to make Bartlow productive. But there is a plane accident. Jonathan tries his hand at directing; the result is not good. [A lack of checks and balances.] Bartlow learns something that makes him into an enemy. At the end they make a decision - but maybe not.Jonathan is a good manager: he selects people by their talent rather than by friendship. Some are hurt by this. When he departs from this rule (by directing a movie) he has a disaster. Hollywood was in turmoil in the early 1950s. The number of theatres and ticket buyers was declining. People were fascinated with television in their homes. The political conflicts purged some people (a part of declining business?). Yet television would provide more entertainment to viewers per week than Hollywood ever could. The film touches lightly on drinking, gambling, drugs, love affairs or subjects that made scandal newspapers more popular, then or now.Does the pressure of working long days for most of the week contribute to the drinking, drugs, and sexual affairs of Hollywood actors? Or is it the very nature of pretending to be something you're not that affects the psychology of actors? Fans of Hollywood history might appreciate a producer who takes off his shoes in his office. [A sign of power?] Casting Gloria Grahame as the wife of a writer was inspired. A Hollywood producer exercises over-all control and handles the many problems that arise in the making of a movie.",3,The Hollywood Version of Hollywood,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,2601,"['film', 'rehearsal', 'movie', 'factory', 'Then', 'telephone', 'call', 'tries', 'reach', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'call', 'Jonathan', 'make', 'new', 'picture', 'people', 'Then', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'Jonathan', 'Shields', 'began', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'father', 'left', 'little', 'idea', 'horror', 'film', 'suggest', 'fear', 'minimal', 'effects', 'costs', 'Then', 'take', 'script', 'other', 'studios', 'rejected', 'see', 'how', 'friend', 'wounded', 'disappointed', 'when', 'more', 'experienced', 'director', 'chosen', 'daughter', 'famous', 'actor', 'out', 'bigger', 'role', 'have', 'problem', 'Will', 'Jonathan', 'take', 'care', 'scenes', 'show', 'repetition', 'creating', 'movie', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'big', 'hit', 'investors', '[', 'do', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'financial', 'backing', 'business', 'Georgia', 'see', 'Jonathan', 'surprise', 'hard', 'studio', 'Then', 'see', 'how', 'college', 'professor', 'Hollywood', 'work', 'pictures', 'wife', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'professor', 'tough', 'working', 'there', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'Jonathan', 'how', 'make', 'Bartlow', 'productive', 'plane', 'accident', 'Jonathan', 'hand', 'directing', 'result', 'not', 'good', '[', 'lack', 'checks', 'balances', ']', 'Bartlow', 'something', 'enemy', 'end', 'make', 'decision', 'maybe', 'not.Jonathan', 'good', 'manager', 'people', 'talent', 'rather', 'friendship', 'are', 'hurt', 'When', 'rule', 'directing', 'movie', 'disaster', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'turmoil', 'early', '1950s', 'number', 'theatres', 'ticket', 'buyers', 'was', 'declining', 'People', 'were', 'fascinated', 'television', 'homes', 'political', 'conflicts', 'purged', 'people', 'part', 'declining', 'business', 'television', 'would', 'provide', 'more', 'entertainment', 'viewers', 'week', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'could', 'film', 'touches', 'lightly', 'drinking', 'gambling', 'drugs', 'love', 'affairs', 'subjects', 'made', 'scandal', 'newspapers', 'more', 'popular', 'then', 'pressure', 'working', 'long', 'days', 'most', 'week', 'contribute', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'sexual', 'affairs', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'very', 'nature', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'psychology', 'actors', 'Fans', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'might', 'appreciate', 'producer', 'who', 'shoes', 'office', '[', 'sign', 'power', ']', 'Casting', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'wife', 'writer', 'was', 'inspired', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'over-all', 'control', 'many', 'problems', 'arise', 'making', 'movie']",N/A

144643,AGEIT17HENDIS,0792840038,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Hollywood over its long history has not been shy about touting its virtues in film. That proposition applies whether the subject is cinema as art, mere entertainment, or the bottom line, the dough-making bottom line. And those premises are intermingled and on display here in this 1950s film noir epic, The Bad and the Beautiful, as an all-star cast goes through its paces in this melodramatic look at the foibles on one hot-shot Hollywood producer, Jonathan Shields (played with a decided smirk by Kirk Douglas).The plot line here unfolds as a series of flashbacks all centered around the relationship that three Hollywood denizens;a now high gloss star played by Lana Turner (the beautiful of the title although not as fetching as in The Postman Always Rings Twice), a now successful big picture director played by Barry Sullivan and a now famous and honored screenwriter played by Dick Powell to our bad boy Jonathan. The mix is cemented by, of course, the money man, the film rainmaker, played by Walter Pidgeon. And that combination of scenarios of those relationships when all three were from hunger (one way or another) is what drives the narrative here. Almost.No, what drives the narrative is that Jonathan needs a smash film after coming up on hard times and he, through the money man, is asking, no begging this trio to bail him out for old times sake. Their collective response. No way, no way in hell. That allows each to flashback to their less than equitable relationship with bad Mr. J. Seems that our boy is out of the old school and just wants to make great pictures, great dough, and a name for himself in the hills of Babylon and doesn't care who he steps on, over, or under to get there. Of course, shining through the brutal treatment, or so the argument goes, all three go on to great success so Johnny is really the catalyst behind them. So, come on guys, just one time for the old boss. See the film to see if they change their minds.

I mean, the performances (as a uniformed whole) sizzle, the set pieces and costumes dazzle and the climax hits with a giant bang (felt right in the gut).  &#8216;The Bad and the Beautiful&#8217; is neither bad nor beautiful but some marvelous amalgam of the two.The film uncovers the seedy realities of Hollywood by focusing on a self-centered and self-promoting film producer and the lives entangled in his webs of lies, manipulation and advantage.  Jonathan Shields has big dreams for himself and he&#8217;ll walk all over anyone it takes to attain them.  This includes Fred, his business partner and director who gets squeezed out of a film deal because of Shields.  It also includes Georgia, the alcoholic actress who falls in love with him only to have him take clear advantage of her emotions.  And then there is James, the author who has Jonathan&#8217;s claws dug into his flesh and the flesh of his unassuming wife, Rosemary.The film is told in thirds, each act focusing on his betrayal of one of the key characters in his life.For me, this film is kind of glorious.  Yes, there is a lot of &#8216;over&#8217; everything here, which only helps balance out the straight faced &#8216;noir&#8217; angle of it all.  It feels like the perfect blend of two totally (and tonally) different worlds, and I applaud Vincente Minnelli for making it all work so well.Kirk Douglas was born to play this role.  It fits him like a glove.  He is seductive and crushing and manipulative and sleazy and charming and just everything needed to sell every move he makes.  Lana Turner became a star thanks to this film and this performance, and rightfully so.  She makes each broad stroke feel lived in, and she makes the quiet moments feel richly developed.  I would have loved her to have received the Oscar instead of Gloria Grahame, who is fine here but does nothing of real note here.  Barry Sullivan and Dick Powell are both really good here, downplaying their emotions well enough to balance out the broader leads.  Powell is particularly effective in the latter half of the film.&#8216;The Bad and the Beautiful&#8217; is beloved by many, a true classic, and it deserves that title.

Obviously, Kirk Douglas has the star quality written all over his face, and it shows in The Bad and the Beautiful. Without a question, he gives the best performance of the show and is a scene-stealer. Lana Turner gives a good but not believable performance because, simply put, her looks overshadow the challenges of her character. So, I don't buy it for a second. It's not her best work anyway. Gloria Grahame wins the Oscar for her supporting performance, but her work is very overrated. It's nothing special. Of any, the worst performance and the most unbearable is Dick Powell. Nobody acts like that in real life; too hammy, overdone, and plain annoying. On the other hand, the story is interesting, but who cares?

144650,A23UB49EG29MVT,0792840038,Commenter77,"[1, 1]","This movie was hard for me to get into for a long time, but finally got in the mood to check it out.  Like most viewers, I have favorite segments.  It is certainly dated and there is some dispute as to whether or not it is in the classic line.  But in 1952, it was a big splash likely due to the star power, advanced publicity and sweep. It was different for the era (no doubt considered a bit racy), and probably compared more favorably with other films of the year.Kirk Douglas is of course a Hollywood classic and always has interest.  Whether his character is lead, head or tail, he's a good watch.  This is a very strong role with plenty to watch and probably the top performance of his career to the date of the picture.Lana Turner has never been a favorite of mine, finding her style alternatively slick and emotive.  Some consider that her best work was done in this picture (perhaps the famous driving scene).  My take on her as an actress in general is echoed by a line about her character in this film.  It's when Shields comments on her character's poor audition, saying that he wanted her for his lead part anyway because she had star power.  He said that as bad as she was in the audition, every eye was on her in her scene.  We become fascinated with certain personalities and will flock to see anything with them in it.  Many of these are not good performers, even though they are around long enough to pick up some awards.  They get lots of chances to hit, being kept at work in film after film because of their box office draw.I liked Dick Powell in this better than anything I have seen of him.  Found myself perking up and watching him closely, which I have never done with him before.  His character always drew my interest.  He portrayed a strong, practical and level headed man, who did seem to be too easily swerved by his whimsical wife. It didn't weaken him overall. Regardless, I found his character very likeable. He, along with Walter Pidgeon's character and others, were the background levelers required to keep the ship on even keel.I don't begrudge Gloria Grahame her Oscar for her supporting role. Many find it surprising for such limited screen time.  She may have compared more favorably with other supporting actresses that particular year.  But I think she is a skillful actress (worked on stage as well), and am glad she received recognition.  She has well played a range of characters from a gangster's moll to that nut-job in ""Oklahoma.""  As most are aware, sometimes actors are awarded for a role that may not be their best, but were passed over the previous year(s) due to a crowded field.I was curious about the Lila actress, the nasty dame who slinked down the stairway near the end, casting a shadow across Georgia's face as she hugged Shields.

Three of these people tell of their dealings with him, and none of them have too many good things to say.I liked the first and third segments but didn't care for the middle one with Lana Turner simply because Turner became so melodramatic, too hysterical for me. Barry Sullivan was excellent in the first part and helped get me into the story. He was the director who got ""screwed"" by Douglas.Turner was the unknown actress whom Douglas turned into a star while the last part dealt with the key screenwriter for Douglas, played by Dick Powell. I thought Powell was the best of the four main characters of the film but his segment was the shortest, unfortunately. As good as he was, his wife was equally as annoying. She was played by the normally entertaining and alluring Gloria Grahame, who was anything but that in this role. She sounded ludicrous with her fake southern accent. How she won an Academy Award for this role is mind- boggling.Some classify this movie as film noir, but I dispute that. It's simply a straight drama with soapish overtones.

144657,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792840038,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Known more for his stylish MGM musicals, director Vincente Minnelli pulled out all the stops for this classic 1952 melodrama about a ruthless film producer, Jonathan Shields, who alienates all of those around him to build his fortunes and legacy in Hollywood. But this is no derivative Jackie Collins-style potboiler with cardboard cut-outs as characters. Ignited by Kirk Douglas's terrifically brutal performance as Shields, the film is incessantly watchable - similar in structure and perspective to Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" - as the story tracks his rise to the top and fall from grace through three primary relationships - the first with Fred Amiel, a director with whom Shields partners early in their careers, the second with Georgia Lorrison, an alcoholic bit player and daughter of a Hollywood legend whom Shields grooms to become a big star, and the third with James Lee Bartlow, a writer whom Shields tries to make a screenwriter in spite of the constant interruptions by Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary.Filmed in a rich black-and-white by veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees, the film is slick and penetrating at the same time, a deep-dive character study of not only Shields but the people who come to admire his tenacity and creativity only to be betrayed by his lack of character. Composer David Raksin's music perfectly underlines the emotional pull of the movie. Minnelli has assembled a great cast to embody the story. Ever resourceful with his trademark dimpled granite chin, Douglas does not make Shields a complete villain but rather an intriguingly textured opportunist. You want to hate him but thanks to Douglas's natural charisma, you can't deny how he opened the right doors for the people around him. Ideally cast as Georgia in what is likely her career-best performance, Lana Turner is surprisingly effective in what must have been quite a stretch for her meager acting talents - from pathetic drunk to clinging starlet to haughty diva.Longtime leading man Dick Powell and familiar character actor Barry Sullivan respectively portray Bartlow and Amiel with precision and an alternating sense of brotherly obligation and resentment toward Shields. In a manner similar to the way he portrayed Ziegfeld in William Wyler's later ""Funny Girl"", Walter Pidgeon plays production executive Harry Pebbel with stentorian fervor. Aging matinee idol Gilbert Roland has an archetypal role as an actor who believes his own image as a Latin lover, and in a few brief scenes, Gloria Grahame fluidly captures Rosemary's purposeful flightiness and veiled frustration. You can even spot Beaver's mom Barbara Billingsley playing a frustrated costume designer scolding Georgia on the way she walks in her creation.Minnelli has concocted some really great scenes, especially the open-ended conclusion. The best, however, has to be when Georgia finds a tawdry starlet (played acerbically by Elaine Stewart, who much later became a game show hostess) descending the stairs at Shields' mansion at which point the fur-draped Georgia flees and drives with Hollywood-style abandon in her car. While it's fun to speculate on who is playing who within Hollywood lore, e.g., Shields as the doppelganger David O. Selznick, Georgia as Diana Barrymore (daughter of John), the characterizations are so rich that the guessing game is secondary. The DVD includes an interesting 90-minute TCM documentary on Turner, who apparently led a life more scandalous and lascivious than anyone in the movie.",5,Searing Betrayals from a Satan Incarnate in Sharp Insider's Look at Hollywood Machiavellianism,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,3501,"['Known', 'more', 'stylish', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'director', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'classic', '1952', 'melodrama', 'ruthless', 'film', 'producer', 'Jonathan', 'Shields', 'who', 'build', 'fortunes', 'legacy', 'Hollywood', 'derivative', 'Jackie', 'Collins-style', 'potboiler', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'characters', 'Ignited', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'terrifically', 'brutal', 'performance', 'Shields', 'film', 'incessantly', 'watchable', 'similar', 'structure', 'perspective', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'story', 'rise', 'top', 'fall', 'grace', 'three', 'primary', 'relationships', 'first', 'Fred', 'Amiel', 'director', 'whom', 'Shields', 'partners', 'early', 'careers', 'second', 'Georgia', 'Lorrison', 'alcoholic', 'bit', 'player', 'daughter', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'whom', 'Shields', 'grooms', 'become', 'big', 'star', 'third', 'James', 'Lee', 'Bartlow', 'writer', 'whom', 'Shields', 'make', 'screenwriter', 'spite', 'constant', 'interruptions', 'Bartlow', 'southern', 'belle', 'wife', 'Rosemary.Filmed', 'rich', 'black-and-white', 'veteran', 'cinematographer', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'film', 'slick', 'penetrating', 'same', 'time', 'deep-dive', 'character', 'study', 'not', 'only', 'Shields', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'admire', 'tenacity', 'creativity', 'only', 'be', 'betrayed', 'lack', 'character', 'Composer', 'David', 'Raksin', 'music', 'perfectly', 'emotional', 'pull', 'movie', 'Minnelli', 'assembled', 'great', 'cast', 'embody', 'story', 'Ever', 'resourceful', 'trademark', 'dimpled', 'granite', 'chin', 'Douglas', 'not', 'make', 'Shields', 'complete', 'villain', 'rather', 'intriguingly', 'textured', 'opportunist', 'want', 'hate', 'thanks', 'Douglas', 'natural', 'charisma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'how', 'opened', 'right', 'doors', 'people', 'Ideally', 'cast', 'Georgia', 'what', 'likely', 'career-best', 'performance', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'stretch', 'meager', 'acting', 'talents', 'pathetic', 'drunk', 'clinging', 'starlet', 'haughty', 'diva.Longtime', 'leading', 'man', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'familiar', 'character', 'actor', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'respectively', 'portray', 'Bartlow', 'Amiel', 'precision', 'alternating', 'sense', 'brotherly', 'obligation', 'resentment', 'Shields', 'manner', 'similar', 'way', 'portrayed', 'Ziegfeld', 'William', 'Wyler', 'later', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'production', 'executive', 'Harry', 'Pebbel', 'stentorian', 'fervor', 'Aging', 'matinee', 'idol', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'archetypal', 'role', 'actor', 'who', 'own', 'image', 'Latin', 'lover', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'fluidly', 'Rosemary', 'purposeful', 'flightiness', 'veiled', 'frustration', 'can', 'even', 'spot', 'Beaver', 'mom', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'playing', 'frustrated', 'costume', 'designer', 'scolding', 'Georgia', 'way', 'creation.Minnelli', 'concocted', 'really', 'great', 'scenes', 'especially', 'open-ended', 'conclusion', 'best', 'however', 'be', 'when', 'Georgia', 'tawdry', 'starlet', 'played', 'acerbically', 'Elaine', 'Stewart', 'who', 'much', 'later', 'became', 'game', 'show', 'hostess', 'descending', 'stairs', 'Shields', 'mansion', 'point', 'fur-draped', 'Georgia', 'flees', 'drives', 'Hollywood-style', 'abandon', 'car', 'fun', 'speculate', 'who', 'playing', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'lore', 'e.g.', 'Shields', 'doppelganger', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'Georgia', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'daughter', 'John', 'characterizations', 'are', 'so', 'rich', 'guessing', 'game', 'secondary', 'DVD', 'interesting', '90-minute', 'TCM', 'documentary', 'Turner', 'who', 'apparently', 'led', 'life', 'more', 'scandalous', 'lascivious', 'anyone', 'movie']",N/A

Even so, in 1952 it was thought of as a red-hot expose of Hollywood's more underhanded tactics, received tremendous press, and received no less than five Oscar nominations.The plot revolves around Johnathan Shields (Kirk Douglas), whose father was a much hated movie mogul and who now seeks his own career.  As it happens, however, he becomes as greatly disliked as his father.  Now down on his luck, he seeks assistance from three previous co-workers who have risen in their own careers--and they aren't at all eager to do it.  As the film progresses each of these characters recalls their experiences with Johnathan in no uncertain terms.Fred (Barry Sullivan) and Johathan were friends who struggled together in early days and became a successful director-producer team--but Johnathan backstabbed Fred, stealing his ideas to further his own career.  Georgia (Lana Turner) was an alcoholic bit player who Johnathan launched to major stardom, using her love for him as a lever to motivate her performance--but when the film was finished he brushed her off in a particularly ugly way.  James (Dick Powell) was a rising novelist lured by Johnathan to Hollywood--but when his southern belle wife Rosemary (Gloria Graham) proved a hinderence to James' work, Johnathan organized an affair for her that had tragic consequences.The characters and events that fill THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL are a movie buff's dream, for virtually everything is drawn from life.  Johnathan Shields is loosely based on producer David O. Selznick and director Fred on Val Lewton; the movie they make that launches their careers is called DOOM OF THE CAT MEN, an obvious reference to Lewton's CAT PEOPLE.  Georgia is clearly based on self-destructive actress Diana Barrymore and James on William Faulkner, with his wife Rosemary likely a reference to Zelda Fitzgerald.  Even George Cukor and Alfred and Alma Hitchcock come in for character sketches and the film makes indirect references to the productions of REBECCA and GONE WITH THE WIND.Like most films directed by Vincent Minnelli, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL is a very stylish film, smooth, slick, and ultra-glossy.  But the Minnelli style typically serves his dramas less well than his comedies and musicals; the film lacks the hard bite one would like to see in this sort of material.  The performances, however, are excellent.  Kirk Douglas seems a bit hammy at times, but it works; Lana Turner gives what may be her single finest performance--seldom thought of as a gifted actress, her suicidal meltdown while driving through a rainstorm is a revelation.  Gloria Graham, best known for her film noir films, is justly celebrated for her performance as the endearing but annoying Rosemary, and she won an Oscar for her performance.  The art direction, musical score, and all the production values are flawless.The DVD comes with several bonuses, most notably a lengthy documentary focusing on the life of Lana Turner, for whom this was something of a comeback after a period of declining popularity and film failures.  The picture is near-pristine and the sound excellent.  Although not really among the first tier of ""Hollywood on Hollywood"" movies, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL has much to recommend it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Hollywood On Hollywood: Insider Stories Thinly Veiled By Fiction,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,3510,"['1950s', 'saw', 'three', 'major', 'films', 'savaged', 'Hollywood', 'Today', 'SUNSET', 'BLVD', '1950', 'A', 'STAR', 'IS', 'BORN', '1954', 'retain', 'luster', 'continue', 'grow', 'stature', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'however', 'been', 'somewhat', 'dimmed', 'passage', 'time', 'Even', 'so', '1952', 'was', 'thought', 'red-hot', 'expose', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'underhanded', 'tactics', 'received', 'tremendous', 'press', 'received', 'less', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations.The', 'plot', 'Johnathan', 'Shields', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'father', 'was', 'much', 'hated', 'movie', 'mogul', 'who', 'now', 'own', 'career', 'however', 'as', 'greatly', 'disliked', 'father', 'Now', 'down', 'luck', 'assistance', 'three', 'previous', 'co-workers', 'who', 'have', 'risen', 'own', 'careers', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'eager', 'do', 'film', 'characters', 'recalls', 'experiences', 'Johnathan', 'uncertain', 'terms.Fred', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'Johathan', 'were', 'friends', 'who', 'struggled', 'together', 'early', 'days', 'became', 'successful', 'director-producer', 'team', 'Johnathan', 'backstabbed', 'Fred', 'stealing', 'ideas', 'further', 'own', 'career', 'Georgia', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'bit', 'player', 'who', 'Johnathan', 'launched', 'major', 'stardom', 'using', 'love', 'lever', 'motivate', 'performance', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'brushed', 'off', 'particularly', 'ugly', 'way', 'James', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'was', 'rising', 'novelist', 'lured', 'Johnathan', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'southern', 'belle', 'wife', 'Rosemary', 'Gloria', 'Graham', 'proved', 'hinderence', 'James', 'work', 'Johnathan', 'organized', 'affair', 'had', 'tragic', 'consequences.The', 'characters', 'events', 'fill', 'BAD', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'are', 'movie', 'buff', 'dream', 'virtually', 'everything', 'drawn', 'life', 'Johnathan', 'Shields', 'loosely', 'based', 'producer', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'director', 'Fred', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'movie', 'make', 'careers', 'called', 'DOOM', 'THE', 'CAT', 'MEN', 'obvious', 'reference', 'Lewton', 'CAT', 'PEOPLE', 'Georgia', 'clearly', 'based', 'self-destructive', 'actress', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'James', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'wife', 'Rosemary', 'likely', 'reference', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Even', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Alfred', 'Alma', 'Hitchcock', 'come', 'character', 'sketches', 'film', 'indirect', 'references', 'productions', 'REBECCA', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND.Like', 'most', 'films', 'directed', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'very', 'stylish', 'film', 'slick', 'ultra-glossy', 'Minnelli', 'style', 'typically', 'dramas', 'less', 'well', 'comedies', 'musicals', 'film', 'hard', 'bite', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sort', 'material', 'performances', 'however', 'are', 'excellent', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'bit', 'hammy', 'times', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'finest', 'performance', 'seldom', 'thought', 'gifted', 'actress', 'suicidal', 'meltdown', 'driving', 'rainstorm', 'revelation', 'Gloria', 'Graham', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'noir', 'films', 'justly', 'celebrated', 'performance', 'endearing', 'annoying', 'Rosemary', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'art', 'direction', 'musical', 'score', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'flawless.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'bonuses', 'most', 'notably', 'lengthy', 'documentary', 'focusing', 'life', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'whom', 'was', 'something', 'comeback', 'period', 'declining', 'popularity', 'film', 'failures', 'picture', 'near-pristine', 'sound', 'excellent', 'not', 'really', 'first', 'tier', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'much', 'recommend', 'it.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

As a movie about the movies, it is right up there with Sunset Blvd., The Player,  Swimming with Sharks, Harlow, and The Oscar. Anyway, the story line is covered elsewhere, but I had a few comments on other aspects of the film, particularly on character. First--I agree that this film contains some of Douglas' and Turner's best work. I think the pivotal scene in the film, and its emotional core, is the scene following Gloria's premiere, when she comes to Shields' mansion, only to find he has dumped her for the slutty sexpot. (This actress, and not Grahme, should have gotten the Oscar). In dismissing Gloria Lorrison, Shields reveals his vulnerability, and that his love for Gloria has, in fact, been able to reach a deep level--and for that very reason, she must be jettisoned, and he must hurt her terribly to make her leave for good. He cannot allow anyone to be that close--I only wish we knew why! But he is not named ""Shields"" accidentally: he has armored his heart, and that is why he can be so ruthless. Anyway, Douglas is brilliant in this scene, his intensity is unmatched, and one can see and feel the emotional depths he reached on a personal level. Turner follows hard-upon with her own, super-intense loss of control while careening down a rain-drenched road. Some may see these scenes as soap opera histrionics, but to me, I felt that the actors were able to portray people just breaking apart from the inside, and in a very genuine way. I found Shields to be still sympathetic until the scene where Dick Powell finds out Shields sent his distracting wife on a fatal excursion with Gaucho (NOT to have an affair, in my opinion, just to get her out of the way). He tells Powell he is better off without his wife, he should be thankful she is dead so he can do his work without her to interrupt. In this scene, Shields proves disgustingly, irredeemably heartless, as he presumes everyone else should see love as a liability, just as he does. In the end, none of the characters has ANY reason or motivation to be the slightest bit interested in Shields' proposition, and I think the last shot where they huddle around the phone is just emotionally false. I think they ought to have just kept walking, and maybe we needed a shot of Shields' face registering the weight of his irredeemable actions. And why, pray tell, was Walter Pidgeon in the role of pimp for Shields?  I think it would have been interesting to have Shields himself in this role, pitching the project, and saying, ""You all owe it to me despite what I did to you"". I think the LACK of Shields in this personal role hurts the film somewhat. No matter. This is still a great film, with a great script, and great performances.

Minelli literally showed he unknown and surreptitious passages of this industry alluding to several promising stars in previous and actual ages that you and me know but for obvious reasons must remain in discretional atmosphere.In the narrative structure of the movie we can visible analogies with Citizen Kane. Around a table we can watch the three characters who involved closer than anyone about the appetencies, emotional behavior, and intimate feature of this mighty personage His unobstructed conviction and unstoppable determination to reach the fame. Every one of them reminds and tells us in glorious flash back about the circumstances, facts and disappointments around him.Gloria Grahame's  Award has been to my mind the Award with the lesser time acting in the story of the Cinema and I guess this item has its place in Guiness. Her extremely brief appearance deserved her the Best Supporting Actress as playing the role of the devoted wife of this writer, suddenly became a scriptwriter of first range; but the personal effort of Douglas to convince Gloria (Lana Turner) to abandon her alcoholism and the sad memories of his famous father show that beneath the apparently nasty behavior of this human being, remains beneath the surface of the appearances, an obsessed man (as well as Kane with his second wife, remember?) , deeply convinced about her talent against all the odds and negative forecasts.There have been some discussed awarded performances, and to my view this was one of the most remarkable ones. Gary Cooper won and what happened with this towering acting of Douglas? It seemed that prevailed the idea that being Douglas a young actor, he would be able to win another Prize in the future; so in my humble opinion Cooper `s Prize looks like more a honest acknowledgment  for his triumphal career that the performance by itself. An analog case may be found in 1993 with Al Pacino and  Robert Downey Jr.Finally we have in this extraordinary epilogue the final result of a passionate life, extremely selfish if you want but promoter of two brilliant careers of two previously low self esteemed people who reached the fame and glory because of him.This is an excellent occasion to remind this Chinese statement: ""Everybody reminds the last favor, till it becomes the antepenultimate one""A must for you in your collection!",5,"Greed, ambition, betray and selfish!",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,2677,"['Fifties', 'interiorities', 'Industry', 'movies', 'was', 'shocked', 'three', 'remarkable', 'works', 'everyone', 'distinctive', 'trademark', 'Eve', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'bad', 'beautiful.This', 'unusual', 'film', 'Vincent', 'Minelli', 'one', 'three', 'personal', 'favorites', 'add', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Lust', 'life', 'Minelli', 'literally', 'showed', 'unknown', 'surreptitious', 'passages', 'industry', 'alluding', 'several', 'promising', 'stars', 'previous', 'actual', 'ages', 'know', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'must', 'remain', 'discretional', 'narrative', 'structure', 'movie', 'can', 'visible', 'analogies', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'table', 'can', 'watch', 'three', 'characters', 'who', 'involved', 'closer', 'anyone', 'appetencies', 'emotional', 'behavior', 'intimate', 'feature', 'mighty', 'personage', 'unobstructed', 'conviction', 'unstoppable', 'determination', 'reach', 'fame', 'one', 'reminds', 'tells', 'glorious', 'flash', 'back', 'circumstances', 'facts', 'disappointments', 'him.Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Award', 'been', 'mind', 'Award', 'lesser', 'time', 'acting', 'story', 'Cinema', 'guess', 'item', 'place', 'Guiness', 'extremely', 'brief', 'appearance', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'playing', 'role', 'devoted', 'wife', 'writer', 'suddenly', 'became', 'scriptwriter', 'first', 'range', 'personal', 'effort', 'Douglas', 'convince', 'Gloria', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'abandon', 'alcoholism', 'sad', 'memories', 'famous', 'father', 'show', 'apparently', 'nasty', 'behavior', 'human', 'being', 'surface', 'appearances', 'obsessed', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'Kane', 'second', 'wife', 'remember', 'deeply', 'convinced', 'talent', 'odds', 'negative', 'forecasts.There', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'awarded', 'performances', 'view', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'ones', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'won', 'what', 'happened', 'towering', 'acting', 'Douglas', 'seemed', 'prevailed', 'idea', 'being', 'Douglas', 'young', 'actor', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'win', 'Prize', 'future', 'so', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Cooper', 's', 'Prize', 'looks', 'more', 'honest', 'acknowledgment', 'triumphal', 'career', 'performance', 'analog', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'found', '1993', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.Finally', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'epilogue', 'final', 'result', 'passionate', 'life', 'extremely', 'selfish', 'want', 'promoter', 'two', 'brilliant', 'careers', 'two', 'previously', 'low', 'self', 'esteemed', 'people', 'who', 'reached', 'fame', 'glory', 'him.This', 'excellent', 'occasion', 'remind', 'Chinese', 'statement', 'Everybody', 'last', 'favor', 'till', 'antepenultimate', 'one', 'must', 'collection']",N/A

Maybe they couldn't get studio clearance, but once you get past the mumbo jumbo, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL contains a startling sequence which closely parallels Lewton's work on his classic feature CAT PEOPLE, credited to Jacques Tourneur.  In the BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, Barry Sullivan plays a Tourneur-like director, Fred Amiel, who tangles with an autocratic, costcutting producer (Jonathan Shields, played by Kirk Douglas).Shields bullies Amiel in the studio but teaches his one important lesson about filmmaking, namely that people are more scared about what they don't see on the screen than about what they do see.  CAT PEOPLE, with its languorous, enigmatic screenplay by the gay scenarist DeWitt Bodeen, was always about the offscreen anyhow, and Lewton (and his screen double, Jonathan Shields) could see that right away.  BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL ultimately exposes Shields as a horrid person, especially with his callousness about what happens to Gloria Grahame and Gilbert Roland, but it attempts to balance the equation by setting him off as a filmmaker of lasting distinction.  As Auden said in his contemporary poem, ""In Memory of W B Yeats,""Time that with this strange excusePardoned Kipling and his views,And will pardon Paul Claudel,Pardons him for writing well.That's my ultimate impression of THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, it takes an Audenesque and piquant view of human folly, always seeking to redress the balance by showing how one man, Kirk Douglas, might have been a bit of a dick but by God, he knew how to make movies.  The only odd thing is that Lewton was barely cold in his grave (he died in March 1951, while the Minnelli film was already premiering by Christmas 1952).  The sophisticated Lewton was born in the Ukraine, and MGM found a star of Russian descent to play him.  OK, maybe Kirk Douglas lacked a little je ne sais quoi of sophistication, but he had the power and the Promethean fire needed for the part.",5,Val Lewton Story,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2075,"['Interested', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'packed', 'one', 'extra', 'latest', 'DVD', 'set', 'Lewton', 'horror', 'films', 'RKO', 'Maybe', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'studio', 'clearance', 'once', 'get', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'startling', 'sequence', 'closely', 'Lewton', 'work', 'classic', 'feature', 'CAT', 'PEOPLE', 'credited', 'Jacques', 'Tourneur', 'BAD', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'Tourneur-like', 'director', 'Fred', 'Amiel', 'who', 'autocratic', 'costcutting', 'producer', 'Jonathan', 'Shields', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'bullies', 'Amiel', 'studio', 'one', 'important', 'lesson', 'filmmaking', 'namely', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'scared', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'screen', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'CAT', 'PEOPLE', 'languorous', 'enigmatic', 'screenplay', 'gay', 'scenarist', 'DeWitt', 'Bodeen', 'was', 'always', 'offscreen', 'anyhow', 'Lewton', 'screen', 'double', 'Jonathan', 'Shields', 'could', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'BAD', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'ultimately', 'Shields', 'horrid', 'person', 'especially', 'callousness', 'what', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'balance', 'equation', 'setting', 'off', 'filmmaker', 'lasting', 'distinction', 'Auden', 'said', 'contemporary', 'poem', 'Memory', 'W', 'B', 'Yeats', 'strange', 'excusePardoned', 'Kipling', 'views', 'will', 'pardon', 'Paul', 'Claudel', 'Pardons', 'writing', 'well.That', 'ultimate', 'impression', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'Audenesque', 'piquant', 'view', 'human', 'folly', 'always', 'seeking', 'redress', 'balance', 'showing', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'dick', 'God', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'movies', 'only', 'odd', 'thing', 'Lewton', 'was', 'barely', 'cold', 'grave', 'died', 'March', '1951', 'Minnelli', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'premiering', 'Christmas', '1952', 'sophisticated', 'Lewton', 'was', 'born', 'Ukraine', 'MGM', 'found', 'star', 'Russian', 'descent', 'play', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'lacked', 'little', 'je', 'ne', 'sais', 'quoi', 'sophistication', 'had', 'power', 'Promethean', 'fire', 'needed', 'part']",N/A

Kirk Douglas as Shields the producer is just fine. Those he uses and abuses include Lana Turner as a drunken tramp he turns into a star, William Powell as a homespun writer Shields gives the Hollywood treatment---inadvertantly causing the death of the writer's wife (a marvelous Gloria Grahame, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar) and Walter Pidgeon as a big time producer who gives Shields his first big break. The film is told in flashbacks as a now destitute Shields starts contacting these people looking for support. He made some of them what they are now---but at a costly price to their souls. Film ends with the question ""will they or won't they?"" Douglas plays Shields as a charming jerk who'll stab you in the back in a heartbeat to get what he wants. Turner is good and has a great scene where she completely freaks out behind the wheel of her car after discovering what a lowlife Shields really is, nearly killing herself and God knows who else. And Grahame is delightful as Powell's Southern fried wife who perhaps is a bit too helpful and winds up a victim of Shield's plot to keep Powell under his thumb.

Kirk Douglas is a has-been producer whose hard luck has cost him some serious alliances in the industry.  The star, Lana Turner, the screenwriter, George Murphy and the director, Dick Powell are the people done wrong. Walter Pigeon is the man in the mogul's chair, trying to get Kirk his last big break. Plenty of on-screen chemistry, tension and great casting make this film an outstanding drama.Warner Home Video's DVD is both bad and beautiful in terms of its picture quality.  We get a very nice, smooth looking transfer with much of the film grain and age related artifacts cleaned up.  But there are moments where edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are so bad, you just can't help but get distracted away from the fine performances taking place underneath all that digital mess. When the image is free from these anamolies, contrast and black levels are superb.  The audio, mono, is potent, powerful and masterfully recreated.EXTRAS: Lana Turner: A Daughter Remembers, is the brilliant documentary featured on TCM.  It's intense, investigatory and blindingly original, following Turner's rise from starlet to superstar.  Also, isolated music cues and the film's original trailer.BOTTOM LINE: The actual film print, for the above mentioned reasons, is disappointing, though it looks better than it ever has before.

144673,A2T0L6RPRVP3UC,0792840038,Nobody,"[3, 4]","`The Bad And The Beautiful' (1952) was directed by Vincente Minnelli between two of his greatest and best loved musicals `The Bandwagon' (1951) and `An American In Paris' (1953). He had directed other great films such as `Meet Me In St. Louis' (1944) and `Father Of The Bride' (1950) before attempting his dramatic take on the Hollywood Studio system. Making films about Hollywood was nothing new when Minnelli made `The Bad And the Beautiful'. Only a couple years earlier there was `All About Eve' (1950), `Sunset Boulevard' (1950) and `A Star Is Born' in 1937. This may be part of the reason why this film is not so highly regarded, however there are other reasons too.The fact that `The Bad And The Beautiful' is regarded as film noir probably has more to do with the cast which featured: Lana Turner (The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946); Kirk Douglas (Out Of The Past, 1947); Dick Powell (Farewell My Lovely, 1944) Gloria Grahame (The Big Heat, 1953) all of whom had starred important noir pictures. Structurally the film is comprised of three flashbacks and uses voiceover frequently to tell its tale, which is all key noir techniques.I think the film says more about Vincente Minnelli and the changes that were taking place in the worldwide film industry at the time. The studio system, which Minnelli was very a part of, was coming to an end and being replaced by Auteur theory. Films were moving away from studio sets towards location shooting with directors having a lot more control and authorship over their production. The three flashbacks in `The Bad And The Beautiful' I think represents the divisions in the studio system at the time of writer, actor and director battling with a producer and with any attempt to overstep that mark resulting in a rebuff or failure. Within six years the New Wave would abolish those ideas.I think `The Bad And The Beautiful' had potential to be a great film but is let down by melodrama and some lacklustre acting, character development and direction. It also lacks some of the real grit and cynicism of  `All About Eve' or `Sunset Boulevard'. However there are some great moments such as Lana Turner's automotive suicide attempt, which I believe to be the great sequence in the film, but overall I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a lot more. Yet overall I think it's worth seeing at least once.Other films with similar themes worth seeing also include Nicholas Ray's `In A Lonely Place' (1950) and `Le Mepris' (1963) by Jean-Luc Godard. I think Minnelli will and should be remembered for his musicals, which are superb.",4,It could have been much better,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2588,"['Bad', 'Beautiful', '1952', 'was', 'directed', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'two', 'greatest', 'best', 'loved', 'musicals', 'Bandwagon', '1951', 'American', 'Paris', '1953', 'had', 'directed', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'such', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', '1944', 'Father', 'Bride', '1950', 'attempting', 'dramatic', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'Studio', 'system', 'Making', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'when', 'Minnelli', 'made', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'Only', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', 'there', 'was', 'Eve', '1950', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', '1950', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', '1937', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'however', 'are', 'other', 'reasons', 'too.The', 'fact', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'regarded', 'film', 'noir', 'probably', 'more', 'do', 'cast', 'featured', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', '1946', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Out', 'Past', '1947', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Lovely', '1944', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Big', 'Heat', '1953', 'whom', 'had', 'starred', 'important', 'noir', 'pictures', 'Structurally', 'film', 'comprised', 'three', 'flashbacks', 'voiceover', 'frequently', 'tell', 'tale', 'key', 'noir', 'techniques.I', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'changes', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'worldwide', 'film', 'industry', 'time', 'studio', 'system', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'very', 'part', 'was', 'coming', 'end', 'being', 'replaced', 'Auteur', 'theory', 'Films', 'were', 'moving', 'away', 'studio', 'sets', 'towards', 'location', 'shooting', 'directors', 'having', 'lot', 'more', 'control', 'authorship', 'production', 'three', 'flashbacks', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'think', 'divisions', 'studio', 'system', 'time', 'writer', 'actor', 'director', 'battling', 'producer', 'attempt', 'overstep', 'mark', 'resulting', 'rebuff', 'failure', 'six', 'years', 'New', 'Wave', 'would', 'abolish', 'ideas.I', 'think', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'let', 'down', 'melodrama', 'lacklustre', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'direction', 'also', 'real', 'grit', 'cynicism', 'Eve', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'However', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'such', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'automotive', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'believe', 'be', 'great', 'sequence', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'overall', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once.Other', 'films', 'similar', 'themes', 'worth', 'seeing', 'also', 'include', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'A', 'Lonely', 'Place', '1950', 'Le', 'Mepris', '1963', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'think', 'Minnelli', 'will', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'musicals', 'are', 'superb']",N/A

The cover with pictures of Turner and Douglas, plus the name, gave me the idea this would be a dark film noir with some wild romance.  Well, there was some romance but mostly it's a story about the film industry in the 1950's.  The main character, played by Douglas, is an extremely charming and ambitious film producer who managed to rub a few of his working partners the wrong way.It's a very well made film and entertaining to watch, from beginning to the end.  The casting is great.  I had never seen Kirk Douglas in his early years--only saw ads for him in things like Spartacus, that didn't interest me.  I had no idea he was so charming!  He was very funny, lively, and of course, terrifically good looking.  He made his character, who is supposed to be the ""Bad"" one, to be awfully sympathetic---maybe too much for the script.The others are good enough but no one shines like Douglas. It's worth it to see for his presence.  Lana Turner is as beautiful as a cream puff but with not much more excitement.  (No wonder the Douglas character dumped her.) William Powell is interesting as the dour academic who goes Hollywood.  Gloria Grahame is perky and pretty as his Southern belle wife who distracts him more than she helps him.  I didn't consider it an Oscar winning performance but maybe there were no better actresses competing for the honor that year.The film is really much better than it should be considering the silliness of the story.

Overall I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Where I felt it came up short was in the character development and comparison.  Yes, this is the story of a driven man, Jonathon Shields (played by Kirk Douglas), and how he rubs everyone else the wrong way.  It means to show that their anger and resentment overshadowed the many positive ways he affected their lives.  That makes for a good outline for a movie.  However, two of the other four characters had wanted to do things their way and were primarily mad at Jonathon Shields for having it his way.  The other two characters, played by Lana Turner and Dick Powell, were people who would not have risen as high as they did without the drive and determination that Shields instilled in them.  I found it hard to sympathize with either of the other four for because of that.  Actually, the characters of interest were those played by Gilbert Rolland and Gloria Grahame.  They were opposites in their own way; one living life on the edge and the other coming wide-eyed out of a small Southern town into the wilds of Hollywood.  Their brief scenes were the proper seasoning the rest of the cast failed to bring.  I guess that explains Grahame's Best Supporting Actress Oscar in her rather brief appearances.  It wasn't so much how well she played her role but how well that role played against the other roles in the movie.Hollywood likes to make movies about Hollywood.  ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" is one of the better such productions (although it is no ""Sunset Boulevard"").  The best acting is that of Kirk Douglas who was great so long as he didn't lose his temper.  It may seem to be about a world that's completely different from our own.  However, most of us may have had a person in our past like the character of Jonathon Shields.

And thanks to a tightly written script and wonderful direction by Vincent Minnelli, its ensemble of actors provides two hours of entertainment that seldom seems dated or over-baked - at least it's pretty easy to suspend your disbelief.Kirk Douglas and Lana Turner are just fine as a self-serving movie producer and a would-be star with low self-esteem and a drinking problem.

144680,A37S3ACL57LN62,0792840038,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[11, 14]","The Bad and the Beautiful is a commentary on Hollywood. It is considered to be a film noir because it is told in flashback with voice over and it involves imperfect characters. However, there is more of an element of soap opera than there is of film noir outside of the stereotypical pieces.Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) is a movie mogul, a producer who like most big businessmen stepped on as many people as he could to get where he wanted to be. First was a friend, a director (Barry Sullivan) who he teams up with to make B pictures. There are obvious parallels between him and Val Lewton. Next was a woman, the daughter of a great star who feels she will never live up to his reputation (Lana Turner). Shields helps her to become a major star, but with consequence. Last is a writer (Dick Powell), a man who lived happily with his southern belle wife (Gloria Grahame) at home and stumbled upon success. Shields brought him to Hollywood to be a screenwriter for him, but also got rid of his happy distractions.The performances are wonderful. Douglas is in top form, a slimy, manipulative man who charms his audience to like him despite all he has done. His best scenes are those with Turner, who is questionable here. She begins playing a woman whose acting isn't up to par and it seems she feels she should play everything at that stage badly. Her lines seem artificial and forced, and instead of appearing innocent, she seems whiney and melodramatic. Later, when her character learns to act and is transformed by love, Turner is wonderful! She creates a peak of intensity in each scene that never becomes boring. Perhaps she did this for effect, as it is obvious Turner was a good actress, but it does not come across as obvious. Only a person who really thought about the part would understand, and most people will not do that. Powell plays his part in a deadpan, which some people will like and some people will not. As there are many people in the world like his character, it is certainly appropriate, but it is also hard to warm up to such a person. He is however in great contrast to Douglas and Grahame, the only Oscar winning performance in the film.There are plenty of allusions to real life movie people, but not all of them are obvious. It is fun to try to guess who is playing who and how much of the story is truth.Also included on this DVD is a documentary about Lana Turner. It features plenty of footage with her daughter Cheryl Crane including some strange reenactments about her childhood. Also interviewed are Jackie Cooper, Robert Stack, Evie Wynn Johnson, Del Armstrong, Kirk Douglas, Glenn Rose, and Juanita Moore. Clips from her first movies, Ziegfeld Girl, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Homecoming, The Bad and the Beautiful, The Merry Widow, Peyton Place, Imitation of Like, and Madame X are shown. It talks about her husbands, friends, life in films, and the impact her daughter had on her life.

Kirk Douglas stars as Johnathan Shields, a B movie producer,who lets nothing stand in his way to getting to the top. The story focuses on the people he uses along the way. Mr. Douglas gives one of the best performances of his career as the ruthless Shields. Lana Turner as the alcoholicGeorgia gives one of her better performances than the usual window dressing she was repeatedly used for. Dick Powell and Gloria Grahame are the two to watch though.Always an asset to any film, Gloria's performance as the flighty Rosemary who's willing to do anything to rub elbows with celebrities, won her the 1952 oscar for best supporting actress. Walter Pidgeon,one of my favorites, is very good as the head of the studio. Gilbert Roland and the underrated Barry Sullivan are excellent in supporting roles. Also in a small part the very glamorous and very beautiful Elaine Stewart. Why she never became a better known star is beyond me. Her screen presence alone is very striking.

144686,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,0792840038,William Hare,"[1, 2]","The deft hand of master director Vincente Minnelli was clearly visible in this rapidly paced scorcher about Hollywood.  Minnelli had a master cast which was put to adroit use to carve out a memorable gem.The film is seen through the viewpoint and career experiences of a highly complicated genius producer played by Kirk Douglas with a penchant for using people and getting them extremely angry at him.  Finally his tricks have placed him on Hollywood's backburner as he seeks one more chance to produce a film based on an idea he believes cannot miss.The irony of the film is that, yes, the major Hollywood figures who despise him had been mistreated, but the connection to Douglas propelled all of them to the heights.  Lana Turner was romanced by Douglas and discarded, but he launched her toward superstar status.  Barry Sullivan had worked as a faithful and career cautious assistant under Douglas, was doublecrossed,  then went out and achieved fame as a director on his own.  He arranged an extramarital foray between Dick Powell's meddlesome wife, Gloria Grahame, with lothario actor Gilbert Roland so that Powell can fully concentrate on a screenplay assignment for Douglas.  Their rendezvous ends in the tragic plane crash deaths of Grahame and Roland.  Powell then goes on to establish a career as an Oscar-winning scenarist after a life as a literature professor and novelist.Walter Pidgeon is the experienced studio head who, through fascinating flashbacks, recounts the experiences of Douglas and his celebrated contacts.  Just before Fadeout he has succeeded in arousing their collective curiosity as they agree to talk to Douglas on the phone about his project.John Houseman produced this celebrated film, which won 5 Oscars, including Gloria Grahame for Best Supporting Actress and Charles Schnee for Best Original Screenplay.",5,A Great Film about Hollywood,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,1843,"['deft', 'hand', 'master', 'director', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'was', 'clearly', 'visible', 'rapidly', 'paced', 'scorcher', 'Hollywood', 'Minnelli', 'had', 'master', 'cast', 'was', 'put', 'adroit', 'use', 'carve', 'out', 'memorable', 'gem.The', 'film', 'seen', 'viewpoint', 'career', 'experiences', 'highly', 'complicated', 'genius', 'producer', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'penchant', 'using', 'people', 'getting', 'extremely', 'angry', 'Finally', 'tricks', 'have', 'placed', 'Hollywood', 'backburner', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'produce', 'film', 'based', 'idea', 'can', 'not', 'miss.The', 'irony', 'film', 'yes', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'figures', 'who', 'despise', 'had', 'been', 'mistreated', 'connection', 'Douglas', 'propelled', 'heights', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'was', 'romanced', 'Douglas', 'discarded', 'launched', 'superstar', 'status', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'had', 'worked', 'faithful', 'career', 'cautious', 'assistant', 'Douglas', 'was', 'doublecrossed', 'then', 'went', 'achieved', 'fame', 'director', 'own', 'arranged', 'extramarital', 'foray', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'meddlesome', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'lothario', 'actor', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'Powell', 'can', 'fully', 'concentrate', 'screenplay', 'assignment', 'Douglas', 'rendezvous', 'ends', 'tragic', 'plane', 'crash', 'deaths', 'Grahame', 'Roland', 'Powell', 'then', 'establish', 'career', 'Oscar-winning', 'scenarist', 'life', 'literature', 'professor', 'novelist.Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'experienced', 'studio', 'head', 'who', 'fascinating', 'flashbacks', 'experiences', 'Douglas', 'celebrated', 'contacts', 'Just', 'Fadeout', 'succeeded', 'arousing', 'collective', 'curiosity', 'agree', 'talk', 'Douglas', 'phone', 'project.John', 'Houseman', 'produced', 'celebrated', 'film', 'won', '5', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Charles', 'Schnee', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay']",N/A

I watched this after monitoring a Facebook discussion about the two films.  Both films are about the darker side of the film business (go figure) but clearly have different moral compasses.I've always enjoyed watching pairs of old films that are different versions of the same story or theme explored by the same players.  This is a good pair to watch and compare.  I particularly enjoyed the 'car crash' scenes.
