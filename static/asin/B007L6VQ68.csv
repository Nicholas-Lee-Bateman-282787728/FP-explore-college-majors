I fell in love with him and his character Loki somewhere between &#34;Thor&#34; and &#34;The Avengers.&#34;  Tom's Loki was brilliant and intelligent.  I wondered what else Tom was capable of doing.  Many actors tend to act very similiar in most, if not, all of their roles.  Owen Wilson and Sandra Bullock come to mind.Tom was superb in this role.  I never once thought of Loki.  All of these characters were deep.  Rachel Weisz was brilliant.  I felt her love for Freddie, her pain of leaving her husband, her heart breaking in the end.  Simon Russell Beale was no slouch either.  When you can empathize with characters in a movie, you know the acting is excellent.  Most of us have had deep loves in our life that simply didn't work out.  I love when Hester draws the curtains open in the end.

In one camp are those who have been in hopeless love situations and appreciate this faithful recreation of it here. On the other, are those who find the unrelieved misery depicted devoid of entertainment value.Rachel Weisz plays this woman who seemingly lives on knife's edge of suicidal despair.  She is very good playing her but it is a role I would not have otherwise pictured her in as she herself is quite robust and bold in her other roles and in life. So I suppose she has really shown her range of ability by playing this role.  She is a big, big talent,However, all this said, it is hard to develop either sympathy or empathy for her character or for the men in the story. She is incredibly passive,  She is also very idle and cannot rouse herself to care about anything but her love life.  I realize this is set back in time but still there were women who managed to rise above their love disappointments and do things with their lives to make them worthwhile. I would hazard a guess that there were a lot of women in England at that time who had married out of duty rather than love so she was hardly alone in her status. And one can reasonably bet that these women did not mostly look like the beautiful Rachel Weisz.Another viewer mentions the screeching violin over the opening of the film and I too wondered how this melodramatic overkill had made it into a quality feature film.  It goes on and on and on until you feel like shouting, ""Enough.""I have spent most of my viewing life preferring art house and film festival fare. In Bergman's hands, for example, you felt art triumph over sad subject matter such as in the classic WILD STRAWBERRIES.

1533351,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007L6VQ68,C. Sawin,"[31, 46]","Set in the 1950s, The Deep Blue Sea is the story of Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz). When you're first introduced to her, she's seen recovering from a suicide attempt and it's slowly revealed that she's torn between two lovers. She was originally married to the wealthy High Court judge Sir William Collyer (Simon Russell Beale), but was cheating on him with the careless former Royal Air Force pilot Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston). Hess had a mutual affection for Collyer, but fell into deep, passionate love with Freddie. Now on a path that will lead her to her own self destruction, Hess now finds herself at a crossroads that even she has difficulty deciding which direction to travel down next.The frustrating thing about The Deep Blue Sea is that it takes about thirty to forty minutes to fully grasp the story the film is trying to tell. The romantic drama is mostly told through a series of flashbacks, but it's frequently difficult to distinguish what happened in the past and what's currently happening in the present. As the film progresses and Hess is shown with Collyer right after just having an argument with Freddie, things become a bit easier to process. Earlier on though, especially when Hess is first getting up and around after her suicide attempt is when you feel kind of lost.Part of me thought the entire film was going to be Rachel Weisz standing in front of a curtained window smoking the entire time and in a way it kind of was. There was suicide, cheating, and a really stuffy and uptight woman (Collyer's mom played by Barbara Jefford) that you wanted to slap for being so obnoxious, but the entire point seemed lost. It all doesn't really click until Collyer walks in on Hess' phone call with Freddie, the car ride Hess and Collyer share immediately after, and the scene where Freddie finds the letter in Hess' pocket.Even though the film itself didn't exactly sit well with me, the performances didn't make up for the film's shortcomings but were easily the most enjoyable aspect. The three individuals involved in the love triangle are downright exceptional at times. They're all capable of telling the story of the film with that look of despair in their eyes; that one that looks like they're about to burst into tears but the men never do.The relationship between Hess and Collyer reminded me of a former relationship my mom had where someone was so deeply in love with her, but she just didn't feel the same way about him. She had a fondness for him and cared about him, but didn't love him in that way. Simon Russell Beale does a really fantastic job portraying a man just trying to wrap his head around that. Freddie is a man who enjoys drinking too much, is a bit too proud of his accomplishments as a pilot, and a jokester with an immature sense of humor. He's very passionate about everything that he does and Tom Hiddleston does a great job bringing all of that out on-screen. His outbursts were some of the highlights of the film.The real treasure in the film though is Rachel Weisz. I can honestly say that I've never seen a better performance from her. She wants to make it work with Freddie so bad, but at the same time doesn't enjoy being the cause of Collyer's anger and sorrow. Weisz's facial expressions give life to the emotional game of tug of war she's putting herself though more than simple words ever actually could. It all masterfully comes together in the final scene of the film where Weisz finally breaks down and the amount of despair that she feels drops down on your chest like a 35-pound cinder block.It seemed like every sound effect used in the film was being done into a tin can. Spoken dialogue sounded fine, but every sound had this echo effect to it. Doors being shut were the biggest offenders, but the scene at Collyer's mother's house where they're eating supper was littered with the noises of utensils being used that seemed too loud or there was too much of an emphasis on them or something.The Deep Blue Sea was not meshing well with my cinematical tastes and opinions when it first began. Its disjointed technique of storytelling took some getting used to. However once things got going the film reminded me of my life back in 2007 as I watched my mom go through something similar. While it was honestly one of the worst times of either of our lives, it made it easier to connect to the characters in the film and understand what they were going through. Rachel Weisz has never been better as The Deep Blue Sea is her best performance to date. At the end of the day, The Deep Blue Sea is worth giving a chance based on Weisz's performance alone.",2,Disjointed with fantastic performances,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,4620,"['Set', '1950s', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'story', 'Hester', 'Collyer', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'When', ""'re"", 'first', 'introduced', 'seen', 'recovering', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'torn', 'two', 'lovers', 'was', 'originally', 'married', 'wealthy', 'High', 'Court', 'judge', 'Sir', 'William', 'Collyer', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'was', 'cheating', 'careless', 'former', 'Royal', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', 'Freddie', 'Page', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Hess', 'had', 'mutual', 'affection', 'Collyer', 'fell', 'deep', 'passionate', 'love', 'Freddie', 'Now', 'path', 'will', 'lead', 'own', 'self', 'destruction', 'Hess', 'now', 'crossroads', 'even', 'difficulty', 'deciding', 'direction', 'travel', 'down', 'next.The', 'frustrating', 'thing', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'thirty', 'forty', 'minutes', 'fully', 'grasp', 'story', 'film', 'trying', 'tell', 'romantic', 'drama', 'mostly', 'told', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'frequently', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'present', 'film', 'progresses', 'Hess', 'shown', 'Collyer', 'right', 'just', 'having', 'argument', 'Freddie', 'things', 'become', 'bit', 'easier', 'process', 'Earlier', 'especially', 'when', 'Hess', 'first', 'getting', 'up', 'around', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'when', 'feel', 'kind', 'lost.Part', 'thought', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'standing', 'front', 'curtained', 'window', 'smoking', 'entire', 'time', 'way', 'kind', 'was', 'was', 'suicide', 'cheating', 'really', 'stuffy', 'uptight', 'woman', 'Collyer', 'mom', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'wanted', 'slap', 'being', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'entire', 'point', 'seemed', 'lost', ""n't"", 'really', 'click', 'Collyer', 'walks', 'Hess', 'phone', 'call', 'Freddie', 'car', 'ride', 'Hess', 'Collyer', 'share', 'immediately', 'scene', 'where', 'Freddie', 'letter', 'Hess', 'pocket.Even', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sit', 'well', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'were', 'easily', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'three', 'individuals', 'involved', 'love', 'triangle', 'are', 'downright', 'exceptional', 'times', ""'re"", 'capable', 'telling', 'story', 'film', 'look', 'despair', 'eyes', 'one', ""'re"", 'burst', 'tears', 'men', 'never', 'do.The', 'relationship', 'Hess', 'Collyer', 'reminded', 'former', 'relationship', 'mom', 'had', 'where', 'someone', 'was', 'so', 'deeply', 'love', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'had', 'fondness', 'cared', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'way', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'really', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'just', 'trying', 'wrap', 'head', 'Freddie', 'man', 'who', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'bit', 'too', 'proud', 'accomplishments', 'pilot', 'jokester', 'immature', 'sense', 'humor', 'very', 'passionate', 'everything', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'on-screen', 'outbursts', 'were', 'highlights', 'film.The', 'real', 'treasure', 'film', 'though', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'better', 'performance', 'make', 'work', 'Freddie', 'so', 'bad', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'being', 'cause', 'Collyer', 'anger', 'sorrow', 'Weisz', 'facial', 'expressions', 'give', 'life', 'emotional', 'game', 'tug', 'war', 'putting', 'more', 'simple', 'words', 'ever', 'actually', 'could', 'masterfully', 'together', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Weisz', 'finally', 'down', 'amount', 'despair', 'drops', 'down', 'chest', '35-pound', 'cinder', 'block.It', 'seemed', 'sound', 'effect', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'tin', 'can', 'Spoken', 'dialogue', 'sounded', 'fine', 'sound', 'had', 'echo', 'effect', 'Doors', 'being', 'shut', 'were', 'biggest', 'offenders', 'scene', 'Collyer', 'mother', 'house', 'where', ""'re"", 'eating', 'supper', 'was', 'littered', 'noises', 'utensils', 'being', 'used', 'seemed', 'too', 'loud', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'something.The', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'was', 'not', 'meshing', 'well', 'cinematical', 'tastes', 'opinions', 'when', 'first', 'began', 'disjointed', 'technique', 'storytelling', 'took', 'getting', 'used', 'However', 'once', 'things', 'got', 'going', 'film', 'reminded', 'life', 'back', '2007', 'watched', 'mom', 'go', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'honestly', 'one', 'worst', 'times', 'lives', 'made', 'easier', 'connect', 'characters', 'film', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'end', 'day', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'worth', 'giving', 'chance', 'based', 'Weisz', 'performance', 'alone']",N/A

However it turns out to be a disappointment.  This is chiefly due to a lack of sympathy with the characters: we do not really understand why Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz) should feel as she does, while Tom Hiddleston as Freddie Page is badly miscast.  He seems to be under the impression that shouting will reveal the character's inadequacies.  Simon Russell Beale is quite good as Hester's husband, but even he doesn't really have much to do.  The film also represents an uneasy mix of Davies' and Rattigan's concerns; there are new musical sequences inserted (for example, a scene in a local pub, and a flashback to wartime London) which have strong echoes of Davies' earlier work (THE LONG DAY CLOSES comes to mind), but which deflect attention away from Rattigan's character-driven piece.

1533370,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B007L6VQ68,Jem,"[39, 41]","I admit that I fully expected this film to be boring. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find it not only engaging, but the first film I have seen about an adulterous affair that I think actually qualified as a love story. Yes, the film is very slow. But I never found it boring. That is largely due to the powerful performances of the three main actors: Weisz, Hiddleston and Beale.  They captivate from the first to the last.The film has an unusual structure that works well for the themes explored.  It opens with Hester about to commit suicide, and recalling via flashback what transpired to get her to this point.  Like true memories, they don't necessarily come in clearly, or in order, and it can be challenging for a viewer to follow at first.  The movie is ostensibly about the affair between Hester and Freddie, but also subtly addresses the mystery of depression to those who have never experienced it, and cannot understand it. Hester's husband loves her; they have money and privilege, yet she is painfully unhappy because they are no more than friends.  Along comes Freddie who, after surviving the Battle of Britain, is living life to the fullest with little thought for tomorrow - and she falls in love for the first time in her life.  But, Freddie is unable to give her everything she needs either.  It would have been easy to make Freddie the ""villain"" here, and I am glad the director did not.  Freddie is insensitive and occasionally cruel to Hester.  Yet, he never misled her on who he is, or what he could be for her.  He is as trapped in his life as she in hers.  One scene in the museum shows that she can be cruel to him in turn.  Hester is caught between two men: one she cares for, respects and enjoys as an intellectual companion, and one who gives her the passion and joy she has been missing.  With such a disastrous set-up, I was somewhat amazed that the film ended with a note of hope.The film is beautiful to look at - visually lush and very appropriate to the time period.  And the score fits so perfectly it actually tells the story for long stretches when there is little dialog.  This is not an ""entertaining"" film in the traditional sense, and those looking for escapism will probably be disappointed.  Yet, it is a very moving film about love, rebellion, and finding oneself.  I enjoyed it immensely and will watch it again.The extras are also quite good for an indie film.  They include an interview with Weisz, and one with Hiddleston.  But, the two featurettes were the most interesting.  Terence Davies' Master Class, in which he spends about an hour addressing what looks to be an actual class of students, was superb - delving into his motivations, the actual process of how he directs, what he felt about certain scenes, and the actors.  This would be of particular interest to film students, even if the film is not their cup of tea.  The DVD also includes director commentary of the film, but I personally don't like those. Overall, 4.5 stars, and it has encouraged me to look for other films by this director.",5,"Slow, intimate, beautiful and sad",1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,3057,"['admit', 'fully', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'boring', 'So', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'engaging', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'think', 'actually', 'qualified', 'love', 'story', 'Yes', 'film', 'very', 'slow', 'never', 'found', 'boring', 'largely', 'due', 'powerful', 'performances', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'Weisz', 'Hiddleston', 'Beale', 'captivate', 'first', 'last.The', 'film', 'unusual', 'structure', 'well', 'themes', 'explored', 'Hester', 'commit', 'suicide', 'recalling', 'flashback', 'what', 'transpired', 'get', 'point', 'true', 'memories', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'come', 'clearly', 'order', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'viewer', 'follow', 'first', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'affair', 'Hester', 'Freddie', 'also', 'subtly', 'mystery', 'depression', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'Hester', 'husband', 'have', 'money', 'privilege', 'painfully', 'unhappy', 'are', 'more', 'friends', 'Freddie', 'who', 'surviving', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'little', 'thought', 'tomorrow', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Freddie', 'unable', 'give', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'make', 'Freddie', 'villain', 'here', 'am', 'glad', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'Freddie', 'insensitive', 'occasionally', 'cruel', 'Hester', 'never', 'misled', 'who', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'trapped', 'life', 'hers', 'One', 'scene', 'museum', 'can', 'be', 'cruel', 'turn', 'Hester', 'caught', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'respects', 'intellectual', 'companion', 'one', 'who', 'passion', 'joy', 'been', 'missing', 'disastrous', 'set-up', 'was', 'somewhat', 'amazed', 'film', 'ended', 'note', 'hope.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'visually', 'lush', 'very', 'appropriate', 'time', 'period', 'score', 'fits', 'so', 'perfectly', 'actually', 'story', 'long', 'stretches', 'when', 'little', 'dialog', 'not', 'entertaining', 'film', 'traditional', 'sense', 'looking', 'escapism', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'love', 'rebellion', 'finding', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'will', 'watch', 'again.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'indie', 'film', 'include', 'interview', 'Weisz', 'one', 'Hiddleston', 'two', 'featurettes', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'Terence', 'Davies', 'Master', 'Class', 'hour', 'addressing', 'what', 'be', 'actual', 'class', 'students', 'was', 'superb', 'delving', 'motivations', 'actual', 'process', 'how', 'what', 'felt', 'about', 'certain', 'scenes', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'particular', 'interest', 'film', 'students', 'even', 'film', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'DVD', 'also', 'director', 'commentary', 'film', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Overall', '4.5', 'stars', 'encouraged', 'look', 'other', 'films', 'director']",N/A

After seeing it, I find this reviewer falls somewhere between the extremes of praise and criticism.First, the performances cannot be overpraised, especially that of Rachel Weisz as Hester - which is a good thing, because compelling performances are critical to staying engaged with what was, ultimately, an oddly unsatisfying experience. Nor did I find it objectionably slow, as many have felt, nor did the excerpts from Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto bother me as they did some other reviewers. What was unsatisfying was the lack of connective character development - the unsatisfied younger wife of a stolid older man is hardly a new plot device. But we have no information on why the young and restless Hester married the boring, if loving William, and Rattigan stacks the deck with the vile mother in law. In novels such as, for example, The Forsyte Saga, there is time to find out why Irene marries Soames, although she is well aware that she does not love him and perhaps can never love him. Anna Karenina also explores this theme. But in post-war Britain, why would a beautiful young woman marry so much older and duller a man? There may be good answers to this, but the viewer is not provided with them. There are too many gaps: we see Freddie (Tom Hiddleston) telling Hester she's the most attractive girl he's met - we don't even know where they are when this occurs, although we can presume it's her husband's country home. The next thing we know, they are hot and naked in the clinches . . .There is simply not enough connectives to make the story anything but a sort of morality tale of repressed English society, restless young women married to the wrong men, and devilishly attractive lovers who can't quite go the distance.It is well done, the production is fine, the performances beyond reproach - but the whole can't get to memorable because of the sketchiness of the story. I have not read Rattigan's play, so perhaps Davies' screenplay is the culprit here; however,  I have his ""Of Time and the City"" and thought it wonderful.I found Galsworthy's tale of the tragic marriage between Irene and Soames Forsyte more compelling, ditto the more recent ""Hattie"" , which has the unsatisfied middle-aged woman married to the unexciting man coming to grief over the devilishly attractive younger man.I won't say this isn't worth seeing: these are first-class actors doing a first-rate job; but somehow the piece does not rise to become more than the sum of its parts.",3,"Compelling Performances, Sketchy Plot",1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2603,"['was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'reading', 'wide', 'range', 'reviews', 'admire', 'work', 'Weisz', 'Hiddleston', 'seeing', 'find', 'reviewer', 'somewhere', 'extremes', 'praise', 'criticism.First', 'performances', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overpraised', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Hester', 'good', 'thing', 'compelling', 'performances', 'are', 'critical', 'staying', 'engaged', 'what', 'was', 'ultimately', 'oddly', 'unsatisfying', 'experience', 'did', 'find', 'objectionably', 'slow', 'many', 'have', 'felt', 'did', 'excerpts', 'Samuel', 'Barber', 'Violin', 'Concerto', 'bother', 'did', 'other', 'reviewers', 'What', 'was', 'unsatisfying', 'was', 'lack', 'connective', 'character', 'development', 'unsatisfied', 'younger', 'wife', 'stolid', 'older', 'man', 'hardly', 'new', 'plot', 'device', 'have', 'information', 'why', 'young', 'restless', 'Hester', 'married', 'boring', 'loving', 'William', 'Rattigan', 'deck', 'vile', 'mother', 'law', 'novels', 'such', 'example', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Irene', 'Soames', 'well', 'aware', 'not', 'love', 'perhaps', 'can', 'never', 'love', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'also', 'theme', 'post-war', 'Britain', 'why', 'would', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'marry', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'duller', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'answers', 'viewer', 'not', 'provided', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'see', 'Freddie', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'telling', 'Hester', 'most', 'attractive', 'girl', 'met', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'when', 'can', 'presume', 'husband', 'country', 'home', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'hot', 'naked', 'clinches', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'connectives', 'make', 'story', 'anything', 'sort', 'morality', 'tale', 'repressed', 'English', 'society', 'restless', 'young', 'women', 'married', 'wrong', 'men', 'devilishly', 'attractive', 'lovers', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'distance.It', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'fine', 'performances', 'reproach', 'whole', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'memorable', 'sketchiness', 'story', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Rattigan', 'play', 'perhaps', 'Davies', 'screenplay', 'culprit', 'here', 'however', 'have', 'Time', 'City', 'thought', 'found', 'Galsworthy', 'tale', 'tragic', 'marriage', 'Irene', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'more', 'compelling', 'ditto', 'more', 'recent', 'Hattie', 'unsatisfied', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'married', 'unexciting', 'man', 'coming', 'grief', 'devilishly', 'attractive', 'younger', 'man.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'first-class', 'actors', 'doing', 'first-rate', 'job', 'somehow', 'piece', 'not', 'rise', 'become', 'more', 'sum', 'parts']",N/A

I feel as though I am sitting in the theater watching the actors circle one another in a tightly reined production. It's glorious. There are scenes that I thought could have been paintings or sculptures, capturing the moment in three or four frames. The post-coital shots are works of art. Great direction. Cinematography is also good. From pub scenes to bombed-out rubble playgrounds to the sadly shabby apartment where the lovers live, all is compact and richly detailed. Contrary to some reviews I've read here, the story is not about an adulterous affair that ends badly. It's a love story. These people hurt each other. Hester loves her husband and she loves Freddie, but she hurts them. And vice versa. It's not that they do not love each other; they do. But each one is inadequate in fulfilling the other's desires, expectations. Listen carefully to Hester's dialogue about what love means to her. That's pretty much the conflict in the story. It's a beautiful story and rings true as bells. That was Rattigan's magic.But the triumph of the film is in the performances. Rachel Weisz is magnificent. Breath-taking. The camera captures every measured gesture, every shift in expression, every subtle movement; we know we are seeing an actress at the top of her game. If she didn't win an award for this role, she should have.  Simon Russell Beale's performance as the staid, respectable, impeccable judge is a masterwork in his long resume of great performances. I wanted to slap his silly, vapid face. I wanted to cry for him. Tom Hiddleston shows here why he is remarked to be one of the best actors of our day. His Freddie is wonderful. The character is a WWII decorated flyboy whose clipped wings in peacetime Britain has left him without purpose, without fulfillment, without dignity. Hiddleston plays the role with braggadocio and pathos. I wanted to slap his silly, vapid face. I wanted to cry for him.  In fact, during the penultimate scene, I was crying. Not because of how the story ends, but because of the utterly brilliant performance Hiddleston gives at this point.I saw this film twice before purchasing it.

The film has an unusual look to it, shot mostly in low light situations.  Attesting to the director's (Terence Davies) goal of giving it a feeling of memories of earlier events.  To me it looked artificial and fuzzy on my display.The story can pretty much be summed up in a line from Hester's lover Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston).  During an argument, he tells her something to the effect, ""you married the first man you met and fell in love with the first man that flirted with you.""  He was referring to himself in the second case.  Hester, a beautiful, properly raised woman of strict upbringing does marry an older unattractive and mother-dominated judge (Simon Russell Beale).

Hester loves him passionately and wants a divorce.  Freddie loves her too.  Well at least when it's convenient.  He likes to flirt, remember?  He likes to pub crawl and he likes his freedom.  Even when Sir William refuses to divorce, Hester moves in with Freddie.  It's a struggle for both, leading to Hester's wish to die.

All I knew was that it starred Rachel Weisz in some sort of a love drama. That was good enough for me to take a chance on this movie. Glad I did. (Although it was rather strange that I was by far the youngest viewer in the theatre, which incidentally was sold out.)""The Deep Blue See"" (2011 release from the UK; 98 min.) starts off on shaky (or more precise: confusing) ground, as we are immediately thrown into the thick of the story (a woman attempting suicide), which then is broken up with flashbacks on how she got to that point. It took me about 15 min. or so to figure out what was going on, and who was who. After that, the movie took ahold of me, and (without spoiling major plot points), we see Hester (played by Weisz) struggling in her relationships with her husband William (played by Simon Russell Beale) and her lover Freddie (played by Tom Hiddleston). The movie is set in London ""around 1950"" but much of the movie feels like a theatre play, to be honest, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it really focuses on character development more than anything else (an aspect of movie-making sadly overlooked far too often in your typical Hollywood movie).In all, I was quite taken by this movie.

The play was a tremendous success when it was first staged in the London West End, starring Peggy Ashcroft as Hester Collyer, and all who were able to see it then were mesmerized by Ashcroft's honest, heart-rending performance.  Davies gave the film a carefully modulated rendition of the Rattigan original, trying to make it accessible to contemporary audiences.  His is a fine film, well acted, handsomely made.  Rachel Weisz is an excellent actress and her Hester is quite believable.  I just wish that Anatole Litvak's 1955 film, now totally forgotten, could be made available in DVD, if anything for the chance of seeing Vivien Leigh as Hester.  Vivien had the exact age to tackle the role then and, besides, was going through a difficult period, often vulnerable, slowly approaching the end of her marriage to Laurence Olivier.  Today's audiences do not remember who Terence Rattigan was, or even who were Peggy Ashcroft or Vivien Leigh, so many may find Davies' film utterly boring.  This is indeed very sad.

I turned the sound off in the beginning because it was so incongruous with what was happening. It was much better that way. The acting was pretty good overall  and it seems this was adapted from a play. For the most part we are left to wonder what was the point of this disastrous love affair? The object of her affection wasn't worthy and he was a total bore who couldn't even remember her birthday. Certainly not worth committing suicide over and not worth love and devotion obviously. She keeps professing her love over and over to the point that we wonder who she is trying to convince. Other than a couple of bedroom scenes, there is no romance in this film. Some scenes are overdone- the museum scene for one where she isn't able to laugh at his joke about brique braque and feels the need to put him down and he goes totally berserk in response.

Deservedly so; Weisz comes as close to carrying this movie as she possibly can. Unfortunately, one performance does not a movie make, and there is far too much else going on here, most of it mediocre at best, to even be able to sit back and enjoy Weisz' performance, which probably should have netted her another Oscar nomination. Yes, she is that good. The film, however, is not. That this is a remake of Anatole Litvak's 1955 weepie of the same name (with Vivien Leigh in the role Weisz reprises here) should probably cause me to cut the film some slack, but somehow it doesn't.Plot: Hester Collyer (Weisz, an Oscar winner for The Constant Gardner) is a woman seemingly bent on self-destruction. Trapped in a loveless marriage to a barrister (My Week with Marilyn's Simon Russell Beale), whose overbearing mother (Philomena's Barbara Jefford) typifies everything that is wrong with Stiff-Upper-Lip-Britdom, Hester flees into the arms of her husband's opposite, an impecunious chap named Freddie Page (Thor's Tom Hiddleston) whose glory days came during World War II and who is attempting to live off them. He can provide Hester with passion and little else, while her husband, Sir William, can do the opposite. Problem is, Hester is desperately unhappy with Freddie, but is unwilling to accept the contentment of her marriage. Thus, in the opening scene, she has decided to take her own life. Or did she really? The doctor who examines her after the fact condemns the attempt as ridiculous. This question, ultimately, drives the film; does Hester really want to die?Weisz, as noted, plays the role to the hilt. And I realize this is about as YMMV a judgment as someone can pronounce on a movie, but there it is: that role did not ring true to me, not for one single frame of this movie. It might have played in the age of the weepie, but really, weren't we beyond sexual hysteria as a psychological diagnosis even in the fifties? Hester is a doormat, but she's a doormat with escape options. That she buries her head in the sand, and digs deeper every time those escape options are presented to her, does not inspire pathos, and it certainly does not inspire sympathy. Rather, by halfway through the movie she was inspiring the same extreme annoyance in me that she was in Freddie. That wshe was making me root for the gas to win is testament to Weisz' acting ability, but it doesn't say much for the movie as a whole. ** ",3,Jelly Fish.,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2587,"['Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Terence', 'Davies', '2011', 'review', 'have', 'read', 'Terence', 'Davies', '2011', 'effort', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'singled', 'out', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Deservedly', 'so', 'Weisz', 'as', 'close', 'carrying', 'movie', 'possibly', 'can', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'performance', 'not', 'movie', 'make', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'most', 'best', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Weisz', 'performance', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'netted', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Yes', 'good', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'remake', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', '1955', 'weepie', 'same', 'name', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'role', 'Weisz', 'here', 'should', 'probably', 'cause', 'cut', 'film', 'slack', 'somehow', ""doesn't.Plot"", 'Hester', 'Collyer', 'Weisz', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Constant', 'Gardner', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'bent', 'self-destruction', 'Trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'barrister', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Philomena', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Stiff-Upper-Lip-Britdom', 'Hester', 'arms', 'husband', 'opposite', 'impecunious', 'chap', 'named', 'Freddie', 'Page', 'Thor', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'glory', 'days', 'came', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'who', 'attempting', 'live', 'off', 'can', 'provide', 'Hester', 'passion', 'little', 'else', 'husband', 'Sir', 'William', 'can', 'do', 'opposite', 'Problem', 'Hester', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'Freddie', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'contentment', 'marriage', 'Thus', 'opening', 'scene', 'decided', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'did', 'really', 'doctor', 'who', 'fact', 'attempt', 'ridiculous', 'question', 'ultimately', 'film', 'Hester', 'really', 'want', 'die', 'Weisz', 'noted', 'role', 'hilt', 'realize', 'about', 'YMMV', 'judgment', 'someone', 'can', 'pronounce', 'movie', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'frame', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'played', 'age', 'weepie', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'hysteria', 'psychological', 'diagnosis', 'even', 'fifties', 'Hester', 'doormat', 'doormat', 'escape', 'options', 'head', 'sand', 'digs', 'deeper', 'time', 'escape', 'options', 'are', 'presented', 'not', 'inspire', 'pathos', 'certainly', 'not', 'inspire', 'sympathy', 'halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'inspiring', 'same', 'extreme', 'annoyance', 'was', 'Freddie', 'wshe', 'was', 'making', 'root', 'gas', 'win', 'testament', 'Weisz', 'acting', 'ability', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'movie', 'whole', '**']",N/A

Zwick,"[7, 7]","""The Deep Blue Sea"" is a tale of adultery from almost the same provenance and time period as the classic ""Brief Encounter"" by David Lean. In fact, ""Sea"" is almost what ""Encounter"" might have been had it been drained of much of its romance, joy and passion. For while, in spite of their obvious misgivings, the couple in ""Encounter"" clearly enjoyed being in one another's company, the same can not necessarily be said of the lovers here, who seem to share very few moments of genuine joy and happiness throughout the course of their relationship.The 1952 Terrance Rattigan play focuses on Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz), the young, attractive wife of an elderly judge (Simon Russell Beale) who falls in love with Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston), an ex-RAF pilot, in post-WW II London. In a bold move for the time, Hester leaves her husband and moves into a flat with Freddie, but we know immediately that things are not going well, for, as the movie opens, we find Hester attempting suicide, with much of the rest of the story exploring, through a combination of contemporary and flashback scenes, how she's reached this low point of desperation.One of the key elements of the Rattigan play is that it is scrupulously fair to all its characters. The author has no interest in casting stones at any of the people involved in the situation, for each is shown to be a fully-realized human being, with all the virtues and flaws that come along with that status. The emotions and relationships remain multi- layered, ambiguous and complex, and writer/director Terence Davies' spare, almost claustrophobic style perfectly captures the airless, dimly lit world these characters inhabit - something akin to a tableau vivant depiction of frustration and unhappiness.As the woman caught between natural lust, a desire for freedom, and the stiff-upper-lipped propriety of the society around her, Rachel Weiscz delivers a thoughtful, moving performance, and she is matched every step of the way by a superb supporting cast.Despite the often drastic changes in social mores that have occurred since the time of the story, ""The Deep Blue Sea,"" with its keen insights into the nature of the human heart, remains universal and relevant to today.",4,moving study of half-requited love,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2225,"['Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'tale', 'adultery', 'almost', 'same', 'provenance', 'time', 'period', 'classic', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'David', 'Lean', 'fact', 'Sea', 'almost', 'what', 'Encounter', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'drained', 'much', 'romance', 'joy', 'passion', 'spite', 'obvious', 'misgivings', 'couple', 'Encounter', 'clearly', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'one', 'company', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'said', 'lovers', 'here', 'who', 'seem', 'share', 'very', 'few', 'moments', 'genuine', 'joy', 'happiness', 'course', 'relationship.The', '1952', 'Terrance', 'Rattigan', 'play', 'Hester', 'Collyer', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'young', 'attractive', 'wife', 'elderly', 'judge', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'who', 'love', 'Freddie', 'Page', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'ex-RAF', 'pilot', 'post-WW', 'II', 'London', 'bold', 'move', 'time', 'Hester', 'husband', 'moves', 'flat', 'Freddie', 'know', 'immediately', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'movie', 'find', 'Hester', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'much', 'rest', 'story', 'exploring', 'combination', 'contemporary', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'how', 'reached', 'low', 'point', 'desperation.One', 'key', 'elements', 'Rattigan', 'play', 'scrupulously', 'fair', 'characters', 'author', 'interest', 'casting', 'stones', 'people', 'involved', 'situation', 'shown', 'be', 'fully-realized', 'human', 'being', 'virtues', 'flaws', 'come', 'status', 'emotions', 'relationships', 'remain', 'multi-', 'layered', 'ambiguous', 'complex', 'writer/director', 'Terence', 'Davies', 'spare', 'almost', 'claustrophobic', 'style', 'perfectly', 'airless', 'dimly', 'lit', 'world', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'something', 'akin', 'tableau', 'vivant', 'depiction', 'frustration', 'unhappiness.As', 'woman', 'caught', 'natural', 'lust', 'desire', 'freedom', 'stiff-upper-lipped', 'propriety', 'society', 'Rachel', 'Weiscz', 'thoughtful', 'moving', 'performance', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast.Despite', 'often', 'drastic', 'changes', 'social', 'mores', 'have', 'occurred', 'time', 'story', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'keen', 'insights', 'nature', 'human', 'heart', 'universal', 'relevant', 'today']",N/A

Neither of the two men give the young woman (Rachel) the emotional support or real love that she needs.  She goes down the wrong path by having an affair with a friend of her husband.  Things continue to go wrong for this young woman with no love and her estranged husband now wanting to hurt her in any way.  Her father practically turns his back on her.  Even the affair she engaged in turned into something sad and disappointing.  She finally comes to the realization that she must go on and live her life without approval or love from the men she once thought very highly of.  The time is in the early 50's in England with wonderful scenes of old cars and homes/flats and clothes.

Rodick,"[29, 43]","Mesmerised by the choreography between the pin-point dialogue, the sumptuous eye for detail within moving frames of worn scenes and the sounds of music, birds, cases and delicate places. I was hooked from beginning to end.There were so many potential pit-falls set for this production but it easily avoided them all. Originality saw to that. Terence Davis made a film; he did not film a play. I hung on every nuance. It was as though I lived those times.I loved the swings and shifts, for there was so much room for understanding to come in and settle down by the fire. In the Public House or the Underground. In the past or in the present. Individuals getting along with each other.And this aching country reflects its leaden subjects. Judges and landladies avoiding the rest. Sophocles would be out of his depth.For American audiences the time and place depicted can have little if any resonance. I would still recommend The Deep Blue Sea if you watch it in the dark with a good surround sound system, no, there are no whiz bang special effects but the soundtrack will put you there.
