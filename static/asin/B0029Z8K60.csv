1257711,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0029Z8K60,David Girod,"[5, 7]","I'm not a believer in the paranormal, but I love a good ghost story. I enjoy getting goosebumps watching movies like ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""The Grudge"".""Ghost Adventures"" is a fun show...even if you don't believe, simply because of Zak Bagans and his crew. If I were going to make a B-movie about ghost hunting I would most likely pick someone just like the former wedding DJ to star.Bagans simply doesn't care that he comes off goofy or corny at times when he's trying to ""provoke"" some spirits. You can't help but get caught up in the action, and even though I don't believe...watching Bagans and his crew do their thing really makes me want to believe. And I think that's where ""Ghost Adventures"" succeeds and similar shows fail.The better known ""Ghost Hunters"" is basically the same show every week, and it seems that more often than not, you end us wasting an hour watching those guys wander through dark hallways with little to no payoff at all.Zak and his crew seem to capture quite a bit more ghost action on their show. And even if they don't, you still get to enjoy Bagans and his over the top hunting techniques.Another aspect of the show that I really enjoy over similar programs is that any ""evidence"" captured on either film or audio recordings is played during the course of the ""investigation"". Meaning that if they catch something on film or catch a voice on one of their recorders, you get to hear it, or see it, right away as opposed to waiting until the final minutes of the show.To top it off, I love that the first half of each show is an in depth look at the locations being investigated. As a history buff, you have to love when the crew takes learns the history (usually violent) of places like the Sloss Furnace or the Idaho Penitentiary.So if you want some fun goosebump raising entertainment, that at times can be corny as well as a little spooky, I recommend you give this show a try.",3,Fun Even for an Unbeliever,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1916,"[""'m"", 'not', 'believer', 'paranormal', 'love', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'goosebumps', 'watching', 'movies', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Grudge', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'fun', 'show', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'simply', 'Zak', 'Bagans', 'crew', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'B-movie', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'pick', 'someone', 'just', 'former', 'wedding', 'DJ', 'star.Bagans', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'off', 'goofy', 'corny', 'times', 'when', 'trying', 'provoke', 'spirits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'action', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watching', 'Bagans', 'crew', 'do', 'thing', 'really', 'want', 'believe', 'think', 'where', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'similar', 'shows', 'fail.The', 'better', 'known', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'basically', 'same', 'show', 'week', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'end', 'wasting', 'hour', 'watching', 'guys', 'wander', 'dark', 'hallways', 'little', 'payoff', 'all.Zak', 'crew', 'seem', 'capture', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'ghost', 'action', 'show', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'still', 'get', 'enjoy', 'Bagans', 'top', 'hunting', 'techniques.Another', 'aspect', 'show', 'really', 'enjoy', 'similar', 'programs', 'evidence', 'captured', 'film', 'audio', 'recordings', 'played', 'course', 'investigation', 'Meaning', 'catch', 'something', 'film', 'catch', 'voice', 'one', 'recorders', 'get', 'hear', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'opposed', 'waiting', 'final', 'minutes', 'show.To', 'top', 'off', 'love', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'depth', 'look', 'locations', 'being', 'investigated', 'history', 'buff', 'have', 'love', 'when', 'crew', 'history', 'usually', 'violent', 'places', 'Sloss', 'Furnace', 'Idaho', 'Penitentiary.So', 'want', 'fun', 'goosebump', 'raising', 'entertainment', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'corny', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'spooky', 'recommend', 'give', 'show', 'try']",Ghost Adventures: Season 1

1257713,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0029Z8K60,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","GHOST ADVENTURES season one is one of only two DVDs I will review of the infamous TV series ""Ghost Adventures"". My other review is of GHOST ADVENTURES a/k/aGhost Adventures / Ghosts Don't Existand I don't even know what is on that DVD because this is a series that has pestered the public for almost a decade.The often repulsive Zak Bagans, the cute-and-cuddly (well he is to me!) Nick Groff and the clownish Aaron Goodwin are the irrepressible, incorrigible trio of dummies who ""investigate"" the paranormal. As far as I can tell from my research, they steamroll into a site they like, shut everyone out of what they're doing, and lock themselves in to do God-knows-what for the sake of TV ratings.Their science is of course a joke. Their attempts at fraud, hoaxes, fakery, charlatanism, call-it-what-you-like, are so obvious I am shocked they are so popular. But I have a very warm spot in my heart for Nick Groff, who has been looking dreadful this year and it frightens me to think, ""Oh, no, another one's gotten sick."" Fans may recall Ryan Buell's cancer and the rumors that Grant Wilson left ""Ghost Hunters"" due to severe illness.What I love here is the team's blatantly funny nature and their realization that it is worth taking up half an episode featuring that, instead of Zak Bagan's horrific struggle with the English language yammering about the haunted locations' histories. Frankly these guys, with a little work, would be very good comic actors ~ especially Aaron Goodwin. Alas, their love affair is with easy fame, money and rotten, dishonest TV production.This may have been staged, which would make it pure genius, or it really happened, but it demonstrates how I feel about all such shows: the team is heading toward some building when they encounter some tiny children. Zak says hi to them, only to be icily jeered by the little girl with ""My parents told me not to talk to STRANGE MEN."" (Or something hilarious to that effect.) The thought of that still makes me laugh.These boys have talent, flair and love to mug for the camera. In fact the entirety of their show is mugging for the camera. Young Nick, who is actually one of the producers, used to have almost 0% camera time. Happily he is now featured as much as possible since he has always pulled double duty as the cameraman. Just know, fans, it is all B.S., and poorly executed at that.I wish I had a dime for each instance of Zak spitting or huffing into his digital recorder. (That's how EVPs are made, don't you know.)As an old-school paranormal investigator of yesteryear (yes, I was around 15 years old and interested in doing a book about the haunted locations in my hometown, so naive), I often watch these paranormal shows as a way to relax. It's no fun trying to figure out the way they have done their clever tricks, because I already know most of it. It isn't even sophisticated stage illusion ~ I really hate it when I see with my own eyes some of the cast performing lousy ventriloquism to create EVPs.But then that's how EVPs really came into existence.After all, how tough is it to get EVPs when you have at least one jerk standing there, holding a camera and then is never acknowledged as being there? How often do they say, ""It was just the paranormal team"" when they have at least two production crew members there too! That is only the tip of the iceberg.It amazes me how these programs generate actual buzz, as if there were a defensible side, ""their"" side of the story. They'd solve all this by disclaiming right at the start that their shows are only for entertainment and much of it is re-enacted or otherwise not actual footage. Because all the aforementioned is the truth. You don't need to be Einstein, Houdini or The Amazing Randi to see these facts.The Amazing Randi, a great favorite of mine since he has taken Houdini's old torch of exposing fraud, has a site with a very convincing interview conducted by Alison Smith, here [...] at his James Randi Educational Foundation.Randi, for those who know not, is an expert magician and showman turned fraud/hoax investigator. He is famous for making clear, logical arguments against all these kinds of paranormal shows. When you read this interview, pay attention to the interviewer's question, ""Tell me about editing.""",3,"3rd star for Nick Groff's incredible beauty (NO, I did not mean to write Zak Bagans)",1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,4271,"['GHOST', 'ADVENTURES', 'season', 'one', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'DVDs', 'will', 'review', 'infamous', 'TV', 'series', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'other', 'review', 'GHOST', 'ADVENTURES', 'a/k/aGhost', 'Adventures', '/', 'Ghosts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Existand', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'DVD', 'series', 'pestered', 'public', 'almost', 'decade.The', 'often', 'repulsive', 'Zak', 'Bagans', 'cute-and-cuddly', 'well', 'Nick', 'Groff', 'clownish', 'Aaron', 'Goodwin', 'are', 'irrepressible', 'incorrigible', 'trio', 'dummies', 'who', 'investigate', 'paranormal', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'research', 'steamroll', 'site', 'like', 'shut', 'everyone', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'lock', 'do', 'God-knows-what', 'sake', 'TV', 'ratings.Their', 'science', 'course', 'joke', 'attempts', 'fraud', 'hoaxes', 'fakery', 'charlatanism', 'call-it-what-you-like', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'am', 'shocked', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'have', 'very', 'warm', 'spot', 'heart', 'Nick', 'Groff', 'who', 'been', 'looking', 'dreadful', 'year', 'think', 'Oh', 'one', 'gotten', 'sick', 'Fans', 'may', 'recall', 'Ryan', 'Buell', 'cancer', 'rumors', 'Grant', 'Wilson', 'left', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'due', 'severe', 'illness.What', 'love', 'here', 'team', 'blatantly', 'funny', 'nature', 'realization', 'worth', 'taking', 'up', 'episode', 'featuring', 'instead', 'Zak', 'Bagan', 'horrific', 'struggle', 'English', 'language', 'yammering', 'haunted', 'locations', 'histories', 'Frankly', 'guys', 'little', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'comic', 'actors', '~', 'especially', 'Aaron', 'Goodwin', 'Alas', 'love', 'affair', 'easy', 'fame', 'money', 'rotten', 'dishonest', 'TV', 'production.This', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'staged', 'would', 'make', 'pure', 'genius', 'really', 'happened', 'how', 'feel', 'such', 'shows', 'team', 'heading', 'building', 'when', 'encounter', 'tiny', 'children', 'Zak', 'hi', 'only', 'be', 'icily', 'jeered', 'little', 'girl', 'parents', 'told', 'not', 'talk', 'STRANGE', 'MEN', 'something', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'thought', 'still', 'laugh.These', 'boys', 'have', 'talent', 'flair', 'love', 'mug', 'camera', 'fact', 'entirety', 'show', 'mugging', 'camera', 'Young', 'Nick', 'who', 'actually', 'one', 'producers', 'used', 'have', 'almost', '0', '%', 'camera', 'time', 'Happily', 'now', 'featured', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'always', 'pulled', 'double', 'duty', 'cameraman', 'Just', 'know', 'fans', 'B.S.', 'poorly', 'executed', 'that.I', 'wish', 'had', 'dime', 'instance', 'Zak', 'spitting', 'huffing', 'digital', 'recorder', 'how', 'EVPs', 'are', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'old-school', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'yesteryear', 'yes', 'was', 'around', '15', 'years', 'old', 'interested', 'doing', 'book', 'haunted', 'locations', 'hometown', 'so', 'naive', 'often', 'watch', 'paranormal', 'shows', 'way', 'relax', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'have', 'done', 'clever', 'tricks', 'already', 'know', 'most', ""n't"", 'even', 'sophisticated', 'stage', 'illusion', '~', 'really', 'hate', 'when', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'cast', 'performing', 'lousy', 'ventriloquism', 'create', 'EVPs.But', 'then', 'how', 'EVPs', 'really', 'came', 'existence.After', 'how', 'tough', 'get', 'EVPs', 'when', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'jerk', 'standing', 'there', 'holding', 'camera', 'then', 'never', 'acknowledged', 'being', 'there', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'paranormal', 'team', 'when', 'have', 'least', 'two', 'production', 'crew', 'members', 'there', 'too', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg.It', 'how', 'programs', 'generate', 'actual', 'buzz', 'were', 'defensible', 'side', 'side', 'story', ""'d"", 'solve', 'disclaiming', 'right', 'start', 'shows', 'are', 'only', 'entertainment', 'much', 're-enacted', 'otherwise', 'not', 'actual', 'footage', 'aforementioned', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Einstein', 'Houdini', 'Amazing', 'Randi', 'see', 'facts.The', 'Amazing', 'Randi', 'great', 'favorite', 'mine', 'taken', 'Houdini', 'old', 'torch', 'exposing', 'fraud', 'site', 'very', 'convincing', 'interview', 'conducted', 'Alison', 'Smith', 'here', '[', ']', 'James', 'Randi', 'Educational', 'Foundation.Randi', 'who', 'know', 'not', 'expert', 'magician', 'showman', 'turned', 'fraud/hoax', 'investigator', 'famous', 'making', 'clear', 'logical', 'arguments', 'kinds', 'paranormal', 'shows', 'When', 'read', 'interview', 'pay', 'attention', 'interviewer', 'question', 'Tell', 'editing']",Ghost Adventures: Season 1

If it is, I might as well just DVR all the episodes with the commercials and the bleeps and watch it like that. I almost want to mail it back because of it.The Travel Channel will definitely be hearing from me. They at least need to tell people that these shows are still censored. That they hide this information is extremely deceptive. When I pay for a DVD, I want it ""as is"", with no bleeps or any other censorship.

I have an interest in the genre and I will catch other titles when they are on, but not before GA have I been a follower of any particular series. Most of the reviews you will read about this title will point out the amateurish and somewhat clumsy way these three men go about their investigations and that is part of the charm in my opinion. They aren't dry scientist or analytical types that turn everything into a laboratory experiment, yet they do use professional grade equipment. Zak's brash style can be hard to accept at first but he does eventually grow on you and if he doesn't you may learn to at least appreciate him for who he is (or portrays) despite. The three of them have a sort of genuine quality about them that makes them fun to watch as they go through all these ""exotic"" locations. Yes, they try to add some drama, yes there is a musical score of creepy music, yes there are bumpers with sound effects and contrived scary scenes but it is TV after all. They will also add just a bit about themselves and their personal lives in certain episodes that will make you think perhaps this is more then just fun and games and maybe catching a ghost on film, but that their private lives (Aaron's particularly) may have suffered because of it. The evidence they catch is compelling and believable, yet sometimes I wonder why they are so ""lucky.""

I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E;) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.Ghost Adventures is also an interesting show. Less scientific evidence though. I'd like to see more. The EVPs are not always that impressive. Good show though.In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.After Life: Answers from the Other Side-- by John Edward [2010]",4,"Ghost Adventures is a good show.

I'll watch the same episodes over and over again on The Travel Channel, I never get sick of them.  I just ordered Season One, and it's on its way... and I also pre-ordered Season 2, of course.  DUH!!  LOL.  Anyways this show is extremely entertaining.  Not only do the investigators gather incredible evidence once dusk hits and it's time for ""lock-down"" ... but they are an absolute HOOT to watch once their adventure begins.  MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!Zak Bagans has definitely found his calling by doing what he does.  This field has needed a NO BS, NO NONSENSE, tough, in-your-face type of investigator for a long, LONG time... so Zak's been a long time coming!!  He's so funny to watch, because you can just tell he's like a little kid in a candy shop practically drooling when the owner or keeper gives him the tour and the run-down on the site, paranormal activity, experiences, stories, and the history behind each location, etc, etc;--which is just as fascinating in itself.  He completely cracks me up because he ALWAYS tackles and taunts the 'evil' and most aggressive entities at the site, and basically tells them who's boss.  He asks and demands that they try to pull the same stuff that they have pulled on other people.  He's persistent, and extremely passionate about this, and it makes you wanna' back him up 100 percent!  But the laughs will still be there, of course, LOL!Nick, the second investigator is the more 'smooth and suave' type... but he relentlessly follows Zak's orders and pretty much always gets the job done, which is what these guys are just trying to do.  Get in, get the evidence they need, and get the H*LL outta' there--ALIVE!!  Nick gets just as frightened and scared as the other two, though, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.Aaron, the camera-man is a total TRIP to watch beause he is definitely the most vulnerable and frightened of the group.  The entities feed off of people's fear, and they loooove to mess with Aaron, hehehe.  Zak and Nick undoubtedly know this because they usually use Aaron as ""the bait""... making him do some of the scariest and craziest experiments during the lockdown.  But Hey. Somebody's gotta' do the dirty work, right??? LOL!All in all this has got to be the best paranormal research show out there today, and I really hope these guys continue to do what they're doing for a very long, long time.  And they are ARE professional in what they do.  They're real people just like the rest of us, yanno.  They become terrified, run for their lives, scream and yell, and they are not afraid to show it.  I see nothing wrong with paranormal investigators having a little bit of personality... and these guys have a PLENTY of it, lol, which is quite refreshing.  They're like 3 little kids going through a Haunted House on Halloween night, LULZ.  Their reactions are genuine and yes, HI-larious at the same time.  You can bet that if I was doing this stuff in front of millions of viewers on TV, I would give them a run for their money, too! The only one who really overreacts is Aaron--no surprise.  Still--it's genuine overreactions.  They show us just how REAL this field is... and their techniques work, because they get lots of activity and evidence recorded.  I don't think I've ever seen a show where they haven't collected or experienced any activity.  So whatever they're doing--it's working!  Bottom line:  They get the job done, and they've shined a whole new light on paranormal studies.  They are cleary passionate in what they do, and it shows.  You get caught up in the adventure right along with them!I call these guys ""The Real-Life Ghostbusters"" because once again, they really mean business, and let the entities know it, too (which of course, the entities do not like).  They are a no BS, no nonsense group of investigators who get the job done and get it done right, IMO.  It's also so funny to watch them get on eachother's nerves, too... yelling at eachother, telling eachother to shut-up, calm down, telling the other one to go do something because ""they ain't doing it"", etc, etc, etc.  LMAO--these guys are totally like The 3 Stooges of this field.

1257734,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0029Z8K60,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Allow me to preface this by saying I do not believe in ghosts, goblins, demons, or things that go bump in the night. I do however find Ghost Adventures and similar shows to be highly entertaining and some of the best reality TV has to offer. I like the historical background, meeting the people involved, the investigations in the dark, and the reactions the people have to what they see.Since the conception of Reality TV in the late 90s, we have seen a ton of these ghost hunting shows debut. We have Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State, Destination Truth, Ghost Mine, Celebrity Ghost Stories, and of course Ghost Adventures, but what is it that makes one show any different or better than the other?Ghost Adventures is the one that I enjoy the most and if I were a believer, it's the show that I would find to be the most compelling. Simply put, the ghost adventures team, goes to the best locations and captures more evidence than any one else does, so what does that mean? As I see it, it means one of two things. Either these guys really are the best at what they do or they are completely full of !@#$.The Ghost Adventures team is made of three guys, who claim to have been skeptics, until they witnessed things they couldn't explain. These three guys, without big crews, go into these haunted locations with camcorders, and are locked in overnight. To me that is the best part of the show, because in similar shows, you have dozens of people stomping around finding nothing and trying to disprove what people are saying. Zak, Nick, & Aaron aren't trying to do that, but rather they want to interact with whatever is going on in these locations and try to capture it on film. Is that the reason they capture more evidence? Is it the fact that it's just three guys with a minimal amount of equipment? I have no idea, all I know is that they find the most stuff!In recent years, almost every other ghost hunting show has had someone speak out against them and say that certain things were faked, the people were paid or coaxed into saying things that weren't true, but in the seven years that Ghost Adventures has been on the air that hasn't happened to them.So besides the evidence, what is it that makes this show the best? Well, you've got three young guys, who are ambitions, full of energy, and love what they do. The format of the show is also a big plus in their favor.Each show starts out with a historical background on the location they are going to investigate. That's followed by interviews with the people who live or work at the location. The team walks through with the people, listening to their stories, and marking down locations to investigate later. Then they move on to some extra-curricular activity that shows the audience that they're real people. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's just tourists, and other times it's boys being boys. It seems like filler, but actually these segments really help you connect with the guys and see that they aren't just science geeks sitting in front of their camera all day. Next, comes the investigation, which is done in a way that is completely realistic. If a regular person went into a place that they heard was haunted, and they went in with a camera and a tape recorder, they'd act and react in exactly the same way that these guys do. It adds realism to the show and is much more believable then a show that comes in with a giant truck and a ton of equipment.The one negative I will put on the show is that these three guys just went out and started doing videos, pitched it to a network, and got a TV show. They aren't scholars or scientists who have studied the phenomenon of haunting for decades. That being said, when they start going on about portals, residual spiritual energy, trapped souls, and demonic stuff, they really do sound like they are completely full of !@#%.Overall, I like the show, I love the format, and while I think there is some kind of trick to it all, I respect the hosts and how they feel about what they are supposedly seeing. Weather you believe in ghosts or not, the Ghost Adventures team gives a more compelling argument for life after death than any of it's competitors. The show is interesting and very entertaining, that's really all I need to watch it. I don't feel like I have to believe or think the same way they do. They aren't preaching to us like some of the other shows and they aren't talking down to us. They just go and do their thing, while taking us along for the ride and it's most definitely an entertaining one.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,4532,"['Allow', 'preface', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'goblins', 'demons', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'do', 'however', 'find', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'similar', 'shows', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'best', 'reality', 'TV', 'offer', 'historical', 'background', 'meeting', 'people', 'involved', 'investigations', 'dark', 'reactions', 'people', 'have', 'what', 'see.Since', 'conception', 'Reality', 'TV', 'late', '90s', 'have', 'seen', 'ton', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'shows', 'debut', 'have', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Destination', 'Truth', 'Ghost', 'Mine', 'Celebrity', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'course', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'what', 'one', 'show', 'different', 'better', 'other', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'one', 'enjoy', 'most', 'were', 'believer', 'show', 'would', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'Simply', 'put', 'ghost', 'team', 'best', 'locations', 'captures', 'more', 'evidence', 'one', 'else', 'so', 'what', 'mean', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'guys', 'really', 'are', 'best', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'completely', 'full', '@', '.The', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'team', 'made', 'three', 'guys', 'who', 'claim', 'have', 'been', 'skeptics', 'witnessed', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'explain', 'three', 'guys', 'big', 'crews', 'go', 'haunted', 'locations', 'camcorders', 'are', 'locked', 'overnight', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'similar', 'shows', 'have', 'dozens', 'people', 'stomping', 'finding', 'nothing', 'trying', 'disprove', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'Zak', 'Nick', 'Aaron', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'do', 'rather', 'want', 'interact', 'going', 'locations', 'try', 'capture', 'film', 'reason', 'capture', 'more', 'evidence', 'fact', 'just', 'three', 'guys', 'minimal', 'amount', 'equipment', 'have', 'idea', 'know', 'find', 'most', 'stuff', 'recent', 'years', 'almost', 'other', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'show', 'had', 'someone', 'speak', 'say', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'faked', 'people', 'were', 'paid', 'coaxed', 'saying', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'true', 'seven', 'years', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'been', 'air', ""n't"", 'happened', 'them.So', 'evidence', 'what', 'show', 'best', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'got', 'three', 'young', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'ambitions', 'full', 'energy', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'format', 'show', 'also', 'big', 'plus', 'favor.Each', 'show', 'out', 'historical', 'background', 'location', 'are', 'going', 'investigate', 'followed', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'work', 'location', 'team', 'walks', 'people', 'listening', 'stories', 'marking', 'down', 'locations', 'investigate', 'later', 'Then', 'move', 'extra-curricular', 'activity', 'audience', ""'re"", 'real', 'people', 'Sometimes', 'funny', 'just', 'tourists', 'other', 'times', 'boys', 'being', 'boys', 'filler', 'actually', 'segments', 'really', 'help', 'connect', 'guys', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'science', 'geeks', 'sitting', 'front', 'camera', 'day', 'Next', 'investigation', 'done', 'way', 'completely', 'realistic', 'regular', 'person', 'went', 'place', 'heard', 'was', 'haunted', 'went', 'camera', 'tape', 'recorder', ""'d"", 'act', 'react', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'guys', 'do', 'realism', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'then', 'show', 'giant', 'truck', 'ton', 'equipment.The', 'one', 'negative', 'will', 'put', 'show', 'three', 'guys', 'just', 'went', 'out', 'started', 'doing', 'videos', 'pitched', 'network', 'got', 'TV', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", 'scholars', 'scientists', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'phenomenon', 'haunting', 'decades', 'being', 'said', 'when', 'start', 'going', 'portals', 'residual', 'spiritual', 'energy', 'trapped', 'souls', 'demonic', 'stuff', 'really', 'do', 'sound', 'are', 'completely', 'full', '@', '%', '.Overall', 'like', 'show', 'love', 'format', 'think', 'kind', 'trick', 'respect', 'hosts', 'how', 'feel', 'what', 'are', 'supposedly', 'seeing', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'not', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'team', 'more', 'compelling', 'argument', 'life', 'death', 'competitors', 'show', 'interesting', 'very', 'entertaining', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'believe', 'think', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'are', ""n't"", 'preaching', 'other', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'down', 'just', 'go', 'do', 'thing', 'taking', 'ride', 'most', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'one']",Ghost Adventures: Season 1
