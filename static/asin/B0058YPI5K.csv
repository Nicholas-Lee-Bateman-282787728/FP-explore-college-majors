In this role she's supposed to have been a neuro-surgeon but now she's a medical examiner (how/why would someone make that career change? maybe that was explained in first season?)  And the city she works for must be rich rich rich because the office space they're all in looks extremely spacious and high budget (completely unrealistic).  She also dresses totally inappropriately for her role, in tight fitting fashionable garb which one would wear for a hot date - complete with insanely high heels (occasionally she does don scrubs while doing autopsies, but not often). Also - there only seems to be 1 case to work on at a time.PROS:Pretty good and likable cast. Interesting writing and interesting cases (as you would expect from this type of show).If you can accept the things I mention in the CONS section, you will probably enjoy this show.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","Though the actual DVD package of Season 2 of this highly-rated ABC series was not released until September 18th (2012), there are already plenty of reviews of the series itself - including a nice ""Episode Summary"" by my fellow reviewer Matahari Knows, so there is no reason to repeat that info. But I hope I can add a bit more info on the Home DVD package (I got the DVD, not the Bluray for this title.)I've never actually watched the series on TV but, rather, discovered it by getting the DVD of Season One. I like Dana Delaney (the rest of the cast were all new to me) and, knowing that the show is set in Philadelphia (where I reside) was an extra incentive. As I pointed out in my review of Season One, there are some establishing shots which were filmed in Philadelphia, but I didn't recognize a lot of the scenes and later learned they were filmed in Rhode Island! I was told that, because Delaney wanted to be back in California, Season Two was filmed there. This becomes obvious in the first episode where the wealthy cul-de-sac where the action takes place looks almost exactly like Wisteria Lane from ""Desperate Housewives"", Delaney's previous series. It goes in further in  that - the first of 20 episodes - when Delaney's character says she ""knows a lot about desperate housewives"". So, yes, I'll admit that my mind did wander when ""continuity issues"" revolving about Philly occurred, but that shouldn't affect others.The First Season was a mid-season replacement and ran just nine episodes on two discs. This time there are 20 episodes on four DVDS. The bonuses include featurettes on the ""bodies"" used in the show (the show uses a few medical consultants and there's lots of medical talk), a three-part feature on the stunts, the special effects team and how they work, the fashions and costumes, a few ""webisodes"" and the now-requisite "" Blooper Reel"".As noted by other reviewers, the relationships of the characters are examined in more depth in the scripts this time, while they still try to solve a murder each week in under 43 minutes! (Yes, there are that many minutes of commercials in TV show these days.Each person who watches the show seems to identify with a different character in the cast and so you'll have your favorite.I'm glad I found it. I'll wait till Season Three to see if any of the ""cast changes"" mentioned by others in the comments, change the enjoyment of watching the show.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Review of the DVD release - The Second Season but really the first ""FULL"" one.",1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2504,"['actual', 'DVD', 'package', 'Season', '2', 'highly-rated', 'ABC', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'September', '18th', '2012', 'are', 'already', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'series', 'including', 'nice', 'Episode', 'Summary', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Matahari', 'Knows', 'reason', 'repeat', 'info', 'hope', 'can', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'info', 'Home', 'DVD', 'package', 'got', 'DVD', 'not', 'Bluray', 'title', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'watched', 'series', 'TV', 'rather', 'discovered', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Season', 'One', 'like', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'new', 'knowing', 'show', 'set', 'Philadelphia', 'where', 'reside', 'was', 'extra', 'incentive', 'pointed', 'out', 'review', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'establishing', 'shots', 'were', 'filmed', 'Philadelphia', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'lot', 'scenes', 'later', 'learned', 'were', 'filmed', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'was', 'told', 'Delaney', 'wanted', 'be', 'back', 'California', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'filmed', 'there', 'obvious', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'wealthy', 'cul-de-sac', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'almost', 'exactly', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Delaney', 'previous', 'series', 'further', 'first', '20', 'episodes', 'when', 'Delaney', 'character', 'lot', 'desperate', 'housewives', 'So', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'mind', 'did', 'wander', 'when', 'continuity', 'issues', 'revolving', 'Philly', 'occurred', 'should', ""n't"", 'affect', 'others.The', 'First', 'Season', 'was', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'ran', 'just', 'nine', 'episodes', 'two', 'discs', 'time', 'are', '20', 'episodes', 'four', 'DVDS', 'bonuses', 'include', 'featurettes', 'bodies', 'used', 'show', 'show', 'few', 'medical', 'consultants', 'lots', 'medical', 'talk', 'three-part', 'feature', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'how', 'work', 'fashions', 'costumes', 'few', 'webisodes', 'now-requisite', 'Blooper', 'Reel', '.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'examined', 'more', 'depth', 'scripts', 'time', 'still', 'try', 'solve', 'murder', 'week', '43', 'minutes', 'Yes', 'are', 'many', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'TV', 'show', 'days.Each', 'person', 'who', 'show', 'identify', 'different', 'character', 'cast', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'favorite.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'found', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'till', 'Season', 'Three', 'see', 'cast', 'changes', 'mentioned', 'others', 'comments', 'change', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'show.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Body of Proof: Season 2
