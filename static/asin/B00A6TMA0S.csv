1606113,A28BA6K5NGI8C0,B00A6TMA0S,Anthony J Sullivan,"[1, 2]",Having grown up watching GLOW as a child I loved this documentary.  It's very well made and centers around Mt. Fiji for the most part.  It's really great in running down the history with lots of interviews.  There's clips of the bouts also.  My girlfriend watched this with me and she had zero connection to GLOW or wrestling at all going in and really enjoyed it too.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's a fun watch.,5,Wonderful documentary,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,417,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'GLOW', 'child', 'loved', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'centers', 'Mt', 'Fiji', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'great', 'running', 'down', 'history', 'lots', 'interviews', 'clips', 'bouts', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'watched', 'had', 'zero', 'connection', 'GLOW', 'wrestling', 'going', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fun', 'watch']",GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling

Great to see what the gals are up to now. This was a great tribute. Unfortunate that the full seasons of episodes aren't available affordably, though after watching the doc I understand why. The extras are plentiful and really made this a treat.",5,80's Nostalgia!!,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,362,"['loved', 'show', 'kid', 'Campy', 'hell', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Loved', 'characters', 'Great', 'see', 'what', 'gals', 'are', 'up', 'now', 'was', 'great', 'tribute', 'Unfortunate', 'full', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'available', 'affordably', 'watching', 'doc', 'understand', 'why', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'really', 'made', 'treat']",GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling
1606115,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00A6TMA0S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 7]","Here they are!  The Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling are back in the pleasing documentary ""GLOW.""  In the mid-eighties, the campy idea of presenting lady wresting to the masses swept the world.  This television endeavor established a colorful cast of characters (aligned into appropriate good versus evil camps) and made them entertainers, products spokespeople, and (oh yeah) athletes.  The girls came from different backgrounds and had varying expectations, but were soon bound together in a one-of-a-kind phenomenon that no one could anticipate.  This brief film (run time is only 76 minutes) can't hope to unravel the entire story behind this unprecedented journey, but it is good at highlighting the experience from the vantage point of the girls involved.  Almost all the content is provided from the GLOW girls themselves and, as I said, that makes some of the more interesting aspects of the story left to speculation and rumor.  But as a tribute to this new breed of entertainer, ""GLOW"" should more than satisfy those that loved the show and also those who are experiencing it anew.One of the primary pleasures of ""GLOW"" is to catch up with some of your favorite characters.  Not a lot of time, however, is spent on their modern lives.  Instead, they share stories about the glory days.  It's an interesting look at the rise and fall of celebrity, and the girls were smart enough to enjoy their time in the spotlight.  Much of the film's first half gives you history with plenty of clips, skits, and even their infamous raps.  It's an entertaining spectacle even today, so awful that (in many ways) it rises to the level of genius.  But the documentary does have a more serious side as well.  Many of the ladies are affected by the physical stresses of having a career in the ring.  Popular good girl Mount Fiji stands as the emotional centerpiece of the story, currently residing in a care facility.  A reunion is staged that brings the girls together which has a number of sweet and satisfying moments.There are a lot of different angles that a documentary about the GLOW era could take.  I won't lie, I wanted more about the business side of the enterprise.  But truthfully, that isn't the story these filmmakers wanted to make and that's perfectly fine!  While nowhere near comprehensive, ""GLOW"" is entertaining as a nostalgia piece and as a look at instant fame.  In addition to the short film, the DVD release has got a number of intriguing extras.  There are additional skits and complete raps, deleted scenes, a few actual matches, a film festival panel, featurettes, and an audio commentary track by Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins.  All in all, it's over an hour of additional material to enhance your GLOW experience.

1606116,A5KUVR7CG4V5V,B00A6TMA0S,"Lawrence Tuczynski ""godzillamusic""","[1, 4]",This DVD was disappointing in some ways but fascinating in others. I had watched this show when I was much younger and enjoyed it. It was campy but funny and some of the girls were definitely good looking. I knew from the description that this was a documentary about the show and the girls. I was however expecting to see some footage of old matches. No dice on the matches but the documentary was well done and it was nice to see what some of the women are up to today and how they look as well as their memories of the show. I'd say rent this instead of buy it if you can. It's worth a viewing but probably not much repeat viewing.,4,GLOW DVD,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,634,"['DVD', 'was', 'disappointing', 'ways', 'fascinating', 'others', 'had', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'campy', 'funny', 'girls', 'were', 'definitely', 'good', 'looking', 'knew', 'description', 'was', 'documentary', 'show', 'girls', 'was', 'however', 'expecting', 'see', 'footage', 'old', 'matches', 'dice', 'matches', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'up', 'today', 'how', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'memories', 'show', ""'d"", 'say', 'rent', 'instead', 'buy', 'can', 'viewing', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'repeat', 'viewing']",GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling
