With enough updates to the script (Thanks to screenwriters Susannah Grant and Gary Winisk) version 2006 gets more than a whole new look.  The casting is impeccable.  Dakota Fanning plays a fiesty Fern, and the voice overs fill every bill:  Steve Buscemi as Templeton the Rat, almost makes us forget the late Paul Lynde's enduring performance.  And the rest of the barnyard animals are no small (tail) shakes, either.  (Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer make great geese.  Rheba McIntyre gives the proper color for Betsy, the Cow, and Robert Redford portrays, Ike, the horse, with enough steadfast cynicism.  And John Cleese is proper and right as the sheep.  The only element reminiscent in this rendition is Dominick Scott Kaye's perfect performance as Wilbur, even if it seems to borrow from the family classic, 'Babe'.  Julia Roberts suits Charlotte aptly, and reminds us that beauty can transmit itself in voice as well as screen presence.  How she manages to make us believe Charlotte is beautiful is a miracle like the ones in the movie.  The human characters play their roles fittingly-- not overdone, but certainly how we would imagine them from the book.Besides a perfect cast, the look of the movie is ""stunning"".  Between the expert lighting and computer enhanced images, we are given a feast like Wilbur's slop trough.  Clocking in just before an hour and a half shows prudence, especially for the youngest viewers, and the story spins its way just like reading the book.

1055610,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NA6CP4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I made a bold claim a few weeks back when I reviewed the supremely adorable `Babe' and said that it was better than `Charlottes Web'.  Now that I finally got around to watching `Charlottes Web' yet again I have to say that I stand by that claim.  This film is really cute (not please that my statement was not in regards to the hugely successful and priceless children's book, but made towards the film adaptation) but it can't hold up to `Babe's wonderful ability to engage from start to finish without hesitation.This adaptation gives the beloved children's story a live-action makeover and enlists some very big names to sell the large cast of characters.  Everyone from Dakota Fanning to Oprah Winfrey make an appearance in this film, and for the most part they all do their fair share of wonderful to make this a memorable and enjoyable experience.  It misses some of the childlike splendor that was so prevalent in `Babe' by casting Fanning as Fern, but I'll get to that in a minute.We all know the story, so let's just get right into the films pros and cons.Pros would have to be the extensive cast of voice actors who all really breathe life into their characters.  Steve Buscemi is perfect as Templeton, and John Cleese is instantly vibrant and engrossing as Samuel the Sheep.  Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire, while not instantly recognizable, ham it up as Bitsy and Betsy, and Robert Redford is wonderfully cast as Ike, the Horse suffering from arachnophobia.  Thomas Haden Church and Andre 3000 steal the show as the Crows Brooks and Elwyn, even if they are barely in the film.  I wasn't too impressed with Cedric or Oprah (I had no idea that was her) but I think that has more to do with the fact that the geese looked really fake to me.  Dominic Scott Kay is perfect as Wilber, but no one can top the magnificence that was Julia Roberts as Charlotte.  Seriously, she was perfect, and if they gave away awards for voice acting then she deserves them all, for it was her warm a maternal tone that really made the film so soft and cuddly.The story itself is also a major plus, for it is so sweet and genuine and morally reflective of everything that we try and instill in our own children.  The film is also undeniable beautiful to watch, each and every scene as pretty as the books colorful pages.The cons to me really come in two forms.  The first is Fanning.  I love her, honestly, and have campaigned against all who have bashed her in the past for being too mature for her age.  She really has managed to bring in such strength and honesty to her performances in films like `I Am Sam' and `Man on Fire' that her maturity as an actress is really needed and welcome.  She also has been able to reel that back and deliver a supremely childlike performance in `War of the Worlds' that I was baffled with all the criticism she was receiving as a young actress.  I must say though, that here she is far too mature for her character.  When she tries to pull off her youth it comes off forced and out of place.  She couldn't find the balance that she found in `War of the Worlds' to make this remotely believable.  The first scene alone, with her father and Wilber, was painful to watch.My second con here is in the form of Wilber himself.  I just didn't get it.  I mean, everyone else was so lovable and funny and exciting and witty and Wilber was just kind of boring.  Here Charlotte is writing all these wonderful things about him and I found myself wondering why he really deserved it.  He was sweet, sure, but no where near `terrific' or even `some pig'.Sarah McLachlan sings over the closing credits about an `ordinary miracle' (such a pretty voice for such a pretty song) but in my opinion the film could have used a little less ordinary and little more extraordinary.That said, the film is still cute and charming and is sure to keep children satisfied, and there is enough humor to keep us parents interested as well.  It's a win-win kind of film, but if your kids are determined to watch a movie about a pig, I'd be more inclined to put on `Babe'.",4,"It's like `Babe', just not as good...",1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,4063,"['made', 'bold', 'claim', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'when', 'reviewed', 'supremely', 'adorable', 'Babe', 'said', 'was', 'better', 'Charlottes', 'Web', 'Now', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Charlottes', 'Web', 'yet', 'again', 'have', 'say', 'stand', 'claim', 'film', 'really', 'cute', 'not', 'please', 'statement', 'was', 'not', 'regards', 'hugely', 'successful', 'priceless', 'children', 'book', 'made', 'towards', 'film', 'adaptation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'Babe', 'wonderful', 'ability', 'engage', 'start', 'finish', 'hesitation.This', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'children', 'story', 'live-action', 'makeover', 'very', 'big', 'names', 'sell', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'make', 'appearance', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'fair', 'share', 'wonderful', 'make', 'memorable', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'childlike', 'splendor', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'Babe', 'casting', 'Fanning', 'Fern', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.We', 'know', 'story', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'right', 'films', 'pros', 'cons.Pros', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'extensive', 'cast', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'breathe', 'life', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'perfect', 'Templeton', 'John', 'Cleese', 'instantly', 'vibrant', 'engrossing', 'Samuel', 'Sheep', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'not', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'ham', 'up', 'Bitsy', 'Betsy', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'Ike', 'Horse', 'suffering', 'arachnophobia', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Andre', '3000', 'steal', 'show', 'Crows', 'Brooks', 'Elwyn', 'even', 'are', 'barely', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Cedric', 'Oprah', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'fact', 'geese', 'looked', 'really', 'fake', 'Dominic', 'Scott', 'Kay', 'perfect', 'Wilber', 'one', 'can', 'top', 'magnificence', 'was', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Charlotte', 'Seriously', 'was', 'perfect', 'gave', 'away', 'awards', 'voice', 'acting', 'then', 'was', 'warm', 'maternal', 'tone', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'soft', 'cuddly.The', 'story', 'also', 'major', 'plus', 'so', 'sweet', 'genuine', 'morally', 'reflective', 'everything', 'try', 'instill', 'own', 'children', 'film', 'also', 'undeniable', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'scene', 'as', 'pretty', 'books', 'colorful', 'pages.The', 'cons', 'really', 'come', 'two', 'forms', 'first', 'Fanning', 'love', 'honestly', 'have', 'campaigned', 'who', 'have', 'bashed', 'past', 'being', 'too', 'mature', 'age', 'really', 'managed', 'bring', 'such', 'strength', 'honesty', 'performances', 'films', 'Am', 'Sam', 'Man', 'Fire', 'maturity', 'actress', 'really', 'needed', 'welcome', 'also', 'been', 'able', 'reel', 'back', 'deliver', 'supremely', 'childlike', 'performance', 'War', 'Worlds', 'was', 'baffled', 'criticism', 'was', 'receiving', 'young', 'actress', 'must', 'say', 'here', 'far', 'too', 'mature', 'character', 'When', 'pull', 'off', 'youth', 'off', 'forced', 'place', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'balance', 'found', 'War', 'Worlds', 'make', 'remotely', 'believable', 'first', 'scene', 'alone', 'father', 'Wilber', 'was', 'painful', 'watch.My', 'second', 'con', 'here', 'form', 'Wilber', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'mean', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'so', 'lovable', 'funny', 'exciting', 'witty', 'Wilber', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'boring', 'Here', 'Charlotte', 'writing', 'wonderful', 'things', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'really', 'deserved', 'was', 'sweet', 'sure', 'where', 'near', 'terrific', 'even', ""pig'.Sarah"", 'McLachlan', 'closing', 'credits', 'ordinary', 'miracle', 'pretty', 'voice', 'pretty', 'song', 'opinion', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'less', 'ordinary', 'little', 'more', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'cute', 'charming', 'sure', 'keep', 'children', 'satisfied', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'parents', 'interested', 'as', 'well', 'win-win', 'kind', 'film', 'kids', 'are', 'determined', 'watch', 'movie', 'pig', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'put', 'Babe']",N/A

1055618,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000NA6CP4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 4]","Watch out!Those words should ring in the minds of all those who choose to see CHARLOTTE'S WEB, especially those with fond childhood memories ofthe novel by E.B. White.. Although moving from paper to celluloid always entails changes, there are some fundamental flaws with this updated version (the first being the 1973 animated film). The flaws, however, do not -- thankfully! -- dominate the entire picture.For those of you who've lived under a stone for the past five decades, let me tell you a bit about this Newbery Honors book that is in the top 100 hardback booksellers of all time (those accolades alone should give one pause before making film comparisons but they must be made nonetheless since a film version now exists).My first comment has to be a parental warning. Although the cover looks childlike and fanciful, the story itself contains much more depth than simply anthropomorphizing. Within the story's fabric is the structure of life, death, and how we view our food. It becomes immediately apparent as little Fern learns that her father intends to kill the ""runt"" of a litter of pigs. He carries an axe in one hand and the piglet in the other, but is stopped short by Fern as she pleads with him to spare the animal. Unable to deny his daughter, the father acquiesces. But the redemption of the piglet (whom we come to know as Wilbur) may be short-lived. Christmas is around the corner and Fern's family needs seasonal pork. But another sort of savior weaves her way into the barn and befriends Wilbur. Her name, of course, is Charlotte. As all the other farm animals fidget over Wilbur's impending meeting with the smokehouse, Charlotte the spider decides to act. She writes ""Some Pig"" in her web, and this sparks a stampede of activity at Fern's family farm. Folks (humans) come from miles away to see this pig who warrants such special praise from a lowly insect.As Christmas approaches, Charlotte has to find more and more words to weave in order to keep Wilbur alive. She does so with the assistance of her fellow barnyard brethren. Most notable among them is Templeton the rat (voiced perfectly by Steve Buscemi,Art School Confidential). Usually very food-self-centric, Templeton learns the reason friendship is so important via his newfound interactions with living things rather than food-scraps.***SPOILERS AHEAD***It is the ending that gives this story its most non-childlike substance. The death of Charlotte is heartbreaking, but the rebirth of her egg-sack lets her live on. Wilbur, having saved the egg-sack, has, in effect, returned the favor Charlotte gave to him: saving his life. Wilbur sees many Christmases and several of the infant spiders stick around to live out their days (and the continuing cycle of life and death) with Wilbur and his eventual kin.The voices in the film are standard Hollywood fodder. Julia Roberts as Charlotte is okay, as is young Dominic Scott Kay as Wilbur the pig. John Cleese as Samuel the sheep carries some of the more lighter moments, as does Thomas Haden Church and Andre Benjamin as two confused but funny crows. But, again, the biggest boost voice-wise has to go to Steve Buscemi as Templeton the rat. His character goes through the greatest growth (from despicable to thoughtful) and Buscemi's narrative exposition is undeniably the best one for a rat considering his other film roles (The Big Lebowski,28 Days, etc).The biggest downside to the movie is that it separates too much the human world from the animal one. E.B. White's novelization pulls these items closer and closer, but here we witness Fern (Dakota Fanning,War of the Worlds, 2005) getting googly over a boy more than concerned with what happens to Wilbur (or even involved with what happens to him after Charlotte shows up and begins spinning her web-cabulary).Fern is a vital construct to the entire story, helping to keep Wilbur alive throughout the narrative (in the novel). But here we don't get that. It is all laid on Charlotte and Templeton (mostly) which deviates significantly from White's storyline; something to prepare yourself for.The flick is entertaining if a bit off-kilter from the novel. Kids will probably eat it up. And parents can run out and purchase one of the finest ""children's"" books ever published in order to inform their kids about what the story's really all about.",3,Deviates From The Novel But Has 'Character',1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,4336,"['Watch', 'out', 'words', 'should', 'ring', 'minds', 'who', 'choose', 'see', 'CHARLOTTE', 'WEB', 'especially', 'fond', 'childhood', 'memories', 'ofthe', 'novel', 'E.B', 'White..', 'moving', 'paper', 'celluloid', 'always', 'entails', 'changes', 'are', 'fundamental', 'flaws', 'updated', 'version', 'first', 'being', '1973', 'animated', 'film', 'flaws', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'thankfully', 'dominate', 'entire', 'picture.For', 'who', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'stone', 'past', 'five', 'decades', 'let', 'tell', 'bit', 'Newbery', 'Honors', 'book', 'top', '100', 'hardback', 'booksellers', 'time', 'accolades', 'alone', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'pause', 'making', 'film', 'comparisons', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'version', 'now', '.My', 'first', 'comment', 'be', 'parental', 'warning', 'cover', 'childlike', 'fanciful', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'simply', 'anthropomorphizing', 'story', 'fabric', 'structure', 'life', 'death', 'how', 'view', 'food', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'little', 'Fern', 'father', 'kill', 'runt', 'litter', 'pigs', 'axe', 'one', 'hand', 'piglet', 'other', 'stopped', 'short', 'Fern', 'spare', 'animal', 'Unable', 'deny', 'daughter', 'father', 'acquiesces', 'redemption', 'piglet', 'whom', 'come', 'know', 'Wilbur', 'may', 'be', 'short-lived', 'Christmas', 'corner', 'Fern', 'family', 'seasonal', 'pork', 'sort', 'savior', 'weaves', 'way', 'barn', 'Wilbur', 'name', 'course', 'Charlotte', 'other', 'farm', 'animals', 'fidget', 'Wilbur', 'impending', 'meeting', 'smokehouse', 'Charlotte', 'spider', 'act', 'Pig', 'web', 'stampede', 'activity', 'Fern', 'family', 'farm', 'Folks', 'humans', 'come', 'miles', 'away', 'see', 'pig', 'who', 'warrants', 'such', 'special', 'praise', 'lowly', 'insect.As', 'Christmas', 'approaches', 'Charlotte', 'find', 'more', 'more', 'words', 'weave', 'order', 'keep', 'Wilbur', 'alive', 'so', 'assistance', 'fellow', 'barnyard', 'brethren', 'Most', 'notable', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'voiced', 'perfectly', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'Usually', 'very', 'food-self-centric', 'Templeton', 'reason', 'friendship', 'so', 'important', 'newfound', 'interactions', 'living', 'things', 'rather', 'food-scraps', '***SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***It', 'ending', 'story', 'most', 'non-childlike', 'substance', 'death', 'Charlotte', 'heartbreaking', 'rebirth', 'egg-sack', 'lets', 'live', 'Wilbur', 'having', 'saved', 'egg-sack', 'effect', 'returned', 'favor', 'Charlotte', 'gave', 'saving', 'life', 'Wilbur', 'many', 'Christmases', 'several', 'infant', 'spiders', 'stick', 'live', 'out', 'days', 'continuing', 'cycle', 'life', 'death', 'Wilbur', 'eventual', 'kin.The', 'voices', 'film', 'are', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fodder', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Charlotte', 'okay', 'young', 'Dominic', 'Scott', 'Kay', 'Wilbur', 'pig', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Samuel', 'sheep', 'more', 'lighter', 'moments', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'two', 'confused', 'funny', 'crows', 'again', 'biggest', 'boost', 'voice-wise', 'go', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'character', 'greatest', 'growth', 'despicable', 'thoughtful', 'Buscemi', 'narrative', 'exposition', 'undeniably', 'best', 'one', 'rat', 'considering', 'other', 'film', 'roles', 'Big', 'Lebowski,28', 'Days', 'etc', '.The', 'biggest', 'downside', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'human', 'world', 'animal', 'one', 'E.B', 'White', 'novelization', 'items', 'closer', 'closer', 'here', 'witness', 'Fern', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'War', 'Worlds', '2005', 'getting', 'googly', 'boy', 'more', 'concerned', 'what', 'Wilbur', 'even', 'involved', 'what', 'Charlotte', 'up', 'spinning', 'web-cabulary', '.Fern', 'vital', 'construct', 'entire', 'story', 'helping', 'keep', 'Wilbur', 'alive', 'narrative', 'novel', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'laid', 'Charlotte', 'Templeton', 'mostly', 'significantly', 'White', 'storyline', 'something', 'prepare', 'for.The', 'flick', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'off-kilter', 'novel', 'Kids', 'will', 'probably', 'eat', 'up', 'parents', 'can', 'run', 'out', 'purchase', 'one', 'finest', 'children', 'books', 'ever', 'published', 'order', 'inform', 'kids', 'what', 'story', 'really']",N/A

Before today, ""The Wild Thornberry's Movie"" had been my favorite because of the drama in it. Let me tell you a little something about this movie so as to wet your taste buds for this movie.This movie has an all star cast. It starts with a girl named Fern, just a little girl in a small town. Fern is played by Dakota Fanning. She starts to look after a runt pig whom she names Wilbur. She then has to give the pig to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman (played by Gary Basaraba). There she finds many animals, like cows, sheep, and even ""The Rat"" named Templeton (voiced by Steve Buscemi).Now, I have to take a moment here to introduce you to some of the animals in this picture. We have Samuel the Sheep (voiced by John Cleese). There is Gussy the Goose (voiced by Oprah Winfrey). We cannot leave out Golly the Goose (voiced by Cedric the Entertainer). Who would forget to mention Bitsy the Cow (voiced by Kathy Bates). Reba McEntire did the voice of Betsy the Cow. Who did the voice for Ike the Horse? None other than the world famous Robert Redford. Brooks the Cow was voiced by Thomas Haden Church. There was Elwyn the Crow (voiced by Andre' Benjamin). Also in this movie was Uncle the Pig, and he was voiced by Abraham Benrubi. Now for the final three. There was Wilbur the Pig, who was voiced by Dominic Scott Kay. Who would leave out Charlotte the Spider, voiced by none other than Julia Roberts. Lastly, we have the Narrator, who was Sam Shepard.Now, I do not want to ruin any more of the movie for you. Let's just say that the whole goal of this movie is to keep Wilbur from becoming someone's next ""bacon cheeseburger"" or ""porkchop of the day"". Many unforgettable moments fill this movie and, if you cry during movies, then this movie will do it. Yes, it will do it.This non-animated version story of the E.B. White children's masterpiece is told in a fashion that will last more than one generation. Don't miss your opportunity to see what will one day be a classic. Oh, if you do enjoy it, an animated ""Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure"" has been made, but it is NOT a sequel to this movie.

1055627,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000NA6CP4,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 11]","This film adaptation of E.B. White's ""Charlotte's Web"" is one heck of a charmer: delightful, funny, and touching, flaunting its family-oriented plot with themes of friendship, loyalty, and to some extent, isolation. I enjoy films like this because they tell a simple story without getting sickeningly sweet about it; there's an underlying darkness to this story, especially when it comes to the realities of life, death, and the role animals play in a human's existence. Very early on in the film, Wilbur the Pig (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) learns that humans don't necessarily love pigs, but they sure do love pork. And consider the moment directly after we first meet Wilbur; we see a shot of bacon strips frying in a skillet.The story of Wilbur is classic, pretty much to the point of becoming a fable. He's an underdog, born as the runt of a very large litter of piglets. We first see him trying to nurse on his mother, having absolutely no luck finding an unoccupied teat. The sow's owner, Mr. Arable (Kevin Anderson), notices this, and immediately decides that the best course of action is to kill the piglet with a dramatically large axe. This is something that his daughter, Fern (Dakota Fanning), will not allow; ""If I was born small,"" she pleads, ""would you have killed me?"" She immediately takes the piglet and begins caring for him. She feeds him. She sings him to sleep every night. She even brings him to school, where she unsuccessfully attempts to hide him in her desk.But after a while, Wilbur becomes too big for her to care for at home. Her only option is to send him across the street and place him in her uncle's barn (however, she still plans to see him everyday). This is the point at which we meet the rest of the animal cast, all of which begin speaking. Most of their initial dialogue is demeaning mutterings about how Wilbur is a sad, pathetic, and downright stupid animal (not helped by the fact that Wilbur tried to escape in order to reunite with Fern). All the barn characters are appropriately developed, each having a specific personality quirk that give them some dimension: the cows Bisty and Betsy (Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire) are consistently pessimistic about Wilbur's future; Samuel the Sheep (John Cleese) desperately wants his companion sheep to stop following his every lead; Ike the Horse (Robert Redford) is mildly bitter and fearful of spiders; Gussy the Goose (Oprah Winfrey) is level-headed, but her husband, Golly (Cedric the Entertainer) verbally bows to her every whim.Templeton the Rat (Steve Buscemi) is one of the most self-serving fictional characters in existence. With him it's never a matter of helping someone in need; it's a matter of helping someone in need if it means access to more free food. No wonder the barn animals despise him. The fact that he's brutally honest makes matters worse. He gives Wilbur the cold hard truth: come Christmastime, he'll end up as the holiday ham on the dinner table. Wilbur had already seen the dreaded smokehouse--a solitary structure made to look as drab and heartbreaking as a prison--but he never believed that Fern's uncle would ever do him any harm. Now he's in a state of panic; he's a spring pig who only wants the chance to see the Christmas snow.And that's when Charlotte the Spider (Julia Roberts) is introduced. Charlotte A. Cavatica is her full name, and despite her sweet (if a little monotone) voice, she may actually be frightening to those who have a fear of spiders; she's not made to look overtly cartoonish, nor is she cute. Nonetheless, she and Wilbur quickly form a friendship, helped by the fact that the other barn animals find them both undesirable. In realizing Wilbur's situation, she decides to help him. ""How?"" Wilbur timidly asks. ""I don't know,"" she replies, ""but I made a promise, and I never break my promises."" How sweet a sentiment, especially when coming from a life form that does a better job in instilling fear than in making friends.As it turns out, her very own web is the most useful tool. When the farmer's son arrives to give Wilbur his slops (which Templeton is simply mad about), he sees a spider web with the words ""Some Pig"" written on it. Almost immediately, the entire town is abuzz with the talk of this miracle web, turning Fern's uncle--Homer Zuckerman (Gary Basaraba)--into the local celebrity. The front pages of the newspapers proudly display photos of Wilbur, the wonder pig who clearly has someone watching over him. It also makes the bond between him and Fern even stronger, something that gives her mother (Essie Davis) cause for concern. In two distinct scenes, she speaks with the local doctor (Beau Bridges), a character I wish had been given more screen time; his musings on the innocence of childhood and the wonder of spider webs were quite interesting.Within weeks of Wilbur's discovery, the fervor dies down. This means that he's no closer to being spared than he was before Charlotte came along. This sets the rest of the film into motion, the majority of which involves Charlotte's attempts to help her friend. More words are written, resulting in more press. Still, Wilbur's life remains at stake. At one point, she wonders why the humans continuously need to be reminded of what's been in front of them the entire time. I actually found that to be very profound, despite the fact that it's part of a child-friendly film; it's as if she's daring us to reconsider the thoughts and feelings we have for anyone or anything we know. I suppose the same idea applies to animals, which is problematic for those of us who aren't vegetarians. One look at Wilbur and I guarantee you that bacon will look less appetizing (if only for a little while).Such is the way with Underdog Story films, which have been notoriously effective at instilling compassion, love, and admiration for the main character. Wilbur is eventually entered into a county fair contest; one that he thinks will determine his life expectancy. We want for him to win. We want his life to be spared. Basically, we want a happy ending. I obviously can't give away the final outcome for those who have not read the book or seen the 1973 animated version. What I will say is that some of the more sensitive viewers will most likely be bawling by the time they leave the theater. I admit that I came close; there are some genuinely heartfelt moments that transcended childhood levels of entertainment. I greatly enjoyed ""Charlotte's Web""; it's thoughtful, it's fun, and it's generally well made.",4,Along Came a Spider,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,6520,"['film', 'adaptation', 'E.B', 'White',

1055630,A1CZW9Q0JXEE6N,B000NA6CP4,Clint D. Hayes,"[40, 49]","As with Walden's first adaptation--The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe--this is an okay movie that could have been vastly better. It is a superior adaptation to Wardrobe, in that it follows the source material more faithfully both in story and characterization, but it still fails most in those key areas, and in important ways that the animated version didn't.The most off-putting and probably most egregious error on director Winick's part is to make Fern such an impertinent, downright snotty little girl. In the book Fern is determined, but not rude. Neither is her father the milquetoast that he's made to be in the film. Ditto Templeton the rat, who is turned from an irascible malcontent into an outright bully. Such characterizations are completely unnecessary and in fact detract from the story. (Which again was the core failure with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Seems to be a Walden thing.)This ties into a problem with the casting in general. Julia Roberts was simply the wrong voice for Charlotte. The '73 version had the good grace and foresight to cast Debbie Reynolds as Charlotte. Reynolds' soothing, melodic voice was perfect for a creature meant to be soothing and enchanting. There is life and wonder and hope in it. Roberts' voice is simply too flat and nasally, and becomes actually grating. The casting on the rest of the animals was fine (though the body humor got old after the second ""joke""; I long for the days when body ""humor"" wasn't considered simply part of kids' movie genre), but of the humans only Beau Bridges stands out. I like the actors who played the various parts, but they too come off as lifeless. The whole affair is simply flat, which is ironic considering the wondrousness of the tale attempting to be told.And then there's the decision to go with hyperrealistic special effects. I found myself wishing they'd stayed with the neat animation that introduced the movie. Instead we're treated to super-macro shots of a spider worthy of an electron microscope. Director Winick should have had the sense to realize that there's no way to make a spider cuddly in close-up. The animated '73 film was wise enough not to try; it showed Charlotte in just enough detail to give her form and features, and left it that. This one, again like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, wants to show off at the expense of the story.Some of the non-book material is witty, but for the most part it's not and obviously tacked on to tickle kiddies' funny bones. It does, so in that sense I suppose it works, but it's laziness on the part of the filmmakers to feel it's necessary.In sum, what should be a magical, uplifting movie comes off as flat and, in fact, a little boring. Maybe one of these days the film industry will discover that special effects and high-caliber casts aren't enough to save a lackluster script. It always comes down to the writing, and it simply isn't very good in this version of Charlotte's Web. It has its heart in the right place, and doesn't stray far from the original book in actual plot, for which I have to commend it at least three stars, but it's more interested in being a comedy made for kids than a drama made for smart people, young and old. This is why the '73 version continues to hold my kids in thrall after at least a score of viewings, but they were so bored on a second watching of this new film that they wanted to leave early.",3,The 1973 animated version is much better,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3412,"['Walden', 'first', 'adaptation', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'okay', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'vastly', 'better', 'superior', 'adaptation', 'Wardrobe', 'source', 'material', 'more', 'faithfully', 'story', 'characterization', 'still', 'most', 'key', 'areas', 'important', 'ways', 'animated', 'version', 'most', 'off-putting', 'probably', 'most', 'egregious', 'error', 'director', 'Winick', 'part', 'make', 'Fern', 'impertinent', 'downright', 'snotty', 'little', 'girl', 'book', 'Fern', 'determined', 'not', 'rude', 'father', 'milquetoast', 'made', 'be', 'film', 'Ditto', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'who', 'turned', 'irascible', 'malcontent', 'outright', 'bully', 'Such', 'characterizations', 'are', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'fact', 'detract', 'story', 'Which', 'again', 'was', 'core', 'failure', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'be', 'Walden', 'thing', 'problem', 'casting', 'general', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'was', 'simply', 'wrong', 'voice', 'Charlotte', ""'73"", 'version', 'had', 'good', 'grace', 'foresight', 'cast', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Charlotte', 'Reynolds', 'soothing', 'melodic', 'voice', 'was', 'perfect', 'creature', 'meant', 'be', 'soothing', 'enchanting', 'life', 'wonder', 'hope', 'Roberts', 'voice', 'simply', 'too', 'flat', 'nasally', 'actually', 'grating', 'casting', 'rest', 'animals', 'was', 'fine', 'body', 'humor', 'got', 'old', 'second', 'joke', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'body', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'simply', 'part', 'kids', 'movie', 'genre', 'humans', 'only', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'out', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'various', 'parts', 'too', 'come', 'off', 'lifeless', 'whole', 'affair', 'simply', 'flat', 'ironic', 'considering', 'wondrousness', 'tale', 'attempting', 'be', 'told.And', 'then', 'decision', 'go', 'hyperrealistic', 'special', 'effects', 'found', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'stayed', 'neat', 'animation', 'introduced', 'movie', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'treated', 'super-macro', 'shots', 'spider', 'worthy', 'electron', 'microscope', 'Director', 'Winick', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'sense', 'realize', 'way', 'make', 'spider', 'cuddly', 'close-up', 'animated', 'film', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'not', 'try', 'showed', 'Charlotte', 'just', 'enough', 'detail', 'give', 'form', 'features', 'left', 'one', 'again', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'show', 'off', 'expense', 'story.Some', 'non-book', 'material', 'witty', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'obviously', 'tacked', 'tickle', 'kiddies', 'funny', 'bones', 'so', 'sense', 'suppose', 'laziness', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'feel', 'necessary.In', 'sum', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'magical', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'off', 'flat', 'fact', 'little', 'boring', 'Maybe', 'one', 'days', 'film', 'industry', 'will', 'discover', 'special', 'effects', 'high-caliber', 'casts', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'lackluster', 'script', 'always', 'down', 'writing', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'version', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'heart', 'right', 'place', ""n't"", 'stray', 'far', 'original', 'book', 'actual', 'plot', 'have', 'commend', 'least', 'three', 'stars', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'comedy', 'made', 'kids', 'drama', 'made', 'smart', 'people', 'young', 'old', 'why', ""'73"", 'version', 'hold', 'kids', 'thrall', 'least', 'score', 'viewings', 'were', 'so', 'bored', 'second', 'watching', 'new', 'film', 'wanted', 'leave', 'early']",N/A
1055631,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000NA6CP4,Craig Matteson,"[3, 4]","Like all classic stories that last for generations, Charlotte's Web (by E. B. White from 1952) speaks to many people about a variety of things.  It can be a touching and somewhat sentimental fantasy of life on a farm with some interesting characters.  Or it can be a parable of how the ordinary isn't as ordinary as we suspect.  It is only ordinary because we fail to actually look at what is happening around us at each instant.  If we actually saw how marvelous each moment was could we ever get anything done?  And if getting all those things done costs us seeing all those miracles is it really worth doing?And then there is the way the story makes the normally hideous spider into something beautiful and an object of great sentiment.  Who isn't touched deeply when Charlotte, who has been so noble and good to Wilbur, dies?  That is a powerful message and a manifestation of the author's strong abilities to imagine and portray.  Not many people would have even thought of pulling something like that off let alone having the ability to write it.  And the movie makers do a great job in keeping Charlotte a spider, but without taking away our ability to empathize with her and see her as Wilbur does.But the way of seeing the story that struck me most of all was the way the story points up the power of words, of writing.  By searching for and finding the one right word, Charlotte changes the lives of every person who comes into contact with her writing.  It not only benefits Wilbur, she changes the lives of those people forever.  They will never see their lives the same way again.  White also points out how much work writing is because Charlotte works so hard to write.  Her writing even allows Wilbur to see himself differently.It is a very good story, a very good movie adaptation, and very much worth seeing.The performances by everyone in the story, whether their faces are seen on the screen or not, are very good.

With all the din and clamor for quality movies for families, this one should have shot to the top of the charts and stayed there. A perfect story. impeccable cast, amazing script, all wrapped up in a little web with a few words makes for a magical movie experience. So the only conclusion I can make is that this movie was just too good for our world.All of us know this story, and know it well. Little Fern Arable (Dakota Fanning saves runty pig Wilbur from certain death, and raises it to be her own. Money and space lacking, Fern gives us the pig to live at her uncle's farm, where he meets a hoard of animals who teach him about life, including one very talented spider named Charlotte (voiced by Julia Roberts).First published in 1952 (and losing the Newbery Award... what happened that year?), E. B. White composed a book that is perfect in every way. Ask 100 different readers of Charlotte's Web what the book is about, and you'll hear a 100 different answers. E. B. White's brilliant book speaks about so many issues without ever seeming like an issue book, that in turn, it's about life. And that life they bring to the screen in a delightful, encouraging way.The flawless blending of live action, animatronics, and CGI make for a visually wonderful movie. Our animal friends (voiced by both new and established talent alike) are real and pleasingly playful; the look of joy on Stuart's face as he is getting sheared is worth the giggle in itself. Wilbur's mud party, Charlotte's webs, Templeton's raucous smelly egg splatter all are richly detailed. One poignant scene still chills me: when Charlotte's egg sack is transported back to the barn from the fair, and all of the animals take turns during the winter to tend to it, no dries eyes were found here; that was visual poetry. Add to that the marvelous photographed scenery (I haven't seen a fall that beautiful since leaving New Hampshire), and you have the makings of a classic.And perhaps, in thinking about other classics we consider as we think back to our childhoods, this movie just needs some time to ground itself into our collective national conscious. For this adaptation of Charlotte's Web is a beautiful reminder of how, every once in a while, we get things right in this country, and that, in itself, should be celebrated. Kudos for everyone who came together to produce Charlotte's Web.

The movie turned out to be both extremely charming and very well done.  The opening animations were very reminiscent of the animation during when the book was released and a good touch.  I'm a twenty four year old male and found myself a bit misty eyed during the sad scene.  This movie is about the appreciation of life no matter how small and a valuable lesson to children and for those who need reminding.This movie is highly recommended for children.  In todays society, a movie that treasures life no matter how small is extremely rare.  The fact that a simple spider can be befriended so wholeheartedly will teach children that all life is precious and not to be neglected.  The sad scene will teach children about nature that the inevitable things in life and how it must be accepted.  That there is a silver lining in even seemingly bad things.For adults, the movie will remind of us all of a more innocent childhood and perhaps even encourage adults to appreciate life even further.  That all life no matter how small is indeed valuable.  Older viewers will also enjoy the humor and the star studded cast.A very feel good movie with some beautiful moments and some heartbreaking ones.  Highly recommended for both the young and the old.

I'm also a big fan of the animated film, and the live-action feature is just as good. The movie stays true to E.B. White's book about a clever spider who befriends a barnyard pig and uses her spider web to help save his life. The all-star cast of the film is impressive and features Julia Roberts as the voice of Charlotte, Steve Buscemi as the voice of Templeton, and Dakota Fanning as Fern.

The story of the friendship between a runt pig and a spider in the barn has been around entertaining children for dozens of years.  But I have never seen a production that came even close to the new movie in theaters everywhere.The recent release of CHARLOTTE'S WEB is simply amazing.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out, and I'll really be disappointed if there isn't some in-depth special features regarding the making the of the film, particularly the computer animation aspects.  Watching the animals talking and interacting onscreen was nothing short of magical.There is an incredible shift from the human point of view in the film to the animal one that is almost seamless unless you're looking for it.  I was, and it was still so effortless that the transition doesn't jar viewers at all.  The handoff is smooth and remains highly believable.My 9-year-old went with my wife and I, and even though he'd seen the story a number of times on DVD, he fell in love with it all over again.  I loved hearing him laugh, and I couldn't help but remember the first time I'd heard CHARLOTTE'S WEB read to me by a schoolteacher.The story is timeless and will always be around.  But it's been waiting all this time for movie-making magic to truly unlock a way for audiences to watch it presented so much in the flesh.No only is the video aspect so good, but the voice talent gathered for the film is outstanding.  Julia Roberts, Steve Buscemi, Oprah Winfrey, Cedric The Entertainer, Reba McEntire, and many other recognizeable voices (including Sam Shepard as the narrator) all contributed to this amazing experience.If you want to have a great time and be a child again, go see CHARLOTTE'S WEB.

1055688,A2777YVBKQ4KHD,B000NA6CP4,"M. M. Jones ""poetsheart""","[1, 1]","I had a fair share of both likes and dislikes with this film.  First on my 2 major dislikes  1 the Mom she wastes way too much film time  whining to the family Dr  about Fern's habit of hanging out in the barnyard.  She's also always dressed like she's going to a  tea party.  Your average farm wife wore clothes they didn't mind getting dirty,  They readily got their own hands dirty doing their fair share of farm chores and I'm guessing didn't get their knickers in a bunch if their daughter was a bit of a tomboy and hung out with the animals.  Farm lands were widespread  it's often that except at school your  siblings and maybe cousins if you had em were you're only playmates.2nd  Those stupid crows what are we trying to redo  the moose brothers from  brother bear?  It wasn't even remotely funny.  It was a waste of  time diverting from  the major story  and never even in the book.  It was what  I would've left on the cutting room floor in favor of some more charming music.The music by the way wasn't worth it.  The animated film at least had catchy  music you could sing along with  and  feel good hearing.Now I thought both Dakota fanning and  Julia Roberts  played their roles so wonderfully  that that was worth the rest.  There was a little bathroom humor but let's face it  everyone farts and barn yards just do not smell sweet because there is so much manure  to deal with.  that's a fact of life.  So is that the average farm animal is always  at risk of  being dinner except the horse,  Sheep, geese  pigs cows and chickens,  the cows stop  giving good milk,  The  chicken who lays the  least  eggs  they could easily be  dinner in hours or days.  It's a fact of life  and  if  you're  upset  by me telling you this then you're in denile about that big mac you scarfed down yesterday.This story does help illustrate that those  animals were  alive  and had faces and such recently.  However don't kid yourself the average  animal doesn't live in fear of being Sundays dinner.  However the story does show the fact of life that is what  farm animals were raised for.My 2 favorites  Charlotte for her gentle compassionate freindship.  I admit I cried when she died even though I knew it was coming.  The other even though his lines where cheesy (no pun intended) Templton  he was so rattish.  self centered yet  clever, resorsful and  in his own way so disgusting it was in a way cute.So for an evening of entertainment rent this movie (it might even be at your local library.

I haven't seen any other film versions, either. Hence, this was my first exposure to this absolutely wonderful tale of salvation, triumph & renewal. I don't want to repeat comments of previous reviewers, or blab away the plot, but I was moved and entertained. Director Gary Winick has presented this fine ""lesson in life"" with originality and ingenuity. I am bothered about a few things, most notably that the name of Dominic Scott Kay (Wilbur)  is not mentioned by most reviewers, and his name isn't even on the DVD cover / poster. Such an oversight is unforgiveable; indeed, he held together all animal aspects of this film. Also, the film received NO Oscar recognition at all; Danny Elfman's brilliant score is the best I've heard all year. It is a character all by itself. I love this film for the basic life-lessons it imparts: the cruelty of life, the value of friendship, the common sense in knowing ""someone"" before you judge them, and more. All kids can learn from  these simple basics. I also want to mention that this stellar cast is beyond compare. Sure the rat and the crows were a riot, as well as the cows & sheep, but the one that stands out is Robert Redford's horse; my favorite line is when Charlotte comes near and he says ""Please don't hurt me"".

I was lent the DVD by a friend and watched it in some interest because I had heard it was a children's classic.It may be my very own attitude, but I have always believed that to be really good, a children's tale must be one that captures and convinces adults, too, and not because they love it on account of having grown up with it. While the tale is sweet and capturing, too many things strike me as being illogical in an emotionally manipulating way. I am not so certain whether Wilbur's completely ""positive"" attitude is one I would wish my own children to adopt; it is, on the downside, severely noncritical and superficial. If you ask me, Wilbur is not only sweet - he is too cute to be true.The spider Charlotte, the real protagonist of the story, is depicted in an even more manipulative way: two eyes instead of eight, a warm, kind voice (everybody knows that one of the most sneaky and eerie characteristics of a spider is the fact that they never make any kind of noise), smooth, almost dancer-like movements instead of the twitching, nervous ones that usually make spiders so creepy. That she can read and write can of course be banished to the realms of a fairy tale; and perhaps this is what so irritated me about the story - it does not seem to know whether it wants to be realistic, so that one can apply it to everyday life, or a fairy tale, where naturally things happen the way they would not outside of a book respectively a TV screen.In the end, it stroke me as particularly sad that this story has most probably never convinced any child to eat the least little pound of pork less instead of supporting the cruel and unnecessary intensive stock-rearing that seems so perfectly normal today. That would indeed be an ""ordinary miracle"" - not seeing the world through a fluffy pink cloud where everything and everybody seems ""cute"", the way it does to Wilbur.",3,"Entertaining, but also really nave and childish",1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2069,"['begin', 'would', 'like', 'remark', 'am', '40', 'years', 'age', 'never', 'read', 'watched', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'have', 'different', 'approach', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', 'lent', 'DVD', 'friend', 'watched', 'interest', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'children', 'classic.It', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'own', 'attitude', 'have', 'always', 'believed', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'children', 'tale', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'convinces', 'adults', 'too', 'not', 'love', 'account', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'tale', 'sweet', 'capturing', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'strike', 'being', 'illogical', 'emotionally', 'manipulating', 'way', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'Wilbur', 'completely', 'positive', 'attitude', 'one', 'would', 'wish', 'own', 'children', 'adopt', 'downside', 'severely', 'noncritical', 'superficial', 'ask', 'Wilbur', 'not', 'only', 'sweet', 'too', 'cute', 'be', 'true.The', 'spider', 'Charlotte', 'real', 'protagonist', 'story', 'depicted', 'even', 'more', 'manipulative', 'way', 'two', 'eyes', 'instead', 'eight', 'warm', 'kind', 'voice', 'everybody', 'one', 'most', 'sneaky', 'eerie', 'characteristics', 'spider', 'fact', 'never', 'make', 'kind', 'noise', 'smooth', 'almost', 'dancer-like', 'movements', 'instead', 'twitching', 'nervous', 'ones', 'usually', 'make', 'spiders', 'so', 'creepy', 'can', 'read', 'write', 'can', 'course', 'be', 'banished', 'realms', 'fairy', 'tale', 'perhaps', 'what', 'so', 'irritated', 'story', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'be', 'realistic', 'one', 'can', 'apply', 'everyday', 'life', 'fairy', 'tale', 'where', 'naturally', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'outside', 'book', 'respectively', 'TV', 'screen.In', 'end', 'stroke', 'particularly', 'sad', 'story', 'most', 'probably', 'never', 'convinced', 'child', 'eat', 'least', 'little', 'pound', 'pork', 'instead', 'supporting', 'cruel', 'unnecessary', 'intensive', 'stock-rearing', 'so', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'today', 'would', 'indeed', 'be', 'ordinary', 'miracle', 'not', 'seeing', 'world', 'fluffy', 'pink', 'cloud', 'where', 'everything', 'everybody', 'cute', 'way', 'Wilbur']",N/A

I have loved and treasured the book ""Charlotte's Web"" ever since I was little. I still remember the time I was in Italy with my family and it was a rainy day so my dad rented the old edition of ""Charlotte's Web"" from an American movie shop. At the end, me and my sister were both crying. My sister was crying because Charlotte died. I was crying because we didn't get to see Charlotte die. Though I was younger then, and have matured greatly since, I couldn't help but see the new remake of the film. What appealed to me most about this film is the stellar all-star cast. It was absolutely PACKED with some of the best actors of today (and yesterday too!), including my favorites John Cleese and Dakota Fanning and Julia Roberts (who was PERFECT for Charlotte). Not only that, but we got Oprah Winfrey, Robert Redford, Thomas Haden Church, Cedric The Entertainer, and a million others. First of all, the new movie is very, very, very true to the book. In fact if I go and read the book over right now I'm sure about 95% of its content would have been in the film. It was also very funny and I found myself laughing more than I thought I would. The animals in Zuckerman's Farm are very, very well done and Templeton the rat is a fantastic character. The one thing that bothered me is that Dakota Fanning's acting skills were very disappointing. When you compare her role as Fern to her roles in ""I Am Sam"" or ""War of the Worlds,"" her role in CW is surprisingly below-average. She was still a good choice for Fern, but I felt like she was NOT using her full potential, which I know she has. And after the movie was done this guy was giving out free posters so I grabbed one. And people stared at me as I was leaving with the look that says ""Why the hell is that teenager over there carrying a Charlotte's Web poster??"" And I stare back with the look that says ""Screw you, Charlotte's Web owns joo!""

Her dad (Kevin Anderson) picks up a runt and an ax and heads towards the door. Shocked, Fern pleads for the little pigs life and nurses him along, taking him everywhere with her. A few weeks later, Mom (Essie Davis) and Dad insist Fern take the pig over to her Uncle's barn, across the road. She can still visit him everyday, but they need to concentrate on the harvest and don't have animals anymore. In his new home, Wilbur (Dominic Scott Kay) misses Fern, but he soon meets the other animals; Samuel the sheep (John Cleese), Gussy and Golly the geese (Oprah Winfrey, Cedric the Entertainer), Bitsy and Betsy the cows (Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire), Ike the horse (Robert Redford) and Templeton the rat (Steve Buscemi) who delights in the new pig's slop providing him with a new food source. But the animals are too wrapped up in their own concerns and Wilbur is lonely. Soon, a spider named Charlotte (Julia Roberts) appears and befriends Wilbur who soon learns of his fate, the smokehouse for Christmas. But Charlotte is determined to help change Wilbur's fate.  ""Charlotte's Web"", based on the classic children's book by E. B. White, was previously made as a fully animated film. In this new version, all of the animals are animated using CGI, but they live in Fern's real, idealized, world. The look of the film is the best part of the project.  Dakota Fanning is a good choice for this role, she's a good choice to appear in any kid's role. She is a very good actress and brings a lot of depth and interest to every role she has appeared in. As Fern, she makes us believe in the little girl's quest to keep this pig alive and we believe how close they become.  The mix of CGI animals in a live action world works because the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to make the film seem like a storybook. The first few frames show the credits against graphic images, which could be cutouts from a picture book. Slowly, the film dissolves into live action. When the animals first appear, and begin talking, we buy into this. It works.  As Wilbur makes himself at home and meets all of the other animals, we get a picture of what life is like on this farm. With such a large cast of voice actors, some of the performances are naturally better than others. Julie Roberts, who plays Charlotte, is the least successful. If she reads children's books to her own children in the same way, she must have a terrible time getting them to sleep. She reads the lines in a very modulated way, varying her delivery very little, showing almost no emotion. In short, she is boring. When a name actor like Roberts takes on a role like this, they should try to make it interesting or fun. Instead, Roberts seems to be merely reading her lines. Her talents would be better doing the narration.That said, Sam Shepherd provides the narration and his soft, folksy voice proves to be the perfect accompaniment to the story.The most successful voice actor is Steve Buscemi as Templeton the rat. He goes the furthest towards establishing a real character; Templeton is a rat and looks out for himself, first and foremost, and Buscemi gets this across with his acting and the dialogue. It is also believable when he starts to become a part of Wilbur's defacto posse. Thomas Haden Church and Andre Benjamin play a pair of crows who are constantly in fear of that guy who appears in every cornfield, the scarecrow. They add a nice jolt of comic relief every time they pop up. John Cleese has some fun as Samuel the sheep, who constantly berates the other sheep for following along, lock step, with no thought of their own. Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer play a pair of geese who are interesting but ultimately forgettable. Reba McEntire and Kathy Bates play a pair of cows. I still haven't figured out why Bates has to mimic McEntire's speech pattern, but I guess the cows have to have to a unified country accent. Robert Redford voices the cantankerous horse Ike. He does a better job than you might think or expect.""Charlotte's Web"" is one of my favorite childhood books and any film would have a long way to go to approach the classic book. This film doesn't do it, but it does approach the tone of the book more closely than the fully animated version. The combination of Fanning, the realistic animated animals and the picture book settings work in the film's favor. If only the name actors had been more consistent and better in their work of bringing these animals to life.As I watched this new version of the story, I didn't think I was getting as wrapped up in the story as I was, but at the pivotal moment, the waterworks sure started.""Charlotte's Web"" will keep very young children entranced. Hopefully, they will be encouraged to read the classic book by E.B. White. The parents will squirm in their seats.",3,Nice Look Is Not Matched by Voice Talent,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,4924,"['Fern', 'Arable', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'up', 'one', 'night', 'out', 'barn', 'watch', 'pig', 'take', 'care', 'new', 'babies', 'dad', 'Kevin', 'Anderson', 'up', 'runt', 'ax', 'heads', 'towards', 'door', 'Shocked', 'Fern', 'little', 'pigs', 'life', 'along', 'taking', 'everywhere', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'Mom', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'Dad', 'insist', 'Fern', 'take', 'pig', 'Uncle', 'barn', 'road', 'can', 'still', 'visit', 'everyday', 'need', 'concentrate', 'harvest', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'animals', 'anymore', 'new', 'home', 'Wilbur', 'Dominic', 'Scott', 'Kay', 'Fern', 'soon', 'other', 'animals', 'Samuel', 'sheep', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Gussy', 'Golly', 'geese', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Bitsy', 'Betsy', 'cows', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'Ike', 'horse', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'delights', 'new', 'pig', 'slop', 'providing', 'new', 'food', 'source', 'animals', 'are', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'own', 'concerns', 'Wilbur', 'lonely', 'Soon', 'spider', 'named', 'Charlotte', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Wilbur', 'who', 'soon', 'learns', 'fate', 'smokehouse', 'Christmas', 'Charlotte', 'determined', 'help', 'change', 'Wilbur', 'fate', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'based', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'E.', 'B', 'White', 'was', 'previously', 'made', 'fully', 'animated', 'film', 'new', 'version', 'animals', 'are', 'animated', 'using', 'CGI', 'live', 'Fern', 'real', 'idealized', 'world', 'look', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'project', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'good', 'choice', 'appear', 'kid', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'lot', 'depth', 'interest', 'role', 'appeared', 'Fern', 'believe', 'little', 'girl', 'quest', 'keep', 'pig', 'alive', 'believe', 'how', 'close', 'become', 'mix', 'CGI', 'animals', 'live', 'action', 'world', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'storybook', 'first', 'few', 'frames', 'show', 'credits', 'graphic', 'images', 'could', 'be', 'cutouts', 'picture', 'book', 'Slowly', 'film', 'live', 'action', 'When', 'animals', 'first', 'appear', 'begin', 'talking', 'buy', 'Wilbur', 'home', 'other', 'animals', 'get', 'picture', 'what', 'life', 'farm', 'large', 'cast', 'voice', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'naturally', 'better', 'others', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'who', 'Charlotte', 'least', 'successful', 'children', 'books', 'own', 'children', 'same', 'way', 'must', 'have', 'terrible', 'time', 'getting', 'sleep', 'lines', 'very', 'modulated', 'way', 'varying', 'delivery', 'very', 'little', 'showing', 'almost', 'emotion', 'short', 'boring', 'When', 'name', 'actor', 'Roberts', 'role', 'should', 'try', 'make', 'interesting', 'fun', 'Instead', 'Roberts', 'be', 'merely', 'reading', 'lines', 'talents', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'doing', 'said', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'narration', 'soft', 'folksy', 'voice', 'proves', 'be', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'story.The', 'most', 'successful', 'voice', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'furthest', 'towards', 'establishing', 'real', 'character', 'Templeton', 'rat', 'out', 'first', 'foremost', 'Buscemi', 'across', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'also', 'believable', 'when', 'become', 'part', 'Wilbur', 'defacto', 'posse', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'play', 'pair', 'crows', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'fear', 'guy', 'who', 'cornfield', 'scarecrow', 'add', 'nice', 'jolt', 'comic', 'relief', 'time', 'pop', 'up', 'John', 'Cleese', 'fun', 'Samuel', 'sheep', 'who', 'constantly', 'other', 'sheep', 'following', 'along', 'lock', 'step', 'thought', 'own', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'play', 'pair', 'geese', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'play', 'pair', 'cows', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'Bates', 'mimic', 'McEntire', 'speech', 'pattern', 'guess', 'cows', 'have', 'have', 'unified', 'country', 'accent', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'cantankerous', 'horse', 'Ike', 'better', 'job', 'might', 'think', 'expect', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'books', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'approach', 'classic', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'approach', 'tone', 'book', 'more', 'closely', 'fully', 'animated', 'version', 'combination', 'Fanning', 'realistic', 'animated', 'animals', 'picture', 'book', 'settings', 'work', 'film', 'favor', 'only', 'name', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'consistent', 'better', 'work', 'bringing', 'animals', 'life.As', 'watched', 'new', 'version', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'getting', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', 'was', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'waterworks', 'sure', 'started', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'will', 'keep', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'entranced', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'encouraged', 'read', 'classic', 'book', 'E.B', 'White', 'parents', 'will', 'squirm', 'seats']",N/A

1055725,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NA6CP4,Tsuyoshi,"[24, 29]","First I must confess that I have never read the original book `Charlotte's Web' by E. B. White or seen the 1973 animated film version (with Debbie Reynolds' voice). So please read my review of this new live-action version as such, though probably this kind of confession is really unnecessary.Wilbur is a `spring pig' who is destined never to see the winter. Charlotte, a spider living in Wilbur's pen, hatches a plan with Wilbur to change his fate. The story is deceptively simple, but there are messages behind it, which is not hard even for the kids to find as the story unfolds. Even for the adults the film's last 20 minutes is quite moving.Dakota Fanning plays a girl Fern, who saves the life of Wilbur in the earlier part of the film. One thing I like about the film's script (by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick) is that there is another coming-of-age story about this girl, who is about to grow up and leave her childhood behind. At first Fern and Wilbur look like inseparable friends. Fern tries to bring the pig to the school, hiding him in the desk. However, by the end of the film you will be seeing another Fern, more grown-up, less childlike. No one can remain a child forever, and Fern, or perhaps Dakota Fanning herself, embodies this poignant fact.Charlotte's voice is provided by Julia Roberts. It may be slightly weird to imagine a spider speaking with Julia's voice, but it works with her voice expressing the motherly wisdom and concerns convincingly. Impressive cast is gathered for the voices of the animals in the barnyard, and Steve Buscemi as Templeton the Rat and John Cleese as Samuel the Sheep are standout.These animals are all perfectly created with impeccable special effects, but you may feel some part of the film detract from their effects on us. I am not sure the film really needs two meddling crows or fart jokes, and if the film company thinks that their film needs them to keep the kids interested, they are utterly mistaken. They have a charming story of Wilbur and Charlotte, and they should be much more confident, especially when they have this cast and Danny Elfman's wonderful score.If I may borrow Charlotte's word, `Charlotte's Web' is truly `some' film, and its radiant charms are more than this single word can convey.",5,Some Pig Indeed: Moving Story of Charlotte and Wilbur,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,2273,"['First', 'must', 'confess', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'E.', 'B', 'White', 'seen', '1973', 'animated', 'film', 'version', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'voice', 'please', 'read', 'review', 'new', 'live-action', 'version', 'such', 'though', 'probably', 'kind', 'confession', 'really', 'unnecessary.Wilbur', 'spring', 'pig', 'who', 'destined', 'never', 'see', 'winter', 'Charlotte', 'spider', 'living', 'Wilbur', 'pen', 'plan', 'Wilbur', 'change', 'fate', 'story', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'are', 'messages', 'not', 'hard', 'even', 'kids', 'find', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Even', 'adults', 'film', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'quite', 'moving.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'girl', 'Fern', 'who', 'life', 'Wilbur', 'earlier', 'part', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'script', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'Karey', 'Kirkpatrick', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'leave', 'childhood', 'behind', 'first', 'Fern', 'Wilbur', 'look', 'inseparable', 'friends', 'Fern', 'tries', 'bring', 'pig', 'school', 'hiding', 'desk', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'Fern', 'more', 'grown-up', 'less', 'childlike', 'one', 'can', 'remain', 'child', 'forever', 'Fern', 'perhaps', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'poignant', 'fact.Charlotte', 'voice', 'provided', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'weird', 'imagine', 'spider', 'speaking', 'Julia', 'voice', 'voice', 'expressing', 'motherly', 'wisdom', 'concerns', 'convincingly', 'Impressive', 'cast', 'gathered', 'voices', 'animals', 'barnyard', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Templeton', 'Rat', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Samuel', 'Sheep', 'are', 'standout.These', 'animals', 'are', 'perfectly', 'created', 'impeccable', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'feel', 'part', 'film', 'detract', 'effects', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'meddling', 'crows', 'fart', 'jokes', 'film', 'company', 'film', 'keep', 'kids', 'interested', 'are', 'utterly', 'mistaken', 'have', 'charming', 'story', 'Wilbur', 'Charlotte', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'confident', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'cast', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'wonderful', 'score.If', 'may', 'borrow', 'Charlotte', 'word', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'truly', 'film', 'radiant', 'charms', 'are', 'more', 'single', 'word', 'can', 'convey']",N/A

1055729,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000NA6CP4,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[7, 9]","The cinematography and CGI in Charlotte's Web is spot on. Somehow the filmmakers managed to maintain a dramatic, realistic look and feel, while still maintaining a childlike wonder of life on the farm. All the animals look completely realistic, even when they're talking, which is an accomplishment.The biggest drawback is that when they're talking, they're not always interesting. This similar problem has arisen in many animated films lately, and shows itself here as well: studios think that casting a name actor is the same as casting a character voice actor. It just doesn't always work. The name actors just sound like themselves, and don't put anything into their characters. The excepttion in this film is Steve Buscemi, who manages to create an enjoyable Templeton with an interesting voice. Robert Redford as a horse shines a little bit on occasion as does John Cleese as a sheep. The rest of the talent is borderline lifeless. Cedric the Entertainer and Oprah Winfrey as geese are forgettable, as are Reba McEntire and Kathy Bates as cows and Thomas Haden Church and Andre3000 as crows. The ultimate disappointment in the voice talent is Julia Roberts as Charlotte. She hardly puts any life into her voice, much less any characterization. While the other voice actors were merely forgettable, Roberts is a detriment to the film. Hopefully filmmakers will learn that name actors are not necessarily voice actors as well. They use their body to act, while cartoon actors just use their voice. It's a completely different talent.The film itself is entertaining and sweet; almost too sweet. The amount of mood music that plays to inspire you to start tearing up gets a little out of hand, but that's to be expected from such a family friendly film based on a classic book.Overall, this film is very pleasant relaxing experience, and if you have kids it's definitely worth checking out. If you're not planning to watch this in a family setting, do yourself a favor and check out something else, because this isn't for you.The DVD extras include a featurette with each of the talent talking about their characters.",3,Poor voice talent hinders an otherwise solid family film,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,2119,"['cinematography', 'CGI', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'spot', 'Somehow', 'filmmakers', 'managed', 'maintain', 'dramatic', 'realistic', 'look', 'feel', 'still', 'maintaining', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'life', 'farm', 'animals', 'look', 'completely', 'realistic', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'accomplishment.The', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', ""'re"", 'not', 'always', 'interesting', 'similar', 'problem', 'arisen', 'many', 'animated', 'films', 'lately', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'studios', 'think', 'casting', 'name', 'actor', 'same', 'casting', 'character', 'voice', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'name', 'actors', 'just', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'anything', 'characters', 'excepttion', 'film', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'create', 'enjoyable', 'Templeton', 'interesting', 'voice', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'horse', 'little', 'bit', 'occasion', 'John', 'Cleese', 'sheep', 'rest', 'talent', 'borderline', 'lifeless', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'geese', 'are', 'forgettable', 'are', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'cows', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Andre3000', 'crows', 'ultimate', 'disappointment', 'voice', 'talent', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Charlotte', 'hardly', 'life', 'voice', 'much', 'less', 'characterization', 'other', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'merely', 'forgettable', 'Roberts', 'detriment', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'learn', 'name', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'voice', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'body', 'act', 'cartoon', 'actors', 'just', 'use', 'voice', 'completely', 'different', 'talent.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'sweet', 'almost', 'too', 'sweet', 'amount', 'mood', 'music', 'inspire', 'start', 'tearing', 'up', 'little', 'hand', 'be', 'expected', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'based', 'classic', 'book.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'pleasant', 'relaxing', 'experience', 'have', 'kids', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'not', 'planning', 'watch', 'family', 'setting', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'something', 'else', ""n't"", 'you.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'featurette', 'talent', 'talking', 'characters']",N/A
