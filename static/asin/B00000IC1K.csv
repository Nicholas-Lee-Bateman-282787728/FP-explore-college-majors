It looks like a show for little girls, but some of the cursing means I wouldn't let an 8 year old watch it.  There is a lot of depth in this series, especially in later discs.  I was actually quite impressed with the subjects the series raised and how the series dealt with these issues.  Also, its very funny and the pacing is excellent.  I never felt like I was slogging through any sections, even though Akari can get a little annoying in these early episodes.This series is so underrated and definitely a steal for the DVD price.",5,Surprisingly Good,1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,578,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'series', 'show', 'little', 'girls', 'cursing', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', '8', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'lot', 'depth', 'series', 'especially', 'later', 'discs', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressed', 'subjects', 'series', 'raised', 'how', 'series', 'dealt', 'issues', 'Also', 'very', 'funny', 'pacing', 'excellent', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'slogging', 'sections', 'even', 'Akari', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'annoying', 'early', 'episodes.This', 'series', 'so', 'underrated', 'definitely', 'steal', 'DVD', 'price']","Battle Athletes Victory, Vol. 1: Training"

I've heard bits and pieces about it from various sources but I didn't have a clear picture of what it would be like. I'm happy to say this is one of the most entertaining series I've had the pleasure to watch in a while. It has a good mix of action and comedy which had me chuckling out loud quite often. The only thing I didn't like was the opening song which was too cheesy for me, but after that it was all great. The animation is decent and the background music for the action scenes were good enough. It's only the beginning but I'm definitely looking forward to what will happen next!",4,Very Entertaining!,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,656,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'title', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'bits', 'pieces', 'various', 'sources', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'picture', 'what', 'would', 'be', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'series', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'while', 'good', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'had', 'chuckling', 'out', 'loud', 'quite', 'often', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'opening', 'song', 'was', 'too', 'cheesy', 'was', 'great', 'animation', 'decent', 'background', 'music', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'only', 'beginning', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'looking', 'forward', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next']","Battle Athletes Victory, Vol. 1: Training"

Now I read something  that says that there is no romance, boy were they wrong.  While nothing  happens some girls get hit on by other girls.  Also the language is  actually worse in the dub than the sub!  Usually it is the other way  around, but this time the girls are swearing in english!The show is  cute, but alot of things hold it back from being a child or pre-teen safe  show.  I mean there are some great things on friendship, but they can get  over looked because some character starts yelling &quot;S#!T&quot;.

This series concentrates on the virtue of the fun of competition and not on just winning all the time.  This theme plays out time and again in this series where all competitors who try to win at any cost and by any means are defeated.  At first glance this may seem like a sports anime, but it actually is more about having fun and enjoying friendship.",5,This is the funniest anime.

502771,AKFVX5CFY5E4J,B00000IC1K,"""nogana_naishi""","[4, 4]","I picked up this DVD on a whim, remembering seeing an episode several years. And even though it didn't catch my attention when I first saw it, I decided I might as well watch the first volume. What I found was one of the most original and well-made anime series I had ever watched.Set around three thousand years in the future, Battle Athletes Victory follows several athletes from earth training to become the coveted Cosmo Beauty, the greatest athlete in the universe. Quite a silly premise at first glance, but when you look deeper you will find much, much more: Excellent character development, a smile on your face (or a tear in your eye) at the end of each episode, and a strong plot of friendship and the will to succeed.The main focus of Battle Athletes Victory is 15-year-old Akari Kanzaki, the daughter of the most famous Cosmo Beauty ever to hold the title, the late Tomoe Midoh. Akari longs to hold the same title her mother did, but unfortunately it doesn't look as if she inherited the skill from her. She's dead last in all the events, which causes her to be depressed whenever she's not competing, hiding in a cardboard box she marked &quot;Akari House&quot;. Other main characters include Akari's best friend, Ichino; Tanya, a young girl from Africa who just wants to have a good time; Jessie Gurtland, a determined blond American who wants to follow in Tomoe Midoh's footsteps herself, and thinks that Akari doesn't deserve to; The tomboyish Russian, Ayla Veferascca who is in direct competition with Jessie; and Wong Ling-Pha, the crazy Chinese girl just thrown in for comic relief.The first volume focuses more on introducing the secondary characters and developing their personalities rather than Akari's, which is a nice change in pace from most anime series where secondary characters are all but ignored. During all this, Akari pretty much stays depressed, which while keeps her quite one-dimensional for now, allows for some great interaction between her and other characters.Once I bought this first DVD, I couldn't wait for the other volumes to arrive, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way about it if you just give it a chance.",4,"The start of a great, yet underrated show",993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,2156,"['picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'whim', 'remembering', 'seeing', 'episode', 'several', 'years', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'attention', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'decided', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'first', 'volume', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'well-made', 'anime', 'series', 'had', 'ever', 'watched.Set', 'around', 'three', 'thousand', 'years', 'future', 'Battle', 'Athletes', 'Victory', 'several', 'athletes', 'earth', 'training', 'become', 'coveted', 'Cosmo', 'Beauty', 'greatest', 'athlete', 'universe', 'silly', 'premise', 'first', 'glance', 'when', 'look', 'deeper', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'Excellent', 'character', 'development', 'smile', 'face', 'tear', 'eye', 'end', 'episode', 'strong', 'plot', 'friendship', 'will', 'succeed.The', 'main', 'focus', 'Battle', 'Athletes', 'Victory', '15-year-old', 'Akari', 'Kanzaki', 'daughter', 'most', 'famous', 'Cosmo', 'Beauty', 'ever', 'hold', 'title', 'late', 'Tomoe', 'Midoh', 'Akari', 'hold', 'same', 'title', 'mother', 'did', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'look', 'inherited', 'skill', 'dead', 'last', 'events', 'be', 'depressed', 'whenever', 'not', 'competing', 'hiding', 'cardboard', 'box', 'marked', 'quot', 'Akari', 'House', 'quot', 'Other', 'main', 'characters', 'include', 'Akari', 'best', 'friend', 'Ichino', 'Tanya', 'young', 'girl', 'Africa', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Jessie', 'Gurtland', 'determined', 'blond', 'American', 'who', 'follow', 'Tomoe', 'Midoh', 'footsteps', 'Akari', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'tomboyish', 'Russian', 'Ayla', 'Veferascca', 'who', 'direct', 'competition', 'Jessie', 'Wong', 'Ling-Pha', 'crazy', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'just', 'thrown', 'comic', 'relief.The', 'first', 'volume', 'more', 'introducing', 'secondary', 'characters', 'developing', 'personalities', 'rather', 'Akari', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'most', 'anime', 'series', 'where', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'ignored', 'Akari', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'depressed', 'quite', 'one-dimensional', 'now', 'great', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters.Once', 'bought', 'first', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'other', 'volumes', 'arrive', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'just', 'give', 'chance']","Battle Athletes Victory, Vol. 1: Training"
