But for myself, I find that no matter what I see him in, from Shaun of the Dead to Love Actually, to Arthur Christmas, to this unknown production (to me until today), he never fails to delight me. I think that this plot, unlike some other BBC productions, such as Spies of Warsaw starring my personal favorite Doctor, did not bore me to 4x fast forward, but rather took me by surprise with the fact that it enthralled me from the jazz credits introduction to its conclusion. I didn't find it dragging or convoluted; rather, I enjoyed the fact that the interpersonal dynamics did not culminate in some morbid romance of the body but of the soul. I only just viewed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel this afternoon on DVR that left me bleary-eyed with the promise of life after life, but that Nighy can deliver the quintessential British stoicism that tramples the emotion of a father/friend/husband/suitor/spy with such aplomb is simply divine.

The point of view underlying the drama is that the UK Prime Minister is too close to the USA (e.g., Tony Blair).  I personally am not put off by that view which is often expressed in UK Drama (e.g., The Last Enemy), but you should be aware of the underpinnings of the video before you watch it.The drama is riveting, and the cast is excellent.  I am not a big Bill Nighy fan, but everyone else is excellent.  I started watching the video at 1AM, and I could not stop watching it.  I found the ending realistic and believable, despite the fact that I wished for something more satisfying from our hero's point of view.  The dialogue is great.  It is witty, and it is what an American Anglophile expects the British ruling class to sound like.There is a rumor that writer/director David Hare has told some associates that if Page 8 works, he might bring Bill Nighy's character Johnny Worricker back, as part of a trilogy of TV films.  I would love to see more (even with Bill Nighy).PBS Masterpiece will air the drama next week, and has allowed two hours for the broadcast.  The drama itself is only one hour and thirty-eight minutes.  So, I am hopeful that PBS will broadcast the entire drama.The only thing wrong with the DVD is the price of $23.49.

In ""Page Eight"" he plays a jaded MI5 Officer, who is caught up in secret political skulduggery that could bring down the government, headed by Ralph Fiennes as the Prime Minister, who, a la Tony Blair, has been too pal-sy with his American Cousins in the 'war' on terror. Coincidentally, Nighy also becomes involved in a political coverup of a war-crime, which has hit the Syrian family of his beautiful neighbour, convincingly portrayed by Rachel Weisz.The cast, which is top drawer, includes Michael Gambon, who used to be Nighy's tutor at Cambridge and subsequently became his boss at MI5; Judy Davis, a rather nasty piece of goods who is his colleague and nemisis at MI5; and a still lovely and charismatic Marthe Keller, cast in the role of an old love of Nighy and possibly a professional contact, who is a source of ready cash.Although I was totally absorbed in the story, which moves at a fast pace, the plot contained some gaps, which makes me wonder whether we on this side of the Pond have been treated to yet another truncated version to fit into the Masterpiece time slot. Furthermore, there were maddening lapses in continuity. For instance, Nighy sensibly locks a plastic shopping bag containing 60,000 (the bills with Queen Elizabeth's face plainly showing through the plastic), and then in the next scene, he pulls his car up to the shoulder of the road in the middle of nowhere, opens up the trunk of the car--leaving it wide open--retrieves a tuxedo, and walks off toward the bushes--minus the sack of money--apparently to change his clothes, because in the very next scene, it is night and he turns up at his old college dressed for a dinner in honour of the Prime Minister. In still another scene, we discover Nighy standing at a hotel reception desk; he is deep in conversation with Ms Weisz, and the plastic sack of money is sitting open on the counter (the Queen's face still visible through the plastic), unattended. By the time he reaches the airport in the final scene, plastic sack of money in hand, I kept wondering how he was going to get it through security (which is fierce at English airports!). The point is that the director seems to have forgotten that the plastic sack contained a fortune in pound notes; nor did it occur to him that, as far as the collective memory of the audience is concerned, the prop might consequently become a maddening distraction from the plot.The stellar cast kept the film on track, but I do think that a strong dose of continuity control ought to have been exercised in the editing of this otherwise riveting film.",4,Bill Nighy: The King of Laid Back,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,2696,"['love', 'anything', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'cast', 'Suave', 'sophisticated', 'master', 'pithy', 'understatement', 'Page', 'Eight', 'jaded', 'MI5', 'Officer', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'secret', 'political', 'skulduggery', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'government', 'headed', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'who', 'la', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'been', 'too', 'pal-sy', 'American', 'Cousins', ""'war"", 'terror', 'Coincidentally', 'Nighy', 'also', 'involved', 'political', 'coverup', 'war-crime', 'hit', 'Syrian', 'family', 'beautiful', 'neighbour', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Rachel', 'Weisz.The', 'cast', 'top', 'drawer', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Nighy', 'tutor', 'Cambridge', 'subsequently', 'became', 'boss', 'MI5', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'rather', 'nasty', 'piece', 'goods', 'who', 'colleague', 'nemisis', 'MI5', 'still', 'lovely', 'charismatic', 'Marthe', 'Keller', 'cast', 'role', 'old', 'love', 'Nighy', 'possibly', 'professional', 'contact', 'who', 'source', 'ready', 'cash.Although', 'was', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'story', 'fast', 'pace', 'plot', 'contained', 'gaps', 'wonder', 'side', 'Pond', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'yet', 'truncated', 'version', 'fit', 'Masterpiece', 'time', 'slot', 'Furthermore', 'were', 'maddening', 'lapses', 'continuity', 'instance', 'Nighy', 'sensibly', 'plastic', 'shopping', 'bag', 'containing', '60,000', 'bills', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'face', 'plainly', 'showing', 'plastic', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'car', 'up', 'shoulder', 'road', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'up', 'trunk', 'car', 'leaving', 'wide', 'open', 'tuxedo', 'walks', 'off', 'bushes', 'sack', 'money', 'apparently', 'change', 'clothes', 'very', 'next', 'scene', 'night', 'up', 'old', 'college', 'dressed', 'dinner', 'honour', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'still', 'scene', 'discover', 'Nighy', 'standing', 'hotel', 'reception', 'desk', 'deep', 'conversation', 'Ms', 'Weisz', 'plastic', 'sack', 'money', 'sitting', 'open', 'counter', 'Queen', 'face', 'still', 'visible', 'plastic', 'unattended', 'time', 'airport', 'final', 'scene', 'plastic', 'sack', 'money', 'hand', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'security', 'fierce', 'English', 'airports', 'point', 'director', 'have', 'forgotten', 'plastic', 'sack', 'contained', 'fortune', 'pound', 'notes', 'did', 'occur', 'that', 'as', 'far', 'collective', 'memory', 'audience', 'concerned', 'prop', 'might', 'consequently', 'become', 'maddening', 'distraction', 'plot.The', 'stellar', 'cast', 'kept', 'film', 'track', 'do', 'think', 'strong', 'dose', 'continuity', 'control', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'exercised', 'editing', 'otherwise', 'riveting', 'film']",Masterpiece Contemporary: Page Eight

1455620,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005DJ7AYC,Grady Harp,"[53, 60]","David Hare both wrote and directed this stylish, intensely intelligent suspense film (his other films include work on The Hours, The Reader, Damage, Plenty, etc).  Few films have been made that depend on smart dialogue and intense acting instead of explosions, car chases, and other improbable acts of danger to make their point.  Aided by a top-notch British cast, Hare has created a thinking person's drama and it is refreshingly poignant.A contemporary spy film created for BBC, the action is set in both London and Cambridge.  Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy in one of his best roles to date) is an experienced MI5 officer whose boss and best friend Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon) dies of a myocardial infarction: he leaves a secret file for his friend. Both men have been married to the same woman (Alice Krige) and Worricker has a grown child from his marriage, an artist Julianne  Felicity Jones) who has never quite forgiven her father for leaving her mother for another woman. The file is so important that it is under surveillance by the British Intelligence (Judy Davis et al) and the Prime Minister's office (Ralph Fiennes).  Worricker lives in a flat opposite a beautiful but aloof girl Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz) whose brother has been murdered in the Middle East.  It is the silence about Nancy's brother's death that is at the core of the file Worricker holds and with some help from Nancy he traces the truth to the point of being threatened by MI5 to be fired.  The film addresses contemporary intelligence issues and techniques and the associated moral dilemmas we face today.  To reveal more would be to rob the viewer of the complexity of the story.The strong supporting cast includes Marthe Kellar in a small but pivotal role, along with Tom Hughes, Kate Burdette, Ewen Bremmer and others.  This is a tense drama, exceptionally well written and acted and a welcome change from the current barrage of action flicks.

It has the adult writing and nuance one expects from the best of British-made television that finds it way to America.  I'm a great fan of Bill Nighy, here playing Johnny Worricker, an intelligence analyst trying to get to the bottom of two issues: whether and why the truth about his lovely neighbor's brother's death in the Middle East has been suppressed, and how to cope with a report he sees that exposes Downing Street's knowledge about something that it would rush to deny knowing.The cast is, naturally, terrific: Rachel Weisz plays Nancy, Worricker's grieving neighbor, who may or may not have taken the flat opposite his deliberately; Michael Gambon plays Baron, Worricker's boss, who knows he has a dicey heart and therefore ensures that Worricker is aware of the report; Felicity Jones plays Julia, Worricker's estranged daughter; Alice Krieg plays her mother, Worricker's former wife, now married to Baron; and Ralph Fiennes plays the Prime Minister whose butt will be on the hot seat if the report gets out.  Judy Davis does a wonderfully nasty turn as the bitchy, conniving head of Worricker's intelligence unit.But it is Bill Nighy's performance that anchors ""Page Eight"" - he blends sardonic cynicism with a still-beating conscience perfectly.  His versatility never ceases to amaze me: not everyone can go from Victor the Vampire in ""Underworld"" to Johnny Worricker in ""Page Eight""!  Nighy is a true professional who knows his craft - you can also see him teamed with Weisz and Fiennes in the excellent, if disturbing film, ""The Constant Gardener"".I have watched ""Page Eight"" three times, and each time noticed something that I missed on the previous viewing.  Some viewers may be uncomfortable with or sensitive to a one-sided political view that the plot involves (which I believe is derived from an actual event a few years ago in the Middle East) and I found myself questioning it, but the quality here is undeniable, and one can't deny quality due to political sensitivities.This is a stayer - you will return to it.

His daughter is also is pregnant, but no boyfriend or husband in site, but Worricker's ex-wife chastises HIM for being judgemental, saying ""It's the twenty-first century.""  Quite sensibly he explodes at such stupidity essentially saying that the current date in no way justifies the moral decay that rots at the heart of Britain.Also, apparently in the writers minds, the most horrible countries on the world stage are the US and Israel.

The GOOD and why THREE STARS.Basically, it is a movie based on &#34;smart&#34; word play. I know it is British, but at the one hour point I stopped. The film &#34;Wild Target&#34; with Bill is still the best film to watch him excel!! Its has the &#34;smart&#34; word play, is fun, has a plot that moves faster than a snail too.This movie's plot line is slow - really, really slow to develop. My deep problems are with the plot line and Nighy's numerous relationships with women (his neighbor, his daughter, his lover, his ex-wife, etc.). The plot line has too many illogical holes (and the film resembles closely one other Nighy movie on world hunger) in its politically illogical allusions (I am trying not to put spoilers in my review). Bill's character is sold as a moral man within a corrupt political framework (pretty standard idea but is actually sophistry in this movie's dialog). Then there are the &#34;straw men&#34; to hate and also created as hollow characters. The character development of the British Prime Minister (Fiennes) is missing as is the character development of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are for target practice only, not to be really known. The disingenuous plotting had me wondering why I kept watching for a full hour but then I realized it was Nighy, his work was beyond belief.Nighy's relationships with the women around him played as disjointed puzzle pieces forced together but not fitting. The movie in fact reminds me of a long running British play - No Sex Please, We Are British! He shows no emotion invariably.

1455660,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B005DJ7AYC,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 1]","Acclaimed British actor Nighy stars as an M16 agent, Worricker, years of service under his belt in the pursuit of facts for the British government.  Looking past or at least very near retirement, his worn, thin and wrinkled face, on a tall willowy body, Worricker finds himself in a moral dilemma about how much his government knew about the torture sites for interrogation of British (muslim) subjects.  All of this has been covered up, in collusion with the USA and Israel, but he finds out that Prime Minister did know.  Ralph Fiennes plays the then-Tony Blair, and the entire story is to indict the Blair government for siding with Israel and not the other Middle East states, to stay on the good side of the White House.Well, what is new?  USA and UK have been together through thick and thin; we came to their aid with Lend-Lease under FDR and found ourselves fighting Germany, when most Americans were against involvement in any more European wars.In any case, the film is entertaining in a slow-moving spy-story way.  Aside from our very dessicated main hero Worricker, we have his rebellious, angry, despairing daughter who appears to be a successful artiste at a young age.  She is angry at her father, since her mother was abandoned by him when she was pregnant.  She, too, is now pregnant and abandoned.  This brings the ex-wife into the story since something must be done about his lone offspring's waywardness and careless mistake.Meanwhile, in his fancy flat, he discovers a beautiful neighbor across the landing, a Syrian woman asking for help with a difficult boyfriend.  Naturally she is not there by coincidence.  Her brother had been killed by Israelis while waving a white flag, and she knew that he worked in secret services.  Her goal is to seduce him and get him to help in the fight to get justice against Israel.Does she find his reticence and advanced age repulsive?  If so, she smiles and hides it, and he in his loneliness is falling for it.  Her father is an important man; Worricker is getting set up.While Worricker walks around in his aging swaying thinness in a long dark coat through the streets of London, we are presumably to admire his toughness, his grim clenched mouth and worn, weary features, as he resolves to fight against his own government.  Having no attachments, he knows his career will end (possibly high time?), but he can sell some paintings and escape abroad, cash in hand.I would recommend this film for those who like:1.  To fantasize being an old guy still attracting women 40 years younger or more, with little more than a grimace-smile;2.  Those who like anti-Israeli and anti-American propaganda;3.  To fantasize being the female who can manipulate with her beauty the heartstrings of a callous old spy who lives alone, presumably by choice, since all the women seem to fall for him.  His middle-aged lover doesn't interest him much.4.  To consider how the computers of today find out and ferret out everything, as we now know with NSA's exposure by Snowden.5.  How absolutely hopeless the &#34;war on terrorism&#34; really is, since the governments are all involved with it, too.Above all, I see this as a film for male viewers who are getting on in years and wistfully hope for a little bit of young flesh, or even some recognition like a smile.Fine acting. Even the females, typecast, do a good job, although their motivations are not clear in the plot.  (I.e. why is the daughter so angry and despairing, careless of birthcontrol and not considering abortion?  Why is the young Syrian across the hall interested in this ancient fellow aside from what he can do for her family?  What is attracting her?)",4,Perfect fantasy life of an aging spy,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,3665,"['Acclaimed', 'British', 'actor', 'Nighy', 'M16', 'agent', 'Worricker', 'years', 'service', 'belt', 'pursuit', 'facts', 'British', 'government', 'Looking', 'past', 'least', 'very', 'near', 'retirement', 'worn', 'thin', 'wrinkled', 'face', 'tall', 'willowy', 'body', 'Worricker', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'how', 'much', 'government', 'knew', 'torture', 'interrogation', 'British', 'muslim', 'subjects', 'been', 'covered', 'up', 'collusion', 'USA', 'Israel', 'out', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'did', 'know', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'then-Tony', 'Blair', 'entire', 'story', 'indict', 'Blair', 'government', 'siding', 'Israel', 'not', 'other', 'Middle', 'East', 'states', 'stay', 'good', 'side', 'White', 'House.Well', 'what', 'new', 'USA', 'UK', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'thick', 'thin', 'came', 'aid', 'Lend-Lease', 'FDR', 'found', 'fighting', 'Germany', 'when', 'most', 'Americans', 'were', 'involvement', 'more', 'European', 'wars.In', 'case', 'film', 'entertaining', 'slow-moving', 'spy-story', 'way', 'Aside', 'very', 'dessicated', 'main', 'hero', 'Worricker', 'have', 'rebellious', 'angry', 'despairing', 'daughter', 'who', 'be', 'successful', 'artiste', 'young', 'age', 'angry', 'father', 'mother', 'was', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'too', 'now', 'pregnant', 'abandoned', 'ex-wife', 'story', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'lone', 'offspring', 'waywardness', 'careless', 'mistake.Meanwhile', 'fancy', 'flat', 'beautiful', 'neighbor', 'landing', 'Syrian', 'woman', 'asking', 'help', 'difficult', 'boyfriend', 'Naturally', 'not', 'there', 'coincidence', 'brother', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Israelis', 'waving', 'white', 'flag', 'knew', 'worked', 'secret', 'services', 'goal', 'seduce', 'get', 'help', 'fight', 'get', 'justice', 'Israel.Does', 'find', 'reticence', 'advanced', 'age', 'repulsive', 'so', 'loneliness', 'falling', 'father', 'important', 'man', 'Worricker', 'getting', 'set', 'up.While', 'Worricker', 'walks', 'aging', 'swaying', 'thinness', 'long', 'dark', 'coat', 'streets', 'London', 'are', 'presumably', 'admire', 'toughness', 'grim', 'clenched', 'mouth', 'worn', 'weary', 'features', 'fight', 'own', 'government', 'Having', 'attachments', 'career', 'will', 'end', 'possibly', 'high', 'time', 'can', 'sell', 'paintings', 'escape', 'abroad', 'cash', 'hand.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'like:1', 'fantasize', 'being', 'old', 'guy', 'still', 'attracting', 'women', '40', 'years', 'younger', 'more', 'little', 'more', 'grimace-smile', '2', 'who', 'anti-Israeli', 'anti-American', 'propaganda', '3', 'fantasize', 'being', 'female', 'who', 'can', 'manipulate', 'beauty', 'heartstrings', 'callous', 'old', 'spy', 'who', 'alone', 'presumably', 'choice', 'women', 'seem', 'fall', 'middle-aged', 'lover', ""n't"", 'interest', 'much.4', 'consider', 'how', 'computers', 'today', 'find', 'out', 'ferret', 'out', 'everything', 'now', 'know', 'NSA', 'exposure', 'Snowden.5', 'How', 'absolutely', 'hopeless', '34', 'war', 'terrorism', '34', 'really', 'governments', 'are', 'involved', 'too.Above', 'see', 'film', 'male', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'years', 'wistfully', 'hope', 'little', 'bit', 'young', 'flesh', 'even', 'recognition', 'smile.Fine', 'acting', 'Even', 'females', 'typecast', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'plot', 'I.e', 'why', 'daughter', 'so', 'angry', 'despairing', 'careless', 'birthcontrol', 'not', 'considering', 'abortion', 'Why', 'young', 'Syrian', 'hall', 'interested', 'ancient', 'fellow', 'aside', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'family', 'What', 'attracting']",Masterpiece Contemporary: Page Eight

1455663,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B005DJ7AYC,mirasreviews,"[6, 11]","""Page Eight"" is a political thriller written and directed by David Hare for British television. Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a high-ranking MI5 agent, a direct subordinate to his oldest friend Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon), MI5's Director General. Benedict drops a bombshell Top Secret file on Johnny and his colleague Jill Tankard (Judy Davis) regarding American Black Site prisons and torture of terror suspects. On page eight, a source says that Downing Street already has the information, implying not only that the Prime Minister knew about human rights violations but that he may have withheld vital security information from MI5. Benedict makes sure the key interested parties know what's in the file and waits to see the fallout. Then he dies, leaving Johnny holding the evidence that could bring down the PM's government.Johnny is faced with a dilemma: Carry out Benedict's plan to hold someone accountable and lose his job and perhaps his freedom. Or trade the information in the report for some concessions from the PM on other issues. This while Johnny is navigating a strained relationship with his grown daughter (Felicity Jones) and getting to know his neighbor Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz), a book editor whose brother was killed by Israeli forces while he was protesting the destruction of Palestinian homes on the West Bank. David Hare uses the story to draw attention to some current political issues. In fact, that seems to be its primary purpose. And that is probably why it is poorly written. Hare has created characters and a thin plot as an excuse to mention Black Site prisons and Israeli law-breaking. Both issues are stuck out there with no context or nuance, as if on display.In a strong cast, Judy Davis is the stand-out as Johnny's ambitious, two-faced nemesis. But I didn't feel any real emotion from Johnny or from the potential impact of his quandary. The story is lazily crafted and doesn't make much sense. Why would someone wanting to spy on Johnny insinuate himself with a neighbor whom Johnny has never met? Why would a high-ranking intelligence officer hire a family member to do illicit surveillance, who could easily be traced back to her? Why would Johnny carry 60,000 around for days in a plastic grocery bag that everyone can see through? And would MI5 really employ a man who has been married 5 times and has a string of mistresses, including married women, in a top security position? I realize that British security services have, indeed, made this kind of mistake in the past, but Johnny is very blackmailable.""Page Eight"" has just the right tone and pacing for a cerebral thriller -which makes me wish it were one. David Hare is a better director than a writer. Or perhaps he just had a good editor. I like the cast -except for Ralph Fiennes, who is thoroughly unconvincing as the Prime Minister. I usually like Fiennes, but I get the impression he rolled out of bed, briefly, to do one scene and was never fully engaged. The plot barely exists, and the film's raison d'tre, its politics, doesn't say anything. Two issues are waved in front of the audience basically without comment. I suppose they are supposed to invoke whatever the audience has already absorbed from the daily news, but that doesn't say much for the film.

The people who work in this division, also openly work in the larger secret service group, but no one knows. These secrets are how our countries work, secret agents, secret groups, secret meetings, and it is no wonder that untoward things occur, and no one stops them. That is the tomb of this film, 'Page Eight'.Bill Nighy playes Johnny Worriker a Senior spook in the MI-5. His boss and best friend, Benedict Baron, played by Michael Gambon, have the best and most interesting scenes together. This is spy country at its best. David Hare, the screenwriter, gives us the backstory in drips, and the tension and secrecy are handled slowly. It takes awhile to understand the story that is unfolding, and if you are a lover of the British spy stories, it is much easier to keep up. Someone in the US has given Benedict Baron some highly classified information that involves the Prime Minister. The PM knows and has hidden from the rest of the country that the UK and the US are involved in some nasty stuff. This is politics played the hard way, downright nasty and dirty. It is not until Bebedict Baron dies from a suggested heart attack, that Johnny Worriker realizes he is really in this all alone. He is clever enough to notice the young lady on his floor and her attractive young man and is able to put them in place. The secret Johnny carries and the information he has yet to gain, keep this film flowing. The introduction of Ralph Fiennes as the Prime Minister, and Saqskia Reeves as the dard boiled Home Secretary add the grace that is needed. Johnny finds himself in a tough spot, and we wonder can he dig himself out?The film gives us a sense of how the MI-5 and the CIA has worked over the last years. The terrorists threats after 9-11 have added a sense of foreboding and dirty tricks are the name of the game. Bill Nighy gives a superb performance, he is natty and sexy and a great spy. Not quite James Bond, but that is not what we want. We want this man, Johhny Worriker, who seems to be a true patriot, a little tainted, but the best we have.Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-12-11The Girl in the CafeThe Maigret Collection",4,Politics In A Moral Vacuum,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,2251,"['world', 'head', 'Policitical', 'parties', 'have', 'own', 'secret', 'service', 'division', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'division', 'also', 'openly', 'work', 'larger', 'secret', 'service', 'group', 'one', 'secrets', 'are', 'how', 'countries', 'work', 'secret', 'agents', 'secret', 'groups', 'secret', 'meetings', 'wonder', 'untoward', 'things', 'occur', 'one', 'tomb', 'film', ""'Page"", ""Eight'.Bill"", 'Nighy', 'Johnny', 'Worriker', 'Senior', 'spook', 'MI-5', 'boss', 'best', 'friend', 'Benedict', 'Baron', 'played', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'have', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'together', 'spy', 'country', 'best', 'David', 'Hare', 'screenwriter', 'backstory', 'drips', 'tension', 'secrecy', 'are', 'handled', 'slowly', 'awhile', 'understand', 'story', 'unfolding', 'are', 'lover', 'British', 'spy', 'stories', 'much', 'easier', 'keep', 'up', 'Someone', 'US', 'given', 'Benedict', 'Baron', 'highly', 'classified', 'information', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'PM', 'knows', 'hidden', 'rest', 'country', 'UK', 'US', 'are', 'involved', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'politics', 'played', 'hard', 'way', 'downright', 'nasty', 'dirty', 'not', 'Bebedict', 'Baron', 'suggested', 'heart', 'attack', 'Johnny', 'Worriker', 'really', 'alone', 'clever', 'enough', 'notice', 'young', 'lady', 'floor', 'attractive', 'young', 'man', 'able', 'put', 'place', 'secret', 'Johnny', 'information', 'yet', 'gain', 'keep', 'film', 'flowing', 'introduction', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Saqskia', 'Reeves', 'dard', 'boiled', 'Home', 'Secretary', 'add', 'grace', 'needed', 'Johnny', 'tough', 'spot', 'wonder', 'can', 'dig', 'out', 'film', 'sense', 'how', 'MI-5', 'CIA', 'worked', 'last', 'years', 'terrorists', 'threats', '9-11', 'have', 'added', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'are', 'name', 'game', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'superb', 'performance', 'natty', 'sexy', 'great', 'spy', 'Not', 'quite', 'James', 'Bond', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'want', 'man', 'Johhny', 'Worriker', 'who', 'be', 'true', 'patriot', 'little', 'tainted', 'best', 'have.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '11-12-11The', 'Girl', 'CafeThe', 'Maigret', 'Collection']",Masterpiece Contemporary: Page Eight

I suspect it might be more interesting to British audiences who are at least more familiar with the local system of government.  Also I think it will be more interesting to aging, old-school types who fancy themselves romantically irresistable way up into their dotage.  The hero, Johnny something, played by Nighy...or perhaps I should say underplayed by Nighy, was so stiff upper-lip, that he barely moved his mouth when he spoke let alone show any emotion on his face.  Or his very strangely stiff body.  I kept thinking that this man needed a serious chiropractic adjustment or a yoga class--it seemed as if his head were welded onto his spine.  Maybe it was arthritis, I don't know, but it didn't add to the allure that this character was supposed to have for mulitple women of all ages and ethnicities.  He really could have passed for the grandfather of Rachel Weisz and it was highly unrealistic to assume that she was attracted to him.  The script was obviously written by a man who indulged in his own fantasies while writing this character.  Besides the gorgeous young Arab woman played by Weisz, a very attractive German art dealer seemed to still have the hots for him, and a nice-looking, plump secretary at the office was sleeping with him.  He was reputed to have quite a past, too....and dumped his wife while pregnant, not something that endeared him to this viewer.I should have stopped watching when Michael Gambon died.As many others have commented there are very strong political opinions expressed which may offend Americans and Israelis.  It's so one-sided and heavy-handed that one can't take this film very seriously, at least I couldn't.As a political thriller it wasn't very thrilling, as a romance it totally fizzled.

There were moments of excellence, occasions where dialogue took a witty turn, but other than that this was a very dry, slow paced movie, particularly for a spy thriller. I don't say that a movie has to be car chases and gun fights like most American spy movies (there are none of those in this film), but it should be exciting at least. This was just...not. The mystery (if one can really call it that, as there was little mysterious about it) was uninteresting and obvious; the solution was predictable and dull. And the plot was the stuff of British PC fantasy, complete with brutally victimized and utterly innocent Arabs, evil, wicked, nasty and truly evil Israelis who murder innocents holding white flags and, of course, the big, bad torture-happy Americans. There was even a lovely, smart and witty Muslim intelligence agent (complete with sparkly black hijab) featured prominently, right off the bat, to complete the inclusive imagery -- inclusive to all but those nasty-innocent-murdering-Jews, presumably. I am all for making films that are ""politically correct"" in that they avoid nasty stereotypes and hateful/hurtful images; but I am not a fan of preachy films and ""message"" movies, particularly when the ""politically correct"" aspects of a film do in fact reinforce bigotry and hate. This is such a movie, featuring the virulent strain of anti-Israel hate that has traction in certain segments of British society and media.The story itself (spoilers) involves two conspiracies: collusion between the big, bad Americans, who are whisking innocent people (who somehow still provide accurate information about terrorist activity) off all over the globe to torture them, and the Prime Minister, who is not only aware of these nefarious deeds but also does not reveal what intel is recovered for fear of having to give up the source. The other conspiracy is the murder and subsequent coverup of an anti-Israel activist (Weisz' brother) by, of course, the wicked, mean and nasty ""occupiers"" (Israel). Nighy must uncover the truth of the Prime Minister's involvement, and also find information about the murder/coverup of Weisz' brother. That sounds interesting, right? Alas, it's not. It's all done in an almost surgical manner, with no more interest or emotion than you would expect to find in the most mundane of discussions; indeed, I've seen more animation displayed over the weather or minor changes in the stock market than this film gets over matters of international misdeeds, murder and espionage.All of which is too bad, because Weisz and Nighy gave good performances; they really do their best with this, and do manage to breathe some life in here or there. By and large, though, the script is just too dead to be saved, no matter how hard they try. This is one ""thriller"" that isn't ""thrilling"" at all.

""Page Eight"" also has a sinister Tony Blair surrogate.  The similarity between the two films is so great that even most of the same locations were used - including a roadside diner (probably in Germany).  They were probably filmed by  the same people, at the same time, for the same political purposes.Despite all of these cookie-cutter similarites, ""Page Eight"" is somewhat subtler, and therefore more tolerable.  The cast is also stronger; for example, Ralph Fiennes replaces Pierce Brosnan as the evil-Blair.Besides the U.S., this British production also targets Israel; a sub-plot involves Israeli culpability for the cold-blooded murder of a Palestinian-British woman's brother.The silliest aspect of both films is the British self-portrayal of duped innocence.  Battalions of British writers have made a good living by writing espionage novels about the moral compromises inherent in intelligence work (Le Carre inevitably comes to mind).  Here, we are supposed to believe that the British are dragged into a quagmire of American brutality, torture and mayhem, only to finally realize - when it is far too late - that perhaps they should have held back.

In fact, it is just the degree of silliness and implausibility that requires so much suspension of disbelief that you can't quite pull it off.Could Israelis kill someone they didn't like, based on their being involved in an anti-Israeli political movement? Why yes. They could. Could Americans torture enemies of their civilization to gleam information? Why yes. They could. And could certain people know about it and not others? Why yes. They could. And so what?The truth is that it is not America or Israel that is out to destroy civilization although their methods to save it can be debated and often, strongly disagreed with. And yes, they may even at times be responsible for part of the problems they face. But It is clearly the fascist dictatorships of this world - whether they be in Europe, the Middle East or Asia - that are ""the enemy"".A film/series such as this always aims their light on the failings of relatively free, relatively honest political sphere of The West - magnifying it's problems while ignoring the horrendous nastiness of what goes on everywhere else around them.

This is one of those new shows. Why it didn't show up in their ""Mastery"" series is a mystery to me. Despite what a previous reviewer said there is a ""mystery"" here that is not revealed until near the end. But, I'm glad they did at least bring it to US audiences.The film - with a script by David Hare (his first in 20 years) - wonderful and the cast is superb with Michael Gambon, Rachel Weisz, Judy Davis and Bill Nighy (in the main role) as an M5 Investigator (The UK's ""intelligence unit).I won't give the plot because it would spoil it. And I'll also suggest that  you pass on the review titled ""I'd Like Some Jazz "" which really gives a lot of it away. Even the short description on the back of the DVD divulges info it's more interesting to discover as you watch the film.This 105 minute film (yes it is 105 minutes on this DVD.. someone asked) is the ""Original UK Version"" so there is the F-Word - that didn't appear when it aired on PBS.I watched this DVD knowing nothing about the film or plot and thoroughly enjoyed it.

His neighbor, Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz) suddenly takes an interest in him.

At a showing of her paintings, Ralph Wilson happens to be there too. Bill doesn't like these coincidences in his life.***Midpoint plot spoiler***  Page 8 of the document is rather boring by 2010 standards. It seems Americans have secret interrogation sites across the world where they torture prisoners  AND the Prime Minister knows about it. Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) is the Prime Minister of England. The political and legal ramifications are discussed, but there appears to be no moral outrage. More coincidental things happen in the film to make you go hmm, but it is not really a mystery as there is no puzzle, or is there?. All we have is Johnny Worricker's gut feeling something isn't right.Good acting. Interesting plot twists.
