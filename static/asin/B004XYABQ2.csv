1432932,AZI2LSICN77KW,B004XYABQ2,Bert Tram,"[1, 1]","This is a great series which highlights nearly all the American manufacturers and their muscle car models of the late 60's and early 70's accompanied by surfer style music from the same time period. An absolute must for all motor-heads and people with gasoline running through their veins. On my first review, I forgot to mention I liked this series so much, I sent DVD sets to both my brothers as holiday gifts and they loved it too!",5,Almost everything you ever wanted to know about 60's / 70's muscle cars,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,434,"['great', 'series', 'highlights', 'nearly', 'American', 'manufacturers', 'muscle', 'car', 'models', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'accompanied', 'surfer', 'style', 'music', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'absolute', 'must', 'motor-heads', 'people', 'gasoline', 'running', 'veins', 'first', 'review', 'forgot', 'mention', 'liked', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'sent', 'DVD', 'sets', 'brothers', 'holiday', 'gifts', 'loved', 'too']",American Muscle Car: The Complete Series

I have seen all the episodes before buying the DVDs. I think if you love Muscle Cars then this is a must for you. Each Episode specialize in a certain model, and shows the history of the model including who was responsible for their creation. A lot of good interviews with noted designers, muscle car restores, and owners of the cars. I would recommend this DVD.

1432936,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B004XYABQ2,JAG 2.0,"[2, 2]","If you're interested in muscle cars or classic American cars, this 6-disc DVD set is for you! GTO's, 442's, Chevelles, Mustangs, Chargers, and more! Lots of burning rubber and throaty exhaust growls!This is the first three seasons of ""American Muscle Car"" - a series on SPEED channel and consists of 15 1/2 hours (Fifteen and a half hours of muscle cars! WOW!) of material on 6 discs. Each segment highlights a specific car or topic and is roughly 25 minutes long (the length of a 1/2-hour TV show without commercials). Each one focuses on a car's history, changes to the model over time, the engines, transmissions, options, etc. Each segment has excellent period video plus that of restored models. Lots of good views of all the cars, interiors and under hoods.This is a well-produced video series with good cinematography, decent soundtrack, interviews with experts, owners of restored cars and even some with men who designed or engineered these beauties! This is a good series that is fun to watch for the car buff - you will not be bored!Though most segments are about an individual model of car, some are about racing teams such as the ""Ramchargers"" or about the Hurst company, their contributions to racing and the special edition ""Hurst"" cars that were built. There were a few episodes that weren't ""muscle cars"" per se such as segments on the '55-57 Chevrolet Bel Air, the lettered Chrysler 300's and the Corvette...but I didn't mind and I don't think most viewers will either!This was a fun series and very enjoyable. There were segments on lesser known muscle cars such as the AMC ""AMX"" and the Dodge Dart GT and GTS as well as cars such as the Buick Regal GNX and Pontiac Super Duty Trans Am's that appeared after the muscle car era ended.This is a good, well-made, entertaining series that the car buff will like. Not only that, but you get 15 1/2 hours of cars for a little over $20! A great price for all you get! This is a must-have! Five stars!",5,Great fun!

However, I would have been more interested in shows about the more common Muscle Cars.  Not everyone could buy a Chevelle SS 454.  BUT, they could buy an SS 396 or 350.  The 427 Fords, 428 and 429 Cobra Jet engines, 426 Hemis, and the 454 Chevys were not high sellers.  People bought the Chevy small block 350, the Ford 289, the Mopar 383 or 440 and so on.
