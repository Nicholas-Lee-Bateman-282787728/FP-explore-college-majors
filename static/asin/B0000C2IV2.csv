The workouts are fun, feeling more like dance than an exercise class. That's really the best thing about them.  They are some of the few exercise dvds I've tried that have me looking forward to working out when I would otherwise be tempted to be a couch potato.  I particularly like the Tahitian Cardio for the emphasis on hip work and the graceful movements in it.On the technical end, it has what I look for in a workout dvd.  There is a warm up and cool down.  Kili teaches &#34;mirror&#34; style so it is easier to follow along.  The camerawork shows the full body unless it is appropriate to zoom in to show the movement in detail.  It is filmed outdoors against a beautiful Hawaiian background.  The music is an upbeat traditional sounding Tahitian drum piece that really sets the mood.The intensity level is moderate.  I tend to use this the most after the holidays when I have been in an exercise lull.  It is just the right amount to get me sweating without me thinking &#34;Enough already!&#34;  There are some standard aerobic exercise movements in it to work more muscle groups.  While I would have preferred just dance movements, the aerobic ones are kept to a minimum and serve a purpose.This may not be to the taste of people who are hardcore fitness or hardcore Tahitian dance buffs, but for the average person like me, it's a great way to keep motivated to keep moving.",5,Keeps Me Wanting to Exercise  :),1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,1458,"['Island', 'Girl', 'series', 'favorite', 'go-to', 'set', 'workouts', 'winter', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', 'feeling', 'more', 'dance', 'exercise', 'class', 'really', 'best', 'thing', 'are', 'few', 'exercise', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'have', 'looking', 'forward', 'working', 'out', 'when', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'tempted', 'be', 'couch', 'potato', 'particularly', 'Tahitian', 'Cardio', 'emphasis', 'hip', 'work', 'graceful', 'movements', 'it.On', 'technical', 'end', 'what', 'look', 'workout', 'dvd', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'Kili', '34', 'mirror', '34', 'style', 'easier', 'follow', 'along', 'camerawork', 'full', 'body', 'appropriate', 'zoom', 'show', 'movement', 'detail', 'filmed', 'outdoors', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'background', 'music', 'upbeat', 'traditional', 'sounding', 'Tahitian', 'drum', 'piece', 'really', 'mood.The', 'intensity', 'level', 'moderate', 'tend', 'use', 'most', 'holidays', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'exercise', 'lull', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'get', 'sweating', 'thinking', '34', 'Enough', 'already', '34', 'are', 'standard', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'movements', 'work', 'more', 'muscle', 'groups', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'just', 'dance', 'movements', 'aerobic', 'ones', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'serve', 'purpose.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'taste', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hardcore', 'fitness', 'hardcore', 'Tahitian', 'dance', 'buffs', 'average', 'person', 'great', 'way', 'keep', 'motivated', 'keep', 'moving']",N/A

773096,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0000C2IV2,C. Daly,"[6, 7]","Basically you learn four different kinds of hip movements.  Some of these are similar to bellydance if you have done that before.  These include:  hip circles, hip bumps side to side, figure 8s, and another side to side movement.  These movements are combined with walking side to side or back/front, or pivoting in a circle.  Simple arm movements are added as well.  Every once and awhile, she'll add some traditional fitness moves without hip movements (grapevine, step touch, squats, hops).  Then the hip movements will be added on.My heart rate didn't get up very high as the movements are generally done slowly.  The workout is very good for toning though, as many of the movements are done in squat position and really burn the legs.  What frustrated me the most was the coordination aspect--I found it really difficult to do some of the hip movements while stepping forward and back.  I'm just not that coordinated or used to isolating this area.  It's also tough to catch on to the subtle differences in hip movements that she teaches you.

There is alot of squating involved in this video, which one viewer said there wasn't, but there is. I watched the whole video before I did it and there is ALOT of squating, that's how your able to move your hip's the way the instructor show's you to. Also, there is a brief hopping move, but this you could probably just not do and keep moving through it (which the same viewer that said there was no squating or kneeling also said there was no hopping, did they even watch this video?) I did love the music it's very cultural and ""get's you moving"" Good drum beat. I just think they should rename this video for intermediate level and not begginer.

She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo com",5,Great authentic hula in workout form,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,946,"['loved', 'first', 'DVDs', 'Hula', 'Workout', 'used', 'cutsy', '60s', 'music', 'added', '60s', 'american', 'dance', 'moves', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'authetic', 'hula', 'dancing.These', 'Island', 'Girl', 'hula', 'workouts', 'are', 'more', 'authentic', 'Just', 'other', 'ones', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'abs', 'burn', 'hips', 'legs', 'get', 'nice', 'workout', 'authentic', 'dance', 'moves', 'added', 'quick', 'squats', 'etc', 'added', 'so', 'barely', 'notice', 'adding', 'toning', 'authentic', 'drum', 'Hawaiian', 'music', 'beautiful', 'keep', 'stimulted', 'too', 'keep', 'going', 'just', 'dance/rock', 'beat', 'would.I', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'learning', 'steps', 'are', 'plenty', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'everything', 'down', 'well', 'slowly', 'several', 'times', 'speeding', 'up', 'even', 'cues', 'YOUR', 'left', 'right', 'not', 'trailer', 'Hula', 'Workout', 'DVDs', 'authentic', 'Hula', 'workout', 'called', 'Island', 'Girl', 'Hula', 'Abs', 'Buns', 'collagevideo', 'com']",N/A
773126,ACZEW7QN3XCTH,B0000C2IV2,Virginia Mercurio,"[1, 1]","So after trying Kili's Abs and Hips Hula DVD, I decided to give this one a whirl.  It's a damn fine workout.It took me two tries to get through this workout.  For me, that's a good thing.  I am not a dancer, so I had to work through this DVD.  It is a bit harder than the Hula Abs and Hips DVD, so it was good to have the challenge.  This workout really made me sweat, and it was a lot of fun for me to do.  If anyone has done Kili's Hula Abs and Hips DVD, you'll recognize a lot of the moves like the kaholo, hela and kao.  There are a couple of new ones, which is what I think made me have to try it a couple times to get through it.There are very few things I didn't like about this workout.  For one thing, Kili mentions ""first position.""  I know some dance terminology, but if you don't know what that means, she doesn't explain it.  Also, she does not explain what a plie is at all.  I only knew what it was because I know some dance terminology.  Some of the camera angles are a little silly, but at least the camera man was shooting up Kili's skirt!All in all, it's a good workout.  It's certainly help get some variety in my workouts!",4,Good workout,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1143,"['So', 'trying', 'Kili', 'Abs', 'Hips', 'Hula', 'DVD', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'whirl', 'damn', 'fine', 'workout.It', 'took', 'two', 'tries', 'get', 'workout', 'good', 'thing', 'am', 'not', 'dancer', 'had', 'work', 'DVD', 'bit', 'harder', 'Hula', 'Abs', 'Hips', 'DVD', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'challenge', 'workout', 'really', 'made', 'sweat', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', 'anyone', 'done', 'Kili', 'Hula', 'Abs', 'Hips', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'lot', 'moves', 'kaholo', 'hela', 'kao', 'are', 'couple', 'new', 'ones', 'what', 'think', 'made', 'have', 'try', 'couple', 'times', 'get', 'it.There', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'workout', 'one', 'thing', 'Kili', 'mentions', 'first', 'position', 'know', 'dance', 'terminology', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Also', 'not', 'explain', 'what', 'plie', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'know', 'dance', 'terminology', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'little', 'silly', 'least', 'camera', 'man', 'was', 'shooting', 'up', 'Kili', 'skirt', 'good', 'workout', 'certainly', 'help', 'get', 'variety', 'workouts']",N/A

Having done it, I really enjoy the different elements it brings to my normal step, Firm and other DVD workouts.  I get bored with traditional DVD's focusing on abs only so if you do too, you will like using this DVD for abs and legs.Yes, there are squats and the focus is to take pressure off your back during the swivels/sways and place that into your legs.  Coordination will come with time and shouldnt be a de-motivator.. whats the point of picking it up right away?  I really like the possibility of tonining my obliques, abs, legs with this 40-min workout.I can defintely see a good workout library containing all of Kili's DVD's and inserting them at least weekly through one's workout regimen for variety and a challenge.",4,If you're looking for fun and different,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,902,"['read', 'review', 'felt', 'good', 'buying', 'knowledge', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'yet', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'change', 'workout', 'Having', 'done', 'really', 'enjoy', 'different', 'elements', 'normal', 'step', 'Firm', 'other', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'get', 'bored', 'traditional', 'DVD', 'focusing', 'abs', 'only', 'so', 'do', 'too', 'will', 'like', 'using', 'DVD', 'abs', 'legs.Yes', 'are', 'squats', 'focus', 'take', 'pressure', 'back', 'swivels/sways', 'place', 'legs', 'Coordination', 'will', 'come', 'time', 'shouldnt', 'be', 'de-motivator..', 'point', 'picking', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'really', 'possibility', 'tonining', 'obliques', 'abs', 'legs', '40-min', 'workout.I', 'can', 'defintely', 'see', 'good', 'workout', 'library', 'containing', 'Kili', 'DVD', 'inserting', 'least', 'weekly', 'one', 'workout', 'regimen', 'variety', 'challenge']",N/A
