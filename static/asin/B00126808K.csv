I actually did buy this dvd and love it so I felt like saying I like it. But I didn't take notes, so being lazy I'll rip off these figures from the amazon review (some of which I recall, some no). But dig this stuff--I mean people have actually figured this out: the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, oceans were formed by rainfall that lasted *literally* millions of years, the planet was totally encased in over a mile thick layer of ice about 700 million years ago and surface temperatures reached -40 degrees Fahrenheit. You should count yourself very lucky because much that is known of the Earth was only recently discovered in the last century or two. Even better luck for all of us is just the fact that the Earth even made it this long and that it happened to evolve in such a way as to produce life forms like us. This doc covers it all in 94 minutes. We see meteors forming the planet through countless collisions, witness the stunning disasters which have repeatedly erased most life forms from existence, and are revealed the probable destiny of Earth as a barren, lifeless, wasteland a few billion years from now. I recommend ""How the Earth Was Made"" to people that are interested in how the Earth was made and people that have money to spend and just enjoy a quality documentary.

I bought it under the impression from others here and from the product label that it presented a honest view of the Christian viewpoint of how the Earth was made. Instead, it set up the biblical view at the beginning, and then made you feel like an uninformed individual if you believed in creation. It then had the gall to admit within five minutes later that there was still controversary on how the oceans were created, so if you expect an honest viewpoint you are not going to get it here. Instead this DVD is basically a short CliffNotes version of a College 101 Physical Geology textbook as it attempts to cram 16 weeks of lecture material into 90 minutes of video. If I had not taken such a class within the past year, I would have been lost within the first few minutes since the DVD assumes you have a basic understanding of physical geology and what the main theories are, but for a balanced viewpoint of how the Earth was made, this DVD falls far short of all reality in that endeavor.",1,Don't Waste your Money on this DVD,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1057,"['personally', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'big', 'waste', 'money', 'bought', 'impression', 'others', 'here', 'product', 'label', 'presented', 'honest', 'view', 'Christian', 'viewpoint', 'how', 'Earth', 'was', 'made', 'Instead', 'set', 'up', 'biblical', 'view', 'beginning', 'then', 'made', 'feel', 'uninformed', 'individual', 'believed', 'creation', 'then', 'had', 'gall', 'admit', 'five', 'minutes', 'later', 'was', 'still', 'controversary', 'how', 'oceans', 'were', 'created', 'so', 'expect', 'honest', 'viewpoint', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'here', 'Instead', 'DVD', 'basically', 'short', 'CliffNotes', 'version', 'College', '101', 'Physical', 'Geology', 'textbook', 'cram', '16', 'weeks', 'lecture', 'material', '90', 'minutes', 'video', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'class', 'past', 'year', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'have', 'basic', 'understanding', 'physical', 'geology', 'what', 'main', 'theories', 'are', 'balanced', 'viewpoint', 'how', 'Earth', 'was', 'made', 'DVD', 'far', 'short', 'reality', 'endeavor']",How the Earth Was Made

Now, there's a scary thought.But it seems we don't have to panic just yet, according to the experts we still have a few billions years to go before earth becomes hell again. Phew, that's a relief!

1135119,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00126808K,magellan,"[3, 3]","As I had a modest background in geology from college (I minored in earth science), which was all the way back in the early 70s, I was interested to see how much the field had changed. I knew a bit about recent developments but you know how it is, what with job and career and stuff you lose track of your old interests so I was out of date on many things.This series made it dramatically clear that much had changed in the 35 years since I was in school. Back then, the oldest rocks known were in the Canadian Shield and the monzonite sands of Tanzania, which were a mere billion years old. Now they can go back over 3.5 billion years. Continental drift is now firmly established, but in my historical geology text by Dott and Batten, orogenesis (mountain building) was still discussed as possibly being explained by the geosynclinal theory of deposition of deep strata through erosion with mountains occurring from crustal isostatic rebound.But the most striking thing is how they can now interpret and date many of the most dramatic events in the earth's past, such as the ""Snowball Earth"" phase which started 1.5 billion years ago when all the continents came together in the southern hemisphere and stopped the ocean currents, which led to a prolonged cooling phase. Its end and the eventually warming phase eventually led to the Cambrian explosion. There there was the Siberian crustal eruption in the Permian which wiped out even more life (80%) than the iridium meteor strike that killed off the dinosaurs, and so on. This was the biggest volcanic event in earth's history.It was also fascinating to hear how the earth's atmosphere had changed; one reason Carboniferous insects and the later dinosaurs grew so big was that there was a greater percentage of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere than now (30% then compared to about 20% now).The show features on site footage of many of the most important geological finds around the world and their rocks, with expert commentary by the geology professors, of course. I thought this was a nice touch, having once hiked up to the location of the Burgess Shales in the Canadian Rockies and seen a few of these important geological locations myself.Overall a truly fascinating and informative series and one of the best nature documentaries ever done.",5,Very enjoyable and informative,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2299,"['had', 'modest', 'background', 'geology', 'college', 'minored', 'earth', 'science', 'was', 'way', 'back', 'early', '70s', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'field', 'had', 'changed', 'knew', 'bit', 'recent', 'developments', 'know', 'how', 'what', 'job', 'career', 'stuff', 'lose', 'track', 'old', 'interests', 'so', 'was', 'date', 'many', 'things.This', 'series', 'made', 'dramatically', 'clear', 'much', 'had', 'changed', '35', 'years', 'was', 'school', 'Back', 'then', 'oldest', 'rocks', 'known', 'were', 'Canadian', 'Shield', 'monzonite', 'sands', 'Tanzania', 'were', 'mere', 'billion', 'years', 'old', 'Now', 'can', 'go', 'back', '3.5', 'billion', 'years', 'Continental', 'drift', 'now', 'firmly', 'established', 'historical', 'geology', 'text', 'Dott', 'Batten', 'orogenesis', 'mountain', 'building', 'was', 'still', 'discussed', 'possibly', 'being', 'explained', 'geosynclinal', 'theory', 'deposition', 'deep', 'strata', 'erosion', 'mountains', 'occurring', 'crustal', 'isostatic', 'rebound.But', 'most', 'striking', 'thing', 'how', 'can', 'now', 'interpret', 'date', 'many', 'most', 'dramatic', 'events', 'earth', 'past', 'such', 'Snowball', 'Earth', 'phase', 'started', '1.5', 'billion', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'continents', 'came', 'together', 'southern', 'hemisphere', 'stopped', 'ocean', 'currents', 'led', 'prolonged', 'cooling', 'phase', 'end', 'eventually', 'warming', 'phase', 'eventually', 'led', 'Cambrian', 'explosion', 'was', 'Siberian', 'crustal', 'eruption', 'Permian', 'wiped', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'life', '80', '%', 'iridium', 'meteor', 'strike', 'killed', 'off', 'dinosaurs', 'so', 'was', 'biggest', 'volcanic', 'event', 'earth', 'history.It', 'was', 'also', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'how', 'earth', 'atmosphere', 'had', 'changed', 'one', 'reason', 'Carboniferous', 'insects', 'later', 'dinosaurs', 'grew', 'so', 'big', 'was', 'was', 'greater', 'percentage', 'oxygen', 'earth', 'atmosphere', 'now', '30', '%', 'then', 'compared', 'about', '20', '%', 'now', '.The', 'show', 'site', 'footage', 'many', 'most', 'important', 'geological', 'finds', 'world', 'rocks', 'expert', 'commentary', 'geology', 'professors', 'course', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'having', 'once', 'hiked', 'up', 'location', 'Burgess', 'Shales', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'seen', 'few', 'important', 'geological', 'locations', 'myself.Overall', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'informative', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'nature', 'ever', 'done']",How the Earth Was Made

But like a few others here, I was bothered by the politics of the ending.  Since human civilization has done so well during this warm interval between ice ages, it implies, perhaps global warming is good for us, delaying the next one.  And then, maybe worse--since the marching glaciers (double the height of the Empire State Building) will, one of these centuries, wipe out everything we have made, it will dwarf into insignificance any planetary degradation we perform.

1135123,A782XK9PZXA2F,B00126808K,R. R. Morris,"[1, 7]","I was surprised they mentioned the Bible in a program like this, perhaps I shouldn't have been. Sadly, they mention it but don't quote it. Some people believe the earth was `created' in less than a week. The first two Bible verses clearly shows the dark, wet earth (in addition to the heavens) existed even BEFORE the countdown of the creation days leading to life on earth. The earth by then could have been even billions of years old. Moving on to verse 3, the Bible never says the following `days' of creation were limited to six 24 hour periods. Comparably, Genesis 2:2 sums up the whole creation as ""the day"" as opposed to 6 or 7 days. The days indicate a period of time, that's all the `clockwork' the Bible shows. (Should we disregard a Birth Certificate simply because we differ on how long it took for the baby to be born?)  Additionaly, the Bible doesn't say the earth is the center of the universe or is flat. Isaiah 40:20, Job 26:7. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to quote human interpretation of the Bible rather than the Bible itself, therefore some people, become quick to dismiss what scientific authenticity the Bible does contain.I generally enjoy these types of programs. I take them as they are; theories. Every new DVD that comes out has their own unique and different speculations on the universe. The latest known scientific information is concluded to be the facts until the next new discovery once again `rewrites the book'. It seems there are at least as many scientific theories as there are religious interpretations, and science is as divisive as (misapplied) religion! John 13:35One thing these programs (and science books too) do regularly have in common is the order or sequence of things arriving on the universal scene: Heavens and earth, land and water, plants, fish....on up to, lastly, humans. They end up typically the same as the Biblical order and sequence. Is that a coincidence?I like and watch these programs because I believe it is wise to question and compare what we and others believe rather than merely accept or reject it blindly. And to do so in an enjoyable, uplifting way, rather than arguing or blasting in a derogatory manner. Religious, cultural and scientific communities too, sometimes tend to make extreem conclusions that  ""Truth"" is either our own personal interpretation, or ""Democratic""; what the majority says is right. Jesus himself showed most people will be wrong, on certain issues, at least. Matthew 7:13,14,22,23. Let's humbly keep our minds open, learn and primarily, ""Love thy neighbor"".Could mankind ever build a factory that will make production for 4.5 billion years so efficiently that people would end up arguing, it is running with no external conscientiousness? For production to keep running with such enduring quantitiy and quality, there would have to have been extreem fore-thought and preplanning by some one who's no dummy! Really, all of these types of programs prove the Creator's power and artistic, loving, wisdom on this most unique planet, whether it's aknowledged or not. Romans 1:20 Let's be thankful we're alive here to see it!OK, off my soapbox now.....Technical thoughts on the DVD: It was made in 2007, but still in letterboxed format.

It was ok but just not what I hoped for.  I did show it in my Earth science class and the students seemed to tolerate it, maybe because they didn't have to listen to me for a little bit.  But there were many that were fighting to stay awake.  The presentation is very dry despite the good graphics.  I felt the science was informative but it left lots of gaps which had to be connected and filled in.  I'd have to agree with another reviewer in saying that in some instances it assumes you already have some geology background. But I even more so it makes some claims and statements that are not completely correct which again if you don't know the rest of the story you will end up misinformed.  So if you are inclined to Earth science and geology and have some working knowledge this may be a good video for you.  But if you have little or no background and aren't interested in that type of material this video is probably not for you.
