Regardless, it's a fun movie, and Helen Hunt is great in it, as are all of her family characters, and the actors playing the usual city fathers. It doesn't stand up to &#34;Rudy,&#34; but it's not intended to. I had it in my VHS tape library years ago, and was pleased to finally find it for a cost I was willing to pay on DVD. It's the same as the VHS tape version--no special features, but it is DVD quality.",3,Based on a true story,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,539,"['one', 'better', 'movies', 'football', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'lot', 'hype', 'real', 'story', 'too', 'Regardless', 'fun', 'movie', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'great', 'are', 'family', 'characters', 'actors', 'playing', 'usual', 'city', 'fathers', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', '34', 'Rudy', '34', 'not', 'intended', 'had', 'VHS', 'tape', 'library', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'pleased', 'finally', 'find', 'cost', 'was', 'willing', 'pay', 'DVD', 'same', 'VHS', 'tape', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'quality']",N/A

In any case, it is the true account of Tami Maida's struggle to be allowed to play football with the all guy team.  The story was fairly current with the actual events.  Tami had to dodge sexual prejudice, school politics, peer pressure, etc to be allowed to play Quarterback.  With a lot of spunk, a supportive family, and some real talent, this young lady (played by Helen Hunt in a very early role) beat the odds and won the respect of a great many people.  I remember all of us (two sons, a daughter, and myself) crying at the end.  FYI, I still cry at the ending.  I just sent a copy to my grandaughter.  She's a &#34;tough nut&#34;, but she might crack and she'd a few tears with her Mom!
