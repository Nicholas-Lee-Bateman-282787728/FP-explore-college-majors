981464,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000F1IQNC,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 4]","`Nanny McPhee' is charming to the last.  The story starts with the Brown household in chaos.  Mr. Brown, a widower (in an earnest bumbling performance from Collin Firth) is a breadwinner who hardly carves out any time for his children.  Smart, but not wise, the children look upon every hired nanny as a nuisance; one they find endless ways to turn in her apron in an extraordinarily short amount of time.  At wits end, he consults the nanny agency for the last time, but, finally, no one will work for him.  That is until independent nanny, Nanny McGhee (a marvelous Emma Thompson), pops up (literally) at his door.  Spellbound, she brings some new order to roost, pronouncing her wishes to the children and using her magical walking stick to enforce consequences on their self-willed ways.  In the meantime, strict Aunt Adelaide (featuring illustrious Angela Lansberry--from blonde bombshell to super sleuth to [here] indomitable matriarch) will cut off his allowance if he doesn't marry by the end of the month.  It seems also having Auntie's way, he will have to give up one of his children to her.  Rashly, he chooses Mrs. Quickly (played with comic wickedness by Celia Imrie), even though his preference for Evangeline, (Beautiful Kelly McDonald) a servant.  With five lessons to learn, Nanny McPhee warns, ""If you don't want me, but you need me, I'll stay, but when you want me, but no longer need me, I will have to go.""Such enchanted development and straightforward mischief make `Nanny McPhee' a  shelf-worthy family movie.  Visually, they color every scene beautifully to accentuate a fun family film.  (Based on 'Nurse Matilda,' a children's book serial by Christianna Brand. Screenplay by Emma Thompson.)  Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi, joins an endearing cast in this lovable children's romp.",4,Enchanting,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,1810,"['Nanny', 'McPhee', 'charming', 'last', 'story', 'Brown', 'household', 'chaos', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'widower', 'earnest', 'bumbling', 'performance', 'Collin', 'Firth', 'breadwinner', 'who', 'hardly', 'out', 'time', 'children', 'Smart', 'not', 'wise', 'children', 'look', 'hired', 'nanny', 'nuisance', 'one', 'find', 'endless', 'ways', 'turn', 'apron', 'extraordinarily', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'wits', 'end', 'nanny', 'agency', 'last', 'time', 'finally', 'one', 'will', 'work', 'independent', 'nanny', 'Nanny', 'McGhee', 'marvelous', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'up', 'literally', 'door', 'Spellbound', 'new', 'order', 'roost', 'pronouncing', 'wishes', 'children', 'using', 'magical', 'walking', 'stick', 'enforce', 'consequences', 'self-willed', 'ways', 'meantime', 'strict', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'featuring', 'illustrious', 'Angela', 'Lansberry', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'super', 'sleuth', '[', 'here', ']', 'indomitable', 'matriarch', 'will', 'cut', 'off', 'allowance', ""n't"", 'marry', 'end', 'month', 'also', 'having', 'Auntie', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'children', 'Rashly', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'played', 'comic', 'wickedness', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'even', 'preference', 'Evangeline', 'Beautiful', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'servant', 'five', 'lessons', 'learn', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'need', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'when', 'want', 'no', 'longer', 'need', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'Such', 'enchanted', 'development', 'straightforward', 'mischief', 'make', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'shelf-worthy', 'family', 'movie', 'Visually', 'color', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'accentuate', 'fun', 'family', 'film', 'Based', ""'Nurse"", 'Matilda', 'children', 'book', 'serial', 'Christianna', 'Brand', 'Screenplay', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'endearing', 'cast', 'lovable', 'children', 'romp']",N/A

981467,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F1IQNC,A Customer,"[5, 5]","The flustered and poor undertaker Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is having a terrible time with his children. Unruly and precocious, the Brown brats have invaded the kitchen, tie up Mrs. Blatherwick -- the family's russet-colored cook (Imelda Staunton) and have exhausted both the resources and the patience of the local nanny agency.After their 17th governess flees the premises in hysterics, Mr. Brown at the agency's door, but is denied admittance. Luckily, he hears the voice of Nanny McPhee (Emma Thomson) who abruptly and unceremoniously arrives on his doorstep just in time to rescue the cook and the kitchen from being destroyed.  The Nanny is a foreboding presence indeed, calm, cool and collected, she quietly tells the children to clean up the kitchen and go to bed.She is indeed a shocking sight, dressed in black, Her eyes are beady and black, her nose a bulbous monstrosity, and from her upper lip a single snaggletooth descends in the direction of her two frighteningly whiskered warts. There is nothing about her that could be described as warm or fuzzy, and her manner sets the children on edge: We will never want you,'' says the oldest boy Simon (Thomas Sangster), the oldest boy and also the most incorrigible. ""Then I will never go,'' she replies.Her arrival is an absolute godsend for Mr. Brown, as he needs to get the children in order so that he can attract a wife. His evil parrot-nosed, semi-blind aristocrat Aunt Adelaide (a fabulous Angela Lansbury) has threatened to withdraw the stipend that keeps the family together, unless he can find a bride control his children.In the meantime, the lovely Evangeline, the Brown's scullery maid (Kelly Macdonald) watches over the family and seems more like Mr. Brown's type than the wicked and tacky Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie) who seems more concerned with obtaining the family's inheritance than being a mother to the children.Nanny McPhee is a real delight and highlights some fine British talent. Colin Firth is very good as the harried and ineffectual father who turns to his late wife's empty chair to consult with her on a mounting list of family-threatening problems. But most extraordinary of all is the wonderful Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is without vanity and without flaw. She never allows Nanny McPhee to become cute and overly nice and she never sells out the children's wishes.The film has a real Dickensian feel to it, complete with gaudy and vibrant colours and it tumbles along at the speed of a cartoon, with everything over-accentuated and all so very British. The dialogue is also wonderfully droll, as when Aunt Adelaide huffs, ""If there's one thing I won't stand for, is loose vowels!"" Fairy tale or not, the film is a real charmer and great fun for adults and kids alike!

981468,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B000F1IQNC,Alexiel,"[6, 6]","If anyone said they didn't like this movie, I would not argue with them. It depends on the viewer and their mood, how much you're willing to buy into the movie and let it work its charm (or not). For me, it works. It helped my expectations were pretty low, but actually, I liked this movie and I did enjoy it, and my niece and nephew liked it. While I'm not saying they are the barometers of what children will like, I think this is a good movie for kids. It is Mary Poppins-like, but I don't think a movie like this has to be predicated on any kind of originality.The movie excels in a lot of areas, but I for one am a fan of fairy tales, magical realism, and stories set back in the past, so that was already a plus for the get-go. ""Nanny McPhee"" is about a widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) is a mortuary make-up artist who lives in a seemingly endless house with his maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), the cook, and his seven children, Simon, Tora, Eric, Lily, Sebastian, Christianna, and baby Agatha. The children are pretty rotten without a mother around, and they drive every nanny they have wild and cause the nannies to quit with their belligerent and mischievous antics. At the beginning of the film I must say I doubted I was going to buy any turnaround that made these kids sympathetic. Alas, I was mistaken. Anyway, Mr. Brown has to deal with how to raise his kids without a mother and his domineering late wife's aunt, Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). Aunt Adelaide is wealthy and supporting the family (that house must cost a fortune to keep up, as well as the raising of 7 kids), but she threatens to cut off the money unless Mr. Brown gets married within a month (because she thinks the children need a mother's discipline).Since this is 19th century England, we have a pretty good idea what this will entail - the father gets sent to debtors' prison, the kids will go to austere orphanages or workhouses, etc. So things are looking pretty grim, until, almost by magic, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) shows up and offers to take the vacated nanny position. And everything changes.The story is pretty predictable, but if you're watching this for outrageous plot twists, you've picked the wrong DVD. What you will find is a charming fantasy with a great sense of time, place, design, character, humor, and heart. The look of the movie is great, such vibrant and almost otherworldly colors let you know what kind of movie this is. Everything, from the setting of the village and the house, to the clothing, the furniture, is all top notch in my opinion. The story is well-written, the children are sharp and smart, which was nice, considering some stories like these insult kids' intelligent, the dialogue is a proper mix of heartfelt moments and good humor. The casting, I think, is inspired. Colin Firth was born to play roles like these, and he pulls it off very well. Likewise, no one plays the sweet, humbly beautiful lower class young British woman character better than Kelly Macdonald. She rarely disappoints in any of her movies I've seen. Angela Lansbury was wickedly delightful in her role as the evil aunt. Emma Thompson may not have a role with as much outward ""meat"" on it, but she fills in the spaces and performs her role well. The children are all very convincing and good in their roles. Even the secondary characters, like the cook and the undertakers do a great job with their parts. All around, fine casting and fine acting.To conclude, reading these reviews on here should give you a good idea of whether this is your (or the kids') kind of movie or not. I'd recommend giving it a shot, it's a pleasant and enjoyable film.",4,Very good for what it is.,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3657,"['anyone', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'argue', 'viewer', 'mood', 'how', 'much', ""'re"", 'willing', 'buy', 'movie', 'let', 'work', 'charm', 'not', 'helped', 'expectations', 'were', 'pretty', 'low', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', 'enjoy', 'niece', 'nephew', 'liked', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'are', 'barometers', 'what', 'children', 'will', 'like', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'Mary', 'Poppins-like', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'be', 'predicated', 'kind', 'originality.The', 'movie', 'excels', 'lot', 'areas', 'one', 'am', 'fan', 'fairy', 'tales', 'magical', 'realism', 'stories', 'set', 'back', 'past', 'was', 'already', 'plus', 'get-go', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'widower', 'Cedric', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'mortuary', 'make-up', 'artist', 'who', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'house', 'maid', 'Evangeline', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'cook', 'seven', 'children', 'Simon', 'Tora', 'Eric', 'Lily', 'Sebastian', 'Christianna', 'baby', 'Agatha', 'children', 'are', 'pretty', 'rotten', 'mother', 'around', 'drive', 'nanny', 'have', 'wild', 'cause', 'nannies', 'quit', 'belligerent', 'mischievous', 'antics', 'beginning', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'doubted', 'was', 'going', 'buy', 'turnaround', 'made', 'kids', 'sympathetic', 'Alas', 'was', 'mistaken', 'Anyway', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'deal', 'how', 'raise', 'kids', 'mother', 'domineering', 'late', 'wife', 'aunt', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'wealthy', 'supporting', 'family', 'house', 'must', 'cost', 'fortune', 'keep', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'raising', '7', 'kids', 'cut', 'off', 'money', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'married', 'month', 'children', 'need', 'mother', 'discipline', '.Since', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'entail', 'father', 'sent', 'debtors', 'prison', 'kids', 'will', 'go', 'austere', 'orphanages', 'workhouses', 'etc', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'pretty', 'grim', 'almost', 'magic', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'up', 'take', 'vacated', 'nanny', 'position', 'everything', 'changes.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'predictable', ""'re"", 'watching', 'outrageous', 'plot', 'twists', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'What', 'will', 'find', 'charming', 'fantasy', 'great', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'design', 'character', 'humor', 'heart', 'look', 'movie', 'great', 'such', 'vibrant', 'almost', 'otherworldly', 'colors', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'Everything', 'setting', 'village', 'house', 'clothing', 'furniture', 'top', 'notch', 'opinion', 'story', 'well-written', 'children', 'are', 'sharp', 'smart', 'was', 'nice', 'considering', 'stories', 'insult', 'kids', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'proper', 'mix', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'good', 'humor', 'casting', 'think', 'inspired', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'roles', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'Likewise', 'one', 'sweet', 'humbly', 'beautiful', 'lower', 'class', 'young', 'British', 'woman', 'character', 'better', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'rarely', 'disappoints', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'was', 'wickedly', 'delightful', 'role', 'evil', 'aunt', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'role', 'as', 'much', 'meat', 'spaces', 'role', 'well', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'good', 'roles', 'Even', 'secondary', 'characters', 'cook', 'undertakers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'parts', 'fine', 'casting', 'fine', 'acting.To', 'conclude', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'should', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'kids', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'giving', 'shot', 'pleasant', 'enjoyable', 'film']",N/A

Lappen,"[8, 10]","Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) supports his adorable but difficult brood off a monthly allowance provided by his beloved late wife's great aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). Alas, the ultra-proper lady, a straight-backed, coiffured and hatted old bitty, demands that he discipline his seven devils, who aim chiefly to dispatch nannies as soon as they arrive. The little dears keep a running total, via a colored chalk graph upon their blackboard, of how quickly they have dispensed with the last 17 to grace their nursery. The most recent came and went within days.Cook loathes the children, and constantly waves her contract, which prohibits them from entering her kitchen. Only the gorgeous scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), has a spec of kindness for either the kids or their hapless dad.Not only cannot poor Mr. Brown support his children on his wages from the mortuary, where he works alongside the sympathetic but vaudevillian Mr. Jowl and Mr. Wheen (Derek Jacobi). He now has more problems to boot. Aunt Adelaide commands him to find a new nanny at once--and worse, to marry within the month, or loose his allowance. Finally, she insists on relieving his burdens by taking one of his children in as her own adopted child.Mr. Brown turns to the Nanny Placement Center, but it has shut its doors, proclaiming there are ""no more nannies."" Through the mailbox, a voice echoes, ""You need Nanny McPhee."" He heads home in despair. His newspaper, cut into paper dolls, sports an add for Nanny McPhee. Then the toothy, fat, warted, large-bosomed, big-nosed woman (an amazingly-ugly-and-well-made-up Emma Thompson) appears in silhouette at his Victorian glass door and quickly promises to teach Mr. Brown's children five sacrosanct lessons.The first one is to say please and thank you: The kids set off to the kitchen to their latest antics, but Nanny McPhee outwits them with a tap of her crooked walking stick. Their mischief grows ever-more fast and furious, so they cannot stop, even when the baby is about to be hurled into a boiling pot. Thus, they all beg Nanny McPhee to ""please"" stop the culinary chaos. Another tap of the cane brings order and neatness all around.The greater problem is how to deal with Aunt Adelaide's command that Mr. Brown marry. Heavy-hearted, he settles on a garish and obscene widow, Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), despite warnings from his mortuary friends and the most mischievous efforts of his children. The subtle gentleness with which Nanny McPhee helps the Browns to cope with their problems is what makes this magic movie such a delight.Nanny McPhee is far more enterprising than Mary Poppins ever was and the movie is much more dramatic and entertaining than the ""classic"" musical Disney fare.

It had great potential, including a cast of the British luminaries Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, and a good deal of charm and heart, but ultimately failed to deliver on two of its most important attributes: plot and the Nanny. Nanny Mcphee, as a modernized, Willy-Wonka version of Mary Poppins, fails miserably, the worst part being that she's actually frightening. Mary Poppins, as played by Julie Andrews, was strict and firm and occasionally a little frightening, but NEVER cruel. Emma Thompson's nanny is not averse to bringing one of the children to near-death to make sure that they get the point. By the time the little boy has been lifted away from the boiling oil, the children have got the point: Nanny McPhee is boss, and so has the audience; we don't like her. As a ""comedic"" replacement for Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee is unfunny, ugly, and burdened with a ridiculous buck tooth and a decidedly odd manner. She is mysterious rather than magical, inhuman rather than ""practically perfect"", and the plot has the vague feeling of something stretched over too little material. There is a good deal of charm, mostly provided by the children carrying out a series of predictable but highly amusing pranks to drive their prospective step-mother away and by a really beautiful love story that develops in the last 5-10 minutes of the film, and great cinematography, but this only partially cancels out the genuinely creepy parts and the frothy lack of plot.

Despite the fact that I like both Emma Thompson and Collin Firth, I really didn't think I'd like it.  The theme seemed too contrived and forced, a way of cashing in on the recent burgeoning interest in children's stories that has been fostered by the likes of Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket, and Lion, Witch and Wardrobe.Recently I was feeling a little down and in the mood to watch something light and fanciful with a happy ending.  They say nothing helps a person over a down time than a little laughter, so I decided to give Nannie McPhee a try.  I was very surprised.  The concept, while hardly new, of a nannie shaping up the troublesome children of busy parents is always fun.  I grew up in the Mary Poppins era, so the idea was familiar to me.  How much more entertaining the sinister Nannie McPhee than the saccharine Mary Poppins!  And how much more ""evil"" the troublesome kids!  I had a lot more fun than I expected to have.My favorite character is the cook.  Her staunch insistence that the kitchen was off limits to the children because she ""had it in writing,"" was delightful.  When she ended up restrained and gaged by the little monsters, with all hell breaking lose around her, it was truly wonderful.  Her's was probably the most challenging role.I've seen Firth in better roles--his Mr. Darcy is definitive in my opinion, and I've seen several versions of Pride and Prejudice, including Olivier's--but he was a little limp in this role.  This is probably because he is not the focus of the story, despite the fact that it is his character's predicament and sacrifice that is the turning point of the tale.  In many ways one has to respect the actor for this underplayed characterization, because he does not try to take over the ""stage"" from his younger collegues, ala Jim Carrey.The children are very good, particularly the oldest boy, Simon.  His growth as a character really made the story.  In fact, I'd say that it is his growth as a character that is the lynch pin of the entire story.  The actor, Thomas Sangster, was superb and one looks forward to seeing him develop in other roles in the future.A lot more fun than I expected it to be.",5,More fun than I'd expected,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2266,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'film', 'movie', 'theater', 'really', 'had', 'intention', 'seeing', 'fact', 'like', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Collin', 'Firth', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'theme', 'seemed', 'too', 'contrived', 'forced', 'way', 'cashing', 'recent', 'burgeoning', 'interest', 'children', 'stories', 'been', 'fostered', 'likes', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe.Recently', 'was', 'feeling', 'little', 'down', 'mood', 'watch', 'something', 'light', 'fanciful', 'happy', 'ending', 'say', 'nothing', 'person', 'down', 'time', 'little', 'laughter', 'decided', 'give', 'Nannie', 'McPhee', 'try', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'concept', 'hardly', 'new', 'nannie', 'shaping', 'up', 'troublesome', 'children', 'busy', 'parents', 'always', 'fun', 'grew', 'up', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'era', 'idea', 'was', 'familiar', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'sinister', 'Nannie', 'McPhee', 'saccharine', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'evil', 'troublesome', 'kids', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'expected', 'have.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'cook', 'staunch', 'insistence', 'kitchen', 'was', 'off', 'limits', 'children', 'had', 'writing', 'was', 'delightful', 'When', 'ended', 'up', 'restrained', 'gaged', 'little', 'monsters', 'hell', 'breaking', 'lose', 'was', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'challenging', 'role.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Firth', 'better', 'roles', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'definitive', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'versions', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'including', 'Olivier', 'was', 'little', 'limp', 'role', 'probably', 'not', 'focus', 'story', 'fact', 'character', 'predicament', 'sacrifice', 'turning', 'point', 'tale', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'respect', 'actor', 'underplayed', 'characterization', 'not', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'stage', 'younger', 'collegues', 'ala', 'Jim', 'Carrey.The', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'oldest', 'boy', 'Simon', 'growth', 'character', 'really', 'made', 'story', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'growth', 'character', 'lynch', 'pin', 'entire', 'story', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'was', 'superb', 'one', 'forward', 'seeing', 'develop', 'other', 'roles', 'future.A', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'expected', 'be']",N/A

All of the children are very mischievious and drive away all the nannies that their father hires (Presumably out of a want to spend time with him because he is so busy.). The cycle is broken with nanny Mcphee but she isn't your comely  magical madien from the sky like Mary Poppins, nor are her abilities apparent from the beginning.  She first appears as a very ugly woman in a black dress  with a cane. Her ugliness fades as the children's behavior improves she also has an emphasis on the notion of consequences her (assumed)counterpart did not.I won't spoil anymore of the plot for you. The awesomness  is too awesome to be spolied.Another thing I like about this film is that it's got good moral undertones without being heavy-handed or preachy. There are no intentionally scary moments and the movie is quite comedic during some parts (A little of the humor was on the bad side though). I enjoyed the film thouroughly and I highly recommend it (Check my other reviews to see how often I can say something  like that)The only issue I've got with the film is that there is one instance in which the word ""Hell"" is used out of context but the person has a thick accent and it took me quite awhile to pick up on the fact so  there are about two questionable scenes drowned out by a whole lot of awesome.

This delightful film was based on children's stories about Nurse Matilda, and adapted by Emma Thompson who was Nanny McPhee, a magical gnome-like creature.  She'd arrived on the scene after the seven unruly children had successfully run off the 17th nannie from the agency, Nannys of Distinction.  This was no ordinary British household, as there was a cook and scullery maid named Evangelina.Cedric Brown is caught between finding another wife or losing his brood.  He seems to be driven to distraction by this possibility and spends a lot of time talking to his dead wife's empty chair.  He never spends time with the children who are in constant turmoil because of their mother's death.  Simon's the eldest and is the precocious leader of all their mischief, played beautifully by Thomas Sangster, who could be the twin for Brett.When the ""government nanny"" with a magic walking stick enters their lives, she has five lessons to teach the family and explains, ""I cannot interfere with affairs of the heart.""  At first, her strange appearance and strict discipline are like a bad dream, as she tames the clever children.  After they learn to trust her, her appearance starts to change for the better as her ugliness fades away in phases.Nanny teaches them to adapt to circumstances in order to stay together as a family.  The servant is transformed into an acceptable stepmother.  She'd grown to love the children but Simon had told her ""You're paid to like us and that doesn't count.""  At the outdoor garden wedding, it could have been a scene from Bennie Hill's outrageousness as the ""well-behaved and groomed children"" start their hijinks again, this time to save their father from a domestic life of doom.The prospective stepmother is worse than Cinderella's and, after they do what has to be done to stay together as a family (""that's all that matters""), the story evolves into a fairy-tale ending.  Snow in August transforms Evangelina, played by Kelly Macdonald, into a princess bride.

Mr. Brown is so distraught by the recent loss of his wife and his ensuing financial troubles that he has been ignoring his children.  They, being smart and willful, have become terrors.  All very ""done before"" and predictable.  But the story is quite well done, and is particularly spot-on with Nanny McPhee's ""education"" of the children.The movie has a very good supporting cast, lead by Celia Imrie as the humorously awful stepmother-to-be, and Angela Lansbury, really fantastic as the terrible Aunt.  Unfortunately, Firth as Mr. Brown is so clueless as to be hard to watch.Emma Thompson is very good as Nanny McPhee, a character that by intention starts a bit off-putting, but becomes quite endearing.  Even so, I found the makeup to be overdone.

It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her?Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed.

Hamlow,"[108, 108]","That's what Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), the widower father of seven children who'd take the team Olympic Gold for mischief-making does.  Working at a funeral parlor with two silly assistants, Mr. Jowl and Mr.Wheen (Derek Jacobi), he relies on nannies to look after his offspring, but his childrens' antics are all to drive away the nannies;  in the case of Nanny Weston, they make as if they were eating the youngest, an infant.Mcphee (Emma Thompson) arrives at the Brown resident one stormy night, and her profile silhouetted outside the door reminds me of the shudder one thinks when Alfred Hitchcock's profile is shown on his show.  If the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins were thrown together, one would get Nanny McPhee.  She's clearly no beauty, as she has two warts on her face, a swollen nose, and a tooth that hangs over her lower lip.  She also carries a crooked staff which she taps on the floor in order to conjure magic.She wastes no time in getting the kids well-behaved, especially in a scene where the children have invaded the kitchen in defiance of their father punishing them.  Her way is akin to forcing a PS2 junkie to keep playing games until he either gets bleeding controller blisters or his eyes pop out of his skull.  Result, he'll have had enough.Brown is gratified that her only conditions are that she teach his rambunctious kids five lessons and that she requires Sunday afternoons off.  The lessons include saying please and thank you, going to bed on time, getting up on time, and doing what they're told.  And mysteriously, when one of the lessons are learned, her warts disappear until...Brown though is quite ineffectual in enforcing discipline in the household, as he is wishy-washy and too busy at his job.  It's clear that the death of his wife, whom he still talks to via the empty chair she used to sit in, is still affecting him.  His oldest, Simon says that he doesn't care about or spend time with them like he did when their mother was alive.  But he is living off an allowance from his forbidding Aunt Adelaide, and if he doesn't marry by the end of the month, she'll cut him off.  The children will be sent to foster homes or put to work in the workhouses.  He's desperate enough to choose Selma Quickly, a disreputable and loudmouthed woman whose taste in colours are a garish dayglo fuschia and green, as a prospective new wife.  Why not Evangeline, the scullery maid who's learning to read and is concerned about the children?Three performers from Love Actually are reunited.  They are Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and Thomas Sangster, who played Liam Neeson's son.  Thompson provides the film's sole center of stability and rationality, a soothing contrast to the stiff eccentricity of Angela Lansbury's Aunt Adelaide, and Celia Imry's vulgar Quickly.McPhee's five lessons are values that seem to have been lost on the kids of today's era.  In fact, they seem to have more in common with the wild jungle mentality the Brown children have in the beginning. She tells her charges:  ""When you need me, but do not want me, then I will stay.  When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go.""  Nanny McPhee effectively joins the ranks of Mary Poppins and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in instilling good manners and values in children.",4,What you need is Nanny McPhee,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,3326,"['what', 'Mr.', 'Cedric', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'widower', 'father', 'seven', 'children', 'who', ""'d"", 'take', 'team', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'mischief-making', 'Working', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'two', 'silly', 'assistants', 'Mr.', 'Jowl', 'Mr.Wheen', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'nannies', 'look', 'offspring', 'childrens', 'antics', 'are', 'drive', 'away', 'nannies', 'case', 'Nanny', 'Weston', 'make', 'were', 'eating', 'youngest', 'infant.Mcphee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Brown', 'resident', 'one', 'stormy', 'night', 'profile', 'silhouetted', 'door', 'shudder', 'one', 'when', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'profile', 'shown', 'show', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'clearly', 'beauty', 'two', 'warts', 'face', 'swollen', 'nose', 'tooth', 'lower', 'lip', 'also', 'crooked', 'staff', 'floor', 'order', 'conjure', 'magic.She', 'time', 'getting', 'kids', 'well-behaved', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'children', 'have', 'invaded', 'kitchen', 'defiance', 'father', 'punishing', 'way', 'akin', 'forcing', 'PS2', 'junkie', 'keep', 'playing', 'games', 'bleeding', 'controller', 'blisters', 'eyes', 'pop', 'skull', 'Result', ""'ll"", 'have', 'had', 'enough.Brown', 'gratified', 'only', 'conditions', 'are', 'teach', 'rambunctious', 'kids', 'five', 'lessons', 'Sunday', 'afternoons', 'off', 'lessons', 'include', 'saying', 'please', 'thank', 'going', 'bed', 'time', 'getting', 'up', 'time', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'mysteriously', 'when', 'one', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'warts', 'disappear', 'Brown', 'quite', 'ineffectual', 'enforcing', 'discipline', 'household', 'wishy-washy', 'too', 'busy', 'job', 'clear', 'death', 'wife', 'whom', 'still', 'empty', 'chair', 'used', 'sit', 'still', 'affecting', 'oldest', 'Simon', ""n't"", 'care', 'spend', 'time', 'did', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'alive', 'living', 'off', 'allowance', 'forbidding', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', ""n't"", 'marry', 'end', 'month', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'off', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'foster', 'homes', 'put', 'work', 'workhouses', 'desperate', 'enough', 'choose', 'Selma', 'Quickly', 'disreputable', 'loudmouthed', 'woman', 'taste', 'colours', 'are', 'garish', 'dayglo', 'fuschia', 'green', 'prospective', 'new', 'wife', 'Why', 'not', 'Evangeline', 'scullery', 'maid', 'who', 'learning', 'read', 'concerned', 'children', 'Three', 'performers', 'Love', 'Actually', 'are', 'reunited', 'are', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'who', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'son', 'Thompson', 'film', 'sole', 'center', 'stability', 'rationality', 'soothing', 'contrast', 'stiff', 'eccentricity', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'Celia', 'Imry', 'vulgar', 'Quickly.McPhee', 'five', 'lessons', 'are', 'values', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'kids', 'today', 'era', 'fact', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'wild', 'jungle', 'mentality', 'Brown', 'children', 'have', 'beginning', 'charges', 'When', 'need', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'then', 'will', 'stay', 'When', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'then', 'have', 'go', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'effectively', 'ranks', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'instilling', 'good', 'manners', 'values', 'children']",N/A

Some of the scenes had a cheese factor that I could not help laughing out loud at, but was stunned to see my wife and daughters not laughing at all...and intrigued to see my response.  We pressed on.I think the story line of the movie is somewhat predictable...at least I guessed the ending shortly into the movie and was hushed quickly by one of the kids who had seen it.Still, there were many great family scenes that depict problems lots of families have including misunderstanding motives of close family members and what children really want from their family.  I found one scene after another quite entertaining (and that's really the idea in movies isn't it?).By the time we were done, I felt our family was closer to one another and a good mood and tone was set for our Memorial Day Holiday Week-end.Without giving away the plot, I would like to just say that this movie is above average as far as movies go.  I think that most Dads need to watch this movie with an open mind.  We all can learn something from it.  Guys raising early teens probably need to watch this more than most people.

His unruly brood of seven children drove her screaming out into the street and he is desperate to find a replacement. His scullery maid, Evangeline, does what she can to help, but Brown goes to the Nanny agency to find a full-time Nanny. However, no Nanny will work with the Brown family. Mr. Brown hears a mysterious voice telling him he needs to hire Nanny McPhee, so when she shows up at his doorstep, he is only too glad to offer her employment. Nanny McPhee has magical powers that she uses on the children, but that only solves one of Mr. Brown's problems. His late wife's Aunt Adelaide has been sending him money to help support the family, but she threatens to withhold the money unless Mr. Brown remarries quickly. Desperate to marry (and unable to recognize who he truly loves), Brown arranges to marry a truly obnoxious woman who threatens the happiness of the entire Brown family. But not to worry, Nanny McPhee still has some magic up her sleeve.Nanny McPhee is a very nice, enjoyable family film (although it will probably appeal more to women than men).  The movie is a cross between ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" (without the singing). It has lots of magic and silly goofy fun (as an adult I groaned at yet another food fight in a movie, but kids will love the scene). There's lot of eccentric characters, starting with Nanny McPhee herself and onto the cook, Aunt Adelaide, Mr. Brown's coworkers, and Mrs. Quickly, the would-be second Mrs. Brown. Kids will love the sight gags, especially the ones involving animals. Adults will appreciate running gags such as Nanny McPhee insisting ""I did knock"" each time she magically appears in a room.The actors all have fun with their parts. Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay) has particular fun as Nanny McPhee. Colin Firth is appropriately bewildered as Mr. Brown who has no control over his children or the women in his life. Angela Lansbury has great fun as nearly blind Aunt Adelaide. Kelly Macdonald is radiant as Evangeline, willing to do anything for Mr. Brown and his family. The child actors are all good. Thomas Sangster is a standout as the troublemaking Simon; but then again, his is the showiest role amongst the children.Highly recommended for family viewing.",5,Fun Family Film,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,2298,"['Cedric', 'Brown', 'just', 'had', 'Nanny', 'quit', 'unruly', 'brood', 'seven', 'children', 'drove', 'screaming', 'out', 'street', 'desperate', 'find', 'replacement', 'scullery', 'maid', 'Evangeline', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'Brown', 'Nanny', 'agency', 'find', 'full-time', 'Nanny', 'However', 'Nanny', 'will', 'work', 'Brown', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'mysterious', 'voice', 'telling', 'hire', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'so', 'when', 'up', 'doorstep', 'only', 'too', 'glad', 'offer', 'employment', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'magical', 'powers', 'children', 'only', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'problems', 'late', 'wife', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'been', 'sending', 'money', 'help', 'support', 'family', 'withhold', 'money', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'quickly', 'Desperate', 'marry', 'unable', 'recognize', 'who', 'truly', 'Brown', 'marry', 'truly', 'obnoxious', 'woman', 'who', 'happiness', 'entire', 'Brown', 'family', 'not', 'worry', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'still', 'magic', 'up', 'sleeve.Nanny', 'McPhee', 'very', 'nice', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'more', 'women', 'men', 'movie', 'cross', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sound', 'Music', 'singing', 'lots', 'magic', 'silly', 'goofy', 'fun', 'adult', 'groaned', 'yet', 'food', 'fight', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'scene', 'lot', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'starting', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'cook', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'coworkers', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'would-be', 'second', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'sight', 'gags', 'especially', 'ones', 'involving', 'animals', 'Adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'running', 'gags', 'such', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'insisting', 'did', 'knock', 'time', 'magically', 'room.The', 'actors', 'have', 'fun', 'parts', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'particular', 'fun', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'appropriately', 'bewildered', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'who', 'control', 'children', 'women', 'life', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'great', 'fun', 'nearly', 'blind', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'radiant', 'Evangeline', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'family', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'standout', 'troublemaking', 'Simon', 'then', 'again', 'showiest', 'role', 'children.Highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A

First of all, let me say that this film had the benefit of a very talented cast, headed by Emma Thompson. But everybody has their chance to shine here. I felt for the all the ""good"" characters, particularly Evangeline. (My sister can tell you that I was earnestly cheering her on!) The children were all pitch perfect. Some of the minor characters, especially the ""bad"" ones, were overdone on purpose to be funnier.Plot: 5 of 5 warts. Something about Nanny McPhee suprised me. The title character is more like the plot catalyst than the focus. But that did not detract a bit from my enjoyment. This movie had a charming way of revealing itself bit by bit, just like Nanny McPhee.Cinematography: 4 of 5 warts. Just look around at some of the surroundings in the movie, and how laden in color they are! Perfect messes (there are plenty), and chipped paint on the walls. It's these kind of little details that make the movie worth a second viewing. Color is often used to convey the mood here, and it works well. Only a slightly cheesy moment, involving a donkey. *wink*Music: 4 of 5 warts.  Nothing that particularly outstands, but nothing that detracts either.Impact: 5 of 5 warts.  This is a movie that will make you laugh, feel, and most importantly, think. Nanny McPhee's working terms are enough to make you consider things in your own life.

981525,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000F1IQNC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Because of its silly packaging and dependency on graphics that appear to dumb down the prospective audience, NANNY McPHEE may not gain the position on the lineup of really good movies before the public right now. But for those who can ignore the packaging, inside is a DVD that is a smart, cleverly written with style and grace by star Emma Thompson (based on the novels Nurse Matilda), directed with aplomb by Kirk Jones, and with a cast of irresistible, irascible children and adults, magical movie that is way over the top in color and slapstick in some places but remains a fluffy delight!The story is simple on the surface: Colin Firth plays Mr. Brown a recently widowed father of seven children whose business (a funeral director) keeps him away from home, resulting in a clan of kids who are as boisterously misbehaved as any children ever encountered. All nannies hired run away in terror at encountering the children: their only constants are the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) and the cook Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton). Brown is under the thumb of Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) who threatens to cut off her necessary financial support unless Brown remarries immediately. In a wonderfully otherworldly manner the name of Nanny McPhee resounds and the grossly unattractive, warty, obese and bucktoothed (only one!) strange nanny appears to assist. She speaks softly and carries a big walking stick, an implement that can bring magical changes when tapped on the floor. She sates she will stay despite the fact the children need her but don't want her and will leave when the children want her but don't need her. The manner in which this gentle and odd nanny affects the changes she demands (going to bed on time, getting up on time, saying please and thank you, etc) works wonders - not only for the children but also for Brown's response to the demands of the aunt.Emma Thompson is wonderful as the ugly but gradually beautified nanny, Colin Firth shines as the father, and the supporting cast of seven superb child actors (Thomas Sangster, Eliza Bennett, Jennifer Rae Daykin, Raphael Coleman, Sam Honywood, Holly Gibbs, and the infant sisters Barnes), Imelda Staunton (`Vera Drake') , Celia Imrie (`Calendar Girls'), Angela Lansbury, and even Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow in small supporting roles make this fairy tale entertaining and instructive! 'Tis a pity the movie sinks to recreation of the old and very tired food fight sequence at the wedding, but after all this is mainly a film for children and as such guarantees belly laughs. It is a lot of fun and has some important lessons for children AND adults, and it makes for a light but delightful evening of sharing.

981526,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B000F1IQNC,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","A sort of &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; story, told on film with a touch of the never never land reality of many movies in recent years, from &#34;Babe&#34; to &#34;The Borrowers&#34;, and of course &#34;A Series Of Unfortunate Events&#34; where it might be the Edwardian Age, or it might not.  Here, Victorian houses have rather nightmarish color schemes of the sort you'd expect in an art student's downtown flat.Seven spoiled rotten children that still manage to be not quite Super Nanny material, have managed to chase away their 17th nanny, making the Banks children seem downright well mannered, and coming close to the Addams brood.  Not knowing what to do, with the Agency refusing to send any others, their over indulgent father hears a voice directing him to Nanny McPhee, who eventually shows up on her own.  She's a rather ugly creature, but just as Baron Von Munchausen gets younger with each adventure, as the children learn each of the 5 lessons she sets out for them (well, one is for Father) she loses a mole here, a blemish there.  Nanny McPhee never shouts, and uses the children's own bad behavior against them, until they get with the program.For the most part, this is a film adults and children can watch, although it rather quickly makes a couple of dips into preciousness, and eventually slides wholesale into downright slapstick, which is wholly unnecessary.  From that point on, the movie is a bit saccharine---it would have been nice if it had a bit more consistency with its start, and less of the goo at the end.  The monumental soundtrack doesn't help, but at this point, criticizing that is like criticizing the music choices in YouTube videos---does every airplane have to have a heavy metal sountrack, and every liner an electronic elegy?Ah well.  If you liked the movies I associated with this film's look, you'll probably like this one.  And if you have children, it's a lot better than a lot of the stuff made for that audience.",4,Darkly Sweet Family Film Sullied By Moments of Preciousness And Slapstick,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1958,"['sort', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'story', 'told', 'film', 'touch', 'never', 'never', 'land', 'reality', 'many', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', '34', 'Babe', '34', '34', 'Borrowers', '34', 'course', '34', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', '34', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'Edwardian', 'Age', 'might', 'not', 'Here', 'Victorian', 'houses', 'have', 'rather', 'nightmarish', 'color', 'schemes', 'sort', ""'d"", 'expect', 'art', 'student', 'downtown', 'flat.Seven', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'children', 'still', 'manage', 'be', 'not', 'quite', 'Super', 'Nanny', 'material', 'have', 'managed', 'chase', 'away', '17th', 'nanny', 'making', 'Banks', 'children', 'seem', 'downright', 'well', 'mannered', 'coming', 'close', 'Addams', 'brood', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'Agency', 'refusing', 'send', 'others', 'indulgent', 'father', 'voice', 'directing', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'own', 'rather', 'ugly', 'creature', 'just', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Munchausen', 'younger', 'adventure', 'children', 'learn', '5', 'lessons', 'out', 'well', 'one', 'Father', 'mole', 'here', 'blemish', 'there', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'never', 'children', 'own', 'bad', 'behavior', 'get', 'program.For', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'adults', 'children', 'can', 'watch', 'rather', 'quickly', 'couple', 'dips', 'preciousness', 'eventually', 'slides', 'wholesale', 'downright', 'slapstick', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'point', 'movie', 'bit', 'saccharine', '-it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'consistency', 'start', 'less', 'goo', 'end', 'monumental', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'help', 'point', 'criticizing', 'criticizing', 'music', 'choices', 'YouTube', 'videos', '-does', 'airplane', 'have', 'have', 'heavy', 'metal', 'sountrack', 'liner', 'electronic', 'elegy', 'Ah', 'well', 'liked', 'movies', 'associated', 'film', 'look', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'have', 'children', 'lot', 'better', 'lot', 'stuff', 'made', 'audience']",N/A

981528,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000F1IQNC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","There's something about a British cast and crew that just seem to add a richness and lend instant prestige to a movie project. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but Nanny McPhee, with its blend of wide-eyed wonder and British sensibilities, resonates within me, much as Mary Poppins did years and years ago. Then there's also the quality name of Emma Thompson, who is one of our finest actors.Widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), who stodgily works at a funeral home, is clueless when it comes to raising his seven  children. This unruly brat pack, ringleadered by Simon (Thomas Sangster, of Love Actually) is clever and very (to the umpteenth power) naughty. They've already notched 17 harried nannies on their belts, the most recent of whom now believes that the bothersome Brown kids are cannibals. What is a despairing father to do? The nanny agency refuses to send him any more help, and now a mysterious, ethereal voice is advicing him that ""what you need is Nanny McPhee,"" whoever she is.One stormy, misbehaved evening, as the kids rampage in the kitchen (with the helpless cook trussed up and despite her written contract that the tykes not be allowed in her workplace), a resounding knock is heard and an ominous silhouette is glimpsed thru the door. Nanny McPhee (an uglified Emma Thompson), when she is admitted to the household, is revealed to be an unwholesome looking nanny, indeed. She is afflicted with gruesome warts, a reddened, tumescent nose, and a snaggletooth that resembles a tombstone. She gravely informs Mr. Brown that she is a government nanny and that her terms consist of imparting 5 lessons and that she requires her Sundays off. A bewildered but relieved Mr Brown is all too happy to let her toil away.The seven baffled but rebellious children are combative at first, but they very quickly learn not to trifle with Nanny McPhee, who goes around with a dauntingly crooked walking stick and seems to be able to work magical wonders. Soon, the kids are behaving up to the Victorian England standards of civility and decorum. And, with every lesson taught, another gross feature on Nanny McPhee's face vanishes, which can't possibly be some kind of metaphor at all, could it?With the domestic issues seemingly resolved, outside forces now threaten the Brown clan. It turns out Mr. Brown has been having trouble making ends meet and has been providing for his household largely via the allowance meted out by Lady Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). But now the stuffy and proper Aunt Adelaide has demanded that one of the girls be given over to her care and that Mr. Brown be wed within the month, lest his allowance be withheld permanently. A frantic Mr. Brown begins to go over his list of eligible female acquaintances and comes upon a very bad choice: the intolerably mean, despicable, and probably color blind Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie). The children are appalled, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) - the yearning and lovely scullery maid - is appalled, even Mr. Brown hinmself is appalled. But, no worries; with some ambiguous advice from Nanny McPhee and some ingeniuty by the Brown kids, it'll probably work out all right.Nanny McPhee is an enchanting family film, as could only be realized by a stable of British actors and film crew. The vibrant, eye-popping, color-splashed set designs and costumes are very nicely used to help bring this child's fable to the big screen. Comparisons with Mary Poppins are inevitable, as her persona is similarly aloof, notwithstanding her magical tendencies. Like Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee is based on a book - in this case, based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books. Emma Thompson herself adapted these books into the working screenplay.Emma Thompson, as the calm pulse of the show, anchors the movie with her reserved yet compassionate portrayal of Nanny McPhee. Her character's occasional grunts often is a nonverbal commentary on someone's foolhardy behavior. The kids, especially, act out their roles with zest and some skill (Thomas Sangster, I do believe, is going places), while Angela Lansbury hams it up as the prickly aunt. And what can I say about Colin Firth, other than I'm a fan of his? He's quite good as the befuddled and beleaguered Cedric Brown. Director Kirk Jones helms the picture with an energetic, nicely-paced, kid-friendly hand.The stuffed special features include:  2 film commentaries, one with Director Kirk Jones and the cast of kids, the other with Producer Lindsey Doran & Emma Thompson; a ""Casting the Children"" featurette; ""Village Life,"" a featurette about the set designs; a Nanny McPhee Makeover, where you see Emma Thompson transform into the bewarted nanny; seven deleted scenes, including an alternate opening; an unfunny gag reel; and ""How Nanny McPhee Came to Be,"" a featurette about Christianna Brand and Edward Ardizzone, the writer and illustrator of the Nursa Matilda books.What else is there to say? Nanny McPhee follows in the tradition of The Wizard of Oz, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins. I'm pretty sure that's what the powers that be were aiming for, in crafting this film (and also to make some cash). Years from now, kids will be watching this magical film with delight. Not a bad legacy, that.",4,"""I did knock.""",1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,5228,"['something', 'British', 'cast', 'crew', 'just', 'seem', 'add', 'richness', 'lend', 'instant', 'prestige', 'movie',

After watching this with my kids I felt bad for thinking so negatively about it. The kids really love it especially my daughter. The only things that the movies really have in common are that they are both set in England and deal with nannies.The feel of the picture is very child-friendly as characters are brightly coloured and comically exaggerated (such as Nanny McPhee's facial features) and while the humour is a little basic, there is enough slapstick of the ""Mousetrap"" variety in there to keep most people happy. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the ugly but gradually beautified nanny, Colin Firth shines as the father, and the supporting cast of seven fantastic child actors (Thomas Sangster, Eliza Bennett, Jennifer Rae Daykin, Raphael Coleman, Sam Honywood, Holly Gibbs, and the infant sisters Barnes), Imelda Stanuton ('Vera Drake'), Celia Imrie ('Calendar Girls'), Angela Lansbury, and even Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow in small supporting roles make this fairy tale entertaining and informative.I thought the screenplay was well put together, and again Emma did a great job not only writing it but also acting. Although most viewers will figure out the ending early on, it's not so obvious how the story is going to get there. There are several interesting surprises and twists along the way, and as presented in the movie, the storyline exercises enough ""poetic license"" to allow disagreement over what the story is saying about life and love. Good camera work, good sets, and very well crafted.If you like well produced, ""feel good"", ""fairy tale"", type movies, you should be pleased with this one.

How can I rate the propaganda of ""Unthinkable"" with the quietly moral and charming values of ""Nanny McPhee""? Worse, how dare I? Pointedly, ""Nanny McPhee"" is one of those movies you want to buy to have on hand for company in case they feel like a good old-fashioned, happily-ever-after story. Truly, if there is really a happy ending, this film provides it.Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) is this most unattractive woman who works as a nanny. Admittedly, I missed the first 20 minutes and don't know why her face is rife with warts and one protruding tooth and one long eyebrow and somewhat amorphous body. Why she looks this way and then another way by the end of the story is a magical occurrence I cannot explain (because I missed the beginning). I can assert that she administers discipline with a calm voice and stalwart presence. Each of the rules she successfully teaches results in the disappearance of a facial wart or other.Basically, the story line is simple: Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) loses his wife (she dies). They have seven children, his job does not make enough money to support his vigorous brood, and his wife's old maid aunt (Angela Lansbury) supports the family in jolly ol' Victorian England. She orders him to marry by the end of the month so that his children will have a mother (never mind what kind he might get). The only handy one--in his class--it is Victorian England--is a widow. But, yikes, this woman is long in the tooth and randy to boot.Of course, there's the sweet, young thing, the scullery maid--not of his class--who becomes the adopted daughter of this aunt--you know, to lessen the brood count at Mr. Brown's house. Is it OK to take a child (actually, she is an adult, but the aunt has terrible eyesight)? Yes, if you're rich enough, and two, if it is Victorian England. If Mr. Brown doesn't marry, his children could end up in the workhouse like Dickens characters of the same time period.All the while Nanny McPhee ""arranges"" things, but cannot force things. The most clever part in Emma Thompson's script is allowing the children freedom to find within themselves the resources to mend their own lives.It's a lovely story, filled with life, love, and laughter--and troubles, problem-solving, cues, and miscues, but, best of all, learning to take responsibility and accept people based on their character, not their looks.",5,"Yes, a most excellent film!",1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2410,"['Sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'have', 'talk', 'How', 'can', 'rate', 'propaganda', 'Unthinkable', 'quietly', 'moral', 'charming', 'values', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Worse', 'how', 'dare', 'Pointedly', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'one', 'movies', 'want', 'buy', 'have', 'hand', 'company', 'case', 'feel', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'happily-ever-after', 'story', 'Truly', 'really', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'it.Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'most', 'unattractive', 'woman', 'who', 'nanny', 'Admittedly', 'missed', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'face', 'rife', 'warts', 'one', 'protruding', 'tooth', 'one', 'long', 'eyebrow', 'somewhat', 'amorphous', 'body', 'Why', 'way', 'then', 'way', 'end', 'story', 'magical', 'occurrence', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'missed', 'beginning', 'can', 'assert', 'discipline', 'calm', 'voice', 'stalwart', 'presence', 'rules', 'successfully', 'results', 'disappearance', 'facial', 'wart', 'other.Basically', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'wife', 'have', 'seven', 'children', 'job', 'not', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'vigorous', 'brood', 'wife', 'old', 'maid', 'aunt', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'family', 'jolly', 'ol', 'Victorian', 'England', 'orders', 'marry', 'end', 'month', 'so', 'children', 'will', 'have', 'mother', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'kind', 'might', 'get', 'only', 'handy', 'one', 'class', 'Victorian', 'England', 'widow', 'yikes', 'woman', 'long', 'tooth', 'randy', 'boot.Of', 'course', 'sweet', 'young', 'thing', 'scullery', 'maid', 'not', 'class', 'who', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'aunt', 'know', 'lessen', 'brood', 'count', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'house', 'OK', 'take', 'child', 'actually', 'adult', 'aunt', 'terrible', 'eyesight', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'rich', 'enough', 'two', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Mr.', 'Brown', ""n't"", 'marry', 'children', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'workhouse', 'Dickens', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'while', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'arranges', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'force', 'things', 'most', 'clever', 'part', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'script', 'allowing', 'children', 'freedom', 'find', 'resources', 'mend', 'own', 'lives.It', 'lovely', 'story', 'filled', 'life', 'love', 'laughter', 'troubles', 'problem-solving', 'cues', 'miscues', 'best', 'learning', 'take', 'responsibility', 'accept', 'people', 'based', 'character', 'not', 'looks']",N/A

When you want me and no longer need me, then I have to go.""  She teaches the children to say please and thank you, to go to bed, wake up, and get dressed when their told, to listen, and to love.A bit of a fairy tale, the magic interspersed throughout Nanny McPhee made it charming and cute.  It's not a new tale to have boisterous children in need of control brought to heel by a firm nanny, but the magical elements and transformation of Nanny McPhee from a witchlike hag to a beautiful governess add an unexpected twist.

981554,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000F1IQNC,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 5]","NANNY MCPHEE is Colin Firth's and Emma Thompson's misfired attempt to bring MARY POPPINS into the 21st Century. Without mincing words, it doesn't work.Firth, an Undertaker (how cheery for children!) who is under pressure to remarry in order to claim a much-needed inheritance, is the recently widowered parent of seven motherless children, a la THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  They are under the common impression that Nannies are cruel and foolish and stepmothers are all evil, and are dedicated to driving away every Nanny and would-be stepmother in the world. They have a soft spot for the housemaid Evangeline who eventually becomes their father's love interest.At first, their pranks make them endearing, as when they fool their latest Nanny into thinking they've eaten their baby sister, but the film doesn't progress very far before they become simply and unbearably rude and obnoxious in a way and to a degree that middle class English children of the Victorian Age would never have been. Fifty years after MARY POPPINS we've apparently forgotten what the values of that era were.Enter Nanny McPhee (Thompson), a frightening wart-nosed, snaggle-toothed magic Nanny, essentially Mary Poppins' ""black swan."" Where Poppins is stern, McPhee is mean; where Poppins is mysterious, McPhee is scary; where Poppins is kindly yet firm, McPhee is commanding and domineering. The children listen to Mary Poppins because they come to respect and to love her. The children listen to McPhee because they come to respect and to fear her.Even though Nanny McPhee's ugliness recedes as the children's behavior improves, the film, in adopting a pragmatic approach to the use of lies, has odd ethics and a curious lack of heart. That lack of heart guarantees that NANNY MCPHEE will never become a classic.MARY POPPINS was the first movie my mother ever took me to see back in 1964, and I happily remembered so much of it. NANNY MCPHEE would have had me cowering under my seat, scared to go to sleep at night.

981556,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F1IQNC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","Nanny McPhee reminds me of Mary Poppins, although for every similarity, such as explaining when she will leave as soon as she shows up, there is a difference, her medicine tends to move about on the spoon and does not taste like anything good.  However, Nanny McPhee, who is passed on the Nurse Matilda stories of Christianna Brand, is more reminiscent of the Mary Poppins of P.L. Travers books than of the beloved Disney film, which is a reminder that in Great Britain children's books are not quite as cheerful as their American counterparts.  After all, when we talk about the first generation of children in English literature we are talking about Oliver Twist and the other poor souls depicted by Dickens.  Nanny McPhee certainly looks like she could come from a Dickens novel, perhaps the woman who stole the curtains from Ebenezer Scrooge's bed before the corpse was cold.The story begins with an empty chair because the mother of seven Brown children has died.  Their father, Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), does makeup for dearly departed at the Funeral home of Mr. Wheen (Derek Jacobi) and Mr. Jowls (Patrick Barlow), which does not provide enough for him to feed his entire family.  Fortunately there is money provided by his wife's Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), but she insists that he get married if he wants the practice to continue.  Meanwhile, the daily problem is finding a nanny for his children, who take great pleasure in driving off every single one of the nannies hired to take care of them and keeping statistics on their accomplishments.  This leaves Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) the scullery maid and Mrs. Blatherwick (Imedla Staunton) the cook to try and carry on despite the children running absolutely wild.  But they have run out of nannies at the local nanny office.  Fortunately, whispered voices and newspaper advertisements assure Mr. Brown ""What you need is Nanny McPhee.""The next thing we know, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson, who once again doubles as screenwriter, having adapted the original stories), is at the door.  She finds the children running rampant in the kitchen and explains two things.  The first is that she will stay as long as she is needed but not wanted, but when she is wanted but no longer needed she will leave.  The second is that it is time for them to go to bed.  Led by Simon (Thomas Sangster), the oldest, the children decide that what they should do is stay up all night.  Then Nanny McPhee ominously raises her gnarled cane and slams it on the floor, setting out a wave of magic.  Suffice it to say, the Brown children are soon persuaded that made they should do what Nanny McPhee says, even if it means forcing themselves to say ""please.""We also learn that there are five lessons that Nanny McPhee intends to teach these children and the chief charm of this story is that her primary tool of persuasion is not her magic, but double insistence that the children live with the consequences of their actions and that they think of ways to solve their own problems.  One of the interesting aspects of this story is that every time the children learn a new lesson, one of Nanny McPhee's warts disappears and she seems to be turning into, well, Emma Thompson.  Meanwhile, Aunt Adelaide thinks it would be best if she raised one of the Brown children as her own and Mr. Brown is trying to summon the nerve, if not the stomach, to propose to Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie).Of course Nanny McPhee will set things to right in the end, but not without some help from the Brown children themselves.  The ending smacks of nanny ex machina, but that is to be expected in such a tale, which is target squarely on the little folk.  This is not a film where adults have to figure out the larger allegory meaning of the story or laugh at in-jokes that are over the heads of their children.  Still, I think older viewers will be more moved by the ending where there is certainly something to be said for how Nanny McPhee dresses a bride for her wedding.",4,Nanny McPhee is here to save the Brown family from themselves,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,3992,"['Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'similarity', 'such', 'explaining', 'when', 'will', 'leave', 'as', 'soon', 'up', 'difference', 'medicine', 'tends', 'move', 'about', 'spoon', 'not', 'taste', 'anything', 'good', 'However', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'who', 'passed', 'Nurse', 'Matilda', 'stories', 'Christianna', 'Brand', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'books', 'beloved', 'Disney', 'film', 'reminder', 'Great', 'Britain', 'children', 'books', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'cheerful', 'American', 'counterparts', 'when', 'talk', 'first', 'generation', 'children', 'English', 'literature', 'are', 'talking', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'other', 'poor', 'souls', 'depicted', 'Dickens', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'certainly', 'could', 'come', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'woman', 'who', 'stole', 'curtains', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'bed', 'corpse', 'was', 'cold.The', 'story', 'empty', 'chair', 'mother', 'seven', 'Brown', 'children', 'died', 'father', 'Cedric', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'makeup', 'dearly', 'departed', 'Funeral', 'home', 'Mr.', 'Wheen', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Mr.', 'Jowls', 'Patrick', 'Barlow', 'not', 'provide', 'enough', 'feed', 'entire', 'family', 'Fortunately', 'money', 'provided', 'wife', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'get', 'married', 'practice', 'continue', 'Meanwhile', 'daily', 'problem', 'finding', 'nanny', 'children', 'who', 'take', 'great', 'pleasure', 'driving', 'off', 'single', 'one', 'nannies', 'hired', 'take', 'care', 'keeping', 'statistics', 'accomplishments', 'Evangeline', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'scullery', 'maid', 'Mrs.', 'Blatherwick', 'Imedla', 'Staunton', 'cook', 'try', 'carry', 'children', 'running', 'absolutely', 'wild', 'have', 'run', 'nannies', 'local', 'nanny', 'office', 'Fortunately', 'whispered', 'voices', 'newspaper', 'advertisements', 'assure', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'What', 'need', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'doubles', 'screenwriter', 'having', 'adapted', 'original', 'stories', 'door', 'children', 'running', 'rampant', 'kitchen', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'will', 'stay', 'as', 'long', 'needed', 'not', 'wanted', 'when', 'wanted', 'longer', 'needed', 'will', 'leave', 'second', 'time', 'go', 'bed', 'Led', 'Simon', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'oldest', 'children', 'decide', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'stay', 'night', 'Then', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'ominously', 'gnarled', 'cane', 'floor', 'setting', 'out', 'wave', 'magic', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Brown', 'children', 'are', 'soon', 'persuaded', 'made', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'even', 'forcing', 'say', 'please', 'also', 'learn', 'are', 'five', 'lessons', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'teach', 'children', 'chief', 'charm', 'story', 'primary', 'tool', 'persuasion', 'not', 'magic', 'double', 'insistence', 'children', 'live', 'consequences', 'actions', 'think', 'ways', 'solve', 'own', 'problems', 'One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'story', 'time', 'children', 'learn', 'new', 'lesson', 'one', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'warts', 'disappears', 'be', 'turning', 'well', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Meanwhile', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'raised', 'one', 'Brown', 'children', 'own', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'trying', 'summon', 'nerve', 'not', 'stomach', 'propose', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'Celia', 'Imrie', '.Of', 'course', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'will', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'end', 'not', 'help', 'Brown', 'children', 'ending', 'smacks', 'nanny', 'ex', 'machina', 'be', 'expected', 'such', 'tale', 'target', 'squarely', 'little', 'folk', 'not', 'film', 'where', 'adults', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'larger', 'allegory', 'meaning', 'story', 'laugh', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'heads', 'children', 'Still', 'think', 'older', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'moved', 'ending', 'where', 'certainly', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'how', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'bride', 'wedding']",N/A

It has everything that makes it charming for children, with just enough ""spice"" and literary depth so that adults can enjoy it, too.It is kind of quirky and sometimes a little scary feeling, but not intensely so.  I have 7 and 5 year old granddaughters who enjoyed it without having trouble sleeping afterwards.  It has humor, spookiness, sadness, romance, symbolism, and fantasy all rolled into one.  The ending will positively give you goosebumps!Since there has been so many reviews that compare this movie to Mary Poppins, I cannot resist the temptation to add my 2 cents worth.  Even as a child, I didn't care for Mary Poppins.  I know that a lot of people love it and it is a classic, but in my opinion is is just TOO syrupy sweet.  Nanny McPhee just doesn't come off as one dimensionally sugary, and is genuinely interesting to me.  There are some similarities in the message, but in Mary Poppins, the children are simply perfect and misunderstood while the parents are neglectful and need to be taught a lesson.  In Nanny McPhee, everyone has lessons to learn, and the children are depicted with as much to be corrected as the parent.  The result is a story that is so much more interesting and has a more truthful ring than Mary Poppins.I especially liked how Nanny McPhee's physical appearance functions much like a mirror to the people she is helping.  When she arrives, she is hideous - because THEY are hideous, but as the hearts of the family expand and grow, her appearance alters to reflect that.  By the end of the movie, Nanny McPhee is as beautiful as the family has become.  Love It!  It reminded me of the Bible verse that says, ""All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.""  (Hebrews 12:11)  Very insightful message in my opinion.  I also thought it was interesting that not EVERYONE in this story is helped to be a ""better person"" - some of the characters are genuinely blind, greedy and evil.  The characters remain so until the bitter end and nothing can help them.  Nanny McPhee is sent only to people who have hearts that are able to change.  There has been some discussion among religious people over whether ""Nanny"" is a devil, but I think she is an angel.  Even God Himself can look ominous to people who are in a degraded state, and I have no problem with how she appears at first.

From reading bits of the plot here and there from other film critics, I thought it was going to be a light charming spoof on The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins: The kind but firm nanny comes to the rich widower's house and sorts out his unruly children.Sadly, that's not what works here though. Nanny McPhee says she is going to teach them five lessons of their choice. What makes the film slip into sheer stupidity and pointlessness is that in the first half McPhee gets them to behave, say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" etc.) But towards the end when their father is about to get married to a woman they don't like, they conspire to sabotage the wedding and she NODS IN APPROVAL!!! She seemed so bent on taming the children' unruly spirits SO WHY THE HECK DID SHE SUDDENLY DESTROY ALL HER EFFORTS IN THE BATTING OF AN EYELASH? It was never explained why she changed her tune. Then after the bride runs off from a cake fight, she arranges for the father to marry one of his servant girls. They both immediately profess their love for each other AND WE NEVER EVEN SAW ANY FORESHADOWING BEFOREHAND OF WHAT WAS TO COME! They only exchanged maybe five words together, there are no hints dropped that possibly allude their `unspoken love' and all of a sudden at the end they love each other!!!Was this supposed to be a fairy tale? A parody? Or a slapstick comedy? Kirk Jones did not seem to be able to make up his mind. If it was meant to be corn then so be it (I personally don't mind a little corniness every now and then--I DID give Enchanted five stars) but this just feels corny in all the wrong ways.Every prop, costume and set is horribly fake. Glaring, vivid, plastic colors like Oriental Trade products. Sometimes the kids wear period clothes and other times (like the scene at the beach) they seem to be wearing modern dress. What time period is it? Jones did not seem to be able to make up his mind about that either. The walls of the house have splashy tye dye, graffiti ""Woodstock Festival"" colors. The `stepmother's' house is especially hideous.Angela Lansbury and Imelda Staunton are extremely corny as the aunt and cook and make the Three Stooges look like Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison. Celia Irmie walks through the movie with these clownish outfits (and wig) and a ""Look at me! I'm a big movie star with movie star looks!"" air about her that makes me want to yank her hair. When she goes to her fiance's house for a visit and encounters prank after prank, (tarantula in the hair, worms in the oederves, a blob of jello about to drop on her head) the father repeatedly stops the tricks but OF COURSE she does not notice them even when it is SO OBVIOUS and IN HER FACE.The only performances that go unscathed by the ridiculousness of this farce are Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell as Nanny McPhee and the father. They sincerely personify their roles and manage to hold straight faces and act like normal people which actually makes the irritating brain-dead-ness of Lansubry, Staunton and Irmie stand out even more.The only redeeming value I can think of in Nanny McPhee is that at least it didn't exceed two hours.

But here, they don't.Strange-looking Nanny McPhee has to teach the kids to be good and get the hero married before the nasty Aunt Adelaide cuts off the family allowance, and--what was that?  Before the allowance is cut off?I'm amazed that this movie has done so well. In America, land of the self-made person, you'd think a goal of getting someone else to pay for your way of life would be, at the least, unappealing.  Even in Victorian times, you didn't HAVE to produce 7 children you couldn't feed. And then, maybe if Brown (Colin Firth's character) had fewer children, or a smaller house, or did away with one or two of the household staff, his salary at the morgue would have been sufficient. (He works at the morgue. Ha. Ha.)Since the powerful and good Nanny is so strange-looking, I thought this might be a movie about inner beauty, but no. As the children learn Nanny's 5 lessons, she gets less ugly, until at the end she is lovely Emma Thompson. This reflects their inner change, or maybe it just means that ugly is bad, after all.There are some great things about this film, such as the surreal sets which tell us not to take anything seriously, or the normally lovely and classy Celia Imrie as a vulgar strumpet.  (Just as there's no person as horrid as a good one gone bad, there's somehow no better ""bad girl"" than a naturally classy one.)The ultimate change in Mary Poppins--despite her magical powers-- occurred when Mr. Banks himself realized he had to prioritize his family. Colin Firth never has any kind of personality change, and any change that happens comes from someone else doing a rescue: Nanny McPhee, Aunt Adelaide, or the oldest son.

Mr. Brown, who has received financial assistance from the children's' aging Aunt Adelaide (the very talented Angela Lansbury), informs Mr. Brown that she will cut-off the assistance if he doesn't wed within a month.  Having unsuccessfully attempted to find a nanny able to deal with his seven children, the mysterious & unattractive Nanny McPhee arrives at his door one day to take on the responsibility.  While facing strong initial opposition from the children in the form of pranks, Nanny McPhee begins to take hold of the dysfunctional family while Mr. Brown attempts to woo the bizarre widow Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie).  As the children begin to warm to Nanny McPhee, they do not want their father to marry Mrs. Quickly; and Aunt Adelaide doesn't help matters when she decides to remove one of his children to raise herself.  Aunt Adelaide is unwittingly outsmarted by the children when their scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) pretends to be one of the children and is adopted by Aunt Adelaide.Does Mr. Brown marry the hideous Mrs. Quickly?  Why does Nanny McPhee begin to become more attractive over time?  Will the children ever see the very kind Evangeline ever again?  The answers to these questions can be found by watching this enchantingly engaging film.  Though reminiscent of the famous 1964 classic ""Mary Poppins"", ""Nanny McPhee"" is quite unique and stands on its own as a wonderful film thanks to the talented screen writing capabilities of Emma Thompson, who wrote the screenplay based upon the book by Christianna Brand (1907-1988), and the wonderful direction of Kirk Jones.  Equally engaging were the elaborate & colorful costumes used in the film, as well as the imaginative sets and crisp cinematography.  Overall, I rate ""Nanny McPhee"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.  Emma Thompson is reprising her role of Professor Trelawney in the 2007 film ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".",5,"""When you need me, but do not want me, then I will stay...""",1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2448,"['When', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'then', 'have', 'go', 'lines', 'quoted', '2005', 'film', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'exquisitely', 'summarize', 'core', 'plot', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'played', 'Oscar-award-winning', 'actress', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'portrayed', 'character', 'Professor', 'Trelawney', '2004', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'home', 'widower', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'also', 'father', 'seven', 'rowdy', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'who', 'received', 'financial', 'assistance', 'children', 'aging', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'very', 'talented', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'will', 'cut-off', 'assistance', ""n't"", 'wed', 'month', 'Having', 'unsuccessfully', 'attempted', 'find', 'nanny', 'able', 'deal', 'seven', 'children', 'mysterious', 'unattractive', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'door', 'one', 'day', 'take', 'responsibility', 'facing', 'strong', 'initial', 'opposition', 'children', 'form', 'pranks', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'take', 'hold', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'woo', 'bizarre', 'widow', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'children', 'begin', 'warm', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'father', 'marry', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'when', 'remove', 'one', 'children', 'raise', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide', 'unwittingly', 'outsmarted', 'children', 'when', 'scullery', 'maid', 'Evangeline', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'be', 'one', 'children', 'adopted', 'Aunt', 'Adelaide.Does', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'marry', 'hideous', 'Mrs.', 'Quickly', 'Why', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'begin', 'become', 'more', 'attractive', 'time', 'Will', 'children', 'ever', 'see', 'very', 'kind', 'Evangeline', 'ever', 'again', 'answers', 'questions', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'watching', 'enchantingly', 'engaging', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'famous', '1964', 'classic', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'quite', 'unique', 'own', 'wonderful', 'film', 'thanks', 'talented', 'screen', 'writing', 'capabilities', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'book', 'Christianna', 'Brand', '1907-1988', 'wonderful', 'direction', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'Equally', 'engaging', 'were', 'elaborate', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'used', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'imaginative', 'sets', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'Overall', 'rate', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'reprising', 'role', 'Professor', 'Trelawney', '2007', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix']",N/A

The children are out of control and drive away numerous nannies until Nanny McPhee shows up and gets the unruly children to comply to her wishes.

When you want me and no longer need me, then I must go.""  -This reminds me of something I've read about anger/hatred -that when you hate something/someone it will stay, only after you can love it will it go.

981606,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000F1IQNC,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 24]","Except for the fact that the characters don`t break out into song at regular intervals, ""Nanny McPhee"" is a weird hybrid made up of equal parts ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" (hereafter to be referred to as MP and TSOM), with an uglied-up Emma Thompson replacing the anything-but-ugly Julie Andrews in the lead role.Miss McPhee is a British nanny with magical powers who arrives unannounced at the doorstep of one Mr. Brown (MP), a widower with seven unruly children (TSOM) who, due to business and financial pressures (MP) and grief over his wife`s death (TSOM), has been rather neglectful of his progeny of late (both MP and TSOM).  The children have successfully driven away all the town's employable nannies with their precocity and unruly behavior (MP and TSOM), but could they have finally met their match in the mysterious Nanny McPhee?  There's also a subplot about Brown bringing home an odious woman to be a new mother to the children and their attempts to sabotage the effort that has ""The Sound of Music"" written all over it.  And the final scene is such an unabashed and shameless rip-off of the closing moments (albeit sans umbrellas and kites) of ""Mary Poppins"" that I can't believe there aren't grounds for a copyright-infringement lawsuit here.Since ""Nanny McPhee"" has stolen virtually every one of its plot points from those two previously mentioned classics, it's hard not to weigh this film against the originals and to find ""Nanny McPhee"" wanting in every respect.  This is a drab, cheerless film filled with overdrawn caricatures and unappealing visuals.  Nanny McPhee, replete with uni-brow, hairy warts and a prominent buck tooth, is herself so physically repulsive that she is liable to give impressionable youngsters nightmares for months afterwards.  And buried under all that restrictive and distracting makeup, Emma Thompson can't even begin to deliver anything like a full-bodied, well-rounded performance.  Of course, since she herself wrote the screenplay (based on the books by Christianna Brand), she probably has no one to blame but herself for her predicament.  Pity, instead, poor Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, fine performers who seem to be marking time waiting for some better roles to come along.My big question when it comes to ""Nanny McPhee"" is why settle for this cheap knock-off when the originals are readily available and so much better?",2,Where is Julie Andrews when you really need her?,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2395,"['fact', 'characters', 'don', 't', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'regular', 'intervals', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'weird', 'hybrid', 'made', 'equal', 'parts', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sound', 'Music', 'hereafter', 'be', 'referred', 'MP', 'TSOM', 'uglied-up', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'replacing', 'anything-but-ugly', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'lead', 'role.Miss', 'McPhee', 'British', 'nanny', 'magical', 'powers', 'who', 'unannounced', 'doorstep', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'MP', 'widower', 'seven', 'unruly', 'children', 'TSOM', 'who', 'due', 'business', 'financial', 'pressures', 'MP', 'grief', 'wife', 's', 'death', 'TSOM', 'been', 'rather', 'neglectful', 'progeny', 'late', 'MP', 'TSOM', 'children', 'have', 'successfully', 'driven', 'away', 'town', 'employable', 'nannies', 'precocity', 'unruly', 'behavior', 'MP', 'TSOM', 'could', 'have', 'finally', 'met', 'match', 'mysterious', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'also', 'subplot', 'Brown', 'bringing', 'home', 'odious', 'woman', 'be', 'new', 'mother', 'children', 'attempts', 'sabotage', 'effort', 'Sound', 'Music', 'written', 'final', 'scene', 'such', 'unabashed', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'closing', 'moments', 'sans', 'umbrellas', 'kites', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'grounds', 'copyright-infringement', 'lawsuit', 'here.Since', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'stolen', 'virtually', 'one', 'plot', 'points', 'two', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'classics', 'hard', 'not', 'weigh', 'film', 'originals', 'find', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'wanting', 'respect', 'drab', 'cheerless', 'film', 'filled', 'overdrawn', 'caricatures', 'unappealing', 'visuals', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'replete', 'uni-brow', 'hairy', 'warts', 'prominent', 'buck', 'tooth', 'so', 'physically', 'repulsive', 'liable', 'give', 'impressionable', 'youngsters', 'nightmares', 'months', 'afterwards', 'buried', 'restrictive', 'distracting', 'makeup', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'deliver', 'anything', 'full-bodied', 'well-rounded', 'performance', 'course', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'books', 'Christianna', 'Brand', 'probably', 'one', 'blame', 'predicament', 'Pity', 'instead', 'poor', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'fine', 'performers', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'marking', 'time', 'waiting', 'better', 'roles', 'come', 'along.My', 'big', 'question', 'when', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'why', 'settle', 'cheap', 'knock-off', 'when', 'originals', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

The idea of reflecting the children's behaviour on the nanny's face is certainly not from Poppins. In that way, the children could see the result of their own making without being too self-conscious. Nanny McPhee didn't try to sweeten the bitter medicine, but she made them see how to accept consequences and be creative about it.I have not read Nurse Matilda but I like the movie because the magic was very beautiful.

I don't think they were truly bad, I think they were grief stricken and trying the best way they knew how to get their father to really see them and be there for them, which he wouldn't.

Her siblings put her in danger in the kitchen and even more so during the ""lesson."" In the bonus features, Thompson said they originally showed the ""baby"" IN the boiling soup pot, but thought better of it. I should hope so! Additionally, it never showed the baby being cared for. Nanny came to the children in the morning, paying no attention to the baby, and a few minutes later, after the onset of the ""lesson,"" turned and walked away, leaving the baby in the crib all day as well, without even looking at her, let alone changing and feeding her.Additionally the baby was ""lessonized.""

Even if you don't have kids, this film should help bring back memories of all of the great children's books you read and loved.Cedric Brown (Colin Firth, ""Love Actually""), the hapless father of seven children and a recent widower finds his family falling apart. Unable to spend much time at home, he works long hours trying to keep his funeral parlor afloat, leaving the children in the care of nannies, a scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly McDonald, ""Love Actually"") and a cook (Imelda Staunton, ""Vera Drake""). The children, lead by Simon (Thomas Sangster, ""Love Actually""), are an unruly bunch and take great pride in their ability in scaring all of the nannies away. They realize they have set a new record. It only took 3 hours and 14 minutes to get rid of Nanny #17. Distraught, Cedric finds that the Village Nanny agency will no longer help him. Then, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson), a snaggle-toothed, overweight woman with two moles on her face, shows up at the door. She immediately begins to teach the children how to behave, using a mixture of magic, common-sense and insight. Soon, Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) arrives and insists that Cedric marry again, or she will no longer provide support to the family. It is up to the children and Nanny McPhee to make things right.Emma Thompson has proven she has a great deal of skill writing screenplays. First, the adaptation of ""Sense and Sensibility"" and now ""Nanny McPhee"". Blending the best elements and ideas from successful family films, without a huge amount of treacle or gaggles of children running wild, Thompson has created a delightful story sure to appeal to young and old. Parents should run to the closest theater playing this film, with or without their children, steering clear of films like ""Cheaper by the Dozen"". Set in an indeterminate time, I am going to guess the early 1900s, due to the lack of telephones, televisions and radios, and the clothing; the film is set in a sleepy country village in England. The family home, a rambling Victorian with many gables, has seen better days, is filled with bright colors peeling in many places, mismatched furniture and toys, is very messy, but it feels like home. The time and place add immeasurably to the fanciful nature of the film and help to transport us to this fantasy world.Emma Thompson is also very good as the mysterious Nanny McPhee. Comparisons to ""Mary Poppins"" will be inevitable, but Thompson makes this character slightly unique by adding humor to the role. She is magical and pops up to address other characters with no notice, driving poor Mr. Brown (Firth) a little batty. Startling him, she always apologizes by saying ""I did knock"", which soon becomes a funny joke. She is also stern, but not mean, and unwilling to put up with any of the children's shenanigans. Of course, she is there to teach the children how to behave, they are an extremely unruly group, and she does this with a mixture of insight, kindness and tough love. When the children claim to have the measles, she soon serves them a viscous ""Measles Medicine"" which is sure to cure them of playing sick in the future. Early on, she announces to Mr. Brown that she has five lessons to teach the children, if they should learn more that is up to them. Clearly, they learn a lot more.Colin Firth is equally amusing as the battle weary father. He is funny at times, but his role is more the romantic, as he has to find a woman to marry, to ensure that they continue to receive Aunt Adelaide's money. Initially, he decides upon Selma Quickly (Celia Imrie), the widow of one of his clients, and is prepared to go through with the marriage to this hideous woman, until the children come to the rescue. Colin Firth has long played the dashing romantic lead and this persona works well here. When he finds the situation slipping out of his control, his haggard nature is funnier because Firth is usually a romantic lead. To watch this dashing figure deal with a gaggle of unruly children, yet also pine for his lost wife, Firth is extremely effective making us feel for his character.Kelly McDonald is also quite good as Evangeline, the young woman who works for the family, but also cares for the children and cares for Mr. Brown as well. Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton and Angela Lansbury round out the cast of amusing characters.Of the children, the most notable is Simon, played by Thomas Sangster (Liam Neeson's son in ""Love Actually""). He is quite good at leading the unruly children into mischief. He also, ultimately, becomes the one who will make the choice to make everything right again.""Nanny McPhee"" is like watching a great children's book come to life. The time, setting and feel of everything in the film help to make the magical elements believable and this helps to make everything more enjoyable and interesting. The story is predictable, you will probably be able to guess the final outcome, but ""Nanny"" takes us on an unpredictable journey to this conclusion.The children in ""Nanny"" are as destructive as the kids in ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", and other films of that nature, but these children learn real lessons, and help make real changes in their life. It seems more real, which given the fantasy elements of the film, is remarkable. Everything in ""Cheaper"" is just so phony and unnatural it resembles a big cartoon and any lessons those children might learn seem superficial. Nanny McPhee teaches them real lessons, lessons they will need in life, lessons that will make a difference in their life.When Nanny McPhee first meets Mr. Brown and the children, she tells them ""When you need me, but do not want me, then I will stay. When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go"". Well, Nanny McPhee, we need you. We need you. Don't go. Tell us more stories. Save our children from endless hours of dreck and mindless pabulum. Save them from the inevitable ""Cheaper by the Dozen 3"" and ""Yours, Mine and Ours 2"".",5,"Thompson's ""Nanny"" Has The Right Medicine",1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,6251,"['When', 'need', 'do',

981628,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F1IQNC,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Stellar British actors are gathered for the production of `Nanny McPhee,' British family picture, which includes Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Kelly McDonald, Imelda Staunton, Derek Jacobi, and Angela Lansbury. The director is Kirk Jones, who did a wicked comedy `Waking Ned Divine' back in 1998, set in a small Irish village where small lies beget another bigger lies. In 'Nanny McPhee' it is small magic by the newly arrived governess in black that rehabilitate the troubled relations between the kids and their father. But this happens only after several `close calls' that provide us with darkly funny moments.For `Nanny McPhee' Emma Thompson wrote the script based on the children's book by Christina Brand `Nurse Matilda,' and herself stars as the `nanny' with one big protruding front tooth. She arrives at the door of one Mr. Brown (Colin Firth), with a magic walking cane with which she casts a spell on the unruly motherless children who had been so good at making the life of the previous governesses very miserable.But Nanny McPhee is no ordinary governess, with her magic which is totally different from Mary Poppins.' Kids may act very rudely, even try to deceive Nanny McPhee, but she only lets them face the consequences of their bad behaviors. The story may sound preachy and humorless (and some may find it so), but thanks to the credible interactions between Emma Thompson and the seven children, especially Thomas Sangster, the film's main story is always involving.The film has a sub-plot about the hasty plans of Mr. Brown and his remarriage. Mr. Brown reluctantly decides on marrying again, because his stern and aristocratic aunt (Angela Lansbury) orders him to do so within a month. Every piece is put in the right place at the end of the story (including the unrequited love of illiterate but sweet maid Evangeline played by very sweet Kelly McDonald), but things look a little too good and predictable, with more obvious slapsticks and less darker implications.Forget about the dancing donkey and that kind of silly things in `Nanny McPhee.' The magic works in this film, but not that way. In `Nanny McPhee,' the magic is there to sort out the troubles in Mr. Brown's house, making the kids well-behaved and, more importantly, wiser. Its world is soaked in brilliant colors - interior of the room, the costume, and so on - and Nanny McPhee, always dressed in black, remains the same, giving the driest wit and humor. I love the film for this dry wit and humor, quintessentially British.",4,Emma Thompson Is Nanny McPhee with a Magic Walking Cane: Sweet and Slightly Dark,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2511,"['Stellar', 'British', 'actors', 'are', 'gathered', 'production', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'British', 'family', 'picture', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'director', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'who', 'did', 'wicked', 'comedy', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Divine', 'back', '1998', 'set', 'small', 'Irish', 'village', 'where', 'small', 'beget', 'bigger', 'lies', ""'Nanny"", 'McPhee', 'small', 'magic', 'newly', 'arrived', 'governess', 'black', 'rehabilitate', 'troubled', 'relations', 'kids', 'father', 'only', 'several', 'close', 'calls', 'provide', 'darkly', 'funny', 'moments.For', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'wrote', 'script', 'based', 'children', 'book', 'Christina', 'Brand', 'Nurse', 'Matilda', 'nanny', 'one', 'big', 'protruding', 'front', 'tooth', 'door', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'magic', 'walking', 'cane', 'spell', 'unruly', 'motherless', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'making', 'life', 'previous', 'governesses', 'very', 'miserable.But', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'ordinary', 'governess', 'magic', 'totally', 'different', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Kids', 'may', 'act', 'very', 'rudely', 'even', 'try', 'deceive', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'only', 'face', 'consequences', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'story', 'may', 'sound', 'preachy', 'humorless', 'may', 'find', 'so', 'thanks', 'credible', 'interactions', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'seven', 'children', 'especially', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'film', 'main', 'story', 'always', 'involving.The', 'film', 'sub-plot', 'hasty', 'plans', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'remarriage', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'reluctantly', 'marrying', 'again', 'stern', 'aristocratic', 'aunt', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'orders', 'do', 'so', 'month', 'piece', 'put', 'right', 'place', 'end', 'story', 'including', 'unrequited', 'love', 'illiterate', 'sweet', 'maid', 'Evangeline', 'played', 'very', 'sweet', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'things', 'look', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'predictable', 'more', 'obvious', 'slapsticks', 'less', 'darker', 'implications.Forget', 'dancing', 'donkey', 'kind', 'silly', 'things', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'magic', 'film', 'not', 'way', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'magic', 'there', 'sort', 'out', 'troubles', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'house', 'making', 'kids', 'well-behaved', 'more', 'importantly', 'wiser', 'world', 'soaked', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'interior', 'room', 'costume', 'so', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'always', 'dressed', 'black', 'same', 'giving', 'driest', 'wit', 'humor', 'love', 'film', 'dry', 'wit', 'humor', 'quintessentially', 'British']",N/A

My wife and I wanted a bit more interaction between the characters after the major conclusion of the story. Closure is always nice, but nanny McPhee lacked that. There was no intereraction and ""thank you's"" after Nanny McPhee helped the family. We were saddened by this. It is hard to watch such a good film end so abruptly. It is still a 5 star family film, despite this.Total Score (out of 100) = 7543 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.8 (out of 10). Acting.
