514038,AHAJB6Y4WATM4,B0000296R0,Andrew C.,"[2, 2]","I would like to say that I liked this film, because I like Donnie Yen and I love martial arts films.  Yen's first directorial effort, however, fails to capture his true abilities as an actor and martial artist.  The plot is simple.  An older Yen reflects, through flashbacks, on a past where he returns to a village where his forgotten sweetheart lives.  She recognizes him, though he has amnesia, and rekindles their relationship.  Meanwhile, Yen is pursued by a group of bandits that eventually kidnap his girlfriend.  This leads to fight scenes that are so blurry and speeded up that it is hard to tell who is hitting whom.  That is where this film really fails, the build up to the action scenes leaves the viewer disappointed with the way they are filmed.  To Yen's credit, he was attempting to add a freshness to a genre that has existed for many years, and even though it failed, his later effort Ballistic Kiss, is a beautiful film that does what I think this film meant to.  It is very similar to Wong Kar Wai's Fallen Angels, in the way it depicts the violence and loneliness of a hitman lost in a world that doesn't understand him.  I recommend seeing Legend of the Wolf and then seeing Ballistic Kiss to see how Yen has grown as an actor and martial artist.",3,See this movie as a precursor to Yen's Ballistic Kiss,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,1269,"['would', 'like', 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'like', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'Yen', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'however', 'capture', 'true', 'abilities', 'actor', 'martial', 'artist', 'plot', 'simple', 'older', 'Yen', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'where', 'village', 'where', 'forgotten', 'sweetheart', 'lives', 'amnesia', 'relationship', 'Meanwhile', 'Yen', 'pursued', 'group', 'bandits', 'eventually', 'kidnap', 'girlfriend', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'blurry', 'speeded', 'up', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'hitting', 'whom', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'viewer', 'disappointed', 'way', 'are', 'filmed', 'Yen', 'credit', 'was', 'attempting', 'add', 'freshness', 'genre', 'existed', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'failed', 'later', 'effort', 'Ballistic', 'Kiss', 'beautiful', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'meant', 'very', 'similar', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'way', 'violence', 'loneliness', 'hitman', 'lost', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Legend', 'Wolf', 'then', 'seeing', 'Ballistic', 'Kiss', 'see', 'how', 'Yen', 'grown', 'actor', 'martial', 'artist']",The Legend of the Wolf AKA The New Big Boss

514040,A3KGLF4ORJJD20,B0000296R0,Dragon Man X,"[4, 5]","Also known as The New Big Boss (after Bruce's film), this is one review I am sad to write because Donnie is one of my favorite martial artists...this movie is just plain bad, and I understand this was one of Donnie's early start in directing, but that doesn't save it from being bad...story?...Man with amnesia goes back to a temple that is familiar in his dreams and searches for a woman that he sees in his dreams as well hoping to get some answers to his identity...the village nearby is constantly being terrorized by bandits and Donnie, miraculously remembering one thing-his fighting abilities, helps fight them off...the movie is mostly about rememberance, bloody fights, and a reblossoming love...now the bad part, the fighting caught on camera is horrendously awful and a big waste on Donnie's part...the camera is way to close to the fighters and all you see are hand movements with less body movements...it seems everything is sped up as well for that ultra fast fighting appeal...it just makes it worse...you can't see the fighting in its true form because the camera is too damn close, and there were a lot of good moves by Donnie that were put to waste cuz you couldn't really see them...other than this, the fighting is extremely unrealistic...I mean there were several occasions were Donnie took out literally 100 men by himself and this just made me think &quot;O please&quot;...what kept me watching was the love story tho and I would've given this film at least a rating of 2, but the whole end scene, just a little before the last battle sequence of this film just destroyed that possibility...if you ever watch this, just keep that in mind...This is by far one of Donnie's worst movies, and I've seen most of his flicks...I think he even knows that this movie was bad, but great actors every now and then understandibly make bad movies...go ahead and rent it to find out, but for heaven's sake don't buy it unless you gotta have everything Donnie made...The Legend of the Wolf version of the film is presented with original chinese language with english subs, and the sound is 2 channel surround...The New Big Boss version is only an English Dub with a 5.1 dbd track...I don't recommend either haha, this movie is just bad, but usually chinese is the way to go for me...check out better Donnie fims like Tiger Cage 2, Iron Monkey, OUATIC 2 alongside Jet Li, Wing Chun alongside Michelle Yeoh, and Drunken Tai Chi...Hope this review was helpful, check out my other HK reviews as well...

Fans of Iron Monkey may enjoy the super revved up action, but even if you don't like it when they majorly undercrank films, this may still catch your eye.The movie is all a flashback story.  Donnie Yen is old and is telling a kid a story about when he was young and lost his memory.  By the end both stories get wrapped up very nicely.  But the end scene absolutely blew me away.  There is somethign that happened right before the final fight scene that boosted this up to a 4.  I guess I wasn't expecting any real movie moments, but this had a hell of a lot of them.Now the action scenes I have to say are one of a kind.  There is a match with a guy who is usign chains to fight donnie, that was my favorite.  ALL of teh fights are unreal but awesome.  The one with the guy using like monkey or tiger style was INTENSE.
