332638,AO37T54VEP0JQ,6302760089,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[36, 36]","The inspired, superb teaming of Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda help raise this laid back film from almost certain obscurity.  Based on the novel by Max Evans 'The Rounders' emerged as a sleeper hit when released in '65 and after all this time continues to defy the odds and remain a real audience pleaser today.  Told with all too rare simplicity and filmed on alternately stark locations and colorful vistas, screenwriter and director Burt Kennedy crafts another one of his long series of winning films.  Ford and Fonda play the aging bronc-busters (or 'cowboys with their brains kicked out' as Ford says) Ben Jones and Howdy Lewis just trying to earn enough money for a boat so they can live on the ocean...or a desert isle...or...well anywhere ""where there ain't no grass and there ain't no horses!"" as Ben firmly explains it to Howdy.  Two factors stand in the way of their dreams: working for a stingy rancher who tries to pinch the duo for what he can and their own penchant for wasting every dime they earn in a matter of days when they make the annual journey into Sedona.As the movie opens it is early autumn; Ben and Howdy reluctantly accept work from Jim Ed Love, a rancher they both love to hate.  Part of their duties includes attempting to tame a furious and ornery young mustang properly named ""Ol' Fooler"".  The horse quickly becomes their arch nemesis as it continually defies their attempts at bronc-busting; wily old veterans they refuse to be done-in by the stubborn animal and will eventually talk Love into letting them keep it as part of their pay.  Ben and Howdy brainstorm that they can make a mint and leave their hard-luck days behind at the annual rodeo in Sedona by betting that no one can ride their varmint of a horse for longer than eight seconds.  The plan goes fairly well but they encounter an unexpected twist of events that threatens to ruin the guys' enterprise and sink their dreams fast.It shouldn't amount to much - but it does.  One of the very best supporting casts ever assembled helps out tremendously providing endless appeal and colorful characterizations.  Chill Wills, Edgar Buchanan, and both Kathleen & Joan Freeman show up as the story progresses and have fairly expanded roles.  Barton MacLane, Denver Pyle and Doodles Weaver appear in cameo roles that seem tailored perfectly to their talents.  An uncredited Warren Oates plays a bumbling gun-crazy wrangler that runs afoul of Jones and Lewis.  The best surprise of all though is Sue Ann Langdon and Hope Holiday as two attractive and voluptuous ladies that Ben and Howdy happen upon when they make the late spring journey into Sedona.  This sequence of the film supplies us with it's funniest and most memorable moments.Made at a time when films could be both sparse of activity and routinely but unabashedly sentimental 'The Rounders' is living proof that comedies don't have to be big, bold and brassy to be enjoyed.  For a refreshing change of pace and an opportunity to see Ford and Fonda at their most likeable I heartily recommend you set aside some time for this flick.",5,They sure don't make 'em like they used to...do they?,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,3077,"['inspired', 'superb', 'teaming', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'help', 'raise', 'laid', 'back', 'film', 'almost', 'certain', 'obscurity', 'Based', 'novel', 'Max', 'Evans', 'Rounders', 'emerged', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'when', 'released', ""'65"", 'time', 'defy', 'odds', 'remain', 'real', 'audience', 'pleaser', 'today', 'Told', 'too', 'rare', 'simplicity', 'filmed', 'alternately', 'stark', 'locations', 'colorful', 'vistas', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'one', 'long', 'series', 'winning', 'films', 'Ford', 'Fonda', 'play', 'aging', 'bronc-busters', 'brains', 'kicked', 'out', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'Howdy', 'Lewis', 'just', 'trying', 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'boat', 'can', 'live', 'ocean', 'desert', 'isle', 'well', 'anywhere', 'where', 'ai', ""n't"", 'grass', 'ai', ""n't"", 'horses', 'Ben', 'firmly', 'Howdy', 'Two', 'factors', 'stand', 'way', 'dreams', 'working', 'stingy', 'rancher', 'who', 'pinch', 'duo', 'what', 'can', 'own', 'penchant', 'wasting', 'dime', 'earn', 'matter', 'days', 'when', 'make', 'annual', 'journey', 'Sedona.As', 'movie', 'early', 'autumn', 'Ben', 'Howdy', 'reluctantly', 'accept', 'work', 'Jim', 'Ed', 'Love', 'rancher', 'love', 'hate', 'Part', 'duties', 'attempting', 'tame', 'furious', 'ornery', 'young', 'mustang', 'properly', 'named', 'Ol', 'Fooler', 'horse', 'quickly', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'continually', 'attempts', 'bronc-busting', 'wily', 'old', 'veterans', 'refuse', 'be', 'done-in', 'stubborn', 'animal', 'will', 'eventually', 'talk', 'Love', 'letting', 'keep', 'part', 'pay', 'Ben', 'Howdy', 'brainstorm', 'can', 'make', 'mint', 'leave', 'hard-luck', 'days', 'annual', 'rodeo', 'Sedona', 'betting', 'one', 'can', 'ride', 'varmint', 'horse', 'longer', 'eight', 'seconds', 'plan', 'fairly', 'well', 'encounter', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'events', 'ruin', 'guys', 'enterprise', 'sink', 'dreams', 'fast.It', 'should', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'One', 'very', 'best', 'supporting', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'out', 'tremendously', 'providing', 'endless', 'appeal', 'colorful', 'characterizations', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Kathleen', 'Joan', 'Freeman', 'show', 'up', 'story', 'progresses', 'have', 'fairly', 'expanded', 'roles', 'Barton', 'MacLane', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Doodles', 'Weaver', 'appear', 'cameo', 'roles', 'seem', 'tailored', 'perfectly', 'talents', 'uncredited', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'bumbling', 'gun-crazy', 'wrangler', 'afoul', 'Jones', 'Lewis', 'best', 'surprise', 'though', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Langdon', 'Hope', 'Holiday', 'two', 'attractive', 'voluptuous', 'ladies', 'Ben', 'Howdy', 'happen', 'when', 'make', 'late', 'spring', 'journey', 'Sedona', 'sequence', 'film', 'supplies', 'funniest', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments.Made', 'time', 'when', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'sparse', 'activity', 'routinely', 'unabashedly', 'sentimental', 'Rounders', 'living', 'proof', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'big', 'bold', 'brassy', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Ford', 'Fonda', 'most', 'likeable', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'flick']",The Rounders VHS

During their latest job of working out a string of broncs, they discover one that definitely has a mind of its own as it resists practically every effort to tame it. In fact, he becomes the one animal that exasperates Ben to no end and proves to be a thorn in his side, no matter what he does. He traded him for whisky only to have the man come and demand his whisky back after the horse  literally tore up his farm. Another attempt to get rid of him only saw the horse return on its own bearing a pair of boots still stuck to the rope stirrups by the spurs. And it isn't just the horse that provides the comedy as Ben and Howdy find two strippers with a car broken down and what happens when they try their hands at a bit of romance only to end up trying to help them out when they lose their clothing after a night of skinny dipping, thanks again to a mischievous horse. If this isn't a classic, it should be.

These guys are loveable foul-ups, roustabouts who haven't quite figured out how to get ahead, but sure like doing things the hard way.

I've seen Henry Fonda & Glenn Ford in tons of movies but I don't think I'd ever laughed so hard and enjoyed them so much as I had in The Rounders. They're portrayal of burned-out ol' cowhands locked in a life pattern is spot on with too many actual characters I've grown up with here in Wyoming. Despite being made in the 60's it is remarkable how well it holds up 50 years later. Glenn Ford's Hate/love relationship with that truly evil horse is one of the funniest things ever.

It is a film that defines great countryside, solid friendship, how dreams keep yuh going, how great a movie can be without much of a plot, and how yuh learn to love your enemy.  In this case, the enemy is that cagey Roan roping, bucking horse that slo-witted Ford tried his dangdest to break and couldn't.  He wants to run down the horse with a pickup, shoot it,send it to the glue factory [soap product in this case] or sell it to some sucker willing to buy it.

Then, in the Spring, the cycle is repeated with the same result.On the ranch there is as a roan horse that is strongly reminiscent of the strawberry roan of Marty Robbins' song, which the boys view with a love/hate relationship.

Both parents enjoyed the movie so much that both stayed up until nearly ten thirty at night to watch the whole movie. It was a refreshing change of pace from many of the modern movies where more gunplay and swearing would probably be included just as the course of normal events, but we enjoyed the movie as it was.
