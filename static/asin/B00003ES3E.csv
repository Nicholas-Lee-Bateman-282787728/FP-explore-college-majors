544852,AIMR915K4YCN,B00003ES3E,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[22, 24]","EMBRYO is about Dr. Paul Holliston (Rock Hudson), a scientist who has recently lost his wife (also a scientist). Holliston hits a doberman with his car (a 3 ton cadillac) on his way home one stormy night. He rushes the dog home to his lab, where he is unable to save her. However, the doberman is pregnant, so the good doctor keeps the doggy fetus alive, injecting it with an experimental growth hormone. The little canine grows at an amazing rate, reaching adulthood within hours! Holliston names the dog ""Number One"" and is astonished by it's intelligence (the dog gets it's own food out of the fridge, drops the empty bowl in the sink, opens doors, etc.). Unbeknownst to the doc, Number One also has a mean streak, as is displayed when it kills another dog and hides it's body. Of course, Holliston thinks everything's great, and soon looks for a human fetus to try his serum on. He gets his chance when another doctor helps him acquire a fetus from a doomed prostitute. Back in the lab, Dr. H. performs his latest experiment with similar results. He watches as the fetus grows up at super-speed. Next thing he knows, he's got an adult woman on his hands (Barbara Carrera), with superior intellectual powers matched only by her exotic beauty. Some of the best parts of the movie come when she is busy absorbing knowledge. Named ""Victoria"", she is introduced at a party as Holliston's new assistant. In one fun scene, Victoria plays an arrogant chess master (Roddy McDowall) to a humiliating finish. Unfortunately, things get serious when Victoria starts getting sick and figures out that she is not long for this world. This causes her to seek out the method by which she can stay alive, at the expense of others.

544853,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00003ES3E,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","My review is based on the quality of the production and not the video transfer.  This is an extremely muddy transfer that I doubt will be rectified in the future because of the relative obscurity of the film itself.  In 1968 director Ralph Nelson tackled the issue of science and ethics in what I consider to be a disappointing result with ""Charly"".  I found that film today as a dated psychedelic artifact.  What I found interesting about ""Embryo"" is the way it tackles life issues.  Released in 1976, it came out shortly on the heels of Roe v. Wade and just a few short years before the first test tube baby.  Rock Hudson's character isn't some mad scientist who wants to play God.  Recently widowed, his reasons for creating life are more altruistic.  He even recognizes the necessity of morality to his creation, Victoria(Barbara Carrera), by citing the Bible to her.  Unfortunately, beauty and brains do not alone make us human. Even if you are born when you are 25 years old it takes years to develope a core morality.

The plot of the 1975 film Embryo is about a scientist named Paul Holliston played by Rock Hudson who hits a Doberman one dark and stormy night.  He brings the dog back to his laboratory and lays it on a table.  After examining the badly injured dog he realized that she is pregnant.  In an attempt to save her three pups Dr.Holliston removes them and injects them with a growth hormone.  Two of the pups die but one servives.  After the mother dog dies and the pup must live without her blood Dr. Holliston administers more of the drugs to the pup.  He begins growing at an incredibly fast rate and in a short amount of time is fully grown.  At first his experiment seems to be a huge success.  The dog who the doctor names number one is perfectly formed and highly intelligent.  He quickly learns tricks like getting his own food dish and putting it in the sink when he is finished.  But, we soon see that number one has a dark side when the dog is outside by himself and he sees a little dog who is barking st him.  Number one picks the dog up in his teeth shacks him until he is dead hides him in the grass and then number one gets in the doctors car and closes the door behind him so that the doctor will not know what he has done.  unaware of the dogs evil side the doctor decides to experiment on a human fetus.  The human fetus also grows very quickly and in a matter of weeks is an adult woman who the doctor names Victoria.  Victoria and the doctor are very close and even have sex together! Then Victoria begins having crippling abdominal pains.  She doesn't tell the doctor but trys to find out what the problem is herself.  When she learns that she is aging rapidly and will die.  The only way she will live is if she kills someone to get what she needs to survive.  The dog number one also begins going more crazy and chasing and growling at Dr. Holiston and his assistant. When Dr. Holliston learns the truth about Victoria commiting murder his feelings for her completely change and he now wants to destroy his creation.
