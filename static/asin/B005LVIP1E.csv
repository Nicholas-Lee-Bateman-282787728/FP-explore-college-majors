The video and audio is good for the age of the series, but not as nice as the Gunsmoke series.  There is also one important item on each disc missing - a ""play all"" feature.  Sadly, when one episode is done, the very tiring, very loud menu music comes on, probably to wake one up so they can push the play button on the remote to go to the next episode.
