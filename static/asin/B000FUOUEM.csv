My favorite is the Gospel of John, I like the way the actor portrayed Jesus. Acts is very good too. I love the way Dean Jones as the Apostle Luke narrates and weaves the story together. These dramatized movies really help bring out things that one misses in just reading these Books of the Bible. They also have Spanish with English substitles - good for practicing either language. I don't think I've watched Matthew all the way through yet.Overall I would recommend getting the set.",4,"Very nice set, good price",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,627,"['set', '3', 'movies', 'based', 'word-for-word', 'NIV', 'New', 'International', 'Version', '-Bible', 'Books', 'Matthew', 'Gospel', 'John', 'Acts', 'favorite', 'Gospel', 'John', 'like', 'way', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'Jesus', 'Acts', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'love', 'way', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'Apostle', 'Luke', 'narrates', 'story', 'together', 'dramatized', 'movies', 'really', 'help', 'bring', 'out', 'things', 'one', 'just', 'reading', 'Books', 'Bible', 'also', 'have', 'Spanish', 'English', 'substitles', 'good', 'practicing', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Matthew', 'way', 'yet.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'set']",Visual Bible 3-Episode Set

We will be doing the same with the Matthew and Acts DVD's starting in the fall. Because of the quality of acting and realistic scenes on the John DVD the group really was able to ""get the picture"" and the studies blossomed as a result.

996238,A319APCDCJWAP6,B000FUOUEM,;),"[0, 0]",Great movie. What makes this collection so awesome it is word for word from the Bible while the actors remain in character. I can't even explain it but let me just say how great it would be to have the entire Bible like this. Although I would not trade for the actual text I still think it makes the Bible visually &#34;alive&#34; and easier for people to understand. This movie had excellent acting and was  definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent. Loving Bruce Marchiano as &#34;Jesus&#34; I love how he portrays a more loving with great sense of humor type of Jesus than the &#34;Jesus&#34; I &#34;knew&#34; growing up.,5,a MUST watch,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,691,"['Great', 'movie', 'What', 'collection', 'so', 'awesome', 'word', 'word', 'Bible', 'actors', 'remain', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'how', 'great', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'entire', 'Bible', 'would', 'not', 'trade', 'actual', 'text', 'still', 'think', 'Bible', 'visually', '34', 'alive', '34', 'easier', 'people', 'understand', 'movie', 'had', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'boring', 'Thank', 'God', 'most', 'Bible', 'based', 'movies', 'days', 'movie', 'exceeding', 'talent', 'Loving', 'Bruce', 'Marchiano', '34', 'Jesus', '34', 'love', 'how', 'more', 'loving', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'type', 'Jesus', '34', 'Jesus', '34', '34', 'knew', '34', 'growing', 'up']",Visual Bible 3-Episode Set

996240,A1UUC7JTSBUGWG,B000FUOUEM,Lea,"[0, 0]",I have enjoyed these DVD's very much and watch them over and over. They are inspirational and very much worth the money. They followed the scriptures to the letter. The one disappointment was that The Gospel of John did not show the scripture verse by verse. Even though it was not NIV I followed the version used in my Bible and it was the same except for a word her or there moved. Acts I was enjoying but It locked up on Chapter 22. It completely locked up the system and was hard to shut off. So I didn't get to watch the end of it. I did try again but it did the same thing in the same spot. I think there was a flaw in the DVD or the filmig itsself. The acting in all three was very good also.,5,Visual Bible 3-Episode Set,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,699,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'are', 'inspirational', 'very', 'much', 'money', 'followed', 'scriptures', 'letter', 'one', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Gospel', 'John', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'scripture', 'verse', 'verse', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'NIV', 'followed', 'version', 'used', 'Bible', 'was', 'same', 'word', 'moved', 'Acts', 'was', 'enjoying', 'locked', 'up', 'Chapter', '22', 'completely', 'locked', 'up', 'system', 'was', 'hard', 'shut', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'end', 'did', 'try', 'again', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'spot', 'think', 'was', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'filmig', 'itsself', 'acting', 'three', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'also']",Visual Bible 3-Episode Set
