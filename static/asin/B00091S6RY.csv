899475,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00091S6RY,Nicholas Carroll,"[10, 16]","Okay, I admit, I'm a fan of ""Mormon cinema""...even though they tend to be on the ""cheesy side"" of wholesome (would you like some velveeta with your milk and honey?). From this film's trailer that I saw on other Halestorm dvds, I expected a funnier film that goes to the heart of religious dialogue and tolerance. Oh, and I expected it to be funny too. Disappointing in both elements, though I did have a couple chuckles.First, what I like about it were the lead characters, especially Heather Beers as Charity. She was great in her role as a jilted lover who runs off to a small town to get over her abusive fiance. The male lead, who plays Tartan, is equally delightful, as his facial expressions clearly show what he's thinking and how he's feeling. They are two good actors in a film that doesn't rise to their level of talent, and that's a shame. I hope they will find roles in future films, in Saltywood or Hollywood. I also liked the Native American guy, but his role was miniscule. He should have been one of the major characters...he has a cool presence about him and some cool lines.Now, what I didn't like about the film...This film played up the division between Mormons and Baptists in a small town named ""Longfellow"" (they don't give a state, so it could be anyone that borders Utah, so it's either Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, or perhaps even eastern Oregon), but we don't really meet any Baptists and see what they think about the Mormons...other than a few eccentric minor characters and the plot about the ugliness of the Mormon chapel. This film obviously skewers towards the Mormons, making them look like the rational, olive branch extending diplomats and the Baptists look like inbred imbeciles with irrational dislikes of the Mormons. That's not how the movie advertised itself! I would have liked to have seen more Baptists characters and normal ones at that, and to hear what they have against the Mormons. The impression I got was that this film wasn't fully developed...and everyone knows what happens when you undercook meat at a barbecue.There's little preaching and no baptisms in this film, and a somewhat funny incident in the hills as one lapsed Mormon lady hears a voice crying out, which brings the townfolk together, putting aside their differences. It was a nice, touching scene that fell somewhat flat, because the film didn't focus on any Baptists early on. The filmmakers didn't even try on that point, so that's why I was disappointed and only give it three stars. The best Mormon films still remain the three Missionary films (""The Best Two Years"", ""God's Army"", and ""The Other Side of Heaven"").Ignore any trailer you might have seen.  This film is really about a 29 year old single Mormon male with a mother who's always trying to hook him up with a ""sweet spirited"" Mormon girl so he can be eternally wed. He finds a job in a small town and meets up with a Mormon girl who had run away from her fiance. They flirt and fall in love. Basic romantic comedy material, with little romance or comedy, bogged down by some eccentric characters as they learn to tolerate each other. Its worth seeing, but probably not owning. I'm still hoping Halestorm will produce a more polished script. This film is not it. Maybe ""Suits on the Loose"" will be that film, but that's just hitting theaters in the Intermountain west and won't be on dvd anytime soon.",3,"Not enough Baptists to make a point, this film is BBQ'd!",1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,3400,"['Okay', 'admit', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Mormon', 'cinema', 'even', 'tend', 'be', 'cheesy', 'side', 'wholesome', 'would', 'like', 'velveeta', 'milk', 'honey', 'film', 'trailer', 'saw', 'other', 'Halestorm', 'dvds', 'expected', 'funnier', 'film', 'heart', 'religious', 'dialogue', 'tolerance', 'Oh', 'expected', 'be', 'funny', 'too', 'Disappointing', 'elements', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'chuckles.First', 'what', 'like', 'were', 'lead', 'characters', 'especially', 'Heather', 'Beers', 'Charity', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'jilted', 'lover', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'get', 'abusive', 'fiance', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'Tartan', 'equally', 'delightful', 'facial', 'expressions', 'clearly', 'show', 'what', 'thinking', 'how', 'feeling', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'actors', 'film', ""n't"", 'rise', 'level', 'talent', 'shame', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'roles', 'future', 'films', 'Saltywood', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'liked', 'Native', 'American', 'guy', 'role', 'was', 'miniscule', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'cool', 'presence', 'cool', 'lines.Now', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'film', 'played', 'up', 'division', 'Mormons', 'Baptists', 'small', 'town', 'named', 'Longfellow', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'state', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'borders', 'Utah', 'Idaho', 'Nevada', 'Colorado', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Wyoming', 'perhaps', 'even', 'eastern', 'Oregon', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'meet', 'Baptists', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Mormons', 'other', 'few', 'eccentric', 'minor', 'characters', 'plot', 'ugliness', 'Mormon', 'chapel', 'film', 'obviously', 'skewers', 'towards', 'Mormons', 'making', 'look', 'rational', 'olive', 'branch', 'extending', 'diplomats', 'Baptists', 'look', 'inbred', 'imbeciles', 'irrational', 'dislikes', 'Mormons', 'not', 'how', 'movie', 'advertised', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Baptists', 'characters', 'normal', 'ones', 'hear', 'what', 'have', 'Mormons', 'impression', 'got', 'was', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'everyone', 'what', 'when', 'undercook', 'meat', 'little', 'preaching', 'baptisms', 'film', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'incident', 'hills', 'one', 'lapsed', 'Mormon', 'lady', 'voice', 'crying', 'out', 'townfolk', 'together', 'putting', 'aside', 'differences', 'was', 'nice', 'touching', 'scene', 'fell', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'Baptists', 'early', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'point', 'why', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'best', 'Mormon', 'films', 'still', 'remain', 'three', 'Missionary', 'films', 'Best', 'Two', 'Years', 'God', 'Army', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven', '.Ignore', 'trailer', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'really', '29', 'year', 'old', 'single', 'Mormon', 'male', 'mother', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'hook', 'up', 'sweet', 'spirited', 'Mormon', 'girl', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'eternally', 'wed', 'job', 'small', 'town', 'up', 'Mormon', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'run', 'away', 'fiance', 'flirt', 'fall', 'love', 'Basic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'material', 'little', 'romance', 'comedy', 'bogged', 'down', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'learn', 'tolerate', 'other', 'worth', 'seeing', 'probably', 'not', 'owning', ""'m"", 'still', 'hoping', 'Halestorm', 'will', 'produce', 'more', 'polished', 'script', 'film', 'not', 'Maybe', 'Suits', 'Loose', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'just', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'Intermountain', 'west', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dvd', 'anytime', 'soon']",Baptist At Our Barbecue

899478,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B00091S6RY,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[4, 6]","Baptists at Our Barbeque is a movie apparently produced primarily for a Mormon audience.  By way of example, there are any number of inside jokes and references that Gentiles will probably miss entirely, a stark contrast to Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegon where even outsiders get the jokes.  But much like Lake Woebegon, the essential plot and almost comic innocence of the characters who populate this movie make it broadly appealing.The story is simple enough: an unmarried, 29 year-old Mormon forest ranger decides to accept a transfer to the oddball town of Longfellow to escape the efforts of his mother (and the efforts of the mothers of every unmarried girl in Provo) to get him hitched.  But Longfellow is no ordinary town.  Tucked away somewhere in the beautiful Rockies, it is a community precisely divided between Baptists and Mormons.  This balance, and the competition is engenders, essentially fuels the movie.  Yes, there are the colorful and eccentric characters we have come to expect from small town settings ever since Andy Griffith introduced us to Barney, Floyd and the rest of the off-kilter residents of Mayberry; and there is the central love story between ""Tartan,"" the main character, and the incredibly beautiful ""Charity,"" played by Heather Beers. There is even an antagonist, the pathetic ""Rich"" who provides the movie's small amount of tension and danger.What unfolds is general silliness wrapped around a deeper story of the Baptist and Mormon communities coming together.  Recalling the original Star Trek episode, ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,"" starring Frank Gorshin, the essential point of this movie is that while the Mormons and Baptists of Longfellow may see each other as starkly ""different,"" to the eyes of outsiders they are in fact all but identical.  Where skin-deep differences in ""Let That Be...."" led to tragedy, however, the characters in Barbeque eventually come to see that the differences are unimportant.Neither the script nor the essential story call for great acting, and the cast does a more than decent job engaging us in the respective quirks of their characters.  If there are faults to be found in this movie a central one is that in an effort to depict the characters as completely wholesome, even essential human emotions are bleached out of existence.  While the addition of graphic sex would NOT have improved the story one iota, the main character's lack of response when his house is torched by the local miscreant strikes a dissonant chord and somehow loses him the sympathy the audience has built for him.  A second point is that the movie is essentially told entirely from the Mormon's perspective.  While the script certainly is not heavy on theology, the lack of Baptist perspective leaves that group looking simply like bigots.  Finally, one wonders what the story would have been like if it had featured Catholics and Lutherans.  But that particular minefield has long been staked out by Keillor and these are small quibbles.  Maybe there really are towns like this somewhere where people just naturally and repeatedly turn the other cheek  Would that it were so...we could all learn a lesson from such tolerance.",4,a cute look at a silly but innocent world,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3192,"['Baptists', 'Barbeque', 'movie', 'apparently', 'produced', 'primarily', 'Mormon', 'audience', 'way', 'example', 'are', 'number', 'inside', 'jokes', 'references', 'Gentiles', 'will', 'probably', 'miss', 'entirely', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Garrison', 'Keillor', 'Lake', 'Woebegon', 'where', 'even', 'outsiders', 'get', 'jokes', 'much', 'Lake', 'Woebegon', 'essential', 'plot', 'almost', 'comic', 'innocence', 'characters', 'who', 'populate', 'movie', 'make', 'broadly', 'appealing.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'unmarried', '29', 'year-old', 'Mormon', 'forest', 'ranger', 'decides', 'accept', 'transfer', 'oddball', 'town', 'Longfellow', 'escape', 'efforts', 'mother', 'efforts', 'mothers', 'unmarried', 'girl', 'Provo', 'get', 'hitched', 'Longfellow', 'ordinary', 'town', 'Tucked', 'away', 'somewhere', 'beautiful', 'Rockies', 'community', 'precisely', 'divided', 'Baptists', 'Mormons', 'balance', 'competition', 'engenders', 'essentially', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'colorful', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'small', 'town', 'settings', 'ever', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'introduced', 'Barney', 'Floyd', 'rest', 'off-kilter', 'residents', 'Mayberry', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'Tartan', 'main', 'character', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Charity', 'played', 'Heather', 'Beers', 'even', 'antagonist', 'pathetic', 'Rich', 'who', 'movie', 'small', 'amount', 'tension', 'danger.What', 'unfolds', 'general', 'silliness', 'wrapped', 'deeper', 'story', 'Baptist', 'Mormon', 'communities', 'coming', 'together', 'Recalling', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Let', 'Be', 'Your', 'Last', 'Battlefield', 'starring', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'essential', 'point', 'movie', 'Mormons', 'Baptists', 'Longfellow', 'may', 'see', 'other', 'starkly', 'different', 'eyes', 'outsiders', 'are', 'fact', 'identical', 'Where', 'skin-deep', 'differences', 'Let', 'Be', 'led', 'tragedy', 'however', 'characters', 'Barbeque', 'eventually', 'come', 'see', 'differences', 'are', 'unimportant.Neither', 'script', 'essential', 'story', 'call', 'great', 'acting', 'cast', 'more', 'decent', 'job', 'engaging', 'respective', 'quirks', 'characters', 'are', 'faults', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'central', 'one', 'effort', 'depict', 'characters', 'completely', 'wholesome', 'even', 'essential', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'bleached', 'existence', 'addition', 'graphic', 'sex', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'improved', 'story', 'one', 'iota', 'main', 'character', 'lack', 'response', 'when', 'house', 'torched', 'local', 'miscreant', 'dissonant', 'chord', 'somehow', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'built', 'second', 'point', 'movie', 'essentially', 'told', 'entirely', 'Mormon', 'perspective', 'script', 'certainly', 'not', 'heavy', 'theology', 'lack', 'Baptist', 'perspective', 'group', 'looking', 'simply', 'bigots', 'Finally', 'one', 'what', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'featured', 'Catholics', 'Lutherans', 'particular', 'minefield', 'long', 'been', 'staked', 'out', 'Keillor', 'are', 'small', 'quibbles', 'Maybe', 'really', 'are', 'towns', 'somewhere', 'where', 'people', 'just', 'naturally', 'repeatedly', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'Would', 'were', 'so', 'could', 'learn', 'lesson', 'such', 'tolerance']",Baptist At Our Barbecue

899480,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B00091S6RY,Timothy Kearney,"[30, 32]","BAPTISTS AT OUR BARBECUE is an amusing film with many qualities that make it enjoyable. It tells the story of a young man named Tartan who moves from Utah to a small town called Longfellow, nicknamed Longwinded to escape the pressure from his mother to get married. In his new community he discovers that all of the townspeople are either Mormon or Baptist and the two religious groups despise one another. The town is filled with eccentrics and Tartan has to learn to navigate his way. He and a young woman named Charity and the Mormon elder realize that the feud between the two groups is ridiculous and they devise a plan to have an ""All Faiths Barbeque"" to bring the two together. The plan works. Tartan and Charity fall in love, and the movie has a predictable ending.It would be easy to take a cynical approach and pan the film, but as I watched it, I found myself laughing and found much of it silly, but funny. Remember silly but funny works. The HERBY THE LOVEBUG series, WHAT'S UP DOC, and IT'S A MAD MAD WORLD were all blockbusters. While the film is Mormon based, any religious groups could be substituted for Mormon or Baptist which gives ita  universal quality. Then as I thought about it, I realized that the film had strengths many films that poke fun at religious situations lack. The film pokes fun at the people's idiosyncrasies but never makes fun of faith so it does not offend. The people are flawed, but their flaws make them human, not hypocrites. Perhaps the reason it is so enjoyable is that we see ourselves and others we know in this film.",4,"SILLY, MAYBE. ENTERTAINING?
