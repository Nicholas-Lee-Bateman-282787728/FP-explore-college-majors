563609,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000051S7D,Anyechka,"[3, 4]","This seems like a pretty standard American film for 1918, though the story is solid and interesting.  The characters could use a bit more fleshing-out and the plot could use a bit more development, but overall it's enjoyable enough, given how most American films were like during the Teens.  And pretty unmemorable but for Count Roberto di San Fraccini.  I don't suppose it was intended this way, but he steals the show and gives the best performance.  It's not a good sign when the best character is the one who's supposed to be written as the bad guy and when you're cheering for the villain instead of the adequate and solid but ultimately unmemorable characters he's blackmailing.  And being a melodrama, Vera Sisson's character of Mary is too good, too pure, too devoted to her boyfriend Douglas and her father that she only marries the Count as part of the blackmail scheme, not because romantic feelings for him ever enter into her head.  When he announces to his friend that he's getting rather tired of how this blackmail marriage isn't consummated and how she isn't voluntarily coming to his room like he told her to do when she felt ready, I was almost hoping there would be a rape scene like in 'Son of the Sheik,' make things interesting and lively.  Unfortunately Roberto doesn't succeed in breaking into Mary's room, where the family maid is fiercely protecting her.  Besides the attempted break-in, the most exciting scene is the car crash.  Another highlight is the ten-minute excerpt from the 1919 film 'Eyes of Youth'; I'm interested in seeing the whole film now and not just RV's cameo.",4,The Count steals the show,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,1606,"['pretty', 'standard', 'American', 'film', '1918', 'story', 'solid', 'interesting', 'characters', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'fleshing-out', 'plot', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'development', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'given', 'how', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'were', 'Teens', 'pretty', 'unmemorable', 'Count', 'Roberto', 'San', 'Fraccini', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'was', 'intended', 'way', 'show', 'best', 'performance', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'best', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'written', 'bad', 'guy', 'when', ""'re"", 'cheering', 'villain', 'instead', 'adequate', 'solid', 'ultimately', 'unmemorable', 'characters', 'blackmailing', 'being', 'melodrama', 'Vera', 'Sisson', 'character', 'Mary', 'too', 'good', 'too', 'pure', 'too', 'devoted', 'boyfriend', 'Douglas', 'father', 'only', 'Count', 'part', 'blackmail', 'scheme', 'not', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'ever', 'enter', 'head', 'When', 'friend', 'getting', 'rather', 'tired', 'how', 'blackmail', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'consummated', 'how', ""n't"", 'voluntarily', 'coming', 'room', 'told', 'do', 'when', 'felt', 'ready', 'was', 'almost', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'rape', 'scene', ""'Son"", 'Sheik', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'lively', 'Unfortunately', 'Roberto', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'breaking', 'Mary', 'room', 'where', 'family', 'maid', 'fiercely', 'protecting', 'attempted', 'break-in', 'most', 'exciting', 'scene', 'car', 'crash', 'highlight', 'ten-minute', 'excerpt', '1919', 'film', ""'Eyes"", 'Youth', ""'m"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'whole', 'film', 'now', 'not', 'just', 'RV', 'cameo']",N/A
563610,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B000051S7D,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[11, 11]","After reading the other reviews about a melodrama and poor or unbelievable plot, I was pleasantly surprised to find this film much better than I had expected.  I found the pace to be quite fast and you have to stay on your toes to keep up with each new development, and the plot seemed interesting, intricate and well-thought-out to me.  Needless to say, Valentino's role is a highlight, but together with the unfolding of the story and other characters the whole film is quite enjoyable and even suspenseful as you wonder what will happen next and how it will end.  Made in 1918, this film is a good example of silent films before 1920 or so, when a noticeable change took place and films became more sophisticated, smoother and more in-depth, especially with characters.  For viewers unaccustomed to pre-1920 silent films it might therefore seem to be superficial or a bit rough, but I'm sure that anyone who enjoys a solid good story will also enjoy ""The Married Virgin"" as I did.  This might also be a good point to keep in mind if you've seen Valentino in his later, more sophisticated films, but even here it's interesting to note his style, and his role as the slick, fortune-hunting Italian Count is a forerunner of some of his later playboy-type roles.  As a movie in its own right, apart from Valentino, ""The Married Virgin"" stands as a quality drama, and despite some poor picture quality at times, it is still enjoyable and entertaining to watch, thanks to an excellent orchestral musical score.  The bonus features are also worth while: an interesting excerpt from another early film with Valentino, and then some impressive and moving newsreel footage of Valentino's funeral.",4,A Fast-paced drama to keep you on the edge of your seat!,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,1689,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'melodrama', 'poor', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'found', 'pace', 'be', 'quite', 'fast', 'have', 'stay', 'toes', 'keep', 'up', 'new', 'development', 'plot', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'intricate', 'well-thought-out', 'Needless', 'say', 'Valentino', 'role', 'highlight', 'together', 'unfolding', 'story', 'other', 'characters', 'whole', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'suspenseful', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'Made', '1918', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'silent', 'films', '1920', 'so', 'when', 'noticeable', 'change', 'took', 'place', 'films', 'became', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'smoother', 'more', 'in-depth', 'especially', 'characters', 'viewers', 'unaccustomed', 'pre-1920', 'silent', 'films', 'might', 'therefore', 'seem', 'be', 'superficial', 'bit', 'rough', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'who', 'solid', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Married', 'Virgin', 'did', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'point', 'keep', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Valentino', 'later', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'films', 'even', 'here', 'interesting', 'note', 'style', 'role', 'slick', 'fortune-hunting', 'Italian', 'Count', 'forerunner', 'later', 'playboy-type', 'roles', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'apart', 'Valentino', 'Married', 'Virgin', 'quality', 'drama', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'times', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'orchestral', 'musical', 'score', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'interesting', 'excerpt', 'early', 'film', 'Valentino', 'then', 'impressive', 'moving', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Valentino', 'funeral']",N/A

When I think of melodrama I think of unbelievable characters and unbelievable plots.  In this film we have a witness to murder who waits ten years and then cracks a safe to steal the murder weapon, a lawyer who is employed to uncover corruption but doesn't find any, and a gigolo who marries a girl as part of an attempt at blackmail!  I can't trace all the plot holes - it gives me a headache trying to unravel it all.  Valentino is smooth and casual in his portrayal of a gigolo, very effective.  The overall impression I have of this movie is this: it's a production-line melodrama where the plot doesn't matter much, just give the audience some plush interiors to look at and some dramatic moments, and rake in the money.",2,"Admire the star, deplore the plot",1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,784,"['not', 'top-notch', 'silent', 'film', 'melodrama', 'When', 'think', 'melodrama', 'think', 'unbelievable', 'characters', 'unbelievable', 'plots', 'film', 'have', 'witness', 'murder', 'who', 'ten', 'years', 'then', 'cracks', 'safe', 'steal', 'murder', 'weapon', 'lawyer', 'who', 'employed', 'uncover', 'corruption', ""n't"", 'find', 'gigolo', 'who', 'girl', 'part', 'attempt', 'blackmail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trace', 'plot', 'headache', 'trying', 'unravel', 'Valentino', 'smooth', 'casual', 'portrayal', 'gigolo', 'very', 'effective', 'overall', 'impression', 'have', 'movie', 'production-line', 'melodrama', 'where', 'plot', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'just', 'give', 'audience', 'plush', 'interiors', 'look', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'rake', 'money']",N/A

This is one of Rudolph Valentino's early movies (from 1918 I believe) and he plays the scheming Count Roberto. Of course you're supposed to be cheering for Mary (the ""heroine"") to find love and happiness. And I wanted to. I really did. Unfortunately I thought she was a pretty two dimensional twit. By the end I was actually hoping she might come to her senses and fall for Count Roberto. The plot would have been much more interesting. Sadly that doesn't happen.Either way Rudolph Valentino's part is well acted and actually quite interesting. The rest of the cast is just okay but still watchable. I can't say this is the best silent movie I've ever watched but it's worth a view if you're interested in silents or Rudolph Valentino.

563613,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B000051S7D,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[5, 5]","This l918 movie antique would ordinarily have vanished into limbo decades ago if not for one exhilirating little detail: the dazzling performance of the Adonis of the Jazz Age: Rudolph Valentino.Reading about a mythical screen legend is very different from actually seeing him--right on the cusp of super stardom that would transform the male movie star for all time.As the treacherous, amoral count, Valentino is amazingly modern in his looks and perfomance.  He sports little of the heavy make-up that so dates silent screen performers.  He's frisky, lively, playful and above all--drop dead beautiful.The matinee idol of that time was either barrel-chested and fleshy (i.e., Thomas Meighan), or slender and flat chested with spindley legs (a la Wallace Reid).  Valentino defies these styles and we see  muscular, beauifully proportioned dream lover with powerful legs and shoulders.You notice this especially in a swimming scene when Valentino dons a l918 male bathing suit that covers the top with a sleeveless jersey.  His pin-up boy torso is evident and he plays the beach scene with a playful air of high energy.He wears his wardrobe beautifully and he acts so natural, without any of the eye-popping, theatrical gestures that dated many silent screen performers. Ironically, he would indulge in eye-popping snarls when he hit the big-time in l921's ""The Sheik.""The true stars of that era--Valentino, Swanson, Pickford, Fairbanks-really were worshipped by their millions of fans because of their isolated aloofness. When fans saw these glittering creatures, it was always in a screen fantasy. These legends were rarely seen by the man-in-the-street. Today's stars, of course, are all over TV, the tabloids, blabbing about their problems with ulcers, shopping, weight-gains and cellulite.That's why being able to catch Valentino--on the very verge of his mega-stardom--is such an exhilirating experience. We can see for ourselves those flashing dark eye, the impish grin, that glorious torso and that sparkling charisma that was there from the beginning.""The Married Virgin"" is a movie that any worshipper of Valentino or of the silent screen's small gallery of true immortals, should have in their library. Come to think of it, I can't think of anyone else in the cast of ""The Married Virgin.""",5,Introducing the Jazz Age Adonis!,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,2300,"['l918', 'movie', 'antique', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'have', 'vanished', 'limbo', 'decades', 'ago', 'not', 'one', 'exhilirating', 'little', 'detail', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'Adonis', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino.Reading', 'mythical', 'screen', 'legend', 'very', 'different', 'actually', 'seeing', 'right', 'cusp', 'super', 'stardom', 'would', 'transform', 'male', 'movie', 'star', 'time.As', 'treacherous', 'amoral', 'count', 'Valentino', 'amazingly', 'modern', 'looks', 'perfomance', 'sports', 'little', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'so', 'silent', 'screen', 'performers', 'frisky', 'lively', 'playful', 'drop', 'dead', 'beautiful.The', 'matinee', 'idol', 'time', 'was', 'barrel-chested', 'fleshy', 'i.e.', 'Thomas', 'Meighan', 'slender', 'flat', 'chested', 'spindley', 'legs', 'la', 'Wallace', 'Reid', 'Valentino', 'styles', 'see', 'muscular', 'beauifully', 'proportioned', 'dream', 'lover', 'powerful', 'legs', 'shoulders.You', 'notice', 'especially', 'swimming', 'scene', 'when', 'Valentino', 'l918', 'male', 'bathing', 'suit', 'top', 'sleeveless', 'jersey', 'pin-up', 'boy', 'torso', 'evident', 'beach', 'scene', 'playful', 'air', 'high', 'energy.He', 'wardrobe', 'beautifully', 'so', 'natural', 'eye-popping', 'theatrical', 'gestures', 'dated', 'many', 'silent', 'screen', 'performers', 'Ironically', 'would', 'indulge', 'eye-popping', 'snarls', 'when', 'hit', 'big-time', 'l921', 'Sheik', 'true', 'stars', 'era', 'Valentino', 'Swanson', 'Pickford', 'Fairbanks-really', 'were', 'worshipped', 'millions', 'fans', 'isolated', 'aloofness', 'When', 'fans', 'saw', 'glittering', 'creatures', 'was', 'always', 'screen', 'fantasy', 'legends', 'were', 'rarely', 'seen', 'man-in-the-street', 'Today', 'stars', 'course', 'are', 'TV', 'tabloids', 'blabbing', 'problems', 'ulcers', 'shopping', 'weight-gains', 'cellulite.That', 'why', 'being', 'able', 'catch', 'Valentino', 'very', 'verge', 'mega-stardom', 'such', 'exhilirating', 'experience', 'can', 'see', 'flashing', 'dark', 'eye', 'impish', 'grin', 'glorious', 'torso', 'sparkling', 'charisma', 'was', 'there', 'beginning', 'Married', 'Virgin', 'movie', 'worshipper', 'Valentino', 'silent', 'screen', 'small', 'gallery', 'true', 'immortals', 'should', 'have', 'library', 'Come', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'cast', 'Married', 'Virgin']",N/A
563614,A2ZKKJKTBKJYEK,B000051S7D,"""sopera""","[9, 12]","&quot;The Married Virgin&quot; is one of the oldest surviving Rudolph Valentino films. As a movie, it isn't that great. As a glimpse at an early milestone in Valentino's career, it's quite interesting.The story is, for all intents and purposes, little more than an old-time melodrama. The actors play &quot;types&quot; more than fully devloped characters: there's the virtuous young woman, her lionhearted suitor, the dastardly villain, the evil stepmother, and so on. Everyone's actions are quite predictable.The plot is quite simple: a society matron carries on a steamy affair with a sexy, conniving count (Valentino). They conspire to extort cash from the matron's husband by revealing his involvement in a crime. The husband negotiates a 'settlement' with them: a hefty sum of hush money, and his daughter's hand in marriage. It's the daughter (Vera Sisson, the title character)'s task to extricate herself from the conspiracy and find true happiness elsewhere.The film's charm comes, in large part, from a laudable performance by Valentino. Although this was one of his first pictures, he successfully avoided the overacting and hyperbolic gestures employed by certain of his co-stars. His Count Roberto is suave, cool, confident and diabolical, and easily steals the picture.Also included on this tape are two extra features: Valentino's scenes from the 1919 film &quot;The Eyes of Youth&quot; (he played a small role as a &quot;cabaret parasite&quot;) and a Pathe newsreel of his 1926 funeral.It all makes for an entertaining and interesting package...if you are a Valentino fan you'll love this one.
