But his wish gets thrown out the window when he goes out to a hill on behalf of the NEW WORLD club president to observe an unusual sighting, only to have Iconic pillars and other debris fall on him from the sky, including a lovely angelic form.  She introduces herself as Ikaros, a pet class angeloid, and him as her new master.  But owning this heavenly beauty might be more than he bargained for as he must now deal with a sadistic class president (is there any other type?), the president of the NEW WORLD club, his next door neighbor who despite beating him up over his perverted actions, secretly wants him to do some of those things to her, but also other angeloids who come to reclaim Ikaros as she holds a secret so powerful that it could shatter his illusions of normalcy (not that panty robots, bloomer bombs, and being turned into girl could be considered normal).WARNING:  THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.

1496020,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B005NQ5LPK,Christopher Engel,"[1, 1]","It's hard to say in a sentence what this series is about. Yeah, there's a truckload of ecchi humor full of bizarre panty situations, massive-breasted and beautiful ""pet"" angels that will do literally anything you want (don't worry, this isn't beaten around, and the main character tries the obvious wish in the very first episode). There's a great cast of characters each funny in their own unique way (the class president, the mix student who is both an emotionless fan of ecchi as well as a philosopher and scientist, and, uh, lives in the woods in a tent while commuting to school, and arguably everyone's favorite, Ikaros, the initially highly ditzy and totally emotionless servant angel that grants any wish at all--but be careful what you wish for with her), and the quickly-introduced tsundere loli angel--who happens to have an incredibly disturbing and dark past, as well as a hostility toward Ikaros. Oh yeah, and both angels initially go to school without really caring about it, and as you'd expect, their lockers are literally spilling with love letters due to how ridiculously attractive they are.A *lot* happens in every episode, so there's a ton of content packed into the brevity of only around a dozen episodes. Hell, in the first episode alone, the world ends because the main character makes an unfortunate wish with unintended consequences. Yeah, seriously. Every episode has so much content that happens at a rocketing pace, and the sense of humor remains truly excellent throughout. The writing for the dub is wonderfully natural and keeps the original's idea without sacrificing anything in the just-American-enough translation. Huge kudos to both the writers and dubbers, who do a stunningly graceful job of making everything sound perfectly natural and adding their own flavors into the mix with welcome results.Basically, this is, for the most part, a comedy anime at first--but the story, once our loli tsundere angel shows up (oddly with the name ""Nymph""), starts to get really, really dark--really, really fast. Without spoilers, the pasts of each angel, Ikaros and Nymph, respectively, are rather horrifying, particularly Nymph, who is forced to act like she enjoys constant physical and verbal abuse under her masters, who do some truly malicious and painful things to her that only escalate.It's deeper than it looks. Really, unless you just don't like ecchi humor at all or the idea of a ""pet-class angel"", this is a beautifully put together anime. It's hilarious, it's disturbing, it's original, it's got an exceptional dub, and it looks gorgeous in high-def, which can't be said for a lot of anime on Blu-ray, which truly looks little different from the DVD.Unfortunately, as everyone knows by now, season 2 of this did not get the Blu-ray treatment, which really did not go over well with people who loved the vibrant, crisp, stunningly gorgeous work done here. Nope, DVD-only at this point for season 2, which doesn't look to be changing any time soon. That's a shame beyond measure, as this is one of the few cases when Blu-ray makes a clear difference.Still, that's outside this product alone, which is worth every penny for anyone with the slightest interest in its premise. Although it does mislead a bit, as it does not stay a lighthearted comedy the whole time with your typical ""master and slave"" setup and ecchi humor, and every episode is so mind-bogglingly fast that this definitely has no issue with pacing.Truly a top-grade anime on several levels. If all you care about is the initial premise, or you just really like Ikaros and/or Nymph (who couldn't?) and can appreciate some of its more subtle humor that is not ecchi-related, you'll have no problem at all getting into this. It's definitely the best of the best in its dub, as well as in its very original comedy that never gets repetitive and is always changing.Anyone with the slightest interest at all will no doubt eat this exceptionally made anime up like candy.",5,Hilarious ecchi humor mixed with a dark story,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,3972,"['hard', 'say', 'sentence', 'what', 'series', 'Yeah', 'truckload', 'ecchi', 'humor', 'full', 'bizarre', 'panty', 'situations', 'massive-breasted', 'beautiful', 'pet', 'angels', 'will', 'do', 'literally', 'anything', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""n't"", 'beaten', 'around', 'main', 'character', 'obvious', 'wish', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'funny', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'class', 'president', 'mix', 'student', 'who', 'emotionless', 'fan', 'ecchi', 'as', 'well', 'philosopher', 'scientist', 'uh', 'woods', 'tent', 'commuting', 'school', 'arguably', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Ikaros', 'initially', 'highly', 'ditzy', 'totally', 'emotionless', 'servant', 'angel', 'wish', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'quickly-introduced', 'tsundere', 'loli', 'angel', 'who', 'have', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'dark', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'hostility', 'Ikaros', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'angels', 'initially', 'go', 'school', 'really', 'caring', ""'d"", 'expect', 'lockers', 'are', 'literally', 'spilling', 'love', 'letters', 'due', 'how', 'ridiculously', 'attractive', 'are.A', '*lot*', 'happens', 'episode', 'ton', 'content', 'packed', 'brevity', 'only', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'Hell', 'first', 'episode', 'alone', 'world', 'main', 'character', 'unfortunate', 'wish', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'Yeah', 'seriously', 'Every', 'episode', 'so', 'much', 'content', 'rocketing', 'pace', 'sense', 'humor', 'truly', 'excellent', 'writing', 'dub', 'wonderfully', 'natural', 'original', 'idea', 'sacrificing', 'anything', 'just-American-enough', 'translation', 'Huge', 'kudos', 'writers', 'dubbers', 'who', 'do', 'stunningly', 'graceful', 'job', 'making', 'everything', 'sound', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'adding', 'own', 'flavors', 'mix', 'welcome', 'results.Basically', 'most', 'part', 'comedy', 'anime', 'first', 'story', 'once', 'loli', 'tsundere', 'angel', 'up', 'oddly', 'name', 'Nymph', 'get', 'really', 'really', 'dark', 'really', 'really', 'fast', 'spoilers', 'pasts', 'angel', 'Ikaros', 'Nymph', 'respectively', 'are', 'rather', 'horrifying', 'particularly', 'Nymph', 'who', 'forced', 'act', 'constant', 'physical', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'masters', 'who', 'do', 'truly', 'malicious', 'painful', 'things', 'only', 'escalate.It', 'deeper', 'Really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ecchi', 'humor', 'idea', 'pet-class', 'angel', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together', 'anime', 'hilarious', 'disturbing', 'original', 'got', 'exceptional', 'dub', 'gorgeous', 'high-def', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'lot', 'anime', 'Blu-ray', 'truly', 'little', 'different', 'DVD.Unfortunately', 'everyone', 'now', 'season', '2', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'vibrant', 'crisp', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'work', 'done', 'here', 'Nope', 'DVD-only', 'point', 'season', '2', ""n't"", 'look', 'be', 'changing', 'time', 'soon', 'shame', 'measure', 'one', 'few', 'cases', 'when', 'Blu-ray', 'clear', 'difference.Still', 'product', 'alone', 'worth', 'penny', 'anyone', 'slightest', 'interest', 'premise', 'mislead', 'bit', 'not', 'stay', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'whole', 'time', 'typical', 'master', 'slave', 'setup', 'ecchi', 'humor', 'episode', 'so', 'mind-bogglingly', 'fast', 'definitely', 'issue', 'top-grade', 'anime', 'several', 'levels', 'care', 'initial', 'premise', 'just', 'really', 'like', 'Ikaros', 'and/or', 'Nymph', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'can', 'appreciate', 'more', 'subtle', 'humor', 'not', 'ecchi-related', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'definitely', 'best', 'best', 'dub', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'original', 'comedy', 'never', 'repetitive', 'always', 'changing.Anyone', 'slightest', 'interest', 'will', 'doubt', 'eat', 'exceptionally', 'made', 'anime', 'up', 'candy']",Heaven's Lost Property: Season 1

1496027,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B005NQ5LPK,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[1, 3]","Shows oriented towards copious amounts of fan service are a mixed bag. I say this because approximately 90% of them are dreadful wastes of space, aimed at the lowest-of-the-low demographic in order to make a few quick n' dirty bucks. Most people know to avoid these like the plague, and certainly know better than to shell out over 40 dollars for a deluxe set of them. But where does that leave the other 10%? In an interesting position, that's where. This smaller percentage contains shows that have merit (see: Sekirei), and rarely, are actually excellent shows (see: Queen's Blade.) While it falls in the former category of such shows, ""Heaven's Lost Property"" still rests squarely within that 10%.It achieves this goal by not attempting to be anything it's not. The writers (especially in the English dub) are well-aware that the very concept of this show is ludicrous wish fulfillment. Here we have an unabashedly perverted teenage boy given complete control over Ikaros, an angel that has fallen from heaven, who informs him that she can grant any desire he may have. Instead of being romantic and cheesy, yet coyly being perverted like so many male protagonists, Tomoki starts using this ability to gratify his puerile desires. These include, but are not limited to: wishing for all of the panties from girls within a multi-mile radius, turning himself invisible so he can rub naked against girls, and turning himself into girl to sneak into a bathhouse. Despite some glimmers of goodness, this protagonist is perhaps the biggest perv this side of a non-hentai title, and it's delightful to see him run amok as opposed to being forced into sitting through yet another anime where the ""hero"" is always a lovable oaf.What prevents his behavior from becoming unbearable, though, is a delightful supporting cast. Just when you begin to grow weary of Tomoki's shenanigans, his childhood friend Sohara karate chops him, or his oddball friend Eishiro goes on a long rant about discovering the elusive ""New World."" Later on, the focus falls on Ikaros, who is utterly clueless when it comes to behaving like normal human, and angelic cohort/token loli Nymph, whose condescending demeanor towards humans is always reliable for a laugh. The most standout character in my eyes, however, was class president Mikako. She is utterly grimy, delighting in causing Tomoki endless torment and routinely laughing at others' misfortunes. Unforgettably sadistic, and surprisingly versatile in the show's myriad of different situations, Mikako is in fact one of the best things about the series, mainly because you never know what she's going to do next.But unpredictability isn't exclusive to that one character in ""Heaven's Lost Property"", being one of the traits that actually defines the experience of watching the show. There are things that occur within the 13-episode confines of this show that I guarantee you will never see in another anime. I can list no other show in which panties are rigged throughout a house to serve as dangerous landmines, or where a perverted male delights so much in being turned into a girl that he begins to enjoy flirting with boys and dressing up in sultry undergarments. What prevents this from falling into the pitfalls of other ecchi series is that the writers were able to distance themselves from being remotely serious most of the time, and what occurred was like a Japanese anime equivalent of ""Benny Hill.""The operative phrase there was ""most of the time"", because near the series' climax, the direction definitely shifts in a darker direction. Some downright unpleasant images related to the Angeloid's past lives are detailed, and the focus on Ikaros' role as a world-ending tool of destruction is highlighted. While I appreciated that the show was attempting to make us feel some sense of urgency, these components fall short of their potential and ultimately stick out like a sore thumb in this otherwise lighthearted series. The last two episodes are the most guilty perpetrators of this, and seem to be comprised of tropes from a few different shows. I believe, given the sub-plot beneath the fan service and comedy, it would be fair to call ""Heaven's Lost Property"" something along the lines of ""Saikano with more boobs.""Production values are a mixed bag here. At first glance the animation looks pretty, but it quickly grows a bit too simplistic and oriented towards primary colors for my tastes. While it's nowhere near what could be classified as ""bad"", this show definitely isn't one that you watch for production values. Oddly, it seems to improve as the show gets closer to it's end, perhaps in an attempt to reverse the typical trend of letting animation slip as a series wears on. Where the visuals fail in some departments, though, an unbelievably good soundtrack picks up the slack. So many shows have merely forgettable background music, but not HLP. It was one of the rare musical treats that stands out while watching the show, and it's preceded by a really great opening theme with pretty animation. Another unique quirk here is the unique ending each episode, matching whatever theme or plot that episode followed. Overall, the audio and visual departments in this show are above average for something of this type, especially in the former's case.FUNimation's dub is one of the best parts of this show, and may be the best thing for it's overseas release. While the cast in the original JP voice track are all very talented in their own right, I felt that they were taking it a bit too seriously for it to come across as funny. This is a pitfall too many shows in this vein fall into. On the other hand, we have a truly zany dub, complete with liberal uses of profanity and slang, and little asides that actually spice up the show moreso than the original voice track. Greg Ayres as Tomoki is especially hysterical as Tomoki, showing a tender side while making him just whiny enough to make you annoyed at the right times. Not to pick favorites, but my favorite dub V.A. here is hands-down Jamie Marchi as Mikako, who takes the beautiful sadist's personality and just runs with it, riffing (and often seemingly improvising) the funniest and cruelest dialogue you can imagine. Everything from her booming laugh to honey-dripping snarl is spot-on. The one complaint I have is directed towards Brittney Karbowski, who does a serviceable job as Ikaros for the most part, but falls flat when it comes to singing. It may seem unfair to compare her to career singer and idol Saori Hayami, who took the role in the original voice track, but Karbowski's voice simply doesn't have the range or hold as much interest as Hayami's. She's a talented voice actress, actually one of my favorites, but this just isn't her best role.I picked up this show on a whim, and up until watching it, I kind of scoffed at it's fans. It took actually sitting down with it for me to come to the conclusion that, despite it's flaws, this is an enjoyable and entertaining show. Despite some dips in animation quality and the shoehorning of serious plot elements near the end as opposed to natural progression, there's nothing that would dissuade me from recommending this to anybody who doesn't take themselves too seriously and is willing to turn off their brains for a fun time. Because one can only take a show that features a giant robot comprised of exploding panties too seriously.Plot: BAnimation: B-Music: B+Dub: B+Sub: BOverall: B+",4,A Heavenly Guilty

Animes are the only shows that can show you things that are not possible in the real world, like flying angels (im not sayin they dont exist, im just saying you are not seeing them out your window all day long), or all sorts of crazy stuff happening and alot of it is really funny, infact on the 2-4 shows out of this season i believe it was, i could not stop from laughing its just what was said an what you saw that made it so funny lolAnyways to make a long story short, if you love semi-perverted almost nude angel-like chicks with wings flying around granting you anything you want including turning you from a boy to a girl to sneak into the girls locker room (which happens) then this is for you lol.

Again if you disapprove of series that fan service in them like the standard panty shots and topless nudity then pass this over as there will be a ton of it in the series and again while it doesn't pass that line into hentai scenarios it does border on it in a few scenes.  The animation and soundtrack are put together nicely and work well and the voice cast was done pretty well too for both the subbed and dubbed.

If you are not into perverted hi jinks and and Hilarious lowbrow humor, then please don't buy this. If you are, however, I recommend this. It's about a teen named Tomoki (Tomo) who is obsessed with bras, panties, and the female species. I thought this was not the show for me cause I was never into this kind of show. However my friend recommended it to my and I was hooked from the beginning. For those of you who watch the first episode and say ""this is stupid and random. where is the story?"" I will let you know there is a story. The story doesn't emerge until like episode 8 but it does get extremely good after that. Anything before episode 8 is basically setting the ground for the story to appear as well as to lay down each character's personality. It also has constant voice actors who make each characters personality pop and be unique from any other character.

It took its time and had fun with the characters.  This one also made me laugh out loud and had everything from Flying panties to Exploding panties.  If you enjoy fan service and like to laugh buy this one. If you want a serious plot dont.While light on plot the main story is there to keep the show on track (they take an episode off here or there just for fun)but its never really resolved.  I must admit season one was loads of laughs but hey I am a guy.  I will also say that this is only season one and I have already watched season 2(its even better).  Its funnier than say Rosario+Vampire(A great anime)but a little less focused on plot.  If you watch it do so for the laughs and perverted humor.It is a harem style comedy so it has girls all wanting to marry this one guy.  The main character is a likeable pervert on a mission.  He just wants peace and quiet but an angeloid falls to the earth and ruins everything. He spends most of his time peeping and groping girls and they often take revenge on him.I dont want to spoil it but the harem has 4 girls only three are in the first season.  The fourth comes in at season 2 and is more comedy relief than anything else.  So far season 2 has my two favorite episodes.  You must be a pervert to understand most of the humor so if your not dont bother.,5,Lots of Laughs,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1392,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'always', 'focused', 'replayed', 'plot', 'took', 'time', 'had', 'fun', 'characters', 'one', 'also', 'made', 'loud', 'had', 'everything', 'Flying', 'panties', 'Exploding', 'panties', 'enjoy', 'fan', 'service', 'laugh', 'buy', 'one', 'want', 'serious', 'plot', 'dont.While', 'light', 'plot', 'main', 'story', 'there', 'keep', 'show', 'track', 'take', 'episode', 'here', 'there', 'just', 'fun', 'never', 'really', 'resolved', 'must', 'admit', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'loads', 'laughs', 'hey', 'am', 'guy', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'only', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'already', 'watched', 'season', '2', 'even', 'better', 'funnier', 'say', 'Rosario+Vampire', 'A', 'great', 'anime', 'little', 'less', 'focused', 'plot', 'watch', 'do', 'so', 'laughs', 'perverted', 'humor.It', 'harem', 'style', 'comedy', 'girls', 'wanting', 'marry', 'one', 'guy', 'main', 'character', 'likeable', 'pervert', 'mission', 'just', 'peace', 'quiet', 'angeloid', 'earth', 'everything', 'most', 'time', 'peeping', 'groping', 'girls', 'often', 'take', 'revenge', 'him.I', 'dont', 'want', 'spoil', 'harem', '4', 'girls', 'only', 'three', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'fourth', 'season', '2', 'more', 'comedy', 'relief', 'anything', 'else', 'So', 'far', 'season', '2', 'two', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'must', 'be', 'pervert', 'understand', 'most', 'humor', 'so', 'not', 'dont', 'bother']",Heaven's Lost Property: Season 1

It is not something a person would want to just tune into to fill a day without looking into first. That said, it is really funny and definitely worth watching.On some levels, this show has a linear plot line that can progress from episode to episode. It deals with an angel and the boy she belongs to and her ability to give him anything he wants. Did I mention he is really, really, obsessed with females and their undergarments? Well, that comes up a lot, as does his connection to his childhood friend/neighbor/possible love interest. There are two other characters as well, the class president and the boy who wants to fly, and another angel evening out a cast that adds a lot to the humor.Here's an example of a plot line, to see if it is something you would watch, noting this is done with humor but that it also involves some nudity and crass comments/suggestions. Having caused an issue with his angel that ended up causing a flock of flying lady's undergarments, our main ends up with a home filled with colors that the growing boy covets. His neighbor, not thrilled, asks the angel for help and gets her to make any of these our main looks at to explode. This leads to a lot of issues for him considering how the put them on everything, walls, lines, even the goldfish. (wording chosen so not to be edited)You also have a more serious portion of the show that deals with the angel and its original intent. It was apparently quite the killer in the past and Heaven wants it back. Apparently many male angels are sadists, too, and they send another angle to retrieve the first. This storyline brings some violence to the show, and it also makes one understand even more why this type of angel exists.5/5, just be aware of the type of show you're getting. also, get this on bluRay while its around because it is definitely much better to watch, with a lot better sound than the SD format.",5,"Heaven's Lost Property, Season 1",1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1988,"['really', 'liked', 'show', 'humor', 'very', 'lowbrow', 'plots', 'get', 'really', 'dirty', 'not', 'something', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'just', 'tune', 'fill', 'day', 'looking', 'first', 'said', 'really', 'funny', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.On', 'levels', 'show', 'linear', 'plot', 'line', 'can', 'progress', 'episode', 'episode', 'angel', 'boy', 'ability', 'give', 'anything', 'Did', 'mention', 'really', 'really', 'obsessed', 'females', 'undergarments', 'Well', 'up', 'lot', 'connection', 'childhood', 'friend/neighbor/possible', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'class', 'president', 'boy', 'who', 'fly', 'angel', 'evening', 'out', 'cast', 'lot', 'humor.Here', 'example', 'plot', 'line', 'see', 'something', 'would', 'watch', 'noting', 'done', 'humor', 'also', 'nudity', 'crass', 'comments/suggestions', 'Having', 'caused', 'issue', 'angel', 'ended', 'up', 'causing', 'flock', 'flying', 'lady', 'undergarments', 'main', 'up', 'home', 'filled', 'colors', 'growing', 'boy', 'covets', 'neighbor', 'not', 'thrilled', 'angel', 'help', 'make', 'main', 'looks', 'explode', 'lot', 'issues', 'considering', 'how', 'put', 'everything', 'walls', 'lines', 'even', 'goldfish', 'wording', 'chosen', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'edited', 'also', 'have', 'more', 'serious', 'portion', 'show', 'deals', 'angel', 'original', 'intent', 'was', 'apparently', 'quite', 'killer', 'past', 'Heaven', 'back', 'Apparently', 'many', 'male', 'angels', 'are', 'sadists', 'too', 'send', 'angle', 'retrieve', 'first', 'storyline', 'violence', 'show', 'also', 'one', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'why', 'type', 'angel', 'exists.5/5', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'type', 'show', ""'re"", 'getting', 'also', 'get', 'bluRay', 'definitely', 'much', 'better', 'watch', 'lot', 'better', 'sound', 'SD', 'format']",Heaven's Lost Property: Season 1
