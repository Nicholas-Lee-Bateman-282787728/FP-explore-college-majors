However, I was a little confused to see that a majority of bronies hated every last second of this season, and I don't know why. There are several possibilities:Maybe the fans were mad that this season only had thirteen episodes while the others have twenty-six.Maybe the fans were spoiled by the finale of the second season that they expected the show to go into an action/adventure direction.Maybe the fans just hate wings.I don't know, but if you ask me, I love this season. When it comes to cartoons, I expect them to get better with each season. I love to see the characters get further dissected when it comes to their depth. I love to see characters that haven't gotten development to actually get some. And, I love to see the show try out episodes that haven't been done before. This season not only did all three of those, but it did them well.A few of the highlights of this season include Scootaloo finally getting her own episode that involves campfire stories keeping her awake.Another one involves Spike agreeing to take care of the Mane Six's pets while they're away, but it doesn't go the way he plans it to go.Finally, fan favorite character Discord makes his return to the series as Fluttershy attempts to turn him into a noble character.That's just a small amount of the goodness this season has to offer. In my opinion, the only dud episode is Spike At Your Service, but the rest of the season's episodes make up for it.So, if you're a fan of the show, it still has all of the elements that made you fall in love with it in the first place. Just as long as you're not expecting it to become an action show, and characters growing wings doesn't bother you, then you're going to love this season. It's quite possibly the best season of this show that you're going to buy... That is, until the fourth season comes out on DVD.",5,A Criminally Underrated Season,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2022,"['Fanbases', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'minority', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'show', 'became', 'favorite', 'three', 'season', 'finale', 'aired', 'However', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'see', 'majority', 'bronies', 'hated', 'last', 'second', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'several', 'possibilities', 'Maybe', 'fans', 'were', 'mad', 'season', 'only', 'had', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'others', 'have', 'twenty-six.Maybe', 'fans', 'were', 'spoiled', 'finale', 'second', 'season', 'expected', 'show', 'go', 'action/adventure', 'fans', 'just', 'hate', 'wings.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ask', 'love', 'season', 'When', 'cartoons', 'expect', 'get', 'better', 'season', 'love', 'see', 'characters', 'get', 'further', 'dissected', 'when', 'depth', 'love', 'see', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'development', 'actually', 'get', 'love', 'see', 'show', 'try', 'out', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'three', 'did', 'well.A', 'few', 'highlights', 'season', 'include', 'Scootaloo', 'finally', 'getting', 'own', 'episode', 'campfire', 'stories', 'keeping', 'awake.Another', 'one', 'Spike', 'agreeing', 'take', 'care', 'Mane', 'Six', 'pets', ""'re"", 'away', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'go.Finally', 'fan', 'favorite', 'character', 'Discord', 'return', 'series', 'Fluttershy', 'turn', 'noble', 'character.That', 'just', 'small', 'amount', 'goodness', 'season', 'offer', 'opinion', 'only', 'dud', 'episode', 'Spike', 'Your', 'Service', 'rest', 'season', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'it.So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'still', 'elements', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'place', 'Just', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'become', 'action', 'show', 'characters', 'growing', 'wings', ""n't"", 'bother', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'season', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'season', 'show', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'fourth', 'season', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

Twilight Sparkle is this 30 year old woman's favorite character and I was delighted with all of her character development, A TON of which is seen in the Crystal Empire episodes, and then in the Magical Mystery Cure. I was VERY happy with her becoming a Princess and have always thought Twilight was more worthy of being a Princess than Cadance was. We pretty much had no idea who Cadance was, and I couldn't see how she could be worth of being a Princess when a REAL Princess was standing right in front of her in Twilight Sparkle. I practically jumped for joy when Twilight spread her wings for the first time, and her coronation was probably my favorite scene in the entire series. There ARE a few bad episodes, but the overall plot and the ending make up for anything bad. All TV shows have their bad episodes. Supernatural is still my favorite TV show and the entirety of season 9 has been nothing but trash.

1678552,ALQ1Y3KGEKZIR,B00GJ7CTSE,Gen. Quon,"[10, 18]","This season was OK. It had some really, really solid episodes. I particularly thought &#34;Magic Duel&#34;, &#34;Wonderbolts Academy&#34;, &#34;Sleepless in Ponyville&#34;, &#34;Too Many Pinkie Pies&#34;, and &#34;Apple Family Reunion&#34; were fantastic. I fact, I think &#34;Sleepless in Ponyville&#34; is my absolute favorite episode of the entire series. However, these really solid episodes were equally balanced with what I thought were some generic or not very interesting other episodes. We got two (count 'em, two) Spike episodes, whereas Rarity didn't get any. Also, both the season openers and the season finale were a let-down compared to the second season. The openers introduced a new, bland villain, and a plot that was nowhere near as interesting as the series premiere or the introduction of Discord. Similarly, the season finale (regardless of your opinion) was both rushed and too crammed with songs. It would have worked better as a two parter. I know part of this problem was the fact that the season is only 13 episodes, but it is a legitimate critique. &#34;Keep Calm and Flutter On&#34;, featuring the return of fan-favorite villain Discord, was also a victim of rushing, and its ending did not feel entirely earned, nor... right I guess is the word. Something seemed off.With that being said, every show has the one &#34;meh&#34; seasons, and I think this is MLP:FiM's season. So far, from what I've seen, the fourth season is much better. I don't mind the Twilight transformation either, but I can understand where some people would think that its a detractor. In some ways, the season finale would've made a great series finale, but alas, this is not the case.Pick this up if you are brony/super-fan, or if you have kids that really dig it.

XD For those of you who grew up with Saturday morning cartoons you know what I'm talking about: Pokemon, Yugioh, Medabots, Ed Edd and Eddy, etc 90s cartoons, which in my opinion have become almost non-existent nowadays in terms of quality of dialogue, background music, character personality and such. Heck, don't get me wrong I've tried to get into some of the new cartoons nowadays like Adventure Time and Regular Show and others but they all lack character depth and audience attachment, the what I call the &#34;relate-ability factor&#34;. Sure they are cool characters, but I don't really find myself caring for them as much the jokes are super random for my taste, some plain stupid, and others I'm like, what? In short the humor is based off forced sarcasm or plain meanness. I just watch and get a laugh that's it. Then there are those once in a blue moon cartoons like Friendship is Magic that truly make you wonder what happened to cartoons as of late. This is how a cartoon should be done.The best way I could describe Friendship is Magic is like a perfect blend of anime, 90s cartoons, with a hint of disney. For me characterization depth is a worth it's weight in gold and quite frankly the ponies have got it in fact the whole cast has it, try to wrap your head around that. As a college dude, that's now a senior this cartoon made feel like that 10 year old boy who watched Pokemon for the first time in awe.It amazes me how the characterizations of the mane 6 are so lifelike it's almost as though they were real girls. What amazed me further is that at some points I see a little bit of myself in all 6 of them, Twilight being the frame of my personality.All in all, when I found out there were a whole group of global fans called Bronies who are dedicated to this show, I wasn't surprised to see that they were all about my age.

While a few episodes like Too Many Pinkie Pies and Magic Duel  I thought to be just okay it did have many  wonderful episodes in this season like Wonderbolt Academy, Stay Calm and Flutter on, Just For Sidekicks, Sleepless in Ponyville  and Magical Mystery Cure to name a few.  Think interesting this time around they packaging lists the episodes on the outside back of the case rather than inside like the first two seasons.  The inside map of Equestria is most interesting.  Think the comic con bonus section on this set was much more interesting than on the previous season. Only took a star off because the season was so short and that some of the episodes didn't meet in my opition the standards of most of the Friendship is magic.",4,like it flaws and all,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,806,"['Not', 'as', 'good', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'even', 'recently', 'started', 'season', '4', 'few', 'episodes', 'Too', 'Many', 'Pinkie', 'Pies', 'Magic', 'Duel', 'thought', 'be', 'just', 'did', 'have', 'many', 'wonderful', 'episodes', 'season', 'Wonderbolt', 'Academy', 'Stay', 'Calm', 'Flutter', 'Just', 'Sidekicks', 'Sleepless', 'Ponyville', 'Magical', 'Mystery', 'Cure', 'name', 'few', 'Think', 'interesting', 'time', 'packaging', 'episodes', 'outside', 'back', 'case', 'rather', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'inside', 'map', 'Equestria', 'most', 'interesting', 'Think', 'comic', 'con', 'bonus', 'section', 'set', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'previous', 'season', 'Only', 'took', 'star', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'opition', 'standards', 'most', 'Friendship', 'magic']",N/A

The third season is where I really fell off the pony bandwagon; it lost all of its wonder and amazement for me. Most of the episodes felt forced and it just lacked what made the first two seasons magical. I guess with the lackluster Villain in the season opener, and the last episode, which could have easily been a 2-3 part arc, was crammed into one episode, this whole season seemed rushed and gave me the impression it lost touch with what it originally had.Not bad, not great, just&#8230;.

1678564,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B00GJ7CTSE,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[12, 63]","This season was a big disappointment. I am going to try and keep things short and sweet since there are plenty of places to look if you want a thorough dissection of why Season 3 was bad, but really I think the box art speaks for itself. A poorly photoshopped pair of wings appears to be coming out of Twilight Sparkle's butt.The season finale was one of the worst episodes of a TV show I can remember, although it was really a culmination of everything that had gone wrong with the show ever since Lauren Faust and Rob Renzetti left the staff. Meghan McCarthy unfortunately just plain is not that good of a showrunner, and the Hasbro corporate mandates are slapped on pretty thick here. An entire new country is introduced, and it serves no in-show purpose other than being an alternate skin of Ponyville with less personality (it's purpose in the meta sense is obviously to sell toys). There is no shortage of ""idiot ball"" episodes this season, especially considering how short it is, and the episodes that actually have character development all seem to reach for the lowest hanging fruit-- i.e., in Season 1, character X wants to be friends with character Y, and in season 3 it happens. Some of the worst parts are when the season actually tries to be ""clever"" and ""creative,"" and the final episode was the worst offender in that regard.Overall, this season made me wish that I had stopped watching after Season 2, and anything worse I can say about it would be beating a dead horse. Between this and the movie, I came to the decision that I was better off skipping Season 4 entirely and just enjoying the two seasons of MLP that I actually liked for what they were.",2,Why jump the shark when you can grow wings?,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1670,"['season', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'keep', 'things', 'short', 'sweet', 'are', 'plenty', 'places', 'look', 'want', 'thorough', 'dissection', 'why', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'bad', 'really', 'think', 'box', 'art', 'speaks', 'poorly', 'photoshopped', 'pair', 'wings', 'be', 'coming', 'Twilight', 'Sparkle', 'butt.The', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'remember', 'was', 'really', 'culmination', 'everything', 'had', 'gone', 'wrong', 'show', 'ever', 'Lauren', 'Faust', 'Rob', 'Renzetti', 'left', 'staff', 'Meghan', 'McCarthy', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'plain', 'not', 'good', 'showrunner', 'Hasbro', 'corporate', 'mandates', 'are', 'slapped', 'pretty', 'thick', 'here', 'entire', 'new', 'country', 'introduced', 'in-show', 'purpose', 'other', 'being', 'alternate', 'skin', 'Ponyville', 'less', 'personality', 'purpose', 'meta', 'sense', 'obviously', 'sell', 'toys', 'shortage', 'idiot', 'ball', 'season', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'short', 'episodes', 'actually', 'have', 'character', 'development', 'seem', 'reach', 'lowest', 'hanging', 'fruit', 'i.e.', 'Season', '1', 'character', 'X', 'be', 'friends', 'character', 'Y', 'season', '3', 'worst', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'season', 'actually', 'be', 'clever', 'creative', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'worst', 'offender', 'regard.Overall', 'season', 'made', 'wish', 'had', 'stopped', 'watching', 'Season', '2', 'anything', 'worse', 'can', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'Between', 'movie', 'came', 'decision', 'was', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'Season', '4', 'entirely', 'just', 'enjoying', 'two', 'seasons', 'MLP', 'actually', 'liked', 'what', 'were']",N/A
