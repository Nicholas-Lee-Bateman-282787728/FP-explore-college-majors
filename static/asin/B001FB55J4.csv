Families were rounded up. A few escaped into the woods for safety. They shared scarce food. One man gets his revenge [but doesn't acquire arms or food]. More bad news arrives. The Bielski's become active in the resistance and learn from experience. They must survive and build shelters in the woods. More arrive. There is dissension, some will join another group of partisans. Tuvias asks people to flee into the woods. A watchmaker becomes a gunsmith. Women will learn to shoot. The group lives deep in the forest, snow is falling. Tuvia gets more food.A young lady meets a wolf while carrying food. They requisition medicines from a police station. Tuvia develops a cough, but he is still in charge. A German officer is captured [believable?] and suffers his fate. There is a threat of a German attack, they will leave for a new location. An enemy airplane drops bombs. Some remain as a rearguard until they are overwhelmed. They pass across the swamp to safety [recalling the Red Sea]. ""Keep moving!"" An enemy tank and soldiers show up. It looks bad until help shows up. They continue to retreat into the forest. They built a new camp and were joined by new people over the next two years. The last scenes tell of their future. They never sought recognition for those they saved.This motion picture is based in part upon actual events and people. Certain actions and characters were dramatized, some are entirely fictitious. The purpose is to tell a story about one part of history.

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[7, 8]","This brilliant movie tells the true story of the Bielski partisans -- a band of Jewish survivors who hid in the forests of Belorussia during World War II and fought the Nazis.It comes with all the bells and whistles of a classic war movie but it's so much more that that -- this is a movie with many important moral messages to impart about survival, commmunity, human dignity and resistance.Daniel Craig gives a powerful performance as Tuvia Bielski, the group's leader -- all the more powerful for its understatement. Liev Schreiber is just as good as his brother Zus, who wants only to fight and kill to avenge the awful personal losses the family has endured.If this were only a movie about men fighting a vastly superior force, it would be incredible enough. But Tuvia Bielski opened his camp to all survivors -- the old, the young, the sick, women, children. No-one was turned away. It's amazing to contemplate how they survived two bitter Russian winters with little or no food. Yet by the time of the liberation, they were running a school in the middle of the forest.Incredibly, the brothers managed to save the lives of 1,200 people. Today, some 19,000 people are alive who would not have been were it not for their heroism.There are many exciting battle scenes and tender love scenes and interesting secondary characters -- but the central metaphor comes when the band of refugees is forced to flee German armor and air power and find themselves wading through a massive swamp, holding on to each other's belts. It's an image that looks back to the exodus from Egypt -- although one of the brothers states that God will not save them this time and will not part the waters. Only by employing their own strength, determination and persistence will they survive.In another painful scene, a German soldier is captured and then bludgeoned to death. Tuvia Bielski does not try to intervene. He understands that although he aspires to a higher moral standard, the cry for revenge among people who have been reduced by their enemies to animals, have been mistreated, humiliated and degraded and have seen their loved ones massacred cannot be appeased without blood. It is also an acknowledgment that to fight a monstrous force like Nazi Germany, a certain brutal ruthlessness is sometimes required.The extra features on this DVD include interviews with family members of the Bielskis, who went on to build lives in the United States and some haunting photographs of survivors by director Edward Zwick.See this movie.

After avenging the deaths of his parents, Tuvia tries to adopt a less violent approach to survival, which brings him into conflict with his brother Zus (Live Schreiber) who would much rather shoot first and think later.Another brother Asael (Jamie Bell) seems to be the shy and unassuming brother, until he steals the show by (1) getting married and (2) picking up the mantle of leadership when it was most needed.  The fourth brother Aron doesn't have much to say or do in this story.Essentially a story of desperate survival, there are also elements of romance, pride and humanity, which coupled with the adversities of the situation, make for a dark but compelling movie.Amanda Richards, January 25, 2009",4,"The woods are lovely, dark and deep....",1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,1402,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', '1941', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Poland', 'area', 'now', 'part', 'Belarus', '2', 'German', 'baddies', 'go', 'business', 'collecting', 'Jewish', 'people', 'ghettoes', 'eliminating', 'immediately3', 'Four', 'brothers', 'survive', 'head', 'forest,4', 'where', 'stay,5', 'entire', 'movie,6', 'enduring', 'terrible', 'hardship,7', 'joined', 'other', 'survivors,8', 'interact', 'group', 'Soviet', 'partisans.9', 'story.Daniel', 'Craig', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'historical', 'figure', 'Polish', 'Jewish', 'ancestry', 'who', 'shepherded', 'flock', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'times', 'hunger', 'cold', 'grief', 'persecution', 'while', 'hiding', 'constantly', 'growing', 'group', 'Naliboki', 'forest', 'avenging', 'deaths', 'parents', 'Tuvia', 'adopt', 'less', 'violent', 'approach', 'survival', 'conflict', 'brother', 'Zus', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'who', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'shoot', 'first', 'think', 'later.Another', 'brother', 'Asael', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'be', 'shy', 'unassuming', 'brother', 'show', '1', 'getting', 'married', '2', 'picking', 'up', 'mantle', 'leadership', 'when', 'was', 'most', 'needed', 'fourth', 'brother', 'Aron', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'do', 'story.Essentially', 'story', 'desperate', 'survival', 'are', 'also', 'elements', 'romance', 'pride', 'humanity', 'coupled', 'adversities', 'situation', 'make', 'dark', 'compelling', 'movie.Amanda', 'Richards', 'January', '25', '2009']",N/A

1190255,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B001FB55J4,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","This is a very crowded genre with a particular set of historical and political sensitivities that all place unusual, and somewhat atypical demands and expectations on a film. Many films have come before, some with unsurpassable results (e.g., Schindler's List), and the story told is obviously one of the most tragic of the modern era, so if you're going to make another Holocaust-related film, it better be outstanding (unless it purposely shatters all genre paradigms (i.e., Inglorious Basterds).  That said, I don't think this movie rises to that level.  Granted, the movie approaches the topic from a generally fresh perspective of a group of jews attempting to evade persecution by hiding out in the woods.  I can't vouch for the historical veracity of the film's story, but, assuming its true, its a compelling story of the human will and drive to survive. But while the story succeeds at the macro level, it does not succeed at the micro level.  While the high level depiction of a large group of people's attempts to survive are compelling, the story fails to develop a connection with individual characters that would otherwise turn this movie into something more powerful. Life experiences at the aggregate level are played at the expense of the individual story. Perhaps what I'm struggling to describe is my perception of poor character development.  For example, Daniel Craig comes to be the leader of a particular group of jews, but his rise to that role is not well depicted.  He starts out adamantly opposed to assuming responsibility for a group of people, only to quickly find himself gladly filling that role.  Then in another vein, he opposes brutality (especially in not condoning his brother's behavior), but then does not hesitate to execute one of his group for insubordination.  Now, perhaps this is all a faithful depiction of Daniel Craig's character, but the way the story unfolds, it leaves lots of character development gaps that would otherwise help bridge the viewer from the pacifist survivalist Craig to the person he becomes.  The same goes for his brother; they were generally getting along, but then one day the brother gets a love interest, Daniel Craig makes a quip, then get into a fight, and then the brother joins a Communist militia-like unit. Huh?  Again, perhaps the story is accurate, but its likely missing some key information that would otherwise enable the viewer to understand why the characters evolve as they do, and breathe a little more life into them. So in the end, its certainly worth a rental, but my caution would be to not expect a colossally moving epic.",3,"Good, not great",1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,2616,"['very', 'crowded', 'genre', 'particular', 'set', 'historical', 'political', 'sensitivities', 'place', 'unusual', 'somewhat', 'atypical', 'demands', 'expectations', 'film', 'Many', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'unsurpassable', 'results', 'e.g.', 'Schindler', 'List', 'story', 'told', 'obviously', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'modern', 'era', 'so', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'Holocaust-related', 'film', 'better', 'be', 'outstanding', 'purposely', 'genre', 'paradigms', 'i.e.', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'level', 'Granted', 'movie', 'topic', 'generally', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'group', 'jews', 'attempting', 'evade', 'persecution', 'hiding', 'out', 'woods', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'historical', 'veracity', 'film', 'story', 'assuming', 'true', 'compelling', 'story', 'human', 'will', 'drive', 'survive', 'story', 'macro', 'level', 'not', 'succeed', 'micro', 'level', 'high', 'level', 'depiction', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'attempts', 'survive', 'are', 'compelling', 'story', 'develop', 'connection', 'individual', 'characters', 'would', 'otherwise', 'turn', 'movie', 'something', 'more', 'powerful', 'Life', 'experiences', 'aggregate', 'level', 'are', 'played', 'expense', 'individual', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'what', ""'m"", 'struggling', 'describe', 'perception', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'be', 'leader', 'particular', 'group', 'jews', 'rise', 'role', 'not', 'well', 'depicted', 'out', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'assuming', 'responsibility', 'group', 'people', 'only', 'quickly', 'find', 'gladly', 'filling', 'role', 'Then', 'vein', 'brutality', 'especially', 'not', 'condoning', 'brother', 'behavior', 'then', 'not', 'hesitate', 'execute', 'one', 'group', 'insubordination', 'Now', 'perhaps', 'faithful', 'depiction', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'character', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds', 'lots', 'character', 'development', 'gaps', 'would', 'otherwise', 'help', 'bridge', 'viewer', 'pacifist', 'survivalist', 'Craig', 'person', 'same', 'brother', 'were', 'generally', 'getting', 'along', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'brother', 'love', 'interest', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'quip', 'then', 'get', 'fight', 'then', 'brother', 'Communist', 'militia-like', 'unit', 'Huh', 'Again', 'perhaps', 'story', 'accurate', 'likely', 'missing', 'key', 'information', 'would', 'otherwise', 'enable', 'viewer', 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'evolve', 'do', 'breathe', 'little', 'more', 'life', 'So', 'end', 'certainly', 'rental', 'caution', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'expect', 'colossally', 'moving', 'epic']",N/A
1190256,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B001FB55J4,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 3]","A very interesting film about the real life story of the four Bielski brothers, who after barely escaping the massacre of their family by the Germans in Belorussia during World War II, moved to the nearby forest and formed a Jewish militia. Soon many more refugees join in (including women, children and elderly people) and the group reached the low thousands. With some aid from the Soviets, they successfully survived the war and even fought back in a number of occasions the German attacks (though apparently they did not engage in combat in real life as much as it appears in the film, very wisely, given the disproportion of forces between the two sides). Daniel Craig is a perfect in the role of Tuvia Bielski, who as the elder of the brothers was the commander of the militias. Much of the humor in the movie comes in the contrast between the tough guy nature of the two elder Bielski brothers and the far more intellectual demeanor of the rest of the group, most of them urban professional types who for the first time in their life have to learn how to survive in the forest. Though the film is somewhat conventional in its narrative, it is nevertheless both fascinating and beguiling. The beautiful, haunting forest where they hid is another attraction to the movie (the film was shot in Lithuania, next door to Belorussia where the action took place). It is somewhat surprising this story was never brought to the screen in sixty something years (this probably have to do with the low profile that the Bielski brothers choose for themselves after the war as well as for the fact that their alliance with the Red Army made their saga somewhat politically uncomfortable during the Cold War).",4,"Well made film about fascinating, little known story",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,1700,"['very', 'interesting', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'four', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'who', 'barely', 'escaping', 'massacre', 'family', 'Germans', 'Belorussia', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'moved', 'nearby', 'forest', 'formed', 'Jewish', 'militia', 'Soon', 'many', 'more', 'refugees', 'join', 'including', 'women', 'children', 'elderly', 'people', 'group', 'reached', 'low', 'thousands', 'aid', 'Soviets', 'successfully', 'survived', 'war', 'even', 'fought', 'back', 'number', 'occasions', 'German', 'attacks', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'engage', 'combat', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'very', 'wisely', 'given', 'disproportion', 'forces', 'two', 'sides', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'perfect', 'role', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'who', 'elder', 'brothers', 'was', 'commander', 'militias', 'Much', 'humor', 'movie', 'contrast', 'tough', 'guy', 'nature', 'two', 'elder', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'far', 'more', 'intellectual', 'demeanor', 'rest', 'group', 'most', 'urban', 'professional', 'types', 'who', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'forest', 'film', 'somewhat', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'nevertheless', 'fascinating', 'beguiling', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'forest', 'where', 'hid', 'attraction', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Lithuania', 'next', 'door', 'Belorussia', 'where', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'brought', 'screen', 'sixty', 'something', 'years', 'probably', 'have', 'do', 'low', 'profile', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'choose', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'alliance', 'Red', 'Army', 'made', 'saga', 'somewhat', 'politically', 'uncomfortable', 'Cold', 'War']",N/A

1190268,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001FB55J4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","Hidden amongst the multiple film histories that litter the movies, occasionally you'll find a gem of a story that surprises the hell out of you. And DEFIANCE is definitely one of those. Based on the real-life story of the Bielski brothers who helped hide and save over 1,000 Jews from the Nazi death camps, this story is told in an unflinching narrative with brutal acts alongside those of extreme courage.We often hear that reality can be stranger (and grander) than fiction, and here this holds doubly true. For not only did the Bielski brothers do this amazing ordeal, they also didn't ask for any recognition, reward, or medals. They married and immigrated after WW II ended and decided to live out quiet lives in their little corners of the world (with the exception of one brother who was conscripted into the Soviet army and died in battle).But fate has a strange way of finding heroes, and this time was no exception. A documentary in 2006 entitled The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods was aired on the History Channel, and two books about them can easily be found, too. As word of what they'd done passed down through generations of survivors (now numbering in the tens of thousands), Hollywood took notice and sought out their history. Not having to embellish much (if at all) this incredible story, a screenplay was rapidly approved, director Ed Zwick (BLOOD DIAMOND) attached, and the rest is ...well ...history.Daniel Craig (Quantum of Solace) takes the lead role as brother Tuvia, a man with a military past and Jewish roots. When his parents and friends are killed by Nazi hunters and sympathizers, Tuvia and brothers Zus (Liev Schreiber,The Painted Veil), Asael (Jamie Bell,King Kong, 2005), and young Aron (George MacKay) head into the woods for safety. But vengeance versus fear drives what will come next. Tuvia kills his parents' murderers and then ducks deeper into the forests around Belarus. And with him comes other Jews fleeing the Nazi slaughters. Playing a game of hide-and-seek with their tormentors, The Bielski brothers and their followers didn't just cower in fear, but stood up and launched occasional attacks against the German troops. But their greatest victory was surviving and thriving in their forest hideouts. By wars end, they had not only survived, but multiplied and thrived.Fascinating.To this day, I often wonder if Hitler is turning over in his grave over this. I think he is. And what a wonderful form of revenge that is. Not because it took some violence on the Jews part to achieve it, but because violence wasn't their primary goal. It was survival. Surviving ""The Final Solution"" was the one thing Hitler most certainly wouldn't have wanted. And not only did the Bielski brothers and their followers achieve it, they added to their numbers. Sweet revenge!Daniel Craig does a superb job as Tuvia, including a very believable accent. As does Liev Schreiber as his embittered brother Zus. In fact, I can't think of a single actor/actress that didn't live up to their part in this film.

The look and feel of the film were also above my expectations with believable visuals in both the forest rural settings and towns.

I finished the film feeling that I had seen a great film. The film is complex and multiple issues are explored, but it is a testament to the director, writers, cinematographers, and actors that it comes together in a powerful multi-layered statement.One theme that is addressed is Jewish resistance to the Holocaust. We are here offered an account of resistance to this horror. A second theme is the competition between brothers, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who respond in different ways to the horror that has been imposed on them and thus respond in different ways to the call of leadership when either hiding refugees in the Byelorussian forest or searching for Nazis with an advance of the Red Army. A third theme, which is carefully developed throughout the film, is that of leadership. Tuvia Bielski plays a Moses figure, leading the people through a wilderness and maintaining order and calm under terrible conditions. Frequently in the film I thought of the Exodus and the Jewish people struggling in the wilderness.In addition to showing the resistance of some Jewish communities, the film also shows the heartless collaboration of local communities once invaded by the Nazis. The Nazis had collaborators and honesty about this is a strength of the film.Overall the film is excellent entertainment which explores terrible events in human history and points to some of the honor and courage and intelligence required to outlive the terror and survive.",4,Jewish resistance and heroism in the face of evil,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,1544,"['ambitious', 'film', 'excellent', 'multiple', 'themes', 'interwoven', 'strong', 'narrative', 'finished', 'film', 'feeling', 'had', 'seen', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'complex', 'multiple', 'issues', 'are', 'explored', 'testament', 'director', 'writers', 'cinematographers', 'actors', 'together', 'powerful', 'multi-layered', 'statement.One', 'theme', 'addressed', 'Jewish', 'resistance', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'here', 'offered', 'account', 'resistance', 'horror', 'second', 'theme', 'competition', 'brothers', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'Bielski', 'who', 'respond', 'different', 'ways', 'horror', 'been', 'imposed', 'thus', 'respond', 'different', 'ways', 'call', 'leadership', 'when', 'hiding', 'refugees', 'Byelorussian', 'forest', 'searching', 'Nazis', 'advance', 'Red', 'Army', 'A', 'third', 'theme', 'carefully', 'developed', 'film', 'leadership', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'Moses', 'figure', 'leading', 'people', 'wilderness', 'maintaining', 'order', 'calm', 'terrible', 'conditions', 'Frequently', 'film', 'thought', 'Exodus', 'Jewish', 'people', 'struggling', 'wilderness.In', 'addition', 'showing', 'resistance', 'Jewish', 'communities', 'film', 'also', 'heartless', 'collaboration', 'local', 'communities', 'once', 'invaded', 'Nazis', 'Nazis', 'had', 'collaborators', 'honesty', 'strength', 'film.Overall', 'film', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'terrible', 'events', 'human', 'history', 'points', 'honor', 'courage', 'intelligence', 'required', 'outlive', 'terror', 'survive']",N/A
1190283,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B001FB55J4,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[0, 0]","One wonders why it took so long for the story of the Bielski brothers, sensible and steady Tuvia (Daniel Craig), hot-headed Zus (Live Schreiber) and peace-maker Asael (Jamie Bell) and their partisan band, who hid out in the forests of Belarus during World War II. Eventually, the brothers gathered to them a self-sufficient band of refugees from the nearby Jewish ghetto of Stankiewicze - that part of Poland taken over by the Soviets at the beginning of the war. Eventually, the Nazis and their `final solution' came to the Bielski's home; the older brothers were already living in the woods, and in the very first scenes of the movie, they return to find their parents dead, and their youngest brothers hiding in a makeshift bunker under a haystack.The movie outlines the growth of the Bielski partisans and the clash between the two brothers. Only relatively small portions of the band were active fighters; the focus as Tuvia sees it, is to protect their people, their fellow Jews; their surviving friends and neighbors, and those whom he has managed to convince him to leave the dubious shelter of the ghetto and follow him into the woods. Tuvia resorts to banditry and violence when pressed, to feed and supply those whom he has taken responsibility for; he will also take swift revenge on the family of the Polish collaborator responsible for killing his parents. Zus just wants to kill Nazis: he will go and fight with a Soviet-led partisan band, rather than shepherd a miserable band of town-bred intellectuals through a brutal winter in the woods.An excellent touch in this movie is the realistic way that life in the forest is depicted: not just as a sort of long-term experience of camping out in the summer - when the woods are beautiful, misty green -  but also the having to endure brutal near-Siberian winters. It is made very clear that existence then is one long misery, of dirt, semi-starvation and cold. The move itself was filmed not fifty miles away from where it all took place, in a similar forested setting. Refreshingly and realistically also, the characters generally appear unkempt, ragged and dirty, and the males indifferently shaven for much of the movie. And the occasional explosions during the moments of combat are realistically understated; no spectacular fiery clouds.The one aspect lacking in this account is some kind of explanation of why Tuvia and his brothers were adept as leaders, and so well-disposed to hiding out in the woods in the first place. It might have been a bit more artful in the story-telling to have set up a bit more of the Bielski's back-story, to have shown a bit more of what they were doing before the war, of their milieu as small farmers, on the edge of the woods, and gone into a little more of their personal losses. Tuvia and Zus are depicted as being in their thirties, after all; they would have had meaningful adult lives, careers, wives and children. Briefly revealing those elements, instead of just a bare mention in brief dialog would have added an extra dimension to the story. It appears that Tuvia had served in the Polish Army, and that as the war ramped up, he and Zus may have been active as smugglers - which would account for them being in the woods in the first place, and disinclined to cooperate with law and order in the second. All in all, an interesting movie venture in telling a relatively unknown story.",4,Still Life in the Forest With Partisans,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,3396,"['One', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'story', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'sensible', 'steady', 'Tuvia', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'hot-headed', 'Zus', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'peace-maker', 'Asael', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'partisan', 'band', 'who', 'hid', 'out', 'forests', 'Belarus', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Eventually', 'brothers', 'gathered', 'self-sufficient', 'band', 'refugees', 'nearby', 'Jewish', 'ghetto', 'Stankiewicze', 'part', 'Poland', 'taken', 'over', 'Soviets', 'beginning', 'war', 'Eventually', 'Nazis', 'final', 'solution', 'came', 'Bielski', 'home', 'older', 'brothers', 'were', 'already', 'living', 'woods', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'return', 'find', 'parents', 'dead', 'youngest', 'brothers', 'hiding', 'makeshift', 'bunker', 'haystack.The', 'movie', 'growth', 'Bielski', 'partisans', 'clash', 'two', 'brothers', 'Only', 'relatively', 'small', 'portions', 'band', 'were', 'active', 'fighters', 'focus', 'Tuvia', 'protect', 'people', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'surviving', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'whom', 'managed', 'convince', 'leave', 'dubious', 'shelter', 'ghetto', 'follow', 'woods', 'Tuvia', 'banditry', 'violence', 'when', 'pressed', 'feed', 'supply', 'whom', 'taken', 'responsibility', 'will', 'also', 'take', 'swift', 'revenge', 'family', 'Polish', 'collaborator', 'responsible', 'killing', 'parents', 'Zus', 'just', 'kill', 'Nazis', 'will', 'go', 'fight', 'Soviet-led', 'partisan', 'band', 'rather', 'shepherd', 'miserable', 'band', 'town-bred', 'intellectuals', 'brutal', 'winter', 'woods.An', 'excellent', 'touch', 'movie', 'realistic', 'way', 'life', 'forest', 'depicted', 'not', 'just', 'sort', 'long-term', 'experience', 'camping', 'out', 'summer', 'when', 'woods', 'are', 'beautiful', 'misty', 'green', 'also', 'having', 'endure', 'brutal', 'near-Siberian', 'winters', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'existence', 'then', 'one', 'long', 'misery', 'dirt', 'semi-starvation', 'cold', 'move', 'was', 'filmed', 'not', 'fifty', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'took', 'place', 'similar', 'forested', 'setting', 'Refreshingly', 'realistically', 'also', 'characters', 'generally', 'appear', 'unkempt', 'ragged', 'dirty', 'males', 'indifferently', 'shaven', 'much', 'movie', 'occasional', 'explosions', 'moments', 'combat', 'are', 'realistically', 'understated', 'spectacular', 'fiery', 'clouds.The', 'one', 'aspect', 'lacking', 'account', 'kind', 'explanation', 'why', 'Tuvia', 'brothers', 'were', 'adept', 'leaders', 'so', 'well-disposed', 'hiding', 'out', 'woods', 'first', 'place', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'artful', 'story-telling', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'Bielski', 'back-story', 'have', 'shown', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'war', 'milieu', 'small', 'farmers', 'edge', 'woods', 'gone', 'little', 'more', 'personal', 'losses', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'are', 'depicted', 'being', 'thirties', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'meaningful', 'adult', 'lives', 'careers', 'wives', 'children', 'Briefly', 'revealing', 'elements', 'instead', 'just', 'bare', 'mention', 'brief', 'dialog', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'extra', 'dimension', 'story', 'Tuvia', 'had', 'served', 'Polish', 'Army', 'war', 'ramped', 'up', 'Zus', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'active', 'smugglers', 'would', 'account', 'being', 'woods', 'first', 'place', 'disinclined', 'cooperate', 'law', 'order', 'second', 'interesting', 'movie', 'venture', 'telling', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'story']",N/A

1190286,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001FB55J4,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 7]","True to its advertising claims, ""Defiance"" tells a story I've never heard before: That of the Bielski Partisans, a Jewish rebellion from Poland that rallied against Nazi occupiers at the height of World War II. Originally founded by the remaining sons of the Bielski family, it soon ballooned into an organization consisting of thousands of people, all freed from local Jewish ghettos. They struggled to survive in the Belarussian forests, facing starvation, disease, and exposure to the elements. Their story was documented in the book ""Defiance: The Bielski Partisans"" by Nechama Tec, and this is the basis for the Edward Zwick's film. I give him credit for directing and co-writing a compelling story in which core human emotions are at odds with basic survival skills; in any such scenario, one must decide whether forgiveness, fairness, and tolerance is more important than staying alive.In spite of its subject matter, ""Defiance"" is far from a perfect film. A lot of it felt like an adaptation, which is to say that it relies too heavily on war movie clich&eacute;s like melodramatic dialogue and overt symbolism. I was especially wary of a death scene late in the film; with his last breath, he turns to Daniel Craig's character and says, ""I had almost lost my faith. But you were sent by God to save us."" Does this not seem contrived? It's second only to obvious visual statements for hope and redemption, as when sunshine bathes the partisans after weeks of harsh winter conditions, or when they all trudge across a swamp in the same way Moses and his chosen people trudged across the parted Red Sea. The creativity and technical merits of such moments are overshadowed by the sense that they don't belong.Still, the drama is persuasive, and the performances are decent given the material they had to work with. Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, and George MacKay portray Tuvia, Zus, Asael, and Aron Bielski, four brothers from West Belarus who lost their parents soon after the Germans invaded. Aron is virtually ignored in the film, and whenever he is featured, he mostly remains quiet and unassuming. The other three, however, are given very distinct personalities, all of which add to the drama and make the story much more personal. Tuvia, for example, is initially angry over the deaths of his parents, and he personally tracks down and kills the Germans responsible. But it isn't long before he realizes how wrong his actions were, and he spends the rest of the film trying to convince himself that the best revenge is mere survival. He also believes that everyone in hiding deserves equal portions of food and must do their fair share of work; this puts him at odds with certain survivors, who feel that those working harder deserve better treatment.Zus, on the other hand, remains angry throughout the entire film. He doesn't agree with Tuvia's more forgiving philosophy--he wants revenge, plain and simple. Because he doesn't get along with his brother, he decides to join a militant group of Soviet partisans also at odds with the Nazis. And as for Asael, the film focuses more on his romance with a young girl named Chaya (Mia Wasikowska), who in real life held the rare distinction of being a high school graduate.Having now done a little research on the subject, I'm surprised at just how much Zwick left out of the screenplay. One of the biggest controversies surrounding the film is the omission of the 1943 Naliboki Massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 128 people. The Bielski partisans were accused of taking part in this alongside Soviet partisans. The fact that many historians deny their involvement should be of no consequence; an event so monumentally tragic should at least be acknowledged as having happened. I'm well aware that a film can only hold so much material before it gets unbearably long, but the way I see it, the Naliboki Massacre is too important to have overlooked.There are also a few logistical issues that seemed to have slipped under the radar, such as the fact that so many of the partisans are never in short supply of alcohol. Where are they getting this alcohol from, and why is it easier to get than food? This doesn't seem very plausible.Despite these problems, ""Defiance"" is still worth recommending, mostly because the performances are believable. It has its other good points: the cinematography is top notch, revealing the squalor the partisans had to live in; James Newton Howard's score is both solemn and exciting, a combination of violin dirges and piano solos; the struggle between survival and vengeance is convincing, especially during a scene in which a Nazi is captured and made to face the wrath of the partisans. I see this film as an introduction of sorts, a way to let the public know that it's based on actual events. Now that we know, I think it would be wise for another filmmaker to tell a more accurate story, one that doesn't have to rely on traditional war movie clich&eacute;s to send the audience a message.",4,Survival of the Fittest,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,4997,"['True', 'advertising', 'claims', 'Defiance', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Bielski', 'Partisans', 'Jewish', 'rebellion',

The colors and the details on  the thousands of trees was astounding.Secondly, the two lead performances were excellent. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber, who played Jewish brothers (""Tuvia and Zus Bielski,"" respectively) with different outlooks on how to survive and/or fight the Nazis, were riveting. It reminded me of ""Munich,"" where you also hear two points of view on how to react to terrorists.The story offered a good mix of action, drama and even some romantic touches. In addition to the two male leads, the women in here were interesting, too.Although about two hours, 20 minutes in length, I was never bored.

I highly recommend this most moving and inspirational film, which concerns a slice of history that has never been adequately covered - the activities of Jewish partisans in Byelorussia (connected to eastern Poland). What happened to the brave Jews who fled the ghettos and small villages as the Nazis began their extermination campaign, how did they fare when they sought refuge in the forests? This film details how a band of three brothers survived on the run in the woods, then found themselves welcoming into their camp more and more refugees in need of their help and knowledge of survival techniques. Excellent performances by all concerned esp. Daniel Craig. I've been waiting for this story to be told on film for decades. The closest themed-film to it was a TV film from the mid-80's ""Sobibor"" starring Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer, about a concentration camp revolt where Jewish inmates and Russian POW's attacked their guards with stolen rifles and provided time for inmates and rebels to escape to the forests.

1190293,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001FB55J4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","The subject matter is incredible, brothers that saved over 1200 people during World War II. What an amazing fantastic strong story. The most powerful moment of this film, the still images of the brothers just before the credits roll. Beside those pictures appear what happened to each afterwards and about how they saved 1200 people, and then those people went on to have hundreds of thousands of children. Incredible.It's very hard to say this isn't a very good film. Sadly I just didn't buy the glossiness of this film. It was too tidy, too Hollywood, and not enough reality.This is just not a good movie in comparison to this fabulous history. At one point I asked myself, how many more angles could the war be approached on? How many more stories are there to tell? How many different ways could a film take the war? They all have a common theme, war is hell, people do horrible things to other people. But how many times can this story be made?My complaint about this particular film, Edward Zwick, the director, after paying his dues with television programs; has recently taken up a number of *cause* movies (Blood Diamond (Widescreen Edition),The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition),I am Sam (New Line Platinum Series), andTraffic). In just about every case he has managed to whitewash those causes (Blood Diamond was an exception) and make them look glossy and all Hollywood. Zwick brings none of the grittiness, the real hell of the situation, to his films. Defiance is a prime example of things being too shiny and well planned out. In the end, we don't care much for the lead characters.I found myself wondering about the motivation for the lead characters. Tuvia is driven to kill early in the film. But yet it feels like he's a robot going to do some deed he was programmed to do. There just wasn't enough back story or reasons why characters did what they chose to do. From that point forward, Tuvia was a lean mean killing machine. There was also way too much black and white between those that were willing to fight and the intellectuals. The final irony when the lead intellectual decides to run out in the open with a live hand grenade.The film is 2 hours and 17 minutes long. With the lack of real character motivation, there is really about 30 minutes of movie in here. The story could have easily been told in much less time, and left nothing out. A typical sequence, Tuvia comes back to camp. We see him stare off in the distance forever. He then all of a sudden says, we have to move, right now. Get all the children, I want them accounted for, we need to move now. So there's great detail in how the camp gets organized to move. Then German planes fly over and bomb the camp. The group finally moves out. They then reach a clearing. We then spend another eternity trying to decide to cross a vast wasteland. They decide to cross with belts and ropes. There's a huge moment of collecting the belts and ropes and how everyone walks. The group triumphantly reaches the woods and another hill. But where are the ropes and belts? All gone, they were a critical plot element earlier, but they're gone now. And where did they march to, a safer place, a place they could stay? No the army is on the other side of the hill. So now there's another battle. What I just described took about 45 minutes in the film. There was painful detail on things that didn't matter. Loose ends that were never mentioned again. Absolutely no motivation for why they did what they did, except that Tuvia said, go do it. 30 minutes of that 45 was wasted on irrelevant details.So I didn't care much for this film. Its way too long. I didn't really care for the two older brothers. The story didn't really make a lot of sense. And the director just over worked everything about this film. What was awesome about this film - the true story that is revealed at the end of the film. That is worth the price of admission.I would imagine that the book is infinitely better than this film. That's not because books are almost always better than the film; its because Edward Zwick managed to ruin a perfectly spectacular story. There are a thousand other approaches to this story that would have made this a hugely compelling film.

As the war progressed, people in this country were subjected to restrictions and rationing but were, by and large, directly untouched by the horrors of war.This movie tells the story of those who were fully immersed in those horrors; of those who were the objects of focused attacks on their lives and all they had ever known. Specifically it tells the story of one Jewish family whose sons decided to try and save themselves from death. Their strength and determination attracted the attention of kindred spirits who joined them in their efforts to simply live and survive the horrors of war.Their story, the story of the Bielski brothers, is told with power and conviction as they seek refuge in the forests and begin to attract others to join them.

The closeups on Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber show the pores and the grit while in the forest.  Because the film was shot during the seasons, outdoor sunshine shots are vibrant in colors with the blue skies, green lush vegetation, while in the Winter, we are treated with blues and whites of despair.  You will see plenty of detail due to the 1080p (1:78:1 aspect ratio) transfer in the film, may it be the trees, the vehicles and even the clothing and the people, ""DEFIANCE"" featured one of the best picture quality war films I have seen on Blu-ray yet.As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (as well as French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The soundtrack features impressive action scenes as bombs utilize the low frequency sounds of the booms through the subwoofer, while gunshots galore are well delivered through the front channels.  You also hear the ambiance of the forest which include the rustle of leaves, storms, birds and subtle noises around the area which can be heard quite nicely through your speakers.Overall, there was really good delivery of audio but I didn't notice a lot of rear surround usage for the film.  The film does feature crystal clear dialogue and the music of James Newton Howard does come alive in showing the desperation felt by those in the forest camp.  A lot of the action sequences do happen in the final 30 minutes of the film but overall, the soundtrack was well done.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""DEFIANCE"" features the following special features:* Commentary with Director Edward Zwick - Commentary by director Edward Zwick in regards to the screenplay being written for the film, the overall production, locations of where the film was shot and behind-the-scenes on the action sequences and more.* Defiance: Return to the Forest - (26:05)  A featurette presented in High Definition that is a ""making-of"" for the film ""DEFIANCE"" and features interviews with cast and crew who talk about their characters and also about the real life characters their characters are based on.* Children of the Otriad: The Families Speak - (13:42) A very informative featurette in High Definition as the children and the grandchildren of the Bielski brothers talk about Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Lilka.  Also, about going to Lithuania and to see the set of ""DEFIANCE"" and then visiting the forest that their father/grandfather/grandmother were at.  The granddaughter of Tuvia filming a documentary with her grandmother Lilka about growing up in the Bielsky family. And last, being reunited with some of the survivors and families of the Bielski Partisan.  Because of the Bielski's, there are five generations of families and 19,000 people alive because of them.* Scoring Defiance - (7:00) With composer/orchestrator James Newton Howard well-known for his musical work, this featurette is about Howard scoring ""DEFIANCE"".  Working with violinist Joshua Bell.  Featuring interviews with Bell and Zwick.* Bielski Partisan Survivors - (1:58) Photo/music montage in HD of the some of the Bielski Partisan survivors take in Nov. 2008 by director Zwick.* Theatrical Trailers - There are two theatrical trailers (2:05 and 2:28) for the film in HD.JUDGMENT CALL:""DEFIANCE"" is definitely a powerful  film and although based on a true story, the story of the Bielski brothers will now be known by a generation not too familiar with how this family of brothers helped give refuge to up to 1,200 (or more) Jews from the Holocaust.  Even afterwards, the brothers never looked at themselves as heroes and kept themselves low key throughout their lifetime.If I had one major problem with the film is similar to other war or period films based on a true story, is the need to stray away from factual events in order to create action.  Granted, for me it depends on the level of exaggeration and how far it strays from factual events.  I understand why the Hollywood execs want to add the action sequences, because war battles lead to ticket sales.A film like ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" had to go that direction and historians were critical for its Hollywood dramatization and the same with ""DEFIANCE"".  According to reports, the original author of the book Nechama Lec was not too thrilled that in the film, the Bielski Partisans had to fight against German tanks, when the goal was to survive and not have head on confrontations.  Polish historians were upset that the film was oversimplified and the facts that the forest were the Jewish were hiding in was in Poland and of course, anger that Bielski Partisans were not heroes but thieves who stole and badly treated Polish locals.  But anger more so about the slaughters of Polish locals in the village of Naliboki which evidence has supported the murders were led by Russian partisans which many nationalists in Poland believe the Bielski's were involved (former members of Bielski's brigade and other historians have disputed this).The director of the film, Ed Zwick has admitted that his film is not a simple fight between good and evil.  In a statement, Zwick said ""The Bielski's weren't saints.  ""They were flawed heroes, which is what makes them so real and so fascinating. They faced any number of difficult moral dilemmas that the movie seeks to dramatize: Does one have to become a monster to fight monsters? Does one have to sacrifice his humanity to save humanity?""But the truth is that there are still many emotions that will continue no matter how many years have passed and when it comes to films in which war and crimes committed during war time, there will be some people who will think such things are justified, some who will think the opposite.  There will always be people on both sides who will continue to disagree.I can understand why the studios wanted to make certain deviations from the book to the film's final cut. Especially for a film that costs $32 million to make, people come to the box office for these action sequence and fortunately the film was able to make its money back worldwide as it made over $44 million.For me, what I found powerful was how these brothers provided a refuge and eventually rescued 1,200 Jews and how they had to live out challenges in the Forest under the worst conditions but their will to survive kept them going, even though they were being hunted down by the Germans.  There are so many war stories from the past in all parts of the world that people would have never known about and for ""DEFIANCE"" to get the green light to be created and in the end, to come out so fascinating and again, so powerful, I was captivated by the willingness of those who wanted to live and survive, but if they died, they died because they wanted to live and for a purpose, not to be treated like an animal.""DEFIANCE"" is one of those films that captures the persistence of the human spirit and it may have been overly simplified to be a film about surviving in the forest but it's the leadership that Daniel Craig brings to his character of Tuvia and Schreiber's Gung-Ho fight mentality for his character of Zus that makes the film quite interesting.  Unfortunately, the two go separate ways and the conflict between the two brothers  starts to bring more focus on the camp, while the character of Zus gets the short end of the stick and is rarely utilized throughout the film.But the film does have its flaws but personally, I found ""DEFIANCE"" absolutely enjoyable and the Blu-ray release of ""DEFIANCE"" does feature awesome picture quality, as well as audio quality plus enjoyable special features.Overall, ""DEFIANCE"" is highly recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: Amazing picture quality and detail, very good audio...captivating and powerful film with

Wong,"[8, 15]","Judging from director Edward Zwick's great track record of fine films like ""Glory"", ""The Siege"", ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Last Samurai"", I expected to really like this film.  Also the subject matter of Bielski brothers standing up to the Nazi would eliminate the myth that all Jews were passive to the Nazi's atrocities toward them. Alas I found myself looking to my watch to see when it would end which I don't usually do unless it's a Spike Lee movie!!  Granted the performances by Craig and Shreiber are excellent as the brothers but too many subplots deterred my interest or attention on the main theme.  Nevertheless, this film could warrant a rental but I doubt seriously I could put it up to other films dealing with the Holocaust such as ""Schindler's List"",""The Reader"" with an Oscar winning performance by Kate Winslet or ""The Pianist"".

1190303,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B001FB55J4,Donald M. Bishop,"[3, 3]","This film, set in World War II on the Eastern Front (not well known to Americans), includes a fine performance by Daniel Craig, stunning photography of the forests, and the portrayal of Jews as fighters not victims.  These are strong pluses in this memorable film produced by Edward Zwick.As the film ended, however, I was not quite satisfied.  The film only touched lightly on some of the large moral questions it introduced.  The screenplay gave glimpses of real dilemmas without probing them more deeply.  Among them:--  ""Forest wives.""--  Treatment of prisoners captured by the Jewish fighters and other partisans.--  ""Equal rations for all"" when some contributed more to seizing the food needed by the community.--  Treatment of local peasants, related to the larger question of whether ""if you're not for us, you're against us.""--  While opposing the horror of the Nazi war and racial machine, sorting out the conflicting claims of loyalty and identity -- Polish (the area they came from had belonged to Poland before the war), Belarusian, Soviet, and Jewish.--  Executions -- both of prisoners and those who challenged the camp leadership.--  ""No infants allowed.""Sitting comfortably in a living room nearly seventy years after the events portrayed in the film, one hesitates to second guess decisions made at the time.  None of us were there, many of the choices were between evils, and a few lines or scenes in a film don't do justice to the awful dilemmas forced on the partisan band and its leaders.  In the forests of Byelorussia, occupied by the Nazis, the Bielski partisans lived in a severely constricted and pressured moral universe, caught in the midst of a murderous war between the Nazi and Soviet dictatorships.  Life and death were the stakes.  Peacetime moral strictures were distant from the immediate needs of survival.Even so, memoirs, historical novels, and films implicitly revisit choices made in the past.  In ""Defiance,"" the screenplay develops and honors some of the moral decisions like ""equal rations for all.""  But it mutes the treatment of other issues.  Different viewers may have different misgivings, but I found the non-judgmental treatment of ""forest wives"" discomforting because it was so casual.More depth on some of the moral issues in the film, moreover, might better illustrate the meaning of ""lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.""  ""Temptation"" in the prayer may be understood as ""trial"" or ""test,"" and it asks the Almighty to spare an individual from the perilous situations that require denial, compromise, and bad choices.Watch ""Defiance,"" then, for more than its history, photography, and performances.  Talk over the issues it touches on.  Understand that in societies less fortunate than ours, in times more perilous, people considered mere ""questions"" or ""issues"" as blessed luxuries, for they lived in circumstances that required answers.-30-",4,A memorable film that introduces large moral questions,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2914,"['film', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'Americans', 'fine', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'stunning', 'photography', 'forests', 'portrayal', 'Jews', 'fighters', 'not', 'victims', 'are', 'strong', 'pluses', 'memorable', 'film', 'produced', 'Edward', 'Zwick.As', 'film', 'ended', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'film', 'only', 'touched', 'lightly', 'large', 'moral', 'questions', 'introduced', 'screenplay', 'gave', 'glimpses', 'real', 'dilemmas', 'probing', 'more', 'deeply', 'Forest', 'wives', 'Treatment', 'prisoners', 'captured', 'Jewish', 'fighters', 'other', 'partisans.', 'Equal', 'rations', 'when', 'contributed', 'more', 'seizing', 'food', 'needed', 'community.', 'Treatment', 'local', 'peasants', 'related', 'larger', 'question', ""'re"", 'not', ""'re"", 'opposing', 'horror', 'Nazi', 'war', 'racial', 'machine', 'sorting', 'out', 'conflicting', 'claims', 'loyalty', 'identity', 'Polish', 'area', 'came', 'had', 'belonged', 'Poland', 'war', 'Belarusian', 'Soviet', 'Jewish.', 'Executions', 'prisoners', 'who', 'challenged', 'camp', 'leadership.', 'infants', 'allowed', 'Sitting', 'comfortably', 'living', 'room', 'nearly', 'seventy', 'years', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'one', 'second', 'guess', 'decisions', 'made', 'time', 'None', 'were', 'there', 'many', 'choices', 'were', 'evils', 'few', 'lines', 'scenes', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'awful', 'dilemmas', 'forced', 'partisan', 'band', 'leaders', 'forests', 'Byelorussia', 'occupied', 'Nazis', 'Bielski', 'partisans', 'lived', 'severely', 'constricted', 'pressured', 'moral', 'universe', 'caught', 'midst', 'murderous', 'war', 'Nazi', 'Soviet', 'dictatorships', 'Life', 'death', 'were', 'stakes', 'Peacetime', 'moral', 'strictures', 'were', 'distant', 'immediate', 'needs', 'survival.Even', 'so', 'memoirs', 'historical', 'novels', 'films', 'implicitly', 'revisit', 'choices', 'made', 'past', 'Defiance', 'screenplay', 'honors', 'moral', 'decisions', 'equal', 'rations', 'treatment', 'other', 'issues', 'Different', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'different', 'misgivings', 'found', 'non-judgmental', 'treatment', 'forest', 'wives', 'discomforting', 'was', 'so', 'casual.More', 'depth', 'moral', 'issues', 'film', 'moreover', 'might', 'better', 'illustrate', 'meaning', 'lead', 'not', 'temptation', 'deliver', 'evil', 'Temptation', 'prayer', 'may', 'be', 'understood', 'trial', 'test', 'Almighty', 'spare', 'individual', 'perilous', 'situations', 'require', 'denial', 'compromise', 'bad', 'choices.Watch', 'Defiance', 'then', 'more', 'history', 'photography', 'performances', 'Talk', 'issues', 'Understand', 'societies', 'less', 'fortunate', 'ours', 'times', 'more', 'perilous', 'people', 'considered', 'mere', 'questions', 'issues', 'blessed', 'luxuries', 'lived', 'circumstances', 'required', 'answers.-30-']",N/A

The brothers are targeted because they are Jews, but eventually they take different paths to fighting the damn Germans. One stays in the woods where he and another brother protect a band of jews who are hiding in very rough conditions, while another takes up with the communists to fight the Nazis.

Three Jewish brothers, Tuvia, Zus, and Asael Bielski (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell), take refuge in the nearby forests. They are joined, more or less by accident, by other members of their Jewish community.  It falls to the three brothers to take charge and defy the odds to save the lives of their fellow refugees.Such is the premise of 2009's ""Defiance"", which shines a light on a obscure corner of World War Two's Eastern Front.  Trapped behind the German lines, the Bielski group must battle lack of food and shelter, a harsh winter, and the vicious tactics of the German Army.  They get little help from the local Soviet partisan group, which regards them with suspicion.The narrative proceeds on parallel tracks.  The otherwise ordinary Bielski brothers must grow, painfully, into leaders, while their fellow refugees struggle to maintain their sense of community under the most difficult of conditions.  The interactions between the brothers ring true, thanks to some solid acting.  Some of the best moments of the movie are the efforts of the people of the forest to fashion a new, if precarious, life for themselves in the midst of war.""Defiance"" narrates some painful events that may be difficult to watch.  The partisan battle may be unknown to the average viewer, who is encouraged to explore the extra features explaining the history behind the movie.

1190306,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B001FB55J4,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[9, 14]","""Defiance,"" directed by Edward Zwick from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Clayton Frohman, is based on the true story of the Bielski brothers.  Tuvia and Zus Bielski had been farmers in Belarus before the German invasion.  Along with their younger brothers, Asael and Aron, they flee deep into the forest to plan a strategy for survival after the rest of their family is murdered in 1941.  What starts out as a small group of resisters continues to grow as more refugees join them.  The problems are many:  How will they elude their enemies?  What will they eat?  How will they ward off illness?  When winter comes, how will they endure the biting cold?  What will happen when, inevitably, conflicts arise?Tuvia, played with grit and determination by Daniel Craig, is a natural leader whose authority is challenged time and again.  Although Tuvia is close to his brother, Zus (Live Schreiber), the two have a falling out and come to blows.  It seems that even when conditions are dire, it is difficult for strong-willed people to put aside their differences for the greater good.  ""Defiance"" touches on a number of themes, such as the evils of anti-Semitism, ethics vs. pragmatism, and the ways in which hope and fortitude can keep us going when all seems lost.Although the script and the performances are serviceable, and one or two scenes are genuinely moving, Zwick relies a bit too much on well-worn Hollywood conventions.  There are the predictable romances:  Alexa Davalos (Lilka) and Mia Wasikowska (Chaya) are lovely women (they look as if they just stepped out of commercials for skin care) who attract two of the brothers.  Other stock characters are the intellectual who, out of necessity, learns practical skills, the rebellious thug who ignores Tuvia's orders, and the arrogant Russian partisan who fights alongside Zus, while barely hiding his disdain for his Jewish comrades.  During the action sequences in which our heroes fight against the Nazis, the gunshots and explosives always seem to miss the main characters by inches.  One unfortunate gaffe that has been mentioned elsewhere is the use of ampicillin (which did not exist in 1941) to treat typhus. Even if this antibiotic had been available at that time, it would have not have had any effect on this disease.  After seeing this film, you may want to read the book ""Defiance,"" by Nechama Tec, and learn a bit more about how a band of Jews fought off their enemies and, against enormous odds, pulled off the ultimate act of resistance.",4,"""The image of European Jews going passively to their deaths is inaccurate.""",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2512,"['Defiance', 'directed', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'screenplay', 'co-wrote', 'Clayton', 'Frohman', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'Bielski', 'had', 'been', 'farmers', 'Belarus', 'German', 'invasion', 'younger', 'brothers', 'Asael', 'Aron', 'flee', 'deep', 'forest', 'plan', 'strategy', 'survival', 'rest', 'family', 'murdered', '1941', 'What', 'out', 'small', 'group', 'resisters', 'grow', 'more', 'refugees', 'join', 'problems', 'are', 'many', 'How', 'will', 'elude', 'enemies', 'What', 'will', 'eat', 'How', 'will', 'ward', 'off', 'illness', 'When', 'winter', 'how', 'will', 'endure', 'biting', 'cold', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'inevitably', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'Tuvia', 'played', 'grit', 'determination', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'natural', 'leader', 'authority', 'challenged', 'time', 'again', 'Tuvia', 'close', 'brother', 'Zus', 'Live', 'Schreiber', 'two', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'come', 'blows', 'even', 'when', 'conditions', 'are', 'dire', 'difficult', 'strong-willed', 'people', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'greater', 'good', 'Defiance', 'touches', 'number', 'themes', 'such', 'evils', 'anti-Semitism', 'ethics', 'vs.', 'pragmatism', 'ways', 'hope', 'fortitude', 'can', 'keep', 'going', 'when', 'script', 'performances', 'are', 'serviceable', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'Zwick', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'well-worn', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'are', 'predictable', 'romances', 'Alexa', 'Davalos', 'Lilka', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Chaya', 'are', 'lovely', 'women', 'look', 'just', 'stepped', 'commercials', 'skin', 'care', 'who', 'attract', 'two', 'brothers', 'Other', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'intellectual', 'who', 'necessity', 'practical', 'skills', 'rebellious', 'thug', 'who', 'Tuvia', 'orders', 'arrogant', 'Russian', 'partisan', 'who', 'alongside', 'Zus', 'barely', 'hiding', 'disdain', 'Jewish', 'comrades', 'action', 'sequences', 'heroes', 'fight', 'Nazis', 'gunshots', 'explosives', 'always', 'seem', 'miss', 'main', 'characters', 'inches', 'One', 'unfortunate', 'gaffe', 'been', 'mentioned', 'elsewhere', 'use', 'ampicillin', 'did', 'not', 'exist', '1941', 'treat', 'typhus', 'Even', 'antibiotic', 'had', 'been', 'available', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'effect', 'disease', 'seeing', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'Defiance', 'Nechama', 'Tec', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'how', 'band', 'Jews', 'fought', 'off', 'enemies', 'enormous', 'odds', 'pulled', 'off', 'ultimate', 'act', 'resistance']",N/A
1190307,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001FB55J4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","Written and directed by Edward Zwick (director of THE LAST SAMURAI and BLOOD DIAMOND), this interesting, moving film was a fascinating watch. It is the story of the fabulous Bielski brothers, Tuviya a/k/a Tuvya a/k/a Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and young Asael (a great turn from Jamie Bell).These Russian Jewish brothers escaped the NAZIs into the depths of the forest in 1941 or thereabouts. They took with them everyone they could, eventually evacuating an entire ghetto, and at certain moments working with the Russian resistance (as one elder pointed out, the same Russians whose ancestors had committed the pogrom).These people, more than 1,000, survived in the woods for nearly four years. The Bielski brothers rallied them and Tuvia Bielski was the 'commandant'--but it was the power of the people to the nth degree that makes this true story an incredibly moving, inspiring tale. Coming to be known as ""The Bielski Partisans"", this group of Jews, poor and once-rich, laborer and educated professional, fought a little-known great resistance in WWII Russia.In the end, all these Jews would be forced to cross a marsh that made the Pontine look like a kiddie-pool; they would all learn to be warriors as were their ancient ancestors; and would eventually take on the NAZIs in a fierce hand-to-hand battle...which the Jews won.I imagine there are poetic licenses taken in DEFIANCE, which is as it should be. I was deeply moved by Daniel Craig's solid, reliable performance. His Russian is fantastic, and there was no want in his acting at all (I've been hearing complaints since he played James Bond). Liev Schreiber is haunting and powerful as he always is; naturally his Russian is fluent and easy also. Jamie Bell, though somewhat shoved into the back seat, performs capably and I'm sorry he didn't get all he deserved from this film.The other performers are spectacular, with natural, frightened and really emotionally charged work that you don't get everyday. While you may not recognize most of these excellent performers, you will see members of your own families in their faces. Especially the girls. They are strong, powerful, they do not whine as you might expect anyone would do; they accept their life, a harsh truth in exchange for a future. As one significant character prays, ""God, do not choose us anymore.""I will stop the synopsis because I'm sure it's easy to guess. However, a few more words about the film as film: it is a bit slow and saggy in places I'd expect some brilliance. Kurosawa was unmatched at making silence and stillness count for much. This film doesn't do that, and lacks a lot of subtlety. As I say Jamie Bell is ill-used here, considering his talents. It shows a bit of lack of directorial experience.The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack a good, unintrusive complement. My wife and I were very impressed by the way this film uses color and monochrome. Watch for it, I won't try to describe it. One thing that really made it for me was the parallel between my people fleeing Egypt so long ago, and these people in the forests of Russia. You'll see this too, so I'll not spoil it. It is one of the things the director nailed perfectly.One thing else I must address, and that is accents. It struck me as natural that the characters should speak with accents, in spite of them all speaking Russian at certain times. They are Russian, so they use Russian accents. Yet this is a contrivance I cannot comprehend, and do not usually approve. We had the same issue with VALKYRIE--the public asked why the characters didn't affect German accents, as if it were ""Hogan's Heroes"".Generally characters do not need silly accents. It detracts from drama and story; it sounds silly and as I said, very contrived. We do not need accents to tell one set of characters from another, especially in DEFIANCE. Yet it works and I had no qualm with it. That means I am missing something. I wish I knew what it was I was missing; I can tell you that each actor in DEFIANCE mysteriously loses his accent at one time or another. It happens a lot. Perhaps there is a cinematic lesson here about giving actors unnecessary accents.We must never forget, and this film in spite of all technical flaws gets the full tamale for teaching us something we didn't really know. This is stuff that cannot be forgotten once learned, and these heroes should go into the future well known and beloved. Like the film itself, warts and all, it is a glorious, miraculous and heroic thing.",5,"Please, God, do not choose Us anymore",1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,4512,"['Written', 'directed', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'director', 'THE', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'BLOOD', 'DIAMOND', 'interesting', 'moving', 'film', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'story', 'fabulous', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'Tuviya', 'Tuvya', 'a/k/a', 'Tuvia', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'young', 'Asael', 'great', 'turn', 'Jamie', 'Bell', '.These', 'Russian', 'Jewish', 'brothers', 'escaped', 'NAZIs', 'depths', 'forest', '1941', 'thereabouts', 'took', 'everyone', 'could', 'eventually', 'evacuating', 'entire', 'ghetto', 'certain', 'moments', 'working', 'Russian', 'resistance', 'one', 'elder', 'pointed', 'out', 'same', 'Russians', 'ancestors', 'had', 'committed', 'pogrom', '.These', 'people', 'more', '1,000', 'survived', 'woods', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'rallied', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'was', ""'commandant"", 'was', 'power', 'people', 'nth', 'degree', 'true', 'story', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'Coming', 'be', 'known', 'Bielski', 'Partisans', 'group', 'Jews', 'poor', 'once-rich', 'laborer', 'educated', 'professional', 'fought', 'little-known', 'great', 'resistance', 'WWII', 'Russia.In', 'end', 'Jews', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'cross', 'marsh', 'made', 'Pontine', 'look', 'kiddie-pool', 'would', 'learn', 'be', 'warriors', 'were', 'ancient', 'ancestors', 'would', 'eventually', 'take', 'NAZIs', 'fierce', 'hand-to-hand', 'battle', 'Jews', 'won.I', 'imagine', 'are', 'poetic', 'licenses', 'taken', 'DEFIANCE', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'solid', 'reliable', 'performance', 'Russian', 'fantastic', 'was', 'want', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'complaints', 'played', 'James', 'Bond', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'haunting', 'powerful', 'always', 'naturally', 'Russian', 'fluent', 'easy', 'also', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'somewhat', 'shoved', 'back', 'seat', 'capably', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'deserved', 'film.The', 'other', 'performers', 'are', 'spectacular', 'natural', 'frightened', 'really', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'everyday', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'most', 'excellent', 'performers', 'will', 'see', 'members', 'own', 'families', 'Especially', 'girls', 'are', 'strong', 'powerful', 'do', 'not', 'whine', 'might', 'expect', 'anyone', 'would', 'do', 'accept', 'life', 'harsh', 'truth', 'exchange', 'future', 'one', 'significant', 'character', 'prays', 'God', 'do', 'not', 'choose', 'anymore', 'will', 'stop', 'synopsis', ""'m"", 'sure', 'easy', 'guess', 'However', 'few', 'more', 'words', 'film', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'saggy', 'places', ""'d"", 'expect', 'brilliance', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'unmatched', 'making', 'silence', 'stillness', 'count', 'much', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'subtlety', 'say', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'ill-used', 'here', 'considering', 'talents', 'bit', 'lack', 'directorial', 'experience.The', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'unintrusive', 'complement', 'wife', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'film', 'color', 'monochrome', 'Watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'describe', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'made', 'was', 'parallel', 'people', 'fleeing', 'Egypt', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'people', 'forests', 'Russia', ""'ll"", 'see', 'too', ""'ll"", 'not', 'spoil', 'one', 'things', 'director', 'nailed', 'perfectly.One', 'thing', 'else', 'must', 'address', 'accents', 'struck', 'natural', 'characters', 'should', 'speak', 'accents', 'spite', 'speaking', 'Russian', 'certain', 'times', 'are', 'Russian', 'use', 'Russian', 'accents', 'contrivance', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'approve', 'had', 'same', 'issue', 'VALKYRIE', 'public', 'asked', 'why', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'affect', 'German', 'accents', 'were', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', '.Generally', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'silly', 'accents', 'drama', 'story', 'silly', 'said', 'very', 'contrived', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'accents', 'tell', 'one', 'set', 'characters', 'especially', 'DEFIANCE', 'had', 'qualm', 'am', 'missing', 'something', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'missing', 'can', 'tell', 'actor', 'DEFIANCE', 'mysteriously', 'accent', 'one', 'time', 'lot', 'Perhaps', 'cinematic', 'lesson', 'here', 'giving', 'actors', 'unnecessary', 'accents.We', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'film', 'spite', 'technical', 'flaws', 'full', 'tamale', 'teaching', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'stuff', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'once', 'learned', 'heroes', 'should', 'go', 'future', 'well', 'known', 'beloved', 'film', 'warts', 'glorious', 'miraculous', 'heroic', 'thing']",N/A

The war is generally shown in Germany and its surrounds; Belarus, on the Russian border, is a country I've not seen on film before. And filmed in Lithuania, which is nearby, it is very authentic as a setting.The brothers are portrayed extremely well by Daniel Craig (Tuvia), Liev Schreiber (Zus), Jamie Bell (Asael), and George MacKay (Aron). The three older brothers have been away from their home and return to find their parents killed by a Nazi sympathizer. The youngest, admirably and poignantly played by George MacKay, has been hiding in an outbuilding. The brothers gather a few supplies and retreat into the forest.In the next few weeks, they are joined in the forest by a growing multitude of refugees, and to escape further persecution the group sets up a camp far inside the protection of the trees, with the Bielskis as camp leaders. The two older brothers, Zus and Tuvia, cannot cede leadership to each other, however; Tuvia wants to exist quietly and hopefully escape notice from the Nazis; Zus, angry and hotheaded, wants to fight. He eventually leaves to join a Russian resistance unit, taking a number of the camp men with him. Tuvia is left to manage the ever-increasing number of Jewish refugees by himself, allocating jobs to everyone in the camp.The sheer scope of a group that size living through a harsh winter in a forest camp is boggling, as it seems that not too many are lost to the elements, although sickness seems to be prevalent. These were strong people, determined to live in the face of long odds. Tuvia does his best to provide for everyone, and deals with the inevitable malcontents brusquely and without sentimentality. He is a born leader.Zus encounters both grudging respect and anti-Semitism from the Russian unit which he joins, and clearly seethes with resentment, but continues to fight the common enemy with singleminded zeal. He looks after his own comrades as well as he can within the confines of the chain of command, and is frustrated that the Russian leader does so little to stop his underlings from pushing the Jewish fighters around.

The holocaust Jews are stereotyped now, as in Schlinder's List on, with the same dreary appearance -- the rabbi, the teacher, the intellectual, and the women who only want to grab a guy. We saw very few Germans, and they appeared to be bit players. The scenery in Lithuania was beautiful with nice location shots. The casting was OK, but predictable. Jews should look like Talmud scholars or freedom fighters.In using Craig in the film, it destroyed authenticity. Hollywood is so afraid the film won't make money, they had to use a name star.At least the Russians were believable: they spoke Russian, not Oxford English. They even looked like high class Russians.

It is a true story of the holocaust that has almost never been heard before: three Russian brothers who created a community of Jewish survivors of the Nazi genocide deep in the forest, under constant threat of starvation, the elements and the Nazi invaders who had taken over their country.This film is great on every level: script, direction, special effects, etc.  But it is the acting that is really a marvel:  Daniel Craig is simply outstanding as the oldest brother Tuvia.  I admire his performance as 007, however here he is simply fantastic.  How he did not warrant an academy award nomination as best actor is simply beyond me.  He is almost matched by Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as the other two Bielski brothers.This film does not depict the holocaust in such graphic terms as Schindlers List or War and Remembrance.  I think it can be watched and understood by younger viewers.  I would recommend it to young people who really do not know anything about the holocaust.The picture and sound on the blu-ray are outstanding.  The special features include a nice retrospective on the making of the film and I especially enjoyed a short subject featuring current interviews with the children of the Bielski brothers, including numerous home movies.  This segment was excellent.This film did okay business upon its opening late last holiday season.  It received mediocre reviews and received only one oscar nomination for best music.

1190320,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B001FB55J4,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[0, 2]","I am absolutely astounded that this film was even made.  It is important not only for telling an amazing historical story, but it also gives a very good idea into the mindset of modern Jews, particularly of those in Israel today.  This film is certainly not ""politcally correct"" in showing Jews as fighters, as people wanting vengeance against their persecutors and in stubbornly remaining attached to their religious and national identity, in defiance of modern trends towards ""globalization"", cultural homogenization and anti-military and anti-nationalist ideologies in the United States and Western Europe.Of course, the Holocaust is commemorated by everyone today, and the Nazi terror in Europe is well-documented, but the particularly Jewish experience in Eastern Europe is not well understood, suprisingly, even by Jews themselves, particularly in the United States.  Jews in Eastern Europe had a very rich intellectual and cultural life, but with the ever present antisemitism lurking in the background, effecting everyone's perception of things.  Jews had different ideological and social responses to this....some held on strongly to traditional religious attitudes, which were generally passive, preaching patience, others tried (not with very much success) to assimilate to the surrounding non-Jewish culture, others turned towards Communism and Socialism, thinking that would lead to a new society and yet others turned towards Zionism.  This film shows this...unlike most modern films involving Jews which portray them in stereotypical terms, either as Paul Newman (in the film Exodus) as blond, tough, irreligious fighters indistinguishable from other non-Jews, or as weak, passive figures as in the Disney Film ""Miracle at Midnight"" who turn into cringing figures as Nazis close in on them (in Denmark) but whom are saved at the last minute  by tough, brave Danish resistance fighters.  In ""Defiance"" we see an accurate cross-section of Eastern European Jews representing the different trends I outlined above, but all having a respect for Jewish tradition, and all willing to pitch in, either as fighters or in other roles vital to keeping their underground community alive. Another important fact pointed out was the mixed response their group, particularly Zush, received from the Red (Soviet) Partisans, whom are supposed according to Communist ideology to oppose antisemitism, yet manyh of whom still harbor antisemitic attitudes, such as the comments to Zush that ""Jews don't know how to drink or to fight"".  The Bielskis showed them that Jews could learn how to fight.The Jews who came to Israel in the years after World War II had values, traditions (e.g. the wedding scene in the film which is beautifully juxtabposed with a partisan attack on a German patrol) and experiences like these seen in the film burned into their memories and so anyone who sees this film will have at least some understanding of the mentality of many of the people in the country. Sefardic Jews, who make up close to half the Jewish population of Israel, while most not having to go throught the Holocaust, do also have similar memories of persecution which also contributes to the country's mindset. Thus, questions that some ""progressive"" Jews and otheres in the United States have regarding Israel's defense and foreign policies or the fact that Israel has an established Orthodox Rabbinate which seems to contradict ""liberal, Western"" values can be understood by learning about the Jewish peoples history and experiences and this film can be a good start in the education process.",5,The Modern Jewish Crucible,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,3585,"['am', 'absolutely', 'astounded', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'important', 'not', 'only', 'telling', 'amazing', 'historical', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'mindset', 'modern', 'Jews', 'particularly', 'Israel', 'today', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'politcally', 'correct', 'showing', 'Jews', 'fighters', 'people', 'wanting', 'vengeance', 'persecutors', 'stubbornly', 'remaining', 'attached', 'religious', 'national', 'identity', 'defiance', 'modern', 'trends', 'globalization', 'cultural', 'homogenization', 'anti-military', 'anti-nationalist', 'ideologies', 'United', 'States', 'Western', 'Europe.Of', 'course', 'Holocaust', 'commemorated', 'everyone', 'today', 'Nazi', 'terror', 'Europe', 'well-documented', 'particularly', 'Jewish', 'experience', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'not', 'well', 'understood', 'suprisingly', 'even', 'Jews', 'particularly', 'United', 'States', 'Jews', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'had', 'very', 'rich', 'intellectual', 'cultural', 'life', 'ever', 'present', 'antisemitism', 'lurking', 'background', 'effecting', 'everyone', 'perception', 'things', 'Jews', 'had', 'different', 'ideological', 'social', 'responses', '.some', 'held', 'strongly', 'traditional', 'religious', 'attitudes', 'were', 'generally', 'passive', 'preaching', 'patience', 'others', 'tried', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'success', 'assimilate', 'surrounding', 'non-Jewish', 'culture', 'others', 'turned', 'towards', 'Communism', 'Socialism', 'thinking', 'would', 'lead', 'new', 'society', 'yet', 'others', 'turned', 'towards', 'Zionism', 'film', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'involving', 'Jews', 'portray', 'stereotypical', 'terms', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'film', 'Exodus', 'blond', 'tough', 'irreligious', 'fighters', 'indistinguishable', 'other', 'non-Jews', 'weak', 'passive', 'figures', 'Disney', 'Film', 'Miracle', 'Midnight', 'who', 'turn', 'cringing', 'figures', 'Nazis', 'close', 'Denmark', 'whom', 'are', 'saved', 'last', 'minute', 'tough', 'brave', 'Danish', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'Defiance', 'see', 'accurate', 'cross-section', 'Eastern', 'European', 'Jews', 'representing', 'different', 'trends', 'outlined', 'having', 'respect', 'Jewish', 'tradition', 'willing', 'pitch', 'fighters', 'other', 'roles', 'vital', 'keeping', 'underground', 'community', 'alive', 'important', 'fact', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'mixed', 'response', 'group', 'particularly', 'Zush', 'received', 'Red', 'Soviet', 'Partisans', 'whom', 'are', 'supposed', 'according', 'Communist', 'ideology', 'oppose', 'antisemitism', 'yet', 'manyh', 'whom', 'still', 'harbor', 'antisemitic', 'attitudes', 'such', 'comments', 'Zush', 'Jews', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'drink', 'fight', 'Bielskis', 'showed', 'Jews', 'could', 'learn', 'how', 'fight.The', 'Jews', 'who', 'came', 'Israel', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'had', 'values', 'traditions', 'e.g', 'wedding', 'scene', 'film', 'beautifully', 'juxtabposed', 'partisan', 'attack', 'German', 'patrol', 'experiences', 'seen', 'film', 'burned', 'memories', 'so', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'least', 'understanding', 'mentality', 'many', 'people', 'country', 'Sefardic', 'Jews', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'close', 'Jewish', 'population', 'Israel', 'most', 'not', 'having', 'go', 'throught', 'Holocaust', 'do', 'also', 'have', 'similar', 'memories', 'persecution', 'also', 'country', 'mindset', 'Thus', 'questions', 'progressive', 'Jews', 'otheres', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'regarding', 'Israel', 'defense', 'foreign', 'policies', 'fact', 'Israel', 'established', 'Orthodox', 'Rabbinate', 'contradict', 'liberal', 'Western', 'values', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'learning', 'Jewish', 'peoples', 'history', 'experiences', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'start', 'education', 'process']",N/A

Adapted from Dr. Nechama Tec's book DEFIANCE: THE BIELSKI PARTISANS by director Edward Zwick and Clayton Frohman this film is as much about family devotion as it is about extended family.  It is a touching story of survival under the most impossible conditions and a story of heroism that is far too unknown among even scholars of the WW II period.Set in 1941 DEFIANCE introduces four brothers of the Bielski family (the parents have been victims of the Nazi Final Solution in Belorussia) - the compassionate brother  Tuvia (Daniel Craig),  angry and reactive brother Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the younger brothers Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George McKay).  In response to the war the brothers find refuge in the forest where gradually they encounter other Jews hiding from the Nazis and through thoughtful and clever means form an ever enlarging community  where their extended family is fed and cared for and prepared with weapons stolen from the Nazis to defend their existence and protect them from being placed in the death camps.  The film is a series of encounters with the enemy but it is also a very touching collection of stories of survival in the wilderness by such concepts as allowing men to have 'forest wives', pitting the religious teachings of a professor Haretz (Allan Corduner) and the pure intellectualism of  writer Isaac Malbin (Mark Feurstein), and other interludes of interpersonal coping with tragedy.The cast is a fine one with Liev Schreiber the most convincing, but with a fine new role type for Daniel Craig.

Unless one had read the book (which I had not), one was left to his own devices to understand what took place prior to the opening of the movie with a ragtag group of concentration camp or ghetto escapees or survivors, led by the Bielski brothers appearing out of nowhere upon the screen.Without knowing the story of how they ended up in the Belorussian forest, their individual stories that is, the movie lacks a beginning. And watching them continue their struggles as the movie credits begin to roll at the end, one is left with the feeling that this movie has no beginning, very little of a middle, and no secure ending.Although there is a lot of heroism via fantasized violence against German soldiers, this makes neither a ""middle to the movie,"" nor a complete story for the historical record.

1190333,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B001FB55J4,Hikari,"[0, 0]","The 2008 holiday season gave us two cinematic efforts detailing the true stories behind two separate acts of resistance to the Hitler regime, Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" and this.  Each is guaranteed to haunt you after it's over, and make you marvel afresh at the depths of both cruelty and courage of which human beings are capable.  I recommend watching them both as a double bill to see some of the most committed acting performances of recent times.Powerhouse Daniel Craig cements his reputation here as the most versatile and passionate actor to ever fill 007's shoes.  Somewhere between the grueling shooting schedules for his two Bond films, he also found time for this even more grueling picture, spending three or four months on location in Lithuania, and speaking very credible Russian for at least half of the film.  He plays Tuvia, the eldest of the four Bielski brothers who flee to the vast forests of Belarus after their parents are brutally slain by Nazi collaborators.  At first intent only on their own survival, they become the reluctant protectors of a ragtag band of fellow Jewish refugees.  The leadership role falls naturally to Tuvia, who recognizes that his humanitarian duty to save fellow Jews outweighs personal interests.  After a daring visit to the Nazi-guarded ghetto, their number swells to 1200.  With Tuvia as their commander, and a sort of 20th-century Robin Hood, these ordinary citizens organize a forest community, learning woodsmanship and weaponry, and survival skills.  Next-eldest brother Zus (Liev Schrieber) is not content to remain in a defensive posture and joins the nearby Red Army battalion so he can kill Germans.  The tension between the vengeful Zus and the more pragmatic and pacifistic Tuvia is central to the narrative.  In contrast to the ""Valkyrie"" script, which essentially covers the events of one day, and can do so in minute detail, the story of ""Defiance"" spans more than three years that the ""Bielski Partisans"" lived in the forest.  This is too large a canvas for the filmmakers to do little more than broadly sketch what this forest existence must have been like and some of the personalities involved, but we do get a pretty vivid taste, throughout the seasons, of life spent in the wilderness and on the move, constantly afraid for the security of their camp.  Apart from everyone looking too clean (personal hygiene must have been nearly impossible, especially for the women), one gets a sense of authencity.  The one concession to movie artifice is probably Tuvia's rousing speech to the people from astride a white horse--very ""Braveheart/King Arthur""esque--but it's a stirring and wonderful speech as delivered by Craig.  Really, why is he messing about with James Bond?  Here he brings to life a TRUE action hero, and the results are stunning.Liev Schreiber as Zus is also a revelation.  None of Mr. Schreiber's previous roles had disposed me to put him in the top drawer of American actors, but here he more than holds his own opposite Craig.  One thinks the ""Wolverine"" movie is hardly worthy of his talents based on his work here.  Jamie Bell and George MacKay as the two youngest brothers are less central to the story but also comport themselves well.  Director Edward Zwick (""Glory"") is fond of the big historical canvas; as in his earlier film, committed performances from the leads elevate what could have been just a dry and somber historical lesson into a deeply-felt personal statement.  And just like ""Glory"", ""Defiance"" adds a much-needed chapter of previously-overlooked acts of heroism in war to our collective consciousness.  Be sure to watch the bonus features for a touching photographic tribute to some of these brave unsung soldiers who defied evil until the very end.",4,The Defiant Ones,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,3759,"['2008', 'holiday', 'season', 'gave', 'two', 'cinematic', 'efforts', 'detailing', 'true', 'stories', 'two', 'separate', 'acts', 'resistance', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Valkyrie', 'guaranteed', 'haunt', 'make', 'marvel', 'afresh', 'depths', 'cruelty', 'courage', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'capable', 'recommend', 'watching', 'double', 'bill', 'see', 'most', 'committed', 'acting', 'performances', 'recent', 'times.Powerhouse', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'reputation', 'here', 'most', 'versatile', 'passionate', 'actor', 'ever', 'fill', '007', 'shoes', 'Somewhere', 'grueling', 'shooting', 'schedules', 'two', 'Bond', 'films', 'also', 'found', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'grueling', 'picture', 'spending', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'location', 'Lithuania', 'speaking', 'very', 'credible', 'Russian', 'least', 'half', 'film', 'Tuvia', 'eldest', 'four', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'who', 'flee', 'vast', 'forests', 'Belarus', 'parents', 'are', 'brutally', 'slain', 'Nazi', 'collaborators', 'first', 'intent', 'only', 'own', 'survival', 'become', 'reluctant', 'protectors', 'ragtag', 'band', 'fellow', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'leadership', 'role', 'naturally', 'Tuvia', 'who', 'humanitarian', 'duty', 'save', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'personal', 'interests', 'daring', 'visit', 'Nazi-guarded', 'ghetto', 'number', 'swells', '1200', 'Tuvia', 'commander', 'sort', '20th-century', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'organize', 'forest', 'community', 'learning', 'woodsmanship', 'weaponry', 'survival', 'skills', 'Next-eldest', 'brother', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'not', 'content', 'remain', 'defensive', 'posture', 'nearby', 'Red', 'Army', 'battalion', 'can', 'kill', 'Germans', 'tension', 'vengeful', 'Zus', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'pacifistic', 'Tuvia', 'central', 'narrative', 'contrast', 'Valkyrie', 'script', 'essentially', 'events', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'minute', 'detail', 'story', 'Defiance', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'Bielski', 'Partisans', 'lived', 'forest', 'too', 'large', 'canvas', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'broadly', 'sketch', 'what', 'forest', 'existence', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'personalities', 'involved', 'do', 'get', 'pretty', 'vivid', 'taste', 'seasons', 'life', 'spent', 'wilderness', 'move', 'constantly', 'afraid', 'security', 'camp', 'Apart', 'everyone', 'looking', 'too', 'clean', 'personal', 'hygiene', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'especially', 'women', 'one', 'sense', 'authencity', 'one', 'concession', 'movie', 'artifice', 'probably', 'Tuvia', 'rousing', 'speech', 'people', 'white', 'horse', 'very', 'Braveheart/King', 'Arthur', 'esque', 'stirring', 'wonderful', 'speech', 'delivered', 'Craig', 'Really', 'why', 'messing', 'James', 'Bond', 'Here', 'life', 'TRUE', 'action', 'hero', 'results', 'are', 'stunning.Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Zus', 'also', 'revelation', 'None', 'Mr.', 'Schreiber', 'previous', 'roles', 'had', 'disposed', 'put', 'top', 'drawer', 'American', 'actors', 'here', 'more', 'own', 'opposite', 'Craig', 'One', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'hardly', 'worthy', 'talents', 'based', 'work', 'here', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'George', 'MacKay', 'two', 'youngest', 'brothers', 'are', 'less', 'central', 'story', 'also', 'comport', 'well', 'Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Glory', 'fond', 'big', 'historical', 'canvas', 'earlier', 'film', 'committed', 'performances', 'leads', 'elevate', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'dry', 'somber', 'historical', 'lesson', 'deeply-felt', 'personal', 'statement', 'just', 'Glory', 'Defiance', 'much-needed', 'chapter', 'previously-overlooked', 'acts', 'heroism', 'war', 'collective', 'consciousness', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'bonus', 'touching', 'photographic', 'tribute', 'brave', 'unsung', 'soldiers', 'who', 'defied', 'evil', 'very', 'end']",N/A

I was somewhat bothered by the jump in the story, as if the narrator was saying, ""so it continued for more than a year and then..."" A lot must have happened during the year. What happened?

I hadn't read about the Belieski brothers, although I have read a lot of stories behind World War II. I will say up front, now that I have done the research post movie-viewing, that the movie doesn't match the true story that closely. That being said, my title rings true.Taken out of the context of all the true details of the story, the movie is cohesive, tight, yet broad in scope. The storyline is simple; three brothers each react differently to the death of the other members of their family, and the deaths of their friends -- and how they ultimately survive the horror of being hunted by both Nazis and their own countrymen eager to turn them in for rewards from the Nazis. What they do to survive, what they do to help others survive, and how they differ is what gives the movie its depth.I was overwhelmed by the acting of Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber. Both are tour-de-force acting chops by actors that are already good. And the young actor, Jamie Bell, shows great promise if he grows into his potential shown here. The supporting roles, mostly played by virtual unknowns, and the location filming in Lithuania make for a surprisingly valid movie experience.While there are quibbles, and not a few anachronisms, overall I'd have no problem seeing this movie again and again.",4,"Sometimes, the truth is overrated in film",1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,1360,"['went', 'movie', 'previous', 'awareness', 'true', 'story', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Belieski', 'brothers', 'have', 'read', 'lot', 'stories', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'will', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'now', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'post', 'movie-viewing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'match', 'true', 'story', 'closely', 'being', 'said', 'title', 'rings', 'true.Taken', 'context', 'true', 'details', 'story', 'movie', 'cohesive', 'tight', 'yet', 'broad', 'scope', 'storyline', 'simple', 'three', 'brothers', 'react', 'differently', 'death', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'deaths', 'friends', 'how', 'ultimately', 'survive', 'horror', 'being', 'hunted', 'Nazis', 'own', 'countrymen', 'eager', 'turn', 'rewards', 'Nazis', 'What', 'do', 'survive', 'what', 'do', 'help', 'others', 'survive', 'how', 'differ', 'movie', 'depth.I', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'acting', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'are', 'tour-de-force', 'acting', 'chops', 'actors', 'are', 'already', 'good', 'young', 'actor', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'great', 'promise', 'potential', 'shown', 'here', 'supporting', 'roles', 'mostly', 'played', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'location', 'filming', 'Lithuania', 'make', 'surprisingly', 'valid', 'movie', 'are', 'quibbles', 'not', 'few', 'anachronisms', 'overall', ""'d"", 'have', 'problem', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'again']",N/A
1190339,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001FB55J4,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[7, 10]","""Defiance"" is a riveting and very different kind of WWII movie. Director and co-writer Edward Zwick, (who directed  the Civil War film ""Glory),"" also co-wrote this remarkable film, based on the nonfiction book by Dr. Nechama Tec. Zwick dramatically brings to the big screen the true life, inspiring story of the Bielski Brothers and their partisan brigade.When the Germans invaded Belorussia in 1941, they shot tens of thousands of Jews and confined those they did not shoot to ghettos. After the Germans killed the Bielski brothers' parents, the surviving sons fled to the forests of western Belorussia. Initially, the four brothers, Tuvia, (played by Daniel Craig, who gives a powerful and heartfelt performance), Asael, (Jamie Bell), Zus, (Liev Schreiber), and young Aaron, (George MacKay), attempted to save only their own lives by hiding from the Nazi SS troops. The Bielskis had been a farming family in a small village and knew the region well. In fact, their familiarity with the region and local customs along with some assistance from a few sympathetic gentile friends, allowed them to elude the Germans for some time. When more and more refugees from towns and shtels fled to the forests and met up with the Bielskis, the brothers made it their mission to take everyone in and form a group of partisans whose primary mission was to create a community and protect all Jewish members, regardless of age or gender. No one was ever turned away.Thus, the group eked out a life in nearby woodlands, always keeping on the move, always steps away from the enemy. They frequently fought small battles, stealing weapons from local farmers and dead Germans and Russians, who were also anti-Semitic and thought nothing of murdering Jews. The group chose Tuvia Bielski, a charismatic leader, to command them. His brothers served as his lieutenants. The film's battle scenes are realistic, thrilling and every bit as exciting as those in ""Glory"" and other successful epic war movies.Continuing to grow in number, they eventually formed a permanent base in a swampy, barely accessible region. Skilled workers were organized into groups - millers, bakers, teachers, those who washed clothes, and others who hunted and scoured the area for food and weapons. Although there was much suffering from the brutal winter cold, sickness and lack of food, these people were free with some hope of survival. Conflict also arose as to their mission - whether to take the strongest men and join the Soviet partisans who actively fought the Germans, or to remain a community in hiding, whose members' primary job was to live, despite the terrible odds.As with almost any human predicament, romance also existed here, as young men and women choose ""forest spouses."" Some of these couples married after the war.Ultimately 1200 members of the group survived. At the film's end, photographs of the brothers are shown and some details of their ultimate fates are given.Though the film was uneven at times, the story is truly gripping and I was very moved.""The Talmud asks why the human race was created as a single human being, as opposed to creating many people at once (like the animals which were created en masse). This teaches us that just as Adam was created in the beginning, and he was the entire human population of the world, likewise we need to look at each individual as if he/she were the entire population of the world. Therefore, when you save one life it is as if you saved the entire world.""Jana Perskie",4,"""Defiance"" - A Moving, Riveting, Unusual  Kind of WWII Film",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,3497,"['Defiance', 'riveting', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'WWII', 'movie', 'Director', 'co-writer', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'who', 'directed', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'Glory', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'remarkable', 'film', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'Dr.', 'Nechama', 'Tec', 'Zwick', 'dramatically', 'big', 'screen', 'true', 'life', 'inspiring', 'story', 'Bielski', 'Brothers', 'partisan', 'Germans', 'invaded', 'Belorussia', '1941', 'shot', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Jews', 'confined', 'did', 'not', 'shoot', 'ghettos', 'Germans', 'killed', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'parents', 'surviving', 'sons', 'fled', 'forests', 'western', 'Belorussia', 'Initially', 'four', 'brothers', 'Tuvia', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'powerful', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Asael', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'young', 'Aaron', 'George', 'MacKay', 'attempted', 'save', 'only', 'own', 'lives', 'hiding', 'Nazi', 'SS', 'troops', 'Bielskis', 'had', 'been', 'farming', 'family', 'small', 'village', 'knew', 'region', 'well', 'fact', 'familiarity', 'region', 'local', 'customs', 'assistance', 'few', 'sympathetic', 'gentile', 'friends', 'allowed', 'elude', 'Germans', 'time', 'When', 'more', 'more', 'refugees', 'towns', 'shtels', 'fled', 'forests', 'met', 'up', 'Bielskis', 'brothers', 'made', 'mission', 'take', 'everyone', 'form', 'group', 'partisans', 'primary', 'mission', 'was', 'create', 'community', 'protect', 'Jewish', 'members', 'regardless', 'age', 'gender', 'one', 'was', 'ever', 'turned', 'away.Thus', 'group', 'eked', 'out', 'life', 'nearby', 'woodlands', 'always', 'keeping', 'move', 'always', 'away', 'enemy', 'frequently', 'fought', 'small', 'battles', 'stealing', 'weapons', 'local', 'farmers', 'dead', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'anti-Semitic', 'thought', 'nothing', 'murdering', 'Jews', 'group', 'chose', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'command', 'brothers', 'served', 'lieutenants', 'film', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'thrilling', 'bit', 'as', 'exciting', 'Glory', 'other', 'successful', 'epic', 'war', 'movies.Continuing', 'grow', 'number', 'eventually', 'formed', 'permanent', 'base', 'swampy', 'barely', 'accessible', 'region', 'Skilled', 'workers', 'were', 'organized', 'groups', 'millers', 'bakers', 'teachers', 'who', 'washed', 'clothes', 'others', 'who', 'hunted', 'scoured', 'area', 'food', 'weapons', 'was', 'much', 'suffering', 'brutal', 'winter', 'cold', 'sickness', 'lack', 'food', 'people', 'were', 'free', 'hope', 'survival', 'Conflict', 'also', 'arose', 'mission', 'take', 'strongest', 'men', 'join', 'Soviet', 'partisans', 'who', 'actively', 'fought', 'Germans', 'remain', 'community', 'hiding', 'members', 'primary', 'job', 'was', 'live', 'terrible', 'odds.As', 'almost', 'human', 'predicament', 'romance', 'also', 'existed', 'here', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'choose', 'forest', 'spouses', 'couples', 'married', 'war.Ultimately', '1200', 'members', 'group', 'survived', 'film', 'end', 'photographs', 'brothers', 'are', 'shown', 'details', 'ultimate', 'fates', 'are', 'film', 'was', 'uneven', 'times', 'story', 'truly', 'gripping', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'Talmud', 'why', 'human', 'race', 'was', 'created', 'single', 'human', 'being', 'opposed', 'creating', 'many', 'people', 'once', 'animals', 'were', 'created', 'masse', 'just', 'Adam', 'was', 'created', 'beginning', 'was', 'entire', 'human', 'population', 'world', 'likewise', 'need', 'look', 'individual', 'he/she', 'were', 'entire', 'population', 'world', 'Therefore', 'when', 'save', 'one', 'life', 'saved', 'entire', 'world', 'Jana', 'Perskie']",N/A

My husband had never even heard of this movie when I gave it to him for Father's Day, but he was very interested in the subject matter. I had read a review of it, but it must not have been at local theaters long (if at all) because I seemed to have blinked and there it was on dvd. I do not regret this purchase as it was a wonderfully gripping, moving film about an untold story from World War II. My husband has an interest in the era and enjoys Daniel Craig as Bond, so this movie seemed a natural choice as a gift. We watched it together and agreed it was a story that needs to be told and a movie that needs to be seen. The story follows the three Bielski brothers, Jews who choose to hide from the Nazis (in the forest of their homeland Belarus) rather than submit to being hauled off to death camps. As their ragged band grows, conflicts arise within the group as the two older brothers struggle over their own relationship as well as the role of leader and everyone deals with issues ranging from food, shelter, illness, love, and jealousy. The film is violent by necessity but not gratuitously so. It raises the question of how to fight evil without being evil, and it doesn't blink away from the difficulty and ambiguousness of such a heavy issue. The dvd also includes interesting extras about the actual Bielski family.

It's a virtual hunt for the quarry, where those who don't overtly display themselves as Jewish are the game.  The Bielski brothers, a rugged trio of pseudo paramilitary farm-boys, take refuge in the wilderness where they attract a vast and ever-growing following of starving, desperate people escaping extermination.Soon enough the Bielski clan grows to over 1200, and along with their growing ranks comes a need to feed and support the group, not to mention actively fighting the Germans who would desire their death.  The brutality of war, and in particular the horrendously inhumane manner in which the Nazis treated the Jews, is explored, but the essence of the story falls within the anxiety and rejection of reason cemented deep within the existential aspects of survival.  With each daring raid for food and supplies, the philosophical clash of individuals on the brink of death causes tension within the group that grows to rival that of the enemy, as well as the local rogue Russian armies.  Eventually the Germans get wind of trouble in the forests, which causes the cat-and-mouse game of survival of the Bielski brothers and their fellow ensconced runaways.The power of Defiance is within the ability to entice the viewer to challenge and question the decisions involved in the flight or fight instincts faced by the Jewish during WWII.  Much like the rebellious group from Red Dawn - with an obviously more significant historical perspective - the elements of strategy, discipline, and solidarity against the enemy are present.  Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber deliver great performances as two main protagonists, Tuvia and Zus, but Jamie Bell steals the show as brother Asael Bielski.A truly compelling tale of non-glamorized primitive survival that is sure to touch a nerve, this is a somewhat hidden gem; and despite slow moments and weak romantic story arcs, it's a superb addition to the military history genre.",4,Confrontation of the passive Jew archetype,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,1992,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'Germans', 'are', 'slaughtering', 'Jews', 'thousands', 'virtual', 'hunt', 'quarry', 'where', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'overtly', 'display', 'Jewish', 'are', 'game', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'rugged', 'trio', 'pseudo', 'paramilitary', 'farm-boys', 'take', 'refuge', 'wilderness', 'where', 'attract', 'vast', 'ever-growing', 'following', 'starving', 'desperate', 'people', 'escaping', 'extermination.Soon', 'enough', 'Bielski', 'clan', '1200', 'growing', 'ranks', 'need', 'feed', 'support', 'group', 'not', 'mention', 'actively', 'fighting', 'Germans', 'who', 'would', 'desire', 'death', 'brutality', 'war', 'particular', 'horrendously', 'inhumane', 'manner', 'Nazis', 'treated', 'Jews', 'explored', 'essence', 'story', 'anxiety', 'rejection', 'reason', 'cemented', 'deep', 'existential', 'aspects', 'survival', 'daring', 'raid', 'food', 'supplies', 'philosophical', 'clash', 'individuals', 'brink', 'death', 'causes', 'tension', 'group', 'rival', 'enemy', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'rogue', 'Russian', 'armies', 'Eventually', 'Germans', 'get', 'trouble', 'forests', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'survival', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'fellow', 'ensconced', 'runaways.The', 'power', 'Defiance', 'ability', 'entice', 'viewer', 'challenge', 'question', 'decisions', 'involved', 'flight', 'fight', 'instincts', 'faced', 'Jewish', 'WWII', 'Much', 'rebellious', 'group', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'obviously', 'more', 'significant', 'historical', 'perspective', 'elements', 'strategy', 'discipline', 'solidarity', 'enemy', 'are', 'present', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'show', 'brother', 'Asael', 'Bielski.A', 'truly', 'compelling', 'tale', 'non-glamorized', 'primitive', 'survival', 'sure', 'touch', 'nerve', 'somewhat', 'hidden', 'gem', 'slow', 'moments', 'weak', 'romantic', 'story', 'arcs', 'superb', 'addition', 'military', 'history', 'genre']",N/A

The first third of the movie was riveting. The ne'er-do-well brothers meet after a devastating attack on their village in which loved ones have died. The only hope seems to be to take to the forests and hide. Before long, softhearted Tuvia (stony-faced Daniel Craig) is collecting stray Jews wandering the woods. Somehow, he and his brothers must manage to feed and protect this growing crowd.The first half of the film was terrific, with well-drawn characters and frightening situations. A subplot about a non-Jewish village friend deflecting drunken local police from Jews hiding in his barn was harrowing. Another detail about the existence of ""forest wives"" was tantalizing, but left mostly unexplored. By the halfway mark though, the plot had run out of steam. The little group was involved in one extended firefight after another. And the clich&eacute;s started piling up. See the grim competition among warrior brothers; see the toughening up of soft city-folk; the unexpected and unwelcome pregnancy; the poignant love story; the younger brother taking up the standard his older brother can no longer carry. Wartime clich&eacute;s abound as well. How many time must we watch a character suffer through a dazed period of deafness when a bomb falls close?Craig's character -- the tormented softie who must kill to survive -- is troublesome. First of all, I never believed that Daniel Craig, the new 007 with those cold, killer's eyes, would have any compunction about killing. Fairly early on, he proves my point, and the whole ""poor, tormented soul"" nonsense goes out the window for the rest of the film. Except for the wonderful Liev Schreiber, who plays Tuvia's gruff, brutish brother Zus, the cast is cutouts -- the scholar, the rabbi, the little brother, the girlfriend. An exception was one Russian officer, who signaled his nonchalance marvelously by whistling. But the biggest sin of ""Defiance"" was the way it turned Jewish people into anonymous ciphers. The Jews of Belorussia, hunted as faceless vermin by the Nazi extermination machine, become members of a faceless mob in this film, good only to be herded, led, bombed, strafed and shot. A series of Passover parallels is so obvious as to be distracting. And the ""Schindler's List"" ending, meant to be uplifting, is just another Holocaust movie clich&eacute; that papers over the film's cinematic failings.""Defiance"" means to honor a group of Jews who had the luck and pluck to resist a murderous regime. Ultimately, the film merely packages the Holocaust as a feel-good shoot-em-up.

The battle scenes included ambushes, raids and a confrontation with a tank (I don't know what it started as but it was a creditable reconstruction of a Mk IV). The battle scenes were fine - appropriately savage and when the German army proper entered the fray, they were clearly the 'A' team. There were a few Stukas too! I liked Daniel Craig's work in it all. Sure there were cliches and relationship sidetracks but it's hard to avoid these. There was some interesting material on some of the complexities of the time, like dealing with the Communist partisans and the impact of the Holocaust.

1190353,A1NX0436LKD1Q0,B001FB55J4,"Jon Stevens ""Journalist""","[1, 4]","Defiance is outstanding, totally moving. In biblical times, during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, forests of Russia, and now as the Israelis have proven for 60 years on the battlefield, Jews are excellent warriors. This is one of the few ever films that shows Jews as noble and heroes. With very few exceptions, Jews are presented by Hollywood as ugly and scum, culminating with Tom Cruise's anti-Semitic character in Tropic Thunder. He may sing and dance, but he's a repulsive, ugly human being. I therefore applaud the courage it took to make and release this film in face of a barrage of well financed effective Arab and Palestinian propoganda, and Obama proclaiming in Cairo that Islam has a ""tradition of tolerance"" when they practice terror against civilians. As shown in Defiance, the Jews must take care of their own people, which the outnumbered brave Israelis, having learned the lessons of history in Europe and the Arab countries, have been doing with honor. Bravo for Defiance!I've now seen the film a second time after many months have gone by and I was still profoundly moved by the courage of the Jewish partisans who fought the Nazis in the forests of Europe (mostly untold in the annals of history because Hollywood would prefer Jews to always be portrayed as victims rather than the heroes they are). It's amazing to realize that while all of Poland fell to the Germans in 14 days and the French not much longer, the handful hundreds of Jewish fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto, Poland, barely armed, overwhelmed by superior heavily armed elite SS troops backed up by planes and tanks sent to liquidate them, fought inch by inch and resisted the Nazis for an incredible 42 days! Defiance is a testament to the quality of the Jewish warrior, as so well expressed now by Israel's IDF, one of the best armies in the world, yet produced by a country of only 6 million Jews, a country without any natural resources, unlike their oil rich Arab neighbors. Just astounding. As an American Christian Evangelist, one of millions who respects and admires Israel, I highly recommend this film as a war film, and as a deeply moving film about the triumph of the human spirit.",5,Terrific story of heroism,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,2174,"['Defiance', 'outstanding', 'totally', 'moving', 'biblical', 'times', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'uprising', 'forests', 'Russia', 'now', 'Israelis', 'have', 'proven', '60', 'years', 'battlefield', 'Jews', 'are', 'excellent', 'warriors', 'one', 'few', 'ever', 'films', 'Jews', 'noble', 'heroes', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Jews', 'are', 'presented', 'Hollywood', 'ugly', 'scum', 'culminating', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'anti-Semitic', 'character', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'may', 'sing', 'dance', 'repulsive', 'ugly', 'human', 'being', 'therefore', 'courage', 'took', 'make', 'release', 'film', 'face', 'barrage', 'well', 'financed', 'effective', 'Arab', 'Palestinian', 'propoganda', 'Obama', 'proclaiming', 'Cairo', 'Islam', 'tradition', 'tolerance', 'when', 'practice', 'terror', 'civilians', 'shown', 'Defiance', 'Jews', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'own', 'people', 'outnumbered', 'brave', 'Israelis', 'having', 'learned', 'lessons', 'history', 'Europe', 'Arab', 'countries', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'honor', 'Bravo', 'Defiance', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'many', 'months', 'have', 'gone', 'was', 'still', 'profoundly', 'moved', 'courage', 'Jewish', 'partisans', 'who', 'fought', 'Nazis', 'forests', 'Europe', 'mostly', 'untold', 'annals', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'prefer', 'Jews', 'always', 'be', 'portrayed', 'victims', 'rather', 'heroes', 'are', 'amazing', 'realize', 'Poland', 'fell', 'Germans', '14', 'days', 'French', 'not', 'much', 'longer', 'handful', 'hundreds', 'Jewish', 'fighters', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Poland', 'barely', 'armed', 'overwhelmed', 'superior', 'heavily', 'armed', 'elite', 'SS', 'troops', 'backed', 'up', 'planes', 'tanks', 'sent', 'liquidate', 'fought', 'inch', 'inch', 'resisted', 'Nazis', 'incredible', '42', 'days', 'Defiance', 'testament', 'quality', 'Jewish', 'warrior', 'so', 'well', 'expressed', 'now', 'Israel', 'IDF', 'one', 'best', 'armies', 'world', 'yet', 'produced', 'country', 'only', '6', 'million', 'Jews', 'country', 'natural', 'resources', 'oil', 'rich', 'Arab', 'neighbors', 'Just', 'astounding', 'American', 'Christian', 'Evangelist', 'one', 'millions', 'who', 'Israel', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'war', 'film', 'deeply', 'moving', 'film', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

Slevin,"[0, 1]","Based on the true story of Partisan heroes the Bielski brothers, Defiance is set in very close proximity to the actual happenings in the forrests of Belarussia.  Daniel Craig playing Tuvia and Liev Schreiber playing Zus, two of three brothers who flee to the forrests close to their parents home after the Nazi forces start to kill off their Jewish friends and neighbors.Tuvia and Zus are the two older brothers who have lost their whole families.  You get a sense of the struggle to stay alive and to fight both as a Jew and as part of the Red army.  Zus and Tuvia are struggling between themselves as to which way to go as the numbers of refugees fleeing to the forrests start to swell the numbers following the three brothers.  You will witness acts of sheer boldness, going into occuppied areas to help others flee sure destruction.  You get a sense of a needing to act from the brothers, who have acted from the beginning.Part of the struggle is as to whether kill or hurt those still living a relatively normal life surrounded by war who supply those of the partisans with food.  You come to understand that everyone is asking these people for food, the Red Army, all the partisans and the German forces.  You need to read the two books to get more information on this, I will refer to them later.The action scenes are very intense, from defending themselves to moving from a camp they occuppied for most of a year as the German forces attack.  The movie attempts to give us the sense that the brothers are heros.  And you get more of the sense of that when you learn about it in the extras.  They were apart of the Great Generation, but from another land who you find in the extras make something of themselves when they move West.You wonder how so many could survive such difficult circumstances, lack of basics, harsh winters, worries about sudden attacks from an overwhelming force.Two good books to review are ""Defiance, The Bielski Partisans"", which really gets to the core of the day to day lives of the Partisan bands and gives you a clear picture of where our true heros come from.  The other, ""The Bielski Brothers.""  The latter has a little review of the daily lives with some interesting tales of actions of the partisons.This is a must see movie, although rated R mostly due to language, the actual war type content is with little gorey bloodshed.  I recommended it to my good friend who has three sons.  I think you will understand why when you see it.I am torn as to whether to recommend seeing the extras first or the movie.

1190358,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B001FB55J4,Julian Kennedy,"[8, 13]","Defiance: 4 out of 10: I have a soft spot for director Edward Zwick. I have a real soft spot for his Blood Diamond flick despite its pedestrian script and subconscious racism. In addition, The Last Samurai is another film of his that I loved despite its historical inaccuracies and bizarre lead casting. Defiance shares many of the same endemic faults that plagued those two films. I was not able to brush off the faults this time; I found them even more discordant as the film went on.Problem number one is Daniel Craig. He does not look like an Eastern Polish Jew. He looks like he misplaced his Oberstleutnant uniform at the Wehrmacht's cleaners. Even if you were able to accept Daniel Craig as some sort of Paul Newman style Jew who parachuted into Eastern Europe, only Helen Keller would buy him as Lev Schreiber's brother. A mutant dancing Australian with adamantium claws is a more believable brother for Schreiber than Craig is.In fact, Craig and Schreiber seem to be in two different films and Schreiber is in the much better one. Schreiber seems to be in the here and now with a strong subtle performance that is the best thing in the film. Daniel Craig's performance is as shaky as his accent. He, of course, is forced to do things like give Braveheart speeches from the back of a white horse, so the fault is hardly his alone. And saying platitudes such as 'Our vengeance is to live"" and ""Every day of freedom is like an act of faith"" while gazing at the camera with those, just give me an Oscar and I will go back to entertaining you, baby blues doesn't help his cause either.Problem number Two is best summarized by one of my favorite ladies:""I don't think we really need another film about the Holocaust, do we? It is like, how many have there been, you know. We get it. It was grim. Move on. No, I am doing it because I have noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust you are guaranteed an Oscar ... That is why I am doing it. Schindler's bloody List. The Pianist. Oscars coming out of their arse.""' Kate Winslet (Winner of the 2008 Best Actress Oscar for Holocaust drama The Reader) in Extras, 2005Defiance is clearly Oscar bait. In one scene Daniel 'Moses' Craig leads his people through the reeds and swamps and away from the forest (and inexplicably away from decent cover and fortifications) until a Rabbi collapses, sputters out ""I almost lost my faith but you were sent by God to save us' and then promptly dies... oy vey. It really is not that easy to make a mainstream Holocaust film, release it in December, and get no nominations* for Golden Globes or Oscars. Defiance is clearly trying too hard.The third problem is that a third rate cast of Fiddler on the Roof somehow showed up lost in the woods. Somebody call the Jewish stereotype prison, cause there has been a mass escape. Everyone is here. The nebbish intellectual who cannot hammer a nail, the passive Jews who are unwilling to fight, the greedy Jew more interested in money than his fellow man.

The movie does a decent job dramatizing the salient point that the heroic, defiant act of the Bielski partisans was not in killing Germans but in the saving over 1200 Jewish lives.  Of course the movie characters are an abstraction of many real-life individuals and the events portrayed are a generalization of typical experiences that occured.  The only highly fictional events are the end-movie action sequence involving a pitched battle and an attack on a German communications station to retrieve medicine.  Some interesting facts for the curious:- The Bielski brothers were a minority amongst Jews in Belorussia being simple, mostly uneducated peasant farmers and millers.  Most Jews were craftsmen who dwelled in the city.  Thus the brothers were particularly suited to surviving in the forests.- Often Jews often tried to escape the ghetos but were either caught by the Germans, denouced by Belorussian or Polish neighbors, or murdered in the forest by Russian partisans, which were particulary anti-Semetic- In reality food was distributed based on your value - fighters first, crafts people second, and then scraps for everybody else- In reality the women did not fight. There were simply not enough guns to go around.- The Bielski patisans did attack and kill Belorussians that denounced Jews and did help regular Russian partisans ambush Germans convoys and isolated outpost; however their primary mission was always saving Jews- The Bielski crafts people provided finished goods to other Partisan bands for food, thus keeping them in their good graces- All partisans routinely slaughtered prisoners. It was a necessary because there was no way to keep them.  Plus revenge.- Tuvia did in reality shoot several Jews who challenged his authority and threatened the overall survival of the group",4,A good Hollywood adaption,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1982,"['seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'encouraged', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'authored', 'Nechama', 'Tec', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'titled', 'Stalin', 'Guerrillas', 'written', 'Kenneth', 'Slepyan', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'salient', 'point', 'heroic', 'defiant', 'act', 'Bielski', 'partisans', 'was', 'not', 'killing', 'Germans', 'saving', '1200', 'Jewish', 'lives', 'course', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'abstraction', 'many', 'real-life', 'individuals', 'events', 'portrayed', 'are', 'generalization', 'typical', 'experiences', 'occured', 'only', 'highly', 'fictional', 'events', 'are', 'end-movie', 'action', 'sequence', 'involving', 'pitched', 'battle', 'attack', 'German', 'communications', 'station', 'retrieve', 'medicine', 'interesting', 'facts', 'curious', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'were', 'minority', 'amongst', 'Jews', 'Belorussia', 'being', 'simple', 'mostly', 'uneducated', 'peasant', 'farmers', 'millers', 'Most', 'Jews', 'were', 'craftsmen', 'who', 'dwelled', 'city', 'Thus', 'brothers', 'were', 'particularly', 'suited', 'surviving', 'forests.-', 'Often', 'Jews', 'often', 'tried', 'escape', 'ghetos', 'were', 'either', 'caught', 'Germans', 'denouced', 'Belorussian', 'Polish', 'neighbors', 'murdered', 'forest', 'Russian', 'partisans', 'were', 'particulary', 'anti-Semetic-', 'reality', 'food', 'was', 'distributed', 'based', 'value', 'fighters', 'first', 'crafts', 'people', 'second', 'then', 'scraps', 'everybody', 'else-', 'reality', 'women', 'did', 'not', 'fight', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'guns', 'go', 'around.-', 'Bielski', 'patisans', 'did', 'attack', 'kill', 'Belorussians', 'denounced', 'Jews', 'did', 'help', 'regular', 'Russian', 'partisans', 'ambush', 'Germans', 'convoys', 'isolated', 'outpost', 'however', 'primary', 'mission', 'was', 'always', 'saving', 'Jews-', 'Bielski', 'crafts', 'people', 'provided', 'finished', 'goods', 'other', 'Partisan', 'bands', 'food', 'thus', 'keeping', 'good', 'graces-', 'partisans', 'routinely', 'slaughtered', 'prisoners', 'was', 'necessary', 'was', 'way', 'keep', 'revenge.-', 'Tuvia', 'did', 'reality', 'shoot', 'several', 'Jews', 'who', 'challenged', 'authority', 'threatened', 'overall', 'survival', 'group']",N/A

1190368,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B001FB55J4,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[12, 12]","There is a myth, long-standing, that the Jews of Europe submitted passively to their fate at the hands of the Nazis and their willing helpers during World War II. According to this myth, Jewish resistance to the Holocaust did not exist, except perhaps in the Warsaw Ghetto, an anomalous, dramatic exception to a nightmarish reality in which Jews blandly climbed on board trains to be taken to unspeakable places to face an unspeakable fate.Fortunately, that myth is being exploded sixty years after the fact, and DEFIANCE, the story of the Bielski Partisans, is part of that process. The Bielski Partisans were led by the brothers Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron, Jews from White Russia (now Belarus), who took to the woods after their village was targeted by the Einsatzkommando ""B"", an SS killing corps.Many Jews, in fact, fled to the woods, and Jewish Resistance arose in many places throughout Europe. The Bielski experience in the dense Naliboki Forest is paradigmatic. The Jews of city and town, often tradesmen, small business owners, or scholar/intellectuals, were generally ill-equipped for the rough life of forest-dwellers. In this regard, the Bielskis, whose father had been a countryman, were peculiarly suited to lead. Having grown up in and around the woods and with a familiarity with tools and weapons, they became not only protectors but teachers in the art of survival.Tuvia (Daniel Craig) became the leader, quiet, intense, sincere, and often in a quandry both moral and practical. How does one lead men, and care for women and children in conditions of deprivation? How and when does a leader lead or let himself be guided?  How does a leader, as an authority, assert that authority?Tuvia ""would rather save one old Jewish woman than kill a dozen Nazis,"" but he is no milquetoast. He takes vengeance on the local Russian officer responsible for killing his parents. Nazis paid a bounty to those who betrayed their Jewish neighbors. Jews were worth 500 rubles a head, a small fortune to many starving peasants. Much later, he settles a challenge to his leadership from within by executing the mutineer.Craig, known for his role as James Bond, really shows that his talents are wasted as the suave British spy. As Tuvia Bielski, he shines, an ordinary man called upon to do extraordinary things.His younger, bigger, tougher brother, Zus (Liev Schreiber) is a firebrand. Although the Bielski Partisans engage small ""hunting parties"" in firefights, Zus believes the battle can be better fought on a larger scale, and joins the Red Partisans. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism within the Soviet ranks makes him an outsider, and he eventually returns to his brothers.Schrieber, whose physical presence is imposing, plays Zus by tapping into some deep reservoir of anger within himself. It's an impressive performance, by far the strongest in the film.Asael is younger, as is Aron, and both younger brothers dedicate themselves to forming a structured community for the growing forest community, establishing schools for the children, an infirmary for the ill, workshops for non-combatants, where they repaired rifles, loaded cartridges, sewed clothing, and built shelters and bunkers, and foraging parties that collected (by hook or by crook) food, tools, and other necessaries from the locals.There are a number of large-scale battles between the German Army (supplied with tanks, machine guns and half-tracks) and the woefully underarmed Bielskis, which the Partisans, impossibly, win.

Three Jewish peasants escape to the surrounding forest after they return to the family home after a day at work to find everyone massacred. As they begin to build a camp they discover others who have also fled into the forest, fleeing the Nazi murderers. The reluctantly collect their fellow survivors and transform them into an effective band of partisan fighters, even leading people out of the ghettos where they face certain death. ""If we die, at least we will die free"" is their motto. It one point, when at seems that death is upon them, the youngest brother encourages the group by reminding them that they have already done the impossible and that they will go on and triumph by their own will and unanimity. And they do- living in the forest for two more years and managing to have a makeshift school, hospital, and nursery-all in the midst of the most appalling adversity.The special features on the disc are terrific, including interviews with the descendants of the brothers and stories of 19,000 people who survived or were born to the survivors led by these three brothers.The youngest brother was killed fighting on the Russian front after leaving the forest but the other two Bielski brothers eventually got to the United States where they became part of the American dream that has been the miracle for so many from so many countries.I urge anyone who is looking for something that will uplift and strengthen you to buy this movie.

On the other hand, there are Zwick's films like The Last Samurai and Legends of the Fall, which are kitsch both artistically and historically, but which I love. Therefore I sometimes have an issue with Amazon's rating system - I like this movie, though it rates three stars in terms of quality.I think we are all old enough to know that in appealing to the broad American public in order to make money there are certain conventions which Hollywood adheres to. Sure, I would have preferred to see the Bielski Brothers portrayed as the very young men that they were during this period. Or to have the relationship [ established prior to the German invasion]and the political differences between the Bielskis' and the Red Army commanders explained rather than dumbed down to plain old antisemitism. Or not have Daniel Craig making Braveheart type speeches from astride his white horse, or take on a tank corps almost single- handed. And yet, despite that and despite the controversy about what the partisans did and didn't do or how they treated the peasantry, the subject of this film --survival instead of passive acceptance- is a fascinating and important one. The fact is, the times were terrible, groups splintered along ethnic, national and political lines, fought each other occasionally and all appropriated food from the peasantry. All did what they had to do to ensure their own survival and/or that of their group.I really thought this was Craig's deepest role, and he did show torment, indecision, brutality along with kindness and remorse very well -angst, fear, and torment are hardly exclusive to more recent generations. Additionally his brother Zus was very candidly shown as a brutal man, callous toward the peasantry, relentless in his extermination of all those whom he perceived as being collaborators, and yet as a brave man who took up the gun to fight. What was so interesting to me was that this group, whatever its moral and ethical shortcomings in life, managed to form a community with a school, an infirmary, kitchens etc in the heart of the forest and lived to see the end of the war. Also interesting is that these people followed the Bielskis, [emerging as strong men in troubled times] whom they would have spurned for their lowly social position and rude ways prior to the war.

1190384,AAW58LG72PG7I,B001FB55J4,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","DEFIANCE is a war movie but it is also a movie of conscience.  From the time that the Germans overran Poland to start the Second World War, Hollywood tended to tell the big picture.  The hero was often a stern figure in the John Wayne mold or an eager kid like Audie Murphy.  Director Edward Zwick took a different route.  He read about the real life exploits of the Bielski brothers who led more than one thousand Poles and Belorussians out of the ghetto to hide in the forest and become partisans against the Germans.  What makes the tale especially telling is his presentation of Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), the leader of the partisans, as one who became leader only by default.  There was no one else to step up.  Tuvia's brother Zus (Liev Schrieber) fights Tuvia almost as often as he does the Germans.  Wartime forces men to show who they are and what they stand for, and when it comes time to killing the enemy, questions about the morality of doing so are quickly raised but almost as quickly postponed for a time when luxury permits hindsight.  Zus wants revenge for his slaughtered family.  Tuvia counters that revenge is mutually exclusive with survival.  Zus adds that only revenge will give them the moral strength to go on.  And so the dialogue goes.  This emphasis on morality is needed in films that so often lack it.  When the debating of morality dies down, the action part of the movie provides a non-verbal context that implies that both brothers are right, and rightness is a function that varies from man to man.DEFIANCE presents the Bielskis as multi-dimensional figures who are faced with the impossible task of saving hundreds of Jews when doing so imperils their own lives.  This question of what is and is not possible arises again and  again.  When the Germans force the Bielski partisans to muck their way through a deadly swamp, one of the group cries out that to do so is impossible.  One of the Bielskis shouts that their very survival to that moment has been impossible.  Courage and hope are commodities that are often in short supply during the best of peaceful times.  DEFIANCE suggests that they may be found even in the hearts and minds of force fed heroes who doubt who they are but their followers insist that like Moses such leaders are chosen by God for a good reason.",4,A Story That Long Needed Telling,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2312,"['DEFIANCE', 'war', 'movie', 'also', 'movie', 'conscience', 'time', 'Germans', 'overran', 'Poland', 'start', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Hollywood', 'tended', 'tell', 'big', 'picture', 'hero', 'was', 'often', 'stern', 'figure', 'John', 'Wayne', 'mold', 'eager', 'kid', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'took', 'different', 'route', 'read', 'real', 'life', 'exploits', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'who', 'led', 'more', 'one', 'thousand', 'Poles', 'Belorussians', 'ghetto', 'hide', 'forest', 'become', 'partisans', 'Germans', 'What', 'tale', 'especially', 'telling', 'presentation', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'leader', 'partisans', 'one', 'who', 'became', 'leader', 'only', 'default', 'was', 'one', 'else', 'step', 'up', 'Tuvia', 'brother', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'fights', 'Tuvia', 'almost', 'as', 'often', 'Germans', 'Wartime', 'forces', 'men', 'show', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'stand', 'when', 'time', 'killing', 'enemy', 'questions', 'morality', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'quickly', 'raised', 'almost', 'quickly', 'postponed', 'time', 'when', 'luxury', 'permits', 'hindsight', 'Zus', 'revenge', 'slaughtered', 'family', 'Tuvia', 'counters', 'revenge', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'survival', 'Zus', 'only', 'revenge', 'will', 'give', 'moral', 'strength', 'go', 'so', 'dialogue', 'emphasis', 'morality', 'needed', 'films', 'so', 'often', 'lack', 'When', 'debating', 'morality', 'dies', 'down', 'action', 'part', 'movie', 'non-verbal', 'context', 'brothers', 'are', 'right', 'rightness', 'function', 'man', 'man.DEFIANCE', 'presents', 'Bielskis', 'multi-dimensional', 'figures', 'who', 'are', 'faced', 'impossible', 'task', 'saving', 'hundreds', 'Jews', 'when', 'doing', 'so', 'imperils', 'own', 'lives', 'question', 'what', 'not', 'possible', 'arises', 'again', 'again', 'When', 'Germans', 'force', 'Bielski', 'partisans', 'muck', 'way', 'deadly', 'swamp', 'one', 'group', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'impossible', 'One', 'Bielskis', 'very', 'survival', 'moment', 'been', 'impossible', 'Courage', 'hope', 'are', 'commodities', 'are', 'often', 'short', 'supply', 'best', 'peaceful', 'times', 'DEFIANCE', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'even', 'hearts', 'minds', 'force', 'fed', 'heroes', 'who', 'doubt', 'who', 'are', 'followers', 'insist', 'like', 'Moses', 'such', 'leaders', 'are', 'chosen', 'God', 'good', 'reason']",N/A

1190386,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001FB55J4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 2]","Defiance tells the true story of the three eldest strong-willed and brave Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, and Asael, who lead a group of their fellow Jews through the forest in Eastern Europe during the dark days of Nazi occupation in World War Two. The movie truly is a work of art with excellent character development and plenty of action, suspense, and drama mixed with poignant moments. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography lacks nothing either. The acting is profoundly convincing and I must say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. The subject matter is such that of course it's not a family movie; there's quite a bit of violence and I do not recommend this for small children. On the other hand, when children are old enough to study the Holocaust this movie can be a very useful educational device, especially as this is all a true story.The story begins in 1941 when the Bielski brothers lose their parents and most of their small village to Nazis who raid the town and kill the Jewish people almost for sport. We meet Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), his brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) and their very young brother Aron (George MacKay). How did these Jewish brothers survive the Nazi attack? Tuvia and Zus managed to quickly hide in the forest while Aron hid in the cellar. There's also another Bielski brother named Asael (Jamie Bell) and these four brothers clearly have the leadership skills it will take for them to survive at least for a little while in the forest not too far from their former village. However, things begin to change quite unexpectedly when other Jews join them in the forest. Eventually, more and more Jewish refugees join them in the forest until they numbered roughly twelve hundred people. There are love affairs that blossom and happier moments punctuated by fierce attacks on the road as the Bielski brothers kill Nazis to get their weapons and medicine and we witness two or three deadly Nazi attacks on the forest refugees as well.There's another ongoing plot that is equally interesting. While Zus Bielski wants to join the Russian forces and fight with them, his brother Tuvia prefers to stay in the forest with the refugees and function as their leader. When the brothers finally come to blows over the matter it becomes clear that Zus will join the Russians and Tuvia will remain with the other Jews. Asael and Aron also remain with the Jews.Look for particularly excellent performances by Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, Alexa Davalos as Lilka, the woman Tuvia marries, and Mia Wasikowska who plays Chaya Dziencielsky, the woman Asael marries. All the others give very strong performances as well; I truly felt like I was watching live action unfold right before my very eyes. This is all so well done and so powerful it almost felt more real than just a movie.The DVD comes with interesting extras. I particularly liked ""Defiance: Return to the Forest;"" ""Children of The Otriad"" and ""Bielski Partisan Survivors."" There is also an optional commentary with director Edward Zwick.Defiance will forever be one of the most powerful and moving films depicting the struggles of Jews just to stay alive during the horrors of the Holocaust. The acting is outstanding and the story of the Bielski brothers is true; I highly recommend this film.",5,"""Nothing is impossible, what we all have done is impossible!""",1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,3313,"['Defiance', 'true', 'story', 'three', 'eldest', 'strong-willed', 'brave', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'Asael', 'who', 'lead', 'group', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'forest', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'dark', 'days', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'movie', 'truly', 'work', 'art', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'plenty', 'action', 'suspense', 'drama', 'mixed', 'poignant', 'moments', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'nothing', 'either', 'acting', 'profoundly', 'convincing', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'subject', 'matter', 'such', 'course', 'not', 'family', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'small', 'children', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'study', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'educational', 'device', 'especially', 'true', 'story.The', 'story', '1941', 'when', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'lose', 'parents', 'most', 'small', 'village', 'Nazis', 'who', 'raid', 'town', 'kill', 'Jewish', 'people', 'almost', 'sport', 'meet', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'brother', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'very', 'young', 'brother', 'Aron', 'George', 'MacKay', 'How', 'did', 'Jewish', 'brothers', 'survive', 'Nazi', 'attack', 'Tuvia', 'Zus', 'managed', 'quickly', 'hide', 'forest', 'Aron', 'hid', 'cellar', 'also', 'Bielski', 'brother', 'named', 'Asael', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'four', 'brothers', 'clearly', 'have', 'leadership', 'will', 'take', 'survive', 'least', 'little', 'while', 'forest', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'former', 'village', 'However', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'when', 'other', 'Jews', 'join', 'forest', 'Eventually', 'more', 'more', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'join', 'forest', 'numbered', 'roughly', 'twelve', 'hundred', 'people', 'are', 'love', 'affairs', 'blossom', 'happier', 'moments', 'punctuated', 'fierce', 'attacks', 'road', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'kill', 'Nazis', 'get', 'weapons', 'medicine', 'witness', 'two', 'three', 'deadly', 'Nazi', 'attacks', 'forest', 'refugees', 'well.There', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Zus', 'Bielski', 'join', 'Russian', 'forces', 'fight', 'brother', 'Tuvia', 'prefers', 'stay', 'forest', 'refugees', 'function', 'leader', 'When', 'brothers', 'finally', 'come', 'blows', 'matter', 'clear', 'Zus', 'will', 'join', 'Russians', 'Tuvia', 'will', 'remain', 'other', 'Jews', 'Asael', 'Aron', 'also', 'remain', 'Jews.Look', 'particularly', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Alexa', 'Davalos', 'Lilka', 'woman', 'Tuvia', 'marries', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'who', 'Chaya', 'Dziencielsky', 'woman', 'Asael', 'marries', 'others', 'give', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'truly', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'live', 'action', 'unfold', 'right', 'very', 'eyes', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'powerful', 'almost', 'felt', 'more', 'real', 'just', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'extras', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Defiance', 'Return', 'Forest', 'Children', 'Otriad', 'Bielski', 'Partisan', 'Survivors', 'also', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'Edward', 'Zwick.Defiance', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'moving', 'films', 'depicting', 'struggles', 'Jews', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'story', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'true', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

I wasn't sure what to expect, but after the film started I was very impressed.  I wont be commenting on the authenticity of this film, or how well it relates to the actual events that took place, instead on the content featured, parts played, etc.First off like always, Daniel Craig is razor sharp!  From the first time he hits the screen to the end credits hes got you.  He does such a good job despite the circumstances he and his brother are facing.  He immediately takes the ""leader"" position and keeps his wits about him, even though they are being ""hunted"" through the Belarussian Forest.  Liev Schreiber also does an excellent job as Craig's brother, Zus Bielski.The fact that something like this happened, and that the Germans could have done the things they did, provides the shock factor for this movie.  The entire theater sat perfectly quiet throughout the movie, with the exception of people perking up in their seats when the Bielski Brothers got a bit of revenge.The point from which this movie was shot is a nice change from the concentration camps and German view we've seen in other movies.  The way these people dig in, band together (with the exception of a few outcasts) and survive is amazing, and makes for a really touching movie (historically accurate or not) Some scenes are a bit depressing, and some even have that tense feeling of ""what the heck are they gonna do"".All the characters are very believable, and I think they do a great job of helping you get to know them.  At the same time this makes certain scenes heartbreaking...which to me makes a movie even more memorable!I don't wanna ruin anything from the actual movie so Ill just end with saying, if you enjoy movies, being entertained, and taking a look at the way things once were from people who lived it CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT!

Fortunately this is not the case as it wasn't with ""Glory"" (1989) also directed by Zwick!The story, based on real characters, follows four Belarusian brothers of Jewish ancestry driven into the forest to escape the Nazi extermination parties.There they will be joined little by little by other escapees till they number more than a thousand.Tuvia Bielski the elder brother takes charge of them and organizes them into a heterogeneous Brigade. He decides that if they are able to live one more day and die free, it is worth the sacrifice.Incredibly they survive against all odds: collaborationist police troops, Nazi SS troops, refractory non-Jew civilians and prejudiced Soviet militia.No weapons, no food, no shelter, no experience. Only their outmost determination to survive and pay back sustains them!Playacting is over standard with Daniel Craig as Tuvia, Liev Schreiber as Zus Bielski, Allan  Corduner as Shamon Haretz and Ravil Isyanov as Colonel Panchenko as the best of a compact numerous cast.Edward Zwick delivers one his best film up to this day.

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 15]","It's very easy to assume that Defiance is a wish-fulfillment revenge narrative wherein we finally witness stories of common folks who resisted the Nazis with tooth and nail.  A certainentertainment magazinereviewer blithely dismissed the entire film as too ""Hollywood,"" because Tuvia (Daniel Craig) murders the entire family who assisted in the Nazis in wiping out his family. The review's assessment couldn't be further from the truth.Defiance is the true story of Tuvia and Zus Bielski (Liev Schrieber), two brothers who lived on the fringes of polite Jewish society by surviving in the deep woods, more akin to bandits than heroes.  Where Tuvia is cool-headed, Zus is dangerously violent.  The two soon discover a widening circle of friends and distant relatives seeking their protection, until Tuvia is moved to rescue Jews from a ghetto.  Now he has to contend with well-bred city folks who know nothing about surviving in the Russian winter.Defiance never glamorizes death.  The Nazi attacks share less screen time, presumably because audiences need no convincing about the nature of their crimes.  But even the Bielski retaliation against German troops is miserable -- Germans plead for their lives even as they are executed.  War, Defiance tells us, is reprehensible, and it is a task for rough men. The question is if rough men are responsible for protecting the weak. Why should soldiers protect civilians?Every ugly part of war is on full display here: defections, in-fighting, disease, starvation, alliances of convenience (between men and women, Russians and Jews), bigotry, incompetence, loss of faith, and yes, brutal, bloody revenge.  By the end of the film, audiences are less likely to feel vindicated as they are disgusted by the places Defiance takes us. This is not a feel good film, not even as a revenge fantasy.Defiance doesn't cover every angle.  As criminals themselves, the Bielskis surely committed crimes we don't see on screen (see the Wikipedia entry on the Bielski partisans for more).

I've been to the Holocaust Museum in DC as well. There are so many stories of people helping others survive persecution during the war. Every time I discover a new one I'll watch the movie or read the book. This movie was inspirational because it showed how they chose to fight for their survival rather than wait to be exterminated by a government that wanted to rid Europe of Jewish people. I'm glad they make movies like this because it shows how communities can unite to help each other and how we all need each other to have hope. The Rabbi in the story said something profound, too. He said that the war had almost made him lose his faith in God, but the Bielski brothers restored his belief. I loved the way they alluded to having to cross the water to freedom and how it was like when Moses parted the Red Sea. A very inspirational film. Those brave brothers led a movement that allowed 1200 people to survive the war. Two or three people can make a difference when their leadership inspires others to live. Great acting too!

This movie is no exception, telling the story of the three Bielski brothers in Belarus, during the Second World War.  At a time when the Nazis were rounding up the Jewish families for the ghettos and concentration camps, murdering tens of thousands as they went, these brothers survived and fled into the forests they knew so well.  They are an anachronism, Jews who did not share the view of the majority of peaceful resistance.. they fought for their freedom living a harsh life in the forest under constant threat.Zwick certainly elicits some strong performances from each of the three brothers.  Daniel Craig, who becomes the de facto leader -  the compassionate one, and Liev Schreiber outstanding as the brother who wants to take the fight to the Germans.  Jamie Bell is also good but makes less of an impact as the third and youngest brother, undergoing a loss of innocence.  The satisfying part of the story is the first half as we really explore these flawed characters - unwilling leaders whose true character emerges, in spite of perceptions of others, and even perceptions they had about themselves.  It never becomes dull, but it does become more `by-the-numbers' once the Germans are closing in and we get to the final battle, and things get tied up a little less ambiguously than the tone the movie starts out with.The relationship with the Russians, what happened to those who sheltered or aided the Jewish survivors, the harshness of conditions the survivors endured and the numbing effect of the killing and futility of revenge are all ably explored.  Its real resonance however, lies in the knowledge of it being a true story, portraying a side of the story of Jewish persecution in WW II that is lesser known - and an important counterpoint to the common images and tales of the period.  It's just a pity that the director tells it quite so straight, using visual and audio styles and cues that feel more borrowed than original.  It remains a movie that is worthwhile and well put together, even if stopping short of being a classic.",4,Moving account of the Jews who fought back,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,2199,"['Edward', 'Zwick', 'mastered', 'knack', 'making', 'movies', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'combined', 'well', 'edited', 'sequences', 'depicting', 'battles', 'action', 'movie', 'exception', 'telling', 'story', 'three', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'Belarus', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'time', 'when', 'Nazis', 'were', 'rounding', 'up', 'Jewish', 'families', 'ghettos', 'concentration', 'camps', 'murdering', 'tens', 'thousands', 'went', 'brothers', 'survived', 'fled', 'forests', 'knew', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'anachronism', 'Jews', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'share', 'view', 'majority', 'peaceful', 'resistance..', 'fought', 'freedom', 'living', 'harsh', 'life', 'forest', 'constant', 'threat.Zwick', 'certainly', 'strong', 'performances', 'three', 'brothers', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'compassionate', 'one', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'outstanding', 'brother', 'who', 'take', 'fight', 'Germans', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'also', 'good', 'less', 'impact', 'third', 'youngest', 'brother', 'undergoing', 'loss', 'innocence', 'satisfying', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'really', 'explore', 'flawed', 'characters', 'unwilling', 'leaders', 'true', 'character', 'emerges', 'spite', 'perceptions', 'others', 'even', 'perceptions', 'had', 'never', 'dull', 'become', 'more', 'by-the-numbers', 'once', 'Germans', 'are', 'closing', 'get', 'final', 'battle', 'things', 'get', 'tied', 'up', 'little', 'less', 'ambiguously', 'tone', 'movie', 'out', 'with.The', 'relationship', 'Russians', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'sheltered', 'aided', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'harshness', 'conditions', 'survivors', 'endured', 'numbing', 'effect', 'killing', 'futility', 'revenge', 'are', 'ably', 'explored', 'real', 'resonance', 'however', 'knowledge', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'portraying', 'side', 'story', 'Jewish', 'persecution', 'WW', 'II', 'lesser', 'known', 'important', 'counterpoint', 'common', 'images', 'tales', 'period', 'just', 'pity', 'director', 'quite', 'so', 'straight', 'using', 'visual', 'audio', 'styles', 'cues', 'feel', 'more', 'borrowed', 'original', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'even', 'stopping', 'short', 'being', 'classic']",N/A

Living in the woods and hiding from Germans, local police co-opted by the SS, and surviving by whatever means necessary, DEFIANCE drives home the point that survival, even when it's ugly, is a beautiful and compelling thing. But it is in that act of living that the varying shades of gray of both life and war are applied, and Defiance is pretty good at showing imperfections of its heroes right alongside their bravery. The movie is best when it is focused not on skirmishes between the Germans and the Bielski insurgents, but on the ways that people compromise to stay alive. The movie's depictions of forest life--including building shelters, cooking, huddling together in the extreme cold--are all powerful reminders of how easy most of our lives are, and of the steel that sometimes is found beneath human skin. The will to live is powerful, and when the movie portrays that it is fantastic.Captivating, entertaining, complex, and largely well done, DEFIANCE has but a few flaws--there are things that just don't ring true in the movie (a battle with a German tank for example) but these are not distracting from the meat of the story.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 4]","From Glory director Edward Zwick comes Defiance, an account of some not as well-known as they should be heroics by the Bielski brothers during World War II.  Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell star as the heroic Jewish brothers, who seek to withstand the Nazi onslaught in the forests, and join up with Russian resistance fighters as well.  Where Defiance works is by and far with its trio of main actors; all of whom are wonderfully compelling in their roles.  The rest of the film however doesn't always quite manage to hold up to its stars though, as it beings to plod itself down and just get too wrapped up in itself throughout its middle section.

Polish Catholics were targeted by the NKVD and executed or sent to the gulags. However, Jews were generally grasped to the Soviet bosom and frequently were given positions of authority.When Hitler broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaaty on June 22. 1941, the Germans invaded the Russian occupied Nowogrodek region where the Bielski family lived and the Jews were treated badly by the Nazis, as the Polish Catholics were badly treated both by the Nazis and the Soviets.The Bielski Partisan group did little damage to the German army. They did, however, extort and terrorize the Christian population who were, like the Bielskis, Polish citizens. The murder of 128 Christians in the village of Naliboki is generally understood to have been a Bielski war crime, one of many. The Polish Catholics had formed an underground in 1939, the AK (home army) which actively fought both the Nazi and Soviet invaders at a cost of hundreds of thousands of Catholic lives. It did more damage to the Germans than partisan activities in any other country. At the end of World War II, the Bielski family was allowed to emigrate, and most finally wound up in the USA. Polish Catholics were not allowed to flee to the West but were subjected to 50 years of Soviet occupation, worse even than that of the Nazis.

1190415,A3SH2OT200EUO6,B001FB55J4,"Paul G. Bens, Jr.","[21, 26]","I've noticed that a number of the other reviews of this picture have actually been more of a debate as to whether the Bielski brothers at the core have been accurately represented from an historical perspective rather than an examination of the film.  Now, let me start this off by saying that I knew nothing of the true-life story upon which this is based; so I am not prepared to comment on how the film translates the actual story to the screen or whether those aspects of the story are accurate to history with respect to the brothers.  My look at this is strictly at the picture as a piece of film making and on that front, I thought it was an average film which was surprisingly week on emotional impact.  That surprised me given the central story which should have been an emotionally powerful one.The are a number of things that keep Defiance from having any kind of lasting impact on me as a viewer.  First and foremost is the script which not only tends to be repetitive, but also fails to establish the brothers at the beginning of the picture.  We have no idea who these men are from a personality standpoint before we are launched into the crux of the conflict, both from a narrative standpoint and a sibling conflict.  Also, the dialog is not particularly well crafted and there are moments when the screenwriters attempted to interject some humor.  Unfortunately, because the relationships are not clear, the humor comes of banal and grossly out of place. The attempts at humor come off as attempts at lame one-liners.The other major problem with the script is that it never seemed to decide what it wanted to be.  If this a story of survival at all costs?  Perhaps.  But then we're off into the basic conflict between the two brothers.  And then it seems to want to become a love story with no less than three of the lead men giving long hard stares at women. And then it becomes an action piece. The problem is, it never focuses on any one of these things long enough to grab the viewer.  Don't get me wrong, movies can be complex, but the shift from one focus to the other are jarring and that, at a core level, this is the responsibility of the screenwriter, or at the very least the director who should be able to smooth things out.Casting wise, the choices were fine, though Daniel Craig does seem horribly out of place and mis-cast.  Each turns in decent performance, but none of them have any emotional depth.  So even though Shreiber (an actor I don't usually care for) is actually very good and Billy Elliot's Jaime Bell is very good, the script and direction abandon them.  We never get the chance to invest in any of them before we're focusing on one of the others.The remaining cast are competent, but they are saddled with flat, un-dynamic characters and some out-and-out stereotypes. Without a script to support them, each of the supporting actors are reduced to unimpressive stock players.Oh, and the pace of this film can be dreadfully slow at times, again due to lack of any interesting nuances in the script.In the end, this should have been a powerful and moving film, but it wasn't.  It was certainly acceptable but it never rises above average and, sadly, forgettable despite the real-life story behind it.",3,Strangely Distant,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,3243,"[""'ve"", 'noticed', 'number', 'other', 'reviews', 'picture', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'more', 'debate', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'core', 'have', 'been', 'accurately', 'represented', 'historical', 'perspective', 'rather', 'examination', 'film', 'Now', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'knew', 'nothing', 'true-life', 'story', 'based', 'am', 'not', 'prepared', 'comment', 'how', 'film', 'actual', 'story', 'screen', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'accurate', 'history', 'respect', 'brothers', 'look', 'strictly', 'picture', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'front', 'thought', 'was', 'average', 'film', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'week', 'emotional', 'impact', 'surprised', 'given', 'central', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'one.The', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'keep', 'Defiance', 'having', 'kind', 'lasting', 'impact', 'viewer', 'First', 'foremost', 'script', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'repetitive', 'also', 'establish', 'brothers', 'beginning', 'picture', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'men', 'are', 'personality', 'standpoint', 'are', 'launched', 'crux', 'conflict', 'narrative', 'standpoint', 'sibling', 'conflict', 'Also', 'dialog', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'crafted', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'screenwriters', 'attempted', 'interject', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'humor', 'banal', 'grossly', 'place', 'attempts', 'humor', 'come', 'off', 'attempts', 'lame', 'one-liners.The', 'other', 'major', 'problem', 'script', 'never', 'seemed', 'decide', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'story', 'survival', 'costs', 'Perhaps', 'then', ""'re"", 'off', 'basic', 'conflict', 'two', 'brothers', 'then', 'want', 'become', 'love', 'story', 'less', 'three', 'lead', 'men', 'giving', 'long', 'hard', 'stares', 'women', 'then', 'action', 'piece', 'problem', 'never', 'one', 'things', 'long', 'enough', 'grab', 'viewer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'complex', 'shift', 'one', 'focus', 'other', 'are', 'jarring', 'core', 'level', 'responsibility', 'screenwriter', 'very', 'least', 'director', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'smooth', 'things', 'out.Casting', 'wise', 'choices', 'were', 'fine', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'seem', 'horribly', 'place', 'mis-cast', 'decent', 'performance', 'none', 'have', 'emotional', 'depth', 'So', 'even', 'Shreiber', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'Jaime', 'Bell', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'direction', 'abandon', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'invest', ""'re"", 'focusing', 'one', 'others.The', 'remaining', 'cast', 'are', 'competent', 'are', 'saddled', 'flat', 'un-dynamic', 'characters', 'out-and-out', 'stereotypes', 'script', 'support', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'reduced', 'unimpressive', 'stock', 'players.Oh', 'pace', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'times', 'again', 'due', 'lack', 'interesting', 'nuances', 'script.In', 'end', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'moving', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'certainly', 'acceptable', 'never', 'above', 'average', 'sadly', 'forgettable', 'real-life', 'story']",N/A

There is a power stuggle on who will be commander of the camp, and there are cultural and social differences between intellectuals and the working class Jews.  As the number of the people in the camp grows so are the challenges to find food, medicine and shelter for them all.  Local peasants are divided in who to help: Red Army or Jewish ""bandits"" as they are labeled.  There is definitely a moral dilemma on how to apprach this effort in survival.  Is diplomacy the way to go, or do they have to resort to force in order to overcome their enemies.Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber give impressive performances of two brothers who are polar opposites in the way they approach their survival methods.

Kyle,"[197, 218]","One wonders why it took so long to tell the story of the three Bielski brothers, who managed to save the lives of 1200 Jews during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II. My personal answer is that they didn't have anyone near the caliber of Daniel Craig to play the part of Tuvia.The story opens with the Bielski brothers Tuvia (Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber) returning to the family farm to discover the Germans killed their parents.  They find their younger brother, Asael (Jamie Bell) hiding from the slaughter in a cellar.They decide to go to the forest to hide out. It's initially pure happenstance that they run into other refugees, but as the story progresses, they have a community from philosophers to warriors.It's fascinating to see the community grow and the harsh realities of living under the Nazi radar.  The images in this film will haunt me as strongly as the original newsreel ""Let my People Go"" did when I saw it in junior high.In my opinion, ""Defiance"" is one of the top films of this year and I hope it earns the awards it deserves.  The film is excellent for students of Jewish history, psychology, and community development.

The fact that it was filmed in Lithuania doesn't matter, as only a few kilometers and an artificial barrier in a trackless forest separated similar partisan bands fighting the same enemy.  There is, I see, a tendency to do some backward projecting: that is, these Jewish refugees are acting too much like modern Israelis, rather than Diaspora Jews.  While it's true that some of the toughest Jewish commandos of the Israeli War of Independence cut their teeth in the forest wars of Europe, the film makes too direct a connection.  It's easy to forget that the majority of people in these communities were not ""tough Jews"" and did NOT fight back.  It was not in their history or culture to do so.  Resistance was offered by an exceptional few - like the Bielskis - young men with their bridges burned and nothing left to lose, including memories; while the majority around them clung to tradition to carry them through one more round of trouble.  But the film at least is honest enough to show why this majority, as portrayed by the ghetto elder, refused to ""act"" with doom staring them in the face.Still one of the better examples of the Holocaust genre.",4,Over the Top,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,1253,"['Defiance', 'gritty', 'often', 'ugly', 'facts', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'WWII', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'Lithuania', ""n't"", 'matter', 'only', 'few', 'kilometers', 'artificial', 'barrier', 'trackless', 'forest', 'separated', 'similar', 'partisan', 'bands', 'fighting', 'same', 'enemy', 'see', 'tendency', 'do', 'backward', 'projecting', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'are', 'acting', 'too', 'much', 'modern', 'Israelis', 'rather', 'Diaspora', 'Jews', 'true', 'toughest', 'Jewish', 'commandos', 'Israeli', 'War', 'Independence', 'cut', 'teeth', 'forest', 'wars', 'Europe', 'film', 'too', 'direct', 'connection', 'easy', 'forget', 'majority', 'people', 'communities', 'were', 'not', 'tough', 'Jews', 'did', 'NOT', 'fight', 'back', 'was', 'not', 'history', 'culture', 'do', 'so', 'Resistance', 'was', 'offered', 'exceptional', 'few', 'Bielskis', 'young', 'men', 'bridges', 'burned', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'including', 'memories', 'majority', 'clung', 'tradition', 'carry', 'one', 'more', 'round', 'trouble', 'film', 'least', 'honest', 'enough', 'show', 'why', 'majority', 'portrayed', 'ghetto', 'elder', 'refused', 'act', 'doom', 'staring', 'face.Still', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'Holocaust', 'genre']",N/A

1190444,A1F9AJ13XUI70F,B001FB55J4,Stephen Stults,"[1, 1]","First off, I loved this film.  Great casting, writing, and acting.  Beautifully photographed.So this really IS a minor complaint, but it's one that encompasses a plethora of films with battle scenes.  In truth, the engagements that take place at a distance were well done.  But the ambushes of Germans on lorries are not believable in the sense that they tend to go on forever, with the camera shifting back and forth between the Russians and Germans.  In fact, in the situations depicted, it would have been over in 30 seconds at the most with all Germans quickly killed.  Then there was the Stuka attack.

With Defiance he's chosen a seldom explored true story of Jewish rebels fighting back against their Nazi aggressors in the Belarusian forest; but even with the stage set for heart-wrenching drama and tragic wartime attrition, the film can't quite manage enough emotionally engaging pathos for its band of oddly anti-heroic protagonists.After escaping Nazi-occupied Poland during the onset of World War II, three Jewish brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), and Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) flee to the Belarusian forest where they encounter several other refugees. After numerous casualties from hasty attacks on German soldiers, Tuvia decides that revenge be substituted for survival and begins constructing a village in the forest to shelter his comrades and the growing influx of Jews fleeing Poland. Zus, opposed to Tuvia's more peaceful tactics, opts to join Russian partisans operating nearby, but fate and a common enemy will find their paths crossing once again.Defiance certainly feels like an Edward Zwick film, full of heavy dramatic action, sweeping epic conflicts and historical significance. But like his other political and war driven films (Blood Diamond and The Last Samurai) Defiance falls short of being something truly special due to a lack of investment with the characters. The settings, costumes, cinematography and acting are all first rate, but the development of lead roles and even supporting characters leaves something to be desired, especially when the end of the film abruptly rolls around and great revelations or emotional moments are curiously absent.Defiance is a lesser known chapter from the melting pot of World War II movies and gains points for bringing to our attentions the horrors and triumphs of a band of survivors who achieved the impossible. But like the middle part of a trilogy, the film is paced and concludes anticlimactically like a piece of a much larger plot - one that must struggle to get to the action, and then loses steam as it heads toward the inevitable afterward events summaries. Without tearjerker moments and characters that don't push enough emotional buttons, Defiance is a film that is likely to remain as obscure as its subject matter - a historically powerful chapter that could have been better represented.- The Massie Twins",3,Defiance Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,2392,"['Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'epic', 'war', 'films', 'full', 'tragedy', 'thick', 'accents', 'Defiance', 'chosen', 'seldom', 'explored', 'true', 'story', 'Jewish', 'rebels', 'fighting', 'back', 'Nazi', 'aggressors', 'Belarusian', 'forest', 'even', 'stage', 'set', 'heart-wrenching', 'drama', 'tragic', 'wartime', 'attrition', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'enough', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'pathos', 'band', 'oddly', 'anti-heroic', 'protagonists.After', 'escaping', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Poland', 'onset', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'three', 'Jewish', 'brothers', 'Tuvia', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Zus', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Asael', 'Bielski', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'flee', 'Belarusian', 'forest', 'where', 'encounter', 'several', 'other', 'refugees', 'numerous', 'casualties', 'hasty', 'attacks', 'German', 'soldiers', 'Tuvia', 'revenge', 'be', 'substituted', 'survival', 'constructing', 'village', 'forest', 'shelter', 'comrades', 'growing', 'influx', 'Jews', 'fleeing', 'Poland', 'Zus', 'opposed', 'Tuvia', 'more', 'peaceful', 'tactics', 'opts', 'join', 'Russian', 'partisans', 'operating', 'nearby', 'fate', 'common', 'enemy', 'will', 'find', 'paths', 'crossing', 'once', 'again.Defiance', 'certainly', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'film', 'full', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'action', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'conflicts', 'historical', 'significance', 'other', 'political', 'war', 'driven', 'films', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Defiance', 'short', 'being', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'due', 'lack', 'investment', 'characters', 'settings', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'development', 'lead', 'roles', 'even', 'supporting', 'characters', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', 'when', 'end', 'film', 'abruptly', 'great', 'revelations', 'emotional', 'moments', 'are', 'curiously', 'absent.Defiance', 'lesser', 'known', 'chapter', 'melting', 'pot', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'gains', 'points', 'bringing', 'attentions', 'horrors', 'triumphs', 'band', 'survivors', 'who', 'achieved', 'impossible', 'middle', 'part', 'trilogy', 'film', 'paced', 'anticlimactically', 'piece', 'much', 'larger', 'plot', 'one', 'must', 'struggle', 'get', 'action', 'then', 'steam', 'inevitable', 'afterward', 'events', 'summaries', 'tearjerker', 'moments', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'enough', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'Defiance', 'film', 'likely', 'remain', 'as', 'obscure', 'subject', 'matter', 'historically', 'powerful', 'chapter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'represented.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

The primary target were the Jewish communities.In the Belarus S.S.R., the Bielski brothers took to the woods, rather than be shipped off to imminent death in a concentration-camp. Many others followed them, usually with nothing more than the clothes they wore.One of the brothers joined a unit of Russian partizans, after a family altercation. The other led the small community of survivors who established a hidden encampment deep in the forest. The refugees in this camp frequently starved and froze. They had very little in medical assets, and there was no shortage of illness. The most savage combat in the European theater surged all around them. Their fellow Soviet Citizens had little sympathy or blatant hostility toward them.

1190465,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001FB55J4,Turfseer,"[104, 123]","**This review contains spoilers**By necessity, one must focus on the survivors if one wishes to create a workable film about the Holocaust. For its only through the eyes and ears of the survivors (and their tales of suffering) that we can appreciate the enormity, the scope of what occurred to the victims of the Holocaust. Paradoxically, the tales of the survivors are nothing more than anomalies--which may give the wrong impression to the uninformed that the Holocaust was an ennobling event--that these tales of survival were somehow the rule rather than the exception.Defiance is one such anomalous tale. Some critics have likened it to a critique of Jewish passivity--that the overwhelming majority of Jews went to their deaths without putting up a fight. And certainly that reputation is reinforced in 'Defiance' as the protagonists, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, stand out as Jewish outsiders who aren't afraid to fight the Nazis as opposed to the majority of the Jewish 'intellectuals', mostly freshly minted refugees from the ghetto, who end up as part of the Bielski 'community' within the Byelorussian forest.But there is an excellent scene in Defiance, where Tuvia sneaks into the ghetto and confronts the head of the Jewish committee there, that demonstrates that the average Jew was not passive--simply bewildered and overwhelmed. Can you really blame the head of the Jewish committee when he doesn't believe Tuvia's tales of genocide? He says, 'yes, we've heard these stories, but who can really believe them?' Reports of atrocities reached the United States during the War but they were not really appreciated until the actual newsreel photos of truckloads of emaciated bodies were seen being bulldozed into ditches at Bergen-Belsen after the war was over.The opening scenes of 'Defiance' are testament to the brutally swift nature of the Nazi genocide. In most cases, there was simply no time to think about resisting (or escaping). The Nazis came in, along with the help of the local authorities in the occupied territories and murdered the Jews in the blink of an eye. We see this very effectively illustrated in 'Defiance' after the Bielskis find their parents murdered on the family farm.One of the picture's strengths is that it also illustrates the role of the local collaborators who assisted the Nazis. In a dazzlingly effective scene, Tuvia takes revenge by shooting the local police chief and his sons after they've murdered his parents. The collaborators aren't seen as monsters--quite the contrary, in a humanized portrait, the police chief begs for his life and insists he was forced to act at the bidding of his superiors in the Nazi occupation force (in an earlier scene, the police chief comes to a farm looking for one of the Bielski brothers who hides in a barn after attacking a group of Nazis--here the police chief is much more crass and arrogant--but still all too human!).Nonetheless, Zwick, the film's director, should have had another scene involving the collaborators to balance out the 'sympathetic' portrait. The truth of the matter was that there were other of these local collaborators who were outright sadists, capable of incomprehensible, monstrous acts of brutality. Similarly, Zwick shows us a group of Jews in the forest who end up savagely beating a captured German soldier to death (despite his cries that he has a wife and children). While such acts of revenge did occur, it's hard to appreciate the context for their actions (it would have been better if Zwick had actually shown the Bielski parents, for example, being murdered and not merely the aftermath).A good deal of 'Defiance' explores the conflict between the two brothers. Tuvia is the pragmatic one who comes to accept his role as a new 'Moses', leading his beleaguered group of 'intellectuals' to safety through the forest. At first he has only contempt for his fellow Jews who he regards as cowardly and passive. But as time passes, they earn his respect as they all become more proactive. Zus, on the other hand, wants to take direct action against the Nazis and joins the Soviet partisans as one of their fighters. I thought that the characterization of the Russians was one of the strongest parts of the movies. They are depicted sympathetically--shown both for their courage and brutality (Zus eventually leaves the partisans after he can no longer tolerate their anti-semitic stance).A good part of 'Defiance' is taken up showing life in the forest camp. The characterizations are a mixed bag. Some of the characters are standard 'types' (the debate between the 'intellectual' vs. the 'spiritual' Jew is one such example). There are some good scenes depicting the malnourishment that the community had to endure along with a few obligatory romances. One scene I had a hard time believing was when Tuvia kills one of the food hunters who insists that his group gets extra portions of rations. Did that really happen? I'm not sure but it made for good drama.I like Daniel Craig in this role a lot more than as James Bond; he gives a solid performance as an unlikely savior for his people. And Lev Schreiber is excellent as the tough as nails partisan who eventually reunites with his brother after a fractured relationship.Defiance's final scene focuses on the community battling and defeating a large group of Nazi soldiers backed up by a tank. I'm told that this is what actually happened but the way the whole thing is staged seemed a little hard to believe. Nonetheless, Defiance is a film that will keep you absorbed from the opening credits. As a little known history lesson, it does its job. And certainly it was a worthy project to commemorate the deeds of the heroic Bielski brothers.",4,Standard but worthy Holocaust drama,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5710,"['**This', 'review',

Even Tuvia himself, who was later living out the rest of his life as an American citizen until his death in 1987, barely acknowledged his own heroics in doing so. The movie shows plenty into their lives spent in that forest, their suffering from little food, the little acknowledgement of their deeds by nearby Russian partisan units that also attacked the Germans, and the constant terror that each citizen had knowing that they could be driven out by the German military and Nazi-allied police.After watching this movie, I sought more information by ordering one of the books on the Bielski brothers and reading each page carefully while on a vacation. I had to take off a star for this review because when you watch the movie, it shows the massive German advance of an entire army division to drive the Jews out from their forest settlements sometime in the spring of 1942, where the entire population crosses through a murky swamp and then a face-off against German infantry with tank support. Much of this DID happen, but the attempt by the Nazis to drive them out with such military support was not attempted until the early summer of 1943, which was a full year off the mark when you compare the movie scenes with the book. Plus, it took several months following the German invasion, with the three brothers hiding out in different towns and homes of friends, before they got the idea to rescue people from the ghetto prisons and make such settlements in the forests, when the movie makes out these same ideas to be planned shortly after the invasion. The lack of historical accuracy on those two parts alone gives it a four-star rating, otherwise, it's an excellent movie!Sadly, what I found out from the book is that despite Tuvia's experience as a former corporal in the peacetime Polish Army and his loyalty to the Communist Party(or do I dare say tolerance), and his brothers serving in the Red Army before their units were dispersed sometime after the invasion, the Soviet police following their occupation of the Belarus region in July, 1944, treated Tuvia and his family with some contempt and much suspicion, leading Tuvia and his surviving family members to believe that they would soon be arrested, which led to them leaving the country for good after the war to settle in Israel and then the United States. With the number of descendants from the Jews that the brothers helped to rescue numbering in the tens of thousands by this day alone, a lot more recognition should be gained on what these three brothers did in their part to save so many.One who saves one life...end up saving an entire nation. And these three ended up saving 1,200 Jews, not to mention ambushing and killing some 500 German soldiers and their allies.

1190474,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001FB55J4,Wuchak,"[3, 10]","""Defiance"" is a 2008-2009 drama/war film starring Daniel Craig, the latest James Bond.This is a true story: As Nazi forces sweep through Eastern Europe in 1941 the Bielski brothers seek refuge in the deep forests. More and more Polish Jews join their ranks for common protection and to oppose the occupying Germans. How can they all survive in the woods during the next four years of war?""Defiance"" has a lot going for it: a story based on actual events, good actors, locations (filmed in Lithuania, a mere 100 miles or so from the actual sites), cinematography and score. Unfortunately it never rises above decent. I personally love survival-type films and ""Defiance"" pretty much kept my attention but I never became fully captivated with the people and their story. It failed to move me or stir me like it could have or should have.Compare ""Defiance"" to another drama/war film like ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992): Both films are drama/war stories that largely take place in the woods. In ""Last of the Mohicans"" you came to know and care for all the major characters, and if you didn't care for them you at least understood them and their motivations (e.g. Magua); in addition to this the film is profoundly moving (remember when Alice jumps off the cliff?) and the romance palpable. In ""Defiance,"" by contrast, the only characters that come alive at all are Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski and his rivalrous brother Zus. The other people and their experiences never truly register.Even ""Hornet's Nest,"" a small 1970 film with the same general theme, was more moving than ""Defiance."" If you don't believe me, check it out (although it's only available on vhs).I don't want you to get the impression that I loathed ""Defiance."" I didn't. Again, it pretty much kept my attention and I almost shed a tear at the end, but something(s) holds it back from being truly good and moving. Reviewer C. Christopher Blackshere hints at what holds it back: The filmmakers throw in all kinds of things to try to apprehend and maintain the viewer's attention -- numerous gun battles, an airstrike and a tank -- all faithful Hollywoodisms. A little bit of this is fine, but what they really needed to do was simply focus on the characters and their gritty survival story. How about a deeper examination of man reduced to basic necessities? What about a study of man stripped of all civilized influences, struggling with the animalistic side of his/her psyche, as depicted in the excellent ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (which hasn't made it to dvd yet either)? How about the immaterial yet palpable bond of love which unites and gives life even in the worst possible conditions? There's a little of this but it doesn't go deep enough.Regardless, there is one scene that I found thought-provoking, which Roger Ebert pointed out: A man seeks to join the ever-growing group in the woods and is asked what he does so they can determine how best to utilize his skills. He ponders it a moment and replies that he's ""an intellectual."" Of course there's little use for an intellectual in such a forest community, although they don't reject him. Back in those days, that region was largely agrarian and peasant; folks were skilled in at least one practical area as farmers, craftmen or laborers. But of what use is an ""intellectual""? How many of us are intellectuals and would be largely useless in such a senario? It goes without saying that the picture works on a what-if level. How long will our present society endure as it is before we are all forced to live primitively in the woods as depicted in the film? If and when that happens I hope you're more than just ""an intellectual.""BOTTOM LINE: ""Defiance"" is worthwhile if the survival-in-the-woods plot piques your interest but, be forewarned, it fails to truly captivate and is only marginally better than the similarly-themed ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003).PERSONAL GRADE: C+",3,Survival in the woods during WWII,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,3892,"['Defiance', '2008-2009', 'drama/war', 'film', 'starring', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'latest', 'James', 'Bond.This', 'true', 'story', 'Nazi', 'forces', 'sweep', 'Eastern', 'Europe', '1941', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'seek', 'refuge', 'deep', 'forests', 'More', 'more', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'join', 'ranks', 'common', 'protection', 'oppose', 'occupying', 'Germans', 'How', 'can', 'survive', 'woods', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'war', 'Defiance', 'lot', 'going', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'good', 'actors', 'locations', 'filmed', 'Lithuania', 'mere', '100', 'miles', 'so', 'actual', 'sites', 'cinematography', 'score', 'never', 'decent', 'personally', 'love', 'survival-type', 'films', 'Defiance', 'pretty', 'much', 'attention', 'never', 'became', 'fully', 'captivated', 'people', 'story', 'failed', 'move', 'stir', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have.Compare', 'Defiance', 'drama/war', 'film', 'Last', 'Mohicans', '1992', 'films', 'are', 'drama/war', 'stories', 'largely', 'take', 'place', 'woods', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'came', 'know', 'care', 'major', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'least', 'understood', 'motivations', 'e.g', 'Magua', 'addition', 'film', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'remember', 'when', 'Alice', 'cliff', 'romance', 'palpable', 'Defiance', 'contrast', 'only', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'are', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Tuvia', 'Bielski', 'rivalrous', 'brother', 'Zus', 'other', 'people', 'experiences', 'never', 'truly', 'register.Even', 'Hornet', 'Nest', 'small', '1970', 'film', 'same', 'general', 'theme', 'was', 'more', 'moving', 'Defiance', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'check', 'out', 'only', 'available', 'vhs', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'impression', 'loathed', 'Defiance', 'did', ""n't"", 'Again', 'pretty', 'much', 'attention', 'almost', 'shed', 'tear', 'end', 'something', 's', 'back', 'being', 'truly', 'good', 'moving', 'Reviewer', 'C.', 'Christopher', 'Blackshere', 'hints', 'what', 'back', 'filmmakers', 'throw', 'kinds', 'things', 'try', 'apprehend', 'maintain', 'viewer', 'attention', 'numerous', 'gun', 'battles', 'airstrike', 'tank', 'faithful', 'Hollywoodisms', 'little', 'bit', 'fine', 'what', 'really', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'simply', 'focus', 'characters', 'gritty', 'survival', 'story', 'How', 'deeper', 'examination', 'man', 'reduced', 'basic', 'necessities', 'What', 'study', 'man', 'stripped', 'civilized', 'influences', 'struggling', 'animalistic', 'side', 'his/her', 'psyche', 'depicted', 'excellent', 'Sands', 'Kalahari', ""n't"", 'made', 'dvd', 'yet', 'How', 'immaterial', 'palpable', 'bond', 'love', 'life', 'even', 'worst', 'possible', 'conditions', 'little', ""n't"", 'go', 'deep', 'enough.Regardless', 'one', 'scene', 'found', 'thought-provoking', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'out', 'man', 'join', 'ever-growing', 'group', 'woods', 'asked', 'what', 'can', 'determine', 'how', 'best', 'utilize', 'skills', 'moment', 'replies', 'intellectual', 'course', 'little', 'use', 'intellectual', 'such', 'forest', 'community', 'do', ""n't"", 'reject', 'Back', 'days', 'region', 'was', 'largely', 'agrarian', 'peasant', 'folks', 'were', 'skilled', 'least', 'one', 'practical', 'area', 'farmers', 'craftmen', 'laborers', 'what', 'use', 'intellectual', 'How', 'many', 'are', 'intellectuals', 'would', 'be', 'largely', 'useless', 'such', 'senario', 'saying', 'picture', 'what-if', 'level', 'How', 'long', 'will', 'present', 'society', 'endure', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'primitively', 'woods', 'depicted', 'film', 'when', 'hope', ""'re"", 'more', 'just', 'intellectual', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Defiance', 'worthwhile', 'survival-in-the-woods', 'plot', 'piques', 'interest', 'be', 'forewarned', 'truly', 'captivate', 'only', 'marginally', 'better', 'similarly-themed', 'Tears', 'Sun', '2003', '.PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

This film takes a completely different approach to the WW2 era, showing it from the point of view of a group of Jewish citizens trying to avoid capture and survive out in the woods.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the two eldest Bielski brothers (Tuvia & Zus), who lead a band of fleeing Jews into the woods when the Germans begin to invade Eastern Europe.  While out in the Belarussian forest, the Bielski boys must not only feed hungry mouths and keep away from the Germans, but also navigate through different political/military strategies and the shady Russian army (in which you never know who to trust).This movie may not be an all-time classic, but it is a very solid WW2 tale told from a perspective I'm not accustomed to (and thus rather fresh).  Being based on a true story, it is remarkable to consider the odds that the vagrant Jews faced just to survive each day, nonetheless maintain their freedom.The two acting leads (Daniel Craig & Liev Schreiber) are very compelling, while none of the auxiliary cast are exceptionally bad.  Though it is a bit slow in the beginning, by the end the plot/characters will really have you rooting for success.Thus, I recommend this film to WW2 enthusiasts of all kind.

1190476,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001FB55J4,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Even as a compulsive reader about all things to do with the Holocaust, I had never really paid too much attention to the story of the Bielski brothers, focusing instead on the more famous instance of Jewish resistance against the Nazis, i.e. the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising [of which there was a made-for-TV feature titled ""Uprising"" starring Hank Azaria, David Schwimmer and Lee Lee Sobieski - a credibly portrayed feature actually]. Anyway, when I read that a movie was to be made about the Bielski brothers, my interest was piqued.Based on the book ""Defiance: The Bielski Partisans"" by Nechama Tec, the movie recounts the story of three Jewish brothers, i.e. Tuvia [Daniel Craig], Zus [Liev Schreiber], and teenager Asael [Jamie Bell] who seek shelter in the deep forests of Belorussia in 1941 when the Germans invade. Starting out as a small band of refugees, the group eventually grows, with Tuvia assuming leadership, much to the resentment of hot-headed brother Zus who feels they should not be accommodating more Jews at a time when their own resources are strained. The love-hate relationship between the two brothers [with kid brother Asael trying hard to mediate] is a focal point of the story, as much as the story of how hundreds of Jews eventually make their home in the forest, organizing themselves into a community with a group of fighters, food gatherers and the common folk.With the restricted time frame, the story tends to get choppy at times, with a lot of side story arcs that never get fully explored, but the action is kept going at a steady pace - Jews fleeing the Nazis, the Bielski brothers raiding a German holding to get medicine, the Red Army fighting alongside some Bielski partisans against the Germans, even a marriage!I felt the writing could have been better and wished they'd touched more on the social hierarchy within the forest camp and the apparent stratification between the various groups. But, the credible acting by the leads, especially Daniel Craig's Tuvia [the calmer, more rational brother] and Liev Schreiber's Zus [the impulsive and angry revolutionary] more than made up for the other deficiencies in the plot. With a story as complicated as the Bielski brothers [reading historical accounts about them, one learns that there were many underlying tensions in the forest camp], its understandably difficult to tell the full story within the time constraints.On the whole though, I did enjoy the movie - it is rather unique in that it tells the story of one of the rare instances where the Jews actually fought back against the Nazis, and by some great miracle managed to survive by the hundreds. The other great instance of such resistance was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis which didn't end as successfully as the Bielski story, but in a sense was truly inspiring for the courage of those Jewish fighters who died as martyrs [I'd recommend watching ""Uprising"" as a credible feature film portraying the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]. I'd recommend this movie to all those who are interested in the Holocaust, WW II, and especially about Jewish resistance during WW II [ and ""The Bielski Brothers"" a History Channel documentary would be a good complement to this, to fill in the gaps].",4,Well-acted story about the Bielski brothers,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,3238,"['Even', 'compulsive', 'reader', 'things', 'do', 'Holocaust', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'paid', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'story', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'focusing', 'instead', 'more', 'famous', 'instance', 'Jewish', 'resistance', 'Nazis', 'i.e', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', '[', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'feature', 'titled', 'Uprising', 'starring', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sobieski', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'feature', 'actually', ']', 'Anyway', 'when', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'made', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'interest', 'was', 'piqued.Based', 'book', 'Defiance', 'Bielski', 'Partisans', 'Nechama', 'Tec', 'movie', 'story', 'three', 'Jewish', 'brothers', 'i.e', 'Tuvia', '[', 'Daniel', 'Craig', ']', 'Zus', '[', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', ']', 'teenager', 'Asael', '[', 'Jamie', 'Bell', ']', 'who', 'seek', 'shelter', 'deep', 'forests', 'Belorussia', '1941', 'when', 'Germans', 'invade', 'Starting', 'out', 'small', 'band', 'refugees', 'group', 'eventually', 'Tuvia', 'assuming', 'leadership', 'much', 'resentment', 'hot-headed', 'brother', 'Zus', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'accommodating', 'more', 'Jews', 'time', 'when', 'own', 'resources', 'are', 'strained', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', '[', 'kid', 'brother', 'Asael', 'trying', 'hard', 'mediate', ']', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'how', 'hundreds', 'Jews', 'eventually', 'make', 'home', 'forest', 'organizing', 'community', 'group', 'fighters', 'food', 'gatherers', 'common', 'folk.With', 'restricted', 'time', 'frame', 'story', 'get', 'choppy', 'times', 'lot', 'side', 'story', 'arcs', 'never', 'get', 'fully', 'explored', 'action', 'kept', 'going', 'steady', 'pace', 'Jews', 'fleeing', 'Nazis', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'raiding', 'German', 'holding', 'get', 'medicine', 'Red', 'Army', 'fighting', 'alongside', 'Bielski', 'partisans', 'Germans', 'even', 'marriage', 'felt', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'wished', ""'d"", 'touched', 'more', 'social', 'hierarchy', 'forest', 'camp', 'apparent', 'stratification', 'various', 'groups', 'credible', 'acting', 'leads', 'especially', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Tuvia', '[', 'calmer', 'more', 'rational', 'brother', ']', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Zus', 'impulsive', 'angry', 'revolutionary', ']', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'other', 'deficiencies', 'plot', 'story', 'as', 'complicated', 'Bielski', 'brothers', '[', 'reading', 'historical', 'accounts', 'were', 'many', 'underlying', 'tensions', 'forest', 'camp', ']', 'understandably', 'difficult', 'tell', 'full', 'story', 'time', 'whole', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'rather', 'unique', 'story', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'Jews', 'actually', 'fought', 'back', 'Nazis', 'great', 'miracle', 'managed', 'survive', 'hundreds', 'other', 'great', 'instance', 'such', 'resistance', 'was', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', 'Nazis', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'as', 'successfully', 'Bielski', 'story', 'sense', 'was', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'courage', 'Jewish', 'fighters', 'who', 'died', 'martyrs', '[', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'Uprising', 'credible', 'feature', 'film', 'portraying', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'Uprising', ']', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Holocaust', 'WW', 'II', 'especially', 'Jewish', 'resistance', 'WW', 'II', '[', 'Bielski', 'Brothers', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'complement', 'fill', 'gaps', ']']",N/A
