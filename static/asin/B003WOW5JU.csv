This movie is a must for my collection, its better unrated (more laughs) which is a option on the DVD I bought. In addition to being very funny, this movie is riddled with cameo voices from so many talented celebrities. You should buy it, Cartoon Network does not play it enough. Once a year maybe on Spring Break, is all I've seen and I can't wait that long so I had to buy it.",5,Freaknik: The Musical,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,525,"['movie', 'great', 'hilarious', 'Sweet', 'Tea', 'Mobsters', 'are', 'quest', 'win', 'rap', 'contest', 'get', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'money', 'clothes', 'hos', 'movie', 'must', 'collection', 'better', 'unrated', 'more', 'laughs', 'option', 'DVD', 'bought', 'addition', 'being', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'riddled', 'cameo', 'voices', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'celebrities', 'should', 'buy', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'not', 'play', 'enough', 'Once', 'year', 'maybe', 'Spring', 'Break', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'long', 'so', 'had', 'buy']",N/A

The music had me thinking about buying a few of the songs to add to my playlist; and I don't usually like rap.  There are too many quotable lines.  For anyone to be offended will just mean that they are already unfamiliar with rap culture humor or they are simply looking to be offended.  Sure, the ""N word"" is frequent... but no worse than in Blazing Saddles and always in context. As this played on Adult Swim, one should expect adult references and over the top, lowbrow humor.  Being a native New Orleanian, I loved the segment set there.  Lastly, the collected shorts / movie has excellent replay value.",5,I thought the sun never shined in the ghetto,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,673,"['animation', 'style', 'unique', 'definitely', 'humor', 'music', 'had', 'thinking', 'buying', 'few', 'songs', 'add', 'playlist', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'like', 'rap', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'quotable', 'lines', 'anyone', 'be', 'offended', 'will', 'just', 'mean', 'are', 'already', 'unfamiliar', 'rap', 'culture', 'humor', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'be', 'offended', 'Sure', 'N', 'word', 'frequent', 'worse', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'always', 'context', 'played', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'adult', 'references', 'top', 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'Being', 'native', 'New', 'Orleanian', 'loved', 'segment', 'set', 'there', 'Lastly', 'collected', 'shorts', '/', 'movie', 'excellent', 'replay', 'value']",N/A

The only flicker of intelligent humor, here, was the Jesus parody - even counting that as mildly offensive.  Aside from those few minutes, Freaknik was a stupid, stoner pandering, blacksploitation pile-o-poo!  I even watched it twice, a couple weeks apart, in order to temper my initial assessment; but, I found it just as inanely repulsive the second time around.  I simply cannot imagine how anyone with clear eyes could like this trash.",1,R U Serious?!!,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,581,"['was', 'suggestion', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Boondocks', 'Other', 'having', 'take', 'African-American', 'culture', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'only', 'flicker', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'here', 'was', 'Jesus', 'parody', 'even', 'counting', 'mildly', 'offensive', 'Aside', 'few', 'minutes', 'Freaknik', 'was', 'stupid', 'stoner', 'pandering', 'blacksploitation', 'pile-o-poo', 'even', 'watched', 'twice', 'couple', 'weeks', 'apart', 'order', 'temper', 'initial', 'assessment', 'found', 'just', 'inanely', 'repulsive', 'second', 'time', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'anyone', 'clear', 'eyes', 'could', 'like', 'trash']",N/A

If you are interested, just buy the soundtrack because that is the only good thing about this. Only reason this is popular is because various famous rappers and comedians are in it, such as T-Pain, Lil Wayne, and Bill Hader. Also the rating is wrong, this movie is far from being rated G. It is rated TV-MA. I saw it on Adult Swim and it is not for kids. It uses to much profanity and too much ""booty"".",2,Unexplainable,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,541,"['impossible', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'beginning', 'music', 'great', 'rest', 'movie', 'disappointment', 'are', 'interested', 'just', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'Only', 'reason', 'popular', 'various', 'famous', 'rappers', 'comedians', 'are', 'such', 'T-Pain', 'Lil', 'Wayne', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Also', 'rating', 'wrong', 'movie', 'far', 'being', 'rated', 'G.', 'rated', 'TV-MA', 'saw', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'not', 'kids', 'much', 'profanity', 'too', 'much', 'booty']",N/A
1369651,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B003WOW5JU,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[0, 0]","I've seen this twice on Adult Swim, and while there are some parts that are genuinely funny, there's also plenty to not like. Some black people don't like this film, and for good reason - there's hella lot of stereotypes and blacks depicted in negative ways. The four main characters want to win the rap contest so they can have money, clothes, and ho's. Before they set forth, one of the characters insists he cannot achieve this goal without weed.There's also a HUGE amount of booty - depicted as a literal sea of butts in a few scenes. Women are depicted negatively, even in Freaknik's 'positive' way. The Ghetto Commandments are also very negative - there's one about not loving your woman ('ho' as the commandment refers to them)I get that this film is a parody on some of these stereotypes (a bucket of fried chicken has the label 'stereotypical' on it) but this film could have been entertaining with much of the heavy-handed stereotyping taken out. At the end, a woman approaches Freaknik with a bundle that is shown to be his baby - the baby even has sunglasses and all - and Freaknik just high0tails it out of there. There's already a big problem in America with parents (men and women alike) not taking responsibility for their babies, so that was NOT a subject that needed to be made fun of.Some people are going to like this - I did enjoy some parts - but others are going to hate it.",3,Mixed bag,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1397,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'also', 'plenty', 'not', 'like', 'black', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'hella', 'lot', 'stereotypes', 'blacks', 'depicted', 'negative', 'ways', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'want', 'win', 'rap', 'contest', 'can', 'have', 'money', 'clothes', 'ho', 'set', 'forth', 'one', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'achieve', 'goal', 'weed.There', 'also', 'HUGE', 'amount', 'booty', 'depicted', 'literal', 'sea', 'butts', 'few', 'scenes', 'Women', 'are', 'depicted', 'negatively', 'even', 'Freaknik', ""'positive"", 'way', 'Ghetto', 'Commandments', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'negative', 'one', 'not', 'loving', 'woman', 'commandment', 'refers', 'get', 'film', 'parody', 'stereotypes', 'bucket', 'fried', 'chicken', 'label', ""'stereotypical"", 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'much', 'heavy-handed', 'stereotyping', 'taken', 'out', 'end', 'woman', 'Freaknik', 'bundle', 'shown', 'be', 'baby', 'baby', 'even', 'sunglasses', 'Freaknik', 'just', 'high0tails', 'there', 'already', 'big', 'problem', 'America', 'parents', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'not', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'babies', 'was', 'NOT', 'subject', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'fun', 'of.Some', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'did', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'others', 'are', 'going', 'hate']",N/A
