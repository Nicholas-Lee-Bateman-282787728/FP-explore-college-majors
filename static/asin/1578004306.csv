This movie is really more of a teaser to the television series.  Something more to wet your appetite than anything else.  The characters are already developed and their special skills already learned.  On the other hand the comedy is out there.  They make so much fun of themselves it's ridiculous.

For the Maze series, the OAV's came before the TV series and thus with the OAV, you see situations that are more for adults and the TV series, things are toned down for the children who come home in the afternoons in Japan.With that out of the way, the series was interesting and it did keep my interest.  It's not a superb anime but it was entertaining.  The anime though is not as sharp as other OAV's that came out during the mid or late 90's.  It seemed like TV quality OAV's.As for the DVD, special features include the first episode of the series (is this a special feature?) and a &quot;meet the cast&quot; which is nothing and the trailers which are from Hasegawa Katsumi's (screenwriter) other works.Perhaps if I had a DVD-Rom, I would say more positive things but at this time, if you can rent it...rent it.

This one looks like it targets an audience of about the 3rd to 5th grade level in Japan.

Not to say that I didnt find some ts amusing on this tape, like when a dragon asks the group hilarious question like when the next video release is, but there was one scene that was trying to be funny, but isnt. It was when male Maze rapes the king's daughter toned to funny music. What is so funny about rape? I know that it is trying to follow along the lines of Ranma 1\2, but that show never did anything this extreme. It's too bad. Maze seemed like it would be pretty good, and it is, but that one scene ruined the whole show for me.

192465,A1CJQPZGJB2DSJ,1578004306,"""solarnight""","[1, 2]","First off, the anime isn't &quot;suitable for ages 18 and up&quot;, it's ages 13 and up, as the DVD cover says.The Maze DVD features both OAV episodes, the first episode of the TV series, and Japanese and English audio tracks for the OAVs and TV series. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. As for story, you have your basic band of characters traveling from point A to point B to stop a power-crazed guy from impoverishing a country by constructing a tower in his name. Now, for the not-so-basic features. First off, the main character, Maze, turns into a man at night. And not just any man, an insanely sex-crazed man. Another character, Solude, is a woman attracted to Maze- the female Maze. Then there's Mill who's attracted to both male AND female Maze, and the fairy who hides inside Maze's shirt. You can probably guess that this anime has a lot of nudity. More than a lot, in fact.Along with that, there is also a lot of comedy. The group at one point encounters a large dragon, to which they draw their weapons and assume battle positions- then realize they're not facing the right direction. After the dragon yells at them and they turn around, he introduces himself as Robulos. The group then repeats his name wrong. After Robulos yells the pronunciation of his name syllable by syllable, he challenges the group to a battle- a 100-question game show battle. And that's only one of the three dragons that the group has to fight, in equally bizarre situations. Interesting enough? There are some flaws though, like the terribly disappointing final battle, the lack of an opening theme, and the below average dubbing. Fortunately this is a dual-language DVD.

I love most of Japanese culture...but DVDs like the MAZE OAV make me glad that I'm as far away from there as possible, assuming the creators live there as opposed to living with Jimmy Hoffa and the aliens on the planet Zarkon.  I had seen (and reviewed) the original Maze TV series, but one good thing about TV; you have to have standards.  ..., Maze tries to mix a D&D type fantasy with a sexual comedy.  Let me expound upon that by saying that the results are at best tragic, and at worst horrific.  I don't care about things like ""cultural differences"", scenes like where man Maze decides to pointlessly rape this princess named Mix, only to turn out that, yes, she enjoyed it, should not even exist, yet alone being presented for my viewing enjoyment.  Pretty much, this is the version of ""Maze"" that takes the gloves off of the series, showing what I'm sure the ... creator originally had in mind, but couldn't show, even on Japanese TV.  Delightfully flat characters and pointless scenes ahoy!  Would recommend as an alternative to ""cruel and unusual punishment"", or for use as a frisbee for a REALLY small dog.
