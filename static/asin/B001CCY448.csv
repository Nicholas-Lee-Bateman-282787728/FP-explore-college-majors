1175658,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B001CCY448,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]","This is an awesome dvd. One of the great things TNA has done in it's long great run is create a great women's wrestling division. In between the matches we get brief interviews from Knockouts like Gail Kim, Karen Angle, Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, Jackie,ODB, Roxxi and others. The format is you get two interviews from two Knockouts then they go to play a full match. All the matches on this dvd set are awesome. The three matches between Gail Kim and Awesome Kong are worth it alone. They had a great rivalry and put on the best matches in the history of the Knockout's division. The Gaunlet match from Bound For Glory was on here and it was awesome. Gail Kim is crowned the champ. We get to see a tag matche with fan favorites Roxxi and ODB vs Angelina Love and Velvet Sky. I always thought Roxxi was a underrated wrestler and ODB was great. Angelina and Velvet were great always too. There is also an awesome match between Awesome Kong and Taylor Wilde. That was a classic and Wilde is a little overlooked as she was a great champion. Overall it was a great dvd. The little interviews were perfect in length and the matches were great. This is one of TNA's Best DVD's. I recommend this to all wrestling fans. It's worth owning and a must own for any true TNA fan.

1175662,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B001CCY448,D.P.,"[5, 5]","During a period where womens wrestling on a national level in the United States was more about barbie-like models being hired as ""divas"" because of how good they looked good in bikinis & Playboy photos more than the inring action, TNA stepped up & decided to go the other direction that resembled the a womens division of old where it was more about how you good of a WRESTLER you are and that division is showcased here.Throughout the presentation, you get to hear from all the current females on the roster (except Awesome Kong...the other Knockouts speak of her) completely out of character (except Raisha Saeed) talking about how they got into the business (which some providing footage from their early career on the independent scene), how they compare to the men, earning respect, what inspired them, hobbies, the future for themselves & the division, favorite/memorable moments, and what makes them better than the ""divas.""  You'll hear some interesting facts throughout these profiles such as how Karen Angle was a wrestling fan before she ever met Kurt, how this isn't the first time Angelina Love wrestled for TNA, the list of injuries the Knockouts have gotten from Awesome Kong, which former World Champion Traci had her first crush on, how people get the wrong perception of how Jacqueline really is.  You'll also hear some quick comments from TNA President Dixie Carter, Christian Cage, Kurt Angle, and Jeff Jarrett along with getting a collection of TNA Knockout photos to finish out the program.  Along with the original program came a bonus disc that was put together at the last min. featuring an audio interview with Gail Kim talking about why she decided to leave TNA, what she'll miss, and highlights of her career.Matches Include:Gauntlet Match to crown the first TNA Knockouts Champion:  Gail Kim vs. O.D.B vs. Shelly Martinez (Salinas) vs. Traci Brooks vs. Angel Williams (Angelina Love) vs. Amazing Kong (Awesome Kong) vs. Jacqueline vs. Talia Madison (Velvet Sky) vs. Christy Hemme vs. Roxxi LaVeaux - This was an average match up as these guantlet's are usually crowed so not everyone has a chance to standout & make an impression. Some moments to look out for were Amazing Kong's domination including destroying Christy Hemme & the final moments between Gail Kim & Roxxi. Good match for what it was & for the record, Kong's ""wardrobe malfunction"" was edited out.(Bound For Glory '07)TNA Womens Champion Gail Kim vs. O.D.B. vs. Roxxi Laveaux vs. Angel Williams (Angelina Love) - Another solid matchup as you can tell these women worked hard & well together...if you can get past the one part in the beginning when Roxxi looked like she was trying to put a trance on the referee. The real standout was O.D.B. as she really had was connecting with the crowd.(Genesis '07)Angelina Love & Velvet Sky vs. O.D.B. & Roxxi Laveaux - Boy, O.D.B. was just over with the crowd from the start. Despite some of the ""WWE divas"" elements like the spanking between the knockouts & trying to get the referee involved, this was decent but nothing really memorable about it.(Turning Point '07)Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - This was the beginning of the series that brought all the attention to the Knockouts divison as the story here was David vs. Goliath...except both of them are women as this was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches. Kong for the most part dominated Gail Kim who was able to get in a few shots here & there with working on Kong's arm in the beginning & then taking to the air later in the match starting to gain some momentum before Kong recovered & just beat Kim down & refused to stop causing the DQ. The aftermath with Kong beating up the babyface knockouts, the referee, and powerbombing Gail on the chair heavily sold the fact that Kong is a monster. The result was to set up a rematch which a majority of people didn't mind.(Turning Point '07)No Disqualification Match: Womens Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - They topped their match from the previous month as again, they used the ""David vs. Goliath"" formula but delivered a different match. Again, Kong dominated here & just kept overpowering Kim while Gail just kept fighting back. Chairs were used, they brawled on the floor & through the crowd, & even the referee wasn't safe as he got a powerbomb by Kong. Great match with a creative ending that was worth of the ""TNA"" chants from the crowd.(Final Resolution '08)Womens Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - This marked the debut of Kong's manager, Raisha Saeed, and was another wild brawl that went all over the Impact Zone between both women that saw Kong crash through a wall at one point.  They stuck with the ""David vs. Goliath"" formula here that was successful before and resulted in Kong becoming the Knockouts Champion after giving a series of three Awesome Bombs to Gail.(""Impact"" Jan '08)The Jay Lethal/So Cal Val Wedding - Holy SummerSlam '91 Batman! Seriously, this entire storyline has been done very similar to the Randy/Liz storyline from the proposal, ""Oh Yeah!"" acceptance by Val, and even Lethal dressing in the same type of outfit Savage did at the SummerSlam wedding. However, anyone who watched TNA over the past couple of months (including those who edit the video packages together) knew what was coming when the best man Sonjay Dutt stopped the wedding & turned heel on Lethal before getting his own beating by the groomsmen. The heel turn was great but for him to get laid out by the legends right afterwards killed it & turned this turned into a wrestlecrap segment. At least you got to see old school legends & names from the past like Kamala, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts (complete with snake), Koko B. Ware, and George ""The Animal"" Steele who of course munched on his favorite snack...the turnbuckle.(Slammiversary '08)Makerover Battle Royal/Ladder Match - All the knockouts (except Kong & Saeed) are in the battle royal & the final two will wrestle in a Ladder Match with the winner getting a title shot while the loser gets her head shaved...except for Gail Kim who won immunity so if she loses then the last knockout eliminated in the battle royal would get her shaved. Just like any time TNA has a multiperson match that has more than one stage (ala ""Queen Of The Cage"" at Lockdown), they got the first stage over with pretty quickly as the only thing noteworthy in the battle royal was Khan tossing Hemme out but instead of going straight to the floor, Hemme hit the apron hip first on the way down. The Ladder Match was between Gail & Roxxi with Angelina Love being the one who should get shaved if Gail loses so she constantly kept interfearing with Velvet Sky getting involved as well. The battle royal part wasn't anything special as it was just a way to shove all the knockouts onto the PPV but the Ladder Match wasn't as good as it could have been because of the constant interference from ""The Beautiful People."" The crowd was chanting ""Fire Russo"" afterwards during the headshaving but with the booking of this match, you could see why as the only real highlight was Roxxi getting her head busted open which you clearly saw how bad it was when she got her haircut (the blood on her head resembled the time Raven got sheered by James Mitchell years ago).(Sacrifice '08)Six Sides Of Steel Cage Match: Gail Kim & O.D.B. vs. Awesome Kong & Raisha Saeed - Kong was suffering from a minor back injury while I don't recall Saeed wrestling in TNA before this match so this didn't live up to the expectations that the series between Kong & both O.D.B. & Gail had in the previous months but it should be noteworthy that Saeed did add a different taste of submission moves & mat wrestling here.(Lockdown '08)$25,000 Challenge Match: Knockouts Champion Awesome Kong vs. Taylor Wilde - For a few weeks, Awesome Kong delivered open challenges to any female to try to beat her and if they did, they would win the Knockouts Championship & $25,000...this was Taylor's third attempt at trying to beat Kong and even had Roxxi in her corner for moral support.  Kong throughout the match kept beating on her & punishing her but Wilde wouldn't give up and eventually got a quick upset pin on Kong to win the championship.(""Impact"" July '08)Bonus Match:Street Fight Match: Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - This turned out to be Gail Kim's final TNA match & she went out with a bang as they kept the old ""David vs. Goliath"" formula here along with brawling through the crowd and even incorporating weapons like the kendo stick & a chair.  It was the right match with the right person that delievered the right result for Gail to leave TNA on.The only real complaints I have here is that the Val/Lethal wedding should have been left off & that TNA completely ignored all of the buildup & womens wrestling that they were doing before they brought in the Knockouts championship like the Gail Kim vs. Jacqueline series of matches they did like their cage match from Lockdown '07 & their street fight from Impact shortly afterwards in which Jacqueline had her front teeth knocked out...both of those matches were better quality than half the matches on here.  But besides that, this is a huge improvement from their last Knockouts DVD (which was a piss poor attempt at a ""WWE Divas"" like presentation) and did a perfect job in showcasing not just an alternative to what WWE has to offer but also adding in the personality profiles so you could get to know the current womens lineup more.  This is definately worth going out of your way to take a look at, I recommend.",4,TNA Got It Right The Second Time,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,9540,"['period', 'where', 'wrestling', 'national',
