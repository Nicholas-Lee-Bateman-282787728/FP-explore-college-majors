Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[12, 14]","In the past, Disney has always seemed to have a considerable drop-off in story quality with their direct-to-dvd sequels.  ""Lion King 2"" is a prime example of this.  However, Disney's recent DVD sequels such as ""Return To Neverland,"" ""Tarzan 2,"" and ""Lion King 1 1/2,"" have all been very good.  Add ""Brother Bear 2"" to that group.Love is in the air in this sequel to the underrated ""Brother Bear.""  Joaquin Phoenix' role as Kenai has been gamely taken over by Patrick Dempsey. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas reprise their roles of Rutt and Tuke, the moose brothers.  Jeremy Suarez also returns as Koda and  Michael Clarke Duncan makes a brief appearance as his character, Tug, from the original film.  Joining the cast in new roles are Mandy Moore as Nita, Wendie Malick as Aunt Siqiniq and the hilarious Wanda Sykes as wise-cracking and wisdom-filled, Innoko.Kenai and Koda have been together for a long time, and their brotherly love is strong.  However, when one of Kenai's old (and human) playmates attempts to marry, she finds out that she must destroy an amulet that Kenai gave her a long time ago.  The problem is that she must burn it at the Equinox AND have Kenai accompany her.  Granted the ability to speak to animals in order to find Kenai, Nita sets out on her quest.  Once she finds Kenai, old flames begin to fan.  Along the way, Rutt and Tuke take a few notes in wooing the fairer sex (in this case, moosettes) from both Kenai and Nita.  Koda begins to feel left out as Kenai and Nita become closer.  In the end (and in typical Disney fashion), the tale closes with all parties being happy.  I won't give away any more info than that.As far as the production goes, ""Brother Bear 2"" appears to have received a lot more attention than most direct-to-dvd sequels.  It has a strong musical score and very good songs performed by Melissa Etheridge, though she'll surely be compared to Phil Collins' performance in the first film.  The animation is very good as well.The extras are pretty slim.  There's an Etheridge praise segment about her songs in the film and a few sneak peeks.  There's also a game that has Rutt and Tuke in it.Overall, this is a very good film with a wonderful message of sacrifice and love for others.

994113,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000FQISFS,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[3, 3]","This sequel to the best Disney animated feature of recent years continues right where the first one left off. Kenai continues his life as a bear with his adopted bear cub brother Koda. Los of fun adventures in the life of bears continue along with wacky appearances from woodland animals including racoons and the wonderfully funny moose Rut and Tuke from the original film, along with their girlfriends the moosettes. Of course things don't stay perfect for too long because Kenai's human female ""friend"" re-enters his life. And as with the first film, Kenai will have a choice to make between becoming human again and losing his Bear cub brother Koda, or staying a bear but losing the girl. Except this time the choice may not be his.The animation is not quite as good as the original but a noble effort nonetheless, and the songs by Melissa Etheridge though not as memorable as the songs of Phil Collins from Brother Bear, are extremely powerful as is the score. The humor of our favorite moose Rut and Tuke isn't as funny as the first film, but it still wouldn't be a Brother Bear film without them. Also, Rut, Tuke and Koda are voice by the original cast but the original voice of Kenai has been replaced. Still, not a problem. The strongest point as it should be is the story itself- as equally powerful as Brother Bear so prepare for yourself for tears, and also as with the original, the big choice of the film though seeming difficult to make, is made in the only way it should have been and was always meant to be.Special features on the DVD include a behind-the-scenes featurette for the music of Brother Bear 2. And as I said before, the Brother Bear 2 songs aren't as memorable as those of Phil Collins, but they are of an extremely high quality, and I'm glad they're celebrated it. There is also a game in which by answering questions you get to help Rut and Tuke impress the moosettes. Sneak Peek highlights include The Little Mermaid 2-Disc Special Edition, The Fox & The Hound 2, Cinderella III and more.The ""family-friendly"" 16:9 picture is not THX mastered but hey who needs it! Fortunately there is a choice of Dolby Digital and DTS when it comes to the sound.Overall, Brother Bear 2 is a triumph just like the original. I highly recommend it.

994124,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FQISFS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","I give only 3 stars to this film, but that is not because of the film itself, which I find is surprisingly good. I have another reason for that, which I wrote below, but before that, the facts about `Brother Bear 2.'Following the recent tradition, Disney gives us another direct-to-video sequel to their theatrically-released film. `Brother Bear 2' features most of the major characters from the original, including human-turned-bear Kenai (voice by Patrick Dempsey replacing Joaquin Phoenix) and his best friend, cute cub Koda (Jeremy Suarez). Familiar voices from Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as Rutt and Tuke, can also be heard as well as Michael Clark Duncan as Tug (Tug's scenes are brief, though).The film picks up the story where the original ended, showing Kenai and Koda living in the woods peacefully. Then young woman named Nita (voice by Mandy Moore), who was a good friend of Kenai when they were kids, comes to them, asking Kenai to help her destroy the amulet, of which power, she says, prevents her upcoming marriage. And moreover, a shaman says, to do so they have to travel to the waterfalls where young Nina and Kenai first talked about their love before Kenai is turned into a bear.The initial situation sounds a bit like `Lord of the Rings,' but the story itself is much short (74 minutes) and compactly told. Like Peter Jackson epic, Nina, Kenai and Koda encounter adventures on the way, with the jolly pair of moose, stealing raccoons, etc. What happens during the journey is not particularly original (though its outcome may surprise some) and the pace is sometimes slow, but the film is enjoyable all the same.As if reflecting the pace of the film, Melissa Etherridge provides her ballad songs which are slow but strong, sentimental but beautiful. No one will deny the beauty of her songs, but some would prefer more upbeat ones heard in other Disney films.What I thought most disappointing is the visuals of the film. The designs of the mountains, woods, or the characters themselves are more than adequate, but when the film comes to the scenes where complex movements of characters and objects are required, it betrays the budget which must be much lower than the original. The cat-and-mouse chase sequences involving Nina, Kenai, Koda, and the meddling raccoons could have been better with more detailed descriptions and careful treatment of the picture and the same thing can be said about the snow mountain scenes where we definitely need more actions to enjoy.It is true that `Brother Bear 2' is a better film than most of the so-called `cheapquels' from the company, and has potential to be a much better one with a portion of the budget Disney unwisely spent for the duds (of which names I don't mention here).Again I say `Brother Bear 2' is a very good film. I could have given four stars to it. If I don't do that, that's not because of the film itself. It is because the film deserves more time and money to spend like some of the good direct-to-video films the company keeps producing without knowing their true values.",3,"Good Story of Friendship: Better Than Most of Disney's Direct-to-Video Sequels, And Definitely Could Be Much Better",1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,3057,"['give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'find', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'have', 'reason', 'wrote', 'facts', 'Bear', '2', ""'Following"", 'recent', 'tradition', 'Disney', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'theatrically-released', 'film', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'features', 'most', 'major', 'characters', 'original', 'including', 'human-turned-bear', 'Kenai', 'voice', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'replacing', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'best', 'friend', 'cute', 'cub', 'Koda', 'Jeremy', 'Suarez', 'Familiar', 'voices', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Dave', 'Thomas', 'Rutt', 'Tuke', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'heard', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'Tug', 'Tug', 'scenes', 'are', 'brief', 'though', '.The', 'film', 'up', 'story', 'where', 'original', 'ended', 'showing', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'living', 'woods', 'peacefully', 'Then', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Nita', 'voice', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'Kenai', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'asking', 'Kenai', 'help', 'destroy', 'amulet', 'power', 'upcoming', 'marriage', 'moreover', 'shaman', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'travel', 'waterfalls', 'where', 'young', 'Nina', 'Kenai', 'first', 'talked', 'love', 'Kenai', 'turned', 'bear.The', 'initial', 'situation', 'bit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'story', 'much', 'short', '74', 'minutes', 'compactly', 'told', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'epic', 'Nina', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'encounter', 'adventures', 'way', 'jolly', 'pair', 'moose', 'stealing', 'raccoons', 'etc', 'What', 'journey', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'outcome', 'may', 'surprise', 'pace', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'same.As', 'reflecting', 'pace', 'film', 'Melissa', 'Etherridge', 'ballad', 'songs', 'are', 'slow', 'strong', 'sentimental', 'beautiful', 'one', 'will', 'deny', 'beauty', 'songs', 'would', 'prefer', 'more', 'upbeat', 'ones', 'heard', 'other', 'Disney', 'films.What', 'thought', 'most', 'disappointing', 'visuals', 'film', 'designs', 'mountains', 'woods', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'when', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'complex', 'movements', 'characters', 'objects', 'are', 'required', 'budget', 'must', 'be', 'much', 'lower', 'original', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Nina', 'Kenai', 'Koda', 'meddling', 'raccoons', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'careful', 'treatment', 'picture', 'same', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'snow', 'mountain', 'scenes', 'where', 'definitely', 'need', 'more', 'actions', 'enjoy.It', 'true', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'better', 'film', 'most', 'so-called', 'cheapquels', 'company', 'potential', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'portion', 'budget', 'Disney', 'unwisely', 'spent', 'duds', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'here', '.Again', 'say', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'money', 'spend', 'good', 'direct-to-video', 'films', 'company', 'producing', 'knowing', 'true', 'values']",N/A

Overall, however, I actually found this movie more moving and more enjoyable to watch--over and over again--than the original Brother Bear. I also liked the score and the songs just as well, if not better, in this wonderful sequel. (What the heck does singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge's sexual orientation have to do with anything? See review dated Oct 9, 2006.)[Warning: Next paragraph may contain minor ""spoilers.""]I have raised two sons. Now, I am raising two daughters, so perhaps I have become a sentimentalist! Well, so be it. I am touched, and I want my children to be touched emotionally, when we see the occasional examples of true love in these Disney movies; such as, when Koda is willing to let Kenai return to human form if that is what will make Kenai happy, when Kenai later refuses because his little brother needs him, or in the Tarzan movies when Kala says to Tarzan that all she wants as a mom is for him to be happy--and means it, even though it would make her very sad if he leaves. Or, when Tarzan says: ""... you will always be my mother."" And when Kerchak finally acknowledges Tarzan as ""my son."" This depth of love--true love--is also displayed by Feline in Bambi II as she is genuinely happy for Bambi to be running off with his father when she would undoubtedly prefer than he stay and play with her.These are moments that should touch us emotionally, and perhaps the ""Two Worlds - One Family"" theme of the Tarzan movies is particularly meaningful to us because our two adopted girls have different racial backgrounds.Anyway, for whatever it may be worth, I love Brother Bear 2 and enjoy sharing it with all of those close to me who can appreciate this kind of movie. Watch it. I think you will find that the strong criticisms of some are overstated and perhaps even unjustified--but that's why we have chocolate and vanilla, n'est-ce pas??!!!",5,"Color Me a Sentimentalist, but I Like BB2 Even Better than the Original",1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,2073,"['Yes', 'true', 'original', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'more', 'earthy', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'using', 'voice', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Sha-Woman', 'sequel', 'was', 'little', 'odd', 'Overall', 'however', 'actually', 'found', 'movie', 'more', 'moving', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'original', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'also', 'liked', 'score', 'songs', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'wonderful', 'sequel', 'What', 'heck', 'singer-songwriter', 'Melissa', 'Etheridge', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'See', 'review', 'dated', 'Oct', '9', '2006', '[', 'Warning', 'Next', 'paragraph', 'may', 'contain', 'minor', 'spoilers', ']', 'have', 'raised', 'two', 'sons', 'Now', 'am', 'raising', 'two', 'daughters', 'perhaps', 'have', 'become', 'sentimentalist', 'Well', 'so', 'be', 'am', 'touched', 'want', 'children', 'be', 'touched', 'emotionally', 'when', 'see', 'occasional', 'examples', 'true', 'love', 'Disney', 'movies', 'such', 'when', 'Koda', 'willing', 'let', 'Kenai', 'return', 'human', 'form', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'Kenai', 'happy', 'when', 'Kenai', 'later', 'little', 'brother', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'when', 'Kala', 'Tarzan', 'mom', 'be', 'happy', 'even', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'Tarzan', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'mother', 'when', 'Kerchak', 'finally', 'Tarzan', 'son', 'depth', 'love', 'true', 'love', 'also', 'displayed', 'Feline', 'Bambi', 'II', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'Bambi', 'be', 'running', 'off', 'father', 'when', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'prefer', 'stay', 'play', 'her.These', 'are', 'moments', 'should', 'touch', 'emotionally', 'perhaps', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'One', 'Family', 'theme', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'particularly', 'meaningful', 'two', 'adopted', 'girls', 'have', 'different', 'racial', 'backgrounds.Anyway', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'love', 'Brother', 'Bear', '2', 'enjoy', 'sharing', 'close', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'kind', 'movie', 'Watch', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'strong', 'criticisms', 'are', 'overstated', 'perhaps', 'even', 'unjustified', 'why', 'have', 'chocolate', 'vanilla', ""n'est-ce"", 'pas']",N/A
