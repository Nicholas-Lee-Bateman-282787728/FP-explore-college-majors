1029910,AUDWCQXIG0QZG,B000JYW5DM,abettertomorrow,"[9, 16]","Plot holes (the details of the kidnapping), random nonsense (the opening sequence and Cage's hallucinations), outrageous over-acting (""Not the bees!""), and general silliness (Cage karate-kicking a teenaged girl across a room) abound in this hilarious remake of the original cult classic.  Honestly, I'd rather watch this film than sit through another bloated ""blockbuster"" like any Spiderman or Pirates movie.In this case, the whole is lesser than the sum of its parts; The Wicker Man features a good cast, a good director, good cinematography, and a good score.  However, the end result is just plain bad.  It's sort of a paradox.  What makes it funny is how director Neil LaBute films every scene with such heavy-handedness and dramatic zeal that it skews the film, transforming it from a suspensful mystery into a demented experiment in making every little thing as bold and obtuse as possible...like, for example, a certain scene involving a stolen bicycle.In the center of it all is Nicholas Cage, in one of his most bipolar and over-the-top performances of his career.  Personally, I find Cage to be likable and watchable in every role, including this one.  This time, however, he's not watchable because his character and acting are interesting, he's watchable just because you want to see what crazy thing his character does next: for example, running up a hill in a bear costume and punching a woman out, making her roll back down the hill.In fact, the movie is worth it just for that scene alone.  In conclusion, don't pass up the chance to see this film.

1029913,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000JYW5DM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 4]","Have you ever had those moments in life in which you see a film years ago and you thought it was okay back then, but then when you watch it again it sucks? That's what happened when I watched this film. I thought it was okay three years ago, but then I watched it again and realized that it was a truly bad horror/suspense film. Now I have raved about a number of films that I think people unfairly victimize for being different, but sadly, this film isn't one of those films. This is a laughably bad horror film that has to be witnessed to be believed at how shoddy this film is.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film starts off with the main character Edward Malus (Played by washed up actor Nicholas Cage) and a car crash which leaves him depressed. But then out of the blue, he receives a letter his ex-fiancee named Willow who wants him to come to an island known as Summersisle, in which she claims that her daughter; Rowan; who is allegedly Edward's daughter as well has been kidnapped by the cult that runs the island. So Edward travels to the island to find out what has happened to Rowan and uncovers a sinister plot full of lies, and there is no escaping from it.MUSIC: It's a shame that such a good musical score was wasted for such an awful film. The music excels and is well-composed (Unlike the film) which is why I think it should have been used for a much better film.ACTION: This film is boring and is certainly not scary. The only shocking part about this film is the ending (Which is on side A of the disc because of the alternate ending), but other than that this film is a complete mess. The script is a ham-fisted, worthless effort that goes nowhere and doesn't come together. It's a grungy, disjointed mess. Most of the film is Nicholas Cage wandering aimlessly throughout the island continuously asking about Rowan and no one bothers to answer him. This film has no suspense involved because you don't care what happens, and you'll never root for Nicholas Cage. This film fails spectacularly as a horror film and as a suspense film.ACTING: This was just appalling. Nicholas Cage puts on a horrendous performance as a cop. He seems bored and makes his performance even worse with laughable dialogue that is never believable. Everyone else puts on terrible performances as well and you're not scared of them as a cult, they just look and sound ridiculous (Wait till you see Sister Summersisle's face paint for the festival, it looks like face paint they use at football games). But then again, I don't know whether to blame the actors themselves, or this horrendous script. Most likely it's both.OVERALL: The only way anyone will ever enjoy this film is in a B-movie way. Everything about this film is laughably bad (A cult obsessed with bees?) from its ludicrous and disjointed plot, to the terrible acting, and to the laughable dialogue, this film is sure-fire miss. If for some reason you want to see this film, only rent it. This might appeal to some, but for everyone else, you should just avoid it. If you want a good horror film about a crazy cult that's actually scary, I suggest you try the superb Silent Hill instead of this tripe. No wonder this was voted as being one of the worst horror remakes of all time.THE GOOD: Good music, some nice set designs, and the alternate ending was weird.THE BAD: Ham-fisted script that goes nowhere, horrendous acting and dialogue, it's completely boring, it's not scary, and it's not suspenseful.",1,FRIGHTFULLY BAD  3 OUT OF 10,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,3453,"['Have', 'ever', 'had', 'moments', 'life', 'see', 'film', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'back', 'then', 'then', 'when', 'watch', 'again', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'realized', 'was', 'truly', 'bad', 'horror/suspense', 'film', 'Now', 'have', 'raved', 'number', 'films', 'think', 'people', 'unfairly', 'victimize', 'being', 'different', 'sadly', 'film', ""n't"", 'one', 'films', 'laughably', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'witnessed', 'be', 'believed', 'how', 'shoddy', 'film', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Edward', 'Malus', 'Played', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'car', 'crash', 'depressed', 'then', 'blue', 'letter', 'ex-fiancee', 'named', 'Willow', 'who', 'come', 'island', 'known', 'Summersisle', 'daughter', 'Rowan', 'who', 'allegedly', 'Edward', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'cult', 'island', 'So', 'Edward', 'travels', 'island', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Rowan', 'uncovers', 'sinister', 'plot', 'full', 'lies', 'escaping', 'it.MUSIC', 'shame', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'wasted', 'such', 'awful', 'film', 'music', 'excels', 'well-composed', 'film', 'why', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'much', 'better', 'film.ACTION', 'film', 'boring', 'certainly', 'not', 'scary', 'only', 'shocking', 'part', 'film', 'ending', 'Which', 'side', 'A', 'disc', 'alternate', 'ending', 'other', 'film', 'complete', 'mess', 'script', 'ham-fisted', 'worthless', 'effort', 'nowhere', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'grungy', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'Most', 'film', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'island', 'continuously', 'asking', 'Rowan', 'one', 'answer', 'film', 'suspense', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', ""'ll"", 'never', 'root', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'film', 'spectacularly', 'horror', 'film', 'suspense', 'film.ACTING', 'was', 'just', 'appalling', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'horrendous', 'performance', 'cop', 'bored', 'performance', 'even', 'worse', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'never', 'believable', 'Everyone', 'else', 'terrible', 'performances', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'scared', 'cult', 'just', 'look', 'sound', 'ridiculous', 'Wait', 'till', 'see', 'Sister', 'Summersisle', 'face', 'paint', 'festival', 'face', 'paint', 'use', 'football', 'games', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'blame', 'actors', 'horrendous', 'script', 'Most', 'likely', 'both.OVERALL', 'only', 'way', 'anyone', 'will', 'ever', 'enjoy', 'film', 'B-movie', 'way', 'Everything', 'film', 'laughably', 'bad', 'cult', 'obsessed', 'bees', 'ludicrous', 'disjointed', 'plot', 'terrible', 'acting', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'film', 'sure-fire', 'miss', 'reason', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'rent', 'might', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'just', 'avoid', 'want', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'crazy', 'cult', 'actually', 'scary', 'suggest', 'try', 'superb', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'instead', 'tripe', 'wonder', 'was', 'voted', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'horror', 'remakes', 'time.THE', 'GOOD', 'Good', 'music', 'nice', 'set', 'designs', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'weird.THE', 'BAD', 'Ham-fisted', 'script', 'nowhere', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'completely', 'boring', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'suspenseful']",N/A

1029916,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000JYW5DM,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 1]","""The Wicker Man"",for some reason,was deemed ripe for a remake. The 1973 original has Christopher Lee as a sinister,sensual Lord Summerisle... but in this version, respected ex-Mormon playwright Neil LaBute decides to turn ""Wicker Man"" into an allegory about male insecurities in the face of feminine power. The original was Christianity vs. paganism, resurrection vs. reincarnation, timeless in tackling issues such as sex education. But LaBute, usually known for his sardonic social commentary such as ""In the Company of Men"", goes back to oh-so-contemporary cliches.In the new ""Wicker Man"",Nicolas Cage learns from his ex-fiancee Willow that her daughter (he's supposed to be a virgin,so he's not the father) has gone missing. Cage ventures to the Pacific Northwest, finding Ellen Burstyn leading a matriarchal cult with Leelee Sobieski at her side. Since the cult is centered on honeybees, colony collapse disorder is a big deal,and demands the final sacrifice.The ""Wicker Man"" has unintentionally hilarious moments,MANY of them. Nicolas Cage freaks out,bellowing,""How did it get burned?"" when he confronts the ex-fiancee. Or the scene where has a vision of a drowning girl. There's ""STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!"" Or Nicolas Cage running around the beehives. Or Cage running around in a bear outfit. The final sacrifice scenes are even funnier. He gets his legs broken a la Misery,and for some reason,bees poured onto his face. While the original Summerisle was all about the union of men and women (how very heteronormative,then again,Lord Summerisle does dance in drag),in the remake, Summerisle seems to be a matriarchal lesbian colony.From Cage's overwrought ""acting"" to the ludicrous premise, ""Wicker Man"" crashes and burns.",2,Queen Bee,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1728,"['Wicker', 'Man', 'reason', 'was', 'deemed', 'ripe', 'remake', '1973', 'original', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'sinister', 'sensual', 'Lord', 'Summerisle', 'version', 'respected', 'ex-Mormon', 'playwright', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'turn', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'allegory', 'male', 'insecurities', 'face', 'feminine', 'power', 'original', 'was', 'Christianity', 'paganism', 'resurrection', 'vs.', 'reincarnation', 'timeless', 'tackling', 'issues', 'such', 'sex', 'education', 'LaBute', 'usually', 'known', 'sardonic', 'social', 'commentary', 'such', 'Company', 'Men', 'back', 'oh-so-contemporary', 'cliches.In', 'new', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'ex-fiancee', 'Willow', 'daughter', 'supposed', 'be', 'virgin', 'not', 'father', 'gone', 'missing', 'Cage', 'ventures', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'finding', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'leading', 'matriarchal', 'cult', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'side', 'cult', 'centered', 'honeybees', 'colony', 'collapse', 'disorder', 'big', 'deal', 'final', 'sacrifice.The', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'MANY', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'out', 'bellowing', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'burned', 'when', 'ex-fiancee', 'scene', 'where', 'vision', 'drowning', 'girl', 'STEP', 'AWAY', 'THE', 'BIKE', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'running', 'around', 'beehives', 'Cage', 'running', 'around', 'bear', 'outfit', 'final', 'sacrifice', 'scenes', 'are', 'even', 'funnier', 'legs', 'broken', 'la', 'Misery', 'reason', 'bees', 'poured', 'face', 'original', 'Summerisle', 'was', 'union', 'men', 'women', 'how', 'very', 'heteronormative', 'then', 'again', 'Lord', 'Summerisle', 'dance', 'drag', 'remake', 'Summerisle', 'be', 'matriarchal', 'lesbian', 'colony.From', 'Cage', 'overwrought', 'acting', 'ludicrous', 'premise', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'crashes', 'burns']",N/A

1029922,A3P3J6QFE7K230,B000JYW5DM,Atomic Grrrrrl,"[3, 3]","My title review says it all. At the start, Wicker Man is a legitimately entertaining film about a jaded cop who is sent a letter from his ex-fiance, Willow, begging him to help find her young daughter (who's vanished without a trace). Willow, however, is no ordinary old flame; she appears to be part of a strange Amish-like, secretive community called Summers Isle that lives and dresses like an 18th century agricultural society, is hostile to outsiders, and seems almost devoid of men, outside of the few who are made into little more than beasts of burden.About 2/3 into the movie, Wicker Man is indeed intriguing and even fun, as there are twists and turns to the mystery of what may happened to Willow's child. The mystique surrounding Summers Isle is also well done, because with each subsequent scene something quirky is revealed about the place that has you scratching your head and wondering what it's all about. Furthermore, you really do get a sense of underlying menace from the community, as there's a feeling that much like Jonestown, there's a darkness that lurks beneath the idyllic, pastoral setting and calm, serene faces.But for all its strengths in the beginning, Wicker Man suddenly goes south in the last act-- and very badly. For one, the search for Willow's kid starts to get pretty tedious, as scene after scene has Cage's character (Malus) running around aimlessly chasing blind leads, having annoying obstacles being thrown in his way, or being led astray by red herrings. Adding to the tediousness are the inclusion of these annoying flashbacks that Malus keeps having of an incident that happened before he went to Summers Isle (of a mother and child being burned alive in a car accident). On the surface, they seem to have relevance to the story, as if they will help Malus figure out where Willow's kid is. But as it turns out, they're nothing more than red herrings that add nothing to the story and distract from the plot.But that's just the beginning of the film's downturn. There's the acting, direction, and writing to contend with, which mysteriously takes a dramatic turn for the worse in the last act, as if everyone was stricken with amnesia and suddenly forgot how to write for, act in, and direct a movie. Some lowpoints:1) ""HOW DID IT GET BURNED?!"" screams Cage histrionically at his co-star, who looks legitimately frightened in real life by his outburst and screams back ""I don't know!""2) ""It's still murder,"" mutters Cage while literally blinking, rubbing his eye, and squinting.3) ""Step away from the bike,"" barks Cage, acting like a tough guy by turning his gun on a woman in order to steal her bicycle... only to cycle away on it like a little pansy.4) POW! goes Cage as he punches three women (in one scene actually wearing a bear suit!)Then we get to the piece de la resistance: 5) Awful, cheesy dialog when the villagers finally attack Malus. (""What? What is it? What is it? What is that?"" ""Augh!! My legs!"" ""Not the bees! Not the beees! ARRRRRRGGGHHHHH!!!"")And then of course, 6) the fact that he dies, making the entire story pointless to begin with.A shame that this movie degraded so rapidly, because it did present some genuinely interesting ideas and had the potential to be so much better than it was. Instead, everyone involved seemed to just rush it out as soon as possible without really taking the time to iron out the kinks.Oh, well.

Of course after a while he discovers it's actually *his* daughter, but by that point the viewer could really care less. Along the way we are exposed to some of the finer points of mysogyny as seen through the eyes of director Neil Labute. (Who as one review stated, needs to go on a date with a nice lady & get lots of hugs.)Personally I think this is one film that would profit from having an outside group perform a commentary, most notably the Rifftrax crew (old MST3K members) who actually made a commentary that can be synched up with the film.

She was referring to the soul of missing twelve-year-old Rowan Morrison becoming one with a dead rabbit. But never mind the rabbit or the girl; it stood alone as a very effective line, almost coming off as funny in an odd sort of way. How fitting for a film of such depth, with numerous hidden layers very much focused on transmutation. Specifically, it focuses on new perceptions of different beliefs and customs. Apparently, such ideas haven't crossed over into corporate Hollywood; the writers of this 2006 remake should have taken Cilento's line into consideration when penning the screenplay. The transmutation from British Cult Classic to American Horror Film wasn't that lovely. To be perfectly honest, it was downright heartbreaking.If there's any way in which this new ""Wicker Man"" outdoes the original, it's in its cinematography; the color palette is muddy and overwhelming, as if a painter had been a little too careless with his or her color combinations. It suited such a dark story perfectly, especially since it takes place on a remote island off the coast of Washington state. But a film's look means absolutely nothing if connected to a substandard story. Not only does this movie lack any of the original's genuinely unsettling aspects, it also skews the commentary on culture clash by means of unnecessary shock value. Instead of an isolated group of nature worshippers living in harmony, we now have an isolated group of extremists who revere the feminine and punish the masculine. Is it any wonder that they worship bees, an insect species with male drones working for the queen on a regular basis?This is a real shame for California police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage), whose arrival on the island of Summersisle is apparently met with intense malaise. Part of the problem is that he came to them right before a yearly harvest ceremony, one that they've held sacred for hundreds of years. But none of this matters; because Malus' former fiancee Willow (Kate Beahan) wrote to him out of desperation, he's willing to grin and bear it. That's because Willow's daughter, Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair), has gone missing. It's a pretty personal situation for Malus, who hasn't gotten over a car accident that killed a woman and a girl during a routine traffic stop. He has haunting visions of them both during the course of the movie, all of which initially seem relevant but ultimately serve no purpose.His emotional turmoil ineffectively replaces that of Sergeant Howie from the 1973 film; he was a deeply devout Christian, strictly adhered to old fashioned, conservative values. That aspect meshed well with the main plot, which involved him being thrust into a world he was completely unfamiliar with. It was the perfect setup for his interactions with the Summerisle natives, which worked better than they did for Malus in this remake. In the original film, Howie saw the natives as nothing more than heathens that believe in pagan ideals and perform morally reprehensible rituals. True enough; their free spirited worship of nature would take a little getting used to, especially since they constantly celebrated with song and dance and had much less repressive views on sex. But from the audience's perspective, they seemed like decent, innocent people. At least, it seemed so until the end of the movie (which I can't give away for those of you who haven't seen it).The same can't be said for the remake. The moment Malus steps onto the island, the audience is immediately turned off by the natives. They're consistently creepy, detached, and aloof, qualities that detract from instead of enhance the seriousness of Malus' state of mind. I say this because the thoughts running through his head are much more disturbing than the islanders' cold reception. I would have liked it much more if today's audience had been tricked like the audiences of the 1970s were; for them, it wasn't immediately obvious that something was wrong with the people, and that made the final scenes that much more unsettling. But for us, the new version leaves no question that these people are odd. Because of that, the formerly shocking aspects of the final scenes are now reduced to an unsatisfying inevitability.But before any of that happens, the mystery of Rowan grows deeper. Malus is continuously evaded as he attempts to get to the bottom of things. Passing around the girl's picture isn't getting anywhere, and neither is questioning the important locals (such as a schoolteacher, an innkeeper, and a doctor/photographer). No one seems to recognize her, despite the fact that he's found numerous clues of her existence (most notably her name written in the school registry book). Unfortunately, Willow is proving to be of little help. She secretly meets with him on a regular basis, each time giving him vague explanations that don't point at the truth so much as they barely hint at it. She claims to be afraid of the residents of Summersisle, convinced that they're trying to punish her for being so headstrong. She did, after all, leave her home and get engaged with an outsider.But the more Malus listens to her, the less sense the situation makes. With few resources left, he meets with Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), the religious leader of the island (portrayed as Lord Summerisle in the original film by Christopher Lee). Her speech on the founding of the island and on the importance of their beliefs does little to encourage Malus. However, it does convince him that he needs to act quickly; he firmly believes that Rowan is in danger, and he has to rely on no one else for help. He eventually realizes that he can't even rely on the law, which he had thus far been using to his advantage. (Odd, considering a California police officer would have no jurisdiction in Washington state. But I digress.)By the time we get to the ending and meet the barely mentioned Wicker Man, the audience will come to the conclusion that the experience has been nothing but wasted effort. I say this mostly in reference to the new story, which ineffectively attempts to frighten the audience. The methods used in each version of the film couldn't have been anything less alike. I suppose this wouldn't have been so bad had the remake not relied so much on the original film's structure (exempting the inclusion of a completely unnecessary epilogue, featuring a cameo by James Franco). The dialogue alone nearly repeats Anthony Shaffer's 1973 screenplay verbatim.Too bad such a fascinating film was reinterpreted--or transmuted, if you prefer--into such a disappointing horror flick. It isn't even impressive enough to recommend to those who haven't seen the original version. In that film, Christopher Lee says to Edward Woodward, ""Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here tomorrow to be offended by the site of our May Day celebrations."" I should think it's just as well that the movie going public not be at the theater to be offended by the site of this remake. Much like the Wicker Man, it should be burnt to the ground.",2,Weaving an Inferior Remake,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,7201,"['original', '1973', 'version', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'actress', 'Diane',

1029933,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000JYW5DM,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 5]","You have to wonder what the studio was thinking bringing Neil LaBute in to direct ""Wicker Man,"" a film that revolves around a war between the sexes. True or otherwise, LaBute does have a strong reputation as a woman hater (I believe that he hates all people equally). And I couldn't help but get dragged into the game of guessing his hidden meanings. For example, the island society run by females is supposedly scary, but why? Is a female run society inherently scary? Or is it what they stand for, hierarchical fascism and repression of individualism, things that we have in our society, that is scary? It is worth mentioning that the witch hunts are explicitly referenced. Besides being a tip off to their obvious, preposterous climax, it also makes the point that Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) shouldn't be there at all. They went there to get away from the male occupation. It's not as though the rest of the world is some prize, so maybe he should just let them and their odd rituals continue.This film has a very similar plot to another, much better LaBute film, ""The Shape of Things."" In both a male is lured into a female's lair under false pretences. The guy spends the film trying to impress the girl only so she can rip his heart out when he least expects it. OK, so maybe LaBute doesn't have a very high opinion of females. However, those females could not have been conniving backstabbers if the males weren't Neanderthals who followed the female scent wherever it may lead. The problem with this film is its failure to deliver the goods. When you sign up for a genre film you expect at least some of the conventions. This one was scare-free, not to mention dry and disoriented. It was like watching a twisted episode of ""Without a Trace,"" as Edward chases his daughter (who he just found out about) around this island filled with weirdoes. Cage sleepwalks through this film and the script gives him no help. LaBute seems to have no sense as to how to maximize scares in the editing room, and the exposition is so heavy handed that is it impossible to miss anything important. Near the end, once I had it figured out, it picked up steam as I was interested to see how it would come to its inevitable conclusion.More than anything I would say that this film is a slap in the face to all the militant do-gooders out there. The fact that Edward is a cop only makes that point more obvious. He thinks that since he has a Freeway Patrol badge and a gun that he has a license to enforce his version of right and wrong anywhere, even if it is way outside his jurisdiction in a place that has no use for his laws. We are a society filled with these types: politicians, soccer moms, Christians, etc. These people have only their best interest in mind (as in the film where Edward uses his badge to help find his missing child), and have no concept as to what is best for you. People do things for a reason and as we learned in this film they will go to extreme lengths to protect their utopian ways. I think we can safely say LaBute was on the side of the girls in this one. **1/2",2,What is a Wicker Man good for??,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,3083,"['have', 'wonder', 'what', 'studio', 'was', 'thinking', 'bringing', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'direct', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'film', 'war', 'sexes', 'True', 'otherwise', 'LaBute', 'have', 'strong', 'reputation', 'woman', 'hater', 'believe', 'people', 'equally', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'dragged', 'game', 'guessing', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'example', 'island', 'society', 'run', 'females', 'supposedly', 'scary', 'why', 'female', 'run', 'society', 'inherently', 'scary', 'what', 'stand', 'hierarchical', 'fascism', 'repression', 'individualism', 'things', 'have', 'society', 'scary', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'witch', 'hunts', 'are', 'explicitly', 'referenced', 'being', 'tip', 'obvious', 'preposterous', 'climax', 'also', 'point', 'Edward', 'Malus', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'went', 'there', 'get', 'away', 'male', 'occupation', 'not', 'rest', 'world', 'prize', 'so', 'maybe', 'should', 'just', 'let', 'odd', 'rituals', 'continue.This', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'LaBute', 'film', 'Shape', 'Things', 'male', 'lured', 'female', 'lair', 'false', 'pretences', 'guy', 'film', 'trying', 'impress', 'girl', 'only', 'so', 'can', 'rip', 'heart', 'out', 'when', 'least', 'OK', 'maybe', 'LaBute', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'opinion', 'females', 'However', 'females', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'conniving', 'backstabbers', 'males', 'were', ""n't"", 'Neanderthals', 'who', 'followed', 'female', 'scent', 'may', 'lead', 'problem', 'film', 'failure', 'deliver', 'goods', 'When', 'sign', 'up', 'genre', 'film', 'expect', 'least', 'conventions', 'one', 'was', 'scare-free', 'not', 'mention', 'dry', 'disoriented', 'was', 'watching', 'twisted', 'episode', 'Trace', 'Edward', 'daughter', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'island', 'filled', 'weirdoes', 'Cage', 'sleepwalks', 'film', 'script', 'help', 'LaBute', 'have', 'sense', 'how', 'maximize', 'scares', 'editing', 'room', 'exposition', 'so', 'heavy', 'handed', 'impossible', 'miss', 'anything', 'important', 'end', 'once', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'come', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.More', 'anything', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'slap', 'face', 'militant', 'do-gooders', 'there', 'fact', 'Edward', 'cop', 'only', 'point', 'more', 'obvious', 'Freeway', 'Patrol', 'badge', 'gun', 'license', 'enforce', 'version', 'right', 'wrong', 'anywhere', 'even', 'way', 'jurisdiction', 'place', 'use', 'laws', 'are', 'society', 'filled', 'types', 'politicians', 'soccer', 'moms', 'Christians', 'etc', 'people', 'have', 'only', 'best', 'interest', 'mind', 'film', 'where', 'Edward', 'badge', 'help', 'find', 'missing', 'child', 'have', 'concept', 'what', 'best', 'People', 'do', 'things', 'reason', 'learned', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'extreme', 'lengths', 'protect', 'utopian', 'ways', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'LaBute', 'was', 'side', 'girls', 'one', '**1/2']",N/A

1029939,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000JYW5DM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 4]","Here I am, having finally decided that I no longer dislike Nicolas Cage as an actor, and now I have to evaluate his role in The Wicker Man, a distinctly odd film that never manages to live up to its potential.  If you like your plots loose, disjointed, and full of unanswered questions, this is your film.  (Personally, I have a hard time figuring out why one of my favorite actresses, Leelee Sobieski, is stuck playing a fairly insignificant role in any film, but that's just me.)  Still, despite quite an over-the-top performance by Cage and a less than stellar plot, this movie isn't all that bad, especially for those who have never seen the original film.  One thing you cannot take away from The Wicker Man is its distinctly un-Hollywoodlike ending.  The conclusion alone makes the film worth watching, if you ask me, because it throws a monkey wrench into the years of programming droned into our heads by Hollywood lackies lacking the guts to rock any cinematic boats.  This modern incarnation of The Wicker Man may be a fairly disappointing movie overall, but the ending will greatly defy most viewers' expectations - and I count that as a good thing.The beginning of the film can boast of its own fair amount of shock value, as well - a traumatic accident that sends officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) for quite a loop.  Then, from out of nowhere, he gets a letter from his former fianc&eacute;e asking for his help in finding her missing daughter.  This girl, Willow (Kate Beahan, who's quite a looker in my book) basically walked out on him for no reason a number of years earlier, so it's strange for her to be contacting him now.  It's also strange that the letter arrived with no stamps or postage.  The strangest thing of all, though, is the fact that this letter is a model of calligraphy, not exactly the kind of writing you would expect to see from the hand of a mother desperately worried about her missing daughter.  Edward bites, though, and takes it upon himself to head out to Summersisle, a mysterious, very private island off the Washington coast, to try and help Willow find her daughter.It's pretty obvious from the start that Summersisle is the abode of a crazy back-to-nature, feminist witch-like cult, so Edward would not have been welcomed with open arms even if he hadn't thrown his weight around like he's Columbo come to solve the big mystery of the week (even a bunch of reclusive pagan cultists probably know that a California badge counts for jack squat on a private island hundreds of miles away).  Being a traffic cop and not an investigator, Edward has a heck of a time just figuring out whether the girl, Rowan ever existed, if she actually died, or if she still lives, but his instincts tell him that Rowan is to be sacrificed to appease the angry gods of a ludicrous cult of bee-happy women.  Don't expect a Mr. Mustard with a candlestick in the library ending here.  Edward Malus is no Sherlock Holmes.If you haven't seen the original 1973 The Wicker Man, I think this movie is well worth watching.

You have to remember lots of people did lots of drugs in the 70's, which made James Taylor, disco and the original The Wicker Man seem much cooler than they are.Based on the 70's cult hit (I warned you), Nicolas Cage stars as California sheriff Edward Malus.  After witnessing a horrific accident and failing to save the victims, he has fallen into a great depression.  One day, he receives a letter from his old fianc&eacute;e, Willow (Kate Beahan), begging for help in finding her lost daughter.  Compelled by current circumstances and his desire to help a woman who meant so much to him in the past, he travels to her remote island community in the Puget Sound, and starts an investigation that leads to great peril.Was Willow's daughter kidnapped?  Why?  What has become of her?When he was reading the script, and saw the part of the movie where he is supposed to run through the forest in a bear suit, I hope Cage asked for a huge pay raise.  If he didn't, I have lost all respect for him because this movie is a silly piece of junk you should only participate in for a huge sum of money that makes up for the assault on your integrity (I can handle movie fans all across the world laughing at me if it helps buy a Bulgarian castle like the one Cage just purchased).Writer/director Neil Labute does include some frightful moments, but they are cheap frights that have nothing to do with advancing the story or helping understand the characters better.  Then, he takes us through an unacceptably meaningless plot that can be predicted within the first 15 - 20 minutes even if you never knew the movie was a remake.  The dialogue is supposed to be mysterious and get us more intrigued, but just ends up mocking the horridness of the movie on the big screen before you.Meanwhile, Edward is sent running all around the island in a series of uneventful scenes that fail to build any tension partly because they are ill-conceived (based on the original script by Anthony Shaffer) and partly because Labute makes the action move at the speed of a glacier.  However, if you fall asleep, Cage will wake you up with his ranting and raving.While the rest of the characters are all moving through the movie in a haze (you'll understand why when you learn about the story or, God forbid, see this movie), Cage gets ample opportunities to ham it up as Edward gets pushed further and further over the edge.  Most of the performance feels forced, which is a shame from someone as talented as Cage, but I think he was trying to compensate for the disaster going on all around him.The Wicker Man commits the worst sin a serious thriller, action film or horror movie can - it is outright silly and laughable.",1,Pointless.

1029945,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000JYW5DM,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 2]","""The Wicker Man"" is a serious problem, and yet I was entertained because it's problematic.  Like certain people on the net, I too saw the 'greatest moments' that this film had to offer, and after watching the movie, it rings true to its audacious nature.  The harbinger of the audacity is Nicholas Cage, who REALLY overacted to the point of hilarity.  Cage has always been eccentric for his entire career, but he went completely batty for this film; It's like the actor has channeled Jack Bauer and tried to follow that method for the entire movie.  His character spend most of the time yelling and being unnecessarily aggressive towards the fellow women of Summersile.  I know he's a cop and he's serious in helping his ex-wife find her daughter, but there's a thing called composure; he clearly didn't know how to stay calm even when nothing's going on.  His over-the-top acting, not to mentions his actions like when he's running on a field of beehives, was nevertheless my source of joy for this film.Take my 3-star review with grain of salt.  If you're not amused by a theatrical car crash, then you might as well look away.  Technically, ""The Wicker Man"" is a two-star movie at best, and not just because Nicholas Cage isn't the right actor for the role.  The scare tactics are tacky and it's strongly misogynistic in how women are viewed as vindictive and deceptive (though in my opinion, this movie doesn't insult all women; just the amish ones).  I don't think the movie is nonsensical plot-wise, although the whole prologue with the car crash didn't served anything in the long run; the twist in the end was very elaborate (if I hadn't seen the video, I probably wouldn't see it coming), and I had to wonder why such a scenario wasn't simplified to just have it done on the first day.  On the unironic side, it does have good cinematography and the costumes were nicely woven.It's recommended to only see the unrated version, since the theatrical cut has a rushed third act and a cop-out epilogue that had no purpose; plus, only the unrated cut had the bee scene.  It's only a slight improvement to an otherwise flawed movie, but really, the movie is in lieu to ""Dreamcatcher"": both are lousy horror movies, but both are hilarious popcorn-fodder.",3,The Divine Saps of the Cuckoo Sisterhood,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2256,"['Wicker', 'Man', 'serious', 'problem', 'yet', 'was', 'entertained', 'problematic', 'certain', 'people', 'net', 'too', 'saw', ""'greatest"", 'moments', 'film', 'had', 'offer', 'watching', 'movie', 'true', 'audacious', 'nature', 'harbinger', 'audacity', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'REALLY', 'overacted', 'point', 'hilarity', 'Cage', 'always', 'been', 'eccentric', 'entire', 'career', 'went', 'completely', 'batty', 'film', 'actor', 'channeled', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'tried', 'follow', 'method', 'entire', 'movie', 'character', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'yelling', 'being', 'unnecessarily', 'aggressive', 'towards', 'fellow', 'women', 'Summersile', 'know', 'cop', 'serious', 'helping', 'ex-wife', 'find', 'daughter', 'thing', 'called', 'composure', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stay', 'calm', 'even', 'when', 'nothing', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'not', 'mentions', 'actions', 'when', 'running', 'field', 'beehives', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'source', 'joy', 'film.Take', '3-star', 'review', 'grain', 'salt', ""'re"", 'not', 'amused', 'theatrical', 'car', 'crash', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'away', 'Technically', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'two-star', 'movie', 'best', 'not', 'just', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'right', 'actor', 'role', 'scare', 'tactics', 'are', 'tacky', 'strongly', 'misogynistic', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'viewed', 'vindictive', 'deceptive', 'opinion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'insult', 'women', 'just', 'amish', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'nonsensical', 'plot-wise', 'whole', 'prologue', 'car', 'crash', 'did', ""n't"", 'served', 'anything', 'long', 'run', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'elaborate', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'video', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'had', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'scenario', 'was', ""n't"", 'simplified', 'just', 'have', 'done', 'first', 'day', 'unironic', 'side', 'have', 'good', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'were', 'nicely', 'woven.It', 'recommended', 'only', 'see', 'unrated', 'version', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'rushed', 'third', 'act', 'cop-out', 'epilogue', 'had', 'purpose', 'only', 'unrated', 'cut', 'had', 'bee', 'scene', 'only', 'slight', 'improvement', 'otherwise', 'flawed', 'movie', 'really', 'movie', 'lieu', 'Dreamcatcher', 'are', 'lousy', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'hilarious', 'popcorn-fodder']",N/A

There you had a multi layered film which depicted a clash between two utterly irreconciliable cultures - Christianity and Paganism.The remake unfortunately takes the 'lets portray the Pagans as villains' stance from the start, and in doing so totally loses the shock value that the original managed to impact onto its audience.Nicholas Cage is miscast to the point of being embarrassing in his role as the Policeman investigating a missing child report. He just seems to stumble through the film looking incredibly uncomfortable and never settles into the role. The depiction of the island's residents as being mean and sinister from the start does nothing to build any surprise whatsoever, instead it just makes them into the 'demented locals' common in so many horror flicks, from the first time they appear.The ending while a tad more brutal than the original, lacks all of the first film's power and shock at that point. Instead of being a total shock, it is actually expected because in the remake, the viewer has been expecting something bad to happen to Cage's character on account of what has gone on before - ie. the mean and sinister locals. Whereas the original remained a mystery up to the end where before that point, the locals had been portrayed as having eccentric beliefs but were quite charming and full of life.This said, the remake does have a few things going for it. The cinematography is really good and the use of light and colour create a genuinely unsettling atmosphere, particularly the rural sequences on the island. Ellen Burstyn is good in the Christopher Lee role and it is a shame that her character was not given a bit more development and screen time. If it had then I have no doubt that it would have improved the film overall.At the end of the day, see the original which remains a stunning one off.

Duh! I gave this movie one star because Nicholas Cage did his usual good acting otherwise it would have gotten 0. The idea was sort of OK, but I figured out it was a set up about half way through the film.I kept thinking ""What would Jack do!"". That's how I rate these kinds of movies nowadays. Jack would have kicked one of those bitches in a chair, tied her up and made her squeal like a pig in the first five minutes. End of the game right there.But the thing that really makes this movie ludicrous it that the director expects the audience to believe that a pilot who delivers goods to the island everyday can be killed, have his airplane sunk (with the tip of the wing still sticking out of the water) and no one on the mainland is going to miss him. Duh! Like an airplane and pilot disappear and nobody is going to try to find out what happened to the pilot or the plane when the pilot must buy supplies, get gas, have relatives and do about a hundred other everyday things that suddenly stop happening. Gee, we must be in Russia or North Korea or maybe on another planet if you think that is going to happen. Even a little airplane like that has to file a flight plan.So, eventually when the investigation really begins (after someone finally says ""Hmm, ole Jeb's been missing 10 years now, should we send out a search party""?  how are the Amazons going to explain a dead pilot, sunk airplane, and the fact that the airplane's radio has been shredded? Aliens? Also, After Nicholas Cage finds the airplane with the radio ripped out, he does nothing. Duh! I guess he figured that was normal since he didn't even mention it to anyone.You would think that after finding the plane with no pilot (before it was sunk) and the radio ripped out he would have given some kind of indication that there was something extremely bad happening there besides a bunch of wackos running around acting like they're in a Greek tragedy. (I guess we are just supposed to suspend our ability to think at this point).But no, he just saunters around the island like that was an everyday occurrence. Maybe he thought the pilot was having a tall cool one up at the ""inn"".I don't mind ludicrous movies as long as they are believable and people who are intelligent act with intelligence which it seems like a lot of the directors nowadays don't have.

I also wish there was a way to rate a movie with zero stars.  First problem is an interesting and  eerie prologue that raises questions but is never dealt with again except for repeated flashbacks the main character experiences.  The whole plot then hinges on policeman Cage responding to a cryptic letter from an ex-fiance who dumped him 10 years before.  For the plot to work at all, he must come alone to an isolated island with neither any reliable method to communicate nor any way to get off the island and apparently having not told his superiors where he was going.  Then alone and out of his jurisdiction he seems to think he can get cooperation from a bunch of in-breed inhabitants of an isolated island who are a law unto themselves just by flashing his badge and yelling threats at them.  He then takes silly chances like crawling into places that can be locked behind him, trapping him inside.  Without going into the plot which other reviewers have described in detail, Cage frantically searches for the missing child, apparently with no thought given as to how he would get her, his ex-fiance, and himself off the island.  Had the movie ended about 5 minutes earlier with the islanders circling Cage and his situation hopeless, it would have made for a better movie, albeit a depressing and frustrating one.  But no, the movie makers had to add some gratuitous violence to drive home their point (whatever it was).

There was a Goddess religion in pre-historic Europe and the Near East, they did sacrifice scapegoats in Celtic Britain in a wicker statue and often the Goddess was manifested as a bee goddess throughout the world. Also, in many places, such as Pelasgian Greece and Minoan Crete the  followers of the Goddess religion  sacrificed a king each year to ensure the fertility of the crops (see Mary Renault's ""The King Must Die"" and ""The Bull From the Sea""). Also, having freshly come out of totemism, celebrants wore the masks of animals, which is common in shamanism and is even reflected in the Greek myth of Io.

There's nothing to say.""And indeed there is little to say about this flaccid, nonsensical remake of the classic cult horror movie. Little that's positive, anyway -- the movie stumbles around blindly, trying to give itself atmosphere with hokey tricks and silly-looking cinematography. Put simply, ""The Wicker Man"" is a big, weird mess.Cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is recuperating from a traumatic incident, which means he's not on top form when his ex-fiance Willow (Kate Beahan) gets in touch with him. Her child Rowan has vanished, and she wants Malus' help. And so he travels to a remote northern island, ruled by the matriarch Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn).It seems that the people there are some kind of bizarre neopagan tribe, and the women all hate Malus. The few men there are basically second-class citizens. And as Malus comes closer to finding the little girl who may be his daughter, he discovers a horrifying secret -- which is waiting for him.Remaking anything is a tricky business, and ""The Wicker Man"" takes the worst possible approach -- it tries to bluster through. It has a lot to bluster about, because there's no suspense, no atmosphere, and no horror -- only a lame and unsuspenseful mystery, and a bad acid-trip finale, with lots of people in animal costumes.To make matters worse worse, it feels like it was scripted by several different people who never bothered to consult each other. Allusions -- like Malus' tape -- are dropped. The emotional appeal is trite. The metaphors and symbolism are appallingly blatant, until you feel that Cage's character must be the biggest idiot on the Pacific coast if he hasn't clued in yet.Director Neil LaBute obviously has no idea how to bring this celluloid Frankenstein's monster to life. So he dresses Cage in a furry costume and saddles the incoherent script with weird bee analogies and absurd dialogue (""Killing me won't bring back your g*dd*mn honey!""), apparently hoping that it will overcome the flimsy plot.Even worse, sometimes it gets unintentionally campy or funny, when it's actually being deadly serious. The most unintentionally funny moment of the movie comes when Burstyn dramatically says, ""Prepare the drone!"" near the climax. You'll be rolling off your seat.Cage himself comes across as confused and over-the-top (""How'd it get burnt?"" repeated over and over), and it's hard to care whether his character lives or dies. Burstyn does as well as can be expected, given that her matriarch is a pale shadow of Christopher Lee, and a pretty silly one at that. The other actors just sleepwalk through.Remakes are bad enough, but remakes of cult classics are simply unforgivable.

Cage is absolutely awful as a cop investigating the disappearance of a young girl. The girl's mother, Cage's former flame, is in distress and we can tell from the way she opens her eyes really wide.  I am glad she did that because her lips are so full of collagen that you can barely understand her when she speaks.Cage barks, he bellows, and he punches his way through the movie; he stinks.  The supporting cast, everybody from Molly Parker to Ellen Burstyn to Frances Conroy, speak without contractions and try to make the dialogue come alive, but they can't.  Special mention goes to the completely miscast Diane Delano as Sister Beech who looks more like she should be teaching gym than dispensing mead.  Never in recent memory have so many good actors been so bad in one film.  The island never seems authentic, the islanders all seem to be play-acting and the film is one big mess.There are also a couple times during this movie when I started to wonder if LaBute somehow got ""The Wicker Man"" confused with ""Don't Look Now"" since midway through, he starts blatantly borrowing elements of the latter film.There's a story that one of the original prints of the 1973 film was lost under a new paved highway.

We the audience suspects nothing out of place only to find seconds later a truck driving into the car, of course fire and an explosion follows suit.

It's difficult because the original film has such power that the remake really struggles to hold up.  I found the original to be powerful and erotic and ultimately horrifying.  The remake doesn't succeed in the same way.  I think everyone knows the plot who is reading this or the other reviews, so I won't bore anyone with that.  The movie works as a whole, but I felt like there were huge gaps and missed opportunities.  The filmmakers also try at every turn to squeeze scares out with bursts of music, etc.  Nicolas Cage gives a solid performance, although he is not well directed here.  The screenplay also fails to truly explain the culture of the island, which we gather over time, but what surprised me is that Cage's character asks so few questions about how the island is run.  Example, when he bursts into the classroom to question the teacher and students about the missing girl, he never asks where the boys are, given the class is entirely female.  The seduction is woefully missing.  The original was erotic, given the very free sexuality of the island's inhabitants.  Many women are knocked up on this island, but there's not sex shown and the inhabitants are too stand-offish with Cage.  One would think, given the real purpose he is there, they would be more seductive with him.  They come off more as ""Children of the Corn"" than permissive and liberated.Ellen Burstyn is one of the saving graces here, as the head matriarch of the island.  She provides us with as close to an explanation as we get as to how the island runs, but we're given nothing about why she started it.  Despite the failure of the screenplay to fully explain, Burstyn brings a heft to the film.  Every word she says wrapped in a knowing mystery and she exudes a quiet menace, all the while keeping appropriate manners.  Burstyn clearly better remembers the original than the other actors or the filmmakers.  The director makes the island so bloody creepy, I kept waiting for Cage to find a canoe or something and scully the hell out of there.""The Wicker Man"" works well in places and the ending still carries a certain power, especially with those not familiar with the original.  I was entertained by it,and it's beautifully photographed, but the filmmakers lost their nerve in making a slow-build chiller.  Instead it suffers from a case of Hollywooditis.

Nicolas Cage's hysterical over-acting in this clunker of a movie is destined to become the stuff of legend, if it hasn't already. See Cage run around in a bear suit. See Cage punching elderly women in the face. See Cage let out laughably unconvincing screams as he gets tortured by bees. See Cage deliver the most embarrassing performance by a big name actor in years.This is a remake of the cult British horror film from the 1970's, and here is where the problems start. While those old horror films may have lacked high production values, they usually had profound sense of tension and dread, and often a clear message behind them. The big-budget Hollywood remakes almost always forego these aspects in favour of cheap shocks and buckets of gore. I guess this particular remake is unique in one sense, in that throws away all the intellectual and religious subtexts of the original but does NOT provide anything in the way of gore, shocks or thrills in compensation. `The Wicker Man' is the most un-horrifying, un-thrilling ""horror/thriller"" I've ever seen.Mostly, this is because there is no depth or subtlety in either the story or the characters. Cage's guffaw-inducing performance means we never really care about his character, and the women of the island are all variations of the creepy, kooky, stern religious nutter. We know exactly how the story will pan out, and most of the key plot points are telegraphed well in advance. So there's never any sense of suspense, tension, or brooding menace here. Instead, we just laugh ourselves silly as Cage cracks up, runs around aimlessly, shouts nonsense, and starts swinging his fists at anything that moves.It's hard to give this film a rating, since it depends what you're looking for. ""So bad it's good"" movie fans will love this, and I would highly recommend this take pride of place next to `Battlefield Earth' and `Plan 9 From Outer Space'.

Admittedly, the original ""The Wicker Man"" really is not a good horror movie to begin with.  In short, the original is an interesting portrayal of a paganistic society, but it is not scary, nor is it very interesting or entertaining.As undynamic as original ""The Wicker Man"" is, the remake relishes in its own futility beyond belief.  Nicholas Cage was just awful in his role as the police officer, and the rest of the cast turned in forgettable performances at best.  The liberties with the original script that the makers of the remake took are of negligible effect except to perhaps bring an already boring movie down to an even lower level of insipidity.  Aside from the poor acting, my first thought after seeing the remake was, ""what is the point?""  It simply did not make any sense to remake this movie at all.  It seems Hollywood's reasoning to remake old horror films (other than to just make money of course) is to give the film a present-day feel to it.  I don't really see the point though because what inevitably happens is that the atmosphere and mood of the original is forever lost in the remake's new age flavor.  Hence, an exercise in futility is the end result.  Such is the case with the remake of ""The Wicker Man"".In all fairness, everyone should see the original ""The Wicker Man"" at least once.

This was by far the worst movie Nicholas Cage has ever starred in, and has topped my list for being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the trailer makes this movie look amazing and full of suspense and horror, it unfortunately contains neither.Nic Cage goes in search of his lost daughter in ""The Wicker Man"" and runs afoul of an isolated community of pagans. This remake of an old Chris Lee flick has little suspense and nothing to hold the attention, as Cage literally scrambles about the countryside, thinking he has glimpsed his kid first here and then there. Some of his search becomes downright comical, especially in a scene where he is trapped overnight in a cistern. Cage's character is allergic to bees, and there's a scene involving torture-by-bees where Cage utters what is destined to become an immortal line: ""Oh God, not the bees!"" Ellen Bursteyn of ""The Exorcists"" fame is wasted here as the head of the mysterious coven, much the way veteran horror actress Alice Krige was underutilized for a similar role in ""Silent Hill"".The beginning of the movie starts out fair enough, but as the movie pushes its way down you have to make more and more leaps of faith. And then, the bad dialog comes pouring out in the final 20-30 minutes. From ""I'm going to find Rowan and what I need from you is to stay out of my f---ing way!"" to ""Ahhhh, my legs!!"" the movie gets some really silly dialog...and considering its a LaBute film, its a shame to see his talent for dialog go to pot.The big questions, however, are ""Is it better than the original?"" and ""Is it worth it?"" It is arguably worse than the original. It is vastly different and in some aspects better and other aspects much much worse. But, it isn't worth it.",2,An insult to the original but slightly hilarious to watch.,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1988,"['never', 'cared', 'original', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'found', 'slow', 'dull', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'LaBute', 'taken', 'idea', 'made', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'rant', 'feminism', 'However', 'movie', 'more', 'creator', 'feminism', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'movie', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'ever', 'starred', 'topped', 'list', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'look', 'amazing', 'full', 'suspense', 'horror', 'unfortunately', 'neither.Nic', 'Cage', 'search', 'lost', 'daughter', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'afoul', 'isolated', 'community', 'pagans', 'remake', 'old', 'Chris', 'Lee', 'flick', 'little', 'suspense', 'nothing', 'hold', 'attention', 'Cage', 'literally', 'countryside', 'thinking', 'glimpsed', 'kid', 'first', 'here', 'then', 'search', 'downright', 'comical', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'trapped', 'overnight', 'cistern', 'Cage', 'character', 'allergic', 'bees', 'scene', 'involving', 'torture-by-bees', 'where', 'Cage', 'utters', 'what', 'destined', 'become', 'immortal', 'line', 'Oh', 'God', 'not', 'bees', 'Ellen', 'Bursteyn', 'Exorcists', 'fame', 'wasted', 'here', 'head', 'mysterious', 'coven', 'much', 'way', 'veteran', 'horror', 'actress', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'was', 'underutilized', 'similar', 'role', 'Silent', 'Hill', '.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'out', 'fair', 'enough', 'movie', 'way', 'have', 'make', 'more', 'more', 'leaps', 'faith', 'then', 'bad', 'dialog', 'pouring', 'out', 'final', '20-30', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'going', 'find', 'Rowan', 'what', 'need', 'stay', 'f', '-ing', 'way', 'Ahhhh', 'legs', 'movie', 'really', 'silly', 'dialog', 'considering', 'LaBute', 'film', 'shame', 'see', 'talent', 'dialog', 'go', 'pot.The', 'big', 'questions', 'however', 'are', 'better', 'original', 'arguably', 'worse', 'original', 'vastly', 'different', 'aspects', 'better', 'other', 'aspects', 'much', 'much', 'worse', ""n't"", 'worth']",N/A

1029986,A246DPGDMYPQ0K,B000JYW5DM,J. Ocampo,"[5, 8]","1.  NOT A HORROR FILM:  This movie is not a horror movie, it is a movie about an idiotic cop (Nicholas Cage as Malus) that tries to find a missing girl on a strange, yet boring, island.2.  TEDIOUS PLOT:  Since it is not a horror movie, it needs to have something else to make it interesting.  Perhaps an intriguing mystery with questions that the viewer wants answered?Here is the mystery:Malus is a cop in California.  A girl from an island near Washington state is missing.  Malus goes to the island to find her.  Nobody on the island knows anything about her.  Malus has some strange dreams about the girl being dead, being drowned, etc. and mysteriously, he also had some visions about this girl in the past.  Neither the viewer nor Malus ever learns any interesting facts about the dissappearance.  Malus wonders around the island asking questions for almost the entire movie and people deny knowing anything about her.  Malus' conversations don't add anything to the plot, they are mostly just filler so that the movie can last the full hour and a half.  We never find out why Malus had the strange visions of the girl.  By the end of the movie, none of the questions are answered satisfactorily.  The mysteries were boring to begin with.  The fact that they are not sufficiently answered makes the viewer feel that they just lost an hour and a half.3.  AMATEURISH CONTRADICTIONS:  The movie dances between being supernatural and not being supernatural and NEVER explains the connection.  Here is what I mean.  Malus stops a car after a little girl threw a doll out the window.  After stopping the car and interacting with the girl and her mom for a few minutes, a semi truck runs into the car, causing it to burst into flames.  Despite Malus' efforts, he is unable to save the mom and the girl.  He later learns that the bodies were not found.  Sounds eerie and supernatural, eh?  This scene, though not spetacular, probably is what conveys more interest in anything in the film.  But future events never explain what happened there.  The lame conclusion of the film explains that everything was planned and not supernatural, so this scene, the only interesting thing about the movie, is never explained.  That is amateur, terrible, and unsatisfying.4.  BIZARRE, PAGAN-FEMINIST ISLAND - Perhaps the makers of the movie thought that the movie would be interesting because the island is run by a sadistic sisterhood.  The men apparently have had their tongues cut out and cannot talk.  They are submissive, meak, and pathetic beings.  The women bad mouth the male sex in general, and perhaps the name ""Malus"" is symbolic for something?  Regardless, it is not very interesting, and does not add to the movie.5.  FINAL RECOMMENDATION:  You will be better off if you never watch this movie.  Poor Nicholas Cage.  He would be better off if the world forgot that he was a part of this abomination.",1,"NOT a horror movie - rather, it is an odd, aimless dissappointment (comedy perhaps?)",1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,2897,"['1', 'NOT', 'A', 'HORROR', 'FILM', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'movie', 'idiotic', 'cop', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Malus', 'find', 'missing', 'girl', 'strange', 'yet', 'boring', 'island.2', 'TEDIOUS', 'PLOT', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'make', 'interesting', 'Perhaps', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'questions', 'viewer', 'answered', 'Here', 'mystery', 'Malus', 'cop', 'California', 'girl', 'island', 'Washington', 'state', 'missing', 'island', 'find', 'Nobody', 'island', 'anything', 'Malus', 'strange', 'dreams', 'girl', 'being', 'dead', 'being', 'drowned', 'etc', 'mysteriously', 'also', 'had', 'visions', 'girl', 'past', 'viewer', 'Malus', 'ever', 'interesting', 'facts', 'dissappearance', 'wonders', 'island', 'asking', 'questions', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'people', 'deny', 'knowing', 'anything', 'Malus', 'conversations', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'filler', 'so', 'movie', 'can', 'last', 'full', 'hour', 'half', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Malus', 'had', 'strange', 'visions', 'girl', 'end', 'movie', 'none', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'satisfactorily', 'mysteries', 'were', 'boring', 'begin', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'answered', 'viewer', 'feel', 'just', 'lost', 'hour', 'half.3', 'AMATEURISH', 'CONTRADICTIONS', 'movie', 'being', 'supernatural', 'not', 'being', 'supernatural', 'NEVER', 'connection', 'Here', 'what', 'mean', 'Malus', 'car', 'little', 'girl', 'threw', 'doll', 'out', 'window', 'stopping', 'car', 'interacting', 'girl', 'mom', 'few', 'minutes', 'semi', 'truck', 'car', 'causing', 'burst', 'flames', 'Malus', 'efforts', 'unable', 'save', 'mom', 'girl', 'later', 'bodies', 'were', 'not', 'found', 'Sounds', 'eerie', 'supernatural', 'eh', 'scene', 'not', 'spetacular', 'probably', 'what', 'more', 'interest', 'anything', 'film', 'future', 'events', 'never', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'there', 'lame', 'conclusion', 'film', 'everything', 'was', 'planned', 'not', 'supernatural', 'so', 'scene', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'never', 'explained', 'amateur', 'terrible', 'unsatisfying.4', 'BIZARRE', 'PAGAN-FEMINIST', 'ISLAND', 'Perhaps', 'makers', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'island', 'run', 'sadistic', 'sisterhood', 'men', 'apparently', 'have', 'had', 'tongues', 'cut', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'are', 'submissive', 'meak', 'pathetic', 'beings', 'women', 'bad', 'mouth', 'male', 'sex', 'general', 'perhaps', 'name', 'Malus', 'symbolic', 'something', 'Regardless', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'add', 'movie.5', 'FINAL', 'RECOMMENDATION', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'Poor', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'world', 'forgot', 'was', 'part', 'abomination']",N/A

1029989,A3OO5ZH1EFWNS4,B000JYW5DM,Joseph M. Davis,"[6, 7]","Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness.  I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist... really nervous laughter.  It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with tv's Patrick Duffy for a leg and  a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film.  I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor.  I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right.  Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue.  Instead we have horror movie clich&eacute;s, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart.  Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground ""playing Wickerman"".The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison.  In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter.  She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago.  The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found.  Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter.  He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village.  And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here.  Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry.  I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another `9-11' movie.  I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so. We now know why he keeps making crappy film after crappy film.  He was spending so much money that he needed to make 30 million dollars a year in order to maintain his lifestyle... and unfortunately the movie going public has suffered immensely for it.",1,Nicolas Cage Should Be Thrown in Jail for Creating This Trash!!!!!!,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,3135,"['Sometimes', 'laughter', 'middle', 'horror', 'film', 'signal', 'greatness', 'remember', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'audience', 're-release', 'Excorcist', 'really', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'punctuated', 'just', 'how', 'freaked', 'were', 'watching', 'voice', 'Satan', 'coming', 'out', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'case', '2006', 'remake', '1972', 'cult', 'classic', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'however', 'made', 'think', 'new', 'Wickerman', 'as', 'scary', 'South', 'Park', 'character', 'Scuzzlebut', 'friendly', 'forest', 'monster', 'tv', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'leg', 'celery', 'stalk', 'arm', 'who', 'favorite', 'hobby', 'weaving', 'wicker', 'baskets.3', 'years', 'ago', 'friend', 'mine', 'Hollywood', 'told', 'heard', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'remake', 'film', 'started', 'laughing', 'friend', 'Keith', 'got', 'mad', 'touting', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'great', 'actor', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'unfortunately', 'moviegoers', 'was', 'right', 'Gone', 'realness', 'outstanding', 'original', 'music', 'originality', 'creepiness', 'wonderfully', 'powerful', 'dialogue', 'Instead', 'have', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'affected', 'acting', 'changes', 'storyline', 'make', 'believability', 'fall', 'apart', 'many', 'countless', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'been', 'inundated', 'lately', 'feels', 'are', 'watching', '4th', 'graders', 'playground', 'playing', 'Wickerman', '.The', 'original', 'film', 'place', 'remote', 'Scottish', 'Isle', 'where', 'Scottish', 'police', 'officer', 'lured', 'there', 'find', 'missing', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Rowan', 'Morrison', 'new', 'spin', 'California', 'cop', 'Cage', 'lured', 'island', 'coast', 'Washington', 'state', 'ex-girlfriend', 'find', 'missing', 'daughter', 'photo', 'missing', 'daughter', 'exactly', 'young', 'girl', 'tried', 'save', 'fiery', 'crash', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'crash', 'still', 'part', 'girl', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'even', 'letter', 'picture', 'connection', 'completely', 'cast', 'aside', 'north', 'alone', 'help', 'ex-girlfriend', 'find', 'daughter', 'find', 'island', 'full', 'actors', 'pretending', 'be', 'descendants', 'Wiccans', 'many', 'whom', 'seem', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'call', 'backs', 'roles', 'Village', 'Village', ""n't"", 'long', 'realize', 'nothing', 'be', 'afraid', 'here', 'Not', 'even', 'cloudy', 'eyed', 'sisters', 'who', 'speak', 'unison.I', 'think', 'opportunity', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'great', 'amounts', 'money', 'film', 'often', 'great', 'expense', 'artistry', 'think', 'someone', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'touch', 'magic', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'point', 'where', 'personal', 'chef', 'set', 'preparing', 'snacks', 'needed', 'bad', 're-make', 'Wickerman', 'needed', 'yet', '9-11', 'movie', ""'m"", 'starting', 'wonder', 'Nicolas', 'changed', 'surname', 'Coppola', 'wanted', 'was', 'pleaded', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'making', 'crappy', 'film', 'crappy', 'film', 'was', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'needed', 'make', '30', 'million', 'dollars', 'year', 'order', 'maintain', 'lifestyle', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'suffered', 'immensely']",N/A

Neil LaBute directs and writes the screenplay, which is a bit surprising because his films haven't been significantly unimpressive; at least until now that is.  The cast includes the likes of Ellen Burstyn, Frances Conroy, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker and of course Nicholas Cage as the film's protagonist. All should've promptly fired their management. The music for this film is by veteran Angelo Badalamenti.  With that kind of talent you may on the surface wonder what could've gone wrong, but I can assure you that the flaws are many and they are actually quite easy to pinpoint.The Wicker Man is, in short, about a man who investigates a mysterious island after hearing about his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter.  The plot is roughly the same as the plot of the original, at least on the surface.  All of the changes, and I mean every last one of them, were made with no concern whatsoever to the elements that made the original film so compelling and unique.  Cage's character is not a virgin, nor is he notably religious in any way, which immediately eliminates the significance of the message from the original film.  If anything, Cage's character comes off as a bit misogynistic and the film's villain played by Burstyn comes off as a feminist.  Are we to believe that Cage deserved his fate for his misogyny or that the feminists are evil? Or both?  The festival of the original was of course for May Day, here it is for a completely made up holiday while the film takes place on an island off of an American coast as opposed to an island off of the coast of Scotland like the original film.  This was even PG-13 when one of the key elements to the original were the unconventional sexual overtones in the face of a devout Christian.  But let's not forget, no bewbs can be seen in American theaters by anyone under the age of 17, at least without an adult present to explain exactly what those are!  Amazing, especially with so many other gratuitous elements presented within this garbage.All in all, The Wicker Man remake was nominated for five Golden Raspberry awards and cost $35 million to make.  It made $32 million worldwide and has been as widely panned by critics as infamous stinkers likeBoat TripandDeath to Smoochy.  Thank goodness for that as we may have had an even worse sequel to worry about.  Even an actor like Nicholas Cage, who has a history of poor judgement in taking roles, should've known better than this.  It was evidently a huge waste of money to make and it will be a waste of money for you to buy.  I highly recommend the original for only two dollars more, but avoid this one at all costs unless you're searching for unintended laughter.  Cage prancing around and yelling in a bear suit is really funny, but the plot-holes alone will keep you smiling.",1,Utterly Perplexing Remake....Why?,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,3134,"['Firstly', 'wish', 'merriest', 'Beltane', 'cinephiles', 'may', 'celebrate', 'May', 'Day', 'viewing', 'wonderful', 'cult', 'classic', 'film', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'certainly', 'critique', 'faith', 'mean', 'course', 'theoriginal', '1973', 'filmand', 'not', '2006', 'remake', 'finally', 'sat', 'recently', 'hated', 'great', 'passion', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'directs', 'screenplay', 'bit', 'surprising', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'significantly', 'unimpressive', 'least', 'now', 'cast', 'likes', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'course', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'film', 'protagonist', 'should', ""'ve"", 'promptly', 'fired', 'management', 'music', 'film', 'veteran', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'kind', 'talent', 'may', 'surface', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'wrong', 'can', 'assure', 'flaws', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'easy', 'pinpoint.The', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'short', 'man', 'who', 'mysterious', 'island', 'hearing', 'ex-girlfriend', 'missing', 'daughter', 'plot', 'roughly', 'same', 'plot', 'original', 'least', 'surface', 'changes', 'mean', 'last', 'one', 'were', 'made', 'concern', 'whatsoever', 'elements', 'made', 'original', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'unique', 'Cage', 'character', 'not', 'virgin', 'notably', 'religious', 'way', 'immediately', 'significance', 'message', 'original', 'film', 'anything', 'Cage', 'character', 'off', 'bit', 'misogynistic', 'film', 'villain', 'played', 'Burstyn', 'off', 'feminist', 'Are', 'believe', 'Cage', 'deserved', 'fate', 'misogyny', 'feminists', 'are', 'evil', 'festival', 'original', 'was', 'course', 'May', 'Day', 'here', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'holiday', 'film', 'place', 'island', 'American', 'coast', 'opposed', 'island', 'coast', 'Scotland', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'PG-13', 'when', 'one', 'key', 'elements', 'original', 'were', 'unconventional', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'face', 'devout', 'Christian', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'bewbs', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'American', 'theaters', 'anyone', 'age', '17', 'least', 'adult', 'present', 'explain', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'Amazing', 'especially', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'gratuitous', 'elements', 'presented', 'garbage.All', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'remake', 'was', 'nominated', 'five', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'awards', 'cost', '35', 'million', 'make', 'made', '32', 'million', 'worldwide', 'been', 'widely', 'panned', 'critics', 'infamous', 'stinkers', 'likeBoat', 'TripandDeath', 'Smoochy', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'even', 'worse', 'sequel', 'worry', 'Even', 'actor', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'history', 'poor', 'judgement', 'taking', 'roles', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'better', 'was', 'evidently', 'huge', 'waste', 'money', 'make', 'will', 'be', 'waste', 'money', 'buy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'original', 'only', 'two', 'dollars', 'more', 'avoid', 'one', 'costs', ""'re"", 'searching', 'unintended', 'laughter', 'Cage', 'prancing', 'around', 'yelling', 'bear', 'suit', 'really', 'funny', 'plot-holes', 'alone', 'will', 'keep', 'smiling']",N/A

Therefore, I have no plans to compare this version with the original.  Instead, I'll look at this flick for what it is:  average Hollywood entertainment.  Nicolas Cage plays Edward Malus, a policeman who tries to help a young woman and her daughter only to see a terrible thing happen to them.  As he recovers from the bizarre event, he receives a letter from an old flame who says that her daughter has been kidnapped and she desperately needs his help.  Being an honest, well-meaning man, Malus takes a trip out to Summersisle, where his ex-fiance, Willow, lives.  Once there, Malus encounters a bizarre pagan cult that puts fertility and death on pedestals via annual festivals.  The cult is made up primarily of women with a few men on the island to do handiwork.  Malus believes that the cult has taken Willow's daughter for some sort of ritual and sets out to prove it.  For those unfamiliar with the conclusion of the original, the ending may be a bit of a shocker.Like others have stated, the acting is a little iffy.  Cage puts in a decent performance, but his antics sometime border on slapstick.  Leelee Sobieski has a minor role as one of the sisters in the cult.  Her performance is pretty good.  Kate Beahan portrays Willow.  She turns in one of the weaker performances in the movie.  Molly Parker is fun as Sister Rose and her twin sister.  The biggest letdown in the flick is the performance of Ellen Burstyn.  Her loopy, feminist Sister Summersisle adds a new dimension of cheesiness when she makes her appearance.With all of that said I still believe that ""The Wicker Man"" at least deserves a rental.  It isn't as terrible, in my opinion, as much of the rest of today's remakes or even originals for that matter.

It seems like an Amish version of the Amazon women and Themyscira (Wonder Woman).  The women run the island.

There are parts of this movie that appear to take itself seriously, closely followed by scenes that are so over the top that I couldn't help but laugh.  By the end, I really wasn't sure how to emotionally accept it's outcome since I wasn't perfectly sure how deliberate it's humourous moments were.  For example, the now infamously funny ""Ow, my legs!"" quote, mixed with the silly bear costume, appears to inadvertantly diffuse a very serious situation.Addmittedly, the begining of the movie seemed to promise an experience it simply wasn't capable of ultimately delivering.  Personally, I found the begining to be rather interesting because it does take itself seriously at first.  The movie's silliness starts to show itself shortly after Edward arrives at the island, but even then, I started to get a little hopeful that it would deliver a quirky mystery that might not have been too unlike David Lynch's 'Twin Peaks'.  Well, it's safe to say that it was a heavy case of wishful thinking.The movie presents an island full of obviously insincere and highly questionable characters that they might as well have worn signs around their necks that said ""I love engaging in misinformation"", that it's rather difficult to understand how Edward doesn't feel more personally threatened.  After a while, it's also a curious thought as to why he keeps seeking answers from people that would rather get punched in the face than deliver sincere responses.  Even his ex-fiance doesn't ever seem on the level, and she's the one that you would think has every reason to be.  If anything, Cage did a great job of playing an incredibly incompetent detective that got his glow in the dark badge in a box of fruit loops.  However, to be fair, the movie never really tries to play him off as a highly decorated cop, or even anything close to it.If this movie was trying to play serious, it's inadvertant humor is just about unforgiveable.  As odd as this might sound, it actually might make for a better watch as a dark comedy.I also must add that, in retrospect, the plot was so elaborate that it made me wonder what the island's inhabitants would have done if Edward simply didn't feel like going to the island.  It just seemed like a lot of work, and the crossing of many fingers, for everything to pan out as it did.

Allow me to add a dissenting opinion!  While this movie is obviously different than the original and while the message of it is obviously different and obscured, I felt that it was a good movie nonetheless and raised some interesting questions which the original did not.

It features a conflict between a devoutly Christian (stereotypically Christian:  self-righteous, prudish, and uptight) policeman and a pagan island colony (stereotypically pagan in that the people revel in debauchery and nudity).  The original of course features the infamous human sacrifice scene (which is also present in this movie), in which the devout Christian is martyred, burned alive in a giant man made of wood (the ""wicker man"") along with several animals, in order to appease the gods and bring about a better harvest.  Another difference between the original and this remake is that the original was a musical (and the music was uniformly awful!) giving it a quality of utter absurdity and hilarity, as the pagan islanders would burst out into song and dance (bad song too!) at the most inopportune places.  This remake obviously lacks this quality and tries to take itself seriously, though it is funny for another reason.  However, unlike the original, in which the conflict between Christianity and paganism is salient, in this remake the policeman (played by Nicolas Cage) is not obviously Christian (he never even brings up Christianity and the only real reference to Christianity in the entire movie that I noticed is the appearance of a statue of Christ underwater during one of the scenes in the movie).  However, this movie raises other interesting issues (and in fact in certain respects is so politically incorrect that it is difficult to believe it was actually made in this day and age; refreshingly politically incorrect!).  For one thing, the pagan society that the policeman encounters is entirely run by women; the men are largely mutes and dumb workers reminiscent of the drones in a beehive (indeed the theme of bees is to play a central role in this movie).  Even the central character of Lord Summersisle is replaced in this movie by Lady Summersisle (and her comments about men and the character of modern society are typical of what one would expect from a modern day radical feminist!).  Oddly, this movie shows the evil nature of a matriarchy (illustrating the fact that a matriarchy is just as prone to cruelty and arbitrariness as any patriarchy).  The amazon women in the movie maliciously undermine the efforts of the policeman, trick him, and then brutally torture and murder him.  Certainly this is nothing to please either the excessively squeamish or the ultra-politically correct.  The movie also does not bode very well for pagans generally.  In fact, the implication seems to be that pagans are equally prone to diabolical activities and that they do indeed engage in human sacrifice.  Throughout history, many primitive cultures have engaged in human sacrifice to appease the gods and bring about a better harvest.  For example, Caesar remarked that the druids were cannibals (though the veracity of his remarks remains disputed), and of course the Aztecs notoriously sacrificed innocents to appease their gods.  In his book _The Golden Bough_, anthropologist James Frazer explains how in traditional society the motif of the ""killing of the king"" (regicide) played a central role in the culture.  And there are obvious parallels to Christ himself who was ""sacrificed"" so that we all may have eternal life.  (Some of these points are less salient in the remake than the original, but they are still present.)  Most sane modern people agree that human sacrifice is a barbaric remnant of the past, but chances are good that they cannot provide a reason as to why this is so.  Presumptuous moderns are too quick to judge the ancients who though obviously lacking in electricity and running water nevertheless had a complicated society and culture and understood certain facts about the rhythms of nature which are lost to us today.The movie begins with Nicolas Cage encountering two motorists on the highway and attempting to save them, only to find that the car has exploded.  Cage watches in horror as the little girl in the car is engulfed in the flames (eerie foreboding of things to come later).  This traumatic experience is to completely shatter his nerves, and he will experience hallucinations and confusion resulting from it throughout most of the movie.  Cage then receives a letter from his former girlfriend Willow, who is now living on Summersisle (somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, changed from the location outside of Scotland in the original), regarding her missing daughter Rowan.  Cage journeys to Summersisle by plane to try to find Rowan.  Once there however, he discovers that the people are oddly reticent and frequently deny his requests for information.  Further, the island is ruled entirely by women with the men serving as dumb working drones.  When Cage visits the local school, he discovers that the children are learning about phallic symbols!  The children and their teacher both lie to him.  Later, Cage meets with Lady Summersisle, the matriarch of the entire island.  She expounds upon her pagan beliefs, notes the alleged inferiority of males, and shows him the bees (which Cage is allergic to).  Then, begins a parade in which the denizens of the island dress up in masks and Cage is forced to follow them dressed up as a bear.  The movie involves the ultimate betrayal and ends of course with the human sacrifice - being burned alive in the wicker man, brutally done.I enjoyed this movie and although it was obviously different from the original I thought it was nevertheless good in its own right.  Obviously it will be offensive to some people, particularly regarding its comments on feminism.  However, in my understanding of things this is a plus and highly refreshing in this day and age of excessive political correctness.  Despite these facts though, the movie is still pretty good and worth watching anyway.",5,The Absurdity of Pagan Human Sacrifice!,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,6706,"['_The', 'Wicker', 'Man_', '2006',

Any remake was always bound to pale, but this shallow, Disneyfied sham is actually too bad to be true. Anthony Shaffer's original story has been gutted of all the sub texts and research that made the original so fascinating. Instead, we have a lazily written, lethargically directed and appallingly acted mess of a movie which throws out any sense of structure and goes for style over content. The endless references to other films like Don't Look Now (always a sign of a director stuck for original ideas) are meaningless and confusing. It is as if Writer/Director Neal La Bute thought ""Oh, this is just a horror film. I'll toss any old cliches together"". His invention of a matriarchal pagan society based on the Apis Genus (women in charge, men as mute drones)is laughable (and I speak as a practising Pagan). A typical ill informed notion of a so called ""paganism"" by someone who obviously knows nothing of the culture. And why would should a society use a Wicker ""Man"" as their method of sacrifice? Oh, sorry, it is to justify hanging onto that title and cashing in on the reputation of the original.Unlike Anthony Schaffer, La Bute is evidently too lazy to research genuine paganism and its components. He just makes it up as he goes along. Attempting to transplant the story to the United States also fails to come off. It just does not feel right in that setting and, unlike the Hebredian community of the original, the ""Summersisle"" (sic) community in this movies looks ludicrous and contrived with no obvious dynamic to justify its continuation.Message to those who have not seen the original - see it and enjoy original filmaking at its best.

1030031,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000JYW5DM,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[4, 6]","The original Wicker Man, a cult British horror classic from the early seventies, hasn't aged well, and, in a certain light, looks - dare I even suggest it - a bit like a spoof of something else. On the other hand, it's filmed and acted with such a lack of pretension and such simple elegance that it ultimately ends up being deeply moving and very affecting.Since this 2006 remake is the exact and polar opposite of the original, let's dispense with any comparison right now, and concentrate on what we have in front of us with the new version. Although, since the new version is so horrifyingly dreadful, you might just want to skip it altogether: for all its flaws the original movie is much, much better.So basically, the 2006 Wicker Man typecasts Nicolas ""Scary Hair Plugs"" Cage as a traumatized ex-cop who departs California for the mysterious commune of Summersisle, when he receives a letter from his ex-fiancee Willow asking for his help in locating her missing daughter Rowan. Cue cult members, witchcraft, murder and... ...fish costumes?Anyway, Cage plays himself and the rest of the cast sort of mumble their way through an embarrassing script. Poor Ellen Burstyn must have needed the money: as Sister Summersisle her role promised me a reprieve from the Search-Yell-Search antics of Nicolas Cageennegger, but sadly, she's as bad as the rest of the cast. Leelee Sobieski and Diane Delano are unwatchable and the rest of the cast is composed of stock C-List horror movie ""actors"".The script is wholly charmless, but Neil LaBute's direction does provide one comparatively small plus point: Summersisle and its environs and contents do look suitably idyllic.Still, if idyllic scenery is what you're after, you'd be better off with a subscription to National Geographic: ""Wicker Man"" is a complete failure as a horror movie. It runs along similar lines to ""Silent Hill"" - missing daughter, creepy locale, cult-member natives - and, for all its many flaws, ""Silent Hill"" is a far better movie.Avoid this like the plague!",1,Thicker Wicker,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2026,"['original', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'cult', 'British', 'horror', 'classic', 'early', 'seventies', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'certain', 'light', 'dare', 'even', 'suggest', 'bit', 'spoof', 'something', 'else', 'other', 'hand', 'filmed', 'acted', 'lack', 'pretension', 'such', 'simple', 'elegance', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'deeply', 'moving', 'very', 'affecting.Since', '2006', 'remake', 'exact', 'polar', 'opposite', 'original', 'let', 'dispense', 'comparison', 'right', 'now', 'concentrate', 'what', 'have', 'front', 'new', 'version', 'new', 'version', 'so', 'horrifyingly', 'dreadful', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'skip', 'altogether', 'flaws', 'original', 'movie', 'much', 'much', 'better.So', 'basically', '2006', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'Nicolas', 'Scary', 'Hair', 'Plugs', 'Cage', 'traumatized', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'California', 'mysterious', 'commune', 'Summersisle', 'when', 'letter', 'ex-fiancee', 'Willow', 'asking', 'help', 'locating', 'missing', 'daughter', 'Rowan', 'Cue', 'cult', 'members', 'witchcraft', 'murder', 'fish', 'costumes', 'Anyway', 'Cage', 'rest', 'cast', 'sort', 'mumble', 'way', 'embarrassing', 'script', 'Poor', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'must', 'have', 'needed', 'money', 'Sister', 'Summersisle', 'role', 'promised', 'reprieve', 'Search-Yell-Search', 'antics', 'Nicolas', 'Cageennegger', 'sadly', 'as', 'bad', 'rest', 'cast', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Diane', 'Delano', 'are', 'unwatchable', 'rest', 'cast', 'composed', 'stock', 'C-List', 'horror', 'movie', 'actors', '.The', 'script', 'wholly', 'charmless', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'direction', 'provide', 'one', 'comparatively', 'small', 'point', 'Summersisle', 'environs', 'contents', 'do', 'look', 'suitably', 'idyllic.Still', 'idyllic', 'scenery', 'what', ""'re"", ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'subscription', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'complete', 'failure', 'horror', 'movie', 'similar', 'lines', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'missing', 'daughter', 'creepy', 'locale', 'cult-member', 'natives', 'many', 'flaws', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'far', 'better', 'movie.Avoid', 'plague']",N/A

1030033,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000JYW5DM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 9]","The Wicker Man (Neil LaBute, 2006)I have come to the conclusion that Nicolas Cage is a man with impeccable taste. First, obsessed with Begotten, he tabs Elias Merhige to direct Shadow of the Vampire. Then, when he wants to jump on the horror-film-remakes bandwagon, he chooses a brilliant, literate movie that easily ranks among the finest ever made.Unfortunately, however, taste does not necessarily translate into talent. ""Desecration"" is far too tame a word to use for what Messrs. Cage and LaBute have done with this Wicker Man remake. I have seen a good number of the recent horror-film remakes, and I have seen a lot of them that were awful. The Wicker Man is by far the worst of the lot.The story remains the same: a mainland detective, Edward Malus (Cage) gets a frantic letter from one of the residents of the secluded private island Summerisle-- excuse me, SummersIsle-- stating that one of the island's young girls is missing. When he gets there, he finds an island out of time, as it were, one where the inhabitants live by their own laws. Malus fights to impose the outside world's system on theirs with increasing desperation as he tries to find the child, whom no one on the island admits even exists (save Malus' old girlfriend Willow (Chopper's Kate Beahan), the child's mother).What makes the original movie great is the detail Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer paid to the religion and customs of Summerisle, and how well Edward Woodward's Sgt. Howie fits into its life there-- as a strict Catholic, he understands the idea of fervent worship, and the religion presented there is a powerful temptation for him. (To go any farther with this analogy would constitute a spoiler for the original movie-- which, if you haven't seen, you must.) Everything is consistent down to the last detail, and it all fits together-- when you get to the end of the film, you realize that all that ""gratuitous"" shocking material was actually an integral part of the plot. None of this can be said for the remake. LaBute (who also wrote this new adaptation) replaces Howie's faith with an allergy to bees. Really. He also monkeys with the mechanics of the kid in order to, presumably, give Malus a more personal reason for trying to find the kid, and in doing so unravels a vast portion of the tapestry that holds the entire movie together-- replacing it with something so slapdash it seems they didn't even notice everything was falling apart until they were shooting, and simply had Ellen Burstyn improvise a line or two.Then there's the matter of Nicolas Cage's acting. Perhaps the less said about it the better, but if we was trying to convey the same intensity and duty of Sgt. Howie, he badly missed the mark. Howie's expressions of horror during the climax of the original film ring so true that it's hard to imagine a viewer questioning that, at the very least, Edward Woodward was so into the role that he really felt the disgust and despair in the exhortations he made to his God to save him. Cage's Malus, on the other hand, is laughably bad. It doesn't help that the script breaks so very, very many rules of writing decent dialogue (for the love of god, man, ""ow, my legs!"" was about the worst line of dialogue, given its placement, I've heard since Night of the Lepus), and that Cage overacts every one. In contrast, Ellen Burstyn's Lady SummersIsle (and the addition of that ""s"" may actually be the most annoying detail in the entire movie) has none of the vitality and charm Christopher Lee brought to the role of Lord Summerisle; she seemed as if she were trying to reprise some odd combination of Judi Dench's character in As Time Goes By and any given screen incarnation of Jeeves. It's absolutely pathetic, and just when Burstyn's career was undergoing a well-deserved revival.As for all that not-so-gratuitous explicitness, kiss it goodbye. The schoolroom scene, one of the more shocking in the entire canon of seventies film, does exist here, but as a shadow of its former self. I think LaBute stuck it in for the sole purpose of appeasing the people who were going to compare this one to the original. If so, well, frying pan, meet fire-- it would have been better without the scene altogether, and I say that as a blind, drooling devotee of Molly Parker, who plays the schoolmistress here (and would otherwise get so little screen time in the movie as to not really deserve an acting credit.) (Oh, and what was with the twin thing?

1030035,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,B000JYW5DM,Ronald L. Russell,"[4, 5]","The 2006 remake of ""The Wicker Man"" held so much promise, and somehow failed to realize its full potential. I had no problem with the actors or their performances, they did the best they could with the material they had. The cinematography and music were very good as well, and for many viewers, these areas are distinct improvements, as not everyone liked the celtic folk-pagan tunes in the original.I did have significant problems with the overall writing, and especially with the thematic changes made. I had the distinct feeling that whoever wrote the script for the newer version had watched the 1973 original, but somehow didn't understand what it had really been about.Nicholas Cage is Officer Malus, who is recovering from a traumatic experience involving the deaths of a woman and child he had stopped months before. He receives a letter from Willow, his former fiance, who informs him that she is living on Summersisle, an island off the coast of Washington, and that her child Rowan (later revealed to be his also), has disappeared and in danger.The original film had been a thoughtful contrast/comparison between two different belief systems, the ultra-conservative form of Christianity as practiced by Sgt. Howie, and the sexually unrepressed paganism of the people living on Summerisle. Viewers could not help but notice how seeming ""differences"" between the Pagan and Christian beliefs and sacrements, were, upon closer examination, quite similar. Indeed, Sgt Howie even had opportunity to debate theology with some of the islanders, including Christopher Lee (Saruman in ""Lord Of The Rings""), who offered reasonable explanations for believing as they did. The 1973 film portrayed the pagans as a vibrant community offering equality for both genders, and celebrating the joys of sexuality in a very healthy manner. Most people would have enjoyed living among the pagans of the 1973 film.The newer film misses all these points entirely, reducing the whole story to something like ""matriarchal pagans lure men to their deaths"". The 2006 film casts their pagan society as a distinctly two-class system, with women enjoying all power and privelege, while men are reduced to mute workhorses who exist for the purpose of performing heavy labor and for ""breeding"", with no thought of sex as anything which might be enjoyable for its own sake. No male member of the pagan society is given even one line in the newer film. Beekeeping is the basis of the islanders economy, and the island society is modeled after the hive, with Ellen Burstyn as the ""Queen"". Theological debate between Nicholas Cage and the islanders is reduced to a few evasive answers to questions he asks in his search for Rowan.Oddly, the change in the tone of the movie comes about with the alteration of just a few key scenes. Unfortunately, these alterations effectively ruin the movie, and make what could be a thoughtful thriller into an uninspired and unmoving sequence of scenes without a strong theme tying them together. Many of the other scenes from the rest of the movie are shot identically to the way they had been 33 years ago, including masked villagers peeking over a wall at Cage, a young girl hiding in a closet, falling out and pretending to be dead when he opens the door, and Rowan herself leading Malus through the woods to his appointment with the Wicker Man.In sum, the changes made in the 2006 version of ""The Wicker Man"" result in a plot with no real theme to develop, and therefore, a movie which doesn't satisfy, even if one has not seen the original. If one HAS seen the original, the 2006 film suffers greatly from comparison.",2,Flawed remake of much-better 1973 original,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3632,"['2006', 'remake', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'held', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'somehow', 'failed', 'realize', 'full', 'potential', 'had', 'problem', 'actors', 'performances', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'material', 'had', 'cinematography', 'music', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'many', 'viewers', 'areas', 'are', 'distinct', 'improvements', 'not', 'everyone', 'liked', 'celtic', 'folk-pagan', 'tunes', 'original.I', 'did', 'have', 'significant', 'problems', 'overall', 'writing', 'especially', 'thematic', 'changes', 'made', 'had', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'script', 'newer', 'version', 'had', 'watched', '1973', 'original', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'had', 'really', 'been', 'about.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Officer', 'Malus', 'who', 'recovering', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'involving', 'deaths', 'woman', 'child', 'had', 'stopped', 'months', 'letter', 'Willow', 'former', 'fiance', 'who', 'living', 'Summersisle', 'island', 'coast', 'Washington', 'child', 'Rowan', 'later', 'revealed', 'be', 'also', 'disappeared', 'danger.The', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'thoughtful', 'contrast/comparison', 'two', 'different', 'belief', 'systems', 'ultra-conservative', 'form', 'Christianity', 'practiced', 'Sgt', 'Howie', 'sexually', 'unrepressed', 'paganism', 'people', 'living', 'Summerisle', 'Viewers', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'how', 'seeming', 'differences', 'Pagan', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'sacrements', 'were', 'closer', 'examination', 'quite', 'similar', 'Indeed', 'Sgt', 'Howie', 'even', 'had', 'opportunity', 'debate', 'theology', 'islanders', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Saruman', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'who', 'offered', 'reasonable', 'explanations', 'believing', 'did', '1973', 'film', 'portrayed', 'pagans', 'vibrant', 'community', 'offering', 'equality', 'genders', 'celebrating', 'joys', 'sexuality', 'very', 'healthy', 'manner', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'living', 'pagans', '1973', 'film.The', 'newer', 'film', 'points', 'entirely', 'reducing', 'whole', 'story', 'something', 'matriarchal', 'pagans', 'lure', 'men', 'deaths', '2006', 'film', 'casts', 'pagan', 'society', 'distinctly', 'two-class', 'system', 'women', 'enjoying', 'power', 'privelege', 'men', 'are', 'reduced', 'mute', 'workhorses', 'who', 'exist', 'purpose', 'performing', 'heavy', 'labor', 'breeding', 'thought', 'sex', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'sake', 'male', 'member', 'pagan', 'society', 'given', 'even', 'one', 'line', 'newer', 'film', 'Beekeeping', 'basis', 'islanders', 'economy', 'island', 'society', 'modeled', 'hive', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Queen', 'Theological', 'debate', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'islanders', 'reduced', 'few', 'evasive', 'answers', 'questions', 'search', 'Rowan.Oddly', 'change', 'tone', 'movie', 'alteration', 'just', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'alterations', 'effectively', 'ruin', 'movie', 'make', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'thriller', 'uninspired', 'unmoving', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'strong', 'theme', 'tying', 'together', 'Many', 'other', 'scenes', 'rest', 'movie', 'are', 'shot', 'identically', 'way', 'had', 'been', '33', 'years', 'ago', 'including', 'masked', 'villagers', 'peeking', 'wall', 'Cage', 'young', 'girl', 'hiding', 'closet', 'falling', 'out', 'pretending', 'be', 'dead', 'when', 'door', 'Rowan', 'leading', 'woods', 'appointment', 'Wicker', 'Man.In', 'sum', 'changes', 'made', '2006', 'version', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'result', 'plot', 'real', 'theme', 'develop', 'therefore', 'movie', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'even', 'one', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'one', 'HAS', 'seen', 'original', '2006', 'film', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'comparison']",N/A

The plot is completely convoluted and twisted that you don't even know what is going on after 20 minutes. What was the whole car crash scene about? I still don't really know.*******SPOILER WARNING*************Normally, I would be all excited about a movie about a colony based on a heirarchy of female leaders with some odd wiccan, Goddess belief system, where men are used to ""Breed"". I liked this reverse view on society-since most of the world still believes that women should be subservient to men (which makes me mad)...but, the whole sacrificial thing ruined the film for me. The ending was one of the WORST movie endings that I have EVER seen in my whole life. As a viewer we spend an hour and a half watching Nicholas Cage run absent-mindedly around an island searching for a daughter he has never known. When he finally finds the girl you feel a sense of relief-Oh, she's alive! It's a miracle! You want him to get away with her and be safe and maybe kill a few of the feminazi colony members...but, alas, that doesn't happen. Instead, we have to watch as Nicholas Cage's legs are broken and bees are poured onto his head. Was anyone else creeped out at the burning alive scene?

I think the film is very well made and it stands on its own -- I wouldn't compare it to the original from a few decades ago. The story is about a missing child on an island up in the Pacific Northwest. The island is controlled by a weird cult which is lead/directed by women -- man other than Nic Cage don't speak in this film. Of course, if you know the ending, then some of the interesting surprises will be known and then this flick may not be as interesting. My wife liked the film very much and she would probably give it five stars.Well, the scenery and photography is really good, and also the mood was well captured. Acting is also pretty good and Cage comes across believable. Is this movie worth watching? Yeah, I think so and I didn't think that my few bucks or my time were waisted. True, my expectations were a little higher than the actual delivery, as especially toward the end the film lost a bit of its quality and it became almost cheesy. It's not a horror movie and I didn't have any goosebumps, but again the scenery and photography were very good.

1030044,ANLEL1J3ZS8YP,B000JYW5DM,Shiloh Kremer,"[4, 8]","This is a very chilling remake of the original ""The Wicker Man"" movie clasic. Nicolas Cage plays Edward Malus, a police officer who goes to Summersisle, which is a private island governed by women. Ellen Burstyn plays sister Summerisle, the leader. Malus (Cage) is searching for a missing little girl, but, the residents of Summersisle are less than cooperative.The men don't speak. In several scenes, only the little girls are in classrooms. There are no little boys on the island. Ellen Burstyn is very convincing in her role as sister Summersisle. In fact, the acting is above average in this movie. There are a few holes in the movie. For instance, it was never revealed what exactly happened to the pilot. Further, it was never revealed if the women kill baby boys at birth.However, this film will leave viewers shocked with its very intense ending. The DVD has bonus features including an alternate ending which was not shown in theatres. Now, the alternate ending is very graphic and difficult to watch. After I saw the alternate ending, I couldn't sleep that night.This movie isn't scary. It is more of a suspense thriller about a pagan ritualistic society of women who generally dislike men. Sister Summersisle is sneaky, cold, and intelligent all at once. The mostly female cast did an outstanding job portraying disdane towards the outside world.Don't expect a scary movie. Expect a gothic thriller that focuses on female pagan rituals who dominate men. Neil Labute writes and directs this movie. Some of the costars include Leelee Sobieski and Kate Beahan.This movie may be one of the creepiest movies I have seen in years because it is believable.  Don't let the other negative reviews fool you.Suspense thrillers can be shocking if they are directed properly with good actors who have realistic storylines.Because of Nicolas Cage & Ellen Burstyn, I gave this movie a 4 star rating.",4,Horrific pagan ritual movie starring Ellen Burstyn!,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,1895,"['very', 'chilling', 'remake', 'original', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'movie', 'clasic', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Edward', 'Malus', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'Summersisle', 'private', 'island', 'governed', 'women', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'sister', 'Summerisle', 'leader', 'Malus', 'Cage', 'searching', 'missing', 'little', 'girl', 'residents', 'Summersisle', 'are', 'less', 'cooperative.The', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'several', 'scenes', 'only', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'classrooms', 'are', 'little', 'boys', 'island', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'sister', 'Summersisle', 'fact', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'movie', 'instance', 'was', 'never', 'revealed', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'pilot', 'Further', 'was', 'never', 'revealed', 'women', 'kill', 'baby', 'boys', 'birth.However', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'shocked', 'very', 'intense', 'ending', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'theatres', 'Now', 'alternate', 'ending', 'very', 'graphic', 'difficult', 'watch', 'saw', 'alternate', 'ending', 'could', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'night.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'scary', 'more', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'pagan', 'ritualistic', 'society', 'women', 'who', 'generally', 'dislike', 'men', 'Sister', 'Summersisle', 'sneaky', 'cold', 'intelligent', 'once', 'mostly', 'female', 'cast', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'disdane', 'outside', 'world.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'scary', 'movie', 'Expect', 'gothic', 'thriller', 'female', 'pagan', 'rituals', 'who', 'dominate', 'men', 'Neil', 'Labute', 'movie', 'costars', 'include', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Kate', 'Beahan.This', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'creepiest', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'believable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'negative', 'reviews', 'fool', 'you.Suspense', 'thrillers', 'can', 'be', 'shocking', 'are', 'directed', 'properly', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'realistic', 'storylines.Because', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

Nicolas Cage, the one-time would-be Superman (as we ladies would've prefered), is at his exasperated best in a role that can only be described as Golden Globes-worthy.I always thought the original was overrated and just kind of boring.  Not so with the taut direction of Neil Labute in the new one.  I must say, I was apalled when I realized LaBute was the director behind this movie.  Due the rapant misogyny in his ealier pieces like ""Nurse Betty"" I, a long-time neo-feminist, have steadfastly avoided most of his output.  I say most because of ""The Wicker Man"" which has haunted me for some time.I hate to give anything away in a suspenseful movie full of twists and turns.  Basic premise:  Nic Cage is contacted by an old flame who is a single mom; her child is missing.  Cage doesn't think twice about visiting the strange commune she lives on in order to help her find the child.  While I am not lucky enough to be a mother myself, I dream of birthing children so this type of story really hit home.  You could really feel the agony of this woman's lost daughter, especially if you are a parent or have extensive childcare experience (like me!).What a supporting cast.  Ellen Burstyn is of course predictably fantastic as the ""den-mother"" on this communal island.  I don't recognize many of the other actors, but there are some seldom seen gems in this one.  Above all perhaps is the tremendous supporting turn from Leelee Sobieski.  I thought she had dropped out of acting almost!  Here she is simultaneously heartbreaking and terrifying.

1030049,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000JYW5DM,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[7, 10]","I was really surprised to like this movie so much.  It didn't seem like a good choice for a remake, and the trailers made it look like it was going to be a possibly-too-slick, mainstream-ized, and frankly dumb, version of the original.  Instead I found the actual movie to be a smart, well-crafted horror thriller.  While it wouldn't make my Top Ten for 2006 by any means, I thought (although I'm clearly in the minority here, judging by its overall low rating) it was a very succsessful remake.I thought it was a succsessful remake largly because of this: it does something different with the original material.  If you're going to remake something, I think you should take some different paths so the two versions are distinct from one another.  The 1973 original focused on a Christianity vs. evil paganism theme; today paganism isn't viewed with nearly the same distrust and misconceptions as it was decades ago, and in this remake has been replaced with a strange new religion apparantly created just for the movie.  The Christianity element has been eliminated altogether for whatever reason; I wouldn't have minded if it had stayed but that wasn't the way they decided to go.The rest of the premise is the same as the original - Nicolas Cage is a policeman drawn to the island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a little girl on the island.  Edward Woodward made that role in the original his own, and here Cage plays the role in a totally different manner; even the name of the character has been changed.  Once on the island, Cage finds the locals uncooperative to the point of denying the little girl ever even existed.  The island is ruled over by the outwardly benign Sister Summerisle, played by Ellen Burstyn - another change: in the original it was Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee.  In any remake of a movie that featured Lee, the recasting of his character is going to be tricky (I'm not counting Dracula movies; there have been so many different incarnations of the Count over the last hundred years that they don't really count as remakes of any previous film, and haven't for a long time) and in this case they went so far in differentiating the roles as to change gender.  Which ends up a good thing, with having a 'queen bee' type of figure tying right into the mythology of the island and its religion.  The islanders are fixated on bees, the creature they keep for harvesting honey, although I suppose the question of who's really keeping who could be argued, if you want to read between the lines.  The bee motif plays out in the movie in ways alternately subtle and overt, and made for a fascinating mythology and backdrop.  The officer's investigations lead him to quickly conclude that the girl did indeed exist, and that a large part of the island is covering up not only her death but her life as well.  Cut off from the outside world in a society with no link to the mainland, he attempts to find out what happened, and whether she may even still be among the living.  With performances that are far better than they've been given credit for, and a nice tight tension throughout, I give this one a strong recommendation.  8/10",4,Another Under-Appreciated One - A Fine Horror Thriller,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3182,"['was', 'really', 'surprised', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'good', 'choice', 'remake', 'trailers', 'made', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'possibly-too-slick', 'mainstream-ized', 'frankly', 'dumb', 'version', 'original', 'Instead', 'found', 'actual', 'movie', 'be', 'smart', 'well-crafted', 'horror', 'thriller', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'Top', 'Ten', '2006', 'means', 'thought', ""'m"", 'clearly', 'minority', 'here', 'judging', 'overall', 'low', 'rating', 'was', 'very', 'succsessful', 'remake.I', 'thought', 'was', 'succsessful', 'remake', 'largly', 'something', 'different', 'original', 'material', ""'re"", 'going', 'remake', 'something', 'think', 'should', 'take', 'different', 'paths', 'two', 'versions', 'are', 'distinct', 'one', '1973', 'original', 'focused', 'Christianity', 'vs.', 'evil', 'paganism', 'theme', 'today', 'paganism', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'nearly', 'same', 'distrust', 'misconceptions', 'was', 'decades', 'ago', 'remake', 'been', 'replaced', 'strange', 'new', 'religion', 'apparantly', 'created', 'just', 'movie', 'Christianity', 'element', 'been', 'eliminated', 'altogether', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'had', 'stayed', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'decided', 'go.The', 'rest', 'premise', 'same', 'original', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'policeman', 'drawn', 'island', 'Summerisle', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'little', 'girl', 'island', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'made', 'role', 'original', 'own', 'here', 'Cage', 'role', 'totally', 'different', 'manner', 'even', 'name', 'character', 'been', 'changed', 'Once', 'island', 'Cage', 'locals', 'uncooperative', 'point', 'denying', 'little', 'girl', 'ever', 'even', 'existed', 'island', 'ruled', 'outwardly', 'benign', 'Sister', 'Summerisle', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'change', 'original', 'was', 'Lord', 'Summerisle', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'remake', 'movie', 'featured', 'Lee', 'recasting', 'character', 'going', 'be', 'tricky', ""'m"", 'not', 'counting', 'Dracula', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'incarnations', 'Count', 'last', 'hundred', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'remakes', 'previous', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'long', 'time', 'case', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'differentiating', 'roles', 'change', 'gender', 'up', 'good', 'thing', 'having', ""'queen"", 'bee', 'type', 'figure', 'tying', 'right', 'mythology', 'island', 'religion', 'islanders', 'are', 'fixated', 'bees', 'creature', 'keep', 'harvesting', 'honey', 'suppose', 'question', 'who', 'really', 'keeping', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'want', 'read', 'lines', 'bee', 'motif', 'out', 'movie', 'ways', 'alternately', 'subtle', 'overt', 'made', 'fascinating', 'mythology', 'backdrop', 'officer', 'investigations', 'lead', 'quickly', 'conclude', 'girl', 'did', 'indeed', 'exist', 'large', 'part', 'island', 'covering', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'death', 'life', 'well', 'Cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'society', 'link', 'mainland', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'may', 'even', 'still', 'be', 'living', 'performances', 'are', 'far', 'better', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'nice', 'tight', 'tension', 'give', 'one', 'strong', 'recommendation', '8/10']",N/A

However, the bodies of the woman and small girl inside the car are inexplicably never found. Weird.Then he gets a letter with fantastic calligraphy from his former fiancee, Willow (did he check out the handwriting first? - no) asking for his help on Summersisle to find her missing daughter, who every one else there says is not missing. Instead of saying forget it, I'm not going anywhere, Edward jumps to it. A co-worker asks him where Summersisle is, and Edward replies that it is in the Northeast. He got a little mixed up there as it's an isle off Washington state (which is in the NW).He's greeted with disdain in Summersisle, which is packed with women (mostly pregnant), small girls, and a few untalkative men. Willow, a very weird-faced, collagen-injected woman is glad to see him, but has a lot of trouble expressing herself. She mostly says, ""Ummm"" and stutters a lot. This frustrates Edward almost  as much as it annoys the audience. He hollers at her to spit it out, but this just makes her stutter more.Poor Edward is so wrapped up in ""doing the right thing"" and redeeming himself for the death of the girl in the car, that he can't see what's in front of his face. He thinks he's smarter than the rest of these bee-keepers (last year was a bad year for honey) and shows his police badge around, which doesn't impress anybody. He searches for the little girl in some pretty weird places - like underwater - but has no luck despite thinking he actually sees her there.This guy's got problems he needs to sort out.

And countless reasons that American cinema will totally screw up an original foreign film.In the original film, Edward Woodward is a devout Christian police officer searching for a missing girl on a creepy island of pagans.  He eventually falls into their hands and dies a martyr's death, holding onto his faith to the end.In this version...well...Americans are squeamish when it comes to the whole religion thing.  So Nic Cage can't have any beliefs of his own.  And Americans would also have a tough time reconciling themselves to a tragic ending for such a pious man.  So Nic Cage is...a jerk.  A moron.  A woman-beater.Of course, I don't believe any of this.

That should tell you how hard filmmakers were trying to convince potential video renters that this movie is scarier than it actually is.The Wicker Man of 2006 is, of course, a remake of The Wicker Man of 1973, proving once again that the word ""remake"" should be forcibly excised from the Hollywood lexicon. Unfortunately, director Neil LaBute got his hands on this project and emasculated a classic.The two lead characters, played with stunning conviction by Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward in the original, are reprised by Ellen Burstyn and Nicholas Cage, and neither has the screen presence to carry it off. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus investigating a missing child, is bumbling and inefficient, acting without authority, and plagued with self-doubt and inexplicable hallucinations. Burstyn, as the spiritual leader of the remote island community (now removed from the coast of England to the Puget Sound) is treacly instead of imposing. The simple pagan faith of Summerisle in 1973 has been replaced with a hard-to-swallow matriarchy on Summersisle in 2006 (they added an ""s"" in the middle to help differentiate between them), with the beautiful simplicity of the original island's customs stripped away entirely. The islanders themselves have changed into sexist and mean-spirited drones who take pleasure in the pain of others.This movie is devoid of everything that made the original outstanding.

1030055,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000JYW5DM,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Neil LaBute's remake of ""The Wicker Man"" is possibly the worst film of the decade, probably worse than ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Epic Movie,"" considering that the former film actually stars two Oscar winners, Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn (the latter with strangest make-up on the face). And their acting is very disappointing.What you see here is beautiful landscapes and an utterly incoherent story about a missing girl and a police officer. The truths are obvious from the moment when Nicolas Cage's policeman landed on a remote, privately owned island off the coast, but our dim-witted hero never knows the right thing to do. Instead he does many silly things and perhaps his ""bear"" costume part would be the worst. But there are more to come before and after that, as many other reviewers rightly pointed out.But what made me really sad is the presence of Leelee Sobieski as Sister Honey. I just couldn't believe what I am seeing during her ""brawl"" scene and its terrible results. If director wanted to make a point about war between men and women, he surely made it with dreadful portrayal of Sister here, or any other terribly-acted Sisters and heavy-handed metaphor of bees.Please. We don't need any more ""re-imagined"" version of classic films. Also, British films should be left untouched if you don't have a more suitable idea to update them.

1030056,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000JYW5DM,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 4]","There are several points during THE WICKER MAN that Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) has a pained look of exasperation on his face as he vainly searches to find a missing child, Rowan Woodward (Erika-Shayne Gair), on a mysterious and isolated island off the coast of Washington State that is ruled by a cult of pagan women.  The look on Malus face could very well be that of Cage as he slowly realized the horror of a movie that he had gotten himself into.  Not that Cage is at fault.  Nicolas is a great actor and despite having a resume that includes some of the most dismal pictures ever made (LEAVING LAS VEGAS), his very presence in a movie makes it a better picture than it would have been otherwise.  He's got the everyman appeal of Tom Hank, the charm of Cary Grant, and the acting skills of Al Pacino.  No, Nicolas Cage isn't the problem with this remake of THE WICKER MAN.  In fact, he's one of the reasons someone should see this movie.Perhaps, the plot and script are the culprit.  The film has changed greatly from the original cult classic that starred Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee.  The location is set in the U.S. on a small, isolated island off the coast of Puget Sound (the locations are amazing) instead of an isolated isle off near Scotland (is there such thing as an isolated island near Puget Sound anymore?).  Instead of a pagan cultic community taking desperate measures to bring favor to their gods, there is an enclosed community of women misandrists performing a ritual they perform every generation (by the way for those who believe in THE DA VINCI CODE, this is the type of world you would live in if that was true).  There are some major plot holes, e.g. the girl and mother who supposedly die in a fiery car crash and why exactly do the women worship bees again?  Nevertheless, much of the original THE WICKER MAN's key moments are a part of the film and the feminist cult setting updates and contemporizes the original film's tone in a way that would make most remade films proud; different but true to the original spirit (Edward Woodward who starred in the original THE WICKER MAN was offered a role in the film but declined to take it, but stated that he was ""surprisingly impressed by the quality of the script"" of the remake).No, the problem with this THE WICKER MAN isn't the acting or plot. It is the characterization.  Nicolas Cage does a great job, but Officer Edward Malus does not seem like a very likeable person.  He enjoys helping people and has a great deal of those two distinctive American qualities of individuality and self-reliance.  He's also very rugged and seems to be the type of person who would make a great golf partner or drinking buddy.  However, he's not at all like what Sister Rose (Molly Parker) calls him: quixotic.  No, Officer Malus is anything but quixotic (the school teachers at Summerisles are apparently even less intelligent than the students they teach).  Don Quixote was a nobleman who believed in an ideal.  Quixote's ideal might have seemed unrealistic and crazy, but it was an ideal that inspired those around him to live better lives than they would have otherwise.  Edward Malus isn't like that.  He seems more like someone suffering with bipolar disorder:  one moment he's very outgoing and jovial, the next he's yelling at the top of his voice and on the verge of throwing something or hitting something.  He willfully disrespects the law once he enters Summerisles, even though he is a man who is supposed to uphold the law.  He chases away the people who care from him most away either because won't let them get too close or because they are afraid of his angry wrath.  In short, he's a jerk. When Malus meets his fate, the audience doesn't really care.  Sure, it's all very violent and horrifying.  Yet, the audience is given the impression that it might have been a good thing.That's not what THE WICKER MAN is supposed to be about.  The original film was about a noble man (who was indeed quixotic) who met a very undeserved, horrifying, and grisly demise.  That original film is wicked because the bad guys seem to win.  The noble ideal is extinguished in flames of pagan lust.  That doesn't happen in this film.  Sure what Malus has to endure is horrifying, but because he doesn't represent an ideal, it's not all that shocking.THE WICKER MAN could have been an excellent film in the suspense/horror genre that added to the original movie it was remade from.

I had heard that it was a cult classic and a forgotten gem. Well, I never saw all of the origional Wicker Man but some bozo put the entire end on Youtube so I got the basic premise of it. BUT I did just see the entire version that stars Nicolas Cage. I must say that I only saw about 15 minutes of the origional and it was better and had more depth than this dreck. The movie starts our ok but then just turns to blah. They leave out one of the things that made the origional good (or at least good to some people) that is the fact that the cop is a devout Christian that sets him off against this bunch of pagan fanatics. In this remake Cage is just a cop who experiences a tragic and traumatic event and then starts taking medication because he is so disturbed by what happened. They also change up the pagan weirdo's. They are still weird but they are kind of a man hating cult of freako bizarro strango people. They use men for labor and for 'breeding'. But anyway, this movie just isn't very good and Nicolas Cage proves again that he is not a very good actor and has little range beyond his usual quicky stuff.Do yourself a favor watch the Youtube clip if you are intriqued by hearing about this movie because the remake is not very good and from what I have heard and seen of the origional it's not very good either, weird and different but not good.",2,This Movie Should Be Sacrificed and BURNED!,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1439,"['had', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'years', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'origional', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'cult', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'Well', 'never', 'saw', 'origional', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'bozo', 'put', 'entire', 'end', 'Youtube', 'got', 'basic', 'premise', 'BUT', 'did', 'just', 'see', 'entire', 'version', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'must', 'say', 'only', 'saw', '15', 'minutes', 'origional', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'dreck', 'movie', 'ok', 'then', 'just', 'blah', 'leave', 'out', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'origional', 'good', 'least', 'good', 'people', 'fact', 'cop', 'devout', 'Christian', 'off', 'bunch', 'pagan', 'fanatics', 'remake', 'Cage', 'just', 'cop', 'who', 'tragic', 'traumatic', 'event', 'then', 'taking', 'medication', 'so', 'disturbed', 'what', 'happened', 'also', 'change', 'up', 'pagan', 'weirdo', 'are', 'still', 'weird', 'are', 'kind', 'man', 'hating', 'cult', 'freako', 'bizarro', 'strango', 'people', 'use', 'men', 'labor', ""'breeding"", 'anyway', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'again', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'little', 'range', 'usual', 'quicky', 'stuff.Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'Youtube', 'clip', 'are', 'intriqued', 'hearing', 'movie', 'remake', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'seen', 'origional', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'weird', 'different', 'not', 'good']",N/A

Zheleznyak,"[7, 7]","i bought this movie for like 8$ which isnt bad for the bluray.yes, i read and knew all about this 'terrible' movie. when one cant find a REAL trailer to a movie on youtube (instead only parodies exist), that tells you something.luckily i love Nick Cage and i enjoy a good laugh, especially at the expense of someone, so this was a perfect purchase.what can i say? the movie is awesome and terrible at the same time. first of all, i was genuinely intrigued about the story and where it was going, and the ending made me a bit sad (i hate watching Nick go!). however, none of that means that it isnt poorly written or absolutely hilarious to watch.the writing is bad. the movie is just a mess all together. Nick does his best acting out what is essentially a fully maniacal drug addict running around tripping balls being sarcastic and making snide remarks to everyone he meets. and thats just the first half of the movie. the best is the 2nd part, at one point you see him jump under water to rescue what he sees as a dying/drowned little girl, then, POOF he wakes up on the pier... the camera pans down and you see the same dead drenched girl on his lap!!! and then... POOF! he wakes up again. thats right folks, a double 'dream'! thats just bad film making. it was so funny and bad that Nick Cage himself said ""GODDAMNIT!"" or something along those lines (im not kidding)--and this is where i think Nick Cage refused to follow the script and just went around the set trying to be as crazy as possible--after that it all gets even better. Cage beats the crap out of 3 women (one got a roundhouse Norris style!), dresses up as a bear, yells nonsense at his woman, just generally yells at everyone, steals a bicycle, picks on little children, curses randomly at children and other bystanders, has more acid trips, cries and does some more yelling.yes. its awesome.but you know what? after all of that, i still found the story itself disturbing and felt real bad for the character. to me? i say its a good film for all the reasons mentioned here. definitely a guilty pleasure.",5,this film is fantastic. as long as you...,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,2072,"['i', 'bought', 'movie', '8', 'isnt', 'bad', 'bluray.yes', 'i', 'read', 'knew', ""'terrible"", 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'cant', 'find', 'REAL', 'trailer', 'movie', 'youtube', 'instead', 'only', 'parodies', 'exist', 'something.luckily', 'i', 'love', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'i', 'enjoy', 'good', 'laugh', 'especially', 'expense', 'someone', 'was', 'perfect', 'purchase.what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'movie', 'awesome', 'terrible', 'same', 'time', 'first', 'i', 'was', 'genuinely', 'intrigued', 'story', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'ending', 'made', 'bit', 'sad', 'i', 'hate', 'watching', 'Nick', 'go', 'however', 'none', 'poorly', 'written', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'watch.the', 'writing', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'mess', 'together', 'Nick', 'best', 'acting', 'out', 'what', 'essentially', 'fully', 'maniacal', 'drug', 'addict', 'running', 'around', 'tripping', 'balls', 'being', 'sarcastic', 'making', 'snide', 'remarks', 'everyone', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'best', '2nd', 'part', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'jump', 'water', 'rescue', 'what', 'dying/drowned', 'little', 'girl', 'then', 'POOF', 'up', 'pier', 'camera', 'down', 'see', 'same', 'dead', 'drenched', 'girl', 'lap', 'then', 'POOF', 'up', 'again', 'thats', 'right', 'folks', 'double', ""'dream"", 'thats', 'just', 'bad', 'film', 'making', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'bad', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'said', 'GODDAMNIT', 'something', 'lines', 'im', 'not', 'kidding', 'where', 'i', 'think', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'refused', 'follow', 'script', 'just', 'went', 'set', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'crazy', 'possible', 'even', 'better', 'Cage', 'crap', '3', 'women', 'one', 'got', 'roundhouse', 'Norris', 'style', 'up', 'bear', 'nonsense', 'woman', 'just', 'generally', 'yells', 'everyone', 'bicycle', 'picks', 'little', 'children', 'curses', 'randomly', 'children', 'other', 'bystanders', 'more', 'acid', 'trips', 'cries', 'more', 'yelling.yes', 'awesome.but', 'know', 'what', 'i', 'still', 'found', 'story', 'disturbing', 'felt', 'real', 'bad', 'character', 'i', 'say', 'good', 'film', 'reasons', 'mentioned', 'here', 'definitely', 'guilty', 'pleasure']",N/A
1030060,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000JYW5DM,Wayne C. Rogers,"[4, 5]","I've never seen the 1975 version of The Wicker Man with Edward Woodward.  It's supposedly more suspenseful with a creepy atmosphere that's made it a cult classic over the last thirty years.  The newer version with Nicholas Cage, I'm sad to say, has very little suspense and practically none of what I would think of as a creepy atmosphere.  Think of the hero running through the woods at night with a thick fog-like mist shrouding the area and something chasing him that he can't see.  Nope.  I didn't see any of that in this new, unrated version.  Though not a total waste, if I were Nicholas Cage, I wouldn't include this movie on my film resume.Nicholas Cage plays California Highway Patrolman, Edward Malus.  On afternoon, while patrolling the back roads of California, he sees a child's toy fly out the window of the station wagon in front of him.  He sweeps up the doll with his free hand and pulls over the car.  After he returns the doll to the little girl in the backseat, the brat throws it out the window again with the doll landing on the other side of the road.  As Edward is picking up the toy again, a tracker trailer rig comes from out of nowhere and swerves to miss him, hitting the parked station wagon instead.  He tries to rescue the girl and her mother, but the car explodes from the engulfing flames, leaving him unconscious.  Months later, while on a leave of absence, Edward receives a letter from his old fianc&eacute;, Willow, who suddenly needs his help in finding her missing daughter, Rowan.  Though he hasn't seen Willow in several years, it's his one chance at redemption in not being able to save the little girl from the burning car.  Edward goes to the northwestern pacific island where Willow is now living and discovers a religious community filled with forceful women and rather meek men.  No one seems to know anything about the missing child, and Edward gets a different story from everyone he questions.  Of course, the story really isn't about the missing child, but rather about Edward and his relationship to the island.  As Edward draws nearer to finding the answers to his questions, he gets closer to the truth of why he's really there.  Needless to say, Edward won't be a happy camper once he realizes what's in store for him.I think most viewers of this film knew where the ending was headed about halfway through the movie.  I know that nothing really surprised me, other than the wasted talent in this flick.  None of the performers seemed to really be into their roles other than maybe Molly Parker as Sister Rose, who seemed somewhat anxious to get her hands on Nicholas Cage..  One thing I will say is that for a small island, it sure took a lot of time to get from one end of it to the other.  Also, at the beginning of the film when the female police officer comes to visit Nicholas Cage at his home and to give him his mail from the office, did anyone else notice the question that was asked of her by Cages' character--""Were the two bodies ever found?"" he asked.  ""No,"" the female officer answers.  ""The car wasn't even registered to anybody.  We may never know who they were.""  What was going on here?  The bodies of the woman and her little girl disappeared from the burning wreck?  Did the island people have anything to do with it?  I don't know.  The questions were never fully answered.  It had me scratching my head in puzzlement.  As far as the alternate ending goes on this DVD (the unrated version is on one side of the disc, and the theatrical version is on the flip side), there were only about three or four more minutes of extra footage added, which depicted a more intense, violent ending.  I didn't see anything to jump up and down about.  I already know that women can be cruel to the male species.

1030063,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000JYW5DM,Wuchak,"[7, 17]","The reviews here are unbelievable. They make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of ""The Wicker Man"" out to be an incredulous turkey of astronomical proportions on the level of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""American Beauty."" Well, I just saw it twice -- both the widescreen theatrical cut and the full screen cut with the Director's alternative ending -- and I can safely tell you that it's all a bunch of malarkey.First of all, let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes, it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths, including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like ""How Do"" song & dance is a definite highlight), but it's certainly not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing, the protagonist Edward Woodward (Sgt. Howie) is incredibly annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a self-rigteous, Pharasaical tighty-righty (this is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition, Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which, I know, is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in ""Wicker Man"" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull way; the plot itself is interesting, but the delivery is less than compelling.Woodward is so unlikable and annoying that, on some subconscious level, I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I simply didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be, but somehow it wasn't.One last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it. I was therefore looking foward to Neil LaBute's 2006 version.THE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fiance's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards, pagan and matriarchal in nature; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.WHAT WORKS: First of all, unlike Woodward, Cage is likable as the protagonist (or, at least, we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women, we understand what has driven him to such actions.The British Columbian locations are good, pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.Ellen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until a full hour into the film and she fittingly comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.Molly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are quite fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly, in particular, has a very unique loveliness to her. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original, but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute expertly shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.The story is entertaining, fun and, at times, even unintentionally hilarious. For instance, the scene where Cage talks with the ""barmaid"" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are numerous other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: ""STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!"", running around in a bear costume, the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock, numerous hilarious lines like ""OH NO, NOT THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!!"", etc.) but the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original, by contrast, was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.The ending is horrifying (WAY more so than the original), even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes, the bees would have killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.In the theatrical version there's a ""6 months later"" coda tacked on, which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story, ""When you leave, take me with you."" This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.The DVD, incidentally, features the theatrical cut on one side and the alternative-ending cut on the other. Unfortunately the vocal track is slightly off on the alternative cut. There's also a trailer and a decent commentary track with the director, Leelee, Kate and one other person (I didn't listen to the entire commentary, but what I did hear was informative).WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless, but adds to the mounting mystery. Also, the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.Some people may look down on the film because of the numerous unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!!FINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of ""The Wicker Man"" are 4/5 Star films and are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are, of course, a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like ""Psycho"" people complain, and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade, and this is a good updating. I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy, horrifying elements. On top of this there are numerous humorous aspects. And, thankfully, the protagonist isn't some irritating religionist with a corncob stuck up his arse.Lastly, you won't understand unless you see it but this remake is destined to become a cult classic

He let someone rummage through his stuff, didn't tell anyone where he was going, and walked around the island bungling into everyone's business, flashing his badge around even after the first 20 minutes of people telling him that he was out of his jurisdiction.I mean come on!!!  Even these people who have probably never in their lives seen a cop or know anything about law enforcement were able to tell him, ""Hey genius, unless you're in the state of California you can't make an arrest, and even if you do arrest us, you're about 50 miles from the nearest precinct!!!  And to top it all off, if you do manage to arrest one of us and get us into custody, any judge with half a brain is gonna let us go because you are out of your jurisdiction!!!""The plot was full of holes that the movie made no attempt to wrap up.  His phone rings and it's his cop buddy Pete and brain-dead cop number 2 didn't bother to check out someone screaming, ""Pete, help us! Help us!!!""  Yeah, there's a genius cop for ya!And finally the whole ""cult-living-on-an-island-thing"" has been done to death over the years throughout literature and film, can we be a little more original!?!  Or maybe re-make an actual GOOD movie?  Or how about give up on the whole craze of remaking old films and actually write an original script for once?  Come on!!!  Is Hollywood really all out of ideas after only 70 years of making films that they have to turn out a piece of garbage remake like this every 3 months???I could go on and on and on about why this movie sucked horribly.  But I'll end with this, save your money and rent or buy an actual GOOD thriller movie.Anyway I'm off to watch Night Of The Living Dead, an actual DECENT film.",1,"Terrible, simply terrible!",1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1893,"['Okay', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'one', 'was', 'obviously', 'worse', 'original', 'cuz', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'First', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'portraying', 'DUMBEST', 'cop', 'time', 'let', 'someone', 'rummage', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'walked', 'island', 'bungling', 'everyone', 'business', 'flashing', 'badge', 'around', 'even', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'people', 'telling', 'was', 'jurisdiction.I', 'mean', 'come', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'lives', 'seen', 'cop', 'know', 'anything', 'law', 'enforcement', 'were', 'able', 'tell', 'Hey', 'genius', ""'re"", 'state', 'California', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'arrest', 'even', 'do', 'arrest', ""'re"", '50', 'miles', 'nearest', 'precinct', 'top', 'off', 'do', 'manage', 'arrest', 'one', 'get', 'custody', 'judge', 'brain', 'gon', 'let', 'go', 'are', 'jurisdiction', 'plot', 'was', 'full', 'holes', 'movie', 'made', 'attempt', 'wrap', 'up', 'phone', 'rings', 'cop', 'buddy', 'Pete', 'brain-dead', 'cop', 'number', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'check', 'out', 'someone', 'screaming', 'Pete', 'help', 'Help', 'Yeah', 'genius', 'cop', 'ya', 'finally', 'whole', 'cult-living-on-an-island-thing', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'years', 'literature', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'original', 'maybe', 're-make', 'actual', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'how', 'about', 'give', 'up', 'whole', 'craze', 'remaking', 'old', 'films', 'actually', 'write', 'original', 'script', 'once', 'Come', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'ideas', 'only', '70', 'years', 'making', 'films', 'have', 'turn', 'out', 'piece', 'garbage', 'remake', '3', 'months', 'could', 'go', 'about', 'why', 'movie', 'sucked', 'horribly', ""'ll"", 'end', 'save', 'money', 'rent', 'buy', 'actual', 'GOOD', 'thriller', 'movie.Anyway', ""'m"", 'watch', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'actual', 'DECENT', 'film']",N/A
