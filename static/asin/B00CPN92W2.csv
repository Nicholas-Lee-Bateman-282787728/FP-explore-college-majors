Normally do a little fact-checking to make sure I've got character and actor names correct before I go into a review, but this movie was so generally bland that I don't have the spirit for it. It follows three women -- once childhood friends -- who decide to go camping on an island they used to love as kids, and where they have a buried treasure/time capsule. Two of the ladies don't exactly get along so well, due to a years-old discretion that it would take you one guess to figure out. While there, they come across another person from their youth: a young man who is accompanied by two quiet buddies, the three of them on the island for a hunting trip. After one of the women gets entangled in a violent altercation, the situation spirals out of control and we find our heroines fighting for their survival.Done by the Duplass brothers (who are known for more quietly dramatic, humanized fare), this film has a straightforward feel that might appeal to people with simpler tastes. There's not a lot going on in the plot or the characters that isn't rehashed from hundreds of other movies that came before. In fact, the only real interesting fact is that two of the women -- one of whom is also the director of the piece -- I've only ever seen before in comedies (The LeagueandChildrens Hospital). They do really good jobs switching over to the drama here -- including what I would call a pretty brave nude scene -- but their characters don't inspire a whole lotta interest.There are a few scenes and moments that provide a moment's shock or pathos, but overall it definitely feels like the low-budget indie that it is. Duplass and company are known for low-key, simplistic films, but deeply drawn characters and intriguingly dramatic plots have usually made that simplicity seem like a poetic contrast to the complexity underneath. Here the simplistic writing only bogs the running time down and makes it look like a plain pup jumping through all of the standard thriller hoops, right down to it's over-long and not-all-that-surprising climax and conclusion.",3,Thud,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,2069,"['Meh', 'Normally', 'do', 'little', 'fact-checking', 'make', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'got', 'character', 'actor', 'names', 'correct', 'go', 'review', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'generally', 'bland', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spirit', 'three', 'women', 'once', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'camping', 'island', 'used', 'love', 'kids', 'where', 'have', 'buried', 'treasure/time', 'capsule', 'Two', 'ladies', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'get', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'due', 'years-old', 'discretion', 'would', 'take', 'one', 'guess', 'figure', 'out', 'there', 'come', 'person', 'youth', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'accompanied', 'two', 'quiet', 'buddies', 'three', 'island', 'hunting', 'trip', 'one', 'women', 'entangled', 'violent', 'altercation', 'situation', 'control', 'find', 'heroines', 'fighting', 'survival.Done', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'known', 'more', 'quietly', 'dramatic', 'humanized', 'fare', 'film', 'straightforward', 'feel', 'might', 'appeal', 'people', 'simpler', 'tastes', 'not', 'lot', 'going', 'plot', 'characters', ""n't"", 'rehashed', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', 'came', 'before', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'interesting', 'fact', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'whom', 'also', 'director', 'piece', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'comedies', 'LeagueandChildrens', 'Hospital', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'jobs', 'switching', 'drama', 'here', 'including', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'pretty', 'brave', 'nude', 'scene', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'whole', 'lotta', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'moments', 'provide', 'moment', 'shock', 'pathos', 'overall', 'definitely', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'Duplass', 'company', 'are', 'known', 'low-key', 'simplistic', 'films', 'deeply', 'drawn', 'characters', 'intriguingly', 'dramatic', 'plots', 'have', 'usually', 'made', 'simplicity', 'seem', 'poetic', 'contrast', 'complexity', 'underneath', 'Here', 'simplistic', 'writing', 'only', 'running', 'time', 'down', 'look', 'plain', 'pup', 'jumping', 'standard', 'thriller', 'hoops', 'right', 'down', 'over-long', 'not-all-that-surprising', 'climax', 'conclusion']",N/A
1649900,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00CPN92W2,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","This movie will take a lot of suspension of disbelief to get through. The story is pretty basic. Two sets of three friends are on a deserted island off the coast of Maine. In the group of women, two of them are estranged, and are basically conned into going camping by the third one. The three men have recently been dishonorably discharged from the military, which is pretty much all the set up they be for being bad guys. One of the guys ends up dead after trying to rape one of the women, and the other two decide to try and hunt down and kill the three women. There is more to it than that, but not a lot more. That is the gist of it.The fact that the movie is short, just an hour and 20 min, is good and bad. On one hand it gets in and out quickly and does not try to do too much. On the other hand there is little to no character development at all, especially for the male characters.

Bad decisions when trying to get away. The moment they decide to stop running and hunt the hunters and about 10 min of gratuitous nudity.

1649901,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00CPN92W2,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","There may be spoilers.Sometimes I try out a movie I've never heard of, often for different reasons.  I had recently seen Lake Bell's feature film directorial debut (""In a World..."") and loved the movie.  Here, she returns to her regular job as an actress playing Lou, one of three childhood friends, coerced into camping out on a thickly wooded island in the middle of a Maine lake where they grew up.  The instigator of this reunion is Sarah (Kate Bosworth).  The third woman is Abby played by Katie Aselton who also directed and wrote the story.Abby and Lou have a history going back a few years which caused a split in their friendship.  Sarah, still friends with both, wants them all to be happy buddies again.  The first act, nicely staged by Aselton, in this her second director job, shows the girls as...well, girly.  Petty, holding a grudge, Abby in particular is not very likable.  Once the ladies motorboat over to the island and set up camp, they are startled by 3 dudes armed with rifles.  Hunting deer they say.Abby recognizes one of the guys as Henry (Will Bouvier), the younger brother of another classmate.  As it turns out these are recently discharged soldiers (Jay Paulson, Anslem Richardson) who served several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Abby invites them to share a campfire and a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Lou and Sarah are cautious and become more concerned when Abby gets drunk and starts flirting with Henry.  Buoyed by a fine screenplay by Mark Duplass (Aselton's real life husband), the ladies change ever so slowly under duress.  And as slow as these changes come with the women, it is just the opposite with the guys.  That is really my only nit to pick.  They go from shy, decent guys to raving maniacs in a heartbeat.Yes the film has hints of ""Deliverance,"" ""River Wild"" and ""Most Dangerous Game"" but the excellent performances, strong photography and a brilliant musical score provide and believable thriller.  I also perked up after Lou and Abby have to disrobe in the woods.  Not for the usual titillation but for legitimate survival reasons.  This is a strong film with excellent production values and terrific performances by the ladies.  Highly recommended.The Blu ray version of the film comes in full 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was digitally shot and the daytime scenes look great including the dense forestation.  Colors here are nothing to shout about as Aselton obviously wanted to tone things down with varying shade of grey, but some of that is the June weather of Maine I suspect.  The audio is excellent with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There is plenty of woodsy sound all around and the dynamic range is very good.  Dialog is clear and consistent throughout the film.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Aselton and Bell, a piece on the excellent soundtrack, a short but interesting behind the scenes piece and a trailer.",4,"(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for an excellent, if derivative, thriller",1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,2955,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.Sometimes', 'try', 'out', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'often', 'different', 'reasons', 'had', 'recently', 'seen', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'World', 'loved', 'movie', 'Here', 'regular', 'job', 'actress', 'playing', 'Lou', 'one', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'coerced', 'camping', 'out', 'thickly', 'wooded', 'island', 'middle', 'Maine', 'lake', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'instigator', 'reunion', 'Sarah', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'third', 'woman', 'Abby', 'played', 'Katie', 'Aselton', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'wrote', 'story.Abby', 'Lou', 'have', 'history', 'going', 'back', 'few', 'years', 'caused', 'split', 'friendship', 'Sarah', 'still', 'be', 'happy', 'buddies', 'again', 'first', 'act', 'nicely', 'staged', 'Aselton', 'second', 'director', 'job', 'girls', 'well', 'girly', 'Petty', 'holding', 'grudge', 'Abby', 'particular', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'ladies', 'motorboat', 'island', 'set', 'up', 'camp', 'are', 'startled', '3', 'dudes', 'armed', 'rifles', 'Hunting', 'deer', 'say.Abby', 'one', 'guys', 'Henry', 'Will', 'Bouvier', 'younger', 'brother', 'classmate', 'out', 'are', 'recently', 'discharged', 'soldiers', 'Jay', 'Paulson', 'Anslem', 'Richardson', 'who', 'served', 'several', 'tours', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Abby', 'share', 'campfire', 'bottle', 'Jack', 'Daniels', 'Lou', 'Sarah', 'are', 'cautious', 'become', 'more', 'concerned', 'when', 'Abby', 'drunk', 'flirting', 'Henry', 'Buoyed', 'fine', 'screenplay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Aselton', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'ladies', 'change', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'duress', 'as', 'slow', 'changes', 'come', 'women', 'just', 'opposite', 'guys', 'really', 'only', 'nit', 'pick', 'go', 'shy', 'decent', 'guys', 'raving', 'maniacs', 'heartbeat.Yes', 'film', 'hints', 'Deliverance', 'River', 'Wild', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'excellent', 'performances', 'strong', 'photography', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'score', 'provide', 'believable', 'thriller', 'also', 'perked', 'up', 'Lou', 'Abby', 'have', 'disrobe', 'woods', 'Not', 'usual', 'titillation', 'legitimate', 'survival', 'reasons', 'strong', 'film', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'terrific', 'performances', 'ladies', 'Highly', 'recommended.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'full', '1080p', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'movie', 'was', 'digitally', 'shot', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'look', 'great', 'including', 'dense', 'forestation', 'Colors', 'here', 'are', 'nothing', 'shout', 'about', 'Aselton', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'tone', 'things', 'down', 'varying', 'shade', 'grey', 'June', 'weather', 'Maine', 'suspect', 'audio', 'excellent', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'plenty', 'woodsy', 'sound', 'dynamic', 'range', 'very', 'good', 'Dialog', 'clear', 'consistent', 'film', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Aselton', 'Bell', 'piece', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'short', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'piece', 'trailer']",N/A

Back in the early days of film, this was common, but today it's rare. While I admire all the work a single person puts into such an effort, the truth is that most of these films turn out to be a little strange, Black Rock is no exception. Three life long best friends decide to reconnect on a weekend retreat, to a small secluded island, where they had a lot of childhood memories. Once there, they run into a pack of hunters. Testosterone and alcohol mix, leading to a vicious assault, leaving one group a member short, and the other group on the run. Katie Aselton is the Writer, Director, & star of this film and while I admire what she put into it, the truth is that it was very predictable and didn't make a whole lot of sense. First of all, these three women, as children were allowed to play on a secluded island in the middle of nowhere, without supervision? It also doesn't make sense that the hunters would be there, when there was seemingly no wildlife, and of course there had to be exactly three of them. Finally, why did three women, spending a weekend alone on a secluded island, bring enough alcohol to fuel a Todd Phillips movie? The whole thing was just a little too weird to be believable, and when you add how predictable this film was, it's just a recipe for disaster. The one thing I liked was the performance of Jay Paulson. He's usually a guy who gets bit parts and guest appearances here and there, but he was very solid and the most believable of the six characters.

While this is very entertaining this is not one of those kind of movies. The movie is really nothing that deep but I did enjoy it. Be prepared for it though, some parts are very gory and a little hard to watch. On the other hand this is a ""girl power"" type movie so it does have that going for it. If you like movies like the Perfect Getaway then you will like this one as well. It was entertaining and a good watch but nothing that will keep you talking or thinking. Overall, fun and exciting but nothing that original. I liked it though. I give it a B",3,Fun and entertaining but nothing really original. A little gory in parts. I liked it and this is worth seeing.

There is no need for a woman to behave so foolishly, yet even in this day and age, they still do. One of the characters named Abby is married and is just plain dumb. These three women are joined together to reconnect. Abby is angry at one friend for seducing her boyfriend years ago. And now, on this island with three strange men they just met she teases one of them out into the woods with her. Just before they're about to do the deed she changes her mind and says no. Angry, the man is furious and tries to rape her. She kills him and as a result puts her two friends in immediate danger and the three women struggle to stay alive while being hunted down by the two remaining men. Mind you, all three of these guys were dishonorably discharged from the military for some undisclosed reason they never mention.This whole situation could have been avoided had Abby kept sense in her head and remembered that she was married. Instead, she not only invites the total strangers to dinner with them at their campsite, she gives them liquor, and leads them on. Gee, I wondered what was going to happen. Overall, this was a good character study to show not what to do and a pretty predictable film to watch. The women do a good job of fighting back, though. It was definitely a fast moving film, though, once the action finally began.All in all, save your time, effort and money for another more worthwhile film.",3,"Dumb film with predictable results!

Kate bosworth and her girlfriends are really cute and between them are able to survive most of the film. Was hoping that they would all make it out alive but sadly only one survives. one of the gals (bell) is really quite attractive and is constantly arguing with her friends about previous love affairs. they soon forgive each other when the going gets tough and make a great team for fighting the guys. a scene that would have been better (if it only had been daytime) was where they change out of their wet clothes and then proceed to run naked thru the woods in search of a lost buried chest. when they find it , they have weapons, and then suddenly reappear in the daytime with dry clothes... did they use a fire to dry them? some more sexiness was sadly lacking in this film.. one can only hope that there is another un-cut version that will be available soon... with more deleted unrated stuff.. a real edge of your seat suspenseful film",4,Great survivor film,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1326,"['basic', 'premise', 'film', '3', 'girls', 'who', 'travel', 'island', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'unbeknownst', 'are', '3', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'hunt', 'animals', 'partying', '/', 'drinking', 'six', 'then', 'when', 'attempted', 'rape', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'gals', 'guys', 'guys', 'have', 'weapons', 'gals', 'are', 'defenseless', 'Kate', 'bosworth', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'are', 'able', 'survive', 'most', 'film', 'Was', 'hoping', 'would', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'sadly', 'only', 'one', 'one', 'gals', 'bell', 'really', 'quite', 'attractive', 'constantly', 'arguing', 'friends', 'previous', 'love', 'affairs', 'soon', 'forgive', 'other', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'fighting', 'guys', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'daytime', 'was', 'where', 'change', 'wet', 'clothes', 'then', 'proceed', 'run', 'naked', 'woods', 'search', 'lost', 'buried', 'chest', 'when', 'find', 'have', 'weapons', 'then', 'suddenly', 'reappear', 'daytime', 'dry', 'clothes', 'did', 'use', 'fire', 'dry', 'more', 'sexiness', 'was', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'film..', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'un-cut', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'soon', 'more', 'deleted', 'unrated', 'stuff..', 'real', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspenseful', 'film']",N/A
