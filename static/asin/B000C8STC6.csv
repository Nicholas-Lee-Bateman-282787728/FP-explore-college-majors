955630,A2XGFPVV6P815H,B000C8STC6,J. Rubino,"[13, 14]","This was a tough review to write; after her ""Advanced Texas Hold'em Secrets"" DVD I was amped up for another advanced course for ""online"" poker... It's very tough to be unbiased after watching her excellent advanced DVD; it delivered more than I had expected and I was hoping to hit another jackpot with this one.Unfortunately it is not as good as the advanced DVD. That said, this is an acceptable DVD for playing online. It covers the expected basics like how to set up an account and play for ""play"" money until you become familiar with the software and the site. She goes through live cash play as well as several varieties of tournament play- multi table tournaments, satellites and the Sit and Go's or SNG's as well as online tells and betting patterns. What she covers is good but because I have been playing a long time I found very little in the way of ""secrets"" or ""conquering"" online play.If you are somewhat new to online play it delivers an adequate overview and will help you to get started playing online. If you have purchased the ""Advanced Holdem"" DVD and are expecting similar ""advanced"" concepts here you will probably be disappointed. Most new players will find some value, just be sure not to compare the two. I gave it four stars because I think it delivers if you are somewhat new to online play; if you have been playing for a while online already it is probably a two or three and I would consider renting it first as you will probably not need to re-watch it numerous times as I did with her advanced DVD.",4,"""Conquering""?

She will literally tell you how to download the poker software. She also talks too much about hand history, about how you can see what cards people mucked. I'm not even sure that is true on most poker sites; perhaps it is on [...], the site she endorses.The good part is when she tells you how to adjust your playing style according to the ante/pot size of the table. But this is a pretty short part of the total running time and doesn't justify spending[..]to hear. Overall, there's not really anything to justify this being a DVD at all. She's just sitting at a poker table talking, but she doesn't show any cards or anything, so this program would have been just as good as an audio lecture.

955632,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000C8STC6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[12, 12]","Annie Duke's Conquering Online Poker (Big Vision Studio, 2005)Okay, so everyone knows that sex sells. Everyone also knows (everyone, at least, who watches the World Series of Poker) that Annie Duke is one fine-lookin' lady. Given those two facts, I cannot help but think that someone hit upon the bright idea for this DVD, which is... sixty minutes of Annie Duke (in, at least, a good outfit) talking while sitting in the dealer's chair at a Hold'em table. I can't swear to it, because I am extremely thick sometimes, but I'd also say that it counts as an extended infomercial for UltimateBet.Now, as long as you're simply looking for some eye candy and don't mind infomercials-- Annie Duke is sure easier on the eyes than Billy Mays or Ron Popeil-- go for it. If you're looking for information on playing online poker, however, you've come to the wrong place. At least half the video is spent discussing tips, tricks, and techniques for setting up an account with an online poker site; I'm not entirely sure, but I'm guessing that the people who are going to be the target market for this video have already done so. This is not necessarily an uncommon problem; almost every book on Thoroughbred handicapping published, no matter how advanced, includes at least a couple of pages on how to read past performances. But there you're talking about two or three pages of a three-hundred-plus-page book; here; you're talking about fully 50% of the content. One's excusable if annoying. The other is hard to swallow, especially at MSRP. There's some interesting stuff to be found in the latter half, but nothing that really goes into depth, and a surprising lack of visual aids; no diagrams, charts, screencaps, etc.Rent this one if you must, but it's not worth your hard-earned dollars, and it's not got much rewatch potential. **",2,"Trim the fat and you get a really, really short DVD.",1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1826,"['Annie', 'Duke', 'Conquering', 'Online', 'Poker', 'Big', 'Vision', 'Studio', '2005', 'Okay', 'everyone', 'sex', 'Everyone', 'also', 'everyone', 'least', 'who', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'Annie', 'Duke', 'one', 'fine-lookin', 'lady', 'Given', 'two', 'facts', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'someone', 'hit', 'bright', 'idea', 'DVD', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'Annie', 'Duke', 'least', 'good', 'outfit', 'talking', 'sitting', 'dealer', 'chair', ""Hold'em"", 'table', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swear', 'am', 'extremely', 'thick', 'sometimes', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'extended', 'infomercial', 'UltimateBet.Now', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'simply', 'looking', 'eye', 'candy', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'infomercials', 'Annie', 'Duke', 'sure', 'easier', 'eyes', 'Billy', 'Mays', 'Ron', 'Popeil', 'go', ""'re"", 'looking', 'information', 'playing', 'online', 'poker', 'however', ""'ve"", 'come', 'wrong', 'place', 'least', 'video', 'spent', 'discussing', 'tips', 'tricks', 'techniques', 'setting', 'up', 'account', 'online', 'poker', 'site', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'target', 'market', 'video', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'not', 'necessarily', 'uncommon', 'problem', 'almost', 'book', 'Thoroughbred', 'handicapping', 'published', 'matter', 'how', 'advanced', 'least', 'couple', 'pages', 'how', 'read', 'past', 'performances', ""'re"", 'talking', 'two', 'three', 'pages', 'three-hundred-plus-page', 'book', 'here', ""'re"", 'talking', 'fully', '50', '%', 'content', 'One', 'excusable', 'annoying', 'other', 'hard', 'swallow', 'especially', 'MSRP', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'be', 'found', 'latter', 'half', 'nothing', 'really', 'depth', 'surprising', 'lack', 'visual', 'aids', 'diagrams', 'charts', 'screencaps', 'etc.Rent', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'worth', 'hard-earned', 'dollars', 'not', 'got', 'much', 'rewatch', 'potential', '**']",Masters of Poker Presents: Annie Duke's Conquering Online Poker Platinum Edition
