454363,A24EMGY9DC4Z72,6305203601,John S. Socha,"[0, 0]","This was part of one of those 8 films for $5 DVDs and was a nice romantic tragedy..filmed in the former Yugoslavia (Talk about a tragedy!)The desperate dad was well acted, and young Pitt did a good job, even covered in a leather mask.A few WTF moments, like the bum who is crushing unlit cigarettes with his shoe to quit smoking and then later crushing condoms. He is featured all too often in the movie and apparently represents something, but what?And one on the beach scene, right before a motorcycle race, a female extra snaps off her bathing suite top and parades her ample bosom right in front of the camera lens.  Why?The re-use of the same classical music gets a bit cloying and the whole thing is a bit like a made-for-cable Hallmark special. But it's OK, and not much more.",3,"Classic concept, OK execution...but who was the drunk who wove through it/",1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,783,"['was', 'part', 'one', '8', 'films', '5', 'DVDs', 'was', 'nice', 'romantic', 'tragedy..filmed', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'Talk', 'tragedy', 'desperate', 'dad', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'young', 'Pitt', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'covered', 'leather', 'mask.A', 'few', 'WTF', 'moments', 'bum', 'who', 'crushing', 'unlit', 'cigarettes', 'shoe', 'quit', 'smoking', 'then', 'later', 'crushing', 'condoms', 'featured', 'too', 'often', 'movie', 'apparently', 'something', 'what', 'one', 'beach', 'scene', 'right', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'female', 'extra', 'snaps', 'bathing', 'suite', 'top', 'ample', 'bosom', 'right', 'front', 'camera', 'Why', 're-use', 'same', 'classical', 'music', 'bit', 'cloying', 'whole', 'thing', 'bit', 'made-for-cable', 'Hallmark', 'special', 'OK', 'not', 'much', 'more']",Dark Side of the Sun VHS

Happiness.""","[0, 1]","Thank goodness that time provides actors an opportunity to star in films for experience, to use better technology, take acting lessons and and get a hold of superb scriptwriting because this one was really subpar.  However, I understand they have to start somewhere. This movie really was not super bad but time really puts its stamp on films. I collect Brad Pitt films so this was a first for me and I won't be watching it again because it is not that kind of movie you want to watch repeatedly, but I made it all the way though even while I was in bed sick. And it is short too-not like today's ridiculously long movies. However, it is interesting to see his technique at play now and back then.  I see common things that he does.",3,Wow.,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,732,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'time', 'actors', 'opportunity', 'star', 'films', 'experience', 'use', 'better', 'technology', 'take', 'acting', 'lessons', 'get', 'hold', 'superb', 'scriptwriting', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'subpar', 'However', 'understand', 'have', 'start', 'somewhere', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'super', 'bad', 'time', 'really', 'stamp', 'films', 'collect', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'films', 'so', 'was', 'first', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'made', 'way', 'even', 'was', 'bed', 'sick', 'short', 'too-not', 'today', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'movies', 'However', 'interesting', 'see', 'technique', 'play', 'now', 'back', 'then', 'see', 'common', 'things']",Dark Side of the Sun VHS

It says 1997 but as you can quickly see from the look of the tape it looks like an 80's afterschool special. Which if edited correctly would have been a spot on hit,even cult classic style. It was a nice film if you think back to that time, the films where 'hokey' and preachy and sad yet inspiring. Usually you would think about it for quite awhile after it was over. There were a few times i rolled my eyes so much i had a headache but then the film grabbed me once more to let it take me away and be guided on the journey they needed to tell us.  I probably will see it again and tell others about it. Maybe it will become a kind of cult? I hope so. This film and it's actors deserve it. I read about what it went through for us to finally see it in this finished state. Beautiful backdrop as well as beautiful young actors. I hope you give it a chance or a second chance. OH I was a bit confused about the mother? The father should be sainted with what he goes through. I know  that was random but needed to slip it in there.",4,brad pitt need i say more?,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,1126,"['was', 'kind', 'rude', 'filmakers', 'other', 'actors', 'face', 'made', 'decide', 'read', '1997', 'can', 'quickly', 'see', 'look', 'tape', '80', 'afterschool', 'special', 'Which', 'edited', 'correctly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spot', 'hit', 'even', 'cult', 'classic', 'style', 'was', 'nice', 'film', 'think', 'back', 'time', 'films', 'where', ""'hokey"", 'preachy', 'sad', 'yet', 'inspiring', 'Usually', 'would', 'think', 'quite', 'awhile', 'was', 'over', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'i', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'had', 'headache', 'then', 'film', 'grabbed', 'once', 'more', 'let', 'take', 'away', 'be', 'guided', 'journey', 'needed', 'tell', 'probably', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'tell', 'others', 'will', 'become', 'kind', 'cult', 'hope', 'so', 'film', 'actors', 'deserve', 'read', 'what', 'went', 'finally', 'see', 'finished', 'state', 'Beautiful', 'backdrop', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'young', 'actors', 'hope', 'give', 'chance', 'second', 'chance', 'OH', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'mother', 'father', 'should', 'be', 'sainted', 'what', 'know', 'was', 'random', 'needed', 'slip', 'there']",Dark Side of the Sun VHS
