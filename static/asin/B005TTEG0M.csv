I was disappointed and found the beautiful Gypsy Vanner horse the only thing I really cared for in the movie.  Yes, the movie DID teach valuable lessons, but in a very unrealistic way.  I've had horses for over 50 years and, believe me, they do NOT behave like this horse.  They are wonderful, perfect animals but this was way beyond anything that would happen in real life. And riding a horse to a dance in Philadelphia....please. Also, utterly, beyond belief, was the horse helping Whitney hop a train.....oh my.....

1503815,ADTVI1TQRV4UD,B005TTEG0M,J. Howard,"[4, 7]","I got this movie from the library because I love Gypsy Vanners, and because it had pretty good reviews on Amazon. Wow, it was awful! The horse was the best thing about the movie, for sure, though Brooke Shields looked great and was fine in her role. The unbelievabilty of the whole movie made my brain hurt: giant gaps in logic (eg- she has internet access at the library yet somehow cannot contact any of her friends for months), painful editing (horse is barefaced, yet in close-up has halter, then barefaced again), etc. But that's just the tip of the ridiculous iceberg- they live ""a couple of hours from Philadelphia"", she says at one point, yet she has no hesitation about riding a horse (he's not even HER horse!) back there so she can go to the formal. Whuh?? And then she has no problem abandoning the horse, who is supposedly her best & only friend, far from home or from Philly, so she can hop a train to get to the dance. And the horse later shows up at the dance to prove that the girl's story wasn't a lie. Because of course Bob the horse had no trouble finding his way to the school he'd never been to before. I won't even go into the fact that Kris Kirstofferson's character describes the girl as having ""natural horse sense"", even though the first time she gets on a horse it's not only from the wrong side, but she ends up facing backwards. And as for a moral- Your human friends will probably go behind your back & steal your boyfriend and try to embarass you at the formal (or else just forget about you when you move away), but your horse friend will come to your rescue and he'll show them! Nice. I know my 2 young nieces would be both bored and annoyed by this dumb movie, and I can't recommened it to anyone, young or old.",1,"This was actually painful to watch, it was so bad",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,1746,"['got', 'movie', 'library', 'love', 'Gypsy', 'Vanners', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'Wow', 'was', 'awful', 'horse', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'sure', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'looked', 'great', 'was', 'fine', 'role', 'unbelievabilty', 'whole', 'movie', 'made', 'brain', 'hurt', 'giant', 'gaps', 'logic', 'eg-', 'internet', 'access', 'library', 'yet', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'contact', 'friends', 'months', 'painful', 'editing', 'horse', 'barefaced', 'yet', 'close-up', 'halter', 'then', 'barefaced', 'again', 'etc', 'just', 'tip', 'ridiculous', 'iceberg-', 'live', 'couple', 'hours', 'Philadelphia', 'one', 'point', 'hesitation', 'riding', 'horse', 'not', 'even', 'HER', 'horse', 'back', 'can', 'go', 'formal', 'Whuh', 'then', 'problem', 'abandoning', 'horse', 'who', 'supposedly', 'best', 'only', 'friend', 'far', 'home', 'Philly', 'can', 'hop', 'train', 'get', 'dance', 'horse', 'later', 'up', 'dance', 'prove', 'girl', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'lie', 'course', 'Bob', 'horse', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'way', 'school', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'fact', 'Kris', 'Kirstofferson', 'character', 'girl', 'having', 'natural', 'horse', 'sense', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'horse', 'not', 'only', 'wrong', 'side', 'up', 'facing', 'backwards', 'moral-', 'Your', 'human', 'friends', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'back', 'steal', 'boyfriend', 'try', 'embarass', 'formal', 'else', 'just', 'forget', 'when', 'move', 'away', 'horse', 'friend', 'will', 'come', 'rescue', ""'ll"", 'show', 'Nice', 'know', '2', 'young', 'nieces', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'annoyed', 'dumb', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommened', 'anyone', 'young', 'old']",Greening of Whitney Brown
