1349380,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003L20IGA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 2]","FILM RATING:  3.5 starsTo my surprise, Russell Crowe's latest film, The Next Three Days (2010), was a better than expected action/suspense ""heist/caper"" film. The trailer, and many critical reviews I've read, don't do it justice. But writer/director Paul Haggis came through here in my opinion with a gripping drama that starts slow, but builds the stakes to a good climax. It definitely reminded me of the now classic Harrison Ford vehicle, The Fugitive (1993). But it was a fresh twist on an old concept. It even has a bit of Enemy of the State (1998) and director Tony Scott's iconic style mixed in for good measure.The concept of The Next Three Days is pretty simple. It's a story about a family of three who are living the idyllic modern suburban lifestyle. Elizabeth Banks plays the mother, and seemingly the breadwinner, in the family. One morning, their calm house is stormed by the police and Banks' character is arrested and charged with murder of her female boss at work. The story pretty much jumps forward three years to where Banks is locked up in jail for life after being found guilty in court. Her husband, played by Russell Crowe, doesn't believe she's guilty for a minute, but they could never find evidence of her innocence or the actual killer to take the blame for the crime. Banks' character can't seem to deal with the loss of her life and attempts suicide, adding to the pressure that Crowe and their son already feel from their fractured family. So Crowe decides he has to break Banks out of jail. And he finds out exactly what thats going to take from ex-convict Liam Neeson. The rest of the plot goes where you are probably guessing it goes. So I'll let the film fill in the rest.I will say that some of the ""extraordinary"" (or coincidental) circumstances and events within the story make one suspend belief in order to really enjoy the film. Usually these kind of unrealistic and overly ""lucky"" sequence of events take me out of a film to a degree. But somehow, Haggis and Crowe and the rest of the cast and filmmakers pulled it off with this one. I can see how some film critics and viewers of the film might not let the far fetched conceits of the film work for them. But as I've written before, movies by definition are creating a ""fantastical"" world in which they exist. Every sci-fi or alien movie requires one to suspend belief to some degree. And just because The Next Three Days doesn't live in one of those genres, doesn't mean that it can't ask you to suspend your sense of realism. Enough said!There's no doubt in my mind that one of the key aspects of the success of The Next Three Days is Russell Crowe's performance. He plays a middle-aged, slightly overweight, married father quite well. And yet he also transforms during the course of the movie into a badass criminal. All at the same time he remains a caring father and loving husband. And I think it's that process of personal transformation with his character that makes the film interesting. The first hour of the film is a little too slow in that process maybe, but it does really build-up to the engaging third act of the movie. I think maybe the writing and editing could have been a little tighter to keep the movie moving along more. But after listening to an Apple ""Meet The Filmmaker"" podcast with director Paul Haggis defending his purposely slow build-up in the first half of the film, I can also buy into that philosophy. But I think if the film did have a little faster pace to it, it would elevate the film to higher level at least in my eyes. Nonetheless, this is a successful film and it works.The production values in The Next Three Days are really solid like so many films today. The cinematography from St&eacute;phane Fontaine is good, but nothing I haven't seen before. The production design by Laurence Bennett is also well done and gives us very realistic sets and locations for the story to take place in. Sound Editing led by Renee Tondelli is really well executed with a full array of surround sounds we all expect now in an action film of this type. And I was very impressed with Danny Elfman's music. He continues to shine and gives this film a better score than one like this typically gets. And I do think that is part of what helps elevate The Next Three Days above its peers like Unstoppable (2010).I missed seeing The Next Three Days in the theater last year, but it was a nice surprise seeing it in HD recently. I continue to be amazed at how much better many movies look at home on blu-ray or in HD than they do in the theater. The theaters really need to invest in modern digital projection technology and bring back the aura of the cineplex. While I can't make the direct comparison here, my intuition tells me that I didn't miss anything in this film's theatrical presentation. And I couldn't have asked for a better home theater presentation. The high definition mastering of this film is about as good as it gets. So give your living room an aural shake-up with The Next Three Days.",4,Surprised Me.

THE NEXT THREE DAYS may not have the quality of script of that previous success, but in this taut film Crowe once again reveals how completely involved in a character he can become.  The film was written by Fred Cavay&eacute;, Guillaume Lemans, and writer/director Paul Haggis and the result is a story that while it may appear incredible to most, it is nonetheless an involving story of a man's love and commitment to his wife.John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is a schoolteacher who has a happy home life with his beautiful wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and son Luke (Ty Simpson). After a strange night out on the town the Brennan's return home to be met by policemen who arrest Lara for a murder she claims she did not commit. Jump three years and John has been working with lawyers, spending their paltry savings, on getting appeals to get Lara released from jail. He gets moral support from his parents (Helen Carey and Brian Dennehy) but sees his family falling apart. After three years have passed and when all legal portals fail, Lara attempts suicide and John decides the only way to get Lara out of prison is to aid in her escape.  He visits writer Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson) who has escaped from prison several times and outlines the dangers AND the only secure methods for affecting a prison escape.  John slowly and methodically prepares for the escape, gaining money by contacting drug lord Mouss (RZA), commits some crimes of his own as he masterminds his plan to successfully extract Lara from prison.  There are many twists and turns to the story, well written subplots and unexpected coincidences, all populated with a very strong cast of capable actors.The real pleasure of watching this movie is to admire how totally committed Russell Crowe is to this role.  It is a very fine performance - one of his most subtle and best. THE NEXT THREE DAYS  is well worth watching.

An expertly blended drama and thriller it centers on a man coping with his wife having been arrested and convicted for a murder she did not commit. When it becomes evident that she will not be getting out through the legal system he sets out on a plan to break her out and evade capture.Director Paul Haggis (Crash) has crafted a film that feels real and remains grounded. In doing so the tension at times is ramped up to remarkable levels. The main reason for this is how the audience is taking that same emotional ride with the main character from start to end.The first half of the movie is very much a drama. John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is faced with hanging on to faint hope that his wife Laura (Elizabeth Banks) will be freed through the appeals process while raising their young son who is struggling with having lost his mother. As that hope disappears he begins planning to break her out.The important thing here to me was that Brennan is no expert on pulling something of this nature off. He doesn't have a genius mind and he certainly doesn't have any inside knowledge beyond some general advice he receives on the matter. It becomes a methodical process over a lengthy period of time with some trial and error involved.Then the second half takes an intense turn and becomes a thriller as the character becomes increasingly desperate and reaches the point of no return. That contrast and character development really sells the film completely. The reason why the tension was so high was because the audience had become completely invested in the outcome which remained in doubt until the very end.At just about 130 minutes I was surprised just how much had been packed in without ever feeling rushed. Haggis was able to pace it beautifully, allowing for that methodical-like buildup that would eventually result in enhancing the intensity of later scenes.This is one of the few movies in recent memory where I can say that it really put me on the edge of my seat. I literally felt my heart racing at times. The uncertainty of what was going to happen was incredibly refreshing.The performances from Crowe and Banks are excellent as they exhibited the subtlety of their emotions even when trying to shield that from each other. In the case of Crowe it was primarily that desperation bubbling up and with Banks it was having to try and accept the inevitability of her situation.There are several smaller roles and cameos from terrific actors. Liam Neeson, Brian Dennehy, and Lenny James are a few of the most prominent ones. Olivia Wilde felt a little underutilized however and that would be one of my very few issues with the film.The Next Three Days may very well be the best movie of 2010.

That's when an alarm went off in my head and my inner curmudgeon asked ""Where is the originality these days???"" And after watching this over-long and convoluted bore, I can't imagine the French movie being any better.On a positive note, this movie has a good cast- Russell Crowe, Elisabeth Banks, Liam Neeson and a few others. However, all but Neeson are horribly wooden in this film. It's unfortunate that Neeson only makes a cameo because his 5 minute performance had more emotion in it than anyone in the 130 minute duration of the movie. Russell Crowe goes about sounding like he is reading his lines off a sheet of paper, and Banks keeps the same monotone voice through the ENTIRE movie.I still am unsure of the movie's plot after seeing this disaster. Basically Crowe's wife is accused of murder, and the police arrest her as soon as she discovers the splattered blood on her jacket (seriously she didn't notice until just days after it happened?!?!?!?!). After battling the justice system for 3 years with no luck, she is sentenced to serve a life prison sentence in three days. Crowe, unable to find anything else to do, decides to bust her out of jail... and then the rest of the movie doesn't make much more sense.Well, I'm all for a wrongfully accused movie- one that makes you think, one that has the viewer on the edge of their seat, but this movie is so implausable I can't even begin to describe. My biggest problem being the movie's ending- it turns out she didn't do the crime, someone just bumped into her with blood on her, but we get what sounds like a clear confession in the middle during this exchange:Banks: ""You never even asked me if I did it!""Crowe: ""Because I knew you were innocent!""Banks: ""Well then you would have been wrong!""This somehow left me feeling at the end ""What...?"".Maybe it's that I'm getting older- I'm not a teenager anymore so therefore it's becoming easier to pick a movie apart- I understand what suspension of disbelief is, and I know what implausability is- the latter is what his movie flirts with. And plain and simple, if a movie is not believable in the least bit, I can't get into it. Let's also not forget them trying to get into Canada. A Canuck myself, Canadian officials are NOT as stupid as shown in the movie!!! Having been in almost every main airport, security would be able to detect a photoshopping job in a (fake) passport. Toronto and Montreal are especially hard on these.I wish I could recommend this movie but it is all too implausable and confusing. I haven't seen the French movie but I already don't plan to.

1349433,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B003L20IGA,RJ Smoove,"[0, 1]","The Next Three Days is Paul Haggis', director of the 2006 Best Picture, Crash, latest film. I'm not the plot summarizing type, but I'll give it a shot. It stars Russell Crowe as John Brennan, a perfect husband that finds himself lost in life once his wife, Laura (played by Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her boss, who she had a nasty argument with earlier in the very same day. Once she is arrested, which is early in the film, John goes through expected depression, and eventually arrives at the surprising conclusion to break her out. He then goes through the tedious (but you wouldn't tell from how swiftly the story moves along) process of planning, and preparation.The Next Three Days is an entertaining film. Not as complex as one might expect from a prison break movie, but if you're one who can suspend your disbelief, and just enjoy it for what it is, you should find a fun ride in this. Let's be honest, most movies are first and foremost: ENTERTAINMENT. Every detail does not need to be laid out. I respect a director who has enough confidence in his audience's intellect, that he leaves out some things to allow the pace to flow.Haggis does just that. Minor details like using a tennis ball to pick a car lock in a millisecond, or detectives that seem to be smarter and work a lot quicker than your average cop, are what force you to have to suspend you disbelief in order to really get into it. The suspense is quite thrilling. I had to remind myself that I wasn't a freaking Film Critic a couple of times, so that I could allow myself to have fun. But, all in all, I think the suspenseful and dramatic scenes hit the right emotions at the right times.They never really came off as bogus or cheesy to me. There are even a bunch of funny moments sprinkled throughout. It's like Bourne for married people. The shaky cam, quick outfit changes, dramatic movie kills and all make their appearance here. And all for the good. The script is tight.The musical score is good as well. I love that it was filmed on location in Pittsburgh and a later destination that will remain unidentified. What brings it down to me are the moments I mentioned above, when you're forced to suspend disbelief in order to accept some unrealistic things. That's such a huge deal in these kinds of movies, because the point is to make us feel like that could be us. Despite its flaws, I recommend it. Like I said, it's Bourne with older married people.

1349438,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B003L20IGA,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 4]","""The Next Three Days"" combines an involved caper story with a solid action thriller.  One morning, Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her boss.  She had argued with him the previous day and was seen by a co-worker at the scene of the crime.  Her fingerprints on the murder weapon and a blood stain on her raincoat add up to a strong case against her and she's found guilty and sent to prison.Her husband, John (Russell Crowe), never doubts that Lara is innocent, but goes through the legal appeals process to no avail.Desperate, John seeks out a man (Liam Neeson) who has written a book about his successful escape from prison.  After speaking with him, John comes to believe that the only way to free Lara is to arrange a prison break.  The film engages the viewer as John methodically plans to spring Lara and subsequently disappear.Director Paul Haggis has the problem of providing a lot of back story in limited screen time.  He succeeds by taking us quickly through the lenghthy appeals process and John's perseverance in a few brief scenes so the film can concentrate on John's planning the jail break.  Bonus extras include deleted and extended scenes, cast moments, a making-of short film, and the featurette ""True Escapes for Love.""",4,Interesting spin on a caper yarn,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,1267,"['Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'involved', 'caper', 'story', 'solid', 'action', 'thriller', 'One', 'morning', 'Lara', 'Brennan', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'arrested', 'murder', 'boss', 'had', 'argued', 'previous', 'day', 'was', 'seen', 'co-worker', 'scene', 'crime', 'fingerprints', 'murder', 'weapon', 'blood', 'stain', 'raincoat', 'add', 'up', 'strong', 'case', 'found', 'guilty', 'sent', 'prison.Her', 'husband', 'John', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'never', 'Lara', 'innocent', 'legal', 'appeals', 'process', 'avail.Desperate', 'John', 'out', 'man', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'successful', 'escape', 'prison', 'speaking', 'John', 'believe', 'only', 'way', 'free', 'Lara', 'arrange', 'prison', 'break', 'film', 'viewer', 'John', 'methodically', 'spring', 'Lara', 'subsequently', 'disappear.Director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'problem', 'providing', 'lot', 'back', 'story', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'taking', 'quickly', 'lenghthy', 'appeals', 'process', 'John', 'perseverance', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'film', 'can', 'concentrate', 'John', 'planning', 'jail', 'break', 'Bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'cast', 'moments', 'making-of', 'short', 'film', 'featurette', 'True', 'Escapes', 'Love']",N/A

1349447,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B003L20IGA,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 1]","In the unusual thriller ""The Next Three Days"" we follow a community college professor John Brennan(Russell Crowe)who is trying to break his innocent wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) out of the county jail before she is transferred to a maximum security prison. It appears from all the evidence that Lara who had a fight with her boss before going out to dinner with her husband, killed her boss.Based on the French film ""Pour Elle"" (titled ""Anything for Her"" in the United States), the script has the pacing and structure of what one would expect from a French thriller which compliments the material. By the conclusion however it shifts into an American thriller in overdrive. That's not necessarily a bad thing but the script is awkwardly structured at times with underdeveloped characters. Made for a surprisingly low budget (about $35 million), the film has a distinctive European thriller feel until the last 30 minutes where it becomes a more conventional American style thriller. I don't believe trimming it down to 90 minutes as some critics have suggested would have helped the film since the film would lose so many elements of the subplots as to make it more conventional and almost incoherent.SPOILERS:The film is unusual in that it focuses mostly on the efforts of Crowe's character in learning (from a former prisoner who has written a book about escapes played by Liam Neeson in a marvelous cameo)the nuts and bolts of how to escape, obtaining the money to escape, passports, etc. and his frustration has he comes up against both dead ends and potential leads that could help him without exposing his plan. We learn very little about whether or not Lara did it until much later in the movie. What's also unique about the film is that his character never tells his wife what he is planning for fear that she'll say no or that her knowledge might make her look suspicious and alter her behavior in jail.The film written and directed by Paul Haggis is far from perfect though as the subplot involving Detective Quinn (Jason Beghe a marvelous character actor who bring as much depth as he can to an underdeveloped character)the man that arrested Lara and his suspicions that John is up to something involving his wife are not very well developed and seem almost like an after thought. Likewise when Detective Collero (the marvelous and under used Aisha Hinds)is called in on a robbery of a meth house that seems to point to John the subplot again seems clumsy and doesn't fit with the carefully constructed story.END OF SPOILERS:The last half hour of the film rolls along at a breathtaking pace but, again, there are some details that are unbelievable and unless you totally buy into the film and are swept away by the plot you may not buy it.What sells the film are the performances by Crowe, Banks, Beghe, Hinds (introduced late in the film)in performances much better than the script itself. The terrific Brian Dennehy is wasted in a small role as John's father.The DVD looks quite nice although the dark, moody lighting suggests that this would probably look better with sharper detail on Blu-ray.",4,Solid unusual thriller focuses less on the escape and more on the challenges-distinctive European feel to thriller,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,3107,"['unusual', 'thriller', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'follow', 'community', 'college', 'professor', 'John', 'Brennan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'trying', 'break', 'innocent', 'wife', 'Lara', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'county', 'jail', 'transferred', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'evidence', 'Lara', 'who', 'had', 'fight', 'boss', 'going', 'dinner', 'husband', 'killed', 'boss.Based', 'French', 'film', 'Pour', 'Elle', 'titled', 'Anything', 'United', 'States', 'script', 'pacing', 'structure', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'French', 'thriller', 'material', 'conclusion', 'however', 'American', 'thriller', 'overdrive', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'script', 'awkwardly', 'structured', 'times', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'Made', 'surprisingly', 'low', 'budget', '35', 'million', 'film', 'distinctive', 'European', 'thriller', 'feel', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'where', 'more', 'conventional', 'American', 'style', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'trimming', '90', 'minutes', 'critics', 'have', 'suggested', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'lose', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'subplots', 'make', 'more', 'conventional', 'almost', 'incoherent.SPOILERS', 'film', 'unusual', 'mostly', 'efforts', 'Crowe', 'character', 'learning', 'former', 'prisoner', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'escapes', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'marvelous', 'cameo', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'how', 'escape', 'obtaining', 'money', 'escape', 'passports', 'etc', 'frustration', 'up', 'dead', 'ends', 'potential', 'leads', 'could', 'help', 'exposing', 'plan', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'not', 'Lara', 'did', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'What', 'also', 'unique', 'film', 'character', 'never', 'wife', 'what', 'planning', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'say', 'knowledge', 'might', 'make', 'look', 'suspicious', 'alter', 'behavior', 'jail.The', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'far', 'perfect', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Detective', 'Quinn', 'Jason', 'Beghe', 'marvelous', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'bring', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'can', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'man', 'arrested', 'Lara', 'suspicions', 'John', 'up', 'something', 'involving', 'wife', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'seem', 'almost', 'thought', 'Likewise', 'when', 'Detective', 'Collero', 'marvelous', 'used', 'Aisha', 'Hinds', 'called', 'robbery', 'meth', 'house', 'point', 'John', 'subplot', 'again', 'clumsy', ""n't"", 'fit', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'story.END', 'SPOILERS', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'rolls', 'along', 'breathtaking', 'pace', 'again', 'are', 'details', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'totally', 'buy', 'film', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'buy', 'it.What', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'Crowe', 'Banks', 'Beghe', 'Hinds', 'introduced', 'late', 'film', 'performances', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'terrific', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'wasted', 'small', 'role', 'John', 'father.The', 'DVD', 'quite', 'nice', 'dark', 'moody', 'lighting', 'would', 'probably', 'look', 'better', 'sharper', 'detail', 'Blu-ray']",N/A
