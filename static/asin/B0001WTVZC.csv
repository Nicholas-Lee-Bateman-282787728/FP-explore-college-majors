815134,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B0001WTVZC,Leonard,"[1, 1]","Paris is one of my favorite cities. It's not quite as cool as London, but it's a beautiful city. Too bad the Globe Trekker host was a miserable sociopath. My first complaint was that there were no subtitles. I guess they assumed that everyone who watched this video speaks French. My second complaint was that part of the video was in a cooking class. Why? If I wanted to learn how to cook, I'd watch Rachael Ray. This video was supposed to be about famous attractions in Paris.I initially liked the trip to the African market, as well as the interview with that guy from Ghana. However, Justine referred to something in the market as a snail penis. She obviously didn't care that young children with an interest in geography may be watching this. Later on, she tacitly referred to the dog excrement on the sidewalk. She even went as far as saying that a fountain looked like it was ejaculating. I was thinking to myself, what is this woman's problem? Justine also said that French people were snobs. Based on her interactions in this video, it seemed like people hated her as much as she hated them.The Louvre is a nice museum. It's not quite as nice as the British Museum, but it's ornate. Eurodisney was ok, not great. There was a beautiful park that she rushed through. It seemed like Justine wasn't too enthusiastic about visiting Paris. I gave this DVD a 2 because it simply contained too many interesting sites to warrant a 1, but this video would've been so much better if Justine wasn't the host.",2,The City of Lights Deserves a Better Host,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,1505,"['Paris', 'one', 'favorite', 'cities', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'cool', 'London', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Too', 'bad', 'Globe', 'Trekker', 'host', 'was', 'miserable', 'sociopath', 'first', 'complaint', 'was', 'were', 'subtitles', 'guess', 'assumed', 'everyone', 'who', 'watched', 'video', 'French', 'second', 'complaint', 'was', 'part', 'video', 'was', 'cooking', 'class', 'Why', 'wanted', 'learn', 'how', 'cook', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Rachael', 'Ray', 'video', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'famous', 'attractions', 'Paris.I', 'initially', 'liked', 'trip', 'African', 'market', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'guy', 'Ghana', 'However', 'Justine', 'referred', 'something', 'market', 'snail', 'penis', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'young', 'children', 'interest', 'geography', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'Later', 'tacitly', 'referred', 'dog', 'excrement', 'sidewalk', 'even', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'saying', 'fountain', 'looked', 'was', 'ejaculating', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', 'what', 'woman', 'problem', 'Justine', 'also', 'said', 'French', 'people', 'were', 'snobs', 'Based', 'interactions', 'video', 'seemed', 'people', 'hated', 'as', 'much', 'hated', 'them.The', 'Louvre', 'nice', 'museum', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'nice', 'British', 'Museum', 'ornate', 'Eurodisney', 'was', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'beautiful', 'park', 'rushed', 'seemed', 'Justine', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'enthusiastic', 'visiting', 'Paris', 'gave', 'DVD', '2', 'simply', 'contained', 'too', 'many', 'interesting', 'sites', 'warrant', '1', 'video', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Justine', 'was', ""n't"", 'host']",Globe Trekker: Paris

I learned a few things from her.  I learned that Paris cab drivers are crooks who will take you all over town and inflate your fare, and they basically admit it by offering to negotiate the fee.  That's despicable and the town really should fix this problem.  I also learned that there is dog excrement all over the streets of Paris so you better watch your step.I learned that they charge different prices for some items, depending on whether you are male or female, and depending on if you are smiling.  That's also sickening.  I don't plan to visit Paris.There was nothing in this video that made me want to see this town.

It doesn't work here. Why does she interview a bunch of other Americans when touring Paris? Couldn't she interact with some LOCAL FRENCH PEOPLE? Oh, and forget about going inside the Louvre, Napoleon's tomb, or the Bastille. Instead we get to tour the African neighborhoods of Paris!

815138,A326BYJNA17NB1,B0001WTVZC,Paul Beauparlant,"[4, 4]","An interesting ride within the train that travels beneath the English channel on its way to Paris begins this film. You can buy a round trip ticket for as low as $125.Once in the city I found the visit to the Paris underground subway system ""The Metro"" to be very interesting.Several things I found unnecessary included a kitchen food preparation excersize at the Cordon Bleu, a visit to Paris Disneyland, a show at the nightclub The Lido and a visit to a African community in Paris.....while skipping a tour of the hillside district Montmartre is not even mentioned?The film ends with almost an afterthought as we get to go inside and up the steps of the Eiffel Tower. This was very nice as you can almost reach out and touch the structural beams and practically smell the paint, but again, it was not enough. A short tour of The Louvre was okay, not really enough though. I agree with some other reviewers wishing someone else rather than Justine Shapiro had been the guide for this travelogue. And the people she meets along the way I didn't really care for except for the cabdriver who I thought was interesting. So overall I give this a rating of 3 stars. I would think there MUST be better guides out there",3,some interesting things,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,1212,"['interesting', 'ride', 'train', 'English', 'channel', 'way', 'Paris', 'film', 'can', 'buy', 'round', 'trip', 'ticket', 'as', 'low', '125.Once', 'city', 'found', 'visit', 'Paris', 'underground', 'subway', 'system', 'Metro', 'be', 'very', 'interesting.Several', 'things', 'found', 'unnecessary', 'included', 'kitchen', 'food', 'preparation', 'excersize', 'Cordon', 'Bleu', 'visit', 'Paris', 'Disneyland', 'show', 'nightclub', 'Lido', 'visit', 'African', 'community', 'Paris', '..while', 'skipping', 'tour', 'hillside', 'district', 'Montmartre', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'film', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'get', 'go', 'inside', 'up', 'steps', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'can', 'almost', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'structural', 'beams', 'practically', 'smell', 'paint', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'A', 'short', 'tour', 'Louvre', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wishing', 'someone', 'else', 'rather', 'Justine', 'Shapiro', 'had', 'been', 'guide', 'travelogue', 'people', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'cabdriver', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'overall', 'give', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'think', 'MUST', 'be', 'better', 'guides', 'there']",Globe Trekker: Paris
