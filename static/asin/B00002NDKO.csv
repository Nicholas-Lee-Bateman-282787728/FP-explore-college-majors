515162,A2U2K57OFWD1CA,B00002NDKO,A. Clark,"[5, 5]","I decided to finally buy this DVD for myself - it is truly an indulgence to be able to watch it as many times as I like to!!  This love story set in Ireland in 1937 is so beautiful and poignant. Liam Cunningham as Mossie Sheehan shines in probably one of the most compelling and touching performances I've seen by an actor as a man in the throes of unrequited love.  His understated acting was so powerful with its underlying smoldering sensuality - I fell in love with him myself.  Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh as the unhappy Beth was just outstanding - her passion and love of life cut short by a mistake that had dire consequences and equally dire solutions in 1937 Ireland where women's rights were practically unheard of.  The acting of the entire cast of this movie - the children, the townspeople, her parents, was just so outstanding.  Put this story with its fine cast of actors into the most beautiful country ever seen (I had the privilege of visiting both No. Ireland and the Rep. of Ireland just recently) and you have a treasured classic to be enjoyed just for the sheer pleasure of falling in love again every time you watch it.  My only negative about this movie was it ended too quickly - when Mossie finally revealed his feelings to Beth - I think that deserved a very passionate kiss, which we didn't see - but hopefully happened !!!",5,a beautiful treasure of a movie,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1346,"['decided', 'finally', 'buy', 'DVD', 'truly', 'indulgence', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'like', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'Ireland', '1937', 'so', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'Mossie', 'Sheehan', 'shines', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'touching', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actor', 'man', 'throes', 'unrequited', 'love', 'understated', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'underlying', 'smoldering', 'sensuality', 'fell', 'love', 'Elisabeth', 'Dermot-Walsh', 'unhappy', 'Beth', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding', 'passion', 'love', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'mistake', 'had', 'dire', 'consequences', 'equally', 'dire', 'solutions', '1937', 'Ireland', 'where', 'women', 'rights', 'were', 'practically', 'unheard', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'movie', 'children', 'townspeople', 'parents', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'outstanding', 'Put', 'story', 'fine', 'cast', 'actors', 'most', 'beautiful', 'country', 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'privilege', 'visiting', 'No', 'Ireland', 'Rep.', 'Ireland', 'just', 'recently', 'have', 'treasured', 'classic', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'falling', 'love', 'again', 'time', 'watch', 'My', 'only', 'negative', 'movie', 'was', 'ended', 'too', 'quickly', 'when', 'Mossie', 'finally', 'revealed', 'feelings', 'Beth', 'think', 'deserved', 'very', 'passionate', 'kiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hopefully', 'happened']",Falling for a Dancer VHS

Elizabeth - strong yet vulnerable and so very unhappy. But determined to make her life work as best she can given the limitations of life for women (not to mention unwed pregnant girls)in 1930's Ireland.  Mossie Sheehan, played so heartbreakingly beautifully by Liam Cunningham, will make you want to weep.  He falls for Elizabeth immediately, but cannot act on it.  Her parents have married her to his estranged cousin Neely (they feud over land) an older widower far from a good and loving husband or father.  Her step children - particularly Katie who is doomed to repeat Elizabeth's mistakes - who come to love and respect her as their mother.  Elizabeth longs to experience the things all 25 year old women want.  Fun, flirting, passion.  And she gets it with Daniel McCarthy a boy Katie's age who tragically decides that he is in love with Elizabeth.  Mayhem and death ensue.  When Mossie finally declares his true feelings to Elizabeth you just want to cry.  He's so beautifully sweet!  Yes, make the investment.  It is a sometimes dark, sometimes unpleasant, but honest look at rural life.  But there is a definite pay-off in the end.  My only complaint is with the last line in the film.

This is the very young man, 6 years younger than the heroine, who becomes infatuated with her, the woman also shown on the box.  This young man,  however, is not the hero of this video series.  The hero is a man who is in  conflict with her brutal drunk of a husband, over a piece of land that  should have come to the hero by inheritance, but went to the drunk instead.  This man, Mossie, is also very attractive so why his image wasn't used on  the video box is unknown.  The heroine is forced into marriage with this  much-older brute by her family, since she is about to become an unwed  mother by a long-gone actor in 1937 Ireland. She lived in the city with her  prosperous family but moves to her husband's village, where everyone barely  ekes out a living on the rocky land by the sea. She also must raise the  many children her husband had with his late wife.  Some viewers may be put  off by two violent scenes between the drunken husband and wife.  The first  is a rape scene, which is rough going.  In the second, her son is hurt  which cuts off the violence between them.  If you can handle the rape scene  though, the rest of the series is very enjoyable, well done, and happily  resolved and should provide a good evening's entertainment.

Mossie who has always loved her since the day he saw her on her wedding day to Neely, a much older  abusive man she doesn't love but marries rather than give her unborn child by an actor up for adoption. She is faced with his children whom she has grown to love as her own.  At a dance her sexually is aroused by the handsome young Danny played by the dashing Dubliner Colin Farrell. Tragedy follows because of this flirtation and when the handsome Danny asked her to run off with him to America she says no. This is the only part of the movie for a moment I stared at in disbelief. If someone as handsome as Colin Farrell asked you to run off with him, honey this Grandma would set the record for packing. I realized the one man who has always loved her Mossie will find his voice and tell her.

The film is very dark being filmed beautifully on the coast of Ireland in a bleak area where it seems to rain all of the time.  The heroine, Beth (acted wonderfully by Elizabeth Dermot-Walsh) has become pregnant by a touring actor much to the horror (it is 1937) of her parents especially her ""tight-lipped"" and no doubt frigid mother.  Although her father's objects (had to please her mom) she is married off to a much older widower with (I believe) five (5) kids that includes ""a babe in arms"".  The widower (played greatly by Richard Standeven) is not too nice to her,once they are to themselves on the coast of Ireland--he's very possessive of Beth and not very loving.  She seeks attention at a dance from a very young man which makes her widower husband completely furious.  Lurking on the hill outside of their home is her husband's sexy male cousin that works for him--they don't care for each other very much.  Although Beth has many obstacles and nightmarish occurrences to deal with, she proves to be a very strong and courageous woman indeed finding true love eventually.This film could have dissolved into a weepy soap-opera; however it does NOT become weepy at all because it is so well written, directed and acted.

515174,A2M8RJC04LQHEC,B00002NDKO,Margaret M. Duffy,"[10, 25]","First of all, I want to say that this movie was shot on the Beara peninsula in southwestern Ireland, not anywhere near Dingle, which is miles and miles away.  How do I know that?  I know it because Beara is my mother's birthplace and I have spent many months living there during my life.  In fact, the ""farm"" location of this picture is only about a quarter mile from my own.  The village (with all the modern elements painted out) is our village of Eyeries.  The graveyard by the sea is the old cemetery of Kilcatherine.That said I found this movie to be a very run-of-the-mill romantic melodrama in, what must be for most viewers, an exoctic locale.  Some of the acting was good, some was dreadful.  The best job was done by Liam Cunningham in the role of Mossie Sheehan.  I found his portrayal of the silently yearning and misunderstood neighbor to be quite wonderful.  And, he captured the rather difficult Beara accent beautifully.  Most of the other actors are adequate, though no more.  I found the heroine, played by Elizabeth Dermot-Walsh, to be barely believable in her role.  Some of the plot is so inconsistent as to really puzzle.And the saddest thing about this movie is the use made of some of the most glorious scenery this world has to offer.  Beara is a peninsula with a thick spine of mountain, surrounded by the ocean (Bantry Bay to the south, Kenmare Bay to the north).  Most of the movie seems to have been shot toward the mountains and in the rain.  There are very few scenes shot in good weather and only a few glimpses of the astonishing vista over the ocean (during the burial of Neillie Scholard) and the morning when Beth talks to her daughter about how beautiful the day is.

Elizabeth's life is turned upside down when she becomes pregnant, and has no idea where the father has gone.  Social restrictions leave Elizabeth with two unappealing choices: Admittance into a Magdalene convent or marriage to a farmer twice her age whom she has never met.  She chooses the latter and is determined to make the best of it, but the harsh, cold, and desolate landscape of her new home is a metaphor for the fate of her marriage.  Her husband Neely, is very possesive and treats her like a piece of property. He is particularly leary of his Cousin/ Neighbor, Mossie,  who he calls a ""Land Grabber"".  They have been fueding for years over the ownership of family property which also gives way to Neely's fearful possesiveness over Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Dermot Walsh gives a fantastic performance as the fictional Elizabeth, who has been so severely beat down yet stays incredibly strong throughout all the tragic twists and turns of her life.  The most impressive scene is towards the end when Elizabeth kneels at the grave of her stepdaughter and blames herself for her death. That point is the culmination of so many emotions. It shows how Elizabeth has given all she can to rectify herself for all the wrong-doing she feels responsibility toward, but at this point feels she has failed.  The acting is very powerfull in this scene.I am giving four stars only because I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. It is sad right up until the end, then there is an admition of love and bam -- a wedding and happy ending.  I feel like if you are going to make a movie four hours long there is no reason for an abrupt ending.This is a fantastic movie for anyone with an interest in women's studies, social influences, period films, or you just want to see a good old fashioned tale of a person rising above so many adversities.  If you like this movie, a good supplement would be ""The Magdalene Sisters"". It will show you what would have been in store for Elizabeth had she admitted herself into the Magdalene Convent. It is not for the faint of heart though, as it is much more brutal and depressing. It will make you angry, but will give valuable insight into the bleak choices that faced Elizabeth in Falling for a Dancer.",4,A woman's rise above so many adversities,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2493,"['heartbreaking', 'epic', 'tale', 'difficult', 'road', 'young', 'woman', 'must', 'travel', 'when', 'rules', 'social', 'acceptance', 'hard', 'modern', 'young', 'woman', 'fathom', 'mere', 'seventy', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'fate', 'unwed', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'pregnant', 'idea', 'where', 'father', 'gone', 'Social', 'restrictions', 'leave', 'Elizabeth', 'two', 'unappealing', 'choices', 'Admittance', 'Magdalene', 'convent', 'marriage', 'farmer', 'twice', 'age', 'whom', 'never', 'met', 'latter', 'determined', 'make', 'best', 'harsh', 'cold', 'desolate', 'landscape', 'new', 'home', 'metaphor', 'fate', 'marriage', 'husband', 'Neely', 'very', 'possesive', 'piece', 'property', 'particularly', 'leary', 'Cousin/', 'Neighbor', 'Mossie', 'who', 'Land', 'Grabber', 'have', 'been', 'fueding', 'years', 'ownership', 'family', 'property', 'also', 'way', 'Neely', 'fearful', 'possesiveness', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'Dermot', 'Walsh', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'fictional', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'severely', 'beat', 'down', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'tragic', 'twists', 'turns', 'life', 'most', 'impressive', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'kneels', 'grave', 'stepdaughter', 'death', 'point', 'culmination', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'how', 'Elizabeth', 'given', 'can', 'rectify', 'wrong-doing', 'responsibility', 'point', 'failed', 'acting', 'very', 'powerfull', 'scene.I', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'only', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'sad', 'right', 'end', 'then', 'admition', 'love', 'bam', 'wedding', 'happy', 'ending', 'feel', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'reason', 'abrupt', 'ending.This', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interest', 'women', 'studies', 'social', 'influences', 'period', 'films', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'tale', 'person', 'rising', 'so', 'many', 'adversities', 'like', 'movie', 'good', 'supplement', 'would', 'be', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'will', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'store', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'admitted', 'Magdalene', 'Convent', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'though', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'depressing', 'will', 'make', 'angry', 'will', 'give', 'valuable', 'insight', 'bleak', 'choices', 'faced', 'Elizabeth', 'Falling', 'Dancer']",Falling for a Dancer VHS
