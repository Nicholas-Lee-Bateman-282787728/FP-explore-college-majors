757816,A1FM6UCH6HMKOC,B00009VPHM,"Phil Muse ""Phil""","[12, 12]","Not just a delightful comedy, but a movie with real heart, ""Molly and Me"" gives us the chance to see both Gracie Fields and Monty Wooley at something like the top of their form. Fields is really a welcome treat, since she made all-too few movies in Hollywood. We can see why this ordinary-looking woman, who looked less like one's common notion of a ""film star"" than anyone I can think of, holds such a special place in the affection of Britons that they always referred to her as ""Our Gracie."" She could really bring a picture to life! Her rapport with co-star Monty Wooley is quite noticeable. The little song they break into at the end of the picture, ending with the line ""Don't stop breathing 'til you're dead,"" is so catchy I found myself singing it at odd moments for days afterwards. The supporting cast - especially Reginald Gardiner, Edith Barrett, and Natalie Schafer - are first-rate. Picture and sound quality are both good enough that we don't lament the absence of subtitles. (By the way, we are overdue for a home video release of the other comedy in which Fields and Wooley co-starred, ""Holy Matrimony."" Hey TCF, don't be sluggards!)",4,Great opportunity to experience Grace Fields & Monty Wooley,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,1150,"['Not', 'just', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'movie', 'real', 'heart', 'Molly', 'Me', 'chance', 'see', 'Gracie', 'Fields', 'Monty', 'Wooley', 'something', 'top', 'form', 'Fields', 'really', 'welcome', 'treat', 'made', 'all-too', 'few', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'ordinary-looking', 'woman', 'who', 'looked', 'less', 'one', 'common', 'notion', 'film', 'star', 'anyone', 'can', 'think', 'special', 'place', 'affection', 'Britons', 'always', 'referred', 'Gracie', 'could', 'really', 'bring', 'picture', 'life', 'rapport', 'co-star', 'Monty', 'Wooley', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'little', 'song', 'break', 'end', 'picture', 'ending', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'breathing', ""'re"", 'dead', 'so', 'catchy', 'found', 'singing', 'odd', 'moments', 'days', 'afterwards', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Reginald', 'Gardiner', 'Edith', 'Barrett', 'Natalie', 'Schafer', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'lament', 'absence', 'subtitles', 'way', 'are', 'overdue', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'other', 'comedy', 'Fields', 'Wooley', 'co-starred', 'Holy', 'Matrimony', 'Hey', 'TCF', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sluggards']",Molly and Me 1945-USA  VHS
