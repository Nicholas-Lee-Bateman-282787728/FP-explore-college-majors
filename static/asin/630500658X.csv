However, it is also one of the funniest movies I have ever seen cause it is so stupid. It's one of those movies where you expect either a dopy kids movie or a good Disney movie, then when you watch it you're all, ""STUUUUPID"" and roll on the floor laughing...cause you can't believe all the stupid stuff that's going on. And the lousy plot just made it even more funny. By the way, this was probably the only movie Paul Walker was actually good in cause he didn't have to act which seems to be his talent so it fit his surfing image purfect. Very funny but sadly overlooked when it came out so it's even hard to come accross someone who saw it. Oh, it has a bit of crude humor that wasn't needed in such a dopey film, especially one made for kids. But I personaly think young adults would have more fun with this film than kids or adults 30+.

When you look at it from that perspective you realize that's exactly what they did  and they achieved it very well.I found movie to be hilarious.

This movie wasn't really a big hit, which is a shame because most people I know that have seen it have enjoyed it.  I myself enjoy it every time.  Stu and Phil are two surf bums who are kicked off the Hawaiian islands to go to a sort of informal boot camp.  Through a chain of comical events, they end up instead at Yellowstone National Park with jobs as park rangers.  Of course they know nothing about the outdoors but try to fake out the rest of the park staff.  They are hired to get rid of the park's prairie dog problem before the Geyser Old Faithful celebrates it's billionth birthday.  They take unconventional approaches to solving the problem but are found out before they can implement their solution.  Can the Deedles get back in Yellowstone's goode graces and return to Hawaii feeling they can bring some pride to the old man?  You'll have to see, but I must say bringing Yellowstone and Hawaii together with two cute guys who have no problem acting like goofballs equals lots of fun and lots of laughs. :)",5,"Laughable, Quotable, fun movie",1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1117,"['kind', 'movie', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'late', 'night', 'when', 'everything', 'funny', 'anyway', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'big', 'hit', 'shame', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'enjoy', 'time', 'Stu', 'Phil', 'are', 'two', 'surf', 'bums', 'who', 'are', 'kicked', 'Hawaiian', 'islands', 'go', 'sort', 'informal', 'boot', 'camp', 'chain', 'comical', 'events', 'end', 'up', 'instead', 'Yellowstone', 'National', 'Park', 'jobs', 'park', 'rangers', 'course', 'know', 'nothing', 'outdoors', 'try', 'fake', 'out', 'rest', 'park', 'staff', 'are', 'hired', 'get', 'rid', 'park', 'prairie', 'dog', 'problem', 'Geyser', 'Old', 'Faithful', 'billionth', 'birthday', 'take', 'unconventional', 'approaches', 'solving', 'problem', 'are', 'found', 'out', 'can', 'implement', 'solution', 'Can', 'Deedles', 'get', 'back', 'Yellowstone', 'goode', 'graces', 'return', 'Hawaii', 'feeling', 'can', 'bring', 'pride', 'old', 'man', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'must', 'say', 'bringing', 'Yellowstone', 'Hawaii', 'together', 'two', 'cute', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'problem', 'acting', 'goofballs', 'equals', 'lots', 'fun', 'lots', 'laughs']",N/A

So I ordered it on VHS with 2-day shipping and I was excited at it's arrival. The movie plays excellent and unlike some of the whiners on here with their low-star reviews, I found the movie to be instantly hilarious on every scene. Phil and Stew Deedle are two brothers that have skipped school in Hawaii too often to go out on the beach, and when their school expels them, their disappointed father sends them to Wyoming for a month with the intent that his Vietnam buddy, Major Flower, can straighten them out at his place, Camp Broken Spirit. The brothers aren't too excited for this trip and can barely even know where Wyoming is.PHIL: So, Wyoming...that's on Molokai, right?STEW: No, dude, that would be on the mainland.Major Flower, a heavyset, bearded freak of a guy, also reveals their worst fears by admitting that he no longer even has the camp. ""I lost it last month to the DANG parents and their SCUMBAG lawyers!"" But while on a trip to learn his technique of survival training, their truck takes a spill off a road, runs down a campsite where two ladies that just got accepted to Ranger training at Yellowstone are staying at, and taking all their clothes, and the guys are separated from the Major by being dumped in the river. Wearing the ladies clothes to keep dry, both brothers go on an extreme ride on longboards and crash their way into Yellowstone, where they're mistaken for the Ranger recruits, but not only that, as extreme environmentalists who eat and live off the land and experts at solving their prairie-dog infestation problem.Phil is reluctant to pose as a Ranger recruit, but is soon eager to go through the pose to get the attention of the very-hot Lieutenant Jesse and win her affections. Meanwhile, the plot unfolds behind the matter of the prairie-dog situation with an ex-Ranger living underground, his cohorts, and their plans to use the prairie-dogs to build a massive tunnel under the park and diverting the power of the geyser ""Old Faithful"" on her billionth birthday through an extinct geyser on his own land and making his own famed park in the end. And it seems like the two beach bums are the only ones that can stop him, despite the growing annoyance of their superior, Captain Pine.This movie is VERY excellent and hilarious in every minute of each scene!
