They have a great storyline with a twisted triangle and intense power struggles but the filming is so choppy that one scene ends and the next begins, sometimes with no connection.  The scenes do not blend into each other, forming a movie that is pleasant to watch.  This movie jumps from one place to another that seems to contradict but with no explanation of the change.  One scene the main girl is wildly in love with her husband, is forgiving of the king's adulterous intentions and is supremely happy.  Shortly thereafter, she wants revenge on every person she's ever met. Yes, she was betrayed, in a way, but not by EVERYone.  The only real high point of the movie is Timothy Dalton, who is a great actor, but this was a lousy setting for his talent.  Also, considering the plot of the movie, there were no intimate scenes.  The only thing that happens in the bedroom is the king beats the girl and he nurses her back from smallpox.  All in all, this story had great potential that was sadly wasted in this movie.",2,Could be such a great movie...,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,1052,"['sadly', 'way', 'short', 'have', 'great', 'storyline', 'twisted', 'triangle', 'intense', 'power', 'struggles', 'filming', 'so', 'choppy', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'begins', 'sometimes', 'connection', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'blend', 'other', 'forming', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'place', 'contradict', 'explanation', 'change', 'One', 'scene', 'main', 'girl', 'wildly', 'love', 'husband', 'forgiving', 'king', 'adulterous', 'intentions', 'supremely', 'happy', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'revenge', 'person', 'ever', 'met', 'Yes', 'was', 'betrayed', 'way', 'not', 'EVERYone', 'only', 'real', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'who', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'lousy', 'setting', 'talent', 'Also', 'considering', 'plot', 'movie', 'were', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'only', 'thing', 'bedroom', 'king', 'girl', 'back', 'smallpox', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'was', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'movie']",N/A

Oh, but what a pleasant surprise!  Timothy Dalton, playing the 17th century King of Piedmont, and Valeria Golino, the countess, who's the object of his desire, were absolutely wonderful.  One couldn't help but fall in love with Valeria, with that sexy accent, those eyes, heaving breasts and meaty behind (seen for 5 seconds when the King pummels her with his fists in a fit of rage, after she coldly claims they just had sex and NOT lovemaking).Valeria is totally devoted to her husband, yet the King has an obsession with her and makes it quite public where even the pregnant Valeria is taken from the midst of a service to be told by the priests that her future sins for allowing the King to covet her are already forgiven.  Afterall, the King is ill with  lustful thoughts that only she can cure, and Valeria must serve her King.  At first, we shake our heads at the King for actually wanting what he can't have, but he makes it clear he will not force her.  ""You will come to me willingly,"" he tells her.  Everyone, including her husband, beg her to submit so they can all get on with their lives at her expense.  And when she does, she certainly ""helps"" them to get on with their lives.If the film fails, I'd have to say I can't recall a period film where the King takes orders so nonchanantly and easily, instead of dishing them out.  But then again, love makes you do crazy stuff.  Though a weak King, we get a sense of his soft heart.  Loyal to his true love through infectious sickness and in health, you can't help but be incredibly jealous of Valeria.  I mean, who wouldn't want a man like that.  But will she continue to hate him with a passion and forever try her darnest to remain as cold as ice, and to escape his bed?Definitely worth the money, but don't expect steamy sex.  In fact, there's hardly any, yet the anticipation is quite a handful.  One look in both their eyes and you can feel their emotions, whether it be love or scorn.  The DVD cover is quite attractive and reminds me of ""Boxing Helena"", another film with a dominant theme of obsessive love.  I give it four stars.  Take away half for the King being too weak at times, publicly.",4,Obsession or true love?,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2295,"['cost', '6', 'expected', 'atrocity', 'bumbling', 'actors', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'wigs', 'huge', 'fake', 'moles', 'glued', 'Oh', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'playing', '17th', 'century', 'King', 'Piedmont', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'countess', 'who', 'object', 'desire', 'were', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'One', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'Valeria', 'sexy', 'accent', 'eyes', 'heaving', 'breasts', 'meaty', 'seen', '5', 'seconds', 'when', 'King', 'pummels', 'fists', 'fit', 'rage', 'coldly', 'just', 'had', 'sex', 'NOT', 'lovemaking', '.Valeria', 'totally', 'devoted', 'husband', 'King', 'obsession', 'quite', 'public', 'where', 'even', 'pregnant', 'Valeria', 'taken', 'midst', 'service', 'be', 'told', 'priests', 'future', 'sins', 'allowing', 'King', 'covet', 'are', 'already', 'forgiven', 'Afterall', 'King', 'ill', 'lustful', 'thoughts', 'only', 'can', 'cure', 'Valeria', 'must', 'serve', 'King', 'first', 'shake', 'heads', 'King', 'actually', 'wanting', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'force', 'will', 'come', 'willingly', 'Everyone', 'including', 'husband', 'beg', 'submit', 'can', 'get', 'lives', 'expense', 'when', 'certainly', 'helps', 'get', 'lives.If', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'period', 'film', 'where', 'King', 'orders', 'so', 'nonchanantly', 'easily', 'instead', 'dishing', 'out', 'then', 'again', 'love', 'do', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'weak', 'King', 'get', 'sense', 'soft', 'heart', 'Loyal', 'true', 'love', 'infectious', 'sickness', 'health', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'incredibly', 'jealous', 'Valeria', 'mean', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'man', 'will', 'continue', 'hate', 'passion', 'forever', 'try', 'darnest', 'remain', 'as', 'cold', 'ice', 'escape', 'bed', 'Definitely', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'steamy', 'sex', 'fact', 'hardly', 'anticipation', 'quite', 'handful', 'One', 'look', 'eyes', 'can', 'feel', 'emotions', 'be', 'love', 'scorn', 'DVD', 'cover', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'film', 'dominant', 'theme', 'obsessive', 'love', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Take', 'away', 'half', 'King', 'being', 'too', 'weak', 'times', 'publicly']",N/A

True, he was obsessed with her and tried to manipulate her into this relationship.  But no matter how it is presented, SHE was the one who made the decision to go to him.  On the first night with him she was obviously more than cooperative, refusing the offer of a change of clothing and disrobing in front of him willingly.  She seemed intent on using him to the max. You think their first encounter is blissful but you see the King's happiness begin to fade as she begins to outline her ""requests""; she wants him to dismiss her husband's family from court, his minister she wants exiled, the home she shared with her husband she wants destroyed so no one else can ever live in it.  You name it she asks him for it.  He gives in to every one of her demands.  We see her in his bed being coquetteish and manipulating him.  Then when he makes overtures toward her, she becomes livid.  He doesn't understand what is happening to him since he has never had nor wanted a mistress before.  Now he finds himself consumed with his need for this woman to the point of striking her when she refuses his advances.  (You just know this King has never struck a woman before in his life)  But she's all he can think about; he needs to know where she is every minute.It becomes obvious this King does love her when she contracts smallpox.  He takes total care of her, applying balms, bathing her, staying with her night and day to keep her from scratching herself so she won't be scarred for life.  Still, this is definitely an unhealthy relationship.  Women in those days married and had trysts with men who meant nothing to them all the time because they had no control over their lives.  The men in charge (fathers, etc.) made those decisions for them and they followed whatever path was laid out for them.  Doesn't mean it was right, but that is the way women were treated.  Therefore, it is difficult to relate to her rage increasing as the relationship becomes more intense.  She becomes as obsessed with getting free of hiim as he is with keeping her.  This even seems to have become a love/hate kind of game between them.  By now we are sure she loves him even though she is unwilling or unable to show it.  Meanwhile, she is constantly given and accepts jewelry, art, clothing -- whatever she wants and then some, but does not give him any real pleasure in return as far as can be determined.  This review is muddled I know but so are the emotions in this film.  In the meantime, Timothy Dalton is absolutely gorgeous.  Definitely at his peak in every way.  I am not impressed with the Countess.  I think she was miscast and not nearly pretty enough to have this obsesssion be believable...Why do I love this film???

He plays the King of Piedmont, who develops an inexplicable passion for a rather tiresome French countess.  She, however, is devoted to her rather wet husband and wants nothing to do with the King, which shows from the beginning that she has deplorable taste.  However, her husband's family want her to give into the King because he is making everyone's lives a misery moping about, and when in the end she realises even her husband wants her to give in to him, she agrees to become the King's mistress.  She proceeds to revenge herself on her husband's family by having them banished to their family estate, but keeps her husband around to act as a lackey. Although the King is crazy about her, she still insists she doesn't love him, until in the end he loses his temper and gives her a black eye.  While I don't in the least blame him, I feeel it would have made a more interesting scene if he had walloped her on a different portion of her anatomy.  She persuades the King to get involved in a war with France, then gets ill with smallpox.  Even after he has risked his life nursing her through the disease, the ungrateful bitch still doesn't love him, what a cow.  Then she runs off with her wimpy husband, and the King is reduced to sniffing her underwear.  It all ends miserably for everyone, in the pouring rain (it never seems to stop raining in Piedmont).  I have no idea whether this preposterous film is based on true events, and if so how accurate it is, but the goings-on in Piedmont make the English monarchy look positively sane by comparison.",1,Desperately depressing Dalton disaster,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1639,"['possibly', 'most', 'miserable', 'gloomy', 'film', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'ever', 'made', 'King', 'Piedmont', 'who', 'inexplicable', 'passion', 'rather', 'tiresome', 'French', 'countess', 'however', 'devoted', 'rather', 'wet', 'husband', 'nothing', 'do', 'King', 'beginning', 'deplorable', 'taste', 'However', 'husband', 'family', 'want', 'give', 'King', 'making', 'everyone', 'misery', 'moping', 'when', 'end', 'even', 'husband', 'give', 'become', 'King', 'mistress', 'revenge', 'husband', 'family', 'having', 'banished', 'family', 'estate', 'husband', 'act', 'lackey', 'King', 'crazy', 'still', ""n't"", 'love', 'end', 'temper', 'black', 'eye', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'blame', 'feeel', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'scene', 'had', 'walloped', 'different', 'portion', 'anatomy', 'King', 'get', 'involved', 'war', 'France', 'then', 'ill', 'smallpox', 'Even', 'risked', 'life', 'nursing', 'disease', 'ungrateful', 'bitch', 'still', ""n't"", 'love', 'what', 'cow', 'Then', 'wimpy', 'husband', 'King', 'reduced', 'sniffing', 'underwear', 'miserably', 'everyone', 'pouring', 'rain', 'never', 'stop', 'raining', 'Piedmont', 'have', 'idea', 'preposterous', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'so', 'how', 'accurate', 'goings-on', 'Piedmont', 'make', 'English', 'monarchy', 'look', 'positively', 'sane', 'comparison']",N/A
