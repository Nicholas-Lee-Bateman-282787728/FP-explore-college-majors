It starts out with a widowed actress working as a fortune teller.  She really wants to get a normal acting job and calls her agent to relay these sentiments.  But, work is work which equals money for the aspiring actress.  Innocent in the ways of the Spirit world, the actress, a non-believer goes through the motions with the few clients that trickle into her small little store front office.  Till one day...a client comes in with problems a fortune teller isn't really prepared to handle.  The client has something that has become attached to her causing strange occurrences.  The actress sends a message to the attached spirit to move on. The client thanks the actress for her help, which the actress dubiously, accepts. The actress, relieved she ""helped"" the client, starts to close up shop when she notices strange noises and things moving on their own, along with shadows. When the actress leaves it seems she is not alone but being a non-believer she has no explanation for the events to come.  Although predictable, not a bad movie and worth watching.
