I still do not get why DVDs are not released with one section of live performances and one section about the band. if you are a great fan you might enjoy this, but if you want just to watch their gigs, such authoring is extremely annoying (and you end up writing review on Amazon while watching it).The sound is also only stereo, no 5.1. The sound is good but kind of flat without the intensity you will expect from a live recording (I have seen the band during this tour and they were amazing). There are no captions which could make the non english speaker annoyed during the interview sections. Some video footages appears poorly when upscale to the 1080 format (especially the first minute with the Tokyo audience on beautiful cubic pixel images). This is most likely related to a cheap production behind the DVD.The text reference to Alien on the cover art was not probably not necessary...(Probably personal taste...)",3,Too much interview/documentary breaks between live performances,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,1066,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'watching', 'DVD.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'interviews/documentaries', 'were', 'not', 'set', 'songs', 'so', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'why', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'released', 'one', 'section', 'live', 'performances', 'one', 'section', 'band', 'are', 'great', 'fan', 'might', 'enjoy', 'want', 'just', 'watch', 'gigs', 'such', 'authoring', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'end', 'up', 'writing', 'review', 'Amazon', 'watching', '.The', 'sound', 'also', 'only', 'stereo', '5.1', 'sound', 'good', 'kind', 'flat', 'intensity', 'will', 'expect', 'live', 'recording', 'have', 'seen', 'band', 'tour', 'were', 'amazing', 'are', 'captions', 'could', 'make', 'non', 'english', 'speaker', 'annoyed', 'interview', 'sections', 'video', 'footages', 'poorly', 'when', 'upscale', '1080', 'format', 'especially', 'first', 'minute', 'Tokyo', 'audience', 'beautiful', 'cubic', 'pixel', 'images', 'most', 'likely', 'related', 'cheap', 'production', 'DVD.The', 'text', 'reference', 'Alien', 'cover', 'art', 'was', 'not', 'probably', 'not', 'necessary', 'Probably', 'personal', 'taste']",N/A

1315802,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B0030Y0I6O,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","This DVD earns an easy and obvious five stars, as does most everything Meshuggah has released.  This band is a monster, and their live performance shows that even without hyperspeed or blast beats, they can create some of the absolute heaviest sounds of any metal band in the world.  Sure, they do have some fast moments, but for the most part, listening to their crushing, almost alien grooves and machine-like precision makes you feel like you've been pummeled by a Transformer.  As I watched, it occurred to me, not for the first time, that no other band sounds like Meshuggah, and Meshuggah sounds like no other band.  They've truly evolved over the years into a genre unto themselves, transcending thrash, or groove, or math metal.  They are flawless in their execution of songs that feature dizzying technicality, which I greatly appreciate given that many bands, most with far simpler compositions, fail to deliver performances onstage that match the level of their recorded albums.  It shows a degree of dedication that makes Meshuggah's new releases automatic first-day purchases for me.I don't have any complaints, just a few wishes.  I wish they had included more songs, as twelve seems a bit light for a live DVD.  Leading to the next wish that each album would have been represented.  Alive has no songs from Contradictions Collapse, Destroy Erase Improve (sacrilege!), or Catch Thirty Three.  I was pleased, though, that Humiliative from None made the set.  I also didn't mind that the songs are from four different shows instead of one concert, which I initially thought would be unsatisfying.  But after watching, I liked seeing the different crowds and venues.  The ""interviews"" between songs show the band to be incredibly down-to-earth and humble, and even though I was disappointed to hear from Haake that Meshuggah would probably never play ""I"" live (because, as he states, ""No one knows...how 'I' goes""), I was excited to hear that the band plans to work on new material this fall or at the end of this year.  I'm sure whatever new stuff they write, it will crush everything like ObZen did.Oh, and as a bonus, you get the nightmarish and awesome video for Bleed, as well as a making-of featurette, not to mention a pretty sweet booklet, and a companion CD .

1315803,A2LTL305X8YRBY,B0030Y0I6O,Michael,"[7, 7]","For years Meshuggah have been churning out chaotic, devastating metal, and now they finally have a live release for the fans to really enjoy. The main feature on the dvd is a concert/documentary film with footage of them in several cities on their obZen tour. Sound quality is top notch as the live audio was mixed by longtime producer/engineer Daniel Bergstrand (In Flames, Soilwork, Behemoth). Extras include the Bleed music video as well as the making of the video, and behind the scenes looks at the bands instruments (drums, guitars, and bass). The audio cd features all of the songs from the dvd, but in a different order, even some being from shows different than the dvd. If I had one complaint, it'd be that there aren't enough songs from Chaosphere and obZen, and there are none from Destroy Erase Improve, not even Future Breed Machine, one of their most well known songs. Despite the lack of some material, the quality of the product overall (production, audio, visuals, even the packaging) makes up for it.
