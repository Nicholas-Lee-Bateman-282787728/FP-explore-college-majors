Anna Battista is a successful actress in Italy, whose life is a series of wrong decisions. The hectic and disordered life of a young successful actress is very well depicted. Ms. Argento has shot a promising movie. There are shades of Fellini in this film, there is tragedy and also some elation, and finally, hope. The DVD has an interview with Asia and a commentary by her on the movie. This adds some texture and enhances our understanding of the movie.All in all, an interesting film to watch; but not for everyone.

Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work. Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film, instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know, especially if it's told in a semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us. Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort into this performance.

The movie is rather chaotic, which may fit with the life being portrayed, but does not make for a very good movie.

Well, I watched and watched again, and could not find anything disturbing except the fact that the clock had ticked away so much of my spare time--time which could have been spent on more useful tasks.No, there is nothing sexually explicit at all in this film, but you are meant to think there is.

Asia's film would make a good double bill with DOGVILLE to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism. Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist.

724725,A3MYQT1X9QWDEU,B000077VQY,Francis DeMarco,"[5, 14]","I loved this movie, everything about it. I've been a fan of Asia Argento for sometime now, ever since I saw her in her father's movie, ""Trauma"".Some people may feel that she is hogging up the movie, with everything constantly revolving around her, but that's the point of the whole movie. She's trying to convey to the audience, being a child of a major Italian director, and a somewhat psycho mother, has done to her life. Most of it is true, but some is fictionalized. I watched it twice so far, once with the audio commentary with Asia herself, and the other time without. this was something she had to do to clear her conscience of her past trials and tribulations, and also to kill off her mother, actress, writer, Daria Nicolodi, who is ironically portrayed as her mother in the movie, to patch things up with her, in her real life.This movie is not  glamourous, but rather a look back at ones personal life as she saw herself self-distructing, and being used and abused by various people in the movie business, among others. She explains in the commentary, as the movie goes along, and also in her interview, which is an extra on the dvd, filmed in New York City, that she needed closure in her life from the things she did and what had happened to her along the way, regarding drug-abuse, her mother, various movie mogels, and the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, then all of a sudden just left her and never came back, Kirk. Kirk was a musician in a progressive rock band that she met one night while attending a concert with her friend. They met, spent one romantic night with each other, she fell in love instantly, but apparently, he didn't. He explains that he has a career, and needs to pursue it, and someday he'll be back. But nothing ever came of it, and she only talked to him one more time over the phone, to tell him that she was pregnant by him.This is a story of a woman who had practically no parental control over her, and was mostly watched by a nanny growing up. She goes through the drug faze, relationships, and is finally forced to take a look at herself, and what she's doing to herself, and her unborn baby. At the end she finds redemption from all this, and turns her life around, for the better.I have been an e-mail buddy with Asia for about 2 years now, ever since I met her once in Los Angeles, Ca. I met her at the screening for this movie out there, and had a lengthy conversation with her, and found we had alot in common, and later exchanged e-mail addresses. This blew my mind, believe me or not, doesn't matter. We write each other only about twice a month or so, but she always has alot to say, and is an overall, beautiful, great, strong, good-hearted, loving woman.Hopefully she will direct another movie soon, but nothing is in the works yet. Right now she is making an action movie with the great Dennis Hopper, in Canada. I know I'll be seeing it. Love ya Asia.

724726,A11NA1DR9P0BO3,B000077VQY,Hans Carter,"[10, 16]","First let me say that this movie DOES, indeed, have subtitles.  Unfortunately, this is just one of those annoying DVDs where you actually have to turn them on with your remote.I personally think that Asia Argento is sexy in a very skanky sort of way.  I shouldn't like her as much as I do, but I do anyway.  I think she's gorgeous and her pelvic tattoo is amazing.  I also think she usually has great taste in the projects she takes on in Europe, but her American films leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately, this is NOT one of her great European movies.  In fact, I think the other reviewers who refered to this movie as ""pretentious"" were being way too kind.While I admire what Asia was wanting to do with this movie, it comes across as more of a  PRETENTIOUS ( I couldn't think of a better word) teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy.  It's a low budget DV feature done in a pseudo-Dogma 95 style.  Translated that means the script is very minimal and the production values aren't all that great.  Some would have you believe this is for ""artistic"" effect.  Personally, I think that's a bunch of crap.  The teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy aspect gets REALLY old after about 5 minutes.  The lack of an interesting plot doesn't even make the more superficial T&A; aspects worth watching.  (AND I LOVE MY T&A;!!!!!!!)Besides the nudity, I think the only other aspect of this film I liked was the jab they took at director Gus Van Sant, refering to a fictional version of Cleopatra he would direct.  (I've heard the Italians don't like Gus or his movies.)My personal recommendation is not to waste your time with this movie.  If you  must watch this film, borrow a copy from a friend.

How does this effect my review? Decide for yourself.I've read Scarlet Diva is semi-autobiographical, so if you're interested in learning about Asia (as I was) there's no better starting point than this film. You'll find her audio commentary track to be especially revealing. Asia discusses the relationship she had with her mother and how it is represented in the film. She also discusses her father, the Italian horror director Dario Argento, on the commentary and his influence on the movie. Asia talks a lot about what she was going for in certain scenes and what she was hoping to accomplish. Good stuff.The movie itself is a little harder to describe. Asia is great in the film, but in essence, she is playing herself so it's not surprising she does a good job of it. Asia does some interesting things with the camera and plays a little bit with symbolism (an umbrella blows down an empty street... uh, what does that represent again, Asia?) and religious imagery. As you watch, you can't help wondering how much is true and how much isn't. Asia's commentary helps you sort through much of it. For instance, she sadly points out the scene where she is seduced by a blonde stranger is one of the few scenes with absolutely no basis in fact. How disappointing.The movie will probably depress and disturb you as you venture into the life of Anna Batista, a young actress who seems to have the world at her feet. However, we discover the life of celebrity isn't as much fun as one might think. Anna is subjected to as much loss and rejection as any other poor sucker. Anna smokes a lot of cigarettes. Anna has abortion nightmares. Anna is abandoned by the one person she thought she loved. Anna has some weird friends. Is Anna all that different from you or me?Some have described this film as self-indulgent. Well, who wouldn't want to examine and experience their own life from the perspective of a director where you have complete creative control? Isn't that what art is? An examination of who and what we are? Asia handles the material well, considering it's her first feature as a director. And in any case,  I don't mind Asia being self-dulgent because, well, she's so darned hot.Still, I have a hard time recommending this to non-Asia fans. You'll probably love it or hate it or just wind up confused. Some will come away thinking it is too artsy (i.e. pretentious) for their tastes. Others will just be excited that it's a movie totally about Asia.

It's really all about the life of director-star Asia Argento, with just enough fictionalized elements to keep you guessing.

But the character is Australian and sounds more like Nick Cave, so who knows??)  Asia is a compelling and fearless performer, and her film is quite elegantly shot and creatively edited despite an obviously low budget.  It also defies the convention of many films of this type that track the tragic lives of movie starlets:  in this film, the heroine actually seems to be on a path to get her troubled life *together.*  Scarlet Diva is the work of a talented filmmaker, without a doubt, and I would love to see a *second* film directed by Asia Argento.

The film is about an actress, Anna Batista, who is in a constant struggle with herself to be loved, to be accepted and to discover herself. The film is very raw in all aspects: it was shot on digital video, the characters play the worst of their stereotypes, they are monsters, the main character (the actress) seemed like a child, seeking everyone's affection and approval, and yet plunged herself in unhealthy behavior.The film is a bit incoherent and in pieces, little snippets here and there, much like the actress' life. The film is less about the art of filmmaking and more like a conduit to allow both the main character and Asia Argento to expunge all those images and experiences that have been so haunting to them. The film is like an exorcism shrouded in symbolism.I do wish she would have used less of her friends to film certain scenes or tested the talent first; some scenes seemed fake, unprofessional and forced.

Yeah, it's Asia Argento's autobiography, etc. etc. But you know what's coming from the opening scene, and you're not disappointed.Anna Batista (Argento) is a young, award-winning actress who wants to direct. The problem is, no one seems to want her to. A combination of her frustrated desires, a not-too-happy childhood, and her own (and others') relationship problems sends her down an ugly spiral of drugs and abuse, exacerbated by forces beyond her control, until she hits bottom and has that moment of epiphany you hear about all the time. All you need to do is connect Batista's ""I want to direct"" in the opening scene to Scarlet Diva being Argento's directorial debut, and you've got a complete picture (albeit a pretty boring one, since it's only got two dots).The movie is better. Argento is a serviceable actress (though she's better when someone else is directing her; compare this to b.Monkey or New Rose Hotel, both from two years previous) with aspirations to greatness, and her rather astonishing ability to continually slag herself is almost scary. (We'll ignore the fact that this raises the obvious question of whether this is the version through the rose-colored glasses...) There are some pretty convincing breakdowns to be found here, some footage that's kind of difficult to watch. There's also a great deal that isn't (all of Asia Argento is as easy on the eyes as her face), and it's quite welcome. What lies between isn't bad, certainly-- most of the movie's problems (most of which are pace-related) are common to first-time directors. I found it haunting, even beautiful in a sort of depraved way. I seem to have liked it better than most, but that's not going to stop me from recommending it. ***",3,Not bad for a directorial debut.,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1848,"['Scarlet', 'Diva', 'Asia', 'Argento', '2000', 'Scarlet', 'Diva', 'small', 'way', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'own', 'creation', 'Yeah', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'autobiography', 'etc', 'etc', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'opening', 'scene', ""'re"", 'not', 'disappointed.Anna', 'Batista', 'Argento', 'young', 'award-winning', 'actress', 'who', 'direct', 'problem', 'one', 'want', 'combination', 'frustrated', 'desires', 'not-too-happy', 'childhood', 'own', 'others', 'relationship', 'problems', 'down', 'ugly', 'spiral', 'drugs', 'abuse', 'exacerbated', 'forces', 'control', 'bottom', 'moment', 'epiphany', 'hear', 'time', 'need', 'do', 'connect', 'Batista', 'want', 'direct', 'opening', 'scene', 'Scarlet', 'Diva', 'being', 'Argento', 'directorial', 'debut', ""'ve"", 'got', 'complete', 'picture', 'pretty', 'boring', 'one', 'only', 'got', 'two', 'dots', '.The', 'movie', 'better', 'Argento', 'serviceable', 'actress', 'better', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'directing', 'compare', 'b.Monkey', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'two', 'years', 'previous', 'aspirations', 'greatness', 'rather', 'astonishing', 'ability', 'continually', 'slag', 'almost', 'scary', ""'ll"", 'ignore', 'fact', 'obvious', 'question', 'version', 'rose-colored', 'glasses', 'are', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'breakdowns', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'footage', 'kind', 'difficult', 'watch', 'also', 'great', 'deal', ""n't"", 'Asia', 'Argento', 'easy', 'eyes', 'face', 'quite', 'welcome', 'What', ""n't"", 'bad', 'certainly', 'most', 'movie', 'problems', 'most', 'are', 'pace-related', 'are', 'common', 'first-time', 'directors', 'found', 'haunting', 'even', 'beautiful', 'sort', 'depraved', 'way', 'seem', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'most', 'not', 'going', 'stop', 'recommending', '***']",N/A

The film is considered to be semiautobiographical in nature but deals with the fictional Anna Batiste is the `loneliest girl in the world' who is the top actress in Italy and posed to be unleashed upon the stage of world cinema but takes herself down a path that leads her to get involved in many bad life altering situations. She is ultimately used up and spit out by sleazy Hollywood producers, rock stars, druggies, photographers and a sordid list of leeches that leave her alone, pregnant and running mad through the streets of Paris.I'm very impressed with the energy that Argento injects into the film. She clearly borrows from some of the well-known directors she has worked with in the past (including her father Dario) but it all works in her favor. A rich color scheme is used throughout the film that sometimes gives an ethereal feel that is sometimes jarring . The script matches the direction, a little disjointed but it works for the characters spiral into agony. Her acting and the cast around her are amazing, her believable portrait of the character throughout the peaks and valleys of her life.Unfairly blasted by critics this film should be seen with an open mind (Mine is very open). True I was already a fan of Asia Argento before I saw the film but you don't have to be in order to like or respect the film.

724736,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000077VQY,Tsuyoshi,"[20, 23]","Asia Argento, daughter of Italian horror maestro Dario, has been a gifted actress on her own before her appearance in ""XXX"" with Vin Diesel, after her good turns in some English-speaking films like ""B-Monkey"" (directed by Michael Radford, ""Il Postino"" fame and ""New Rose Hotel"" by none other than Abel Ferrara.  And her film debut goes back to the year 1985.  Considering the fact she was born in 1975, her career is as memorable as that of Drew Barrymore, and it is only natural that Asia goes on to direct her own film, which turns out ""Scarlet Diva,"" full of, some say, her autobiographical elements.The film traces a life of Italian actress Anna Battista, who is at the height of popularity.  But despite of her fame, her private life is terribly bleak: in short, sex, drug, and violence.  But in Paris, she meets her destiny, that is, a musician from Australia named Kirk, with whom she shares a bed one night.After the meeting with him, Anna attempts to change her life, taking more seriously of her life.  But the surrounding people in the industy would not listen.  The Hollywood producer doesn't hear her plead to be taken seriously, and only desires her body, not the scrpit she wrote.""Scarlet Diva"" goes on like this.  The film suffers from its repetitions of the heroine's agony, which looks often as if having no end.  Though the camera brings the atomosphere of the place to life vividly (with digital video), the narrative is not particularly effective.  We know from the beginning where the film would go, and it goes there.But the strong point of the film does not lie there, but in Asia's convincing performance as a tormented heroine.  You may feel this film looks self-indulgent, and that tendency should be admitted.  But her good acting, very emotional and true to herself, raises the film to higher level, showing that she is more than a daughter of famous director, or a psuedo-Bond girl in Hollywood movies.Many interesting names appear in addition to painter Joe Coleman.  Vera Jemma (Italian actor Giuliano Gemma's daughter) as Anna's friend, and Daria Nicolodi (Asia's mother) as Anna's mother.  The soundtrack music is done by John Hughes, the son of much famous director of the same name (of Molly Ringwald films), and the film is produced by Dario and Claudio Argento, the latter being Asia's uncle.",3,Sometimes Painful But Very Strong Account of Actress's Life,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,2330,"['Asia', 'Argento', 'daughter', 'Italian', 'horror', 'maestro', 'Dario', 'been', 'gifted', 'actress', 'own', 'appearance', 'XXX', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'good', 'turns', 'English-speaking', 'films', 'B-Monkey', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Radford', 'Il', 'Postino', 'fame', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'none', 'other', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'film', 'debut', 'back', 'year', '1985', 'Considering', 'fact', 'was', 'born', '1975', 'career', 'as', 'memorable', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'only', 'natural', 'Asia', 'direct', 'own', 'film', 'out', 'Scarlet', 'Diva', 'full', 'say', 'autobiographical', 'elements.The', 'film', 'life', 'Italian', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Battista', 'who', 'height', 'popularity', 'fame', 'private', 'life', 'terribly', 'bleak', 'short', 'sex', 'drug', 'violence', 'Paris', 'destiny', 'musician', 'Australia', 'named', 'Kirk', 'whom', 'shares', 'bed', 'one', 'night.After', 'meeting', 'Anna', 'change', 'life', 'taking', 'more', 'seriously', 'life', 'surrounding', 'people', 'industy', 'would', 'not', 'listen', 'Hollywood', 'producer', ""n't"", 'hear', 'plead', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'only', 'body', 'not', 'scrpit', 'wrote', 'Scarlet', 'Diva', 'film', 'suffers', 'repetitions', 'heroine', 'agony', 'often', 'having', 'end', 'camera', 'atomosphere', 'place', 'life', 'vividly', 'digital', 'video', 'narrative', 'not', 'particularly', 'effective', 'know', 'beginning', 'where', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'lie', 'there', 'Asia', 'convincing', 'performance', 'tormented', 'heroine', 'may', 'feel', 'film', 'self-indulgent', 'tendency', 'should', 'be', 'admitted', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'emotional', 'true', 'herself', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'showing', 'more', 'daughter', 'famous', 'director', 'psuedo-Bond', 'girl', 'Hollywood', 'movies.Many', 'interesting', 'names', 'appear', 'addition', 'painter', 'Joe', 'Coleman', 'Vera', 'Jemma', 'Italian', 'actor', 'Giuliano', 'Gemma', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'friend', 'Daria', 'Nicolodi', 'Asia', 'mother', 'Anna', 'mother', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'done', 'John', 'Hughes', 'son', 'much', 'famous', 'director', 'same', 'name', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'films', 'film', 'produced', 'Dario', 'Claudio', 'Argento', 'latter', 'being', 'Asia', 'uncle']",N/A
