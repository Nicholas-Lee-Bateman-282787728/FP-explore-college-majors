1603521,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00A0MJ9R8,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[18, 19]","I've posted several DVD reviews of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so briefly in earlier reviews. The preschool series on Disney Junior is a CG show in which Mickey and his pals have adventures and solve puzzles, asking the home viewers to assist, ""Blue's Clues"" style.The centerpiece of the Minnie's ""The Wizard of Dizz"" collection, of course, a new musical take on ""The Wizard of Oz"" starring Minnie and the gang. Minnie and Pluto first meet Clarabelle the Good Witch, Bad Witch Pete and Chip 'n Dale the Chipmunchkins. Then she follows the Pink Dotted Path to meet  Scarecrow Goofy, Mickey the Tin Mouse, Donald (the Funny But Not Authoritative) Lion, Coco the Winged Monkey, Daisy the Guardian of the Gate--and as the Wizard is the character that seemed destined to play him: Professor Ludwig Von Drake.Almost any twist on Oz is fun, and MM Clubhouse is as genial and well-executed as the earlier ""Mickey's Adventures in Wonderland."" I'd love to see Mickey and company merchandised as Oz characters.There are even a few touches from the Baum book that are rarely or directly identified in some Oz adaptations, like the Guardian of the Gates and the swift river that threatens to prevent the journey to the City of Handy Helpers.These are a total of three MM Clubhouse episodes in this collection:Episode 88, Season 3, September 28, 2012The Golden Boo-BooLudwig sends Daisy O'Dare on a mission to find the Golden Boo-Boo statue.Episode 93, Season 3, October 24, 2011Goofy's GoneLudwig sends The Go-Getters (Detective Minnie, Secret Spy Daisy and Captain Clarabelle) to find Goofy.Episode 104, Season 4, June 7, 2013The Wizard of Dizz (double-length episode)New musical version of ""The Wizard of Oz""BONUS FEATURESThis is the DVD debut of the Disney Junior interstitial series, ""Minnie's Bow Toons,"" with the first ten 3-minute season 1 episodes:1.
