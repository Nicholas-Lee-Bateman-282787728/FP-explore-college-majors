1392484,A1IE7D4HZP43E7,B004A8ZWYW,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","All Faust stories have a common theme. An individual wants something that could reasonably be granted only by supernatural forces. The man in one way or another, maybe carelessly (""I'd give anything to have..."") maybe explicitly (""I'll sign over my soul for...""), makes a deal with the devil to get what he wants. And then the devil makes sure that he doesn't get it, that he pays an impossibly high price for it, or both.In this case, Jaime is a young photographer who suffers from livid birthmarks that include a large heart-shaped mark that covers nearly half his face and ruins his hopes for the quiet loving family life (wife and children) he would love to have. Living as well in a nightmare vision of a cursed East London neighborhood, he eventually is guided to Papa B, his personal devil, who tells Jaime that he can have his birthmark removed (not quite painlessly) in exchange for a little help in advancing Papa B's hobby of world chaos. Atypically of Faust stories, where the devil explicitly states the bargain (e.g., have so many years of power and pleasure in exchange for one immortal soul), Papa B states that Jaime can simply write some blasphemous graffiti every few months, gets Jaime's assent, and then ups the demand in no time at all.The movie contains some twists and scenes that advance the horror, both physical and moral, and the anxious anticipation of same. Perhaps the most interesting character is Belle, a sympathetic young girl in Asian Indian dress, who is Papa B's assistant. She soothes Jaime to accept Papa B's ""deal"" and demands and urges Jaime on to his most horrific tasks, even as she seems to be a victim of Papa B as well as the loving child that is part of Jaime's dream life.This movie made me curse, once again, the inability to award half-stars in Amazon reviews. I wavered between three and four stars. Jaime seems like a decent character who is a little too easily persuaded to follow the devil's dictates; the movie is a bit too facile with the ""impressive"" effects and plot twists, substituting tricks and over-the-top concepts, like a gang dude named ""She"" with a rotor-rooter hand, for solid plot resolution. So, on balance, I opt for three stars--add one star for entertainment but take it away for being too clever by half.Appended comment: In addition to everything, the beginning and a good part of the ending makes me wonder whether the writer wasn't thinking of Ambrose Bierce's ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""",3,"A Naive Faust, A Nasty Mephisto, A Twisted Journey",1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2475,"['Faust', 'stories', 'have', 'common', 'theme', 'individual', 'something', 'could', 'reasonably', 'be', 'granted', 'only', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'man', 'one', 'way', 'maybe', 'carelessly', ""'d"", 'give', 'anything', 'have', 'maybe', 'explicitly', ""'ll"", 'sign', 'soul', 'deal', 'devil', 'get', 'what', 'then', 'devil', 'sure', ""n't"", 'get', 'impossibly', 'high', 'price', 'both.In', 'case', 'Jaime', 'young', 'photographer', 'who', 'livid', 'birthmarks', 'include', 'large', 'heart-shaped', 'mark', 'nearly', 'face', 'hopes', 'quiet', 'loving', 'family', 'life', 'wife', 'children', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'Living', 'as', 'well', 'nightmare', 'vision', 'cursed', 'East', 'London', 'neighborhood', 'eventually', 'guided', 'Papa', 'B', 'personal', 'devil', 'who', 'Jaime', 'can', 'have', 'birthmark', 'removed', 'not', 'quite', 'painlessly', 'exchange', 'little', 'help', 'advancing', 'Papa', 'B', 'hobby', 'world', 'chaos', 'Atypically', 'Faust', 'stories', 'where', 'devil', 'explicitly', 'bargain', 'e.g.', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'power', 'pleasure', 'exchange', 'one', 'immortal', 'soul', 'Papa', 'B', 'Jaime', 'can', 'simply', 'write', 'blasphemous', 'graffiti', 'few', 'months', 'Jaime', 'assent', 'then', 'ups', 'demand', 'time', 'all.The', 'movie', 'twists', 'scenes', 'advance', 'horror', 'physical', 'moral', 'anxious', 'anticipation', 'same', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Belle', 'sympathetic', 'young', 'girl', 'Asian', 'Indian', 'dress', 'who', 'Papa', 'B', 'assistant', 'Jaime', 'accept', 'Papa', 'B', 'deal', 'demands', 'urges', 'Jaime', 'most', 'horrific', 'tasks', 'even', 'be', 'victim', 'Papa', 'B', 'as', 'well', 'loving', 'child', 'part', 'Jaime', 'dream', 'life.This', 'movie', 'made', 'curse', 'once', 'again', 'inability', 'award', 'half-stars', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'wavered', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'Jaime', 'decent', 'character', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'easily', 'persuaded', 'follow', 'devil', 'dictates', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'facile', 'impressive', 'effects', 'plot', 'twists', 'substituting', 'tricks', 'over-the-top', 'concepts', 'gang', 'dude', 'named', 'rotor-rooter', 'hand', 'solid', 'plot', 'resolution', 'So', 'balance', 'opt', 'three', 'stars', 'add', 'one', 'star', 'entertainment', 'take', 'away', 'being', 'too', 'clever', 'half.Appended', 'comment', 'addition', 'everything', 'beginning', 'good', 'part', 'ending', 'wonder', 'writer', 'was', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge']",N/A

1392487,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B004A8ZWYW,Douglas King,"[1, 2]","There is sort of a whole new sub-genre of films that have come out in recent years. It's hard to put an easy label on them, but they all involve creepy, scary stories about protagonists who are most likely insane, and as a result, the films have an ambiguity regarding what is actually real and what is just taking place in the protagonist's troubled head. Recent films such as ""The Machinist"", ""Secret Window"", ""Shutter Island"", and even ""Black Swan"" might all be put in this category, as well as this film, ""Heartless"".""Heartless"" is the story of a young photographer, Jamie, who has large birthmarks on his body, including a large one on his face, and as a result is withdrawn and introverted. His life mostly involves his close-knit family, including his religious mother, more confident older brother, and wayward nephew, all of whom live in a dangerous area of London. Tragically, a group of terrorist gang members performing random acts of brutality murder his mother, which sends him on a mental breakdown after which it's difficult to tell what is real and what is not. What follows is a supernatural plot in which Jamie meets the devil and makes a deal with him to remove his birthmarks in exchange for Jamie performing a random act of chaos. Being the devil and all, he lies and tells Jamie that this act will simply involve some vandalism, but in actuality Jamie is forced to commit a brutal murder himself.Sound confusing? It is. The labyrinthine plot is full of strange, bizarre, and disturbing twists and turns. And the tone of the film constantly shifts - at times between horror, dark comedy, fantasy, and social commentary. Perhaps that's because the film clearly owes its existence to a variety of influences: Watching ""Heartless"", you can't help but see shades of the Matrix Trilogy, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg.Despite its somewhat muddled plot, what saves the film is the imagery. Visually, the film's themes include reptilian predators and urban decay. The terrorist street gang, who look like lizard demons, are genuinely very scary, as is the Devil, who appears as a heavily scarred middle-aged thug with a deformed, claw-like hand.So as a horror-fantasy, the film works, as it provides some genuinely frightening moments and inspired visuals.

His face is blemished with a large, heart-shaped birthmark. His being self conscious about this has led to suicidal depression in  his past. Something is afoot in the East End. He's seeing reptilian featured demons in the shadows, and there are reports of people being set fire by by men wearing lizard masks. It seems someone has an eye on him and sets up a meeting with him and the Devil to get rid of the birthmark and make him a happy man. But there's a price.There's a lot to like about this movie. It has good atmosphere and a lot of creepiness to it. Things only partially seen. Things rumored about in the press. A goodhearted but vulnerable hero. The problem is that it is not focused well. It seems to begin as a social commentary. Society is breaking down. Gangs are killing with impunity. Guns are entering the picture. The city is going to Hell. Then it turns into a Faustian moral tale. Jamie wants to look and love like normal people, but how far will he go to achieve this. Will he kill for it? Then the end comes and I'm really confused. How much was real? How much imagined? What actually happens to him in the end?Jim Sturgess does well with the Jamie role. He's good enough looking but wears a hint of vulnerability. Eddie Marsan has a small roll but is his usual great self. All the others do stand up jobs. It's shot and cut well with a decent musical score. There is also good use of leitmotif.

1392489,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004A8ZWYW,Grady Harp,"[14, 15]","Philip Ridley is an artist, a writer and a film director whose work is considered unconventional and unique in every form he touches. Some how he manages to marry all of these forms in his most recent HEARTLESS, including writing the lyrics to the many songs by David Julyou that play such an important role in the unfolding of this visit to the Faust legend.  It is harsh, dark, disturbing, and at times a bit over the top as far as his need to make visual things that go bump in the dark.  But in the end, with the incomparable help of featured actor Jim Sturgess, he makes it work.Jamie Morgan (Jim Sturgess) is a young 25-year old photographer living in a squalid area of London with his loving mother (Marion Morgan): Jamie bears a birthmark on his face and the upper torso that makes him the victim of prejudice by the boys in the neighborhood and has resulted in his living the life of a recluse.  Jamie's brother and nephew (Luke Treadway and Justin Salinger) stay close to the home but are preoccupied with other matters - some good some bad.  Jamie longs for his departed father (Timothy Spall) who 'made the world make sense' and he longs for a relationship with a girl so that he can have a family and be normal. Walking the streets at night Jamie hears screams and witnesses sights that terrify him: he is aware that gangs rule the world and in time he is assaulted with his mother during a night walk and his mother is killed.  In an attempt to find sense out of chaos Jamie becomes friends with a new neighbor AJ (Noel Clarke) and is offered a handgun by a local merchant (Frazer Ayers) 'to protect himself.  As Jamie becomes more terrified with the creatures he sees in the night and angered by the death of his mother he ultimately meets Papa B (Joseph Mawle) who just happens to have strange powers to offer Jamie anything he wishes.  Jamie makes a pact with Papa B, agreeing to promote chaos in the streets in the form of writing graffiti in turn for Papa B removing the ugly birthmark from his body. Papa B's young girl assistant Charlie (Nadia Theaker) bonds with Jamie and becomes like the daughter Jamie has always wanted.Now, without the physical disfigurement Jamie attracts a pretty delivery girl Tia (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) and seems to have found his wishes come true - with Tia and Charlie as family.  But Papa B has other plans and sends his Weapons Man (Eddie Marsan) who gives Jamie an altered version of his assignment from his pact with Papa B and the world becomes ruled by horror.  How Jamie responds to his new bizarre assignments changes the course of the tale, a course best not shared in a review.Jim Sturgess makes this role of a seemingly impossible spectrum of acting an example of just how skilled he has become in his craft.  The cast is good but burdened with many aspects of  the bizarre that keep the viewer form connecting in a positive way.  The cinematography by Matt Gray is appropriately dark and the visual effects, though excessively ugly, make the atmosphere of this dark tale work.  It is a strange film and requires that viewer to suspend disbelief, but the impact and underlying message is strong.

As with that film, this film deals with people's own demons, more than supernatural demons. That is not to say there are not supernatural forces going on here, as our main character , ""Jamie Morgan,"" played with great emphatic depth, by Jim Sturgess, has a disfiguring birthmark on his face & upper body. He is the butt of jokes, & longs for the love of ""Tia,"" played with perfect innocence, by Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy (Harry Potter).Jamie has some recent tragic events in his  life, & starts to build up his anger from his losses, looking for the ""Demons"" that has destroyed his life. On his journey, he meets up with Poppa B (Beelzebub?), that offers him beauty & happiness, if he'll only do one thing in return. This is where the Clive Barker influence of this film really breaks out, as Jamie does not realize what he has got himself in to, & is in a living hell, self made from his anger & longing to be accepted as normal.To say more would ruin this fine film. I will say, if your looking for a fast moving horror film that is skin deep, this film is not for you. But, if your looking for psychological horror, of the human kind, & supernatural, this film is a gem.The moral of the story is, nothing is for free, there are no easy short cuts to change your life.

1392492,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004A8ZWYW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 8]","Philip Ridley, the mind-boggling auteur behind ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"" and  ""The Reflecting Skin,"" has been missing in action from the cinematic world for too many years.  Divisive and perplexing, these two films were declared brilliant in some camps and incomprehensible in others.  But, I think that's why I like Ridley--you'll definitely have an opinion on his work.  I was excited by the prospect of a new Ridley piece, and ""Heartless"" met most of my expectations.  In some ways, ""Heartless"" is perhaps the most accessible of Ridley's films.  A interesting commingling of urban horror, Faustian drama, and dementia--""Heartless"" is a dark and brooding take on the world in decline.  Shot from an almost apocalyptic world view, there is an unrepentant bleakness to ""Heartless"" that makes the case that violence and chaos are necessary evils to keep society in check.Jim Sturgess plays London photographer Jamie Morgan.  Morgan has a large heart-shaped birthmark covering half his face, and this affliction has kept him somewhat insulated from a traditional social life.  The first third of ""Heartless"" plays most conventionally as horror as the city is besieged by attacks that might be otherworldly in nature.  After a traumatic personal loss, things take a shift when Morgan has the opportunity to make a ""deal with the devil"" for a chance at normalcy.  And as grand as that may seem, it comes at a cost he may be unable to pay.  Becoming a more active participant in life may make him complicit in its grotesqueries.  As with other Ridley films, there are elements of fantasy and surrealism and different viewers may interpret things differently.I've remained purposely vague about most of the film's plot, it's best to let it unfold naturally.  I suspect many may not like ""Heartless"" with its shifts in tones and its open-endedness.  I, however, thought the film took some familiar concepts (like the aforementioned Faustian drama) and presented them in visually interesting ways.  London has never looked so scary, and the unsettling art design throughout is a major selling point to establishing a nightmarish mood.  Sturgess is perhaps the film's strongest asset--believable at every stage of Morgan's harrowing journey.  Gorgeous, dark and intense--""Heartless is definitely not for everyone, but I think those that enjoy it will enjoy it very much.  I hope there isn't another fifteen year interval before we see Ridley directing again!

There are various elements of horror involved in the movie, however, none of which really add anything to the overall film.  If I had to pigeonhole ""Heartless"", I would argue that it is a thriller, with elements of a horror film.  With that being said, it is still a very well made film worth watching.Jamie (Jim Sturgees), a shy East Londoner disfigured by whine-colored birthmarks and haunted by the death of his father, lands on a nightmarish collision course with demonic forces.  When he decides to make a deal with a demon-like individual to get rid of his birthmarks and scars, his world soon flips upside down.Throughout the film, Jamie is thrown through the gamut of physical and emotional states as he tries to make sense of a world gone mad.  East London is filled with inexplicable savagery, which shows a gritty array of grotesque and absurd individuals.  One of the most horrifying things within the film, are the hooded group of hooligans who set innocent men and women on fire for no apparent reason.  This type of savagery seems to plague East London, with no sign of slowing down.Although there are some interesting aspects within the film, Jim Sturgees makes this film really shine.

That is the problem one man is having, not to mention the oddities taking place around him. Gangs are starting to wander the roads and odd things seem to follow in their wake, and the more they are seen the more some are convinced of there horrid ways. There has even been a demon of some sorts that seems to be inhabiting those dark byways, and people are disappearing and it all seems connected. this is where a man that cannot face himself might find a way to do that provided he doesn't have to pay too high a price for confidence. a woman, self-love, family; what is it all worth in the end?I saw this on Movies on Demand, wathcing it on the Before they hit Theatres option.

I did not know what was happening when the devil and the little girl with him met with jim, and I did not know what would happen to that face when he had the devil's word. It is shaped just like a heart, good looking and on the face, and it has an appeal to it that makes Sturgess seem cursed because of the way he carries himself and frail - really frail.
