All four of our kids took turns being sick that week and the Octonauts was able to take their minds off of their upset tummies all the while teaching them some fun facts.  This was our first experience with the Octonauts and it was all positive.  The animals were all likable, fun, kind, and entertaining.  While our 6 and 8 year olds had different favorite episodes/parts (one loved the snakes and the other loved the tornado), the consensus was that the Octonauts are here to stay!

1668767,A3FUU3VN3Z5E8S,B00EUDRUU6,Bonnye S,"[0, 0]","This was our first experience with the Octonauts- and we were pleasantly surprised by this movie. My daughter was immediately curious after I started it- asking me &#8220;who is that mama&#8221;, since the show was completely new to her. We talked about how it is a show about animals in the sea, and friends who go to look for them. She was interested enough to keep watching at that point and we had a great experience watching together. Our favorite part was when they sing &#8220;creature report&#34; at eh end of the episode, a song that recaps the events of the episode. My little one LOVES songs when watching shows, and this is her favorite part of each show. This is a great movie for a three year old as the episodes are informative without being too wordy which is sometimes a big &#8220;problem&#8221; when it comes to educational children&#8217;s TV. She loves that it is still an exciting adventure and I love that she is learning as she goes!

It is an adorable show about a team of animals who help out other animals in the ocean, its a fun animated show that teaches great lessons.  From little facts about animals to the theme of working together to solve problems, the show is wholesome and perfect for preschoolers.This DVD features six fun episodes featuring all different animals and my kids love them all.  Yes they are episodes that have previously aired on TV, so don't think they are new ones.  My kids didn't mind that they have seen the episodes before, they were thrilled to have the episodes on hand to watch anytime.  The episodes are easy to follow and ones that all three of my kids (2, 5 and 6 years old) could follow.

We've never seen the Octonauts before but we watch this dvd at least once a day now. I was surprised at how quickly my son took to them. The dvd has 6 episodes and each one teaches you about a new sea creature/animal. At the end of each episode they do a Creature Report, this is a cute catch song that tells you some interesting facts about the creature. My son just loved the song, he wanted me to keep replaying it from the very first time. I would definitely recommend this dvd it was fun and informative, I really like my son to watch something with some educational elements and Octonauts: Here Come the Octonauts does just that.",5,Here Comes The Fun With The Octonauts,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,756,"['NCircle', 'NSider', 'get', 'chance', 'review', 'new', 'movies', 'month', 'got', 'review', 'Octonauts', 'Here', 'Come', 'Octonauts', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Octonauts', 'watch', 'dvd', 'least', 'once', 'day', 'now', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'quickly', 'son', 'took', 'dvd', '6', 'episodes', 'one', 'teaches', 'new', 'sea', 'creature/animal', 'end', 'episode', 'do', 'Creature', 'Report', 'cute', 'catch', 'song', 'interesting', 'facts', 'creature', 'My', 'son', 'just', 'loved', 'song', 'wanted', 'keep', 'replaying', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'was', 'fun', 'informative', 'really', 'son', 'watch', 'something', 'educational', 'elements', 'Octonauts', 'Here', 'Come', 'Octonauts', 'just']",Octonauts-Here Comes the Octonauts

The Octonauts at first believe they have find a creature that is half sea urchin, half crab until Dr. Shellington explains to Captain Barnacles how the creatures benefit each other.The voices for the urchin and crab were hysterical, they argue because they don't appreciate each other and it is up to the Octonauts to stop the constant yelling and make them see why they need each other.This is an adorable CGI show and can be seen on Disney Junior.
