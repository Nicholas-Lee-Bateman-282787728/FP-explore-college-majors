753102,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00009ATIX,,"[5, 5]","For Sci-Fi lovers this is probably a great movie but for people who prefer their romance stories on earth it is a little too spacey.The director for this film is Steven Soderbergh and he tends to capture all of the scenes in dark close-ups of body parts and profiles while new age subliminal music plays in the background. There are too many moments of quiet and unexplained emotions shrouded in the complexities and visual harshness of a space station. The story is interesting but may have worked better on earth rather than aboard an alien type space mobile. Psychologist Kelvin (played by George Clooney) is called to resolve lost communications aboard a space station in orbit around an alien planet. From this point we are left to contemplate the circumstances taking place aboard the craft.George Clooney is decent in his role as a space psychologist attempting to resolve a mystery aboard a space station, but he has way too many dark close-ups. Aboard the ship he tries to deal with eerie circumstances that involve dead loved ones seeming to come back to the crew members in dreams or is it in reality. Jeremy Davies plays a kooky crew member who actually looks a little too much like Charles Manson to be likable! Clooney's wife is played nicely by Natascha McElhone. Clooney and McElhone pass back and forth between dreams and reality, future and past during their romance and old issues are brought forth in an attempt to re-configure them into something more reasonable. But the viewers are left to decide what truth is and what is misconstrued by the alien infection.The ending of this film is abstract and will leave one with a choice between heaven, dreams or reality as the existing environment. Will the future of love exist only under controlled circumstances or will life continue as normal far from the glow of Solaris?",2,Spacey!!,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,1841,"['Sci-Fi', 'lovers', 'probably', 'great', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'prefer', 'romance', 'stories', 'earth', 'little', 'too', 'spacey.The', 'director', 'film', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'capture', 'scenes', 'dark', 'close-ups', 'body', 'parts', 'profiles', 'new', 'age', 'subliminal', 'music', 'plays', 'background', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'quiet', 'unexplained', 'emotions', 'shrouded', 'complexities', 'visual', 'harshness', 'space', 'station', 'story', 'interesting', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'earth', 'rather', 'aboard', 'alien', 'type', 'space', 'mobile', 'Psychologist', 'Kelvin', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'called', 'resolve', 'lost', 'communications', 'space', 'station', 'orbit', 'alien', 'planet', 'point', 'are', 'left', 'contemplate', 'circumstances', 'taking', 'place', 'craft.George', 'Clooney', 'decent', 'role', 'space', 'psychologist', 'attempting', 'resolve', 'mystery', 'space', 'station', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'dark', 'close-ups', 'ship', 'deal', 'eerie', 'circumstances', 'involve', 'dead', 'loved', 'ones', 'seeming', 'come', 'back', 'crew', 'members', 'dreams', 'reality', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'kooky', 'crew', 'member', 'who', 'actually', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'be', 'likable', 'Clooney', 'wife', 'played', 'nicely', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Clooney', 'McElhone', 'pass', 'back', 'forth', 'dreams', 'reality', 'future', 'past', 'romance', 'old', 'issues', 'are', 'brought', 'forth', 'attempt', 're-configure', 'something', 'more', 'reasonable', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'decide', 'what', 'truth', 'what', 'misconstrued', 'alien', 'infection.The', 'ending', 'film', 'abstract', 'will', 'leave', 'one', 'choice', 'heaven', 'dreams', 'reality', 'existing', 'environment', 'Will', 'future', 'love', 'exist', 'only', 'controlled', 'circumstances', 'will', 'life', 'continue', 'normal', 'far', 'glow', 'Solaris']",Solaris

It had a very Kubrick feel to it.Parts of it had me transfixed, practically hypnotized, while others parts had me hopelessly frustrated.I agree that this movie is subtle. Sublety can be a great instrument to tell a tale such as this, but this one was a bit too subtle.My main problem with this film was that considering the scenario: people being visited by dead loved ones on a spaceship in orbit around an anomylous planet. Sounds scary to me.Unfortunately the movie built almost no suspense around this. I never felt that Chris was the least bit surprised except during thr initial contact with his dead wife. I don't know about you all but I would have been totally freaked. No ownder the rest of the crew went crazy - unfortunately this was never fully explored. lets delve into the mystery a little and build some suspense. Chris seemed to accept his dead wifes reanimation way too easily. I never felt the fear or the uncertainty radiate from Chris.I don't know, maybe I'm thick, but as hard as I tried I could not connect with the characters. Yes, the acting was all first rate, it is just the script left way too much to the imagination.I thought this could have been another 2001- A Space Odyssey if only... if only what?

753105,A17F2NEGBF8W94,B00009ATIX,Alex Tolley,"[4, 9]","For sci-fi lovers, this will not make your top 10.  What you get with the DVD is the theatrical version, a couple of standard self-promoting featurettes, an early version of the script and a commetary by Soderbergh and Cameron.  As the commentary states, this is not a remake of the Tarkovsky version, but a new interpretation.What is clear from the movie and the commentary, is that this film evolved into the &quot;love story&quot; theme from the more philosophical basis of Lem's book.  I cannot guess what the reasons for this were, but it shows in the inconsistency of the scenes.  An example is a flashback scene where Kelvin and his friends are discussing God and Kelvin declares that God need not exist. Yet because the nature of Solaris is not discussed in this movie, the content of the scene is irrelevant and is left in presumably as it depicts Rheya in one of her &quot;moods&quot;.Continuity problems are evident in the editing.  The scene where Rheya breaks through a door, as in the Tarkovsky version, is removed, but the destroyed door is not edited out of a dream sequence.  The commentary makes light of this, but this hides deeper problems with Soderbergh's script.  We know that Rheya is constructed from Kelvin's thoughts, yet she &quot;remembers&quot; her suicide, an event Kelvin did not see.As another reviewer has said, this film is more style than content.  And style there is, and it is a treat.  The Solaris station/ship is beautifully constructed and the cinematography is excellent.  Clooney does a credible job as the wounded Kelvin, although another actor, such as Douglas might have been more believable.  Jeremy Davies as Snow is wonderfully expressive.But for me, the movie disappoints.  In 90 minutes, we get a jumble of scenes wrapped into a love story, and a &quot;happy ending&quot;, yet the real mystery of Solaris is not broached, despite the main characters being scientists.  Imagine the Tarkovsky version with every major philosophical dialogue removed and every scene shortened.  Because of this, Solaris is not science fiction, but rather a redemption movie in sci-fi trappings. Soderbergh and Cameron have proved, like so many others in Hollywood, that making a science fiction movie without a good script, focussing on sets and CG effects to try to please a mass audience, just doesn't really work.Perhaps Soderbergh could release the &quot;philosophical&quot; version he started to make, then perhaps we could see if he had a better vision for the film he claims to have wanted to make.",3,Stylish but disappointing.,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,2536,"['sci-fi', 'lovers', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'top', '10', 'What', 'get', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'version', 'couple', 'standard', 'self-promoting', 'featurettes', 'early', 'version', 'script', 'commetary', 'Soderbergh', 'Cameron', 'commentary', 'states', 'not', 'remake', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'new', 'interpretation.What', 'clear', 'movie', 'commentary', 'film', 'evolved', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'theme', 'more', 'philosophical', 'basis', 'Lem', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'guess', 'what', 'reasons', 'were', 'inconsistency', 'scenes', 'example', 'flashback', 'scene', 'where', 'Kelvin', 'friends', 'are', 'discussing', 'God', 'Kelvin', 'God', 'need', 'not', 'exist', 'nature', 'Solaris', 'not', 'discussed', 'movie', 'content', 'scene', 'irrelevant', 'left', 'presumably', 'Rheya', 'one', 'quot', 'moods', 'quot', '.Continuity', 'problems', 'are', 'evident', 'editing', 'scene', 'where', 'Rheya', 'door', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'removed', 'destroyed', 'door', 'not', 'edited', 'dream', 'sequence', 'commentary', 'light', 'deeper', 'problems', 'Soderbergh', 'script', 'know', 'Rheya', 'constructed', 'Kelvin', 'thoughts', 'yet', 'quot', 'remembers', 'quot', 'suicide', 'event', 'Kelvin', 'did', 'not', 'see.As', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'more', 'style', 'content', 'style', 'treat', 'Solaris', 'station/ship', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'Clooney', 'credible', 'job', 'wounded', 'Kelvin', 'actor', 'such', 'Douglas', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Snow', 'wonderfully', 'expressive.But', 'movie', 'disappoints', '90', 'minutes', 'get', 'jumble', 'scenes', 'wrapped', 'love', 'story', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'yet', 'real', 'mystery', 'Solaris', 'not', 'broached', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'scientists', 'Imagine', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'major', 'philosophical', 'dialogue', 'removed', 'scene', 'shortened', 'Solaris', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'rather', 'redemption', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'trappings', 'Soderbergh', 'Cameron', 'have', 'proved', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'good', 'script', 'focussing', 'sets', 'CG', 'effects', 'try', 'please', 'mass', 'audience', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'work.Perhaps', 'Soderbergh', 'could', 'release', 'quot', 'philosophical', 'quot', 'version', 'started', 'make', 'then', 'perhaps', 'could', 'see', 'had', 'better', 'vision', 'film', 'have', 'wanted', 'make']",Solaris

Saying that it is protracted, dull, painfully slow and confusing is probably being kind, as what started out as a ""great idea for a movie"" has succumb to an over self indulgent directors depiction of a fairly bland screenplay. George Clooney travels to a distant galaxy where he meets his deceased wife via almost tangible flashback sequences and seems to be part of a special mission to discover the meaning of life, or something like it. Unfortunately, when one recalls, or even reads older Sci Fi literature of the type so ground braking by the likes of Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick and the like, one thing is painfully obvious. Great Fiction literature lives and flourishes in the subjective imagination of the reader NOT the viewer. And it is incredibly difficult to succesfully make the transition from page to screen without losing a lot in the process. I have not actaully read the book that this movie is based on, but feel sure this depiction will pale in comparison to a probably reasonable, if pulp style story.

753112,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00009ATIX,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Just as effective as the 1972 original, yet for vastly different reasons, Steven Soderbergh's triumphant sci-fi masterpiece is an intellectually stimulating look at loneliness, love and eventual madness.  The film is stunning to look at, with each set piece moving in such stimulating manners; and the film itself has such a ferocious fluidity that completely takes you over.  It is hypnotic in a way, shifting rather effortlessly from present day moments to flashback sequences.  The film, in a more modern sense, is far more visually captivating than the original film (both films are adapted from the novel written by Stanislaw Lem, so it would be inaccurate to say that this 2002 film is a remake of Tarkovsky's '72 masterpiece).  Both films, while constructively different, are marvelous cinematic feats.  I think that, overall, Tarkovsky's film makes the strongest statement (and it remains haunting regardless of how many times I watch it), but that is no discredit to the work that Soderbergh does with this underrated classic.Why isn't this loved deeply by all?Chris Kelvin is a psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet.  That particular station has stopped all communications, and Kelvin is sent to investigate why.  When Kelvin arrives he is quickly absorbed into the manipulated atmosphere created by the glowing orb lingering outside the space station.  Infiltrating his inner desires, this planet projects Kelvin's deceased wife.  Kelvin's rationality initially rejects this reincarnation but with persistence this planet is able to get inside his head, where he wholly accepts this woman as the root of all happiness.Soderbergh's interpretation of the source material is vastly different than Tarkovsky's.  Apparently, neither director appeased the novel's author, who was vocally opposed to both film adaptations.  Where Tarkovsky projected a coldness that seemed to highlight the story's more intellectual side, Soderbergh plays to the romantic, creating a more warm and embracive texture with the film.  The film is a visual marvel, and Soderbergh uses that element with such finesse.The performances here are all top notch.  Clooney really sinks into the role, and while his character can at moments feel more observational than anything else (like a mere canvas for those around him to paint), he grounds his performance in a `felt' emotional resistance.  Viola Davis is extraordinary here, finding a solemn depth of character that lives in the small moments.  Jeremy Davies provides small splashes of humor that break up the film's consistent tension, and Natascha McElhone uses more than just her stunning looks to captivate the audience (and Clooney).I can understand why some are put off by this film; for it is not the most accessible feature film.  Honestly though, this is a stunning piece of work, and it serves as a complimentary piece to Tarkovsky's version because they tell two sides of the same story, or two variations, so that we can get a fuller picture, which in the end may be exactly what Stanislaw Lem would have wished us to see.",5,Become entranced...,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,3091,"['Just', 'as', 'effective', '1972', 'original', 'yet', 'vastly', 'different', 'reasons', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'triumphant', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'look', 'loneliness', 'love', 'eventual', 'madness', 'film', 'stunning', 'look', 'set', 'piece', 'moving', 'such', 'stimulating', 'manners', 'film', 'ferocious', 'fluidity', 'completely', 'hypnotic', 'way', 'shifting', 'rather', 'effortlessly', 'present', 'day', 'moments', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'film', 'more', 'modern', 'sense', 'far', 'more', 'visually', 'captivating', 'original', 'film', 'films', 'are', 'adapted', 'novel', 'written', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'would', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'say', '2002', 'film', 'remake', 'Tarkovsky', ""'72"", 'masterpiece', 'films', 'constructively', 'different', 'are', 'marvelous', 'cinematic', 'feats', 'think', 'overall', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'strongest', 'statement', 'haunting', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'discredit', 'work', 'Soderbergh', 'underrated', 'classic.Why', ""n't"", 'loved', 'deeply', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'psychologist', 'sent', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'alien', 'planet', 'particular', 'station', 'stopped', 'communications', 'Kelvin', 'sent', 'investigate', 'why', 'When', 'Kelvin', 'quickly', 'absorbed', 'manipulated', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'glowing', 'lingering', 'space', 'station', 'Infiltrating', 'inner', 'desires', 'planet', 'projects', 'Kelvin', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Kelvin', 'rationality', 'initially', 'reincarnation', 'persistence', 'planet', 'able', 'get', 'head', 'where', 'wholly', 'woman', 'root', 'happiness.Soderbergh', 'interpretation', 'source', 'material', 'vastly', 'different', 'Tarkovsky', 'Apparently', 'director', 'appeased', 'novel', 'author', 'who', 'was', 'vocally', 'opposed', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Where', 'Tarkovsky', 'projected', 'coldness', 'seemed', 'highlight', 'story', 'more', 'intellectual', 'side', 'Soderbergh', 'romantic', 'creating', 'more', 'warm', 'embracive', 'texture', 'film', 'film', 'visual', 'marvel', 'Soderbergh', 'element', 'such', 'finesse.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Clooney', 'really', 'role', 'character', 'can', 'moments', 'feel', 'more', 'observational', 'anything', 'else', 'mere', 'canvas', 'paint', 'performance', 'felt', 'emotional', 'resistance', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'extraordinary', 'here', 'finding', 'solemn', 'depth', 'character', 'small', 'moments', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'small', 'splashes', 'humor', 'up', 'film', 'consistent', 'tension', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'more', 'just', 'stunning', 'looks', 'captivate', 'audience', 'Clooney', '.I', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'not', 'most', 'accessible', 'feature', 'film', 'Honestly', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work', 'complimentary', 'piece', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'tell', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'story', 'two', 'variations', 'can', 'get', 'fuller', 'picture', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'see']",Solaris

It begins with psychologist Chris Kelvin being sent to the space station orbitting the planet Solaris in a last-ditch effort to re-establish contact. When he gets there he finds the remnants of the crew haunted by some strange phenomena. They are playing host to some uninvited ""visitors"". In due course, Kelvin gets a visitor of his own, in the form of his dead wife.The hows, whys and wherefors of this situation could have made for a pretty interesting and intense tale. There are some intense and emotional moments as Kelvin tries to grapple with the situation and his own personal baggage, and the acting is generally good, too. As one character comments, however, ""there are no answers, only questions"". That's an accurate summation of SOLARIS. It raises lots of questions in the viewers mind, but never answers any of them. Instead, after providing almost no action and deadening viewer's senses with ponderous visual interludes accompanied only by station background noise, the story concludes without any real resolution and without any explanation of what was going on.SOLARIS has its plusses, but it isn't a movie most people will enjoy watching.

The only reason this movie received three stars was Soderbergh's brilliant style of directing. Having said that, I must say the same cannot be said for his writing. The movie had a great premise, but somewhere in Soderbergh's writing the premise was lost. I could care less about the characters. How am I supposed to feel for these people, if I do not know anything about them? He also did a less than stellar job devolping a reason for us to care for Clooney's wife. In fact, the stuff that she did made me dislike her even more. Clooney's performance has been touted by many people, but to me, it wasn't that great. It was definitely good, but not Tom Hanks quality. His performance has more to do with lack of script quality. The only good part was of the stoner on the ship.

Tarkovsky's 'SOLARIS' was about many things, all handled with the skill of a master who believed in the mental fortitude of his audience.

His approach, as it happens, it quite simple-minded: he positions the failed relationship between Kelvin and Rheya as the the singular issue of existence.  There's some philosophy 101 tossed in for good measure, but mostly, you don't have to think watching this new 'SOLARIS'.  Science-Fiction is a genre of ideas, of complexity, something Soderbergh failed to see.  Sure, points go for trying something serious but really, the scope and density of the subject is just beyond him.  The film tries to attone in it's climax, a climax where the station plunges into the beautiful ocean of Solaris but even here, the filmmaker doesn't trust the intelligence of the viewer and he insults them by having Kelvin reconcile with Rheya after his faux suicide (his reunion after death is Christian romanticism which would've surely offended Lem and which even Tarkovsky at his most sentimental would've never attempted)...

It never really decides which ones it wants to focus on.I think the most interesting ones are about control and culpability in relationships.  Kelvin feels responsible for his wife's suicide, so when she reappears he is less concerned with her as a person than he is in making sure he never loses her again.

Especially the fact that Kentucky native George Clooney was the lead actor in the production, along with the lovely British actress Natascha McElhone. In many ways, this was more entertaining and watchable than your average Star Wars and Star Trek film.Much like 2001, but with some romantic overtones, Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is an interesting mix of metaphysical and cerebral science fiction, with a love story thrown in. Not only was the storyline very solid and multi-dimensional, the sets, the costumes, the special visual effects, and soundtrack were all beautiful. The actors and actresses did a remarkable job in the roles, along with the material they were given.Based on Polish science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem's novel, Solaris tells the story of a 21st Century psychologist who receives a message from a scientist friend of his on a space station orbiting a mysterious planet named Solaris. Chris Kelvin, the psychologist is asked by his friend if he could come to the space station named Prometheus and find out what is going on. Apparently, some strange and unusual incidents have been occuring.Still recovering from the tragic death of his wife, Kelvin journeys to the space station and discovers the fact that his friend has mysteriously died, one of the scientists is acting irrationally, and the other is frightened. While determining the cause of all of the events, Chris is suddenly visited by an image of his deceased wife. From there, Chris and the two surviving scientists determine that the ocean planet they are orbiting his a sentient form of life that is recreating the images of those from a tragic moment in their past. As to why this alien intelligence is committing these acts, remains an unknown factor.I haven't seen Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of the film, so I really can't compare this film with the older version. I can say this, it helps to read the book first before viewing the film. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Soderbergh's version of Solaris. Not only does the film stay true to Lem's book in some levels, it also paints an interesting picture in Freudian terms. It states an interesting fact about how well do we know other people and at the same time how well we know ourselves. In all honesty, this was probably the best film out of 2002! It may have the qualities of a science fiction art house film, but it is still entertaining. One that I look forward to purchasing on DVD this summer.If you enjoy science fiction that makes you think, instead of the ususal shoot them and blow them up types, then you will be pleased with Solaris.

753129,AMVMEHGE80PSI,B00009ATIX,"Christopher Loring Knowles ""secretsun.blogspo...","[9, 12]","As several other reviewers have noted, Soderbergh's Solaris is as much a tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey as it is to the Russian original. Like 2001, it uses the trappings of science fiction to ponder the big questions in life. Like 2001, the pace is slow and languid, and may be a turn-off to many Sci-Fi buffs. Unlike 2001, Solaris lacks an explosive climax like the sequence in 2001 where Dave communes with the Monolith. But the ending of the film (which I won't give away) provides the kind of emotional payoff that Kubrick was incapable of ever giving to his viewers.Clooney, breaking from his usual role of charming cad, plays Chris Kelvin, tormented by the suicide of his wife Rheya, played by the luminescent Natascha McElhone (currently being wasted in NBC's dismal doomsday drama, Revelations). Soderbergh is obviously enchanted by McElhone's saucer eyes and womanly radiance and he clearly wants us to be as well. Huge chunks of the movie are composed of tight shots of McElhone's alluring gaze and mischievous, toothy grin. You never knew hard SciFi could be so sexy...Kelvin's grief has broken him, and the film shows him sleepwalking through life. But his stupor is broken when he is summoned to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris to deal with an undisclosed emergency. When he arrives he finds only two remaning members, Gordon (Viola Davis), a senior officer consumed by raging paranoia, and Snow (the always terrific Jeremy Davies), a manic stoner/geek type, given to Method-y tics and spontaneous outbursts. He soon discovers that Solaris is recreating flesh and blood apparitions of the crew's loved ones and that phenomena has led to the crisis about the station. Following a tantalizing dream sequence where the courtship of Chris and Rheya is replayed (made even more hypnotic by Cliff Martinez' mesemerizing score), Chris finds himself unknowingly making love to the reincarnated Rheya. He wakes to find her in his bed and the drama begins.This is a very talky movie and the viewer is required to pay attention. But what Soderbergh is striving to do is create a sense of absolute reality, so the incredible nature of Solaris' regenerative power can be made manifest. Instead of injecting the story with the kind of nauseating ""action"" pap that Hollywood bilge like Paycheck  or Total Recall inflicts on poor, blameless Philip K Dick, Soderbergh goes  in the exact opposite direction and uses intimacy and mundanity to drive home the metaphysical drama.This is a film that Dick would have loved, and is more in tune with his ouevre than with Stanislaw Lem's (who write the original story). What hasn't been commented on however is the big issues that Solaris ultimately raises. Solaris produces these pseudo-people ultimately to colonize other worlds, a fact that Gordon raises in a row with Chris. I want humanity to win, she says cryptically, and Chris doesn't realize the full weight of those worlds until the film's conclusion. If Solaris produces humans simply to colonize other worlds, why does Earth?Solaris'  pleasures are many. Martinez's soundtrack is one of the most beautiful in recent memory. The acting is flawless and the chemistry between Clooney and McElhone is hypnotic. The film's few special effects are artfully done. The DVD's extras are extraneous and actually detract from the power and majesty of the film, so don't watch them together.",5,Soderbergh Pays Tribute...,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,3394,"['several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Soderbergh', 'Solaris', 'as', 'much', 'tribute', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Russian', 'original', '2001', 'trappings', 'science', 'fiction', 'ponder', 'big', 'questions', 'life', '2001', 'pace', 'slow', 'languid', 'may', 'be', 'turn-off', 'many', 'Sci-Fi', 'buffs', '2001', 'Solaris', 'explosive', 'climax', 'sequence', '2001', 'where', 'Dave', 'Monolith', 'ending', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'kind', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'incapable', 'ever', 'giving', 'viewers.Clooney', 'breaking', 'usual', 'role', 'charming', 'cad', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'tormented', 'suicide', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'played', 'luminescent', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'currently', 'being', 'wasted', 'NBC', 'dismal', 'doomsday', 'drama', 'Revelations', 'Soderbergh', 'obviously', 'enchanted', 'McElhone', 'saucer', 'eyes', 'womanly', 'radiance', 'clearly', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'Huge', 'chunks', 'movie', 'are', 'composed', 'tight', 'shots', 'McElhone', 'alluring', 'gaze', 'mischievous', 'toothy', 'grin', 'never', 'knew', 'hard', 'SciFi', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'sexy', 'Kelvin', 'grief', 'broken', 'film', 'sleepwalking', 'life', 'stupor', 'broken', 'when', 'summoned', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'deal', 'undisclosed', 'emergency', 'When', 'only', 'two', 'remaning', 'members', 'Gordon', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'senior', 'officer', 'consumed', 'raging', 'paranoia', 'Snow', 'always', 'terrific', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'manic', 'stoner/geek', 'type', 'given', 'Method-y', 'tics', 'spontaneous', 'outbursts', 'soon', 'Solaris', 'recreating', 'flesh', 'blood', 'apparitions', 'crew', 'loved', 'ones', 'phenomena', 'led', 'crisis', 'station', 'Following', 'tantalizing', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'courtship', 'Chris', 'Rheya', 'replayed', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'hypnotic', 'Cliff', 'Martinez', 'mesemerizing', 'score', 'Chris', 'unknowingly', 'making', 'love', 'reincarnated', 'Rheya', 'find', 'bed', 'drama', 'begins.This', 'very', 'talky', 'movie', 'viewer', 'required', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'Soderbergh', 'striving', 'do', 'create', 'sense', 'absolute', 'reality', 'incredible', 'nature', 'Solaris', 'regenerative', 'power', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'manifest', 'Instead', 'injecting', 'story', 'kind', 'nauseating', 'action', 'pap', 'Hollywood', 'bilge', 'Paycheck', 'Total', 'Recall', 'poor', 'blameless', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'Soderbergh', 'exact', 'opposite', 'direction', 'intimacy', 'mundanity', 'drive', 'home', 'metaphysical', 'drama.This', 'film', 'Dick', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'tune', 'ouevre', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'who', 'write', 'original', 'story', 'What', ""n't"", 'been', 'commented', 'however', 'big', 'issues', 'Solaris', 'ultimately', 'Solaris', 'pseudo-people', 'ultimately', 'colonize', 'other', 'worlds', 'fact', 'Gordon', 'row', 'Chris', 'want', 'humanity', 'win', 'cryptically', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'realize', 'full', 'weight', 'worlds', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Solaris', 'humans', 'simply', 'colonize', 'other', 'worlds', 'why', 'Earth', 'Solaris', 'pleasures', 'are', 'many', 'Martinez', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'recent', 'memory', 'acting', 'flawless', 'chemistry', 'Clooney', 'McElhone', 'hypnotic', 'film', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'artfully', 'done', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'extraneous', 'actually', 'detract', 'power', 'majesty', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'together']",Solaris

I had always heard of Solaris but never even bothered to watch it since honestly, I always got the feeling there was something better in the video store. After realizing nothing caught my fancy, I decided to check it out. It's certainly a very stylized and at times striking movie, it's also a case of a movie that's not for everyone. I knew I wasn't expecting some sci-fi shooter like Alien but I didn't expect it to be so serious.Chris Kelvin is a scientist who gets called to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Some of the members are dead and the 2 left seem very spaced out and weird. Haunted by the recent death of his wife, he's shocked to find his wife Rheya is up and about. Why is she here and more importantly: is Chris going to reject or embrace this strange re-apperance of his wife.Solaris, the original, can be seen as a response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001. But whereas that film was more ambigious and has more sci-fi meanings, this is more of a character study than anything. For some, it's a great chance to see George Clooney pull out some acting chops while for others it's just a really slow movie with a whole lot of nothing happening. Some will definately hate it while others will find it underrated and misunderstood. For me, I have no clue what this one is.It's a weird state of affairs when the commentary is even more enjoyable than the film itself. Done by director Steven Sodenbergh and fellow director James Cameron, the 2 discuss the film and how the film might've been different if Cameron did it. It's always a weird geek moment when 2 directors chat but you wish it was on a more better movie. And of course we get the ever standard EPK making-of stuff. Even if you rent the movie, at least watch the commentary too.Is it a recommendable movie? I have no clue.

Agreed, but the movie clocks in at half the length of Tarkovsky's, so naturally many of the philosophical threads can't be addressed. Lem, like many other writers in similar situations, needs to stop thinking of his novel as the sacred scripture from which the adapting artist should not deviate. He should understand that hacking a text to pieces, selling it for spare parts, junking what doesn't fit, reassembling it--this is high praise. Soderbergh does a great job with the story, and with the camera (as usual, though he was coming off of &quot;Full Frontal&quot; which has my vote for the worst movie of the last 10 or 15 years), and the performances are all fantastic as well.

753134,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00009ATIX,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[10, 12]","Just like the old Talking Heads song, psychologist Chris Kelvin wakes up in his spartan sleeping chamber aboard a space station orbiting the enigmatic planet Solaris to discover his wife Rheya by his side. His beautiful wife, awake, close to his side, easing him out of one nightmare and into another.There's one minor complication: Rheya has been dead for years.So there you have it: Kelvin, stunned, having a David Byrne-esque ""Once in a Lifetime"" moment, wondering ""is this my beautiful wife""? And for much of Steven Soderbergh's heartbreaking, masterful, quiet and searing ""Solaris"", the supposition is that maybe that doesn't matter very much.""Solaris"" is not Soderbergh's finest hour---for that look to ""Kafka"". But that said, it is a quiet masterpiece, a brave film that operates solely on its own terms and offers the viewer absolutely no quarter nor compromise. Surrender yourself and your time to the film's immediacy, just as the survivors on the film's spartan space station give themselves over to the unknowable forces on the planet, and you will probably be as moved as I was.Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel and reprising the material in Andrei Tarkovsky's epic Russian film, Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" is only incidentally science fiction. It's more a thin skein of science fiction stretched taut across a dense, luminous surface of human pain, of the anguish and fallibility of memory, of love, of love lost, of the possibility of redemption. That's really what Soderberg wants to cut down into, and he wields a brutally sharp scalpel here.Have you lost the thing you loved most in your life? Have you lost true love? Fine: what would you do if you thought you could reclaim it, salvage the moment you lost it, make things right again?What would that be worth to you?What would you do to get it?That, in essence, is ""Solaris"". Oh yes, to be sure, the plot is about a space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris; the station's corporate owners have lost contact with it, and a rescue team is equally silent. The DBA Corporation turns to Clooney's Chris Kelvin (bravely and masterfully played by George Clooney, who owns this film), a psychologist who was a colleague of the station's chief scientist Gibarian, who had sent across a mysterious invitation to Kelvin before the first security team had been dispatched. He arrives to a scene of unnervingly, creepily quiet chaos, with Gibarian dead and the rest of the crew having retreated to their separate quarters, plagued by what they contend are visions.Much like Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"", ""Solaris"" suffered from a marketing campaign that perhaps emphasized too much the science fiction elements of the piece. The space station, the planet, the sere, technical, sleek surfaces of the examination rooms and sleeping quarters are merely palletes on which Clooney paints his own internal torment and very private suffering, writ large; the space setting is, like Holocaust-era Warsaw in ""The Pianist"", almost incidental to the movie. This film could have been set anywhere---underground, in the desert, in a skyscraper penthouse.Soderbergh directs deftly, fluidly, using his technically precise sets as counterpoints to the choices the crew of the space station must make. The acting here is top-notch: Clooney turns in a laser-perfect performance, Natasha McElhone is remarkably poised and completely convincing, Jeremy Davies provides a few wan laughs as the unnerved Snow, and Viola Davis fights the good fight as Gordon, who absolutely, positively will not let the Human Race be undone by good intentions. And here, by the way, is just one of trillions of deft little touches Soderbergh uses, this one hinting of alien invasion: what better way for some vast intelligence to undermine humanity than by burrowing at us through our emotions?For all the breathtaking expansiveness of the shots, which draw favorable comparison with Kubrick's work in 2001, this is an interior movie, and the film lives or dies on the chemistry and work between Clooney and McElhone. For my money, they are remarkable together. Each scene between them, each line, each breath, each facial contortion, tells; there is not a wasted sequence or shot here, and technically this may very well be Soderbergh's most compact, complete, and least pretentious film.Tragedy, horror story, dark night of the soul, fable of a love lost---whatever it is, ""Solaris"" is unforgettable.",5,This is not my Beautiful Wife...,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,4424,"['Just', 'old', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'song', 'psychologist', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'up', 'spartan', 'sleeping', 'chamber', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'enigmatic', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'discover', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'side', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'awake', 'close', 'side', 'easing', 'one', 'nightmare', 'one', 'minor', 'complication', 'Rheya', 'been', 'dead', 'years.So', 'there', 'have', 'Kelvin', 'stunned', 'having', 'David', 'Byrne-esque', 'Once', 'Lifetime', 'moment', 'wondering', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'much', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'heartbreaking', 'masterful', 'quiet', 'searing', 'Solaris', 'supposition', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'matter', 'very', 'much', 'Solaris', 'not', 'Soderbergh', 'finest', 'hour', '-for', 'look', 'Kafka', 'said', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'brave', 'film', 'solely', 'own', 'terms', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'quarter', 'compromise', 'Surrender', 'time', 'film', 'immediacy', 'just', 'survivors', 'film', 'spartan', 'space', 'station', 'give', 'unknowable', 'forces', 'planet', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'as', 'moved', 'was.Based', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'novel', 'reprising', 'material', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'epic', 'Russian', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'Solaris', 'only', 'incidentally', 'science', 'fiction', 'more', 'thin', 'skein', 'science', 'fiction', 'stretched', 'taut', 'dense', 'luminous', 'surface', 'human', 'pain', 'anguish', 'fallibility', 'memory', 'love', 'love', 'lost', 'possibility', 'redemption', 'really', 'what', 'Soderberg', 'cut', 'down', 'brutally', 'sharp', 'scalpel', 'here.Have', 'lost', 'thing', 'loved', 'most', 'life', 'Have', 'lost', 'true', 'love', 'Fine', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'thought', 'could', 'reclaim', 'salvage', 'moment', 'lost', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'again', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'get', 'essence', 'Solaris', 'Oh', 'yes', 'be', 'sure', 'plot', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'station', 'corporate', 'owners', 'have', 'lost', 'contact', 'rescue', 'team', 'equally', 'silent', 'DBA', 'Corporation', 'Clooney', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'bravely', 'masterfully', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'film', 'psychologist', 'who', 'was', 'colleague', 'station', 'chief', 'scientist', 'Gibarian', 'who', 'had', 'sent', 'mysterious', 'invitation', 'Kelvin', 'first', 'security', 'team', 'had', 'been', 'dispatched', 'scene', 'unnervingly', 'creepily', 'quiet', 'chaos', 'Gibarian', 'dead', 'rest', 'crew', 'having', 'retreated', 'separate', 'quarters', 'plagued', 'what', 'contend', 'are', 'visions.Much', 'Polanski', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'Solaris', 'suffered', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'perhaps', 'emphasized', 'too', 'much', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements', 'piece', 'space', 'station', 'planet', 'sere', 'technical', 'sleek', 'surfaces', 'examination', 'rooms', 'sleeping', 'quarters', 'are', 'merely', 'palletes', 'Clooney', 'own', 'internal', 'torment', 'very', 'private', 'suffering', 'writ', 'large', 'space', 'setting', 'Holocaust-era', 'Warsaw', 'Pianist', 'almost', 'incidental', 'movie', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'anywhere', '-underground', 'desert', 'skyscraper', 'penthouse.Soderbergh', 'deftly', 'fluidly', 'using', 'technically', 'precise', 'sets', 'counterpoints', 'choices', 'crew', 'space', 'station', 'must', 'make', 'acting', 'here', 'top-notch', 'Clooney', 'laser-perfect', 'performance', 'Natasha', 'McElhone', 'remarkably', 'poised', 'completely', 'convincing', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'few', 'wan', 'unnerved', 'Snow', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'good', 'fight', 'Gordon', 'who', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'Human', 'Race', 'be', 'undone', 'good', 'intentions', 'here', 'way', 'just', 'one', 'trillions', 'deft', 'little', 'touches', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'hinting', 'alien', 'invasion', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'vast', 'intelligence', 'undermine', 'humanity', 'burrowing', 'emotions', 'breathtaking', 'expansiveness', 'shots', 'draw', 'favorable', 'comparison', 'Kubrick', 'work', '2001', 'interior', 'movie', 'film', 'chemistry', 'work', 'Clooney', 'McElhone', 'money', 'are', 'remarkable', 'together', 'scene', 'line', 'breath', 'facial', 'contortion', 'not', 'wasted', 'sequence', 'shot', 'here', 'technically', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Soderbergh', 'most', 'compact', 'complete', 'least', 'pretentious', 'film.Tragedy', 'horror', 'story', 'dark', 'night', 'soul', 'fable', 'love', 'lost', 'Solaris', 'unforgettable']",Solaris

This particular interpretation should have never been released to mainstream audiences.  The masses were never going to be pleased.  Solaris is a ""fine arts"" production.  George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Steven Soderbergh, and the other major artists were essentially committing themselves, whether they knew it or not, to a work of love.  Who am I?  Is there a God? Do our lives make any sense?  What does it mean to have a soul?  Can a copy of a person be almost as good as the real one?  Are the dead able to be brought back to life in some way?  These existential questions underpin the story. George Clooney effectively portrays a man who is reacquainted with his dead wife (McElhone).

A security team previously dispatched has disappeared and the station's captain has requested Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) to help investigate strange events that have overcome the crew.  Dr. Kelvin arrives to find only two of the five crew members alive and in various states of paranoia.  They are unable to describe what is happening until Dr. Kelvin's wife -- dead for three years -- reappears at the station.  Dr. Kelvin is torn between his professional objectivity and love for his wife to resolve the situation.Solaris is a very thought-provoking feature that questions conventional thinking and beliefs about human existence.  The reappearance of Dr. Kelvin's wife -- Rheya (Natascha McElhone) -- is obviously due to the mysterious powers of Solaris, but Dr. Kelvin and the crew are unable to determine if she, and others who've appeared, are facsimiles or resurrections.  Rheya is disturbingly of flesh and blood; herself wondering what is happening.  The story keeps viewers guessing until the very end on what Dr. Kelvin will do, and even then leaves open questions on what happened.This is science fiction of earlier genre that is more philosophical than action adventure.  While the story's tempo moves slowly, it's an intriguing piece that breaks the bounds of conventional wisdom.  The actors are good, the special effects are understated but excellent, and the film's music soundtrack is magnetic.",4,Solaris,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1570,"['Philosophical', 'science', 'fiction', 'psychologist', 'sent', 'rescue', 'corporation', 'research', 'station', 'lost', 'orbit', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'named', 'Solaris', 'A', 'security', 'team', 'previously', 'dispatched', 'disappeared', 'station', 'captain', 'requested', 'Dr.', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'George', 'Clooney', 'help', 'investigate', 'strange', 'events', 'have', 'overcome', 'crew', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'find', 'only', 'two', 'five', 'crew', 'members', 'alive', 'various', 'states', 'paranoia', 'are', 'unable', 'describe', 'what', 'happening', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'wife', 'dead', 'three', 'years', 'station', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'torn', 'professional', 'objectivity', 'love', 'wife', 'resolve', 'situation.Solaris', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'feature', 'questions', 'conventional', 'thinking', 'beliefs', 'human', 'existence', 'reappearance', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'obviously', 'due', 'mysterious', 'powers', 'Solaris', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'crew', 'are', 'unable', 'determine', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'appeared', 'are', 'facsimiles', 'resurrections', 'Rheya', 'disturbingly', 'flesh', 'blood', 'wondering', 'what', 'happening', 'story', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Kelvin', 'will', 'do', 'even', 'then', 'open', 'questions', 'what', 'happened.This', 'science', 'fiction', 'earlier', 'genre', 'more', 'philosophical', 'action', 'adventure', 'story', 'tempo', 'moves', 'slowly', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'bounds', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'understated', 'excellent', 'film', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'magnetic']",Solaris
753142,ACXDDDPTK8OL,B00009ATIX,Deckard,"[6, 13]","A film is not boring because of who stars in it who writes it or who directs it. It's not boring because it belongs to a specific genre, is in black and white, old, new, subtitled, or over 3 hours in duration. It's not boring because it's thought provoking or mindless, looks fantastic or has a very low budget. No. For a film to attain 'boring' status it has to somehow manage to possess a very specific and unique combination of properties. To be honest I have so rarely watched a film that I could call boring and entirely without merit that I couldn't even tell you exactly what those properties are. All I can tell you is that when such a film is playing before you, you will gradually become aware of a question emanating up from the deepest depths of your brain. Quietly at first, then louder, and with increasing regularity until you have hit the 40 minute mark and it's screaming at you for action. That question is:Should I turn the tv off now and rescue the next hour of my life, or will I regret not knowing what happened at the end of the film?Sometimes you might reach the 40 minute point, ask this question of yourself, and you may opt to stick it out. If that happens then the film has merit - because although it may have it's flaws, it has at least hooked you just enough to not desert it. On the other hand at this particular stage a film might just be so dull, so badly scripted, badly paced, badly exectuted and altogether thoroughly disengaging - that the only course of action is to reach for that remote control before you start chewing the furniture. Ladies and Gentlemen - I give you such a film. Solaris 2002 with George Clooney. An hour and a half of eye-watering tedium. So sluggish and boring that I have even written to the Oxford Engish Dictionary to emplore them to just replace the word 'tedious' with a photo of the DVD cover. so boring that even the current word 'boring' in the english dictionary can't adequatly descrive the effect this film had on me. I really don't care whether Solaris is a planet, a sentient being, a god, or an entirely new plane of existence. I don't even care about the questions the film raises about space, technology, love, or faith. It's bored me so much that I'm too busy questioning my own faith to worry about that of those on the film. After all, how can there really be a God when honest and good people are made to suffer and endure films such as this?Ok, so it looks nice. There's some spacey bits, a big swirly thing, and some metal corridors and stuff that look all shiny. I like the rain falling on the window too - that happens a couple of times. There's some nice incidental music in there also. So if that sounds like a magical hour and a half for you, you're onto a winner here - more so if you'd like a look at George Clooney's bottom. I've never seen the original (film that is, not bottom..), and unfortunately this version has ensured that I will never see it either which is a shame.",1,Can't sleep?

Clearly there is a difference of opinion, a sharp difference. While no Sci-Fi buff, I have enjoyed many in the long line of such films that began with the experimental French film at the turn of the century (19th to 20th). However, Solaris is a film in which the science fiction aspects are quite irrelevant. They are used only as a backdrop to a man-woman story that could have been put into any setting with slight adjustment.The story itself might have benefited from a supername on the marque; but, through no fault of George Clooney, his presence does not salvage the lackadaisical script and direction.

Unlike most sci-fi, it has nothing to do with space battles, the colonization of alien planets or anything like that.  The plot of this film is a bit more introspective and perhaps even cerebral.The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it.  The story can also be described as erotic in timbre, although there is no nudity.  The subtle but pulsing soundtrack lends a hand to tell the story in a memorable fashion.  If you like movies with a mysterious flavor to them, you're bound to enjoy this one.The basic premise of the movie centers around a research station that is way out there orbiting above a planet called Solaris.  While there, the crew encounters an ambivalent alien force and strange things begin to happen.  A shrink from Earth (George Clooney) is called in to investigate.Unfortunately, instead of clearing things up, things get even stranger once the psychologist arrives at the station.  As there are so few crew on the station, the rest of the movie has more of a feel of a play than a standard film.The one motif that passed thru my mind as I watched this film was the TWILIGHT ZONE.

(Of course, the classification is simplified; a movie like ""Minority Report"" can bridge the gap between the two sub-genres).  ""Solaris"" belongs firmly in the ""2001"" school of sci-fi, which may explain why I liked it - and why it failed at the box office.Cerebral science fiction movies demand patience and active involvement and almost always disappoint the masses.  (Recent examples include ""Gattaca"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence,"" films I admired that achieved something less than blockbuster status).  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's ""Solaris,"" which extends a concept that might have driven the plot of a Star Trek episode to feature-film length. That ""Solaris"" feels longer than its 99-minute running time is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a philosophical movie that eschews action, effects and violence, and is content to linger on moments and details as it considers its trenchant themes.I can't say too much without giving anything away.  The setup is that Dr. Kelvin (played by Soderbergh favorite George Clooney) is summoned to a space station where some sort of disaster has occurred.  (Imagine how ""2001"" might have played out if Heywood Floyd's Clavius Base cover story had been true, and you'll get the idea). Shortly after arriving on the Solaris base, Clooney meets the survivors, and soon understands why they don't want to leave.Soderbergh's directs efficiently, and the performances by Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies, and Ulrich Tukur all resonate.  Soderbergh wisely uses special effects to serve the story, based on Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel of the same name.  (I haven't seen the 1972 Russian film also based on Lem's novel, but this version inspires me to seek it out).""Solaris"" asks us to consider many questions: What would we do if given a chance to relive the past?  How important is memory to our concepts of our loved ones?  Would we choose a false happiness over the ups and downs of reality? ""Solaris"" uses a futuristic setting to explore these questions eloquently and profoundly, leaving the viewer to supply the answers.

As a fan of Tarkovsky's original adaptation of Lem's novel, and as someone who heard from many the Clooney remake/reintepretation was terrible, I was pleasantly surprised: there is *acting* here, pretty good acting considering the hard-to-believe plot (the planet is actually a creature, not a planet), and the story unfolds beautifully with eye-candy shots.  Like Tarkovsky's film, Soderbergh is careful to make this about human being in an inhuman context.  Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack (Martinez always does wonderful work), which accompanies the &quot;cold&quot; feel of space with a sense of something hopeful.  This is a filmlover's film, a romance for sci-fi buffs (theres more implied skin than ship here), and has a &quot;watch late at night&quot; feel.

The planet seems to have cognizance and is sending 3-D visitors to the space station. Unlike the rest of the crew members, George Clooney's character 'likes' his visitor and after killing her a couple of times, regrets it, and wants her to stay.I'll leave the ending up to you to interpret.

753156,ACVNA57PI4DLV,B00009ATIX,Francois Tremblay,"[0, 3]","There are spoilers in this review. This is kindof necessary, I'm afraid, as many of this movie's flaws are there. If for some reason you want to see it, don't read this.I feel very strongly about Solyaris, Tarkovsky's version made in 1972. I consider it as the best movie I've ever seen. But I went into Solaris with an open mind. Unfortunately, Solaris is definitively an inferior and dumbed-down remake of Solyaris, despite claims to the contrary. The first half of Solaris is basically a fast-forward reworking of the first half of Solyaris. The second half is basically a composite of flashbacks and the new, grating plot that comes to the fore.There are things that work but they are not part of any coherent context. For example, the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya (Hari in the original) is much more fleshed out. These scenes are real winners, but only highlight one of the main problems of this remake : it is trying to force a love story where none is possible. The whole plot of Kelvin and Rheya/Hari is predicated on the premise that Kelvin does *not* love her, or at least that their relationship is doomed. Otherwise, there would be no point in having Solaris invoke her as a source of guilt for Kelvin in the first place ! That Kelvin and Rheya have such a great relationship, only marred by one clash (due to Rheya's extreme stupidity - I will mention this later), only makes the premise even less likely.The scene with a dream of Gibarian has perhaps the best original dialogue, but is nonsensical and relates to absolutely nothing. There are nice special effects of the station, the docking sequence, and Solaris itself. While I still think the original Solaris visual is better, the docking sequence is very good, and one thing the original lacked. But once again, they amount to very little and relate to very little.The blatant racism. Oh dear. I'm sure that organo-centric people will disagree with me, but I consider this version extremely racist and offensive. I know that in Solyaris, Sartorius is also racist, in that he considers the Solaristic constructs as beings to be studied and nothing more. But at least he has a reason : he considers the Solaristic constructs as objects of scientific study, and to do so has decided to ignore their sentience.Gordon (Sartorius' replacement in this version), on the other hand, has no such motive. She is Pure Evil (tm), the kind of foaming-at-the-mouth racist you only see in movies, and only desires to affirm the superiority of man over the ""inferior"" constructs (indeed, she says as much, which is very disturbing) and leave the station. But she is also a black woman, so I suppose all this must be forgotten. After all, minorities cannot be racist nazis. Right ?Well, never mind. Even the director and producer are openly racist. As James Cameron says in the commentary, ""when a girl is cute, whether she's made of subatomic particles or whatever, we still want to **** her"", and that the acceptance of the woman by Kelvin is ""a male thing"". In the surprise ending, where we learn Snow is also a Solaristic construct, the two others look at him in disgust, and desire to kill him.There is also the whole thing about Rheya/Hari. In Solyaris, we are not *told* that Hari is intelligent, we *see* it, and we also see her humanization process. ""Show, not tell"". Rheya in Solaris is *told* to us to be intelligent, but we don't *see* it, and she does not evolve at all. In fact, she is shown to be rather stupid in all instances. She is shown as a theist arguing against evolution, a pregnant woman who gets an abortion because her husband is an atheist (thru the kind of twisted and simplistic reasoning that only a fundamentalist Christian would invoke), and as a floozy who is barely aware of her own existence, basically worshipping the memories she was created from.The ending is atrocious, creating gratuitous tension instead of exploring Snow's character, losing all surprise and gaining not only a standard Hollywood good ending but also a blatant religious symbolism. At the end, Snow announces that the weapon they have used to destroy the constructs has spent all the station's power, and that Solaris is expanding exponentially. This creates tension as Kelvin and Gordon escape, but the former changes his mind. So we know where he will end up. No suspense. And the end that seems to equate Solaris with God is, I'm afraid, completely confirmed by the director, in the commentary. Ironically, a story which is partly about how humans try futilely to reduce everything to themselves, spawned a movie which reduces the unknown to human myths.Solaris keeps a relatively slow pacing (compared to Hollywood fare), but it has no brain. It tries to make Lem's story into a love story, when that is a contradiction. Lem's story is the antithesis of a love story. Adding the ideological stupidity of the movie, these are really, really bad cards that even Clooney's great acting, Jeremy Davies' highly enjoyable acting, and the great visuals cannot help. Sure, it's superior to standard Hollywood fare, and has a number of great scenes, but this is a total intellectual dead end.Kelvin : ""What does Solaris want from us ?""Gibarian : ""Why do you think

753157,A2UBS120XE605X,B00009ATIX,Frank Paris,"[5, 7]","This movie truly astonished me and I just don't get all the negative reviews. I've even seen serious critics complain that it didn't develop the relationship between the two principle characters enough. So what? That's like saying that Fargo is flawed because it never explained why Jerry Lundegaard was in such financial difficulties. That misses the point entirely.My 25 year old son warned me against seeing this. But I think his problem was that he was looking for a space opera like Star Wars or Star Trek Strikes Again. This is not a space action adventure, although it IS visually stunning and the music is glorious, I don't care if it is derivative (I would say the music is more an homage to 2001 than an imitation). So instead of an action adventure where special effects are an end in itself, this movie presents some really intruiging ideas about an alien life force (not life form, except in the guise of mystical looking, whispy clouds shrouding the planet Solaris) that seems desperately to want to ""fix things up"" when individuals from an intelligence species like homo sapiens misunderstand each other resulting in tragic consequences. The logical conclusion of this ""procedure"" just blew me away as portrayed in the last fifteen minutes of this movie, which I will not reveal as it should come as a total surprise to the viewer, although in hindsight there were hints enough that it could come to this, and then you have to wonder about the validity of human self-identity and the relativity of our own individuality. You will also be wondering about the ""morality"" of this kind of redemption. Is it good, or is it bad? I really have to wonder, which is why I look forward to viewing the movie again and again when it comes out on DVD.As you can perhaps see from my review, what is really going on in this movie is actually philosophically rather abstract, and so the many criticisms of this movie on concrete points are really irrelevant. This will probably be a box office flop because it will take too long for the good things about it to get around, and the movie industry has little patience when a movie doesn't immediately start dragging in tens of millions the first week. But I predict it will become a cult hit on DVD, as people buy it and watch it ten times or more just to go through the experience of contemplating all the cosmic and philosophical issues the movie raises.I might add that I never read the book and did not see the original movie. This movie stands on its own and I am sad to see that the original movie ruined the experience of this movie for so many others. I remember how disappointed I was seeing the movie ""Tom Jones"" when it first came out because, as happenstance would have it, I'd just read the book. I saw the movie twenty years later and realized then that it is a masterpiece. I've since become very skeptical about people criticizing a movie simply because it wasn't like the original or betrayed the book.

753159,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B00009ATIX,Gary,"[7, 28]","If there's one film I thought would never be re-made by Hollywood then it's Solaris. You can't say their Philistines, can you? Here's the lowdown for curious fans of Tarkovsky's original. Soderbergh's naff version replaces Hari with a Sloan-ranger. Brit readers think Tara P-T in 'Celebrity get me out of here'. McElhone, poor lass, is hopeless. Being an American production there has to be a murder mystery included (Philistines!) I half expected Columbo to pop his head around the door only to be tapped on the shoulder by another Columbo saying ""oh, and one more thing."" Or maybe two. Half way through, Basil exposition drops in shrouded in darkness to fill Americans in on plot details they may be missing. You know, give 'em a prod. There's a conjuring trick or two and finally, a fortune cookie ending. Mix in what suspiciously sounds like David Bowie's Subterraneans and Bob's your uncle. Well, only if he's dead. It's mystifying why Soderbergh should want to remake this. No takers for Citizen Kane or Battleship Potemkin, right? Those who think Tarkovsky's film is 'perfect' won't need it. Those in that group who are curiosity killed the catters but are worried that the new version may intrude upon their thoughts while watching the Tarkovsky should probably steer well clear of this atrocity. I didn't, but I'll live.Special features: Well, you get a lot of thumping techno music and speeded up camera in the 'Behind The Scenes' specials that is risibly at odds with the subject matter.

I cursed, I threw things, I went into a rage because they were remaking (don't give me that ""reimagining"" crap) one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, and were remaking a Tarkovsky film (!).  Remaking a Tarkovsky film?!?!?!?  Absolutely sacrelige.  Next, they will be ""reimagining"" the Sistine Chapel.  I saw about half of this film, and I had to shut it off to prevent myself from doing bodily harm to myself and the TV.  How many times did the sod (a British slur term in which I will refer to Soderbergh as for the rest of this review) watch 2001 and Solaris before making this?  The cover box on the DVD is a blatant ripoff of the famous picture/poster of Dave Bowman in his spacesuit with the blinking lights on it.  There are shots that look just like HAL 9000's eye in 2001 (except the eye is bigger.  Wow, what an amazing idea, Sod!  Make it bigger!).  The dialogue is on the level on a high school drama.  Clooney (who is a good actor) is too straightforward and is not haunted enough.  He just looks old here, not necessarily sad, which is the way he should look.  Nastasha McElhone reads her lines without any emotion at all.  The rest of the crew (especially Jeremy Davies turn as the ""stoned"" guy) are a bad joke.  In Tarkovsky's original film, every member of the cast had dignity, and the film was really profound and mysterious, a true epic sci-fi film worthy of comparisons to 2001.  Here, it's dumbed down.  It takes the guise of an ""important"" film, but it isn't.  It's just a remake, and a bad one at that.  Sod has a rep for being an artistic filmmaker, but a lot of his films are remakes of much better foreign films (Traffic is a remake of a far superior British miniseries, for example).  He is very overrated.  He said this was his most ambitious film.  Ambition doesn't mean copying Kubrick and Tarkovsky, sod.  Avoid this.  Stanislaw Lem, the author of the original novel, didn't like either version, but he acknowledged that Tarkovsky had a vision at least.  He said the sod was a hack, and he's right.

I put it on, knowing something of the story from the Russian film.I was mezmerized.  This movie - which Soderberg has wanted to direct his whole life - is one of the most daring and cerebral pieces of cinema ever to come out of Hollywood.  It doesn't surprise me that many people don't get it, given the fact they have been numbed by typical movie fare.The writing is spare - you are given just enough to pull you through.  You are never told exactly what's going on - you have to figure it out for yourself.  But there are plently of clues, if you look for them.These clues are not in the dialog (though you could find some there).  They are in the photography, set design, acting, score, and especially the editing.The structure and editing of this film is very unconventional.  Soderberg mixes the past, present, and future in a poetic fashion - the story is not so much about Cloony's character, nor is it about the &quot;planet&quot;.  It's about how every point in our lives touches every other point, past, present, and future.There were moments when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, mostly due to Soderberg's brilliant and daring filmmaking.

Remove the Lem name from the credits, remove the ""Solaris"" title and in-film references, and what you have left is an anonymous and tepid piece of trash with no such supports under which to masquerade, sans any significant special effects, science fictional elements, alien representations, or indeed any elements of interest whatsoever.Solaris, perhaps one of the more profound science fiction novels of the 20th century and written by a world renowned author, is reduced in this film to a pathetic, unimaginative, heavy-handed, politically correct, poorly cast, cheap hack job, by a director who obviously has no comprehension whatever of what the original novel was attempting to portray.  A proper presentation of the novel could have produced a genuinely great and adult science fiction film (what a rarity!) of great power, re-enforced by the spectacular special effects that could have been achieved today, challenging the adult viewer with what it means to be human, and what it could be like to encounter an incomprehensibly alien intelligence.Nor could this director have had any comprehension of what the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky, tried to accomplish:  Operating under a repressive Soviet regime, and lacking today's routine film technology, he yet skillfully blended metaphor, a superb cast, being true to some of the book's intricate details, and the best effects he could hope to produce, to create a film which, while it lacked a lot of the science fictional elements one would have liked to see, nevertheless remained basically faithful to the original concept, and allowed lovers of the original novel to at least be able to experience some of its' aspects in film form.  Instead, what we get, in addition to the above deficiencies, is some rehashed metaphor from the Tarkovsky film, whose only original intent had to be as a poor but necessary substitute for the concepts in the book which were beyond then-current technology to produce!My advice is:  SKIP THIS FILM!  If you are not familiar with Stanislaw Lem's work and would like to sample this great author, buy the book with the money you save and read it!  Then, if you can afford it and have a sufficiently high regard of the book, buy the Criterion DVD offering of the original Andrei Tarkovsky film, just released in a newly re-mastered version, out this past month.",1,Planet?

I'm willing to give him a chance on the less commercial films like The Limey, Solaris, or Full Frontal.  While the trailer suggested that this movie was pretty much just George Clooney in space and something about a dead wife, I trusted the Steven Soderberg name and rented the movie.That was a mistake.  I like science fiction, and I don't require massive explosions or special effects.  I expected Solaris to be a slow moving science fiction film, I just didn't expect it to be quite this dull and boring.  The premise of the movie is that there is a space station near the planet Solaris doing research on the planet to see if there is any commercial benefit to Earth.  However, there has been no communication with that space station and Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), a psychiatrist, is sent to convince the crew to return.  He finds some dead bodies as well as two freaked out crew members.  During the nighttime, Chris wakes up to find his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) in his cabin.  The movie deals with Chris still attached to his wife and Rheya trying to remember/figure out if she is, in fact, the real Rheya.This is a slow moving movie, and I must emphasize how slow the movie is paced.  The plot did not reveal anything about the planet Solaris or the import of what was happening, so I wasn't able to sustain interest in what was going on.  I didn't see that Soderberg was hinting at something larger, but rather that the movie was empty of an actual story that made any sort of sense.  Okay, so Solaris (the planet) is somehow affecting things and creating the deepest desires (??) of the crew, but is it?  How?  For what purpose?  All things that I would expect would be explored to actually tell the story were ignored.  Even expecting a slow paced film, I was let down.

But once I saw him in Solaris, I must admit, I gained a fair amount of respect for his commitment to conveying heavy themes.The movie itself has been criticized for being too slow and dull, and to a certain degree, the second complaint is legitimate.  If the director had made less use of visual symbolism, it probably would have been slightly less tedius to watch.  However, this criticism is partially mitigated by the excellent story and the truly deep questions that the film asks.  How would you react if you were confronted with a long lost loved one?  What would you do if you had an opportunity to correct a traumatic past mistake?  Solaris asks both of these questions, while doing so in a very unassuming way, forcing the audience members to answer them for themselves.  However, this alone is not what makes Solaris so relevant.The truly valuable aspect of the film is its investigation of the thought processes associated with obsession, using extraordinary circumstances to illustrate that not all problems have solutions and resultantly, sometimes our greatest adversary can be our personal need to rationalize our unique human experiences.Solaris is a slow movie, and its ambitious artsiness can become tiresome.

Indeed, this latest release resonates with me more and more as I dwell upon it.Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychiatrist going through the daily motions. Then, he receives a video message from his friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) beseeching his help out on the space research station circling the planet Solaris. Gibarian doesn't specify the problem, but two astronauts have already perished.On his arrival at Solaris, Kelvin discovers that Gibarian has since committed suicide. Only the station's commander, Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), and Snow (Jeremy Davies) remain alive. Gordon is locked in her cabin, reluctant to come out. Snow seems in a world of his own, curiously semi-detached from reality.Chris is soon confronted with the presence of Visitors, physical manifestations created by the planet Solaris of humans residing within the memories of the space station crew. For example, there's the young ""son"" of Gibarian, and the ""brother"" of Snow. We never learn who Gordon's Visitor is.Kelvin awakens one day to his own Visitor, his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who'd previously committed suicide back on Earth after an acrimonious verbal confrontation with her spouse. Chris, who loved her dearly, has been weighed down with her loss.The power of the SOLARIS story lies in the concept of a life form created from the another's psyche. As Rheya puts it to Chris, her existence and essence is solely dependent on his memory of her. The viewer watches as Rheya mentally discovers who she is via Kelvin's memories, fed to her (and the viewer) in flashback form by, presumably, the planet's intelligence. Poignantly, Rheya - a tragic figure - is profoundly saddened that all she'll ever be is determined by Kelvin's recollections, that she'll never know the rest of herself. Chris, on the other hand, mired in the twin emotions of guilt and love, clings to his resurrected ""wife"". As he admits to her, ""I don't know anymore if you're truly Rheya; I only see you.""The 2002 version of this film is, mercifully, 70 minutes shorter than the 169-minute 1972 edition, which dragged on interminably. Plus, the planetary special FX are better, and the interior of the space station doesn't look like something clunky out of the Soviet 50s. Clooney, who delivers one of his best performances, benefits from being familiar to American audiences, something Donatas Banionis in the earlier Russian release wasn't. McElhone, a relatively unknown actress, has a stunning, mature beauty worthy of any man's obsession. Davis is powerful as Dr. Gordon, a realist who knows what must be done if the station's survivors are to live.

Much shorter than the Russian filmed version, both based on the Stanislaw Lew movel, Solaris is a overlooked gem of a movie that ruthlessly explores the problem that arises. The solution at the end is the only one possible, a transcendental one, but I can't see how any other works for this movie.I expressed a theory to a co-worker that George Clooney movies where he *doesn't* play the ""rogue with a heart of gold"" character he is famous for (Out of Sight, Three Kings, O Brother, The Billy Ocean movies, etc) don't seem to do well at the box office, no matter how well the movies are made. Solaris, which only took in $15 million at the US Box office in 2002 (after costing 4 times that to make) seems to fit this mold.Besides the wonderful acting from Clooney, McElhrone, Davis and Davies, the soundtrack also makes this movie a complete experience. I wish I had picked up the soundtrack the day I saw this in theaters, it is now out of print and expensive to obtain.And what would *you* do if someone you lost came back to you, someone who was torn away from you?I know there are those who prefer the Russian version of the film, but, honestly, I find that one slow and tedious.

That being said, for those who are looking for a deep movie that questions the human condition, reality, religion, and desire... this would be it.This movie about a psychologist, Kris Kelvin (played by George Clooney) whose friend asks him to journey up to a space station that is orbiting a planet, Solaris, due to some psychological problems the crew is having.  Upon his arrival, Kelvin finds his friend dead and the two remaining crew members as having major psychological issues (e.g. freaking out).  The planet is not just a hunk of matter floating through space.  Solaris not only interacts with them it can physically manifest a person's innermost desires.  The climax of the film has Kelvin choosing between the reality that he knows and the fantasy of Solaris-his conclusion is surprising and also very revealing.This movie is philosophical and really interesting.  I liked Steven Soderberg's direction of the actors in this movie... like all of his movies, the characters in the film are incredibly intense.

753183,A2TKMQVK96YZ10,B00009ATIX,"Kelcony ""katk303""","[2, 7]","Reasons I didn't like this movie:1. It contained about ten thousand confusing dream/memory/reality sequences. It seemed to me that the director made the film and was watching it and decided it was boring, so he put in a whole lot of short face shots to make it boring and confusing (which of course is a whole lot better than just boring). Anyway, it was nearly impossible to tell what was real and what was not, and instead of providing the viewer with a thoughtful sense of surreality, depth, isolation, and insight, it simply left the viewer dazed and confused.2. There was far too little dialogue, and far too much whirring, crackling, disjointed music, and that sound that comes with being pulled into the gravity field of a planet. This of course was combined with the confusing visuals.3. The acting--what little acting there was; George Clooney was the main character, but mostly we saw unmoving and asleep or a shot of the back of his head. (Anyway the whole movie was too dark to see him anyway but I'll get to that later.)The little dialogue he had was adequately given but did not make up for anything. The supporting characters were mediocre EXCEPT for one guy whose name I couldn't catch, due to the inarticulate speech of his fellow characters. He played his part exceptionally, keeping to character and using incredibly expressive gestures.4. The movie was dark--it was hard to see faces and expressions, which is what the entire movie was comprised of.5. Solaris. They kept showing it, with its little electric currents, and at one point an unnamed man said it seemed to be responding to their observations--only unfortunately, no pattern could be detected in the movements of the pink and purple gases. Sorry-I missed something here? And at then end, it kept getting smaller, until it sort of looked like a doorknob, I guess, which was sort of significant, but there was no connection-there was the blue wire and the red wire, and they were telling us as the viewer to put them together.7. It was hard to detect any sort of plot, theme, meaning, or point in this movie. I know many people would argue otherwise and some would say I'm just too stupid and shallow to see it, but while I admit that I may not be the deepest thinker, I really did try to find a meaning and couldn't. I think it may have been because of all the defects above befuddled whatever point it may have originally had. Or maybe it never had one in the first place. Its based on a book--maybe it was one of those books where the author had an inkling of higher thinking, of deeper thoughts, but couldn't quite grasp the concepts and so retreated into vagueness.That's it--those are the reasons I didn't like Solaris. If you bothered to read the whole thing, I hope you understand my point of view. (If of course you simply read the first line and then scrolled down to say that my review wasn't helpful, well, I hope that you feel tremendous shame.) If I can get one person to save their money--and hopefully end up donating it to charity--by not buying Solaris, my job is done.

It moves a little slow (the director of the film is the guy who directed Oceans 11 but he was trying to impress the artsy crowd with Solaris) at times.  But it is about, in the future, a psychiatrist whose wife committed suicide, being asked to go to a space station that is circling this wierd planet named Solaris.  Seems everyone on the station has been going bonkers.  When he gets there he finds that for everyone there, the planet reaches into their memories and brings someone to them that they have an unresolved issue with.  His wife comes back to him.  But here is the trick: his wife is constructed from his memories about her, and that is the cool thing about the whole film.  See, when we meet people, especially when we have relationships with them, we think about them and remember them in ways that are not actually correct with who they are.  So since his wife acted a little wierd, he remembers her as a 'crazy person' and never really got to know her.  His 'new' version of his wife is incomplete in her head; she is only his idea of her, which is as a sad, incomplete person.  In flashbacks the movie shows that he has missed the idea on her; she actually was quite stronger than him at times.  But of course their relationship could not go on because he NEVER really got to know who she was (as he says in the film, in a beautiful line, ""I was haunted by the idea that I had remembered her wrong."").

753192,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B00009ATIX,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[5, 18]","&quot;Solaris&quot; is a conceptually idealistic love story couched in a Science Fiction film that is highly reminiscent of Sc-Fi films and novels in the fifties and sixties.  That being said, it does accomplish that to a certain degree but the overall outcome of the film is a less than spectacular film that leaves one looking at their watch as the DVD plays on.One of the most surprising aspects of this film is that one of its primary producers is James Cameron himself.  Typically, if his name is stamped on a project it is destined for success but that unfortunately doesn't happen here.  Perhaps had he taken the director's chair for this film it might've been a touch better.Performance wise, all of the actors involved did a good job with their respective roles, the script not withstanding.  To date, I would have to say that George Clooney's departure from the small screen to big screen has been a more or less lesson in hit and miss, with this film scoring as a miss.Director Steve Soderbergh, best known for films such as &quot;Erin Brokovich&quot; and &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; more or less stepped outside of his comfort zone with this film and the seeming end result of his traveling in the Science Fiction lane leaves one to the conclusion that he probably won't travel in it again.The Premise:George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin who is a company psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an extremely mysterious planet.  He's sent there after the crew stops responding to hails from the company and one of those crew members sends a message specifically asking for him.  Upon his arrival he finds that some of the crew is dead and he too starts experiencing the same problems that everyone else had.  A few years prior, his wife had died and now, in the middle of his first night on the station she shows up in his room with him...What follows from there is a story that is quite different in and of its self where the primary characters are trying to cope with these mysterious characters from their pasts showing up.Overall, I'd recommend this film primarily as a rental to most movie watchers.  Of no doubt is that there are some out there who would find an appreciation for this films approach unfortunately, I'm not one of them.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Full length audio commentary by Director Steven Soderbergh and Producer James Cameron-HBO &quot;Making Of&quot; Special-&quot;Solaris:  Behind the Planet&quot; Featurette-Original Screenplay-Theatrical Teaser and Trailer",2,Solaris - A relatively disappointing Sci-Fi flick!,1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,2507,"['quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'conceptually', 'idealistic', 'love', 'story', 'couched', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'film', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'Sc-Fi', 'films', 'novels', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'being', 'said', 'accomplish', 'certain', 'degree', 'overall', 'outcome', 'film', 'less', 'spectacular', 'film', 'one', 'looking', 'watch', 'DVD', 'on.One', 'most', 'surprising', 'aspects', 'film', 'one', 'primary', 'producers', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Typically', 'name', 'stamped', 'project', 'destined', 'success', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'taken', 'director', 'chair', 'film', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touch', 'better.Performance', 'wise', 'actors', 'involved', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'script', 'not', 'withstanding', 'date', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'George', 'Clooney', 'departure', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'lesson', 'hit', 'miss', 'film', 'scoring', 'miss.Director', 'Steve', 'Soderbergh', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Erin', 'Brokovich', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'quot', 'more', 'less', 'stepped', 'comfort', 'zone', 'film', 'seeming', 'end', 'result', 'traveling', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'lane', 'one', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'travel', 'again.The', 'Premise', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'who', 'company', 'psychologist', 'sent', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'extremely', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'sent', 'there', 'crew', 'responding', 'hails', 'company', 'one', 'crew', 'members', 'message', 'specifically', 'asking', 'arrival', 'crew', 'dead', 'too', 'experiencing', 'same', 'problems', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'prior', 'wife', 'had', 'died', 'now', 'middle', 'first', 'night', 'station', 'up', 'room', 'What', 'story', 'quite', 'different', 'self', 'where', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'cope', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'pasts', 'showing', 'up.Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'primarily', 'rental', 'most', 'movie', 'watchers', 'doubt', 'are', 'who', 'would', 'find', 'appreciation', 'films', 'approach', 'unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Full', 'length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Producer', 'James', 'Cameron-HBO', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'Special-', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'Planet', 'quot', 'Featurette-Original', 'Screenplay-Theatrical', 'Teaser', 'Trailer']",Solaris

753194,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00009ATIX,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","Director Steven Soderbergh insists that &quot;Solairs&quot; is another film based on the science fiction novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Lem and not yet another remake of a European film, in this case the 1972 film version of &quot;Solaris&quot; by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky.  There is admittedly some truth in this idea since the premises are the same but the focal point of the story and the approach rather different.  Both films share the same flaw in an overwhelming sense of solemnity that becomes oppressive at times, but the premise is so intriguing and the lesson so true to the human condition that such a concern becomes relatively minor.&quot;Solaris&quot; is the name of a planet around which a space station is orbiting.  When two astronauts die the survivors send back frantic messages that have mission control worried about their sanity.  So they send psychiatrist Chris Kevlin (George Clooney) to the space station above Solaris and the first night there he wakes up to find his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone) in bed with him.  The catch is that not only did she not come on the trip with him, she had committed suicide on Earth some time before.  Thus both Kelvin and the audience learn the secret of Solaris, a planet that can read the minds of the humans orbiting above and send them people that they have lost in their lives.  Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis) points out the obvious to Kelvin, namely that his &quot;wife&quot; is not human.  But confronted with a being that not only is made of flesh and blood but shares his memories, Kelvin cannot help feeling he has been given a second change.  There is another survivor on the space station, Snow (Jeremy Davies), who apparently has had a close encounter of the worst kind with whatever person from his past the planet sent up.This is a science fiction film where the key elements are not the fantastic planet and the advanced technology but the psychology of the human beings confronted with personal trauma materialized in human form.  The key conflict is between Gordon, who is constantly questioning what Solaris wants and assumes it has to be something bad, and Kelvin, who wants to talk to his dead wife.  While Gordon spins more fanciful visions of the end game of this bizarre scenario, Kelvin comes to terms with this particular Rheya.  She might have been created by Solaris, but she seems to have free will.  However, eventually Kelvin learns the dark true about Rheya.This is not to suggest that Solaris is a malignant planet, but that the gift it has given to Kelvin has inherent limitations.  The lesson is that the limitations come from Kelvin himself and are peculiar to the human condition.  The maxim that comes to mind is that you are not who you think you are or who your friends think you are; you are who you think your friends think you are.  I have been teaching that in Interpersonal Communication classes for years.  However, I have never seen the principle manifested as dramatically as it is in &quot;Solaris.&quot;In many ways &quot;Solaris&quot; is a love story, which is fairly rare in science fiction films (diverse examples come to mind such as &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;My Stepmother is an Alien&quot;), but even as such it is a strongly introspective one.  Kelvin might be responding to his idea of his wife rather than to the actual being, but that is all we poor mortals get to do in the first place.  Clooney's performance is appropriately minimalistic.  His character might be dealing with profound emotions, but he does not get overly emotional, even as his rationality is buffeted by this strange confrontation with a replicant of his wife.Soderbergh's version of &quot;Solaris&quot; is not quite as slow, not to mention not quite as confusing as Tarkovsky's original (which has also been released on DVD as part of the Criterion Collection).  Kevlin and Gordon are able to crystalize the situation throughout their arguments.  Still, even though the point is more clearly made in this 2002 film, there is an inherent power to the original that should be enjoyed.",4,Soderbergh's thoughtful version of Lem's classic SF novel,1060473600,"08 10, 2003",2003,4098,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'quot', 'Solairs', 'quot', 'film', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'Polish', 'author', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'not', 'yet', 'remake', 'European', 'film', 'case', '1972', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'Russian', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'admittedly', 'truth', 'idea', 'premises', 'are', 'same', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'approach', 'rather', 'different', 'films', 'share', 'same', 'flaw', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'solemnity', 'oppressive', 'times', 'premise', 'so', 'intriguing', 'lesson', 'so', 'true', 'human', 'condition', 'concern', 'relatively', 'minor.', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'name', 'planet', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'When', 'two', 'astronauts', 'die', 'survivors', 'send', 'back', 'frantic', 'messages', 'have', 'mission', 'control', 'worried', 'sanity', 'send', 'psychiatrist', 'Chris', 'Kevlin', 'George', 'Clooney', 'space', 'station', 'Solaris', 'first', 'night', 'there', 'up', 'find', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'bed', 'catch', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'trip', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Earth', 'time', 'Thus', 'Kelvin', 'audience', 'learn', 'secret', 'Solaris', 'planet', 'can', 'read', 'minds', 'humans', 'orbiting', 'send', 'people', 'have', 'lost', 'lives', 'Dr.', 'Helen', 'Gordon', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'out', 'obvious', 'Kelvin', 'namely', 'quot', 'wife', 'quot', 'not', 'human', 'confronted', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'flesh', 'blood', 'shares', 'memories', 'Kelvin', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'been', 'given', 'second', 'change', 'survivor', 'space', 'station', 'Snow', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'close', 'encounter', 'worst', 'kind', 'person', 'planet', 'sent', 'up.This', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'where', 'key', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'fantastic', 'planet', 'advanced', 'technology', 'psychology', 'human', 'beings', 'confronted', 'personal', 'trauma', 'materialized', 'human', 'form', 'key', 'conflict', 'Gordon', 'who', 'constantly', 'questioning', 'what', 'Solaris', 'be', 'something', 'bad', 'Kelvin', 'who', 'talk', 'dead', 'wife', 'Gordon', 'more', 'fanciful', 'visions', 'end', 'game', 'bizarre', 'scenario', 'Kelvin', 'terms', 'particular', 'Rheya', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'Solaris', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'However', 'eventually', 'Kelvin', 'dark', 'true', 'Rheya.This', 'not', 'suggest', 'Solaris', 'malignant', 'planet', 'gift', 'given', 'Kelvin', 'inherent', 'limitations', 'lesson', 'limitations', 'come', 'Kelvin', 'are', 'peculiar', 'human', 'condition', 'maxim', 'mind', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'who', 'friends', 'think', 'are', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'friends', 'think', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'teaching', 'Interpersonal', 'Communication', 'years', 'However', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'principle', 'manifested', 'as', 'dramatically', 'quot', 'Solaris.', 'quot', 'many', 'ways', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'love', 'story', 'fairly', 'rare', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'diverse', 'come', 'mind', 'such', 'quot', 'E.T.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Stepmother', 'Alien', 'quot', 'even', 'such', 'strongly', 'introspective', 'one', 'Kelvin', 'might', 'be', 'responding', 'idea', 'wife', 'rather', 'actual', 'being', 'poor', 'mortals', 'get', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'appropriately', 'minimalistic', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'dealing', 'profound', 'emotions', 'not', 'get', 'overly', 'emotional', 'even', 'rationality', 'buffeted', 'strange', 'confrontation', 'replicant', 'wife.Soderbergh', 'version', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'not', 'quite', 'slow', 'not', 'mention', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'confusing', 'Tarkovsky', 'original', 'also', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'part', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Kevlin', 'Gordon', 'are', 'able', 'crystalize', 'situation', 'arguments', 'Still', 'even', 'point', 'more', 'clearly', 'made', '2002', 'film', 'inherent', 'power', 'original', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed']",Solaris

753196,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,B00009ATIX,Lionheart,"[1, 1]","A beautiful movie. I loved it from first frame to last. No, it does not really compare to the original, which is more about the strange situation, which is ultimately unresolved. This one is more of a character piece, very emotional. And although I have never been a big fan of George, he is great here. In my opinion, he's better in a dramatic role like this.At any rate, he plays a psychologist who is asked by a friend to investigate the very strange happenings aboard a spaceship orbiting a planet called ""Solaris."" It appears as though the captain of the vessel has gone mad. Different from the original story, but not substantially so.Upon arriving, George's character finds the crew either noticeably disturbed (as in the case of the very creepy Jeremy Davies), or just dead, as in the case of the unfortunate captain. One of the crew refuses to allow him to enter her quarters, obviously hiding something, and he finds bloods streaks and trails.When Clooney's character finally succumbs to sleep, he discovers the reason for their apparent madness -- somehow, in this place, dreams become a kind of reality, and the obsessions of the crew somehow become physical entities. George's character, for example, dreams of his dead fiance, and there she is, apparently alive and well.The crux of the story involves the nature of these beings. Are they real? duplicates of the originals? ghosts? Or just tricks Solaris is playing in a kind of attempt to communicate? And ultimately, as far as George's character is concerned, does it really matter? He seems to have a second chance at the girl of his dreams. So what will he do with it?One of the most striking scenes in the movie is when Clooney's character, still rational, abandons the first version of his dreamgirl to the vastness of outer space. Does she really float out there indescribably lonely until death, or only until she is far enough away from Solaris for the mysterious link to be severed? We never find out, but it's a very powerful scene. I loved it.Meanwhile, Jeremy Davies is at his best, playing the nutbag to perfection. Impossible to not get a little creeped out by his performance.Overall, I have to say that while the original Solaris was pretty much forgettable,  this newer version is anything but. It understands what works best about the original concept and builds on it -- mostly due to the director, I bet. Anyway, I loved it.

Solaris centers upon the doomed love affair between Chris and his late wife Rheya ... who mysteriously comes back to life in flesh and blood form, some kind of creation of the plant Solaris. It is as if the planet can drive a person mad by reaching within their memory and retrieving lost nostalgia of unfinished business.

753200,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00009ATIX,magellan,"[0, 2]","I just had a brief comment to make about this movie, which was a remake of the Russian director Tarkovsky original from the late 60's.Having seen the original movie 30 years ago, but being too young to really appreciate it perhaps, although I was already a fan of Lem's, I was curious to see how this one would turn out with Soderberg direction in charge, since I usually like Soderberg's movies.I overall enjoyed this flick, although the movie's slow pacing, psychological, and metaphysical themes probably won't appeal to a wide audience. The story raises fundamental issues on these subjects, but the movie offers no answers--as one of the characters says, ""There are no answers--only choices."" The most basic question of where the human copies are coming from is never solved in the movie, although Solaris must in some way be responsible.In the novel it was hinted at that Solaris housed a powerful, planetary intelligence that was trying to communicate with humans, but didn't really know how. The fact that this intelligence was seemingly omnipotent and able to manipulate matter at will, but wasn't omniscient, is the most interesting idea in the movie and the book. This all-powerful but not all-knowing intelligence can therefore make mistakes--sometimes with tragic consequences for the humans on the space station.The sets are spectacular, and the haunting soundtrack really adds to the movie's overall ambience. I think Clooney and McElhone did a creditable job in their roles. Overall, a good remake of the original.

The Andrei Tarkovsky 1972 original was a good film (albeit waaaaay too long), so it begs the question: Why a remake? Not to bash George Clooney, but this film was entirely mis-cast. The performances were dry and hollow, and all the actors in this film are capable of much better.Tarkovsky's film has more than just a passing resemblance to ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", and I believe it to be the Soviet equivalent. The ending, a touching twist on the nature of the alien entity, was all but absent in this version. Some previous reviewers remarked on how boring this film was. I have to agree. The Tarkovsky original is long-winded, but easy to follow. This remake has no substance, though it does attempt to put you on the Space Station, all you feel like doing is setting the alarm clock and have a snooze.For those contemplating watching this film (maybe because of George Clooney, C'mon, admit it), I recommend seeing the Tarkovsky original.

A security force is sent to investigate but disappears - unfortunately we never find out where they disappeared to or even if they came to harm.  George Cloony plays Chris Kelvin, a civilian psychologist on earth. He is approached and asked to go to the space station to investigate what is happening with the crew and, since one of the crew members is a close friend of his, they think he may be able to assist the crew from a psychological standpoint and save the mission. Okay, so you can see we're already on pretty shaky ground here. Civilian with no training and trips to outer space don't mix well.Anyway, When he arrives on the ship there are just two crew members left. His friend has already committed suicide by the time he gets there and there is no mention of anyone else or anything else regarding what may have happened to other people. Anyway, the two remaining crew members don't appear in the movie much after the initial opening. The remainder of the movie is focused on his relationship with his dead wife who mysteriously appears on the ship in his locked room. That's just the opening, and it doesn't get much better.There are lots of scenes where they just stare at each other without speaking.

753204,A24BUT5LD6FNQ6,B00009ATIX,Matthew Wall,"[136, 145]","This review refers to the DVD release of Solaris, the remake. Just a couple of notes from the outset:(1) This film will not be well-liked by most people. There are a ton of spoilers in most reviews, so I'll try to boil it down for its essence to avoid ruining the unfolding of the movie should you choose to see it: a guy goes to a spaceship where weird things are happening and sees his dead wife. Maybe. That's all you need to know about the plot. The movie, some might think is slow, there's no action, it's a head-tripper, and honestly, had I not read the book before and also seen the magnificent Tarkovsky original, I might not have followed what was going on. As such, while I really enjoyed it, I can't call it either a great film nor one that is likely to appeal to a broad cross-section of movie watchers. There are some heady issues surrounding reality, consciousness, life and death, and if you take them too seriously you'll find yourself snoozing.It's definitely in Soderbergh's style, and it's been fun watching him skip between genres in recent years, but it's more like ""The Limey"" and less like ""Erin Brockovich"" if you want to pin it down. While it's not an indy flick -- in the sense it's expensive and bankrolled and produced in Hollywood fashion -- it feels like a small art film or an indy. And please, god, don't expect ""Aliens"" or ""Titanic"" because James Cameron's name is over the credits as Producer.(2) Both the original book and the Tarkovsky film have much to recommend them, although they also share characteristics of being verbally philosophical and talky which this version most assuredly does not. This version is incredibly tight.(3) If you're a film student or into the mechanics of film, though, this DVD edition is an utter delight. I can easily see this sequence in a film class curriculum: watch the movie; watch the DVD commentary; read the screenplay; watch the Tarkovsky ""original""; read the Lem original source book; write your term paper.The DVD contains two interesting but not unusual featurettes on the making of the film. It also includes, somewhat unusually, a complete original screenplay (that you have to page through with the fast forward button). And it contains the customary Director's commentary, featuring director Stephen Soderbergh and producer James Cameron bantering about the movie. (In the honest assessment of Sodbergh, the commentary is ""Just another version of two white guys sitting around talking."")The two of them discuss nearly every choice that was made in assembling the movie, from lighting and the use of post-production to CGI and whether to rehearse actors or not and dozens of technical tricks. And the movie itself is sort of like a catalog of techniques and effects. I don't mean to imply it's showing off: it simply uses a huge variety of film techniques to move the story along, and Cameron and Soderbergh discuss in the commentary both what works and what didn't work, what reshoots were required, what processes underlay the film, how the rewrites were done, and so forth --  and do it in a rather entertaining way, to this film fan, at least.And one of the things I enjoyed both about the film and the DVD is the way Soderbergh just endlessly pillages other directors and films: Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarkovsky himself, Eisenstein, heck, even the Lumiere brothers -- even a dash of James Cameron. As Cameron himself says at the end of the commentary, ""There are no new ideas. We're a hundred years into the process of filmmaking now.""As such, while I enjoyed watching the movie, I rather much more enjoyed immediately re-viewing it with the commentary, and I think this is going to be a keeper for those who like studying technical details. It's like ""Citizen Kane"" in that it comes close to summarizing what the 21st century film-maker has at his or her fingertips (the way ""Kane"" slopped together virtually every technique of 1941 -- rest assured I'm not actually comparing the film's stature to Kane.) There's a bit of what Soderberg immodestly calls ""pure cinema"", visual-only story-telling, which does remind me of ""The Limey"" and some of the silent classics as well as ""2001"" and the original ""Solaris"", and I mean that all in a complimentary sense.It's also a huge genre-bender. There are elements of slasher flicks, ghost stories, horror, detective mystery, romantic tragedies, a very slight dash of comedy (thanks largely to the great Jeremey Davies in a supporting role), Soviet agitprop, Godard nouvelle vague, 1930s theatre, and who knows what else I missed the first couple of times I saw it.This is not a flick you're going to want to pick out for Saturday night brain candy, or to change your mood if you're depressed, because it will either bore you or depress you more if you want mood-altering fluff. But it's a good one-timer for those who like the brain-bending what-is-reality film along the lines of Philip K.

753207,AIZIFDQJECYXZ,B00009ATIX,"""memdoc""","[15, 25]","&quot;Solaris,&quot; by Stanislaw Lem, holds a prominant place in the science fiction book catalogue.  It is a deeply moving story of one man's loss and his final confrontation with his inner demons.  It is also a treatise on the nature of how subconscious forces shape and mold ego and how memory and love shape our reality.  And, if that's not enough, it is also a story about the nature of God's relationship with man.  Obviously, translating this book onto the screen is a monumental task, not only because of the comlex themes, but also because of the fundamental lack of physical adventure.  All the action is psychological, if you will.  Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of this book was overall successful in relaying the comlexities of Lem's ideas, however, it is very slow-paced, long, and, consequently, requires effort on the part of the viewer to stay focused during the movie.  In the recent version of &quot;Solaris,&quot; Steven Soderberg, wants to avoid the length and intellectual challenge offered by Tarkovsky and ends up compromising the entire movie.  He assumes that a shorter screenplay and directorial bravado will lure the audience and peak viewer interest in the story.  Thus, he uses his signature editorial style of jump cuts, handheld shots, exquisite cinematography, and, cache actor, George clooney.  He also pared the story down to focus and explore the love story in more detail, leaving the more introspective philosophical themes hidden (perhaps, buried).  While the other themes of the book are there, you have to really tease them out.  The spiritual issues, for example, are abruptly and rather simplistically introduced in the dinner party scene, only to be abandoned in the remaining exposition.  Moreover, we are shown Mr. Clooney's derriere  gratuitously on two occasions, as if to infuse the movie with a dose of sensationalism lest the audience fall asleep.  While, the cinematography is very effective and the sound effects are invloving, the editing becomes tedious and distracts away from the story.  No doubt, this is a challenging project to bring to the big screen, let alone to popular cinema; however, I found the use of such trite pandering patronizing and somewhat insulting.  This story is only cheapened, its themes diluted, by the addition of unnecessary eye candy.  Indeed, this latest version of &quot;Solaris&quot; is largely a failure because it is rendered uninteresting and irrelevant precisely by the very strategy used to keep people watching.  All these maneuvers only serve to distract from the story, rather than to tell it.As for the DVD, I found the interviews totally self-aggrandizing and shameless in their claims of originality.  This movie clearly borrows imagery from great scifi movies, such as 2001 as well as 1972's Solaris.  Nowhere in the interviews is proper credit given to these earlier movies.  It seems from the interviews, that the producers and director of this movie want us to believe it represents a totally original form of scifi movie.  I didn't buy it in the least.I gave this movie one star for cinematography and sound.",1,Solaris Lacks Luster,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,3115,"['quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'prominant', 'place', 'science', 'fiction', 'book', 'catalogue', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'loss', 'final', 'confrontation', 'inner', 'demons', 'also', 'treatise', 'nature', 'how', 'subconscious', 'forces', 'shape', 'mold', 'ego', 'how', 'memory', 'love', 'shape', 'reality', 'not', 'enough', 'also', 'story', 'nature', 'God', 'relationship', 'man', 'Obviously', 'translating', 'book', 'screen', 'monumental', 'task', 'not', 'only', 'comlex', 'themes', 'also', 'fundamental', 'lack', 'physical', 'adventure', 'action', 'psychological', 'will', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', '1972', 'version', 'book', 'was', 'overall', 'successful', 'relaying', 'comlexities', 'Lem', 'ideas', 'however', 'very', 'slow-paced', 'long', 'consequently', 'effort', 'part', 'viewer', 'stay', 'focused', 'movie', 'recent', 'version', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'avoid', 'length', 'intellectual', 'challenge', 'offered', 'Tarkovsky', 'up', 'compromising', 'entire', 'movie', 'shorter', 'screenplay', 'directorial', 'bravado', 'will', 'lure', 'audience', 'peak', 'viewer', 'interest', 'story', 'Thus', 'signature', 'editorial', 'style', 'jump', 'cuts', 'handheld', 'shots', 'exquisite', 'cinematography', 'cache', 'actor', 'George', 'clooney', 'also', 'pared', 'story', 'down', 'focus', 'explore', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'detail', 'leaving', 'more', 'introspective', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'hidden', 'perhaps', 'buried', 'other', 'themes', 'book', 'are', 'there', 'have', 'really', 'tease', 'out', 'spiritual', 'issues', 'example', 'are', 'abruptly', 'rather', 'simplistically', 'introduced', 'dinner', 'party', 'scene', 'only', 'be', 'abandoned', 'remaining', 'exposition', 'Moreover', 'are', 'shown', 'Mr.', 'Clooney', 'derriere', 'gratuitously', 'two', 'occasions', 'infuse', 'movie', 'dose', 'sensationalism', 'lest', 'audience', 'fall', 'asleep', 'cinematography', 'very', 'effective', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'invloving', 'editing', 'becomes', 'tedious', 'away', 'story', 'doubt', 'challenging', 'project', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'let', 'alone', 'popular', 'cinema', 'however', 'found', 'use', 'such', 'trite', 'pandering', 'patronizing', 'somewhat', 'insulting', 'story', 'only', 'cheapened', 'themes', 'diluted', 'addition', 'unnecessary', 'eye', 'candy', 'Indeed', 'latest', 'version', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'largely', 'failure', 'rendered', 'uninteresting', 'irrelevant', 'precisely', 'very', 'strategy', 'used', 'keep', 'people', 'watching', 'maneuvers', 'only', 'serve', 'distract', 'story', 'rather', 'tell', 'it.As', 'DVD', 'found', 'interviews', 'totally', 'self-aggrandizing', 'shameless', 'claims', 'originality', 'movie', 'clearly', 'imagery', 'great', 'scifi', 'movies', 'such', '2001', 'as', 'well', '1972', 'Solaris', 'Nowhere', 'interviews', 'proper', 'credit', 'given', 'earlier', 'movies', 'interviews', 'producers', 'director', 'movie', 'want', 'believe', 'totally', 'original', 'form', 'scifi', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'least.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'cinematography', 'sound']",Solaris

Krebs of the ""Dobie Gillis"" TV show. There are also two corpses in the deep freeze.Soderbergh is nothing if not a perfectionist and therefore the physical production is flawless: all gleaming metallic surfaces and beautiful luminescent costumes. But unfortunately the story is puny and not as well thought out as his ""Traffic"" or ""Out of Sight"" for example. Do we know enough about Chris and Rheya to really care about them? Is the ""menace"" on the space station really a compelling threat to those on the space station or to the people back on earth?

But Solaris left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Its resolution is vague. I don't mean that it's ambiguous. I mean it's downright  nebulous. I hope it was clearer in the book, which I have not read. The film also spends a lot of time in dream and flashback sequences, which may wear on some viewers' patience.  &quot;Solaris&quot; is a very good-looking film. I like Steve Arnold and Keith Cunningham's art decoration and the images of the planet Solaris are beautiful. I recommend &quot;Solaris&quot; to committed science fiction fans and to fans of George Clooney. I'm not sure that there is enough in the film to hold the interest of general movie-goers.",3,Psychological Science Fiction,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,1943,"['Chris', 'Kelvin', 'George', 'Clooney', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'still', 'suicide', 'wife', 'few', 'years', 'before', 'communication', 'old', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Gibarian', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'who', 'doing', 'research', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'Gibarian', 'Chris', 'come', 'station', 'help', 'unspecified', 'problem', 'affecting', 'crew', 'When', 'Chris', 'Solaris', 'station', 'only', 'two', 'members', 'crew', 'left', 'alive', 'are', 'suffering', 'paranoia', 'delusions', 'depression', 'general', 'mental', 'mayhem', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'sense', 'explanation', 'events', 'When', 'sleep', 'night', 'Chris', 'dreams', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'When', 'Rheya', 'bed', 'Rheya', 'quot', 'visitor', 'quot', 'being', 'created', 'Solaris', 'identity', 'memories', 'space', 'station', 'crew', 'three', 'humans', 'must', 'try', 'agree', 'course', 'action', 'will', 'safely', 'return', 'Earth.', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Polish', 'science', 'fiction', 'author', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'screen', 'directed', 'photographed', 'edited', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Soderbergh', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'credits', 'are', 'pseudonyms', 'cast', 'very', 'effective', 'Solaris', 'left', 'feeling', 'dissatisfaction', 'resolution', 'vague', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ambiguous', 'mean', 'downright', 'nebulous', 'hope', 'was', 'clearer', 'book', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'dream', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'may', 'wear', 'viewers', 'patience', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'very', 'good-looking', 'film', 'Steve', 'Arnold', 'Keith', 'Cunningham', 'art', 'decoration', 'images', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'are', 'beautiful', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'committed', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'fans', 'George', 'Clooney', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'enough', 'film', 'hold', 'interest', 'general', 'movie-goers']",Solaris

The art direction, set design, special effects, cinematography, and music score are all superb.  The script, acting, and direction do NOT belie common sensibilities as many reviewers I've read, both professional and amateur, seem to suggest.  The characters involved are ""real"" and are well-grounded in social, scientific, and psychological reality--with important exceptions which I won't divulge.  It's this ""human"" groundedness which makes the strange happenings on the space station orbiting Solaris so compelling.The beautiful yet ominous face of the planet Solaris overhangs the proceedings as if it were the sword of Damocles.  Its presence is less of a mysterious shroud as much as an active interested observer, constantly peeking through the station's observation portals and visiting the minds of its visitors as they dream.  Initially, we're less interested in its scientific bases then in its machinations: Is it well-disposed or nefarious?  We can never really nail its intentions since those humans it affects seem themselves to determine how they are affected.  It's only later that we're engaged in the planet's scientific makeup as the station's crew plan a retreat to the familiar ""human"" machinations of Earth.This is a film whose arc and rhythms are perfectly in tune.  The thoughtful and curious viewer is thoroughly engaged from beginning to end.  If there's one area left wanting it's that I wished it would have delved even deeper and more engagingly into the psyches of its two main characters (those of George Clooney and Natascha McElhone) and of the others on the space station both living and dead; i.e. the hows and whys of planet Solaris and its cosmic relationship to human existence.  I was left wanting more, which many would proclaim to be a sign of the film's success.  I have to agree, but it also left me wanting to see the original three-hour Russian film of this title to see if my wants would be further fulfilled.By all means, do NOT feel obligated to view the added featurettes.  They are entirely antithetical to the spirit of this film and add absolutely nothing of value---they are worse than worthless.

753215,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00009ATIX,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","There may be spoilers.I saw this movie several years ago, but remember little about it.  I'm not sure why.  Tired, bored, drunk?  Who knows? I decided to give it another try. The film has great credentials.  Steven Soderberg directs, James Cameron and Jon Landau produce, George Clooney stars.  And it takes large cojones to take on Lem's tome and to remake Tarkovsky's critically acclaimed film.Soderberg (""Oceans 12 & 13, Che"") begins by chopping off most of the beginning sequence and I say good riddance.  We see glimpses of Chris Kelvin (Clooney) with his patients and he seems somewhat distant and lonely.  His friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) calls him from the space station and asks him to come and help close it down due to strange events he can't talk about over the airwaves.  Kelvin asks the government agents why they don't send in a security team.  They reply, they did.  What happened?  They disappeared.  Huh?So Kelvin goes anyway...and by himself!  Now really, how plausible is that?  Now that's out of the way, Soderberg's vision of the trip itself is beautifully filmed, with great color and impressive CGI.  He spends more time with the beauty of space than with the beauty of Earth. This is a bit of a reversal from Tarkovsky's film.  Once Kelvin arrives he isn't met by anyone and stumbles upon a cold storage locker where his friend lies dead.Searching the station, he finds 2 crew members.  A hyperactive Snow, played with initial craziness by Jeremy Davies (""Lost"", ""Justified"") and a more solemn Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis).  They talk of ""visitors"" but Kelvin isn't convinced.  At least not until he sleeps.  He dreams of his life with his now dead wife Rheya.  At first we don't know what happened but we can tell Kelvin feels guilty.  When he awakes, Rheya is in bed with him.  Natascha McElhone (""Californication"") brings her British accent and high cheekbones to the role and is very good.The film of course borrows from Tarkovsky but also ""Blade Runner"", ""THX 1138"" and ""2001"".  It is this last film that I was reminded of most.  Not only because of the theme, but the desolation, the loneliness and the stark but beautiful images.  The acting is solid all the way around and Clooney in particular works hard in one of his best performances.  I should also mention that Cliff Martinez provides a terrific soundtrack.The movie isn't for everyone.  It is slow.  It focuses primarily on the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya, both in dream visions and the ""visitor"" recreation.  There are many unanswered questions about what's real and what isn't, not only in the film but in the universe which we all live...and die.

Just because they are gone does not mean you stop making memories of them. What you remember of them is only a part of who they really are, however, and your memories grow and change shape as the years go by.This movie explores questions of love, how love can go wrong, how it leaves a void when it's over, and mostly, how our memories of someone are not the same as who that person really was.  These questions are never directly present, but hidden in the dialogue between Chris and Rheya.Anyone looking for a Sci-Fi flick will be dissappointed at the methodical, calm pace of the movie. Someone looking for a love story will be dissappointed by the personal boundaries in Chris and Rheya's relationship.

753217,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B00009ATIX,Monsieur Valentine,"[1, 1]","SPOILER ALERTI thoroughly enjoyed this movie! To me, this was not about love or death, rather it hinted at the posssibilites of future technology and provided just one example of its consequences.The idea that humans being replicated is not absurd, and its not based on magic or miracles. Whilst cloning is replication through genetic engineering another technology that has recently been in the spotlight is Nanotechnology. As I understand it, nanotechnology is the chemical process of putting atoms side by side to create any object that is desired. Everything that exists is made up of various atoms arranged in unique shapes and structures. With nanotechnology we could change coal to diamond by simply altering the chemcial structure couldnt we? In time, we could replicate anything and anyone. Sub-atomic self replicating robots putting together atoms to create or repair anything that we desire. So is that what Solaris is. An alien life form with the ability of nanotechnology. Maybe the alien life form is those tiny sub atomic robots.The second concept that the movie plays with is memory. You would be surprised how inaccurate our memory is. How 12 years ago I remember my mate wearing an orange T-shirt to my party but in fact it was red. Our retrieval of information from our memory bank is not perfect. And so Clooney's wife was a product of what he remembered... a suicidal woman. And thats what she kept doing. It is in the end when he realises how wrong his memory had served him... that her suicide was a spontaneous and impulsive act after he had left her. And hence she returns not suicidal in the end.So in my eyes, those self replicating robots now reached earth ... and who knows what would happen from there.So.. what is life... just a bunch of atoms in a particular arrangement. Psychological, social and physical existence of a human are just all atoms arranged in a particlular order.

And two things came immediately to mind: 1) this is NOT as bad as the one-star-review folks have implied and 2) this is a philosophical, contemplative slice of sci-fi/drama - high on substance. I liked it (and I`m quite picky when it comes to sci-fi). The plot - which, has anyone noticed, bears a striking resemblance to the movie Sphere - is basically about relationships reconstructed with the benefit of hindsight.  The pacing is admittedly slow, but it wouldn't really have worked otherwise. You still get sucked in, believe me. George Clooney pulls off the non-hunk role admirably, although personally I would have cast someone a little less well-known. In any event Clooney is upstaged by Natasha McElhone, who is beautiful, strange and frightening and...just amazing. This is a great, lavish work of cinematography. The camera lingers lovingly on the flickering lamps and sterile, minimalistic environments of the spaceship interior (Stanley Kubrick`s influence is unmistakable). To sum up, this is a great sci-fi movie that is more about love than slimy, malevolent beings (your girlfriend will enjoy it as much as you will), and there are plenty of moral and ethical insights that crop along the way, making this hugely enjoyable viewing for amateur philosophers, sci-fi buffs and coffee-table intellectuals alike.

753224,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B00009ATIX,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[4, 6]","This film is the second (or third, if you countEvent Horizon) big screen adaptation of Polish sci-fi author Stanislaw Lem's novelSolaris.  Thefirstwas made by the Russian master filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, and incorporates Lem's intense speculation regarding a future in which our own hidden drives come to haunt us through our technologies with his own slowly meditative style.  Soderbergh's version highlights different aspects of the novel but remains a lavish and intense and very worthy adaptation.A psychologist travels to a remote space station -- orbiting a unique planet called Solaris -- in order to investigate the strange behavior of its crew and offer recommendations as to the future of the operation.  What he finds is a planet that works on your mind and memories in strange ways.  In the original novel, the core theme explored through this story seemed to be the impossibility of purely rational detachment and objectivity.  We cannot confront the phenomena of the cosmos without also coming to grips with ourselves and our own demons.In Tarkovsky's vision the voyage to outer space turns out to be a kind of metaphor for a certain kind of transcendence that turns out to be both false and impossible.  Genuine transcendence, in Tarkovsky's view, is not about detachment and is not (as traditionally conceived) a freeing of the mind from the confines of the body and from the bondage of our emotional life -- but involves the transformation of body, earth and feeling through art.  Soderbergh's version captures elements of both, but also reworks themes from his own work as early as ""Sex, Lies and Videotape.""When James Cameron announced he was going to remake Tarkovsky'sSolaris, based on the novel of the same name by Stanislaw Lem, I worried that he was going to turn it from a compelling meditation on our desire for transcendence into a B-horror sci-fi pic with high production values.  That had already been done, I thought, and not all that badly, inEvent Horizon(an obvious but uncredited loose adaptation where the demons from the characters' pasts generated by the planet -- in this case a black hole -- turn out to be literally that: demons from Hell).  Luckily, Cameron decided to turn the project over to Stephen Soderbergh.  I got interested again -- and Soderbergh delivered with a gorgeously filmed and very intriguing arthouse science fiction near-masterpiece.  His film is not so much a remake of Tarkovsky's film as a reconsideration of the original novel, that is in some ways more faithful to the novel, but that at the same time takes up themes unique to Tarkovsky's vision and reworks them in ways that fit with Soderbergh's own obsessions: less with the possibility of spiritual transcendence and more with the difficulties of intimacy and trust and of the ways memories and guilt haunt the present.George Clooney is perfect as Chris Kelvin, played here as a once-confident and cocky man haunted by loss.  Although the film's box office suffered because the film was marketed as an action picture with a flashy George Clooney as star, and then audiences saw a brooding and contemplative film that was as far as possible from the flash of Ocean's Eleven, this is to my mind one of Clooney's best performances and certainly showed what he was capable of before films likeSyrianaandMichael Clayton.  Though Jeremy Davies seems to be stuck in a certain kind of role, he was perfect for this one as a brilliant but neurotic and extremely paranoid scientist, an intriguing alternative to the role played by Anatoli Solonitsyn in Tarkovsky's version.  What I think is most interesting about the film is the way that Soderbergh takes the basic idea and reworks it in ways that involve reconsiderations of the themes from films likesex, lies, and videotapeandSchizopolis: the ways we create false masks for our lovers to hide our insecurities, that art can work as a kind of false memory, allowing us to reconstruct our past and achieve a false intimacy without risk.  The basic science fiction conceit of Solaris is that the planet is able to replicate memories and especially those one would like to repress because they are unsettling and generate guilt, and bring them back to life, and the varying reactions to these replications suggest different ways of dealing with memories and images and of reconciling ourselves to the failures and guilt in the past.  Soderbergh makes this a story of how one man is able to reconcile himself with his own guilt by collaborating in the creation of and then embracing a lie, a fiction, an artwork.",4,Soderbergh's underrated remake of Stanislaw Lem's classic science fiction masterpiece is provocative and beautiful,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,4574,"['film', 'second', 'third', 'countEvent', 'Horizon', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Polish', 'sci-fi', 'author', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'novelSolaris', 'Thefirstwas', 'made', 'Russian', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'Lem', 'intense', 'speculation', 'regarding', 'future', 'own', 'hidden', 'drives', 'come', 'haunt', 'technologies', 'own', 'slowly', 'meditative', 'style', 'Soderbergh', 'version', 'highlights', 'different', 'aspects', 'novel', 'lavish', 'intense', 'very', 'worthy', 'adaptation.A', 'psychologist', 'travels', 'remote', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'unique', 'planet', 'called', 'Solaris', 'order', 'investigate', 'strange', 'behavior', 'crew', 'offer', 'recommendations', 'future', 'operation', 'What', 'planet', 'mind', 'memories', 'strange', 'ways', 'original', 'novel', 'core', 'theme', 'explored', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'impossibility', 'purely', 'rational', 'detachment', 'objectivity', 'can', 'not', 'confront', 'phenomena', 'cosmos', 'also', 'coming', 'grips', 'ourselves', 'own', 'demons.In', 'Tarkovsky', 'vision', 'voyage', 'outer', 'space', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'metaphor', 'certain', 'kind', 'transcendence', 'out', 'be', 'false', 'impossible', 'Genuine', 'transcendence', 'Tarkovsky', 'view', 'not', 'detachment', 'not', 'traditionally', 'conceived', 'freeing', 'mind', 'confines', 'body', 'bondage', 'emotional', 'life', 'transformation', 'body', 'earth', 'feeling', 'art', 'Soderbergh', 'version', 'elements', 'also', 'themes', 'own', 'work', 'as', 'early', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'When', 'James', 'Cameron', 'announced', 'was', 'going', 'remake', ""Tarkovsky'sSolaris"", 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'worried', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'compelling', 'meditation', 'desire', 'transcendence', 'B-horror', 'sci-fi', 'pic', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'thought', 'not', 'badly', 'inEvent', 'Horizon', 'obvious', 'uncredited', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'where', 'demons', 'characters', 'pasts', 'generated', 'planet', 'case', 'black', 'hole', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'literally', 'demons', 'Hell', 'Luckily', 'Cameron', 'decided', 'turn', 'project', 'Stephen', 'Soderbergh', 'got', 'interested', 'again', 'Soderbergh', 'delivered', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'very', 'intriguing', 'arthouse', 'science', 'fiction', 'near-masterpiece', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'remake', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'reconsideration', 'original', 'novel', 'ways', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'same', 'time', 'up', 'themes', 'unique', 'Tarkovsky', 'vision', 'reworks', 'ways', 'fit', 'Soderbergh', 'own', 'obsessions', 'less', 'possibility', 'spiritual', 'transcendence', 'more', 'difficulties', 'intimacy', 'trust', 'ways', 'memories', 'guilt', 'haunt', 'present.George', 'Clooney', 'perfect', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'played', 'here', 'once-confident', 'cocky', 'man', 'haunted', 'loss', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'suffered', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'action', 'picture', 'flashy', 'George', 'Clooney', 'star', 'then', 'audiences', 'saw', 'brooding', 'contemplative', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'far', 'possible', 'flash', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'mind', 'one', 'Clooney', 'best', 'performances', 'certainly', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'capable', 'films', 'likeSyrianaandMichael', 'Clayton', 'Though', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'be', 'stuck', 'certain', 'kind', 'role', 'was', 'perfect', 'one', 'brilliant', 'neurotic', 'extremely', 'paranoid', 'scientist', 'intriguing', 'alternative', 'role', 'played', 'Anatoli', 'Solonitsyn', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'What', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'way', 'Soderbergh', 'basic', 'idea', 'reworks', 'ways', 'involve', 'reconsiderations', 'themes', 'films', 'likesex', 'videotapeandSchizopolis', 'ways', 'create', 'false', 'masks', 'lovers', 'hide', 'insecurities', 'art', 'can', 'work', 'kind', 'false', 'memory', 'allowing', 'reconstruct', 'past', 'achieve', 'false', 'intimacy', 'risk', 'basic', 'science', 'fiction', 'conceit', 'Solaris', 'planet', 'able', 'replicate', 'memories', 'especially', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'repress', 'are', 'unsettling', 'generate', 'guilt', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'varying', 'reactions', 'replications', 'suggest', 'different', 'ways', 'dealing', 'memories', 'images', 'reconciling', 'failures', 'guilt', 'past', 'Soderbergh', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'able', 'reconcile', 'own', 'guilt', 'collaborating', 'creation', 'then', 'embracing', 'lie', 'fiction', 'artwork']",Solaris

When he arrives, he learns that a crew member has committed suicide, and the two surviving crew (Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis) are experiencing some rather strange phenomina.  Soon enough, Kelvin begins to be visited by the image of his dead wife (Natascha McElhone), and we learn that this mysterious planet can reach into your most painful memories and make them real.  Solaris' problems lie within Soderbergh's screenplay; his subtlety is good to a point, the film implies more than it should explain, and the ending is too happy of an ending and is superbly disappointing.  All that aside however, Solaris is criminally underrated, and despite it's many flaws, it is still an incredible piece of film that outshines many of the over the top glossy Hollywood product that is way too abundant today.  Clooney is surprisingly superb, and McElhone gives the finest performance of her career in a role that many actresses would have a difficult time doing.  Yes it's purposely slow moving.

753227,A1BXRM9U3XTLCJ,B00009ATIX,"Nina Munteanu ""SF Girl""","[7, 9]","Steven Soderbergh's stylish psychological thriller, released November 2002 in the United States by 20th Century Fox , eloquently captures the theme of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 book. Written almost fifty years ago, ""Solaris"" is an intelligent, introspective drama of great depth and imagination that meditates on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God.Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" is a poem to Lem's prose. Both explore the universe around us and the universe within. Not particularly palatable to North America's multiplex crowd, eager for easily accessed answers, ""Solaris"" will appeal more to those with a more esoteric appreciation for art.When I saw the 2002 20th Century Fox remake of ""Solaris"" (released on DVD soon after), I was blissfully unaware of its legendary history. I say blissfully because I harbored no pre-conceived notions or expectations and therefore I was struck like a child viewing the Northern Lights for the first time. The stylish, evocative and dream-like imagery flowed to a surrealistic soundtrack by Cliff Martinez like the colors of a Salvadore Dali painting.It was only later that I discovered that Russian experimental director, Andrei Tarkovsky, had previously filmed ""Solaris"" in 1972 based on Stanislaw Len's masterful 1961 book of the same name. Reprinted by Harcourt, Inc. with a new cover featuring a sensual image from the 2002 film, the original book was translated in 1970 from the French version by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox for Faber and Faber Ltd.Written almost fifty years ago, ""Solaris"" is a dark psychological drama. Soderbergh faithfully captures the intellectual yet sensual essense of Lem's book by tempering the language and movements. Featuring a fluid and haunting soundtrack, his film flows like a choregraphed ballet. There is a dream-like quality to the film that is enhanced by creative use of camera angles, unusual lighting, tones and contrast, and sparse language. ""Solaris"" is not an action film (no one gets shot, at least not on stage), yet the tension surges and builds to its irrevocable conclusion from frame to frame like a slow motion Tai Chi form.In response to his friend's plea, a depressed psychologist with the ironic name of Kris Kelvin (played with quiet depth by George Clooney), sets out on a mission to bring home the disfunctional crew of a research space station orbitting the distant planet, Solaris. Kelvin arrives at the space station, Prometheus, to find his friend, Gibarian, dead (by suicide) and a paranoid and disturbed crew, who are obviously withholding a terrible secret from him. It is not long before he learns the secret first hand: some unknown power (apparently the planet itself) taps into his mind and produces a solid corporeal version of his tortured longing: his beloved wife, Rheya (played sensitively by Natascha McElhone) who'd committed suicide years ago. Faced with a solid reminder, Kelvin yearns to reconcile with his guilt in his wife's death and struggles to understand the alien force manifested in the form of his wife. He learns that the other crew are equally influenced by Solaris and have been grappling, each in their own way, with their ""demons,"" psychologically trapping them there.Ironically, our hero's epic journey of great distance has only led him back to himself. The alien force defies Kelvin's efforts to understand its motives; whether it is benign, hostile, or even sentient. Kelvin has no common frame of reference to judge and therefore to react. This leaves him with what he thinks he does understand: that Rheya is a product of his own mind, his memories of her, and therefore a mirror of his deepest guilt  but perhaps also an opportunity to redeem himself.Lem packs each page of his slim 204 page book with a wealth of intellectual introspection. Through first person narrative, he intimately unveils the complicated influence of this arcane force on Kelvin. Lem explains it this way: ""I wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that certainly exists, in a mighty manner perhaps, but cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images.""Such an incomprehensible entity would serve as a giant mirror for our own motives, yearnings and versions of reality. For me the contrast presented by such an arcane alien force emphatically -- but also ironically -- defines what it is to be human. It is only when faced with what we are not that we discover what we are. Later in the book, Kelvin cynically observes: ""Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labrynth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed."" In the film Gibarian sadly proclaims of the Solaris mission: ""We don't want other worlds - we want mirrors.""Lem's existentialist leaning is provided throughout the book and even alluded to in the name he chose for the space station: Prometheus. In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humankind for which Zeus chained him to a rock and sent an eagle to eat his liver (which grew back daily). It is interesting that Soderbergh chose to send Prometheus to a fiery crash and named Kelvin's dead wife, Rheya, after the Greek goddess, mother of Zeus and all Olympian gods. In a late passage of Lem's book, a devastated and sorrowful Kelvin formulates a personal theory of an imperfect god, ""a god who has created clocks, but not the time they measure . . . a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose  a god who simply is.""Soderbergh addresses Lem's existential vision with several brief but pivotal scenes. One occurs when Kelvin's dead friend, Gibarian, returns to him in a dream on Prometheus and responds to Kelvin's question, ""What does Solaris want?"" with: ""Why do you think it has to want something?"" Another scene occurs as a flashback to a dinner on Earth, when the real Rheya, prior to her suicide, argues with both Gibarian and her own husband about the existence of an all-knowing purposeful God, which both men argue is a myth made up by humankind: to Kelvin's suggestion that ""the whole idea of God was dreamed up by man,"" Rheya insists that she's ""talking about a higher form of intelligence,"" to which Gibarian cuts in with: ""No, you're talking about a man in a white beard again. You are ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't."" Kelvin fuels it with: ""we're a mathematical probability,"" which prompts Rheya's challenge: ""how do you explain that out of the billions of creatures on this planet we're the only ones conscious of our immortality?"" Neither man has an answer. Gibarian later commits suicide on Solaris rather than deal with the manifestation of his conscience. And I can't help but wonder if the underlying reason for his inability to reconcile with his ""demon"" is because he was unequipped to, given his nihilistic beliefs.Gibarian also tells Kelvin (and we must remember that all this is Kelvin really saying this to himself through his memory of the character): ""There are no answers, only choices."" It is interesting then that the first pivotal choice in the story is made by the doppelganger Rheya (also a manifestation of Solaris but a mirror of Kelvin's own mind) and it is a choice made out of love: to be annihilated, rather then serve as an instrument of this unknown alien power to study the man she loves.Some critics have called Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" pretentious, boring and devoid of action and intimacy. I strongly disagree. It is simply that, as with Lem's original story, Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" does not surrender its messages easily. The viewer, as with the reader, must intuitively feel his or her way through the fluid poetry, free to interpret and ponder the questions. This is what I think good art should do. And I feel both the original book and Soderbergh's movie do this with enthralling brilliance.Where Soderbergh and Lem depart lies more in each artist's personal vision and belief. We are defined by the questions we ask and Lem asks a great deal of questions. Whether the forces that drive our universe are best defined by current science and the mind as random without purpose or as the manifestation of arcane motive more readily known through spirituality and the heart is largely a matter of belief.Reviewer, Rick Kisonak, asserted that Lem's ""novel is an icy meditation on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God. It poses countless metaphysical questions and makes a point of answering none of them. In Soderbergh's hands, however, `Solaris' becomes a celebration of romantic love, which culminates in the revelation of a caring, forgiving creator. At the end of his book, Lem writes [Kelvin ponders]: `the age-old faith of lovers and poets in the power of love, stronger than death, that finis vitae sed non amoris [life ends but not love] is a lie, useless and not even funny.' The director ignores the author in favor of just such a poet."" Kisonak is referring here to Rheya's interest in Dylan Thomas and its reference throughout the movie. Another reviewer, Dennis Morton, goes so far as to suggest that the screenplay of ""Solaris"" is the first stanza of the poem, which ends with: ""...though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.""While I agree with some of Kisonak's reasoning, I think he has missed the point of Lem's book. If one continues to read from the passage Kisonak quoted above  as Kris Kelvin transcends from what he ""thinks"" in his intellect to what he feels and ""knows"" in his heart, to accept his (and humanity's) destiny with humble fatalism  we learn that Lem ends his book in much the same way as Soderbergh's movie: life ends but not love. The endings are physically different, in keeping with some radical alterations from the book in the movie's setting (e.g., the original Solaris station is located on the planet and Lem assiduously describes Kelvin's observations and interactions with the alien ocean; whereas Soderbergh's crew virtually never leave orbit and the planet remains aloof in the background, reflecting Soderbergh's focus). Yet, Kris makes the same choice in faith and love in both book and movie (although the choices play out differently).In matters of faith and love, here is what Kris has to say in the book: ""Must I go on living here then, among the objects we both had touched, in the air she had breathed? . . . In the hope of her return? I hoped for nothing. And yet I lived in expectation . . . I did not know what achievements, what mockery, even what tortures still awaited me. I knew nothing, and I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past."" In the end of both movie and book, Kris Kelvin lets go of his fears and lets his spirit rise in wonder at what astonishing things Solaris (and the universe) will offer next.In the final analysis, both book and movie are incredibly valuable but for different reasons. Soderbergh paints an impressionistic poem, using Kafkaesque brushstrokes on a simpler canvas, to Lem's complex tapestry of multi-level prose. Lem challenges us far more by refusing to impose his personal views, where Soderbergh lets us glimpse his hopeful vision. I think that both, though, come to the same conclusion about the ethereal, mysterious and eternal nature of love.On the one hand, love may connect us within a fractal autopoietic network to the infinity of the inner and outer universe, uniting us with God and His purpose in a collaboration of faith. On the other hand, love may empower us to accept our place in a vast unknowable and amoral universe to form an island of hope in a purposeless sea of indifference.Whether love mends our souls to the fabric of our destiny; enslaves us on an impossible journey of desperate yearning; or seizes us in a strangling embrace of unspeakable terror at what lurks within  surely, then, love IS God, in all its possible manifestations. This is unquestionably the message that unifies book and movie. And it is one worth proclaiming.",5,Like the Flowing Colors of a Salvadore Dali Painting.,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,12051,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'stylish', 'psychological', 'thriller',

The 1972 Tarkovsky version unfolds very slowly (which may make some people crazy) and makes very effective use of a minimal budget, but builds to considerable power. It's a haunting film and thought-provoking, and is far truer to the book.

Although the film has some good cinematography, the plot is tedious and the theme evasive.  The characters are rather bland and not very credible leaving the viewer with a rather empty feeling when the film is over.The psychological profiles of Clooney's character along with Jeremy Davies' are simply not credible as astronauts who are on a long mission in outer space.  What agency in their right mind would send someone whose wife comitted suicide on such a precarious and solitary mission.  As far as Davies, the character is psychotic and mentally unstable from the start.  Again, what organization would leave such expensive machinery in the hands of a pair of basket cases?  In terms of the story line, the plot clumsily conveys the theme of a psychological struggle for lost love with endless scene reptitions reaching no real climax or suspense.All in all, the film has some good cinematography but is burdened with a slow unengaging plot carried by excessive repetition of scenes through characters that are rather bland and not very credible leading to a fish-tail ending.

When I heard that Hollywood wanted to do the remake I just fell clean out of my chair. Then I managed to see this thing, although I did not want to, and I must say that although I would have given it a little bit of credit for maybe trying an alternative take on Stanislaw Lem's book of the same name, this one just ends up being not that engaging with an uneventful plot that does not even try. You can cook this one up anyway you want but this is just plain bad.Clooney walks circles around every other actor here and gives it all he has got. Seeing him going crazy, breaking away piece by piece, was fantastic but the film is really not that inspired and ends up looking like a 2001 ripoff (including the DVD cover).The metaphysics behind the story are messed up in the worst possible way. Somewhere along the line the director just gave up and decided that the love story was what this film was about and the metaphysics where just pointless to engage in. So he is left doing this thing about Clooney trying to establish if being with a space ghost that looks and feels like his wife is the same thing as being with his wife and ponders over this again and again and again... until you just snooze away into your hybernation chamber wanting to wake up when Clooney draws his conclusion... which is like 76 Billion light years away at the rate this film moves along.It is amazing that although the director tried to get back to Lem's grass roots and away from Tarkovsky that he still made garbage out of it. The film may *look* good but that only lasts so long. Producer James Cameron was obviously absent from the whole thing, still in Titanic na-na-land, until the distributors put it out. There is nothing here to even remotely suggest that the talent wanted anything less than to get it over and done with and the hell out of the studio so that they could get on with their lives. To be honest they should have just burnt the negatives and cut their losses. This one is not something good to have on your CV - or for anyone to see it for that matter either.This film did not break the bank, but it did do a number of things. Darren Aronofsky lost his production funds for ""The Fountain"" because Hollywood was afraid that it would bomb like this one. I think that it was terrible that Hollywood would do that to such a talent like Aronofsky based on this over-rated director's botch up job.Sadly this is just more proof that some gems should be left alone.

I'm going to get into spoilers and meanings and demystify the ending for you.Kelvin (played by Clooney) is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist (not really sure, but it doesn't matter) who is sent to a space ship that is docked near a planet named Solaris to determine what has happened to the crew and if the mission can be salvaged or the crew returned home. While onboard the ship, Kelvin flashes back a few years prior to memories of his ex-wife who committed suicide after they had a fight about her having an abortion without telling him. Angry about her having the abortion without telling him, Kelvin tells her he is leaving her, she replies ""I won't make it without you"" to which he responds coldly ""then you won't make it."" She commits suicide. Kelvin returns some hours later to their apartment to find that she has taken her own life.Kelvin is haunted by this guilt and has never really gotten over the suicide of his wife.Onboard the space ship Kelvin dreams about his ex-wife and to his surprise she has appeared on the ship. At least someone that looks exactly like her. What has actually happened is that by dreaming about her, Kelvin has manifested a clone of her onto the ship, but the clone has no real emotional connection to the memories that Kelvin has of his ex-wife. The clone keeps attempting suicide because that is how Kelvin remembers her, as suicidal. But since she really isn't alive in the first place, she can't die.The remaining crew discuss whether to return to Earth or not. At first it appears that Kelvin has been transported back to Earth and resumes his life in his New York apartment but later we learn Kelvin actually chooses to stay on the ship and dream of himself as being back in the New York apartment with his ex-wife. He in essence chooses a fantasy life over a reality life, though this is a concept that the film maker would like you to think about. What is fantasy and what is reality and isn't our perception really more important than ""reality"" anyway.I liked the film. I've watched it twice now. Vanilla Sky (2001) covers similar ground but that movie was  visually and auditorally stunning whereas Solaris has more of a literary feel to it. Like someone is reading the story to you, and you are looking at some illustrations on a page. That probably appeals to some, and doesn't appeal to others. I feel, however, that the film is responsible for not only putting forth the premise of fantasy v. reality, but also to move that discussion forward with some original insight. But this film doesn't deliver on that.

In this case, a psychologist from Earth is assigned to a space station orbiting a strange planet (sun?) called Solaris, to sort out what has been driving the crew to suicide and murder. By the time he gets there, only two crew-members remain alive - and he starts getting visits from an alien impersonating his dead wife.  It doesn't take him long to form an emotional attachment to her, even though he knows on an intellectual level that it can't really be her.  She acknowledges that she's formed out of his memories of her - so, even if he remembers some things wrong, that's how she'll appear - and this could have been interesting to explore.  But we never learn much more than that - what these aliens really are, whether their intention is malevolent or benign, what they really want - and in fact, we never learn much of *anything* in this movie.  It's all scenery (and not very interesting scenery, at that), long meaningless pauses, unpleasant background music; it drags endlessly toward absolutely no resolution.  By the end (finally!), you're not even sure what really happened.  I suppose that was the point, but it's neither insightful nor satisfying.  Had this story been condensed into half an hour, it might have been a nice ""mood piece"" - but movie-length, it was just soporific.

753237,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00009ATIX,"""qmlhcb""","[44, 50]","Solaris is a film that not everyone will walk away embracing. Many will, in fact, walk away loathing it, carrying a reaction of boredom and anger at wasting their money to see it. But others, such as myself, will come away delighted from a wonderful, cerebral film that carries with it a heavy question: What would you do if you could regain an artificial version of something you lost?The reason many will hate Solaris is because of its deliberately slow pace with little action or dialogue. Everything spoken and seen has a significant purpose, not a moment is wasted. And many expecting a certain genre of film won't get what they want out of it, either. It isn't science fiction exactly, and it's not really a romance or horror. It's a film that takes elements of all these to create a simple story about irreplaceable loss and what you might do if you somehow found a way to replace it with a shadow of its former self.The film, a remake of a 1972 film of the same name, and based on a book by Stanislaw Lem, follows psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who is assigned to visit a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Something strange is going on and a team sent to investigate it never returned. Kelvin, who has some experience with the crew, is the owning company's last chance before giving up on the station. When Kelvin arrives, there are only two crew members left. When his deceased wife suddenly appears at his bedside, Kelvin gets wrapped up in the strange goings-on, and tries to get to the bottom of things. But one of the themes of this film is some things in life have no answers, as Kelvin soon discovers. What really makes this film work is the way it presents questions and ideas such as these, leaving the audience time to ponder them. As Kelvin learns his resurrected wife isn't quite real, the viewer is forced to consider if they would want to live with an imitation of a lost love, or rely only on memories. And the question of the accuracy of memory is also raised. How well do we remember how people truly were?What really aides the tone of Solaris is its mixing of genres. There are many science fiction touches, and the film seems to use much of the visual style of 2001, A Space Odyssey. But the experience is more human and intimate then that large scale film. It uses some horror elements, including an unsettling score and a potentially scary situation, much like in the film Event Horizon. But it never becomes in your face scary, it's held back a notch. There is romance through flashbacks, as Kelvin remembers the love he once had, and how he lost it. But the somber tone drowns out any happiness there once was. This mix, combined with wonderfully scripted yet simple dialogue create a haunting atmosphere that will open the door to hours of discussion after the film. Much of that discussion will revolve around the film's cryptic ending. It's a conclusion that everyone will have to decide for themselves what happens. After all, as the film so eloquently states, there are no answers, only choices.The film uses some simple methods to keep the story flowing and avoid confusion. Most apparent is the use of blue lighting on the station, and yellow lighting on Earth to keep straight the flashbacks with present time. The results are subtle but unmistakable. Also, director Steven Soderbergh wisely keeps the film length exceptionally short, as the slow pacing of the film, a necessity to its subject, makes the film seem longer then it is. The acting is also top notch. With a very small cast, Clooney plays his role perfectly, seeming to carry a great weight of grief throughout, and Jeremy Davies as one of the remaining crew members manages to bring a little light-heartedness to the dreary nature of the film.As stated before, this film isn't for everyone. If you look at film as simply entertainment, then skip Solaris.

753240,A10CVKXWJZENY6,B00009ATIX,RB,"[8, 8]","First for the caveats to this review: I haven't read Lem's story, I haven't seen the original Russian film of it, and I haven't read the 264 other reviews currently shown here (though I might work through some of them later), I won't begin to try to summarize the plot, I'm not a particular fan of Lem or science fiction or of the director or any of the actors, and I'm writing this after having watched the film 3 times (very rare for me) over the past 6 months. So with that all out of the way...I find this film to be excellent for several reasons: a moving and thought provoking story is probably the most obvious, but also excellent understated direction and straightforward, sincere acting are others. Good casting, too, I'd have to say -- you don't spend the movie thinking, oh, I'm watching (actor's name) playing (description of character). Good on-screen chemistry between Clooney and McElhone would be essential to this film, and that comes through, along with the director's interesting treatment of them. It helps that it's also definitely different from the vast majority of other sci-fi or non-sci-fi movies out there in its level of emotion. Part of that difference, and perhaps another reason for its quality, is its ambiguity. If there's one warning that should go out to those considering seeing it, it's that they shouldn't see it if they enjoy clearly defined outcomes.The movie grapples courageously with LOSS, which is essentially what it's about, and you forget it's sci-fi almost throughout, except when the occasional unavoidable scene/line reminds you. But you're enveloped in a story about connections between people, how they relate to each other, the sometimes unavoidable selfishness of everyone in their perspectives on the world, and what that can cost. It has gotten richer to me through the subsequent viewings, perhaps because you see more or perhaps because you just have more time to sink into these themes.I really cannot understand why people would DISlike this film (unless again they're just searching for something much more straightforward), but I think many would like it, even if they don't normally like science fiction in general, because of the degree of emotion and though and humanity in the story.",5,Hard to DISlike this film,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,2249,"['First', 'caveats', 'review', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Lem', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'Russian', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', '264', 'other', 'reviews', 'currently', 'shown', 'here', 'might', 'work', 'later', 'wo', ""n't"", 'begin', 'try', 'summarize', 'plot', ""'m"", 'not', 'particular', 'fan', 'Lem', 'science', 'fiction', 'director', 'actors', ""'m"", 'writing', 'having', 'watched', 'film', '3', 'times', 'very', 'rare', 'past', '6', 'months', 'So', 'way', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'excellent', 'several', 'reasons', 'moving', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'probably', 'most', 'obvious', 'also', 'excellent', 'understated', 'direction', 'straightforward', 'sincere', 'acting', 'are', 'others', 'Good', 'casting', 'too', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'movie', 'thinking', 'oh', ""'m"", 'watching', 'actor', 'name', 'playing', 'description', 'character', 'Good', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Clooney', 'McElhone', 'would', 'be', 'essential', 'film', 'through', 'director', 'interesting', 'treatment', 'also', 'definitely', 'different', 'vast', 'majority', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'non-sci-fi', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'level', 'emotion', 'Part', 'difference', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'quality', 'ambiguity', 'one', 'warning', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'considering', 'seeing', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'enjoy', 'clearly', 'defined', 'outcomes.The', 'movie', 'grapples', 'courageously', 'LOSS', 'essentially', 'what', 'forget', 'sci-fi', 'almost', 'when', 'occasional', 'unavoidable', 'scene/line', ""'re"", 'enveloped', 'story', 'connections', 'people', 'how', 'relate', 'other', 'sometimes', 'unavoidable', 'selfishness', 'everyone', 'perspectives', 'world', 'what', 'can', 'cost', 'gotten', 'richer', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'perhaps', 'see', 'more', 'perhaps', 'just', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'sink', 'themes.I', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'DISlike', 'film', 'again', ""'re"", 'just', 'searching', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'straightforward', 'think', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'like', 'science', 'fiction', 'general', 'degree', 'emotion', 'humanity', 'story']",Solaris

Sure, you'd expect people under mental and emotional distress to act irrationally, but even Charles Manson would probably be scratching his head watching the characters in this movie.  A lot of the problems with this film could have to do with parts that were edited out, which it's pretty obvious that there was a good amount of material left on the cutting room floor.  I can see why Jim Cameron stepped away from the director's chair.  He probably saw where this was headed early on.And there are two things that really grate on my nerves.  One of them is Jeremy Davies' method of acting.  The other is obnoxious gum chewers.

I doubt I'd rate it any higher even if its predecessor didn't exist. If this effort earns a 3, Tarkovsky's would be off the map: literally circumnavigating the earth. Tarkovsky is on record about not being happy with his film and the difficulties he had working with the actors. But they are far more subtle, internalised performances than we have here with the Sondabergh. Neither film pays overdue attention to the details of Lem's novel. That's not an issue with film anyway. But if you've seen Tarkovsky's work, for all its tedious arguments and sense of timelessness, you are beholding something you will never forget. If ever one of his films exemplified the title of his collected writings,'Sculpting With Time', it's this one. It is majestic. Not in a panoramic sense but in the psychological: teasing out Lem's themes of love and projection. We simply don't get a grip from the lead actors, even Clooney, of forces worming out of their own consciences. That's partly the star system working against itself. Clooney is, well, Clooney; another day at the office. And you can't forget it. His 'ex' has seductive star glamour, but the voice is frigid.

Kearns-White ""rockiw""","[8, 22]","Solaris is a sci-fi, futuristic, romantic existentialist flick that tries to challenge the audience and the main character's (George Clooney as Dr. Chris Kelvin) ideas about life, death, heaven, reincarnation and life after death. It is wonderful goal for a film to have, but it was a noble plan that failed horribly.Dr. Kelvin is a therapist sent to a space station that is orbiting the planet Solaris. He is supposed to find out why the remaining crew won't come home. Or is he there to figure out why most of the crew was murdered? Or did they commit suicide? Actually, I'm not sure why he is sent there. Solaris creates facsimiles of the crew's dearly departed, mainly Kelvin's late wife, from their memories. I am not sure why the planet Solaris is doing it and neither does the crew. I'm not sure why many things are happening in this movie. The plot isn't too convoluted to be followed. There just isn't any plot at all.The best part of this movie was seeing George Clooney naked-not once, but twice. My favorite nude shot was of Kelvin and his wife sharing a bowl of Ramen noodles in all their post-coital glory. (Clooney is proof that people can look better as they get older!) Clooney also does a great job of doing that charming, soulful, caring, subtly sexy thing he does so well. He perfected it in the other Steven Soderbergh movie he starred in-the wonderfully subtle and sexy Out of Sight. In fact, the flashbacks in Solaris are very reminiscent of the hotel and love scenes between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight. There's a feeling of invading on someone's intimate moment and memory.  With all that, the movie was a colossal waste of time. Wait for it to come on television.

753249,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00009ATIX,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","""Solaris"" is a very good adaptation of the famous Stanislaw Lem novel by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. The film, while falling into the conventional genre of science fiction, is really more about human interactions and emotions: in other words, it's really a love story. Soderbergh is a very creative man, and I appreciated his approach to the subject matter: technology is ever-present in the film, but is never actually the subject of the film.George Clooney plays Dr. Chris Kelvin, a psychiatrist who is haunted by the death of Rheya, the one true love of his life. He is sent to a space station circling a planet-like object named Solaris to investigate strange happenings on the station and if possible to rescue the crew. What he finds are the remnants of a crew who are having severe emotional problems, and he soon discovers that the reason is the apparition of relatives and loved ones who are in some cases (like Rheya's) deceased and the accompanying mental and psychological duress these beings put the cast through. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is real and what is not, though subtle cues exist for the acutely aware, most notably the changes of color balance in the film between earth and the station and past and present. The film explores the nature of love and human relationships, and it is important to view Solaris as a character in the film, rather than a planet (it actually isn't a planet, it's a planet-like object with intelligence, as explained by James Cameron): Solaris is the antagonist, in essence. The course of the film skillfully takes the audience through the entire gamut of human emotions, but requires rapt attention to understand what's going on, particularly toward the end of the film.The cast did a fabulous job in the film: this is definitely the best acting I have ever seen Clooney do, but it is the supporting cast members who were most brilliant. Natascha McElhone as Rheya had the most difficult of the roles in the film requiring enormous emotional changes in exquisitely subtle increments. Jeremy Davies as demented crewman Snow likewise had a challenging role (particularly in the climactic scene) and gave a top-rate performance. The performance that was, to me, the most amazing was Viola Davis as Gordon, a crewmember whose role in the drama is unclear at first, but is revealed layer by emotional layer. Davis is simply amazing, and her performance alone is a more than valid reason for watching the film.The DVD features many extras including two behind the scenes features which are excellent. The interviews with the actors and crew are very insightful, and Soderbergh in particular is very enlightening. I recommend this film to people who want emotionally intense, cerebral science fiction. It is sometimes slow moving, but always intriguing.",4,"""Who Was Your Visitor?""",1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,2823,"['Solaris', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'famous', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'novel', 'always', 'interesting', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'film', 'falling', 'conventional', 'genre', 'science', 'fiction', 'really', 'more', 'human', 'interactions', 'emotions', 'other', 'words', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'Soderbergh', 'very', 'creative', 'man', 'appreciated', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'technology', 'ever-present', 'film', 'never', 'actually', 'subject', 'film.George', 'Clooney', 'Dr.', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'haunted', 'death', 'Rheya', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'life', 'sent', 'space', 'station', 'circling', 'planet-like', 'object', 'named', 'Solaris', 'investigate', 'strange', 'happenings', 'station', 'possible', 'rescue', 'crew', 'What', 'are', 'remnants', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'severe', 'emotional', 'problems', 'soon', 'reason', 'apparition', 'relatives', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'cases', 'Rheya', 'deceased', 'accompanying', 'mental', 'psychological', 'duress', 'beings', 'put', 'cast', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'subtle', 'cues', 'exist', 'acutely', 'aware', 'most', 'notably', 'changes', 'color', 'balance', 'film', 'earth', 'station', 'past', 'present', 'film', 'nature', 'love', 'human', 'relationships', 'important', 'view', 'Solaris', 'character', 'film', 'rather', 'planet', 'actually', ""n't"", 'planet', 'planet-like', 'object', 'intelligence', 'explained', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Solaris', 'antagonist', 'essence', 'course', 'film', 'skillfully', 'audience', 'entire', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotions', 'rapt', 'attention', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'particularly', 'end', 'film.The', 'cast', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'film', 'definitely', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Clooney', 'do', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'most', 'brilliant', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Rheya', 'had', 'most', 'difficult', 'roles', 'film', 'requiring', 'enormous', 'emotional', 'changes', 'exquisitely', 'subtle', 'increments', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'demented', 'crewman', 'Snow', 'likewise', 'had', 'challenging', 'role', 'particularly', 'climactic', 'scene', 'gave', 'top-rate', 'performance', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'amazing', 'was', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Gordon', 'crewmember', 'role', 'drama', 'unclear', 'first', 'revealed', 'layer', 'emotional', 'layer', 'Davis', 'simply', 'amazing', 'performance', 'alone', 'more', 'valid', 'reason', 'watching', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'many', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'scenes', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'interviews', 'actors', 'crew', 'are', 'very', 'insightful', 'Soderbergh', 'particular', 'very', 'enlightening', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'cerebral', 'science', 'fiction', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'moving', 'always', 'intriguing']",Solaris
753250,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00009ATIX,Robert Moore,"[6, 7]","This is the second film version of Stanislaw Lem's magnificent Sci-fi novel SOLARIS, which is, in my opinion, one of the half dozen greatest novels the genre has produced. What is perhaps as remarkable is that we now have two quite remarkable film versions of the novel. Andrei Tarkovsky, arguably the greatest Soviet director after Eisenstein, made a contemplative, magnificent version in 1972. Objectively, it is probably a stronger film than Soderbergh's new film starring George Clooney. Nonetheless, Soderbergh's version of the Lem novel is also first rate, and the mast of film goers will find it to be far more accessible than Tarkovsky's slower paced, more meditative version. I would like to stress, however, that neither, for me, comes up to the level of Lem's great novel. There are significant differences between both movies and the novel, almost all to the novel's benefit.George Clooney turns in one of his finest performances in this films, creating a character that has nothing in common with his previous roles. Instead of the infinitely confident, sex symbol we see in other films, he portrays a wounded, unhappy, prematurely aging soul. The sadness and loss and guilt he feels about his wife's suicide makes his unexpected reunion with her departed form all the more poignant. The story of their relationship, both past and in the very strange present, give this Sci-fi film an emotional complexity light years beyond anything else that Hollywood has created before. Some will find this disappointing, those who feel that Sci-fi should be about space ships, aliens, and good versus evil. Others, among whom I count myself, will find a highly intelligent Sci-fi film about the enormous complexity of human relationships and about what constitutes personhood to be stimulating and refreshing.Jeremy Davies is superb as Snow, one of the crew members. His slow, hesitating, reflective, and quirky replies to Clooney's many questions makes for many of the movies more enjoyable moments. Natascha McElhone is extremely fetching as Clooney's wife, and handles all the nuances of her character magnificently. The photography is first rate, Cliff Martinez's original soundtrack is so stunning that I would think about purchasing it (there is a Philip Glass feel to much of the music).There is one missing character in Soderbergh's film, or, at least missing in the manner in which it is portrayed in Lem's novel: Solaris itself. One of the glories of the novel is realizing the nature of the planet around which the space station revolves, and how it is self-aware and is attempting to communicate, albeit ineffectively and ambiguously, with those on the space station. This is a serious transformation, because it changes significantly the meaning of the story. The Soderbergh film becomes an attempt to recover the irrecoverable, while the Lem novel embraces both that and stresses on a deeper level the difficulty of communication.

Now, knowing that, you must also know that this is a terrific piece of moviemaking that deserves to be viewed by anyone with interest in cinema.Another thing you must know about this film is that, even if it's story takes place in space, it is more drama than science fiction. The basic premise of the movie has sci fi roots, but the story plays out more like drama and even suspense than a space/action flick.George Clooney plays Kelvin, a widower who is called by one of his friends to go to a spaceship orbiting the planet Solaris, because ""he's the only one who can figure out what's happening"". Once he arrives there, he finds a desolate ship, it's only surviving crew made up of creepy Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis). After his first night there, Kelvin experiences first hand what Solaris does to people, as his dead wife (Natascha McElhone) suddenly appears by his side. The rest of the film follows Kelvin as he tries to understand what's going on. Is this really his wife or is it something else? Is he dreaming or is this really happening?The pace of the movie is rather slow, and the acting is quite controlled (for lack of a better word). The sets are amazing, with a retro-futuristic look and some of the camera placements give very interesting takes. The special effects are very wisely used here. As stated before, this is not an action movie, but it is placed in space and there's plenty of takes of a few spaceships and of the planet itself (very nice looking, by the way).If there's another thing you should know is that the movie was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh, a man who was nominated for Best Director twice in the same year (Erin Brockovich and Traffic) and actually won one of them, and produced by James Cameron, the same guy who wrote, produced, directed and edited the highest grossing movie of all time, Titanic. This is a very interesting coupling, and I promise you the commentary track on the DVD is not to be missed.To conclude, this movie is a remake of the 1972 russian film (Solyaris) based on Stanislav Lem's book.",5,A great movie...but not for everybody,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,2139,"['Solaris', 'NOT', 'film', 'everybody', 'said', 'Now', 'knowing', 'must', 'also', 'know', 'terrific', 'piece', 'moviemaking', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'interest', 'cinema.Another', 'thing', 'must', 'know', 'film', 'even', 'story', 'place', 'space', 'more', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'sci', 'fi', 'roots', 'story', 'out', 'more', 'drama', 'even', 'suspense', 'space/action', 'flick.George', 'Clooney', 'Kelvin', 'widower', 'who', 'called', 'one', 'friends', 'go', 'spaceship', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'there', 'desolate', 'ship', 'only', 'surviving', 'crew', 'made', 'creepy', 'Snow', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'first', 'night', 'there', 'Kelvin', 'first', 'hand', 'what', 'Solaris', 'people', 'dead', 'wife', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'suddenly', 'side', 'rest', 'film', 'Kelvin', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'really', 'wife', 'something', 'else', 'dreaming', 'really', 'happening', 'pace', 'movie', 'rather', 'slow', 'acting', 'quite', 'controlled', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'retro-futuristic', 'look', 'camera', 'placements', 'give', 'very', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'wisely', 'used', 'here', 'stated', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'placed', 'space', 'plenty', 'few', 'spaceships', 'planet', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'way', '.If', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'twice', 'same', 'year', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Traffic', 'actually', 'won', 'one', 'produced', 'James', 'Cameron', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'edited', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', 'time', 'Titanic', 'very', 'interesting', 'coupling', 'promise', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'not', 'be', 'missed.To', 'conclude', 'movie', 'remake', '1972', 'russian', 'film', 'Solyaris', 'based', 'Stanislav', 'Lem', 'book']",Solaris
753252,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00009ATIX,Roland E. Zwick,"[116, 134]","Since nobody had the wherewithal or wisdom to re-release ""2001"" in the actual year 2001, a remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's comparable ""Solaris"" in 2002 would seem the next best thing.  Like those two earlier films, Steven Soderbergh's latest work is something of an ""art"" science fiction film, far more concerned with philosophy and theme than with action and suspense.  This may make the film a tough slog for modern day audiences who have been conditioned to be jolted out of their seats every five minutes while watching films of this genre.  But for the deeper thinkers among us, ""Solaris"" offers a fairly intriguing sci-fi vision of the afterlife, a sort of new religious paradigm for the twenty-first century.George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a successful psychiatrist whose mentally ill wife - ironically enough, given his profession  - killed herself a few years back.  Chris is commissioned to travel to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris after strange things begin happening to the crew aboard the ship.  It turns out that dead loved ones have started appearing to the people there, leading a number of the crewmembers to descend into madness and, in the worst cases, even commit suicide.  It's not long before Chris' own dead wife, Rheya, arrives on the scene, prompting him to question whether she is real, a replica created for an unknown reason by the forces of the mysterious planet, or merely a figment of his own troubled conscience and imagination.  The film taps into that desire we all have of somehow being miraculously reunited with a deceased love one.  We can't help but be moved by Chris' intense desire to believe that all that is happening is real and that life with this person could indeed start back up where it left off.  Clooney does a beautiful job conveying the inner struggle between the grieving husband who wants to reconnect emotionally with this strangely familiar woman whom he had thought forever lost to him and the rationalistic scientist who suspects that both she and their relationship are illusory and ephemeral.  The film itself may be glacially paced, but the tension created by the situation pulls us through.  Natascha McElhone brings an ethereal beauty to the role of the dead wife, and we are moved by her own confusion as to whether she is really this woman Rheya or merely some fabrication usurping the memories and feelings of someone long gone from the scene.  Clooney and McElhone generate a strong romantic chemistry between them, both in the scenes aboard the ship and in the manifold flashbacks the storytellers use to reveal their relationship back on Earth.  Viola Davis gives an intense performance as Helen Gordon, the rationalist of the group who tries to convince Chris that he must overcome his feelings and destroy this facsimile of Rheya or risk bringing potential destruction to the people back home.""Solaris"" has been shot in the widest screen ratio I have seen in years.  It almost feels like one of those old Cinerama pictures from the 1950's and 1960's, which is surprising actually, given the fact that, for all its outer space trappings, the film is really an intimate, personal drama in quality and scale (if you rent this on video, do NOT opt for the ""full screen"" treatment; rather, make sure it is in the letterboxed format).  Also, the set design and special effects are actually rather understated for a modern science fiction film - as is everything about ""Solaris"" in fact.  Like ""2001,"" ""Solaris"" is filled with images and concepts whose significance and meaning aren't always readily apparent or easily spelled out for the audience.  Just be forewarned that the film is more along the lines of a tone poem than a rip-roaring action adventure tale.""Solaris"" isn't a great film and I can certainly see why many people, expecting something different, might find themselves becoming restive and bored by it.  For me, the film managed to seep under my skin and kept me interested most of the time.  This is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but for those with patience and an appreciation for something a little different, ""Solaris"" has its share of rewards.",3,Intriguing mood piece,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,4154,"['nobody', 'had', 'wherewithal', 'wisdom', 're-release', '2001', 'actual', 'year', '2001', 'remake', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'comparable', 'Solaris', '2002', 'would', 'seem', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'two', 'earlier', 'films', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'latest', 'work', 'something', 'art', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'philosophy', 'theme', 'action', 'suspense', 'may', 'make', 'film', 'tough', 'slog', 'modern', 'day', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'conditioned', 'be', 'jolted', 'seats', 'five', 'minutes', 'watching', 'films', 'genre', 'deeper', 'thinkers', 'Solaris', 'fairly', 'intriguing', 'sci-fi', 'vision', 'afterlife', 'sort', 'new', 'religious', 'paradigm', 'twenty-first', 'century.George', 'Clooney', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'successful', 'psychiatrist', 'mentally', 'ill', 'wife', 'ironically', 'enough', 'given', 'profession', 'killed', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Chris', 'commissioned', 'travel', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happening', 'crew', 'ship', 'out', 'dead', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'started', 'appearing', 'people', 'there', 'leading', 'number', 'crewmembers', 'descend', 'madness', 'worst', 'cases', 'even', 'commit', 'suicide', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Chris', 'own', 'dead', 'wife', 'Rheya', 'scene', 'prompting', 'question', 'real', 'replica', 'created', 'unknown', 'reason', 'forces', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'merely', 'figment', 'own', 'troubled', 'conscience', 'imagination', 'film', 'desire', 'have', 'somehow', 'being', 'miraculously', 'reunited', 'deceased', 'love', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'Chris', 'intense', 'desire', 'believe', 'happening', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'could', 'indeed', 'start', 'back', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Clooney', 'beautiful', 'job', 'conveying', 'inner', 'struggle', 'grieving', 'husband', 'who', 'reconnect', 'emotionally', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'woman', 'whom', 'had', 'thought', 'forever', 'lost', 'rationalistic', 'scientist', 'who', 'relationship', 'are', 'illusory', 'ephemeral', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'glacially', 'paced', 'tension', 'created', 'situation', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'role', 'dead', 'wife', 'are', 'moved', 'own', 'confusion', 'really', 'woman', 'Rheya', 'merely', 'fabrication', 'usurping', 'memories', 'feelings', 'someone', 'long', 'gone', 'scene', 'Clooney', 'McElhone', 'generate', 'strong', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'ship', 'manifold', 'storytellers', 'use', 'reveal', 'relationship', 'back', 'Earth', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'intense', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Gordon', 'rationalist', 'group', 'who', 'convince', 'Chris', 'must', 'overcome', 'feelings', 'destroy', 'facsimile', 'Rheya', 'risk', 'bringing', 'potential', 'destruction', 'people', 'back', 'home', 'Solaris', 'been', 'shot', 'widest', 'screen', 'ratio', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'almost', 'feels', 'one', 'old', 'Cinerama', '1950', '1960', 'surprising', 'actually', 'given', 'fact', 'outer', 'space', 'trappings', 'film', 'really', 'intimate', 'personal', 'drama', 'quality', 'scale', 'rent', 'video', 'do', 'NOT', 'opt', 'full', 'screen', 'treatment', 'rather', 'make', 'sure', 'letterboxed', 'format', 'Also', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'understated', 'modern', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'everything', 'Solaris', 'fact', '2001', 'Solaris', 'filled', 'images', 'concepts', 'significance', 'meaning', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'readily', 'apparent', 'easily', 'spelled', 'out', 'audience', 'Just', 'be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'more', 'lines', 'tone', 'poem', 'rip-roaring', 'action', 'adventure', 'tale', 'Solaris', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'people', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'might', 'find', 'becoming', 'restive', 'bored', 'film', 'managed', 'seep', 'skin', 'kept', 'interested', 'most', 'time', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'patience', 'appreciation', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'Solaris', 'share', 'rewards']",Solaris

This film addresses questions of human consciousness much as did Stanley Kubrick's &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34;, but with the emphasis, not on machine &#34;intelligence&#34; or human evolution, but on the personal psychological meaning of survival, purpose and love. All performances are top rate, especially that of the strangely beautiful Ms. McElhone who must (and does) convey the circumstances and plight of at least three distinct characters with three very different personalities. Casting all around is impeccable. Storywise--references to a God &#34;the Creator&#34; and the immortality of the Human Spirit are so subtle that if you reach for the popcorn you might miss them. Story-telling by intercutting &#34;real time&#34; drama with stream-of-consciousness flashback memories and present imaginings is innovative and excellent. Of course, the elephant in the room is Solaris--a planet? a conscious entity? an expression of the subconscious? It's for the viewer to speculate. There is, in fact, a resolution--and it's one heavily weighted with compassion, understanding and an unexpected benevolence. Caution-- this film is mostly for the cerebral (and certainly for fans of Natascha).

Nelson,"[1, 5]","It's all right to have sci-fi movies that aren't ""shoot 'em up blast the aliens"" flicks, so the leisurely unrolling of this movie didn't bother me.  What was irksome was the idiotic behavior of George Clooney's character, Kelvin.  He plays a shrink sent to a space station to investigate what a friend of his there said were things he couldn't describe.  The question is: why not?This is spoiler territory coming up.  Some alien presence, or the planet itself, is replicating people out of the space station's crew's memories.  When the initial call for help went out, why didn't the commander simply present the ""visitor"" he had and say, ""Look, I left this person behind on earth months or trillions of miles ago, and here he is standing right next to me.""  Further, why would these replicants cause insanity in the crew?  Genuine puzzlement and fear, certainly.  But lunacy?The owner of the space station sent out a security team to the station, which was never heard from again.  Why?  The movie never refers to it again, except once in passing.  Did they die, go crazy and crash into the strange planet below, what?And the star, Kelvin, who is initially shocked to see his dead wife suddenly beside him there in the middle of nowhere, gradually comes to accept her presence and even to fall in love with her.  Did he fall off his rocker and bang his head on a spaceship tailfin?  He knows his wife is dead, surmises that this creature near him is some sort of alien concoction, and then defends her and wishes to return to earth with her.  Gordon, the physicist and the only person who makes any sense in this movie, is dead set against that, for understandable reasons.There's an underlying theme of forgiveness and second chances running here.  The creations themselves realize that they're not the originals, and yet they are true copies of the crew's memories.  They're also indestructible, or rather self-healingly immortal, which poses an apparent problem at the end.  But the alien force evidently takes this into consideration and, well, shall we say that love conquers all?  That even an incomprehensible force wishes to aid humans?  I wonder if an eternity with no escape will be as satisfying to the couple in question as the two think it will be.This is really a two star movie, but I gave it three for its high-value production and for attempting something a little out of the ordinary.  There are elements of Moon and Event Horizon here, but the movie does try to be a different kind of smoke.

Kelvin discovers a room of dead bodies and the planet's powerful relationship with the remaining crew, a skittish, tic-filled technogeek (Jeremy Davies) and a stern, scared-alive captain (Viola Davis).His first night he is visited by his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone); the planet, it seems, culls memories from its human subjects and presents them, in the flesh, slightly altered. Just how is for you to discover, but those alterations tear the initially grateful Kelvin in two directions. Hashing out those inner demons accounts for much of the picture. &quot;Solaris&quot; reveals an intriguing reality about the tenets and boundaries of memory, but it, like the rest of the movie, is an understatement to some mood Soderbergh never plugs us into.This is not Clooney's finest moment. Best when he's smooth and smirking, Clooney is called upon for anguish for his dead wife, and he can't produce anything more than a lilted voice and painful wincing. McElhone, if mysterious and stunning, is equally cold. Passions lacking, the main thrust of &quot;Solaris&quot; is lost, and the blue planet is nothing more than a special f/x outside the window.The movies erects a giant, pale edifice to art form of passing time, its camera tracking behind Clooney from empty room to empty room, no discernible goal awaiting, in between several long scenes of Davies affecting some mild version of Tourette's syndrome. Viola Davis, for her part, is very good, suggesting a gathering, palpable threat that never comes to head. Soderbergh holds his cards close as if to deliver a late-in-the-game salvo that substantiates the buildup; what he does deliver is an incoherent &quot;transformation&quot; sequence that cannot be entirely explained on first viewing. So it never will be.James Cameron produced the film, which makes sense: No other way is $60 million offered to such a repressed, calculated remake of Russian filmmaker Sergei Tarkovsky's 1972 film, widely hailed as a (very long) classic but no bowl of jelly itself. &quot;Solaris&quot; is product of three Hollywood heavyweights with limitless line of credit and artsy romantic leanings, and the end result is an abstract product that will fail the main litmus test for most viewers - is it entertaining? - and for the others who eat this material up, may they paint the town blue.",2,Intellectual but sterile - and boring.

But for someone who cannot stand another sci-fi movie dependent upon explosions and war-mongering aliens, with a cheesy romance thrown in for good measure, Solaris is like 2001: A Space Oddyssey is to Independence Day.I never got around to watching this film until recently. I've heard nothing but good things both about the book and the original film, and many mixed and polarizing opinions about this version. After viewing it, I think a lot of polarization comes from the fact that Solaris does not play to the typical American moviegoer. Without trying to be negative, the average American wants escapist filmmaking where explosions and mind-numbing plots provide emotional release from the high strung life typical in American society. Solaris is the antithesis to that in every way. Solaris requires effort from the viewer, it requires their undivided attention, and it requires them to piece the plot together, make sense of it, and draw conclusions about it. A lot of people would find this intimidating.The right viewer will see Solaris for what it is; a daring artistic film about humanity, what that means, and the ironies of choice and love. Almost every review of this film will give you plot details so I'm trying instead to explain why this film is so good and why only certain people see that. So very few films evoke the kinds of raw emotion Solaris draws from the viewer, and while the film requires a good deal of imagination, the story has a haunting beauty to it that surpasses the majority of sci-fi flicks ever made.In short, Solaris is the kind of ""high art"" that is missing from so many modern American films, and it's nice to see something so cerebrally challenging amongst a sea of brain dead films.",5,"Brilliant, emotional, artistic, somber, cerebral, challenging, Solaris.",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1834,"['movie', 'will', 'not', 'resonate', 'average', 'person', 'just', 'too', 'strange', 'too', 'slowly', 'paced', 'too', 'artsy', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'dependent', 'explosions', 'war-mongering', 'aliens', 'cheesy', 'romance', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Solaris', '2001', 'Space', 'Oddyssey', 'Independence', 'Day.I', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'film', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'book', 'original', 'film', 'many', 'mixed', 'polarizing', 'opinions', 'version', 'viewing', 'think', 'lot', 'polarization', 'fact', 'Solaris', 'not', 'play', 'typical', 'American', 'moviegoer', 'trying', 'be', 'negative', 'average', 'American', 'escapist', 'filmmaking', 'where', 'explosions', 'mind-numbing', 'plots', 'provide', 'emotional', 'release', 'high', 'strung', 'life', 'typical', 'American', 'society', 'Solaris', 'antithesis', 'way', 'Solaris', 'effort', 'viewer', 'undivided', 'attention', 'piece', 'plot', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'intimidating.The', 'right', 'viewer', 'will', 'see', 'Solaris', 'what', 'daring', 'artistic', 'film', 'humanity', 'what', 'ironies', 'choice', 'love', 'review', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'plot', 'details', 'so', ""'m"", 'trying', 'instead', 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'why', 'only', 'certain', 'people', 'see', 'So', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'evoke', 'kinds', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Solaris', 'viewer', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'imagination', 'story', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'majority', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'ever', 'made.In', 'short', 'Solaris', 'kind', 'high', 'art', 'missing', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'American', 'films', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'so', 'cerebrally', 'challenging', 'amongst', 'sea', 'brain', 'dead', 'films']",Solaris

The first thing he sees upon entering the ship is a puddle of blood, an omen of things to come. He will soon realize that there is something very, very wrong about this ship and its crew.It seems that the ship has the ability of making you experience some memories of the past you hold dear. In Clooney's case, he becomes haunted by his deceased wife. When she comes back to the ship, without knowing what has happened to her, Clooney's love for the woman resurfaces. Soon, he is trapped in a psychological game of poker, where every single one of this opponents are invisible entities that might or might not want to harm him. What do these ghosts want?

753262,A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,B00009ATIX,Solid Snake,"[2, 2]","S. Soderbergh's Solaris can barely be called an adaptation of S. Lem's novel, nor can it accurately be called a remake of the 1972 Russian film. However, when viewed without prejudice it is a fantastic film stylistically, as well as in terms of story and character development.Soderbergh ignores the technical and scientific aspects of Lem's novel and focuses on the human story instead. From the books limited material on the subject he extrapolates the tumultuous love story at the heart of his film. Unfortunately, that means that 'liquid metal' oceans of the novel are left out as well.In this film the planet Solaris itself plays second fiddle to Clooney's space-faring psychologist, and the question of the planet's possible sentience is overshadowed by the question of what it actually means to be human. The material is still absorbing and adeptly handled, but this reflects Sodenbergh's philosophies, and not necessarily Lem's.The film pays homage to Kubrick's 2001 by painstakingly recreating his style (some critics may prefer the term plagiarized) including the pervasive atmospheric soundtrack and long periods of silence. This film will not please Sci-Fi action seekers, nor will it please those looking for a faithful adaptation of Lem's text. I'm a huge fan of the book and Solaris is one of my favorite films, so it is possible to enjoy both in their own right.DVD comes with making-of featurettes and can be played in both widescreen and fullscreen modes.

A nebula like planet dubbed Solaris does this to everyone in its proximity, driving many of them to suicide or insanity. Many of the reveals past this basic explanation are spoilers, which I don't want to get into here.Top to bottom, one of the better movies of the last ten years or so, Solaris features top shelf acting, cinematography, directing, and a glue-like sound scheme that solidifies the focus of this ""sci-fi"" film set in the near future. To be frank, Solaris could be set in modern day at one of the 94 million Starbucks locations in America, and the message would be the same. The setting is merely a distant backdrop for a story that intentionally asks more questions than it answers. As it explains itself, the issues it deals with are simply too much to answer, the key is to stop looking for them and realize that frustration, uncertainty and pain are just as much a part of life as pleasure, closure and love. At issue among other things, are whether not we can be betrayed by our memories. Yes we can, at least in this film where they take physical form. and remove the ability for the protagonist to shelter himself from the truth. The ""Villain here"" is psychological, taking away the one form of security everyone on earth uses to preserve their sanity. He takes away their ability to lie to themselves. Definitely a universal theme, who of us isn't victim of nostalgia at some point? As a result, with the enemies of each space station crew member being a ghost from their past, the un killable character element here actually has quite a bit of weight to it. After all, the enemies are memories at first, then, doubt and confusion. This movie accurately posits that emotions have much more power than physical demons, or psychologists all around the world would be looking for new clients after each session.In his best performance to date , George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a man who has lost his girlfriend Raya to tragic circumstances and can't seem to recuperate. In the 15 minutes used to set up the relationship these two shared, there is more depth and connection created by director Steve Sorderbergh than the entirety of most Romantic movies. IT also carries much more weight and realistic humor, matching two characters with equal intellect for their conversations. Natascha McElhone matches Clooney both in the very realistic state of flashbacks, and oddly, the dreamlike state of present day action most of the story takes place in. Patient and deliberate, but never boring, the pacing here is perfect for the material and characters. There is no room for a large ensemble cast in a story about intimacy, thus the isolation of the space station serves well to justify the low cast population. When his friend and fellow scientist Gibarean asks Kelvin to join him on the space station to try and understand the large number of deaths, Kelvin understandably accepts. His lack of attachment to anything since he Lost Raya leaves him no reason not to, especially if it offers a chance at reuniting with an old friend.Sorderbergh here, not surprisingly, excels at a movie that despite its large scope seems to be more in tune with his skills, character development and well framed dialogue. Set up shots are not always the wide angle sort as would usually be approached in sci-fi movies, but often left to more grounding ones like rainfall and other more relatable sights. Any alien feel inherent in many genre movies is dissolved. What few supporting characters are present are allowed room to breathe and create their own identities. Even more impressive is the believability with which all of their dialogue is delivered. It may be a sign of decaying movie talent, but the consistency of ""voice"" is flawless even in the midst of discussing pretty high end concepts, from abortion to depression to God itself. It's a relief, and as a result, none of it feels condescending, if anything we feel for characters so intellectual and likeable who are unable to get past major hurdles in their shared and separate lives.Sound design carries the mood of this movie, almost as much as the direction and great set design. Dialogue carries shots into each other, music is always appropriate, and the moments of real intensity are balanced perfectly.original review at ess-bee.com",5,Great remake,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,4463,"['Perception', 'reality', 'man', 'face', 'face', 'not', 'dead', 'ex', 'lover', 'memories', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'complete', 'would', 'like', 'nebula', 'planet', 'dubbed', 'Solaris', 'everyone', 'proximity', 'driving', 'many', 'suicide', 'insanity', 'Many', 'reveals', 'basic', 'explanation', 'are', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'here.Top', 'bottom', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'Solaris', 'top', 'shelf', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'glue-like', 'sound', 'scheme', 'focus', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'be', 'frank', 'Solaris', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'one', '94', 'million', 'Starbucks', 'locations', 'America', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'setting', 'merely', 'distant', 'backdrop', 'story', 'intentionally', 'more', 'questions', 'issues', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'answer', 'key', 'stop', 'looking', 'realize', 'frustration', 'uncertainty', 'pain', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'life', 'pleasure', 'closure', 'love', 'issue', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'can', 'be', 'betrayed', 'memories', 'can', 'least', 'film', 'where', 'take', 'physical', 'form', 'remove', 'ability', 'protagonist', 'shelter', 'truth', 'Villain', 'here', 'psychological', 'taking', 'away', 'one', 'form', 'security', 'everyone', 'earth', 'uses', 'preserve', 'sanity', 'away', 'ability', 'lie', 'Definitely', 'universal', 'theme', 'who', ""n't"", 'victim', 'nostalgia', 'point', 'result', 'enemies', 'space', 'station', 'crew', 'member', 'being', 'ghost', 'past', 'un', 'killable', 'character', 'element', 'here', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'weight', 'enemies', 'are', 'memories', 'first', 'then', 'doubt', 'confusion', 'movie', 'accurately', 'emotions', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'power', 'physical', 'demons', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'new', 'clients', 'session.In', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'Raya', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'recuperate', '15', 'minutes', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'relationship', 'two', 'shared', 'more', 'depth', 'connection', 'created', 'director', 'Steve', 'Sorderbergh', 'entirety', 'most', 'Romantic', 'movies', 'IT', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'weight', 'realistic', 'humor', 'matching', 'two', 'characters', 'equal', 'intellect', 'conversations', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Clooney', 'very', 'realistic', 'state', 'flashbacks', 'oddly', 'dreamlike', 'state', 'present', 'day', 'action', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'Patient', 'deliberate', 'never', 'boring', 'pacing', 'here', 'perfect', 'material', 'characters', 'room', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'story', 'intimacy', 'thus', 'isolation', 'space', 'station', 'well', 'justify', 'low', 'cast', 'population', 'When', 'friend', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'Gibarean', 'Kelvin', 'join', 'space', 'station', 'try', 'understand', 'large', 'number', 'deaths', 'Kelvin', 'understandably', 'lack', 'attachment', 'anything', 'Lost', 'Raya', 'reason', 'not', 'especially', 'chance', 'reuniting', 'old', 'friend.Sorderbergh', 'here', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'excels', 'movie', 'large', 'scope', 'be', 'more', 'tune', 'skills', 'character', 'development', 'well', 'framed', 'dialogue', 'Set', 'up', 'shots', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'wide', 'angle', 'sort', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'approached', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'often', 'left', 'more', 'grounding', 'ones', 'rainfall', 'other', 'more', 'relatable', 'sights', 'alien', 'feel', 'inherent', 'many', 'genre', 'movies', 'dissolved', 'What', 'few', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'present', 'are', 'allowed', 'room', 'breathe', 'create', 'own', 'identities', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'believability', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'may', 'be', 'sign', 'decaying', 'movie', 'talent', 'consistency', 'voice', 'flawless', 'even', 'midst', 'discussing', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'concepts', 'abortion', 'depression', 'God', 'relief', 'result', 'none', 'condescending', 'anything', 'feel', 'characters', 'so', 'intellectual', 'likeable', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'past', 'major', 'hurdles', 'shared', 'separate', 'lives.Sound', 'design', 'mood', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'direction', 'great', 'set', 'design', 'Dialogue', 'shots', 'other', 'music', 'always', 'appropriate', 'moments', 'real', 'intensity', 'are', 'balanced', 'perfectly.original', 'review', 'ess-bee.com']",Solaris

Too many films seem to want to rush me to some place before I have had a chance to really engage with the visions, sounds, words, music and ideas inside the film. Solaris did give me a bit of breathing space in this respect.It is a very handsome film and the special effects, although modest in comparison to some recent science fiction films, are effective.In some respects this film is really a fantasy rather than a science fiction - it deals with a very strange ""what if?"" and this question is not about technology, society or man's relationship with his artefacts and machines. It also looks at some psychological reactions.I was only disappointed by the fact that we were give so little information about the apparently sentient planet, Solaris. Surely, the people would have gained some information about this strange object?The quiet, ambient music composed for this film was particularly good and I wholeheartedly recommend the soundtrack.

753266,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00009ATIX,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 3]","You have to applaud George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh's Section Eight production company for bringing mainstream budgets, talent and production values to non-mainstream films like this one. 'Insomnia' was a hit, and with a few Oscar nominations 'Far From Heaven' should be, too. But they're also going to get their fair share of boxoffice misses like 'Solaris'. It's a difficult game they're playing because mainstream budgets, talent and production values tend to attract audiences with mainstream expectations. Such audiences are unlikely to be satisfied with a film about God, morality and memory; a film which toys with our yearning for answers, but then doesn't really give us any. Soderbergh's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's novel is admirably concise, but it may irritate those who are unwilling to make the inferences it requires or unable to cope with ambiguity. The production design is beautiful, the music apt, and the performances are excellent - with the exception of Jeremy Davies who gives an immensely irritating portrayal of Snow. What I find most engaging about 'Solaris' is that it returns us to the philosophical/emotional core which has been absent from so many sci-fi movies since '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Soderbergh might have fiddled with the ending of Lem's novel, but he hasn't avoided the moral issues and uncertainties the story provokes. And yet for all that, 'Solaris' still deploys most of the genre cliches we've seen in everything from 'Alien' to 'Event Horizon': the deep space rescue mission; the seemingly-abandoned spacecraft; the alien threat; the enemy amongst us; even the ultimate decision to abandon ship. That it can work within that tired framework, and still deliver something fresh and compelling, is a credit to the cast and crew. Perhaps sci-fi is headed back in the right direction: a genre of moral speculation, not just of digital imagery.",3,Section Eight to the rescue,1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,1893,"['have', 'applaud', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Section', 'Eight', 'production', 'company', 'bringing', 'mainstream', 'budgets', 'talent', 'production', 'values', 'non-mainstream', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'hit', 'few', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Heaven', 'should', 'be', 'too', ""'re"", 'also', 'going', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'boxoffice', 'misses', ""'Solaris"", 'difficult', 'game', ""'re"", 'playing', 'mainstream', 'budgets', 'talent', 'production', 'values', 'tend', 'attract', 'audiences', 'mainstream', 'expectations', 'Such', 'audiences', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'satisfied', 'film', 'God', 'morality', 'memory', 'film', 'yearning', 'answers', 'then', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'Soderbergh', 'adaptation', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'novel', 'admirably', 'concise', 'may', 'irritate', 'who', 'are', 'unwilling', 'make', 'inferences', 'unable', 'cope', 'ambiguity', 'production', 'design', 'beautiful', 'music', 'apt', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'exception', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'immensely', 'irritating', 'portrayal', 'Snow', 'What', 'find', 'most', 'engaging', ""'Solaris"", 'philosophical/emotional', 'core', 'been', 'absent', 'so', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'movies', ""'2001"", 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Soderbergh', 'might', 'have', 'fiddled', 'ending', 'Lem', 'novel', ""n't"", 'avoided', 'moral', 'issues', 'story', 'provokes', 'yet', 'still', 'most', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'everything', ""'Alien"", ""'Event"", 'Horizon', 'deep', 'space', 'rescue', 'mission', 'seemingly-abandoned', 'spacecraft', 'alien', 'threat', 'enemy', 'even', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'abandon', 'ship', 'can', 'work', 'tired', 'framework', 'still', 'deliver', 'something', 'fresh', 'compelling', 'credit', 'cast', 'crew', 'Perhaps', 'sci-fi', 'headed', 'back', 'right', 'direction', 'genre', 'moral', 'speculation', 'not', 'just', 'digital', 'imagery']",Solaris

753269,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00009ATIX,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 6]","I can recall seeing Solaris (2002 version) about a year after it came out on home video. The movie appeared interesting and it seemed like a different type of film for George Clooney.  I had no real expectations for the movie, I do remembering I rented this movie several days after I broke up with a girlfriend.  This might have added to my fondness for the film.Solaris is a very much a film of atmosphere, it is quite, mellow, dark, dreamy, devoted and has flares of intense energy.  It sounds like it might be action pack, yet it really isn't.  As a matter of fact, this movie is rather slow and takes awhile for the plot to reveal itself.  I never found that to be a problem, while other viewers might.  The lush colors painted in outer space and wonderful ambient soundtrack by Cliff Martinez (one of the best pieces of ambient music, I ordered the soundtrack as soon as the movie was over) was paramount in my viewing of this film.  The soundtrack along with the images makes this movie a vision of beautiful tapestry.It wasn't until after I watch Solaris (2002) that I realized this film was a remake of a Russian film.  I did seek the original and have to say that in juxtaposition, both movies are very different.  The original (also called Solaris made in 1972) is very philosophical and focuses more humankind, where the remake is also philosophical, not as much as the 1972 version, but really focuses on a romance storyline.  I have to be honest I feel many romance centered plots are cheesy and/or insipid.  Nevertheless, I found the romance storyline in Solaris to be absolutely divine.I also felt this was a strong performance for George Clooney and it seemed like it was a role that he hadn't tackled at that point in his career.  I also felt Natascha McElhnoe was hypnotic in this film.  There were times she appeared malicious and others where she was figurehead of love.  Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies also provide some wonderful acting jobs in this movie.  I give Steven Soderbergh credit, he was brave enough to allow music, atmosphere, editing and set design play a huge part in this movie.  This can be a difficult ruse to pull off and I feel he did a fine job.There is a fair amount of people who feel that this version is inferior to the original.  Perhaps if I had seen the 1972 version first I might share that opinion.  However, I feel this remake can stand on its own two feet.  I don't think Steven Soderbergh was trying to recreate the original, just add some new texture to it.  It was interesting to see a Russian version and an American version of the same film.  That would be a wonderful social sciences endeavor.  For instance, in the American version all of the actors/actresses are very attractive where in the Russian version they are more ""average"" looking.Overall for a ""Hollywood-ized"" remake of a classic sci-fi film, I found Solaris to be a great film and a deviation from the standard Hollywood movie i.e. flat characters, tons of CGI, shoddy editing, pointless plot and poor directing.  I can totally understand if Solaris isn't taken in by everyone.  It is slow and is really more of subdued romance disguised as a sci-fi movie.  I can also see how people who love the 1972 version might find this remake as heresy.  Consequently, I enjoyed and own both versions of Solaris and recommend them as wonderful and intelligent pieces of cinema.",5,A subdued romance disguised as a sci-fi movie,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,3389,"['can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'Solaris', '2002', 'version', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'home', 'video', 'movie', 'appeared', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'George', 'Clooney', 'had', 'real', 'expectations', 'movie', 'do', 'remembering', 'rented', 'movie', 'several', 'days', 'broke', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'fondness', 'film.Solaris', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'mellow', 'dark', 'dreamy', 'devoted', 'flares', 'intense', 'energy', 'might', 'be', 'action', 'pack', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'fact', 'movie', 'rather', 'slow', 'awhile', 'plot', 'reveal', 'never', 'found', 'be', 'problem', 'other', 'viewers', 'might', 'lush', 'colors', 'painted', 'outer', 'space', 'wonderful', 'ambient', 'soundtrack', 'Cliff', 'Martinez', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'ambient', 'music', 'ordered', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'paramount', 'viewing', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'images', 'movie', 'vision', 'beautiful', 'tapestry.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Solaris', '2002', 'realized', 'film', 'was', 'remake', 'Russian', 'film', 'did', 'seek', 'original', 'have', 'say', 'juxtaposition', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'original', 'also', 'called', 'Solaris', 'made', '1972', 'very', 'philosophical', 'more', 'humankind', 'where', 'remake', 'also', 'philosophical', 'not', 'as', 'much', '1972', 'version', 'really', 'romance', 'storyline', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'feel', 'many', 'romance', 'centered', 'plots', 'are', 'cheesy', 'and/or', 'insipid', 'Nevertheless', 'found', 'romance', 'storyline', 'Solaris', 'be', 'absolutely', 'divine.I', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'strong', 'performance', 'George', 'Clooney', 'seemed', 'was', 'role', 'had', ""n't"", 'tackled', 'point', 'career', 'also', 'felt', 'Natascha', 'McElhnoe', 'was', 'hypnotic', 'film', 'were', 'times', 'appeared', 'malicious', 'others', 'where', 'was', 'figurehead', 'love', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'also', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'jobs', 'movie', 'give', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'credit', 'was', 'brave', 'enough', 'allow', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'editing', 'set', 'design', 'huge', 'part', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'ruse', 'pull', 'off', 'feel', 'did', 'fine', 'job.There', 'fair', 'amount', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'version', 'inferior', 'original', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'seen', '1972', 'version', 'first', 'might', 'share', 'opinion', 'However', 'feel', 'remake', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'trying', 'recreate', 'original', 'just', 'add', 'new', 'texture', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Russian', 'version', 'American', 'version', 'same', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'social', 'sciences', 'endeavor', 'instance', 'American', 'version', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'where', 'Russian', 'version', 'are', 'more', 'average', 'looking.Overall', 'Hollywood-ized', 'remake', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'found', 'Solaris', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'deviation', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'i.e', 'flat', 'characters', 'tons', 'CGI', 'shoddy', 'editing', 'pointless', 'plot', 'poor', 'directing', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'Solaris', ""n't"", 'taken', 'everyone', 'slow', 'really', 'more', 'subdued', 'romance', 'disguised', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'love', '1972', 'version', 'might', 'find', 'remake', 'heresy', 'Consequently', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'versions', 'Solaris', 'recommend', 'wonderful', 'intelligent', 'pieces', 'cinema']",Solaris

He goes to Solaris, a space station, to find out why the crew has been out of communication.  When he arrives, he quickly succumbs to the seduction of the Solaris system...and we spend the rest of the story agonizing with Clooney over whether what once was might--even if in shadows--can be recaptured.This might have been a great story, an intriguing novel...but on film, it came across as a dark, milingering attempt at visual poetry-science fiction.

753274,A2JA7C0WEMB1M7,B00009ATIX,"Virgil ""Virgil""","[2, 2]","Be prepared to be patient while watching Solaris. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem it's influenced heavily by the atmospheric Russian version directed by the great Andrei Tarkovsky [one of the great directors of Russian cinema], Solaris is by Hollywood standards very introspective and slowly paced.The basic storyline is that a space station has basically stopped functioning and its crew has gone mad.  A psychologist [`Chris Kelvin played by George Clooney] requested by the crew's commander is sent out to the remote planet to investigate the matter.  At this point many readers may be thinking `Aliens' or something along similar lines, but thankfully this isn't so. The `monster' if there is one, is one's own psyche from where the Planet Solaris [whose vast ocean is a life form of sorts- not really delved into in this version] creates real life copies.What Kelvin discovers is a ship who's crew has been driven to insanity by the real life constructions of people from their past.  What if a loved one, now long dead, re-appeared in the flesh in your own life?  For some in the crew this is just far too much to bear.  Kelvin himself succumbs as his wife [or a `copy' of her], who committed suicide years before, appears in real life form dazed and confused by what's happened.  His reaction to her, his fear and guilt, are the heart of the film.While the novel and the Russian film are more philosophical, Director Steven Soderberg's Solaris is more a love story with philosophical connotations.  Guilt, regret, confusion and fear play havoc with Kelvin and the crew.  In the end the psychologist succumbs to his psyche while the crew's physicist shed's any link with her own constructs.Solaris doesn't quite rise to the level of artistry as Tarkovsky's version and it eschews  most the scientific and philosophical aspects of Lem's novel [and unfortunately an interesting sub-plot on the history of the discovery of Solaris].  Judged on its own terms and relative to what's being released by Hollywood today, Solaris is a very adult film that delves into the human psyche quite well.  On those terms I think it's a success.",4,A flawed but rewarding version of Solaris,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,2137,"['Be', 'prepared', 'be', 'patient', 'watching', 'Solaris', 'Based', 'novel', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'influenced', 'heavily', 'atmospheric', 'Russian', 'version', 'directed', 'great', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', '[', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'Russian', 'cinema', ']', 'Solaris', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'very', 'introspective', 'slowly', 'paced.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'space', 'station', 'basically', 'stopped', 'functioning', 'crew', 'gone', 'mad', 'psychologist', '[', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', ']', 'requested', 'crew', 'commander', 'sent', 'remote', 'planet', 'investigate', 'matter', 'point', 'many', 'readers', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'Aliens', 'something', 'similar', 'lines', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'so', 'monster', 'one', 'one', 'own', 'psyche', 'where', 'Planet', 'Solaris', '[', 'vast', 'ocean', 'life', 'form', 'sorts-', 'not', 'really', 'delved', 'version', ']', 'real', 'life', 'copies.What', 'Kelvin', 'ship', 'who', 'crew', 'been', 'driven', 'insanity', 'real', 'life', 'constructions', 'people', 'past', 'What', 'loved', 'one', 'now', 'long', 'dead', 're-appeared', 'flesh', 'own', 'life', 'crew', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'Kelvin', 'succumbs', 'wife', '[', 'copy', ']', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'years', 'real', 'life', 'form', 'dazed', 'confused', 'what', 'happened', 'reaction', 'fear', 'guilt', 'are', 'heart', 'film.While', 'novel', 'Russian', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'philosophical', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'Solaris', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'philosophical', 'connotations', 'Guilt', 'regret', 'confusion', 'fear', 'play', 'havoc', 'Kelvin', 'crew', 'end', 'psychologist', 'succumbs', 'psyche', 'crew', 'physicist', 'shed', 'link', 'own', 'constructs.Solaris', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rise', 'level', 'artistry', 'Tarkovsky', 'version', 'most', 'scientific', 'philosophical', 'aspects', 'Lem', 'novel', '[', 'unfortunately', 'interesting', 'sub-plot', 'history', 'discovery', 'Solaris', ']', 'Judged', 'own', 'terms', 'relative', 'what', 'being', 'released', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Solaris', 'very', 'adult', 'film', 'human', 'psyche', 'quite', 'well', 'terms', 'think', 'success']",Solaris

753276,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00009ATIX,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","Although far from a perfect film, the American version of Solaris benefits from the brevity (90 minutes)and focus of the story (adapted from both the original novel by Stanislaw Lem and Andrew Tarkovsey's classic 70's film). Solaris appears to divide people just about as evenly as both the first film version did and Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released.Solaris appears to be alive. The star around which a huge space station orbits intrudes on the occupants' dreams making what they dream a reality. Why? Is there some sinister purpose or is it an attempt to communicate? Perhaps Solaris is nothing more than an idiot savant playing on the imagination of the astronauts trapped on an endless merry-go-round to hell. Or not.Based on Stanislaw Lem's fascinating novel and echoing the Russian film adaption by the talented Andrei Tarkovsky , Solaris is part dream and reality. George Clooney plays psychologist Chris Kelvin who is sent on a mission to the orbiting space station. His mission is to determine if the astronauts on the Prometheus have gone mad or, perhaps, if some sort of covert attempt at first contact his occurring. When Kelvin arrives he finds one scientist has committed suicide while another has barracaded herself in her room. Clearly something is at work. The only questions are why and what its motivation might possibly be. Kelvin awakens after his first day on the space station and discovers his wife is with him. Which is impossible as she committed suicide.The film, like its Russian counterpart, is designed to unfold gradually with each layer discovered as you watch. The narrative thread that holds the film together appears to be stretched quite thin by the end of the film. None of the central questions are truly answered. Then again, these very qualities make the film interesting. There aren't supposed to be any definitive answers provided. In many respects, Solaris has more in common with Kubrick's 2001. In the novel by Arthur C. Clarke (like Lem's novel Solaris)there are more answers to the puzzle. Kubrick wanted to keep cold, hard answers to a minimum. That's also the case with Soderbergh's film. We live in a tradional world where we expect all answers to be handed out on a silver platter. Many of the best films play with that convention. If you expect answers to the many layered riddles in this fine film, you'll be sadly disappointed. I do take issue with the interpretation of the ending as a &quot;happy&quot; ending; it's no more a happy ending than the perplexing, difficult and complex ending of 2001. In many respects, Kelvin is in as much of a cage as Bowman is in 2001. It's a cage of his own choosing but he has chosen to live in an illusion vs. the real world he left behind. There's a great deal of tragedy to that decision.Clooney and the rest of the small ensemble cast gives terrific performances. I was pleasantly surprised at Clooney's ability to convey the haunted, hurt quality at the core of Kelvin. Directed and written for the screen by the talented Steven Soderbergh, Solaris, like Tarkovsky 's first adaption, is a quiet, unsettling film that bathes itself in Lem's rich metaphors and analogies. While it lacks the glacial pace of Tarkovsky 's original film, the narrative doesn't occur at a breakneck pace either. Recalling both Kubrick's cold 2001: A Space Odyssey and Truffaut's distant Farenheit 451.Interestingly, Soderbergh's film has much of the passion missing from these works of the 60's. It's interesting because, despite its snail like pace, the first film was written and directed in reaction to Kubrick's 2001. Tarkovsky hated the the anonymity of Kubrick's characters and the fact that HAL the computer had more passion, more humanity and, ultimately, more flaws than its creators. So while Soderbergh's film references these other films, it also reflects the very qualities missing from Kubrick's clinical 2001.The DVD transfer is very good. I didn't notice any edge enhancements which have marred many of the films that Fox has put out on DVD. The sound is top notch as well. The extras are sparse; there' the original screenplay available in still mode; an HBO special about the making of the film which is interesting although hardly essential; the films original trailers (both of which are quite vivid and imaginative) and a commentary by Soderbergh that provides an interesting insight into the process of film direction.Solaris deals many of the same themes as Kubrick, Truffaut and other neophyte science fiction directors; it's ultimately about our humanity and the very qualities that make us unique. It's also about the loss of our emotional self at the hands of technology and personal loss. Soderbergh's film is a complimentary piece to the Tarkovsky masterpiece (which can be admittedly difficult to sit through) from the early 70's. Soderbergh asks many more questions than he answers and that's how it should be in great literature, films and plays. Ultimately, the value of any art form is the not just in the questions it asks but in those it chooses not to answer.",4,Haunting adaption of both Russian film and Polish novel,1060560000,"08 11,

My recommendations if youre going to see this movie, see with a friend or loved one, and see it quick because once Gangs of New York comes out, then this will be gone. (if its there that long.)This is by far George Clooney's best movie since ""Out of Sight"". He can really act if given the right script and movie to play in. He did a good job of being the lonely guy. And you can tell right off that something has gone wrong and he feels responsible.I felt this movie moved along nicely. It keeps you guessing but not too much. It wraps up nicely with no loose ends. They weave bits and pieces of science versus morality in with threads of human anxiety and morality. Overall it seemed chilling and a bit eerie with some obvious Sci-fi references thrown in for fun.But alas, this is a love story. and I felt that S.

(There were many points where it could have turned that direction.)  Instead, it turns out to be a meditation on the meaning of existence.The problem with Solaris is the glacial pace at which the story progresses.  There are far too many scenes where the characters all just standing around, not saying anything to each other, not doing anything -- just silence on the screen.

It has a great look, a very different pace than the usual, and a surreal sense that seems true to Lem's writing, even if the story isn't quite the same.//wiredweird",4,Intense and cryptic,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1238,"['story', 'Stanislaw', 'Lem', 'Polish', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'orbit', 'aroud', 'alien', 'planet', 'Solaris', 'bizarre', 'things', 'have', 'started', 'happen', 'crew', 'security', 'team', 'address', 'problem', 'vanishes', 'trace', 'Then', 'one', 'crew', 'back', 'Earth', 'asking', 'one', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'solve', 'problem', 'Chris', 'Kelvin', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'anything', 'more', 'deeply', 'wrapped', 'up', 'problem', 'original', 'crew', 'end', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what.This', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'visuals', 'good', 'performances', 'portraying', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'become', 'very', 'strange', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'stretch', 'term', 'meaning', 'moody', 'brooding', 'claustrophobic', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'George', 'Clooney', 'ego', 'movie', 'one', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Clooney', 'had', 'made', 'pile', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'reputation', 'use', 'push', 'Somehow', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'indy', 'feel.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'do', 'great', 'look', 'very', 'different', 'pace', 'usual', 'surreal', 'sense', 'true', 'Lem', 'writing', 'even', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same.//wiredweird']",Solaris
753281,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B00009ATIX,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[4, 6]","First off I'm a huge Lem fan and Solaris is the one book I had read four times and will probably read again. I wasn't all too convinced by Tarkovskis adaption which is a great piece of cinematic art but doesn't deliver what the book was about in its core. Lem wasn't happy with the movie neither. This new adaption he accepted more easily, but not wholeheartly.To me, there's one specific thing about Lem's work that was not present in Soderbergh's adaption. Sure, one thing is a book, the other is a movie, there shouldn't be much of a comparison, but I was SO let down by the fact that everything else was taken into the movie but NOT the main theme, which was the question of communications, be it with human or alien beings.In Solaris, people are trying to solve one huge problem. They found this planet that is moving between two suns which is not a seldom thing. But this one isn't behaving correctly: it should only be a matter of time untill the planet gets blown away by one of the suns due to gravitation rules. This one is different. The problem is that this planet might mean that one of the most important physical laws could turn out to be wrong, absolutly wrong. It would be like finding evidence nowadays that our planet in fact IS flat. This would trigger so many questions, it would turn it all upside down. Countless universities are trying to find out if science had been COMPLETLY WRONG, students are doing studies on the subject. So that is the reason why astronauts were sent up there to begin with. In the movie, they are doing ""energy research"". Is this a detail? Hell no it ain't.In the book, the scientists have absolutly no explanation on anything, they have been doing experiments during the last fifty years or so but they could not repeat one single experiment and get the same result. Whatever they did, the ocean planet SOLARIS never ever behaved in a way that could even give an idea of what this planet is all about. Now the story begins with the arrival of Kelvin. His mission is not only to look after the astronauts but also to make one huge decision: should the whole Solaris project be stopped due to huge costs and no useful results or should they go on and keep looking for clues? It is in Kelvins hands to make this decision. And this also is an important point of the story. Science had never found an explanation, they could only file the side effects of the planet. All they could do was watch and be dazzled, but there was no way to influence or trigger something willingly. Sometimes the ocean did not react on an experiment, sometimes it did, but never twice the same way. And while they are looking for explanations they get these visitors who don't know themselves what it all is about. They even quesionize why they hadn't questionized their being there... on a space station light years away from home. Even the visitors do not have an explanation. They can only watch, and if their host is leaving their field of view they freak out. So they HAVE to see their hosts. In the end the scientists are the ones being researched and observed. For what reason they don't know.Lem mostly is giving you a special Sci-Fi scenario in which something ALWAYS become clear: these are humans. But Solaris is a place where there is not one single human motive. It is not a place for humans, it has nothing human to it, it goes beyond any possible human explanation, just like a cat would never understand that art and movies exist. Nevertheless, humans are using their human brain to solve a totally un-human thing by asking human questions. Science means asking questions. But every question has the answer already, be it fully or partly. If you are researching the biohazard level of some specific water the result will be restricted due to your restricted thinking pattern. If humans wouldn't have found out that biohazard exists they would have been looking for a totally different thing and found a satisfying answer whatsoever. Lem always successfully shows that in science there are human thinkers, no gods. The problem human people have between each other is absolutly the same the scientists have with Solaris, and therefore that science has, fundamentally. In the book, there are people interacting with each other and the planet. In both cases the communication fails for exactly the same reason, although one is an alien ocean planet, the other is a human.So in Lem's work one point was to show the impossibility NOT to communicate. There cannot be NO Communication but missunderstood communications due to lack of the possibility to fully identify with and understand the other.This film is not a good adaption. But it's an interesting love story taking place in space. It's just not Solaris and that is not so bad. If only Soderbergh wouldn't be this convinced by having adapted the original material. Looks like he didn't understand the book by no chance.",3,Love in Space,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,4908,"['First', 'off', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Lem', 'fan', 'Solaris', 'one', 'book', 'had', 'read',
