143304,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,079283948X,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Best Seller, 1987 filmThis is a story about a professional killer (who works for a big and evil corporation) who wants to write a book about his life and work. He picks a police lieutenant to be the author of his biography! Is this premise plausible? Cleve tells Dennis about his career and personal life, and offers evidence that he did what he claimed to have done. They travel around the country and have adventures that they manage to survive. In the end Cleve finds what he was seeking and his final justice. The book about his life is published. Would you read or buy it? As fiction or fact? I suspect the tone of this movie prevented it from being popular at the box office.This is an action movie whose story serves as the base for travel, adventure, and killings. Can you believe so many murders would remain unsolved? Perhaps, but a traveling killer would need local support (finger man, transportation, lodgings). Murders of journalists and politicians are more common in other countries where fascism (the rule by corporations) or an aristocracy (the rule by big landowners) are more powerful. These killings are rarely reported in your local newspaper. There was an unusual death rate among people who said they witnessed some part of the JFK assassination, but that is still rare in the USA. The movie ""Z"" was very popular around 1969, just like Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent"" around 1940. Both are very good movies but are seldom shown on television.

But I thought, hey, for $2.99 for Vid on Demand, what do I have to lose!Wow, I was really surprised what a great film this was:  of course my two of my favorite actors were excellent as usual, but the film, direction, story line, dialogue and  cinematography was really good, to the point where it was hard to believe it had been made so long ago.  Excellent movie, fast-paced and unpredictable, with James Woods playing a character who was both oddly sympathetic and at the same time, a cold blooded killer--who else could have played this role but him!

143311,A1EHD9FFW3274W,079283948X,copy_1@hotmail.com,"[1, 1]","6. BEST-SELLER (action, 1987) In 1972, 4-armed-masked men rob the police evidence depository in downtown LA. The thieves kill two cops and fatally would a third one. Surviving, policeman Dennis Meechum (Brian Dennehy)  writes a book on the now 'infamous' robbery. The book becomes a best seller  making Meechum a part-time writer but full-time cop. He is eventually  promoted to Detective. 15 years later, on an undercover job, he meets Cliff  (James Woods), a mysterious character whom saves his life. Cliff knows many  personal things about Meechum's life, including the fact that ever since  his wife's death he has given up writing. He tells him that he can provide  him with an assured best seller based on David Matlock (one of the richest  men in town). Cliff used to work for Meechum as an assassin, but after  years of loyal work, he was dismissed. In order for Meechum to believe him,  Cliff takes him on a tour of his previous work and private life (Cliff's  wants to be included in the book as its inspiration). An uneasy alliance is  formed, as Meechum uncovers Cliff's darkest secrets.Critique: There are  many reasons to like Best-Seller. It has a good, entertaining premise (a  rogue assassin on the loose), the moody cinematography (another Adam  Greenberg job), and displays a strong performance from the always reliable  Brain Dennehy. But best of all, it has what I consider to be James Woods'  best role. This capriciously underrated actor has given excellent  performances in many films including: the sleazy TV-producer in David  Cronenberg's interesting, albeit obscured masterpiece Videodrome (1983),  his red-neck southerner in The Onion Field (1979), and in Oliver Stone's  sadly neglected Salvador (1986- for which he received an Academy Nominee).  In most of his films, Woods has specialized in playing low-life has-beens,  who have few redeeming qualities. The only fault I saw in his early roles  was that they were too shallow, not allowing the 'actor' enough room to  move. In Best-Seller, he plays it cool. The character of Cliff knows what  he wants and how to get it, and proves himself worthy of Meechum's respect.  What better actor to give us a tour through the life of a criminal, hitman,  sleaze-ball, all-nice guy?QUOTES: Cliff: &quot;Will power is what  distinguishes the amateur from the professional.  Do you have it Dennis? Will power?..Let's hope so.&quot;",3,CULT MOVIES 6,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,2403,"['6', 'BEST-SELLER', 'action', '1987', '1972', '4-armed-masked', 'men', 'rob', 'police', 'evidence', 'depository', 'downtown', 'LA', 'thieves', 'kill', 'two', 'cops', 'fatally', 'would', 'third', 'one', 'Surviving', 'policeman', 'Dennis', 'Meechum', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'book', 'now', ""'infamous"", 'robbery', 'book', 'best', 'seller', 'making', 'Meechum', 'part-time', 'writer', 'full-time', 'cop', 'eventually', 'promoted', 'Detective', '15', 'years', 'later', 'undercover', 'job', 'Cliff', 'James', 'Woods', 'mysterious', 'character', 'whom', 'life', 'Cliff', 'many', 'personal', 'things', 'Meechum', 'life', 'including', 'fact', 'ever', 'wife', 'death', 'given', 'up', 'writing', 'can', 'provide', 'assured', 'best', 'seller', 'based', 'David', 'Matlock', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'town', 'Cliff', 'used', 'work', 'Meechum', 'assassin', 'years', 'loyal', 'work', 'was', 'dismissed', 'order', 'Meechum', 'believe', 'Cliff', 'tour', 'previous', 'work', 'private', 'life', 'Cliff', 'be', 'included', 'book', 'inspiration', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'formed', 'Meechum', 'uncovers', 'Cliff', 'darkest', 'secrets.Critique', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'like', 'Best-Seller', 'good', 'entertaining', 'premise', 'rogue', 'assassin', 'loose', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'Adam', 'Greenberg', 'job', 'strong', 'performance', 'always', 'reliable', 'Brain', 'Dennehy', 'best', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'James', 'Woods', 'best', 'role', 'capriciously', 'underrated', 'actor', 'given', 'excellent', 'performances', 'many', 'films', 'including', 'sleazy', 'TV-producer', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'obscured', 'masterpiece', 'Videodrome', '1983', 'red-neck', 'southerner', 'Onion', 'Field', '1979', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'Salvador', '1986-', 'received', 'Academy', 'Nominee', 'most', 'films', 'Woods', 'specialized', 'playing', 'low-life', 'has-beens', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'only', 'fault', 'saw', 'early', 'roles', 'was', 'were', 'too', 'shallow', 'not', 'allowing', ""'actor"", 'enough', 'room', 'move', 'Best-Seller', 'cool', 'character', 'Cliff', 'what', 'how', 'get', 'worthy', 'Meechum', 'respect', 'What', 'better', 'actor', 'give', 'tour', 'life', 'criminal', 'hitman', 'sleaze-ball', 'all-nice', 'guy', 'QUOTES', 'Cliff', 'quot', 'Will', 'power', 'what', 'amateur', 'professional', 'Do', 'have', 'Dennis', 'Will', 'power', '..Let', 'hope', 'so.', 'quot']",Best Seller VHS

He shows such a combination of polite mannerisms and brute violence that creates a character so likable and yet fearful that you just have to love the whole movie in combination. With trying to convince a cop that his life as a killer (professional hit man) is the truth, you learn bit by bit about what he is and what he's done, but he's the hero in the end (won't say how). I absolutely enjoyed the movie from start to finish; the mystery of Cleve was just incredible.I highly recommend this movie to any James Woods' fan and if even they're just looking for a thriller, this takes the cake. Definitely, I think this movie should come out once more to show just how brilliant Woods is as an actor, exceptional thrilling. I loved it all the way, buying it on DVD since the 24-Hour Rental just isn't enough time for me to watch it over and over, and over again.

Woods plays an ex-hitman, Cleave, for a large business situated in Los Angeles, which means you get to see him show his capacities to be smooth, calculating, and also emotionally explosive.  While this movie is put in the action category, as it should be, its plot unfolds itself by slowly revealing the machinations of a corrupt and powerful business, that Woods' character is trying to take down for having gyped him at some point in his service.  Throughout this development, the movie plays the characters of Woods -the cunning and dangerous hitman- and Dennehy -a just but temperamental cop- off one another. As you can guess, Dennis, the cop, continually suspects Cleave of having some dark secret or another cold trick up his sleeve.

143328,AR1T36GLLAFFX,079283948X,Scott FS,"[10, 10]","Somehow, I missed this when it was released theatrically, and I'm sorry I did.James Woods gives a boffo performance as a professional hit man, who tries (for a long time) to convince a cop named Dennis  (Brian Dennehy) that he is telling him the truth about his life as a killer.  Woods plays Cleve, and is simply fantastic.  Other reviewers emphasize Woods' performance, but Dennehy more than holds his own.Cleve is the type of person you'd be fascinated as heck to know from a distance, but I'm sure I'd not be very comfortable up close and personal with such a violent, loose cannon.  He can be sympathetic, but just when you think you can trust him, he turns horribly violent.  Besides, a lot of people in his life just seem to end up dead!There are some formulaic aspects to the film, but all in all, it's fresh, compelling, and the kind of movie you're going to remember for quite a while.  It will actually keep you guessing to the end.If you are looking for a taunt, tense thriller, this is a great choice.  How come I've never heard of it?  I'm not sure.

James Woods always the 2nd string to better known actors, and Brian Dennehy who is now an award winning stage actor on Broadway.Without these two actors and the chemistry that develops between them the film wouldn't have worked. Its an interesting story that keeps you guessing where its going (unless you've seen it as many times as I have). The direction by John Flynn is straightforward, and the script by Larry Cohen is pretty sharp. There are a few memorable scenes that will stick with you, and I would say its one of the few films I've seen where it could have been 15 minutes longer.Woods plays the villian in the film, with Dennehy playing the cop who is now a successful novelist.
