714162,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00006FMBT,Anton Ilinski,"[14, 15]","Although many reviewers didn't like the second part of the ""Hills"", I still wouldn't call it ""one of the worst sequels ever"" or ""the worst Wes Craven film"". Certainly this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre, but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in 1984. But ""The Hills Have Eyes"" were reminiscent of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and in the beginning of 80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created ""Friday the 13th"" in 1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned ""Friday the 13th"": the score was written by Harry Manfredini, known to every ""Friday"" fan, and the music in ""Hills 2"" is just like in early ""Fridays"". The body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here, would star in ""Friday the 13th part VII"" a couple of years later along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" and in ""Friday"" would play you know whom.Of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into account.So I think ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" managed on many levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror.",4,CANNIBALS WHO WANNA BE LIKE JASON,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2161,"['many', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'second', 'part', 'Hills', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'one', 'worst', 'sequels', 'ever', 'worst', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'Certainly', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'framework', 'horror', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'worse', 'other', 'slasher', 'flick', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'came', 'conclusion', 'early', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'had', 'been', 'imitating', 'other', 'directors', 'rather', 'often', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'eventually', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '1984', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'were', 'reminiscent', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'beginning', '80s', 'when', 'slasher', 'era', 'started', 'guess', 'Craven', 'decided', 'make', 'something', 'same', 'manner', 'Maybe', 'reason', 'was', 'Craven', 'long-time', 'buddy', 'Sean', 'Cunningham', 'created', 'Friday', '13th', '1980', 'Wes', 'was', 'envious', 'Anyway', 'second', 'part', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pure', 'slasher', 'many', 'others', 'time', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'mentioned', 'Friday', '13th', 'score', 'was', 'written', 'Harry', 'Manfredini', 'known', 'Friday', 'fan', 'music', 'Hills', '2', 'just', 'early', 'Fridays', 'body', 'count', 'increased', 'comparing', 'first', 'part', 'approached', 'regular', 'slasher', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Blair', 'who', 'had', 'leading', 'male', 'part', 'here', 'would', 'star', 'Friday', '13th', 'part', 'VII', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'who', 'did', 'stunts', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'Friday', 'would', 'play', 'know', 'whom.Of', 'course', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'stupidities', 'other', 'slasher', 'movies', 'characters', 'wandering', 'night', 'alone', 'instead', 'sticking', 'together', 'big', 'strong', 'guys', 'get', 'killed', 'handicapped', 'girl', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'considering', 'spoiler', 'obvious', 'very', 'beginning', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'couple', 'horror', 'films', 'life', 'problem', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'not', 'take', 'trivia', 'account.So', 'think', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'managed', 'many', 'levels', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'have', 'collection', 'have', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'films', 'talking', 'subgenres', 'horror']","The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2"
714163,A1YZ2NO74DCP48,B00006FMBT,Autumn Butterfly,"[6, 8]","I've seen far worse horror films ('Boogeyman', anyone?) than this one, but it still was not one of Wes Craven's best. I'll spare the synopsis since everyone else has written it out, but add a few of the film's strengths and weaknesses.The story line is rather interesting, though a little too convenient. It's far too coincidental that Ruby becomes civilized then through circumstance ends up in the exact same area from which she escaped.Michael Berryman and Janus Blythe were excellent. Their performances were two of the three professional (and watchable) ones in the film. Pluto and Ruby were two of my favorite characters in the first film, and I was hoping the second film would at least do them justice. After the opening sequence it all went downhill, but Janus Blythe and Michael Berryman gave strong, solid performances, fitting easily into their roles.The rest of the cast was, sadly, awful. These people were among the most wooden and obnoxious I have seen in any film, horror or otherwise. One guy was so completely idiotic my 17 year-old son and I both cheered when he was flattened by a boulder. No need to ask which one. Ten minutes into the movie you'll know. And you'll cheer too.Robert Houston was also very convincing  and natural in the role of Bobby. Bobby was clearly still haunted by the trauma he suffered in the desert, and the scene in which he was in session with his psychologist was extremely believable.

Actually, the film plays well if watched right after the first, but it cannot stand on its own.It contains some of the now standard cliches of the 80s slasher flicks: the guys are immature, the women are intuitive, but discounted, and the post-adolescent sex/skinny dipping/shower scenes are de rigeur.  Also, the most vulnerable character lives (this time, a pretty, but blind, young woman).  Plenty of 80s hair and fashion, but lacking the suspensefulness of the first.  In the original, we WANT some of the victims to be killed because they're so stupid and obnoxious.  In Hills II, they're just immature.",2,Weakquel to a B-Movie Drive-In Classic,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,827,"['Hills', 'II', 'been', 'said', 'was', 'attempt', 'repeat', 'success', 'not', 'only', 'first', 'flick', 'also', 'up-and-coming', 'Jason', 'Halloween', 'franchises', 'released', 'just', 'Freddie', 'franchise', 'was', 'starting', 'Actually', 'film', 'well', 'watched', 'right', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'own.It', 'now', 'standard', 'cliches', '80s', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'guys', 'are', 'immature', 'women', 'are', 'intuitive', 'discounted', 'post-adolescent', 'sex/skinny', 'dipping/shower', 'scenes', 'are', 'de', 'rigeur', 'Also', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'lives', 'time', 'pretty', 'blind', 'young', 'woman', 'Plenty', '80s', 'hair', 'fashion', 'lacking', 'suspensefulness', 'first', 'original', 'WANT', 'victims', 'be', 'killed', ""'re"", 'so', 'stupid', 'obnoxious', 'Hills', 'II', ""'re"", 'just', 'immature']","The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2"

When the racing teams bus break's down, hell ensues, as Pluto and the newly introduced ""reaper"" indulge in some gruesome killing.The dvd itself is nowhere near the quality I would have liked. The picture is overly grainy, and I noticed a ""shimmer"", for lack of a better word, throughout the course of the fim. All in all the picture quality is that of an old vhs rental copy.
