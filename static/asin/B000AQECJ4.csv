This one, though, is an example of seemingly prepared 'camp' and is an exquisite mess.  Leslie Caron, in an off-beat role, is the most fun -- playing Alla Nazimova with way over-the-top antics. Even in this, she commands attention.  Rudolf Nureyev can't act, of course, but the fleeting times during which he is dancing is enjoyable...except that half of the time, you can't see his magnificent steps--the camera avoids them.  Historically, ti is all wrong...but, hey, that is the least of its problems.  Music is solidly handled, as are art and set work, and costuming (particularly the weirdness worn by Nazimova -- hilarious!!  Valentino's life does not resemble what Russell has done, although it would make a fascinating film.

931152,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000AQECJ4,David Baldwin,"[6, 6]","The jury is out on whether or not Ken Russell was a good director but most certainly he is an interesting one.  In the Mid-Seventies there were a series of film bios about figures from Hollywood's Golden Age, notably ""Gable and Lombard"" and ""W.C. Fields and Me"" to name a few.  These were for the most part earnest affairs that mostly took a straightforward approach to their subjects.  Russell here takes an opposite tack by sending up the genre.  For better or for worse ""Valentino"" is sublimely surreal.  Watching this film I found by jaw drop and in most cases that's not such a bad thing.  What Russell is doing here is lampooning the Roaring Twenties which some would appreciate and others offend.  What keeps me from giving the film the full five star treatment is the comically inept performance by Rudolph Nureyev as Valentino.  Intentional, perhaps?  Struggling with what I think is an Italian accent, Nureyev doesn't seem to be in on the joke or maybe he doesn't comprehend.  Regardless, I give kudos to Russell for some of his casting choices.  You can't go wrong with a film that includes among it's cast Huntz Hall (The Bowery Boys) as Jesse Lasky, John Ratzenberger(Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"") as a reporter and Billy McKinney (""Deliverance"") as a sadistic jailer.  On a final note of trivia, Carol Kane who is in this film, also appeared in another film in 1977 that featured Valentino albeit in abbreviated form, Gene Wilder's underrated comic gem ""The World's Greatest Lover"".",4,High Camp...That Works,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1494,"['jury', 'out', 'not', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'was', 'good', 'director', 'most', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'one', 'Mid-Seventies', 'were', 'series', 'film', 'bios', 'figures', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'notably', 'Gable', 'Lombard', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'Me', 'name', 'few', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'earnest', 'affairs', 'mostly', 'took', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'subjects', 'Russell', 'here', 'opposite', 'tack', 'sending', 'up', 'genre', 'better', 'worse', 'Valentino', 'sublimely', 'surreal', 'Watching', 'film', 'found', 'jaw', 'drop', 'most', 'cases', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'What', 'Russell', 'doing', 'here', 'lampooning', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'would', 'appreciate', 'others', 'offend', 'What', 'giving', 'film', 'full', 'five', 'star', 'treatment', 'comically', 'inept', 'performance', 'Rudolph', 'Nureyev', 'Valentino', 'Intentional', 'perhaps', 'Struggling', 'what', 'think', 'Italian', 'accent', 'Nureyev', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'joke', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'Regardless', 'give', 'kudos', 'Russell', 'casting', 'choices', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'cast', 'Huntz', 'Hall', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'Jesse', 'Lasky', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'Cliff', 'Claven', 'Cheers', 'reporter', 'Billy', 'McKinney', 'Deliverance', 'sadistic', 'jailer', 'final', 'note', 'trivia', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'who', 'film', 'also', 'appeared', 'film', '1977', 'featured', 'Valentino', 'albeit', 'abbreviated', 'form', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'underrated', 'comic', 'gem', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Lover']",N/A
931153,A232VC3C59Y5LA,B000AQECJ4,"David E. Pouliot ""oh_popeye""","[22, 25]","In Valentino, Ken Russell places his spin on silent Hollywood and its biggest icon of its period...Rudolph Valentino. The film captures the distruction of what happens when fame over powers hollywood and the changes it has on actors. As well as the Directors and Producers who saw Valentino's death as a bottom line loss to potential financial wealth in future films. Rudolph Nureyev's dancing talents are stong, but he lacks screen drama and presence; however, playing the role fit his style as silent movies didn't carry the actors voice.There are tense moments with 'Mama' Michelle Phillips (32 at the time filmed) that captures her and Nureyev completely naked in a 'tongue and Sheik' love scene (truly enjoyable for Phillips fans).  The movie has an artistic flair as the costumes and era are captured nicely with the setting and props for the time.  There are odd moments of celebrity spot-lighting as in the grand entrance by Leslie Caron into the funeral parlor and a sequence at the producers home and choice of having a baby gorilla in the office.Overall, I think this film captures the rise and fall of Valentino and his untimely death and the women in his life that knew of his character. Many believe he was a homosexual and maintained lavender relationships...so much could be said for Rudolf Nureyev himself (who died of AIDS in 1993).",3,Valentino by Ken Russell is good bio viewing!,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,1350,"['Valentino', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'spin', 'silent', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'icon', 'period', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino', 'film', 'distruction', 'what', 'when', 'fame', 'powers', 'hollywood', 'changes', 'actors', 'As', 'well', 'Directors', 'Producers', 'who', 'saw', 'Valentino', 'death', 'bottom', 'line', 'loss', 'potential', 'financial', 'wealth', 'future', 'films', 'Rudolph', 'Nureyev', 'dancing', 'talents', 'are', 'stong', 'screen', 'drama', 'presence', 'however', 'playing', 'role', 'fit', 'style', 'silent', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'actors', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', ""'Mama"", 'Michelle', 'Phillips', '32', 'time', 'filmed', 'Nureyev', 'completely', 'naked', ""'tongue"", 'Sheik', 'love', 'scene', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'Phillips', 'fans', 'movie', 'artistic', 'flair', 'costumes', 'era', 'are', 'captured', 'nicely', 'setting', 'props', 'time', 'are', 'odd', 'moments', 'celebrity', 'spot-lighting', 'grand', 'entrance', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'sequence', 'producers', 'home', 'choice', 'having', 'baby', 'gorilla', 'office.Overall', 'think', 'film', 'rise', 'fall', 'Valentino', 'untimely', 'death', 'women', 'life', 'knew', 'character', 'Many', 'believe', 'was', 'homosexual', 'maintained', 'lavender', 'relationships', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'who', 'died', 'AIDS', '1993']",N/A
