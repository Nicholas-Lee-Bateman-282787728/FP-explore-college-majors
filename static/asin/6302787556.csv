I ordered it from Amazon, USA, shipping costs out the wazoo and I don't care.The very sight of this film's title probably made some readers cringe. It's also possible that saying the wrong thing about it will make people unsubscribe. Those are two reasons, right there, why the story is relevant. Anyone who can stir up that much controversy is surely worth hearing. As authors, most of us spend our lives spouting for all we're worth and hoping somebody -- anybody -- feels our words. Malcolm X had listeners. Yes he did.I laughed out loud several times. This matters. It's not just some dark (forgive the bad pun) movie about oppression and such. It's about life in an exciting and sometimes frightening time, and about some folks who liked to have fun, and just very cool in general. This ain't a freaking documentary. Well, it is, but at the same time it ain't. It's quite an enjoyable bio about a quite interesting guy. One who shares my initials of ML, but that's quite irrelevant.This film is not only about the words that came out of Malcolm X's mouth. I respect his mind, and I was pleased to hear what he had to say, whether I agreed or not. His words gave me plenty to think about. Often I did agree, but that's just me. That's only part of what this film is about. It's about one man's extraordinary journey, in pursuit of truth, whatever the hell that is. I've spent my life questing after that myself, without the added burden of followers and such.I know that director Spike Lee has perhaps rubbed some folks the wrong way. Myself included. Deliberately, too, which I respect. But not here. This story is far too important. I have nothing but respect for everyone involved with it. Denzel, of course. He became Malcolm. Alex Haley, author of the biography that I own but have not yet read. (I will!) So many actors and actresses that I recognized and appreciated. Excellent soundtrack, of course.What did I know about Malcolm before I saw this film? Nothing. We don't talk about him where I grew up, except perhaps to spread a few horribly wrong lies. I choose not to repeat them. You've probably heard them, and if you haven't, I don't want you hearing them from me.I was stunned to learn that Malcolm was, in fact, a walking talking breathing stereotype. He was a gangsta, plain and simple. Nothing to lose, brilliant, and just mean as all get-out. Eat your heart out Snoop Dogg, and Malcolm dressed better than Deion Sanders to boot. Then prison, militant racist Islam, betrayal, pilgrimage, and finally the realization that Islam is neither militant nor racist. The guys in this story never overcame sexism, but not even science fiction does that.Spike Lee made this film in 1992. I don't know if he could do it today. Hating Muslims has become quite fashionable, has it not? This really does piss me off, even though Islam may be the only religion I haven't subscribed to at some point. I guess intolerance of any sort pisses me off.This film is very relevant, very moving, very important. Will I watch it again? Damn straight. I don't feel I can use it in a classroom because it'd take me too long to explain it all. But for you in the West, my ""mandatory"" list is very short.

334325,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302787556,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Spike Lee is a great film maker. Denzel Washington is a great actor (Could any other actor have given the spirit of Malcolm such a realistic treatment?). That said, something is missing here. We know that there are various academic revisionist trends in history and politics that reflect the changing appreciations of latter generations, and not always for the better. That trend is apparent here. The missing element is the struggle going on around Malcolm as he tries honestly to break out of the black nationalist isolation of the Nation of Islam and articulate the necessary strategy to drive the civil rights movement in America and the revolutionary national liberation struggles internationally forward. What is also missing is the sense that Malcolm, in the early 1960's, stood as the LONE voice of the rage of the ghettos, against the white establishment and their black hangers-on like Dr. King. There was a Chinese Wall between his calls to break with the Kennedys, Johnsons and the rest of the Democratic Party, his calls for black armed self-defense, North,South and West and the policies of what he rightly called the ""Uncle Tom"" black establishment which kowtowed to that white establishment. There still is. No amount of revisionism will erase that distinction. What those interested in Malcolm need to do is read his Autobiography of Malcolm X  (see all my reviews for my take on Malcolm) and other books from the 1960's struggles. Still, this film is a good primer in order to learn how the most honest revolutionary black liberation fighter in 20th century America earned his place in history.",4,BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,1612,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'great', 'film', 'maker', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'great', 'actor', 'Could', 'other', 'actor', 'have', 'given', 'spirit', 'Malcolm', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'said', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'know', 'are', 'various', 'academic', 'revisionist', 'trends', 'history', 'politics', 'reflect', 'changing', 'appreciations', 'latter', 'generations', 'not', 'always', 'better', 'trend', 'apparent', 'here', 'missing', 'element', 'struggle', 'going', 'around', 'Malcolm', 'honestly', 'break', 'black', 'nationalist', 'isolation', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'articulate', 'necessary', 'strategy', 'drive', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'America', 'revolutionary', 'national', 'liberation', 'internationally', 'forward', 'What', 'also', 'missing', 'sense', 'Malcolm', 'early', '1960', 'stood', 'LONE', 'voice', 'rage', 'ghettos', 'white', 'establishment', 'black', 'hangers-on', 'Dr.', 'King', 'was', 'Chinese', 'Wall', 'calls', 'break', 'Kennedys', 'Johnsons', 'rest', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'calls', 'black', 'armed', 'self-defense', 'North', 'South', 'West', 'policies', 'what', 'rightly', 'called', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'black', 'establishment', 'kowtowed', 'white', 'establishment', 'still', 'amount', 'revisionism', 'will', 'erase', 'distinction', 'What', 'interested', 'Malcolm', 'need', 'do', 'read', 'Autobiography', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'see', 'reviews', 'take', 'Malcolm', 'other', 'books', '1960', 'struggles', 'Still', 'film', 'good', 'primer', 'order', 'learn', 'how', 'most', 'honest', 'revolutionary', 'black', 'liberation', 'fighter', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'earned', 'place', 'history']",N/A

Denzell Washington and Angela Bassett in top-rate performances; really, this is true for everyone in this great film.Spike Lee, in speaking before each deleted scene in the extras, shows himself to be a bit inarticulate-- as every time he discussed the Egyption Sphinx, he kept mispronouncing it as ""Spinks.""  As he seems to be a boxing fan, it sounded exactly like the last name of the famous boxing brothers, Leon and Michael Spinks.  Hey Spike, it's pronounced ""Sfinx.""He is also speaking off the cuff into the camera, which to me showed laziness and unpreparedness on his part, as I've never seen someone on a blu-ray or DVD extra seem so unprofessional as to do this.

""brnn64""","[77, 81]","While the movie itself is excellent, this is one of those DVDs that makes a great film even greater.Much has been said about the 1992 film, so I'll concentrate on the extras. First of all, the widescreen is not so wide that it makes you squint to see it. It's at a good porportion. But the edited scenes are really interesting. We see previously unseen footage of Denzel as Malcolm courting Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz (in a rather touching way). We see Denzel/Malcolm putting an initiate through the rigors in an amusing fashion, we see him studying and feeding his hunger for books while in jail, and we see some interesting scenes of Denzel/Malcolm making anti-racist and pro-brotherhood statements near the end of his life to a young white girl and an Arab he meets in Mecca. A lot of people who miss the point about Malcolm's transformation should see those scenes (which actually appear in the original book).(Slight complaint, the stuff about the Sphinx's black nose being shot off by Napoleon is a bunch of BS that didn't happen, even Molefi Asante admitted this on 60 minutes a few years ago. So it's just as well that that scene was not included in the original film).Also, ""Baines"" was actually John Bembry, aka Bimbi, who encouraged Malcolm to read in prison. It was actually Malcolm's real life brothers who really introduced him to the Nation of Islam teachings. Not a complaint, just a clarification.There is also an excellent documentary about the making of this film. A real Horatio Alger type story of how Spike beat the odds through dogged determination to raise the money to make the film the way he felt it needed to be made. It was sad to realize that the film was not as popular as hoped among young people upon it's intitial release and the ""Malcolmania"" of the early 90s turned out to be a fad, but at least this DVD will give people the opportunity to learn from Malcolm's story.Then there is the uncut 1972 documentary ""Malcolm X. The raw, uncut REAL Malcolm talking strong and taking numbers! This is a brilliantly edited collection of chronological clips of Macolm, Elijham Muhammad, the young Louis Farrakhan, and all the other major players into an excellent biography without additional narration. It lets the viewer decide in an excellet fashion.So see the 1992 movie, then the ""making of"" documentary, then the deleted scenes, and THEN the 1972 documentary and you'll get the next best thing to reading all there is to know about Malcolm X thought.

Despite the film's three-hour-plus length, it was never boring and it managed to keep me interested until the last five  minutes or so.It tells the story of Malcolm X and shows the enormous  changes he went through in his remarkable life. Though the film often fails  to take a really intimate look at Malcolm X, Denzel Washington's  superlative performance successfully counters this weakness. He keeps us  interested in this man, despite the fact, that Lee's film, though it is  exquisitely filmed, lacks the courage to explorethe person Malcolm X. The  film rather deals with the historical figure of Malcolm and the key events  of his life. This makes his picture sometimes seem more dutiful than  dramatic. Still, &quot;Malcolm X&quot; is one of the best biopics, not only  because of Denzel Washington and the other very good actors. I also liked  the cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, the music and the production design  which added to the authentic mood of the movie.If Lee had ended his  movie five minutes earlier, I would have given it four stars, but  unfortunately, he made the disastrous decision to add a closing coda that  one can only call embarrasing. It's nothing else but clumsy propaganda and  nowhere near the subtlety that the rest of the film displayed. It even  features Nelson Mandela who seems to feel uncomfortable in front of a film  camera. Maybe Lee was afraid of the subtlety of his picture and feared that  someone couldn't get the message. I know that this is just speculation.  Whatever his motives were, he didn't do his film a favour.",3,Fine biopic is hurt by awful coda,958521600,"05 17, 2000",2000,1661,"['When', 'watched', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'quot', 'TV', 'was', 'pleasurable', 'surprise', 'film', 'three-hour-plus', 'length', 'was', 'never', 'boring', 'managed', 'keep', 'interested', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'so.It', 'story', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'enormous', 'changes', 'went', 'remarkable', 'life', 'film', 'often', 'take', 'really', 'intimate', 'look', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'superlative', 'performance', 'successfully', 'weakness', 'interested', 'man', 'fact', 'Lee', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'filmed', 'courage', 'explorethe', 'person', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'film', 'rather', 'deals', 'historical', 'figure', 'Malcolm', 'key', 'events', 'life', 'picture', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'more', 'dutiful', 'dramatic', 'Still', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'biopics', 'not', 'only', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'other', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'also', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'music', 'production', 'design', 'added', 'authentic', 'mood', 'movie.If', 'Lee', 'had', 'ended', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'unfortunately', 'made', 'disastrous', 'decision', 'add', 'closing', 'coda', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'embarrasing', 'nothing', 'else', 'clumsy', 'propaganda', 'nowhere', 'subtlety', 'rest', 'film', 'displayed', 'even', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'who', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'front', 'film', 'camera', 'Maybe', 'Lee', 'was', 'afraid', 'subtlety', 'picture', 'feared', 'someone', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'know', 'just', 'speculation', 'Whatever', 'motives', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'favour']",N/A

It begins the chasm between the pair that ultimately led to the assassination of Malcolm X.What remains the most powerful single scene is Malcolm X walking down the street while the ills of the 'hood are played out before him. So much is said in so little time in depicting the black holocaust of the mind, body and soul.Lee takes cinema to a powerful and dramatic level that is rarely achieved.

334343,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,6302787556,Caleb Williams,"[8, 9]","I say this quite often about movies, but very rarely say it with as much conviction as when I'm referring to Malcolm X. This is, without a doubt the best movie I've seen in my entire lifetime, and if you haven't seen it, then it will become the best movie you will ever see. I'm actually shocked by some of the 1 star reviews, especially the one calling it a dangerous movie. For one, this movie keeps very loyal to the events and people talked about in his autobiography written by Alex Haley. To call it a dangerous film because it chronicles the life of Malcolm X, would be to call history dangerous. It accurately documents the rise and fall of Malcolm X and accurately displays the reasons for that rise and fall. If a man converted to Islam and became a militant because of this movie, then simply, he didn't get this movie, or at least he didn't watch it all the way through. This isn't anti-Islamic, nor can it be claimed that this in any way can incite militant or extremist behaviour as this exposes the consequences of such behaviours.Malcolm X was a man who possibly equally responsible for the civil rights movement of African-Americans, yet accomplished it in a completely different way. When I first read ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" by Alex Haley some 5 years ago, it changed my life. The story of the mans religious beliefs and strong heart was inspiring and a story that showed you can really achieve anything if you set your mind to it. Of course, it's clich&eacute; but life is full of clich&eacute;s and that one is about the only clich&eacute; you can associate with Malcolm X. He was a man not afraid to speak the truth about the segregation of Afro-Americans, especially in the North where it was believed the black man was much more equal than in the south. Spike Lee in some ways is a lot like Malcolm X, he's a man not afraid to speak out against lifes atrocities and lies by putting them up on screen.Denzel Washington is possibly the best casting choice for a movie I've ever witnessed and this casting. Not only does he look like Malcolm, but his personality and charisma match that of the legendary figure. The start of this film is Malcolm (Denzel) delivering one of his infamous speeches which sends the electricity down your spine. What's special is even the delivery is akin to that of Malcolm. After that speech we're reverted back to Malcolms beginnings in Harlem as a drug pusher and pimp, and he's telling the story of his early childhood which presents us with numerous flashbacks of his Fathers murder and his Mothers descension into insanity. Because of this, you sort of become aware of how he ends up being the man he is at the start of the movie by going through all these tragedies. After a robbery with his best friend Shorty goes wrong, he's sent to jail where he finds the Nation of Islam and is visited by an apparition of the Prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm has his eyes opened by the atrocious treatment of the African American by the white man. The NOI even today are fighting to have a state designated solely for the Black American, where they can govern themselves and look after their own interests. Malcolm eventually becomes a minister for the Nation and opens it up to a much wider audience, much to the displeasure or the Nation of Islam.If you're familiar with Minister Malcolm, then you're familiar with what happens next as a result of his joining the Nation. The spectacular life events of such a man are just un-imaginable and it's hard to believe that a man, although he'll disagree, when he was a member of the Nation of Islam was such a segregationist managed to be an influence on so many people. Making such high profile friends such as film star Ossie Davis and working with other, more integarationist activists like Martin Luther King, he managed to truly change the world and is probably one of the main reasons as to why America now has a black man in the White House. Depending on how you look at it, you can either determine that the Islam religion was what made Malcolm such a hero, or whether it was the original manipulation of the Nation of Islam. Either way, I think all will agree that the man was taken away from us all too early.Looking at articles about Malcolm and his wife Betty X, I found out something truly heart wrenching. Betty X, Malcolms wife, died just over 10 years ago in a fire caused by Malcolm X's grandson. I'm not sure whether the fire was lit to deliberately kill his grandmother, but he was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in Juvenile detention for manslaughter. The reason I brought this up is in the film you will be shown a lot of Betty X and you will come to realise when a great mother and wife she was. She was just as strong an influence on the life and times of Malcolm, as the blight of the black American was. She held the Shabazz family together through the times they left the Nation of Islam and were basically being tortured by them. I applaud her and minister Malcolm for their effect on the world and equal rights.Minister Malcolm X (El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz) May 19 1925 - February 21 1965Dr. Betty Shabazz May 28 1936 - June 23

The script seems fairly accurate to history, and the imagery helps bring the conflict, drive and sincerity of Malcolm X to life.In the movie, it becomes so obvious that Malcolm had just reached a kind of Buddhist nirvanna in his Islamic faith. Had he been allowed to live, his newly found spiritual insight gained from his pilgrimage to Mecca most likely would have helped to enlighten other Americans, Muslim or Christian, white or black. Malcolm appears on the verge of something even greater than he had previously been. Malcolm appears to be on the verge of becoming a national and perhaps even global spiritual and secular leader at the time of his death. Denzel makes more mourn the death of a man I never met.

334349,AA28P572CT9Y3,6302787556,"Chief Rocka Dr. Kool ""Chief Rocka Dr. Kool""","[5, 6]","Man, I had sold my 2-disc DVD in order to add this to my BD collection and replace my DVD's with BDs (still waiting on the Shaft films and Suplerfy with surround sound!), but last year this got pushed back because their was a rights issue with Sam cooke songs in the film.  They have it together now and I gather this is why this is priced higher.  I would have waited until it came down, but I figured I would snatch it up in case something else came up!Let me start by saying that this comes in ones of those digibooks and this one is different from previous types.  This has the two discs attached to the covers of the book while the book pages are in the center.  This is strange I maybe it was done because it was two discs. The book IS of a higher quality than the others with embossed titles, so at least you think that you are getting some of your money's worth.  The back has the disc specs on it and it is stuck on better than previous digibooks, but I still do not understand why they cannot just print it on the back cover so that we will never lose it!The movies is the same, the extras are the same as the 2-disc DVD, which is a good thing!  the main thing was they the Malcolm X documentary from the DVD set was included here as well.  It would have been nice if it could have been HD...  They made the making of in an HD-like look or they just letter-boxed it, so why not make a FILM feature in widescreen? All in all, this really just an HD replacement of the 2-disc DVD.AUDIO: I watched this film hundreds of times since I first saw it when it came out.  I can almost recite it line for line and I am very familiar with the scenes and people in this film as well as the sound.  I always thought that Malcolm X had one of the better surround sound effects on DVD and for this largely dialog driven film, and the same startling soundtrack transfers over to Blu-Ray - with upgraded sound.  Of course the quality is better and the best example of the sound is when Malcolm X begins his first duties preaching on the Harlem streets with Al Sharpton and Bobby Seale.  THAT is a perfect use of surround sound panning and it stayed precise!  THIS is the type of surround sound that ALL movies should have.4.5/5PICTURE:  If you already owned the DVD, then you are more than aware of how clean and clear the picture is.  It is so nice looking that when you watch it, you find it hard to believe that twenty years have passed!  The first DVD release of Malcolm X was on a single side, dual-layer disc that was perfect for what I liked - seeing the DVD cover art.  That disc, I knew, was stretching it to the limits because of the running time, but it made do.  The second release spread the film out over two discs which I hate, but when the film is three plus hours long, I can deal with it more.  The picture quality was maximized for DVD and it showed.Now with this Blu-Ray, I was always wondering what improvements could be made on the picture quality since it was already stellar.  I assume that it would appear more film-like and I was not expecting too much more in the way of details.  For the most part that is what you get here, although I have not viewed the DVD in over a year so I am going by memory.  You do see film grain - mainly through the early part of Malcolm's life, before he was sent to prison.  I believe that the grain and slightly smoother look was a style choice kind of like JFK.  Once Malcolm becomes an official Nation of Islam member, the picture is as crisp and as clean as you expect it to be.  This film quality always made me say that this is the reason that directors should not make the jump to straight digital FILMING just yet, as film can be scaled into the future better unlike a digital file.The truth is, you do see more details, but it is not the difference between night and day like most DVD to BD's are.  I better noticed the rubber on Denzel's fake goatee and marks on faces than in the past (I also have a larger TV now too!)and the zoot suits patterns are clear and you can make out exactly what they are and the colors do not stick.5/5Is it an upgrade?  Of course it is, but it is not a light speed jump ONLY because the source material was so good to begin with!  Now, of course this is the best quality Malcolm X you will get on ONE DISC with supreme sound.  If you have the single disc DVD of X, then get this.  If you have the 2-disc set and you do not like having one film over two discs, then get this.  If you want it is loss-less surround sound - get this!Now Warner Brothers, PLEASE give me the Shaft movies and Superfly with remastered soundtracks in surround sound!  I also want the Bruce Lee films on BD edited (why not?) and the sound all-new!  It is not as if those HAVE to be as they were.  Someone do it!",4,It's about Time!!

I saw ""X"" paraphernalia everywhere - on hats, t-shirts, bumper stickers, you name it.  Malcolm X was (and still is) the hero of disenfranchised blacks in the Atlantan suburbs where I lived.  In fact, the famous Rodney King riots happenned around this time, and I saw firsthand the carnage and destruction wrought from such long-simmering anger and frustration.  I was steeped in it.  Of course, it didn't help that I'm considered white (technically I'm part-Latin, but this rarely matters in a majority-black setting).I saw the simmering, sullen hatred from dozens of pairs of eyes whenever I walked as a teen down the public sidewalks or boarded a MARTA bus, so I know how real and burning this kind of thing is.I didn't watch the movie when it came out.I was in my early teens, for one; also, for the places where I lived, I would have been perhaps the only white face in attendance.  I was honestly scared to go, to tell the truth.  I lived in a place where ""Gone With the Wind"" was still foremost in people's minds - the slavery era had not really ended - and I was a sore reminder of a time that just would not die.  I can remember how scared and guilty I felt everywhere I went, though I had no clear idea why.I had only known about ""early"" Malcolm X, his ""any means necessary"" motto (what I saw on t-shirts around me) and of his speeches about ""white devils"" and their systematic oppression of blacks.  I heard his name often in the same breath as declarations to ""go back to Africa"" or ""end apartheid"" (or even, ""kill whitie"").  Pictures of Malcolm X resembled the men exquisitely dressed in suits and bow ties (in the excruciating heat) that I saw on the medians of thoroughfares, ignoring me pointedly as they sold Nation of Islam literature and bean pies.I had thought Malcolm X and his followers in Nation of Islam was the black equivalent of the KKK, so I figured it wasn't something for me to get into.I finally saw the movie in 2004.WOW.I'm now reading Alex Haley's autobiography of Malcolm X.This man has really impressed me.Denzell's depiction and Spike Lee's direction has inspired me to no end.  While I am neither black nor capable of understanding fully the pain of such history or its effects today, I was surrounded by its effects during my most tender years and cannot forget what it felt like to be around it.I almost never buy DVDs.  They are a very rare, well-considered purchase for me.  Yet I want this one.Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen it: do so.  It will change your life.  Agree with him or not, this was a man who examined the world without flinching and acted on his convictions; this was a man who was not afraid to admit when he was wrong and work to redress it.  This was a man who fought tooth and nail yet could think, reason, and even transform himself.The majority of the learned have few convictions.Those of conviction rarely have great intellect or eloquence.Malcolm X was both.He was a man who understood what he was up against and what he had to lose, but did it anyway.  His skill was surpassed only by his doggedness; his impact was seconded only by his willingness to walk away from what did not hold together, even at GREAT personal cost.Whether I agree with his faith or not, whether I agree with his philosophies or not, whether I agree with his methods or not... this is a man that I truly DO respect, a man who reinvented himself repeatedly after having invested himself completely, facing such tremendous loss and sorrow head-on, and never looking back.  He paid the ultimate price, and deserves our love and our respect.Spike Lee and Denzell Washington have done a tremendous job here in re-introducing us to a great American hero, right or wrong.",5,A Terrific Primer On the Malcolm X Most Rarely Know...,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,3816,"['Living', 'Atlanta', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'saw', 'fury', 'film', 'release', 'tapped', 'saw', 'X', 'paraphernalia', 'everywhere', 'hats', 't-shirts', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'name', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'was', 'still', 'hero', 'disenfranchised', 'blacks', 'Atlantan', 'suburbs', 'where', 'lived', 'fact', 'famous', 'Rodney', 'King', 'riots', 'happenned', 'time', 'saw', 'firsthand', 'carnage', 'destruction', 'wrought', 'such', 'long-simmering', 'anger', 'frustration', 'was', 'steeped', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', ""'m"", 'considered', 'white', 'technically', ""'m"", 'part-Latin', 'rarely', 'matters', 'majority-black', 'setting', 'saw', 'simmering', 'sullen', 'hatred', 'dozens', 'pairs', 'eyes', 'whenever', 'walked', 'teen', 'down', 'public', 'sidewalks', 'boarded', 'MARTA', 'bus', 'know', 'how', 'real', 'burning', 'kind', 'thing', 'is.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out.I', 'was', 'early', 'teens', 'one', 'also', 'places', 'where', 'lived', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perhaps', 'only', 'white', 'face', 'attendance', 'was', 'honestly', 'scared', 'go', 'tell', 'truth', 'lived', 'place', 'where', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'was', 'still', 'foremost', 'people', 'minds', 'slavery', 'era', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'ended', 'was', 'sore', 'reminder', 'time', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'die', 'can', 'remember', 'how', 'scared', 'guilty', 'felt', 'everywhere', 'went', 'had', 'clear', 'idea', 'why.I', 'had', 'only', 'known', 'early', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'means', 'necessary', 'motto', 'what', 'saw', 't-shirts', 'speeches', 'white', 'devils', 'systematic', 'oppression', 'blacks', 'heard', 'name', 'often', 'same', 'breath', 'declarations', 'go', 'back', 'Africa', 'end', 'apartheid', 'even', 'kill', 'whitie', 'Pictures', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'resembled', 'men', 'exquisitely', 'dressed', 'suits', 'bow', 'ties', 'excruciating', 'heat', 'saw', 'medians', 'thoroughfares', 'ignoring', 'pointedly', 'sold', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'literature', 'bean', 'pies.I', 'had', 'thought', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'followers', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'was', 'black', 'equivalent', 'KKK', 'figured', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'get', 'into.I', 'finally', 'saw', 'movie', '2004.WOW.I', ""'m"", 'now', 'reading', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'autobiography', 'Malcolm', 'X.This', 'man', 'really', 'impressed', 'me.Denzell', 'depiction', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'direction', 'inspired', 'end', 'am', 'black', 'capable', 'understanding', 'fully', 'pain', 'such', 'history', 'effects', 'today', 'was', 'surrounded', 'effects', 'most', 'tender', 'years', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'around', 'it.I', 'almost', 'never', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'are', 'very', 'rare', 'well-considered', 'purchase', 'want', 'one.Do', 'favor', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'Agree', 'not', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'examined', 'world', 'flinching', 'acted', 'convictions', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'admit', 'when', 'was', 'wrong', 'work', 'redress', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'fought', 'nail', 'yet', 'could', 'think', 'reason', 'even', 'transform', 'himself.The', 'majority', 'learned', 'have', 'few', 'convictions.Those', 'conviction', 'rarely', 'have', 'great', 'intellect', 'eloquence.Malcolm', 'X', 'was', 'both.He', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'what', 'had', 'lose', 'did', 'anyway', 'skill', 'was', 'surpassed', 'only', 'doggedness', 'impact', 'was', 'seconded', 'only', 'willingness', 'walk', 'away', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'together', 'even', 'GREAT', 'personal', 'cost.Whether', 'agree', 'faith', 'not', 'agree', 'philosophies', 'not', 'agree', 'methods', 'not', 'man', 'truly', 'DO', 'respect', 'man', 'who', 'reinvented', 'repeatedly', 'having', 'invested', 'completely', 'facing', 'such', 'tremendous', 'loss', 'sorrow', 'head-on', 'never', 'looking', 'back', 'paid', 'ultimate', 'price', 'love', 'respect.Spike', 'Lee', 'Denzell', 'Washington', 'have', 'done', 'tremendous', 'job', 'here', 're-introducing', 'great', 'American', 'hero', 'right', 'wrong']",N/A

334355,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6302787556,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 1]","What makes this a 'must-see' film is it's depiction of emotional, spiritual and logical growth of not just one man but a nation.  This film chronicles the life of Malcolm Little (X) from his early days as a zoot-suited hustler known as ""Detroit Red"" through to his spiritual maturity after his pilgrimage to Mecca, as a Black Muslim by the name of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz.  I do want to make mention that Washingtons performance was TOP-NOTCH and mezmerizing to say the least.  As X, Washington shows his growth from confused young one to racist and then finally to mature man of the people who understands what it really takes to lend a helping hand.  As a white man I will never be able to understand 'fully' what it feels like to be a minority, or appreciate what strength it must take to survive in our society, but what I appreciated about Malcolm's story is that he went from a bitter and angry man who swore white men were all devils to finally understanding that it wasn't the color of the mans skin that made him the devil but the color of his heart.  It's a shame it took him so long to understand that part of the equation for if he had known that beforehand he would have been a much greater help for his people.  This film is not forgiving nor does it candy coat anything.  As a white man who knew very little about Malcolm X beforehand I found myself loathing the man for quite a bit of the film for his views and beliefs contrasted starkly with mine.  I feel that to battle racism with more racism defeats the purpose of equality, so for me to see the man Malcolm became helped me to understand why he is regarded so highly because, while he started off on a wrong foot his desire to HELP his people resulted in him truly understand by which means he should go about it.  This film is perfectly exicuted on all fronts and shows the after effects of racism but also what we can do as people to help battle any further issues.  We are all created equal and appear one color before god so why should it be any different before one another.  What I appreciated about this film is it showed well that racism is not one sided, it's not a whites hate blacks thing for it plays the other way too, for Malcolm and his associates started off racist, hating a man for his skin color and they failed to help the black community and only served to create more problems...but as Malcolm learned, when putting aside the color of ones skin and seeing them for the person they are inside we can all make a difference and learn to live together as brothers and sisters.

It presents how he became as for he's most famous, his turbulances through childhood and into adulthood, his road to finding peace in the neighborhoods, and his leading to the Muslim religion.  The effects of racism in the US project themselves greatly, giving the film a more powerful theme.  Meanwhile, the passion and the struggle maintain their standing throughout, keeping audiences' attention through the entire three-hour film.Though all the actors give great performances, Washington and Bassett's state themselves the strongest.  Washington, in his Oscar-nominated performance (Best Actor), portrays Malcolm X beautifully through his emotions and his charisma.  As in every film, he proves that he's one of few modern-day actors who has pure talent.  Bassett portrays Malcolm X's, wife marvelously.  This underrated actress acts out her character's life hardtimes like she's actually living them.  Such acting strengths from them give this film the extra powerful theme that it deserves.Such film quality leads ""Malcolm X"" to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion.

334359,A23GFTVIETX7DS,6302787556,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[5, 7]","This bio-pic of the one-time Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X is over three hours of richly textured history enlivened by a virtuoso performance by Denzel Washington.  From Malcolm's earliest days as the son of an outspoken preacher to his assassination in front of his wife and children, the film traces the evolving philosophies of one of the most influential men of the civil rights movement.  When Malcolm legally changes his surname to X, we understand why.  When he declares that blacks and whites should be completely segregated, we know where he is coming from.  When he renounces his ties with the Nation of Islam and creates his own Islamic organization, we see why this was so necessary, despite the danger.  Director Spike Lee carefully constructs the story of a fallible, intelligent, and driven man that disputes much of the media package presented to white America at the time.You definitely need a comfortable chair for this marathon of a film.  Although it probably could have been edited down to less than three hours by condensing some of the earlier scenes, such omissions would have lessened the impact of Malcolm's early days as a man in search of pleasure and easy money, values that directly conflicted with his later, righteous persona.  Based on the ""autobiography"" written with Alex Haley, the screenplay manages to humanize a man who was often publicly demonized.I can't find fault with any of the performances - all were excellent - but Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife stands out.  The cinematography is sweeping, with a sepia palette for Malcolm's pre-Islamic days, and conveys in gorgeous, riveting images the power of the man and his cause. The special features, though worth watching, would be best left for another sitting, since the film demands introspection afterward.  Interestingly, Washington does such a fantastic job at channeling Malcolm that viewers will be amazed when watching actual footage.This is a must-see film for anyone with a serious interest in cinema, civil rights, and/or biopics.",5,The Complex Life of an Iconic Figure,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2038,"['bio-pic', 'one-time', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'leader', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'three', 'hours', 'richly', 'textured', 'history', 'enlivened', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'From', 'Malcolm', 'earliest', 'days', 'son', 'outspoken', 'preacher', 'assassination', 'front', 'wife', 'children', 'film', 'evolving', 'philosophies', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'men', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'When', 'Malcolm', 'legally', 'surname', 'X', 'understand', 'why', 'When', 'blacks', 'whites', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'segregated', 'know', 'where', 'coming', 'When', 'ties', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'own', 'Islamic', 'organization', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'necessary', 'danger', 'Director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'carefully', 'story', 'fallible', 'intelligent', 'driven', 'man', 'much', 'media', 'package', 'presented', 'white', 'America', 'time.You', 'definitely', 'need', 'comfortable', 'chair', 'marathon', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'condensing', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'such', 'omissions', 'would', 'have', 'lessened', 'impact', 'Malcolm', 'early', 'days', 'man', 'search', 'pleasure', 'easy', 'money', 'values', 'directly', 'conflicted', 'later', 'righteous', 'persona', 'Based', 'autobiography', 'written', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'screenplay', 'humanize', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'often', 'publicly', 'demonized.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'fault', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Malcolm', 'wife', 'out', 'cinematography', 'sweeping', 'sepia', 'palette', 'Malcolm', 'pre-Islamic', 'days', 'conveys', 'gorgeous', 'riveting', 'images', 'power', 'man', 'cause', 'special', 'features', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'left', 'sitting', 'film', 'introspection', 'afterward', 'Interestingly', 'Washington', 'fantastic', 'job', 'channeling', 'Malcolm', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'when', 'watching', 'actual', 'footage.This', 'must-see', 'film', 'anyone', 'serious', 'interest', 'cinema', 'civil', 'rights', 'and/or', 'biopics']",N/A
334360,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302787556,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Denzel Washington deftly captures the incendiary spirit of the civil rights leader who made many white Americans appreciate the proposed non-violent philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King more than they otherwise might have.Under Spike Lee's direction, this 1992 biopic gives audiences a formidable visual of the autobiography of Malcolm X as it was told to Alex Haley (who passed away the year of this film's release) circa 1964.The story begins with Malcolm's firey and slamming indictment of whites, and his narration of the troubling events of his early life, reflective of the impact of Jim Crow laws on him, his family, and nonwhites at large.His mother, Louise(Lonette McKee), a Grenadian, the product of a rape of her black mother by a white Englishman, is institutionalized after Malcolm's father, the Reverend Earl Little(Tommy Hollis)is murdered by white supremacists,  and young Malcolm and his siblings farmed out to various places under the supervision of a social worker named Miss Dunne(Karen Allen).After time at a school where he, as the only black child, is viewed as a mascot, and told he should only aspire to life as a manual laborer,Malcolm graduates to being a hard-core criminal on the streets of Boston, working as a pimp and hustler known as Dakota Red. His cohorts include a fellow hustler played by DelRoy Lindo, and Spike Lee himself appears as another cohort, Shorty. Kate Vernon plays Sophia, Malcolm's white, and married love interest.After an arrest and indictement for theft and burglary, the judge (William Kunstler) sentences Malcolm to nearly a decade in prison, where his inmate Baines, encourages him to read more,and while there is some dispute about his having done this in reality, introduces Malcom to the Islamic faith.Due to Baines'instruction of the history of the African people, Malcolm begins to challenge the prison Chaplain Gill's(Christopher Plummer) view of Jesus as a white man.After writing to the founder of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammed (the late Al Freeman, a civil rights worker in his own right), the still-incarcerated Malcolm  claims to have a vision of him. After his release, he goes to see him, and under his tuteledge, he becomes a member of the NOI, preaching, and reaching African Americans in the seedy  areas to which Jim Crow relegates them, or outside white churches where they stand outside and wait to be offered jobs as maids and butlers to whites, telling them that they can do and be better.In the meantime, he meets and marries a nursing student named Betty(Angela Bassett), and they raise two daughters.One dramatic confrontation  by  the NOI to see justice done on behalf of a wrongfully treated African American leaves quite an impression on an NYC police officer(Peter Boyle).A falling out with Elijah Muhammad occurs when Malcolm discovers that the man he had revered so blindly fathered children out of wedlock with more than one woman.CIA agents watch Malcolm closely due to his civil rights activism. A pilgrimage to Mecca where he encounters and worships Allah with followers of all races compels him to modify his views of whites. But the breach  with the NOI will eventually prove fatal.The blood of this martyr, however, will spawn greater things for future generations.Another civil rights activist, Ossie Davis reiterates the beautifully profound and touching eulogy he initially delivered for Malcolm X back in 1965 for this film.Steve White plays Brother Johnson, Ernest Lee Thomas is Malcom's good friend, Sidney, Jean Claude Lamarre is Benjamin 2X, Wendell Pierce plays Ben Thomas, Al Sharpton appears a s a street preacher, David Patrick Kelly plays Mr. Ostrowski, Michael Imperioli plays a reporter, Beatrice Wink plays an elderly lady who encourages Malcolm, and Mary Alice and Nelson Mandela remind the world of how Malcolm X's legacy continues to inspire.Two decades after this film's initial release, it is not

In between he manages to preach a message of integrity and self-determination that it as important today as it was when he first delivered it way back in the late 50s and early 60s.  Spike Lee's direction is controlled yet includes some remarkable moments - especially in the moments leading up to Malcolm's assassination, where it seems as if he had a premonition that something dire will to happen to him.

334369,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,6302787556,Earl Hazell,"[12, 16]","While studying acting at the American Theatre of Harlem with teacher  director Hal DeWindt a few years ago (a man who also knew Malcolm  personally) he challenged us all to a debate about Spike's film.  He  expressed dismay that Norman Jewison did not in fact get the rights to this  project that Spike fought so hard for.  He saw the movie as a whole deeply  flawed, missing the essential elements of a &quot;bio-pic&quot; beyond the  reported and witnessed events that make a figure stand out in one's mind,  or in history, and therefore, despite Denzel, despite Angela Bassett,  unsuccessful at portraying the &quot;Shining Black Prince&quot; (Ossie  Davis) of our modern day lives.As you can imagine, he was alone in  belieiving the film to be flawed.  I and my friends had long since come to  the conclusion that Spike Lee had made one of the most important films of  the latter half of the 20th Century with this, his masterpiece of  masterpieces, and that Denzel Washington had stepped into immortality with  his eerily accurate portrayal. but because of his immense knowledge of both  the medium of film and the subject matter, we listened on, and found  ourselves consistently challenged to understand the nature and the purpose  of film, and the actual characteristics of the art form of cinema.In  the end, the students and myself began to question what I think is now  still slowly becoming self evident:  Spike Lee created another art form  with this movie.  A general theme underpinning this representation of the  life of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz, aka Malcolm X, is actually missing.  And  yet the picture, structurally if nothing else, in its near pure devotion to  the Autobiography creates a transformational and transcendent portrait of  the subject that far exceeds the majority of most of the bio pics that have  ever been made (with the possible exception of THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD  with Max von Sydow as Jesus, and GHANDHI, with Ben Kingsley).  It seems as  if there was no need to underpin his perspective of Malcolm with an obvious  or personal unifying theme or message, because there is one already there-  just one so profound, so elemental, so transcendentally human, spiritual  and universal that it could only be expressed through the telling of the  story.  If Spike had followed the expectations of many in Hollywood and  throughout the Black communities of this country, the film probably would  have suffered immensely.  He tells the story of Malcolm in such a way as  to practically have the spirit of Malcolm telling you the story himself.  You feel as if you are becoming one with Alex Haley, Malcolm's co-writer of  his autobiography, while simultaneously becoming one with every emotion and  every transformational experience he had throughout his life- and the  ramifications on our world- practically unencumbered by his or someone  else's perspective, regardless of it being one of praise.This is not  just Spike Lee's Masterpiece.  This is not just a magnificent film, worthy  of five stars easily, and cheated ridiculously (albeit expectedly) during  the Oscars- even with the only drawback of Spike playing one of the  characters (the only time you are reminded that you are watching a movie).

The symbolism was not lost on me. Malcolm X spoke to more than just a generation. He speaks to us from the grave even now. The fire and passion that colored his early religious segregationist speech died out shortly before he was murdered, tempered by a tolerance the world would be forever denied.It is unclear what sort of mark Malcolm X WOULD have made on society had he lived, but what IS clear is that the influence he held on the civil rights movement is undeniable. His fire and the passions of men like Martin Luther King paved the way for some of the most historic moments in American history.But this movie doesn't stop with painting that well-known picture of Malcolm. We see Malcolm in his early days as a street hustler. We see him courting his beloved Betty and eventually fathering some four children. We see him as the protector and provider for his family. We see him as inquisitive and stern. Self-assured with a desire to know everything. Curious but confident. Influential but, at times, easily influenced by circumstances in which he found himself.Malcolm X was undoubtedly a profoundly flawed human being. But it is that same humanity that allowed him to reach such greatness. It is that humanity that we celebrate today, regardless of our own skin color.While I'm certain some literary license was taken where necessary, I do believe this movie was about as accurate a depiction of Malcolm X as you can make, without running the risk of being disrespectful to the memories of Malcolm and his beloved Betty.",5,A triumph....,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1656,"['end', 'movie', 'bunch', 'people', 'mostly', 'children', 'world', 'boldly', 'declaring', 'am', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'symbolism', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'spoke', 'more', 'just', 'generation', 'grave', 'even', 'now', 'fire', 'passion', 'colored', 'early', 'religious', 'segregationist', 'speech', 'died', 'out', 'shortly', 'was', 'murdered', 'tempered', 'tolerance', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'forever', 'denied.It', 'unclear', 'what', 'sort', 'mark', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'WOULD', 'have', 'made', 'society', 'had', 'lived', 'what', 'IS', 'clear', 'influence', 'held', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'undeniable', 'fire', 'passions', 'men', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'paved', 'way', 'most', 'historic', 'moments', 'American', 'history.But', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stop', 'painting', 'well-known', 'picture', 'Malcolm', 'see', 'Malcolm', 'early', 'days', 'street', 'hustler', 'see', 'courting', 'beloved', 'Betty', 'eventually', 'fathering', 'four', 'children', 'see', 'protector', 'provider', 'family', 'see', 'inquisitive', 'stern', 'Self-assured', 'desire', 'know', 'everything', 'Curious', 'confident', 'Influential', 'times', 'easily', 'influenced', 'circumstances', 'found', 'himself.Malcolm', 'X', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'profoundly', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'same', 'humanity', 'allowed', 'reach', 'such', 'greatness', 'humanity', 'celebrate', 'today', 'regardless', 'own', 'skin', 'color.While', ""'m"", 'certain', 'literary', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'where', 'necessary', 'do', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'can', 'make', 'running', 'risk', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'memories', 'Malcolm', 'beloved', 'Betty']",N/A

Without question, the portrayal by Denzel Washington of Malcolm X belongs with these two classic efforts.The screenplay closely follows Alex Haley's collaboration with Malcolm X on his autobiography, from his early days as a hustler and pimp, to his transformation and his rise to prominence in the Black Muslims and beyond.  In so doing, it traces much of the history of the twentieth century African American experienceAs another reviewer so inelegantly (and ungrammatically) put it, Malcolm Little sold drugs and women, robbed and lived in the underworld.  However, this recognizes far less than half of this compelling and incredible story.  This beginning was important only to underscore how far he ultimately came, and leads the viewer to wonder what would have happened had he not been murdered.Wonderful casting including Angela Bassett as his wife Betty, DelRoy Lindo and particularly Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad.

That was an important reminder of how both Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and other leaders were all converging on a similar, anti-racist (without being racist) philosophy of struggle.

334376,A29QA79VLQGHY6,6302787556,Flipper Campbell,"[1, 2]","Born of trouble, snubbed by the Oscars and faded from memories, Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" thunders back in a DVD set keyed to the 40th anniversary of its subject's death. The film did a better job of selling ""X"" hats than cinema tickets upon release in 1992, partly because of its running time of about 3 1/2 hours. Lee's ""labor of love"" feels at home on DVD, where viewers can pause on any of the film's organic chapter breaks, delineated by cinematographer Ernest Dickerson's dramatic shifts in visual style.The film comes remastered on the DVD, with generous and to-the-point extras. The feature stretches over both discs. Audio and widescreen images are first class, with almost no signs of wear or damage. (The DVD set replaces a vanilla single-disc version released five years ago.)Lee's stylish and eclectic vision holds up well, but Denzel Washington's performance as the polarizing black activist of the 1960s remains the reason to revisit ""Malcolm X."" Washington's portrayal is ""one of the best in American movies,"" Martin Scorsese maintains in the DVD extras.The extent to which Washington embodied his character becomes clear while viewing the DVD set's other outstanding Malcolm X film, the documentary of the same name from 1972.  The film relies on audio from Malcolm X's speeches for most of its narrative drive. There's no political correctness on display here, only the raw emotions of the era. ""The devil is the white man,"" Malcolm X informs his audience. ""By nature he is evil.""Lee enthusiastically introduces a handful of deleted scenes he said he didn't remember shooting. (""The DVD is one of the best things to ever happen to directors,"" he said.) One great scene shows Malcolm X toying with an overeager volunteer. ""People don't realize, he had a great sense of humor,"" Lee said.Joining the director on the commentary are longtime collaborators Dickerson, editor Barry Alexander Brown and costume designer Ruth Carter. Their talks were recorded separately and edited together reasonably well, but there are awkward moments -- as when Lee says something profound about Malcolm X's legacy and Dickerson immediately begins talking about light bulbs. The commentary rarely drags, and Dickerson and Carter make good use of the opportunity to address the specifics of their crafts.",4,Excellent,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2297,"['Born', 'trouble', 'snubbed', 'Oscars', 'faded', 'memories', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'thunders', 'back', 'DVD', 'set', 'keyed', '40th', 'anniversary', 'subject', 'death', 'film', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'selling', 'X', 'hats', 'cinema', 'tickets', 'release', '1992', 'partly', 'running', 'time', 'about', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'Lee', 'labor', 'love', 'feels', 'home', 'DVD', 'where', 'viewers', 'can', 'pause', 'film', 'organic', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'delineated', 'cinematographer', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'dramatic', 'shifts', 'visual', 'style.The', 'film', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'generous', 'to-the-point', 'extras', 'feature', 'discs', 'Audio', 'widescreen', 'images', 'are', 'first', 'class', 'almost', 'signs', 'wear', 'damage', 'DVD', 'set', 'vanilla', 'single-disc', 'version', 'released', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Lee', 'stylish', 'eclectic', 'vision', 'up', 'well', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'polarizing', 'black', 'activist', '1960s', 'reason', 'revisit', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Washington', 'portrayal', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'movies', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'DVD', 'extras.The', 'extent', 'Washington', 'embodied', 'character', 'becomes', 'clear', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'set', 'other', 'outstanding', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'film', 'documentary', 'same', 'name', '1972', 'film', 'relies', 'audio', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'speeches', 'most', 'narrative', 'drive', 'political', 'correctness', 'display', 'here', 'only', 'raw', 'emotions', 'era', 'devil', 'white', 'man', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'audience', 'nature', 'evil', 'Lee', 'enthusiastically', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'shooting', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'ever', 'happen', 'directors', 'said', 'One', 'great', 'scene', 'shows', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'toying', 'overeager', 'volunteer', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'Lee', 'said.Joining', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'longtime', 'collaborators', 'Dickerson', 'editor', 'Barry', 'Alexander', 'Brown', 'costume', 'designer', 'Ruth', 'Carter', 'talks', 'were', 'recorded', 'separately', 'edited', 'together', 'reasonably', 'well', 'are', 'awkward', 'moments', 'when', 'Lee', 'something', 'profound', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'legacy', 'Dickerson', 'immediately', 'talking', 'light', 'bulbs', 'commentary', 'rarely', 'drags', 'Dickerson', 'Carter', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'opportunity', 'address', 'specifics', 'crafts']",N/A

From pimping and number-running to becoming one of the most influential black men of our time, If I was granted a wish to bring someone back to this earth, it would surely be him.  I truly believe that had he lived another 30 or 40 years, he would have reshaped the role of black men.  He had the intelligence and the charisma to bring about the necessary change that the black community needs today starting with our men.  People respected and admired him, but at the same time others choose to look down on him, for standing up for what he believed in. As much as he tried to empower the black race, to instill any hope of integrity and self-worth in his people, ultimately it cost him his life.  What I admired most about him, was although he had been betrayed, he overcame his hostilities and anger, and continued to fight for justice and equality. He overcame his fear of the unknown, racism, and bigotry.

Denzel Washington is utterly amazing as Malcolm X, bringing the fire, passion, intelligence, and dignity the man had.  He should have won the Oscar.  Spike's direction is really assured, and he doesn't use too many visual tricks here, because the original story is so good.  Spike is also good as Shorty, one of Malcolm's friends from his crime days.  Originally, I thought Lee had just added the character to give himself a role, but Shorty is mentioned in The Autobiography of Malcolm X.  The Mecca scenes are mesmerizing and visually stunning, but it almost didn't happen.  Warner Brothers wanted Spike to shoot these scenes in Jersey (!) on the beaches there.  Spike ended up calling Warner's racist (which they weren't, they were just being a cheap studio), and it turned a lot of people off of this film and may have cost Spike and Denzel Oscars.  Denzel won for Training Day, which is a far worse film.  Regardless, this is a magnificent, balanced, and very thorough biopic of a fascinating man.  It's one of the better biopics made.

It distinguished Malcolm X from the Nation of Islam quite clearly and showed the amazing transformation from his beginnings as a poisoned hoodlum to a clear-minded speaker for Elijah Muhammad to a spiritual, independent leader and voice for the true Islam.  Particularly effective is the sequence involving his pilgrimage to Mecca at the time of his separation from the Nation of Islam in 1964.  Brilliant filmmaking and editing.Visually, this is brilliant, thanks to some beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, and very true-to-life costume and stage design.The acting is solid throughout.  Denzel Washington obviously deserves the most credit for his seamless presentation of Malcolm X, both visually and verbally.  He became Malcolm.  Kudos as well to Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassett, Al Freeman for some equally solid performances.If I had to pick a criticism, it is that, the rhetoric in the film is very heavy-handed and forced at several points in the movie.  For example, the police captain who says (artificially), ""That's too much power for one man to have"", or the alleged speculation that the CIA was involved (wiretappers remarking in an aside, ""compared to King, this guy's a lamb"")-- maybe they were, but it didn't really add to the story in the way that they presented this subplot, or the attempt to try to put a happy ending on the film (kids standing up and shouting, ""I am Malcolm X!"") just didn't resonate well with me.  Minor points, but worth noting.In contrast, however, the opening sequence, although very heavy as well (with Malcolm's strong rhetoric superimposed over a burning American flag and the Rodney King police beating in LA) worked well as a powerful point of departure for the controversy and image of Malcolm X and a brilliant image of the history of race relations in America.Some claim that the movie's length is excessive.  I disagree.  To reduce the complexity and history of Malcolm X to a convenient 1.5-2 hours would've been an injustice.  The movie, at 3+ hours, feels as seamless and as significant as another memorable film, Gandhi.At the time that this was released, I was put off by Spike Lee telling children to leave school to watch this film, and by the aggressive clothing marketing campaign as well (remember all the Malcolm X baseball caps in 1992?), and I equated it with self-promotion and corporate greed.  Unfortunately, that put off my seeing this until it came out on video (and later, DVD).Fortunately, this is 2007, and the film holds up very well today, and I'm assuming that it will stand on its own 50 years from now equally well, if not moreso.  Unfortunately, this is 2007, and I think that Malcolm X's message of self-determination and dignity from 40-45 years ago is largely unrealized.

334385,A19JYLHD94K94D,6302787556,Itamar Katz,"[3, 6]","Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before - it does, after all, span 200 minutes - and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself - but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's prot&eacute;g&eacute; gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie - and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.",5,An important film,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,2601,"['Malcolm', 'X', 'can', 'not', 'truthfully', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'one', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'best', 'films', 'was', 'important', 'step', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'one', 'career', 'biopic', 'Spike', 'fifth', 'full-length', 'feature', 'only', 'partial', 'sense', 'follow-up', 'greatest', 'classics', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'three', 'films', 'created', 'developed', 'unique', 'voice', 'made', 'name', 'one', 'most', 'prominent', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'US', 'Spike', 'own', 'voice', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'heard', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'usually', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'trademarks', 'are', 'tough', 'point', 'out', 'reason', 'first', 'time', 'career', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'took', 'step', 'back', 'not', 'dominant', 'personality', 'film', 'dominant', 'personality', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Spike', 'let', 'Malcolm', 'voice', 'be', 'heard', 'film', 'louder', 'anything', 'else.So', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'less', 'work', 'art', 'more', 'statement', 'Spike', 'previous', 'films', 'scope', 'immensely', 'larger', 'anything', 'did', 'span', '200', 'minutes', 'therefore', 'naturally', 'not', 'tight', 'focused', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Spike', 'head', 'very', 'treated', 'symbolism', 'subtlety', 'films', 'was', 'therefore', 'natural', 'important', 'progression', 'logical', 'continuation', 'movies', 'proved', 'more', 'one', 'voice', 'biopic', 'matter', 'docu-drama', 'most', 'important', 'factor', 'director', 'care', 'subject', ""'m"", 'yet', 'see', 'director', 'who', 'more', 'passionate', 'subject', 'Mr.', 'Lee.Malcolm', 'X', 'huge', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Angela', 'Bassette', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'Jr.', 'harrowing', 'performance', 'Muslim', 'extremist', 'Elijah', 'Muhammad', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'still', 'entirely', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'therefore', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Spike', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'gave', 'lifetime', 'performance', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'surpassed', 'gut-wrenching', 'portrayal', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'unfortunately', 'lost', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'based', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation.Although', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'not', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'best', 'film', 'important', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'good', 'thing', 'Spike', 'was', 'one', 'do', 'More', 'impressive', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'story', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'heard', 'biopic', 'film', 'truly', 'cultured', 'intelligent', 'person', 'needs', 'watch']",N/A

Pouliot,"[2, 3]","I read Alex Haley's ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" as a youth, long before I could really understand its flow of street life, drugs prison, and black nationalism. Yet I recall how X's passion, eloquence and honesty permeated every page. Spike Lee's ""X"" is a superb rendering of the bio. Denzel Washington is the ideal man to carry off X's simmering rage, sense of justice and golden tongue.The film gives us X's life - from his family life in racist Nebraska, through his hustling years in Boston and New York, through prison, conversion to Islam and eventual assassination at the Audubon Ballroom in 1965. Whether you agree with his views or not, there are few heroes like the man X became - courageous, single-minded and dedicated to the betterment of his people. Denzel gets him just right. Whether as a shy youth getting his hair conked for the first time, or a small time hood bluffing his way into leadership, or as a charismatic preacher wrestling with betrayal and uncertainty, Washington's portrayal is pitch perfect and believable. The film does not shy away from X's controversial and inflammatory rhetoric. His ""Chickens coming home to roost"" comment after JFK's death statement is well known; Spike Lee gives more context to the remark, but it still stings. And calling Martin Luther King, Jr. an ""Uncle Tom"" horribly misrepresents King's approach and his courage. But the film does not fail to leaven the fiery rhetoric with the cool of X's love for his family and his race, and his capacity to learn. His hajj to Mecca shortly before his death opened his eyes to the possibility that all men are brothers under heaven.While, at one time,  X would have dismissed this white boy as unhelpful to his cause, I was impressed by the power of his words and the depth of his commitment. And I am impressed by how Spike Lee negotiated the twin shoals of hagiography and criticism to show this man of complexity. ""Malcolm X"" is a work of love for a man who continually sought justice and the truth. It subverts the simple tale that X was a bogeyman of violence and hate. It's a story that needs to be told more widely, along those of those of safer.

The viewer's heart both breaks and flames as the ten year old Malcolm protests, ""I get the best grades in class,"" only to be answered by the smarmy, smug white schoolmaster, ""Yes, but you're a ni**er. And a lawyer is no proper job for a ni**er. Why don't you become a carpenter? Jesus was a carpenter, you know.""It is little wonder that the light-skinned red-haired Malcolm (whose mother was a Grenadine, and three-quarters white), turned his frustrated brilliance toward a sordid life of crime and drugs, making his mark in Harlem as ""Detroit Red,"" a successful scam artist and pimp. A term in jail turned Malcolm around, converting him into a Black Muslim. Denzel Washington plays the ever-changing Malcolm with passion.At first totally hypnotized by the Nation of Islam message that all devils are white and all whites are devils, Malcolm became a firebrand leader and spokesman for the African-American community, calling for their liberation ""By any means necessary!"" at exactly the moment that his contemporary, Dr. Martin Luther King called for black liberation through nonviolence. Although the two men seem to be opposites, they are far more alike than circumstance paints them. King figures only passingly in the film, but King's philosophical evolution was mirrored by Malcolm's, who likewise began moving toward a muscular nonviolence as he moved away from the parochial and exclusivist position of the NOI, and adopted a more global and cosmopolitan worldview of Islam as a unifying and all-inclusive force in the world.His assassination (by extremists) in 1965 robbed the world of a man who was about to become a spokesperson for universal human dignity. Spike Lee's film is both a record of and a memorial to, Malcolm X, who he was, and who he was becoming.

Black angst, extreme predjudice, and injustice reflected through the Rodney King beating and racial tension of the '90's, and it's nothing new, because Spike Lee takes it from there. He tells us another story that happened almost 30 years prior. The story of a man, a human, a hero, a sinner and a saint, Malcolm X.After seeing &quot;Bamboozled&quot; and reading the &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; by Malcolm X with Alex Haley, I thought &quot;X&quot; would be worth a look, and it really was. Spike Lee tells X's life story with amazing detail and realism. He does not gloss anything over because this is a true story. The 3+ hours that follow are absolutely astounding. Malcolm X was a man who was led on a road of strict conformity to Islam. His ideas were molded and shaped by his own experiences into black supremacy and pride. And just as he had realized his own grievances and was pushing towards a brotherhood of blacks and whites alike, the disidence he had caused amoung he own people finally caught up with him. But for his efforts to create a sense of unity and pride amoung his people, he will be a legend, a hero, a human, and a man in the greatest sense of the word.Denzel Washington unleashes a full calibre performance as X, and Angela Basset does an equally performance. It's a shame that &quot;X&quot; failed to do as well as it did on screen at the Academy Awards, but it can be said that Spike Lee is definitely a man with a message. There is no other filmmaker today that captures the tension, prejudices, life and culture of the African-American lifestyle and all the issues and pertenance to our contemporary society as Spike Lee. Whether it's &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, or &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, Spike Lee captures on film the multi-faceted feelings of the people he represents and the feelings of our nation.

At the beginning of the movie, before Malcolm becomes politically aware, we see Malcolm and his friends, seemingly happy, emulating the larger societies dress and mannerisms. Is this a statement about the times? Personally, I noticed a parallel between these fawning citizens of yesteryear, and contemporary, going along, happy whites of today -er of 1992.Was this Lees point?Malcolm himself becomes politically aware, and thinks back about his relationships with whites. Realizing, at best, he's simply been used by them. He decides to join the Black Muslims. The movie follows him on his rise to prominence, ""That's too much power for one man to have"".I remember when this movie came out. Everyone was wearing Malcolm X T-shirts and Malcolm X hats. I'd never seen anything like it before. Malcolm X's influence and legacy loom larger than ever. Certainly large in 1992.What is Malcolm X's legacy tho?Was he just a tool used to pacify the underclass - when they wouldn't trust the media, the government, academia, their women, or whites?Is his legacy the opposite? One of keeping resistance alive. Certainly people of all kinds seem angrier now than ever. Do the powers-that-be simply think we work harder when we're angry? Or is resistance needed now more than ever?Is Malcolm X's religious vision actually the most true worship of God, and is this his legacy?Did Malcolm X create his own legacy. . . ?In the movie, Lee focuses intensely on the scene where Malcolm and his friend (shorty?), and their girlfriends, play a game of Russian Roulette that Malcolm forces on them.

His underlying mission, to lift the social oppression of the black race, was a commendable one, yes. Racism, primarily by whites toward blacks, which remains an issue today, was even more of a problem during his lifetime; the end of which happened to coincide with the end of the Civil Rights Movement. But he too was a hardcore racist; a brainwashed follower of ""The Honorable"" Elijah Muhammad, The Nation Of Islam and all their ridiculous anti-white philosophies; for a long time.The fact that Malcolm X may have began to shed his bias during his final chapters; it wasn't until he made his ""required"" pilgrimage to Mecca that he realized not all white people are ""devils""; isn't good enough. Accurate or not, Spike Lee has done a remarkable job of visually depicting the life of a man I may not have otherwise cared enough to learn about, but the man we're supposed to be praising comes across as not much more than a buffoon. As educated as he is when it comes to the English language; he studied every word in the ""white man's"" dictionary; he doesn't seem to be much of a thinker in the way of general logic, the kind of logic Martin Luther King had that says you can't end racism with racism.marcellee.com",4,4 of 5,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,1445,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'joint', 'neutral', 'biography', 'three', 'hours', 'suddenly', 'transitioning', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'really', 'present', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'legacy', 'celebration', 'underlying', 'mission', 'lift', 'social', 'oppression', 'black', 'race', 'was', 'commendable', 'one', 'yes', 'Racism', 'primarily', 'whites', 'blacks', 'issue', 'today', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'problem', 'lifetime', 'end', 'happened', 'coincide', 'end', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'too', 'was', 'hardcore', 'racist', 'brainwashed', 'follower', 'Honorable', 'Elijah', 'Muhammad', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'ridiculous', 'anti-white', 'philosophies', 'long', 'time.The', 'fact', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'may', 'have', 'began', 'shed', 'bias', 'final', 'chapters', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'required', 'pilgrimage', 'Mecca', 'realized', 'not', 'white', 'people', 'are', 'devils', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Accurate', 'not', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'visually', 'depicting', 'life', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'otherwise', 'cared', 'enough', 'learn', 'man', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'praising', 'across', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'buffoon', 'As', 'educated', 'when', 'English', 'language', 'studied', 'word', 'white', 'man', 'dictionary', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'thinker', 'way', 'general', 'logic', 'kind', 'logic', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'had', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end', 'racism', 'racism.marcellee.com']",N/A

It details how he came up from being a petty street hustler to the Nation Of Islam most outspoken character. It also deals with the events that lead to his assassination.Denzel Washington's best performance was here and what does he win an award for? Training Day. Now do you see why they say these awards mean nothing? Denzel role as Malcolm X is just as flawless as Will Smith's role of Muhammed Ali. I still get goosebumps when I hear him speak and Ive seen a lot of Malcolm X's actual speeches. Angela Bassett did a great job as his wife and the supporting actors and actresses were great too. My gripe is the certain inaccuracies in the movie and the idea that the Nation Of Islam has something to do with his death is debatable. As far as I'm concerned those guys were flunkies for those people in high places. If not by signature then by nature.

The other side - the violence and militancy, the hate that hate produced - was only dimly heard, seemingly much farther away.  It was a great shock for me to read Haley's autobio, but utterly fascinating and important to understand who we Americans are.Spike Lee has taken the Haley version and grafted almost all of the important incidents into a single long film.  In my viewing, it is almost completely successful in evoking an extraordinary life.  You get the factual outline, and better yet the feeling for what it was like in X's times.From the opening, when he is swaggering in a zoot suit with Shorty, to his seething rage at the memory of how his family was dissolved by race hatred and lynching.  It is superlatively acted by Washington, who is one of the greatest actors alive.  You then follow X into crime, a dissolute life style, prison, redemption, the acceptance of fundamentalist mind programming, to a final stage of questioning it all.  I completely believed the portrait of how he grew into all of these roles with extraordinary ease as well as the mercurial energy of a genius.Lee succeeds in making X a near archetype for the American experience for blacks but also for the entire society, which we must admit to ourselves is intimately inter-related.  These are deep questions, and Lee is content to provoke, in my viewing, leaving the audience vexed and interested in finding out more.  It is positively Brechtian in ambition, and here it truly works here.  And there is a raft of extraordinary personalities who appear and re-appear, enabling us to see where they were able to go and what they could do.There are a few things that mar with the simplifications of the film medium.  For example, there is the fate of the girl Laura, who is in the Haley book.  While in real life she disappears from view though we learn what happened to her,  you see X walk by her in his Moslem guise as she is about to service a client in a doorway.  Other incidents are too succinct, such as his dismissal of the idealistic white girl who asked how she might help (which he later pointedly regretted), but then Lee had only 3 hours and there is so much to tell.Warmly recommended.  X tells us all a lot about who we are as Americans and even as humans.  I believe he continues to fascinate because he died at a moment when he was ripe with potential to change.

The best one can hope for is that a point of view stops short of propaganda, that it doesn't fall prey to a white-washing, or black-washing, of a story that has already taken on the stuff that mythic dreams are made of.  Lee's movie and Washington's performance are both so powerful that one can easily forgive many of the broad strokes, enjoy the film, and evaluate the sum effect--which at least has the potential to bring about a fuller understanding of race and religion than the daily political-media noise to which most of us are otherwise continually exposed.Malcolm comes across as a practicing idealist, a man of the highest integrity and most rigorous discipline capable of realizing his vision of a brotherhood whose awareness of its lineage will bring forth the very best moral intentions and practices.  Although the problematic divisions of Islam into Sunni (Malcolm's alignment) and Shia, along with the distinctions between Islam and the Nation of Islam, are merely suggested and the break with Elijah Muhammad due to the latter's ""woman problem"" is glossed over, in the end the movie's importance rises above attention to such details.  Malcolm is a hero, a role model and, most importantly, the inspiration for a meaningful, potentially constructive, mythic legacy that, like similar narratives centered on Lincoln or JFK, cannot outsize its human source beyond the point of credibility.If one accepts the current tendency of the population to bifurcate its citizenry into black and white, the hope has to be that those who see themselves as black will see in Malcolm's separatism not segregation and exclusionary practices but a rallying cry to accept one's identity as a full-fledged member of a human race empowered to pursue and achieve excellence regardless of (not because of) color.  What Malcolm perceived as a flaw (his white genes transmitted by rape through his mother) became, after all, his strength.  As for those members of the audience who identify themselves as white, the hope has to be that the uneasy feelings provoked by Malcolm's stance of separatism will bring about self-recognition of the assault to personal worth brought about not simply by exclusionary practices or the publicized statements of a ""social radical,"" but by generations of whites practicing ""Biblically sanctioned,"" legislatively licensed segregation.At its best, cinema has the potential to be a reflective screen, a mirror of our social and private lives, exposing the best and worst in us all.  Individually, few figures in America's history have so effectively mirrored ""white America"" to itself as Malcolm X.  Together, the two--film and Malcolm--make for a potent mix, a powerful chemistry that, we can only hope, will continue to exert its clarifying powers on the diversely colored stage that is being set for the coming year's test of a nation's ability to practice the democracy that it professes to prize above all else.",5,Still germane,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,3092,"['Epic', 'films', 'influential', 'martyrs', 'who', 'young', 'subject', 'Lincoln', 'JFK', 'Malcolm', 'rarely', 'attract', 'attention', 'hold', 'interest', 'best', 'one', 'can', 'hope', 'point', 'view', 'stops', 'short', 'propaganda', ""n't"", 'fall', 'prey', 'white-washing', 'black-washing', 'story', 'already', 'taken', 'stuff', 'mythic', 'dreams', 'are', 'made', 'Lee', 'movie', 'Washington', 'performance', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'forgive', 'many', 'broad', 'strokes', 'enjoy', 'film', 'evaluate', 'sum', 'effect', 'least', 'potential', 'bring', 'about', 'fuller', 'understanding', 'race', 'religion', 'daily', 'political-media', 'noise', 'most', 'are', 'otherwise', 'continually', 'exposed.Malcolm', 'across', 'practicing', 'idealist', 'man', 'highest', 'integrity', 'most', 'rigorous', 'discipline', 'capable', 'realizing', 'vision', 'brotherhood', 'awareness', 'lineage', 'will', 'bring', 'forth', 'very', 'best', 'moral', 'intentions', 'practices', 'problematic', 'divisions', 'Islam', 'Sunni', 'Malcolm', 'alignment', 'Shia', 'distinctions', 'Islam', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'are', 'merely', 'suggested', 'break', 'Elijah', 'Muhammad', 'due', 'latter', 'woman', 'problem', 'glossed', 'end', 'movie', 'importance', 'rises', 'attention', 'such', 'details', 'Malcolm', 'hero', 'role', 'model', 'most', 'importantly', 'inspiration', 'meaningful', 'potentially', 'constructive', 'mythic', 'legacy', 'similar', 'narratives', 'centered', 'Lincoln', 'JFK', 'can', 'not', 'outsize', 'human', 'source', 'point', 'credibility.If', 'one', 'current', 'tendency', 'population', 'bifurcate', 'citizenry', 'black', 'white', 'hope', 'be', 'who', 'see', 'black', 'will', 'see', 'Malcolm', 'separatism', 'not', 'segregation', 'exclusionary', 'practices', 'rallying', 'cry', 'accept', 'one', 'identity', 'full-fledged', 'member', 'human', 'race', 'empowered', 'pursue', 'achieve', 'excellence', 'regardless', 'not', 'color', 'What', 'Malcolm', 'perceived', 'flaw', 'white', 'genes', 'transmitted', 'rape', 'mother', 'became', 'strength', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'identify', 'white', 'hope', 'be', 'uneasy', 'feelings', 'provoked', 'Malcolm', 'stance', 'separatism', 'will', 'bring', 'self-recognition', 'assault', 'personal', 'worth', 'brought', 'not', 'simply', 'exclusionary', 'practices', 'publicized', 'statements', 'social', 'radical', 'generations', 'whites', 'practicing', 'Biblically', 'sanctioned', 'legislatively', 'licensed', 'segregation.At', 'best', 'cinema', 'potential', 'be', 'reflective', 'screen', 'mirror', 'social', 'private', 'lives', 'exposing', 'best', 'worst', 'Individually', 'few', 'figures', 'America', 'history', 'have', 'so', 'effectively', 'mirrored', 'white', 'America', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Together', 'two', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'make', 'potent', 'mix', 'powerful', 'chemistry', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'exert', 'clarifying', 'powers', 'diversely', 'colored', 'stage', 'being', 'set', 'coming', 'year', 'test', 'nation', 'ability', 'practice', 'democracy', 'prize', 'else']",N/A

I wouldn't even have wanted to cross paths with him. But what happened to him later on in his life and the change that he underwent is one of the most influential and inspiring true stories that have ever touched my heart. When Malcolm accepted Islam, even though he entered this great religion from a wrong and very misleading angle, it was the beginning of a legendary figure's emergence into the American conscience and a beacon for all that stood up to the oppression and injustice that America was doing to its own people. This legendary person's name was Malcolm X, or Hajj Malek Shabbaz, may God bless him.Spike Lee, the director of Do The Right Thing, brings Malcolm X to the big screen with Denzel Washington portraying the late Black leader. The movie takes you through Malcolm's turbulent childhood, his upbringing into a young con man, drug abuser, and gang leader. It was his 6 or so years spent in jail where Malcolm was introduced to the rising Nation of Islam lead by Elijah Muhammed from one of his inmates. Malcolm educated himself in jail and turned out to be what many never expected; an outspoken, strong and very intelligent spokesperson for the Nation and the struggles of the black community across America. The movie successfully reveals the inner conflicts between Malcolm and the Nation, and the result of Malcolm breaking away to become an independant activist. The film also does Malcolm's story justice by showing his pilgrimage to Mecca - pilgrimage is known as Hajj in Arabic and is considered the fifth and final pillar of Islam. It was this special visit to Mecca where Malcolm was exposed to mainstream Islam - the true picture of Islam unlike the misleading teachings of Elijah Muhammed and the Nation of Islam. The movie ends with the disturbing assassination of Malcolm and a piece narrated by Ossie Davis featuring pictures of the real Malcolm X and a scene with Nelson Mandela giving his thoughts on Malcolm.The movie is based on the bestselling book 'Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Malcolm X himself as told to Alex Haley.I do recommend reading this book to get a wider picture of Malcolm's life and realization of mainstream Islam.One of the best movies I have seen.A",5,Malcolm X: May God accept him in paradise,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,2303,"['Malcolm', 'Little', 'a.k.a', 'Red', 'was', 'not', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'be', 'seen', 'hanging', 'around', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'wanted', 'cross', 'paths', 'what', 'happened', 'later', 'life', 'change', 'underwent', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'inspiring', 'true', 'stories', 'have', 'ever', 'touched', 'heart', 'When', 'Malcolm', 'accepted', 'Islam', 'even', 'entered', 'great', 'religion', 'wrong', 'very', 'misleading', 'angle', 'was', 'beginning', 'legendary', 'figure', 'emergence', 'American', 'conscience', 'beacon', 'stood', 'up', 'oppression', 'injustice', 'America', 'was', 'doing', 'own', 'people', 'legendary', 'person', 'name', 'was', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Hajj', 'Malek', 'Shabbaz', 'may', 'God', 'bless', 'him.Spike', 'Lee', 'director', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'big', 'screen', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'portraying', 'late', 'Black', 'leader', 'movie', 'Malcolm', 'turbulent', 'childhood', 'upbringing', 'young', 'con', 'man', 'drug', 'abuser', 'gang', 'leader', 'was', '6', 'so', 'years', 'spent', 'jail', 'where', 'Malcolm', 'was', 'introduced', 'rising', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'lead', 'Elijah', 'Muhammed', 'one', 'inmates', 'Malcolm', 'educated', 'jail', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'many', 'never', 'expected', 'outspoken', 'strong', 'very', 'intelligent', 'spokesperson', 'Nation', 'struggles', 'black', 'community', 'America', 'movie', 'successfully', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Malcolm', 'Nation', 'result', 'Malcolm', 'breaking', 'away', 'become', 'independant', 'activist', 'film', 'also', 'Malcolm', 'story', 'justice', 'showing', 'pilgrimage', 'Mecca', 'pilgrimage', 'known', 'Hajj', 'Arabic', 'considered', 'fifth', 'final', 'pillar', 'Islam', 'was', 'special', 'visit', 'Mecca', 'where', 'Malcolm', 'was', 'exposed', 'mainstream', 'Islam', 'true', 'picture', 'Islam', 'misleading', 'teachings', 'Elijah', 'Muhammed', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'assassination', 'Malcolm', 'piece', 'narrated', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'featuring', 'pictures', 'real', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'scene', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'giving', 'thoughts', 'Malcolm.The', 'movie', 'based', 'bestselling', 'book', ""'Autobiography"", 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'told', 'Alex', 'Haley.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'get', 'wider', 'picture', 'Malcolm', 'life', 'realization', 'mainstream', 'Islam.One', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen.A']",N/A

I think that one of the most obvious lesson wa that Hollywood wasn't teady for a film of this magnitude. Demonstrated by Denzel Washinton's snub at the Oscars ( Best Actor ) , for his piercing , haunting , and unforgettable portrayal of Malcom X. The film , based on the Alex Haley book , entitled "" The Autobiography of Malcom X "" , chronicles the life of Malcom Little ,from a poor negro child, raised in the openly racist and oppressive time of the 1920's and 1960's , turned hoodlum ,turned convict , turned redeemed soul , turned political activist. This film is very poignant, as it tells the story of one of the most influencial , charismatic , and feared revolutionaries of his generation. Spike Lee, does a phenominal job at capturing the essence of this story , with affection , direction , conviction and sensativity. As a matter of fact , this is by far the best feature film , the director has put out. Whereas , Speilberg has his "" Jaws "" , Lucas has his "" Star Wars "" , and so Spike Lee has his signature piece in "" Malcom X "". With riveting supporting performances by such notable actors as Delroy Lindo , Theresa Randle , Angela Bassett , Albert Hall , Al Freenman Jr. , Lonette Mckee ,Kate Vernon, Christopher Plummer , Giancarlo Esposito , and a host of other cameos. Although largely snubbed by the Oscars , "" Malcom X "" was nominated for 2 ( Best Actor: Denzel Washington , and Best Costume Designer : Ruth E. Carter ). One good footnote is that Denzel Washington did win Best Actor by the Golden Globes , aka : Oscar's little brother. The cinematography is fabulous and the score is memorable. This is truly a film that all the crew and cast loved passionately and it shows in the final product. "" Malcom X "" is a very poignant and important film.

334460,A3JEV3M4L5R2OL,6302787556,T. S. C.,"[1, 1]","I watched this film years ago, and felt moved by it. I recently bought it on Amazon and just watched it last night. First off, I might say that the film is a long one but needs to be, in the same way Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi' is long and David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' is long; it needed to be long to convey this highly interesting man's life and all the complexities and even contradictions of Malcolm X's life. Why should a white working class person from England really be interested in a black working class guy from America anyway? Well, why not? Malcolm X the film stands comparison with the two films I just mentioned because Malcolm X is an important person in the history of civil rights in America and perhaps the whole world.Malcolm, in his life, went from being a tough thug and former jailbird, into a civil rights leader for his people, with an extremely sharp brain and some of the most uncompromising and electrifying speeches you've ever heard. It's been said that Martin Luther King was a man of peace and Malcolm was a man of war, but I feel that both men were two sides of the same coin, and when it really boils down to it, were 'fighting' for the same thing, which was emancipation for black people in America, all kinds of emancipation, certainly economic emancipation.There is a kind of feeling that comes to me from the time of Malcolm X; America was changing and all kinds of people, not just black people, were beginning to feel that they deserved a bigger slice of the pie and demanding fairness and equality and perhaps most importantly economic justice so that it wasn't just white middle and upper class people who could live well and prosper but everybody. The same things were probably happening in Britain but on a more understated level. For me quite simply, when black people and other ethnic minorities stand up for their rights and their social justice, it can also be about ALL people who are oppressed, in one way or the other, fighting for their rights. In America, it was much about racism and probably still is, in Britain, although I won't tell you there isn't racism here because there is, it can also be about class. In Britain, like many other countries, certain white people are allowed to prosper, perhaps because they have been to private schools and they talk with the 'right' accent and know the 'right' people and are connected or have influence in one way or the other; if you aren't part of this clique you are meant to accept it and fight for the crumbs of the rich man's table. Malcolm X teaches me that we all have dignity and we all have the right to challenge oppression wherever we find it, and especially in our own lives.So, the movie. A really good film, notwithstanding its length, and one that I could watch again and again. Denzel Washington is absolutely convincing as Malcolm X and is as usual enormously charismatic in the role. The film goes from Malcolm's early life to the very end, where he is assassinated whilst giving a speech. It is a sad end of an amazing life. As the film, and Malcolm's life progresses, there is the feeling that Malcolm is shedding his skin; he sheds the skin of his life of crime to re-educate himself in prison and then becomes an apostle of the honourable Elijah Muhammad; he sheds his skin again after feeling badly let down by Muhammad, and becomes a free spirit. He goes to Mecca and finds that all kinds of people, of all different colours including white, are all worshipping together. I feel this made a strong impact on him and he began to see all humanity, not just black people, as worthy of concern, love and consideration.In the racial climate of America in those times, it could be easy to understand that someone black would despise white people and the mainstream white culture of America; it is then good to say that Malcolm X at the end of his life changed his perspective and had the courage of his doubts and convictions and began to see the bigger picture.

But the country needed a Malcolm X, and I started out as a  white teenage hater of him, until reading the autobiography he published with Alex Haley. His death at the hands of other Black Muslims who stayed loyal to the disappointing Elijah Muhammed was indeed a tragedy, not equivalent to the loss of both Kennedys and Dr. King, but first, and more important in retrospect than it seemed at the time. And now that the USA is at war with certain kinds of Muslims, but not particularly the black American ones we feared in the late '50's, it is clear that Malcolm is deserving of a big screen epic biography.

The likeness that Denzel Washington shares with Minister Malcolm is astonishir, the way he speaks, acts and looks is just uncanny to the original man himself.Incase you don't know who Malcolm X or have just heard about him or the movie from a friend then let me give you a bit of a background. Malcolm Little grew up in the streets of Harlem New York with his mother and father and all his brothers, his father was murdered by the Klu Klux Klan but nobody was brought to justice infact it was claimed his fathers death was suicide. Shortly after the death of his father his mother started to break down and become extremely depressed and was admitted into a mental health home. Malcolm and his brothers where split up into foster homes and Malcolm while attending school one day was told by his favourite teacher that he couldn't be a lawyer because he was a ""Negro"" which as you can imagine this hurt Malcolm extensively.As a teenager Malcolm turned to a life of Hustling and crime and along with a friend of his ""Shorty"" where thrown in prison for 10 years. During his time in prison he was introduced to the Nation of Islam by his brother and was told to write to The Messenger Elijah Muhammed. This religion taught how the black people are constantly pushed down by the white man and how they are degraded and embarassed beyond belief.This education brought out a fury in Malcolm that he had never felt and on his release from prison he immediately became a follower of the Messenger Elijah Muhammed and a preacher for the Nation Of Islam. With his strong words which to some where racist and promoted white hate immediately created a media storm and Malcolm became instantly a world wide political figure admired by some detested by many.During his time in the Nation Of Islam Malcolm became aware that there was corruption around him and that his peers where going behind his back to Elijah complaining that he was bringing bad press to the NOI.I won't tell you what happens next as that will spoil the film for you and i want you to see it because it is amazing and nothing like. 3 hours long but every minute will keep you captivated and your eyes glued to the screen.",5,A Political Materpiece Based On A True Hero,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2253,"['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'always', 'have', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'likeness', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'shares', 'Minister', 'Malcolm', 'astonishir', 'way', 'acts', 'just', 'uncanny', 'original', 'man', 'himself.Incase', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'have', 'just', 'heard', 'movie', 'friend', 'then', 'let', 'give', 'bit', 'background', 'Malcolm', 'Little', 'grew', 'up', 'streets', 'Harlem', 'New', 'York', 'mother', 'father', 'brothers', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'Klu', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'nobody', 'was', 'brought', 'justice', 'infact', 'was', 'claimed', 'fathers', 'death', 'was', 'suicide', 'Shortly', 'death', 'father', 'mother', 'started', 'break', 'down', 'become', 'extremely', 'depressed', 'was', 'admitted', 'mental', 'health', 'home', 'Malcolm', 'brothers', 'where', 'split', 'up', 'foster', 'homes', 'Malcolm', 'attending', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'told', 'favourite', 'teacher', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'lawyer', 'was', 'Negro', 'can', 'imagine', 'hurt', 'Malcolm', 'teenager', 'Malcolm', 'turned', 'life', 'Hustling', 'crime', 'friend', 'Shorty', 'where', 'thrown', 'prison', '10', 'years', 'time', 'prison', 'was', 'introduced', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'brother', 'was', 'told', 'write', 'Messenger', 'Elijah', 'Muhammed', 'religion', 'taught', 'how', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'constantly', 'pushed', 'down', 'white', 'man', 'how', 'are', 'degraded', 'embarassed', 'belief.This', 'education', 'brought', 'out', 'fury', 'Malcolm', 'had', 'never', 'felt', 'release', 'prison', 'immediately', 'became', 'follower', 'Messenger', 'Elijah', 'Muhammed', 'preacher', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'strong', 'words', 'where', 'racist', 'promoted', 'white', 'hate', 'immediately', 'created', 'media', 'storm', 'Malcolm', 'became', 'instantly', 'world', 'wide', 'political', 'figure', 'admired', 'detested', 'many.During', 'time', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'Malcolm', 'became', 'aware', 'was', 'corruption', 'peers', 'where', 'going', 'back', 'Elijah', 'complaining', 'was', 'bringing', 'bad', 'press', 'NOI.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'next', 'will', 'spoil', 'film', 'i', 'want', 'see', 'amazing', 'nothing', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'minute', 'will', 'keep', 'captivated', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen']",N/A
