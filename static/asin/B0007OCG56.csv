884608,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007OCG56,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[16, 27]","Oh, what a massive disappointment James L. Brooks has created.  Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments.  Sadly, this never did happen.  With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story.  There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends.  Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle.  There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them.  Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, ""Well, at least that was resolved"".  It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seatbelts to anyone watching.  With all these themes and elements converging into a very unclimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of ""wha..."" You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll.  Who was the true protagonist to the story?  Who was the central focus?  What were the major themes that I should have been watching?  There were so many negative ""who"" and ""what"" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed.  Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders.  Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing.  Well, let me tell you ... it was noticeable.  Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film.  While it is obvious that he can play an ""every man"" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with.  The scene in which he is asked to cry is ... well ... hysterically pathetic.  There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as ""bland"".  I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out.  Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top.  There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying.  This does not help progress the story well either.  Vega added nothing more than a ""cute"" element that honestly wasn't needed at all.  The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine.  She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish.  This hurt this film tremendously.  Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value.  It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end.  This did not make for good cinematic viewing.Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture.  Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong.  One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera.  There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion.  The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them.  Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film.  This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top.  Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements.  Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears.  While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.Grade: * out of *****",1,You didn't set the bar that high.,1115769600,"05 11,

884612,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007OCG56,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I'm not going to lay out the fact that James L. Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.I came at this from a different approach.Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.",3,A little lost in translation...,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,3484,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lay', 'out', 'fact', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'directors', 'ever', 'walk', 'planet', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'really', 'most', 'complaints', 'directed', 'Spanglish', 'are', 'based', 'fact', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'reputation', 'Brooks.I', 'came', 'different', 'approach.Instead', 'looking', 'director', 'came', 'looking', 'star', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Now', 'Adam', 'have', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'early', 'comedic', 'work', 'opinion', 'was', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'still', 'uproarious', 'ride', 'recent', 'work', 'repetitive', 'crude', 'slivers', 'greatness', 'achieved', 'most', 'notably', 'when', 'working', 'strong', 'co-stars', 'was', 'case', ""'50"", 'First', 'Dates', 'recently', 'become', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'see', 'dreadfully', 'conceived', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'So', 'watching', 'Spanglish', 'seemed', 'walking', 'trap.I', 'mean', 'Sandler', 'meets', 'Brooks', 'not', 'combination', 'most', 'fluid', 'offering.And', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'Spanglish', 'just', ""n't"", 'flow', 'What', 'chaotic', 'comedy', 'just', 'touch', 'focus', 'turns', 'almost', 'too', 'suddenly', 'heartbreaking', 'drama', 'mean', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'needed', 'be', 'balance.Ok', ""'m"", 'laying', 'out', 'faults', ""'ll"", 'just', 'spill', 'right', 'here', 'initial', 'premise', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'total', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'would', 'kind', 'way', 'Having', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'college', 'essay', 'submission', 'glance', 'be', 'inspired', ""n't"", 'way', 'essay', 'closed', 'rather', 'stupid', 'watching', 'group', 'adults', 'smiling', 'ridiculously', 'essay', 'got', 'film', 'started', 'off', 'weird', 'note', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'relationships', 'choppy', 'best', 'John', 'perfect', 'husband', 'too', 'perfect', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Deborah', 'total', 'mess', 'was', 'most', 'understandable', 'characters', 'Sure', 'was', 'insane', 'kind', 'more', 'kind', 'irritating', 'was', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'remarkably', 'human', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'sudden', 'turn', 'performance', 'required', 'sell', 'everything', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Flor', 'mean', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'daughter', 'respect', 'intention', 'came', 'off', 'tad', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'crux', 'entire', 'film', 'relationship', 'John', 'predictable', 'annoying.Oh', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'hilarious', 'even', 'character', 'BEYOND', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'feels', 'afterthought.But', 'film', 'surprising', 'heart', 'loved', 'character', 'Bernice', 'mean', 'had', 'such', 'depth', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'underwritten', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'was', 'sorts', 'manic', 'brilliance', 'here', 'way', 'sudden', 'scene', 'destitution', 'was', 'FLAWLESS', 'fact', 'being', 'totally', 'where', 'kind', 'unbalanced', 'scene', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'clearly', 'how', 'film', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'script', 'been', 'more', 'focused', '.It', 'tries', 'parts', 'overall', 'feel', 'Spanglish', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'hard', 'sell', 'funny', 'beginning', 'then', 'too', 'hard', 'sell', 'drama', 'end', 'off', 'choppy', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'masked', 'layers', 'missed', 'opportunities']",Spanglish

In some of the key scenes with Paz Vega, he seemed uncomfortable.Speaking of Ms. Vega, she's the start of the many things that are good about Spanglish.  Like many people, I'm tired of the star-making machine trying to cram Penelope Cruz down my throat.  I like Ms. Cruz as much as the next person, but that just isn't happening, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Let's hope Ms. Vega becomes everything that Team Cruz has tried to attain.  At the very least, Ms. Vega owes Ms. Cruz a thank you for chopping down the timber in front of her.  Ms. Vega had to learn both English and Mexican-inflected Spanish for her role, so its not all natural charm and eye-popping good looks up there.Other delights include:Cloris Leachman...still a scene-stealer 40 years (!) after the Mary Tyler Moore show made her a household name.  The Executive Producer of MTM was a young James L. Brooks, showing that it never hurts to make friends and be nice to people.Shelbie Bruce...as Ms. Vega's daughter Cristina, she has one incredible scene in which she acts as translator between Vega and Sandler, taking on not only the words, but also the intonations, body language and passion of the original speaker.  It's the second-best scene in the movie.T&eacute;a Leoni...as Sandler's wife.  Ms. Leoni is this country's best physical comedienne on the big screen ('Flirting With Disaster' anyone?), and she proves it again here, with a hilarious, over-the-top, not-quite-a-sex scene, replete with jogging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.  This one should go right up there with Meg Ryan's famous ""I'll have what she's having"" scene in ""When Harry Met Sally.""",4,LEFT!,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,2116,"['Spanglish', 'suffers', 'near-death', 'over-poignancy', 'earnest', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'please', 'lot', 'like', 'recommend', 'here', 'though.In', 'general', ""'m"", 'not', 'anti-Adam', 'Sandler', 'butI', 'love', 'how', 'consistently', 'overcome', 'doubters', 'career', 'Here', 'however', 'straight', 'entire', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'was', 'watching', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'self-consciously', 'taking', 'bigimportantserious', 'role', 'key', 'scenes', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'seemed', 'uncomfortable.Speaking', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'start', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'Spanglish', 'many', 'people', ""'m"", 'tired', 'star-making', 'machine', 'trying', 'cram', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'throat', 'Ms.', 'Cruz', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'just', ""n't"", 'happening', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Let', 'hope', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'everything', 'Team', 'Cruz', 'tried', 'attain', 'very', 'least', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'Ms.', 'Cruz', 'thank', 'chopping', 'down', 'timber', 'front', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'had', 'learn', 'English', 'Mexican-inflected', 'Spanish', 'role', 'not', 'natural', 'charm', 'eye-popping', 'good', 'up', 'there.Other', 'delights', 'include', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'still', 'scene-stealer', '40', 'years', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'MTM', 'was', 'young', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'showing', 'never', 'make', 'friends', 'be', 'nice', 'people.Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'Ms.', 'Vega', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'one', 'incredible', 'scene', 'translator', 'Vega', 'Sandler', 'taking', 'not', 'only', 'words', 'also', 'intonations', 'body', 'language', 'passion', 'original', 'speaker', 'second-best', 'scene', 'movie.T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'Sandler', 'wife', 'Ms.', 'Leoni', 'country', 'best', 'physical', 'comedienne', 'big', 'screen', ""'Flirting"", 'Disaster', 'anyone', 'again', 'here', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'not-quite-a-sex', 'scene', 'replete', 'jogging', 'bra', 'running', 'shoes', 'Sandler', 'only', 'convenient', 'bystander', 'one', 'should', 'go', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'famous', ""'ll"", 'have', 'what', 'having', 'scene', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally']",Spanglish

Brooks is in full pander mode as he regugitates all the hackneyed stereotypes about whites and Latinos: The hysterical stay at home suburban mom who is utterly clueless when it comes to her family until the noble Mexican maid comes along to inject humanity and compassion back into their lives. Yawn.Equally overwrought is the usual boo-hoo-hoo maudlin moments that lesser writers trot out as emotional crescendos, but here they are unsentimental and stupid. And what a fabulous message: it's better for the maid's daughter to become a maid like her mom and throw away a private school scholarship in order to ""be true to her roots."" I thought people come to this country to form a better life for themselves and their families. Why would the maid NOT want her daughter to have the best education she could? Great message, James.And Adam Sandler? Alas, his best role is still ""Punch Drunk Love."" He comes across here as a semi-retarded Emeril Lagasse who can barely relate to anyone in an adult manner. Tea Leoni spends the movie sobbing and feeling sorry for herself, making you want to reach through the television and strangle her. Her costant shrieks of ""Left!"" as she passes joggers on her hourly run are funny only the first hundred times we hear it. She is truly one of the most annoying actresses in recent memory.

The film can't decide whether the Klasky family is its focus or if the focus is their maid Flor, played by the beautiful Paz Vega.Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni play a successful couple with a bad marriage.Sandler plays his character as a charming but befuddled doormat who only occasionally asserts himself, though he never does that with his wife.Deb Klasky, Leoni's character, is a particularly unpleasant character. She's horribly insensitive, totally neurotic and makes some awful, awful choices. And then, for some reason, the film offers her character no ending whatsoever.I was waiting for there to be some resolution. I wanted to know what happened to the Klasky marriage. I wanted to know where the movie went from its central confrontation.But nothing happened.I don't know why the movie can't be about both Flor AND the Klaskys - giving all the plots a proper resolution, but director James L. Brooks apparently thinks, at different points in the film, that it's about one set of characters or the other.So we're left with some characters that get no definition at all (the Klaskys have a son who gets almost no screen time), some plotlines that are just left dangling (when does the young girl stand up to her mother?) and some confrontations that the movie seems to build toward that just never happen (Deb and Flor should have one more conversation).Also, the movie is told by a narrator who CAN'T know all the things the movie is telling us.On my way out of the theater after SPANGLISH, I heard one woman tell another that they liked it and liked, most of all, that it didn't have a traditional ""Hollywood ending.""I found it uneven, and I found its ending a cheat.",2,You're not missing much by not seeing it.

The problem with ""50 First Dates"" was it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be ""Groundhog Day"" or more typical Sandler fare. The problem with ""Spanglish,"" on the other hand, is that it's like two movies in one--and one of them isn't very good.The movie that doesn't work is the one about John Clasky (Sandler) and his harridan of a wife Deb (T&eacute;a Leoni). As has been pointed out elsewhere, Leoni does a superb job of portraying one of the most unsympathetic characters ever committed to film, but this part of the story goes nowhere. In fact, at the end of the movie, we're left wondering just what the whole point of the relationship was.Maybe it was simply a plot device to get the second movie off theground? The one that leads me to recommend ""Spanglish"" despite its flaws: the relationship between John and Flor (Paz Vega). In it, Sandler demonstrates that he can certainly play it straight, although, as in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" he can't help letting his inner SNL player loose occasionally. He's getting better, and one of these days he'll make it, but as of yet he's no Jim Carrey in ""Eternal Sunshine."" But bravo, anyway. As for Vega, in the first few scenes of the movie one fears for her, as much of the action appears overstaged and focuses too much on the language issue--but once those hurdles have been passed, she absolutely shines, in both languages.In ""Spanglish,"" both Sandler and Vega do what romantic leads must do--make the audience want the two of them to get together and feel fulfilled if they do and somewhat empty if they don't. It wins on that count. But Deb is a distaction and her mother is pleasant but non-essential. The Claskys' son is a cipher, and their daughter and Flor's, though played by fine actresses, seem to belong in yet a third movie. As with ""50 First Dates,"" had the filmmakers been able to settle on one major theme, this could have been great--as it is, it remains worth seeing, but is more a hopeful sign of better things to come than an enduring classic.",3,"Flawed, but worth seeing",1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2278,"['2004', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'starred', 'two', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'dark/bittersweet', 'edge', 'playing', 'opposite', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Spanglish', 'whom', 'had', 'real', 'chemistry', 'movies', 'managed', 'fall', 'short', 'mark', 'problem', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'wanted', 'be', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'more', 'typical', 'Sandler', 'fare', 'problem', 'Spanglish', 'other', 'hand', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'John', 'Clasky', 'Sandler', 'harridan', 'wife', 'Deb', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'elsewhere', 'Leoni', 'superb', 'job', 'portraying', 'one', 'most', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'part', 'story', 'nowhere', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'whole', 'point', 'relationship', 'was.Maybe', 'was', 'simply', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'second', 'movie', 'theground', 'one', 'recommend', 'Spanglish', 'flaws', 'relationship', 'John', 'Flor', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Sandler', 'can', 'certainly', 'play', 'straight', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'letting', 'inner', 'SNL', 'player', 'loose', 'occasionally', 'getting', 'better', 'one', 'days', ""'ll"", 'make', 'yet', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'bravo', 'anyway', 'Vega', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'fears', 'much', 'action', 'overstaged', 'too', 'much', 'language', 'issue', 'once', 'hurdles', 'have', 'been', 'passed', 'absolutely', 'shines', 'languages.In', 'Spanglish', 'Sandler', 'Vega', 'do', 'what', 'romantic', 'leads', 'must', 'do', 'make', 'audience', 'want', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'do', 'somewhat', 'empty', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Deb', 'distaction', 'mother', 'pleasant', 'non-essential', 'Claskys', 'son', 'cipher', 'daughter', 'Flor', 'played', 'fine', 'actresses', 'seem', 'belong', 'yet', 'third', 'movie', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'been', 'able', 'settle', 'one', 'major', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'hopeful', 'sign', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'enduring', 'classic']",Spanglish

John and Flor both have young teenage daughters and they are interesting as well.  John has a son who is on screen some but mostly goes unnoticed.  John also has a mother-in-law with a drinking problem who has a few good moments.But unfortunately, director James Brooks has created one of the most evil, unsympathetic characters ever in John's wife, Deborah, played well by Tea Leoni.  I don't fault Leoni because she is utterly convincing as the despicable, selfish, clueless, adulterous Deborah.  She is mean to her daughter, her husband and to especially Flor, the housekeeper she hired.  Deborah doesn't have one redeeming quality which the viewer can latch on to.  There is no reason to care about her.  Even at the end of the movie when she does perhaps see the error of her ways, it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible person and it doesn't make up for all the evil she did to her family.The reason to watch this movie is Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  Their chemistry together is fresh and exciting and one leaves the theater knowing these two were made for each other.  I read one review about Spanglish that said the movie isn't very good, but it does have interesting characters.  It could have been a good movie if Brooks hadn't made Tea Leoni's character so utterly unsympathetic and repulsive.

The film moves at a steady pace, has some charming comedic moments, and is overall enjoyable. Won't give the story away, but I do recommend this film for it's light hearted comedy and excellent performances. Tea Leoni is quite exceptional, and Penelope Cruz look-a-like Paz Vega shows promise as an up and comer. Sandler has some funny moments as well, but his role is less comedy and more dramatic. The children in this film are also quite talented young actors, with special mention going to Shelbie Bruce (Christina) & Sarah Steele (Bernice) for their heartfelt performances. Cloris Leachman is quite funny as the mother Evelyn Norwich. While Vega is enjoyable and quite convincing as Flor Moreno, this is really Tea Leoni's film.

884629,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B0007OCG56,Chris,"[1, 4]","There is a disclaimer that should be attached to this movie.  If you come into this movie expecting to see a Adam Sandler movie that resembles Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or even Big Daddy, then you will be incredibly disappointed.  Yes James L. Brooks is one of the writers for The Simpsons, and the writer of Taxi, but this is anything but a slapstick comedy.This movie is described perfectly by its title.  Spanglish can mean the lack of communication between cultures, but for this movie it represents the lack of understanding of people's feelings and the lack of communication amongst husband and wife, or a whole family in general.  And yes, there is a lot of spanish spoken to people who don not understand the language.The movie is about John Clasky (Sandler) a four-star chef who works nights, and his wife, the neurotic Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is  used to working days. Consequently, they need a little help around the house. Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman), a washed-up jazz singer who spends her time in the bottom of a wine glass, isn't much help. The Claskys run an ad for a maid and hire Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who so hated to leave her native land for the bustle of Los Angeles that she's never learned English in her six years in America.  The familes relationship is really good until Deborah wants to move into a summer rental home in Malibu.  She wants Flor to tag along, but there is one problem.  Flor has a daughter named Christina, whom she has never mentioned to the Claskys, and Flor doesn't want to leave Christina behind.  So Deborah insists that Christina can also live with the family.  Then the trouble starts.  Deborah takes Christina shopping without Flor's permission.  John gives Christina $640 for finding sea glass.  Flor, being a very proud Mexican lady, does not like the Claskys doing these things for her daughter and becomes upset.  Then new relationships are built, some are destroyed and people learn to respect others wishes.As for the performances, this is Sandler's best to date.  Tea Lioni does a really good job at being someone that there is no possible way of liking.  Cloris Leachman steals many scenes and is always funny when she is one screen.  She must have had some good guidence from Mel Brooks for all those years.  The stand out performance is Paz Vega.  She cannot express herself too much in words, so most of her expression comes her facial expressions.  Kind of like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands.  She resembles Penelope Cruz a lot, but is a better actress.The movies itself is really good, one of the years best movies.  The only real problem that I had with the movie is that is seemed to be about 10 minutes long.  Other than that, there was nothing else that bothered me.  James L. Brooks has done is again.  It seems like everytime he starts to write, something good is formed.

That alone swayed me to watch it, despite my bewilderment that Adam Sandler continues to get work beyond  his usual one-note comedic roles.  Boy, what a letdown.  SPANGLISH, though not without its' moments(few and far between as they are)isn't a patch on his previous BROADCAST NEWS or even the flawed but still watchable AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  Alot of what's wrong with the movie(for me anyway)can be traced back to Tea Leoni's character Deborah, who has got to be one of the most utterly unlikable, unredeemable characters I've ever seen actually make it on to a movie screen.  There's so much wrong with this role--she treats her children like second class citizens in favor of hanging out with the housekeeper's daughter, she treats her alcoholic mother like a third class citizen(sorry, but I'd be drinking even more than her if I had that harpy for a child), and seems almost indifferent to the needs of her husband.  The fact that Tea Leoni, who hasn't given a decent performance since FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, plays her like an over-the-top, cartoonish whirlwind, doesn't help matters in any regard.  In relation, Adam Sandler actually gives a halfway decent performance, and Paz Vega is a true find as the immigrant housekeeper who is struggling to assimilate to new foreign surroundings while still trying to retain her heritage.  The true saving grace of the film, though, was the underused but comedically brilliant Cloris Leachman, who brings tangy zest to the role of Leoni's mother and effortlessly owns every scene she's in.

There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people.The film actually centers around Flor and Cristina, a Spanish mother and daughter respectively who move to California. Flor ends up taking a job as a housekeeper at a really nice house. Only thing is she can't speak any English whatsoever so that causes some initial problems. Things still continue when both of them move in and Cristina finds herself being at a huge center of attention from the wife Deborah. Deborah is shifts moods radically while her husband John is an unhappy restaurant chef, even when he gets a 4 star review. The film mainly centers around different styles of parenting and dysfunction that can happen in families.Now I should get this out of the way: Sandler doesn't feel miscast, in fact he's quite good, despite some Sandler-esque bits (his dialogue during a rather strange love scene is very reminiscent of his other stuff) but I think his presence suggests this is going to be a low-brow humor geared to frat boys. The real stars are Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, the headstrong but slightly stubborn mother and the wise beyond her years daughter respectively. In fact Bruce steals the show where she not only has to translate a fight with John and Flor but she nails the shifting emotional states of both characters. Tea Leoni I always felt gets really bad reps with stating she's a terrible actress (although her performance in Jurassic Park III made me wish a dinosaur did snack on her) but here I loved her.The film's main problem is its running time. Ever watch a movie that felt long or was long but looking back on it you couldn't figure out where you'd take the scissors if you had the chance? Spanglish to me is similar in that at 2 hours and 10 minutes it does seem a bit long yet I couldn't tell you what scenes required additional editing since they're important in and of themselves. Not to mention it's not exactly the most cliche-free plot as there's some scenes that are going to be obvious and when they happen they don't really surprise (a possible romance between John and Flor, Deborah and her mother having an all-out or jealousy among Flor and Deborah) but the film's entertaining anyway.Should you watch the movie? Personally I say so. It's rare lately to watch a good comedy movie that never felt as if all you'd get out of it was laughs.",4,"Will also use the word ""surprising"" for this film",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2928,"['lot', 'good', 'directors', 'will', 'tell', 'good', 'stories', 'can', 'often', 'fall', 'apart', 'casting', 'bad', 'are', 'particular', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'not', 'terrible', 'respective', 'films', 'feel', 'woefully', 'place', 'talent', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'case', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'actually', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'miscast', 'very', 'respectable', 'job', 'getting', 'away', 'Happy', 'Gilmore/Billy', 'Madison', 'schtick', 'time', 'instead', 'being', 'miscast', 'just', 'lightning', 'rod', 'miscasting', 'rants', 'people.The', 'film', 'actually', 'centers', 'Flor', 'Cristina', 'Spanish', 'mother', 'daughter', 'respectively', 'who', 'move', 'California', 'Flor', 'up', 'taking', 'job', 'housekeeper', 'really', 'nice', 'house', 'Only', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'so', 'initial', 'problems', 'Things', 'still', 'continue', 'when', 'move', 'Cristina', 'being', 'huge', 'center', 'attention', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Deborah', 'shifts', 'moods', 'radically', 'husband', 'John', 'unhappy', 'restaurant', 'chef', 'even', 'when', '4', 'star', 'review', 'film', 'mainly', 'different', 'styles', 'parenting', 'dysfunction', 'can', 'happen', 'families.Now', 'should', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'Sandler', ""n't"", 'feel', 'miscast', 'fact', 'quite', 'good', 'Sandler-esque', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'strange', 'love', 'scene', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'stuff', 'think', 'presence', 'going', 'be', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'geared', 'frat', 'boys', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'headstrong', 'slightly', 'stubborn', 'mother', 'wise', 'years', 'daughter', 'respectively', 'fact', 'Bruce', 'show', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'translate', 'fight', 'John', 'Flor', 'shifting', 'emotional', 'states', 'characters', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'always', 'felt', 'really', 'bad', 'reps', 'stating', 'terrible', 'actress', 'performance', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'III', 'made', 'wish', 'dinosaur', 'did', 'snack', 'here', 'loved', 'her.The', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'running', 'time', 'Ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'felt', 'long', 'was', 'long', 'looking', 'back', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'where', ""'d"", 'take', 'scissors', 'had', 'chance', 'Spanglish', 'similar', '2', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'seem', 'bit', 'long', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'required', 'additional', 'editing', ""'re"", 'important', 'Not', 'mention', 'not', 'exactly', 'most', 'cliche-free', 'plot', 'scenes', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'obvious', 'when', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'possible', 'romance', 'John', 'Flor', 'Deborah', 'mother', 'having', 'all-out', 'jealousy', 'Flor', 'Deborah', 'film', 'entertaining', 'anyway.Should', 'watch', 'movie', 'Personally', 'say', 'so', 'rare', 'lately', 'watch', 'good', 'comedy', 'movie', 'never', 'felt', ""'d"", 'get', 'was', 'laughs']",Spanglish

Paz plays a immigrant from mexico who decides to make a better life for her and her daughter by getting hired on as a housekeeper for an eccentric, upper class housewife who is clueless about daily life.  Adam Sandler plays the homeowner husband who just tries to hold life all together, and is just as grounded as Paz's character.  The movie follows the relationship of a housekeeper and the family over about a 6-12 month period, through the eyes of the housekeeper's daugther.  Despite a huge language barrier, bonds are made.

Perhaps it was the misleading trailers that pegged the movie as some kind of goofy Sandler comedy. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the story is told by a young Mexican girl named Christina about her mother, Flor and their misadventures in America.Those expecting Spanglish to be a typical Sandler movie will be disappointed. Brooks prolongs his first on-screen appearance for as long as possible and when it does happen it is in a subtle, understated way with no fanfare. For the first half of the movie, Sandler plays a supporting role, allowing the other actors room to do their thing and then, in the last half, he comes to the foreground as the drama between him and Leoni's character comes to a boil. As brilliant as he was in Punch-Drunk Love, Sandler is even better in Spanglish, dropping most of his usual schtick by playing a nice, normal guy who loves his family. He hits all the right comedic beats but in a quiet, restrained way and ably handles the serious moments too.Ultimately, Brooks' films are about tolerance and optimism in a time when our society is so cynical and jaded. His movies happen in spite of the world outside. Very few mainstream American films deal with class differences and Spanglish tackles it head on as Flor and her daughter's Mexican heritage clash with the Clasky's upscale world.There is an audio commentary by writer/director James L. Brooks and the film's editors, Richard Marks and Tia Nolan. He speaks eloquently about Spanglish with the editors chiming in occasionally.There are 12 additional scenes, totaling 30 minutes, with optional commentary by Brooks and his editors. We see some of the footage of Flor and Christina in Mexico and a funny scene that gives Georgie more screen-time and pays off an earlier gag where Evelyn was teaching him jazz songs. With most cut footage it is readily apparent why they were cut but most of this footage is excellent and could have been kept in if it hadn't extended an already fairly long movie.""HBO First Look: The Making of Spanglish"" is a standard press kit featurette with soundbites from Brooks and the cast mixed with clips from the movie.""Casting Sessions"" features footage of some of the supporting cast auditioning for the movie with optional commentary by Brooks. It becomes immediately obvious that these actors were perfect for their roles and that Brooks is a genius at casting his movies.""How to Make the World's Greatest Sandwich featuring Thomas Keller"" features footage of the chef (and film's technical advisor) showing Adam Sandler how to make the killer looking (and apparently tasting) modified BLT that his character makes in the movie.

She has shown in the past two or three years that she has talent I NEVER noticed before.  Anyways, I just wanted to make mention of that while it was on my mind.  Spanglish was a film I had wanted to see but never had the urge to spend money to see, but since the library had it and it was a free rental I picked it up over the weekend.  I just want to say that although it may have not been marketed perfectly, you have to know walking into this film that it is by no means a 'comedy' in the sense that most 'comedies' are today.  It's more along the lines of 'The Family Stone' just not as good.  It's a drama with funny scenes.  The heart of this movie is not to make you laugh but to make you think.  The story revolves around Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a single Latina who is strugling to raise her pre-teen daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in LA.  She gets a job house cleaning for the Clasky family, but she never could have known what she was getting herself or her daughter into.  The Clasky's are not your typical family...their off, just a little.  John (Adam Sandler) is a top-notch chef and the 'sane' one in the family.  Deborah (Leoni) is the high strung, depressed and over whelmed mother who doesn't know how to deal with herself let alone her family.  Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman) is a drunk ex-jazz singer who serves as the reason and also the solution to most of Deborah's problems.  Bernice (Sarah Steele), the overweight daughter, is going through those normal teenage years and is starting to butt heads with her mother enough to loath her for it.  Oh yeah, and they have a son but he never speaks.  As Flor moves in with the Clasky's over the summer the families start to interact in ways neither of them expected and bonds are formed between each and evrey one of them, while walls are built around others.  Writer/director James L. Brooks for the most part gets this very right for he creates people that we care about while painting a picture that is very believable.  The actors, especially Leoni, really sink their teeth into their roles, and Paz is such a warm hearted delight she's such a joy to watch on the screen.  Sandler tackled a role I would have never expected him too and he surprised me by pulling it off.  As I said, this is a dramedy with a lot of heart, a lot of humor and a lot of sincerity.

884639,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007OCG56,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","The first thing you need to know about Spanglish is that it is not a comedy; it is a drama with bits of humor spread throughout its two plus hours' running time.  Adam Sandler is not the main focus of the film, nor is he the kind of boisterous character we are so used to seeing; he is, in fact, exceedingly mellow and serious here.  Spanglish is really all about the boundaries of culture, economic standing, and social circles, centering on a Mexican mother who brings her daughter to America and spends several life-changing months working for a rich restaurant chef and his increasingly insane wife.  This film has heart, and it has it in spades.Paz Vega (who is, I have to say, absolutely gorgeous) plays Flor Moreno, a young mother who comes to America to give her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) the best life possible.  Not knowing a word of English, she works two jobs to make ends meet - until she accepts a housekeeping job with the Clasky family.  The Claskys are not exactly normal.  The husband, John (Adam Sandler), is a wildly successful chef who always seems to be in sort of a fog, while the wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a narcissistic woman with an ever-growing number of neuroses and an almost infinite capacity to annoy.  Their daughter needs the kind of support that Deborah seems incapable of providing, while their son must have been put in the film as a favor to someone important because he serves no purpose whatsoever in the story.  Cloris Leachman shines as Deborah's wise mother who has plenty of advice to give based on her own mistakes.Things are going OK until the family rents a summer cottage on the beach, and Flor and Cristina move in.  Suddenly, Cristina is given access to a world she has never known, and Deborah is particularly brazen about giving things to Cristina that Flor could never afford - even a scholarship to a swanky private school.  John makes his own mistakes with Cristina and her mother, but he and Flor eventually develop what he might call a simpatico relationship.  Deborah eventually becomes quite out of control, basically treating Cristina as her own daughter.  Even as she is being isolated and alienated by Deborah, Flor begins drawing closer to John.  Through it all, though, she makes all of her decisions based on her daughter's best interests.I thought Spanglish was just an outstanding film.  It may have gone a little far in terms of turning the audience completely against Deborah (Tea Leoni, I might add, seems to age about thirty years over the course of this film), but the central message of the film comes through loud and clear.  You don't exactly close the book on these characters when the movie ends, as there is some ambiguity involved with the conclusion, but that seems quite fitting here.  I thought Adam Sandler was terrific, but his casting for the role of John Clasky is a bit of a two-edged sword.  Some Sandler fans will come to Spanglish expecting another extreme comedy and be surprised if not disappointed, while other viewers may turn away from the film because they assume it is another typical Sandler vehicle.  I hope this movie continues to get the attention it deserves from all audiences, though, as it really is a wonderfully made film that tells an emotionally poignant story.",5,An absolutely wonderful surprise of a movie,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,3281,"['first', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'Spanglish', 'not', 'comedy', 'drama', 'bits', 'humor', 'spread', 'two', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'kind', 'boisterous', 'character', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'fact', 'exceedingly', 'mellow', 'serious', 'here', 'Spanglish', 'really', 'boundaries', 'culture', 'economic', 'standing', 'social', 'circles', 'centering', 'Mexican', 'mother', 'who', 'daughter', 'America', 'several', 'life-changing', 'months', 'working', 'rich', 'restaurant', 'chef', 'increasingly', 'insane', 'wife', 'film', 'heart', 'spades.Paz', 'Vega', 'who', 'have', 'say', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Flor', 'Moreno', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'America', 'give', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'best', 'life', 'possible', 'Not', 'knowing', 'word', 'English', 'two', 'jobs', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'housekeeping', 'job', 'Clasky', 'family', 'Claskys', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'normal', 'husband', 'John', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'wildly', 'successful', 'chef', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'sort', 'fog', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'narcissistic', 'woman', 'ever-growing', 'number', 'neuroses', 'almost', 'infinite', 'capacity', 'annoy', 'daughter', 'kind', 'support', 'Deborah', 'incapable', 'providing', 'son', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'film', 'favor', 'someone', 'important', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'story', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Deborah', 'wise', 'mother', 'who', 'plenty', 'advice', 'give', 'based', 'own', 'mistakes.Things', 'are', 'going', 'OK', 'family', 'summer', 'cottage', 'beach', 'Flor', 'Cristina', 'move', 'Suddenly', 'Cristina', 'given', 'access', 'world', 'never', 'known', 'Deborah', 'particularly', 'brazen', 'giving', 'things', 'Cristina', 'Flor', 'could', 'never', 'afford', 'even', 'scholarship', 'swanky', 'private', 'school', 'John', 'own', 'mistakes', 'Cristina', 'mother', 'Flor', 'eventually', 'develop', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'simpatico', 'relationship', 'Deborah', 'eventually', 'quite', 'control', 'basically', 'treating', 'Cristina', 'own', 'daughter', 'Even', 'being', 'isolated', 'alienated', 'Deborah', 'Flor', 'drawing', 'closer', 'John', 'decisions', 'based', 'daughter', 'best', 'interests.I', 'thought', 'Spanglish', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'little', 'far', 'terms', 'turning', 'audience', 'completely', 'Deborah', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'might', 'add', 'age', 'thirty', 'years', 'course', 'film', 'central', 'message', 'film', 'loud', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'close', 'book', 'characters', 'when', 'movie', 'ambiguity', 'involved', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'fitting', 'here', 'thought', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'terrific', 'casting', 'role', 'John', 'Clasky', 'bit', 'two-edged', 'sword', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'will', 'come', 'Spanglish', 'expecting', 'extreme', 'comedy', 'be', 'surprised', 'not', 'disappointed', 'other', 'viewers', 'may', 'turn', 'away', 'film', 'assume', 'typical', 'Sandler', 'vehicle', 'hope', 'movie', 'get', 'attention', 'audiences', 'though', 'really', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'film', 'emotionally', 'poignant', 'story']",Spanglish

There's literally no humor or romance, and the movie drags on for two hours without really doing much of anything. Tea leoni (Family Man, Jurassic Park 3) seems almost bored with the script, and Adam Sandler can't even hope to liven the dull boring moments that constantly shroud the movie.Want to watch a good romantic comedy with Adam as our star? Try Big Daddy or the Wedding Singer. Even Fifty first dates was better than Spanglish. Adam and Drew Barrymore definatly had more chemistry going than him and Paz Vega (Flor). As for Adam Sandler being a chef, or  his family delightfully eccentric. All I can say is ""I so desperatly wish it where so."" Maybe the movie might have had more of an appeal.

884641,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0007OCG56,David E. Levine,"[2, 4]","This was a comedy with a pretty good plot and would otherwise deserve at least 4 stars. My problem is, however, that some of the characters are not believable in their roles. Tea Leoni, who plays Deborah Clasky,the wealthy wife of a highly successful chef and restaurant owner, played by Adam Sandler, is fabulous as a nuerotic Southern Californian. However, Sandler, who plays his role as a good natured type that you would expect him to play, is just not believable as the restaurant owner who becomes fabulously wealthy from the restaurant. He is not convincing as a world class chef who is also a businessman adept enough to make his restaurant into a multimillion dollar business.The plot revolves around a housekeeper named Flor, hire by Deborah, played by Paz Vega. She has a daughter, the same age as the Clasky's daughter, and as the housekeeper, her daughter, Christina, is well treated by the Clasky's. Flor has certain problems with the Clasky's largess since she is very proud. It could be a compelling plot but, Vega is almost as unconvincing in her role as Sandler is in his. She plays a Mexican who moved to Los Angeles and while living there, never left the barrio until landing her job with the Clasky's. However, she looks assimilated into Southern California culture. Even though she is initially unable to speak English, she nontheless has the look and mannerisms of a well coiffed, reasonably fashionably dressed Southern Californian. Given the nature of her role, she would be expected to come across as much more provincial.The movie had potential. The Clasky's daughter was overweight and ungainly and needed love which Flor tried to provide. Meanwhile, Christina was the daughter of an immigrant mother who, for the first time, was obtaining many of the finer things in life, including private schooling. The parents of each girl, at times, bristled at the interference of the other. The characters have to click, however, and although some do (most notably, the girls), some key characters do not.

884642,A2MQQI4UYT9C11,B0007OCG56,David Zimmerman,"[5, 10]","One week last year, my wife and I each picked a romantic comedy as rental fare. Her choice, ""Spanglish"", came first. It wasn't hugely attractive to me--I've never been much of an Adam Sandler fan (excluding Punch Drunk Love, which was a hoot), and Tea Leoni has to answer for her appearance in the awful ""Sudden Impact"". One potential positive was direction by James Brooks, who did Terms of Endearment (which in retrospect was quite similar to Steel Magnolias) about 20 years ago.I hung in for the entire 130 minutes of this tale of culture clash in Southern California. A Mexican women and her young daughter emigrate to the U.S. After six years working for peanuts in the barrio where everyone speaks Spanish, Flor (the woman) realizes that she needs to enter the Anglo world to find a better paying job, which she finds as a housekeeper for Sandler, Leoni and family. Sandler is a successful chef. Leoni is an achievement-oriented basket case. The Hispanic actress and her daughter are gorgeous. Cloris Leachman has a nice turn as Leoni's mother. The girl who plays the Claskys' daughter is terrific, but I just couldn't get past Sandler and Leoni to really enjoy this film, even though the story has some resonance and wasn't necessarily resolved in the ""happily-ever after"" fashion that you'd expect. The title refers both to the culture clash, and to the housekeeper's belated efforts to learn English, so as to better control the Claskys' influence on her daughter's life.I think most folks would enjoy this one better than I did (the rest of my family did).

The absolutely stunning Paz Vega steals every single scene she's in; Adam Sandler is (remarkably, astonishingly) subdued and restrained; Tea Leoni plays dysfunction like a seasoned veteran; and Cloris Leachman is priceless.  Sandler plays a world-class, successful chef whose bored and dissatisfied wife (Leoni) hires a gorgeous immigrant from Mexico (Vega) to be the new housekeeper--a housekeeper who doesn't speak a lick of English, and who must communicate to her new employers via her bilingual daughter (Shelbie Bruce).  The plot is multi-layered, to say the least; Bruce's character is drawn to the materialistic, yuppie mom, who virtually ignores her own daughter, a sensitive child with some self-esteem issues (Sarah Steele).  Meanwhile the marriage is disintegrating, augmented by a serious attraction between the chef, and his English-challenged employee.

Brooks -- his latest film ""Spanglish"" feels like a tirade against a despised ex (which, rumor has it, it is). Paz Vega injects a bit of likability into the plot, but this comedy just seems like a bitter ride into marital dysfunction.Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate to the United States, hoping for a better life. They find employment for Jamie Oliver-like John Clasky (Adam Sandler) and his neurotic wife Deborah (Tea Leoni), who have a very weird marriage -- he is a loving husband and father, with too much pressure; she is a screeching harridan who bugs her pudgy daughter to lose weight.Flor doesn't speak English, and the Claskys don't speak Spanish; her bilingual child has to translate for them. But a friendship starts to bloom between Flor and John, as Deborah starts to woo Flor's pretty young daughter away from her, and alienates her own daughter.A comedy that bangs you over the head with a message is bad enough. A comedy that just bangs you over the head is even worse. This is another one of the mature Adam Sandler movies -- you know, the ones where he is called on to play a non-dolt. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worthy of such an attempt.While the movie technically revolves around Flor and John's lives, the obnoxious self-absorbed Deborah dominates the plot. If you can get past Brooks' ridiculous bitterness, there actually a smothered message in the story about Flor. Unfortunately, it seems to be that if a person immigrates to the US, they shouldn't consider it ""their"" country, or let their kids do so. The writing has a few good lines (especially from Deborah's alcoholic mother), but stays tepid most of the time.Tea Leoni isn't a terribly good actress, but she's given a positively loathsome character in Deborah -- she's obsessed with her body, ignorant of others' feelings, and obnoxious even in the bedroom. (Yes, Brooks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband. Only Paz Vega gives a performance of real nuance and ability.The bile that spews all over ""Spanglish"" keeps it from being a moderately charming love/family comedy.

884650,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007OCG56,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 3]","What an utter disappointment. From James L. Brooks, the man who made ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Broadcast News"", ""As Good As It Gets"" and of course, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", comes a dramedy that has two separate agendas that the filmmaker seems intent on integrating regardless of the resulting contrivances. The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity. This part is worthy of screen treatment. The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite. This part has been seriously misjudged.Let me tackle the problematic second part first. In an overly sincere mode, Adam Sandler portrays John Clasky, the hottest chef in a city where culinary celebrities are at the top of the heap. His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his ""French Laundry"" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic). In fact, Keller appears in a pertinent extra on the making of the ideal late night sandwich, which includes the recipe as well. The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father. At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.But the real problem is the way Brooks conceives John's wife Deborah as a character. T&eacute;a Leoni has the unfortunate task of playing the aerobicized fishwife from hell, a former go-getter who was downsized out of her career as a commercial designer. Now Deborah is a horrifying mother who chokes the self-esteem out of her daughter (as much as it is inferred her mother did to her) and shamelessly pilfers the affections of her maid's daughter. She's a therapy-driven narcissist whose competitive impulses get in the way of any good intentions, and she's always apologizing for her actions, which Brooks hopes will endear her to us. It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likeable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room""). The combination of Sandler and Leoni nearly torpedoes the movie completely.This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos. Brooks has found a luminous actress in Paz Vega, a Penelope Cruz look-alike (imagine the Almod&oacute;var possibilities in their joint casting), as Flor, the woman who escapes Mexico with her daughter to eventually find work as the Clasky maid. Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers. The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John. In fact, her innate nobility provides the framework for the story as it is essentially a flashback described by her daughter Cristina in what must have been the world's longest application essay to Princeton. In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.Shelbie Bruce is excellent as the adolescent Cristina, especially as she cross-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end. Sarah Steele is equally fine as the Clasky's overweight daughter Bernie, alternating between smart-mouth comments and palpable sadness. And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: ""Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear."" I only wish her character was fleshed out more to provide a better counterbalance to her awful daughter. Brooks should be commended for his high-mindedness here but docked for his hubris in having us accept these characters. The DVD has lots of extras, including enthusiastic audio commentary from Brooks with his editors Richard Marks and Tia Nolan and the addition of twelve deleted scenes again with the same trio providing comments. There is the brief Keller clip I mentioned, as well as an HBO First Look featurette that actually got me more excited about the movie than watching the movie itself.",2,High-Minded Two-Pronged Story

884653,A146D2LYLICNLS,B0007OCG56,eric_f,"[3, 6]","I was pleasantly surprised by ""Spanglish"" and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I would actually rate it 3 out of 5 stars if it weren't for the top-notch performance by Paz Vega, who IMO steals the show. By playing a maid, her role unfortunately does not break away from the stereotypical Hollywood role for a Latina actress. However, she is given so much screen time in this movie that she has every chance to breathe life into it, which she does in every scene she is in. And what's even better, having her take center stage lets her avoid getting swallowed up by the starpower of Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman. Although I agree with other reviewers that this movie focuses a lot (perhaps even too much) on Deborah's neurosis, I think Flor is the one whom this movie is really about. After all, the movie is narrated from the first-person viewpoint of Flor's daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who mainly talks about her mother's experiences with the family.In terms of the other performances, everyone does a credible job. Adam Sandler proves that he can take on a more serious role, although there were certain scenes when I almost expected him to suddenly go slapstick on us. The only scene that I found pointless is when Tea Leoni climaxes on top of Sandler with her clothes on. This scene was majorly out of place in the movie and was rather stupid and unfunny.All in all, ""Spanglish"" is a movie that would be fairly run-of-the-mill if it weren't for the injected Latin flavor of Paz Vega, who spices things up and makes it worth seeing. This is her first major blockbuster movie in the American market, and now that she has gotten the exposure she needs, I hope she can continue to have success with her future projects.",4,Paz Vega breathes life into an otherwise mediocre movie,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1767,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Spanglish', 'found', 'enjoying', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'would', 'actually', 'rate', '3', '5', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'top-notch', 'performance', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'who', 'IMO', 'show', 'playing', 'maid', 'role', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'break', 'away', 'stereotypical', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'Latina', 'actress', 'However', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'chance', 'breathe', 'life', 'scene', 'what', 'even', 'better', 'having', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'avoid', 'getting', 'swallowed', 'up', 'starpower', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'lot', 'perhaps', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'Deborah', 'neurosis', 'think', 'Flor', 'one', 'whom', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'movie', 'narrated', 'first-person', 'viewpoint', 'Flor', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'who', 'mainly', 'mother', 'experiences', 'family.In', 'terms', 'other', 'performances', 'everyone', 'credible', 'job', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'can', 'take', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'were', 'certain', 'scenes', 'when', 'almost', 'expected', 'suddenly', 'go', 'slapstick', 'only', 'scene', 'found', 'pointless', 'when', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'climaxes', 'top', 'Sandler', 'clothes', 'scene', 'was', 'majorly', 'place', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'stupid', 'unfunny.All', 'Spanglish', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'run-of-the-mill', 'were', ""n't"", 'injected', 'Latin', 'flavor', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'who', 'things', 'up', 'worth', 'seeing', 'first', 'major', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'American', 'market', 'now', 'gotten', 'exposure', 'hope', 'can', 'continue', 'have', 'success', 'future', 'projects']",Spanglish

First of all, the script was hackneyed and the characters were one dimensional. I knew who each character was, and I could see the arc of the entire film, in ten minutes. Second, the directing was ham handed. The reactions shots were lengthy, obvious and terrible. Third, the acting was ATROCIOUS. I have never seen a person try as hard to act neurotic at Tea Leoni.

884657,AXD29NR7HM8VF,B0007OCG56,Flower Girl,"[3, 5]","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I loved the characters and thought that the movie captured perfectly some of the relationship pitfalls that exist between family members and employer/employees.Tea Leone is perfectly scary as the obsessive-compulsive, competative, spoiled wife who does not have a warm relationship with anyone in the movie, including her husband.  She has very little to do with her own children, but becomes obsessed with her housekeepers daughter because she is so beautiful.  There is a telling scene where she purchases her daughter Bernice bags of new clothing.  Bernice is elated until she realizes that all of the clothes are too small and her mother tells her that they'll all fit when she loses a little weight.Adam Sandler is a great surprise here in a dramatic, rather than comedic, role as a chef/restauranteur.  He has complicated employee relationships (a sous chef who wants part ownership in the restaurant, an agressive manager who wants to change the feeling of the restaurant) and home relationships.  When Flor arrives he is taken by her but this doesn't get too complicated until his wife insists that Flor and her daughter move into the Malibu summer house with them.Flor is a very attentive and focused mother.  She takes the job with the Clasky's because she wants more time in the evenings with her daughter and needs to make more money.  This is her first move out of the hispanic community she has enjoyed since moving to the U.S.  She resists the Clasky's efforts to ""help"" her daughter and this becomes a full out war of wills between her and Mrs. Clasky, though Mr. Clasky un-wittingly puts himself into it as well.  Flor is a determined character, probably the best one in the film, she is a fierce mother and seems to have her priorities intact.The relationship between Flor and Mr. Clasky is, I thought, one of the most natural in the movie.  Of course he is attracted to the beautiful maid but as the movie goes on you find that they appreciate each other for their ideals, not thier looks.  In the end the relationship goes nowhere, because it shouldn't and they are both wise enough to know that.  In contrast, Mrs. Clasky is carrying on with her real estate agent and thinks all will be forgiven.Cloris Leachman is wonderful as Mrs. Clasky's live in mother.

884659,A3PHYUU2CFZKBN,B0007OCG56,FreezerBurned,"[3, 5]","I can't say that this movie was a disapointment, because I didn't expect much from it anyway.  Director/screenwriter James L. Brooks dishes up a lump of all too common Hollywood schlock that seldom ventures far from cliche and total predictability.  First the good news--the movie gets two stars because the screenplay does have its moments.  In rare moments Brooks' dialogue forces us to open an eye with his satire of the modern ""how do we feign concern for eachother's feelings when we are prepared to wage any manner of psychological warfare to get what we want"" nuclear family meltdown.  Also, Tea Leoni delivered a flawed yet memorable rendition of the neurotic underachieving, over competitive housewife, Debra, showing us a character that more complex than the critics gave her credit for.  Also impressive was Shelbie Bruce as Christina, Flor's daughter, delivering her lines in English as well as Spanish, she was always interesting to see on the screen.  Otherwise the movie, like Adam Sandler, is listliss and unimaginative.I came to the movie as a Paz Vega fan.  After her stunning performance in ""Sex and Lucia"" it was hard to see her reduced to nods of incomprehension, mouth-open eye-darting incomprehension, and inexpressed frustration.  For approximately two thirds of the movie, her ""espagnol sola"" character is not allowed to say anything in English and the schtick wears thin.  And what a waste, to have a talent like Vega reduced to various renditions of speechless embarrassment.  But we can hardly blame Ms. Vega considering the material she had to work with.  It's a sad commentary on what an accomplished European actor will put up with in order to break into Hollywood.In other aspects, the screenplay drags the movie down.  It's treatment of the responsibilities of parenting verges on preachy, and the pivotal moment of sexual temptation between the husband and Flor is unconvincing.  Also, the editing reduced the movie to a formless lump as important subplot naratives are left without conclusion (i.e. the scene in which neurotic mother Debra sees her pudgy dauthter in the clothes that housekeeper Fluor altered to fit the daughter).After seeing what Spanish director/screenwriter Julio Medem did with Paz Vega, James L.Brooks handily demonstrates what Hollywood is all about--rank mediocity.

Brooks film, which you could commonly classify as your average chick flick (The Word Spy - chick flick). The film features Adam Sandler, T&eacute;a Leoni, Paz Vega, and Cloris Leachman (who I just love in this film).The movie follows the lives of Flor Moreno (Vega) and her daughter Christina. The film is the retelling of the events which lead to the opening sequence of the movie, the reading of Christina's application letter to Princeton. As we learn very early on in this film, Flor is a single parent, bound and determined to provide a better way of life for her daughter. Subsequently, Flor decides to flee Mexico, with her daughter along side, to find the American Dream in Los Angeles. With help from her cousin, she is able to land a housekeeping position with an upper income family, the Clasky's. It's Flor's employment with John and Deborah Clasky (Sandler and Leoni), that the film focuses.This film has all the elements that you want and need for this type of film to work; however, it just falls short of making you care about any of these individuals. There's your successful chef (John) who wishes to be not as successful, your cheating spouse (Deborah), your alcoholic mother (Evelyn), the ever-caring housekeeper (Flor) and her always thankful daughter (Christina); but somehow the events being presented are just a compilation of stories strung together. We know that John loves his family and makes every attempt to be there for them (even giving up interest in his restaurant in order to be home more), but his wife is still able to have an extra-marital affair. We are told that Flor loves the Clasky children; however, we are presented with only the clothes alteration story as proof. Finally, the ""I love you"" scene at the end of the film is just totally off base, and comes out of nowhere.If you are looking for your typical Adam Sandler Film, you're not going to find it in this film.

So, with eager anticipation, my daughter and I watched it the other night.  The premise of the story was great; a Mexican maid who speaks no English starts working for a wealthy, white family (husband, wife, daughter and son).  There were some of the usual conflicts you would expect in this situation; miscommunication, etc.  The wife, Mrs Clasky, played by Tea Leoni, was a self-obsessed control freak.  The husband, played by Adam Sandler, was a sweet and weak willed professional and successful chef.  Paz Vega played the Mexican maid, Flor.  She was the best part of the movie.  One of the major conflicts arose with Mrs Clasky taking too much of an interest in Flor's daughter and doing things with her and for her without her mother's permission.  I was quite disappointed with the orgasmic sex scene.  Mr Clasky gets some good news so he and his wife decide to ""celebrate"".  I don't have a problem with that, and I will grant that the scene effectively showed Mrs Clasky's self interest.  Mrs Clasky wore her sport bra (great abs Tea) and Mr Clasky was covered in the right places with a blanket.  But they went bouncing around ""forever"" and Mrs Clasky screamed and grunted herself into exhaustion.  This movie is rated PG-13, not R.  It should have been R.  I had to finally mute it because the scene went on and on.  If not for that sex scene, I would say the movie was okay and would be fun to watch once in a great while.  But because of the sex, I'm trashing it.  I wouldn't want to lend it to someone expecting a relatively clean PG-13 movie.

884664,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007OCG56,Grady Harp,"[118, 129]","When movie trailers come out months before the release of a film and movie billboards crowd the malls and other places trying to convince the public of what to expect (read 'how can we guarantee making the most money from the biggest crowd?'), it is difficult to get motivated to step over the hype and decide for yourself the merits and message of a little movie.SPANGLISH used slapstick approach, beginning with focus on Adam Sandler of the superfluff/toilet mouth 'comedy' genre, to publicize this little story into a COMEDY.  That was enough to keep this viewer out of the theater.  But seeing James L. Brooks current opus at home without all the hoopla of the theater crowd resulted in a pleasant discovery: this is a well-written little drama, peppered with some comedy, that addresses a lot of issues about parenting, cross-ethnicity, living your dream vs skimming off the top, having loyalty to the inner self, the desperate need for communication in today's loud world, alcoholism, etc.  Not the stuff for slapstick, nor is it treated that way.John Clasky (Adam Sandler in a straight role that allows him to show substance over pratt falls) is a successful chef who is able to support his family with a home in Beverly Hills and a summer home at the beach (obviously Malibu).  His wife Deborah (Tea Leoni in a wildly dysfunctional mother role which she handles well), in desperation for breathing room to pursue her lackluster life, hires a non-English speaking Latina maid Flor (Paz Vega) who has immigrated to the US with her young daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce, a amazingly bilingual young actress) to make a life for herself after her husband has left her.  Deborah's daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) is overweight and the victim of her mother's misconstrued attempts to correct her problem at the expense of acknowledging Bernice's self worth.Though busy with his successful restaurant, John finds time to be a loving father, a husband who is as supportive of his wild wife as is possible, and who gradually finds in the new Flor a gentle, honest, compassionate/passionate human being that seems to be a soul mate.  Things progress quickly: Flor learns English via language tapes on TV, Cristina moves in with the family when the move to Malibu occurs, Deborah dotes on the bright, attractive Cristina while ignoring her own daughter, Flor tends to the emotions of Bernice, and finally a marital crisis occurs which places into focus the idiosyncrasies of all members of the extended household (including Deborah's alcoholic mother - Cloris Leachman, as brilliant as ever).The manner in which Brooks brings this chaos to closure does not sell out the way most stories do: there are no pat answers here but altered individual perceptions are suggested and we are given the opportunity to resolve them as we wish.  Is this a comedy? No, though there are many cleverly funny lines and situations. This is a pertinent drama, unfortunately mislabeled in name and in media approach.  For this reviewer this is a tender film about family needs and personal goals.  The cast is excellent, each member taking risks that prove to be successful.  Give it a try!

884665,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,B0007OCG56,Gregg Hillier,"[2, 8]","This is a film that I was prepared to like. James L. Brooks, who brought us such great television with ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"" and the Oscar winning ""Terms of Endearment"" certainly knows how to write complicated characters and relationships, so the premise of ""Spanglish"" sounded like a winning idea. The fact that this film just does'nt work even as BAD films sometimes do, is a major disappointment. Part of the problem is there are simply too many people in this film and none feel fully characterized. But the majority of the blame falls on the two leads: Tea Leoni is an annoying, whiny, manipulative harpy and (gasp) Adam Sandler as sensitive Super-Dad John Clasky just don't work. Leoni overacts and destroys her character in the same way that Felicity Huffman  does on ""Desperate Housewives."" She evokes no sympathy or identification with her character. Sandler tries to be sweet and real but only succeeds in being sappy and synthetic.  Paz Vega, the ""Spanish"" in ""Spanglish"" is better than either Sandler or Leoni, despite the fact she does'nt speak English for most of the film. Her heartbreak and confusion as her daughter, well-played by Shelbie Bruce, becomes more ""LA"" and less hispanic, is touching and real.

Content yourselves with this folks: he could've ruined the race-and-class issues inherent in a film like this, the way ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Crash"" butchered race issues and ""Maid in Manhattan"" butchered class/ethnic issues.That said: great acting, great morality play.Acting. Shelbie Bruce as Cristina Moreno stole the show.  The simultaneous translation provided in the confrontation between Flor Morenoa and John Clasky is a classic.  Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, and known quantity whether you like him or not.  I like him.  Tea Leoni: loved her every since the short-lived Fox sitcom ""Flying Blind.""  I guess that dates me.  She gives 110% and plays her role at 110%, just below the caricature of an Anglo housewife-overachiever.  Sarah Steele was very good as well.Morality play.  Any film whose moral basis is strength in the face of adversity is OK by me, and very refreshing.  The film makes this point time and time again: the flight to Mexico, Flor's decision to devote time to Cristina, returning money for fear of its corrupting influence, non-consummation of a desired relationship because of marriage commitment.

884670,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B0007OCG56,James Carragher,"[8, 12]","The title of this review is advice that works on several levels.  In my case, I was enthusiastic about seeing Spanglish and my wife was not.  We went, bad decision.  In the case of the movie, Adam Sandler is America's greatest working chef -- hey, I didn't believe it either, but the New York Times review everyone reads hungrily in the movie says so -- and St. John to everyone (and especially Flor and his daughter Bernice, particularly well-played by Sarah Steele) but his wife with whom he never talks.  Now admittedly she is bipolar -- half the time a harping shrew and the other half some sort of New Age physical fitness addict who constantly screams ""Left, left"" to people she is passing as she jogs, as if they're going to commit some kamikaze leap into her path.  One hopes Tea Leoni has replaced the agent who steered her to this part, where among other things she is required to be made up to look like a 20 years younger version of Hillary Clinton.And why is this movie so interminably long, over two hours to reach its two banal lessons -- 1) be true to your roots and 2) you need to work continually at your relationship.

884671,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B0007OCG56,James Duckett,"[2, 3]","Here is the story of Cristina Moreno and her relationship with her mother, Flor.  The story (basically) begins when Cristina's father/Flor's husband takes off when she is a young child in Mexico.  Because of their poverty level, Flor and Cristina are forced to flee Mexico in hopes of finding a better life in Southern California.  In time, Flor takes up a job as a nanny or a housekeeper (the job wasn't very specific) for the Clasky family and is thrust upon the inner termoil that is present.The story is fun to follow and a real emotional roller-coaster.  However, I was blown away by the acting of six of the characters.  There has got to be some Oscar nominations in this movie somewhere for at least three of them.Flor is played by Paz Vega.  At the beginning of the movie she doesn't speak a word of English, even as she begins her job with the Clasky's.  Flor is very attractive and she has one of the best looks of shock, confusion, anger, and frustration at the events that unfold before her.  It is easy to fall in love with the character of Flor who lives for nobody except her daughter and understands the sacrifices it requires to raise a child.  If everybody raised children with the conviction that Flor had then there wouldn't be a messed up kid anywhere.John Clasky is played by Adam Sandler.  I am often a Sandler fan, except when he is shooting for laughs by being a complete drunken idiot.  If that is what you like and are expecting in this movie, don't go, you'll be sadly disappointed.  I'm glad he is shying away from that type of role these days, and he most definately doesn't play that role here.  John Clasky is the perfect father and if I had any complaint it was that he was too perfect.  Yes, some foibles were present, but I would have liked to have seen an uglier side of John Clasky to make this movie a bit more real.  However, Sandler still delivers a stand-up job that should be loudly applauded.Next is Shelbie Bruce, who plays Flor's daughter, Cristina.  As a child actor (I'm guessing 10 years old) she does an incredible job.  Cristina is a child who thinks she knows what is best for herself and is open to the manipulations of Deborah Clasky.  She is often at odds with her mother on doing what is right and is torn apart by the decisions that her mother makes.  There was a scene where Flor, who hasn't learned to speak English, confronts John Clasky and uses Cristina as a translater.  Shelbie Bruce does a wonderful job not only translating the words of her mother, but also her feeling.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Shelbie Bruce even does a great job at the end of the movie when she finally confronts Flor because of the decisions Flor has made for her.And on to my three favorite characters.The first is Tea Leoni who plays Deborah Clasky.  I've always liked Tea Leoni as she usually shines in every movie she is in.  However, this is the first movie where she really lets herself go, in my opinion (granted, I haven't seen most of her movies).  There are scenes where she plays her stunningly beautiful self but then there are scenes where she goes the complete opposite direction.  She gets so bad in one scene that her mother (played by Cloris Leachman, she is next) comments that she needs a fire hose to clean herself up.  It is nice to see somebody like her allow herself to get so undone in a movie.  She can play emotion very well and she doesn't fail here as she plays every emotion I've ever felt in my life.The second is Cloris Leachman, who plays Deborah Clasky's mother.  Every scene with her in it just shines, and most of them just made me laugh out loud.  She most definately has the best and funniest lines of the movie.  However, Cloris' performance is dead on in every scene of the movie as, she too, must go through most of the emotional spectrum.And finally, the older Clasky child is Bernice, who is played by Sarah Steele.  Bernice is looking for some affection from her parents, especially  her mother.  You see some of the few moments of excitement in her eyes when she thinks she is being treated by her mother, and you totally identify with her during her disappointments.  Again, she also has a dead-on performance with every scene she is in and forces you to emphasize with the problems her character has.The story has a great message, which is that there is no greater sacrifice than those for your children and often through your children.  Some of the lines and the logic seemed a bit off, but the ending leaves you satisfied that you got your money's worth in a movie.  I especially love the highlighted differences between the American and Latino cultures.  I would recommend this movie for those who really enjoy a great performance on the screen.",4,"Fantastic acting, gripping story, but off at parts",1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,4754,"['Here', 'story', 'Cristina', 'Moreno', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Flor', 'story', 'basically', 'when', 'Cristina', 'father/Flor', 'husband', 'off', 'when', 'young', 'child', 'Mexico', 'poverty', 'level', 'Flor', 'Cristina', 'are', 'forced', 'flee', 'Mexico', 'hopes', 'finding', 'better', 'life', 'Southern', 'California', 'time', 'Flor', 'up', 'job', 'nanny', 'housekeeper', 'job', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'specific', 'Clasky', 'family', 'thrust', 'inner', 'termoil', 'present.The', 'story', 'fun', 'follow', 'real', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'However', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'acting', 'six', 'characters', 'got', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'least', 'three', 'them.Flor', 'played', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'beginning', 'movie', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'English', 'even', 'job', 'Clasky', 'Flor', 'very', 'attractive', 'one', 'best', 'looks', 'shock', 'confusion', 'anger', 'frustration', 'events', 'unfold', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', 'character', 'Flor', 'who', 'nobody', 'daughter', 'sacrifices', 'raise', 'child', 'everybody', 'raised', 'children', 'conviction', 'Flor', 'had', 'then', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'messed', 'up', 'kid', 'anywhere.John', 'Clasky', 'played', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'am', 'often', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'when', 'shooting', 'laughs', 'being', 'complete', 'drunken', 'idiot', 'what', 'like', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'shying', 'away', 'type', 'role', 'days', 'most', 'definately', ""n't"", 'play', 'role', 'here', 'John', 'Clasky', 'perfect', 'father', 'had', 'complaint', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'perfect', 'Yes', 'foibles', 'were', 'present', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'uglier', 'side', 'John', 'Clasky', 'make', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'real', 'However', 'Sandler', 'still', 'stand-up', 'job', 'should', 'be', 'loudly', 'applauded.Next', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'who', 'Flor', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'child', 'actor', ""'m"", 'guessing', '10', 'years', 'old', 'incredible', 'job', 'Cristina', 'child', 'who', 'what', 'best', 'herself', 'open', 'manipulations', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', 'often', 'odds', 'mother', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'torn', 'apart', 'decisions', 'mother', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Flor', 'who', ""n't"", 'learned', 'speak', 'English', 'John', 'Clasky', 'Cristina', 'translater', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'wonderful', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'translating', 'words', 'mother', 'also', 'feeling', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'even', 'great', 'job', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'finally', 'confronts', 'Flor', 'decisions', 'Flor', 'made', 'her.And', 'three', 'favorite', 'characters.The', 'first', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'who', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'usually', 'shines', 'movie', 'However', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'really', 'go', 'opinion', 'granted', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'self', 'then', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'complete', 'opposite', 'direction', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'scene', 'mother', 'played', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'next', 'comments', 'fire', 'hose', 'clean', 'up', 'nice', 'see', 'somebody', 'allow', 'herself', 'get', 'so', 'undone', 'movie', 'can', 'play', 'emotion', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'fail', 'here', 'emotion', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'felt', 'life.The', 'second', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'who', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', 'mother', 'scene', 'just', 'shines', 'most', 'just', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'most', 'definately', 'best', 'funniest', 'lines', 'movie', 'However', 'Cloris', 'performance', 'dead', 'scene', 'movie', 'too', 'must', 'go', 'most', 'emotional', 'spectrum.And', 'finally', 'older', 'Clasky', 'child', 'Bernice', 'who', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'Bernice', 'looking', 'affection', 'parents', 'especially', 'mother', 'see', 'few', 'moments', 'excitement', 'eyes', 'when', 'being', 'treated', 'mother', 'totally', 'identify', 'disappointments', 'Again', 'also', 'dead-on', 'performance', 'scene', 'forces', 'emphasize', 'problems', 'character', 'has.The', 'story', 'great', 'message', 'greater', 'sacrifice', 'children', 'often', 'children', 'lines', 'logic', 'seemed', 'bit', 'off', 'ending', 'leaves', 'satisfied', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'movie', 'especially', 'love', 'highlighted', 'differences', 'American', 'Latino', 'cultures', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'really', 'enjoy', 'great', 'performance', 'screen']",Spanglish

A wonderful foil to Sandler's even tempered character. While you might think this is a great date movie, I think it's a better married with children couple date movie. Lots of truisms here.

884673,A1Y71YV0PDWZ9L,B0007OCG56,"Jasmine ""Crimson Joy""","[2, 4]","Spanglish was a movie that had all the elements necessary for a great romantic comedy and didn't live up to its potential. After watching the commercials for it on TV, with the overwight daughter, the alchoholic grandmother and the overall messed up but rich family, I felt the story left much to be desired overall and was incomplete.The story is narrated to us by Flor's daughter. Despite this, her character is left a blank throughout much of the story, being much more an object than a character. The main character of interest is, of course, the mother. She cannot speak English, however and there aren't any subtitles. Despite this, you imediately sympathise with her and she is much easier to understand than the rest of the cast.The family poses the largest problem. The father, first presented as a wimpy nice-guys-finish-last type is by the endthe same as when he started. He is so passive throughout the whole film you want to shake some sense into him. But they try to convince you he is perfect. The mother on the other hand is incredibly annoying, and by the end she hasn't changed one jot either. She's superficial, selfish and arrogant. The daughter was wonderful, but the ideas of her being overweight are dumped on you the first half-hour, than she disappears entirely from the story and appears again at the end for five minutes. Her problems have not been resolved either. The boy had nothing to do with anything and the grandmother suddenly says near the end 'I quit drinking a month ago' and that's that.Ultimately, the story was really about nothing more than a maid who went to work for some people and left. She didn't change their lives. They didn't change theirs. The story may very well not have happened. The only significant change was that of the daughter, which was told more than shown, and the daughter had such little involvement in the story in the first place, you find yourself not really caring.I did like the themes of sacrificing for your children and staying true to your culture and family. When her loveable daughter started to be become the all-American Valley-girl stereotype I felt truly appaled and was pleased at the way it was all resolved.In the end, it was an enjoyable movie. Long, but enjoyable. A rediculously large portion of it was spent with the huge fights between Flor and her employers, which was really silly and unneeded. So much was brought into the movie you kept waiting for any sort of resolution, but none ever came. When it ended, you have this feeling of, what was the point?

884678,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007OCG56,Joe Sherry,"[3, 5]","A film by James L BrooksWhen Flor's (Paz Vega) husband leaves her she is forced to emigrate from Mexico to America to find work so she can support herself and her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce).  After initially finding a lower paying job in a Mexican enclave within Las Angeles, Flor finds work as a housekeeper for Deborah (Tea Leoni).  Deborah is a wealthy, self-absorbed society woman who doesn't really think of the feelings of other people.  She is also absolutely crazy in a manic sort of a way.  Her husband, John (Adam Sandler) is the normal one.  He is a very successful chef and will soon be an even more successful chef when a top critic gives him a fantastic review.  But, he is a committed family man who deeply loves his daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) and while he must love his wife for some reason, he is very frustrated with her because her callous disregard for the feelings of Bernie even though Deborah thinks she is doing the right thing.Into this strange, messed up family comes Flor.  She is gentle, and kind, and she doesn't speak a lick of English.  Translation and communication comes through Cristina, stuck between the excitement of a new way of life provided by Deborah (she treats Cristina better than she does her own daughter) and the steady tranquil traditions of her mother.  The conflict of ""Spanglish"" comes in the form of Deborah.  Deborah will whisk Cristina away for a day long excursion without asking permission from Flor.  Her hurtful comments towards Bernie is upsetting John almost as much as Bernie.  Deborah is paying little attention to her own husband or to her family except as they might relate towards her and her wishes.  It is no wonder that we see a budding friendship (could it be more?) between John and Flor.  John, like Flor, is gentle and kind and loving and is being hurt by his wife far more than he deserves.There is no true narrative here in the sense that ""Spanglish"" does not directly follow a storyline.  What we have is a movie about the relationships between these characters, most of whom are very likeable.  The crazy thing is that we want John to leave his wife because we know that he would be very happy with Flor and that they would treat each other well.  We want their children to get the love and attention they deserve.  We know that Flor's presence has been nothing but a good thing to John's family and that she is a positive influence with how steady and responsible she is.  If there is a villain here it is Deborah because she is just so unlikeable, yet at heart she must be a good person for John to have married her in the first place.  We only barely see glimpses of her heart, though.""Spanglish"" has quite a bit going for it.  The movie has a stellar cast which also includes Cloris Leachman has Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn.  Leachman has all the best lines in the movie and I will be surprised if she doesn't pick up an Oscar nomination for her work here.  She steals every scene she is in.  The idea of an alcoholic mother could be a very harsh character, but in ""Spanglish"" Evelyn is so good natured that one could almost believe that it was Deborah that drove her mother towards the bottle.  Another highlight in this movie is Cristina's translations of conversations between her mother and John.  Not only does Cristina translate the words and the passion of Flor, but also the gestures and so we get a bit of perfect physical comedy with a younger girl saying very adult things.The only real problem with ""Spanglish"" is that despite the strength of all of its parts, the film itself doesn't come together to make a whole that is nearly as good.  We have a film about several wonderful characters working through their problems, but it doesn't amount to very much.  I can't explain it.  ""Spanglish"" is a nice movie, a decent movie and is filled with a certain amount of heartwarming material, but perhaps because of Deborah and the conclusion, it never really delivers the promise or the pedigree of the filmmakers.

Right. That's like defining World War II as a minor squabble that discomfited Europe and the Far East.The gorgeous Spanish (as in Spain) actress Paz Vega makes her American screen debut as Flor, who, with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), travel up from Mexico to SoCal for the employment opportunities. (Whether they're ""documented"" or not is, in this politically correct age, left to the imagination.) Though she speaks no English, Flor lands a job as a housekeeper with the well-to-do Clasky family, which includes the Mister, John (Adam Sandler), the Missus, Deborah (Tea Leoni), daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele), and Deborah's resident, alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). There's also a Clasky son, but his role is so minor as to go virtually unnoticed. When necessary, Cristina, who speaks English like a native, translates for her Mom. There must be wonderful language schools for the economically challenged south of the border.Flor, whose role eventually evolves to live-in maid as the household migrates from Beverly Hills to a rented Malibu beach house for the summer, stumbles into a tense situation. Deborah is unsatisfied with her marriage. John, owner/#1 chef of a four-star restaurant, is Mr. Nice Guy without a clue. Deborah has an awkward relationship with Bernice, who, overweight and with dental braces, doesn't meet Mom's expectations; Deborah seemingly has no relationship with her son at all, good or bad; Deborah disapproves of Evelyn's constant drinking. Deborah spends her time running to keep in shape and satisfy some inner concept of self image. Come to think of it, Deborah doesn't do much of anything. The plot's conflict emerges as Deborah begins to treat the perfect Cristina as her own daughter without Flor's permission, e.g., having their hair highlighted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school. In the meantime, John is rendered incoherent by Flor's beauty and warmth, but, being a decent fellow, he doesn't do anything about it that might otherwise be expected of a male with normal hormone levels.Superficially, SPANGLISH has appeal. Deborah remains engaging even as she verges on Total Bitch. (OK, ok. I think Tea Leoni is a Hottie.) And there are some genuinely funny moments, as when Cristina translates an overwrought outburst by Flor, complete with vigorous hand and arm waving, and when Evelyn sobers up and tells her daughter to snap out of it. My biggest problem is with Paz Vega as Flor. She's truly eye candy I can appreciate, but I think the producers of the film want the audience to react to her as did the stupefied John, i.e., assign her a separate gender altogether based on looks. When Flor and Cristina walk off into the California sunset at the film's conclusion, all the difficulties back at the Clasky house are left unresolved. Indeed, the resentment that Bernice felt for having her place in Mom's affections co-opted by Cristine was never even dealt with. So, what was all this except a beauty contest with Vega as the preordained winner?While I'm allowing for the fact that the point of the film was perhaps to introduce Paz to American audiences, I still felt manipulated more than the norm by the scriptwriters. If you want to see a substantive role in current release by an acknowledged screen beauty, see CLOSER starring Julia Roberts. Granted, it's not a comedy, or even something for the whole family, but at least it's not fluff masquerading as a movie with a message.",3,Can Paz Vega be my housekeeper?,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,3656,"['plot', 'SPANGLISH', 'been', 'described', 'story', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'daughter', 'who', 'travel', 'way', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'bring', 'sanity', 'crazy', 'Anglo', 'family', 'Right', 'defining', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'minor', 'squabble', 'discomfited', 'Europe', 'Far', 'East.The', 'gorgeous', 'Spanish', 'Spain', 'actress', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'American', 'screen', 'debut', 'Flor', 'who', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'travel', 'up', 'Mexico', 'SoCal', 'employment', 'opportunities', ""'re"", 'documented', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'age', 'left', 'imagination', 'English', 'Flor', 'job', 'housekeeper', 'well-to-do', 'Clasky', 'family', 'Mister', 'John', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Missus', 'Deborah', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'daughter', 'Bernice', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'Deborah', 'resident', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'also', 'Clasky', 'son', 'role', 'so', 'minor', 'go', 'virtually', 'unnoticed', 'When', 'necessary', 'Cristina', 'who', 'English', 'native', 'translates', 'Mom', 'must', 'be', 'wonderful', 'language', 'schools', 'economically', 'challenged', 'south', 'border.Flor', 'role', 'eventually', 'live-in', 'maid', 'household', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'rented', 'Malibu', 'beach', 'house', 'summer', 'tense', 'situation', 'Deborah', 'unsatisfied', 'marriage', 'John', 'owner/', '1', 'chef', 'four-star', 'restaurant', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'clue', 'Deborah', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'Bernice', 'who', 'overweight', 'dental', 'braces', ""n't"", 'meet', 'Mom', 'expectations', 'Deborah', 'seemingly', 'relationship', 'son', 'good', 'bad', 'Deborah', 'Evelyn', 'constant', 'drinking', 'Deborah', 'time', 'running', 'keep', 'shape', 'satisfy', 'inner', 'concept', 'self', 'image', 'Come', 'think', 'Deborah', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'plot', 'conflict', 'Deborah', 'treat', 'perfect', 'Cristina', 'own', 'daughter', 'Flor', 'permission', 'e.g.', 'having', 'hair', 'highlighted', 'together', 'getting', 'Cristina', 'enrolled', 'prestigious', 'private', 'school', 'meantime', 'John', 'rendered', 'incoherent', 'Flor', 'beauty', 'warmth', 'being', 'decent', 'fellow', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'expected', 'male', 'normal', 'hormone', 'levels.Superficially', 'SPANGLISH', 'appeal', 'Deborah', 'engaging', 'even', 'Total', 'Bitch', 'OK', 'ok', 'think', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Hottie', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'Cristina', 'overwrought', 'outburst', 'Flor', 'complete', 'vigorous', 'hand', 'arm', 'waving', 'when', 'Evelyn', 'up', 'daughter', 'snap', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Flor', 'truly', 'eye', 'candy', 'can', 'appreciate', 'think', 'producers', 'film', 'want', 'audience', 'react', 'did', 'stupefied', 'John', 'i.e.', 'assign', 'separate', 'gender', 'altogether', 'based', 'looks', 'When', 'Flor', 'Cristina', 'walk', 'California', 'sunset', 'film', 'conclusion', 'difficulties', 'back', 'Clasky', 'house', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'Indeed', 'resentment', 'Bernice', 'felt', 'having', 'place', 'Mom', 'affections', 'co-opted', 'Cristine', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'So', 'what', 'was', 'beauty', 'contest', 'Vega', 'preordained', 'winner', ""'m"", 'allowing', 'fact', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'perhaps', 'introduce', 'Paz', 'American', 'audiences', 'still', 'felt', 'manipulated', 'more', 'norm', 'scriptwriters', 'want', 'see', 'substantive', 'role', 'current', 'release', 'acknowledged', 'screen', 'beauty', 'see', 'CLOSER', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Granted', 'not', 'comedy', 'even', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'least', 'not', 'fluff', 'masquerading', 'movie', 'message']",Spanglish
884681,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,B0007OCG56,Joseph J. Slevin,"[0, 2]","If it were possible to rate this movie higher than a four but not quite a five I would do so.  This is really a great love story, more about a love of life and how mixed up we all are at times in our relationships.We have a housekeeper who has nothing but her daughter, character and her morality living with a very rich and somewhat well known family in Malibu or Beverly Hills, depending on the timing of the movie.  It is fast paced, sometimes funny, sometimes sad and you also experience a whole wide range of emotions.Brooks does a good job of developing the characters and even the underlying theme has some basis in real life.  Tia Leoni plays a very frustrated housewife who co-owns her husbands 4 star restaurant.  This is a unique role for me to see Leoni in.  I have enjoyed her in Family Man and Deep Impact, but Leoni is superb in this role.  At times you just think, where does she get off with her approach to life?

884690,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0007OCG56,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 7]","James L. Brooks' SPANGLISH is a movie about the clash of cultures and lifestyles. In the middle of the movie, Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid for the affluent Clasky family in California, sees her young daughter, Cristina, enjoying the rich lifestyle, and starts to feel disturbed by it, fearing that perhaps her daughter is starting to forget all the old cultural traditions as she is seduced by wealth. There is one scene in this section of the film that, in its own way, sums up its subtle cultural conflict: an argument that develops between Flor and John Clasky (Adam Sandler, who gives another fine dramatic performance here), in which Flor accuses Mr. Clasky of flaunting wealth and being ""smug,"" and Mr. Clasky fires back at her, calling her a ""hypocrite."" Why deny your daughter this life if she wants it?, he seems to be saying.It is this kind of thematic questioning and ambivalence that gives SPANGLISH its real interest and unassuming power; it's why I think the movie is worth seeing, even though it isn't perfect. The character of Deborah Clasky---a caricature of neurosis and well-meaning insensitivity---is a serious (and not all that funny) flaw to Brooks' conception, since, as hard as Tea Leoni tries to humanize the character, her over-the-top neurotic well-meaning villainy threatens to reduce the central cultural conflict between affluence and tradition to a one-sided affair (I mean, which Mexican maid would really want their kid to grow up to be a Deborah Clasky? When you see the film, you'll see what I mean). And the final scene, between Flor and a gravely-disappointed Cristina, is a little disturbing in its implication that mere cultural pride trumps even getting a good education if offered it.Still, I consider those flaws aberrations in what is essentially a searching film about whether becoming affluent does (or should) trump one's cultural roots. Because it provokes these kinds of interesting and thoughtful questions, SPANGLISH is a film worth seeing and reflecting.

884692,A3LQ06WS0PMWSQ,B0007OCG56,"Khyraen ""Superintendent, Barlow Christian Aca...","[7, 11]","I just watched this movie last night and I was not impressed.  I cannot say I was disappointed because Sandler's movies tend to be of the ""potty-humor"" and ""pop-culture"" lot, of which I do not care for either, so I didn't expect much.  But this movie managed to fall short of even my expectations.If you were looking for Sandler humor, it was there if you looked close enough; but there was simply not enough to have you laughing like you expect to when you see a movie that he stars in.On the other hand, if you were looking to see a good movie, one that would entertain you for about 2 hours on a lazy evening, this film fell even shorter.  There were gaps in the story line, underdeveloped characters, difficult scenes, and an attempt to get the audience to wish for an affair that would end a family.The introduction to the upper-class white family left you with a question that the film never answers: What did the boy do to upset his mother?  The film introduces Sandler's character in the same scene as this question, and then drops the question as if it were never asked.  (The question as to the boy's terrible act is answered in a deleted scene you can watch on the DVD.)And speaking of ""as if it were never"" introduced, we meet Sandler's son, and then it is as if he doesn't exist until almost the end of the film when he says goodbye to the housekeeper from the pool.  That's it.  He is one member of a family of four and yet his character is never developed.  Where is he when the daughter is being taken to school or mom is up all night crying?Also, from the moment Sandler sees the new housekeeper, it is obvious that they will fall for each other and you are expected to cheer for this affair (since the wife is such an odd, irritating, shallow, freak of a woman.)  To cement the fact that Sandler's character should and rightfully could have an affair (and that you ""should"" be happy for it), the odd-ball wife cheats on her perfect, sensitive, loving husband.(Perhaps, if Mr. Perfect had not married for looks and a hot body, but rather married a woman for her personality qualities and compatibility, he would be appreciated more as a husband and father.  Alas, we are asked instead to pity him for his poor selection and selfish short-sidedness.)Let's not even talk about watching Sandler's character have s*x with his wife.  You are invited into their room to watch it from beginning to end.  There isn't much flesh to see, but you do get to hear the misses' strange, p*rno-like climax noises.  This scene was awkward and embarrassing to watch.It was painful to see how Sandler's wife in the film treats their daughter.  While it helps to establish how shallow the wife truly is, it is difficult to believe Sandler's character never takes a stand for his daughter as her self-worth is torn apart by her mother's perverse actions.  As a mother of five children, this was truly painful to watch.Then there is the contrast between the ""wonderful"" ethnic life the housekeeper wants for her daughter and the ""shallow,"" Americanized life the Caucasian family lives.  While I think it is fantastic that a mother would want her daughter to remember who she is, and I agree that part of that identity is where she came from, none of the negative sides of that life were shown, while the Americanized life's down-sides were exaggerated to ridiculousness.For example, this little girl is growing up in the Barrio.  They are quite poor and there can be little doubt that the daughter attends a school that is filled with gangs, drugs, and other pitfalls.  However, the private school where her daughter has obtained a scholarship is represented as an ""evil.""  Also, while the Caucasian family is represented as shallow, distant, and constantly fighting, the Hispanic people in the film  are represented as warm, close, and deep.Even with this ridiculous bias, some stupid Hispanic stereo-types rear their ugly heads.  From the family crossing illegally into the States (there are many legal Mexican immigrants who struggle to survive and find balance--not all Hispanic people are illegals) to the ""naive"" Hispanic woman falling for a total rip-off when trying to purchase a program to learn to speak English, this movie has plenty of unfavorable stereo-types of Mexican immigrants.Overall, I generously give this movie 2 stars.

884697,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007OCG56,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","In ""The Family Man"" T&eacute;a Leoni played the wife of Nicholas Cage and was as comfortable playing the character of Kate as the character was comfortable in her life.  I kept thinking how lucky Cage's character was to be married to her and hoped for David Ducovny's sake that Leoni was not really acting.  I bring up that 2000 film as a reference point because Leoni plays the wife of Adam Sandler in the 2004 film ""Spanglish"" and she is not just at the other end of the spousal spectrum she has gone around the bend.  Her Deborah Clasky is an awful person (if I did not know this the fact my wife said as much a half-dozen times during the movie would have been a clue).  She is an awful wife to her husband, an awful mother to her daughter, and an awful employer to her hired help.  What makes her so awful is that she is not abusive, so it is not a question of calling the cops and having her carted away to the betterment of her family.  She is not a malicious person and it is because her husband obviously loves her and that her daughter so desperately needs her that we want her to stop being an awful person.  The big question is whether there is anything there inside of her to build a decent human being.This might make ""Spanglish"" seems like a horror show, but it really is a romantic comedy.  The story is narrated by Christina (Aimee Garcia) a young girl who has written her college application to Princeton explaining why her mother is the most influential person in her life (""no contest"").  We learn how Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) took young Christina from Mexico to Los Angeles and managed to work two jobs without ever having to learn English.  But as Christina (Shelbie Bruce) becomes a teenager, Flor has to find one job that will pay as much as too so she can see that her daughter is raised right.  That is how Flor ends up in the Clasky household.  John (Sandler) is a great chef whose restaurant is on the cusp of making it big while Deborah has been downsized out of a job into being a stay home mom where she has been reading way too many books on parenting.  She thinks her daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) should be a size 8 and the stars in her eyes are blinding her to the tears in her daughter's eyes.  To add insult to injury, Deb is captivated by Christina, who seems the perfect daughter she deserves.  Without any other thoughts in her pretty head, Deborah starts doing things she should not be doing.The Claskys have a son, Georgie (Ian Hyland), but his only real problem is that when he has nightmares his maternal grandmother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) teaches him another song she sang when she was a big jazz singer.  Otherwise grandma links to drink a lot of wine.  Meanwhile Deborah's self-absorption is going beyond being neurotic or merely having the type of mid-life crisis that sudden unemployment can provoke into a black hole that is threatening to suck in the rest of the characters.  The saving Grace is Flor, who might not understand the language but understands the emotional turmoil of the household she has entered.  However, just as she begins to but this fractured family back together Deborah insists on finding a new way of tearing it apart and making Flor and Christina part of the madness as well.  Compared to his crazy wife John is obviously going to find Flor attractive, and she is aware of the qualities he has that his wife is not so much ignoring as trying to beat out of him.Leoni is such a force of nature gone awry in this film that you have to stop and take notice that the others are turning in fine performances as well.  Sandler has not weaned himself of all of his comic elements but like ""Fifty First Dates"" this film proves that he can play a really nice guy, albeit with moments of manic insanity (several of his best moments are in the deleted scenes).  Paz Vega is a Spanish actress who signed up for the project without knowing English, which is perfect for the role, as is the fact that she manages to be both sexy and sweet, often at the same time (which is a neat trick).  She is the central character in ""Spanglish,"" but since she is the eye of the hurricance while the Clasky marriage is imploding you can sometimes forget that fact.  Both of the young actresses hold their own with the grownups, with Bruce having a great scene where she mediates rather than just translate for her mother and John having a fight and Steele nailing the pain of a teenage daughter who is closer to her dad than she is to her mom at a time when she needs her mom the most.  Leachman actually refrains from stealing every scene she is in, but she does pick her moments and she becomes the key to her daughter's salvation, which is not a move I saw coming.",4,Sometimes low self-esteem is just good common sense...,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,4716,"['Family', 'Man', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'played', 'wife', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'was', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'character', 'Kate', 'character', 'was', 'comfortable', 'life', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'lucky', 'Cage', 'character', 'was', 'be', 'married', 'hoped', 'David', 'Ducovny', 'sake', 'Leoni', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'acting', 'bring', 'up', '2000', 'film', 'reference', 'point', 'Leoni', 'wife', 'Adam', 'Sandler', '2004', 'film', 'Spanglish', 'not', 'just', 'other', 'end', 'spousal', 'spectrum', 'gone', 'bend', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', 'awful', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'fact', 'wife', 'said', 'much', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'clue', 'awful', 'wife', 'husband', 'awful', 'mother', 'daughter', 'awful', 'employer', 'hired', 'help', 'What', 'so', 'awful', 'not', 'abusive', 'not', 'question', 'calling', 'cops', 'having', 'carted', 'away', 'betterment', 'family', 'not', 'malicious', 'person', 'husband', 'obviously', 'daughter', 'so', 'desperately', 'want', 'stop', 'being', 'awful', 'person', 'big', 'question', 'anything', 'there', 'build', 'decent', 'human', 'being.This', 'might', 'make', 'Spanglish', 'horror', 'show', 'really', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'story', 'narrated', 'Christina', 'Aimee', 'Garcia', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'written', 'college', 'application', 'Princeton', 'explaining', 'why', 'mother', 'most', 'influential', 'person', 'life', 'contest', 'learn', 'how', 'Flor', 'Moreno', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'took', 'young', 'Christina', 'Mexico', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'managed', 'work', 'two', 'jobs', 'ever', 'having', 'learn', 'English', 'Christina', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'teenager', 'Flor', 'find', 'one', 'job', 'will', 'pay', 'as', 'much', 'too', 'can', 'see', 'daughter', 'raised', 'right', 'how', 'Flor', 'up', 'Clasky', 'household', 'John', 'Sandler', 'great', 'chef', 'restaurant', 'cusp', 'making', 'big', 'Deborah', 'been', 'downsized', 'job', 'being', 'stay', 'home', 'mom', 'where', 'been', 'reading', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'books', 'parenting', 'daughter', 'Bernie', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'should', 'be', 'size', '8', 'stars', 'eyes', 'are', 'blinding', 'tears', 'daughter', 'eyes', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Deb', 'captivated', 'Christina', 'who', 'perfect', 'daughter', 'other', 'thoughts', 'pretty', 'head', 'Deborah', 'doing', 'things', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'doing.The', 'Claskys', 'have', 'son', 'Georgie', 'Ian', 'Hyland', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'when', 'maternal', 'grandmother', 'Evelyn', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'song', 'sang', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'jazz', 'singer', 'Otherwise', 'grandma', 'links', 'drink', 'lot', 'wine', 'Meanwhile', 'Deborah', 'self-absorption', 'going', 'being', 'neurotic', 'merely', 'having', 'type', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'sudden', 'unemployment', 'can', 'provoke', 'black', 'hole', 'threatening', 'suck', 'rest', 'characters', 'saving', 'Grace', 'Flor', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'language', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'household', 'entered', 'However', 'just', 'fractured', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'Deborah', 'finding', 'new', 'way', 'tearing', 'apart', 'making', 'Flor', 'Christina', 'part', 'madness', 'as', 'well', 'Compared', 'crazy', 'wife', 'John', 'obviously', 'going', 'find', 'Flor', 'attractive', 'aware', 'qualities', 'wife', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ignoring', 'trying', 'beat', 'him.Leoni', 'such', 'force', 'nature', 'gone', 'awry', 'film', 'have', 'stop', 'take', 'notice', 'others', 'are', 'turning', 'fine', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Sandler', 'not', 'weaned', 'comic', 'elements', 'Fifty', 'First', 'Dates', 'film', 'can', 'play', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'moments', 'manic', 'insanity', 'several', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Spanish', 'actress', 'who', 'signed', 'up', 'project', 'knowing', 'English', 'perfect', 'role', 'fact', 'be', 'sexy', 'sweet', 'often', 'same', 'time', 'neat', 'trick', 'central', 'character', 'Spanglish', 'eye', 'hurricance', 'Clasky', 'marriage', 'imploding', 'can', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'fact', 'young', 'actresses', 'hold', 'own', 'grownups', 'Bruce', 'having', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'rather', 'just', 'translate', 'mother', 'John', 'having', 'fight', 'Steele', 'nailing', 'pain', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'closer', 'dad', 'mom', 'time', 'when', 'mom', 'most', 'Leachman', 'actually', 'stealing', 'scene', 'pick', 'moments', 'key', 'daughter', 'salvation', 'not', 'move', 'saw', 'coming']",Spanglish

It is the story of a California family that hires a Mexican cleaning lady with no knowledge of English that uses her daughter as an interpreter.

Consequently, she becomes fond of her employers and wishes to help them bridge their differences, until she falls in love with the man of the family and the woman of the family falls in love with her daughter....In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great, with the exception of Tea Leoni who does a wonderful job of portraying the psychotic wife), while the dialogues and the plot are just average.The characters are, overall, weak, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. the alcoholic mother in law and the two kids)Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.

884702,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B0007OCG56,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[1, 5]","This unusual film is surprisingly entertaining, much more interesting than its advertising would suggest. The story is a familiar one, need vs. plenty, as a young mother and her daughter emigrate from Mexico, crossing the border illegally in hopes of a better life. Flor (Paz Vega) is hired to work as a domestic in a wealthy household, although she speaks not a word of English. John Clasky (Adam Sandler) is an award-winning chef, who provides a lifestyle for his wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) and daughter that includes a Malibu beach house for the summer. Flor is induced to live at the Malibu home and care for the family when it is suggested that her daughter, Christina (Victoria Luna) come along. Flor finds her parenting challenged at every point by a spoiled and insensitive Deborah, a self-centered fitness junkie with a penchant for talking her family into submission.Without a trace of subtlety, Deborah confronts her daughter's weight problem, under the guise of what is best for the girl, her husband chagrined by his wife's lack of sensitivity, but basically ineffective in the family dynamic. Turning to the lively and lovely Christina, Deborah smothers the child with opportunities that would otherwise be denied her, Deborah oblivious to anyone's needs but her own. Frustrated and hampered by the language barrier, understanding instinctively that she will need every tool available to offset Christina's growing ease with privilege and access, Flor takes a crash course in English. A determined Flor fights for her own territory and in the process wins the affection of the largely ignored John. Meanwhile Deborah pursues her own interests at the risk of her happy, if dysfunctional home. It would be easy to imagine the outcome of this domestic drama, but director James L. Brooks avoids the predictable, delivering a thought-provoking ending that gives a welcome twist to the immigrant issue.Paz Vega (Flor) and Victoria Luna (Christina) provide the emotional core of this film, with engaging support from Sandler and Sarah Steele, as his daughter, Bernice. Vega shines on the screen, her acting a luminous antidote to the over-the-top Leoni, who ties herself into such an emotional knot that she becomes a parody of the self-indulgent over-privileged. For all her emotional gymnastics, Leoni never comes close to Vega, whose role is all the more powerful for its understatement.

884703,AZTDHDUTVOSCC,B0007OCG56,"mallard ""calvin""","[9, 13]","It's fitting that James L. Brooks would call his new movie ""Spanglish."" He certainly knows a thing or two about jamming two distinct languages together to make a messy, vivid, wildly popular hybrid.If you're looking for someone to thank (or blame) for the merging of television and movies into a new, mongrel language, Brooks is your man. He worked first in television, creating the touchstone 1970s sitcoms ""Taxi"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoffs.In the '80s, he jumped to movies -- a much bigger leap in those days -- winning multiple Oscars his first time out, with ""Terms of Endearment,"" and following up with the hit ""Broadcast News.""Along the way, he practically invented the dramedy, that audience-pleasing combination of the TV sitcom and the movie tear-jerker that forces you -- even against your will -- to laugh through your tears.With ""Spanglish,"" his fifth film as writer-director, Brooks produces plenty of laughter and tears. But he does not produce either a coherent, focused story or the sort of complex, full-blooded characters who can take the movie beyond sitcom punch lines and the heartwarming lessons of the ""very special episode.""Flor (Paz Vega) moves from Mexico to Los Angeles in search of a better life for her daughter, 12-year-old Cristina (Shelbie Bruce). The search leads her to the exotic land of Bel Air, where she takes a job as a housekeeper for the rich, successful, desperately unhappy Clasky family.Why all the unhappiness? Astonishingly for such a smart writer, Brooks pins the blame on one person: Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni), a neurotic, self-involved woman who is so tightly wound you expect her head to start spinning like Linda Blair's in ""The Exorcist.""The comparison is not out of line. Deborah is possessed by the competitive, consumerist demons of upper-middle-class America, and they have turned her into a monster who humiliates her children, neglects her husband, betrays those she loves and exercises herself to the point of exhaustion. Leoni, an agile comedian, does her best to make Deborah human, but her writer-director is working against her.First, Brooks gives her a husband (Adam Sandler) so kind, forgiving and self-effacing even his mother-in-law (the hilarious Cloris Leachman, in the film's best performance) warns Deborah she won't find another man as good as he is.Then Brooks offers up Deborah's opposite, Flor, who is not only a great mother but also -- as Deborah notices immediately -- absolutely gorgeous.Brooks puts these three characters, along with Cristina and the Clasky's vulnerable, chubby daughter, Bernice, into a series of sketches that clunk along, without narrative flow, to something of a resolution.That resolution comes, of course, with a laugh followed by a lump in the throat. After all this time, Brooks knows how to pull those strings. But this time the strings are visible, and you may want to yank back.",3,Broken 'Spanglish' strings us along a predictable path,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2909,"['fitting', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'would', 'call', 'new', 'movie', 'Spanglish', 'certainly', 'thing', 'two', 'jamming', 'two', 'distinct', 'languages', 'together', 'make', 'messy', 'vivid', 'wildly', 'popular', 'hybrid.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'someone', 'thank', 'blame', 'merging', 'television', 'movies', 'new', 'mongrel', 'language', 'Brooks', 'man', 'worked', 'first', 'television', 'creating', 'touchstone', '1970s', 'sitcoms', 'Taxi', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'spinoffs.In', ""'80s"", 'jumped', 'movies', 'much', 'bigger', 'leap', 'days', 'winning', 'multiple', 'Oscars', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'following', 'up', 'hit', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'way', 'practically', 'invented', 'dramedy', 'audience-pleasing', 'combination', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'movie', 'tear-jerker', 'even', 'will', 'tears.With', 'Spanglish', 'fifth', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Brooks', 'plenty', 'laughter', 'tears', 'not', 'produce', 'coherent', 'focused', 'story', 'sort', 'complex', 'full-blooded', 'characters', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'sitcom', 'punch', 'lines', 'heartwarming', 'lessons', 'very', 'special', 'episode', 'Flor', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Mexico', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'search', 'better', 'life', 'daughter', '12-year-old', 'Cristina', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'search', 'exotic', 'land', 'Bel', 'Air', 'where', 'job', 'housekeeper', 'rich', 'successful', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'Clasky', 'family.Why', 'unhappiness', 'Astonishingly', 'such', 'smart', 'writer', 'Brooks', 'blame', 'one', 'person', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'neurotic', 'self-involved', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'tightly', 'expect', 'head', 'start', 'spinning', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'Exorcist', 'comparison', 'not', 'line', 'Deborah', 'possessed', 'competitive', 'consumerist', 'demons', 'upper-middle-class', 'America', 'have', 'turned', 'monster', 'who', 'children', 'husband', 'betrays', 'point', 'exhaustion', 'Leoni', 'agile', 'comedian', 'best', 'make', 'Deborah', 'human', 'writer-director', 'working', 'her.First', 'Brooks', 'husband', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'so', 'kind', 'forgiving', 'self-effacing', 'even', 'mother-in-law', 'hilarious', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Deborah', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'man', 'as', 'good', 'Brooks', 'up', 'Deborah', 'opposite', 'Flor', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'mother', 'also', 'Deborah', 'immediately', 'absolutely', 'puts', 'three', 'characters', 'Cristina', 'Clasky', 'vulnerable', 'chubby', 'daughter', 'Bernice', 'series', 'sketches', 'clunk', 'along', 'narrative', 'flow', 'something', 'resolution', 'course', 'laugh', 'followed', 'lump', 'throat', 'time', 'Brooks', 'how', 'pull', 'strings', 'time', 'strings', 'are', 'visible', 'may', 'want', 'yank', 'back']",Spanglish

884705,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0007OCG56,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 4]","James Brooks' ""Spanglish"" features Adam Sandler, but this is NOT ""Happy Gilmore"".I am reading many negative reviews here and I have to say the Mrs. and I didn't think it was that bad.  James Brooks has made some witty dramedies in the past, and Spanglish isn't going to make anyone forget ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""As Good As It Gets"", but it's not bad.Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican immigrant who is in almost every scene yet speaks hardly any English.  Flor's husband has inexplicably left Flor and their young daughter, Cristina.  Cristina is portrayed as a 12 year old by the wonderful Shelbie Bruce.  She is not only an accomplished young actress, but most of her scenes are bilingual as she acts as interpreter between Flor and the Clasky family.Flor comes to America and is hired as a domestic for John and Deborah Clasky.  Sandler portrays John, who has opened a little restaurant after moving from New York and is declared by the New York Times the Greatest Chef in America.  Not much is made of his Cheffing - he could have as easily been Greatest Dog-Catcher, Salesman, etc.  Deborah is portrayed by Tea Leoni, and Deborah has issues.  I've read many reviews that suggest that her performance is a little ""out there"". Roger Ebert wrote ""Deborah doesn't just go over the top, she waves goodbye as she disappears into cuckoo-land.""In my professional dealings I unfortunately encounter Deborah's kind frequently.  Deborah was a high-powered type A executive until she was downsized, and now she's all type A and no outlet.  Her family - in fact everyone in contact with her - suffers for it.Cloris Leachman has a wonderful role as Deborah's mother, an alcoholic who was once a notable jazz singer.  She loves Deborah when pretty much no one else can, and she insightfully tells us at the end of the movie that she hasn't had a drink in weeks, and no one noticed, which must mean that she was a pretty well-functioning drunk.The Clasky's have a little girl about the same age as Flor's Cristina, and Sarah Steele's performance as Bernice is as good as Shelbie Bruce's Cristina - just without the bilingual dialogue.  Bernice is a smart, cheerful pre-teen with a little weight problem, and Deborah does and says all the things that dent Bernice's self-esteem.Deborah is high-strung and neurotic, Flor is beautiful and sweet-natured.  Is it possible John might be attracted to someone other than Deborah?I expected conflict - maybe even a little adultery - but the way Brooks' screenplay works through these issues was both realistic and satisfyingly open-ended.Reviewers who complain that the film ends with many issues unresolved must live lives that have all their issues resolved as well.Not the best Brooks.

884708,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007OCG56,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","Spanglish from Director James Brooks is a good film that tries its best to tackle social issues facing immigrants, their families, and the ""Anglo American"" culture they meet when they move into the United States (or, in this case, out of Mexico into a Los Angeles barrio and then into ""Anglo American"" culture). It is well cast; the acting is wonderful. Adam Sandler proves he can listen and be the soft, sensitive man that women yearn for; Tea Lioni shines as the tyrannical American corporate wife forced into a motherhood she can't handle from downsizing. However, after all is said and done, the film comes up a bit short of my expectations. Until the last half hour, it seems to move just too slowly. The ending scene between Flor and Cristina just doesn't feel convincing; it has a certain feel to it that seems too rushed and this that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting a better way to end the picture.The film is actually a flashback of a young girl's childhood; we learn her story as someone reads a young immigrant girl's application to Princeton. The girl (Cristina) and her mother Flor (played beautifully by Paz Vega) come into the US, live in a barrio where her mother Flor doesn't have to learn any English and then suddenly are thrust into another culture when Flor needs and gets a higher paying job working as a maid for the Clasky family.Although John Clasky (played so well by Adam Sandler) is doing very, very well in his profession, he is not exactly proactive at home. His wife Deborah (played by Tea Lioni) runs the household--tyrant style! Deborah is not maternal and bossy to say the least. Her lack of faithfulness to John makes her even less likeable. While one major theme of this movie is the trouble caused when two people from two cultures try to get along, another theme is that Flor (now the Clasky maid) and John Clasky eventually become attracted to each other. What happens from there I will leave off for fear of spoiling the plot for you! (Sorry.)Although the Clasky family can help--greatly help--Flor educate Cristina at a very elite private school,  a painful dilemma ensues for Flor: should she hold onto her core Mexican beliefs and identity? Should she accept the Clasky's offer to send her daughter Cristina to an elite private school and take the chance for a better education than Flor could probably afford? A thought-provoking scene with Flor and Cristina ensues.In short, although the movie gives us a few laughs and it delivers great acting, the plot itself is just not enough to sustain it 100% of the way.

Dillon ""Just A Reviewer""","[0, 0]","Let's start off with; this wasn't a bad movie, it simply needed some work.The story itself is a feel good kind of movie...often referred to as a `chick flick.'  There are no explosions, no guns, and no fist-fights.  Other than a nonnudity sex scene where Te'a Leoni tries to do an orgasm scene that just doesn't cut it, there isn't much to be embarrassed about when watching this with young kids.Overall I feel the director wanted his actors to be too over the top.  Te'a Leoni was waaaaaay over acting.  This is something that someone just doesn't do, but is told to do.  Cloris Leachman also had a few moments of over acting but for the most part was good and had some of the best lines in the movie to bring about a laugh.Shelbie Bruce who plays Christina did a great job.  She was very convincing and pulled out some fine scenes.  Paz Vega who plays Flor is breathtakingly beautiful and is able to act extremely well.  (I hope she does many more films)  Sarah Steele who plays Bernice is bound to be a very popular actor because she can act.The `big' name, Adam Sandler was okay.  He isn't doing his normal funny guy thing in this film.  I feel his character wasn't well written so much of the fault lies with the writer, who by the way is the director.Overall, I watched it twice and enjoyed it both times but it's definitely not one I'll buy.",3,Rent it?

The Claskys are a well to do family headed by renowned chef John (Sandler).  He is the ""good"" parent and a all around nice guy.  His wife, Deborah (Leoni) is out of work not a very pleasant person.  Her relationships with her husband and daughter are strained.

Soon, Flor and her daughter are moving into a summer home with the Claskys, and cultures begin to seriously clash.""Spanglish"" does not really have a plot so much as it examines a period of the characters' lives.  Since it is told through Christine's eyes, there is not as much resolution as many may like.  Instead, the story is strong on character, developing the three primary characters fully.Adam Sandler gives another solid dramatic performance (his first was the offbeat ""Punch Drunk Love"").  He is the nice guy, and is easy to like.  You feel for the guy as he has his ups and downs, and genuinely want him to succees.  T&eacute;a Leoni brings believability to the bitchy wife.  Self centered and oblivious to other's feelings, Deborah is a character that you do not want to like.  Cloris Leachman brings some comic relief as Deborah's mother.

Even after it has been on dvd for awhile, I hesitated renting it and the biggest reason is because it was victimized by false marketing. My guess is that the studios didn't know how to market it, and because it stars Adam Sandler, they decided to market it as a comedy, which is a huge mistake. I consider this film to be a drama with comedic elements...but if you're looking for the goofy style comedy of past Adam Sandler films, you're in for a huge disappointment.It's a shame, really, because this film doesn't fit any neat category. It must be viewed with an open mind (and an open heart wouldn't hurt either). There are some unbelievable stretches that don't work...such as the marriage between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Throughout the whole film, I wondered why they were even a couple. They had little in common and clashed about everything, particularly the role of parental responsibility. If I hadn't seen ""The Family Man"" where I actually loved Tea Leoni's performance in that film, I would not have been impressed with her here. She plays a very annoying, obsessive and eccentric mother/housewife, who acts without thinking. She's impulsive, intense, and downright irritating. Self-absorbed/self-obsessed to pay any attention to her daughter or husband. I simply couldn't figure her out and her eccentric behavior only made me empathize with Adam Sandler even more.Adam Sandler does seem out of place in a film like this. As often is the case, he plays the likeable hero whom audiences love. This film is a bit of a stretch, as he plays a father, husband, and award-winning chef. The last part really strained credibility with me. Together, as a couple, Sandler and Leoni are affluent Los Angeles suburbanites who can afford a fulltime housekeeper, played wonderfully by Paz Vega. This film belongs to Paz Vega, as the POV is from her daughter and the focus sits square on her shoulders. She is an amazing find and the reason why I rate this film so high. She has an uncanny resemblance to actress Penelope Cruz and if any Hollywood moguls are reading this review, those two should play sisters in some film one day!!!The clash of cultures begin when the housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) begins to work, as she doesn't speak English and the family doesn't speak Spanish. They get by with all manner of comedic misunderstandings, until Flor decides to learn English. What surprises me with this film is that it moves in a certain direction that makes you think where it will end up, yet turns in a surprising way that is actually profound. Ultimately, this film is about boundaries. The American family are too inconsiderate of their housekeeper as they try to ""Americanize"" her daughter in a way the mother doesn't approve, so she has to decide how best to maintain the sense of boundary and self-respect. The other surprise of this film is Cloris Leachmann, who is a wonderful actress in her own right and she gives the best advice any mother could give a daughter (she plays the alcoholic mother of Tea Leoni's character). I would have loved to see a larger role for her in this film, but she is a joy to watch in every scene she's in.The reason why I give it a perfect score of 5 stars is because of actresses Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the two girls who play the daughters; along with the surprising turns this film makes; and the overall message one receives at the end of the movie. Quite profound on the clash of cultures, the nature of families, and how best to handle temptations. It is a remarkable film that should have been better advertised to find the right audience. People expecting a typical Adam Sandler comedy will naturally be disappointed, but people expecting a drama with some humor will most likely surprised, in a good way.",5,A film that defies your expectations...muy muy fabuloso!,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3847,"['avoided', 'seeing', 'film', 'theaters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'interesting', 'Even', 'been', 'dvd', 'awhile', 'hesitated', 'renting', 'biggest', 'reason', 'was', 'victimized', 'false', 'marketing', 'guess', 'studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'market', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'decided', 'market', 'comedy', 'huge', 'mistake', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'drama', 'comedic', 'elements', ""'re"", 'looking', 'goofy', 'style', 'comedy', 'past', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', ""'re"", 'huge', 'disappointment.It', 'shame', 'really', 'film', ""n't"", 'fit', 'neat', 'category', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'open', 'mind', 'open', 'heart', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'stretches', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'such', 'marriage', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'whole', 'film', 'wondered', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'couple', 'had', 'little', 'common', 'clashed', 'everything', 'particularly', 'role', 'parental', 'responsibility', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Family', 'Man', 'where', 'actually', 'loved', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'here', 'very', 'annoying', 'obsessive', 'eccentric', 'mother/housewife', 'who', 'thinking', 'impulsive', 'intense', 'downright', 'irritating', 'Self-absorbed/self-obsessed', 'pay', 'attention', 'daughter', 'husband', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'eccentric', 'behavior', 'only', 'made', 'empathize', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'even', 'more.Adam', 'Sandler', 'seem', 'place', 'film', 'often', 'case', 'likeable', 'hero', 'whom', 'audiences', 'love', 'film', 'bit', 'stretch', 'father', 'husband', 'award-winning', 'chef', 'last', 'part', 'really', 'strained', 'credibility', 'Together', 'couple', 'Sandler', 'Leoni', 'are', 'affluent', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'suburbanites', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'fulltime', 'housekeeper', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'film', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'POV', 'daughter', 'focus', 'square', 'shoulders', 'amazing', 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'rate', 'film', 'so', 'high', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'actress', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Hollywood', 'moguls', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'two', 'should', 'play', 'sisters', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'clash', 'cultures', 'begin', 'when', 'housekeeper', 'Flor', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'work', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'family', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Spanish', 'get', 'manner', 'comedic', 'misunderstandings', 'Flor', 'learn', 'English', 'What', 'film', 'certain', 'direction', 'think', 'where', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'yet', 'surprising', 'way', 'actually', 'profound', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'boundaries', 'American', 'family', 'are', 'too', 'inconsiderate', 'housekeeper', 'try', 'Americanize', 'daughter', 'way', 'mother', ""n't"", 'approve', 'decide', 'how', 'best', 'maintain', 'sense', 'boundary', 'self-respect', 'other', 'surprise', 'film', 'Cloris', 'Leachmann', 'who', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'best', 'advice', 'mother', 'could', 'give', 'daughter', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'larger', 'role', 'film', 'joy', 'watch', 'scene', 'in.The', 'reason', 'why', 'give', 'perfect', 'score', '5', 'stars', 'actresses', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'daughters', 'surprising', 'film', 'overall', 'message', 'one', 'end', 'movie', 'Quite', 'profound', 'clash', 'cultures', 'nature', 'families', 'how', 'best', 'handle', 'temptations', 'remarkable', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'advertised', 'find', 'right', 'audience', 'People', 'expecting', 'typical', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'comedy', 'will', 'naturally', 'be', 'disappointed', 'people', 'expecting', 'drama', 'humor', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'surprised', 'good', 'way']",Spanglish

I agree with most other reviewers that this film was heavily mis-marketed. It was a romantic drama with comedic elements. This is what happens when you try to do something different in Hollywood. Where its true that Spanglish avoids a pat ending-I think this is the first time that I'm actually rooting for the hero to leave his wife. And its solely because James L. Brooks refused to give Tea any redeeming qualities. Simply put, her husband was way too good for her. Her confession of misbehaving and the subsequent tears felt like another level manipulation. She never asked or try to understand how her actions affected her husband--or how her actions affected anyone.  Yes, I understand this might very well reflect a certain level realism-but in the land of movies, characters, at some point in the storytelling, are suppose to have a character arc and change.  Take Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as it Gets (antoher James L. Brooks creation) All the characters change or grow during the course of the story.  In THIS story, everyone stays exactly the same--and in return-its an unremarkable journey.Mrs. C refused to the end to hold up a mirror to herself or bear any blame. Just when you think she's cornered-she then turns to her mother and say-this is all your fault. Even now, I'm thinking-this man chose to live the rest of days with this lunatic. He deserved better than that.Shelbie Bruce (daughter) was adorable-and I understand the sacrifice was his feelings for his family. But what type of family are we talking about when you have a looney, self-servant mom at the helm?I was rooting for Flor to show up that night, snatch her daughter back, and open a good old fashion can of whoop arse.

884723,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B0007OCG56,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 3]","Perhaps one of the great travesties of a film like this is the failure in marketing.  James L. Brooks makes serious movies that have a few laughs.  If we zoom in on his past films, we see the heavy detail given to the characters.  Spanglish is a character piece with some very obvious themes.  It's not very funny, but it's not supposed to be.  Fans of Sandler's slapstick comedy may be a bit taken by the understated performance here.  Moreover, they might be surprised by the fact that he isn't the ""star,"" as previews might suggest.  Rather, this is an ensemble piece driven by Paz Vega, who plays a Mexican immigrant who works as a housekeeper for Sandler's family in the film. Vega is brilliant, but Sandler quietly steals the show in a performance that shows his range as an actor.  He's neither comedic, as he is in comedies like ""Big Daddy"" or ""The Wedding Singer,"" or terribly manic, as he was in the quirky comic-drama ""Punch Drunk Love.""  Rather, his performance is understated, honest, and very precise, as a hard-working father trying to find peace within his family.The film's success relies heavily on how the characters play off each other, especially to Vega, whose entrance into the lives of everyone around her affect them and her.  It is about the communication or lack thereof between the characters.  Brooks brilliantly illustrates that language, in the literal sense, does not neccessarily equate with successful communication.  It's also not the only way to communicate effectively.  Brooks drives the point home in a very moving scene between Sandler and Vega and in the ending that may dissapoint some viewers.  It should at least illicit some discussion.The film's only failure is only in what people may make it out to be.  It is, in contrast to what many viewers may see, not about the experience of Mexican in a foreign society.  While there are scenes that illustrate the displacement of cultures, the film is more interested in the idea that culture is important in terms of honesty and showing who you truly are.  Some have criticized this film as white washing the Mexican American experience, and while the film is not an ideal illustration, that's not what it intends to be.  These aspects merely serve as a springboard for a film that has much  bigger ideas that speak to a much broader audience, whatever langauge they speak.",4,Understated gem,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2363,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'great', 'travesties', 'film', 'failure', 'marketing', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'serious', 'movies', 'have', 'few', 'laughs', 'zoom', 'past', 'films', 'see', 'heavy', 'detail', 'given', 'characters', 'Spanglish', 'character', 'piece', 'very', 'obvious', 'themes', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Fans', 'Sandler', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'taken', 'understated', 'performance', 'here', 'Moreover', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'fact', ""n't"", 'star', 'previews', 'might', 'suggest', 'Rather', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'driven', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'who', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'who', 'housekeeper', 'Sandler', 'family', 'film', 'Vega', 'brilliant', 'Sandler', 'quietly', 'show', 'performance', 'range', 'actor', 'comedic', 'comedies', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'terribly', 'manic', 'was', 'quirky', 'comic-drama', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'Rather', 'performance', 'understated', 'honest', 'very', 'precise', 'hard-working', 'father', 'trying', 'find', 'peace', 'family.The', 'film', 'success', 'heavily', 'how', 'characters', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'especially', 'Vega', 'entrance', 'lives', 'everyone', 'affect', 'communication', 'lack', 'thereof', 'characters', 'Brooks', 'brilliantly', 'language', 'literal', 'sense', 'not', 'neccessarily', 'equate', 'successful', 'communication', 'also', 'not', 'only', 'way', 'communicate', 'effectively', 'Brooks', 'point', 'home', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'Sandler', 'Vega', 'ending', 'may', 'dissapoint', 'viewers', 'should', 'least', 'illicit', 'discussion.The', 'film', 'only', 'failure', 'only', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'contrast', 'what', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'see', 'not', 'experience', 'Mexican', 'foreign', 'society', 'are', 'scenes', 'illustrate', 'displacement', 'cultures', 'film', 'more', 'interested', 'idea', 'culture', 'important', 'terms', 'honesty', 'showing', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'white', 'washing', 'Mexican', 'American', 'experience', 'film', 'not', 'ideal', 'illustration', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'aspects', 'merely', 'serve', 'springboard', 'film', 'much', 'bigger', 'ideas', 'speak', 'much', 'broader', 'audience', 'langauge', 'speak']",Spanglish

I think this movie deserves a lot of praise for creating a cohesive dynamic between the characters and for making the characters themselves thoroughly human and undeniably unique.What I enjoyed most about this film as well as Brooks' previous movie As Good as it Gets, is that I find myself liking his characters both for their virtues and their flaws.  It makes me feel better about people in general, and that is an unusual feeling for me to get from a movie.  Brooks tackles vice in a way that enriches the warmth and intimacy of a story, and in so doing yields a kind of optimism about humanity and all its attendant drama.

Cultures clash between two different worlds, but not without the effort to bring an understanding of where each have come and where they want to be.  In this case, hollywood meets the third world.  This is a story of  single Latin American woman who ventures to the United States with her daughter to seek the opportunity to live a better life.  The daughter narrates the story as part of an essay she writes for college entry to a prestigious university.  She owes her determination and influence to her mother.  Life finally begins in the US when her mother happens to find a job working as a housekeeper with an upscale American family where she and her daughter quickly become part of the family.  In the process, she almost loses her daughter to the family.SPANGLISH contains an array of serious issues from alcoholism to infidelity over a laugh track of irony that each character encounter.  Adam Sandler, the chef-father, appears to take the serious guy persona as opposed to his previous comedic roles. Cloris Leachman basically steals the show as the mother-in-law who adds a little tongue and cheek one liners through out the film.  However, her daughter as played by Tea Leoni appears to be the downer of the film with her overbearing presence.One question comes to mind, why did Brooks choose upscale California for this semi-comedic film about a Latin American woman and her daughter making it in the United States?

In fact the whole cast is, especially Sandler's often despicably neurotic wife hwo shows the unabashed affection for the Spanish girl she refuses to lay on her daughter.

884733,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007OCG56,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 4]","I must admit that it took a little while for ""Spanglish"" to completely win me over - but win me over it did thanks to its sharply observed social commentary and winning performances by a first-rate cast.  At first, the film threatens to be swept away by a tidal wave of stereotypical characters and cliches, but it doesn't take long for the subtleties and complexities to kick in and to lift the movie to a higher level.This is James L. Brooks' witty take on the cultural divide that separates the ""master class"" from the ""servant class"" in multi-ethnic Los Angeles.  The Hispanic side of the equation is represented by Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a gorgeous single mother living in Mexico who heads to America to start a new life for herself and her daughter.  Eventually, despite the fact that she cannot speak English, Flor finds a job as a fulltime housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family named the Claskys.  The wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a deeply neurotic limousine liberal who drives her family crazy with her obsessive compulsiveness and lack of a clear mental focus.  Her husband, John, is a mild-mannered master chef who has become completely exasperated by the intensely mercurial nature of his wife's behavior and moods, and who yearns for nothing more than a little peace and harmony on the home front.  The Claskys also have a sweet-tempered but homely daughter, Bernice, who bonds with Flor's beautiful daughter, Christina, who narrates the tale.What distinguishes ""Spanglish"" from so many other American comedies is its staunch refusal to adhere to a cookie-cutter formula.  Brooks has written a screenplay that allows the characters room to breathe and to interact with one another in complex and surprising ways.  He doesn't even feel the need to tie up all the loose ends in the closing minutes.  He is perfectly willing to let the characters continue to live their lives even after the closing credits have scrolled by.  What he captures best is the subtle tug-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter.  Brooks understands the sore spots inherent in parent/child interactions as well as relationships in general.  Naturally, a romantic attraction eventually develops between John and Flor, but one that is handled with charm, delicacy and tact.Sandler and Vega give warmth, touching performances, and Shelbie Bruce, Sarah Steele and Cloris Leachman offer superb support.  Leoni starts off so over-the-top that one fears she will throw the entire movie off-kilter.  But damned if she doesn't grow on you, as she turns what could have been a psychological gargoyle into a sympathetic woman filled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.Happily, the humor in the film arises naturally from the characters and situations and almost never feels desperate or forced.  And, indeed, there are some very hearty laughs generously laced throughout the movie.""Spanglish' doesn't try to ""solve"" the ethnic and race relations problems that still plague America's largest cities.  However, in its own quiet, humor-filled way, it reminds us that the caste system is still very much a reality in a country that prides itself on its supposed lack of class-consciousness.",4,not just another cookie-cutter comedy,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3449,"['must', 'admit', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'Spanglish', 'completely', 'win', 'win', 'did', 'thanks', 'sharply', 'observed', 'social', 'commentary', 'winning', 'performances', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'tidal', 'wave', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'cliches', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'subtleties', 'complexities', 'kick', 'lift', 'movie', 'higher', 'level.This', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'witty', 'take', 'cultural', 'divide', 'master', 'class', 'servant', 'class', 'multi-ethnic', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Hispanic', 'side', 'equation', 'represented', 'Flor', 'Moreno', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'gorgeous', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'Mexico', 'who', 'America', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'daughter', 'Eventually', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'Flor', 'job', 'fulltime', 'housekeeper', 'nanny', 'wealthy', 'white', 'family', 'named', 'Claskys', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'deeply', 'neurotic', 'limousine', 'liberal', 'who', 'family', 'crazy', 'obsessive', 'compulsiveness', 'lack', 'clear', 'mental', 'focus', 'husband', 'John', 'mild-mannered', 'master', 'chef', 'who', 'become', 'completely', 'exasperated', 'intensely', 'mercurial', 'nature', 'wife', 'behavior', 'moods', 'who', 'yearns', 'nothing', 'more', 'little', 'peace', 'harmony', 'home', 'front', 'Claskys', 'also', 'have', 'sweet-tempered', 'homely', 'daughter', 'Bernice', 'who', 'bonds', 'Flor', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'who', 'tale.What', 'Spanglish', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'American', 'comedies', 'staunch', 'refusal', 'adhere', 'cookie-cutter', 'formula', 'Brooks', 'written', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'room', 'breathe', 'interact', 'one', 'complex', 'surprising', 'ways', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'need', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'closing', 'minutes', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'let', 'characters', 'continue', 'live', 'lives', 'even', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'scrolled', 'What', 'best', 'subtle', 'tug-of-war', 'two', 'mothers', 'respective', 'daughters', 'particularly', 'Deborah', 'intense', 'devotion', 'Christina', 'partly', 'result', 'genuine', 'desire', 'help', 'get', 'ahead', 'life', 'partly', 'unconscious', 'preference', 'beautiful', 'child', 'own', 'overweight', 'daughter', 'Brooks', 'sore', 'spots', 'inherent', 'parent/child', 'interactions', 'as', 'well', 'relationships', 'general', 'Naturally', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'eventually', 'John', 'Flor', 'one', 'handled', 'charm', 'delicacy', 'tact.Sandler', 'Vega', 'give', 'warmth', 'touching', 'performances', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'offer', 'superb', 'support', 'Leoni', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'one', 'will', 'throw', 'entire', 'movie', 'off-kilter', 'damned', ""n't"", 'grow', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'psychological', 'gargoyle', 'sympathetic', 'woman', 'filled', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'self-doubt.Happily', 'humor', 'film', 'naturally', 'characters', 'situations', 'almost', 'never', 'feels', 'desperate', 'forced', 'indeed', 'are', 'very', 'hearty', 'laughs', 'generously', 'laced', 'movie', 'Spanglish', ""n't"", 'try', 'solve', 'ethnic', 'race', 'relations', 'problems', 'still', 'plague', 'America', 'largest', 'cities', 'However', 'own', 'quiet', 'humor-filled', 'way', 'caste', 'system', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'reality', 'country', 'supposed', 'lack', 'class-consciousness']",Spanglish

Going into the new millennium, Sandler seem to not be able to decide whether to stick with his sophomoric shtick as with Little Nicky or move into a more sophisticated style as he did in Punch Drunk Love. And of course there is always romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. His latest trek into the sophisticated realm was Spanglish.The backdrop of the film is an essay a student has written for her application to Yale. It explains why her mother is the person she most admires and goes on to explain how her mom took her from Mexico and made her the person she was today. The problem with this is that the movie then doesn't revolve around the young girl yet focuses on the family he mother began to work for upon arriving in America. In fact the girl gets very little screen time in the movie. The family includes Sandler as the dad with an inferiority complex at being the best chef in the country, his wife, played by T&eacute;a Leoni, a victim of downsizing who can quite adapt to being a stay at home mom. They have two children, a son who barely makes blip on screen and an overweight daughter played by an actress who tries to pull off the ""wise beyond her age"" act but isn't able to do so. Alcoholic grandma also lives with them played perfectly by Cloris Leachman who delivers the best line in the movie, ""Honey, lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense."" That line has entered into my repertoire of insults and can't wait until I find the perfect time to unleash it.The movie finally hit its stride when the family movies to a beach house for the summer when Sandler's family is introduced to the Mexican girl who is forced to move in with them due to distance reasons. Leoni finds in her the daughter she always wanted which causes problem with basically everyone else in the film.The film is well written finding a balance in-between drama and comedy and also features what was one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have seen in a while. If that ever happen to me, I may have to give up sex for a while. As for the negatives, the movie seems to forget that is it based on an essay and there are many things that I doubt the girl ever knew yet she is able to write about it. Also all the driving scenes it is very obvious that green screens were used and they looked as bad as a SNL skit. A big budget movie should avoid such pitfalls. On the DVD, don't forget to check out the deleted scenes to see one of the funniest scenes with Leoni's character preparing for a party.

Much overlooked in the most thoughtful and sweet person in the movie in Tea Leoni's character, despite her enlarged-for-TV foibles (and no girlfriends to air them with.  Very curious Hollywood oversight: a rich American woman living in Malibu with no friends...even false ones??). Yet she strives to be good in her own ways.  a. She hires a maid with no experience who doesn't even speak English, and then pays her handsomely (lest we forget her beauty was obvious and would have tempted the husband).  b. she takes the maid's daughter out for a girl's day and treats her to the chagrin of the maid  c. She helps the maid's daughter get a scholarship and tries to assimilate her into their family circle.2.  Adam Sandler's character never empathised with his wife's neurotic condition and just brushed her off, unless sex was involved.  Then during the act, he quips a turn off comment: ""You don't even need me (to orgasm) do you?"" hurting her feelings.  Of course he has lustful eyes for the help since their 1st meeting.  Bum.3.  Worst of all, Paz Vega (Flor).  What an ungrateful, slutty, needy character!  She coyly makes Tea Leoni out to be the bad seed and is a lousy housekeeper (anybody notice the patio was always a mess while she was busy learning her English tapes?)  She sexually teases Adam Sandler, always lingering a little too long for comfort with her pretentiously shy behaviour (yeah why'd she pull him away to a quiet part of the beach at night to talk?)  To top it off she didn't want her daughter to succeed, but rather to live out a slum existence with her so she wouldn't die of lonliness.  She makes her give up her scholarship for no good reason, not wanting better for her kid.  Saddest part of all was the daughter giving up so soon.

884739,A2S0FCE1GYVKBT,B0007OCG56,"Steve ""metsfansince1962""","[10, 15]","Written and directed by James Brooks, this film (which I saw as a ""sneak preview"") is touching and generally well written, with good acting.  There are funny scenes in the film,  but I felt the dramatic moments were at least as important. The film is a poignant portrayal of several people, and the relationships they have with each other.  Paz Vega is wonderful as a young, single mother, who migrates illegally from Mexico, and settles in Los Angeles.  Her daughter is attracted by ""the better life"" of Anglo America, which leads to some conflicts with her mother.  Vega is employed by the Claskys as a housekeeper, although she doesn't know any English (after six years in the US), and she gradually forms bonds with some of the family members, and conflicts with the neurotic, intrusive wife (played by T&eacute;a Leoni).  Adam Sandler is excellent as Leoni's husband--a world-class chef, who loves his family, but is unhappy with his marriage.  I was impressed by his performance, which was real and sensitive.  Cloris Leachman also does fairly well in a supporting role as Leoni's mother, as do two child actresses, Shelbie Bruce and Sarah Steele.  One role that should have been eliminated from the script is that of Sandler's son (whom we never get to know).

The family is on the eve of destruction when all the skeletons come falling out of the closet. Sandler does well here & does not resort to his childish behavior that we know & love. This actually was well written & has realistic issues that confront many families.

884741,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B0007OCG56,TawnTawn,"[8, 13]","This whole film is supposedly the writing of Christina, the daughter of Flor, the Mexican maid of a rich LA couple.  She is submitting her college entrance essay to Princeton, and for some reason writes only of her experience brought to her by her mother's working for this family.Debra (unemployed designer), John (chef, and we learn later, restaurant owner), their two kids (the boy might as well have not been in the movie), and Debra's alcoholic mother (former famous jazz singer) all live together and need a housekeeper/cook/driver six days a week.  In moves Flor, who has moved from Mexico to California (in with a cousin) to give her daughter a better life.  For awhile she works two jobs, netting $450.00 a week, then gets the gig at the Klasky's making $650.00 per week. She speaks very, very little English.Nice idea for a movie, but the reality is rather rough on the viewing public.  Tea Leoni's character has nothing likable to recommend her - she is loud, hyper, self-centered, and stringy-haired, not to mention, insensitive to her daughter's feelings.  She tries to take over Flor's daughter, and pretty much succeeds, much to Flor's frustration.  Adam Sandler is the very nice, kind, and ineffectual father and husband.  The problem is many scenes go on much too long and go absolutely nowhere.In the end, Flor asks her daughter if she wants to become a person different from her, her mother.  Christina doesn't answer her, but tells Princeton that if they reject her, it won't matter, as she ""is her mother's daughter"".Pretty silly, as each person is their own individual, or should be, and should be encouraged by their parents to be themselves.Not a typical Adam Sandler comedy.

884743,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0007OCG56,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 22]","Brain circuits, reconnecting. Reality, resurfacing. Noises in head, stopping. Aaaaahhhhhhh!. Back to normal. Hopefully, the nightmares will stop.Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni, Mrs. David Duchovny. Let's face it, she isn't known for her work in movies.), is the...Uh, oh. Didn't get far. Brain circuits breaking free, disconnecting from the matter, won't let me remember Tea Leoni's God awful performance in ""Spanglish"", the newest film from writer - director James L. Brooks (""Broadcast News"", ""Terms of Endearment""). Move on to another topic before brain shuts down and the drool starts.Remember when James L. Brooks used to make really good films for adults? I know, its getting a little difficult, but make good films he did. ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"" earned a bucket load of award nominations and awards for the various stars involved. Why? Because they were good films, with somewhat believable characters who did funny things or lived through very dramatic events. In the last decade, he has made three films. One of these was ""As Good As It Gets"" and sort of made people forget the debacle of ""I'll Do Anything"", his ""musical without music"" starring Nick Nolte. Then he made ""Spanglish""....matriarch of an affluent family living in Brentwood. Recently downsized, she finds she has a lot of time on her hands and naturally decides to hire a housekeeper.Why won't the voices stop? What? Leoni's shrill voice is still rattling around in my head? What? Stop it, Tea. Leave my brain immediately. I need to finish the review in order to purge the demons...From the moment we meet Deborah, we realize that something is wrong with this woman; she talks a mile a minute, she never shuts up for anyone, she appears to be taking some sort of medication, perhaps Speed, but no mention is ever made of this. So what is the excuse for her to act like this? Even if she were taking medication, it would take a lot of explanation to make her behavior acceptable. Her daughter, Bernie (Sarah Steele), a slightly pudgy young girl with braces, makes a sandwich which everyone loves. Deborah takes a bite and practically swoons and then says ""But you really don't need that"", referring to her daughter's slightly pudgy state. Later, having returned from a warehouse sale, Deborah presents her daughter with bags full of new clothes. Excitedly, Bernie starts to try them on and realizes they are too small, all a size 8. ""Don't worry, honey. You'll fit into them real soon."" Groan. The woman is a monster and shouldn't be allowed to raise these kids. Their son only appears in two or three scenes. Apparently, there was no dramatic material there.John Clasky (Adam Sandler) wakes up the next morning to find Flor (Paz Vega) cleaning the house. He didn't realize that Deborah -- the voices are ringing again -- had hired someone. John owns a small restaurant (modeled after the French Laundry, Thomas Keller's restaurant) which is receiving a lot of good praise. John learns that Flor speaks no English, but she does understand quite a bit. Flor is amazed to see how Deborah treats Bernie and takes all of the clothes, letting out hems and fixing them, to make them fit. This makes Flor Bernie's new best friend. Evelyn (Cloris Leachman), Deborah's mom, a former Jazz singer who lives with the family is intent on drinking as much wine during any given day as possible and providing sage advice to her daughter as she see fit. As the summer approaches, Deborah decides to rent a summer house in Malibu...Does not compute. Why would someone in Brentwood rent a summer home in Malibu? It doesn't make any sense. The weather is so much colder in Brentwood during the summer? If you are unfamiliar with the two, they are about ten to fifteen miles apart. Unfortunately, I am aware that people actually do this. Worse yet, as soon as they move, it becomes apparent that John will continue to commute to his restaurant. Business is booming because he just received four stars from the Times. The place is booked solid for four months. And Deborah, with her shrill, puffy face, crying all the time, screaming, or worse yet, talking a mile a minute, will continue to drive around, looking for something to occupy her time.Deborah insists Flor move into the summer house with them. Flor's daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), has to move in as well. Deborah immediately latches onto the young girl and treats her like a life size Barbie doll, making her the new `project'. She takes her to have her hair highlighted, to see a private school, etc., all without Flor's knowledge. Naturally, the first thing any of us would do is allow someone like Deborah to repeatedly influence our child, after watching the success she has had in her relationship with her own daughter, Bernie.Brain at critical stage. Meltdown imminent. Must purge it of all thoughts of  Leoni's performance. Must finish review. Quickly.It amazes me that anyone, anywhere thought Tea Leoni's performance was good, acceptable and film worthy; a combination of hysterics, crying, over-the-top acting and so much more. Maybe there are real people who act like this, but that doesn't mean that we have to pay to watch them for two hours. Always crying, talking hysterically, bossing people around, etc., etc. Considering how many people work on any given film it amazes me that someone, anyone didn't say ""Ah...Mr. Brooks?"". Brooks, Leoni, Sandler, the producers, the studio executives, David Duchovny, they all apparently thought that this performance was real and believable. It is easily one of the worst performances I have ever seen on film, or television, for that matter. In one scene, Deborah learns about the four star review of her husband's restaurant. This apparently excites her and she attacks him, pushing him into their bedroom, straddling him on the bed. John (Sandler) seems to enjoy the fact that she is taking control. ""You don't even need me, do you?"" he laughs. She rides him to her finish and then immediately begins crying and her face becomes puffy and sad. Oh my God. Every time she appeared on screen, I felt like poking my eardrums out, to save the torture.Brain levels lowering, don't really have to think about Leoni much anymore. Feeling better.The rest of ""Spanglish"" is acceptable. Billed as a ""Comedy with a language all its own"". It isn't very funny. Once of twice, I smiled, but I never laughed. Basically, everything they do is dramatic.It is also difficult to get past the contrived set-up for telling the story. An Admissions Officer at Princeton reads the admissions essay from Cristina, presumably 6 or 7 years later. In her essay, Cristina relates the events of her mother working for the Clasky family. How does Cristina know what the first meeting between her mother and Deborah was like? She wasn't there. How does she know how Deborah reacted to John's four star review? Clearly, she wasn't in their bedroom. It is difficult to imagine that someone would relate these stories, and others, to her. This is a sloppy, poorly executed method for telling the story.The production values in any Brooks' film will be of the highest standards. ""Spanglish"" doesn't disappoint there. Everything is crisp, clear, pretty. There is one exception. There are a couple of scenes with characters in cars, having a conversation as someone is driving. A couple of decades ago, these scenes would be shot in a studio, using a fake car, with the scenery projected behind the actors. In the last few decades, they have advanced this process, usually shooting in a real car, on the road. In ""Spanglish"", they have regressed. It is so obvious that a significant portion of these scenes were shot in a studio making me question why? Think of the Roger Moore James Bond films. Whenever he had to jump out of a plane, the close-ups would always have his hair moving in an unnatural way. This is because he was shot in front of a blue screen and the scenery was added later. They weren't able to make his hair flow freely. Apparently, they weren't able to make Leoni's hair flow freely either.Oh, oh. Mentioned Leoni. Brain levels back at medium, rising, rising. Must purge of all of her memories.After Flor's daughter moves in, Deborah begins to manipulate her and Flor, because she thinks Flor's daughter is beautiful. You see, she doesn't think her own daughter is beautiful. Now she has the daughter she always wanted. Flor's daughter is accepted at Bernie's school, Deborah gives her an expensive necklace on her first day, buys her books for her, insists that she invite her friends over to their house for a sleepover. Who thought this was an interesting, believable, watchable story? Someone was very misguided. I'm looking at you, Mr. Brooks.Every so often an actor or actress will give the performance of their career, overshadowing all others. The film becomes ""Their Film"". They earn all of the notice. Tea Leoni has done that in ""Spanglish"". It doesn't matter that Paz Vega gives a very good, believable performance as Flor, it doesn't matter that Adam Sandler does some good, if unspectacular work, it doesn't matter that Cloris Leachman is even in the film. The film is all about Leoni. And not in a good way. Her performance is so bad, she creates a black hole sucking all of the other actors in.Hopefully, they will get out in time and move on to other projects. Hopefully, Tea will take some acting classes and learn the art of subtlety. Hopefully, I will make a million dollars tomorrow. We can all dream.Aaaahhh, brain levels back to normal.

WOW!  Not only did she say no because it was a bad example for her child--she called the temptation to give in to lust (aka romance, love) a mistake!  Bravo.  Yes, the chef's wife had cheated on him.  Yes, the maid is single and innocent and did not try to seduce him.  Yet, it would still be wrong to embrace the affections of a married man--and the maid (Flor) won't go there.The other climatic scene has Flor rejecting a scholarship for her daughter to attend an exclusive college prep academy because she believes it will rob her daughter's soul and identity.  The star struck daughter is devestated and publicly scorns her mother.  Full of patience, mother lets her stew for awhile, then gently queries, ""Do you really desire to be so different from me?""  Daughter ponders, and finally hugs her mother, realizing that to have a champion parent that is so strong and devoted is a far greater advantage than the ""right school amongst the right people.""Bottom-line:  This film offers interesting cross-cultural insight and humor, fun and adorable acting that is indeed chick-flickish, and very sound morality.

Still, as others have indicated, the man is far too saintly to be realistic.  Any other guy would have blown his top at his wife's hysterics.Two of the biggest criticisms of ""Spanglish,"" besides Sandler's character being too nice, is that Brooks, the director, is sexist for depicting an accomplished white woman, played by Leoni, as completely hysterical and racist because of how he handles the issue of Hispanic culture and American ideals.I've known a few ultra-rich liberal white families.  ""Deborah,"" Leoni's character is, unfortunately, not that unrealistic.  I have personally witnessed a liberal white woman mistreat a Hispanic employee.  And I've known more than one woman who could compete with Deborah's selfishness.  I have also seen the mellow rich white guy who's clueless to his wife's rude behavior towards the Hispanic help.  The only mistake Brooks made, in my experience, was in making Leoni's character too much of a caricature.The issue of racism is a bit more complicated.  It should be obvious why Flor would want to keep her cultural identity and why should would want to pass this on to her daughter.  But would she deny her the chance of a lifetime to receive a top education?  It's a hard path to follow.  It seems like Brooks had the right intention (honoring cultural independence), he just couldn't figure out a way to show it in a way that was appropriate.*spoiler alert*Unlike viewers who applaud the ""family values"" ending, I can't say I enjoyed the last five minutes.  Staying married for the sake of being married is just stupid.  It's so obvious that Flor and John belong together and that Deborah should be dumped in a heartbeat.  Deborah is, quite bluntly, not just a lousy wife but also a horrible parent.  All of the kids would be better off with Flor and John together.I applaud Brooks for his bravery in depicting (finally!) a father figure who is loving, supportive and, most importantly, non-traditional (egalitarian).  Funny how some liberal critics missed that point.

884748,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007OCG56,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 3]","Perhaps it's Adam Sandler that you want to see in `Spanglish,' James L Brooke's culture-clash drama. Yes, Sandler is surprisingly good with understated acting. He is good enough to make us forget his terrible near career-killing turn in `Little Nicky,' but let me remind you that this film is one of his recent attempts to undo his traditionally accepted image as comedian doing mainly madcap persona. This is not `The Wedding Singer' and it is meant that way.Young Mexican girl Christina (Shelbie Bruce) recounts how she and her beautiful mother Flor (Paz Vega) arrive at the Clasky Family and their gorgeous house in LA (it's `economy class,' she says), where Flor starts to work as a house keeper for a nervous and obsessive mom Deborah (Tea Leoni). Flor cannot speak English, but the fact is not a big problem among this dysfunctional family - see incredibly patient daddy John (Adam Sandler) first-rate chef so devoted to the family that he cannot say what he should to his nagging wife.Flor is after all a capable housekeeper, and of very affectionate disposition for that matter, so John is gradually attracted to her while to her dismay her daughter Christie is drawn to the rich life of the Clansky Family. Though the film gives some interesting supports, especially from deliciously off-beat comic performance as a retired jazz singer from Cloris Leechan, the budding romance between Sandler and Vega lacks chemistry, and is concluded with unconvincing ending.I know this is a matter of taste, but I found Tea Leoni's acting as the frivolous, self-obsessed mom interesting at first, but her constant one-note yelling and mugging gradually became annoying and irritating as the story went on. The character played by Leoni, who is better in recent `Fun with Dick and Jane,' gets alarmingly close to being monstrous.But if something or somebody should be praised for her freshness, naturalness, and most of all, radiating charms, Paz Vega should be the real star of `Spanglsih,' which, though well-intentioned and sporadically funny, is curiously devoid of the originality, or the quirky charms of the characters Brooks has been good at creating. The film is largely well-acted, and also amusing enough thanks to some of the one-liners, but everything about the characters looks oversimplified.

It's during the second or third time through, do you, the viewer, begin to see how painful it is to be Deb Clasky.  She seems to have it all, yet she has nothing.  Her wildness and seemingly ego-centric actions only point out how desparate she is to get out of her situation.  She sees no value in being a wife and mother.  John Clasky, played brilliantly by Adam Sandler, is a man lost in his own story of success and failure.  Flor and Cristina only walk into this mess of a family, by accident.  It is Flor's balance and strong sense of self that begins to have an effect on the loose cannons residing in the Clasky household, save Deb.  Bernie, the daughter, finds a true heart in Flor - like her own.  The grandmother finds an interest in helping out her grandkids, which in turn, helps her to stop boozing.  John finds the very thing that's been missing in his relationship with Deb.  He finds a woman who knows and loves a sensitive soul when she sees one.  Flor truly is John's soul to soul connection.  Deb, well, she needs to go be important again.  If I had to write a sequel, then John and Flor would be together with grandma and kids living as a warm, happy, and intelligent family.

They know, and we know, that they haven't seen every movie ever made. The reviewers of the movies I check out on Amazon have certainly avoided the 20% or 30% of the movies at the very bottom of the barrel. All of this is by way of explaining why I will try to avoid such exaggerations.  I can only say, without exaggeration, that ""Spanglish"" is one of the movies I've enjoyed least of any I've ever seen.  The idea is halfway between interesting and cringe-making  -  actually a little closer to cringe-making.  The script is extremely weak - in the way that a beginning improv class would be.  It has a few moments, provided by either Cloris Leachman or Shelby Bruce, who plays Paz Vega's daughter. (I'm not sure if Paz Vega is the B-list Salma Hayek or Salma Hayek is the B-list Paz Vega.) Anyway, the real problem lies elsewhere. As a big fan of Tea Leoni I have to assume that she played the neurotic and abrasive wife just as she was supposed to play her. Big mistake.  And as someone who hasn't seen Adam Sandler in any other movies, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he probably couldn't be any worse in anything else. On the other hand, there's no evidence here that he could ever be any better in anything either.

It doesn't pretend to be more than it is; a rather gentle poke at the mores and values of a very liberal, trying-hard-to-be-humanitarian Southern California family.Other reviewers have described the plot: Spoiled brat wife Deborah (in a much-too-over-the-top hysterical performance by Tia Leoni) hires Latina housekeeper (the stunningly beautiful and intensely endearing Paz Vega), and tries to show her that she considers her equal to the family. There is much humor and some pathos, but the enjoyment is in the supporting actors. Vega is absolutely marvelous as the proud housekeeper who sees through her employers much more than they know; Sarah Steele, an endearingly awkward teenager, is fabulous as the daughter whose mother lets her know how fat she is. The acting falls down with Adam Sandler, the perfect husband and father who isn't believable for a single minute but who isn't obnoxious about it, and Leoni, who WAY overdoes the neurotic Deborah to the point of fingernails on the blackboard.So why did I like this movie? It is just basically a sweet story, no harm done, nothing horrible, and very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something deeply intellectual.

Apparently it's when it involves breaking our immigration laws. Sad to see how ""freely"" this movie depicts the act. It really shows how we've somehow slipped into this euphoric state where we longer care about our borders. Really glad the Minute Men have the guts to do what our goverenment DOESN'T.

This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, and he's doing good taste humours here like he did in Punch Drunk Love. The cast is superb in this film, especially Paz Vega(Sex and Lucia) who managed to deliver a wonderful, funny, and dramatic performance as a overly protective single mother(Flor Moreno) working as a housekeeper for the Clasky family.Tea Leoni is very impressive as the comic relief most of the time. She plays Deborah Clasky, a fulltime mom and she's obsessed with exercise and when she became discontended with her husband John(Sandler), she started to cheat on him. She's quite a neurotic case, and only her mother(Evelyn) can fully understand her and gives her good advice. Evelyn is a witty ex-jazz singer and an alcoholic, and she was wild and promiscuous in her younger days. John is a workaholic/renowned chef and restraurant owner. He is trying his best to be a good dad and husband. His daughter is overweight and very self-consious about it, and she befriends with Flor's daughter Cristina(played perfectly by the bilingual Shelbie Bruce) who served as a translator for her mother most of the time. The several months of working for the Clarsky, Flor's life and her relationship with her daughter had reached a volatile state. She feared changes and she resented her daughter for becoming so Americanized.This film is funnier in the first hour, and then it headed a melodramatic direction that intended to build up a touching and meaningful ending. Some of the deleted scenes will provide some clarity on certain ""unfinished"" scenes. The special feature also included some brief interviews on the leads. I was surprised that Paz Vega didn't speak any English before starring in this movie. Her character actually learned to speak English later in the film, but it's exaggeratted that she could learn so much over the course of one summer.",4,Funny and Touching Culture/Language Clash Dramedy.,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2100,"['Spanglish', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'learned', 'speak', 'second', 'language', 'have', 'moved', 'one', 'country', 'most', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'generated', 'culture', 'clash', 'language', 'barriers', 'not', 'typical', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'doing', 'good', 'taste', 'humours', 'here', 'did', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'cast', 'superb', 'film', 'especially', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Sex', 'Lucia', 'who', 'managed', 'deliver', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'overly', 'protective', 'single', 'mother', 'Flor', 'Moreno', 'working', 'housekeeper', 'Clasky', 'family.Tea', 'Leoni', 'very', 'impressive', 'comic', 'relief', 'most', 'time', 'Deborah', 'Clasky', 'fulltime', 'mom', 'obsessed', 'exercise', 'when', 'became', 'discontended', 'husband', 'John', 'Sandler', 'started', 'cheat', 'quite', 'neurotic', 'case', 'only', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'good', 'advice', 'Evelyn', 'witty', 'ex-jazz', 'singer', 'alcoholic', 'was', 'wild', 'promiscuous', 'younger', 'days', 'John', 'workaholic/renowned', 'chef', 'restraurant', 'owner', 'trying', 'best', 'be', 'good', 'dad', 'husband', 'daughter', 'overweight', 'very', 'self-consious', 'Flor', 'daughter', 'Cristina', 'played', 'perfectly', 'bilingual', 'Shelbie', 'Bruce', 'who', 'served', 'translator', 'mother', 'most', 'time', 'several', 'months', 'working', 'Clarsky', 'Flor', 'life', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'had', 'reached', 'volatile', 'state', 'feared', 'changes', 'resented', 'daughter', 'becoming', 'so', 'Americanized.This', 'film', 'funnier', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'headed', 'melodramatic', 'direction', 'intended', 'build', 'up', 'touching', 'meaningful', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'will', 'provide', 'clarity', 'certain', 'unfinished', 'scenes', 'special', 'feature', 'also', 'included', 'brief', 'interviews', 'leads', 'was', 'surprised', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'starring', 'movie', 'character', 'actually', 'learned', 'speak', 'English', 'later', 'film', 'exaggeratted', 'could', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'course', 'one', 'summer']",Spanglish
