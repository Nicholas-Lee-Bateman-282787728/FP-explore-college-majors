1056481,A2C050SD63NQCI,B000NDI5BU,Bruce Myers,"[0, 0]","The great Philip Gardiner strikes again!  Not familiar with him?  Here's your chance.  NICK POPE is, in my opinion, Gardiner's masterpiece.  As always, he backs up his claims and theories with hard science and stunning evidence.  But this DVD goes a step further, being the first time the real Nick Pope has come clean in regards to UFO phenomena.  What he has to say is guaranteed to astound even the most jaded of skeptics.

If you believe in and/or have an interest in UFOs, this interview with Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense will definitely be of interest. The MOD's project began in the 1950s during the anxiety over the war, and continued to track aircraft and fireballs by radar.

1056485,A35P4VFRKKQUB3,B000NDI5BU,Margaret Bartley,"[3, 4]","I did not give this five stars because there wasn't much new information.  The only new thing I remember is that I didn't know air traffic radar is computer-programmed to hide aircraft traveling at high rates of speed.  I found that interesting, but not worth five stars.If you haven't attended any UFO conferences, or read too many UFO books, but do have an interest in this subject, you will definitely find this interesting.  He focuses on what I would call ""high-value"" sightings - sightings by trained observers - meterologists, airline captains, police officers, etc, who have made official reports, and then he talks about the follow-up research, or lack thereof.  It's a good introduction for someone who has a real interest in getting some reputable information.I thought much, but not all, of the music was appropriate, and added to the strength of the movie, but I found some of it to be too jarring and spikey.The basic format, two people sitting in a room staring at each other, is intrinsically a difficult format to keep an audience involved, but Nick Pope has a compelling voice of authenticity.One thing I noticed in the interview is when Pope was asked if he were a disinformation agent - he definitely had a reaction to that question. I also noticed that the film went from black-and-white to color at this point.  I wonder if there was a subliminal message in that.One other point I have to make is that the beginning newspapers were headlines from the early 1950s, which, although relevant to the subject of UFOs, had nothing to do with the work that Nick Pope did.  I kept wondering, throughout the movie, when that would be tied in, and it never was.",4,"Interesting video, Interesting material",1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,1673,"['did', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'new', 'information', 'only', 'new', 'thing', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'air', 'traffic', 'radar', 'computer-programmed', 'hide', 'aircraft', 'traveling', 'high', 'rates', 'speed', 'found', 'interesting', 'not', 'worth', 'five', 'stars.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'attended', 'UFO', 'conferences', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'UFO', 'books', 'do', 'have', 'interest', 'subject', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'interesting', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'high-value', 'sightings', 'sightings', 'trained', 'observers', 'meterologists', 'airline', 'captains', 'police', 'officers', 'etc', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'official', 'reports', 'then', 'follow-up', 'research', 'lack', 'thereof', 'good', 'introduction', 'someone', 'who', 'real', 'interest', 'getting', 'reputable', 'information.I', 'thought', 'much', 'not', 'music', 'was', 'appropriate', 'added', 'strength', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'jarring', 'spikey.The', 'basic', 'format', 'two', 'people', 'sitting', 'room', 'staring', 'other', 'intrinsically', 'difficult', 'format', 'keep', 'audience', 'involved', 'Nick', 'Pope', 'compelling', 'voice', 'authenticity.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'interview', 'when', 'Pope', 'was', 'asked', 'were', 'disinformation', 'agent', 'definitely', 'had', 'reaction', 'question', 'also', 'noticed', 'film', 'went', 'black-and-white', 'color', 'point', 'wonder', 'was', 'subliminal', 'message', 'that.One', 'other', 'point', 'have', 'make', 'beginning', 'newspapers', 'were', 'headlines', 'early', '1950s', 'relevant', 'subject', 'UFOs', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'work', 'Nick', 'Pope', 'did', 'kept', 'wondering', 'movie', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'tied', 'never', 'was']",NICK POPE -The man who left the MOD
