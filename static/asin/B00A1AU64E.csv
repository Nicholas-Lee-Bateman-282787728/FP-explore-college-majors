Lionel Barrymore was superb in his role as the Master of the ship.  It was one of Henry Morgan's earliest movies in which he had a small part.  Richard Widmark's performance was a little mediocre, but was understandable.  But, the biggest star by far was the young grandson of the Master, Dean Stockwell (of Quantum Leap).

We see a bit of the lives of these New England whalers while they are ashore, and then we see a bit of how life must have been on the whaling vessels.

Phelps,"[1, 1]","There are books considered classics, but from the Cinema Archives of 20th Century Fox, here is a movie classicof a bygone era of the Whaling Ships that left the seaports of New England to sail the Atlantic Ocean.  It isforgotten, that in the Navy of America and those of Europe, it was not unusual to have midshipmen, cabin boysor crew members that were only boys starting at the 12 or 13 years of age and older.  The same applied tocommercial vessels. Some of those boys were lost at sea.  In this classic movie, a Grandfather takes hisGrandson to sea as a crewmember on a whaling Ship.  Such boys received their education as well as ship dutieson board for the entire cruise. Richard Widmark is the Ship Master who serves under the Captain who is alsothe Grandfather as played by Lionel Barrymore.  Young Dean Stockwell is the Grandson.  The performance of themen and the boy are exemplary and exceptional in their acting roles. Here is an excellentfamily movie as well as adventure and the well portrayed reality not everyone has a happy ending to challenges.Here is a way of adventurous life of a past era, the viewer can only dream about, but relive in this movie.The production and visual acuity of the cinematography is so perfected it seems like the sea salt can be smelled,the winds are felt, to the extent the viewer is standing on board or in a boat ready to throw the harpoon intothe whale.

Simply stated Bering Joy the Captain of a Whaling ship wants to take grandson Jed out to follow in ""Gramps"" footsteps. Unbeknown to Bering though the Company that employes him ,due to poor health and age has all but written him off for future voyages. Despite whaling records even in the recent past, they are nervous, they need insurance and they get it. Enter Ricard Widmark as Dan Lunceford. The soon to be First Mate ( and Captain in waiting)has a Master's Licence, sea experience ( despite being quite young) & a wealth of Book-Learning degrees & school taught smarts that makes old Bering very nervous. Still the crafty, crusty old sea dog finds a way to turn everything to his advantage. Further to that unfolds an adventure that you will never forget. I give this movie 5 stars. It's one thing to present a picture that keeps your attention entertains & excites you. This presentation certainly does that. When you get a story that gives you keen insight into the human condition & spirit, you have very much more. Much in the way young Jed matures over the voyage, we do as well. The harsh Code of the Sea proves not to be the cruel master we first see it to be but a necessary foundation that perpetuates their existence. Every sentence, every word has meaning in this movie. No dialogue is forced, excessive or over the top at any time. When words don't suffice, then facial expressions reveal the true heartfelt feelings. I hope the picture hasn't been painted here as a taught psychological drama bereft of action. thats not the case, there's plenty happening on the old whaler ( The Pride of Bedford), it's just that there's so much there to discover. Lionel Barrymore as Bering & Dean Stockwell as Jed are excellent but as good as they are Richard Widmark's performance is off the chart. He previously has been cast as one dimensional psychos & heavies and we are so lucky he broke this typecast to deliver this kind of performance. This is one movie the whole family can watch and enjoy ( remember those kind of films?)and they will. You will spot a couple of actors here as well that went on become big tv stars but for now I will leave it there.

I remember DTTSIS as a young man and it always was a movie I wanted to see 50 years later but it was never available until now. 20th Century Fox finally released it and I am really impressed with the quality of the picture as well as the sound of it. It rings true with the sense of whaling in the latter part of the 19th century. Widmark, Stockwell and of course Barrymore could not have been a better choice to see this movie in its full granduer!  There are few whaling movies I am familiar with with the exception of Moby Dick with Gregory Peck as Ahab, but Barrymore brings a more intense, sincere and emotional style to this movie. Widmark was truly the ""star"" of this motion picture but I do not slighten Stockwell's performance with Widmark.  McIntire, Flippen, Calloway and of course, Harry Morgan(M*A*S*H) rounds out the movie! Not being part of the sea(raised on a cattle ranch in Arizona), I always enjoyed movies about the sea and of course related movies. There are many but I can't recall them!
