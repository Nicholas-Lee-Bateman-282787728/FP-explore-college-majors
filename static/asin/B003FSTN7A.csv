I typically justify this by saying it has too many sappy and sentimental moments to it.  However, I must admit, I basically like it the way it is.  Patricia Arquette has long before this show been an excellent actress.  She brought all her film ability to the small screen.  That sets this show apart immediately as an A list actress anchors it. She believably plays a wife and mother who is also a psychic. She is able to see the dead or threatened in both her dreams and at times while awake.She has three daughters, all of whom are gaining the same ability.  I especially enjoyed the daughters this season.  Two scenes spring to mind: Ariel, the eldest, dealing with a giant Beaver ghost who is making a small boy's mother miserable AND Bridget, the middle daughter, who works in the library (to pay off her fines) who writes an email for a dead woman and sees a trickster in princely array, thus identifying the source of his fraud.  There are many more incidents but these two kids are terrific and have really hit their strides with the series.Joe, the husband and father, is odd man out, as he cannot see any of these things, which are daily grist for the rest of his family.  Ironically, the wacko techie genius he now works for makes his family members seem normal! There are some very funny scenes with Joe attempting to work with this guy, which alleviate the tension from the rest of the show. One scene with the department of defense and these two is uproarious.Bringing up the rear are the DA and the detective.  They actually have very little screen time which is to the good.  They do not bring anything unusual or interesting to the series but we do need to see the psychic working within the DA's office and with the police.The guest stars are pretty good but over time it is this week in and week out cast which has made the series something to look forward to as one's weekly viewing.",5,I Look Forward To It Every Week,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,1957,"['usually', 'give', 'series', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'typically', 'justify', 'saying', 'too', 'many', 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'basically', 'way', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'long', 'show', 'been', 'excellent', 'actress', 'brought', 'film', 'ability', 'small', 'screen', 'show', 'apart', 'immediately', 'A', 'list', 'actress', 'anchors', 'believably', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'also', 'psychic', 'able', 'see', 'dead', 'threatened', 'dreams', 'times', 'awake.She', 'three', 'daughters', 'whom', 'are', 'gaining', 'same', 'ability', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'daughters', 'season', 'Two', 'scenes', 'spring', 'mind', 'Ariel', 'eldest', 'dealing', 'giant', 'Beaver', 'ghost', 'who', 'making', 'small', 'boy', 'mother', 'miserable', 'AND', 'Bridget', 'middle', 'daughter', 'who', 'library', 'pay', 'off', 'fines', 'who', 'email', 'dead', 'woman', 'trickster', 'princely', 'array', 'thus', 'identifying', 'source', 'fraud', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'incidents', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'terrific', 'have', 'really', 'hit', 'strides', 'series.Joe', 'husband', 'father', 'odd', 'man', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'daily', 'grist', 'rest', 'family', 'Ironically', 'wacko', 'techie', 'genius', 'now', 'family', 'members', 'seem', 'normal', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'attempting', 'work', 'guy', 'alleviate', 'tension', 'rest', 'show', 'One', 'scene', 'department', 'defense', 'two', 'uproarious.Bringing', 'up', 'rear', 'are', 'DA', 'detective', 'actually', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'bring', 'anything', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'series', 'do', 'see', 'psychic', 'working', 'DA', 'office', 'police.The', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'week', 'week', 'cast', 'made', 'series', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'one', 'weekly', 'viewing']",N/A

Are we all doomed to watch mindless reality programs that show people at their worst? Programs where you can ""text"" while watching TV and not miss a thing? When I heard that MEDIUM had been cancelled, I can't say I was surprised. It was different than other programs and it seems that networks consider that a bad thing.I've spent the past month watching MEDIUM from the very beginning to the end of Season 6 on DVDs. I fell in love with the characters all over again. Then I cursed the networks for being such spineless cowards for cancelling it. While I watched Season 6, I noticed a shift in the story line. We saw more dreams from Bridget, Marie and especially, Ariel. Is this what brought the ratings down and made the network cancel it? Was the public unhappy about this change or were they unable to understand the plot while ""texting""? As much as I prefer to see Allison in the lead role, it was a nice change to see what the girls were experiencing for a few episodes. As Ariel grew closer to high school graduation and going on to college, I felt this would open the door to more story possibilities. I never imagined this change would turn viewers away and bring on the death of this wonderful program.For me....this was the last program I still enjoyed watching on television. Now I'll go to my DVD collection for entertainment. There are no commercials to destroy the plots and I am entertained by everything I see. Now that MEDIUM is no more, if I had my way I'd cancel our satellite TV all together. I consider it a waste of money since no one can ever find anything that's worth watching. I'm anxiously awaiting the release of the final Season 7 of MEDIUM. I will be among the first to purchase it, knowing there will be no more episodes. Maybe sometime, in the far future, some network executive will get the bright idea to bring another different kind of program to television. To be different and offer variety to the viewers.

NBC has a bad reputation of canceling shows before they even get big or big enough to become huge hits. Sure enough, here we are 6 years later going on the 7th season, of Medium. Thank God, that CBS picked up Medium last fall, because NBC said Medium was out performing their other shows like Heroes (now look who got canceled).Fortunately, CBS picked up Medium in the fall 0f 2009 and we got to see the 6th season.  I truly believe the writers of Medium have a lot in store for Season 7, involving the girls, Joe, and Allison. I think our next adventure of Medium will most likely be the last unless something miraculous happens like a spin off show which someone in the comment section said. I think this season will focus more on the girls and the Ariel in school. It's amazing how time flies. Seems just like yesterday that this show began.I hope Season 6 is released no later than October, because there were several I had to miss due to work, but overall, this season was by far the best.

1344556,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B003FSTN7A,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[11, 11]","Years ago, broadcast TV was full of good (non-reality) shows. Nowadays, not so much. Past seasons, I too would have given this show a 4-star review. It's always been watchable, and Patricia Arquette is dynamic & completely natural in this role, but this season has given us the best from the child actors. Perhaps the change in networks did it good. In any event, I'm glad it's been renewed again.Sofia Vassilieva, in particular, showed immense maturity, range & talent this season. Some of the best scenes of the season involved episodes where her character, Ariel, was the main focus. Two that stand out in my mind are one where she is temporarily overcome by someone else's persona (it sounds ridiculous, but it's played out with care & subtlety) & one in which Ariel loses time inexplicably, seeing herself progress into her twenties & thirties. That episode, which thrust Ariel into her possible future, was wonderfully written & was even one that tugged at the heartstrings. Maria Lark (Bridget) is also a talented young actress, though her versatility & appeal is not up to that of Vassilieva's. I will say that both are actresses that seem like normal children on the show, not obsessed with boys, clothes or computer games. The family element of the show is refreshingly wholesome.That said, some of the subject matter & visual content, especially for a network show, is pretty graphic. If you can't take seeing violence or seeing someone in mortal fear, this is not the show for you. Each show is crafted to make one think, to keep one in suspense & sometimes it shows the darkest side of humanity possible in the process. I think that it's a show which would appeal to loyal viewers of any ghost-related program, ""Dark Shadows"" fans from back in the day, programs like that. Despite the fact that this show is about a medium, with psychic visions & dreams, someone who often sees the dead, it comes across in such a way that you can't brandish the characters crazy or even strange. This is ""real life"" with a twist. I like Jake Weber as Allison's patient, loving but strong-willed husband & particularly enjoy scenes with David Cubitt (Det. Lee Scanlon). The progression of the supporting characters, delving into their personal lives, has been an enjoyable foray.This is a show you have to watch every minute of, or you'll probably miss something important to the episode. The show typically has a real conclusion at the end of each episode- you're not usually left dangling till next week to see what happened on a particular case. The writing is top-notch, I'd say 90-95% of the time.
