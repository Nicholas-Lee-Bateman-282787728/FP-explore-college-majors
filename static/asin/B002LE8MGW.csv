1276185,A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,B002LE8MGW,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[4, 7]","A wonderful film, filled with rich, nuanced, adult sized performances. Although ""Coco Avant Chanel"" is about how Gabrielle Bonheur Chanels became ""Coco"" Chanel, it is also about the men in her life. Here the film shines, unexpectedly, as both the male leads are given well crafted flesh and blood characters by the writers, and above all by the actors Benot Poelvoorde and Alessandro Nivola, and by the director.Audrey Tautou is stunning. She combines in her embodiment of Coco a flinty, no nonsense resolve, and not a little ambivalence about men, with a willful charm and talent for displaying the subtle conflicts felt by Coco as she is torn between goals and love, comfort and freedom, poverty and success. If there was anyone born to play Coco it's Audrey Tautou.The film is directed by a female director, Anne Fontaine, which is cause for comment only because, in this French production, the hand of a female director does not produce the gratuitous, pandering pop-feminism and in your face attitudinizing that would be the norm in any American production. All the more remarkable in a film story about the rise of a strong willed woman in a man's world to become one of the greatest names in fashion and commerce of her era, creating a brand that lives on with the highest reputation.Instead, the director not only recreates a wonderfully detailed vista of French life and aristocratic pursuits but gives us three complex, willful and fully human figures, all presented in a beautiful production with a great story. French films frequently excel in this way, and also tend to come to meandering conclusions once the human insights have been made. This film suffers from this syndrome as well. But the time is well spent. Highly recommended.",5,If there was anyone born to play Coco it's Audrey Tautou,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,1747,"['wonderful', 'film', 'filled', 'rich', 'nuanced', 'adult', 'sized', 'performances', 'Coco', 'Avant', 'Chanel', 'how', 'Gabrielle', 'Bonheur', 'Chanels', 'became', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'also', 'men', 'life', 'Here', 'film', 'shines', 'unexpectedly', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'given', 'well', 'crafted', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'writers', 'actors', 'Benot', 'Poelvoorde', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'director.Audrey', 'Tautou', 'stunning', 'embodiment', 'Coco', 'flinty', 'nonsense', 'resolve', 'not', 'little', 'ambivalence', 'men', 'willful', 'charm', 'talent', 'displaying', 'subtle', 'conflicts', 'felt', 'Coco', 'torn', 'goals', 'love', 'comfort', 'freedom', 'poverty', 'success', 'was', 'anyone', 'born', 'play', 'Coco', 'Audrey', 'Tautou.The', 'film', 'directed', 'female', 'director', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'cause', 'comment', 'only', 'French', 'production', 'hand', 'female', 'director', 'not', 'produce', 'gratuitous', 'pandering', 'pop-feminism', 'face', 'attitudinizing', 'would', 'be', 'norm', 'American', 'production', 'more', 'remarkable', 'film', 'story', 'rise', 'strong', 'willed', 'woman', 'man', 'world', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'names', 'fashion', 'commerce', 'era', 'creating', 'brand', 'highest', 'reputation.Instead', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'vista', 'French', 'life', 'aristocratic', 'pursuits', 'three', 'complex', 'willful', 'fully', 'human', 'figures', 'presented', 'beautiful', 'production', 'great', 'story', 'French', 'films', 'frequently', 'excel', 'way', 'also', 'tend', 'come', 'meandering', 'conclusions', 'once', 'human', 'insights', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'suffers', 'syndrome', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Blue jeans and a t-shirt suit me just fine for most occasions. So when my wife wanted me to watch a foreign film about some gal named ""Chanel"" who was a famous clothes designer, I felt like I was in for an early bedtime (I can easily fall asleep during boring films).So we slipped the DVD in and proceeded to watch what I assumed would be an incredibly monotonous film about a lady making clothing. I could hear my wife already: ""Oooh. Isn't that beautiful."" Or ""Look how well she hemmed that pinafore"" (whatever the hell a pinafore is ...and can you hem it? I still don't know).But, much to my surprise, the film was more a myopic on the early life of Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel. Hence the name Coco BEFORE Chanel. Duh. Guess I should've paid better attention to the title.There's certainly information and dress-wear visuals throughout, but the movie is more honed toward what made Coco who she would become later in life. Audrey Tautou plays the prime role of Coco and does so with grace, beauty, and a unique gruffness and individuality that struck me as incredibly honest (I did not enjoy her performance inThe Da Vinci Code, so this was a nice change). She really carried the entire film and made every scene extremely watchable.But the screenplay by writer/director Anne Fontaine was what helped keep this film together. Like I said at the beginning of my review, I felt that if it had expressly focused on clothing and the making of clothing, I would've been sawing some serious Zs before 30 minutes into the film. But I wasn't. Similar in concept toThe Devil Wears Prada(which I also enjoyed mostly because of Meryl Streeps stellar performance), the film never lingers overly long on things that simply don't matter at that point in Coco's life. It is her lovers, her fiery desire to do something with her life, and her heartbreaks that made her who she would become, not the clothes (those were developing and came later).So if you're like me, and don't know Chanel from Shinola, you still might give this one a try. Your wife will probably love it, and you'll score some points with her for watching it. Just don't give her the credit cards after finishing it. I just looked online at the cost of Chanel wear and ...well ...you don't wanna know.",4,I Didn't Know Chanel From Shinola...,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,2347,"[""'m"", 'guy', 'Okay', 'Let', 'get', 'bag', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'what', 'wear', 'Blue', 'jeans', 't-shirt', 'suit', 'just', 'fine', 'most', 'occasions', 'So', 'when', 'wife', 'wanted', 'watch', 'foreign', 'film', 'gal', 'named', 'Chanel', 'who', 'was', 'famous', 'clothes', 'designer', 'felt', 'was', 'early', 'bedtime', 'can', 'easily', 'fall', 'asleep', 'boring', 'films', '.So', 'slipped', 'DVD', 'proceeded', 'watch', 'what', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'monotonous', 'film', 'lady', 'making', 'clothing', 'could', 'hear', 'wife', 'already', 'Oooh', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'Look', 'how', 'well', 'hemmed', 'pinafore', 'hell', 'pinafore', 'can', 'hem', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '.But', 'much', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'myopic', 'early', 'life', 'Gabrielle', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'Hence', 'name', 'Coco', 'BEFORE', 'Chanel', 'Duh', 'Guess', 'should', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'better', 'attention', 'title.There', 'certainly', 'information', 'dress-wear', 'visuals', 'movie', 'more', 'honed', 'what', 'made', 'Coco', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'later', 'life', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'prime', 'role', 'Coco', 'so', 'grace', 'beauty', 'unique', 'gruffness', 'individuality', 'struck', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'inThe', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'really', 'carried', 'entire', 'film', 'made', 'scene', 'extremely', 'screenplay', 'writer/director', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'was', 'what', 'helped', 'keep', 'film', 'together', 'said', 'beginning', 'review', 'felt', 'had', 'expressly', 'focused', 'clothing', 'making', 'clothing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sawing', 'serious', 'Zs', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Similar', 'concept', 'toThe', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'mostly', 'Meryl', 'Streeps', 'stellar', 'performance', 'film', 'never', 'overly', 'long', 'things', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'point', 'Coco', 'life', 'lovers', 'fiery', 'desire', 'do', 'something', 'life', 'heartbreaks', 'made', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'not', 'clothes', 'were', 'developing', 'came', 'later', '.So', ""'re"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chanel', 'Shinola', 'still', 'might', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'wife', 'will', 'probably', 'love', ""'ll"", 'score', 'points', 'watching', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'credit', 'cards', 'finishing', 'just', 'looked', 'online', 'cost', 'Chanel', 'wear', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'know']",N/A

The ridiculous addition of a fictitious character who plays Coco's sister (in the extars you learn she's an amalgam of Coco's aunt and one of her sisters) to show Coco's gentle side was just plain silly.

1276188,A1NSWV5MOGQ31A,B002LE8MGW,"Carrie Dunham-LaGree ""nomadreader""","[67, 71]","Coco Before Chanel is aptly titled; it follows Coco Chanel from her time in an orphanage, but it stops where most people become familiar with her story. The film stars the delightful Audrey Tatou as Coco. Perhaps my favorite thing about Coco Before Chanel was it's honesty. I confess to loving the feel-good rags to riches biopics as much as anyone, but it's rare to see a biographical film provide hope with honesty and without sappiness. Most of the film is not feel good. It's hardly depressing, but it is real. Coco didn't have an easy life. She and her sister were orphans, and they fought for opportunities. Coco makes some decisions she may not be proud of, but she doesn't regret them. She doesn't have the dream of becoming a fashion designer from day one, just as few of us truly know what we'll end up doing from the beginning. Her skills, experience and desire for self-sufficiency slowly evolve to lead her to it.The film is a little slow, but it's similar to the pace of her life. It seems like it's not going anywhere for awhile, and if you didn't know what Chanel is, you might think that. I personally thought the subtitles were a little fast. My French is decent enough to understand some of the dialogue, but I often read the subtitle before the characters had begun to speak their lines. The beautiful lulls of dialogue featured the next subtitle, which threw off the pace a bit for me.The beauty of the film comes in its last half hour, when it becomes clear the slowness was in fact subtlety leading to a mesmerizing and poetic final half-hour. It's the kind of film one might be tempted to stop watching if she were at home, but ends up loving. It truly is a film that is the sum of it's parts. It works as a whole, but it's not necessarily riveting from the opening frame.It's a beautifully feminist film; it's an honest look at one woman's struggle and journey for her place in the world. It's not a film with universal appeal, but it is a fantastic, beautiful, and inspiring film. If you like foreign films, historical films, biopics and strong female leads, then I highly recommend this film.",5,"slow, subtle and absolutely beautiful",1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,2119,"['Coco', 'Before', 'Chanel', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'time', 'orphanage', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'become', 'familiar', 'story', 'film', 'delightful', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'Coco', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'thing', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'was', 'honesty', 'confess', 'loving', 'feel-good', 'rags', 'riches', 'biopics', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'rare', 'see', 'biographical', 'film', 'hope', 'honesty', 'sappiness', 'Most', 'film', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'hardly', 'depressing', 'real', 'Coco', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'easy', 'life', 'sister', 'were', 'orphans', 'fought', 'opportunities', 'Coco', 'decisions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'proud', ""n't"", 'regret', ""n't"", 'have', 'dream', 'becoming', 'fashion', 'designer', 'day', 'one', 'just', 'few', 'truly', 'know', 'what', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'beginning', 'Her', 'skills', 'experience', 'desire', 'self-sufficiency', 'slowly', 'evolve', 'lead', 'it.The', 'film', 'little', 'slow', 'similar', 'pace', 'life', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'awhile', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Chanel', 'might', 'think', 'personally', 'thought', 'subtitles', 'were', 'little', 'fast', 'French', 'decent', 'enough', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'often', 'read', 'subtitle', 'characters', 'had', 'begun', 'speak', 'lines', 'beautiful', 'lulls', 'dialogue', 'featured', 'next', 'subtitle', 'threw', 'off', 'pace', 'bit', 'me.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'clear', 'slowness', 'was', 'fact', 'subtlety', 'leading', 'mesmerizing', 'poetic', 'final', 'half-hour', 'kind', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'stop', 'watching', 'were', 'home', 'up', 'loving', 'truly', 'film', 'sum', 'parts', 'whole', 'not', 'necessarily', 'riveting', 'opening', 'frame.It', 'beautifully', 'feminist', 'film', 'honest', 'look', 'one', 'woman', 'struggle', 'journey', 'place', 'world', 'not', 'film', 'universal', 'appeal', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'film', 'like', 'foreign', 'films', 'historical', 'films', 'biopics', 'strong', 'female', 'leads', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

It is a moving portrait of the very early life and influences on Coco Chanel. The film is beautifully shot, scored, acted, and subtitled. As other reviewers have noted for the CD sountrack,the music is fabulous, and the movie is visually gorgeous. The acting is superb. Audrey Tautou is another great french beauty and star; I'm sure I will not be the first to compare her to Katherine Deneuve.This movie unflinchingly shows the young women of the time for whom love with marriage was rarely an option as they were simply chattel forced to marry well by birth, become nuns, sleep their way to wealth and security as mistresses and courteseans, or have nothing as prostitutes. The only single working women other than prostitutes and a few writers were on the stage, in convents,or providing clothes for wealthy women. The film follows the young Coco through her world as a abandoned child in a catholic orphanage and then a mistress/houseguest of a vastly wealthy nobleman. It touches on her good luck in timing to get her accounts away from her lover in time to save her fledgling business.We see how the lifestyles and even the health of wealthy and frivolous women were drastically changed by the comfort and function of her designs and her eye for beauty. This picture is a period piece that builds slowly, is very French and assumes you already know a bit about Chanel. It is at times quite subtle leaving a lot of the plot obvious but not presented onscreen. It would companion well with a more detailed documentary like ""Chanel Chanel"" with Chanel and Lagerfield, but it does present an excellent picture of ""Coco's"" youth and is a good picture on its own. The whole picture is beautifully acted eye candy and the dessert at the end is lovely as we are given a show of Chanel looks throughout her life. I did not give it five stars only because at times I think it was a bit too subtle as those not familiar with the period could watch the film and not fully understand the dramatic changes in the lives of women led by the dramatic changes in fashion they were witnessing.",4,Excellent movie draws out Chanel's influences,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,2187,"['are', 'looking', 'fashion', 'history', 'lots', 'dresses', 'la', 'project', 'runway', 'not', 'movie', 'moving', 'portrait', 'very', 'early', 'life', 'influences', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scored', 'acted', 'subtitled', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'CD', 'sountrack', 'music', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'acting', 'superb', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'great', 'french', 'beauty', 'star', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'compare', 'Katherine', 'Deneuve.This', 'movie', 'unflinchingly', 'young', 'women', 'time', 'whom', 'love', 'marriage', 'was', 'rarely', 'option', 'were', 'simply', 'chattel', 'forced', 'marry', 'well', 'birth', 'become', 'nuns', 'sleep', 'way', 'wealth', 'security', 'mistresses', 'courteseans', 'have', 'nothing', 'prostitutes', 'only', 'single', 'working', 'women', 'other', 'prostitutes', 'few', 'writers', 'were', 'stage', 'convents', 'providing', 'clothes', 'wealthy', 'women', 'film', 'young', 'Coco', 'world', 'abandoned', 'child', 'catholic', 'orphanage', 'then', 'mistress/houseguest', 'vastly', 'wealthy', 'nobleman', 'good', 'luck', 'timing', 'get', 'accounts', 'away', 'lover', 'time', 'save', 'fledgling', 'business.We', 'see', 'how', 'lifestyles', 'even', 'health', 'wealthy', 'frivolous', 'women', 'were', 'drastically', 'changed', 'comfort', 'function', 'designs', 'eye', 'beauty', 'picture', 'period', 'piece', 'slowly', 'very', 'French', 'already', 'know', 'bit', 'Chanel', 'times', 'quite', 'subtle', 'leaving', 'lot', 'plot', 'obvious', 'not', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'would', 'companion', 'well', 'more', 'detailed', 'documentary', 'Chanel', 'Chanel', 'Chanel', 'Lagerfield', 'present', 'excellent', 'picture', 'Coco', 'youth', 'good', 'picture', 'own', 'whole', 'picture', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'eye', 'candy', 'dessert', 'end', 'lovely', 'are', 'given', 'show', 'Chanel', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'because', 'times', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'subtle', 'not', 'familiar', 'period', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'lives', 'women', 'led', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'fashion', 'were', 'witnessing']",N/A

The scenes are mostly without ""action"", and you better be prepared for long camera shots. That said, I absolutely loved the serene scenes, and the enchanting dialogue. Just a little bit of nitpicking - I hate it when translators change the words of songs. I understand dialog cannot be word for word, but a traditional french song loses it's charm when incorrectly translated. I have spoken french for about 20 years now, and it irked me. That said, my wife said it was nice to get the real meanings when I translated.The blu-ray quality was pretty decent, a lot sharper than the original.

Coco Chanel, the French fashion designer who is one of the most important fashion figureheads of the 20th Century.But before she became the popular fashion designer, Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel had her own set of challenges and personal tribulations and that personal life is explored in the 2009 book by Edmonde Charles-Roux and further explored in the biopic ""Coco avant Chanel"" (Coco Before Chanel) directed by actress/writer Anne Fontaine (""La fille de Monaco"", ""Nouvelle chance"", ""Nathalie) in collaboration with writer Camille Fontaine (""La grande vie"", ""L'oeil de l'autre"").The film is from Warner Bros. Pictures but is distributed in the US by Sony Pictures Classics and on video by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  The film has grossed over $43 million worldwide and for a foreign film, made around $6 million in the U.S.  ""Coco Before Chanel"" also earned a BAFTA Award nominations in four categories including ""Best Foreign Film"" and ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" for Audrey Tautou.VIDEO:""Coco Before Chanel"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray capturing the detail of the early 1900's from the clothing to the living area of Balsan's castle and definitely another solid release in terms of picture quality from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.You can see the detail of the woven wool clothing of the garment to the exteriors of the walls and steps of Balsan's castle.  The leaves on the ground, the grass on the fields, the garment textures...as mentioned the clothing, may it be wool, silk or lace.  A solid presentation when it comes to detail.  As for the colors, the film is not exactly vibrant.  In fact, I believe it was intentional to give the film of Gabrielle's past life this washed out look.  Possibly in tuned to capturing a look for that era. While Detail is maintained, the color pallet was intentional courtesy of cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne (""Paris"", ""The Inner Life of Martin Frost"", Mr. Nobody"").  Blacks are nice and deep and there is also a fine layer of grain throughout the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Audio is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Although the film is dialogue driven, there are moments where you can hear the crowd ambiance (Balsan's parties) to the sounds that are reflected from the natural surroundings of Balsan's castle.  From horses galloping to the sounds of Boy's vehicle driving on the roads.  But the film is dialogue driven and dialogue is crystal clear including the musical portions of the film, especially the wonderful soundtrack and musical score by composer Alexandre Desplat (""The Ghost Writer"", ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", ""Julie & Julia"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"").Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Coco Before Chanel"" comes with the following special features in standard definition (with English and French Stereo and English subtitles):* Commentary by Director and Writer Anne Fontaine - In this audio commentary, writer/director Anne Fontaine is joined by producer Philippe Carcassonne and editor Luc Barnier.

The documentary is broken down in the following chapters: The Project's Origins, Coco' Look, An Extraordinry Destiny, Etienne Balsan, Boy Capel, Historical Reconstruction and Anne Fontaine.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:02) The original theatrical trailer for ""Coco Before Chanel"".* BD-Live EnabledJUDGMENT CALL:""Coco Before Chanel"" was an intriguing and enjoyable biopic of the popular designer.I have to admit that I am quite ignorant when it comes to Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel, the woman who created this fashion empire as opposed to knowing the brand and of course the Chanel no. 5 fragrance showcased in my wife's fashion magazines.  But I did find the story about Chanel's life to be quite entertaining and the performance by Audrey Tautou (as always) magnificent.Of course, there is more to the story of Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel that is not in this film including her relationship with composer Igor Stravinsky and also what took place during World War II which was very controversial.  But this biopic is more about a woman's survival and wanting to make the best for herself and doing it her way.  And ""Coco Before Chanel"", especially with the release of this film on Blu-ray definitely gives viewers a chance to know the woman behind the famous fashion brand.I don't really know how different Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel's real life was different in compared to what we seen in the film (or how different the original book is from the film) but it was quite intriguing to see this early portrait of the life of Coco Chanel and how her experiences, eventually became the precursor to the famous fashion empire.""Coco Before Chanel"" is definitely a film for those who are curious about the woman behind the brand and also for Audrey Tautou fans who know the quality of her acting.

1276194,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002LE8MGW,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 0]","In a curious mixture of somber reality and breakout sentimentality, Anne Fontaine's biopic ""Coco Before Chanel"" showcases Audrey Tatou (Am&eacute;lie) in an anti-gamin role as hardscrabble feminist Gabrielle Chanel, one of the great fashion innovators of the twentieth century.  Fontaine's juxtaposing of the realities of an unmarried woman's life at the end of the Belle Epoque and the unemotional resignation and resentment of convention as displayed by Gabrielle (nicknamed Coco as she sings a bawdy ditty of the same name in a dance hall) resonates well within the framework of this attractive film with lush scenes of country life and realistic moments of inspiration as Coco literally reinstates a woman's ability to breathe by removing cumbersome boned corseting.Tatou, with her dark eyes and pointed elfin face, smolders well as the stubborn Coco.  Left as a child with her sister by her father in an orphanage, Chanel realizes quickly that she must fend for herself.  Fontaine allows the audience to feel the emotional state of aloneness as they watch scene after scene of Coco's solitary silhouette waiting silently against a backdrop of activity none of which she participates within actively.  Fontaine forces us to perceive Coco as an observer--a voyeur watching a scene that she wishes to change.  Her attire always stands out--she is either dressed as a boy for comfort or has remade a structured garment to get a sense of less adornment and more functionality.  To some degree, she seems the black raven against a covey of overdressed plumed pigeons--she augurs what is to come--more freedom, yes--less pain, no.  In ""Coco Before Chanel,"" Tatou desires nothing but to fling off the loveable waif character of Amelie with satisfaction--her dark eyes muddy with intense shrewdness rather than twinkle with a naif's exuberance over the possibilities of life.Emphasizing that her view of the world is a sensible one is rou&eacute; Etienne Balsen, a wealthy country squire (played with perfect bored panache by Benot Poelvoorde) who resignedly allows the street-smart opportunist in Coco to move into his estate as his live-in, but not always seen mistress.  His 'je-ne-sais-quoi' expressionless face reflects a toughness that eventually fails when assailed by Coco's relentless insistence.  Only when Boy Capel (Alessandro Nivola) wins Coco's hard heart, does he falter in his Weltschmerz--the mask slips from his face for seconds and then he is back to planning his next debauched soiree.The appearance of Boy Capel heralds the only chink in Coco's armor.  A bittersweet Amelie-type waltz tinkles as the two smile, laugh, make love and money together, reminding us that there can be some happiness however ephemeral.  Again, the savvy Chanel acquiesces to the social rules of the time and yet stands her ground, ever the voyeur as he marries another of his class yet finances her venture.Fontaine's view of Coco depicts her from the start as destined to be an onlooker.  Society sets the stage and she ascertains that the actors and actresses are dressed in more comfortable clothing.  She changes a hat, removes a ribbon, creates unstructured garb out of fishermen's gear.  Nonetheless she waits, looks on, and never really engages.  As a filmmaker, Fontaine succeeds in creating a mood that smolders, briefly flickers into flame and then detaches for fear of further hurt.Bottom line?  Anne Fontaine creates a sad but magnificent portrait of Coco before fashion fame. She showcases the resignation of the film's women to the idea that legitimate social status was improved only through good marriage is illustrated by Coco as mistrustful mistress and opportunist, her sister Adrienne (Marie Gillain) who trades love for respectability and Emilienne (Emmanuelle Devos) whose career as an actress places her in the demimonde between the socially acceptable and the disreputable.  Her depiction of Coco smolders with moodiness, resentment and bittersweet inevitability.  The audience mesmerized by the soft beauty of the country and costumes looks on as Coco watches those around her--too hardened to really engage--too savvy to let her guard down more than once--and too street smart to all together give up. Perhaps it is she with her thin cigarette toting chic that trademarked for us all the rather cynical sophisticated French woman of the world.  Nonetheless, Tatou's performance is a departure from Amelie but every now and then she cannot fail to peak through the world-weary faade.

Coco was self-empowered and smashed the rules of proper etiquette for women far before it became fashionable.  Her indomitable spirit leaps off the screen with very little movement.  Charismatic personalities can make reading from a telephone book an awe-inspiring experience.  Throughout the movie, viewers witness Tautou's penetrating stare as an observer of the people around her.  What is she observing?  She sees the masks they wear;  Women overly adorning themselves in an attempt to fit into high society when their true selves cry out for simplicity. Coco saw it all and captured it with fashion.  She wasn't merely dressing women, she was leading a crusade.A French movie with sub titles provides an air of authenticity that would have been lost in English.

1276196,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002LE8MGW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","COCO BEFORE CHANEL (2009) was a difficult film for me to watch when it was new. In the first place, I was quite fed up with Coco Chanel (Audrey Tatou) constantly making whoopie with her boyfriend, the unfortunate Arthur Capel (Alessandro Nivola). On the other side of the coin she merely rolled her eyes at the other man who loved her, the Baron Balsan (a beautiful performance by Benoit Poelvoorde).Coco is of interest to me because she took the 19th century nonsense and single-handedly turned it into 20th century women's fashion. How she did it was inspired by both her poverty and her need for comfort, so she stole men's clothes. They tolerated her, it was France, what the heck. She began making hats that all the rich women loved, she ended by making dresses that are still the classics of today.This film is rich with detail and good performances, but I say it drags an awful lot. Had they concentrated on the work-as-part-of-life, we might have had a better insight into Chanel's mind. For example, her classic black dress - can there be another? - seems inspired by the deep, simple grief she felt upon the untimely death of Capel. And that's just it: this film neither confirms nor denies it. Annoying.The other aspects of this movie are excellent, but one other major criticism I have is I feel one cannot understand this film if one is not French. Not just the speech, heavens, no ... it's the whole French attitude. Either one 'gets it' or one may as well read a biography of Chanel. Those are not exactly flying off the bookshelves. Only one other complaint: is there a reason this rather short film does not cover the rest of Chanel's life? I mean, Shirley MacLaine did well enough, but why not this film?All in all, I'd say watch this for the history of one woman's dreams and her global achievements. It's inspirational, as Chanel indeed was, always. It may even inspire you to do what she did: steal a little something and make it your own.The fashion world, then as always, is waiting.",3,Do you want to breathe?,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2006,"['COCO', 'BEFORE', 'CHANEL', '2009', 'was', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'quite', 'fed', 'up', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'constantly', 'making', 'whoopie', 'boyfriend', 'unfortunate', 'Arthur', 'Capel', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'merely', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'Baron', 'Balsan', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Benoit', 'Poelvoorde', '.Coco', 'interest', 'took', '19th', 'century', 'nonsense', 'single-handedly', 'turned', '20th', 'century', 'women', 'fashion', 'How', 'did', 'was', 'inspired', 'poverty', 'need', 'comfort', 'stole', 'men', 'clothes', 'tolerated', 'was', 'France', 'what', 'heck', 'began', 'making', 'hats', 'rich', 'women', 'loved', 'ended', 'making', 'dresses', 'are', 'still', 'classics', 'today.This', 'film', 'rich', 'detail', 'good', 'performances', 'say', 'awful', 'lot', 'Had', 'concentrated', 'work-as-part-of-life', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'insight', 'Chanel', 'mind', 'example', 'classic', 'black', 'dress', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'inspired', 'deep', 'simple', 'grief', 'felt', 'untimely', 'death', 'Capel', 'just', 'film', 'confirms', 'Annoying.The', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'other', 'major', 'criticism', 'have', 'feel', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'French', 'Not', 'just', 'speech', 'heavens', 'whole', 'French', 'attitude', 'one', 'one', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'read', 'biography', 'Chanel', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'flying', 'off', 'bookshelves', 'Only', 'one', 'other', 'complaint', 'reason', 'rather', 'short', 'film', 'not', 'cover', 'rest', 'Chanel', 'life', 'mean', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'why', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'watch', 'history', 'one', 'woman', 'dreams', 'global', 'achievements', 'inspirational', 'Chanel', 'indeed', 'was', 'always', 'may', 'even', 'inspire', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'steal', 'little', 'something', 'make', 'own.The', 'fashion', 'world', 'then', 'always', 'waiting']",N/A

1276198,A24BEMERMTXJRY,B002LE8MGW,Ford Ka,"[2, 4]","""Coco Before Chanel"" is an interesting attempt at a biopic but rather little more. The story is told in good old fashioned way - no jumping back and forth, no experiments, and rather slowly too - the problem is that it takes so long that there is not enough time for the story to end in an interesting way. Or may be it was the idea from the start to get the audience begging for more? Another possibility is that they took it for granted that the audience knows what happened next. The French may know it, I don't. Actually, I may be utterly wrong but I have a hunch that the life of Coco Chanel gets really interesting only once the movie ends.This is a movie full of missed opportunities - Tautou has little chance to show her charms (she can do that, we all remember Amelie Poulain ;) - she hardly has a chance to smile... Chanel made her name as a dress designer? Well, don't expect to see any. Coco in the movie spends quite a lot of time watching fishermen at work. Does she find them so sexy? Not really, she finds their apparel an inspiration for her designs but... you won't see them in the movie. The fascination with how nicely the producers could recreate the fin-de-siecle provincial France on the screen reaches such proportions that it gets in the way of telling the story in an interesting manner. Too much attention to details, too little of a broader view.The director and screenplay writer intended to present to the audience the humble beginnings of Coco Chanel's career. The succeeded in that perfectly but the final result is far from perfect - there was, apparently, no room left for the actual career. All we get is a brief show just before credits rather loosely connected with what happened earlier - we just have to believe that she made it.

First, you had better like Audrey Tautou (I do), as the camera adores her. Second, really fluent French would be helpful, as the subtitles are barely adequate and the characters tend to mumble - but you will get the point anyway, as the emotions depicted are not subtle (or where they are, they are all written on Tautou's wonderfully expressive face). Finally, as some have noted, the film is slow-moving, yet it ends too soon. Yes, I know what the title says, but it still would have been nice to see a bit more of Coco after Chanel.

1276200,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002LE8MGW,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","COCO BEFORE CHANEL may have been avoided by some who thought the film might be a superficial sob story about  a 'little girl that makes good' - another cutesy venue for Audrey Tautou fans.  Nothing could be further from fact. Instead Writer/director Anne Fontaine (with Camille Fontaine) adapted the book by Edmonde Charles-Roux into a screenplay that is a serious look at times in La Belle Epoque France, a time when a little orphan girl and her sister made the best of losing parents, learning a trade, and using their fortitude to move into the upper circles of a society into which their presence was forbidden.  Yes, this could have been a saccharine mess of a movie, but due to the writing, directing and acting it is exactly the opposite: nothing can defeat an indomitable spirit.The film opens in France of 1893 as we see two sisters, motherless and with a father that is unable to cope,  dropped off to an orphanage.  The girls mature into Gabrielle/Coco (Audrey Tautou) and Adrienne (Marie Gillian) Chanel, gain skills as seamstresses and popularity for their singing at little parties.  Adrienne falls for a man of wealth and leaves Coco to develop her skills as a designer of chapeaux and dresses.  Her independent spirit is mirrored in the manner in which she does away with the excesses of contemporary garb (feather, birds, fake flowers, lots of ruffles and flounces and trains) and dresses in a more masculine, yet still very sophisticatedly beautiful way.  She is noticed by a gentleman landowner, &Eacute;tienne Balsan (Benot Poelvoorde) and Coco decides to take advantage of the comforts of wealth, moving in as  &Eacute;tienne's secret guest.  Through &Eacute;tienne's connection she meets French actress Emilienne d'Alenon (Emmanuelle Devos) who eagerly approves of Coco's fashion instincts and uses Coco's clothes in public and on stage, introducing the genius that wiil become Coco Chanel.  Coco also meets a British investor Arthur 'Boy' Capel (Alessandro Nivola in an astonishingly fine role) who provides financing for a studio in Paris where Coco becomes a popular fashion designer - and also falls in love with Boy only to lose him in a automobile accident.  By this time Coco's no nonsense approach to fashion - simplicity and understatement - has taken hold and the film ends with a parade on the Chanel stairway of mirrors of her magnificent creations: the saddened by indomitable Coco sits on the stairs as her models parade before an impressed audience.Audrey Tautou continues to grow as an actress and this may be her finest achievement to date.  She portrays Coco as a strong woman with a vulnerability she is able to camouflage. The entire cast is strong, with special nods to American born Alessandro Nivola who delivers his entire performance in impeccable French.  The cinematography of Paris and the countryside is beautifully captured by cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne, the gorgeous costumes are the work of Catherine Leterrier, and the musical score is perfectly placed in the always capable hands of Alexandre Desplat.  But much of the success of the film rests in the brilliant direction of Anne Fontaine who has managed to give us a fully three-dimensional picture of not only the brilliant Coco Chanel but of the times in Paris that nourished her rise and forever altered the way women would be perceived as equal to men.

Coco Chanel talked so much about the restrictions of women's clothing throughout the movie, and everything she wore was so boring... but then everything the models wore in the fashion show at the end was totally gorgeous. The outfit she was wearing at that point was very cute as well. I have to agree that getting rid of corsets and clothing that is so complicated that you need someone to help you dress is a good thing. But the level we have descended to today is just awful: 70% of people wearing jeans on a daily basis, looking like slobs, not to mention clones. And what's worse, sometimes a third of the people you see who are not wearing jeans are wearing sweat pants. I wonder what Ms. Chanel would think of that? I think it's pretty sad.The movie was excellent. I found it compelling and it held my attention throughout. The end seemed kind of abrupt. I would have liked to see a little more both before and after the fashion show. Audrey Tautou is a pretty interesting actress as well.

That being said, I wondered how long this film was going to be since her middle period (twenties thru thirties) seemed to cover the plupart of the movie.  When it suddenly jumped to 1971 or so, I was flabbergasted.  In short, the most interesting and problematic part of her life was left untouched.  What we get is a frothy romanticized view of a poor girl who yearns for love, mistakenly finds it in the Baron, finds true love with Boy, loses Boy, and then becomes the raging success of world fashion.  HUH?Much like her contemporary, Wallis Warfield Simpson, Chanel used her sexuality to move about in the world early in her career.  She SAID Boy was her true love, but for what it is worth that was a fairly brief and youthful escapade.  What is glaringly wrong here is the part about Chanel's anti-Semitism, her work as (what amounts to being) a Nazi collaborator, and her political intrigues in trying to get England to support Hitler's Nazism--this was not even touched by the film.I was highly disappointed in the film: it played up the early years to excess, focusing on ""poor Coco seeks love"" and then skips - not only the Nazi years, but how and why the woman became the top designer of the century.  What in the world was this film about? That huge huge leap from Boy's death to the runway show in the 70s was bizarre, to say the least.Yes, it is entitled COCO BEFORE CHANEL--but all it covered was two affairs and nothing of substance.I would not recommend this film-it tells you very little substantive stuff about Chanel's early years, does not address her success as a designer in any useful way, and leaves out the more dramatic and fascinating aspects of her personality -- it leaves her character a big question mark.",1,One-Third of a Story,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1950,"['will', 'jump', 'right', 'started', 'off', 'promising', 'film', 'attention', 'miniscule', 'detail', 'actress', 'LOOKED', 'Chanel', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'point', 'details', 'youth', 'covered', 'adequately', 'being', 'said', 'wondered', 'how', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'middle', 'period', 'twenties', 'thru', 'thirties', 'seemed', 'cover', 'plupart', 'movie', 'When', 'suddenly', 'jumped', '1971', 'so', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'short', 'most', 'interesting', 'problematic', 'part', 'life', 'was', 'left', 'untouched', 'What', 'get', 'frothy', 'romanticized', 'view', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'mistakenly', 'Baron', 'true', 'love', 'Boy', 'Boy', 'then', 'raging', 'success', 'world', 'fashion', 'HUH', 'Much', 'contemporary', 'Wallis', 'Warfield', 'Simpson', 'Chanel', 'used', 'sexuality', 'move', 'about', 'world', 'early', 'career', 'SAID', 'Boy', 'was', 'true', 'love', 'what', 'was', 'fairly', 'brief', 'youthful', 'escapade', 'What', 'glaringly', 'wrong', 'here', 'part', 'Chanel', 'anti-Semitism', 'work', 'what', 'being', 'Nazi', 'collaborator', 'political', 'intrigues', 'trying', 'get', 'England', 'support', 'Hitler', 'Nazism', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'touched', 'film.I', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'played', 'up', 'early', 'years', 'excess', 'focusing', 'poor', 'Coco', 'love', 'then', 'skips', 'not', 'only', 'Nazi', 'years', 'how', 'why', 'woman', 'became', 'top', 'designer', 'century', 'What', 'world', 'was', 'film', 'huge', 'huge', 'leap', 'Boy', 'death', 'runway', 'show', '70s', 'was', 'bizarre', 'say', 'least.Yes', 'entitled', 'COCO', 'BEFORE', 'CHANEL', 'covered', 'was', 'two', 'affairs', 'nothing', 'substance.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film-it', 'tells', 'very', 'little', 'substantive', 'stuff', 'Chanel', 'early', 'years', 'not', 'address', 'success', 'designer', 'useful', 'way', 'out', 'more', 'dramatic', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'personality', 'character', 'big', 'question', 'mark']",N/A

There are a few beautifully rendered scenes of true happiness, but Chanel's life was far from the banal frivolity of today's wealthy pop tarts. She enjoyed the luxurious leisure lifestyle of her companion in the French countryside, but she never became dominated by it. As a period piece, this movie is well done from the vintage cars to the coffee cups.Audrey Tautou (nearly an icon herself) plays the part of Coco Chanel. She's perfect for the part. Benoit Poelvoorde does a masterful job as the carefree aristocrat with his magnificent chateau. He's complex, sometimes playful or downright silly, usually kind and accommodating, honest, and ultimately endearing. I did not like the early depictions of Coco's life as a cabaret singer.

Even the directions for getting them was in French.  And one time, when I put the DVD on hold for about a minute and returned, the film was gone and it was back to the beginning.  Considering it took me abut half an hour to figure out how to get English sub-titles, I started over, and when finally getting to the part where I left off, there was someone narrating the film in French, and the sub titles were in French  while the actors were speaking French.  So, I started a third time. English sub-titles returned, but couldn't get rid of the French narration.  After the 4th time, I made it, and eventually sort of found where I left off.  This was about the time that Coco was leaving for Paris to become a hat designer. But by this time, I was feeling a bit angry.The English sub-titles were brief, and went by very quickly so it was hard to keep up with the movie and read the subs at the same time, but I tried. Needless to say, I really couldn't figure out what was going on most of the time.  I would say the best part was the end when they showed her fashions.  It could have been a good film, if it was in English, the actors could have had French accents, in fact her main boy friend was English, but of course he also spoke French.  blah!Finally, after loving the film ""Julie an Julia"" where Julia Child spent most of her time loving France, I had to wonder.  Julia Child loved the French, but the subs were in English, thank goodness. The French characters spoke English with accents.

But is it a full success? - she sits at the top of the elegant staircase, as a Chanel show proceeds below, but without Arthur, her first real romantic interest, who also supported her career and is nowhere in sight. Tautou, ultimately, is the same melancholy, conflicted individual, presented in the early scenes.When CoCo/Chanel is befriended by a Bi-sexual socialite, we surmise that said ""orientation"" may be another socially progressive trait for the designer, but this seems to be just the standard contemporary theme inserted for the viewer who is not comfortable seeing a lead woman character as dependent on men, to any extent.

Audrey Tautou is absolutely perfect for the role, combining a brittle sensitivity with the toughness of an individual who knows harsh disappointment in life.  There is also a wider caste of interesting characters, from the aristocratic gentleman farmer who takes her in and uses her yet falls for her and the British entrepreneur who encourages her at a critical time.The setting of the film is the last decade of the Belle &Eacute;poque, a time of peace when the privilege of aristocratic lifestyle is giving way to industrial capitalism; WWI is looming on the horizon.  This was a time when women wore corsets, which warped their figures, and extremely complex fashion accessories that required the help of at least one maid to put on and maintain.  The decadence, the sense that an order is passing, the range of effete sensibilities, and the realities of class are all portrayed with what can only be called brilliance.Into this mix comes Gabrielle Chanel, shunted aside by an unloving father and forced to make her own living after a long period in a catholic orphanage.  With only her sister, she makes her way as a singer and seamstress in a working class town, glimpsing but never falling into prostitution.  When her sister takes up with a Baron near Paris, who she vainly hopes will marry her,  Gabrielle shows up at the estate of an aristocrat lover she met in the cabaret, who offers her a place to stay and requires her to help entertain his friends.  An acute observer and courageous non-conformist, she suffers many slights verging on humiliation (including a poignant scene where she is forced to use a dirty napkin by the head butler) and struggles to establish a place for herself.The personal struggle of Coco as she is called is the stuff of great stories.  While considering marriage as an option, she does not like the idleness of her chosen milieu and wants instead to work, though few opportunities are available.  All the while, she is educating herself, not only by reading, but also by critically observing the style and behavior of the milieu.  Her personal crisis deepens into a kind of depression until she becomes the lover of a businessman who (she discovers to her chagrin) is going to marry an heiress.  Nonetheless, they develop a fruitful and unconventional relationship:  he offers the right word at the right time, providing crucial support as she leaves the comfort of her friend's chateau to found her business, and love.  Yet you can see how hard it was on her, how eventually she found herself in extremely hard work.  No wonder she is admired as an early feminist, entering a domain completely dominated by men and forever changing it.Though I have no interest in fashion, I was fascinated by the details of her creative contribution.  Stubbornly rejecting corsets and items that made women uncomfortable, she revolutionized haute couture virtually single-handedly with simpler clothes, often inspired by working class practicality.  While displayed in the film, this is explained in the wonderful ""extras"" that came with my dvd.Warmly recommended.  Though not a classical beauty (as Chanel was not), Tautou is utterly mesmerizing in her role.  In a way, this is as full of period texture as a French Merchant-Ivory film, though without the sentimentality.",5,an exceptionally fine period drama of coming of age,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,3541,"['one', 'best', 'French', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'story', 'young', 'Gabrielle', 'Chanel', 'who', 'must', 'raise', 'nothing', 'find', 'place', 'herself', 'French', 'society', 'establish', 'independence', 'own', 'terms', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'combining', 'brittle', 'sensitivity', 'toughness', 'individual', 'who', 'harsh', 'disappointment', 'life', 'also', 'wider', 'caste', 'interesting', 'characters', 'aristocratic', 'gentleman', 'farmer', 'who', 'yet', 'British', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'critical', 'time.The', 'setting', 'film', 'last', 'decade', 'Belle', 'Eacute', 'poque', 'time', 'peace', 'when', 'privilege', 'aristocratic', 'lifestyle', 'giving', 'way', 'industrial', 'capitalism', 'WWI', 'looming', 'horizon', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'women', 'wore', 'corsets', 'warped', 'figures', 'extremely', 'complex', 'fashion', 'accessories', 'required', 'help', 'least', 'one', 'maid', 'put', 'maintain', 'decadence', 'sense', 'order', 'passing', 'range', 'effete', 'sensibilities', 'realities', 'class', 'are', 'portrayed', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'mix', 'Gabrielle', 'Chanel', 'shunted', 'aside', 'unloving', 'father', 'forced', 'make', 'own', 'living', 'long', 'period', 'catholic', 'orphanage', 'only', 'sister', 'way', 'singer', 'seamstress', 'working', 'class', 'town', 'glimpsing', 'never', 'falling', 'prostitution', 'When', 'sister', 'up', 'Baron', 'Paris', 'who', 'vainly', 'will', 'marry', 'Gabrielle', 'up', 'estate', 'aristocrat', 'lover', 'met', 'cabaret', 'who', 'place', 'stay', 'help', 'entertain', 'friends', 'acute', 'observer', 'courageous', 'non-conformist', 'many', 'slights', 'verging', 'humiliation', 'including', 'poignant', 'scene', 'where', 'forced', 'use', 'dirty', 'napkin', 'head', 'butler', 'establish', 'place', 'herself.The', 'personal', 'struggle', 'Coco', 'called', 'stuff', 'great', 'stories', 'considering', 'marriage', 'option', 'not', 'idleness', 'chosen', 'milieu', 'instead', 'work', 'few', 'opportunities', 'are', 'available', 'while', 'educating', 'not', 'only', 'reading', 'also', 'critically', 'observing', 'style', 'behavior', 'milieu', 'personal', 'crisis', 'kind', 'depression', 'lover', 'businessman', 'who', 'chagrin', 'going', 'marry', 'heiress', 'Nonetheless', 'develop', 'fruitful', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'right', 'word', 'right', 'time', 'providing', 'crucial', 'support', 'comfort', 'friend', 'chateau', 'found', 'business', 'love', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'how', 'eventually', 'found', 'extremely', 'hard', 'work', 'wonder', 'admired', 'early', 'feminist', 'entering', 'domain', 'completely', 'dominated', 'men', 'forever', 'changing', 'have', 'interest', 'fashion', 'was', 'fascinated', 'details', 'creative', 'contribution', 'Stubbornly', 'rejecting', 'corsets', 'items', 'made', 'women', 'uncomfortable', 'revolutionized', 'haute', 'couture', 'virtually', 'single-handedly', 'simpler', 'clothes', 'often', 'inspired', 'working', 'class', 'practicality', 'displayed', 'film', 'explained', 'wonderful', 'extras', 'came', 'dvd.Warmly', 'recommended', 'not', 'classical', 'beauty', 'Chanel', 'was', 'not', 'Tautou', 'utterly', 'mesmerizing', 'role', 'way', 'full', 'period', 'texture', 'French', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'film', 'sentimentality']",N/A

I found the film to be rather dull and very boring. 90% of the film involved Chanel's affairs with two men Etiene Balsan and Arthur Capel and her feelings of alientation amongst those around her.  It was interesting to know  that it was Chanel's own un-conventional way of looking at clothes which has led to our current notion of 'chic'.While I do realize that the film involves her life before she became famous. It would have been nice to see more about her creative process and her rise as a business woman.

Tautou nails it; she portrays Chanel to perfection from her matter of fact and sensible approach to fashion, hats, men, and circumstance to her stubborn refusal to do things simply because they were ""what's done"". Coco Before Chanel is actually terribly tragic throughout; the phoenix may rise from the ashes but I did wonder what if she had had a ""happy ending""? Would her genius and singular design sensibility have ascended to even greater heights, or would have true happiness kept her too easily satisfied? I imagine it would not have - she was a personal perfectionist, and that comes across very much in Tautou's version of the fashion scion. She is just such a mercurial faced actress, looking plain for a moment or two, then flashing the most brilliant beauty our way.I especially loved the scenes where the young Coco (both as a child and very young woman) takes in the world around her - whether natural or man-made - and we are allowed a glimpse through her eyes of the decidedness of stripes on a garden tent, the lacey effect of windblown leaf shadows, or the odd geometric shapes of the French sisters' wimples.The supporting cast was excellent and the montage of Chanel runway designs in the final scene fabulous.",5,"Tr&eacute;s jolie, tr&eacute;s triste...",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,1314,"['Exquisite', 'cinematography', 'runaway', 'character', 'Tau-tou', 'de', 'force', 'Tautou', 'Chanel', 'perfection', 'matter', 'fact', 'sensible', 'approach', 'fashion', 'hats', 'men', 'circumstance', 'stubborn', 'refusal', 'do', 'things', 'simply', 'were', 'what', 'done', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'actually', 'terribly', 'tragic', 'phoenix', 'may', 'rise', 'ashes', 'did', 'wonder', 'what', 'had', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'Would', 'genius', 'singular', 'design', 'sensibility', 'have', 'ascended', 'even', 'greater', 'heights', 'would', 'have', 'true', 'happiness', 'kept', 'too', 'easily', 'satisfied', 'imagine', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'was', 'personal', 'perfectionist', 'across', 'very', 'much', 'Tautou', 'version', 'fashion', 'scion', 'just', 'such', 'mercurial', 'faced', 'actress', 'looking', 'plain', 'moment', 'two', 'then', 'flashing', 'most', 'brilliant', 'beauty', 'way.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'scenes', 'where', 'young', 'Coco', 'child', 'very', 'young', 'woman', 'world', 'natural', 'man-made', 'are', 'allowed', 'glimpse', 'eyes', 'decidedness', 'stripes', 'garden', 'tent', 'lacey', 'effect', 'windblown', 'leaf', 'shadows', 'odd', 'geometric', 'shapes', 'French', 'sisters', 'wimples.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'montage', 'Chanel', 'runway', 'designs', 'final', 'scene', 'fabulous']",N/A

There are elements of romance and some observations on how people use each other, but it's really about how a young woman chooses to be who she wants to be rather than who she's expected to be.The film opens in a music hall setting with Coco (Tautou) singing a duet with her sister. Wealthy men use the place as a hunting ground for mistresses or prostitutes. Coco befriends Etienne Balsan, who is much older than her, but offers her the chance to spend time with a higher social class. She mixes with his upper class friends and is at first ridiculed and described as a boy because of the clothes she wears. She doesn't buy into the trend of wearing traditional dresses, corsets, giant hats or clothes designed to show off her body. She chooses an almost masculine style that's very plain by comparison.She eventually gains a kind of acceptance and befriends an actress (Emmanuelle Devos) who takes her advice about what to wear.Coco is not content to spend her days subservient to the idle rich and wants to work. This is frowned upon by her snooty acquaintances, but she's determined to pursue her own course.The film shows how friendships can develop in unlikely situations and includes a romance between Coco and Boy (Nivola), who is genuinely touched by her.I guess that all sounds a bit girly, doesn't it? Well, like Coco, I follow my own path and like what I like.The highlight of the film is the performance of Audrey Tautou. I've been enchanted by her in a number of films such as Amelie, A Very Long Engagement, He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, The DaVinci Code and Dirty Pretty Things. She was the perfect choice for the part because she's somewhat similar to Coco in that she follows her own path. Not what most people consider attractive, but incredibly beautiful. Her face is capable of showing so much emotion. She can transition from pure joy to sorrow. If she had chosen to work in English-speaking roles, she would probably be a huge star with multiple awards. Again, she was the perfect choice for the role.The Blu-ray is in the native French and offers the choice to see the film with or without subtitles. The presentation is decent and really comes alive in the shots of the French countryside.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. It's not for those who need thrills or action in every scene. It moves slowly and is quite thought provoking. I found it fascinating and a surprisingly plausible account of Coco's early life.",4,Tautou shines as always,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,2787,"['Directed', 'Anne', 'FontaineStarring', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Benot', 'Poelvoorde', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola110', 'minutesFrench', 'language', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitlesVideo', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1Audio', 'French', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'optional', 'film', 'individuality', 'more', 'anything', 'are', 'elements', 'romance', 'observations', 'how', 'people', 'use', 'other', 'really', 'how', 'young', 'woman', 'be', 'who', 'be', 'rather', 'who', 'expected', 'be.The', 'film', 'opens', 'music', 'hall', 'setting', 'Coco', 'Tautou', 'singing', 'duet', 'sister', 'Wealthy', 'men', 'use', 'place', 'hunting', 'ground', 'mistresses', 'prostitutes', 'Coco', 'Etienne', 'Balsan', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'chance', 'spend', 'time', 'higher', 'social', 'class', 'mixes', 'upper', 'class', 'friends', 'first', 'ridiculed', 'described', 'boy', 'clothes', ""n't"", 'buy', 'trend', 'wearing', 'traditional', 'dresses', 'corsets', 'giant', 'hats', 'clothes', 'designed', 'show', 'off', 'body', 'almost', 'masculine', 'style', 'very', 'plain', 'comparison.She', 'eventually', 'gains', 'kind', 'acceptance', 'actress', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'who', 'advice', 'what', 'wear.Coco', 'not', 'content', 'spend', 'days', 'subservient', 'idle', 'rich', 'work', 'frowned', 'snooty', 'acquaintances', 'determined', 'pursue', 'own', 'course.The', 'film', 'how', 'friendships', 'can', 'develop', 'unlikely', 'situations', 'romance', 'Coco', 'Boy', 'Nivola', 'who', 'genuinely', 'touched', 'her.I', 'guess', 'bit', 'girly', ""n't"", 'Well', 'Coco', 'follow', 'own', 'path', 'what', 'like.The', 'highlight', 'film', 'performance', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enchanted', 'number', 'films', 'such', 'Amelie', 'A', 'Very', 'Long', 'Engagement', 'Me', 'Me', 'Not', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'part', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Coco', 'own', 'path', 'Not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'attractive', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'face', 'capable', 'showing', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'can', 'transition', 'pure', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'had', 'chosen', 'work', 'English-speaking', 'roles', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'huge', 'star', 'multiple', 'awards', 'Again', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role.The', 'Blu-ray', 'native', 'French', 'choice', 'see', 'film', 'subtitles', 'presentation', 'decent', 'really', 'alive', 'shots', 'French', 'countryside.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'not', 'who', 'need', 'thrills', 'action', 'scene', 'slowly', 'quite', 'thought', 'provoking', 'found', 'fascinating', 'surprisingly', 'plausible', 'account', 'Coco', 'early', 'life']",N/A
