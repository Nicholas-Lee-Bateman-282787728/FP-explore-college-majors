1655386,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B00DEKKEQI,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 0]","To Save a Life did it with today's teen issues. October Baby did it with abortion. This one has done it in a two-hit whammy: human trafficking and India's social caste system.When a spoiled rich kid wakes up after a hard night partying, he gets his eyes opened up to a world he never knew existed: human trafficking and modern slavery. This is a constant theme throughout, at first hinted at but then comes full in view. Granted, since it's an indie Christian movie, to get it rated PG-13, it had to have respectful camera angles, but the style of it is more like a documentary, revealing webs of connection between dealers and prospectors, heavy paranoia with each dealer, and the humane aspect of those searching for their loved ones to get them out and the strangers willing to put their lives on the line (eventually, after getting rid of their own pride).On the other hand, starting from a single line the secondary character says (""We're Dalits, we can't go in.""), it's also revealed that India still suffers from extreme inhumane practices today- the caste system. Dalits (Indianized word from the English ""delete"") getting harassed and persecuted for the most trivial reasons, made to believe they're literally less than human. In one scene, when a dealer makes a point that the secondary main character's a Dalit, the main character blows the concept out of the water with a monetary challenge. Beyond that, he really doesn't care about how the whole country treats Dalits, though he does get annoyed about the severity of which they get hurt.One of the most unique features of this film (besides the very end which shows a promotion for a ministry helping Dalit children get education, food, clothes, and other needed resources) was how they did the subtitles. Instead of the normal computerized fonts in white or yellow, they used kinetic typography (the same style used in music lyric videos), that was impressive. Even more so was how they used a different writing font for each specific character who spoke Indian, no matter if they were integral characters or only spoke a few words in the whole movie. Sometimes, the subtitles went the extra mile to be educable (such a the line about Dalits not being people? The word ""Dalit"" was shown above both father and daughter, a circle and line interposed above both ""Dalit"", that was uniquely creative for a movie). At a couple times, even when the main character, an American, spoke, he would say something so profound to the father that what he said was also typographized to make a clear point to the audience as well. If only more movies featuring a different language could be as creative with their subtitles.The only problem I had with this movie was how the main character's girlfriend and mother tended to sound preachy. Up to a certain point, they seemed to think that prayer had all the power to stop every bad thing until the point came when they had to actually physically help. Even as a Christian, I know that one cannot pray and think that's it. At times, one has to put their faith in action. Beyond that, I seriously recommend this.My rating: 4.5/5",5,Restarting Awareness,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3125,"['Save', 'Life', 'did', 'today', 'teen', 'issues', 'October', 'Baby', 'did', 'abortion', 'one', 'done', 'two-hit', 'whammy', 'human', 'trafficking', 'India', 'social', 'caste', 'system.When', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kid', 'up', 'hard', 'night', 'partying', 'eyes', 'opened', 'up', 'world', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'human', 'trafficking', 'modern', 'slavery', 'constant', 'theme', 'first', 'hinted', 'then', 'full', 'view', 'Granted', 'indie', 'Christian', 'movie', 'get', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'had', 'have', 'respectful', 'camera', 'angles', 'style', 'more', 'documentary', 'revealing', 'webs', 'connection', 'dealers', 'prospectors', 'heavy', 'paranoia', 'dealer', 'humane', 'aspect', 'searching', 'loved', 'ones', 'get', 'out', 'strangers', 'willing', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'eventually', 'getting', 'rid', 'own', 'pride', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'starting', 'single', 'line', 'secondary', 'character', ""'re"", 'Dalits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'also', 'revealed', 'India', 'still', 'extreme', 'inhumane', 'practices', 'today-', 'caste', 'system', 'Dalits', 'Indianized', 'word', 'English', 'delete', 'getting', 'harassed', 'persecuted', 'most', 'trivial', 'reasons', 'made', 'believe', ""'re"", 'literally', 'less', 'human', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'dealer', 'point', 'secondary', 'main', 'character', 'Dalit', 'main', 'character', 'concept', 'water', 'monetary', 'challenge', 'Beyond', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'whole', 'country', 'Dalits', 'get', 'annoyed', 'severity', 'get', 'hurt.One', 'most', 'unique', 'features', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'promotion', 'ministry', 'helping', 'Dalit', 'children', 'get', 'education', 'food', 'clothes', 'other', 'needed', 'resources', 'was', 'how', 'did', 'subtitles', 'Instead', 'normal', 'computerized', 'fonts', 'white', 'yellow', 'used', 'kinetic', 'typography', 'same', 'style', 'used', 'music', 'lyric', 'videos', 'was', 'impressive', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'how', 'used', 'different', 'writing', 'font', 'specific', 'character', 'who', 'spoke', 'Indian', 'matter', 'were', 'integral', 'characters', 'only', 'spoke', 'few', 'words', 'whole', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'subtitles', 'went', 'extra', 'mile', 'be', 'educable', 'such', 'line', 'Dalits', 'not', 'being', 'people', 'word', 'Dalit', 'was', 'shown', 'father', 'daughter', 'circle', 'line', 'interposed', 'Dalit', 'was', 'uniquely', 'creative', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'even', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'American', 'spoke', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'so', 'profound', 'father', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'also', 'typographized', 'make', 'clear', 'point', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'more', 'movies', 'featuring', 'different', 'language', 'could', 'be', 'creative', 'subtitles.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'tended', 'sound', 'preachy', 'certain', 'point', 'seemed', 'think', 'prayer', 'had', 'power', 'stop', 'bad', 'thing', 'point', 'came', 'when', 'had', 'actually', 'physically', 'help', 'Even', 'Christian', 'know', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'pray', 'think', 'times', 'one', 'put', 'faith', 'action', 'Beyond', 'seriously', 'recommend', 'this.My', 'rating', '4.5/5']",Not Today
