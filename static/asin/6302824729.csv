In my opinion, it isn't as great as the first one, but it has a wonderful element in it that makes it a great movie.  There is some incredible drama in this movie.The movie takes Mr. Miyagi and Daniel LaRusso to Okinawa where Mr. Miyagi faces three challenges:  The death of his father, Falling in love with his old sweetheart, and Sato, his old friend who has vowed revenge on Miyagi.I think some of the greatest drama I've seen takes place in this movie.  In the first movie Daniel turns to Miyagi for help in everything, but in this movie there is a scene right after Miyagi's father dies where Daniel is comforting Miyagi explaining what he went through when his father died.

And...that's about it. Now, for the negatives, there are several of them. In the beginning, the audience sees Martin Krove, the sensei of Cobra Kai, go bat crazy like that. Impossible; it's just a stupid, silly, and meaningless tournament. It's too cartoonish for me to believe. Later, there is this guy who has a decades long feud with Miyagi which is about honor. Forgive me, but I am really bored whenever I hear the word ""honor."" That is what killed the film for me. If a boy messes up at age of 17 by doing drugs, is that a stain on the honor even though that is the only bad incident in his life? What if he went on to do great things? And who is going to remember or care about whatever the stupid things he did twenty or thirty years ago? Time makes people more forgettable. It was hard for me to take the plot of The Karate Kid Part II seriously. Finally, there is the Japanese (I am sorry, it is an Okiwanan) female developing a relationship with Danielle. It's almost like an American invading the country and poisoning her mind. No wonder he had to insult her by asking if she was...arranged. Oh yes...I look at Chozen and his body, and I look at Danielle and his body. The experience of the two cannot be ignored yet Chozen comes off as a loser against him. Yeah, the next thing it will happen is that Danielle will defeat Bruce Lee in a match if he was alive. None of the interactions between Miyagi and the people of the villagers is shown.

339900,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302824729,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","I thought the 1st ""Karate Kid"" was excellent, and I think II is an EXCELLENT followup. In Part 1, we learned about Daniel and his situation. 2 takes it to the next level. After meet Daniel, we soon learn more about Myagi. (To the next level!) Myagi learns that his father (still in Japan) is very ill. While this is hard enough of a trip to make, Myagi realizes that he also has to risk running into an old friend who has an unresolved dispute with him. (Great expansion of myagi's past!)Daniel of course feels that it is his duty to go with Myagi and be there for Myagi as Myagi was there for him in Part 1. (Great growth from Daniel!) Daniel and Myagi arrive in Japan. The photography there is beautiful!I may add that in Part 1, Daniel learned karate. Now he is learning culture. (Better still!) Myagi runs into his enemy (once friend) Sato. Naturally, the tensions arise. Sato wants to fight Myagi over a conflict that happened many years ago that put his honor into question. Myagi would rather let bygones be bygones. Despite Sato's coldness and brutality, we never forget that he has some redeeming points. And we are probably hoping that these 2 will reconcile, rather than fight.Sato's # 1 student Chozen persues Daniel in hopes of forcing Myagi to fight Sato. While Daniel triumphed over the Cobra Kais in Part 1, Chozen proves himself to be a notably worse threat. The Cobra Kais were nasty people, but they weren't willing to kill Daniel. Chozen is. (Nice rise of tension!) I may also add that Chozen would trash Johnny, Kreese, Terry Silver, Mike Barnes, or Colonel Dugan.If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it. But I can say that the 'unseen hand' comes in and makes some reconciliation possible. Daniel also goes from fighting in a tournamentto a battle where the stakes are life and death.I call this sequel phenomenal, because not only does it avoid repeating part 1, it takes things to the next level and provides interesting new surprises.",5,A Phenomenal Followup,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,2006,"['thought', '1st', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'was', 'excellent', 'think', 'II', 'EXCELLENT', 'followup', 'Part', '1', 'learned', 'Daniel', 'situation', '2', 'next', 'level', 'meet', 'Daniel', 'soon', 'learn', 'more', 'Myagi', 'next', 'level', 'Myagi', 'father', 'still', 'Japan', 'very', 'ill', 'hard', 'enough', 'trip', 'make', 'Myagi', 'also', 'risk', 'running', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'unresolved', 'dispute', 'Great', 'expansion', 'myagi', 'past', 'Daniel', 'course', 'feels', 'duty', 'go', 'Myagi', 'be', 'there', 'Myagi', 'Myagi', 'was', 'Part', '1', 'Great', 'growth', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'Myagi', 'arrive', 'Japan', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'may', 'add', 'Part', '1', 'Daniel', 'learned', 'karate', 'Now', 'learning', 'culture', 'Better', 'still', 'Myagi', 'enemy', 'once', 'friend', 'Sato', 'Naturally', 'tensions', 'arise', 'Sato', 'fight', 'Myagi', 'conflict', 'happened', 'many', 'years', 'put', 'honor', 'question', 'Myagi', 'would', 'rather', 'let', 'bygones', 'be', 'bygones', 'Sato', 'coldness', 'brutality', 'never', 'forget', 'redeeming', 'points', 'are', 'probably', 'hoping', '2', 'will', 'reconcile', 'rather', 'fight.Sato', '1', 'student', 'Chozen', 'persues', 'Daniel', 'hopes', 'forcing', 'Myagi', 'fight', 'Sato', 'Daniel', 'triumphed', 'Cobra', 'Kais', 'Part', '1', 'Chozen', 'be', 'notably', 'worse', 'threat', 'Cobra', 'Kais', 'were', 'nasty', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'kill', 'Daniel', 'Chozen', 'Nice', 'rise', 'tension', 'may', 'also', 'add', 'Chozen', 'would', 'trash', 'Johnny', 'Kreese', 'Terry', 'Silver', 'Mike', 'Barnes', 'Colonel', 'Dugan.If', 'say', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'can', 'say', ""'unseen"", 'hand', 'reconciliation', 'possible', 'Daniel', 'also', 'fighting', 'tournamentto', 'battle', 'where', 'stakes', 'are', 'life', 'death.I', 'call', 'sequel', 'phenomenal', 'not', 'only', 'avoid', 'repeating', 'part', '1', 'things', 'next', 'level', 'interesting', 'new', 'surprises']",N/A

339904,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302824729,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","There was no doubt that the coming-of-age film ""The Karate Kid"" which made over $90 million in the box office would earn itself a sequel.  Two years later, director John G Avildsen (""Rocky"", ""Lean on Me"", ""Inferno"") and writer Robert Mark Kamen (""Gladiator"", ""Taps"", ""Lethal Weapon 3', ""The Fifth Element"") would reunite once again with composers Bill Conti, cinematographer James Crabe and cast members Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio for ""The Karate Kid, Part II"".The film did much better than its predecessor in the box office making over $245 million worldwide and the theme song ""Glory of Love"" by Peter Cetera would receive the #1 song in the U.S. as well as earn an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Song"".With the 2010 remake of ""The Karate Kid"" starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, what best to reacquaint audiences of the first two films (the third and fourth films were panned) which makes its HD debut on Blu-ray with a special ""Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition"", the Blu-ray release of the film will also be sold separately.VIDEO:""The Karate Kid, Part II"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Similar to the first film, I was able to watch the original DVD release before watching it on Blu-ray.  And like the first film, on DVD the film looked its age.  But I can easily say that this film looks much, much better on Blu-ray.  The film was shot in Hawaii and for the most part, the leaves, trees, rocks and the overall surroundings have much better detail than the DVD which looked a bit blurry and had a significant amount of digital noise reduction.You can easily make out the leaves and trees, even one scene in which Miyagi and Yukie are sitting down and seeing the river flow near the home was such a beautiful shot and almost looked like a film that was just shot recently.  So, there are some amazing shots in the film and the set design in creating the castle area and the overall village really showed the determination of cinematographer Bill Conti and production designer William J. Cassidy in making the Hawaii area look and feel like Okinawa.Like the first film, there is a good amount of grain and also blacks are nice and deep.  I saw no signs of artifacts, blemishes or any problems with the film.  ""The Karate Kid, Part II"" definitely looks great for a film that is nearly 25-years-old and way better than its DVD counterpart.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Karate Kid"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And like the first film, ""The Karate Kid, Part II"" is dialogue driven.  But like the first film, there is a good amount of surround use.  From the storm that hits the village and hearing the thunder, to hearing the ambiance of the village especially when Sato's people using their bulldozer to tear up the farming area in front of Miyagi's home.  You can also hear the birds, the military jet flying overhead and more. And similar to the first film which featured the crowd's gasps during the martial arts tournament, we hear the crowd reacting to the final battle of the film.Also, a good presence of music from composer Bill Conti and of course, Peter Cetera's ""Glory of Love"".  But overall, the lossless soundtrack for this film is very good and definitely breathes new life for this film and again, much better over its DVD counterpart.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Karate Kid, Part II"" comes with the following special features (presented in standard definition):* Blu-Pop (TM): Activate the exclusive Blu-pop feature to reveal pop up trivia, interviews and more secrets from the film!* The Sequel - (6:18) Producer Jerry Weintraub, director John G. Avildsen and writer Robert Mark Kamen along with the cast, discuss the making of ""The Karate Kid, Part II"".EXTRAS:""The Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition"" comes with a cardboard slipcase which contains both Karate Kid films on Blu-ray.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Karate Kid"" was a film that I called inspirational and enjoyable, ""The Karate Kid, Part II"" was a film which I enjoyed a lot and at the time, I enjoyed much more than its predecessor.  I felt the film added a new emotional dimension for its characters and the relationship between Miyagi and Daniel, also the beauty of the village and the location definitely enhanced the film.  Once again, Pat Morita does a fantastic job and this time to see the character pushed to the limit.I was very impressed by Pat Morita's performance and singing in Japanese and just making his character seem so realistic and making us believe in that character.  Miyagi has quite a few action scenes and this is not bad for an actor who was born in California, let alone a man who was born with spinal tuberculosis and was not expected to walk earlier in his life.The character of Daniel LaRusso was also played quite well by Ralph Macchio. There was no major American machismo in the film and if anything, more of a naivete as he tries to understand the customs and the ways in Okinawa.  It is known that there has been this tension between America's occupation in Okinawa and Robert Mark Kamen made sure there were lines that existed in the film especially when Daniel and Miyagi were talking about the war and the lives lost.  Especially in the beginning of the film about how peaceful the village was until the military base was created.  These issues continue to exist between American and Okinawa relationships.Macchio's chemistry with actress Tamlyn Tomita worked quite well onscreen and similar to Elisabeth Shue, the film helped Tomita in achieving roles in ""Santa Barbra"" and most notable ""The Joy Luck Club"" years later.But ""The Karate Kid, Part II"" was a film that I thought was much better then but watching it now, it was quite banal and aside from the performances of Pat Morita, watching it now, I'm not sure if the enjoyment was more for the fact that I thought the film was shot in Okinawa (when actually it was in Hawaii) or I felt that the major battle in the film was extraordinary at a young age.  But it was an enjoyable film especially to watch it again over 20-years later but my appreciation towards the film has waned a bit since then.But I can easily remember Peter Cetera's ""Glory of Love"" being played on the radio over and over and seeing the video clip on MTV, needless to say, the second film had more marketing and hype to make it this major box office hit nearly tripling the box office return of the fim.I suppose in terms of the buildup of wanting to see Daniel beat the Cobra-kai's in the first film was inspiring and you were rooting for the character, ""The Karate Kid, Part II"" was more of a film where you wondered how does Daniel even fit into this equation when the film deals primarily with Miyagi.  But the film does work itself out and overall, it was good film but overall, watching the two Karate Kid films again, I appreciated the original film much more today.John G. Avildsen and Robert Mark Kamen were able to create two enjoyable films but similar to the ""Superman"" films, everything past the second film seemed to go downhill and thus, I can see why Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has focused on the first two films on Blu-ray.And if you enjoyed the two Karate Kid films, there is no doubt in my mind you will want to purchase this on Blu-ray.  Comparing it to the 2005 DVD's, not only does the film look much better but it also sounds much better and the lossless audio makes your viewing are come alive as the surround channels really do utilize the crowd scenes during the end of both films.Overall, two enjoyable films and if you enjoyed ""The Karate Kid, Part II"",  more than likely you enjoyed the first.  So, I definitely recommended ""The Karate Kid I & II Collector's Edition""!  Definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: An enjoyable film which I actually enjoyed more back then, but now...",1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,7748,"['was', 'doubt', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'Karate',

Returning actors Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita are allowed to go even deeper into their respective characters, and the result is a very rich screenplay which gives as much or more weight to Mr. Morita's Miyagi as it does to Mr. Macchio's Daniel Larusso.The film focuses on a trip to Okinawa for Daniel and Miyagi which serves as a pilgrimmage for Miyagi to visit his dying father, mentioned briefly but memorably in the first movie.  Additionally, Miyagi rekindles an old romance which had been ended by a covetous blood feud also involving Miyagi's best childhood friend that was his original reason for leaving his native country.  Daniel, in turn, falls in love with the older woman's beautiful young niece Kumiko, played by Tamlyn Tomita(currently seen on NBC TV's ""Heroes"" in a recurring role as Hiro Nakamura's mother).  In so doing, he incurs the wrath of a vengeful young martial arts expert named Chozen, who covets Kumiko for himself.Also featuring beautiful outdoor scenery, a great soundtrack and a tense script which realistically depicts long-simmering hatreds as well as many variations of respect and love, ""The Karate Kid Part II"" is a brilliant sequel and movie that should officially be accorded the classic status it deserves.",5,"One of the very best movie sequels, and a worthy story",1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,1376,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'big', 'exception', 'rule', 'regarding', 'mediocre', 'sequels', 'outstanding', 'original', 'movies', 'Returning', 'actors', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'are', 'allowed', 'go', 'even', 'deeper', 'respective', 'characters', 'result', 'very', 'rich', 'screenplay', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'weight', 'Mr.', 'Morita', 'Miyagi', 'Mr.', 'Macchio', 'Daniel', 'Larusso.The', 'film', 'trip', 'Okinawa', 'Daniel', 'Miyagi', 'pilgrimmage', 'Miyagi', 'visit', 'dying', 'father', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'memorably', 'first', 'movie', 'Additionally', 'Miyagi', 'old', 'romance', 'had', 'been', 'ended', 'covetous', 'blood', 'feud', 'also', 'involving', 'Miyagi', 'best', 'childhood', 'friend', 'was', 'original', 'reason', 'leaving', 'native', 'country', 'Daniel', 'turn', 'love', 'older', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'young', 'niece', 'Kumiko', 'played', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'currently', 'seen', 'NBC', 'TV', 'Heroes', 'recurring', 'role', 'Hiro', 'Nakamura', 'mother', 'so', 'doing', 'wrath', 'vengeful', 'young', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'named', 'Chozen', 'who', 'Kumiko', 'himself.Also', 'featuring', 'beautiful', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'tense', 'script', 'realistically', 'long-simmering', 'hatreds', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'variations', 'respect', 'love', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'brilliant', 'sequel', 'movie', 'should', 'officially', 'be', 'accorded', 'classic', 'status']",N/A

Mr. Miyagi (Morita) gets a letter from Okinawa informing him that his father is dying.  He knows this is a potentially deadly situation because of an old grudge with his former best friend Sato.  Nonetheless, Miyagi let's the recently dumped Daniel-San (it was only a matter of time before Elisabeth Shue realized she was dating a sissy) come along for the trip.Upon arriving in Okinawa, Miyagi soon realizes that he has very little time.  Not only will his father die very soon, but his former best friend Sato - who incidentally has a watermelon for a head - wants to fight him to the death.  It turns out that Miyagi left his homeland eons ago because both he and Sato liked the same girl, Yuki.  Rather than fighting for her, Miyagi took the pacifist route and left the country.  In Sato's eyes this was disgraceful, and an insult to his honor.  Sato has held the grudge ever since, and has used that anger to fuel his drive - he owns everything from the construction company to the brothel.  For some reason, however, he was never able to convince Yuki to be with him...or work at the brothel.Meanwhile, Daniel-San is still a whiner who gets bullied by anyone with a pulse.  In this case, he gets bullied by Chosun, Sato's best student.  Chosun is a vicious, callous karate expert with a 18-inch waist, who manages to oversee illegal gambling schemes in his spare time.  He's ten-times the goon that Johnny from KKI was.  I am convinced the main reason Chosun despises Daniel-San is the fact that Daniel-San is nearly in the panties of Kumiko (Tamlyn Tomita), a town cutie, before he's even been there a week..All of this sets up the final battle scenes, where Miyagi faces Sato in a bizarre twist of fate, and Daniel-San must face Chosun.  This is where I have a problem.  While I especially appreciated how the preposterously telegraphed ""Crane Technique"" was so easily dispatched by Chosun - yet another lead villian who would murder Daniel-San in real life - I was quickly disappointed to see that the new finishing move was even more ridiculous, and Chosun loses his honor as he transforms from a guy who simultaneously beat up 5 soldiers into a complete moron who can't see, duck, dodge, or block any of the 47 consecutive punches Daniel-San applies to his face.  This is incredibly difficult to digest, especially considering the ease with which Chosun pummelled Daniel-San in every previous encounter, making him look like a spineless toddler in many instances.Nevertheless, this movie is a classic, and we get to cheer Daniel-San's scrawny carcass onto yet another victory.",5,YOUR FEAR MAKE AIR STINK!,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2752,"['Following', 'Daniel-San', 'Macchio', 'triumphant', 'incredibly', 'improbable', 'victory', 'All', 'Valley', '18', 'Karate', 'Tournament', 'little', 'time', 'celebrate', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Morita', 'letter', 'Okinawa', 'informing', 'father', 'dying', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'situation', 'old', 'grudge', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Sato', 'Nonetheless', 'Miyagi', 'let', 'recently', 'dumped', 'Daniel-San', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'realized', 'was', 'dating', 'sissy', 'come', 'trip.Upon', 'arriving', 'Okinawa', 'Miyagi', 'soon', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'father', 'die', 'very', 'soon', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Sato', 'who', 'incidentally', 'watermelon', 'head', 'fight', 'death', 'out', 'Miyagi', 'left', 'homeland', 'eons', 'ago', 'Sato', 'liked', 'same', 'girl', 'Yuki', 'Rather', 'fighting', 'Miyagi', 'took', 'pacifist', 'route', 'left', 'country', 'Sato', 'eyes', 'was', 'disgraceful', 'insult', 'honor', 'Sato', 'held', 'grudge', 'ever', 'used', 'anger', 'fuel', 'drive', 'everything', 'construction', 'company', 'brothel', 'reason', 'however', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'convince', 'Yuki', 'be', 'work', 'brothel.Meanwhile', 'Daniel-San', 'still', 'whiner', 'who', 'bullied', 'anyone', 'pulse', 'case', 'bullied', 'Chosun', 'Sato', 'best', 'student', 'Chosun', 'vicious', 'callous', 'karate', 'expert', '18-inch', 'waist', 'who', 'oversee', 'illegal', 'gambling', 'schemes', 'spare', 'time', 'ten-times', 'goon', 'Johnny', 'KKI', 'was', 'am', 'convinced', 'main', 'reason', 'Chosun', 'Daniel-San', 'fact', 'Daniel-San', 'nearly', 'panties', 'Kumiko', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'town', 'cutie', 'even', 'been', 'week..All', 'up', 'final', 'battle', 'scenes', 'where', 'Miyagi', 'Sato', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'fate', 'Daniel-San', 'must', 'face', 'Chosun', 'where', 'have', 'problem', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'how', 'preposterously', 'telegraphed', 'Crane', 'Technique', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'dispatched', 'Chosun', 'yet', 'lead', 'villian', 'who', 'would', 'murder', 'Daniel-San', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'quickly', 'disappointed', 'see', 'new', 'finishing', 'move', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'Chosun', 'honor', 'guy', 'who', 'simultaneously', 'beat', 'up', '5', 'soldiers', 'complete', 'moron', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'duck', 'dodge', 'block', '47', 'consecutive', 'punches', 'Daniel-San', 'applies', 'face', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'digest', 'especially', 'considering', 'ease', 'Chosun', 'pummelled', 'Daniel-San', 'previous', 'encounter', 'making', 'look', 'spineless', 'toddler', 'many', 'instances.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'classic', 'get', 'cheer', 'Daniel-San', 'scrawny', 'carcass', 'onto', 'yet', 'victory']",N/A
339913,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,6302824729,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[34, 36]","The first Karate Kid literally spoke to any kid who felt out of place and picked on. Strongly enough, it was a concept played out over and over again. But the evenhanded direction of Avildsen made it a triumph. So what do you do for a sequel? You get real. Not that the first one wasn't real. The threat to Daniels safety in the first movie was always there and fully realized. But take this student and mentor pair and send them to Okinawa, and you have a whole different ball game. The story centers more on Miagi and his journey home to see his dying father, and facing demons he left as a young man. Asian culture takes certain things much more seriously. Honor in this movie is a subject brought up constantly, and we see it from Daniels perspective; as an American who does not understand why these people do things they way they do in the name of honor. As Daniel comes to grips with this life code in the small village of Miagi's youth, he realizes that the bully who has targeted him this time does not hold back. He's ready to kill Daniel. He has no qualms about it either and feels it's justified. As Daniel swoons a beautiful Asian girl and finds he's getting in deeper with the affairs of Miagi's past, he holds his ground, and his good upbringing helps to hold his own honor in place. In the end, the climatic fight scene is what really makes the movie. The whole story builds up to that moment. The idea is that this fight is real, there is no competition, no points. This is not a tournament, this is not a spectacle. Daniel is fighting to stay alive. And it is more brutal then the rules laden tournament of the first movie. Morita and Maccio play off each other so well it's obvious these two have great chemistry. The teacher/student relationship is apparent from the first scene despite their polar opposite personalities. As in the first movie, each character gives the other what they are missing. Daniel gets a father figure/teacher, Miagi gets a son/student. This movie is just as good as the first in my opinion, just different.

All about real issues that a teenager can relate too: moving, deceased loved one, relationships, getting picked on, rising up to bullies, being mentored by older person, etc...All very real stuff. It feels like it fits in with all the other classic 80s films. The only thing unrealistic is the fact that Daniel masters the art of karate in about 4 weeks.Then they made KK2, and I was like ""WTF"". The basis for the movie should have been that Daniel and Ally were still together, all of the old Cobra Kai members are now Daniel's friends and train with Mr. Myuigi, and Kreese is out for revenge. It would have shown the rewards of Daniel doing the right thing in the first film, and motivate young people to keep doing the right thing despite oppostion.But No. Instead Ally, the deap, complex, real character from the first film gets reduced to a dumb bimbo blonde in exactly one line at the begining of the second film, and then they put Daniel in a bunch of situations that NO teenager can relate too.I highly doubt that any young person has walked away from watching this movie thinking ""Boy I sure am glad that I have so much in common with Daniel. After all, I too have traveled to a different country with my only friend in life, who ironically is a 70 year old man from Japan, somehow became the key piece right in the middle of a political conflict involving a small town, have had a psychopath threaten to kill me, who coincidentally was the nephew of the psychopath trying to kill my one-and-only 70 year old best friend, and infact fought this psycho in front of a huge crowd at a Japanese Celebration as he tried to kill me. Wow I never knew we had so much in common!""The music is over-the-top big time in this film. It sounds like you are watching an episode of the ""Young and the Restless"", with how dramatic the music is trying to be, and it is constantly playing through out the movie.Also, most of the film is about Danielle and Meeskwogee getting harrased by Sato's hired goons, Jozen and the gang, trying to get Mr.Meyaagee to fight.

339916,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,6302824729,"John ""MovieAddict""","[2, 17]","When John G. Avildsen's &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; was a smash hit, the fact that a sequel would be made was inevitable. Perhaps even a trilogy would form. A totally unnecessary trilogy, but a trilogy nevertheless. Well, there were three sequels made - &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; &quot;The Karate Kid, Part III,&quot; and &quot;The Next Karate Kid,&quot; each installment worse than the last entry.The point of the first movie was stressed clearly without becoming too overbearing. Violence is wrong. Right, right, right - we've heard it before. Of course, self-defense is fine when used correctly, but nonsensical violence is criminally and morally wrong.That's sort of forgotten in &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; which stumbles along and runs into major problems. One, the script - it's weak. Two, the acting - it's stiff. Three, the actual story and scenes within the film - all idiotic. Take, for example, the end of the film, when a Chinese girl is performing some ancient dance and a disowned martial arts expert swings from the top of the stadium down a cable, landing next to the girl and holding a knife to her throat. &quot;Behind you!&quot; Daniel (Ralph Macchio) yells helplessly as he jumps into the sand pit before him and proceeds to battle the martial artist. (Is that a word? And what's the difference between martial arts and karate? Never mind, don't answer that.)No one offers any sort of help as Daniel is beaten to a bloody pulp. None whatsoever. They just sit around and watch with fixated smiles on their faces, forgetting that their characters call for them to be scared and not to be happy that they are getting not even fifteen minutes of fame out of the deal.A small complaint? Perhaps, but pretty much all of the film contains these children's fantasy ideas that a boy such as Daniel may dream of during his sleep. In fact, perhaps this sequel is all one big hallucination - perhaps Daniel, after a tough karate match, was knocked out. He's laying in a hospital, dazed and confused, unconscious and lost in a deadly coma. It's the easiest way to create a half-baked sequel, so pay attention, scriptwriters.Daniel has gone back to Mr. Miyagi's (&quot;Pat&quot; Morita) country of origin, China, and now he's getting into fights with an old adversary of Mr. Miyagi. There's not much more to tell you than that - unless, of course, you would like to know that the mandatory girlfriend appears for Daniel (a Chinese chick, of course), and that the adversary's niece is Daniel's foe.Great stuff.Not.I really liked the first &quot;Karate Kid&quot; movie, but this is pushing it. The third film was absolutely appalling, the fourth a total mess. The second is below average and quite mediocre. I'd call it an uncredited rip-off of &quot;Rocky&quot; if not for the fact that the director of the film, John G. Avildsen, happens to be the director of &quot;Rocky,&quot; among other films. His expertises are these underdog flicks. Unfortunately, despite having a strong predecessor and possible character developments in store, &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; offers nothing new to the series. And, needless to say, either will the following two sequels.Ralph Macchio is fine, Pat Morita is still the same, but the film is too goofy and unreal to appreciate. It's a weak example of filmmaking. It's not even that fun to watch - whereas the first film sort of had the viewer attached to the screen, this one makes you want to walk away and not pay attention to it at all.Perhaps the only positive thing to say about this movie is that it is the best of the sequels. But that's really not saying very much at all, is it?",2,And so the series' digression starts....,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,3658,"['When', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'was', 'smash', 'hit', 'fact', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'trilogy', 'would', 'form', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'trilogy', 'trilogy', 'nevertheless', 'Well', 'were', 'three', 'sequels', 'made', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'quot', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'III', 'quot', 'quot', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'installment', 'worse', 'last', 'entry.The', 'point', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'stressed', 'clearly', 'becoming', 'too', 'overbearing', 'Violence', 'wrong', 'Right', 'right', 'right', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'course', 'self-defense', 'fine', 'when', 'used', 'correctly', 'nonsensical', 'violence', 'criminally', 'morally', 'wrong.That', 'sort', 'forgotten', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'quot', 'along', 'major', 'problems', 'One', 'script', 'weak', 'Two', 'acting', 'stiff', 'Three', 'actual', 'story', 'scenes', 'film', 'idiotic', 'Take', 'example', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'performing', 'ancient', 'dance', 'disowned', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'swings', 'top', 'stadium', 'down', 'cable', 'landing', 'next', 'girl', 'holding', 'knife', 'throat', 'quot', 'quot', 'Daniel', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'helplessly', 'sand', 'pit', 'proceeds', 'battle', 'martial', 'artist', 'word', 'what', 'difference', 'martial', 'arts', 'karate', 'Never', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'one', 'sort', 'help', 'Daniel', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'None', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'watch', 'fixated', 'smiles', 'forgetting', 'characters', 'call', 'be', 'scared', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'are', 'getting', 'not', 'even', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'deal.A', 'small', 'complaint', 'Perhaps', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'children', 'fantasy', 'ideas', 'boy', 'such', 'Daniel', 'may', 'dream', 'sleep', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'sequel', 'one', 'big', 'hallucination', 'perhaps', 'Daniel', 'tough', 'karate', 'match', 'was', 'knocked', 'out', 'laying', 'hospital', 'dazed', 'confused', 'unconscious', 'lost', 'deadly', 'coma', 'easiest', 'way', 'create', 'half-baked', 'sequel', 'so', 'pay', 'attention', 'scriptwriters.Daniel', 'gone', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'quot', 'Pat', 'quot', 'Morita', 'country', 'origin', 'China', 'now', 'getting', 'fights', 'old', 'adversary', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'tell', 'course', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'mandatory', 'girlfriend', 'Daniel', 'Chinese', 'chick', 'course', 'adversary', 'niece', 'Daniel', 'foe.Great', 'stuff.Not.I', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'movie', 'pushing', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'appalling', 'fourth', 'total', 'mess', 'second', 'below', 'average', 'quite', 'mediocre', ""'d"", 'call', 'uncredited', 'rip-off', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'not', 'fact', 'director', 'film', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'be', 'director', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'other', 'films', 'expertises', 'are', 'underdog', 'flicks', 'Unfortunately', 'having', 'strong', 'predecessor', 'possible', 'character', 'developments', 'store', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'quot', 'nothing', 'new', 'series', 'needless', 'say', 'either', 'will', 'following', 'two', 'sequels.Ralph', 'Macchio', 'fine', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'still', 'same', 'film', 'too', 'goofy', 'unreal', 'appreciate', 'weak', 'example', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'even', 'fun', 'watch', 'first', 'film', 'sort', 'had', 'viewer', 'attached', 'screen', 'one', 'want', 'walk', 'away', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'say', 'movie', 'best', 'sequels', 'really', 'not', 'saying', 'very', 'much']",N/A
339917,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6302824729,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[1, 1]","I'm going to review the 2nd Karate Kid movies Karate Kid II which is my favorite out of all 5 KK films 1&2 make a awesome double feature. Karate Kid II is underated imo. Released in 1986 directed by John G Avildsen. Pat Morita & Ralph Macchio return you also have Martin Kove in here for a small role. It also stars Tamlyn Tomita as Kumiko, Danny Kamelkona as Saito, Yuji Okumoto as Chozen, & Nobie McCarthy as Yukie. Story picks up after the 1st movie. You see Kreese is po'd that Johnny didn't win the tournament he breaks his 2nd Place Trophy & starts hitting him. Miyagi stops him Kreese wants to fight Miyagi he goes for a punch Miyagi moves out of the way & his fist goes through a windshield & tries to punch him again & the same thing happens you think Miyagi is going for the death blow but tweaks his nose & says HONK! 6 months later his Girlfriend Ali broke up with him Daniel's mom got a job in Fresno so he will live with Mr Miyagi. Miyagi gets a letter from Okinawa about his father dying he wants to see him 1 last time. Miyagi left Okinawa when he was 18 he loved a woman named Yukie who had an arranged marriage with Miyagi's friend Saito. 1 day Miyagi announced his love for her & he wanted to marry her in front of the whole town Saito felt betrayed & challenged him to a fight to the death. He left Okinawa rather than fight his friend. Daniel goes with him & when they arrive in Okinawa they are met by Chozen who is Saito's Nephew they are taken to a building where Saito shows up & hasn't forgiven him he still wants to fight him & he thinks that Miyagi is a coward. After WW II Saito took the village over & because an Industrial Business  Man. He took over the fishing population that was income for the villagers. They had to turn to farming. When Miyagi & Daniel come to the village their greeted by Yukie & her  Niece Kumiko. Yukie tells Miyagi that she never married Saito or at all. Miyagi's Father's dying wish is for his son & student to make peace but Saito tells Miyagi he has 3 days to mourn then they fight. Daniel reveals that Chozen's grocery business is a scam & that p  i  s  s  es  him off he & his henchies constantly stalks Daniel & Kumiko they have a few scuffles. You have a relationship with Daniel & Kumiko she shows him the old castle where The O Bon Festival used to be held before Saito takes over. They go into town & Miyagi & Yukie happen to there too. Good scene in the bar with Daniel breaking the sheets of ice.Saito threatens to tear down the village & redevelop  if Miyagi doesn't fight him which he agree's to. Before the fight is to take place a Typoon hits Okinawa & hit The Shack where Saito was preparing. Miyagi & Daniel help Saito & he forgives him. Daniel goes to help this girl stuck in The Bell Tower Saito tells Chozen to help he doesn't & in a moment of anger he tells Chozen ""You are dead to me!"" Chozen runs off. The next morning Saito & a bunch of workers show up to rebuild the village he allows The O Bon Festival to be held in castle again. During The O Bon Festival Kumiko is perfoming a dance Chozen decides to crash The Festival he wants to kill Daniel he is going down the same road as Saito. If Daniel doesn't fight him he will kill Kumiko. He agrees to it. The fight is better than the fight with Johnny in part 1. It's more physical & it's a fight to the death. He tries The Crane Kick doesn't work but uses a new technique called The Drum Technique.  He beats Chozen & says ""Live or die man!?"" Chozen says ""Die!"" Daniel tweaks the nose says honk cheesy yes but it works. The Glory Of Love by Peter Catera is great. John G Avildsen did a great job. Pat Morita was good again. Ralph Macchio was good again he had more to do. Tamlyn Tomita was good I liked her better than Elisabeth Shue as the love interest. Yujo Okumoto was good I liked him more than William Zabka & he's definitely better than that s  h  i  tt  y  p  i  ss  an t  soap  o  p  er  a actor in KK III. Nobu McCarthy was good. Danny Kamelkona wasn't bad & I bought that he was sorry. I know I did a bad job going through the plot. Next will be the worst sequel ever.

So much for true love.

Millions were waiting for the continuing exploits of Daniel and Mr. Miyagi, and filmmakers were only too happy to oblige with a sequel that continued many of the themes of the first movie, while introducing many more.  What they created was a beautiful film, rich in character and nuance, with tears, laughs, and classic lines galore.  They created something special that would stand the test of time.Then they did the motion picture equivalent of wadding up the sheet of paper and throwing it in the garbage.I'm speaking, as you've no doubt guessed by now, of their decision to add the Traitor Cetera ballad ""Glory of Love"" as the movie's theme song.  Why the filmmakers chose to go this route instead of asking the still-powerful Chicago to contribute is a question that I have spent many hours puzzling over; I'm sure many of the series' fans have as well.  Either way, Cetera's song stands as a blatant attempt to recall his earlier, better, iconic work with Chicago.  It's as if he spends the entire song apologizing for making the worst decision in rock music hstory.  Frankly, the tune's grandstanding mediocreness casts such a pall over the movie that it never sufficiently recovers.  I've only watched it once since I saw it in the theater.Anyway, what might have been a classic became a footnote in the grand history of the ""Karate Kid"" series.  I'll always mourn what might have been with ""Karate Kid II"" - but I'll never let Cetera ruin the grand rush of joy I get from the original film, part III, and ""Next"".Hey, Columbia/Tristar!

Really, Sato has a problem with Miyagi,over an old girlfriend. Daniel ends up having a problem of hisown with Sato's nephew, Chozen.

The plot is rather interesting, and I'm glad some Japanese culture (which I find fascinating) got put into the story. One of the best things I liked was seeing how Daniel grew since the first one, and it was obvious he has done so quite a bit. He is now a more competent fighter, able to stand up against Chozen who is the number one student of Mr. Miyagi's rival Sato, and is even more knowledgeable concerning karate principles in general.The fight scenes are not overly impressive, but they're pretty fun to watch nonetheless. I must admit that this movie is what got me interested in karate, which I study more in principle rather than actual fighting, at least currently.The only thing I was a bit annoyed by was nearly everyone in Okinawa, Japan speaking English to Daniel and especially each other. I get that it was a creative decision because it would be tedious for Mr. Miyagi or even Kumiko (Daniel's love interest) translating Japanese for Daniel constantly. Overall, it's not that big of a deal to me.""The Karate Kid Part II"" has a lot of elements that I'm sure all types of people would enjoy: action, drama and a bit of romance all entwined to make an excellent sequel to the already classic first one.

This classic film from 1984, follows a young teen, Daniel (Ralph Macchio) whose life is already in turmoil due to a life changing move cross country. Now in California, Daniel tries to fit in, but has difficulties doing so and he has to talk his way out of a few fights. His luck finally runs dry and one night he is chased home and as he is being beaten up, someone comes to his defense and saves him. He wakes up later that night to find out his savior is none other than his apartment buildings' aging gardener, Miyagi (Pat Morita) but how could this little old man have taken on all the bullies? And can this man help Daniel turn things around and defend himself and his honor? Watch as these two become student and teacher not only build a lasting friendship, but help each other get through some trying times in their lives.My favorite character is Miyagi, because you don't expect this little, old man to be able to not old defend himself, but beat up a lot of bullies along the way. Plus, he is so funny in how he trains Daniel and just his overall personality. My favorite scenes are the training scenes, where Miyagi uses basic household chores to train Daniel, which confuses him. These are funny scenes, but at the same time, it is great how they will eventually tie in the training concepts with Daniel. This is a great example of someone who needs to prove to themselves and others that they have a great deal of inner strength. The storyline of this movie is phenomenal and there is a great amount of action in it as well. The cast does a great job and really give great performances that make them seem so believable.This is a fantastic family film and even though it's almost 30 years old, the story still holds strong today.

The story actually focuses more on Miyagi than Daniel.  The beginning gives us a nice cameo from the evil John Kreese, but soon Daniel and Miyagi are in Okinawa because Miyagi's father is dying.  Miyagi's old buddy, Sato, has been harboring a hatred for Miyagi for over 40 years coz Miyagi stole his chick and made him look like a schmuck in public.  Most of the movie has Sato trying to force Miyagi into having a death match with him to regain his honor.  In doing this, he does things that make him look even more and more dishonorable.  He destroyes Miyagi's family dojo, destroyes his garden and threatens to even destroy the village!  Daniel's not off the hook either.  He gets harassed by a whole new group of bullies in Okinawa.  The leader is Sato's nephew who's played by the guy from Better Off Dead that tries to get John Cusack to race and talks like Howard Cosell.  Daniel also falls in love.  Apparently Elizabeth Shue couldn't be lured back, so she was written out via falling in love with another guy.  Daniel now says the word ""karate"" with an annoying accent, he slices through six slabs of ice, punches a guy in the crotch and rescues a girl during a storm.  My only complaint, and I'm sure most agree with this, is in the final fight scene.  That whole deal with the drums and Daniel swinging his arms back and forth.  Isn't that a little lame?  Like you wouldn't be able to dodge that.  Of course in reality Daniel would certainly have lost that death match, but that wouldn't be a very good way to end the film.

I'll go as far to give it a notch up on Karate Kid I.Several reasons for my views on this. One - Additional depth of the characters. I love that Mr. Miyagi is the center of the story. The movie gave him a back story and explained him much more. It humanized him. Second - It isn't all about Laruso. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the first film and its themes. It was brillance on the part of the writers make Laruso a secondary character to Miyagi in this one. Third - the themes are intact and expanded upon (honor, loyality, love etc) others have mentioned it. I whole heartidly agree.On the sappy front I love Daniel's relationship with Kumiko. It was touching and felt much more honest and real opposed to Daniel's love intrest in I. Too bad Kumiko didn't return for III. Could've been some nice development there.In regards to the acting - Its very good contary to some others opinons expressed here. The only exception being Miyagi's father's death scene. I thought the ""death"" was the only weak acting point. The scene is good, just the actor who played Miyagi's father I think overplayed the death. Other actors peform well.Overall, this film avoids the cliches and trappings of sequels. It develops the characters and shows you new sides to them. It also keeps the themes intact of the original.This film still holds up well. Its a bit different in that it doesn't play the bullying card the way the first movie does. It isn't just about Daniel and winning respect. This one is about support and love to a friend and mentor in his time of need.A wonderful sequel that has earned its spot next to I.Highly recommended.",4,Mr. Miyagi's Personal Journey aka Karate Kid II,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1720,"['Karate', 'Kid', 'II.Such', 'division', 'views', 'movie', 'Chalk', 'up', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'one', ""'ll"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'give', 'notch', 'up', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'I.Several', 'reasons', 'views', 'One', 'Additional', 'depth', 'characters', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'center', 'story', 'movie', 'gave', 'back', 'story', 'explained', 'much', 'more', 'humanized', 'Second', ""n't"", 'Laruso', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'themes', 'was', 'brillance', 'part', 'writers', 'make', 'Laruso', 'secondary', 'character', 'Miyagi', 'one', 'Third', 'themes', 'are', 'intact', 'expanded', 'upon', 'honor', 'loyality', 'love', 'etc', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'whole', 'heartidly', 'sappy', 'front', 'love', 'Daniel', 'relationship', 'Kumiko', 'was', 'touching', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'honest', 'real', 'opposed', 'Daniel', 'love', 'intrest', 'Too', 'bad', 'Kumiko', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'III', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'development', 'there.In', 'regards', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'contary', 'others', 'opinons', 'expressed', 'here', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'Miyagi', 'father', 'death', 'scene', 'thought', 'death', 'was', 'only', 'weak', 'acting', 'point', 'scene', 'good', 'just', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Miyagi', 'father', 'think', 'death', 'Other', 'actors', 'peform', 'well.Overall', 'film', 'cliches', 'trappings', 'sequels', 'characters', 'new', 'sides', 'also', 'themes', 'intact', 'original.This', 'film', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'bit', 'different', ""n't"", 'play', 'bullying', 'card', 'way', 'first', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'Daniel', 'winning', 'respect', 'one', 'support', 'love', 'friend', 'mentor', 'time', 'need.A', 'wonderful', 'sequel', 'earned', 'spot', 'I.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

With this film, I think the objective was to get away from the 80s California scene with accompanying music and instead go with something more reflective of karate and its origins and culture. This film has more of a 'pure' feeling to it, and the viewer probably learns a bit more by seeing and assimilating karate and its culture. However, the underlying theme is the same: revenge. Another thing that struck me as somewhat odd was the overall lack of karate in it. It isn't until the very end of the film that something finally happens, and the intensity builds. Still, this movie has a good storyline, and the acting is superb. I recommend this film for those who don't mind a complete shift away from the look and feel of the first film.",4,Pretty Good,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,996,"['enjoyed', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'most', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'punch', 'pun', 'intended', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'intensity', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'cruel', 'karate', 'instructor', 'plotted', 'mercy', 'Daniel', 'film', 'think', 'objective', 'was', 'get', 'away', '80s', 'California', 'scene', 'accompanying', 'music', 'instead', 'go', 'something', 'more', 'reflective', 'karate', 'origins', 'culture', 'film', 'more', ""'pure"", 'feeling', 'viewer', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'seeing', 'assimilating', 'karate', 'culture', 'However', 'underlying', 'theme', 'same', 'revenge', 'thing', 'struck', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'was', 'overall', 'lack', 'karate', ""n't"", 'very', 'end', 'film', 'something', 'finally', 'intensity', 'builds', 'Still', 'movie', 'good', 'storyline', 'acting', 'superb', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'complete', 'shift', 'away', 'look', 'feel', 'first', 'film']",N/A

Mr. Miyagi was going to let Daniel stay with him until he receives a letter from Okinawa telling him that his father is dying. So Miyagi leaves to go there and Daniel joins him. Miyagi tells Daniel that the reason he left Okinawa was because his best friend, Sato whose family is the most affluent in Okinawa, was promised Yukie whose the girl Miyagi loved. So Miyagi asks her to run away with him and when Sato learned of this, he challenged Miyagi to a fight to the death. So Miyagi left. Upon arriving Miyagi discovers Sato still wants to fight him and his nephew and best student Chozen has it out for Daniel.

The continuing journey of Daniel LaRusso bursts wide open in 'The Karate Kid Part II' Mr. Miyagi must return to his home land of Okinawa to see his dying father, but he is also well aware that the scars of his past are still there waiting for him after all this time. Daniel learns of Mr. Miyagi's best friend Sato and how Miyagi broke the village tradition to ask for the hand of his best friend's betrothed wife. Daniel learns through his trip that karate is more than tournaments and trophies. He learns that it is about honor and pride. He soon understands that there are people who take honor very seriously that they will stop at nothing seek out the purity of honor if it has been disgraced. That means anything is possible, even a fight to the death. Only through the sacred rules and techniques of the Miyagi family karate can Daniel overcome the tremendous obstacles he will face at this step in his journey.This movie is one of the fabled sequels that live up to its predecessor. The story is darker and Pat Morita's performance is his best by far. I am surprised that he didn't get nominated a second time for an academy award. The villains are just as evil as the Cobra Kais (who actually make a brief appearance in the film) and the final fight shows that karate is not about fancy moves and glory. The message learned from `Part II' is that when it comes to fighting the most powerful technique is the one that your opponent doesn't see.",5,One step above the Crane technique...

First and foremost, Daniel is not protected by the confines of a tournament anymore.  Or a nice enough bully who kicks you and walks away.  This film's tagline in 1986 was ""This time, the combat is real"".  And that is the core.  In the end, Daniel's new foe wants him dead, and this time neither Miyagi or ""points"" can save him.Even the storm sequence, which in another film would be hokey time-filler, is actually a device to bring Sato and Miyagi together again as friends.  As well as drive the final rift between Chozen and Daniel.  And the tea ceremony just an excuse to kiss?  Not if you recall Kumiko saying during Miyagi and Yukie's ceremony, ""They are falling love again"".  Kumiko was not only telling Daniel she wanted to be intimate, but that she was falling in love with him.  So many great set-ups and pay-offs for the viewer.So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart :).

In this sequel, the subject matter gets a littler darker with the journey into Mr. Miyagi's past.For a basic plot summary, ""Karate Kid II"" sees Miyagi (Pat Morita) getting called back to his Okinawa hometown to attend to his sick and dying father.  With Daniel (Ralph Macchio) in tow, Mr. Miyagi must deal with an old foe he thought was left in the past, while Daniel falls for a local girl and gets in his own hot water.What allows this film to continue the legacy of the original is the veering away from just copying that one, while also staying true to the series' emotional core.  Miyagi and Daniel still have that great mentor/student relationship, and that bond is only strengthened by their tribulations in Okinawa.  This time, the situation is real...no tournaments, no points, and all the main characters are tested accordingly.Also helping this film's cause is a sense of production stability.  John G. Avildsen continues at the helm, while the quality score (by Bill Conti) adds a level of emotion beyond the characters.Thus, if you enjoyed the original Karate Kid, fear not...you'll like this one too!
