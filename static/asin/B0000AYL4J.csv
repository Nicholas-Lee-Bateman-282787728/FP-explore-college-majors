I thought the sense of the time period was well done and I loved the music. The music was almost as good as the plot and that was certainly well written. It was delightful.

It has many plot twists and turns along with wonderfully recreating the depicted era (1940s) The movie has one very bright/sharp and conniving character that appears to be leading the seemly dem character astray with the dense character, of course, being a little smarter than she appears (or just damn lucky) and MOST OF ALL the presentation has lots of that so-called British ""black humor"".  It's really a good show that kept this viewer on the edge of his seat while at the same time completely amused.  I plan on watching this DVD many times.  ""Dead Gorgeous"" is FAR superior to what usually is offered on the T.V. screen or (to me) what's in the movie houses.If you want to have a pleasant evening of entertainment buy this DVD-you'll love it!",5,A DELICIOUS DRAMA/MYSTERY,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,868,"['had', 'jolly', 'good', 'ole', 'time', 'watching', 'presentation', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'lot', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'wonderfully', 'recreating', 'depicted', 'era', '1940s', 'movie', 'one', 'very', 'bright/sharp', 'conniving', 'character', 'be', 'leading', 'seemly', 'dem', 'character', 'astray', 'dense', 'character', 'course', 'being', 'little', 'smarter', 'just', 'damn', 'lucky', 'MOST', 'presentation', 'lots', 'so-called', 'British', 'black', 'humor', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'kept', 'viewer', 'edge', 'seat', 'same', 'time', 'completely', 'amused', 'plan', 'watching', 'DVD', 'many', 'times', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'FAR', 'superior', 'what', 'usually', 'offered', 'T.V', 'screen', 'what', 'movie', 'houses.If', 'want', 'have', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'buy', 'DVD-you', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

768897,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B0000AYL4J,Kendra,"[9, 18]","The story of a rich and insane selfish woman, and her friend-- a milquetoast spineless wretch-- could well be entertaining with an excellent plot, great actors, and good film making, and it is-- but in a very limited way.This movie has all the components for success, but it also contains a disturbing fatal flaw that creates a moral quandary far more disturbing than the creators likely had in mind. This was far more deeply disturbing than one would glean from the marketing, positive reviews here, and certainly from Diana Rigg's quaint introduction. This is truly a story of madness, weakness, selfishness and a repulsive lack of consideration for others. The movie left me cold and annoyed. As I watched, I kept thinking, how could they do that? I don't want to include any spoilers here, but don't be swayed by the hype on this movie. The film fails because it confuses a depth of human failure and vileness for mystery  that is completely out of place in a production such as this.There is something very very wrong with ""Dead Gorgeous""-- not the acting, not the production values or the plotting. The screen writers apparently forgot characterization, so what remains is a pretend quaint romp through post-war London.  In actuality, this is a vile thing about shallowness and nihilism that made me cringe in revulsion.

768898,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B0000AYL4J,Russell Fanelli,"[14, 15]","We would not be a bit surprised if Dead Gorgeous had been directed by Alfred Hitchcock, which is a great tribute to director Sarah Harding.  Twists and turns abound in this story of a murderous femme fatale, Antonia, played to the hilt by Helen McCrory, and her not so willing accomplice, Rose, skillfully acted by Fay Ripley.Rose and her long lost friend Antonia are both in a pickle.  Each has a husband she would prefer dead.  Antonia has a plan to get rid of both of them and immediately disposes of Rose's husband in what appears to be an accident at the train station.  Getting rid of Antonia's husband proves to be more difficult, yet the murderous Antonia has the skills and disposition worthy of Lady Macbeth.  Her friend Rose is in over her head and does not know what to do about it.  She appears to be no match for Antonia's determination and manipulative behavior.  The action builds to a surprising and satisfying conclusion.Dead Gorgeous is so much better than 80% of the movies turned out by Hollywood, yet it is unlikely that many people outside of Great Britain will have heard of it.  I hope that this review will be seen by a few people who will then be persuaded to watch the film, which will delight and entertain them.  Highly recommended.",5,Plenty of twists and turns in Dead Gorgeous,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,1262,"['would', 'not', 'be', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'great', 'tribute', 'director', 'Sarah', 'Harding', 'Twists', 'turns', 'abound', 'story', 'murderous', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Antonia', 'played', 'hilt', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'not', 'so', 'willing', 'accomplice', 'Rose', 'skillfully', 'acted', 'Fay', 'Ripley.Rose', 'long', 'lost', 'friend', 'Antonia', 'are', 'pickle', 'husband', 'would', 'prefer', 'dead', 'Antonia', 'plan', 'get', 'rid', 'immediately', 'disposes', 'Rose', 'husband', 'what', 'be', 'accident', 'train', 'station', 'Getting', 'rid', 'Antonia', 'husband', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'yet', 'murderous', 'Antonia', 'skills', 'disposition', 'worthy', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'friend', 'Rose', 'head', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'be', 'match', 'Antonia', 'determination', 'manipulative', 'behavior', 'action', 'surprising', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'so', 'much', 'better', '80', '%', 'movies', 'turned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'yet', 'unlikely', 'many', 'people', 'Great', 'Britain', 'will', 'have', 'heard', 'hope', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'then', 'be', 'persuaded', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'delight', 'entertain', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
