1106220,A1VZIN7K9TKGQ2,B000W1SZ9U,"A. Kote ""poison ivy""","[5, 7]","I Know Who Killed Me, the 2007 horror mystery starring Lindsay Lohan is an interesting tale. More so interesting is the controversy surrounding it; released just weeks after Lohan's DUI arrest - the film, along with Georgia Rule, found itself released in a period where Lindsay Lohan was becoming a more so established tabloid staple than respected actress. With all the drama surrounding Lohan in this period, it was easy to hate on I Know Who Killed Me. Just as at the time of this publishing, it's quite easy to hate on anything Paris Hilton puts out regardless of quality.But despite the bad rep this film has attained, it's actually not that bad. In fact, it's actually quite good. The film centers around Aubrey Fleming, a young and bright high school student who gets kidnapped by a sadistic serial killer. Days later police find the body of Aubrey - but she claims to be Dakota Moss, an orphaned runaway now turned exotic dancer, and insists that the real Aubrey is still in danger.The film is a big puzzle itself, and a decent mystery. The director also uses colors as symbols, with Blue representing Aubrey, and Red representing Dakota. Throughout the film the two colors are displayed, and it's visually beautiful.Often relying on the torture porn aspect, the film at times uses the horror formula of gore, but I Know Who Killed Me isn't just a throwaway torture flick, it's actually pretty smart if you bother to set aside any biases you may already have for Lohan or the film itself. If anything, the film gets credit for being original in a sea of constantly recycled remakes and sequels in the horror genre.",5,Original and unique,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1622,"['Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', '2007', 'horror', 'mystery', 'starring', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'interesting', 'tale', 'More', 'so', 'interesting', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'released', 'just', 'weeks', 'Lohan', 'DUI', 'film', 'Georgia', 'Rule', 'found', 'released', 'period', 'where', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'was', 'becoming', 'more', 'so', 'established', 'tabloid', 'staple', 'respected', 'actress', 'drama', 'surrounding', 'Lohan', 'period', 'was', 'easy', 'hate', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'Just', 'time', 'publishing', 'quite', 'easy', 'hate', 'anything', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'out', 'regardless', 'quality.But', 'bad', 'rep', 'film', 'attained', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'centers', 'Aubrey', 'Fleming', 'young', 'bright', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'later', 'police', 'find', 'body', 'Aubrey', 'be', 'Dakota', 'Moss', 'orphaned', 'runaway', 'now', 'turned', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'real', 'Aubrey', 'still', 'danger.The', 'film', 'big', 'puzzle', 'decent', 'mystery', 'director', 'also', 'colors', 'symbols', 'Blue', 'representing', 'Aubrey', 'Red', 'representing', 'Dakota', 'film', 'two', 'colors', 'are', 'displayed', 'visually', 'beautiful.Often', 'relying', 'torture', 'porn', 'aspect', 'film', 'times', 'horror', 'formula', 'gore', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', ""n't"", 'just', 'throwaway', 'torture', 'flick', 'actually', 'pretty', 'smart', 'bother', 'set', 'aside', 'biases', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'Lohan', 'film', 'anything', 'film', 'credit', 'being', 'original', 'sea', 'constantly', 'recycled', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'horror', 'genre']",I Know Who Killed Me

As soon as it hit the shelves I was at the store with this DVD in my hot little hands. I read the back, as as I noticed it said she was kidnapped and disfigured, had missing limbs, etc., I was more intrigued. My daughter, who is 7, usually watches all the Lindsay movies with me, but this time, I felt that wouldn't be such a great idea. BOY am I GLAD I listened to my instincts!!I decided to watch this movie after midnight when everyone was asleep. Now, call me a wimp, but this movie was soooooo disturbing, I thought I was going to have nightmares for sure!!! Just the parts where the serial killer was torturing her alone gave me the major heebs!! I still can't get those images out of my mind!! As for the rest of the movie, the story line was pretty good, her playing a dual role as sweet school girl Aubrey Fleming and then free spirited exotic dancer Dakota Moss. I think she has a phenomenal body, but her stripping/dance sequences seemed to last forever.Some parts were a bit confusing,... the man on the bus with the moving tattoo on his chest being one,... and the weird boss type person (I don't even know if this was a man or woman) Dakota had at the club.The only part about this movie I really HATED was the ending. This had to be the lamest, most ridiculous ending in movie history. I kept staring at the screen thinking ""This CAN'T be the end!!"" I can only hope it ended the way it did because they're going to make a sequel so we know what happened to her afterwards......If you're a major Lindsay Lohan fan, buy this for sure, but if you don't like her to begin with, don't waste your money,... :)",4,"Very disturbing for a Lindsay movie,....",1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1754,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'love', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'movies', 'music', 'just', 'usually', 'buy', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'exception', 'As', 'soon', 'hit', 'shelves', 'was', 'store', 'DVD', 'hot', 'little', 'hands', 'read', 'back', 'noticed', 'said', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'disfigured', 'had', 'missing', 'limbs', 'etc.', 'was', 'more', 'intrigued', 'daughter', 'who', '7', 'usually', 'Lindsay', 'movies', 'time', 'felt', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'BOY', 'am', 'GLAD', 'listened', 'instincts', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'midnight', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'asleep', 'Now', 'call', 'wimp', 'movie', 'was', 'soooooo', 'disturbing', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'nightmares', 'sure', 'Just', 'parts', 'where', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'torturing', 'alone', 'gave', 'major', 'heebs', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'images', 'mind', 'rest', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'playing', 'dual', 'role', 'sweet', 'school', 'girl', 'Aubrey', 'Fleming', 'then', 'free', 'spirited', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'Dakota', 'Moss', 'think', 'phenomenal', 'body', 'stripping/dance', 'sequences', 'seemed', 'last', 'forever.Some', 'parts', 'were', 'bit', 'confusing', 'man', 'bus', 'moving', 'tattoo', 'chest', 'being', 'one', 'weird', 'boss', 'type', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'man', 'woman', 'Dakota', 'had', 'club.The', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'really', 'HATED', 'was', 'ending', 'had', 'be', 'lamest', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'movie', 'history', 'kept', 'staring', 'screen', 'thinking', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'be', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'ended', 'way', 'did', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'sequel', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', ""'re"", 'major', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'fan', 'buy', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'begin', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money']",I Know Who Killed Me

Something like this is hard to place a label on, because it tries to be serious and frightening, but it falls short. At times the scenarios are just silly or over-the-top. Lindsay Lohan does a fair job of a damsel in distress (i.e. she plays a girl being kidnapped and tortured well), but her persona is not quite the proper fit for this type of movie. Or perhaps she is the right fit, considering her character, Aubrey Fleming (and Dakota Moss as well), is all of a nice girl, a ""bad"" girl, a stripper, and more. Do you see a similarity to Lohan's personal life?Fleming is a studious girl who has a white-fenced life, and when she is kidnapped and then tortured by an unknown man, confusion and frustration stirs. Keep a close eye on people Fleming interacts with, because one of those people is your mysterious unknown kidnapper. Upon returning alive, Fleming claims her name is actually Dakota Moss, who isn't exactly a studious girl - a stripper.

1106226,A39K9GDTIZ0933,B000W1SZ9U,Braden Pickering,"[4, 5]","I think this film was unfairly branded a disaster right from the start because the star, Lindsay Lohan, is more known for being a real-life tranwreck than anything else. But the truth is, I don't mind her as an actress, and she's actually fairly competent in a role that could easily turn into parody and undermine the ""heavyness"" of what the story is all about. I also thought Julia Ormand was great as the concerned and confused mother.The plot was interesting, and kept me engaged until the very end, though in the process managed to throw a few curveballs that I felt were unsubstantiated and meant only to make the viewer more confused. It also seemed like the scenes of Lindsay dancing in the strip joint went on forever. I guess a lot of guys wouldn't complain, lol, but it seemed pretty gratuitous anyhow, even if there was no actual nudity. It's like, we get it, you're low class, now move on. Lastly, there was a general ""made for tv"" feeling about the whole thing, suggesting the budget was limited. That didn't affect the performances, but some of the graphic effects came off as corny.In the end, I'm impartial to the movie. I found it in the bargain bin at a chain store, and it was worth watching once for the price. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to recommend it, but I also felt like I needed to defend it against the people who said it was the epitomy of bad film-making.

The good news is that while not great the movie is surprisingly watchable. The plotting and acting in director Chris Sivertson's is fair and the film does keep your attention throughout.It would be hard to decide if this was a thriller masking itself as a horror film or the opposite. For my money this is more horror than thriller. Lohan plays good girl Aubrey Fleming who is kidnapped by a serial killer (Thomas Tofel). A woman who looks surprisinly like Aubrey is discovered on the side of the road who claims her name is Dakota Moss a hard as nails stripper. The issue to be resolved in the film is whether Dakota is really Aubrey or not.The film looks great due to the phenomenal photography of John Leonetti. The story by Jeff Hammond becomes predictable after a short while. The disc features only minor special features including an extended stip club scene.Watch it for the fun of it.

I didn't care if the guy tortured one--or both, if that's the case--of the girls because Lohan is so burnt out at this point that it's nauseating.  Her personal, off-camera image aside, she was lousy in this movie, but the movie stunk as well.  What were they smoking to put this debacle out in the theaters?  Hmm, seems like a bad trip...Lohan has that squeaky, husky brat voice that gets on your nerves, just like her near-cousin Miley Cyrus, and it gets on your last nerve very quickly, just like a squeaky doorknob.  You have no idea what's going on at first, and then it plays out even worse than the most horrific offering Lifetime has given us through the years.Terrible casting and lousy dialogue are all power driven by a stupid title that doesn't ring true.  Too bad it didn't drive straight over a cliff.  Add to the fact that we have the irritating Julia Ormond ""playing"" a mother who just happens to let her daughter go upstairs with a boyfriend and boink his brains out very loudly.  Oh, yeah?

1106230,A15BXE9V3WADH8,B000W1SZ9U,CeCe,"[2, 3]","I just watched this movie today and was confused all the way up to the end...but then confused again. The only thing I really disliked was who the killer was...and why was he the killer??? The movie doesn't give a clear grasp as to why the killer did what he did at all. The movie overall was good- wayyyy better than expected. I could actually watch it again. It's basically two twins are kidnapped but no one knows there is two...so then one gets away who is actually the twin no one knows about and they think she is the original girl. Hope that makes sense. She tries all she can convincing them she is her own person but no one believes her. As an end result, she can feel the other twins' pain (loses limbs as she does, gets the wind knocked out of her when she does, etc) and that causes the escaped twin to find the still kidnapped, and only known about, one. I mean the movie didn't look low budget to me, and I think Lilo's acting was great. Probably not the best role to have gotten into right away but it was still a decent movie. Just watch it for yourself. Or try some youtube clips. I don't understand why people hate it so much; I just didn't understand and dislike who the killer was without any motive or reasoning that we as the audience could see.Oh and if you're a girl who hates other female nudity (me!) there are some stripper boobs that are gonna poke out at you. Also, some people said this movie is too gory...others said not at all. In my opinion, there are some pretty gross scenes. I turned my head 3 or 4 times.

1106231,A30CJA09ZUUBJ4,B000W1SZ9U,"Charlie Spivey ""Gamer""","[1, 3]","After reading the reviews for this movie in the local paper, and not being a Lohan fan, I was not particularly interested in seeing this movie. I decided to blow $20 off a gift card and get this Movie. This movie, unlike a lot of others I've seen, held my attention from start to finish. I thought the Director did a remarkable job, in that he didn't tip the ending early on or even halway through the movie, like what happens in a lot of others. If this was LiLo's transistory film to more adult oriented films,I felt she did a good job. I agree with the other reviewers, who said that because of her other problems, the film was pretty much DOA, and that was a shame, and a primary reason I didn't pay much attention to it when it was playing in the theater. It is a far cry from her Disney films for sure. As for the the ""strip dance"", she didn't strip. She did do a very erotic dance in black undies or hot pants, I can't really determine what they were, and a see thru Bustier, although she was wearing pasties. I thought she did a very good job with the role, andas I said, I am no Lindsey Lohan fan, but with more roles like this, or at least in more ""adult oriented storylines"". I believe if she can put her problems behind her and pick her roles carefully, she has a real potential away from Disney. In this film, she was a very talented student with one character, and a Hot erotic dancer with the other character. That was pretty diverse, and I thought she pulled off quite well. I think most of the Media Reviewers and others were jaded by her off screen activities and based their reviews on that rather than the job she did in the film. I was guilty of shunning the film when it played in the theaters for same reason. This film will definately hold you from start to finish and I thought Lindsey did a very credible job in her first non teeny bopper film. Charlie S.",4,Not What I Expected....

1106238,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000W1SZ9U,Dave. K,"[15, 19]","There are many reasons for my 1-star rating, which is something I don't normally do. Prior to this I only rated a movie 1-star three times before and I also very rarely rate a movie 5-stars even if I loved the movie. While there are a couple of 2-star reviews that I think this movie might be better than the reason I give this one star is simple; I Know Who Killed Me attempts to be an intelligent and clever thriller, but instead ends up being idiotic.Right now the reviews out there are quite bad and you might ask yourself is it really that bad? Well and yes and no. This isn't the worst movie of the year, but it's still really bad. The thing is the movie tries to be smart and it fails. Also there are a few ways you can see this movie on what actually happened, I cannot get into detail as it would ruin the movie, but who really cares if this is spoiled? But I still won't get into detail, but the problem is the movie is so horribly presented most of these things will be lost on you unless you pay full attention and well that's quite tough to do.Right now Lindsey Lohan is getting a lot of heat and personally I thought the negative reviews were due to that. I wasn't expecting a great movie, but a better one than I got. But the reviews are mostly legit this was a bad movie. About the only good thing I can say is the stripping scenes by Lohan only she's not naked. How can you make a movie about a stripper and not show her nude? Regardless when that is the only good thing about the movie you know there is trouble.Writer Jeffrey Hammond wrote a terrible screenplay. He tries to be smart and fails all the way. The script is idiotic and the characters are mostly terrible. They have no depth and well nothing going for them. If not for casting some semi-known actors you wouldn't remember who was who. The idea wasn't bad, but so horribly written. The investigation was the weakest parts.Director Chris Sivertson fails at brining any suspense or tension, but in fairness he didn't have much of a script to work with. In film it's more about the director, while in TV it's more about the writing, but you still need a passable script and in TV need a decent director. Quite honestly Alfred Hitchcock could have directed this and ok maybe the movie would have been better, but still would be a total mess. The visual look was interesting and the use of colors were some what interesting, but it seems like Chris Sivertson was trying to a little Argento, don't try it. You aren't him. The final act where it was more suspense was really week. There was no sense of pacing at all, while the final act wouldn't salvage the movie it could have at least shown some potential the movie had. I would be open to seeing another movie by Chris Sivertson to see what he is capable of. He was failed by a script and there was no way he could save the movie.The acting was fairly decent; there were some good actors here, but none have anything interesting to say, but do their best on selling it. Gregory Itzin surely could do better than this. He's been around for a while, but recently his star rose from playing Charles Logan on the hit show 24. Thankfully his role was small, shame to see such a talented actor like him stuck here.Lindsey Lohan takes a lot of heat and honestly I think a lot of it is personal. Remember when Lindsey first started to make a name for herself? She was the cute kid with potential, than the cute teenager with potential, but once she got a little wild the media turned on her and made her into a villain and sadly the public buys into it. What Lindsey Lohan does on her own time is her business; judge her acting based on her performance and not her private life. Lindsey does well here and I think has potential to be an excellent actress in the future, but she just has to get on the right track. It seems these days she's famous for being famous. But the girl does have talent and hopefully she doesn't blow it.Again I think Lindsey Lohan gave a good performance, but she took on the wrong role. I understand she wants to break away from the roles she was doing, but this wasn't the movie to do that with.In closing, I Know Who Killed Me is a lousy flick that tries to be clever and intelligent and fails at every level.",1,"Maybe not as bad as you heard, but still terrible",1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,4258,"['are', 'many', 'reasons', '1-star', 'rating', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'do', 'Prior', 'only', 'rated', 'movie', '1-star', 'three', 'times', 'also', 'very', 'rarely', 'rate', 'movie', '5-stars', 'even', 'loved', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', '2-star', 'reviews', 'think', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'reason', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'simple', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'attempts', 'be', 'intelligent', 'clever', 'thriller', 'instead', 'up', 'being', 'idiotic.Right', 'now', 'reviews', 'are', 'quite', 'bad', 'might', 'ask', 'really', 'bad', 'Well', 'yes', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'year', 'still', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'be', 'smart', 'Also', 'are', 'few', 'ways', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'detail', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'really', 'spoiled', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'detail', 'problem', 'movie', 'so', 'horribly', 'presented', 'most', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'pay', 'full', 'attention', 'well', 'quite', 'tough', 'do.Right', 'now', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'getting', 'lot', 'heat', 'personally', 'thought', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'due', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'great', 'movie', 'better', 'one', 'got', 'reviews', 'are', 'mostly', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'stripping', 'scenes', 'Lohan', 'only', 'not', 'naked', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'stripper', 'not', 'show', 'nude', 'Regardless', 'when', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'know', 'trouble.Writer', 'Jeffrey', 'Hammond', 'wrote', 'terrible', 'screenplay', 'be', 'smart', 'way', 'script', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'terrible', 'have', 'depth', 'well', 'nothing', 'going', 'not', 'casting', 'semi-known', 'actors', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'so', 'horribly', 'written', 'investigation', 'was', 'weakest', 'parts.Director', 'Chris', 'Sivertson', 'brining', 'suspense', 'tension', 'fairness', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'script', 'work', 'film', 'more', 'director', 'TV', 'more', 'writing', 'still', 'need', 'passable', 'script', 'TV', 'need', 'decent', 'director', 'Quite', 'honestly', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'ok', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'mess', 'visual', 'look', 'was', 'interesting', 'use', 'colors', 'were', 'what', 'interesting', 'Chris', 'Sivertson', 'was', 'trying', 'little', 'Argento', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'are', ""n't"", 'final', 'act', 'where', 'was', 'more', 'suspense', 'was', 'really', 'week', 'was', 'sense', 'pacing', 'final', 'act', 'would', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'shown', 'potential', 'movie', 'had', 'would', 'be', 'open', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Sivertson', 'see', 'what', 'capable', 'was', 'failed', 'script', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'save', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'were', 'good', 'actors', 'here', 'none', 'have', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'do', 'best', 'selling', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'surely', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'been', 'while', 'recently', 'star', 'rose', 'playing', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'hit', 'show', '24', 'Thankfully', 'role', 'was', 'small', 'shame', 'see', 'such', 'talented', 'actor', 'stuck', 'here.Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'lot', 'heat', 'honestly', 'think', 'lot', 'personal', 'Remember', 'when', 'Lindsey', 'first', 'started', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'was', 'cute', 'kid', 'potential', 'cute', 'teenager', 'potential', 'once', 'got', 'little', 'wild', 'media', 'turned', 'made', 'villain', 'sadly', 'public', 'What', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'own', 'time', 'business', 'judge', 'acting', 'based', 'performance', 'not', 'private', 'life', 'Lindsey', 'well', 'here', 'think', 'potential', 'be', 'excellent', 'actress', 'future', 'just', 'get', 'right', 'track', 'days', 'famous', 'being', 'famous', 'girl', 'have', 'talent', 'hopefully', ""n't"", 'blow', 'it.Again', 'think', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'took', 'wrong', 'role', 'understand', 'break', 'away', 'roles', 'was', 'doing', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'do', 'with.In', 'closing', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'lousy', 'flick', 'be', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'fails', 'level']",I Know Who Killed Me
1106239,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000W1SZ9U,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 6]","As a movie title, ""I Know Who Killed Me"" doesn't make a whole lot of scene after watching it.  First off, 'Me' is rather off-put, since the movie deals with Dakota (Lohan) being mistaken for the missing victim Aubrey (same actress) and stubbornly persisted that she's not Aubrey; it was near the end of the movie where she quoted the movie title, which given she didn't want to compare herself to Aubrey and the situations that occurred, saying 'me' contradicts her identity.  Second, 'Killed' is a false use of the verb, since after the movie went through the most ridiculous plot twists I've ever heard, the 'Killed' portion never happened.  The most logical title of the movie should have been ""I Know Who Captured Her"" or ""I Know Who The Killer Is"", but I presume those suggestions don't roll off the tongue so the movie is stuck with a title that's both incongruous and misleading.  Complaining about the title is just the tip of the crap-stained iceberg.Lindsay Lohan is troublesome throughout the whole movie.  She played the normal bespectacled Aubrey, which I thought she was phoning it in as being sophisticated, and then she played Dakota, the bottom-playing hostess who's raunchy attitude actually fits Lohan.  Still, Lohan as Dakota came off as very gaudy; I know she's suppose to be street bad, but she came off as whiny.  Her rudeness and inconsideration makes herself rather selfish, not to mention very pervasive as in the scene where she slept Aubrey's boyfriend; she had no taste and little concern for the people.  I guess her unappealing personality would be excused if she has the sex appeal, but Lohan doesn't even have that.  There were flashbacks where she pole danced at a nightclub, and she might be the most boring stripper I've ever seen, and not because she doesn't expose herself: she's dances so slowly, and she always appeared to be on depressants; her catwalks were so unsexy, even the customers in the movie weren't pleased.  Plus, what's wrong with her voice?  She sounds like she had a ton of smokes, which made me think she's gonna sound like Kathleen Turner after a few more years.Irrelevant is the key word of the whole movie.  It had some questionable artistic directions, like the constant fading to red or blue, pulling the ""Schindler's List"" black-and-white-with-color-in-certain-objects design, or shaky-cam jump-cuts,  but none of these designs are either significant or subdued for the story; the director seemed like he's trying to be stylistic without making a substantial point, so it's visually like an amateur version of ""Natural Born Killers"".  Worse than Lohan's acting is the godawful soundtrack: the songs are mainly indie junk and are poorly placed; the electro song being played during the sex scene makes '70s vintage porn music sound classy.  The sub-plots progressively get ignored, such as the FBI interrogation after the half-way point of the movie. The serial killer who caught Aubrey had no real motive and is just there, and I must say he has an unusual method of using tools made of stained-glass; I'm not sure if that's creative or pretentious.  The main story is the real culprit, as for most of the film, I was convinced Dakota was just Aubrey being in denial, but the film pulled a plot twist regarding 'stigmatic twins' and mind-reading that's nothing short of insulting.  It never shown how that was revealed, and the twist adds a surreal element that's totally out of place, making the film even less believable.""I Know Who Killed Me"" could possibly be, nay, IS actually worse than ""Showgirls"".  At least in ""Showgirls"", the trashiness was actually fun and the plot was consistent: it began as a striptease, it goes on as a striptease, and ends as a striptease. In this film, it starts with a crime, goes on as torture porn, continues as a mystery, leading to an astronomical supernatural thriller and ends as an art film. It all equals up to a baffling mess.",1,"Two Sides, All Parts Awful",1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,3933,"['movie', 'title', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'scene', 'watching', 'First', 'rather', 'off-put', 'movie', 'deals', 'Dakota', 'Lohan', 'being', 'mistaken', 'missing', 'victim', 'Aubrey', 'same', 'actress', 'stubbornly', 'persisted', 'not', 'Aubrey', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'quoted', 'movie', 'title', 'given', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'compare', 'Aubrey', 'situations', 'occurred', 'saying', 'identity', 'Second', ""'Killed"", 'false', 'use', 'verb', 'movie', 'went', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'twists', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', ""'Killed"", 'portion', 'never', 'happened', 'most', 'logical', 'title', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Know', 'Who', 'Captured', 'Her', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killer', 'Is', 'presume', 'suggestions', 'do', ""n't"", 'roll', 'off', 'tongue', 'movie', 'stuck', 'title', 'incongruous', 'misleading', 'Complaining', 'title', 'just', 'tip', 'crap-stained', 'iceberg.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'troublesome', 'whole', 'movie', 'played', 'normal', 'bespectacled', 'Aubrey', 'thought', 'was', 'phoning', 'being', 'sophisticated', 'then', 'played', 'Dakota', 'bottom-playing', 'hostess', 'who', 'raunchy', 'attitude', 'actually', 'Lohan', 'Still', 'Lohan', 'Dakota', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'gaudy', 'know', 'suppose', 'be', 'street', 'bad', 'came', 'off', 'whiny', 'rudeness', 'inconsideration', 'rather', 'selfish', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'pervasive', 'scene', 'where', 'slept', 'Aubrey', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'taste', 'little', 'concern', 'people', 'guess', 'unappealing', 'personality', 'would', 'be', 'excused', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Lohan', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'where', 'pole', 'danced', 'nightclub', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'boring', 'stripper', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', ""n't"", 'expose', 'dances', 'so', 'slowly', 'always', 'appeared', 'be', 'depressants', 'catwalks', 'were', 'so', 'unsexy', 'even', 'customers', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'what', 'wrong', 'voice', 'had', 'ton', 'smokes', 'made', 'think', 'gon', 'sound', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'few', 'more', 'years.Irrelevant', 'key', 'word', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'questionable', 'artistic', 'directions', 'constant', 'fading', 'red', 'blue', 'pulling', 'Schindler', 'List', 'black-and-white-with-color-in-certain-objects', 'design', 'shaky-cam', 'jump-cuts', 'none', 'designs', 'are', 'significant', 'subdued', 'story', 'director', 'seemed', 'trying', 'be', 'stylistic', 'making', 'substantial', 'point', 'visually', 'amateur', 'version', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'Worse', 'Lohan', 'acting', 'godawful', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'are', 'mainly', 'indie', 'junk', 'are', 'poorly', 'placed', 'electro', 'song', 'being', 'played', 'sex', 'scene', ""'70s"", 'vintage', 'porn', 'music', 'sound', 'classy', 'sub-plots', 'progressively', 'get', 'ignored', 'such', 'FBI', 'interrogation', 'half-way', 'point', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'caught', 'Aubrey', 'had', 'real', 'motive', 'just', 'there', 'must', 'say', 'unusual', 'method', 'using', 'tools', 'made', 'stained-glass', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'creative', 'pretentious', 'main', 'story', 'real', 'culprit', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'convinced', 'Dakota', 'was', 'just', 'Aubrey', 'being', 'denial', 'film', 'pulled', 'plot', 'twist', 'regarding', ""'stigmatic"", 'twins', 'mind-reading', 'nothing', 'short', 'insulting', 'never', 'shown', 'how', 'was', 'revealed', 'twist', 'surreal', 'element', 'totally', 'place', 'making', 'film', 'even', 'less', 'believable', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'nay', 'IS', 'actually', 'worse', 'Showgirls', 'least', 'Showgirls', 'trashiness', 'was', 'actually', 'fun', 'plot', 'was', 'consistent', 'began', 'striptease', 'striptease', 'striptease', 'film', 'crime', 'torture', 'porn', 'mystery', 'leading', 'astronomical', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'art', 'film', 'up', 'baffling', 'mess']",I Know Who Killed Me

Remember the gag in Airplane where people line up with more and more menacing weapons to get the hysterical passenger to snap out of it?  Those are the critics falling over one another to most definitively damn this movie.  Some are quite witty: I Know What Killed My Career, for example.  Of those I read whose reviews include a synopsis of the plot, one, ONE, recognized that Dakota may or may not be a figment of Aubrey's imagination.  Many describe Aubrey being found and claiming to be someone named Dakota.  Some talk of Dakota being found and mistaken for Aubrey.  This film is so widely condemned because it has failed to make itself understood.Aubrey reads a story to her classmates she has written of a leprotic Dakota hitchhiking to New Salem, an event which takes place in the film itself, later after Aubrey has been abducted and Dakota has begun to fall apart.  ""To Be Continued,"" it ends.  What she is writing is the plot of the movie itself.  It's a clever self-referentiation paradox which would make this film a huge hit with stoners if it were only more explicit.  It is so easy to miss, nearly everyone has missed it.The question whether Aubrey and Dakota are one imaginative person or two stigmatic twins should hang in the air and tickle like a psychoactive chemical, but instead it masquerades as having been answered.  Dakota in her red world should be introduced in parallel with Aubrey in her blue one, touching at points of Aubrey's writing and reading.  We are dense beef-fed Americans, Chris--we need to be bludgeoned with this stuff.  You have overestimated the intelligence of your audience.  Then when Dakota wakes surrounded by people who insist that she is someone she is certain she is not, we know her and we can sympathize.  As it stands, it's like: meet Aubrey, the star of our SIKE!!  No Aubrey for you!  Here, have someone you don't know but who looks like her instead.Lastly, maybe most importantly, Lindsey Lohan's butt should spend way more time on the screen.  Inclusion on the DVD of the extended dance sequences is a step in the right direction.  Let's hope the eventual ""director's cut"" splices them into the feature.This one is a flawed gem.

Never will be.And nowhere is this more evident than in ghastly, painful mess of ""I Know Who Killed Me,"" a thrill-less thriller full of oblique, clumsy symbolism and wretchedly poor scripting. If you need any further proof that Lindsay Lohan's career is in the loo, just look at this.It opens with a girl at a strip club, then cuts to an identical girl, Aubrey (Lohan) who is sweet, quiet, studious and writes self-contemplative ""literature.""But then Aubrey vanishes after a football game, and apparently got kidnapped by a serial killer. She's later found minus an arm and a leg. When her weird parents rush to her bedside, she claims not to be Aubrey. She says she's Dakota, a stripper working in a seedy club, and that she doesn't know anyone around her.Of course, everyone thinks that this is some bizarre psychological problem. And, of course, it's not. As she struggles to convince everyone (except Aubrey's boyfriend) that she isn't Aubrey, Dakota tries to unravel three mysteries: who the serial killer is, where Aubrey has gone, and what the connection between the two is.Well, it may be a mystery to Dakota, anyway. But any viewers who manage to stay awake during the first fifteen minutes will not only figure out the connection between the girls, but who the bad guy is. The whole twist ending is completely untwisted from the start, especially when your protagonist is saying absurd things like, ""I know who killed me!""But in the meantime, Siverton tries to evoke a Lynchian atmosphere with lots of symbolism, arty camerawork, and scattered plot threads that go nowhere. People pop up to say Really, Like, Deep Things, then go away. And when the plot flags, Siverton throws in decomposing flesh, awkward sex and pole dances, and some prolonged shots of Lohan squeaking and writhing. Very BDSM.Apparently in an effort to show the INCREDIBLE DEPTH of his ART, Siverton liberally strews the story with blue items -- roses, gloves, bone saws, etc. What do they symbolize? Who knows, but in case we could have POSSIBLY missed all the blueness, Siverton even tints the camera lenses blue sometimes. Thank you so VERY much, Chris.But admittedly it's not ALL Siverton's fault. Even a great director would have been hard-pressed to make anything but a turkey of this script, penned by the rambling semiliterate Jeff Hammond. Most of his dialogue vacillates between wooden (""""She knew a trick. She knew how to turn her life into a movie and watch what happened"") and rancidly cliched (""You'd let both of us die just to keep your secret?"").Lindsay Lohan has shown the public that she has rotten judgement, but this movie is really the clincher. She gives a leaden, dazed performance, highlighted by a pole dance scene that is more comical than sexy. More capable actors -- such as Julia Ormond -- look like they're waiting for shooting to end, so they can collect their checks.""I Know Who Killed Me"" is the rotting turkey of the year, mingling mindless violence, turgidly silly dialogue, and a ""twist"" you can predict from the beginning.

The problem is here, is that she seems to be sleepwalking during a good portion of the film.  The only parts where she seems to even be getting into her role, is when she is playing the ""bad girl"" (cursing for no reason, the pole dancing, and seducing ""Aubrey's"" boyfriend).I liked the plot of the movie for a while.  It DID have you guessing for some time.  Is Aubrey crazy?  Is this girl really someone named Dakota?  Are the parents keeping a secret from Aubrey/Dakota? But when the answers are revealed, you will, I guarantee, be rolling your eyes.  It's not that the idea is THAT bad, it just seems like an easy bailout for someone who wrote this to not give it too much thought on how to wrap this up neatly.In essence, this could have been a much better film.  But it did not deserve the crucifixion it received in the press.

1106247,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B000W1SZ9U,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[1, 3]","After hearing so many negative things surround I KNOW WHO KILLED ME, my curiosity was immediately piqued. Carrying Lindsay Lohan, a once rising star whom had gained back my interest by a great performance in Emilio Estevez's Bobby, everybody seemed to universally pan her performance as well as the film itself saying it was stupid, relentless, unworthy, etc. I could only expect the worse though I prepared to like it as well because that usually ends up happening. The results on how I feel about this one are strange to say the least.Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) is a good high school senior who has her life set before her. She is abducted one night and returned days later with missing limbs that have been chopped off by a supposed serial-killer who had recently abducted another girl whom he had killed. These are the least of the problems. She now claims her name is Dakota Moss (also Lohan), a down-on-her-luck stripper, who has no idea who Aubrey or her family is or who in the world did this to her. As days begin to unravel, Dakota slowly reveals a mystery of Aubrey, whom she thinks may be her twin and that the two can experience each others pain. If she doesn't hurry and catch the real killer, the two may both end up with the same fate.I actually liked Lindsay Lohan's portrayal of Aubrey and Dakota. There was subtelty in the way both of them presented themselves but in the long shot you could see the difference between the characters from a long-shot and for me this ultimately helped not feel it was Lohan as many have attested. I was constantly trying to figure out whether the film would have a stupid ending in which it really was her the entire time but luckily it does not exist here. The main problem is simply that Lohan did not try. It seems like she didn't really care about either of their characters or their situation and thus her performance was mediocre but she did make the best of terrible dialogue. What's even worse is that she's the best of the entire cast.Everybody from Brian Geraghty to Julia Ormond, a seemingly grounded cast with plenty of experience to their names (or just as much as, if not more than, Lohan) flat out crash and burn with the horribly written dialogue. Characters such as the detectives are played truthfully but are such small roles overpowered by the badly portrayed ones that you don't even care at a certain point. Lohan did try to carry the film on her own but I think once she realized how poor everyone else was anyway there was no point in trying to actually make the film good no matter what she did.This film had a lot of potential, even if slightly unbelievable and with a terrible ending. The torture scenes were exactly what they were made for...torture. I was grinding my teeth while watching the scenes in which an innocent Aubrey is mercilessly tortured, they were so effective. You'll be thankful you have your limbs after this. The cinematography is also a redeeming quality. The beauty of the colors between the two characters, Aubrey being blue and Dakota being red, became a known entity to the audience even when they weren't sure what was happening to the characters and/or character. It was definitely overdone but the colors vibrancy and beauty in the scenes helped to save this.Despite setbacks, the film has redeeming qualities I felt picked up for the other parts. I gave it three stars because the film is one of those that you want to like but you're not sure if you like it or if you didn't. It's not a love or hate situation for this film it's either like or don't like. I chose to leave it as ok even though I wish I could decide whether or not I like it. People will be left scratching their heads at this. Lindsay can definitely look back at this and say, not where she went wrong, but where she has room to improve and I'm sure everyone else on the entire cast and crew is probably thinking the exact same thing.",3,To Catch a Killer,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,3915,"['hearing', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'things', 'surround', 'KNOW', 'WHO', 'KILLED', 'ME', 'curiosity', 'was', 'immediately', 'piqued', 'Carrying', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'once', 'rising', 'star', 'whom', 'had', 'gained', 'back', 'interest', 'great', 'performance', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Bobby', 'everybody', 'seemed', 'universally', 'pan', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'saying', 'was', 'stupid', 'relentless', 'unworthy', 'etc', 'could', 'only', 'expect', 'worse', 'prepared', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'up', 'happening', 'results', 'how', 'feel', 'one', 'are', 'strange', 'say', 'least.Aubrey', 'Fleming', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'good', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'life', 'set', 'abducted', 'one', 'night', 'returned', 'days', 'later', 'missing', 'limbs', 'have', 'been', 'chopped', 'off', 'supposed', 'serial-killer', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'abducted', 'girl', 'whom', 'had', 'killed', 'are', 'least', 'problems', 'now', 'name', 'Dakota', 'Moss', 'also', 'Lohan', 'down-on-her-luck', 'stripper', 'who', 'idea', 'who', 'Aubrey', 'family', 'who', 'world', 'did', 'days', 'begin', 'unravel', 'Dakota', 'slowly', 'mystery', 'Aubrey', 'whom', 'may', 'be', 'twin', 'two', 'can', 'experience', 'others', 'pain', ""n't"", 'hurry', 'catch', 'real', 'killer', 'two', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'fate.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'portrayal', 'Aubrey', 'Dakota', 'was', 'subtelty', 'way', 'presented', 'long', 'shot', 'could', 'see', 'difference', 'characters', 'long-shot', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'Lohan', 'many', 'have', 'attested', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'stupid', 'ending', 'really', 'was', 'entire', 'time', 'luckily', 'not', 'exist', 'here', 'main', 'problem', 'simply', 'Lohan', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'situation', 'thus', 'performance', 'was', 'mediocre', 'did', 'make', 'best', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'What', 'even', 'worse', 'best', 'entire', 'cast.Everybody', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'seemingly', 'grounded', 'cast', 'plenty', 'experience', 'names', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'Lohan', 'out', 'crash', 'burn', 'horribly', 'written', 'dialogue', 'Characters', 'such', 'detectives', 'are', 'played', 'truthfully', 'are', 'such', 'small', 'roles', 'overpowered', 'badly', 'portrayed', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'certain', 'point', 'Lohan', 'did', 'try', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'think', 'once', 'realized', 'how', 'poor', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'anyway', 'was', 'point', 'trying', 'actually', 'make', 'film', 'good', 'matter', 'what', 'did.This', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'even', 'slightly', 'unbelievable', 'terrible', 'ending', 'torture', 'scenes', 'were', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'made', 'torture', 'was', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'watching', 'scenes', 'innocent', 'Aubrey', 'mercilessly', 'tortured', 'were', 'so', 'effective', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thankful', 'have', 'limbs', 'cinematography', 'also', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'beauty', 'colors', 'two', 'characters', 'Aubrey', 'being', 'blue', 'Dakota', 'being', 'red', 'became', 'known', 'entity', 'audience', 'even', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'characters', 'and/or', 'character', 'was', 'definitely', 'overdone', 'colors', 'vibrancy', 'beauty', 'scenes', 'helped', 'save', 'this.Despite', 'setbacks', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'felt', 'picked', 'up', 'other', 'parts', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'one', 'want', 'like', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'love', 'hate', 'situation', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'chose', 'leave', 'ok', 'even', 'wish', 'could', 'decide', 'not', 'like', 'People', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'scratching', 'heads', 'Lindsay', 'can', 'definitely', 'look', 'back', 'say', 'not', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'where', 'room', 'improve', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'else', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'probably', 'thinking', 'exact', 'same', 'thing']",I Know Who Killed Me
1106248,A1FI7I5I956LO8,B000W1SZ9U,Gary L. Herstein,"[2, 5]","As noted in the title, this film is deeply flawed in its execution. I've given it three stars because the concept is interesting and the acting is not bad (at least in many places), and because fractions of a star are not an option.Some of what went wrong here was the decision on the part of the production people to compress the movie's concept into the abbreviated format of the standard horror/thriller genre. As a result, most of the development that could have lent the film some genuine intelligence never made it out of the editor's booth (assuming it ever made it in there to begin with). On the other hand, gratuitous amounts of time were devoted to Lohan being sultry and ""BAD"" -- which is a poor choice of art immitating life (or maybe its the other way around).I'm thinking Lohan can act, if her directors &/or studios will permit it, and if she can pry her head far enough out of her tail pipe to behave like a professional for a week or two. There are a few moments of real acting here, and not a few of them belong to Lohan. I hope she's able to find her way to behaving like an adult, and becoming a true master of her craft, as opposed to proving that there are really only tediously few ways of flaming out young.The story line is ultimately quite predictable, and there are some notable gaps in the narrative that would have been improved had the folks making the film trusted their audience to be something other than a pack of slack-jawed, drooling imbeciles. Or, perhaps more accurately, had said makers themselves been something other than a pack of slack-jawed, drooling imbeciles. Instead of playing for the intelligent possibilities in their basic concept and developing those possibilities with genuine care, they produced this. Furthermore, I really do *NOT* want to know -- now or ever -- who is the villain guilty of producing the music to this thing. If ever someone deserved to be bastanadoed ...Still, if you're a fan of the genre, it might be worth seeing once. The film does have its moments, and the very substantial weaknesses are (for the most part) not due to the actors involved. Some of the supporting roles -- including the mother and the female FBI agent -- showed a lot of promise. As does Lohan herself, but only if she can avoid the obvious forms of self-annhiliation and commit to becoming a genuine artist rather than a tabloid buffoon.",3,Deeply flawed -- 2 1/2 stars,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,2385,"['noted', 'title', 'film', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'execution', ""'ve"", 'given', 'three', 'stars', 'concept', 'interesting', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'least', 'many', 'places', 'fractions', 'star', 'are', 'not', 'option.Some', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'was', 'decision', 'part', 'production', 'people', 'compress', 'movie', 'concept', 'abbreviated', 'format', 'standard', 'horror/thriller', 'genre', 'result', 'most', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'lent', 'film', 'genuine', 'intelligence', 'never', 'made', 'editor', 'booth', 'assuming', 'ever', 'made', 'there', 'begin', 'other', 'hand', 'gratuitous', 'amounts', 'time', 'were', 'devoted', 'Lohan', 'being', 'sultry', 'BAD', 'poor', 'choice', 'art', 'immitating', 'life', 'maybe', 'other', 'way', '.I', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Lohan', 'can', 'act', 'directors', '/or', 'studios', 'will', 'permit', 'can', 'pry', 'head', 'far', 'enough', 'tail', 'pipe', 'behave', 'professional', 'week', 'two', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'real', 'acting', 'here', 'not', 'few', 'belong', 'Lohan', 'hope', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'behaving', 'adult', 'becoming', 'true', 'master', 'craft', 'opposed', 'proving', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'tediously', 'few', 'ways', 'flaming', 'out', 'young.The', 'story', 'line', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'predictable', 'are', 'notable', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'had', 'folks', 'making', 'film', 'trusted', 'audience', 'be', 'something', 'other', 'pack', 'slack-jawed', 'drooling', 'imbeciles', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'had', 'said', 'makers', 'been', 'something', 'other', 'pack', 'slack-jawed', 'drooling', 'imbeciles', 'Instead', 'playing', 'intelligent', 'possibilities', 'basic', 'concept', 'developing', 'possibilities', 'genuine', 'care', 'produced', 'Furthermore', 'really', 'do', '*NOT*', 'want', 'know', 'now', 'ever', 'who', 'villain', 'guilty', 'producing', 'music', 'thing', 'ever', 'someone', 'deserved', 'be', 'bastanadoed', 'Still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'very', 'substantial', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'due', 'actors', 'involved', 'supporting', 'roles', 'including', 'mother', 'female', 'FBI', 'agent', 'showed', 'lot', 'promise', 'Lohan', 'only', 'can', 'avoid', 'obvious', 'forms', 'self-annhiliation', 'commit', 'becoming', 'genuine', 'artist', 'rather', 'tabloid', 'buffoon']",I Know Who Killed Me
1106249,A2KYVZMNYCVLHT,B000W1SZ9U,Gina,"[1, 3]","I think Lindsay Lohan has potential as an actress. She did well in this one with the dialog she was given, but I've seen her in only one other movie (Georgia Rule). In both, she was a ""bad girl,"" but I've read that she considers herself a princess and is difficult to work with, so maybe this sort of thing isn't a problem for her because it's in character.SPOILERS AHEADI love psychological thrillers, but there were a lot of gaps and loose ends in this movie. What bothered me most was that the ending wasn't satisfying. It was easy enough to figure out that the piano teacher cut off their right hands and feet because that's what they most used for piano, and it was offensive to him that they wanted to drop out of piano classes. Perhaps some people have that sort of passion for teaching piano, but I hope not.Even in the alternate ending, it was never explained why the piano teacher had something similar to a meat house in his cellar, filled with prosthetics. He wasn't providing prosthetics to hospitals in the movie, so that didn't add anything as far as I'm concerned.If you want a really good psychological thriller, try Identity.

It's not often I see a truly horrible movie, but this was pretty close.The sad part is that this could have been a good movie.  It had a very interesting story to it.  It was certainly set up to be a thriller with a twist, like the 6th Sense.  Unfortunately it was executed very poorly.  In movies like this, they have to go about unfolding the plot in a certain way.  This movie didn't really do that in such an effective manner. It had nothing to do with the actors, but more with how they combined the scenes and wrote the script.  It could have been good, but it was just done poorly.The acting was really bad, to the point of being comical.  It was embarrassing.  I'm quite sure she'd like to shove it up under the rug and forget about it.  It reminds me of when that actress from Saved by the Bell was in ""Showgirls"".

Everything seems normal in her town until one of her friends gets kidnapped and murdered by a sadistic killer.  The killer gave the girl drugs to keep her awake.

However, Aubrey survives her encounter.  She turns up alive, but changed.  Just as the previous victim, Aubrey is missing her hand and leg.  But to make matters worse for her parents, (Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough), Aubrey is now calling herself Dakota; she claims to have no idea who Aubrey is.Her parents and the FBI seem to think that Aubrey is suffering from delusions due to her ordeal, but as the movie goes on, you'll see that there's a lot more to the Aubrey/Dakota story.Overall, I thought this was a very good movie.  I was impressed with the plot, and the twists and turns make watching the movie lots of fun.

She's found days later, barely alive and horribly mutilated.  She doesn't recognize her parents or her name - she insists she's a stripper named Dakota.  She goes home with Aubrey's parents to recuperate but is oddly uncooperative with the police investigation, claiming she never saw her kidnapper.  She starts having strange dreams, violent flashes of an attack she doesn't remember.This film has all the earmarks of a low-budget shockfest:  pointless nudity, slashing violence, and dialogue that is so corny it's  laughable.  The script is so convoluted and wacky that when I wasn't covering my eyes from the gore, I was rolling them at the dumb things the characters did and said (the crew from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have had a field day with this flick).I'm sure none of the actors will want to put this film on their resumes.  Lohan doesn't put much effort into her acting but does wear an excessive amount of eye make-up and Julia Ormond (Legends of the Fall) is wasted as her long-suffering mother.

I rented I know who killed me even though I had read the reviews on it, I also read the synopsis for the movie and decided I wanted to see for myself just how ""terrible"" it is. Let me tell you, 30 minutes into the movie I kept waiting for the terrible to happen. I thought the storyline was original and on a few occassions the acting is great but it is for the most part good. Although in the synopsis it says that Aubrey has a split personality and that Dakota is who she becomes after post traumatic stress, while even though in an alternate ending on the DVD this is true, it is not true. Everyone in the movie thinks that is what Aubrey is suffering from but we later learn that Aubrey and Dakota are identical twins. I thought the storyline was original and I liked the cinematography. Overall I was disappointed with others opinions of this movie. I think most people who have seen this movie are biased against Lindsay Lohan, they don't like the way she has been acting in her personal life or just don't think she is a good actress and have easily dismissed this as a terrible movie. As far as indie movies go this is not one of the instant cult classics such as Donnie Darko or Zerophillia but it was a good movie.

1106267,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000W1SZ9U,LadyLestat,"[5, 9]","I really didn't go into this movie with really high expectations, but the thought of Lindsay Lohan being tortured and dismembered all while she's awake peeked my curiosity. Truth be told, it  wasn't all that great, but it was nice to see Lindsay Lohan in something besides a Disney-esque type of movie, or some type of teen comedy. With that said, this movie is below average in every single way. I gave it 2 stars, and that was really being way too kind, but I did it because Lindsay plays a stripper. Beyond that little tidbit there's really nothing going on that you haven't seen many times before. It's just like with any other movie in this genre, you can expect another twin, the boyfriend or the husband really did it, amenesia, or split personalities. In other words, it's just that predictable. Plus, I hated the ending. This movie is basically about Aubrey Fleming, and Aubrey, gets kidnapped, tortured, mutilated, and left for dead. Shortly thereafter, Aubrey wakes up in the hospital only to find out that her whole arm and leg has been severed. Of course, the police need her to help them identify who did this to her seeing as how she's the only victim who's survived. I know it sounds like another Ashley Judd movie.. doesn't it? At any rate, Aubrey wakes up and claims she's no longer Aubrey, but her name is a stripper named Dakota Moss. Then, that brings forth certain questions like is she suffering from amnesia? is she lying? is she just delusional? does Dakota even exist or is she just a figment of Aubrey's imagination? or could she just be suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome? To find out the answer to those questions you'll have to watch the movie because I don't wanna spoil it. However, suffice it to say, I really don't think you'll be all that shocked. I conclude that you viewers who want an honest opinion rent this movie so you can take it back once you're done, but don't buy it because it'll be a waste of good money.",2,I know this movie SUCKED!,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,1963,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'really', 'high', 'expectations', 'thought', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'being', 'tortured', 'dismembered', 'awake', 'peeked', 'curiosity', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'something', 'Disney-esque', 'type', 'movie', 'type', 'teen', 'comedy', 'said', 'movie', 'below', 'average', 'single', 'way', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'was', 'really', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'kind', 'did', 'Lindsay', 'stripper', 'little', 'tidbit', 'really', 'nothing', 'going', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'genre', 'can', 'expect', 'twin', 'boyfriend', 'husband', 'really', 'did', 'split', 'personalities', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'predictable', 'hated', 'ending', 'movie', 'basically', 'Aubrey', 'Fleming', 'Aubrey', 'kidnapped', 'tortured', 'mutilated', 'left', 'dead', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Aubrey', 'up', 'hospital', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'whole', 'arm', 'leg', 'been', 'severed', 'course', 'police', 'need', 'help', 'identify', 'who', 'did', 'seeing', 'how', 'only', 'victim', 'who', 'survived', 'know', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'movie..', ""n't"", 'rate', 'Aubrey', 'up', 'no', 'longer', 'Aubrey', 'name', 'stripper', 'named', 'Dakota', 'Moss', 'Then', 'forth', 'certain', 'questions', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'lying', 'just', 'delusional', 'Dakota', 'even', 'exist', 'just', 'figment', 'Aubrey', 'imagination', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'suffering', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'find', 'out', 'answer', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'spoil', 'However', 'say', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shocked', 'conclude', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'honest', 'opinion', 'rent', 'movie', 'can', 'take', 'back', ""'re"", 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'waste', 'good', 'money']",I Know Who Killed Me

1106269,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000W1SZ9U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 11]","It is difficult and probably pointless to watch ""I Know Who Killed Me"" and not think about all of Lindsay Lohan's personal problems this past year.  When the DVD was loading and the obligatory boilerplate warning about the commentary track came up my mind immediately started a riff about Lohan doing such a track, wailing and moaning about how everybody is out to get her and wondering why nobody likes her.  The movie cost $12 million to make and grossed $7 million, but even though pretty much nobody went to the theater to see it last summer I am sure the studio will make back its money on those of us who rent it just to see the final nail in Lohan's acting career (maybe not forever, but at least for the foreseeable future).  I have the nasty suspicion that more people who hate Lohan will buy a copy of ""I Know Who Killed Me"" than will her fans.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, a budding pianist and high school student who disappears after a football game.  Several young women have been abducted from the area lately and the police suspect a sadistic serial killer who has been maiming his victims, which worries Aubrey's parents (Julia Ormond, Neal McDonough), and her boyfriend, Jerrod (Brian Geraghty).  The opening act of the movie fast forwards what would be your basic torture porn horror film to get to the point where Aubrey is found, but when she wakes up in the hospital and is confronted with the extent of her mutilation, she insists she her name is Dakota Moss (a poorly chosen name since it invites comparisons to both Dakota Fanning and Kate Moss that do nothing for Lohan).  I find this to be a rather interesting premise, to have a victim so traumatized by what has happen to them that they take refuge in another persona.  But this 2007 film wants to play with the idea that there is another explanation for what is going on here; in fact, it offers a couple of different hypotheses.Lohan's performance is pretty bad, which I think has to do with the fact that she is badly miscast here.  This film is also hurt by the scenes of Dakota as an exotic dancer because there is no nudity and the eroticism displayed by Lohan at the club is less than you would expect form a made for TV movie.  This ain't Demi Moore embracing her role in ""Striptease,"" that is for sure.  By the time Dakota shows up for a pole dance with nipples painted on her bustier, I was wondering if maybe the point is not that this is bad girl Dakota dancing but good girl Aubrey's simplistic idea of what dancing at a strip club is like.  The film's sex scene is quite bizarre for several reasons (e.g., the comic counterpoint with the mom cleaning the kitchen sink), but the paradoxical nature of sex in this film comes up again as her character keeps her bra on for most of it (something that is quickly becoming a cliche in movies).  I find this ironic, because I would double down on a bet that the next time Lohan appears on film she is going to have to do actual nudity because her next offer will be an exploitation film that fames this one look like classic cinema (i.e., yeah, it can get worse, Lindsay, a whole lot worse).The torture porn scenes are disquieting, but ultimately wrong for this movie, which needed to be done more in the Hitchock tradition than that of Eli Roth or whoever Chris Sivertson is trying to emulate.  Even then, I am not sure if that would work for a film that really is an exploitation film at heart, by which I mean that it is a twisted tale of the sort that exists only in grindhouse cinema.  If the story were the story here, instead of the lead actress, then maybe this movie would work better, but the movie is saddled with Lohan and the tragic farce her life has become, which overshadows such mundane concerns as whether anybody in the local police department ever bothered to check fingerprints.  But the story by novice screenwriter Jeff Hammond does try to do something different, and even if it ultimately fails in that regard it should at least be considered on its own merits.  The problem becomes that it takes us a long while to become convinced that this movie is about what it ends up being about; I was into last act before I finally understood it really was going in that direction.The special features on the DVD include not only an alternate opening and an alternate ending, but also an extended strip dance and bloopers (I am not making that order up).  I was almost tempted to take off another star on this train wreck just because of the special features, since the alternate ending speaks to a lake of artistic vision by the director and the extended strip dance qualifies as adding insult to injury.  The sexy dance is not sexy, the bloopers are not funny, and in the end the big quandry is whether in the final analysis ""I Know Who Killed Me"" was hurt or helped by Lohan's presence.  Of course, if this indeed proves to be Lohan's last film, the biggest irony would be how she has come full circle from her first one.",2,"Requiescat In Pace, Lindsay Lohan's acting

I was in an odd mood.  I thought it might lift my spirits to see a film in which Lindsey Lohan is tortured and mutilated.  I don't think it helped.  Director Chris Sivertson directed ""The Lost"" and the artistic masterpiece ""All Cheerleaders Die.""  Lindsay Lohan has starred in other films like ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Herbie Fully Loaded.""  This was a different genre for her.  She gets to play two twins Aubrey Fleming and Dakota Moss.  Aubrey is abducted and Dakota escapes the torturer and is returned to Aubrey's home.  Neal McDonough who was impressive in two short-lived TV series, ""Medical Investigations"" & ""Boomtown"" and was in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of our Fathers,"" does a good job as Aubrey's dad.  There is a secret in the family, which it takes an entire movie to uncover.  Julia Ormond who was lovely in ""Sabrina"" back in 1995 plays the mother Susan Fleming.  Mom is as an emotional basket case, set on the edge of her last nerve due to the horrific events.  She wants to make everything nice.  Her attempted cheerfulness was irritating.  I had hoped that Mom might take piano lessons along with her daughter.  The most fun in the film is when Aubrey's boyfriend, played by Brian Gerahgty (I think), gets a smile put on his face by Dakota.  This answers the question whether amputees can have fun.  (Sorry, that's such a bad joke.)  Michael Adler played Dr. Alex Dupree.  I also liked Aubrey's room with a thousand post-it notes on her wall for a play she was writing.  I'm not a big fan of the slice & dice genre.  I wondered what Lindsey Lohan would be like in this movie.  It was a movie that I entertained the notion of walking out on most of the time I was there.

1106271,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000W1SZ9U,Marc Cabir Davis,"[3, 5]","Watching Lindsay Lohan walk her way through this film, I was surprised she could actually ACT. Forget all the negative reviews on this page, ""I Know Who Killed Me"" is one of those fun B-Grade suspense flicks you catch on cable late at night. Don't approach it with anything other than that in mind, and you a fun time will be had.The premise is known - Lindsay Lohan disappears, kidnapped by a serial killer, but she is found, mutilated on the side of the road. The drama begins when the new Lindsay says that she's someone else and has no idea where the original Lindsay went. Some of the theories they threw our way here were ludicrous, but the 'twist in the tale' is so silly and unbelievable that most viewers would really have to hold it in to go with the flow.I'm not going to give you spoilers, but I must say that the direction was quite solid here - except for an empty, boring ten minute long scene of Lindsay as a stripper - which made me realize just how unappealing and unsensous she actually is in the flesh. The final five minutes ruined it though - the mystery is solved, and everything seems like it will go back to normal, but the final frames have no *it* factor, and serve to deflate the entire movie that came before it.This could have been a four star movie. Fond as I am of cheesy flicks like this one, even I was let down by the end. However, on the plus side, it was quite a revelation to watch Lindsay in perhaps her best screen role since ""Mean Girls"". She is quite an actress, and don't let her sordid real life turn you off.

This movie was one that I waited to come out on hbo because I wasnt sure I was going to like it. I was right.Warning-may contain spoilersAubrey Flemming and Dakota Moss are two separate people, but apparently after Aubrey is abducted, Dakota is the one that ends up in her spot, and no one can come up with the answer because their date of birth and all records are the same. The whole part where she tries to piece it together with her dad didnt make much sense to me as they were supposedly twins separated at birth, as the mother wouldnt know this? He gave it to a neighbor to raise? I am not sure what happened there. Enter the sadistic piano teacher who becomes the villian, but we cant really know why he is so angry apart from people who no longer want to take piano lessons?These arent even the worst parts or questions for the movie, its really the ending where she finally pieces it together in this confusing dramatic violent way. She suddenly realizes who killed her, and then she finds herself so to speak, aka audrey. Wow, by the end of this movie I was questioning along with the other reviewers of this movie, how it ended here.

Boy was I in for a suprise when I popped this piece of cinema in my DVD player. As soon as I got through the opening scene I said ""hmm this doesn't look like that other movie I saw preveiws for""... A few more minutes of watching and crap it's Linsey Lohan! What on earth have I done to deserve this? I never hurt anyone! I put the player on pause and sat in silence as I contempalted on my mistake. Thinking how I just wasted a good 5 bucks to rent this trash. I finally made up my mind that I was going to finish watching the film as punishment for my video store ignorance.The story I do my best to describe. Lindsay Lohan is a stripper whos finger randomly falls off (yes just like I said that's how it happens). She some how travels to a town she has never heard of by some type of intuition where everyone tells her she isn't who she thinks she is. That she is not some stripper with a foul mouth. More of Lindsay's body parts start falling off... I think her leg or something the film is to stupid to bother trying to remember. She meets a boy and they begin researching to identify the true Identity of Lindsay. They find out Lindsay is who she says she is a stripper from some dump and that she has a twin sister and that's who everyone was mistaking her for. Ironically her twin sister was burried alive or some crap and had the exact same injuries Lindsay had which is why linsdays finger and leg or what ever fell off. Then something happens with the plot and a pointless twist is revealed. Honestly the only twist of this film is that the ending credits didn't come up fast enough.This film is garbage! The acting was garbage! The story was garbage! This movie was just made to cash in on the Lindsay hype. The pointless story is on par with her pointless career. Needless to say I took this crap to the video store the very next day. I told the clerk I mistakenly thought it was another movie called ""The invisible"" (which I like an idiot found the title of later). She laughed at me and told me that I wasn't the only one that had been tricked. She pointed out the movie I meant to have rented. All I can say is lesson learned, and now I make sure to double check what I am renting. I can't imagine anything worse that picking up a Lindsay Lohan film by mistake.

There were fewer than a dozen viewers in the theater audience with me for a 10 PM Friday show.I have to go with The Washington Post on this one.This is not the kind of film that most critics like to like. I Know Who Killed Me is a gruesome little horror flick that sticks to the standards of the genre. Some of the torture scenes are graphic. Had it been made by one of the independent studios which specialize in B horror and sleaze, and starred a lesser known actress, the movie would not have been reviewed at all by any mainstream publication. Yet, if you are not expecting some other kind of movie, it really isn't bad. There are the required elements of suspense, sordidness, and revenge. Lindsay Lohan rose to the occasion and gave a perfectly credible performance (within the possibilities of the script) in both her roles.Miss Lohan's personal life may be untidy (hardly a rarity in her circles), but she actually is good at what she does. The opportunity to showcase her versatility may be why she chose this script. Perhaps one day she can show it again with a better one.",4,Surprisingly Acceptable Genre Film,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1564,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'tabloids', 'speculated', 'Miss', 'Lohan', 'antics', 'would', 'boost', 'ticket', 'sales', 'Perhaps', 'did', 'so', 'one', 'only', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'poor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise', 'critics', 'overwhelming', 'proportion', 'savaged', 'film', 'mercilessly', 'moviegoers', 'took', 'word', 'staying', 'away', 'vast', 'numbers', 'Stephen', 'Hunter', 'Washington', 'Post', 'was', 'rare', 'mainstream', 'exception', 'reviews', 'prompted', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'were', 'fewer', 'dozen', 'viewers', 'theater', 'audience', '10', 'PM', 'Friday', 'show.I', 'have', 'go', 'Washington', 'Post', 'one.This', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'most', 'critics', 'like', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'gruesome', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'standards', 'genre', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'Had', 'been', 'made', 'one', 'independent', 'studios', 'specialize', 'B', 'horror', 'sleaze', 'starred', 'lesser', 'known', 'actress', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'reviewed', 'mainstream', 'publication', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'other', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'required', 'elements', 'suspense', 'sordidness', 'revenge', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'rose', 'occasion', 'gave', 'perfectly', 'credible', 'performance', 'possibilities', 'script', 'roles.Miss', 'Lohan', 'personal', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'untidy', 'hardly', 'rarity', 'circles', 'actually', 'good', 'what', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'versatility', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'chose', 'script', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'show', 'again', 'better', 'one']",I Know Who Killed Me

Now you are probably asking, ""Then why did this chick give it three stars?""Three stars go to the original idea, which is actually very good. I'm sure that the script alone is quite enjoyable, though it needed to be revised a bit. The movie kind of jumps around (even though the plot is very obvious) and doesn't explain things. Too much time (almost two thirds of the film) is wasted on Dakota's recovery and initial attack. We get only a little insight into Aubrey's real life, and then all of a sudden we have the polar opposite. Only the last forty minutes of the movie are actually about Dakota solving the mystery! It's like reading a Sherlock Holmes book where only the last chapter solves the crime!Lohan disappoints me. She used to be very talented. It is extremely easy to tell when she is normal compared to when she is... out of it. She looks strung out and pale throughout most of the film. Lindsay does not portray a teenage prostitute very well. It just seems unnatural the way she cusses and smokes.The ending is odd. She cuts off the man's hand far too easily, and how did he tie her up with only one hand? Why did he put his hand on ice and then throw everything on the floor as if he didn't care? What's with the fake arms and legs?The root idea is good. The portrayal is sadly terrible. I think that in a few years this idea should be formed into a new (and much better) script and re-done by a new actress who has no acting rut formed yet as well as a new director...actually they need all new cast and crew!What I do have to say (nicely) is that the effects are actually very well-done, though that doesn't say much in today's world. When Aubrey's fingers are being cut off, the frozen skin looks very real (and I live in Alaska, so I've seen real frost-bite), though Lohan doesn't sound like she's in the massive agony she would be!If you are planning on re-doing a film (such as When a Stranger Calls was re-done, and made even more incredible) watch this movie. If you want to waste 100 minutes of your life, watch this movie. If you want to pull all your hair out and cut off your fingers but can't seem to find the right motivation, watch this movie.If you are a normal human being who just likes horror movies, watch Pet Sematary.

1106286,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000W1SZ9U,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 9]","""I Know Who Killed Me"" is a vile little horror outing that was designed as some sort of ""comeback"" vehicle for Lindsay Lohan back in early 2007.  Needless to say, the movie did not succeed in that endeavor.  Anything but.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive, but relatively naive high school student who falls prey to a torture-crazed serial killer who manages to slice off a few of her limbs before she miraculously escapes his clutches.  When she wakes up in the hospital, she believes herself to be a girl named Dakota Moss, some kind of fictional ""alter ego"" with a life straight out of a soft-porn novel - which provides us with ample opportunity to ogle the scantily-clad Lohan as she writhes around in slow-motion performing pole-dances at a sleazy strip joint.  Is Aubrey, who is herself a writer of fiction, simply a victim of repression, a wild and free spirit so obsessed with being a ""good little girl"" that she`s allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious all these years?  And is the trauma she's undergone simply the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore?  Or is there another, less purely psychological explanation - let's say, symbiotic twins? - for this sudden shift in identity?It doesn't really matter what the answers to those questions are, for this depressing foray into sadism, dismemberment and supernatural hocus pocus is poorly written, amateurishly acted and completely lacking in either thrills or common sense.  Actually, the story itself might have had some validity had it not forced the audience to wallow in as much gratuitous unpleasantness as it does.  But, as it is, whenever we begin to develop even the meagerest interest in what is happening, we're subjected to yet another round of stomach-churning bloodletting.

It's a beautifully shot, over-the-top mess that is endearingly trashy and unbelievable.  Lohan is barely there, and only during the dream sequences and flashbacks does she really come alive.  Everyone else is pretty boring in comparison, but it's her show so that's okay.  The clothes are flashy, the lighting is bright and colorful, the music is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann (there's even a cue from Vertigo during one of the dream sequences), and the (clothed) stripping scenes are electrifying, if a bit prudish.

1106293,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000W1SZ9U,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[9, 12]","Bombastically awful, Lindsey Lohan's latest project is by far the up and coming actress' worst career move yet. Not even trashy, porno styled strip teases and the voluptuous Lohan's first sex scene will attract audiences' attention away from this convoluted garbage being hawked as a movie. You know who killed me? Tristar Pictures, by releasing a film that is so terrible it honestly has to be seen to be believed.After being kidnapped and being subjected to the ever popular ""torture porn"", this time involving dry ice and amputation, Aubrey (Lohan) is discovered alive by the side of a dark rural road. Missing an arm and a leg, her parents rush to their daughter's hospital bed only to find that Aubrey appears to be having a major case of amnesia. The once intelligent, moral and musically talented Aubrey claims to be Dakota, a sleazy stripper from the city who never seems to have to remove her lingerie. Is it really amnesia, or is Dakota telling the truth and this truly is a case of mistaken identity?Incompetently directed by Chris Siverston, whose only notable credit includes helming a documentary of Tobee Hooper's straight to video flick The Toolbox Murders, the director seems to not have learned anything by observing the veteran horror filmmaker. Working off a contrived script from first time screenwriter Jeff Hammond, Siverston applies ridiculous style and lame-duck special effects to try and cover up the gaping plot holes, paltry cinematography, expository dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism.The film is so poorly shot that one has to give editor Lawrence Jordan credit for trying to create some kind of a narrative out of this nonsensical garbage. Sporting bizarre blue hues that clearly give away the film's whodunit mystery early in the game and more fade to black transitions than a student film, I Know Who Killed Me gets more absurd with each passing minute. Siverston doesn't even try to breathe a bit of self awareness or camp into the film, instead it takes it self dead seriously, killing the performance of the usually palatable Lindsey Lohan.With each passing moment the film becomes more illogical. Claiming not to have been kidnapped, but rather that her limbs magically atrophied and detached, Dakota starts to think that Aubrey could be her twin sister. In between sleeping with Aubrey's student/athlete boyfriend, Brian Geraghty who gawks in bewilderment as a naked Lohan acts out a trashy sex scene with one leg, Dakota starts investigating the phenomena of twins sharing traumatic injuries. Could this be the clue to her missing limbs or is this just a drug induced remake of Lohan's Parent Trap?Unlike her other films, where Lohan has looked adorably radiant, the dyed black hair, harsh lighting and off screen substance abuse have sadly taken a toll on the actress' once pleasing appearance and the bizarre screenplay murders any chance of her proven acting ability helping the film rise above these inconsistencies. I Know Who Kill Me is surprising only for the fact that the film should arouse sympathy for the actress. It really is that bad. However the film does walk a fine line between being entirely unwatchable and perhaps achieving a cult status for its trashiness, approaching the comedic genius of films like Showgirls.

1106294,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B000W1SZ9U,The JuRK,"[1, 3]","You can't put all the blame for this awful movie on Lindsay Lohan.Face it, any movie that features a jarring cameo by late-night wingnut radio host Art Bell to give an oddball angle to an already convoluted story is in serious trouble.Even after seeing Lindsay Lohan's chaotic, hard-partying life splashed on the tabloids and the Internet every week, I was still a little surprised by her appearance in this movie.  She looks older than she is and her voice is way too raspy to be playing an innocent high school student.  If you're renting or buying this movie to see her as a stripper, forget it.  TV movies of the week on regular television are more erotic (and revealing).The story?  I read the script before seeing the movie and I still had a tough time with it.  It's confusing, there isn't a sympathetic person in sight, the serial killer angle is gross and pointless.There wasn't one believable scene in this movie.  Limbs rot and drop off a twin because a serial killer mutilates the other.  Lightning strikes can be seen in a subterranean basement where no daylight is ever shown.  A 98-pound girl holds a powerful killer's arm in a door while she saws his hand off--and he apparently waits for her to finish.  What difference does it make if an artificial leg ""loses"" its battery?  It's still an artificial leg, right?  You could spend the entire movie pointing out the contrivances that keep this mess going.We have yet to see how many Razzies this bad movie will win (aren't they just before the Oscars?).

1106296,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000W1SZ9U,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 5]","I recall seeing the movie poster for ""I Know Who Killed Me"" last summer and thought it looked like it might be an interesting movie.  However I never found a movie theater that featured this film, so consequently I forgot about it.  The lack of exposure this film received is just more proof that odd or out of the box movies (regardless if they are good or bad) are not welcomed in many markets and/or movie theaters.  Then one day I saw it in the store on DVD and remember that I wanted to see it since it peaked my interest.  My girlfriend bought this movie for me as a Christmas present and this weekend was the first chance I had to watch it.I didn't hear any positive or negative things about this movie until it was released on DVD.  Most of the criticism I heard about this movie was negative.  The acclaim about ""I Know Who Killed Me"" and the performance of Lindsay Lohan gave it the most nominations in the 2007 Raspberry Awards.  For those of you who don't know what the Raspberry Awards are, it is the Academy Awards for movies that were really, really bad.  ""I Know Who Killed Me"" tops the nominations with nine, in 2007.  If ""I Know Who Killed Me"" wins the most Razzies is yet to be seen, when the awards are announced on 2/23/08.As for the movie itself, I didn't think it was as terrible as everyone is making it out to be.  I truly believe two things destroyed this movie.  The first is the catalogue of films Lindsay Lohan has already made, such as Disney and/or family movies.  The second is all of the ""drama"" happening in Lindsay Lohan's personal life, such as the drug use, in and out of rehab, multiple DUIs, car accidents, eating disorders and the list goes on and on.  I realize that art can be an imitation of life and vice versa.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that this movie was measured by not only the film quality, but Lindsay Lohan's personal issues.It might be difficult, but if one can remove all the ""stuff"" has happened to Lindsay Lohan and view the movie on its own two feet, a different experience could be revealed.  This is what I did when watching ""I Know Who Killed Me"".The plot is somewhat different than many mainstream/blockbuster films of today.  It resembles a mystery/suspense/neo-noir genre and has some non holistic qualities to it.  I am not going to put spoilers in this review or ruin the ending I don't think that is the point of a review.  What I will say about the plot is it is interesting and somewhat captivating. Basically, a high school girl named Aubrey (Lohan) disappears and is accosted by a killer.  She turns up about a week or so later (surviving the attack) and has no idea what happened to her.  Then to add insult to injury, Aubrey says that she isn't Aubrey, she says she is stripper named Dakota (Lohan).There are some twists and turns in this film that I found to be unexpected.  I felt for a moment the movie was going in one direction and thankfully it didn't.  I also found the score to be very haunting, but good.  This movie also did a wonderful job of using colors and lighting to create mood and symbolism.  I haven't seen this much emphasis on lighting since Dario Argento's ""Inferno"".Now I don't want to be misunderstood, there were some bad parts of this film.  There were some unbelievable things, like the recovery time of Aubrey/Dakota seemed a bit expedited and it was strange that a stripper never gets naked, sorry you will not see Lindsay nude in this movie.  However, the parts you see of her are nice.  The killer's motive seems a little out there, I know it is a (psychotic) killer and all, yet it still seemed strange.  Also in what school does a teacher allow a female high school student read an essay on the teacher's desk in a sultry way?  Just remember Aubrey reading her essay to the class.  In addition, the ending of the film seemed to happen too quickly and left many things open ended.Some of the performances were bad.  Lindsay Lohan didn't do that bad of a job acting, I would say it was an average performance.  However, it might also be strange watching Lindsay say the ""F word"" a thousand times and chain smoke.  After all, she is type casted as America's sweetheart perhaps that is why she took the role.  The guy who played Aubrey/Dakota's boyfriend was really an awful actor.  I wouldn't be shocked if he was also the same guy the camera crew used to do coffee runs.  Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough played Aubrey/Dakota's parents.  I felt both of them broke character many times throughout the film, which is shocking for Ormond and McDonough's hair looked fake to me the entire movie.  Gregory Itzin as Dr. Greg Jameson (others might know him as President Charles Logan from the television show 24) didn't do a bad job, yet wasn't in the movie enough to make a huge impact on it either way.In the Class of 2007 cinema, I think some of the following movies were much worse than ""I Know Who Killed Me"".* Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer* Hostel: Part II* License to Wed* Hannibal Rising (I believe the Hannibal pony is dead.)* Ghost Rider* Are We Done Yet?* Next* Ocean's Thirteen (How many are they really going to make?)* Evan Almighty* Transformers (Why?  Why?  Why?)* Halloween (Did this movie really need to be remade?)* P.S. I Love YouIn conclusion, I don't feel that ""I Know Who Killed Me"" was that appalling.  It wasn't the greatest film, but it did have uniqueness about it.  I suggest watching the movie and omit all that tabloid junk about Lindsay Lohan and what ""popular movie critics"" say about modern cinema.  Then try to develop your own real opinion of ""I Know Who Killed Me"".  As for the DVD, it comes with some bloopers (not that great), a new opening scene (looked no different than the one used in the final cut), an alternate ending (interesting) and an extended strip scene (it was pretty good).  On a final note, this movie did receive a bit more praise in the realm of home video, based off the money it made when compared to the theater ticket sales.So Lindsay, get well and make some more non cookie cutter films.",3,The tabloids & lack of exposure killed this movie......,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,6066,"['recall', 'seeing', 'movie', 'poster', 'Know', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Me', 'last',
