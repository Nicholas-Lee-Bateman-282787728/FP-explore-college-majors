1430458,A3U0YG0SAEGIDN,B004W75BS8,B. Green,"[0, 0]","Peach Girl is about a girl, Momo, struggling to fit in and find love. She has major insecurities about her look as she is deeply tanned (an unappealing trait in Japanese culture) and more brawny then most girls. Her differences are made worst in comparison to her so called best friend, Sae, who is fair skinned and petite. Sae uses Momo insecurities to her advantage and does everything in her power to make life difficult for Momo. Thing come to a head between them when Momo starts falling for a guy, Toji. Toji and Momo  start falling in love and that is where the series gets interesting. Sae, to spite Momo, start turning everybody in school against Momo particularly Toji. Momo has a surprise champion in Kairi, a carefree boy that harbor deep feelings for Momo.  Momo soon becomes torn between Toji and Kairi.The anime is about self discovery, trust, redemption, and hard choices in life. It does deal with adult themes so probably not suitable for young ones. While it can feel soap opera-ish at times, it true does have a captivating story line. I would strongly recommend this series as it was satisfying (it has a true end that wrap up all the main plots unlike some anime) and the story moved on quickly - no dragging parts causing viewer to become frustrated because the plot is not moving forward.

1430460,A2OULD3S8OZYMH,B004W75BS8,L'Etranger,"[0, 0]","The drama feels sometimes a bit forced and melodramatic, and a few characters needed a little more ""dimension"" to them (i.e., is Sae selfish, sneaky, and evil ALL the time?). However, midway through the series, things started picking up a bit, even if it was a really weird scenario of blackmail to get things going. Towards the end, the viewer gets used to the characters and the show becomes as addictive as a daytime soap (or nighttime sitcom). That the show is 26 episodes had me worried since I'm used to shows that are at least twice that length, but in this instance I think the writers did a good job of editing and putting everything neatly for the allotted time. If the writing had been a tad bit sharper and less ""rushed,"" I'd have given it a higher rating. Ironically, I was a bit bored by the slow pacing of Strawberry Panic's first half of the series, but felt this show flowed too fast at times and wished they had expounded upon certain situations.The animation looked alright; it took some getting used to and there were some choppy sections here and there, but did not affect the enjoyment of the series. What helped was the use of slapstick and character expressions. Additionally, the two theme songs are cute and the Japanese voice actors were good. I think if the animation was better, I'd probably rank it a bit higher.I was wondering where this series had gone to. For a moment, I thought the rights to distribute it in North America had expired (and Amazon went ahead and deleted all previous versions of the series on dvd). So, who would I recommend this for? I'm definitely not the average viewer for this sort of programme. I'd say this is more apt and fitting for the intended audience of ""tweens"" (e.g., the same kids who watch Degrassi: The New Series, iCarly, and such). There may be a few situations that require some explanation, but the overall subject material in this show is inoffensive and tame.",4,This series is just peachy...,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1934,"['drama', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'forced', 'melodramatic', 'few', 'characters', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'dimension', 'i.e.', 'Sae', 'selfish', 'sneaky', 'evil', 'time', 'However', 'midway', 'series', 'things', 'started', 'picking', 'up', 'bit', 'even', 'was', 'really', 'weird', 'scenario', 'blackmail', 'get', 'things', 'going', 'Towards', 'end', 'viewer', 'used', 'characters', 'show', 'as', 'addictive', 'daytime', 'soap', 'nighttime', 'sitcom', 'show', '26', 'episodes', 'had', 'worried', ""'m"", 'used', 'shows', 'are', 'least', 'twice', 'length', 'instance', 'think', 'writers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'editing', 'putting', 'everything', 'neatly', 'allotted', 'time', 'writing', 'had', 'been', 'tad', 'bit', 'sharper', 'less', 'rushed', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'rating', 'Ironically', 'was', 'bit', 'bored', 'slow', 'pacing', 'Strawberry', 'Panic', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'felt', 'show', 'flowed', 'too', 'fast', 'times', 'wished', 'had', 'expounded', 'upon', 'certain', 'situations.The', 'animation', 'looked', 'alright', 'took', 'getting', 'used', 'were', 'choppy', 'sections', 'here', 'there', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'What', 'helped', 'was', 'use', 'slapstick', 'character', 'expressions', 'Additionally', 'two', 'theme', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'think', 'animation', 'was', 'better', ""'d"", 'probably', 'rank', 'bit', 'higher.I', 'was', 'wondering', 'where', 'series', 'had', 'gone', 'moment', 'thought', 'rights', 'distribute', 'North', 'America', 'had', 'expired', 'Amazon', 'went', 'ahead', 'deleted', 'previous', 'versions', 'series', 'dvd', 'So', 'who', 'would', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'average', 'viewer', 'sort', 'programme', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'apt', 'fitting', 'intended', 'audience', 'tweens', 'e.g.', 'same', 'kids', 'who', 'watch', 'Degrassi', 'New', 'Series', 'iCarly', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'situations', 'require', 'explanation', 'overall', 'subject', 'material', 'show', 'inoffensive', 'tame']",N/A

1430466,AKCY6EK2ZLV7A,B004W75BS8,Sarah,"[0, 0]","This has to be the ultimate shoujo manga so i feel I must write about it. A very popular manga by Miwa Ueda; in 1999 it won the Kodansha manga award for shoujo manga.Although, I never read the manga, I did watch the 25-episode anime. The story is about a high school girl named Momo Adachi. A lot of people criticize her because she has very tanned skin and bleached out hair. They think of her as a ganguro*** girl. This is not true since Momo is part of the swim team and that is how she gets tanned (also she has skin that tans rather quickly).Since junior high Momo has always liked one of her classmates Toji who she thinks is a very nice and open minded guy especially since he sticks up for her when other guys are trying to refer to her as a promiscuous girl(because of her unintentional ganguro look).The only close friend Momo made in her class so far is Sae, a very a manipulative girl who happens to look innocent. Sae has absolutely no self esteem. She is very jealous of Momo and will do anything to be like Momo from buying the same hair clip to a purse to even the same boy.Momo's life gets even more complicated when she meets a senior student at her school named Kairi Okayasu. Kairi really likes Momo. Since Kairi has a reputation of being a ""playboy"" Momo never takes his feelings for her seriously and also she only has eyes for Toji.Sae's jealousy level rockets and Sae decides that she has to do anything she can so she can have Toji for herself. First, Sae spreads nasty rumours about Momo throughout the school even a rumour about how Momo is cheating on Toji with Kairi.During all this turmoil, Momo has nobody except Kairi, who knows what a nasty person Sae really is, and always tries to cheer up Momo when she is down.While watching the anime, I started to get really upset because Sae was really making me angry (lol); she was such a big time crazy liar...but I decided I really do like the anime because there are so many twists in the story line and has a lot of character development. You never know what will happen and who Momo will end up with. Although, I'm not a big fan of the artwork, the story does make up for it. It's really a page turner (or a wanting to sit at your computer all night and watch the anime).***Ganguro (copied and pasted from wikipedia:) In ganguro fashion, a deep tan is combined with hair dyed in shades of orange to blonde, or a silver gray known as ""high bleached"". Black ink is used as eyeliner and white concealer is used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often added to this. Platform shoes and brightly-colored outfits complete the ganguro look. Also typical of ganguro fashion are tie-dyed sarongs, miniskirts, and lots of bracelets, rings, and necklaces.The deep ganguro tan is in direct conflict with traditional Japanese ideas of feminine beauty. Due to this, as well as their use of slang, unconventional fashion sense, and perceived lack of hygiene, ganguro gals are almost always portrayed negatively by the Japanese media.",4,The ultimate shojo manga/anime,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,3050,"['be', 'ultimate', 'shoujo', 'manga', 'i', 'feel', 'must', 'write', 'very', 'popular', 'manga', 'Miwa', 'Ueda', '1999', 'won', 'Kodansha', 'manga', 'award', 'shoujo', 'manga.Although', 'never', 'read', 'manga', 'did', 'watch', '25-episode', 'anime', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Momo', 'Adachi', 'lot', 'people', 'criticize', 'very', 'tanned', 'skin', 'bleached', 'out', 'hair', 'think', 'ganguro***', 'girl', 'not', 'true', 'Momo', 'part', 'swim', 'team', 'how', 'tanned', 'also', 'skin', 'rather', 'quickly', '.Since', 'junior', 'high', 'Momo', 'always', 'liked', 'one', 'classmates', 'Toji', 'who', 'very', 'nice', 'open', 'minded', 'guy', 'especially', 'up', 'when', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'trying', 'refer', 'promiscuous', 'girl', 'unintentional', 'ganguro', 'look', 'only', 'close', 'friend', 'Momo', 'made', 'class', 'so', 'far', 'Sae', 'very', 'manipulative', 'girl', 'who', 'look', 'innocent', 'Sae', 'absolutely', 'self', 'esteem', 'very', 'jealous', 'Momo', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'Momo', 'buying', 'same', 'hair', 'clip', 'purse', 'even', 'same', 'boy.Momo', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'senior', 'student', 'school', 'named', 'Kairi', 'Okayasu', 'Kairi', 'really', 'Momo', 'Kairi', 'reputation', 'being', 'playboy', 'Momo', 'never', 'feelings', 'seriously', 'also', 'only', 'eyes', 'Toji.Sae', 'jealousy', 'level', 'rockets', 'Sae', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'Toji', 'herself', 'First', 'Sae', 'nasty', 'rumours', 'Momo', 'school', 'even', 'rumour', 'how', 'Momo', 'cheating', 'Toji', 'Kairi.During', 'turmoil', 'Momo', 'nobody', 'Kairi', 'who', 'what', 'nasty', 'person', 'Sae', 'really', 'always', 'tries', 'cheer', 'up', 'Momo', 'when', 'down.While', 'watching', 'anime', 'started', 'get', 'really', 'upset', 'Sae', 'was', 'really', 'making', 'angry', 'lol', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'time', 'crazy', 'liar', 'decided', 'really', 'do', 'anime', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'story', 'line', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'who', 'Momo', 'will', 'end', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'artwork', 'story', 'make', 'up', 'really', 'page', 'turner', 'wanting', 'sit', 'computer', 'night', 'watch', 'anime', '***Ganguro', 'copied', 'pasted', 'wikipedia', 'ganguro', 'fashion', 'deep', 'tan', 'combined', 'hair', 'dyed', 'shades', 'orange', 'blonde', 'silver', 'gray', 'known', 'high', 'bleached', 'Black', 'ink', 'used', 'eyeliner', 'white', 'concealer', 'used', 'lipstick', 'eyeshadow', 'False', 'eyelashes', 'plastic', 'facial', 'gems', 'pearl', 'powder', 'are', 'often', 'added', 'Platform', 'shoes', 'brightly-colored', 'outfits', 'complete', 'ganguro', 'look', 'Also', 'typical', 'ganguro', 'fashion', 'are', 'tie-dyed', 'sarongs', 'miniskirts', 'lots', 'bracelets', 'rings', 'necklaces.The', 'deep', 'ganguro', 'tan', 'direct', 'conflict', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'ideas', 'feminine', 'beauty', 'Due', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'slang', 'unconventional', 'fashion', 'sense', 'perceived', 'lack', 'hygiene', 'ganguro', 'gals', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'portrayed', 'negatively', 'Japanese', 'media']",N/A

Or if you're a fan of soap operas in general, this is the show for you.This story is about an insecure, naive high school girl named Momo who is madly in love with a boy named Touji and she is also the love interest of another boy named Kairi. Her love life faces many problems mainly due to her narcissistic rival, a manipulative girl named Sae. Due to constant swimming and being a lifeguard, Momo's skin is permanently tanned which is a source of ridicule for her from the other classmates. Rumors spread, sides are taken, and boyfriends are stolen. Yeah, you get the picture of how this anime goes. It's a messy roller coaster ride of misunderstandings, hidden romances, deceptive people, and indecisive, jealous guys and gals. Soap opera to a 'T'.That is the norm for Momo and the boys she juggles her feelings around. All the while trying to overcome Sae's lies and schemes.I watched this anime because I was bored and wanted to see something new. It wasn't bad at first, but I was dreading continuing it because it was all too mushy and I'm sorry, downright ridiculous. Three episodes in and I was wondering what I had gotten myself into. I peeked back in 13 episodes later and it didn't get much better. I've never seen so much flip-flopping in ANY relationship. Not even in American soap operas. (Though I never care for them.) The two most evil people in the show, Sae and Kairi's older brother Ryo, never even get a proper comeuppance. Insults and few slaps on the face? Seriously? (Momo is also slightly dense and a little too forgiving of Sae.)I give this anime points for its beautiful animation and voice acting though. (I was taken aback at how pronounced the characters' lips are. I don't think I've ever seen such designs in many anime shows.)Like I mentioned before, if you like soaps and mushy romance, go ahead and pick this series up for yourself. If not, pass it up.
