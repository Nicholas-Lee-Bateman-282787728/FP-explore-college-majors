That being said, I love Michael Moore's work... Usually.Sadly, this season doesn't pack as much bite as the first. Once again, Mike moves to Times Square (a la TV Nation) to host his show. He seemed to pick fights that were not as clear as the first season, and that got him into trouble.Also, Michael fell to his biggest weakness (again) this season. For some reason, he believes all ""pro-life"" people are abortion clinic terrorists, when the vast majority do not support that action. This seemingly pet issue with him always comes back. Normally, he really seems to have his sites on helping the little guy. This year, he seemed just plain bleeding heart.I didn't appreciate him bothering BMW American offices over the Holocost payouts. BMW-USA has nothing to do with it, as almost everyone there is American and outside of the main corporate dealings. That was unfair and rude to those people. Go to Germany if you want to talk about those issues, Mike! You brought them here for one of your skits.In fact, more issues this year seemed to be those types of fights, where he was bothering the wrong people.Oh, the skits! They were horrid! The bookie odds were dumb (bring back the real surveys!), and the skits seemed more degrading than funny to those it was supposed to 'enlighten'.I loved the first season, and have it proudly on my shelf. I now have the second, and I think I'm gonna sell it. There isn't enough interesting for me to keep it.",3,Not quite the First season....,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,1560,"['Let', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'look', 'centrist', 'generally', 'respect', 'conservatives', 'more', 'liberals', 'being', 'said', 'love', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'work', 'Usually.Sadly', 'season', ""n't"", 'pack', 'as', 'much', 'bite', 'first', 'Once', 'again', 'Mike', 'Times', 'Square', 'la', 'TV', 'Nation', 'host', 'show', 'seemed', 'pick', 'fights', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'first', 'season', 'got', 'trouble.Also', 'Michael', 'fell', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'again', 'season', 'reason', 'pro-life', 'people', 'are', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'terrorists', 'when', 'vast', 'majority', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'action', 'seemingly', 'pet', 'issue', 'always', 'back', 'Normally', 'really', 'have', 'sites', 'helping', 'little', 'guy', 'year', 'seemed', 'just', 'plain', 'bleeding', 'heart.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'bothering', 'BMW', 'American', 'offices', 'Holocost', 'payouts', 'BMW-USA', 'nothing', 'do', 'almost', 'everyone', 'American', 'outside', 'main', 'corporate', 'dealings', 'was', 'unfair', 'rude', 'people', 'Go', 'Germany', 'want', 'talk', 'issues', 'Mike', 'brought', 'here', 'one', 'skits.In', 'fact', 'more', 'issues', 'year', 'seemed', 'be', 'types', 'fights', 'where', 'was', 'bothering', 'wrong', 'people.Oh', 'skits', 'were', 'horrid', 'bookie', 'odds', 'were', 'dumb', 'bring', 'back', 'real', 'surveys', 'skits', 'seemed', 'more', 'degrading', 'funny', 'was', 'supposed', ""'enlighten'.I"", 'first', 'season', 'have', 'proudly', 'shelf', 'now', 'have', 'second', 'think', ""'m"", 'gon', 'sell', ""n't"", 'enough', 'interesting', 'keep']",N/A

What they may not realize is that getting in people's faces and bearing down is Moore's stock in trade.  He will not let something go, whether it is pursuing the CEO of GM (""Roger and Me"") or following the threads of the Columbine school massacre (""Bowling for Columbine"").  In this series he gets in a multiplicity of faces, all with hilarious results.  This tv work may be Moore at his funniest.  My favorite episode is where he sends a pimp to Congress, to organize them.  The pimp perceives all of the members as the equivalent of his stable of women and that Congresspeople need his skills every bit as much as ""his girls.""  The pimp Moore hires to do this is absolutely deadpan as he ""talks the talk"" in front of every Congressperson he accosts.  They look like deer caught in the headlights of a car.  I could watch this episode alone over and over again.  The other episodes are hilarious as well.  He runs a ficus plant for office, ably demonstrating why vegetation is better than the human being up for re-election.  He plants a bogus dead body on the street to see which country's people are more humanitarian (we're up against Canada--anyone want to place bets?).  He ""re-educates"" a potential police candidate who did too well on the department's written exam and was turned down from the force for being too intelligent. He presents George ""W"" as America's biggest example of Affirmative Action--being from a powerful family that can buy his way into things that he can't get into on his own merits.  Obviously, Moore's favorite targets are anyone of the conservative American political persuasion so if that description is you, this series may offend you mightily.

683581,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00005U8ES,Jason N. Mical,"[37, 39]","Chances are, if you're considering this DVD purchase, then you're familiar with Michael Moore.  The renegade filmmaker behind Roger and Me returns for the second season of his Emmy-nominated documentary TV show &quot;The Awful Truth.&quot;  It ran on Bravo! in the summer of 2000, and Moore returns to his familiar Times Square setting for more of his guerilla-style harassment of all things nasty.Moore's satirical fist knows no friends: he takes stabs at both major political parties (note to Conservatives: just because he bashes you doesn't mean he doesn't bash Liberals, too!), goes after screwy judicial systems, the mainstream media, religious nutjobs, and even himself.  Some of his stunts include driving a taxi in New York that refuses to pick up white people, sending a pimp to Congress (to make the point that politicians who whore out votes in exchange for campaign contributions are &quot;hos&quot;), importing Iraqi gas and selling it for 60 cents a gallon, and a new short film: Ficus, in which he runs a ficus plant for an uncontested Congress nomination (and, by all counts, WINS).  This season is much more hit-and-miss than the first season, with some episodes, like the pimp, worth watching over and over, while others are pretty darn boring.  But, all in all, there's certainly enough here to justify this 2-disc set.The video is presented in crisp full-frame, which makes sense because most of it was shot digitally.  The sound mix is a strong DD 2.0, standard TV-show fare - there isn't enough here to really rock the old subwoofer anyway, and the mix is more than adequate.  The only extras are some Bookie segments that didn't appear on TV, and Michael Moore's commentary on four of the episodes.  His commentary is hilarious and informative, which is generally what I'd expect from Mike.  The only disappointment is that Awful Truth episodes ran 60 seconds longer in the UK, and it would have been cool to see that extra footage, but hey, it's a minor complaint.So sit back, pop in this DVD, and get ready to think.  Rather than succumb to the fallacies of those he satirizes, by offering easy, cookie-cutter, bumper-sticker answers, Moore is content raising questions and letting us work through them on our own.  It's a sign of maturity, intellect, and a true desire to change the world: people are more apt to work for themselves when they figure out the answers to problems on their own, instead of listening to MSNBC, chubby radio talk-show hosts, or the 700 club for the &quot;cheat-sheet&quot; solutions.  It's refreshing, and well worth your time.  But beware: you might get a little ticked off when you learn the Awful Truth.",4,More Moore,1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,2661,"['Chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'considering', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'then', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'renegade', 'filmmaker', 'Roger', 'Me', 'returns', 'second', 'season', 'Emmy-nominated', 'documentary', 'TV', 'show', 'quot', 'Awful', 'Truth.', 'quot', 'ran', 'Bravo', 'summer', '2000', 'Moore', 'returns', 'familiar', 'Times', 'Square', 'setting', 'more', 'guerilla-style', 'harassment', 'things', 'nasty.Moore', 'satirical', 'fist', 'friends', 'stabs', 'major', 'political', 'parties', 'note', 'Conservatives', 'just', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'bash', 'Liberals', 'too', 'screwy', 'judicial', 'systems', 'mainstream', 'media', 'religious', 'nutjobs', 'even', 'stunts', 'include', 'driving', 'taxi', 'New', 'York', 'pick', 'up', 'white', 'people', 'sending', 'pimp', 'Congress', 'make', 'point', 'politicians', 'who', 'whore', 'out', 'votes', 'exchange', 'campaign', 'contributions', 'are', 'quot', 'hos', 'quot', 'importing', 'Iraqi', 'gas', 'selling', '60', 'cents', 'gallon', 'new', 'short', 'film', 'Ficus', 'ficus', 'plant', 'uncontested', 'Congress', 'nomination', 'counts', 'WINS', 'season', 'much', 'more', 'hit-and-miss', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'pimp', 'worth', 'watching', 'others', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'boring', 'certainly', 'enough', 'here', 'justify', '2-disc', 'set.The', 'video', 'presented', 'crisp', 'full-frame', 'sense', 'most', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'sound', 'mix', 'strong', 'DD', '2.0', 'standard', 'TV-show', 'fare', ""n't"", 'enough', 'here', 'really', 'rock', 'old', 'subwoofer', 'anyway', 'mix', 'more', 'adequate', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'Bookie', 'segments', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'TV', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'commentary', 'four', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'hilarious', 'informative', 'generally', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Mike', 'only', 'disappointment', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'ran', '60', 'seconds', 'longer', 'UK', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'see', 'extra', 'footage', 'hey', 'minor', 'complaint.So', 'sit', 'back', 'pop', 'DVD', 'get', 'ready', 'think', 'Rather', 'succumb', 'fallacies', 'offering', 'easy', 'cookie-cutter', 'bumper-sticker', 'answers', 'Moore', 'content', 'raising', 'questions', 'letting', 'work', 'own', 'sign', 'maturity', 'intellect', 'true', 'desire', 'change', 'world', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'apt', 'work', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'answers', 'problems', 'own', 'instead', 'listening', 'MSNBC', 'chubby', 'radio', 'talk-show', 'hosts', '700', 'club', 'quot', 'cheat-sheet', 'quot', 'solutions', 'refreshing', 'well', 'time', 'beware', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'ticked', 'off', 'when', 'learn', 'Awful', 'Truth']",N/A

There's plenty of Moore's typical in-your-face style as he confronts his favorite targets, corporate America, with frequent police intervention.

The contest: which country would first investigate the dead person on the ground?
