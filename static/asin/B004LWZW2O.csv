Prescott, Gale Weathers-Riley, and Dewey Riley once again team up to stop the murders, but not before having to learn from a new generation the ""new rules"" of surviving horror films.

Estes,"[2, 5]","When the ""Scream"" trilogy wrapped itself up nicely at the turn of the century, it seemed like it was one of the few franchises that would stay down. Well, money talks and certain other things walk and here we are in 2011 with ""Scream 4"" (typeset ""Scre4m""). Once again directed by Wes Craven and scripted by Kevin Williamson, this fourth installment in the teen-slasher series/pop-culture phenomenon brings the core cast of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox-Arquette and David Arquette back to Woodsboro for yet another round with Ghostface.It's more than ten years later. Everyone's a little older, a little wiser. Dewey and Gale, like their real-life counterparts, are now married and settled into small town life in their hometown of Woodsboro. Finishing the last leg of her self-help book tour, Sidney returns to her old stomping grounds, sans demons and visions of dead mothers. Faster than you can say ""I'll be right back!"" local kids start dying off in a familiar fashion and before long it's up to our heroes to take a page from the younger generation (consisting of Rory Culkin, Hayden Panetierre and Emma Roberts) and try to figure out the new rules of the genre and put a stop to whoever is the Ghostface de jour.The film takes plenty of well-deserved jabs at the horror genre's current obsession with remakes and faceless torture fare, but never does it acknowledge its own short-comings. As fun as a reunion of the ""Scream"" crew is, the whole feels recycled and surprisingly formulaic. Sure, the humor is there (and kept in check much better than in ""Scream 3"") and the kills are as surprising as they are grisly, at least by teen-slasher standards (a return to the original ""Scream""). Regrettably, the film never breaks from the formula set by the original trilogy which makes bringing it back to life at this stage in the game a bit of a cheat. Sure, the generation that grew up with ""Scream"" being their ""Friday the 13th"" will find much to celebrate with the belated sequel and of course it's a boatload of guilt-free fun, but once you get past the surface, ""Scream 4"" is exactly the kind of film Randy from the original film(s) would have torn to ribbons.",3,"Let's Face it, Baby: These Days You Gotta Have a Sequel!",1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,2165,"['When', 'Scream', 'trilogy', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'turn', 'century', 'seemed', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'franchises', 'would', 'stay', 'down', 'Well', 'money', 'talks', 'certain', 'other', 'things', 'walk', 'here', 'are', '2011', 'Scream', '4', 'typeset', 'Scre4m', 'Once', 'again', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'scripted', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'fourth', 'installment', 'teen-slasher', 'series/pop-culture', 'phenomenon', 'core', 'cast', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Courtney', 'Cox-Arquette', 'David', 'Arquette', 'back', 'Woodsboro', 'yet', 'round', 'Ghostface.It', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Everyone', 'little', 'older', 'little', 'wiser', 'Dewey', 'Gale', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'settled', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'hometown', 'Woodsboro', 'Finishing', 'last', 'leg', 'self-help', 'book', 'tour', 'Sidney', 'old', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'sans', 'demons', 'visions', 'dead', 'mothers', 'Faster', 'can', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', 'local', 'kids', 'start', 'dying', 'off', 'familiar', 'fashion', 'long', 'up', 'heroes', 'take', 'page', 'younger', 'generation', 'consisting', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'new', 'rules', 'genre', 'put', 'stop', 'whoever', 'Ghostface', 'jour.The', 'film', 'plenty', 'well-deserved', 'jabs', 'horror', 'genre', 'current', 'obsession', 'remakes', 'faceless', 'torture', 'fare', 'never', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'short-comings', 'As', 'fun', 'reunion', 'Scream', 'crew', 'whole', 'feels', 'recycled', 'surprisingly', 'formulaic', 'Sure', 'humor', 'there', 'kept', 'check', 'much', 'better', 'Scream', '3', 'kills', 'are', 'as', 'surprising', 'are', 'grisly', 'least', 'teen-slasher', 'standards', 'return', 'original', 'Scream', 'Regrettably', 'film', 'never', 'formula', 'set', 'original', 'trilogy', 'bringing', 'back', 'life', 'stage', 'game', 'bit', 'cheat', 'Sure', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'Scream', 'being', 'Friday', '13th', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'celebrate', 'belated', 'sequel', 'course', 'boatload', 'guilt-free', 'fun', 'once', 'get', 'surface', 'Scream', '4', 'exactly', 'kind', 'film', 'Randy', 'original', 'film', 's', 'would', 'have', 'torn', 'ribbons']",N/A

The original Friday the 13th and Friday the 13th part 2 showed the virgin thing isn't true. Does a woman who drinks beer, smokes weed and plays strip Monopoly qualify as pure as the driven snow virgin? Didn't Yaphett Kotto live at the end of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, which came out YEARS before Scream did.When Scream came out, all of a sudden, all the Masters of Horror (Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Stephen King, etc) Had to come out and defend their work and point out the obvious good qualities of their work.

1414753,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B004LWZW2O,amerdale876,"[5, 9]","What's great about the latest (and hopefully, last) installment is writer Kevin Williamson's two messages he is trying to convey to the audience. The first is how society can turn a tragedy where real people die into some sick, fun celebration in which younger generations celebrate. The second is how screwed up our society is where fame is the most important thing and most people will do whatever they can to achieve it. However, that's where the ""greatness"" ends. For the first message, when Sidney Prescott (Campbell) returns to Woodsboro, the kids have hung Ghostface costumes all over the town, and the kids have a ""Stab""-a-thon to commemorate the murdering of real people. And the characters who are killed spouting off a one-liner before they die (i.e., ""^#@* Bruce Willis"" and ""But you can't break the rules. I'm gay. If that means anything"")? Funny? Not so much. As for the second message, at the end of the movie, the killer confesses to Sidney, ""I don't need friends; I need fans ... Well, sick is the new sane. You had your fifteen minutes, now I want mine! I mean what am I supposed to do? Go to college? Grad school? Work? Look around. We all live in public now; we're all on the internet. How do you think people get famous anymore? You don't have to achieve anything! You just got to have ****ed up ^#%@* happen to you."" In an age where some get famous for nothing (ANY person on a reality show, particularly the Kardashians and anyone on the MTV, E!, Oxygen, and Bravo channels), it's Williamson's smart voice through his killer that says something is sick about our society. Then again, ""sick is the new sane,"" I guess.Still, other than the aforementioned messages, this movie pretty much stinks. I think the worst thing a movie company can do is make a sequel to a horror movie; they almost always completely bomb! Sure, they may make money (the only true driving force behind greenlighting making a film), but the story and ""staying true"" to the mythology ends up suffering. The only exceptions of good horror sequels are the originalHalloween [Blu-ray] andAlien [Blu-ray]. Otherwise, pretty much every sequel is just an insult to your intelligence; especially in the ""Scream"" franchise. Part two was OK and I could see that happening, but Part 3 and this one, I don't think so! And the killer in this one!?!? I don't think the producers of ""Scream"" have any choice to make another sequel; with this one, they've used up every possible, somewhat ""believable"" explanation for the killer. I believe all horror movies should stick with just a ""Part One"" and no more.Scream [Blu-ray] was a welcome re-awakening of the horror genre. But, with ""Scream 4,"" even with Williamson and Wes Craven involved, a once innovative horror franchise has become a sorry joke; it's just an excuse to make a new horror film for younger audiences. But the crew is just insulting us fans who have been there from the beginning. As Williamson wrote himself at the end of this one -- and I believe this best exemplifies my stance on ""Scream 4"": ""You forgot the first rule of remakes. Don't **** with the original.""",2,Second verse same as the first! And the third.

1414755,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW2O,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","1996 is such a guilty pleasure type of a year for me.  No matter how many `important' films I see from that year, my heart is always drawn back to that handful of Blockbusters that made a giant splash in with the box-office and won the hearts of the general public.  Whether we're talking about De Palma's avant-garde approach to Ethan Hunt, Baz's brilliant take on Shakespeare or that 60's inspired slice of crowd pleasing pie, `That Thing You Do', I'm sold.  I bought the ticket.  I'm in the seat.  I'm smiling WIDE.  There is another film that made a huge dent the world of cinema that was released that very same year.  Wes Craven's magnum opus; `Scream'.  I know that is a pretty big statement to make, but there are few films PERIOD that have had the same effect on modern cinema as `Scream' has.  The effect has not always been a good one, sure, but it was a BIG one and it still makes ripples in cinema even today, fifteen years after it was originally released.In the latest installment of this series we are reunited with the surviving members of the original `Scream' yet again for a bloody good time.  Instead of trying to create something brand new, `Scream 4' takes on the idea of remaking the original, only with new technology.  A lot of the scenes and plot points and murders are ripped straight from the 1996 original, only with a little tweak here and there to represent the year in which this was made.  So, expect Facebook references and webcams capturing the murders in real time.  Where this is an interesting idea on the outset, it does at times feel redundant and a tad stale.  I wasn't wholly impressed with the way that the party sequence played out.  For as much as they are trying to `one up' the original (a concept stated with obviousness quite a bit) they don't really do that.  Instead they regurgitate scenarios that lack the same wow factor that saturated the original.Remember the garage door scene in the original `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.  Do you remember Drew Barrymore's opening scene in `Scream'?  So much more terrifying than the one in `Scream 4'.I'll give `Scream 4' the twist factor, since it was one I didn't expect considering that there were so many other variable options for a killer that seemed more obvious and then when the killer is revealed it seems the most obvious of all, which is rather fascinating in a way.  But, the film's desire to prove a point about instant celebrity status and the obvious deterioration of today's youth is lost in the killer's monologue, which is delivered in a near comical fashion that comes off somewhat stupid.

AFter, I realized that this is just as good, if not better, than the original, and definetly better than 2 or 3. It was very well directed, couldn't have a better cast of actors, super modern, and had an amazing ending you'll never see coming. The only reason I think some people won't like it is because the idea of slasher movies has changed since the 80's and 90's, in order to work they now have to be funny as well of scary.

1414759,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B004LWZW2O,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 6/12Rate: 56/12: Having seen two films made after 2010, one per year, Scream 4 is my first for the year of 2011 which shows my extreme lack of interest in today's cinema. Nobody knows how to make a movie anymore. Even the standards in acting are at an all-time low with no signs of the bottom yet. The motto in Hollywood nowadays is to disregard everything and focus on the bottom line: profits.Now, having seen the first three of the Scream quadrilogy with each subsequent film substantially much worse than the original, I found the fourth part to be the best by inches, even better than the original. Scream 4 was a lot fresher and smarter than the previous three. However, my biggest gripe about it was the apparent lack of psychological trauma among characters. When a person dies, either intimate or strangers, others do become affected and numbed by the shock of it. But in the film, it's almost as if it's just an everyday occurrence...no big deal. That's why Scream 4 sucked. The worst part of the film undeniably went to the fifteen minute ending. Actually, the chief reason why I got the film was to guess who the killer was. Okay, that's fine...but the actual reasons, what a snooze fest. I think the death scenes in Scream 4 had been done to show the uniqueness of them yet the audience was so desensitized that it didn't matter how it was done. Besides, they were a lot better done during the heyday of 1980's horror films. Another peeve I have with Scream 4 was Dewey. He acted like a moron for a cop. Speaking of cops, where were they around Woodsboro? After three times, the audience would get the sense that everybody would be a lot experienced in knowing how to deal with the situation. And then, what was Sidney Prescott doing back in her old town? After two or three times, it would have made sense for her to enter the Witness Protection Program and changed her name. Dumb idiots. Where was the media? They would be crawling all over the town at this day and time, considering how much emphasis had been placed on these kind of things. Finally, one more idiot in the picture...Gale Weathers. Hey Gale...shut the hell up and sit the hell down. All in all, Scream 4 worked, but it's too clever (or should I say...stupid?) for its own good.",3,Wes Still the Master of Suck and...Stupid!,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,2267,"['Viewed', '6/12Rate', '56/12', 'Having', 'seen', 'two', 'films', 'made', '2010', 'one', 'year', 'Scream', '4', 'first', 'year', '2011', 'extreme', 'lack', 'interest', 'today', 'cinema', 'Nobody', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'anymore', 'Even', 'standards', 'acting', 'are', 'all-time', 'low', 'signs', 'bottom', 'yet', 'motto', 'Hollywood', 'nowadays', 'disregard', 'everything', 'focus', 'bottom', 'line', 'profits.Now', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'Scream', 'quadrilogy', 'subsequent', 'film', 'substantially', 'much', 'worse', 'original', 'found', 'fourth', 'part', 'be', 'best', 'inches', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'Scream', '4', 'was', 'lot', 'fresher', 'smarter', 'previous', 'three', 'However', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'was', 'apparent', 'lack', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'characters', 'When', 'person', 'intimate', 'strangers', 'others', 'do', 'become', 'affected', 'numbed', 'shock', 'film', 'almost', 'just', 'everyday', 'occurrence', 'big', 'deal', 'why', 'Scream', '4', 'sucked', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'undeniably', 'went', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'ending', 'Actually', 'chief', 'reason', 'why', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'guess', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'Okay', 'fine', 'actual', 'reasons', 'what', 'snooze', 'fest', 'think', 'death', 'scenes', 'Scream', '4', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'show', 'uniqueness', 'yet', 'audience', 'was', 'so', 'desensitized', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'Besides', 'were', 'lot', 'better', 'done', 'heyday', '1980', 'horror', 'films', 'peeve', 'have', 'Scream', '4', 'was', 'Dewey', 'acted', 'moron', 'cop', 'Speaking', 'cops', 'where', 'were', 'Woodsboro', 'three', 'times', 'audience', 'would', 'get', 'sense', 'everybody', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'experienced', 'knowing', 'how', 'deal', 'situation', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'doing', 'back', 'old', 'town', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'enter', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'Program', 'changed', 'name', 'Dumb', 'idiots', 'Where', 'was', 'media', 'would', 'be', 'crawling', 'town', 'day', 'time', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'emphasis', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'kind', 'things', 'Finally', 'one', 'more', 'idiot', 'picture', 'Gale', 'Weathers', 'Hey', 'Gale', 'shut', 'hell', 'up', 'sit', 'hell', 'down', 'Scream', '4', 'worked', 'too', 'clever', 'should', 'say', 'stupid', 'own', 'good']",N/A

I did feel that Dewey's female partner was a bit looney at times.  She had a huge crush on Dewey, which was weird. Some of the other actors were just your average teenage victims waiting for the usual kill. Nothing exciting in particular with their performances.

1414761,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B004LWZW2O,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 6]","When I walked out of the theater in 1996, after seeing the first ""Scream"", I had a smile a mile wide on my face. As a little kid who gorged himself on horror/slasher films in the 80s, 'Scream' came along and gave a fan like me something they wanted, and had missed from the genre for a very long time. I have never quite had that feeling coming out of a horror movie since. Now, in 2011, after having just seen the latest entry, I can honestly say this....that mile wide smile is back!Spoiler free....15 years have passed since the original Woodsboro massacre, and 11 years since the last time we saw our three survivors. Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell) has returned to her old town in quite some time. She has written a book and her old hometown is the last stop on her book tour. There, she reunites with Dewey(David Arquette), now Sheriff, and Gale Weathers(Courteney Cox), who is married to Dewey and at a loss as what to do with herself. Sidney is staying with her Aunt Kate(Mary McDonnell), and cousin Jill(Emma Roberts). Of course, once Sidney shows up, so does Ghostface, and a whole new slew of bloodletting happens. This is awful, but it's good news for Gale, who sees it as an opportunity to get her life back on track.It's a neat and believable premise, and sets up our returning trio well. So, let's start there. Neve's Sidney is a real fighter here. Campbell gives a wonderful performance, and shows how much Sidney has grown. Even though she is perceived as the perennial victim, she no longer is in this one. Here, Sidney is the one running to the killer instead of running away. Besides the fact that she looks great, she also shows real bravery, and has a crowd cheering/pleasing moment/line. Sadly, David Arquette, still loveable as Dewey, gets short shrift the most. He gives it his all, but Dewey is relegated to racing to and fro crime scenes. It's his better half, however, who rocks the most. Courteney Cox steals the show. Her Gale Weathers is definitely back and is at her, well, rhymes with ""wichiest"" best. She has a smaller part than 2 and 3, more aking to 1, and she owns every scene she is in.As for the new blood, Hayden Panettiere as Kirby will most undoubtedly be the fan favorite. She is sassy, cool, and, um, hot. Emma Roberts is a nice addition to the series as Jill. Personable, cute, sweet. She handles her role very well. Most of the others do well, but don't have much in the way of development. Mostly there to be red herrings. Mary McDonnell was completely wasted, but Adam Brody, Anthony Anderson,  Alison Brie, and Marley Shelton all have their moments.So, is it good? Yes! ""Scream 2"" was a good movie. An exceptional sequel. ""Scream 3"" was, well, it was what it was. Scream 4 easily beats 3, of course, and I think it just may trump part 2 as well. Seriously. The movie has a lot of jokes at the expense of movies like ""Saw"", as well as the media and the search for fame. I think Scream 4's message this time around is not only it's timeliest, but also it's best. The end reveal, and motive, really works for me because it's true. You see it in the media, in celebrities, and in pop culture. Kevin Williamson really got it with what he was saying, and it really resonates. It's definitely better than the motives for 2 and 3. Maybe up there with 1. Maybe better than 1. I will need more viewings to make sure. Of course, the self-referrential treatment that is Scream's hallmark is all there, and while it takes it's shots at remakes/re-boots, endless sequels, and torture porn, it takes shots at itself, like ""Scream 2"" did. However, the movies does occassionally fall into the things it's making fun of or commenting on. A lot of the dialogue is pure Williamson, and while most is clever and witty, some of it, mostly with the ""meta"" of it, gets kinda confusing. Scream 4 is also the most violent of the series. The kills themselves are nothing out of the ordinary(with 1 or 2 exceptions), but the way in which Ghostface goes about it is a lot more deadly, a lot more brutal, and a lot bloodier. Ghostface is definitely at his best here.Flaws? Sure. Every movie has them. Where Scream 4 isn't as sharp as the original is in it's characters. The original trio is great, and so are Hayden and Emma. The rest are just kind of there(with Marielle Jaffe getting the least to do). Not as much character development here as in 1. Also, there isn't as much playing around. Past Scream films usually had a certain structure. It's 'mostly' still in tact, but played with a little. Except for a moment here and there, that slow-burn build up to a death is mostly absent. It's replaced with quick jumps and stabbings. This didn't really bother me, but I do appreciate the way it was done in the past films. There are a lot of characters. Maybe too many. A large body count too. Maybe too many. The flaws I have aren't much, and in no way did anything to ruin the movie for me.In the end, ""Scream 4"" is a blast. A wild ride. Horror/slashers have not been fun in a long time. This movie brings the fun back in a bif way. The classic opening scene is a gas. Nothing will top Drew Barrymore, but this is second best. The ending(s)are wild and crazy. For the most part, the movie doesn't let up. It's sharp, witty, entertaining, bloody, and a complete and total blast. It has surprises, twists and turns, and some things you didn't see coming. I certainly didn't see some things coming. It is everything a Scream movie should be, and much, much better than anyone would ever think a part 4 would ever be. Go see it. Get some popcorn. Have fun in the theaters again. Oh yeah....what's your favorite scary movie?",4,Craven & Co.

It is in keeping with the first three, although of course it's kinda sad seeing the actors getting older...but they did do a good job. The ending was the best part.If they continue the Scream movies they need to start fresh with new actors. That is sad to say but they are too old now to be playing the part. I DO have to give props to the actors for not trying to act like who they were...nothing more sad than older actors trying to act young. They all very appropriately acted their age. It could have very easily been a bad, bad, movie if they hadn't. It's kinda like the Star Trek movies. After this movie cameos should be their limit (although I love all of them!)The plot and twists and turns were interesting and kept you guessing.

I have to say that I didn't know what to expect from this movie, as I had loved the first three, but I wasn't sure how this one would measure up. After a couple movies, trilogies, which become franchises, typically get a little stale and lose originality.I was glad to see that Scream 4 was still great. They keep the horror movie commentary coming, which is what the original movies were so revered for. I really appreciated that they kept a linear plotline with this movie, aka Sidney comes back and becomes the victim again. They did a great job of continuing the story, but also of making a new one simultaneously. The film pans out really well, and I have to say that the ending was a surprise, at least for me.The reason that I gave this four stars is that it seemed to lack a little &#34;something.&#34; I can't quite put my finger on it, but it didn't feel as intense as the original trilogy.I have to say, though, that the bonus features are great, notably the alternate opening and extended ending.

SCREAM makes a surprising comeback after a decade away from the screen, teaming series creator Kevin Williamson with Wes Craven once more in what is easily the best sequel in the franchise. The new script is just as sharp as Ghostface's knife, never missing an opportunity to poke fun at modern Horror trends or the series, itself. Some of the greatest moments are achieved by exacerbating the concept of the metafilm to the point of lunacy, essentially creating a film about making a film about a film about films. The tagline promises a ""New Decade. New Rules."" As we have come to find out from the previous films, the only New Rule is that SCREAM breaks all the rules. Plot contrivances aside, the film legitimately keeps the audience guessing until the very end, never knowing which cliche will be the next to suffer. Williamson has taken a clever approach to the remake as only the SCREAM films can, using the remake as an integral plot device towards something wholly original. While it is still as sappy and pretentious as each of the earlier entries, SCREAM 4 is equally entertaining for fans of the series. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette are each at home in their returning roles, and even the newcomers earn passing grades. One can only hope that the inevitable sequels continue to uphold the same level of intelligence and humor shown in this fourth film.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews: Scream 4,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1652,"['ever-growing', 'popularity', 'Horror', 'remake', 'not', 'escaped', 'tragic', 'town', 'Woodsboro', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'return', 'home', 'new', 'series', 'murders', 'have', 'been', 'fashioned', 'first', 'encounter', 'Ghostface', 'killer', 'SCREAM', 'surprising', 'comeback', 'decade', 'away', 'screen', 'teaming', 'series', 'creator', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'once', 'more', 'what', 'easily', 'best', 'sequel', 'franchise', 'new', 'script', 'just', 'as', 'sharp', 'Ghostface', 'knife', 'never', 'missing', 'opportunity', 'poke', 'fun', 'modern', 'Horror', 'trends', 'series', 'greatest', 'moments', 'are', 'achieved', 'exacerbating', 'concept', 'metafilm', 'point', 'lunacy', 'essentially', 'creating', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'film', 'films', 'tagline', 'New', 'Decade', 'New', 'Rules', 'have', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'previous', 'films', 'only', 'New', 'Rule', 'SCREAM', 'rules', 'Plot', 'contrivances', 'aside', 'film', 'legitimately', 'audience', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'never', 'knowing', 'cliche', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'suffer', 'Williamson', 'taken', 'clever', 'approach', 'remake', 'only', 'SCREAM', 'films', 'can', 'using', 'remake', 'integral', 'plot', 'device', 'something', 'wholly', 'original', 'still', 'sappy', 'pretentious', 'earlier', 'entries', 'SCREAM', '4', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'fans', 'series', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'David', 'Arquette', 'are', 'home', 'returning', 'roles', 'even', 'newcomers', 'earn', 'passing', 'grades', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'inevitable', 'sequels', 'continue', 'uphold', 'same', 'level', 'intelligence', 'humor', 'shown', 'fourth', 'film.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

I'm a great fan of the original Scream trilogy, like many ppl here, and I was so excited when Scream 4 was announced. I went with my cousin last night, and had a blast. The opening was the best one since the original with Drew Barrymore.Truly suprising and definately didn't see that coming. I really liked Kevin Williamson's script in this one...pure genius. It was major geekasms for me when the remakes and reboots started getting made fun of. :D One of my fav parts was when Kirby was naming off all of them remakes to Ghost Face. LOL! I found the humor in this one more present than Scream 1 and 2. I haven't seen Scream 3 in over 10 years, so I'll have to rewatch that one to compare, but I remember it being funnier than the first two, but overall disappointing. Kevin Williamson wasn't the script writer, so...go figure. Anyway...back to Scream 4: the humor is so alive, the witty dialogue was great, and the killings/killer(s) are ever so brutal and viscious. The reveal of the killer(s) was an amazing twist, and I absolutely had no idea who it was going to turn out to be. What's even more amazing was the final act that takes place in the hospital. Now THAT was suspenful...the best part of the movie besides the over the top opening.I give Scre4m 4 stars instead of five because of the motive for the killings. It just seemed too stupid and unbelievable. It was a total joke....and not in line with the motives of the previous killers. Well...Scre4m is jokey and funny, so ..I don't know if that was what they are going for or not. Probably satirizing all the silly motives from other slashers. Other than that, Scre4m is a great return to the awesome franchise, and I enjoyed seeing Sidney, Gail, and Dewey again...and the new cast is oh so hot! Especially Trevor. He is hot!

1414779,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B004LWZW2O,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","When I heard a new Scream movie was in the works, I have to admit I was kind of excited. Even though we're in the days where franchises and remakes seem to be all that comes out, especially with horror, the Scream films were always fun for me and have always managed to be both distinct and entertaining. I think there's a reason these films brought back the slasher in the 90s and became such successful horror films.Scream 4 manages to keep the same spirit of the original trilogy. It seems the filmmakers really like to make fun of both themselves, and the horror film industry, more and more in each installment. Scream 4 takes the horror movie humor up a notch with lots of movie references and plenty of intentionally pretentious film nerd characters.The big concern of mine with the film was how the story would go. I mean, how many more killers can there be? And hasn't Sidney Prescott been through enough? Well Kevin Williamson managed to play it nicely, putting Sidney on a book tour that ends with Woodsboro. She stays with her aunt (Mary McDonnell) and her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). It's not long before the ""What's your favorite scary movie?"" phone calls start coming in and the Ghostface killers starts picking off new victims.The new killer chooses to do a ""remake"" of his own by patterning the killings after the in-movie Stab films, which are based on the Woodsboro killings. The audience shouldn't spend too much time thinking about the movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie... stuff, it may drive you crazy! I thought this idea was good, and while predictable at first, it managed to throw a few surprises in there.The film entertained me as much as the previous films. It's clear Craven has a passion for these films as the style and spirit remains faithful to the other three films. I wouldn't have been surprised if the movie was dumbed down, exploitive of its attractive young cast, and hastily mashed together to cash in off a successful series, but it kept it real. I would even say that this is probably the bloodiest of the films.It was great to see the three original cast members, and I was pleasantly surprised by the newest additions. I'm convinced most of the imperfections with the film are intentional, as the movie makes it very clear that it is having fun at the expense of itself and other horror movies. With that said, I can't say much bad about the film. While the story had quite a few faults and parts that I thought were a little careless, it achieved what I think the filmmakers intended. Scream 4 combined equal parts humor and horror that ultimately makes for a fun horror movie about horror movies.Source: criticnic.com 15-October-2011",3,Fun horror movie about horror movies,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2682,"['When', 'heard', 'new', 'Scream', 'movie', 'was', 'works', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'kind', 'excited', 'Even', ""'re"", 'days', 'where', 'franchises', 'remakes', 'seem', 'be', 'out', 'especially', 'horror', 'Scream', 'films', 'were', 'always', 'fun', 'have', 'always', 'managed', 'be', 'distinct', 'entertaining', 'think', 'reason', 'films', 'brought', 'back', 'slasher', '90s', 'became', 'such', 'successful', 'horror', 'films.Scream', '4', 'manages', 'keep', 'same', 'spirit', 'original', 'trilogy', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'make', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'industry', 'more', 'more', 'installment', '4', 'horror', 'movie', 'humor', 'notch', 'lots', 'movie', 'references', 'plenty', 'intentionally', 'pretentious', 'film', 'characters.The', 'big', 'concern', 'mine', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'go', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'killers', 'can', 'there', 'be', ""n't"", 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'been', 'enough', 'Well', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'managed', 'play', 'nicely', 'putting', 'Sidney', 'book', 'tour', 'Woodsboro', 'aunt', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'cousin', 'Jill', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'not', 'long', 'What', 'favorite', 'scary', 'movie', 'phone', 'start', 'coming', 'Ghostface', 'killers', 'picking', 'off', 'new', 'victims.The', 'new', 'killer', 'chooses', 'do', 'remake', 'own', 'patterning', 'killings', 'in-movie', 'Stab', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'Woodsboro', 'killings', 'audience', 'should', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'thinking', 'movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie', 'stuff', 'may', 'drive', 'crazy', 'thought', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'predictable', 'first', 'managed', 'throw', 'few', 'surprises', 'there.The', 'film', 'entertained', 'as', 'much', 'previous', 'films', 'clear', 'Craven', 'passion', 'films', 'style', 'spirit', 'faithful', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'dumbed', 'down', 'exploitive', 'attractive', 'young', 'cast', 'hastily', 'mashed', 'together', 'cash', 'off', 'successful', 'series', 'kept', 'real', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'probably', 'bloodiest', 'films.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'three', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'newest', 'additions', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'most', 'imperfections', 'film', 'are', 'intentional', 'movie', 'very', 'clear', 'having', 'fun', 'expense', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'bad', 'film', 'story', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'faults', 'parts', 'thought', 'were', 'little', 'careless', 'achieved', 'what', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'intended', 'Scream', '4', 'combined', 'equal', 'parts', 'humor', 'horror', 'ultimately', 'fun', 'horror', 'movie', 'horror', 'movies.Source', 'criticnic.com', '15-October-2011']",N/A
1414780,A2EE7SEM9F9QB2,B004LWZW2O,Cryptic Critic &#34;Kevin&#34;,"[0, 1]","Or is it the beginning of the end? That's what went through my mind when I left the theater opening night. I'd been anticipating the release of ""Scream 4"" since I learned it was going to happen. Courteney Cox, Neve Campbell and David Arquette had all chosen to reprise their respective roles. Wes Craven in the director's seat and original screenwriter Kevin Williamson writing the script? What wasn't there to love?Quick plot run down: Sidney (Neve Campbell) is now the author of a self-help book and has returned to Woodsboro for a book signing on the last date of her book tour. Her arrival in town also gives her the chance to reconnect with her estranged Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). It just so happens that two teenage girls were murdered the night before--the eve of the anniversary of the original Woodsboro Massacre. This, of course, unnerves Sidney as she realizes that after 10 years--since the murders in ""Scream 3""--it's happening AGAIN. So much for a peaceful homecoming.Not much more can be revealed without spoiling the film for those who have yet to see it. What I will say, is if you haven't seen ""Scream,"" ""Scream 2"" or ""Scream 3"" in a long time, you don't have to in order to understand or follow the events of ""Scream 4."" If you want to view all the predecessors before hand, that's fine, but in a way ""Scream 4"" feels like a separate film altogether. The surviving characters from the three previous films have changed: Dewey (David Arquette) has since become the town Sheriff whereas Gale (Courteney Cox) has hung up her microphone and is now an embittered housewife with writer's block.The new cast fits in perfectly. None of them felt like the typical, clich&eacute;, cookie-cutter throw-away caricatures that often litter the lineup of a horror film. The standouts, to me, were: Nico Tortorella as Trevor and Hayden Panettiere as Kirby. The ending was a complete surprise. What a twist! I did not see it coming at all. I kept thinking: ""It CANNOT end like this."" Another twist shortly thereafter allowed the film to end on a very high, more satisfying note.Could it be a set up to a fifth or sixth film, possibly making this a new trilogy? I certainly wouldn't mind it. Perhaps in ""Scream 5"" we'll get to meet Sidney's relatives from her father's side of the family. Who knows?

1414781,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZW2O,C. Sawin,"[4, 5]","The first three Scream films are pretty vital to the horror genre. The original film shot this extra dose of adrenaline into slasher films and brought interest to slashers when most were beginning to think it was a tired genre. Truth be told, it probably is. Most conceptions about the horror genre being terrible are true. Enjoyment can be found in terrible films, but great gore doesn't always make up for bad acting and a terrible story. But every once in a while, a film comes along with a solid cast and is written well enough to remind people why they love the genre that they do. That can technically be said for any genre, but Scream did it for horror fifteen years ago and Scream 4 could very well do it again.The most important part of Scream 4 is that it actually feels like a Scream film. Despite the cast being filled with mostly new recruits, they get sucked into the killings rather easily and it only makes predicting the killer that much more difficult to do. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette all slide back into their respective roles without any trouble at all. The ""new rules"" aspect of the film is probably the most refreshing breath of life the sequel could possibly offer. Nearly everything the original films went by is shattered. Virgins can die now, saying, ""I'll be right back,"" doesn't matter; this veil of uncertainty is automatically drawn over how you think the film could play out. There is more than one time in the film where you think you have the identity of the killer figured out before being swerved into thinking it's somebody else. Scream 4 already broke the mold by being a third sequel in an endless array of nothing but less than spectacular remakes, but it manages to poke fun at the genre in an intelligent way while also putting a new spin on a story audiences already know that they love.With all of the really good things going for Scream 4, there's bound to be at least one downfall. There's such an emphasis on the, ""new rules,"" concept of the film, that you'd expect the film to go in an unexpected direction. But when it finally has the opportunity to take the franchise and its future sequels in a completely new and unseen direction, Scream 4 circles back around to put the threequel back on a path its traveled three times before. Do you remember the first time you saw Speed? It had an ending that just kept going. You thought it was going to end once they got off the bus, but we still had yet to venture into the subway, see Sandra Bullock with a bomb strapped to her chest, witness Dennis Hopper get decapitated, and watch Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock make out in the leftover destruction. Scream 4 does something similar (minus all the bombs, buses, making out, and Dennis Hopper) and while it's great that the film keeps you guessing and takes you for a ride that lasts longer than you expect it to, it really should have stuck with ending fifteen to twenty minutes earlier than it did.Scream 4 is the bloodiest, most suspenseful, and most unpredictable Scream entry yet. It's also one of the best horror films to be released theatrically in the first few months of 2011. Despite a few misfires, mostly lying within its finale, Scream 4 is an intelligent sequel that not only continues its trend of poking fun at other horror movies but also offers a fantastic cast, some great kills, and will keep you guessing until the identity of Ghostface is finally revealed.",4,"A bloody, intelligent, and unpredictable sequel",1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,3444,"['first', 'three', 'Scream', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'vital', 'horror', 'genre', 'original', 'film', 'shot', 'extra', 'dose', 'adrenaline', 'slasher', 'films', 'brought', 'interest', 'slashers', 'when', 'most', 'were', 'beginning', 'think', 'was', 'tired', 'genre', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'probably', 'Most', 'conceptions', 'horror', 'genre', 'being', 'terrible', 'are', 'true', 'Enjoyment', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'terrible', 'films', 'great', 'gore', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'up', 'bad', 'acting', 'terrible', 'story', 'once', 'while', 'film', 'along', 'solid', 'cast', 'written', 'well', 'enough', 'remind', 'people', 'why', 'love', 'genre', 'do', 'can', 'technically', 'be', 'said', 'genre', 'Scream', 'did', 'horror', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'Scream', '4', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'again.The', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'Scream', '4', 'actually', 'Scream', 'film', 'cast', 'being', 'filled', 'mostly', 'new', 'recruits', 'get', 'sucked', 'killings', 'rather', 'easily', 'only', 'predicting', 'killer', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'do', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'David', 'Arquette', 'slide', 'back', 'respective', 'roles', 'trouble', 'new', 'rules', 'aspect', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'life', 'sequel', 'could', 'possibly', 'offer', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'original', 'films', 'went', 'shattered', 'Virgins', 'can', 'die', 'now', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', ""n't"", 'matter', 'veil', 'uncertainty', 'automatically', 'drawn', 'over', 'how', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'play', 'out', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'film', 'where', 'think', 'have', 'identity', 'killer', 'figured', 'out', 'being', 'swerved', 'thinking', 'somebody', 'else', 'Scream', '4', 'already', 'broke', 'mold', 'being', 'third', 'sequel', 'endless', 'array', 'nothing', 'less', 'spectacular', 'remakes', 'poke', 'fun', 'genre', 'intelligent', 'way', 'also', 'putting', 'new', 'spin', 'story', 'audiences', 'already', 'know', 'love.With', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'Scream', '4', 'bound', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'downfall', 'such', 'emphasis', 'new', 'rules', 'concept', 'film', ""'d"", 'expect', 'film', 'go', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'when', 'finally', 'opportunity', 'take', 'franchise', 'future', 'sequels', 'completely', 'new', 'unseen', 'direction', 'Scream', '4', 'circles', 'back', 'put', 'threequel', 'back', 'path', 'traveled', 'three', 'times', 'before', 'Do', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Speed', 'had', 'ending', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'once', 'got', 'off', 'bus', 'still', 'had', 'yet', 'venture', 'subway', 'see', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'chest', 'witness', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'get', 'decapitated', 'watch', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'make', 'out', 'leftover', 'destruction', '4', 'something', 'similar', 'bombs', 'buses', 'making', 'out', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'great', 'film', 'guessing', 'ride', 'longer', 'expect', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'ending', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'earlier', '4', 'bloodiest', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'Scream', 'entry', 'yet', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'theatrically', 'first', 'few', 'months', '2011', 'few', 'misfires', 'mostly', 'lying', 'finale', 'Scream', '4', 'intelligent', 'sequel', 'not', 'only', 'trend', 'poking', 'fun', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'also', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'great', 'kills', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'identity', 'Ghostface', 'finally', 'revealed']",N/A
1414782,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004LWZW2O,DanD,"[2, 4]","When Wes Craven's SCREAM came along, it was a breath of fresh air in the otherwise-stale genre: it pointed out all of horror's flaws, while highlighting its attributes.  It managed to give a few genuine scares while being absolutely hilarious.  Part of this was the result of Craven's vast experience scaring the crap out of people; part was due to screenwriter Kevin Williamson's over-dramatization of teen angst (""Smells Like Teen Intestine"" anyone?); and part was due to Neve Campbell's innate relatability, Courtney Cox's ability to channel her inner b****, and David Arquette's goofy likability.For the fourth film, these three characteristics return, albeit in minor form.  Williamson sounds more like Aaron Sorkin in spots, spouting off pop-culture dialogue that, fortunately, hits more than it misses.  Campbell is a minor player, though a strong one; Arquette and Cox are equally reduced to the sidelines, and while Cox has an intense scene, Arquette is left bumbling around (but not as amusingly as in the first film).  As for the new cast, only Hayden Panettierie and Rory Culkin really stand out; Emma Roberts is supposedly the new lead, and her performance gets decidedly stronger near the film's end, but for the first three-fourths she has little to do except scream and look pretty, much like the rest of the cast.  Craven himself seems more intent on dissecting his previous three films than scaring us.  There are only two genuinely strong scenes: one in which Ghostface curiously watches as one of his victims dies on his blade; and another later in the film, where a killer constructs the perfect crime scene.  These scenes don't carry quite the impact of, say, the rape scene in THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but they are certainly interesting horror movie moments.SCREAM 4 is the strongest of the sequels (not that that's saying much).  It's nowhere near as good as the first, nor does it try to be.  Which, maybe, it should.  The film is way too weak to stand on its own; as a sequel, it shines, but as a horror film, it's utterly meaningless.  In fact, it comes very close to falling victim to the point it's trying to make: there are few original horror ideas in Hollywood today.  Still, there's something to be said for constructing a successful self-referential horror film, and no one does it quite like the Williamson/Craven film; it's laugh-out-loud funny in spots, jump-in-your-seat startling in others.  It's not scary, and it won't make you rethink anything the way the first did.

Those horror movie rules that the Scream characters are always going on about would seem to demand a film that is more shocking and over-the-top than the original, but Scream 4 just comes up a little bit short of those high standards, in my opinion.  In addition to that, this film seems to commit some of the same mistakes that plague the whole slasher genre - for one thing, the overly long speech by the killer at the end.  Of course, it has always been difficult to offer a critical analysis of films in this particular franchise, what with the movies within movies and, more importantly, the way in which the storylines play off of popular horror culture and the Scream movies themselves.  When Scream 4 repeats something from an earlier film, you can't really call it derivative because such things are an integral part of this series' makeup.Following a pretty good, patented Scream-type opening, we watch as the horrors of the past once again revisit Woodsboro - on the anniversary of the original killing spree that made Sidney Prescott a household name.  Sidney (Neve Campbell) herself has finally emerged from her self-exile; having written a bestselling book on her experience of overcoming the traumas of the past, she has returned to Woodsboro for the last stop on her book tour.  Ghostface, it seems, has returned as well - a new Ghostface repeating the same modus operandi and slasher murders of those who wore the mask before.  Sidney hunkers down with her aunt and niece Jill (Emma Roberts), while Dewey (David Arquette) - now the sheriff - and his men (and one cute blonde deputy) try to identify the suspect and bring him/her to justice.  For Dewey's wife Gail (Courteney Cox), struggling to adjust to a small-town life of relative anonymity, the tragic situation is a great boon, giving her another chance at fame and celebrity.  Of course, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Many local teens seemingly have no parents, get together in ways their much-discussed rules for surviving a horror sequel tell them not to, sneak out of their houses in the middle of the night, and, naturally, suffer horrible deaths.  In the same vein, it doesn't really matter what Sidney does, for the whole ordeal once again revolves around her.  Another thing that hasn't changed is Craven's tendency to kill off the hottest females first - as if having already killed off the likes of Drew Barrymore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Rose McGowan wasn't enough for the guy.As usual, you get several suspects to choose from, and I must admit I was quite wrong in my suspicions as to Ghostface's identity this time around.  That doesn't mean I fully embraced the ending, though.  On the contrary, I found it just a little too convenient and, for lack of a better word, conservative.  I had hoped Wes Craven had something more daring and ambitious up his sleeve.  Still, I admit I was surprised by several plot twists toward the end, so I can't complain too much about the way things worked out.  I also have to admit that I never truly embraced the idea of a Scream 4.  Scream was a quintessential horror trilogy, and a part of me would have preferred to maintain that legacy as it was.  Fortunately, Scream 4 is good enough not to tarnish that legacy - although I'm not sure it adds anything to it in the end.",4,A darn good slasher film -- but not everything I had hoped it would be,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,3478,"['Scream', '4', 'darn', 'good', 'slasher', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'truly', 'goods', 'Scream', 'sequel', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'years', 'horror', 'movie', 'rules', 'Scream', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'about', 'would', 'seem', 'demand', 'film', 'more', 'shocking', 'over-the-top', 'original', 'Scream', '4', 'just', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'short', 'high', 'standards', 'opinion', 'addition', 'film', 'commit', 'same', 'mistakes', 'plague', 'whole', 'slasher', 'genre', 'one', 'thing', 'overly', 'long', 'speech', 'killer', 'end', 'course', 'always', 'been', 'difficult', 'offer', 'critical', 'analysis', 'films', 'particular', 'franchise', 'what', 'movies', 'movies', 'more', 'importantly', 'way', 'storylines', 'play', 'popular', 'horror', 'culture', 'Scream', 'movies', 'When', 'Scream', '4', 'repeats', 'something', 'earlier', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'derivative', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'series', 'makeup.Following', 'pretty', 'good', 'patented', 'Scream-type', 'opening', 'watch', 'horrors', 'past', 'once', 'again', 'revisit', 'Woodsboro', 'anniversary', 'original', 'killing', 'spree', 'made', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'household', 'name', 'Sidney', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'finally', 'emerged', 'self-exile', 'having', 'written', 'bestselling', 'book', 'experience', 'overcoming', 'traumas', 'past', 'returned', 'Woodsboro', 'last', 'stop', 'book', 'tour', 'Ghostface', 'returned', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'Ghostface', 'repeating', 'same', 'modus', 'operandi', 'slasher', 'murders', 'who', 'wore', 'mask', 'Sidney', 'hunkers', 'down', 'aunt', 'niece', 'Jill', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Dewey', 'David', 'Arquette', 'now', 'sheriff', 'men', 'one', 'cute', 'blonde', 'deputy', 'try', 'identify', 'suspect', 'bring', 'him/her', 'justice', 'Dewey', 'wife', 'Gail', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'struggling', 'adjust', 'small-town', 'life', 'relative', 'anonymity', 'tragic', 'situation', 'great', 'boon', 'giving', 'chance', 'fame', 'celebrity', 'course', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'Many', 'local', 'teens', 'seemingly', 'have', 'parents', 'get', 'together', 'ways', 'much-discussed', 'rules', 'surviving', 'horror', 'sequel', 'tell', 'not', 'sneak', 'houses', 'middle', 'night', 'naturally', 'suffer', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'same', 'vein', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'Sidney', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'once', 'again', 'thing', ""n't"", 'changed', 'Craven', 'tendency', 'kill', 'off', 'hottest', 'females', 'first', 'having', 'already', 'killed', 'off', 'likes', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'guy.As', 'usual', 'get', 'several', 'suspects', 'choose', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'quite', 'wrong', 'suspicions', 'Ghostface', 'identity', 'time', 'around', ""n't"", 'mean', 'fully', 'embraced', 'ending', 'though', 'contrary', 'found', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'conservative', 'had', 'hoped', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'daring', 'ambitious', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Still', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'several', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'never', 'truly', 'embraced', 'idea', 'Scream', '4', 'Scream', 'was', 'quintessential', 'horror', 'trilogy', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'maintain', 'legacy', 'was', 'Fortunately', 'Scream', '4', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'tarnish', 'legacy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anything', 'end']",N/A
1414784,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004LWZW2O,Dark Faerie Tales,"[2, 3]","The Review:Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have done it again, managing to deliver another quality installment in the Scream franchise.  Unlike the gorefests that are the seemingly endless Saw films, Scream avoids jumping the shark.  It comes close a few times, but through its unique brand of hyper self awareness and self deprecation, Scream 4 manages to skirt the edge of the shark tank without ever vaulting over it.  Scream 4 does not shy away from the fact that it is a sequel and that slasher films are at their heart, ridiculous.  It takes that weakness, and makes it strength by having the killer and victims always aware of how much of a retread of past events this latest series of murders are.  In fact, it wholeheartedly embraces, and makes fun of this fact in a cameo filled prologue.How can the Ghostface killer behind the film within a film, Stab, stay relevant in the fourth installment?  It's not made clear until the final act, when all is revealed, but it's smartly done and Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson even manage to sneak some social commentary in there about the nature of fame in the era of Reality TV.  Even before the big reveal though, the film is still pure slasher gold.  Scream breaks all of the slasher genre conventions by having victims and potential victims acutely aware of their victim status.  Because they know they are stuck in a slasher situation they are much more careful than the typical slasher victim, especially protagonist, Sydney Prescott, played again by Neve Campbell.  She hasn't made it through Scream 1, 2, and 3 by being stupid after all.  Courtney Cox and David Arquette reprise their roles as Gayle and Dewey.  Unfortunately, Dewey is as hapless as ever.  Everyone else though is pretty sharp including Ghostface, who is forced to step up his game in this fourth installment.Now, things aren't perfect.  Scream has always been a `who done it' in addition to a slasher.  Half the fun is guessing the identity of Ghostface after sifting through a few red herrings.  I think that the red herrings this time around are much too obvious.  This may just be because there has been a lot of time between the first Scream and Scream 4.  It's much harder to surprise audiences in 2011 than it was in 1996.  But perhaps I've already said too much and I like to keep my reviews spoiler free.  Go see Scream 4.  It preserves its title as the smart, funny, self aware king of the modern slasher films.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",4,Ghostface,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,2490,"['Review', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'have', 'done', 'again', 'managing', 'deliver', 'quality', 'installment', 'Scream', 'franchise', 'gorefests', 'are', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'Saw', 'films', 'Scream', 'jumping', 'shark', 'close', 'few', 'times', 'unique', 'brand', 'hyper', 'self', 'awareness', 'self', 'deprecation', 'Scream', '4', 'manages', 'skirt', 'edge', 'shark', 'tank', 'ever', 'vaulting', '4', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'fact', 'sequel', 'slasher', 'films', 'are', 'heart', 'ridiculous', 'weakness', 'strength', 'having', 'killer', 'victims', 'always', 'aware', 'how', 'much', 'retread', 'past', 'events', 'latest', 'series', 'murders', 'are', 'fact', 'wholeheartedly', 'fun', 'fact', 'cameo', 'filled', 'prologue.How', 'can', 'Ghostface', 'killer', 'film', 'film', 'Stab', 'stay', 'relevant', 'fourth', 'installment', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'revealed', 'smartly', 'done', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'even', 'manage', 'sneak', 'social', 'commentary', 'nature', 'fame', 'era', 'Reality', 'TV', 'Even', 'big', 'reveal', 'film', 'still', 'pure', 'slasher', 'gold', 'Scream', 'slasher', 'genre', 'conventions', 'having', 'victims', 'potential', 'victims', 'acutely', 'aware', 'victim', 'status', 'know', 'are', 'stuck', 'slasher', 'situation', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'careful', 'typical', 'slasher', 'victim', 'especially', 'protagonist', 'Sydney', 'Prescott', 'played', 'again', 'Neve', 'Campbell', ""n't"", 'made', 'Scream', '1', '2', '3', 'being', 'stupid', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'David', 'Arquette', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Gayle', 'Dewey', 'Unfortunately', 'Dewey', 'as', 'hapless', 'ever', 'Everyone', 'else', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'including', 'Ghostface', 'who', 'forced', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'fourth', 'installment.Now', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Scream', 'always', 'been', 'who', 'done', 'addition', 'slasher', 'fun', 'guessing', 'identity', 'Ghostface', 'sifting', 'few', 'red', 'herrings', 'think', 'red', 'herrings', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'obvious', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'because', 'been', 'lot', 'time', 'first', 'Scream', 'Scream', '4', 'much', 'harder', 'surprise', 'audiences', '2011', 'was', '1996', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'like', 'keep', 'reviews', 'spoiler', 'free', 'Go', 'see', 'Scream', '4', 'title', 'smart', 'funny', 'aware', 'king', 'modern', 'slasher', 'films.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",N/A

1414787,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B004LWZW2O,David J. Brown,"[5, 8]","I'm a huge Scream fan.  A grateful Scream fan, in fact.  Thanks to the original Scream horror films were revitalized and not only did big Studios get on the horror train but smaller horror films started getting wide release and press.  It was nirvana.  Of course, a lot if not most of the recent crop of horror films were mediocre to crap, but I have a theory about horror films: they're kind of like pizza.  Even when it's bad they're still kind of good.  I'd go into further detail regarding that but, lets just say I own copies of Saw V and Saw 3D, both were pretty crappy, but some part of me was entertained.  Horror, and sometimes action films, are the only genre of films that can do that for me.  If a comedy, suspense thriller or drama aren't good THEY'RE REALLY unbearable to watch for me.Firstly, this film isn't really scary for the seasoned horror-phile.  For me, most horror films aren't really scary.  Thankfully, Wes Craven supply ample satire, comedy, and pure old school Hitchcockian suspense sequences to go along with the usual pops out of nowhere, loud sting on the soundtrack, strange noise outside type of scares that are slasher films and lots of other types of horror films bread and butter.Okay, it's hard to review this film without giving major SPOILERS, but I'll try, but I warn you, depending on how much you already know about what this film is about, there may be SPOILERS.  Okay?This film is about equal to Scream 2, light-years better than Scream 3, but not equal to the original(which is fitting due to the fact that the killers this time around are trying to remake the first Stab film---the movies based the first film's events inside the world of the Scream movies---and we all know that most of the time remakes never beat the original).  Basically Craven and Williamson review the last ten years since Scream 3's release and the pop culture zeitgeist that has evolved and the types of horror films that have become vogue.  Which includes overly long running franchises(Saw series, Freddy, Jason etc) and the crop of ultra violent wrongfully described 'torture porn' films(Hostel, Captivity and the fore mentioned Saw franchise).  It goes after them with a vengeance!  And it's smart and more importantly funny!  Especially, the remake jabs.  This film's 'final girl' line to the movie's killer(or killers) is, ""Don't ever [...] with the original!""  It's a huge horror crowd-pleasing cathartic moment, especially considering how intensely funny and harrowing the violent conclusion of this film is.GREAT THINGS ABOUT SCREAM 4:Satire about remakes and horror sequels/franchise is on the money and in the same vein as what the first Scream was saying about slasher movies back in 1996.  Which in true Scream fashion allows the filmmakers to gleefully be part of what they're making fun of.  It makes fun of the long running Saw franchise, but itself is an unnecessary fourth film in a franchise.  Get it?  The movie gets to eat its cake and have it to.It's the ultimate meta movie.  Basically, the film beyond taking pokes at other movies and trends pokes fun at itself and what it became in pop culture.  The film is about characters who are being self-referential about movies that are being self-referential.  It sounds confusing, because it kind of is.  Gail Weathers gets the last line in the meta movie conversation when she uses the word after hearing from the town of Woodsboro's current crop of Randy-esque movie nerds. ""I'm not sure what it means, but they said it"", Gail tells Dewey(now her husband) as she chases down a lead to reveal the killer.While some of the scenes of slash and chase are worn, there are a few that are greatly executed and in one case totally original and as fun as the openings, if not better, to the first two Scream films.  The first 20 minutes blows your mind by having two movie in movie twists before finally settling down into the typical Scream franchise reality.  It will leave you saying WTF and then smiling at how the filmmakers got you, TWICE.  Secondly, there's a great scene involving a creepy phone call, a closet, and three teenage girls that is totally effective.  It will be easy to figure out where the twist in the scene is coming, but it's so well directed, acted and written the journey is more than half the ride.  But it doesn't even end at the obvious conclusion, it builds into the one moment in the film that actually got me to jump.  Great stuff very early in the film.Wes Craven is a much better filmmaker than he is given credit for.  He paces this thing wonderfully brisk and relentlessly.  All the jokes and set ups hit and the scenes in between give some fun character beats to make it matter to the viewer who does or who doesn't end up on the wrong side of a knife.  It's a slick, well edited, perfectly paced piece of pop cinema.  He's had a rough decade.  Scream 3, while not terrible, felt rushed and slapdash.  Cursed, had a cursed production history, and just barely registered.  It wasn't as funny as it should've been or scary, and it tanked. Sure, Music of the Heart and Red Eye(a barely seen but really underrated suspense film in the vein of Hitchcock) were really good, but last year we got a mediocre horror film from him called My Soul to Take.  Now, I didn't hate that film, I was just disappointed, but entertained enough.  It was similar to Vampire in Brooklyn and Shocker as far as the Craven repertoire goes.  Craven really needed to do a balls-out horror film that brought him back on top and Scream 4 is just the medicine. On a side note: I'm sure this film will be received well and liked and successful, so I would like Craven to do more back to his roots low-budget horror films, or more films outside the horror genre.  I think he's that talented and not a one trick pony.  He's obviously going to do Scream 5 and 6(Williamson has already agreed to write the next chapters in his new trilogy), so he can afford to take more risks.  After Cursed and My Soul to Take had so many big-wig studio cooks interfering with his kitchen it would be in his best interest to go smaller, and still do Scream films in between.  That's my unwanted and free advice to Mr. Craven, a filmmaker I truly admire immensely.Keeping with the last decade's trends in horror the film is more brutal than any of the previous Scream films.  Much bloodier, a much more abrasive killer.  I doubt Wes had any issues like he did with the first film getting scenes of graphic violence and aftermath by the MPAA this time around.  Now it's nowhere near a Hostel or Saw sequel's level of gore, but it trumps the other Scream films.Most of the new characters are well defined and funny to have onscreen.  I kid you not, but Anthony Anderson actually is likeable and not annoying in this film.  Shocking.  Sure, there are some characters that barely get anything beyond plot device service(Jill's boyfriend, the head cam wearing movie nerd, both bumbling deputies, money hungry publicist of Sidney, Jill's mother) but the rest including the mainstays of the franchise Sidney, Gail and Dewey are all logically evolved and fun to watch.  Special mention must to Hayden Penitiere and Emma Roberts.  I've always liked Hayden(loved her on Heroes) but she is really destined for good things.  She holds the screen and her beauty is truly unique.  Emma Roberts is very surprising.  I was bummed to hear she was in the film.  I personally think her acting is very limited based on the films I've seen her in(especially that Nancy Drew flick), but here she vindicates her life in the biz.  She does a great impersonation of Neve Campbell(she's supposed to be related to her), brings that average girl/girl next-door vibe in spades.  She has some other business that I can't go into, but it's also very convincing and well acted for maximum twisted comic effect.WHAT DOESN'T WORK FOR SCRAEM 4:Okay, I've had this problem with all the Scream films, but it's worth mentioning for posterity.  When  the killer(s) is revealed along with their motives I understood why they were doing what they were doing but I never really believed that it made sense.  The killers in these films are always making some sort of jab at a pop culture trend and this Scream film is aiming at the current fame-whores and Youtube trend.  Anyone can be famous without talent, or for any reason.  In the words of the killer(s), ""All you have to do is something really f%$&ked; up on camera for everyone to see.""  Great.  Very funny.  Just I'm not convinced that they really would be doing ANYTHING resembling what they're doing in this movie for THAT reason.  It's supposed to be satirical and blackly funny, and it totally is, but not really what I would call deep humanizing, crazy or not, developments.  You expect this in a Scream film, so you either hate or don't.This one is one that all the Scream films have in common as well: the killer in the Ghost face costume is creepy, fast and brutal.  It's an intimidating image well utilized in the horror scenes all throughout this franchise.  When the killer or killers is finally revealed in the finale they are ALWAYS less terrifying.  Although, one could argue they're more satirical fodder than imposing entities once they're revealed, but the logical problem comes into play.  I seriously doubt the killers in any of the Scream films could have thrown bodies through windows so violently and forcefully with their stature once revealed.  This Scream is no different, but one does have to suspend disbelief and meet the film on its own terms.Too many characters.  This goes back to what I was talking about in my pro section.  Some characters appear, or don't for awhile, and then get killed.  Almost everyone introduced gets killed, or is a killer.....Most shocking Mary McCormick plays Sidney's aunt and Jill's mother.  She has too VERY short scenes and they she's gone.  Not satisfying and not really validated in getting such a good actress to play the character.  Adam Brody gets some funny lines, but he really isn't utilized enough.  There are certain characters that get sliced and diced, but we don't know them and we really didn't have enough time to invest in the them, so it's less scary and effective than it would've been otherwise.  One under developed character die in a most brutal way and his death is prolonged similar to Tina's death in Wes Craven's original A Nightmare on Elm. Street.  It ends with the character's last dying words being a joke, but everything post his stabbed in the head demise is uncomfortable and effective in that old school Wes Craven way.  Wish we had gotten to know him better so it would've even more horrifying.  Don't get me started on Jill's boyfriend.  He literally is no more than a plot device on two levels(this is a Scream movie) and the actor portraying him barely registers.This complaint is either the point or just something some may find annoying, but this film may be the most self-referential movie of ALL TIME, let alone in the Scream series, and the third film actually took place on Hollywood sets while moviemaking was going on!  The word meta is liberally used from the first five minutes and continues from there. ""I mean, how meta can you get"", a doomed character spouts at one point.  Now this is slightly annoying, but at the same time, it goes part and parcel with the movie's thesis.  It's a remake, so everything has to be MORE, plus it's making fun of self referential horror films ala Scream, so that could also be the point of having it used soooo much.  Take it or leave it as far as being a criticism.The original series' main characters played by Courtney Cox, Neve Campbell and David Arquette don't get enough screen time in my opinion.  More Cox and Arquette than Campbell on this front.  I love Gail and Dewey's dynamic, and I really care about these characters.  A scene that is ruined in the trailers where Gail meets Ghost face up close and personal is truly harrowing because Dewey can see it coming from hidden cameras.  This is great stuff, scary stuff because you actually care about these characters and they're performed really well.It follows parts 2 and 3's device of devoting the second act to a red-herring fest.  Who's the killer?  It's them for sure, but wait they just got offed, or they were in this place so it couldn't be them.  Considering this is the fourth film in the franchise it feels more tedious than it did in the previous three, although it was wearing slightly thin by the third film.That's really it.  This film will most likely satisfy old school Scream fans, and will entice newbie horror fans.  It's a love letter to the horror, limited horror, of the films in the 90's.  It states what it hates about remakes and franchises and then goes on and becomes all those things for comic effect.  It's a Scream movie!  I would love to see this again, and I really hope that when it hits blu ray that it will be an unrated extended cut, and maybe some of the character complaints I had earlier will be resolved.PS: Anyone else really jonzing to see the original version of Cursed? I am!  This new Scream is just as witty and well written as Williamson's earlier Screams and The Faculty, so he hasn't lost anything.  Why was Cursed so lame, even in it's unrated cut?  It was desperate and without wit, which isn't really something Williamson is known for.",4,Please don't say 'META' one more time!,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,13378,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Scream', 'fan',

1414791,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B004LWZW2O,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[4, 6]","The terrorized teens in the ""Scream"" movies have always been wise to the ways to survive and (far more likely) die in horror films. But original screenwriter Kevin Williamson and original director Wes Craven (the original 1984 ""Nightmare On Elm Street"") know that a lot has changed since ""Scream 3"", the last, extremely disappointing, installment. A decade has passed, to be exact, and teens today live in  the  age of Facebook, instant messaging, cell phones, instant video streaming, and horror movie remakes, ""re-imaginings"" and ""reboots."" Williamson and Craven cleverly incorporate all this into the plot of ""Scream 4."" The rules of survival and death in horror movies have clearly changed, and these teens (and likely the ""Scream"" audience as well) still think they know it, and have seen it, all. ""Scream 4"" is not a remake or a reimagining. It is a startlingly, revitalized reboot. ""Scream 4"" has plenty of surprises, as it (literally) brings the series screaming back to life with an especially bloody vengence.Having miraculously survived ""Scream 1-3"", Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has written a book about her ordeals with the killer Ghostface titled ""Coming Out Of The Darkness."" Sydney finds herself trapped in that old nightmarish darkness soon enough. No sooner does she return to Woodsboro on a book tour, reuniting with fellow ""Scream"" survivors Gail (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette), and Ghostface starts his/her/its murder spree all over again; transforming Woodsboro (once again) into the image of ""Mayberry, USA"", with a nasty psycho killer on the phone and on the loose. The target this time is not only Sydney, but Sydney's niece Jill (Emma Roberts) and her teen friends. These 2011 teens are indifferent to the murderous rampages that Sydney, Gail, and Dewey survived-- except that they serve as the basis for the ""Stab"" horror movie series. ""Stab"" is the movie franchaise within the ""Scream"" franchaise.""Scream 4"" functions as a movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie to the point where it becomes beyond surreal. To the teens in ""Scream 4"", Ghostface is a cult hero; that is, until he/she/it starts stabbing them to death. Trouble is, the teen characters in ""Scream 4"" (Hayden Panettiere, Erik Knudson, Rory Culkin. Marielle Jaffe. Emma Roberts, and Nico Tortorella) are such a snarky, snobby, selfish, and self-absorbed group the audience won't likely care who is stabbed to death or who or what is stabbing them. Okay, one character gets a particularly violent and bloody death that is disburbing. But you go into the ""Scream"" movies excepting violent deaths, so it isn't all that disturbing.What is disturbing about ""Scream 4"" is its sharp commentary on our culture. One character is obsessed with broadcasting every aspect of his life on the Internet via Video Streaming. His death is broadcast for posterity, too. Sydney's fame-grabbing book publicist (Alison Brie) tells her, ""You're a victim. You will always be a victim. So embrace it.""

1414807,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B004LWZW2O,G. Dowling,"[2, 4]","This is a review of the Bluray version.  I just watched Scre4m and I must say, I was shocked. . .at how good it was!  It is the best since the first, and I dare say, as good as the first.  It's scary, very witty, clever, and surprisingly well acted with a terrific cast and a first-rate screenplay by series creator Kevin Williamson.  The story follows the ten-year anniversary of the Woodsboro murders (the events which comprised the first)and Sidney Prescott (reprised by the lovely Neve Campbell) has written an autobiography about her experiences of the the first 3 stories and how she recovered from these events.  Campbell is still one of the most likable, heroic, and role-model worthy heroines in horror history.  She's by turns tough and fearless and soft and vulnerable...refracted beautifully though Campbell's uncommon grace and talent.  Also returning are Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers-Riley, who steals most of her scenes, and David Arquette as now Sheriff Dewey Riley.  It's nice to see the old gang we rooted for so strongly across 3 films back together again.  I can see why the filmmakers would have done anything to preserve the central cast, as it would not be the same without them.  We also have a band of fresh faces and cameos from Hayden Penetierre (another scene-stealer), Emma Roberts, Anna Paquin (True Blood). Rory Culkin (Signs), among others.  Ghostface is also back for the 10th anniversary and has his knife sharpened to cut through many of the new cast, and director Wes Craven's brilliant hide and seek direction is still thrilling and he has managed to make it feel both familiar and fresh.The unsung hero of Scream 4 is Kevin Williamson, who has written a sharp, observent, hysterically self-referential and his observations and insights on the last decade of horror films is absolutely brilliant and gives the film its octance, since he is really the first to comment on it in any meanigful way, much the way he did with the entire horror genre thus far in the first film.  He plays with the tsunami of horror remakes, the new technologies and social networking sites, and ever shifting rules of the genre to brilliant ends, as it allows for some truly imaginative chase and kill scenes.  He even pokes some hilarious fun at himself, as he more or less invented the ""opening scene murder mini-movie"" which the series was known for starting with Scream 1's terrifying opening minutes with Drew Barrymore.  The ending is a true jaw-dropper and a genuine surprise and one that makes more sense than the last two sequels did.  Once again Williamson ties it into current media culture deftly and skillfully.The Bluray presentation is superb.  The 1080p PQ is razor sharp and wonderfully filmic.  The grain structure is kept beautifully intact but it is never obtrusive.  Colors are bright, skin tones are natural, and fine detail is superb...every kill reveals every drip of blood and piece of flesh...so enjoy that!  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack is awesome.  It's loud, pounding, has terrific and scary ambient surrounds...the rear channels and subwoofer get quite a workout.  Dialogue is crisp and clear. Especially nice is Marco Beltrami's terrifying score which heightens the tension. The package includes a standard definition DVD and a digital copy for your mobile device.  The special features are a tad light.  There's a making of documentary, deleted scenes(w/ optional commentary), and cast and filmmaker commentary.  I would have liked more of a breakdown of each area...casting, score, editing, make-up effects, etc.Scream 4's box office ws tepid, which is unfortunate and surprising to me, given how strong the movie is, but I think it fell victim to (ironically) an oversaturated market...the horror blitz has been non-stop since the first Scream hit back in 1996 as it re-invigorated the genre single-handedly. It was also marred by a poor trailer and TV spots which did not even glimpse how good the film is.  It also had a crappy release date.  This should have been a summer movie.  It would have made perfect counter-programming to the 500 superhero movies released this past summer.  It's worldwide gross was excellent, but it still makes the likelihood of future sequels uncertain.

1414809,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B004LWZW2O,G. Garner,"[2, 3]","First and foremost, let me say that this IS a slasher movie. It is not torture porn. This is a traditional slasher film, in most respects(although the motive turns out to be quite contemporary). I only point this out because some reviews do not adequately make the distinction-there IS a difference.It is somewhat more graphic than the old Scream movies, but not THAT much. A lot has been said about the changes in technology that have occurred between the older films and this one. Truth be told, Scream 4 acknowledges this evolution, but they are not as preoccupied with it as some would have you to believe. It is there, and it is a factor, but it is never allowed to distract from the essential elements of the story.I am especially fond of how they shot the nocturnal scenes. They actually look like nighttime. By that, I mean, they don't seem to use computer-generated dark, like so many films do. The dark scenes are actually DARK. This lends the film an aura of the macabre that would be lacking otherwise. It also gives the movie an 'old-school' feel, like the classics from the 80's. The film makes excellent use of light and shadow, as well as sound(the part with the wind chimes, for example). For me, slasher films are largely about the ambience, and Scream 4 succeeds in that department.As I said, the killer's motivation turns out to be quite contemporary and realistic. The modern preoccupation with fame, just for fame's sake, lies at the core of the story. The desire of so many young people to be famous, to be known, just for its own sake, is such a fatuous thing. But however foolish it might seem to more grounded people, it is a real phenomenon. In fact, I'm really surprised that more people don't try stuff like this in real life.For those of us who love slasher movies, it is getting more and more rare to find one with quality production values and a cast of people that you've actually heard of before. Scream 4 is about as good as it's going to get, in this day and age. It's not great, and it'll never be a favorite of mine. But it's certainly a breath of fresh air. Just a good, quality film, with effective horror and mystery elements. And you never get the feeling that they are trying to nauseate the audience with endless torture sequences or excessive gore just for the sake of gore-that is a nice bonus.",4,If You Like Slasher Movies-and You Want to See Something New-This is About as Good as it's Going to Get,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,2340,"['First', 'foremost', 'let', 'say', 'slasher', 'movie', 'not', 'torture', 'porn', 'traditional', 'slasher', 'film', 'most', 'respects', 'motive', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'contemporary', 'only', 'point', 'out', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'adequately', 'make', 'distinction-there', 'difference.It', 'somewhat', 'more', 'graphic', 'old', 'Scream', 'movies', 'not', 'THAT', 'much', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'changes', 'technology', 'have', 'occurred', 'older', 'films', 'one', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Scream', '4', 'evolution', 'are', 'not', 'preoccupied', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'there', 'factor', 'never', 'allowed', 'distract', 'essential', 'elements', 'story.I', 'am', 'especially', 'fond', 'how', 'shot', 'nocturnal', 'scenes', 'actually', 'look', 'nighttime', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'use', 'computer-generated', 'dark', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'DARK', 'film', 'aura', 'macabre', 'would', 'be', 'lacking', 'otherwise', 'also', 'movie', ""'old-school"", 'feel', 'classics', '80', 'film', 'excellent', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'part', 'wind', 'chimes', 'example', 'slasher', 'films', 'are', 'largely', 'ambience', 'Scream', '4', 'department.As', 'said', 'killer', 'motivation', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'contemporary', 'realistic', 'modern', 'preoccupation', 'fame', 'just', 'fame', 'sake', 'core', 'story', 'desire', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'be', 'famous', 'be', 'known', 'just', 'own', 'sake', 'such', 'fatuous', 'thing', 'however', 'foolish', 'might', 'seem', 'more', 'grounded', 'people', 'real', 'phenomenon', 'fact', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'more', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'stuff', 'real', 'life.For', 'who', 'love', 'slasher', 'movies', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'rare', 'find', 'one', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'cast', 'people', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'heard', 'before', 'Scream', '4', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'get', 'day', 'age', 'not', 'great', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'mine', 'certainly', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Just', 'good', 'quality', 'film', 'effective', 'horror', 'mystery', 'elements', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'trying', 'nauseate', 'audience', 'endless', 'torture', 'sequences', 'excessive', 'gore', 'just', 'sake', 'gore-that', 'nice', 'bonus']",N/A

1414814,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004LWZW2O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Somewhere Alexander Graham Bell must be furiously spinning around in his grave, what with the Ghostface Killer's total abuse of the telephone. Eleven years after the third chapter, Wes Craven reinvigorates the franchise with SCREAM 4 - or, if you want to get cute, SCRE4M. Fun to see the core cast back together - Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette - and as a nod to the new gen, rising starlets like the surprising Emma Roberts and a memorably brassy Hayden Panettiere get featured roles.Celebrity victim Sidney Prescott, in a move to assert herself and take control of her life, has authored a self-help book, but maybe she ought not to have made her hometown of Woodsboro the final leg in her book tour. She definitely shouldn't have scheduled her appearance to coincide with the anniversary of the original killings in Woodsboro. Because here comes her old pal, the Ghostface Killer, and he's more stabby than before. SCREAM 4 boasts more kills than in any of the prior sCREAM movies. The ecstatic news media promptly dubs the new reign of terror the Woodsboro Massacre Reboot. And in the age of Facebook and Twitter and such, old Ghostface is now filming his murders.The franchise still strives to play against expectations; it's still using horror cliches as its foil. The tone is still tongue-in-cheek, and we get a dusting off of the rules of survival in a horror film. The characters still let fly with the meta-references. Hell's bells, even the deputy cops on surveillance chat about the film cop's inevitably unhappy plight in horror films. But even with the hefty wink of the eye, Wes Craven consistently brings it back to the suspense. He hasn't lost that knack for making you jump out of your seat. And, as usual, I'm never really sure who'll make it thru. Even Sydney, who can teach a cockroach a thing or two about survival, doesn't seem a surefire bet to escape unscathed thru this new terrifying ordeal. The perception I got was that the film was introducing Emma Roberts (who plays Sidney's cousin Jill) as the new blood, possibly to take over the franchise, what with Neve Campbell having committed that most damnable of sins. She's let herself get older. Sidney is still very much the focus of Ghostface's ire. As the film progressed, I resigned myself that Ghostface may actually get it done this time. Meanwhile, Sidney is being dubbed as the ""Angel of Death"" because everyone around her seems to die while she doesnt. It's a messed-up homecoming.The audio commentary reveals that David Arquette approached Wes Craven and suggested that, for this outing, maybe his Sheriff Dewey character can actually be good at his job. But Craven was having none of that. Dewey is still dependably clueless and bumbling. He and ex-reporter Gail Weathers have been married for ten years now, and Gail's career has gotten stuck in a rut, her great American novel still to be written. Thankfully, Ghostface's return allows her a chance to get her feet wet again in tabloid journalism. Courtney Cox always seems to be having fun in this plum role. Over a decade after we've last seen her, Gail is still ambitious and caustic and flirting with being unlikable. Except I really like Gail Weathers.SCREAM 4 kicks off with a triple opening sequence, right away enveloping you in its self-aware film-within-a-film gimmick (with cameos by Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, Aimee Teegarden, and other fine, fine women). We are informed that the STAB film franchise - based on Sidney's harrowing experiences - is alive and well and has now reached its sixth installment. And if you look close, there are homages made to the first SCREAM (which is still far and away the best of the bunch). Besides all the clever meta stuff, SCREAM 4 treats us to pretty smart storytelling and several sweet brutal kills (poor Aimee Teegarden, poor Anthony Anderson). And to demonstrate that Neve Campbell is still THE scream queen supreme in this franchise, she ends up with most kickasss f---you line in the film.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director Wes Craven and cast Emma Roberts, Hayden Panetiere, and with Neve Campbell phoning in from London- 20 Deleted & Extended Scenes, including an Alternate Opening and an Extended Ending (with optional director's commentary, totaling 00:26:00 minutes)- Gag Reel (00:09:16 minutes)- The Making of SCREAM 4 (00:10:27 minutes)",4,"""No, you can't kill Sidney.

Since she wants to solve the case with him and find the killer as a team like they used to, but he doesn't want her to get hurt. Desperate for information, Gale teams up with Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin), a film geek that seems to know a lot about scary movies and remakes.Sydney who is now under police protection due to that the killings started when she returned and since she's always the target of the Ghost-face killer; is basically protecting herself, while protecting her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her friends from the new killer. Since Jill and her friends have been getting threatening calls from the killer and are a target as well.With Scream 4, Director, Wes Craven, and screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, have a great time entertaining as well as scaring their audience. From the start the director and writer duo offer many clever twists and turns that are impossible to see coming. But sometimes the film is too goofy for it's own good as far as the laughs go. For instance, in a surreal and  hilarious murder scene where someone takes forever to die, you'll laugh while also thinking ""that's pretty stupid."" Then in other scenes the movie can be so violent that it's disturbing with innocent teens brutally killed. So the comedy and violence isn't as well balanced as it is in the earlier films.Still, Scream 4 is one of the best in the series since it will make you jump and a lot of the laughs are pretty clever, especially the ones about horror remakes.",4,The Best since the First!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,2000,"['Now', 'popular', 'author', 'self-help', 'book', 'Sydney', 'Prescott', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'hometown', 'Woodsboro', 'book', 'tour.Sydney', 'quickly', 'reunited', 'good', 'friends', 'Sheriff', 'Dewey', 'Riley', 'DavidArquette', 'Gail', 'Weather', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'who', 'have', 'now', 'married.When', 'new', 'Ghost-face', 'killer', 'loose', 'Gale', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'reporter', 'given', 'chance', 'become', 'reporter', 'again', 'Sheriff', 'Dewey', 'loyal', 'Deputy', 'Judy', 'Hicks', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'are', 'sharing', 'little', 'case', 'possibly', 'can', 'solve', 'case', 'find', 'killer', 'team', 'used', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'hurt', 'Desperate', 'information', 'Gale', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Walker', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'film', 'geek', 'know', 'lot', 'scary', 'movies', 'remakes.Sydney', 'who', 'now', 'police', 'protection', 'due', 'killings', 'started', 'when', 'returned', 'always', 'target', 'Ghost-face', 'killer', 'basically', 'protecting', 'protecting', 'cousin', 'Jill', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'friends', 'new', 'killer', 'Jill', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'threatening', 'calls', 'killer', 'are', 'target', 'well.With', 'Scream', '4', 'Director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'screenwriter', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'scaring', 'audience', 'start', 'director', 'writer', 'duo', 'offer', 'many', 'clever', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'impossible', 'see', 'coming', 'film', 'too', 'goofy', 'own', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'laughs', 'go', 'instance', 'surreal', 'hilarious', 'murder', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'forever', 'die', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'also', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'Then', 'other', 'scenes', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'innocent', 'teens', 'brutally', 'killed', 'comedy', 'violence', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'balanced', 'earlier', 'films.Still', 'Scream', '4', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'lot', 'laughs', 'are', 'pretty', 'clever', 'especially', 'ones', 'horror', 'remakes']",N/A

The producers succeeded...and then some.  It may be a very different experience from the original of this slasher satire franchise, but it's a very worthy sequel.It's charming that they start these movies so similarly.  It presents a bit of welcomed nostalgia reminding me of how wonderful my original Scream experience was.  With cameos by Anna Paquin (HBO's True Blood) and Kristin Bell (TV's Heroes, Forgetting Sarah Marshall), this installment playfully pokes fun at the franchise letting us know that, hopefully, it hasn't taken itself too seriously.In addition to the returning cast we have a new set of youngsters, some of which are clear replacements for other Scream characters (e.g., the young Jaime Kennedy-style kid).  The younger cast comprises our main persons of interest.  I enjoyed the new age, Youtube-y A/V metageeks.  Alison Brie (TV's Community) and Hayden Panetierre (TV's Heroes) offer some solid personality.  Two new cops, Adam Brody (Thank You for Smoking, Jennifer's Body) and Anthony Anderson (Transformers, Hustle and Flow), give us some nice comic relief as well.Much of this movie is composed of the same cookie cutter scenes and metamovie-survival-guide dialogue common to all of the previous Scream movies. But this is par for the course with these movies and, well honestly, they recycle this material effectively.  Just like the others, the ""rules change"" again and, also like the others, I never had a clue who the killer (or killers) would be.If you try not to compare this too much the prequels, this makes for a fun ride.

At the time of this update my review got 3/17 helpful votes, and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I didn't write a long drawn out review here and originally gave it 2/5 stars. So...here is one that is a tad bit longer. But if you want to read the whole thing, visit the link in my profile and search for ""Scream 4""The Scream movies are known for their clever openings. Usually killing off some star everyone knows by name, or at least doing the killing in a clever way. The first killed Drew Barrymore off, when most probably thought she'd be the star. And most horror movies back then NEVER opened with a death right in the beginning. The 2nd film killed off Jada Pinkett Smith, aka Will Smith's wife, and her boyfriend in a movie theater, everyone thinking it was a publicity stunt. And the 3rd one opened with killing off a character (Cotton) who had been in each of the films (barely in the first one). This one however, didn't really open like that. Instead they killed off a few ""well known"" actors from TV shows. Anna Paquin from HBO's True Blood, another from Pretty Little Liars on ABC Family, the other 90210 on the CW, and the other from Veronica Mars (or Heroes) fame. The opening wasn't even all that clever. A movie within a movie, within reality, and those getting butchered were all part of a movie, which later comes into play as the killer seems obsessed with the Stab movies these deaths are from.As for the characters themselves, there were only a few likable characters. And in the end like most horror movies these days, we didn't get to know or care or like any of them. I felt that was completely different from the first Scream film. In the first film there was one main group of kids and we got to know them all rather well. In this one they were just there. There was nothing special about them except for maybe Kirby and Robbie, they were cute horror movie fans - sorta like the first Scream with Drew Barrymore's character talking about all sorts of horror movies. Kirby has a scene where she too is quizzed on horror films. It was interesting since I am a huge horror movie fan too.The storyline itself I liked. Sidney was out of hiding, had written a book, was back in her home town visiting family and at a book signing, it was the anniversary of the first massacre. I loved that Dewey was in town as the Sheriff, married to Gale. But Gale`s story could have been so much better. She didn't seem like the same character from the old movies. It would have been better if she was her normal self. I liked that the movie really took a shot at the way remakes were taking over the world these days (And I loved Sid`s line about never messing with the original movie). But once I got to the end of the movie, I realized that the movie just was a mess. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel OR a remake, but weren't sure which to go with, so made a very loose remake of the original (with a few small elements from the other two films) threw them all together, then added some of the original cast (to cash in on the names and connect the stories) and slapped it together. Had they beefed up the character development and changed the killer/motive I think the movie would have been really good.I won't go into spoilers and mega details - if you want that visit my blog in my profile as that review is a LOT longer and detailed especially about the whole crappy ending.The BluRay special features were fun. 26 minutes of deleted scenes (some I thought were better then what was on the disc), and a 10 minute gag reel that I thought was great. There was a documentary and a commentary, but I didn't watch either of those.",3,"Pretty Pointless ""sequel""",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,3881,"['more', 'depth', 'review', 'movie', 'please', 'visit', 'horror', 'movie/book', 'review', 'blog', 'listed', 'profile.I', ""'m"", 'editing', 'review', 'be', 'updated', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'BluRay', 'time', 'update', 'review', 'got', '3/17', 'helpful', 'votes', 'think', 'probably', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'long', 'drawn', 'review', 'here', 'originally', 'gave', '2/5', 'stars', 'So', 'here', 'one', 'tad', 'bit', 'longer', 'want', 'read', 'whole', 'thing', 'visit', 'link', 'profile', 'search', 'Scream', '4', 'Scream', 'movies', 'are', 'known', 'clever', 'openings', 'Usually', 'killing', 'off', 'star', 'everyone', 'name', 'least', 'doing', 'killing', 'clever', 'way', 'first', 'killed', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'off', 'when', 'most', 'probably', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'star', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'back', 'then', 'NEVER', 'opened', 'death', 'right', 'beginning', '2nd', 'film', 'killed', 'off', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'aka', 'Will', 'Smith', 'wife', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'theater', 'everyone', 'thinking', 'was', 'publicity', 'stunt', '3rd', 'one', 'opened', 'killing', 'off', 'character', 'Cotton', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'films', 'barely', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'open', 'Instead', 'killed', 'off', 'few', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'TV', 'shows', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'Pretty', 'Little', 'Liars', 'ABC', 'Family', 'other', '90210', 'CW', 'other', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Heroes', 'fame', 'opening', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'clever', 'movie', 'movie', 'reality', 'getting', 'butchered', 'were', 'part', 'movie', 'later', 'play', 'killer', 'obsessed', 'Stab', 'movies', 'deaths', 'are', 'from.As', 'characters', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'likable', 'characters', 'end', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'care', 'felt', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'first', 'Scream', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'group', 'kids', 'got', 'know', 'rather', 'well', 'one', 'were', 'just', 'there', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'maybe', 'Kirby', 'Robbie', 'were', 'cute', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'sorta', 'first', 'Scream', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'talking', 'sorts', 'horror', 'movies', 'Kirby', 'scene', 'where', 'too', 'quizzed', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'interesting', 'am', 'huge', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'too.The', 'storyline', 'liked', 'Sidney', 'was', 'hiding', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'was', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'visiting', 'family', 'book', 'signing', 'was', 'anniversary', 'first', 'massacre', 'loved', 'Dewey', 'was', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'married', 'Gale', 'Gale', 's', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'same', 'character', 'old', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'normal', 'self', 'liked', 'movie', 'really', 'took', 'shot', 'way', 'remakes', 'were', 'taking', 'world', 'days', 'loved', 'Sid', 's', 'line', 'never', 'messing', 'original', 'movie', 'once', 'got', 'end', 'movie', 'realized', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'mess', 'seemed', 'wanted', 'make', 'sequel', 'remake', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'go', 'so', 'made', 'very', 'loose', 'remake', 'original', 'few', 'small', 'elements', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'threw', 'together', 'then', 'added', 'original', 'cast', 'cash', 'names', 'connect', 'stories', 'slapped', 'together', 'Had', 'beefed', 'up', 'character', 'development', 'changed', 'killer/motive', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'spoilers', 'mega', 'details', 'want', 'visit', 'blog', 'profile', 'review', 'LOT', 'longer', 'detailed', 'especially', 'whole', 'crappy', 'ending.The', 'BluRay', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'fun', '26', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'thought', 'were', 'better', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'disc', '10', 'minute', 'gag', 'reel', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch']",N/A

1414828,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B004LWZW2O,Kevin Killian,"[7, 9]","One scene is badly filmed, or maybe just awkwardly filmed, the reading Sydney gives at the Woodsboro bookstore to promote her bestselling self-help book, OUT OF THE DARKNESS. Not sure what makes it look so phony, but it's almost as if the filmmakers have never actually been to a bookstore in their lives, or at any rate gone to a reading.  Sydney is forced to read in a shadowy corner of the store, attended by a few extras dressed as booklovers, all of them standing, none seated.  When she finishes the reading the five fans clap.  Five sales right there--really a lousy turnout for poor Sydney.  Her publicist (Alison Brie from MAD MEN and COMMUNITY) must be tearing her hair out.  Why even bring Sydney back to Woodsboro on her book tour if only five people are going to buy books?  Then the Q&A; portion of the event is interrupted by Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and Deputy Judy (Marley Shelton) who have somehow triangulated e missing cell phone to the general vicinity of the bookstore.  It's a calamity as far as commerce goes, but it is the only false step in SCREAM 4, by far the best sequel in ages and, I would say, one of those rare movies that transcends even the original.Okay, Emma Roberts (playing Jill, Sydney's young niece of high school age) is pretty much of a washout in a pivotal role, but it's not really her fault, is it?  Jill's ambiguous and charged feelings towards her famous aunt perhaps parallel young Emma's feelings about her own famous aunt, the better known actress Julia Roberts.  It's strange that Emma Roberts has to play Jill Roberts--isn't there any other last names they might have picked?  The phone rings in her house, she picks it up, ""Roberts residence,"" she chirps brightly, just as though she were in her own home in Hollywood or wherever teen stars live nowadays.  Writer Kevin Williamson brings on the jokes and scares so quickly that the movie moves from beginning to end on an adrenaline high, the rush of confidence you get when a top writer gets to do pretty much exactly as he pleases, and Wes Craven responds by giving all of his players the shading and the humor they need to make it work.  Hayden Panetierre has never impressed me, but here she gives the performance of a natural movie star, while the central trio of Campbell, Arquette and Cox keep a very steady lead against a troupe of energetic youngsters in the new cast.  Wasn't Lauren Graham supposed to be in this thing?  Is she playing the part that Mary McDonnell is now playing? Poor Mary McDonnell, her newest facelift was so raw and red that it looks painful to touch.  Her brow and chin almost meet, like oldtime silhouettes of the crescent moon.  I think that Lauren Graham upped and left the production and they had to wake up Mary McDonnell by giving her smelling salts right on the operating table and summoning her to the set without taking out the stitches first.  That said, she is fine in the movie and those of us who loved her as White-Woman-Raised-by-Sioux in DANCES WITH WOLVES will be happy to see her triumph again in this latest box office semi-hit.Critical reaction among Amazon reviewers has been sharply divided, perhaps along the same lines as critics in general.  Some think the movie played out, ridiculous, overlong and poorly motivated.  Some praise it as the best since the original SCREAM.  But I go further and salute it as the best of all the SCREAMs, precisely because its motivation is so delicious and so obvious.  I could kick myself for not getting it, whereas the killers in all the other movies were just, oh, who cares why they did it.  When the movie was over, my wife turned to me and said, This is better than The Kings Speech, and better in fact, than all 10 of last year's Best Picture nominations.

1414831,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004LWZW2O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","Note: This release (11/22) represents the single disc Blu-ray.  The version already on the market is the combo pack with DVD and Digital Version.Blu-ray/DVD Special Features: First of all, the movie looks terrific on Blu-ray. The disc has a commentary with Wes Craven aided by Roberts, Panettiere, and Campbell. Fans of Craven should appreciate his contribution. It's always good to hear a legend share his thoughts--but the ladies add little to the experience. There are extended and deleted scenes which add dimension to some of the underused peripheral characters, and an alternate opening (not as solid as the one in the film), an extended ending (already too prolonged in the movie, in my opinion), a gag reel (mostly people scaring one another--not a big deal), and a standard making-of featurette. If you love the movie, it's a solid package of extras!After an eleven year hiatus, Ghostface is back! While there were high hopes for this relaunch of the ""Scream"" franchise, fewer movie-goers turned out than the industry expected for this solid and nostalgic new entry in the horror series. As a horror fan and someone who enjoyed, to varying degrees, the first three movies--""Scream 4"" seemed like a great idea. With director Wes Craven on hand and writer Kevin Williamson returning, all the components were in place to make something quite special. I don't know if special, however, is the word I'd use to describe the end product. Don't get me wrong, there is much to appreciate in ""Scream 4."" This is a slick and polished production featuring an attractive and likable new cast. Familiar favorites are back and it's genuinely good to see them. The referential and self-aware nods to other movies is still amusing, even as they are updated slightly for a new decade.Without a doubt, the movie's opening bit (always something to look forward to) served up an inspired introduction to the new film. In fact, it is easily my favorite sequence in the entire production. Soon, however, we settle into the main story line. Sidney (Neve Campbell) returns home to promote her new book about everyone's favorite subject. Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and his wife Gale (Courteney Cox) are still in town as is Sidney's niece (Emma Roberts). Roberts leads a brigade of new teenage characters that include other familiar faces in Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin among others. With Sidney's return, (you guessed it) the eerie phone calls start up again. At first students are targeted, then it seems that it is all being staged to put Sidney front and center again. Of course, you expect the body count to start rising as the final reveal and confrontation looms.But what is that old expression? The more things change, the more they stay the same. As much as I wanted to be blown away by this new incarnation of ""Scream,"" I was merely entertained. The film suffers the same fate as the earlier sequels. After a spry and clever beginning and a solid center, the film twists around on itself so much to conjure up an unexpected finale that it becomes hard to take anything too seriously. Now I'm not saying that I expected anything resembling dramatic realism, it's just hard to have fun playing along when the plot gets increasingly preposterous the longer the movie progresses. I particularly enjoyed the fact that as a serial murderer is annihilating high school students on a nightly basis, no one bothers to be worried or to adjust their social schedule. And just where are ANY parents?Fans of the genre should be entertained as long as they leave logic out of the equation. Despite my misgivings, certain moments really stick out. At one point, a character refers to the situation they are in as ""meta"" and the moment is spot-on hilarious. With a screenplay that should be playful and smart (and mostly is), the lapses of reason and common sense are more glaringly obvious. Still, Campbell (what is she doing these days?), Arquette, and Cox are in fine form. This is a good enough movie, I suppose, it just isn't particularly special. I wanted this sequel to reinvigorate the franchise, it merely stayed safely in the conventions of its own design. Worth a look, however, if you're a fan. About 3 1/2 stars.

It doesn't beat the original's opening twelve, but it certainly toys with conventions while still being witty, dark and quite violent. The final twenty minutes is pretty insane.

Everything in between is fairly standard stuff from there with many good, and a couple excellent, moments.The film is executed with an artistic flair of wit and style that long time fans and film buffs alike will love.

1414842,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW2O,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Honestly I am tired of seeing the Halloween masks for Ghostface, the mask all killers in the SCREAM films wear, every year at Halloween. Enough already. That being said, it's nice to see a new film in the SCREAM franchise being released in time for folks to rent during the Halloween season. With all the potential killers killed off in parts 1-3 you would think the story would have ended. Then again this was a film franchise and when it comes to Hollywood box office who cares?The film opens *spoiler* with a film within a  film within a film as our ever popular teens are watching the STAB DVDs, movies in this film series based on the first movie's events and on the book written by character Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette). And as with the other films, these teens end up being killed by another murderer in a Ghostface mask. With all suspects deceased who could be doing the killings now?Returning to her hometown of Woodsboro, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is on a book tour promoting her own book about how she dealt with the after effects of what she went through and became a stronger person. Gale is now married to Dewey (David Arquette) who is now the Sheriff. Sydney also has family left in town, her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) and niece Jill (Emma Roberts). It's not long before people start trying to connect Sydney's return with that of Ghostface.But times have changed since the original story began. Cell phones are more prominent as is the internet. Schoolmates of Jill have their own websites where they broadcast what's going on in their lives non-stop, sort of Facebook taken to the extreme. Jill becomes the center of the story as it is her friends who keep getting murdered one at a time until Ghostface lays out his plans for Sydney during one of his phone calls with her when he tells her he plans on killing everyone around her and saving her for last. Again one has to ask who is the killer this time around when everyone died in the previous films? All in good time.The basic formula holds true here but the movie also acknowledges that times have changed. One student named Charlie (Rory Culkin) is the horror film fanatic this time around. He and one of his friends discuss with their film society that the rules for horror films have changed since they've become so popular. What was expected in the first film is now the norm so the opposite must be true this time around. This humorous take on the movie looking in on itself and the slasher genre was what made the first films so fun and it does again this time around.The body count rises and with it the number of suspects dwindles. The last teens gather together for a party at one's house and we know that the new Ghostface will soon follow. So who is it? I won't spoil that for you.The movie falls in line with the previous 3 in great form, offering up not just a serial killer on the lose but carrying on the story from start to finish as well. It continues to take a look at itself in a non-serious way, making fun of the standard things that happen in all slasher films including itself. It's this self examination that makes the SCREAM films work where others have failed.Director Wes Craven returns to the director's chair as does screenwriter Kevin Williamson. They started the series and they're here to keep it going. The same is true of the main cast, all returning to play out the roles they began some 15 years ago. It's nice to see them stick with it rather than play out the usual Hollywood fight for more money. Fans hate to see new actors in old roles.The jump scenes are there, the stabbings and fights are there and the solution to the mystery is held in check until the final third act. Guessing who the killer was has always been one of the things that made SCREAM so interesting and it remains for part 4. So if you're looking for a treat this Halloween, give SCREAM 4 a chance. And with the original 3 out on blu-ray, perhaps now would be a good time to add all of them to your collection or have a movie marathon for the holiday.",4,NICE ADDITION TO THE FRANCHISE,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4050,"['Honestly', 'am', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Halloween', 'masks', 'Ghostface', 'mask', 'killers', 'SCREAM', 'films', 'wear', 'year', 'Halloween', 'Enough', 'already', 'being', 'said', 'nice', 'see', 'new', 'film', 'SCREAM', 'franchise', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'folks', 'rent', 'Halloween', 'season', 'potential', 'killers', 'killed', 'off', 'parts', '1-3', 'would', 'think', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'film', 'franchise', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'box', 'office', 'who', 'film', '*spoiler*', 'film', 'film', 'film', 'ever', 'popular', 'teens', 'are', 'watching', 'STAB', 'DVDs', 'movies', 'film', 'series', 'based', 'first', 'movie', 'events', 'book', 'written', 'character', 'Gale', 'Weathers', 'Courtney', 'Cox-Arquette', 'other', 'films', 'teens', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'murderer', 'Ghostface', 'mask', 'suspects', 'deceased', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'doing', 'killings', 'now', 'Returning', 'hometown', 'Woodsboro', 'Sydney', 'Prescott', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'book', 'tour', 'promoting', 'own', 'book', 'how', 'dealt', 'effects', 'what', 'went', 'became', 'stronger', 'person', 'Gale', 'now', 'married', 'Dewey', 'David', 'Arquette', 'who', 'now', 'Sheriff', 'Sydney', 'also', 'family', 'left', 'town', 'aunt', 'Kate', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Jill', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'people', 'start', 'trying', 'connect', 'Sydney', 'return', 'Ghostface.But', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'original', 'story', 'began', 'Cell', 'phones', 'are', 'more', 'prominent', 'internet', 'Schoolmates', 'Jill', 'have', 'own', 'websites', 'where', 'broadcast', 'what', 'going', 'lives', 'non-stop', 'sort', 'Facebook', 'taken', 'extreme', 'Jill', 'center', 'story', 'friends', 'who', 'keep', 'getting', 'murdered', 'one', 'time', 'Ghostface', 'out', 'plans', 'Sydney', 'one', 'phone', 'when', 'killing', 'everyone', 'saving', 'last', 'Again', 'one', 'ask', 'who', 'killer', 'time', 'around', 'when', 'everyone', 'died', 'previous', 'films', 'good', 'time.The', 'basic', 'formula', 'true', 'here', 'movie', 'also', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'One', 'student', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'horror', 'film', 'fanatic', 'time', 'around', 'one', 'friends', 'discuss', 'film', 'society', 'rules', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'changed', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'What', 'was', 'expected', 'first', 'film', 'now', 'norm', 'opposite', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'time', 'around', 'humorous', 'take', 'movie', 'looking', 'slasher', 'genre', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'films', 'so', 'fun', 'again', 'time', 'body', 'count', 'rises', 'number', 'suspects', 'dwindles', 'last', 'teens', 'gather', 'together', 'party', 'one', 'house', 'know', 'new', 'Ghostface', 'will', 'soon', 'follow', 'So', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.The', 'movie', 'line', 'previous', '3', 'great', 'form', 'offering', 'up', 'not', 'just', 'serial', 'killer', 'lose', 'carrying', 'story', 'start', 'finish', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'look', 'non-serious', 'way', 'making', 'fun', 'standard', 'things', 'happen', 'slasher', 'films', 'including', 'self', 'examination', 'SCREAM', 'films', 'work', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'failed.Director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'director', 'chair', 'screenwriter', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'started', 'series', ""'re"", 'here', 'keep', 'going', 'same', 'true', 'main', 'cast', 'returning', 'play', 'out', 'roles', 'began', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'nice', 'see', 'stick', 'rather', 'play', 'out', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'fight', 'more', 'money', 'Fans', 'hate', 'see', 'new', 'actors', 'old', 'roles.The', 'jump', 'scenes', 'are', 'there', 'stabbings', 'fights', 'are', 'there', 'solution', 'mystery', 'held', 'check', 'final', 'third', 'act', 'Guessing', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'SCREAM', 'interesting', 'part', '4', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'treat', 'Halloween', 'give', 'SCREAM', '4', 'chance', 'original', '3', 'blu-ray', 'perhaps', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'add', 'collection', 'have', 'movie', 'marathon', 'holiday']",N/A

It was the film for the 90s teen scene.When I heard they were making a fourth film I was not pleased. My worry was tamed a bit when I learned that the main characters were coming back. But once again, we're dealing with a series that was successful many years ago and they're trying to bring it back ten years later. I'm trying to think of any positive example where this worked...Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to her hometown with her new book. Police Officer Dewey (David Arquette) is now the Sheriff and his wife, Gale (Courtney Cox) is trying to get her swagger back.Since they are too old for the current generation, new characters have been added to the bloodbath. We have Sidney's younger cousin and her classmates who basically rehash the original characters with less depth. (If that's even possible)The reveal is one of the worst of all time in horror who-done-it. The motive frighteningly resonates with the current media-saturated/youtube loving kids. But this movie isn't as scary as the originals were. Ghostface was relegated to the jump out and ""gotcha"" moments instead of the truly horrifying pursuit moments.I thought the language was extreme for this outing. I couldn't remember this many F-bombs being thrown around with the first film.

The franchise, especially Scream, the first movie was a huge staple of my childhood. It was one of the first movies that scared the life out of me. It didn't help that my idiot older brother and his friends pulled a disgusting prank on my friends and I after we watched that movie (consequently ingraining our fears forevermore). Luckily, this reboot pays homage to the first Scream. It follows the same formula, but adds new blood (for lack of a better word) mixed in with many of the original characters. It was a bit dry of humor, but nevertheless, I still consider it a much better film than Scream 3, which frankly was disastrous. My only wish is that they included Skeet Ulrich (easily the best villian of the 4 movies) as his original character. The other villains seem dull compared to his unbalanced character. As a suggestion, they could have him been mistakenly pronounced dead in the first movie to suddenly wake from a coma hellbent on revenge. Or they could incorporate a new character that is related to him such as a long lost brother or cousin. I realize the likelyhood of that happening is nill but it's not an unreasonable suggestion.

1414851,A1WJZABTJOW65B,B004LWZW2O,"Michael A. Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[3, 7]","There's an unwarranted snobbishness toward recent horror trends that resides at the heart of Scream 4. For a film that opens with a pithy dismissal of the torture-porn genre, arguing the likes of Saw lack character development and are ""not scary...just gross,"" what exactly does Scream 4 offer? With horror remakes being the target this time out, it seems the writers decided they needn't come up with new ideas themselves, and simply retread old ground, hoping the viewer finds what is effectively a remake of the original Scream clever rather than lazy. A discussion at the school's Cinema Club, where the kids debate the fascination with rebooting old horror franchises smacks of desperation, as the writers try to justify their own lack of new material. Scream 4 desperately looks to make itself relevant by attempting to dissect the horror genre once again, but lacks the wit and insight of previous installments to pull it off. References to Facebook and Twitter seem destined to date the movie, as its fascination with modern technology threatens to overtake the horror elements of the screenplay. More pressingly, having openly badmouthed the Saw franchise for its lack of depth, Scream 4 is amazingly anemic itself, nothing but a poor whodunit, with characters that are stereotypes. Yes, the stereotypical nature of the characters is intentional--I get that--but that still doesn't excuse the sloppily written roles.The major problem with Scream 4 comes from the disconnect between Sidney and the kids who make up the lion's share of the victims. Is Sidney supposed to be the main character, or is it her cousin Jill and her group of copy and paste friends who are supposed to be taking our focus? It's never really made clear, as the film feebly tries to pass the torch to a new generation. The result is what feels like a parody of Scream, with Sidney, Dewey, and Gale making cameo appearances. To be fair, the two disparate groups do come together during the final act, which sees the killer revealed and their motives detailed. To say it's an unsatisfying conclusion is an understatement; and if Craven, Williamson, and Kruger think this passes muster as a deconstruction of the remake/reboot philosophy that plagues the genre presently, they are very much mistaken. There is the slightest semblance of an interesting idea here, when the killer explains the lengths they are prepared to go to in order to ""remake"" the original killings, which brutally rips up modern pop culture and the quest to attain fame at all costs. Thanks to Kruger's inability to shape characters, and Willamson's refusal to take risks, even this falls flat. One good speech does not a good movie make, and Williamson and Kruger would do well to remember that cramming all your best ideas into one monologue is not enough to make up for an otherwise languid 110 minutes.",2,Why bother?,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2857,"['unwarranted', 'snobbishness', 'recent', 'horror', 'resides', 'heart', 'Scream', '4', 'film', 'pithy', 'dismissal', 'torture-porn', 'genre', 'arguing', 'likes', 'Saw', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'just', 'gross', 'what', 'exactly', 'Scream', '4', 'offer', 'horror', 'remakes', 'being', 'target', 'time', 'out', 'writers', 'decided', 'need', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ideas', 'simply', 'retread', 'old', 'ground', 'hoping', 'viewer', 'what', 'effectively', 'remake', 'original', 'Scream', 'clever', 'rather', 'lazy', 'discussion', 'school', 'Cinema', 'Club', 'where', 'kids', 'debate', 'fascination', 'rebooting', 'old', 'horror', 'smacks', 'desperation', 'writers', 'try', 'justify', 'own', 'lack', 'new', 'material', 'Scream', '4', 'desperately', 'make', 'relevant', 'attempting', 'dissect', 'horror', 'genre', 'once', 'again', 'wit', 'insight', 'previous', 'installments', 'pull', 'off', 'References', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'seem', 'destined', 'date', 'movie', 'fascination', 'modern', 'technology', 'overtake', 'horror', 'elements', 'screenplay', 'More', 'pressingly', 'having', 'openly', 'badmouthed', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'lack', 'depth', 'Scream', '4', 'amazingly', 'anemic', 'nothing', 'poor', 'whodunit', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'Yes', 'stereotypical', 'nature', 'characters', 'intentional', 'get', 'still', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'sloppily', 'written', 'roles.The', 'major', 'problem', 'Scream', '4', 'disconnect', 'Sidney', 'kids', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'lion', 'share', 'victims', 'Sidney', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'cousin', 'Jill', 'group', 'copy', 'paste', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'focus', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'film', 'feebly', 'pass', 'torch', 'new', 'generation', 'result', 'what', 'parody', 'Scream', 'Sidney', 'Dewey', 'Gale', 'making', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'be', 'fair', 'two', 'disparate', 'groups', 'do', 'come', 'together', 'final', 'act', 'killer', 'revealed', 'motives', 'detailed', 'say', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', 'understatement', 'Craven', 'Williamson', 'Kruger', 'think', 'muster', 'deconstruction', 'remake/reboot', 'philosophy', 'genre', 'presently', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'mistaken', 'slightest', 'semblance', 'interesting', 'idea', 'here', 'when', 'killer', 'lengths', 'are', 'prepared', 'go', 'order', 'remake', 'original', 'killings', 'brutally', 'up', 'modern', 'pop', 'culture', 'quest', 'attain', 'fame', 'costs', 'Thanks', 'Kruger', 'inability', 'shape', 'characters', 'Willamson', 'refusal', 'take', 'risks', 'even', 'flat', 'One', 'good', 'speech', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'Williamson', 'Kruger', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'remember', 'cramming', 'best', 'ideas', 'one', 'monologue', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'otherwise', 'languid', '110', 'minutes']",N/A

1414853,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B004LWZW2O,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 9]","What is the point of Wes Craven trying to re-spark interest in this franchise? On one hand, you could take your hat off to Wes and say you are glad he just made a sequel, and didn't try to kick-start the whole thing again and fall into the Nightmare On Elm St and Friday the 13th re-boot that has screwed those franchises up for good. But then again, out of all the movies Wes could have made a sequel, why did he chose this one? Why would you chose the film that made way for the parody classic ""Scary Movie""? I'm willing to bet Scary Movie has been watched again and again by more people who watched Scream once. And the first thing I laughed at in Scream 4 was seeing the returning characters, and hearing that name Gale, and just hearing Dave Sheridan's voice saying, ""GALE SWALLOWS"". Then of coarse Dewey comes onto screen, still looking the same, still with that bad 70's looking mustache, and all I could think of was Special Officer Doofy. The movie was made fun of so well, that I just can not look at Scream the same way ever again, and yet, here they all come back for a 4th and unwanted installment.So the plot to this one goes; it's been a few years since Michael Myers... I mean, Jason, err, Leather... oh yeah, Booggedy Booggeda Mask, had left an impact on Nancy's...no...Cindy?... errr, Nev Campbell' characters life. So now on the such and such anniversary date, Ghost Wimp has become some sort of iconic joke to everyone but whats-her-face and Monica, I mean whats-her-face-too, oh yeah, GALE SWALLOWS and her husband Doofus. A copy-cat killer returns and people die, you try to work out who the killer is by the end, and are not treated to any good death scenes, just a few stabs in the back guaranteed to harm a few voice boxes from all the snoring they will be doing.Basically, this whole thing seemed almost identical to every other Scream movie, only this time a few things are inserted into the mix to try and up-date it a little, but quite frankly, phones has already been done-to-death, deaths on Web-Cams have also been done to death, and if anything, the characters needed makeovers instead of trying to look exactly the way they did 15 years ago or so. The other thing that I was wondering, was Wes trying again to use a similar plot to Wes Cravens New Nightmare? By the end of the movie, he didn't quite go there, but it seemed like he may have had the idea to do it, because it was certainly acting like it was. I wont leave spoilers of what scenes in particular, but if you have seen both movies, you may also get that vibe.I dunno Wes, try helping out the Nightmare On Elm st franchise get back on it's feet instead of recycling the same movie, adding a phone and web-cam to the mix and thinking it's going to stand out as different to the other 3 movies. And again, take into very considerable consideration that maybe making a movie that has been made into a laughing stock (Scary Movie) may make audiences laugh at the fact that this one is still trying to take itself seriously as a horror movie. And double goes for trying to compete with today's horror where a knife in the back and flesh wounds are not creative enough to make an audience react.

Here we go again. When I was in my teens I found the first Scream film to be quite scary, but now I just enjoy how fun they are to watch. They never took themselves too seriously and the now iconic killer or rather killers, complete with a trademark mask, ranks up there with Michael Myers, Jason and Wes Craven's other creation, Freddy Krueger.The opening scenes of a Scream film are usually one of the highlights and this one did not disappoint. You think you are watching two girls being murdered, then you realize two other girls are watching that movie which a moment ago you thought was reality. It does this a couple of times to comedic effect. The story isn't much different than the other three movies, but I liked that they took on the often horrible horror remake trend. As in horror remakes today, Scream 4 follows the pattern of more blood and a higher than ever body count. So they are making fun of it and at the same time doing that very thing.The cast is full of young attractive girls who get savagely murdered (this is a slasher film after all), which gives the impression that if you're average in the look department you might have a shot at surviving. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette all return for the fourth time and slip back into their roles with ease. Part of the big reveal of the killer or killers at the end caught me by surprise. At first I didn't buy it, but without giving anything away, the performance by the actor became more believable through brutality and came off quite chilling.Far from a classic, but Scream 4 is my favorite of the sequels and is a blood soaked ride from start to finish.",4,You can't kill a Ghost...face,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1804,"['been', 'decade', 'Ghostface', 'last', 'showed', 'up', 'chasing', 'poor', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'killing', 'just', 'everyone', 'even', 'slightest', 'connection', 'Here', 'go', 'again', 'When', 'was', 'teens', 'found', 'first', 'Scream', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'scary', 'now', 'just', 'enjoy', 'how', 'fun', 'are', 'watch', 'never', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'now', 'iconic', 'killer', 'rather', 'killers', 'complete', 'trademark', 'mask', 'there', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'other', 'creation', 'Freddy', 'Krueger.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Scream', 'film', 'are', 'usually', 'one', 'highlights', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'think', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'girls', 'being', 'murdered', 'then', 'realize', 'two', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'moment', 'thought', 'was', 'reality', 'couple', 'times', 'comedic', 'effect', 'story', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'other', 'three', 'movies', 'liked', 'took', 'often', 'horrible', 'horror', 'remake', 'trend', 'horror', 'remakes', 'today', 'Scream', '4', 'pattern', 'more', 'blood', 'higher', 'ever', 'body', 'count', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'doing', 'very', 'thing.The', 'cast', 'full', 'young', 'attractive', 'girls', 'who', 'get', 'savagely', 'murdered', 'slasher', 'film', 'impression', ""'re"", 'average', 'look', 'department', 'might', 'have', 'shot', 'surviving', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'David', 'Arquette', 'return', 'fourth', 'time', 'slip', 'back', 'roles', 'ease', 'Part', 'big', 'reveal', 'killer', 'killers', 'end', 'caught', 'surprise', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'performance', 'actor', 'became', 'more', 'believable', 'brutality', 'came', 'off', 'quite', 'chilling.Far', 'classic', 'Scream', '4', 'favorite', 'sequels', 'blood', 'soaked', 'ride', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

Hayden Pannetier, Mary McDonnell, Adam Brody and others threaten to bring fresh perspective 4th time round. Plotwise - well, more of the same, if you've seen the previous 3 you're in for no surprises, and if you haven't seen them, go watch Scream 1 instead of this one..  It does feel as if Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson between them have mis-stepped here.  Or more precisely, after stumbling somewhat on Scream 3, this feels more like they've fallen on their faces.  There's more of an emphasis on satisfying fans with references both within and outwith the franchise (the existence of theSAW Complete Horror Collection DVD BOX 1.2.3.4.5 Unrated, Uncut I-Vfranchise and its ilk are acknowledged), and seemingly a bit less on scares, although a few moments work in an unsurprising sort of way.  On the plus side, an introduction satirically shows the absurdity of ever more sequels on the same franchise, and there's a  `new and updated' angle on the formula here, revolving around the social networking - youtube generation. On the down side, this just isn't enough to stop the movie from proceeding to walk through every yawn inducing clich&eacute; of the genre, in a singularly unironic way.  Sadly, a franchise which was once a refreshingly new angle and breath of fresh air for horror movies, has become oddly dated and irrelevant.I don't remember hearing a clamour for this sequel.. especially 11 years after the last one.  But if you are in the mood for a little nostalgia, you'll perhaps enjoy the routine slashing, and also the familiar faces (albeit with the help of a little more makeup) of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette.

1414868,A3HNBLO0KIJVTS,B004LWZW2O,"paper tiger ""Adriel August""","[2, 4]","THE MOVIE:First off let me say I love the original Scream Trilogy and I was looking very forward to seeing the fourth installment. Sadly, what could have been a great movie was demolished by bad acting/casting which made it almost unwatchable. It is violent, gory, and did have a couple surprises. However less than half way through I knew who the killer(s) was and I tried to be patient as I sat through the dull laughable plot until the semi climatic ending, which was a letdown.As I watched this with 5 other friends and between the laughing at the plot/acting and the dumbfounded looks as the credits started to roll, I immediately hopped on Amazon to try and return or sell this thing back just to get it off my shelf. We actually re-watched some parts just to get a laugh due to stupid lines and silly looks on the actors' faces.Between the now devoiced Courteney Cox's horrible lip job and David Arquette's acting, Scream 4 is a highly passable, easily forgettable, brings nothing new to the table sequel to a great horror trilogy. In that way, it sort of reminds me of Terminator Salvation. While Terminator Salvation was a good movie, it did not bring anything new to the main story or plot within the Terminator series. It is a movie which could be skipped and you could watch the next movie in the series and not miss a beat. I hate that. I want change. I want a huge plot twist which changes everything and loops in the original films. I can understand that they didn't want to do too much to tarnish the Scream series, however something new would have been nice.One thing I can say is it was bloody violent. That is something they greatly improved on, the gore. The cast is quite large and there could be many suspects throughout the film. But to me, one person stood out as who the killer could be and I was right. This person had motive and it just made sense for this person to do it. Even so the end did have some twists and it was entertaining. But getting to the ending was annoying and tiresome.I think me being an x-military police officer I picked up on a lot of things that were incorrect. Like how to hold a frickin gun, clearing a room/house, basic conversation between suspects or victims. The cops were so stupid in this movie it seems like they were trying to make them look stupid as the comic relief. In the end it just made the movie worse than it already was. I know the movie takes place in a smaller town, however cops are not all that stupid. Just officer Doofy.Although it did have it's slightly entertaining moments, over-all I am highly disappointed and discussed at Wes for having anything to do with such a mess of a film.The Blu-ray:The AQ was great with deep base and wonderful highs. However the filter they used for the video was a nightmare. Every time there was a bright light or car headlight pointed toward the camera there were huge nasty looking rings around any light source. Very distracting and just looked dumb. I understand they may have been going for this effect, but in the end it was just distracting from the bad acting. Most daylight scenes were clear and crisp, however the night scenes were silly looking with the light rings.May be worth a rent or streaming, however if you are a Scream fan, it may ruin the series for you.

1414872,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004LWZW2O,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 4]","I'll start off by mentioning that I'm a big fan of the Scream franchise. All three are bloody brilliant and so as you could tell, when I saw the trailer for the fourth one, I was really excited. I actually counted down the days until it came out, and even went to go see this at the cinema today.In my opinion, Scream 4 was an alright movie. It wasn't one of the better ones, but it was way better than Wes Craven's insipid effort ""My Soul to Take"". However, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, so instead of getting into a long ass review, I'll just break down the good and the bad.WARNING: HERE BE SPOILERS.WHAT SCREAM 4 DOES RIGHT:-I loved the commentary on the remake/ridiculously long franchises trend. I've been thinking the same way that the characters in the opening scene did about the Stab movies- their thoughts echo my thoughts about the Saw franchise. I actually laughed when Wes fracked with our mind and gave us ""STAB 6"" *2 minutes later* ""STAB 7"". In fact, the last few Saw movies were so ridiculous, they may as well have done what Stab 7 did. And the remake commentary was hilarious too. Wes basically remakes the final act of Scream here, in a commentary about remakes. The kitchen scene and not to mention the spoof of Steve's gutting (the character here doesn't get gutted though).-Speaking of which, I loved the opening scene. The ""Scene within a scene within a scene"" was a total WTF moment, and in a good way. The audience shared a collective WTF moment, it was magical.-Ghostface is fast and brutal in this one. It's actually scary how fast the killer moved and what not. Totally angry and you could tell Wes cared about making this the ""Scream of all screams"".-The dialogue and characters. Two things, if you ask me, make a good movie: Characters and dialogue. And it offered plenty of good characters and clever dialogue. I laughed a lot of the time, Gale is her usual bitchy self and her ""YOUR LEMON SQUARES TASTE LIKE ASS!!!!"" at the beginning had me laughing. As well as the characters- Erik Knudsen's character stole the show with his geeky ""head-cam"" and what not. Hayden was really cool (it also helps that she is really hot too!!!) and overall, I gotta say they redeemed this rather uneven movie.WHAT SCREAM 4 GOT WRONG:-Is it just me or did the entire second half consist of the reveal of the killers??? Mind you I know Scream 1 did this, but it was done way better. For one, it spent equal time on Billy and Stu, but here the second half was the Jill show. It's like 5 minutes after the reveal of the killers and then suddenly BAM, she kills him off. It also doesn't help that they weren't that good of killers either. And we really didn't need to see her manipulating the evidence, stabbing herself, etc. Not to mention the hospital scene went on for WAAAAAAY TOO LONG. I liked the hospital stuff, it was intense, but I was checking my watch towards the end of it a few times, it was really that long.-I'm sorry but Erik Knudsen, as much as I love his character, is no Randy. Maybe I'm just too much a nostalgia buff but I just felt like Wes was trying way too hard to make him the new Randy. I still loved his character though and his pre-death come-out scene had me in tears laughing.-This movie was too spoofy if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but this movie relied too much on the funny stuff. Part of what made the first three movies awesome was the balance of funny and scary. Here... they just cared about stupid humor and what not and inappropriately placed one liners.-This felt like it was directed by about 10 different directors. I swear some scenes were beyond surrealism (and not in a good way). It's like Wes couldn't make his mind up about the type of feel his movie was supposed to have.-I found a lot of the movie too slowly paced. I mean, in the middle it kinda dragged and there were about like maybe 2 kills. It worked in the first three because of one thing: Character development. There wasn't here, it was just conversation after conversation after conversation KILL conversation conversation conversation conversation conversation KILL. I can sit through movies with a lot of talking but I found my patience kind of tested.-Sidney getting stabbed twice??? I'm sorry but that was just too unrealistic.So overall, this was an enjoyable movie. Not without its share of problems, but still worthwhile nonetheless. IMO, the worst of the series, but that said, I think Wes knows he's doing good, so he could make another 2 movies and I wouldn't mind.",3,"Sorry Wes, but you've forced me YET AGAIN

Also the issues they encounter feel more relatable as they are more like common problems anyone in their positions would face.The new characters were great to see, adding great personalities.

1414878,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B004LWZW2O,RJ Smoove,"[1, 2]","Remember that first phone call to a teenage Drew Barrymore that started it all? Even those who have never seen a single Scream film know the famous five word question that became a staple of teens in the 90's, Horror geeks, and popculture alike. Fastforward two sequels, and fifteen years later, and here we are. Call it a reboot, ot a plain old sequel. Scream 4 is a solid sequel, worthy of its place in the series. Now was as good a time as any to drop another possible sequel, and trilogy on the public. In a time where shitty remakes of every single Horror flick from the 80's, torture porn and paranormal flicks are the only representatives of a genre that seems to struggle much more than it should, the old fashioned slasher was in desperate need of a comeback. Sure there's Hatchet, but nothing compares to the ""meta"" (a term that's rightfully made fun of in Scream 4), or self-referential satire that is Scream. And I'm happy to say that Ghostface is back with a vengeance. The dialogue is as sharp as the new and improved CGI knife that our antagonist uses, and it's eqally as witty as any of the previous installments.Being a fan of all three of all the previous films (yes, even the third one, but barely), I had high hopes for this one. No high expectations, but certainly high hopes. Kevin Williamson had the idea for a new trilogy, so it wasn't just greedy studios trying to milk a popular franchise that's been in hibernation for over a decade. If you're going to revive a series, that's the way to do it. He and Wes Craven have returned with a satirical Horror/Comedy mix that takes aim at the above mentioned remakes and torture porn, reboots, and once again sequels. I disagree with other reviews that I've read that said the Comedic aspects over-powered the Suspense. I never found the series to be all that scary or suspenseful to begin with, so I'm not sure what people were expecting. How scary can a guy with a knife be? A mortal, human guy with a knife, that is. In my opinion, this series has always played more for laughs, jumps and pure fun, not really ""scares"". So with that being said, I got everything I was looking for, and that was a plus.Another plus is the original main three returning. Thank God their careers have sucked ass since the third film, otherwise they may have thought they were too good to come back. Seeing them again really brought the series full-circle. The new faces were really good as well. Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Rory Culkin, Erik Knudsen, a big-eyed Marley Shelton, and many others. One of my favorites was Anthony Anderson. He's nothing special, but there's just something about his character that I enjoyed. David Arquette is as funny as ever as the bumbling Barney Fife-esque town sheriff. Courtney Cox had no trouble picking up her character where she left off either. It goes without saying, but Neve Campbell looks just as good as she did when this all started. I won't spoil who lives, and who dies, because that's part of the thrill ride, but I will say that final reveal should probably surprise most people. It didn't surprise me because the ending was spoiled for me by someone on another website, but I still had fun with learning the killer, or killers' motivations.Now all of that is not to say that Scream 4 is perfect. To be honest, it's not even a great film. At times, I fell like the shots at other Horror franchises were uncalled for. I love that about the series, but this one seemed to forget that it's last sequel wasn't that good either. Probably wouldn't be able to tell Craven that though. I hated how all of the characters, with the exceptions of Sydney, seemed unphased by the fact that their friends and family were getting slaughtered. Is that little town so used to the Ghostface serial killers that there like car accidents to them, as far as the gravity of the news? Wouldn't any normal group of kids be terrified, and not hosting Stabathons? Honestly, it may have only been the new characters. The three veterans were fine. I think this was a huge oversight by the writer an director, but if you can get past it, there's plenty of excitement and fun to be had with this movie. And isn't that really what Scream is about? All in all, Scream 4 comes highly recommended to fans of the series, but modestly to those who have never seen any of the Scream films. If you hate the previous three, skip it.",4,"""New Decade.

1414879,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B004LWZW2O,RMurray847,"[3, 7]","SCREAM 4 feels so much like a throwback to another era, that your enjoyment of it will probably relate directly to how much you enjoyed the original trilogy.  If your interest was deep and abiding...you will probably love visiting the old characters again and enjoying the modern day spin on the old formula (lots of clever uses for cell phones and text messaging that weren't part of the original world).  If you only found them to be enjoyable but not exactly earth-shaking (that's my category) you will have a pleasant but almost immediately forgettable time.  And if you hated the first 3...you'll likely hate #4 as well.The SCREAM movies (and 4 is no different) were created by writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven as a way to revive the horror movie by poking fun at the conventions of the ""slasher"" movie while also being a fairly scary slasher movie at the same time.  And as is typical of series like these, the rewards of the movies began to dim as each sequel came out...pretty much in direct relation to how complicated and self-aware the sequels grew.  SCREAM 4 has a very twisty opening sequence (as did all the prior films) that lets us know we're back on familiar ground.  I pretty much knew how much I'd enjoy the overall film after the 1st ten minutes.  I smiled and jumped in my seat a little...but also had a sad feeling that the time for these films had passed and that no ""new life"" was going to be breathed into them.In the past, the films featured lots of young stars and starlets getting killed off by the Ghostface Killer (a mask that continues to be quite creepy).  Unlike the slasher films SCREAM was poking fun at, SCREAM featured youngsters with some name recognition.  Neve Campbell was already well known from PARTY OF FIVE, etc.  This made the films kind of trashy fun.  And anchoring all the action were the two ""adults"", played by Courtney Cox and David Arquette.  Now Cox & Arquette are older, and Campbell is far from her young adult days too.  They are still the main characters in SCREAM 4, but they are surrounded by a number of up-and-coming youngsters, particularly Emma Roberts, Hayden Panetierre & Rory Culkin.  (In cameos, we also get to enjoy Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell.)The plot focuses around Neve Campbell's character Sydney returning to her old town to promote her book.  The Killer reappears at the same time, and kids start dropping left and right.  A haphazard investigation ensues, mostly involving people making the usual stupid choices that put them into unneeded danger.The reason the film doesn't quite work doesn't have too much to do with the film itself.  It is a competent reboot of the concept.  Except for the fact that so much time has passed for the three main characters, and technology has changed (again, new technology is used in an amusing manner, although apparently no one in this town ever has their phone battery run down, no matter how much video you stream), SCREAM 4 could have been made right after SCREAM 3 a decade ago and fit right in.No, the problem is that horror/slasher movies have moved on since SCREAM 3.  We've had the FINAL DESTINATION franchise to pick up the mantel of rococo death sequences involving mostly teens getting killed (and running the world, apparently).  We've had SAW and the birth, rise and decline of the ""torture porn"" genre.  We've had THE RING and all the other ""Japanese inspired"" ghost stories.  We've even had the odd resurgence of the vampire.  The genre's SCREAM 4 pokes fun at simply don't resonate any more.  Thus the movie feels old-fashioned in a way that's ever so slightly embarrassing for the viewer.  And the fact that Neve Campbell in particular looks a little embarrassed to be in the film doesn't help.  Williamson is a clever screenwriter (not witty, but skilled with a plot twist) and Craven is a workman -like director (see his RED EYE instead, particularly the chilling first 2/3rds).  But there was no public demand for SCREAM 4, and the movie itself mostly proves that there was no NEED for any public demand.",3,Fairly enjoyable but not really needed reboot.,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,4055,"['SCREAM', '4', 'feels', 'so', 'much', 'throwback', 'era', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'probably', 'relate', 'directly', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'trilogy', 'interest', 'was', 'deep', 'abiding', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'visiting', 'old', 'characters', 'again', 'enjoying', 'modern', 'day', 'spin', 'old', 'formula', 'lots', 'clever', 'uses', 'cell', 'phones', 'text', 'messaging', 'were', ""n't"", 'part', 'original', 'world', 'only', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'exactly', 'earth-shaking', 'category', 'will', 'have', 'pleasant', 'almost', 'immediately', 'forgettable', 'time', 'hated', 'first', '3', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'hate', '4', 'well.The', 'SCREAM', 'movies', '4', 'different', 'were', 'created', 'writer', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'way', 'revive', 'horror', 'movie', 'poking', 'fun', 'conventions', 'slasher', 'movie', 'also', 'being', 'fairly', 'scary', 'slasher', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'typical', 'series', 'rewards', 'movies', 'began', 'dim', 'sequel', 'came', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'direct', 'relation', 'how', 'complicated', 'self-aware', 'sequels', 'grew', 'SCREAM', '4', 'very', 'twisty', 'opening', 'sequence', 'did', 'prior', 'films', 'know', ""'re"", 'back', 'familiar', 'ground', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'overall', 'film', '1st', 'ten', 'minutes', 'smiled', 'jumped', 'seat', 'little', 'also', 'had', 'sad', 'feeling', 'time', 'films', 'had', 'passed', 'new', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'breathed', 'them.In', 'past', 'films', 'featured', 'lots', 'young', 'stars', 'starlets', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'Ghostface', 'Killer', 'mask', 'be', 'quite', 'creepy', 'slasher', 'films', 'SCREAM', 'was', 'poking', 'fun', 'SCREAM', 'featured', 'youngsters', 'name', 'recognition', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'known', 'PARTY', 'OF', 'FIVE', 'etc', 'made', 'films', 'kind', 'trashy', 'fun', 'anchoring', 'action', 'were', 'two', 'adults', 'played', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Now', 'Cox', 'Arquette', 'are', 'older', 'Campbell', 'far', 'young', 'adult', 'days', 'too', 'are', 'still', 'main', 'characters', 'SCREAM', '4', 'are', 'surrounded', 'number', 'up-and-coming', 'youngsters', 'particularly', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'cameos', 'also', 'get', 'enjoy', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'plot', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'character', 'Sydney', 'returning', 'old', 'town', 'promote', 'book', 'Killer', 'reappears', 'same', 'time', 'kids', 'start', 'dropping', 'left', 'right', 'haphazard', 'investigation', 'ensues', 'mostly', 'involving', 'people', 'making', 'usual', 'stupid', 'choices', 'put', 'unneeded', 'danger.The', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'competent', 'reboot', 'concept', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'technology', 'changed', 'again', 'new', 'technology', 'used', 'amusing', 'manner', 'apparently', 'one', 'town', 'ever', 'phone', 'battery', 'run', 'down', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'video', 'stream', 'SCREAM', '4', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'right', 'SCREAM', '3', 'decade', 'ago', 'fit', 'right', 'in.No', 'problem', 'horror/slasher', 'movies', 'have', 'moved', 'SCREAM', '3', ""'ve"", 'had', 'FINAL', 'DESTINATION', 'franchise', 'pick', 'up', 'mantel', 'rococo', 'death', 'sequences', 'involving', 'mostly', 'getting', 'killed', 'running', 'world', 'apparently', ""'ve"", 'had', 'SAW', 'birth', 'rise', 'decline', 'torture', 'porn', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'had', 'THE', 'RING', 'other', 'Japanese', 'inspired', 'ghost', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'even', 'had', 'odd', 'resurgence', 'vampire', 'genre', 'SCREAM', '4', 'pokes', 'fun', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'more', 'Thus', 'movie', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'embarrassing', 'viewer', 'fact', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'particular', 'looks', 'little', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'film', ""n't"", 'help', 'Williamson', 'clever', 'screenwriter', 'not', 'witty', 'skilled', 'plot', 'twist', 'Craven', 'workman', '-like', 'director', 'see', 'RED', 'EYE', 'instead', 'particularly', 'chilling', 'first', '2/3rds', 'was', 'public', 'demand', 'SCREAM', '4', 'movie', 'mostly', 'was', 'NEED', 'public', 'demand']",N/A

My dad described the sad sight of broken-down Willie Mays striking out as a New York Met; I'll never forget the sad sight of Michael Jordan, in a Washington Wizards uniform, getting blocked.And now there's Wes Craven's ""Scream 4,"" an unnecessary, tired sequel that brings to mind Yogurt's line from ""Spaceballs,"" ""God willing, we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money.""The pointlessness of the enterprise shows up in the very first scene, a movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie that proves the inherent stupidity of horror movie franchises that won't go out to pasture. We're once again in Woodsboro, the fictional town where it all began. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has finally cashed in on her fame by writing a self-help book, although Saint Sidney appears to believe the lie that her book is really about helping other people rather than royalties. Not coincidentally, Ghostface is also back, terrorizing Woodsboro with the trademark hunter's knife and cellphone.Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and wife/frustrated author Gale (Courteney Cox) reprise their earlier roles -- she's an ambitious witch, and he's a kind-hearted bumbler -- but sadly there is nothing left in these characters for us to care about. Ask yourself, were there any Sidney Prescott questions left unanswered?We meet the next generation of Woodsboro teens, and they're pretty much Version 4.0 of the same group we've seen before (Now With Added Snark!). The next-gen Sidney is Jill (Emma Roberts), Sidney's cousin, and she's surrounded by the Frustrated Love Interest, the Gorgeous BFF (Hayden Panettiere), the Film Geek, and so on, most of whom only exist to be sliced and diced. Everyone is hyper-aware of the fact that they are in a ""reboot"" of the original movie, yet they continue to make all the same dumb mistakes. Indeed, the self-awareness in Scream 4 is so wearisome I half-expected the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to pop up to provide in-movie commentary.Despite all these flaws, I would have liked ""Scream 4"" had it been genuinely scary. But despite a high body count and lots of blood, the scares are minor league because Ghostface does not do anything new. He calls people. He chases them. He stabs them.

And the Wayans Brothers' spoof ofScream(among a variety of other horror movies) has been a favorite for my kids lately. So when they advertised the release of Scream 4 On Demand, my oldest just ""had to"" see it. Which by default meant that I had to see it too.To me Scream 4 was pretty much Scream with an alternate ending. Semi-similar beginning; semi-similar plot; semi-similar ending as the original with a return by some of the key cast members of the original (that didn't meet their demise or get offed by Ghostface).Basically Sydney (Neve Campbell) returns to her home town--the town where all the original Scream movie action took place--to promote her book. When Ghostface shows up, Sherriff Dewey (better known as  Sherriff Doofy in Scary Movie) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) attempt to figure it all out and save the day.The result? D&eacute;j&agrave; vu. You feel like you're watching a movie that you've seen once before...or twice before...or three times before! But it was done well paying homage to the original along with other horror classics. Director Wes Craven keeps the integrity of what made the original so successful firmly in place. Nice D&eacute;j&agrave; vu for Craven too...another $100MM in the bank on the back of a Scream sequel!My perspective is that the movie was good, albeit familiar, with not a lot of originality. My son's perspective, Scream 4 being the first Scream he's seen, was that it was excellent. So if you've seen any of the other Scream movies in the series you know exactly what to expect.

I was excited to see the movie posters, advertising the film, months ago, and had since anticipated the theatrical release. I viewed the movie without expectations and I admit that overall, I did find the movie to be fun, despite the absurdity of the killers' identities, but I left dissatisfied. The opening sequence is entertaining -and heavily cliched (surprise!)- addressing the current direction of the horror genre. Contemporary horror filmmakers seem more focused on torture porn than actual suspense. And suspense is what I love about ""Scream.""I've always admired the ""Scream"" franchise for yielding tons of scares, suspense, terror, and humor all blended within a familiar environment. One of the major flaws of ""Scream 4,"" however, is that the humor is overwhelming and often downplays the suspense; you're wondering whether you're viewing a comedy (or spoof, ala ""Scary Movie"") or a slasher film. Neve Campbell's character, Sidney Prescott, was perhaps the only one I took seriously (with the exception of one particular scene). She returns to Woodsboro as a successful new author, praised for recounting the events of the original trilogy. Dewey (David Arquette) is now the Sheriff and walks without the limp, while Gale (Courtney Cox) enjoys the success of her own books -although alienating Sydney as a result- which have yielded seven ""Stab"" films. The new recruits include Sydney's teenage cousin Jill (Emma Roberts aka daughter of actor Eric Roberts) and her groupies, as well fellow classmates who are obsessed aficionados (including Rory Culkin) of the ""Stab franchise."" The story revolves around Syd's return to Woodsboro, the final stop of her book tour, and the impact it has on her family and friends when Ghostface resurfaces. Although the acting was decent, the characters weren't developed enough for you to care about their lives (sympathetic perhaps).""Scream 4"" does retain its uniqueness in the slasher category, but the scares are short-lived and obvious. There is definitely blood in this film, but aside from one grisly murder scene, gore is scarcely evident. I appreciate being able to see a modern horror flick without it submitting to degenerative torture porn. Now on to what might be spoiler material.*Possible Spoiler Alert*The worst flaw of the movie I found very disappointing: when the identities of the killers were revealed, I actually felt pained. Unexpected, yes, but I felt a realistic sense of betrayal. I realize it's a movie and that it wants its killers to remain a mystery until the climatic end, but logically one of the killers just doesn't fit the killer's profile. After watching how much the ghostface pair overpowers the victims and how much damage they can withstand, I'm perplexed that this particular character can muster the skills and emotional/physical strength required.

It had been 11 years since the last one and I was actually afraid that they might screw up what had ended appropriately. If they were going to come back to it again, they'd better do it right.Oh well they did. And I'm so glad they did it because if Scream 4 is the last 'Scream', then it is a much more relevant, interesting and more fulfilling experience as a series-ending than Scream 3 ever was. Scream 3 was all about going back to the start and unfinished business, but it lacked the strenght of the first two when it came to pure horror. It was disappointing in that way - which, since it was a HORROR movie most of all, was a pretty huge mistake.Scream 4 makes up for that. Not only in the ""horror"" aspect, but the story itself is tight and unlike many horror movies outthere, it actually feels current and fresh as the (powerful, perhaps best and most surprising) revelation of the killer(s) criticizes the ways of our society.It was great to revisit Woodsboro, and my beloved characters which were all treated with a lot of respect.

1414901,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B004LWZW2O,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","Let's face it, when a film franchise makes it to a fourth film or higher, it usually sucks. What else can they really do with it and what's left of the story to tell us that we don't already know? That was my thinking going into Scream 4, but when it comes to Wes Craven, you really never know what you're going to get. After pumping out three movies in four years, Craven took eleven years off before taking another crack at Scream, thinking why not make what's old new again, and it works! Scream 4 continues the legacy of the series by combining a classic slasher film with the technology and youth of today, who are still making a mockery of the whole situation. The screenwriting is absolutely genius, as is evident by the opening scene, which actually rivals the scene in the first film. In Scream 4, we see a grown up Sidney Prescott return home to Woodsboro a changed woman. She's there to promote her new book and catch up with her old friends, Sheriff Dewey and his wife Gail. They're all having a nice reunion, on what turns out to be the anniversary of the first killings, when all of a sudden things turn ugly again. You know the characters and you know the actors playing them. They're a little bit older, they're a little bit wiser, and they're every bit as energetic and interesting as they were in the first three films. The old school Woodsboro family meets the current Woodsboro family and what you get is something that's very similar, but oddly different. Scream 4 is witty, clever, and updated. Wes Craven was right, what was old is new again and it reminded me of just how much I loved the original films.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1628,"['Let', 'face', 'when', 'film', 'franchise', 'fourth', 'film', 'higher', 'usually', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'what', 'left', 'story', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'was', 'thinking', 'going', 'Scream', '4', 'when', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'really', 'never', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'pumping', 'out', 'three', 'movies', 'four', 'years', 'Craven', 'took', 'eleven', 'years', 'taking', 'crack', 'Scream', 'thinking', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'what', 'old', 'new', 'again', 'Scream', '4', 'legacy', 'series', 'combining', 'classic', 'slasher', 'film', 'technology', 'youth', 'today', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'making', 'mockery', 'whole', 'situation', 'screenwriting', 'absolutely', 'genius', 'evident', 'opening', 'scene', 'actually', 'scene', 'first', 'film', 'Scream', '4', 'see', 'grown', 'up', 'Sidney', 'Prescott', 'return', 'home', 'Woodsboro', 'changed', 'woman', 'there', 'promote', 'new', 'book', 'catch', 'up', 'old', 'friends', 'Sheriff', 'Dewey', 'wife', 'Gail', ""'re"", 'having', 'nice', 'reunion', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'anniversary', 'first', 'killings', 'when', 'sudden', 'things', 'turn', 'ugly', 'again', 'know', 'characters', 'know', 'actors', 'playing', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit', 'older', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit', 'wiser', ""'re"", 'bit', 'energetic', 'interesting', 'were', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'old', 'school', 'Woodsboro', 'family', 'current', 'Woodsboro', 'family', 'what', 'get', 'something', 'very', 'similar', 'oddly', 'different', 'Scream', '4', 'witty', 'clever', 'updated', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'right', 'what', 'was', 'old', 'new', 'again', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'original', 'films']",N/A
1414902,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B004LWZW2O,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[3, 6]","Making a sequel to a horror franchise more than 10 years later is often not a good thing. Sequels are usually criticized and besides, was a fourth Scream really necessary ten years later? Wasn't  Scream 3 a fitting ending to the Scream Franchise? Did Scream 4 really have to show up its face and ruin the ""perfect"" ending? A fourth Scream was not necessary after Scream 3 which concluded the franchise pretty well but it's enjoyable and entertaining nonetheless. Wes Craven returns as director and executive producer and some actors make a return to the series as well, Neve Campbell as Sydney, Courtney Cox as Gail and David Arquette as Dewey. There are plenty of new faces of course, but just about everyone in Scream has previous roles to their acting credit and this film isn't their debut. I won't say that the actors were all amazing and talented but they were definitely above what you would normally expect from horror movie quality acting.The storyline is quite simple: It's the fifteenth anniversary of the Woodsboro massacre and Sydney Prescott makes a return to Woodsboro in an effort to promote her book (of course it talks of her experience with the previous killings with her being a survivor). From there things pick up as (surprise!) a new killer makes its presence known. Maybe not the best storyline but as far as horror movies go it makes sense, allows things to slowly but progressively build things up and it makes as much sense as possibly for a sequel that's made ten years later which is a good thing.The funny thing is that Scream 4 is mocking Saw and horror movies in general for the amount of sequels they had and other aspects, it's almost exactly what it's making fun of. For instance the horror movies ""Stab"" that are often mentioned in the movie involve killings by stabbing based on the Scream franchise and the idea of many sequels is also laughed at but this is the fourth Scream (and there could possibly be more, the door is open. Maybe we'll see a new trilogy, who knows? Depending on the reactions and the success it gets). There is definitely humor but at least Scream 4 is still a slasher film and it has some intense moments and behind the humor, the thrill is still there.Without revealing anything I'll say that the kills in Scream 4 were not as brutal or gory as in the first three Scream films, here in terms of killings there wasn't anything terribly creative or anything special. I also found the killer's motive to be a bit weak this time, although I have to admit that I was surprised with the identity of Ghostface. Part of the fun for me was always trying to find out who the killer was in the Scream movies and try to figure out the motives before the end and although I was very surprised, I was also a bit disappointed at the killer and the motives this time. I thought they could have done a better job by instead having a different killer but that's just my opinion. For a horror movie sequel I consider Scream 4 to be very good and somewhat above average, fans of the franchise will definitely want to see this third sequel and I think some will be pleasantly surprised.Scream 4 is not as good as the original but it's still a good effort and it can be proud to be a good sequel. I got to give them credit, it's been more than 10 years since the last Scream and with this sudden revival they managed to keep things interesting and did a good job of not screwing up what was established. As much as some viewers are having mixed feeling, the people making this fourth Scream made a good sequel and I can't fault them for that. 3.5/5, in no way perfect but it managed to deliver a good, interesting and somewhat worthy sequel that I liked more than I thought I would.",3,Time to Scream again,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3723,"['Making', 'sequel', 'horror', 'franchise', 'more', '10', 'years', 'later', 'often', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'Sequels', 'are', 'usually', 'criticized', 'besides', 'was', 'fourth', 'Scream', 'really', 'necessary', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Scream', '3', 'fitting', 'ending', 'Scream', 'Franchise', 'Did', 'Scream', '4', 'really', 'have', 'show', 'up', 'face', 'ruin', 'perfect', 'ending', 'fourth', 'Scream', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'Scream', '3', 'concluded', 'franchise', 'pretty', 'well', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'director', 'executive', 'producer', 'actors', 'make', 'return', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Sydney', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Gail', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Dewey', 'are', 'plenty', 'new', 'course', 'just', 'everyone', 'Scream', 'previous', 'roles', 'acting', 'credit', 'film', ""n't"", 'debut', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'actors', 'were', 'amazing', 'talented', 'were', 'definitely', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'horror', 'movie', 'quality', 'acting.The', 'storyline', 'quite', 'simple', 'fifteenth', 'anniversary', 'Woodsboro', 'massacre', 'Sydney', 'Prescott', 'return', 'Woodsboro', 'effort', 'promote', 'book', 'course', 'experience', 'previous', 'killings', 'being', 'survivor', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'surprise', 'new', 'killer', 'presence', 'known', 'Maybe', 'not', 'best', 'storyline', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'movies', 'go', 'sense', 'things', 'slowly', 'progressively', 'build', 'things', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'possibly', 'sequel', 'made', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'good', 'thing.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'Scream', '4', 'mocking', 'Saw', 'horror', 'movies', 'general', 'amount', 'sequels', 'had', 'other', 'aspects', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'making', 'fun', 'instance', 'horror', 'movies', 'Stab', 'are', 'often', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'involve', 'killings', 'stabbing', 'based', 'Scream', 'franchise', 'idea', 'many', 'sequels', 'also', 'laughed', 'fourth', 'Scream', 'there', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'more', 'door', 'open', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'new', 'trilogy', 'who', 'Depending', 'reactions', 'success', 'definitely', 'humor', 'least', 'Scream', '4', 'still', 'slasher', 'film', 'intense', 'moments', 'humor', 'thrill', 'still', 'revealing', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'say', 'kills', 'Scream', '4', 'were', 'not', 'brutal', 'gory', 'first', 'three', 'Scream', 'films', 'here', 'terms', 'killings', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'terribly', 'creative', 'anything', 'special', 'also', 'found', 'killer', 'motive', 'be', 'bit', 'weak', 'time', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'identity', 'Ghostface', 'Part', 'fun', 'was', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'Scream', 'movies', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'motives', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'killer', 'motives', 'time', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'instead', 'having', 'different', 'killer', 'just', 'opinion', 'horror', 'movie', 'sequel', 'consider', 'Scream', '4', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'somewhat', 'above', 'average', 'fans', 'franchise', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'third', 'sequel', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Scream', '4', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'still', 'good', 'effort', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'be', 'good', 'sequel', 'got', 'give', 'credit', 'been', 'more', '10', 'years', 'last', 'Scream', 'sudden', 'revival', 'managed', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'screwing', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'established', 'As', 'much', 'viewers', 'are', 'having', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'people', 'making', 'fourth', 'Scream', 'made', 'good', 'sequel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', '3.5/5', 'way', 'perfect', 'managed', 'deliver', 'good', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'liked', 'more', 'thought', 'would']",N/A

However, this film brings absolutely nothing to the table in terms of originality.For a basic plot summary...oh, why even bother for this movie.  If you've seen any of the first three Scream efforts, this one is no different.  Hot chicks die, police are inept, dialogue is cripplingly bad, and Ghostface runs amok.Here's the trouble with Scream 4: The original Scream (in 1996) succeeded for two reasons.  First, it resurrected the slasher genre that had died in the 1980s, and did so with a very respectable, legitimately spooky effort.  Second, the original used the tongue-in-cheek style of humor to parody horror movies while making one.  That combination produced a riveting cinema experience, which of course was ruined by two pathetic sequels that seemed to milk the franchise dry.So, director Wes Craven tries to resurrect the franchise by going back to the approach of the '96 original.  The trouble, of course, is that a parody of a parody is, well, nothing at all.  What worked at first doesn't translate into today, no matter how many supposed ""surprises"" or plot ""twists"" are thrown in.On a side note, the film even screws up the casting.  If Hayden Panattiere is cast as a female lead, she better be ""featured"", if you know what I mean.  I'm not even talking about nudity here, but rather just a little eye candy.  Instead, there's none of it; just another area where the overall experience fails.What it comes down to, then, is that Scream 4 is not compelling in any area of its film making, whether it be plot, characters, or ""scare tactics"".
