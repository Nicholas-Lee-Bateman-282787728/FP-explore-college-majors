1046703,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000MH0V3M,Artist & Author,"[2, 3]","Kenny Rogers makes a danged good preacher in this movie, which opens with a sermon on turning the other cheek.  His nephew does his best to live by Jesus' words, even when war is declared after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, after continued taunting, harassment, and finally the rape of his fianc&eacute; by the boys in one family, his resolve is severely tested.  Just where does Jesus' admonition to turn the other cheek end and legitimate defense begin?  That is the question that must be answered in this movie.  [I am reminded of one of the 2008 Presidential candidates who naively said he would not need to fight Islamic terrorists because if we are nice to them they wouldn't want to destroy Western culture.]  The boys in that bad family didn't seem to get that message when Johnny had one where he could beat the tar out of him after he'd done one disgusting act, but chose to not harm the brother.  [All three brothers were involved in the rape.]  Traditional values families should be able to enjoy this movie, and it would be great for family discussion of the main issue in this movie.",4,An Important Ethical Issue is Explored,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,1105,"['Kenny', 'Rogers', 'danged', 'good', 'preacher', 'movie', 'sermon', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'nephew', 'best', 'live', 'Jesus', 'words', 'even', 'when', 'war', 'declared', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'However', 'continued', 'taunting', 'harassment', 'finally', 'rape', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'boys', 'one', 'family', 'resolve', 'severely', 'tested', 'Just', 'where', 'Jesus', 'admonition', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'end', 'legitimate', 'defense', 'begin', 'question', 'must', 'be', 'answered', 'movie', '[', 'am', 'reminded', 'one', '2008', 'Presidential', 'candidates', 'who', 'naively', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'fight', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'because', 'are', 'nice', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'destroy', 'Western', 'culture', ']', 'boys', 'bad', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'message', 'when', 'Johnny', 'had', 'one', 'where', 'could', 'beat', 'tar', ""'d"", 'done', 'one', 'disgusting', 'act', 'chose', 'not', 'harm', 'brother', '[', 'three', 'brothers', 'were', 'involved', 'rape', ']', 'Traditional', 'values', 'families', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'family', 'discussion', 'main', 'issue', 'movie']",Kenny Rogers: Coward of the County
