508683,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00000JZHN,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[5, 6]","It's hard to believe, but I never heard of Wind in the Willows until I was about 16 years old, when it was first read aloud to me, around a glowing campfire. It was an instant love affair.Years later, I shared the classic with my children. So when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor's tag sale, we snapped it up. We've loved the film ever since.The animal characters--Badger, Mole, Toad, Weasel  and all the others--congregate often at Toad Hall and elsewhere, and the story takes many delightful turns.This animated version, directed by Dave Unwin, is every bit as classic as the book. Your children will surely love it as much as we did--including the child in this particular mom.--Alyssa A.

508686,A3RJWHFRUA8V9O,B00000JZHN,D. Anderson,"[23, 26]","Our children already owned &amp; loved these films on VHS, so I was suprised to see both full-length movies available on a single DVD for a bargain price.  True, there are no DVD &quot;extras&quot; in addition to  the two movies, but the important part -- the animated film -- looks better  than ever on DVD.  It's a crisp transfer of the charming Beatrix  Potter-style animation (not surprising, given that these were done by the  folks resposible for the fine &quot;World of Peter Rabbit &amp;  Friends&quot; video series).These wonderful children's films deserve a  much wider viewing than I think they've received. They are faithful  adaptations of the books, and the animation is, as I mentioned before,  charming. But perhaps the best parts are the delightfully engaging voice  characterizations -- Rat (voiced by Michael Palin of Monty Python fame),  Mole, Badger, and the irrepressible Toad are all done spot-on.  Toad's wild  antics usually give our young daughters the giggles, and the motorcars and  battle heroics are bound to capture the interest of young boys.A  worthwhile purchase, or a great gift for children 2-7 who haven't yet seen  these films.",5,Charming DVD value for your kids' video library!,960508800,"06 9, 2000",2000,1165,"['children', 'already', 'owned', 'amp', 'loved', 'films', 'VHS', 'was', 'suprised', 'see', 'full-length', 'movies', 'available', 'single', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'price', 'True', 'are', 'DVD', 'quot', 'quot', 'addition', 'two', 'movies', 'important', 'part', 'animated', 'film', 'better', 'ever', 'DVD', 'crisp', 'transfer', 'charming', 'Beatrix', 'Potter-style', 'animation', 'not', 'surprising', 'given', 'were', 'done', 'folks', 'resposible', 'fine', 'quot', 'World', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'amp', 'Friends', 'quot', 'video', 'series', '.These', 'wonderful', 'children', 'films', 'deserve', 'much', 'wider', 'viewing', 'think', ""'ve"", 'received', 'are', 'faithful', 'adaptations', 'books', 'animation', 'mentioned', 'charming', 'perhaps', 'best', 'parts', 'are', 'delightfully', 'engaging', 'voice', 'characterizations', 'Rat', 'voiced', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'Monty', 'Python', 'fame', 'Mole', 'Badger', 'irrepressible', 'Toad', 'are', 'done', 'spot-on', 'Toad', 'wild', 'antics', 'usually', 'give', 'young', 'daughters', 'giggles', 'motorcars', 'battle', 'heroics', 'are', 'bound', 'capture', 'interest', 'young', 'boys.A', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'great', 'gift', 'children', '2-7', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'films']",The Wind in the Willows/The Willows in Winter
508687,ALBJ1ST4216FI,B00000JZHN,"LME ""The Discerning Viewer""","[2, 2]","This is the third version of The Wind in the Willows that we watched.The first was ok and may likely appeal more to adults who grew up with the story.  It was the live action 2006 Masterpiece Theatre take on the story.  Fun, but not great for repeat viewing.The second was the Claymation version which was made in 1983 with Richard Pearson and Ian Carmichael (re-released 2004).  We definitely enjoyed it but still made the effort to obtain the scarcer version (our third, below) with Vanessa Redgrave as narrator.This one, the third, was charming.  It obviously followed the book storyline, used the British turn of phrase, and made the creatures absolutely delightful.  The production style reminded me of the Beatrix Potter videos we had so loved.  Those were quite superior productions as well.  This Wind in the Willows is by far the best one we viewed and needs to be re-released.If this story is to be viewed by a youngster with no experience of British accents and phraseology, it is possible that my #2 pick with the Claymation characters might be slightly preferable.  The verbage and accents are more mainstream.  However, when my own children were young they loved the Beatrix Potter videos and the Britishness was never an issue.  It did not seem to be for the families to whom I gifted Beatrix Potter either.  They all loved them.PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS PRODUCTION.  Used DVD's are currently over $45.
