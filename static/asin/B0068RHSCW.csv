1513581,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B0068RHSCW,Adrien Caldwell,"[2, 4]","I have been eyeing this movie on and off at the DVD rental machines at my grocery store for several months. Not sure why I was hesitant but I find that movies nowadays are not all that intriguing. They leave me flat and all I can say to myself is that at least it only cost me $1.30 to rent for a day. Well, tonight I finally rented it and I'm very glad I did. After having viewed this movie I was so grateful to have had such a unique experience. This movie was like a puzzle that kept me guessing throughout. I don't want to give away too many details because by doing so I think it will deflate the unraveling experience of a very clever story line.As a few other reviewers have suggested, I recommend not watching the trailer. It only gives away one segment of the film. Be that as it may, I think this one crucial aspect of the film is better left as a surprise during the viewing of the movie. I was fortunate enough not to see the trailer beforehand. After signing online to leave my review here on amazon.com and watching the trailer here I am in agreement and would advise against viewing it.Fans of Daniel, Naomi and Rachel should not be disappointed. They all do a great job and deliver dependably good performances. I am a pretty big fan of Naomi Watts myself. During the first half or nearly two thirds I wondered why she was in the movie in the first place because her onscreen presence was minimal. But as the story unfolds toward the end her character becomes much more prominent.This is not a scary movie nor is it a thriller. It's more of a complex mystery that involves how our minds can play the worst of tricks on us due to horrible trauma. Sometimes this happens as a way to avoid, cope and/or survive the horrific pain of events that can completely tear our lives apart. There are also strong overtones of being compelled to face one's truth, love for one's family and finally letting go in order to move on. I'd like to go into more detail but I really believe that this is the type of movie to be enjoyed while knowing as few details as possible.",5,What a great movie!,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,2071,"['have', 'been', 'eyeing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'rental', 'machines', 'grocery', 'store', 'several', 'months', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'hesitant', 'find', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'are', 'not', 'intriguing', 'leave', 'flat', 'can', 'say', 'least', 'only', 'cost', '1.30', 'rent', 'day', 'Well', 'tonight', 'finally', 'rented', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'having', 'viewed', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'grateful', 'have', 'had', 'unique', 'experience', 'movie', 'was', 'puzzle', 'kept', 'guessing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'doing', 'so', 'think', 'will', 'deflate', 'unraveling', 'experience', 'very', 'clever', 'story', 'few', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'recommend', 'not', 'watching', 'trailer', 'only', 'away', 'one', 'segment', 'film', 'Be', 'may', 'think', 'one', 'crucial', 'aspect', 'film', 'better', 'left', 'surprise', 'viewing', 'movie', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'trailer', 'beforehand', 'signing', 'online', 'leave', 'review', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'watching', 'trailer', 'here', 'am', 'agreement', 'would', 'advise', 'viewing', 'it.Fans', 'Daniel', 'Naomi', 'Rachel', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'deliver', 'dependably', 'good', 'performances', 'am', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'first', 'half', 'nearly', 'two', 'thirds', 'wondered', 'why', 'was', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'onscreen', 'presence', 'was', 'minimal', 'story', 'end', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'prominent.This', 'not', 'scary', 'movie', 'thriller', 'more', 'complex', 'mystery', 'how', 'minds', 'can', 'play', 'worst', 'tricks', 'due', 'horrible', 'trauma', 'Sometimes', 'way', 'avoid', 'cope', 'and/or', 'survive', 'horrific', 'pain', 'events', 'can', 'completely', 'tear', 'lives', 'apart', 'are', 'also', 'strong', 'overtones', 'being', 'compelled', 'face', 'one', 'truth', 'love', 'one', 'family', 'finally', 'letting', 'go', 'order', 'move', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'really', 'believe', 'type', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'knowing', 'few', 'details', 'possible']",Dream House
1513582,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0068RHSCW,A kids review,"[6, 12]","SPOILER ALERTDON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERSJim Sheridan's made some great movies, and he's made a couple of stinkers. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of an all-star cast that includes Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts, Dream House falls pretty squarely in the latter category. Craig stars as Peter Ward, a recently released mental patient and survivor of a brutal attack that left his wife and two daughters dead. Unfortunately, Peter is not altogether well, and he moves back into his decrepit home, believing in his mind that it is still the lovely home he left, and that his family is still alive and well... but with different names. As Peter's past and his fabricated fantasy come to a head, the truth is slowly revealed. Unfortunately, I saw the twists and turns coming a mile away, and in light of that, the film simply moved along at a snail's pace, too stuffy to be gripping, and too obvious to be scary. As it stands, it's the worst film I've seeb for Sheridan, Weisz, and Watts, and the second lowest for Craig.",1,Dream House,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1042,"['SPOILER', 'ALERTDO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WANT', 'SPOILERSJim', 'Sheridan', 'made', 'great', 'movies', 'made', 'couple', 'stinkers', 'Unfortunately', 'efforts', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Dream', 'House', 'pretty', 'squarely', 'latter', 'category', 'Craig', 'Peter', 'Ward', 'recently', 'released', 'mental', 'patient', 'survivor', 'brutal', 'attack', 'left', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'dead', 'Unfortunately', 'Peter', 'not', 'altogether', 'well', 'back', 'decrepit', 'home', 'believing', 'mind', 'still', 'lovely', 'home', 'left', 'family', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'different', 'names', 'Peter', 'past', 'fabricated', 'fantasy', 'come', 'head', 'truth', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'Unfortunately', 'saw', 'twists', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'light', 'film', 'simply', 'moved', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'too', 'stuffy', 'be', 'gripping', 'too', 'obvious', 'be', 'scary', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seeb', 'Sheridan', 'Weisz', 'Watts', 'second', 'lowest', 'Craig']",Dream House

1513587,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0068RHSCW,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Dream House is a bit of an oddball film.  The storyline develops at a pretty exciting and appropriate pace (well, starting around the halfway point) and you're constantly wondering what's going on.I gotta admit something rather humorous however.  For the first half of the movie with all the people constantly entering the house as well as the children finding hidden back rooms by pushing on walls in the bedroom closet, I was thinking ""This house has an unlimited number of secret entrance passages!""  You'll see what I mean by this comment when you watch it.  It's hilarious that the family had no idea that the teens around town were literally partying in a hidden section of their basement.  It's not funny NOW of course- not with the knowledge that... well, I won't spoil.  The knowledge that you have to see the movie the entire way through to know where I'm going with this!  This movie was made with the intention of the second half being critically important.Dream House definitely succeeds with flying colors right when it reaches the halfway point (45 minutes in).  I mean I certainly did NOT see the major twist coming.  Even though I remember a similar scene from another film, I can't remember if it was even executed in that movie as well as this one.  Once we reach the point of having an idea what might be going on in this supposed murder house (and it's just that- an idea and NOT an understanding of the entire situation at hand) our interest in how these events play out perk much higher (at least mine did).  A slow-moving and somewhat boring storyline has now suddenly become dramatically compelling.The question then becomes, who *really* murdered a mother and two children?  Was it a complete stranger or are all the suspicions that the father did it true?  I *was* wondering why the father was walking around free and that the small town cops weren't really expressing anger whenever they approached him- more like mild disappointment and a desire to keep away from him.Naomi Watts needs to stop being so dog on *hot!*  Seriously, what a cute face.  A face you want to cuddle up to in fact.Overall, about what I expected.

1513599,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0068RHSCW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Did you ever see a movie that had an absolutely perfect cast and an intriguing idea, only to fall flat on its face?""Dream House"" is one such movie. It has the brilliant trio of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts, and the core concept is a truly fascinating one... but it's also riddled with massive plot holes and contrivances, and capped off by an absurd climax. It feels like a movie that started off as a taut Hitchcockian thriller, but got malformed by studio interference.As the movie begins, Will Atenton (Craig) quits his high-powered New York job. He and his beloved wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) have just moved into a beautiful new house with their two daughters, and Will plans to write a novel. But weird things begin happening around the house. A strange man is watching the house. A potted plant is left by the door. Libby and the children discover things left by the previous family.When a bunch of teens break into the basement, Will learns that a man named Peter Ward murdered his wife and children there five years ago, but lack of evidence kept him from being jailed. Will believes that Peter Ward is stalking his family, and begins investigating the bizarre still-open murder case. But then he makes a shocking discovery about Peter Ward's true identity, which throws everything he knows and loves into doubt -- and forces him to seek out the true murderer.It's difficult to summarize ""Dream House"" without giving away the BIG MAJOR TWIST, especially since it takes place right in the movie's middle. However, it is a fascinating twist, and it transforms what seems to be a simple thriller into a tragic Hitchcockian psychodrama. The entire movie is bittersweet, since even if justice is served, there cannot be a true happy ending.Unfortunately, it also has more holes than a broken sieve. The entire plot revolves around the most pathetically inept hit-man in the history of film, who manages to kill just about every person EXCEPT his mark. And there are so many contrivances that parts of the movie will give you a headache. Why would the murderer wait five years to kill again? Why wasn't the house sold? Why does Will not have any family or friends in the area?Even Jim Sheridan's direction feels lazy. A quick example: one scene has Craig returning home after discovering that this life has become a nightmare and everything he loves is gone. He huddles on the floor, and starts to scream. It's a beautiful, powerful scene... which is ruined by the stationary camera set up ACROSS THE ROOM, aimed at the back of Craig's head. It's like they set up the camera, and the director said, ""Okay, time for lunch. Uh, Daniel, just keep acting and stuff, okay? I'll piece it together when I get back.""It feels like a good movie was twisted out of shape after it had begun. Honestly, the movie makes a lot more sense if you simply interpret most of the narrative as being part of Atenton's novel, since the weirdness only starts once he begins writing. Frankly, it makes a little more sense.But the actors aren't responsible for any of the problems, because they're all really good. Craig gives a truly mesmerizing performance as a happy, contented man whose life spirals into a madness and self-doubt, and he has such magnificent chemistry with Weisz that it's easy to see why they married shortly after. Watts has a solid smaller role as a jittery neighbor, and even Marton Csokas does what he can with an otherwise flat character.""Dream House"" has a brilliant concept and cast, but the plot is so riddled with holes that it collapses on itself like... well, like a condemned house.

1513600,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0068RHSCW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","DREAM HOUSE (2011, 92 minutes) is one of the most stunning and wonderful suspense-thrillers I have ever seen in my life. If only Hitchcock had lived long enough, I think he'd have made this film. Watch out: there is a record number, fifteen, films with this exact same title dating back to the 1930s. From what I can tell, this film is the 16th to be so titled.Will Atenten (a different-looking Daniel Craig) seems to have retired from his job as publishing editor in Chicago in order to retire to a suburb with his wife and two daughters. When they begin to suffer from a stalker and simultaneously discover the house's former occupants were murdered there, Will becomes fiercely determined to protect his family and find the truth.This sparkling PG-rated gem from last year, which was evidently ignored by the entire world, cannot be missed. It is a perfect showcase for Craig, while at the same time having the distinction of being one of the most brilliantly simple, spine-tingling suspense thrillers of all time. I will spoil none of this, but you cannot fail to get this film no matter what. If you've seen it, you know ... and if not, this is something you must definitely get to know.This seems to have been something of a sleeper - and I have to ask yet again, what is it with these first movies of the 21st century? it seems every other film that is released simply vanishes into thin air and no one recalls seeing any of them. Luckier than most, I have caught lots of them. DREAM HOUSE makes me want to catch them all. This goes down in the ""Excellent Sleeper"" book along with the interesting sleeperMain Street(see my review) of the same year.With the additional talents of Rachel Weisz, Elias Koteas, Marton Czokas (a/k/a Martin Csokas), Naomi Watts, Brian Murray and the stunning Rachel Fox who is just at the start of her career.",5,Is there any difference between a hallucination and a ghost?

The keep that cleverly vague and inconclusive. Which I liked.I actually love these sorts of movies where it's not quite clear who the villain is or even what exactly is going on. There is a huge twist part way through the movie. One that I sort of guessed. But even knowing it didn't spoil the enjoyment of it playing out. And even then it still wasn't completely clear who was good and who was bad.The photography really emphasized odd angles and shots through windows or from behind branches. That definitely added to the creep factor which was perfect for this sort of thing.I don't have a lot to say about the acting. It's a great cast, but really it's all about Daniel Craig and he is great throughout. Showing the entire range of moods of his character. Happy father, angry husband, scared, grieving.

Entering into the realm of this film written by David Loucka and directed by Jim Sheridan (In America, The Boxer, In the Name of the Father, The Field, My Left Foot, etc.) is more of a challenge than the viewer is ready to understand. The apparent story is so tightly written that all of the elements of the real story are placed before our eyes, but as in so many life instances, what we think we see and understand is a mirage: the story being told is occult until the film is over.  Similar films that use this technique include The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, and The Others.  Sharpen your observational skills and this film will be extremely satisfying.Opening with a New York City farewell party for writer Will Atenton  (Daniel Craig) who is leaving his high paying job to spend more time with his family, we soon find Will in front of his dream house in the New England where is beautiful and passionate wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his two young daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) are in the process of fixing up an old deserted house.  Some strange things happen - as in all good ghost thrillers -  and soon enough Will learns that the house has been vacant for five years because of some heinous murders.  A neighbor across the street - Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), seemingly estranged from her husband Jack (Marton Csokas) who is attempting to gain sole guardianship of their daughter Chloe (Rachel Fox) - visits and shares with Will some of the grisly details.  At this point the story begins to unwrap the real situation of Will's identity and the real history of the house of memories.  To share more story would be unfair to the impact of the illusion of this film.Daniel Craig is superb as Will, and Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts are excellent, as are the supporting actors which in addition to Koteas and Csokas include Jane Alexander in a pivotal cameo role.

But of course its not as their new house was once where a few murders took place of a mother and her children. So naturally their spirits haunt the house and Will sees them.Troubled by this Will decides to look into the murders and see if these ghosts are real or if they somehow tie into his troubled past (would it be a thriller if he didn't have one?). Also in the cast is Naomi Watts as Ann, the neighbor who seems to have clues to help Will with his search.The film is fairly or rather very short, under 90 minutes before the credits roll. At first its decently paced, there's some good build-up and the way its presented it does make you question whether its imaginary or very real on Will's part.

I watched the movie when the DVD came out last week and it seems a hard movie to get a handle on, not because the plot is too involved or twists around too much but because the movie doesn't really leave a lasting impression when its over.Daniel Craig plays Will Atenton an editor who is quitting his day job to write the great American novel. He moves in with his wife Libby, Rachel Weisz and two girls into their dream house, a picturesque house that looks like its right out of a Hallmark Christmas card. Then Will starts hearing disembodied voices in the walls, but discovers its only local teenagers sneaking into the basement and discovers that Hallmark house was the scene of a horrific murder, in which a father kills his wife and two girls. From there Libby starts ""knowing"" where the wife was murdered, and Naomi Watts as the neighbor Ann Patterson has a secret she won't divulge to Will.Dream House isn't a bad movie, the acting by Craig, Weisz, and Watts is uniformly good, and even the story is good, but uniform describes everything well, it's a well crafted movie but there's nothing spectacular or anything that makes the movie stand out in any way. The twist in the plot is given away about half way through the movie and I was expecting another twist that never came.

It was well done and thoroughly enjoyable.  Daniel Craig did a very nice performance as the lead character in this movie--a good, solid job.  Of course, this is NOT a movie for your children to see.  The premise is about the murder of a wife and 2 young children, with the husband surviving.  But, let's back up a wee bit.The movie opens with Will Atenten (ah-ten-ten  Daniel Craig) in his editor office, signing off on his severance package.  He has decided to spend more time at home with his family and write a book.  It is snowing outside.  He takes the metro train home and breaks the news to wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and plays with his little girls Trish and Dee Dee.  I got the impression that the family had moved into the house recently.  Trish found flowers on the porch this morning that were not from Will (which probably should have been better tied in or deleted from the film.Soon after Will's retirement, an estranged husband and wife, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts  neighbors) begin to look at him funny, as does their daughter.  Something seems so familiar about Ann.  Ann's husband looks at Will like he hates him, while the custody battle over the teen-age Patterson girl goes on.When Dee Dee thinks she spots a man outside the window, and Will sees footprints in the snow the next morning, the plot begins to kick into a faster pace.  Will gets up in the middle of the night to see teenagers in his basement, involved in some ritual to commemorate the 5-year anniversary of the murders in this house!  Through talking to the teens and the police, and research, Will finds out that a woman and 2 young girls were shot and killed in his home 5 years ago!  The husband, Peter Ward, was also shot, but lived.  Peter Ward has recently been released from a psychiatric facility because of lack of evidence to charge him criminally.  Our story-line takes Will on a quest to find Peter Ward and some answers and reminds us that our perception is our reality.The story-line was very good and well worth seeing, but it probably could have been developed better, into something outstanding.  Still, this was a very good movie and I plan to purchase the DVD when it becomes available--filmed in Ontario, Canada.",4,More Psycho-Thriller than Horror,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,2324,"['trailer', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'psycho-thriller/mystery', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'did', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'lead', 'character', 'movie', 'good', 'solid', 'job', 'course', 'NOT', 'movie', 'children', 'see', 'premise', 'murder', 'wife', '2', 'young', 'children', 'husband', 'surviving', 'let', 'back', 'up', 'wee', 'bit.The', 'movie', 'Will', 'Atenten', 'ah-ten-ten', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'editor', 'office', 'signing', 'off', 'severance', 'package', 'decided', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'home', 'family', 'write', 'book', 'snowing', 'outside', 'metro', 'train', 'home', 'news', 'wife', 'Libby', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'little', 'girls', 'Trish', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'got', 'impression', 'family', 'had', 'moved', 'house', 'recently', 'Trish', 'found', 'flowers', 'porch', 'morning', 'were', 'not', 'Will', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'tied', 'deleted', 'film.Soon', 'Will', 'retirement', 'estranged', 'husband', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Patterson', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'neighbors', 'begin', 'look', 'funny', 'daughter', 'Something', 'so', 'familiar', 'Ann', 'Ann', 'husband', 'Will', 'custody', 'battle', 'teen-age', 'Patterson', 'girl', 'on.When', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'spots', 'man', 'window', 'Will', 'footprints', 'snow', 'next', 'morning', 'plot', 'kick', 'faster', 'pace', 'Will', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'see', 'teenagers', 'basement', 'involved', 'ritual', 'commemorate', '5-year', 'anniversary', 'murders', 'house', 'talking', 'teens', 'police', 'research', 'Will', 'out', 'woman', '2', 'young', 'girls', 'were', 'shot', 'killed', 'home', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Ward', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'lived', 'Peter', 'Ward', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'lack', 'evidence', 'charge', 'criminally', 'story-line', 'Will', 'quest', 'find', 'Peter', 'Ward', 'answers', 'perception', 'reality.The', 'story-line', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'better', 'something', 'outstanding', 'Still', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'plan', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'when', 'available', 'filmed', 'Ontario', 'Canada']",Dream House

Whether it's horror or a suspense/psychological thriller, it needs to have a feeling that it transmits to the viewer with every shot, and Dream House just doesn't. (think Christian Bale's commitment to his role in The Machinist and you'll know what I mean)  It is shot like a commercial.  I don't mean a lot of jumpy cuts, but a smooth glossy detached finished feeling that is utterly wrong for the subject matter. The same could be said for the casting of Daniel Craig (and his too still Bond-like physique) in the central role.  He does fine with it, but he does not inhabit the character.  The audience doesn't inhabit the house, and one has to suspect the director is at fault for that.

1513660,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B0068RHSCW,O Shepard,"[2, 4]","Dream HouseA decent thriller with a superb cast, 'Dream House' will interest the viewer until the final 15 minutes. The big problem is that the production rushes the ending and the observant viewer will feel that something is missing; a transition sequence that brings the viewer and the main character into the action of the final scenes. I felt that there must have been more scenes written for Jane Alexander's character that would have offered the bridge scenes necessary to allow the audience to absorb the direction that the plot was heading. To understand what I am getting at, watch a similar film directed by one of our greatest directors; Martin Scorsese, titled 'Shutter Island'. I do not want to reveal the plot of 'Dream House', but if you watch 'Shutter Island, particularly, the last 15 minutes, you will understand what I mean.In any case. perhaps I have watched too many movies or perhaps my subconscious remembered the preview trailer, because I got the gist of the plot after watching the first 5 minutes. There was something off about the opening sequences that I noticed immediately and this was confirmed after watching the first scenes with the family and I began to compare it to an older film that starred Nicole Kidman. You probably know the one I mean.Still, 'Dream House' is a good film that deserved a better critical reception than it got during it's original release. It is a minor effort by a very good director, Jim Sheridan. I do not know why he choose the direction that the plot unfolds before us. It is lame and easily guessed from the beginning. It would have been a much better film if the audience was in on the main plot points from the start of the film (I understand that the preview trailer revealed it anyway) and that the viewer  knew the basic plot line that the main character was so clueless about. It would have made a better film if the audience became engrossed in Daniel Craig's character discovery about the truth about his past and his delusions. And it would have eliminated the need to have other secondary characters speak dialogue and take actions that make absolutely no sense.

Schumacher,"[0, 0]","This is a well-made movie that has interesting, even touching, characters and lots of plot twists.Will Atenton quits his high-profile publishing job (with GPH publishing) to live in remote surburbs with his wife and two young daughters, 5 and 8.  His wife refurbishes the delipidated house while he writes.But strange, shocking things begin to happen.  The girls see a man spying in windows and roaming the grounds.  A posse of goth teenagers takes up residence in the basement and enacts death rituals--because, they tell Atenton, everybody who lived in the house was murdered.  The police refuse to disclose details, and refuse to help when the prowler shows up again.Is it a ghost?  Is it a kidnapper?  Is it a serial killer?Attenton fially finds out--to his shock--when he goes to GPH mental hospital to ask about the previous occupant.Daniel Craig is superb as Attenton: open, empathetic, kindly, distraught, downcast.  Rachel Weisz is also great as his wife--ironically, the down-to-earth practical one, who always has sensible explanations for the horrors.  The kids are charming and believable.  Naomi Watts is terrific in an almost silent role as the neighbor going through a ferocious divorce.  Even the bit players are wonderful.  Rachel Fox, Naomi Watts's teen daughter, practically steals the show in a tiny part.  Michael Czokas and Elias Koteas are wonderful as the bitter husband and his (apparently dyslexic) employee.The setting is also superb.  The subtle symbolism of the melting snow parallels Atenton's melting confusion and coming-to-new-life.Even the makeup is good.

This was to see if it was one for me to even view, as I am not usually one to enjoy this genre in general. I am so glad that I did as they are all valid for their given reasons.  First off, I'll pass on the best piece of information I acquired; Please do not look at the trailer for this.  It appears evident to me that this is marketed as an altogether horror picture with a PG-13 rating (I didn't view it thusly)  I just don't see it this way nor is it when you view it in its entirety. I found it smartly intriguing, especially after viewing it a couple of times.This movie appears to me as more a relationship story, suspenseful, a psychological thriller, and yes, horrific in parts.  There are quite a few added-in classic horror tidbits, nothing off-putting for someone like myself who doesn't care for them necessarily.  It does carry along an undercurrent of the supernatural and you do start to question what is real and what is not.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and owe a lot to the reviewers for their time in writing.  If I wouldn't have read up on this film from their points of view (all of their points at the release time), I would have never watched this.  It is marketed wrongly so it could go totally unnoticed while it is a valid piece of entertainment.  A chilling account that I was enthralled with.Starting off with novel writer Will (Daniel Craig) leaving work and then returning home to his close-knit family.  Will's adoring wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) greets him along with their two daughters. The house is continually in a state of reparation always by Libby and is something for you to be watching at all times.During one night Will discovers, unbeknownst to him, that teenagers have broken into his basement so he chases them off of his property, bewildered of their motives.  Things are getting more and more confusing, they are very dangerous for his once comfortable family.  It is around this time that he meets his neighbor across the street, Ann (Naomi Watts). He seems to feel as if he may just know her more than what's apparently seen.  There is also an interesting little cameo by Jane Alexander, that first comes into view at the genesis of the story.I wouldn't want you to read anymore then the character set-up If you already haven't had this movie tainted with spoilers or watching the trailer (Again, please abstain if possible).  One must really view this for themselves. I immediately watched it again and found that I had missed so many *tip offs right in front of me to my surprise.  I will have to see this another time soon because I am still curious to find all of what I've overlooked.""Dream House"" does boast an interesting and haunted cast that is not shy on attraction in the two leads.  Craig and Weisz have a distinct and completely believable chemistry which is now quite understandable. Along with the great acting, add Naomi Watts to this duo for one more.

He has plans to publish a book and spend more time with his family, and seems happy - at first. Then odd things begin to happen and looking into the footprints outside and the noises in his home unravels so much more.Acting in this movie was kind of hit and miss, and it was mostly because the characters were not allowed a lot of depth. The family itself, dynamic wise, did work for me at first. If it had been a different kind of movie, I could have seen them actually evoking some emotion. The problem is, when mixed into what is happening in this movie, you hit a wall. After those four main characters, you run into other people that are thrown in for plot effect, but that are not very convincing. I personally found some of the turns, when trying to tell the story, to be murder when it came to making anything tangible out of the other characters.The plot, while it could be interesting, has been done. I'm not going to put spoiler in, i HATE those, but I will say the first guesses on what is happening will be right here. That is kind of upsetting when you have only gone 10 minutes into a film. There are two central plot ideas here, and the good thing about one is that it is revealed after about 30 minutes. The issue with that is a second idea comes up, dealing with neighbors, and it is equally easy to figure out.Another thing you run into is the fact that this movie does not know what it wants to be. It certainly isn't horror and settles in as more suspense, but then turns and tries to be a supernatural thriller after a few. all that indecision really doesn't help at all.I was not sure what to expect, but this wasn't what I wanted.

Actor Daniel Craig summarized the film well by stating that things turned out great because he met his wife (Weisz)but the film, well, not so much.SPOILERS:""Dream House"" has a promising premise and an interesting plot twist that just doesn't come off. Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) gives up his position as an editor for a publishing firm to finally write his novel and stay at home with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz)and their two kids in their idyllic home. Their home is idyllic until they discover that a family was murdered there and they begin seeing figures outside their home. As Will investigates what occured he finds that the killer was never convicted and still lives in their community. Will begins to find out more and more disturbing facts about the killing as he tries to piece together what exactly happened and who is threatening his family.SPOILERS:""Dream House"" suffers from a lethargic first half and the second part of the film suffers from chopy editing clearly indicating that the film went through signficiant re-editing. The troubled history of ""Dream House"" included reshooting, director Sheridan being excluded from the editing of the film and, ultimately, trying to have his name removed from the movie (as well as the fact that Craig nor Weisz wanted to do publicity for the film they were so disappointed with the result) are sad given the talent involved. There's the hint of a good movie buried in this mess and the differing tones of the film.The nice production design, photography and performances are in service of an overcooked turkey.BLU-RAY IMAGE QUALITY: ""Dream House"" arrives with a handsome looking transfer and blacks are pretty consistent and solid throughout with nice detail which is an important point since some important scenes DO occur in the dark. Colors are robust and flesh tones accurate although the film is a bit on the cool side (a stylistic choice I would assume) for the ""reality"".SPECIAL FEATURES: We get four featurettes which are, frankly, aren't long enough to give us a sense of the efforts that went into the film.First up is ""Burning Down The House"" and runs under five minutes focusing on the conclusion of the film and next we get the complimentary ""Building The Dream House"" focusing on the production design which is interesting but, again, too brief. ""Dream Cast"" focuses on casting while ""A Look Inside"" is little more than a promotional short running around 2 minutes. We get the spoiler filled trailer. When watching this I couldn't help but wonder why Morgan Creek AND Universal approved this trailer which is compressses the film down to a couple of minutes and gives us the major plot points of the movie. Seriously, what idiot approved THIS trailer and what editor in their right mind would assemble it THIS way? The good news is that if you don't want to watch the movie you can watch the trailer and get the basic plot of the film.""Dream House"" turned into a nightmare for director and for viewers it's a jumbled mess clearly messed with in post-production.

1513689,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0068RHSCW,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","I am truly surprised that the people behind the production of Dream House went along with the trailer for the movie - it spoils the movie for the viewer! I watched the trailer months ago when the movie was first released in theaters, and was shocked at how blatantly the storyline was exposed, leaving the viewer with no sense of anticipation as to what may be the mystery of Dream House. I was so disappointed (I am a fan of both Weisz and Craig) that I opted not to watch the movie in the theater and waited for it to be available as a DVD rental.Since I had already watched the trailer, I sort of knew what to expect and was proven right. There are no big surprises or plot twists for those who were unfortunate enough to have viewed the movie trailer. For those who haven't watched the trailer, the movie will hold some surprises, but not anything new in the haunted house and psychological thriller genre. The plot is predictable, and it is only the performances of the lead actors that keep the entire production from falling apart. Unfortunately, even the combined star power of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts fail to keep this from turning into an awful mess of a movie.The story centers on a man named Will Attenton (Daniel Craig) who at the beginning of the movie is shown giving up his successful editorial job so that he can spend more time working on his novel and having quality time with his family - wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two young daughters. Things start to go wrong when Will begins to think someone may be watching his family, and then makes the discovery that his house was the scene of violent crimes involving the murders of an entire family. He also wonders if there is a connection between what happened in the past, what he is experiencing in the present, and the role of the attractive neighbor across the street (Naomi Watts).The story starts off on a relatively strong note - the atmosphere (beautiful snow, an idyllic suburban street), the sense of suspense being gradually built up, but then it all sort of falls apart into a mess. The movie suffers from gaping holes in the plot, lack of credibility, and the sense of having watched similar plots before. There is a strong sense of the supernatural here but it can't make up for the underwhelming plot and lackluster writing.",3,Do not watch the trailer,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,2327,"['am', 'truly', 'surprised', 'people', 'production', 'Dream', 'House', 'went', 'trailer', 'movie', 'movie', 'viewer', 'watched', 'trailer', 'months', 'ago', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'blatantly', 'storyline', 'was', 'exposed', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'mystery', 'Dream', 'House', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'am', 'fan', 'Weisz', 'Craig', 'opted', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'theater', 'waited', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'rental.Since', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'trailer', 'sort', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'proven', 'right', 'are', 'big', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'who', 'were', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'trailer', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'trailer', 'movie', 'will', 'hold', 'surprises', 'not', 'anything', 'new', 'haunted', 'house', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'genre', 'plot', 'predictable', 'only', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'keep', 'entire', 'production', 'falling', 'apart', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'combined', 'star', 'power', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'fail', 'keep', 'turning', 'awful', 'mess', 'movie.The', 'story', 'centers', 'man', 'named', 'Will', 'Attenton', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'beginning', 'movie', 'shown', 'giving', 'up', 'successful', 'editorial', 'job', 'so', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'working', 'novel', 'having', 'quality', 'time', 'family', 'wife', 'Libby', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'Will', 'think', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'family', 'then', 'discovery', 'house', 'was', 'scene', 'violent', 'crimes', 'involving', 'murders', 'entire', 'family', 'also', 'connection', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'what', 'experiencing', 'present', 'role', 'attractive', 'neighbor', 'street', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '.The', 'story', 'off', 'relatively', 'strong', 'note', 'atmosphere', 'beautiful', 'snow', 'idyllic', 'suburban', 'street', 'sense', 'suspense', 'being', 'gradually', 'built', 'up', 'then', 'sort', 'falls', 'apart', 'mess', 'movie', 'suffers', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'lack', 'credibility', 'sense', 'having', 'watched', 'similar', 'plots', 'strong', 'sense', 'supernatural', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'underwhelming', 'plot', 'lackluster', 'writing']",Dream House
