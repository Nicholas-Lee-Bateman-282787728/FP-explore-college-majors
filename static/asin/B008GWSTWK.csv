I personally think the live approach used on some of the ""Titanic"" treatments are the best. Perhaps a live audience drives them to perform a bit better. This isn't the best of the lot but I did enjoy the program. I actually found the availability on Amazon to be nice and provided free shipping. Can't wait for their next creation.",5,Cinematic Titanic Rattlers,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,411,"['have', 'been', 'MST3000', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'RiffTraxx', 'series', 'personally', 'think', 'live', 'approach', 'used', 'Titanic', 'treatments', 'are', 'best', 'Perhaps', 'live', 'audience', 'perform', 'bit', 'better', ""n't"", 'best', 'lot', 'did', 'enjoy', 'program', 'actually', 'found', 'availability', 'Amazon', 'be', 'nice', 'provided', 'free', 'shipping', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'creation']",Cinematic Titanic LIVE: Rattlers

Glad someone decided to film the riffing in front of a audience.  My Girlfriend was in tears she was laughing so hard.  Rattlers has some odd choices but that is why it was able to make the cut for being riffed on.,5,These two dead boys are my ticket outta here!,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,286,"['was', 'absolute', 'treat', 'Love', 'live', 'DVDs', 'earlier', 'ones', 'Glad', 'someone', 'decided', 'film', 'riffing', 'front', 'audience', 'Girlfriend', 'was', 'tears', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Rattlers', 'odd', 'choices', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'cut', 'being', 'riffed']",Cinematic Titanic LIVE: Rattlers

1552958,A2PA9ACXDNHFID,B008GWSTWK,Scott M,"[6, 11]","I have all of the Cinematic Titanic Shows on DVD - to Date. I love most of them - my favorite is 'War of The Insects'. I met the case last winter and admire them and their talents. I know humor can be subjective - this one just didn't 'click' for me. The youtube trailer - covers most of what I found funny in this movie. I kind of prefer the 'studio' movies as opposed to the 'Live' ones - but note - my favorite happens to be a 'Live' DVD. I'm not slamming Cinematic - this is just Not a Movie I would reccomend to others. I'll still buy whatever the next release is.P.S. there is some implied nudity in this movie.Sincerely, Scott M.",2,I love Cinematic Titanic - Just Not This One.,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,636,"['have', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'Shows', 'DVD', 'Date', 'love', 'most', 'favorite', ""'War"", 'Insects', 'met', 'case', 'last', 'winter', 'admire', 'talents', 'know', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'subjective', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", ""'click"", 'youtube', 'trailer', 'most', 'what', 'found', 'funny', 'movie', 'kind', 'prefer', ""'studio"", 'movies', 'opposed', ""'Live"", 'ones', 'note', 'favorite', 'happens', 'be', ""'Live"", 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'slamming', 'Cinematic', 'just', 'Not', 'Movie', 'would', 'reccomend', 'others', ""'ll"", 'still', 'buy', 'next', 'release', 'is.P.S', 'implied', 'nudity', 'movie.Sincerely', 'Scott', 'M']",Cinematic Titanic LIVE: Rattlers
