Afterall, it didn't gain alot of momentum at the box office and who knows-- maybe you haven't even heard of this movie until recently. I'm telling you right now, point blank and honest to god, this movie is fantastic. To be honest, I had my reservations, but I bought this movie not knowing what to expect and am very happy with it.It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Jimmy, a boy who is confined to a bubble because he was born without any immunitites. He lives day to day stuck in his room eating his moms germ-free, fat-free cookies, and while you'd think he'd be bored out of his mind, he comes up with ways to stay entertained, like played the theme from &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; on his guitar. Then Chloe moves next door, and from then on he's hooked. When she tells him one day that she's getting married and then leaves for Niagra Falls, Jimmy gathers up his courage and leaves the confines of his bubble room in his new bubble suit.He meets alot of interesting characters along the way, like the Bright and Shiny Cult, a maniac on a motorcylce, and a group of circus freaks. It seems like it would be too much going on, but it's really not, it keeps the movie flowing and provides alot of laugh factors.This movie may be a bit &quot;out there,&quot; but not so far away that alot of different people who like alot of different movies won't be able to enjoy it. I think everyone would like this movie if they gave it a shot and watched it. And if not, that person isn't much of a movie person afterall if he can't find something to like about this charming movie.I recommend this to everyone.

The only problem with BUBBLE BOY is despite some gross out humor, its not very funny.Jimmy (played by DONNIE DARKO's Jake Gyllenhaal) has a rare medical condition in which the slightest exposure to germs can kill him, so he has lived his entire life in a plastic bubble, with his overprotective mother (Swoosie Kurtz) monitoring his every move. The other neighbourhood kids think he is a freak, but this arouses the curiosities Jimmy's neighbour Chloe (Marley Shelton) and she decides to try and get to know him better. Jimmy is thrilled with this attention and pretty soon he is smitten with her. But  one day Chloe drops the bombshell that she is going to get married to a hypocritical scumbag and Jimmy must somehow get to Niagra Falls in several days to stop the wedding. How does he do this? By building a mobile bubble suit and setting off on a cross county road trip on his scooter. (Here the viewer suspends his disbelief).BUBBLE BOY is a movie loaded with unfunny stereotypes. Fabio has a cameo as the leader of an idiotic cult in which all the members are named Todd. These whackos believe Jimmy is their key to heaven. Verne Troyer (better known as Mini-Me) plays Dr Phreak, the evil head honcho of a travelling freak show. There's also a memorable gag involving the gory destruction of a cow's carcass.

683753,ANCNEU3MD7RR,B00005U8QN,FizzWiz,"[0, 0]","The concept of an innocent boy in a bubble for his entire life to be free of germs is ingenious.  The Travolta version is not the same and not symbolic in the way that this one is.  Gyllenhaal had a fun role, and his ""daringness"" and luckiness to be able to accept roles like this early on have helped boost his name and career to his current well respected place in the biz.The bubble itself was hard to make as it had to be customized by special companies who make masks and such, and they had never even encountered such a request before.  The bubble was changed about 4-5 times at least throughout the movie.  The bubble started off as about 65 pounds and was lowered to around 30 pounds after all the modifications.  Gyllenhaal started acting with the 65 pounds on his back initially.  He, as the Bubble Boy, Jimmy, wore a back pack which would help stimulate the size of the bubble.  The bubble was deflated a bit to help him squeeze through small space.Gyllenhaal is the star of the movie in acting and because he is the main character.  His pure innocence, expressions, tone of voice like a child, and movement in the bubble is natural and on cue.Jimmy's mom plays a seemingly flawless overly uptight Catholic mother, and Jimmy's dad is good as an overly laid back father.  Their values mesh well to make their bubble boy's personality.The humor is witty, but not over-the-top.  Some implicit and more explicit sexual references around the bubble play a huge role.  The idea of freaks versus normal people, and roundness symbolizing good and square shaped items representing not so good things play roles throughout the movie such as a round bubble and round room.  I cannot think of comparisons, but this was listed as a main theme in one of the extras.The timing of how Jimmy gets to Niagara Falls from Las Vegas does not seem to match up.  With all the obstructions Jimmy encounters, there is probably no way he'd make it in 3 days, but he does end up flying later on, so that would cut on time a lot.

I was kind of surprised by this, as I remembered how ridulously bad Bubble Boy looked.  But my curiosity got the better of me so I finally broke down and watched it.  I was expecting very little of the movie.  I was expecting it to confirm my suspicions that the movie would be horribly unfunny.  But to my surprise, I loved it!Bubble Boy is entertaining throughout and downright hilarious in several spots.  I'd best describe it as a mix between Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Dude Where's My Car.  The events that happen are completely outrageous but thoroughly funny.  Some of the things are pure genius.  The ending is extremely predictable but that doesn't take anything away from it as whole.  There are just so many good parts its hard to pick a favorite.  I just watched this last night and I'm already eager to view it again.This movie is a perfect example of the old saying that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or put too much faith in critic's reviews.

It seemed a tad bit silly to me.  That is, until a friend of mine brought the movie by.  Absolutely hysterical!!Jimmy (Jake Gyllenhaal) Livingston was born without an immune system.  He spends his life in a sterile environment - a plastic bubble.  His mother, played by Swoosie Kurtz, takes it upon herself to teach him everything, from grade school to the facts of life.  She is obsessed with keeping Jimmy in a sterile and sin-free environment.  She succeeds until Chloe, played by Marley Shelton, moves next door.  When Chloe looks at Jimmy, she doesn't see him as a freak, but as a wonderful, interesting boy that she would love to know better.  After years of friendship that can go no further past the bubble, Chloe starts dating.  Jimmy's perfect world shatters when Chloe announces that she is going to Niagara Falls to get married.  Heartbroken, Jimmy decides to stop Chloe from making the biggest mistake of her life.  He builds a portable plastic bubble and sets off for Niagara Falls.  What follows is an incredible adventure full of laughter and mayhem.Jake Gyllenhaal is great in his portrayal of the naive bubble boy who realizes all he's been missing while trapped within the plastic bubble.  Swoosie Kurtz is absolutely hysterical as Jimmy's mother.  I couldn't stop laughing.  In fact, when I was forced to miss the ending of the movie, I ran to the local video store to rent it.

683784,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005U8QN,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 8]","Bubble Boy (Blair Hayes, 2001)It is easily predictable in the general scheme of all things Hollywood that Blair Hayes' career will be short, nasty, brutal, and fraught with frustration. After all, you can't make a movie that transcends everything about its genre and expect to get any work in Hollywood that doesn't get thrown to you with the scraps from the tables of such conventionalists as Spielberg.Bubble Boy, when it came out, had the look of a generic, utterly stupid Hollywood comedy, and I avoided it for that reason. I've seen enough David Spade and Jim Carrey movies to last me a lifetime, thank you. But after seeing Jake Gyllenhaal's Oscar-worthy performance in Donnie Darko, and connecting him with the lead role here, I had to go back, trepidations in hand, and watch this.It's brilliant.Gyllenhaal plays Jimmy Livingston, the three sttoges-esque flip side of John Travolta's Tod Lubtich (the main character of smarmy 1976 made-for-TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble). Born without normal immunities, Jimmy has been confined to a completely germ-free plastic room by his religious-nut mother (Swoosie Kurtz [Sisters], in a role I don't know how they convinced her to take) and doormat father (John Caroll Lynch of Waking the Dead and The Drew Carey Show). Jimmy has it bad for Chloe (Marley Shelton, soon to be seen in Boondock Saints: All Saints Day), but figures nothing can come of it; after all, he's in a bubble, right? She decides to marry the wrong guy, however, and Jimmy's only course of action is to hop into a portable bubble and get from Palm Springs to Niagara Falls before the wedding.Yes, it's really that dumb, and in the hands of a stock comedy director, one would expect another Dumb and Dumber or Black Sheep. But Hayes knows his films, made risky but perfect casting decisions, added in subtle sight gags and references to everything from The Graduate to A Fistful of Dollars, and above all allowed the actors to rise above the supremely silly script to turn this into a sort of Grand Guignol version of Punch and Judy. No cow is too sacred to be eaten (or run over by a Hindu-driven ice cream van), no religion too untouchable to be trampled, no comedy convention too untouchable to be subverted. Hayes makes as much fun of the movie himself as do the critics of most badly-done comedies. Consider it a pre-emptive strike, and one of sheer genius.There aren't enough good things to say, as well, about the actors in this movie. Gyllenhaal is a revelation, but then if you've seen Donnie Darko, you already know that. Swoosie Kurtz, ho has spent a goodly portion of her career playing the kinds of characters on finds in Lifetime Original Movies&trade;, completely breaks with tradition and plays a psychotic nutball with an unhealthy religious streak, and does it to the hilt. The always underrated Danny Trejo shows up, and probably says more in this movie than he has in his last ten combined. Verne Troyer (aka Mini Me) displays at least ten times the talent he did in the Austin Powers movies. Etc., etc. I could go on all day.If you avoided this one because you thought it was just another stupid comedy from Hollywood, give it another thought. It's stupid, and it's from Hollywood, but nothing about it is just another anything. ****",4,Jake Gyllenhaal can do no wrong.,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,3280,"['Bubble', 'Boy', 'Blair', 'Hayes', '2001', 'easily', 'predictable', 'general', 'scheme', 'things', 'Hollywood', 'Blair', 'Hayes', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'short', 'nasty', 'brutal', 'fraught', 'frustration', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'everything', 'genre', 'expect', 'get', 'work', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'get', 'thrown', 'scraps', 'tables', 'such', 'conventionalists', 'Spielberg.Bubble', 'Boy', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'look', 'generic', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'avoided', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'David', 'Spade', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'last', 'lifetime', 'thank', 'seeing', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'connecting', 'lead', 'role', 'here', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'trepidations', 'hand', 'watch', 'this.It', 'brilliant.Gyllenhaal', 'Jimmy', 'Livingston', 'three', 'sttoges-esque', 'flip', 'side', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Tod', 'Lubtich', 'main', 'character', 'smarmy', '1976', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Boy', 'Plastic', 'Bubble', 'Born', 'normal', 'immunities', 'Jimmy', 'been', 'confined', 'completely', 'germ-free', 'plastic', 'room', 'religious-nut', 'mother', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', '[', 'Sisters', ']', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'convinced', 'take', 'father', 'John', 'Caroll', 'Lynch', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'Jimmy', 'bad', 'Chloe', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'Saints', 'Day', 'nothing', 'can', 'come', 'bubble', 'right', 'marry', 'wrong', 'guy', 'however', 'Jimmy', 'only', 'course', 'action', 'hop', 'portable', 'bubble', 'get', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'wedding.Yes', 'really', 'dumb', 'hands', 'stock', 'comedy', 'director', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Hayes', 'films', 'made', 'risky', 'perfect', 'casting', 'decisions', 'added', 'subtle', 'sight', 'gags', 'references', 'everything', 'Graduate', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'allowed', 'actors', 'rise', 'supremely', 'silly', 'script', 'turn', 'sort', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'version', 'Punch', 'Judy', 'cow', 'too', 'sacred', 'be', 'eaten', 'run', 'over', 'Hindu-driven', 'ice', 'cream', 'van', 'religion', 'too', 'untouchable', 'be', 'trampled', 'comedy', 'convention', 'too', 'untouchable', 'be', 'subverted', 'Hayes', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'do', 'critics', 'most', 'badly-done', 'comedies', 'Consider', 'pre-emptive', 'strike', 'one', 'sheer', 'genius.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'movie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'revelation', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'already', 'know', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'ho', 'spent', 'goodly', 'portion', 'career', 'playing', 'kinds', 'characters', 'finds', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movies', 'trade', 'completely', 'tradition', 'psychotic', 'nutball', 'unhealthy', 'religious', 'streak', 'hilt', 'always', 'underrated', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'up', 'probably', 'more', 'movie', 'last', 'ten', 'combined', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'aka', 'Mini', 'Me', 'least', 'ten', 'times', 'talent', 'did', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'movies', 'Etc.', 'etc', 'could', 'go', 'day.If', 'avoided', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'give', 'thought', 'stupid', 'Hollywood', 'nothing', 'just', 'anything', '****']",N/A

The biker gang, the cult and the phreaks were all funny and very much likeable.  I cannot think of any part of this movie that should have been done differently.

Check it out, it's a definate must have addition to anyones DVD collection.  One last thing, it has a scene with an all chick band named Betty Blowtorch, the lead singer/bass player (Biannca Halstead, pretty sure that is her last name) was killed in a car accident in December of 2001.  So it was cool to see her in the quick cameo.",5,Totally surprised by this film,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,1345,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'shocked', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'while', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'hysterical', 'beginning', 'end', 'entire', 'concept', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'perfectly', 'case', 'characters', 'involved', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'did', 'begin', 'realize', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'end', 'not', 'having', 'live', 'bubble', 'anymore', 'even', 'know', 'that', 'much', 'still', 'nothing', 'spoiled', 'biker', 'gang', 'cult', 'phreaks', 'were', 'funny', 'very', 'much', 'likeable', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'part', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'cow', 'scene', 'was', 'funny', 'cult', 'running', 'motorcycles', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'plane', 'car', 'kid', 'talking', 'old', 'guys', 'woman', 'was', 'hysterical', 'Do', 'not', 'overlook', 'movie', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'great', 'type', 'movie', 'just', 'feel', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'ok', 'afterall', 'Check', 'out', 'definate', 'must', 'have', 'addition', 'anyones', 'DVD', 'collection', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'scene', 'chick', 'band', 'named', 'Betty', 'Blowtorch', 'lead', 'singer/bass', 'player', 'Biannca', 'Halstead', 'pretty', 'sure', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'December', '2001', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'quick', 'cameo']",N/A

This movie is about a boy, Jimmy, who lived his life in a bubble. He was living what he thought was a great life being cared for and taught by his mom. His mom was his best friend, till a beautiful teenager girl, Chloe, moved next door. They hung out with each other a lot in bubble boys room. They grew feeling for each other, but didn't know how to tell each other.The day Chloe told Jimmy that she was getting married she wanted Jimmy's approval. But he was hurt and pushed her away. Chloe left Jimmy a gift that said I Love You. After opening the gift and saw what she gave him, he packed up his stuff and went on an exciting journey to stop the wedding. It is funny and interesting the messes he got him self stuck in. This is a great movie for all age's. Jimmy is a funny guy. I even feel some attraction towards him because of the funny way he act's and talks on this movie. I wish I could have known a guy like him.",5,Love it,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1053,"['What', 'great', 'movie', 'use', 'watch', 'movie', 'tv', 'few', '100', 'times', 'buying', 'was', 'over', 'excited', 'buying', 'movie', 'movie', 'boy', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'bubble', 'was', 'living', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'life', 'being', 'cared', 'taught', 'mom', 'mom', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'till', 'beautiful', 'teenager', 'girl', 'Chloe', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'hung', 'out', 'other', 'lot', 'bubble', 'boys', 'room', 'grew', 'feeling', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'other.The', 'day', 'Chloe', 'told', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'getting', 'married', 'wanted', 'Jimmy', 'approval', 'was', 'hurt', 'pushed', 'away', 'Chloe', 'left', 'Jimmy', 'gift', 'said', 'Love', 'opening', 'gift', 'saw', 'what', 'gave', 'packed', 'up', 'stuff', 'went', 'exciting', 'journey', 'stop', 'wedding', 'funny', 'interesting', 'messes', 'got', 'self', 'stuck', 'great', 'movie', 'age', 'Jimmy', 'funny', 'guy', 'even', 'feel', 'attraction', 'towards', 'funny', 'way', 'act', 'talks', 'movie', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'guy']",N/A

There are way too many hilarious scenes to note here (the bus stop, the 'Curry and Ice Cream' truck, the 'fi hudred dollas!' mudwrestling scene in Vegas, the 'Bright and Shiny' People, who aren't so bright and shiny after all, not to mention Verne Troyer - aka 'Mini Me' from Austin Powers - as the freak show circus ringleader), but believe me, I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. It's not for everyone, as the director commentary says, if you don't 'get it' within the first half hour or so, you ain't gonna like it, but if you want some hilarious, irreverent laughs, this one is for you. Jake Gyllenhaal is superb, he's definitely gonna be one to watch! Anyone who can do two totally disparate movies like this and Donnie Darko, with completely different ranges, is definitely a talented individual.Watch Bubble Boy, laugh, and keep on watching!",5,GutBusting Hilarity at Every Turn...Bubble Boy is the Best!,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1857,"['vaguely', 'remember', 'seeing', 'previews', 'movie', 'thinking', ""'eh"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'Then', 'seeing', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', ""'Donnie"", 'Darko', 'finding', 'out', 'friend', 'how', 'different', 'funny', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'rent', 'it.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'least', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'up', 'safe', 'protected', 'anti-germ', 'world', 'guarded', 'bible-totin', 'mom', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Swoosie', 'Curtz', 'role', 'here', 'completely', 'great', 'actress', 'Billie', 'Burke', '30', 'screwball', 'comedy', ""'Dinner"", 'Eight', 'uptightness', 'highpitched', 'voice', 'mild-mannered', 'dad', 'kinda', 'dad', ""'Malcolm"", 'Middle', '.When', 'little', 'Jimmy', 'sweet', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'must', 'break', 'world', 'prevent', 'marrying', ""'cool"", 'dude', 'next', 'door.When', 'finally', 'own', 'bubble', 'suit', 'boring', 'Californian', 'suburbia', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Tim', 'Burton', ""'Edward"", 'Scissorhands', 'neighborhood', 'journey', 'life', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'note', 'here', 'bus', 'stop', ""'Curry"", 'Ice', 'Cream', 'truck', ""'fi"", 'hudred', 'dollas', 'mudwrestling', 'scene', 'Vegas', ""'Bright"", 'Shiny', 'People', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bright', 'shiny', 'not', 'mention', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'aka', 'Me', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'freak', 'show', 'circus', 'ringleader', 'believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'everyone', 'director', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", ""'get"", 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'want', 'hilarious', 'irreverent', 'laughs', 'one', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'superb', 'definitely', 'gon', 'be', 'one', 'watch', 'Anyone', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'totally', 'disparate', 'movies', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'completely', 'different', 'ranges', 'definitely', 'talented', 'individual.Watch', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'laugh', 'keep', 'watching']",N/A
