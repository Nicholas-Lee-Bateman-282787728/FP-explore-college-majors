What's funny is when they visit each other's parents.  Jessica Tandy plays Goldie's mom, and she is wonderful.

But as the movie progresses -- and as their characters' love affair begins to disintigrate -- the laughs get fewer and farther between and you might find yourself wanting to see what's on TV. However, if you fight through the lulls that dominate the middle-third of &quot;Best Friends,&quot; you'll be rewarded with perhaps the best part of the movie -- the end.

235306,AY12DBB0U420B,6300269760,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Sometimes I'll pick a movie based solely on my impression of the stars involved. For example, I'll watch any Clint Eastwood movie. Some are better than others, but all are good. Well, almost all. In any case, I found a Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn DVD on the bargain rack: ""Best Friends."" Now, my idea was that it would be a really good comedy and a fun thing to watch as a late night movie. Well, I missed on this one.The story involves two Hollywood writers who are best friends for five years and have lived together for the past three. He wants to get married but she is somewhat reluctant. Now, there's a twist in the plot! They end up married (a quickie) and decide to go on a train trip to visit one another's parents for a honeymoon. Does that sound like a disaster in the making, or what? It gets better. Her folks live in Buffalo, New York, and it's the winter, and his live in the world's largest condominium in Virginia. Well, both visits turn out to be slowly unfolding debacles, each for very different reasons, and the tension in the new marriage grows ever greater. Oh, I might add that the couple is under relentless pressure to complete a movie script and they can't work on it until after they get back from their little restful ""vacation."" Well, they make it back and break up before completing the script. Now, can you guess what happens? Yes, they have to finish it no matter what the circumstances. Okay, you know the rest. They finally make up, complete the script on time and live happily ever after. Yaawwwnnnn!How can I like the stars so much and dislike the movie? Well, the plot was weak and predictable, for one. The acting was like the characters were just walking through their parts and had no gusto at all. It was funny, but only in a somewhat painful way. I kept looking at my watch and wondering when it would finally be over. It just didn't click. That's hard to define, isn't it? Well, Burt Reynolds in ""Smokey and the Bandit"" clicked and I can watch that movie over and over and still enjoy it. This one will not be repeated. Trust me.Gary Peterson",3,Burt and Goldie.

235311,A1W6AMIGHPX3UQ,6300269760,J. Merritt,"[5, 8]","Based on the real-life experiences of Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson, this 1982 romantic comedy works best in the middle, when it's on the road. Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn are longtime screenwriting partners and roommates until Burt pushes for marriage. Goldie reluctantly agrees, and immediately after the civil ceremony the couple launches on a lengthy road trip to meet each other's parents. The trip forms the lion's share of the film, and much of it works quite well. Jessica Tandy & Barnard Hughes (as Goldie's parents in Buffalo) and Audra Lindley & Keenan Wynn (as Burt's folks in northern Virginia) absolutely steal the show. Before and after these stayovers, however, the film falls a bit flat, mainly because the Bandit and the Girl In My Soup are never particularly believable as a couple. Nonetheless, the middle of the film provides sufficient laughs to make it worth a rental.

235319,A28L16QKD3G1XG,6300269760,Thoughts by CJ,"[0, 0]","I've been waiting for years for the Burt Reynolds' ""feel"" good films to come out on DVD. I remember these films growing up in the 80's, and I love them! Goldie Hawn and Burt Reynolds are iconic 1980's film stars; I watched them before the John Hughes' films ('Pretty in Pink', 'Sixteen Candles,' 'Breakfast Club', etc.). Goldie Hawn's ""Private Benjamin"" and Burt Reynolds' ""Paternity"" are CLASSICS! They are hilarious. Where is ""Paternity"" on DVD?  ""Best Friends"" is quinessential to anyone's 1980's film collection. It is part of a multi-volume set I buy for wedding gifts I purchase when my friends get married.In this film, Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn are writers, business associates, and long term lovers. On top of the world, yet feeling as though something was missing, Reynolds' character pressures Hawn's into a long-term committment. Even though Hawn feels that marriage will ruin the existing relationship, she agrees to a quickie ceremony in East LA. For most of the film the two travel east to meet each other's families. It is during this hilarious travel marathon that spans from Wisconsin to Virginia, and back to Los Angeles that Hawn and Reynolds' characters see sides of each other's characters they might have wished were left undiscoverd.This is one of the real films of the 80's that looked at modern relationships. It isn't a play on 50's culture, or some make-believe futuristic modern features that were so popular of films during this time. It was real, entertaining, and the actors were superb. Anyone that loves Kate Hudson should invest a little time in Goldie Hawn, the original....so good, so original for her time. Burt Reynolds? Forget the silly car films of the day he starred; he was meant for these films. Don't forget to watch ""Starting Over"" and ""Paternity.""
