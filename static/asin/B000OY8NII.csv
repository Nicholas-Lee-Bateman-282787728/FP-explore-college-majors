However much to my surprise, the pilot was a decent start. And the premise, about a town of super-geniuses, has a tremendous amount of potential for some very interesting stories.Others have commented on the terrific cast, so I won't repeat their praise again here. The first season seems to have been an opportunity for the writers to experiment with different premises. I don't think all the episodes premises work that well within the framework of the show. Although I'm happy to say that the show does get stronger towards the end.If you didn't completely like the first season of Eureka (like me), then I strongly recommend giving the second season a chance.

So I will keep this review short.Overall this is a very enjoyable show. My children (ages in range from 9 to 13) have enjoyed it. The story line is about a town that is tied to a business named Global Dynamics. (GD for short). GD is a lab like environment similar to other Government Labs. Engineers and scientists and other sciency type of people are encouraged to make great leaps in technology and inventions.And with great leaps come great challenges and thus the show is built around these wierd situations that wouldn't normally occur. There are several people who are not as smart around this town, the sherrif being one of them. These people have to often solve these wierd situations. The talking house gets mad. The DNA of the sherrif's daughter gets changed so she ages faster than normal. An extra sun is developed. etc etc.This is a great show. The love lines are very realistic in many ways. The interactions between the people in the town stay true from one season to the next. There is not this gratuitis show of sex to 'keep the excitement'. There is a genuine idea behind this that smart people are the ones that make the great advances in our world and that smart people are not lacking in common sense, not geeks, not nerds- but real people who are also smart.We have enjoyed this show.Enjoy.",5,What Fun.

While he is distracted a dog wanders onto the road, and he has to swerve to miss it.  When he does so, he slides off of a wet Oregon road and is stuck.  A phone call later a tow truck appears, and he is taken to the nearby town of Eureka.  At first everything seems fine in this sleepy little town, but little by little things become increasingly unusual.  Finally, he gets involved with a search for a little boy.  His work brings him to the attention of the local town leadership, and he is recruited to be the town's new sheriff.  When this happens he soon learns that Eureka is no ordinary town.  It is a town populated by ultra-brilliant scientists and their families.  The scientists work at a nearby secret research facility - Global Dynamics.  It is supported by government and military funding, and researchers there investigate every field of science.  Jack Carter doesn't know what he's getting into.As time goes along we are introduced to a colorful, eccentric cast of characters.  These include the lab director, the local mechanic (who also does physics), the head of Global Dynamic security and her autistic son, the company psychiatrist, the chef of the local restaurant, the deputy, the corporate gopher ""Fargo"", and on and on.The show is funny, engaging, interesting, and a combination of completely believable and unbelievable.  Gradually Sheriff Carter gets used to the town, and they to him, more or less.  And though he's pretty much a regular guy, he and the braniacs of Eureka are able to find ways to work together.I am SO glad that I found this series.  I'm also glad that there are more seasons to watch.The character development and diversity of story lines and characters make Eureka a fun experience.I also VERY much appreciate the fact that this show is watchable.

Both series explore 'science' effects of articles which can destroy people or the world. The main popular science questions are explored with humor, en route.'Eureka' is premised on a town full of science geeks whose experiments and creations, often go wrong.  Each episode takes you through something that goes wrong, and how it gets righted, all within the hour.  The longterm plot is also canned:  some evil nefarious outside group, related to some corporate entity or the Government, is out to remove and use, stuff created within Eureka.However, within Eureka, another corporate entity houses the experiments and creations, and everyone within Eureka is directly or indirectly dependent on that entity.  It is run by kind persons.  So the series offers a dual-sided perspective of corporate headship, not merely the stereotypical Big Evil Corporation lie so many have come to love.Eureka's cast chemistry, however, doesn't synergize until well past the 2nd season.  Maybe that slowness is a director decision, using the initial awkwardness to create tension?  For until well into Season 2, the actors seem to just speak lines and move per blocking directives.  As if ordered to behave, woodenly.The characters are human enough, and the acting is good.  Script is lackadasical, until well after the 2nd season begins, so one is tempted to quit watching.  Don't quit.Canned nature of the episodes is also detrimental, wash rinse repeat.  So you already know how each episode will turn out.  Even so, the plots are intertwined, and the scripting gets better with each episode.  So eventually, both the characters and the plots, grow on you.

I worked for a campaign for the first time when I was twelve. Between then and now it certainly appears that what what passes for political discourse would have formally been considered unacceptable by either party. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been brutal and highly controversial. I other words,it's hard to avoid the sadness, nastiness and stress that has found its way into virtually every segment of society.And then Eureka came along. For the mere cost of forty five minutes or so of suspension of disbelief, viewers can enter a world where kindness, fairness and humor prevail. This is made possible by the fine acting, writing and production values that this show has brought to the screen every week.Like other successful ensemble shows, it is easy to imagine that the cast members truly enjoy working together, and that they have exceptionally good relationships with the shows creators and writers. During the 1st season, some spectacularly funny (and perhaps a tad inappropriate) podcasts were available to enjoy while watching the individual episodes. Not only was it enormous fun, it offered viewers real insight to the show's creation, filming it's pilot and what it was like once the program got the green light.Collin Ferguson as Jack Carter does a wonderful job of being the straight man for almost every other character on the show. He strikes just the right chord of portraying a strong man, who isn't ashamed to be in situations where he finds himself in over his head. Eureka's producers managed a huge score in getting the brilliant Joe Morton to join the cast. I never imagined that he would stay with the show. Likewise having Salli Richardson Whitfield on the show as the beautiful but frequently conflicted Dr. Allison Blake was a first class piece of casting. Jordan Hinson has proven to be a real discovery. Although she didn't come to the show with a very long resume, she is clearly a gifted actress who I fully expect will have a career long after Eureka has left the airwaves. As Deputy Lupo, Erica Cerra is not only a feast for the eyes, but has had the opportunity to display a wide range of emotions, always with great skill. All of the cast members, regulars or visitors are uniformly superior.Eureka is like a big bowl of your mother's best chicken soup.

A few of the storylines are draggy, but the series also has some great acting, brilliant dilemmas, and mysteries that promise to fuel future seasons.While dragging his delinquent daughter back to L.A., Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) accidentally crashes the car. The only nearby place is the picture-perfect small-town of Eureka. But Jack starts to suspect that Eureka is a little odd -- a woman making triangular bubbles, a quartet of clones, and a little autistic boy making physics equations on the sidewalk are only a few of the oddities.His suspicions are confirmed when random places get blasted to ashes, including a cowfield and an RV. So Jack is told Eureka's secret -- it's a town entirely inhabited by geniuses, set up by the government to create new scientific advances. But a scientist has done a little project all on his own, producing a tachyon accelerator -- which is ripping the seams out of the universe.Because the sheriff was badly injured by the accelerator, D.O.D. representative Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) makes Jack the new sheriff of Eureka. Now he has a new job, a ""smart house"" in an old nuclear bunker, and a trigger-happy deputy who loves her guns.But he also has has to deal with a bunch of strange problems -- an electrical ""ghost,"" a scientist whose healing experiments transform him, alien paranoia, memory blackouts, a doomsday device from the Cold War, a drug that causes superspeed, killer nanites, problematic pollen, and a mysterious Artifact deep inside the Global Dynamics building...The first season of ""Eureka"" is a pretty good example of how to make a sci-fi show -- not many programs can balance out standalone episodes with long-term arcs (the Artifact, Beverly's agenda). Some of these don't work out, like the artificial Jack/Allison attraction, but most of the time ""Eureka"" stays on solid ground.Yeah, most of the storylines center on scientific disasters. But the writers sprinkle it with funny scenarios (the baseball teams are called the Protons and Neutrons) and funny dialogue (""Well, car or no car, this is a 30 mile an hour zone""). But there are moments of poignancy, such as Nathan Stark's tearful farewell to his robot ""son,"" or a woman reluctantly starting to care about her clone's little son.Despite being the lead, Ferguson doesn't stand out as much because his character is so... ordinary. It's the weirdos that are lovable -- Matt Frewer as a deranged Aussie vet, Ed Quinn as a charming head researcher (and Allison's ex-hubby), Neil Grayston as an ubergeek, and Joe Morton as the car mechanic who also happens to be a brilliant inventer. Jordan Hinson rounds off the cast as Jack's troublemaking daughter.The first season of ""Eureka"" hits some road bumps, but it's definitely a well-written, intelligent sci-fi series with a quirky, funny twist.

Characters frequently refer to the towns founding principle of ""pushing the boundaries"" of science, and the by-product of collateral damage that results.

While the writing of Season 1 has yet to achieve the cohesion reflected in Series 2, and the story consequently meanders a bit looking for what works with audiences and what doesn't, it's still mostly on the mark, and great fun to watch.

If you ever wished that the SyFy channel would take the best elements of all those wonderfully cheesy movies that they produce, whip them together in a stew, and see what happens, then ""Eureka"" is the answer to your prayers. Each character was perfectly cast, headlined by the wonderful Sheriff Carter, who has everything that one could hope for in a leading role (at least on SyFy). He is that goofy, funny, honest, reliable, downright likable guy who embodies all the best parts of the classic ""SyFy Sheriff"", while channeling a bit of Bruce Campbell's spirit. Right on!As far as the setting of this show goes, it's hard not to love the town of Eureka, which seems like it was inspired by ""BioShock"" and ""Atlas Shrugged""... but with a lot more love and fun. The new scientific mess that Sheriff Carter seems to find himself trying to resolve each week is always enjoyable. The conflicts that arise are a perfect blend between being comfortable/familiar (to other conflicts in the series) and fresh enough to remain interesting and unique. Additionally, the show does a great job of developing a long term plot, by sprinkling clues throughout the episodes over the course of the season.As you can see, this is an ""Amazon Verified Purchase""... on DVD. ""Are they still making those?"" I asked myself, when I saw that it was the ONLY purchase option. The Blu-ray format has been around for over seven years now, and I see no reason why manufacturers would expect me to buy an antiquated, vastly inferior format (DVD)... unless if they force me to. Would they ask me to buy it on VHS, if it was cheaper for them to manufacture? For some strange reason, this marvelous show is not available for purchase on Blu-ray. There is a HUGE difference in visual quality between these DVDs and when I watch the show on Netflix, which streams in HD. Needless to say, it looks much, much better in the HD format, and the (presumably low budget) CG effects hold up surprisingly well under such high detail. I sincerely hope that SyFy and its parent company will decide to offer their great shows in as many formats as possible- including Blu-ray.

Carter immediately becomes aware of Eureka's uniqueness as embodied in its odd residents who are more than they seem: an auto mechanic who's also a space shuttle engineer, a beautiful innkeeper who doubles as a psychotherapist, children who give intricate directions and who write mathematical formulas on the sidewalk...Added to the peculiar sights he witnesses, Carter's interest is further piqued when his offers to help the local constabulary in a missing child case is summarily rebuffed.In due course, he does learn the secret of Eureka, of which origin dates back to Albert Einstein and Harry S. Truman, who, after World War 2 and the scare of the atomic bomb, decided to build the tiny town as a safe haven and a workplace for our nation's greatest thinkers. In the fifty years of Eureka's existence, its residents have been hugely responsible for most of today's technological advances. But, of course, not everything can be a bonafide success. Global warming, for example, has been touted as one side effect of one experimental goof in Eureka. Sworn to secrecy, Jack Carter proves to be instrumental in resolving a horrific scientific project gone awry, impressing the powers-that-be enough that he ends up as the new Sheriff of Eureka.The series is colorfully flavored with a host of idiosyncratic characters effectively brought to life by a good cast: Carter's mutinous daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson); the beautiful, gung-ho ex-Army Ranger and current Deputy Sheriff Josefina ""Jo"" Lupo (Erica Cerra, with whom I think I'm in love); Department of Defense agent Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who toils as the government liaison between Eureka and the Pentagon and who, by the way, looks muy caliente in her pink undies; Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn), the icy, controlling head researcher of Global Dynamics and also Allison's husband; the insightful and sexy psychotherapist Beverly Barlowe (Debrah Farentino), who has dark secrets of her own; genial guy and mechanical genius Henry Deacon (Joe Morton), who slums as a car mechanic; the unstable Aussie Jim Taggart (Matt Frewer), the self-styled  ""biological containment specialist""; and young Douglas Fargo (Neil Grayston), the bespectacled, sycophant computer geek. By the way, solely from a red-blooded dude's perspective, it's always appreciated when three gorgeous females are featured regularly in the same show, and Richardson-Whitfield, Farentino, and Cerra contribute in lifting EUREKA to new heights of must-see-TV-ness.Colin Ferguson's performance as Sheriff Jack Carter provides the bridge and the grounding point of view for the audience. As the witty, perceptive, and sometimes lost-at-sea Sheriff, he hits all the right notes here. His normal guy reactions to the endless slew of strangeness surrounding him are believable and, at times, hilarious. There's some nice verbal sparring (read: sexual tension) between Carter and Allison, but I particularly relish the chemistry *snicker* between Carter and his fully automated, hermetically sealed, very vocal military bunker/smart house, S.A.R.A.H.As a television series, EUREKA proved to be the highest-rated show on the Sci-Fi Channel of 2006, beating out the equally excellent, revamped BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. This exuberant show is equal parts X-FILES, TWILIGHT ZONE, STAR TREK and NORTHERN EXPOSURE in its playful quirkiness and forays into the weird; not to mention, the whistly, whimsical theme tune puts you immediately in sync with the show's oddball frequency.These are some of the tried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology. The laudable special effects are there when needed but do not overwhelm the show; the episodes are engrossing, if a bit warped at times, and the season's main story arc, involving the super  secret Section 5 and something called the Artifact, promises to go somewhere. I'm so glad the Sci-Fi Channel decided to renew this series for a second season. So, if you want to catch a show where crazy quantum physics regularly run amok, where wild inventions surface on a daily basis which are, by the way, gadgety cool enough to make even James Bond swoon, and where cheerleaders spout theorems and school nerds run the school, and also where the world is constantly threatened by the scientific lab toys of Eureka's brilliant but erratic personalities...well, then, yes, get your geek on and give EUREKA: SEASON ONE a whirl.",5,"""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

1066670,A2KCJ6AACY6J0L,B000OY8NII,James Shannon Bussey,"[40, 47]","As someone stated earlier the Sci-Fi channel over the last few years have been trying to bolster its viewership with original shows. Well ""Eureka"" is arguably the best of the bunch. The show is definately an original and is a refreshing storyline compared to the same old Science Fiction story.First of all, the actors and actresses in this show are phenomenal. The leading character, Sheriff Jack Carter, is played by Colin Ferguson an outstanding actor. Another actor that I would like to mention by name is Joe Morton, who plays the resident genius / car garage owner by the name of Henry Deacon. Each week presents a different problem and Deacon is usually in the middle of it. Morton has to be one of the best and most underrated actors on prime time TV. He has played on every prime time show imaginable from CSI: NY and the original Law & Order to the X-Files (episode 1, 2000).Secondly, if you watch shows because of beautiful women, then this is the show for you. Eureka has three of the most beautiful women on primetime TV.Allison Blake is a co-star played by Salli Richardson-Whitfield. Salli plays an agent of the federal govt. who acts as the liaison between the federal govt. and Eureka. She is smart, professional, and a goddess.Then there is Beverly Barlowe played by Debrah Farentino. Beverly is the town therapist / Inn owner who is also some kind of secret agent. Her sex appeal seeps from the TV. Its unbelievable that she is not a bigger star than she is.Last there is Deputy Jo Lupo played by actress Erica Cerra. Jo is Jack Carter's Gung Ho Deputy who thinks she is the next Dirty Harry. She is a little Tom Boy-ish, but even that can't hide her beauty.The layout and the setting of this show is great. It has just the right amount of fresh new ideas mixed with some traditional themes of TV. For instance there is a ""thing""  between Carter and Blake that somewhat remind me of ""Who's The Boss""Overall this is one of the best shows on night time TV, both cable and major networks.

1066698,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000OY8NII,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The Sci-Fi Channel has been trying to grow its roster of original programming in the last couple of years. Seeing that many of its benchmark shows have ended or are nearing their end, the new Sci-fi acquisitions seem to be more experimental in nature. Let's try a lot of different genres and see what sticks--this seems to be the programming mentality. Eureka is an interesting idea, but its light and quirky tone is sometimes at odds with a vaguely sinister central mystery. Essentially, Eureka is a secret town that is populated with the country's most dynamic scientific minds. As a government installation, Eureka is hidden in America's heartland and is the home for much cutting-edge and revolutionary experimentation. A new sheriff arrives in town with his daughter (all rather conveniently, but believable isn't what this show strives for). They discover that this town is filled with eccentric geniuses, each more odd than the next. And wacky hijinks ensue--each episode one of the bumbling geniuses does something that he/she shouldn't have and the sheriff must save the day!Eureka is a genial enough show and a passable entertainment. It may try, however, to be too many things to too many people. It tries to satisfy episodic sci-fi fans by presenting itself primarily as self-contained stories--but generally the individual plots aren't particularly enthralling and/or original. It tries to satisfy conspiracy theorists (and those that favor continuing story arcs) by having a central mystery about a powerful and secret object being held by the government--but the mythology is so vague and the big reveal comes much too late and is much too little. It tries to satisfy comedy fans by setting up a quirky town of irrepressible characters--but anyone who has seen quirky done before has undoubtedly seen it done better. Think Northern Exposure or even something like Gilmore Girls, and you'll realize that this show tries to have the quirk but without really developing the supporting characters. It tries to satisfy the romantics by having the central characters spar and flirt even though it's apparent they were meant for each other--it's not real romantic tension, it's just mild playfulness.I'm not saying that there aren't individual episodes that work, because there are. It's just that the show lacks a real originality that one would expect with such an unusual concept. It doesn't help matters that most of the geniuses are complete morons--but I suppose that's part of the running joke. Seriously, though, the trouble this town gets into is always caused by someone's harebrained scheme gone awry. It's the technologically advanced version of a Lucille Ball mishap--Imagine Sheriff Carter as Ricky wailing, ""Oh, you genius, you're gonna have some splaining to do!"" And that about covers the dramatics of the series. With everything being so silly, the show lacks a narrative imperative--nothing real is at stake, anything that is done can be undone. There's no danger, no real consequence.What we're left with then is a show I'd describe as ""cutesy."" It's mildly enjoyable, you're likely to smile through most of any given episode. I do credit Colin Ferguson as the sheriff, however, with holding it all together. So amiable and likable--he provides Eureka with what it needs most, its heart. More intelligent and sensible than any of the town's geniuses--Ferguson has a star presence and is the reason the show succeeds at its fundamental level. Also, for sheer humor, I was in love with the sheriff's bunker-style house! Check out Eureka with moderate expectations and you might find it sweet enough--but the next Farscape (a show that pulled off quirkiness, real romance, genuine comedy, action, and great plotting) or Battlestar Galactica, it's not!

The character development, in terms of both comedic quirks and emotional depth, is mimimal and generic.

The way the dialogue is written seems to lend itself to this type of delivery though.

For some reason I find everything very subdued.Even with all the fantastic goings on the overall effect is bland. The character of the Sheriff should provide an anchor for the viewer, afterall, he's the one (from the onset) exposed to the wonders of EUREKA as we follow his entry into the town.Yet within the first few episodes (the pilot is of double length, 83:00min) even the Sherriff seems kinda ho-hum about the whole place.Case in point would be his moving into the underground bunkerhouse. You would think there could be more development in his adjustment period to the place (considering its wonders). Instead it comes off like a sci-fi prop within a few minutes. Ho-hum. Take it all in stride, Sheriff Carter is super cool, etc.The whole concept of this super-functional, technological 'dreamhouse' would get more yuks with a 'The Jetsons' cartoon treatment. Here it just ""is"". Even when his daughter moves in it's treated like there is nothing really to adjust to. She moves in and the next time we see her she's just another teenager hangin around like the house is no big deal (i bet Fargo gets his jollies, the house has cameras everywhere). Nothing is developed. Not much anyway.My wife likes the show but said its my call wether we stop after Season One. We are half-way through #1 now. Meh. Maybe some drugs would help?Good grief! I never thought a 'Laff Track' could be considered scientific evolution but EUREKA! needs something....However, if the Sheriff can't get wide-eyed goggle faced about anything (it seems), how can I?YET, there is something percolating here that keeps my interest hanging on. This show has its moments when it gells but something is missing.

The show isn't totally like The X-Files, as there's been no real alien activity...yet. But more than any other show, EUReKA is The X-Files spiritual offspring. The cast of characters is already quite large, and each of them are interesting in their own way.The storylines are that of the fantastic, and since the show is built upon the fact that the town of EUReKA is made up entirely of brilliant minded scientists and inventors, the writers have set up an instance where the show could just keep on going for years, and as long as the writing stays sharp, I hope it does.  I saw the first episode of season 2 last night, and even as good as last season was, this new episode was even better!What i found cool about the DVD set was the disc trays are made out of a biodegradable material which is essentially paste made out of potatos. It's a lot harder of a substance than you'd think, and actually seems almost as durable as soft plastic, or maybe twice as strong a heavy cardboard. The downside is the little prongs that hold the DVD's in aren't quite strong enough and the DVD's pop out quite often.

Except for an odd hour here and there or the occasional James Bond festival, I've missed pretty much everything on TV since about 1975. So, when my wife invited me to watch it on netflix, my response was ""Yes dear. Let me get something to read.""So, I was very surprised at enjoying this, even a little. Lack of commercials did a lot for my mood. And, as a borderline nerd pride activist, so does the overall theme of people being friendly, having wide interests, and being smarter than me in every direction. Smart people are fun. (The truly smart people I mean, not the poseurs with one odd knack.)Well, I keep reading while I watch it, but I do that with almost everything that doesn't have subtitles. It's good, though, as commodity entertainment goes, and shows that nerds aren't just the hygiene-challenged stereotype we've come to tolerate. I'll come back for more. The ""Andy of Mayberry"" vibe, with the single-father sheriff and whistled theme music, adds a retro kind of appeal that clashes pleasantly with the SF backdrop.But it's still just TV.-- wiredweird",3,Surprisingly good,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,1088,"[""'m"", 'not', 'TV', 'person', 'odd', 'hour', 'here', 'there', 'occasional', 'James', 'Bond', 'festival', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'TV', '1975', 'So', 'when', 'wife', 'invited', 'watch', 'netflix', 'response', 'was', 'Yes', 'dear', 'Let', 'get', 'something', 'read', 'So', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'enjoying', 'even', 'little', 'Lack', 'commercials', 'did', 'lot', 'mood', 'borderline', 'nerd', 'pride', 'activist', 'so', 'overall', 'theme', 'people', 'being', 'friendly', 'having', 'wide', 'interests', 'being', 'smarter', 'direction', 'Smart', 'people', 'are', 'fun', 'truly', 'smart', 'people', 'mean', 'not', 'poseurs', 'one', 'odd', 'knack', 'Well', 'keep', 'reading', 'watch', 'do', 'almost', 'everything', ""n't"", 'have', 'subtitles', 'good', 'though', 'commodity', 'entertainment', 'nerds', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'hygiene-challenged', 'stereotype', ""'ve"", 'come', 'tolerate', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'more', 'Andy', 'Mayberry', 'vibe', 'single-father', 'sheriff', 'whistled', 'theme', 'music', 'retro', 'kind', 'appeal', 'pleasantly', 'SF', 'backdrop.But', 'still', 'just', 'TV.', 'wiredweird']",Eureka: Season One

Not too serious, but with the scifi in place, it's always interesting to see what exotic and unusual experiments have gone awry, and what the consequences are for the town. What's not to like, a town where Science is king, and the sceintists get to play with as many of their toys as they want, government funded to boot! The cast have grown into their respective characters very well, and each brings something to the show, and the personal interactons between characters is becoming well developed as well.Along with Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, the show is well written, the science makes sense, even if it's out there sometimes, you never know what's going to happen. I like this show and plan on buying season 2, 3,4,5 or how ever many seasons it lasts.
