In the longer version,  the Jeremy Irons character at the beginning of the film is in his old age.  He visits his old farmhouse with his daughter and remembers the years gone past.  The movie then goes into a flashback and tells the story from his youth.In the DVD version, the entire opening scene is omitted and the story is told from the beginning.  Therefore there is NO suggestion of a flashback.  The edited out opening scene is quite poignant and gives more insight into the Jeremy Irons character.Decent and interesting film none the less.

Since I haven't read the novel, I have nothing to compare it against but even then it's obvious that a lot has had to be omitted in order to make it into a film.Overall, it's a riveting film, though parts of it were fairly predictable---mainly the circular tragedy and poetic/ironic justice parts, and of course the South American socioeconomic/political history is very familiar.  Not until reading the production notes on the DVD did I know for certain that the movie is set in Chile, but that was my first guess immediately---though it is curious that the film barely mentions in passing, the vital role of our C.I.A. in setting up the military coup which overthrew the democratically elected government and installed the hideously repressive and genocidal Pinochet regime.The ending, with Winona Ryder opining on the preciousness of life's every moment and the power of love and forgiveness, basically pops up out of nowhere but I'm sure that these themes are much better developed in the novel.There are far worse ways to spend 2 hours; with this film, despite its subtle flaws, at least we get a little bit of modern South American history and society, even if the dirty little secrets of our C.I.A. involvement in it are just barely hinted at.  In many ways it is not only a good eye-opener about social and political injustice and brutality, but also carries something of a feminist edge---showing the reckless and self-absorbed megalomania and egotism of the ambitious men who claw their way into the ruling class and then proceed to keep everyone else around them down and under their thumbs.",5,"not bad, considering...",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1638,"['adapted', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'even', 'then', 'obvious', 'lot', 'had', 'be', 'omitted', 'order', 'make', 'film.Overall', 'riveting', 'film', 'parts', 'were', 'fairly', 'predictable', '-mainly', 'circular', 'tragedy', 'poetic/ironic', 'justice', 'parts', 'course', 'South', 'American', 'socioeconomic/political', 'history', 'very', 'familiar', 'Not', 'reading', 'production', 'notes', 'DVD', 'did', 'know', 'certain', 'movie', 'set', 'Chile', 'was', 'first', 'guess', 'immediately', 'curious', 'film', 'barely', 'mentions', 'passing', 'vital', 'role', 'C.I.A', 'setting', 'up', 'military', 'coup', 'overthrew', 'democratically', 'elected', 'government', 'installed', 'hideously', 'repressive', 'genocidal', 'Pinochet', 'regime.The', 'ending', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'opining', 'preciousness', 'life', 'moment', 'power', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'basically', 'up', 'nowhere', ""'m"", 'sure', 'themes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'developed', 'novel.There', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'subtle', 'flaws', 'least', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'modern', 'South', 'American', 'history', 'society', 'even', 'dirty', 'little', 'secrets', 'C.I.A', 'involvement', 'are', 'just', 'barely', 'hinted', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'eye-opener', 'social', 'political', 'injustice', 'brutality', 'also', 'something', 'feminist', 'edge', '-showing', 'reckless', 'self-absorbed', 'megalomania', 'egotism', 'ambitious', 'men', 'who', 'claw', 'way', 'ruling', 'class', 'then', 'proceed', 'keep', 'everyone', 'else', 'down', 'thumbs']",N/A

I also thought that the actor who played the illegitimate son and  Antonio Banderas should have  switched roles, yet despite my personal preferences, everything in the film rose above them and I just loved it.

I can't thank her enough for introducing this movie to me.This is not the story of a house, but rather two... that takes place in South America...a beautiful country with an urgent desire to reform.  Here begins our 60 year long saga of three remarkable generations.Esteban (Jeremy Irons) wants to marry the young bride Rosa, the beautiful daughter of the Del Valle family.  But an accidental tragedy takes the young girl's life and Esteban leaves, heart-broken to find his fortune on a large farm in the country side. Here he builds a beautiful house, hires ranch-hands, and becomes the infinitely wealthy ""Patron"".Esteban returns to the house his former beloved once lived, and to his surprise, he instantly falls in love with Rosa's younger and very clairvoyant sister, Clara (Meryl Streep). They marry and return to his wealthy farm, bringing along Esteban's sister Ferla (Glenn Close) who is a turmoiled woman who has never known affection in her life. Esteban treats her abusively and cares nothing for her.  Opposingly, Clara adores Ferla and they become closer than sisters. When I say closer, I can almost say there were moments of romantic love between Clara and Ferla.  Ferla, who is an old, black-wearing spinster finds herself obsessed with Clara...her beauty, her passion, and her life, and believes her unusual gift of seeing the future brings her closer to God.  All these things are denied in life to Ferla.Once Clara gives birth to her daughter Blanca, Esteban in his hateful manner decides Ferla is a threat to his family and dismisses her forever from their lives.Life goes on at the ranch without Ferla's over-zealous presence.  Evidence of Esteban having illegitimate children, and mistreating his ranch workers eventually causes too much trouble for him.  He begins to grow forever angry at heart..resenting the locals, often beating them into submission to work.  He treats, what he believes, the ""lower caste"" like animals and maintains a life-long disgust for them.How unfortunate for him that his daughter Blaca (Winona Ryder) falls for the most revolutionary man on the farm, Pedro (Antonio banderas).  Thier love, like her parent's began at childhood and they intend never to be seperated.Pedro is chased with gun far from the farm (having no idea that Blanca is pregnant with his child). An attempt to control the revolutionary ideas of ""The People"" and to keep him away from Blanca.  This is the beginning of futile wars to come in South America.  One with many horrifying twists and turns for the family.This movie is excellent in so many ways. The cast was nothing short of perfection.  There are enough hidden secrets, desires, politics, intrigue, war, torture, and affairs, to lend this movie enough dark corners to be explored, that it is impossible to even take notice of the length of the movie. It is long, but every chapter in this multi-generational film is as exciting as the first.  I honestly don't understand why this movie is so unknown.

The film makes a smart narrative ellipsis through threwe generations along seventy years, and shows us those first insights of a little child by then, who is gifted of premonitory visions, who falls in love with the boyfriend of her sister. She foresees an imminent tragedy and lives with this terrible sense of guilt by not having been able to avoid it.But, through the years, this young boy will become a true wealthy man and love will make the rest. But meanwhile, there's a lot of brilliant secondary plots that enrich the historical vision with absorbing engagement.Once more, Jeremy Irons and Merrill Streep reencountered again and both head with admirable realism to convey those unsaid feelings. But besides, the film shows us the social environment, its inner contradictions, the conflict of power between this self-exigent man and his sister Ferula (Glenn Close) and the unstoppable love affair (a veiled homage to Romeo and Juliet) among his own daughter (Winona Ryder with her dazzling beauty) and the son of a very humble worker of his farm (Antonio Banderas).The narrative pulse of Billie August breaths a pastoral poetry, with those arresting landscapes but overall to be able to express and even universalize the provincial environment without falling into commonplaces.",4,A rewarding film!,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1432,"['touching', 'inspiration', 'Isabel', 'Allende', 'feminine', 'perspective', 'deals', 'profound', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'wealthy', 'family', 'film', 'smart', 'narrative', 'ellipsis', 'threwe', 'generations', 'seventy', 'years', 'first', 'insights', 'little', 'child', 'then', 'who', 'gifted', 'premonitory', 'visions', 'who', 'love', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'imminent', 'tragedy', 'terrible', 'sense', 'guilt', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'able', 'avoid', 'it.But', 'years', 'young', 'boy', 'will', 'become', 'true', 'wealthy', 'man', 'love', 'will', 'make', 'rest', 'meanwhile', 'lot', 'brilliant', 'secondary', 'plots', 'enrich', 'historical', 'vision', 'absorbing', 'engagement.Once', 'more', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Merrill', 'Streep', 'reencountered', 'again', 'head', 'admirable', 'realism', 'convey', 'unsaid', 'feelings', 'film', 'social', 'environment', 'inner', 'contradictions', 'conflict', 'power', 'self-exigent', 'man', 'sister', 'Ferula', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'unstoppable', 'love', 'affair', 'veiled', 'homage', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'own', 'daughter', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'dazzling', 'beauty', 'son', 'very', 'humble', 'worker', 'farm', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', '.The', 'narrative', 'pulse', 'Billie', 'August', 'breaths', 'pastoral', 'poetry', 'arresting', 'landscapes', 'overall', 'be', 'able', 'express', 'even', 'universalize', 'provincial', 'environment', 'falling', 'commonplaces']",N/A

During these decades the family goes through many changes and conflicts and so does the country. Due to the status of the family the changes and conflicts in the family and in the country effect each other. The plot covers social status, social climbing, social conflict, and social oppression, as will as political changes and conflicts. Mixed in with all of this, one of the main characters is clairvoyant. This plays into the plot but is not really a major contributor to the direction of the plot. She does, however, make a few predictions,  her and two people with her see someone who is dead, and after her death she makes two ghostly visits to other members of the family.I found the first half of the movie somewhat mediocre, but the second half picked up to fair as both the family and political conflicts build.The movie contains one rape scene, it is not explicit in a truly sexual way as the two people are only seen from the shoulder up during sex, but the woman's breasts are seen when her blouse is ripped open. Later a prostitute is seen nude, but only her breasts are seen from the front, she is seen fully from the rear. A man is later seen nude from the rear through a thin curtain while having sex with his wife. A couple in their late teens are seen nude have sex on the ground by the river, they are seen fully only from a distance. There is also one torture sequence which includes sexual torture, but does not include nudity.There is also one non-sexual nude scene when a boy and girl around the age of six are skinny dipping together.

This is one of our favorite films and for years we had to make do with my pan & scan VHS tape of 109 minutes.  But even that tape seemed complete and coherent. I haven't read the novel but my wife who read it in English & in its original Spanish thought the filmmakers did a good job in condensing the elaborate story.We watched this so-called 'substandard' DVD and enjoyed the film more than before. I haven't done a side-by-side comparison with the tape but this longer version of 133 minutes seems better than ever.  This widescreen version looked great on our new 42"" TV. If you don't know what's missing in the 140 minute version, a debatable unnecessary prologue that I explain in detail on the COMMENTS section below, you won't care as we did. This film is one to watch again & again because of the many good performances enhanced by ageing makeup. Everyone who borrowed my tape loved this family saga about forgiveness and the cast. I expect the same reaction when they borrow my DVD. Buy it and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. As for the lack of extras - What do you expect for $6.99??

I don't know if I would have followed the action of the movie as well otherwise.  When you get past the somewhat unbeliable casting of American actors as South America characters (where Antonio Banderas has the most believeable accent - you know you are in trouble), this movie is a pretty entertaining soap opera of familial events set in a political background.  The movie cuts out a lot of the characters from the book that you might miss (like the twins, the granddaughter, and a host of psychic friends, but it still manages to be entertaining if not melodramatic.  The settings of the movie really do sort of capture that magical realism tone of the book exceptionally, and the pace of the movie is excellent.

361271,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6303160565,Lawyeraau,"[2, 3]","I love this movie! It has a stellar cast, who give top notch performances. How can you go wrong with Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Antonio Banderas, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave, and Armin Muehler-Stahl? The answer is that you can't. It is a riveting piece of film making, based loosely upon Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name.The film delicately captures the mysticism of the book, rendering those scenes in which such is the focal point highly believable. This is no mean feat given the subject matter. The story takes place in South America. The saga begins in the nineteen thirties.Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Muehler-Stahl play the wealthy and liberal parents of two daughters, Rosa and Clara Del Valle. Rosa is the beautiful, older daughter. Clara, played by Meryl Streep's real life daughter, is a lovely child with exceptional, psychic gifts. Jeremy Irons plays the part of Esteban Trueba, an impoverished young man in love with Rosa. Vowing to make his fortune in order to marry her and provide her with the comforts to which she is accustomed, he succeeds in making his fortune. He loses Rosa, however, before being able to marry her, when she drinks poisoned wine intended for her liberal party father.Esteban, broken hearted, leaves with his fortune and buys an estancia, where he sternly rules with an iron fist over the peasants who work the land for him. They obsequiously refer to him as ""Patron"". He takes what he wants, even the women, with the expected result. He has a bastard son whom he does not acknowledge.Esteban has a spinster sister, Ferla, well acted by Glenn Close, who, for the past twenty years, has lived a grim existence in the city with their ailing mother, whom she has taken care of. When their mother dies, Esteban, now a bitter and lonely man, returns to the city from his estancia to attend his mother's funeral. In doing so, he spots Clara, who is now all grown up and ethereally portrayed by the very talented Meryl Streep. Not wasting a moment, he goes to her home. She, luminous, and mystical, already knows that he is there to ask for her hand in marriage and happily accepts. After all, she has loved him ever since she first saw him all those years ago.Clara lovingly embraces his sister, Ferla, into the bosom of her househould, when they move to her Esteban's estancia. Ferla blossoms from a bitter old maid into a companionable and pleasant woman, under Clara's warmth. Esteban and Clara eventually have a child, Blanca, who grows up playing with Pedro, the son of the estancia's indigenous indian foreperson. When Esteban discovers this, he sends Blanca away to boarding school. He does not want his daughter fraternizing with the peasants.Clara, loving and pure of heart, is his exact opposite. When their daughter finally grows up and returns home from school, she knows that the independent Blanca, well played by Winona Ryder, has fallen in love with her childhood playmate, Pedro, passionately portrayed by Antonio Banderas. Esteban hates Pedro, as Pedro is a liberal inciting the peasants to unionize and demand their rights, whipping them into a frenzy against the ""Patron"", or so Esteban sees it. He drives Pedro off his land. He also drives Ferla off, as he believes her to have unatural feelings for his wife, Clara. Possessive to a fault, he is consumed by jealousy. Clara and Esteban have a fight over his cruelties, and she finally leaves him, taking Blanca with her to the Del Valle family home in the city.Meanwhile, life goes on. Blanca, pregnant by Pedro, has his child, believing that Pedro has been killed by her father. Esteban, representing the wealthy, becomes senator. He reigns for years, until the liberals win power. When they do, however, their tenure is short lived, as a militairy coup sets up a reign of terror and his old sins come home to roost. Meanwhile, Blanca discovers that Pedro is alive, and they joyously hook up again. When Blanca is picked up as a political dissident and tortured for her political views, Esteban, old and broken, is now just a bit player in a larger arena. Too late, he tries to right some wrongs. Some of the wrongs, however, can never be righted.This is a magnificent, multi-generational family epic, that holds the viewer in its thrall. While it only loosely follows Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name, it is a winner in its own right. It has something for everyone, as it deals with human nature, as well as the complex emotions, forces, and events that shape one. The film is about a family struggling to find its place in our ever changing world, and the relationships that each member of that family forges. It is a rich and vibrant tapestry, which succeeds in capturing the viewer.",5,AN OUTSTANDING FAMILY SAGA...,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,4743,"['love', 'movie', 'stellar', 'cast', 'who', 'give', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Armin', 'Muehler-Stahl', 'answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'riveting', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'based', 'loosely', 'Isabelle', 'Allende', 'wonderful', 'book', 'same', 'name.The', 'film', 'delicately', 'mysticism', 'book', 'rendering', 'scenes', 'such', 'focal', 'point', 'highly', 'believable', 'mean', 'feat', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'place', 'South', 'America', 'saga', 'nineteen', 'thirties.Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Armin', 'Muehler-Stahl', 'play', 'wealthy', 'liberal', 'parents', 'two', 'daughters', 'Rosa', 'Clara', 'Del', 'Valle', 'Rosa', 'beautiful', 'older', 'daughter', 'Clara', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'lovely', 'child', 'exceptional', 'psychic', 'gifts', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'part', 'Esteban', 'Trueba', 'impoverished', 'young', 'man', 'love', 'Rosa', 'Vowing', 'make', 'fortune', 'order', 'marry', 'provide', 'comforts', 'accustomed', 'making', 'fortune', 'Rosa', 'however', 'being', 'able', 'marry', 'when', 'poisoned', 'wine', 'intended', 'liberal', 'party', 'father.Esteban', 'broken', 'hearted', 'fortune', 'estancia', 'where', 'sternly', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'peasants', 'who', 'work', 'land', 'obsequiously', 'refer', 'Patron', 'what', 'even', 'women', 'expected', 'result', 'bastard', 'son', 'whom', 'not', 'acknowledge.Esteban', 'spinster', 'sister', 'Ferla', 'well', 'acted', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'lived', 'grim', 'existence', 'city', 'ailing', 'mother', 'whom', 'taken', 'care', 'When', 'mother', 'dies', 'Esteban', 'now', 'bitter', 'lonely', 'man', 'city', 'estancia', 'attend', 'mother', 'funeral', 'doing', 'so', 'spots', 'Clara', 'who', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'ethereally', 'portrayed', 'very', 'talented', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Not', 'wasting', 'moment', 'home', 'luminous', 'mystical', 'already', 'there', 'ask', 'hand', 'marriage', 'happily', 'accepts', 'loved', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'years', 'ago.Clara', 'lovingly', 'sister', 'Ferla', 'bosom', 'househould', 'when', 'move', 'Esteban', 'estancia', 'Ferla', 'blossoms', 'bitter', 'old', 'maid', 'companionable', 'pleasant', 'woman', 'Clara', 'warmth', 'Esteban', 'Clara', 'eventually', 'have', 'child', 'Blanca', 'who', 'up', 'playing', 'Pedro', 'son', 'estancia', 'indigenous', 'indian', 'foreperson', 'When', 'Esteban', 'discovers', 'Blanca', 'away', 'boarding', 'school', 'not', 'want', 'daughter', 'fraternizing', 'peasants.Clara', 'loving', 'pure', 'heart', 'exact', 'opposite', 'When', 'daughter', 'finally', 'up', 'returns', 'home', 'school', 'independent', 'Blanca', 'well', 'played', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'fallen', 'love', 'childhood', 'playmate', 'Pedro', 'passionately', 'portrayed', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Esteban', 'Pedro', 'Pedro', 'liberal', 'inciting', 'peasants', 'unionize', 'demand', 'rights', 'whipping', 'frenzy', 'Patron', 'so', 'Esteban', 'sees', 'Pedro', 'land', 'also', 'Ferla', 'off', 'have', 'unatural', 'feelings', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Possessive', 'fault', 'consumed', 'jealousy', 'Clara', 'Esteban', 'have', 'fight', 'cruelties', 'finally', 'taking', 'Blanca', 'Del', 'Valle', 'family', 'home', 'city.Meanwhile', 'life', 'Blanca', 'pregnant', 'Pedro', 'child', 'believing', 'Pedro', 'been', 'killed', 'father', 'Esteban', 'representing', 'wealthy', 'senator', 'years', 'liberals', 'win', 'power', 'When', 'do', 'however', 'tenure', 'short', 'lived', 'militairy', 'coup', 'up', 'reign', 'terror', 'old', 'sins', 'come', 'home', 'roost', 'Meanwhile', 'Blanca', 'Pedro', 'alive', 'joyously', 'hook', 'up', 'again', 'When', 'Blanca', 'picked', 'up', 'political', 'dissident', 'tortured', 'political', 'views', 'Esteban', 'old', 'broken', 'now', 'just', 'bit', 'player', 'larger', 'arena', 'Too', 'late', 'right', 'wrongs', 'wrongs', 'however', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'righted.This', 'magnificent', 'multi-generational', 'family', 'epic', 'viewer', 'thrall', 'only', 'loosely', 'Isabelle', 'Allende', 'wonderful', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'winner', 'own', 'right', 'something', 'everyone', 'human', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'complex', 'emotions', 'forces', 'events', 'shape', 'one', 'film', 'family', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'ever', 'changing', 'world', 'relationships', 'member', 'family', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'tapestry', 'capturing', 'viewer']",N/A

I loved the book and have read it many times over the years, but the movie was made when I was really young so I never had a chance to pick it up until recently I found the VHS version in my local library. It ended up being a huge disappointment! By the time I figured out they have combined the daughter and granddaughter into one character, I had completely lost interest in the movie. The plot became ridiculous and does not make any sense. Why would Pedro (and they pronounce the name with heavy American accent even though all the characters were supposed to be Chileans!) hide in a basement while his lover was suffering in the prison for him?

So I'm just judging this simply as a ""movie.""I liked the story a lot and the scope of generations, the ups and downs of the characters, and the social and political issues involved.  It's indeed a rich tale and I can imagine how wonderful the novel must be.  For all of the supposed passion in the story, though, I found it curiously unmoving.  I am a big crybaby and have been known to bawl through films while others remain dry-eyed. So I was at a loss for an explanation of why this film failed to move me.  Perhaps it was the casting?  I loved Meryl Streep as the highly sensitive, loving Clara and if anyone did evoke any emotion at all in me, it was Meryl.  Glen Close did a fine job as her unhappy sister-in-law but somehow, even at her death bed, I wasn't much moved.  Perhaps it was the director?  I've never been a fan of Jeremy Irons and although I thought he, too, did a good job, I couldn't muster a lot of feeling for him.  I thought Winona Ryder was horribly miscast---she looked, moved and spoke like a girl who belonged at home in an American shopping mall rather than  at a plantation in South America in the last century,  Anotonio Banderas, a handsome and charming fellow, just wasn't convincing to me as a revolutionary.  Vanessa Redgrave was lovely in her small role and several of the native characters were convincing, notably Esteban, the bastard son of the Irons character.The cinematography is lovely and the whole film is nice to look at.  Again, given the story, the cast and the beauty of the land, it is not clear to me why it failed to produce a more vivid effect.  It could have been an epic but it didn't quite reach that level.

About 400 pages worth is squashed into the film's lean 140 minutes, but it doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing.The book had relied on first person narrative, which lent the sweeping generational and political tumults in a South American country the right touch of personal fervour, and more importantly, a consistent point of view.The film on the other hand falters on this facet, a deficiency that robs the film of its conviction, its soul. The director seemed to have assumed that the pithy story would be enough to keep the audience interested, but it is not. About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I found myself counting minutes.The terrific cast is what ultimately salvages the movie. Meryl Streep in particular is perfect in her depiction of the ethereal, psychic wife of a powerful plantation owner. Jeremy Irons, as her jealous and ruthless husband, has some fantastic moments too but hams it up somewhat when he plays himself as an old man. Yet his torn emotional battle between his family and his political ambitions is so well brought out that one actually relates to his quandary.All in all, although the film waylays something pivotal along the way and of course skimps on being a loyal adaptation, it is surely a lot better than its average rating on Amazon would suggest.

361282,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6303160565,S. Schell,"[3, 6]","""The House of the Spirits"" documents three generations of author Isabel Allende's fictional Trueba family, opening with an extended panorama of the Chilean countryside.  Narration begins with Winona Ryder speaking as her character Blanca, introducing us to the rich and prosperous del Valle family and more specifically to her clairvoyant mother Clara (Streep).The magnitude of Clara's psychic abilities is revealed early on when she predicts the death of her elder sister Rosa (Polo).  Esteban Trueba (Irons), the man intended to marry her, drowns his pain in the backbreaking restoration of his dilapidated hacienda Tr&eacute;s Mariez, neither speaking with or seeing the del Valles over the next ten years.He and his elder sister F&eacute;rula (Close) meet up with them again at the funeral of their mother, the family offering their condolences.  It is here that we see that Clara has grown up, a demure, beautiful and highly reticent young woman.  Upon seeing her for the first time in over a decade, Esteban is entranced and steps inside the del Valle home once more to ask for her hand.  She unabashedly accepts and they are married within days, settling into his now thriving property.Once colonized into his position of power and wealth with his new bride, Esteban becomes an intimidating patriarch - possessive and callous.  Wanting to possess not only Clara's physical body but also her mystic psyche, he sees an obstacle in her affections for F&eacute;rula and banishes her from his property, threatening to kill her if she returns. His menservants receive equally disdainful treatment, their disobedience to their ""p&aacute;tron"" punishable by a severe lashing.  Esteban is especially conscious of Pedro Tercero (Banderas), a fiery radical who rouses the peasants' anger regarding their denied civil liberties.The straw that breaks the camel's back is Blanca's out-of-wedlock pregnancy and the fact that Pedro is the father of her unborn child, the product of a love that has intensified since their childhood.  Pedro goes into hiding, Blanca gives birth to their daughter Alba and Esteban becomes a Senator for the Conservative party.  Shortly after the People's Party wins the election, Chile's political mayhem comes to a head and Esteban's years of bad karma come back at him full swing.The film misrepresents a great deal of what Allende has written in her novel (""La Casa De Los Espir&iacute;tus"" in her native language) and the biggest mistake was allowing director Bille August to pen the screenplay.  People and events have been changed for convenience of the passage of time for which he and his producers could either not fulfill or didn't have the patience for.  If the story's history had been traced correctly, the film would certainly have exceeded a three-hour time length.  Instead of trying to keep a sense of purity to Allende's story, August has miserably chopped it in half by making the despicable Esteban Garc&iacute;a Trueba's son (instead of his grandson) and by having Blanca abducted and tortured by Chilean militants instead of her daughter Alba (which would've pushed the movie ahead another twenty years).  Blanca's twin brothers Jaime and Nicol&aacute;s are completely omitted, along with the mystic Mora Sisters, Amanda, Miguel and every one of Clara's numerous siblings aside from Rosa (Polo, who looks not the least bit maritime).""The House of the Spirits"" presents a highly inaccurate portrayal of the relationship between F&eacute;rula and Esteban. In the book, they were persistently pitted against each other, each vying for Clara's affections.  F&eacute;rula is just as deviant as Esteban in her quest to win Clara's love but August choose to create an inclusive portrait of a helpless victim; he escalates Esteban's cruelty to an unreasonable level and as a result ruins the veritable nature of both characters, giving the audience more reason to despise Esteban and commiserate with F&eacute;rula.  He also fails to observe Blanca's enforced marriage to French Count Jean de Satigny and completely neglects Alba, Blanca's headstrong daughter.All of the actors do an admirable job portraying their characters but with August's butchering of Allende's story and the wonderful character development that one is able to experience by reading her novel, a lot of personality and interest is lost in her three pivotal female characters (Clara, Blanca and Alba).  Next to how we come to know them by reading the novel, their personalities seem a bit flaccid and obscured on screen.  Winona Ryder adheres well to Blanca's aloof qualities but this is still a faulty casting choice. Although she is aesthetically pleasing, she lacks the emotional depth of her co-star and Streep pretty much drowns her out.  Even though I have a profound love and respect for Meryl's work (Out of Africa, The Bridges of Madison County, One True Thing), she doesn't really belong here either; as the numinous Clara del Valle, she just doesn't quite fit the mold.  It's a bit hard to swallow her youthful scenes as a 20-something bride (when she's actually over the hill at 44).  Everyone else is pretty much in the appropriate age bracket and make-up helps to convincingly age them as the timeline stretches on.It's hard to figure out what the heck Glenn Close is doing here.  After smart turns as the manipulative Marquise de Merteuil (Dangerous Liaisons) and spurned lover Alex (Fatal Attraction), perhaps she needed a breather.  If her character had been played correctly (instead of being made to look like her brother's helpless prey), her performance might've been more revered.  Irons (M. Butterfly, Lolita) makes the best of what he has as the stone-cold Esteban, his icy stare and explosive intonation effectively rendered.The real Latinos here are relegated to smaller roles, namely Antonio Banderas as the willful Pedro Tercero and Maria Conchita Alonso as Tr&aacute;nsito Soto.  Appearing here in only his second American film, Banderas is more or less a pretty face to pair with Ryder and doesn't really make much of an impression.  Good thing, too - he didn't really have the ability to flesh out a character until he starred in ""The Mask of Zorro"" five years later.  Alonso is seamless as the sultry harlot Tr&aacute;nsito, her dark luminous eyes and voluptuous figure a perfect match to Allende's descriptions (we're missing the mesmerizing snake tattoo, however).  Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vanessa Redgrave are wasted here, pushed to the background as del Valle heads N&iacute;vea and Severo and Jan Niklas as Jean de Satigny is barely given any screen time, much less a character background.  The strangest casting choice is the eerie Vincent Gallo as Esteban Garc&iacute;a, his ghostly eyes (among other anomalous facial features) and restrained voice giving me the creeps.Overall, this is an adaptation that disappoints on many levels.  Had it been done as a low-budget independent film (with chapters - sorta like a mini-series) with unknown talents gone straight to video, it might've stood a chance.  Distinguished actors and an art house director do not a great movie make.",2,"Distasteful Formula of Love, Politics and the Supernatural",1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,7122,"['House', 'Spirits',

361284,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,6303160565,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[6, 15]","I was so willing to give this movie a chance. I was so willing to spend the entire movie remembering parts of the book that I loved. I was so  disappointed.First off - it's a lousy movie. Vincent Gallo is creepy and  Banderas is a great actor regardless but Jeremy Irons, Glen Close and Meryl  Streep have the Laurence Olivier syndrome, ie. great actors in a bad movie  hamming it up. Winona Ryder is just awful and she hasn't been a decent  actress since Heathers but in this role she's truly horrid as this role  calls for some inner turmoil and frustration and she just kind of whines a  lot.Second - if you read the book you will wonder at how awful they  could make it. The daughter and the granddaughter become one character  which completely undercuts the whole grandfather mellows over time aspect  of the book. Besides that the daughter and the granddaughter are such great  characters that NEITHER should be played by Wynona Ryder much less both of  them. The Meryl Streep character which is mysterious and ethereal in the  book is merely a pain in the movie. The Jeremy Irons character becomes a  charactiture and his change at the end of the movie is completely  unbelievable. The revolutionary leader has a personality and a mission and  in the movie he's merely the pretty boy that Winona Ryder has sex with. The  only character that seems marginally correct is the Vincent Gallo creepy  dictator pawn character and he's even relatively lifeless. And I don't even  remember that awful Glen Close character from the book much less the  confessional scene where Close is getting the priest all hot &amp; bothered  with describing her brother having sex.By the time Vincent Gallo beats  up Winona Ryder or Jeremy Irons beats up Meryl Streep you just wish someone  would come through and beat everyone associated with the movie over and  over again. I would even buy the director's cut if there was an hour of  everyone being beaten including the director and the screenwriter,  ESPECIALLY the director and the screenwriter.",1,Oh the pain the pain,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2034,"['was', 'so', 'willing', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'was', 'so', 'willing', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'remembering', 'parts', 'book', 'loved', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed.First', 'lousy', 'movie', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'creepy', 'Banderas', 'great', 'actor', 'regardless', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Glen', 'Close', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'have', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'syndrome', 'ie', 'great', 'actors', 'bad', 'movie', 'hamming', 'up', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'just', 'awful', ""n't"", 'been', 'decent', 'actress', 'Heathers', 'role', 'truly', 'horrid', 'role', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'frustration', 'just', 'kind', 'whines', 'lot.Second', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'wonder', 'how', 'awful', 'could', 'make', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'become', 'one', 'character', 'completely', 'whole', 'grandfather', 'time', 'aspect', 'book', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'are', 'such', 'great', 'characters', 'NEITHER', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'much', 'less', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'character', 'mysterious', 'ethereal', 'book', 'merely', 'pain', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'charactiture', 'change', 'end', 'movie', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'revolutionary', 'leader', 'personality', 'mission', 'movie', 'merely', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'sex', 'only', 'character', 'marginally', 'correct', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'creepy', 'dictator', 'pawn', 'character', 'even', 'relatively', 'lifeless', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'awful', 'Glen', 'Close', 'character', 'book', 'much', 'less', 'confessional', 'scene', 'where', 'Close', 'getting', 'priest', 'hot', 'amp', 'bothered', 'describing', 'brother', 'having', 'sex.By', 'time', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'up', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'up', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'just', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'come', 'beat', 'everyone', 'associated', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'even', 'buy', 'director', 'cut', 'was', 'hour', 'everyone', 'being', 'beaten', 'including', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'ESPECIALLY', 'director', 'screenwriter']",N/A
