While it may seem slow-moving and at times a bit tedious, the fun is in the details. I tend to notice backgrounds, people's expressions, physical ticks or eccentricities or just plain off-the-wall stuff like bad fashion and even worse interiors. And this film is rife with them all.I think what the film attempts to do is expose the pet funeral industry for what it truly is: a necessary evil for those who aren't satisfied with what their vet would do with a pet's body once little Fi-Fi has passed. I looked up the cemetary in question and it's still in operation and looks even more lovely and finished than it was presented newly finished in the film.The main personalities are fascinating, especially the two sons of the owner, who could not be more different if they tried. One is from the corporate insurance sales world and one just blew in from the beach, the latter being the former's boss which makes for some humorous comparisons. And the Mom and Pop that own the place are a treat, especially juxtapositioned against the lovely California scenery. Other, uh, interesting folks fill in the spaces.An all-around entertaining and engrossing film which I enjoyed immensely.",4,"Unique, Eccentric and Entertaining!",1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1283,"['are', 'fan', 'unusual', 'find', 'humor', 'oddities', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'may', 'seem', 'slow-moving', 'times', 'bit', 'tedious', 'fun', 'details', 'tend', 'notice', 'backgrounds', 'people', 'expressions', 'physical', 'ticks', 'eccentricities', 'just', 'plain', 'off-the-wall', 'stuff', 'bad', 'fashion', 'even', 'worse', 'interiors', 'film', 'rife', 'all.I', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'attempts', 'do', 'expose', 'pet', 'funeral', 'industry', 'what', 'truly', 'necessary', 'evil', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'what', 'vet', 'would', 'do', 'pet', 'body', 'once', 'little', 'Fi-Fi', 'passed', 'looked', 'up', 'cemetary', 'question', 'still', 'operation', 'even', 'more', 'lovely', 'finished', 'was', 'presented', 'newly', 'finished', 'film.The', 'main', 'personalities', 'are', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'two', 'sons', 'owner', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'tried', 'One', 'corporate', 'insurance', 'sales', 'world', 'one', 'just', 'blew', 'beach', 'latter', 'being', 'former', 'boss', 'humorous', 'comparisons', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'own', 'place', 'are', 'treat', 'especially', 'juxtapositioned', 'lovely', 'California', 'scenery', 'Other', 'uh', 'interesting', 'folks', 'fill', 'spaces.An', 'all-around', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'immensely']",Gates of Heaven VHS

It is a mystery after 50 viewings that I have never solved. You can approach this film in a dozen different ways. It just doesn't have a bottom. And you can't decide, no matter how often you've seen it, if it's a comedy or a tragedy.""Werner Herzog, a mentor to Errol Morris, literally ate his shoe in order to see this film get made. Here's how Werner described it: ""It's not a film on pet cemeteries. It's a film on the family behind all that with all their failures and all their dreams and all their dramas. It's the only authentic film on love and emotions in Late Capitalism, and maybe it's the only authentic film on loss of emotions and distortion of feelings and degeneration of feelings. It's a very, very sad film, and very purely done. It's an extremely pure film. And a very mature film.

336768,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6302801095,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[7, 10]","The film has a perverse quality, as if watching someone slowly die, and trying to empathize with it. In that sense, the two films that most closely mirror it are fictive films- Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs Started Small and Tod Browning's Freaks. One might also put it in league with the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest were it not played, or shot, straight. In fact, this is the film that Werner Herzog ate his shoe over. Morris had no money to finance the film and Herzog told him to do it anyway, and promised Morris that if he made a film, Herzog eat a shoe at the premiere, ala Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. The act was subsequently made into the short subject film, Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe.The film's premise is that there are people who will pay thousands of dollars to bury their pets like humans. Ok, I'm a pet lover- a cat lover, but I've never done so. I've never viscerally understood why we bury humans. A corpse is a corpse is a corpse. As long as it is disposed of cleanly, who cares? Yet the film starts off with a disabled old man, Floyd McClure, who tried to start a pet cemetery south of San Francisco, the Foothill Pet Cemetery in Los Altos, because he was haunted by the memories and smells of an animal rendering plant he visited as a youth, as well as the death of his collie as a boy, when it was run over by a car. Manifestly lacking any business sense, the man soon lost his business- as well as did several other investors (one schlemiel lost thirty grand in 1970s cash!), and the animals- four hundred and fifty pets, had to be exhumed and moved to another better pet cemetery, the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park, in Napa Valley- which has designer plots, run by a family of even weirder folk, if possible....The weirdest and most hypnotic person onscreen is an old lady who sits in her home's doorway, and divides the film's halves between McClure and the Harbertses. She is Florence Rasmussen- the poster girl for human strangeness, and she distractedly and digressively paints her tale of woe, and her no good grandson- whom she's going to get money back from, and his whorish ex-wife, whom she calls a `tramp.' What this has to do with dead pets is anyone's guess, although she ends her soliloquy by lamenting the loss of a black kitten and suspecting that a kitty serial killer is on the prowl. She is sort of the addle-brained female equivalent of what Danny Harberts will likely end up as. Yet, despite all that, there is a genuine movement of emotion that the film conjures; as well as some truths- even if as trite as the quote which ends the last paragraph.Perhaps the greatest emotion conveyed is when dumb old Floyd McClure says, `When I turn my back, I don't know you, not truly. But I can turn my back on my little dog, and I know that he's not going to jump on me or bite me; but human beings can't be that way.' And this is why the film is worth watching. It is not even remotely a great film, but it is an interesting document, something that, like a truly great film, such as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, could be sent on a spaceship for aliens to find in a million years, and tell something of what a real human was. The fact that such qualitatively disparate examples of an art form can reach the same level of inner....dare I say it?, truth, is one of those grand ineffables that makes art worth indulging, sort of like the last shot of Gates Of Heaven, of the Harberts' growing dream cemetery at dusk. On and on it just is. Then, like life and dream, it all ends. So, too, humanity.

What makes this documentary so facinating has nothing to do with the actual animals, but rather the people who love and care for them.  As the film progresses, one will realize it is actually a study of human nature and psychology. With the central focus of giving pets a secure resting place, the film incredibly shows human frailty, ambition, and sadness.For those who have never had pets, this film can be hard to relate to.  My family has never owned any pets, but I've had friends who have had pets.  They are very attached to the pets,  and the pets are like family memebers.  One has to watch this movie with an open heart, or they will never understand the feelings of the people in this documentary.  To some of these people, a pet is more of a friend than a human being will ever be, and there is some real truth behind that.People might get different interpertations of what Morris is trying to show here.

336771,A1OVG7RXXZQ4UW,6302801095,"Jonathan Scott ""Songe""","[0, 0]","Roger Ebert once called this movie a masterpiece and called it one of the top ten movies of all time.  With such a glowing review from such a respected critic, I decided to give it a shot.At first, it comes across as quite boring actually.  So, thinking about Ebert's review I chose to pay closer attention.  What I finally decided was that the movie was dealing with how people dealt with the death of a loved one.  These are all real opinions and real personalities.  And, it shows the extent people are willing to go to to defend and honor something that they love.  It is impressive once you realize what you are watching and choose to pay attention.I don't think I would have put as much effort into it had Ebert not given that review.  But, I guess I'm grateful that he did.Does God exist?  Is life eternal?  This movie, in a very deceptive and furtive manner, seemingly, but not really tongue in cheek, worms its way into the debate.  Perhaps it's the seeming humor and seeming over-the-top devotion these owners have for their pets that can get people who normally would consider themselves as atheists, to at least pay attention long enough to feel the owner's love and faith that something will happen after we die.  And, once you've felt it, it's hard to not make it your own opinion as well.What DID make it move?And then, many will realize, that if all of this is how people can feel just about a few animals, how much more can this be applied to humans?  That's when it hits you.  This movie isn't silly, AT ALL.  It isn't quaint at all.  It isn't superficial or kitschish at all.  And the one thing it really isn't, is a movie director's attempt to look at a bunch of country yokels and laugh at them.  It is a full blown attempt to show the value of life, even the smallest and most insignificant, and IMHO, to show that there is an afterlife.I think I agree with Roger Ebert.

The dust jacket of the movie had a quote from Roger Ebert that says ""A Masterpiece...one of the Top Ten Movies of All Time,"" so that set the bar pretty high right from the start. I'd also seen Morris's other movie. ""Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control,"" which I thought was one of the most entertaining films I'd ever seen. So I had every expectation that Ebert's claim would be true.I also usually find that my and Ebert's taste in movies is pretty close. However, I have to say that, although interesting, and even though I lived for many years only about a half hour up highway 280 in Los Altos from where the original cemetery was located, so it even had a local connection and interest for me, this is hardly one of the ten greatest films of all time. The movie has its moments, and you probably can't find a more engaging and sentimental topic for most people. Maybe it helps to be a pet owner, which I'm not. I like animals, but I don't currently own a pet (although I have had a couple of pets in the past).However, there's no doubt this movie struck an incredibly responsive cord with most people, and if you check out the other reviews here, you'll see almost all the other reviewers give it 5 stars.Although not one of the ""top ten Masterpieces"" (yes, the ""M"" was even capitalized in the Ebert quote) I was lead to expect, it's still an interesting, enjoyable film, and worth seeing.",4,Not as good as I'd hoped,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,1435,"['came', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'dust', 'jacket', 'movie', 'had', 'quote', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'A', 'Masterpiece', 'one', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Movies', 'All', 'Time', 'set', 'bar', 'pretty', 'high', 'right', 'start', ""'d"", 'also', 'seen', 'Morris', 'other', 'movie', 'Fast', 'Cheap', 'Out', 'Control', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'expectation', 'Ebert', 'claim', 'would', 'be', 'true.I', 'also', 'usually', 'find', 'Ebert', 'taste', 'movies', 'pretty', 'close', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'interesting', 'even', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'highway', '280', 'Los', 'Altos', 'where', 'original', 'cemetery', 'was', 'located', 'even', 'had', 'local', 'connection', 'interest', 'hardly', 'one', 'ten', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'movie', 'moments', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'more', 'engaging', 'sentimental', 'topic', 'most', 'people', 'Maybe', 'be', 'pet', 'owner', ""'m"", 'not', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'currently', 'own', 'pet', 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'pets', 'past', '.However', 'doubt', 'movie', 'struck', 'incredibly', 'responsive', 'cord', 'most', 'people', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'almost', 'other', 'reviewers', 'give', '5', 'not', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'Masterpieces', 'yes', 'M', 'was', 'even', 'capitalized', 'Ebert', 'quote', 'was', 'lead', 'expect', 'still', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing']",Gates of Heaven VHS
336776,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,6302801095,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[9, 10]","This unique film represents not only the beginning of Earl Morris' career, but the finest look at the American obsession with the treatment and care of our pets.The format is simple; we are introduced to a man whose dream of a pet cemetery has failed. The remains of those animals were sent to another pet cemetery that is flourishing. In between, we meet the owners of both cemeteries and some of the pet owners and hear stories on a variety of subjects. It's hard to categorize this documentary as a comedy or drama since the tone is so straightforward. But that allows ""Gates of Heaven"" to soar above such conventions and reach a level few films ever have.Some of the interviews are quite funny and I think all of us can relate to a scene early in the film when an elderly lady is holding her dog near her face and asking him to sing. Another very bizarre image is the sight of a man player his electric guitar at full blast overlooking the pet cemetery.I was particularly moved by the stories of the two sons of the successful pet cemetery owner. The younger one seems quite lonely living all by himself, yet he seems content while his older brother is in quite a conundrum. Having failed in previous businesses and now behind his sibling at the cemetery, he's still proud of the ""positive mental approach"" he's been taught over the years.The most stunning moment happens midway through the film when another elderly lady sits in her doorway and relates the story of her deceased pet. She quickly shifts to describe her no good son and tells that story in a way that is so natural, yet using words and phrases that Mark Twain would probably admire and be in awe of.The presentation of the movie is full screen, not widescreen. But given how the movie was shot and the type of film used, the viewer is not missing much on the edges. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of extras, such as no interview with Earl Morris. Or even a text background on the making of ""Gates of Heaven"" which would give some enlightenment to the journey the filmmaker took in making this masterpiece.No doubt there will be a expanded or ""Ultimate"" edition DVD released that will include such extras.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[12, 19]","A man with an unsettling resemblance and voice to Elmer Fudd of Loony Tunes fame recounts his trauma of losing his Collie in a car collision. Almost on the verge of tears, this sentimental bovine soul begins his failed quest to create a pet cemetery in Los Altos, California. Legal snafus force the pets to be unearthed and transferred to another cemetery in Napa, which is headed by the real stars of the film, a family of New Age entrepreneurs, including an aged patriarch who wears a straw hat with feminine scarves. He bloviates about the wonders of capitalism and how it fuses with sanctiminious bromides about people and their pets. Then there is his wife who prides the cemetery for being all about ""life and purity."" Her sons, both lazy, vain types, extol their jobs as if they were rocket scientists saving Planet Earth. In particular, the oldest son, Phillip, is a banal narcissist who massages his ego by describing himself as a ""motivational speaker"" with an expertise in psychology. His expertise inspires him to say such gems as ""If you intake negative thoughts, you'll outake negative thoughts. And if you take in postive thoughts, you'll bring out positive thoughts. . . . If you want to get real complex, there's an inbetween, a mix of positive and negative."" Then with a look of self-regard, he adds, ""This is what we call the gray area."" He then describes his ""dangerous mission,"" memorizing animal hospitals where he, a self-described ""transportation engineer,"" picks up dead pets. Phillip discusses the ""fear"" of having to know the map routes of these animal hospitals. The self-aggrandizement and exaggerated importance he attaches to his lowly job makes for comedy that makes you cringe.At times I feel guilty for laughing at these vain exploiters of those who are grieving over their dead dogs and cats, but they bloviate on and on and sort of dig themselves into a hole. You have to wonder if they have gained any wisdom in the last twenty years or so when this film was made, so that they can laugh at themselves.In many ways, this documentary is even more poignant and outrageous than the film Best in Show.",5,Human Pathos and Vanity Make for a Comedy Cocktail,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,2134,"['man', 'unsettling', 'resemblance', 'voice', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'Loony', 'Tunes', 'fame', 'trauma', 'losing', 'Collie', 'car', 'collision', 'verge', 'tears', 'sentimental', 'bovine', 'soul', 'failed', 'quest', 'create', 'pet', 'cemetery', 'Los', 'Altos', 'California', 'Legal', 'snafus', 'force', 'pets', 'be', 'unearthed', 'transferred', 'cemetery', 'Napa', 'headed', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'family', 'New', 'Age', 'entrepreneurs', 'including', 'aged', 'patriarch', 'who', 'straw', 'hat', 'feminine', 'scarves', 'wonders', 'capitalism', 'how', 'sanctiminious', 'bromides', 'people', 'pets', 'Then', 'wife', 'who', 'cemetery', 'being', 'life', 'purity', 'sons', 'lazy', 'vain', 'types', 'extol', 'jobs', 'were', 'rocket', 'scientists', 'saving', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'particular', 'oldest', 'son', 'Phillip', 'banal', 'narcissist', 'who', 'ego', 'describing', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'expertise', 'psychology', 'expertise', 'say', 'such', 'gems', 'intake', 'negative', 'thoughts', ""'ll"", 'outake', 'negative', 'thoughts', 'take', 'postive', 'thoughts', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'out', 'positive', 'thoughts', 'want', 'get', 'real', 'complex', 'inbetween', 'mix', 'positive', 'negative', 'Then', 'look', 'self-regard', 'what', 'call', 'gray', 'area', 'then', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'memorizing', 'animal', 'hospitals', 'where', 'self-described', 'transportation', 'engineer', 'up', 'dead', 'pets', 'Phillip', 'fear', 'having', 'know', 'map', 'routes', 'animal', 'hospitals', 'self-aggrandizement', 'exaggerated', 'importance', 'lowly', 'job', 'comedy', 'cringe.At', 'times', 'feel', 'guilty', 'laughing', 'vain', 'exploiters', 'who', 'are', 'grieving', 'dead', 'dogs', 'cats', 'bloviate', 'sort', 'dig', 'hole', 'have', 'wonder', 'have', 'gained', 'wisdom', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'can', 'laugh', 'themselves.In', 'many', 'ways', 'documentary', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'outrageous', 'film', 'Best', 'Show']",Gates of Heaven VHS

But the real subject is the American attitude toward success and death.  Success is the great American obsession - how to get it, how to look like you have it, how to show it off.  And death is the great American taboo.  Success for the business backers of the first cemetery meant burying several animals per grave and other nasty practices.  For the second cemetery, it means, as the father of the bunch says, using ""sound business practices.""  The cemetery is his dream, and he can talk of nothing else.  His eldest son's dream of success is very different - he wants to be a singer-songwriter and have his songs be listened to by millions of people, but he's pretty much given it up.  The older son, Phillip, is the one most obviously obsessed with success.  He seems himself as a motivational speaker, and he constantly bloviates about how the principles of success can be applied to his tasks, including picking up the dead animals from the vets' offices and burying them.  Everyone speaks in an amazingly American idiom.  It is so true to life.  I've never heard a scripted movie that presented even a fraction of the number of American voices as this documentary.The other subject of course is death.  Americans don't like to talk about death and like to hide it.  The rendering plant owner is almost like a stand up comedian in that he talks about rendering zoo animals like it's a joke - touching the taboo and making people laugh is key for stand up.  But it isn't funny, although he thinks it is. We see other people, sometimes pet owners, trying to come to terms with death, but not wanting to talk about it.  They give advice.  They show pictures.  They have their dogs sing with them.  The younger son, the singer-songwriter, is practical - he notes that you've got to dig the right sized hole - not too big but not so small you can't fit it in. The father has his own sort of religion that says that pets will be waiting for their owners in heaven.  Here, he's connected the two poles of the movie - success and death, as such a belief not only would comfort bereaved pet owners, but make them more willing to spend money at his pet cemetery.
