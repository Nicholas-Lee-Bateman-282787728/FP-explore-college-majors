Older viewers will ogle Jakes GTO with duel-carb air scoop hood. Good writing that brings out a crazy character cast. Beautiful St. John's filmed setting is a thrill in itself. 3 generations of Doyles makes this fun viewing for teens to retirees.If viewers like this set that aired in 2010 as much as I did, leave reviews.
