1680372,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00GSBMNOQ,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","This was a movie I settled in to watch reluctantly, and with no pre-knowledge of the back story (""inspired by true events"", which always sounds like an opportunity to play fast and loose with the facts).The movie gets off to a rather choppy start, as it time shifts between present-day England (where journalist Martin Sixsmith has just lost his job under somewhat unclear circumstances), and early 1950s Ireland (where teenager Philomena Lee becomes an unwed mother whose baby boy, Anthony --and fate-- are literally delivered into the hands of the Catholic nuns of the Sean Ross Abbye in Rosecrea, Ireland). As the movie begins, Philomena is unburdening her long-held secret of her first child's birth at Roscrea to her adult daughter, Jane, and confessing her 50-year old wish to discover his fate. Shortly afterwards, Jane pitches the possible ""human interest"" story to the the floudering, jaded Martin.The results include Martin and Philomena's travels together to Rosecrae and eventually, the United States as leads to her Anthony's fate alternately appear and evaporate. Along the way, Martin and Philomena are forced to find their way across gulfs of faith, age, culture and education as the they explore truths about themselves.Mostly this is done artfully. And when it turns out that her son was a closeted gay man serving in the highest ranks of two Republican White Houses whose life was claimed by AIDS, the movie provides just enough context about those administrations' views to clarify for younger viewers why this might be problematic for those in the middle of it.  Similarly, while some might claim this movie has an anti-Catholic agenda, this was not my take-away. Quite the contrary, I'd argue Philomena's steadfast insistence on forgiving the narrow views of the morality of unwed motherhood is in fact an argument for the strength of faith instilled in her.There's no shortage of online debate about the complete veracity of this movie. I'll leave that to others, and leave those without preconceptions about either homosexuality or Catholicism to watch this movie and make reach threir own conclusions. Nobody but the most cynical or hardened of viewers can watch the final minutes of this movie --and the missed opportunities for mother and son to connect again-- and be unmoved.Even with the addition of dramatic license, far better than mainstream formulaic offerings, and is well worth the time invested in watching.",4,"Interesting examination of religious, generational, cultural issues across the Atlantic...",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,2444,"['was', 'movie', 'settled', 'watch', 'reluctantly', 'pre-knowledge', 'back', 'story', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'always', 'opportunity', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'facts', '.The', 'movie', 'off', 'rather', 'choppy', 'start', 'time', 'shifts', 'present-day', 'England', 'where', 'journalist', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'just', 'lost', 'job', 'somewhat', 'unclear', 'circumstances', 'early', '1950s', 'Ireland', 'where', 'teenager', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'unwed', 'mother', 'baby', 'boy', 'Anthony', 'fate', 'are', 'literally', 'delivered', 'hands', 'Catholic', 'nuns', 'Sean', 'Ross', 'Abbye', 'Rosecrea', 'Ireland', 'movie', 'Philomena', 'unburdening', 'long-held', 'secret', 'first', 'child', 'birth', 'Roscrea', 'adult', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'confessing', '50-year', 'old', 'wish', 'discover', 'fate', 'Shortly', 'afterwards', 'Jane', 'possible', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'floudering', 'jaded', 'Martin.The', 'results', 'include', 'Martin', 'Philomena', 'travels', 'together', 'Rosecrae', 'eventually', 'United', 'States', 'leads', 'Anthony', 'fate', 'alternately', 'appear', 'evaporate', 'way', 'Martin', 'Philomena', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'way', 'gulfs', 'faith', 'age', 'culture', 'education', 'explore', 'truths', 'themselves.Mostly', 'done', 'artfully', 'when', 'out', 'son', 'was', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'serving', 'highest', 'ranks', 'two', 'Republican', 'White', 'Houses', 'life', 'was', 'claimed', 'AIDS', 'movie', 'just', 'enough', 'context', 'administrations', 'views', 'clarify', 'younger', 'viewers', 'why', 'might', 'be', 'problematic', 'middle', 'Similarly', 'might', 'claim', 'movie', 'anti-Catholic', 'agenda', 'was', 'not', 'take-away', 'contrary', ""'d"", 'argue', 'Philomena', 'steadfast', 'insistence', 'forgiving', 'narrow', 'views', 'morality', 'unwed', 'motherhood', 'fact', 'argument', 'strength', 'faith', 'instilled', 'her.There', 'shortage', 'online', 'debate', 'complete', 'veracity', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'others', 'leave', 'preconceptions', 'homosexuality', 'Catholicism', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'reach', 'threir', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Nobody', 'most', 'cynical', 'hardened', 'viewers', 'can', 'watch', 'final', 'minutes', 'movie', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'mother', 'son', 'connect', 'again', 'be', 'unmoved.Even', 'addition', 'dramatic', 'license', 'far', 'better', 'mainstream', 'formulaic', 'offerings', 'well', 'time', 'invested', 'watching']",N/A

1680375,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B00GSBMNOQ,albarino,"[48, 99]","No doubt, this somewhat fictionalized version of a true story is an engaging cinematic experience.Problem is that it leaves the impression that the Irish nuns were solely cruel and insensitive. Investigative reporting by Britian's The Guardian uncovered a different history from the screenplay. I quote an article from 11/11/13.""The Catholic Church doesn't come out of this story well however you slice it, but in the book its cruelty seems to be largely in the past [the 1950s - sixty years ago]. 'The nuns were lovely,' writes the real Sixsmith, after visiting Roscrea with Philomena. He describes the mother superior as 'a friendly, educated woman ... who had devoted her life to the care of disadvantaged and disabled people.' This doesn't come across at all in the film. Furthermore, the film-makers have resuscitated Sister Hildegarde (who in real life died in 1995 -- nearly 20 years ago, long BEFORE Sixsmith's visit) to act as the principal villain and embodiment of all the Catholic Church's most vicious tendencies. This makes for a dynamic and gripping screen story, but it's harsh on the real Sister Hildegarde. Judging by the book, she may well have been a tough old bird - but the film goes a good deal further, especially towards the end, and some modern Irish nuns have understandably been upset.""In fact, responsibility for the Magdalene Laundries and the appalling privations they imposed on women and children is hardly limited to one person or even one institution. Following a long public campaign, the ***Irish government*** finally apologised for its role in the Magdalene system this year. Though the film version of Philomena might have picked unfairly on Hildegarde to be its [principal] villain, its fury and grief over what happened to the Magdalene victims is undoubtedly justified.""Verdict:  Philomena is a captivating and deeply affecting account of one family's trauma, but it really has it in for nuns.""Further, some additional context is important. In the 1950s Ireland was virtually a 3rd world country, and this held true into the 1970s. It had little of the social infrastructure that 21st century Ireland now has. Moreover, it was a poor country and poverty corrodes life and social institutions, even Catholic ones. Further, the sort of reforms that the Catholic Church needed were promulgated a decade after Philomena's experience, i.e. Vatican II, and these reforms are ongoing. Finally, in 1951 when Philomena encountered the nuns, the current Pope Francis was a 15 year old Argentinian janitor. He joined the Jesuits in 1958, when Philomena's son was 7. Francis is also three years younger than Philomena ---- AND --- he brushed aside the Vatican gatekeepers to give her (and Coogan!) an audience in Rome recently, for which she was grateful. I cite these statistics to give readers a sense of the great period of time we are dealing with and the big changes that have happened since 1951.Some more context: socially engaged, issues-oriented films don't exist in a vacuum. Catholic spokesmen, lay AND religious, rightly point to a current climate of hostility to the Church from ""a media and academic culture that propagates skepticism and even cynicism regarding the message of the church,"" notes Rev. Robert P. Imbelli, professor of theology, Boston University. While the Catholic Church is due honest criticisms for its failures (priestly sexual abuse), this hostile culture doesn't stop at honest criticism. Philomena director Stephen Frears, a gifted filmmaker, is part of that hostile culture, and therefore Philmena is not an objective portrayal of the historical events he interprets in his film. It is an artistic work with a contemporary critical agenda -- projected from 1951 into 2013 -- a 60 year span. Many viewers express indignation at Philomena's hurtful treatment, but such indignation coming from 2013/14 is anachronistic -- imposing a contemporary ""enlightened view"" onto very different circumstances from 60 years ago. From the distance of time and space, this is an easy (and lazy) accusation to make.So Albarino says, by all means, enjoy the film as engaged cinematic art, but keep in mind that it takes some liberties with the actual events, persons and their outcomes. And I do note that the cinematic Philomena appears more forgiving of the old church than Sixsmith -- but then he's a cynic and is played by one.",2,An agenda that unfairly misrepresents the nuns,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,4382,"['doubt', 'somewhat', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'true', 'story', 'engaging', 'cinematic', 'experience.Problem', 'impression', 'Irish', 'nuns', 'were', 'solely', 'cruel', 'insensitive', 'Investigative', 'reporting', 'Britian', 'Guardian', 'uncovered', 'different', 'history', 'screenplay', 'quote', 'article', '11/11/13', 'Catholic', 'Church', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'story', 'well', 'however', 'slice', 'book', 'cruelty', 'be', 'largely', 'past', '[', '1950s', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', ']', 'nuns', 'were', 'lovely', 'real', 'Sixsmith', 'visiting', 'Roscrea', 'Philomena', 'mother', 'superior', 'friendly', 'educated', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'devoted', 'life', 'care', 'disadvantaged', 'disabled', 'people', ""n't"", 'come', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'film-makers', 'have', 'resuscitated', 'Sister', 'Hildegarde', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'died', '1995', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'long', 'Sixsmith', 'visit', 'act', 'principal', 'villain', 'embodiment', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'most', 'vicious', 'tendencies', 'dynamic', 'gripping', 'screen', 'story', 'harsh', 'real', 'Sister', 'Hildegarde', 'Judging', 'book', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'old', 'bird', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'further', 'especially', 'end', 'modern', 'Irish', 'nuns', 'have', 'understandably', 'been', 'upset', 'fact', 'responsibility', 'Magdalene', 'Laundries', 'appalling', 'privations', 'imposed', 'women', 'children', 'hardly', 'limited', 'one', 'person', 'even', 'one', 'institution', 'Following', 'long', 'public', 'campaign', '***Irish', 'government***', 'finally', 'apologised', 'role', 'Magdalene', 'system', 'year', 'film', 'version', 'Philomena', 'might', 'have', 'picked', 'unfairly', 'Hildegarde', 'be', '[', 'principal', ']', 'villain', 'fury', 'grief', 'what', 'happened', 'Magdalene', 'victims', 'undoubtedly', 'justified', 'Verdict', 'Philomena', 'captivating', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'account', 'one', 'family', 'trauma', 'really', 'nuns', 'Further', 'additional', 'context', 'important', '1950s', 'Ireland', 'was', 'virtually', '3rd', 'world', 'country', 'held', 'true', '1970s', 'had', 'little', 'social', 'infrastructure', '21st', 'century', 'Ireland', 'now', 'Moreover', 'was', 'poor', 'country', 'poverty', 'corrodes', 'life', 'social', 'institutions', 'even', 'Catholic', 'ones', 'Further', 'sort', 'reforms', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'needed', 'were', 'promulgated', 'decade', 'Philomena', 'experience', 'i.e', 'Vatican', 'II', 'reforms', 'are', 'ongoing', 'Finally', '1951', 'when', 'Philomena', 'encountered', 'nuns', 'current', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'was', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Argentinian', 'janitor', 'joined', 'Jesuits', '1958', 'when', 'Philomena', 'son', 'was', '7', 'Francis', 'also', 'three', 'years', 'younger', 'Philomena', 'brushed', 'aside', 'Vatican', 'gatekeepers', 'give', 'Coogan', 'audience', 'Rome', 'recently', 'was', 'grateful', 'cite', 'statistics', 'give', 'readers', 'sense', 'great', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'dealing', 'big', 'changes', 'have', 'happened', '1951.Some', 'more', 'context', 'socially', 'engaged', 'issues-oriented', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'vacuum', 'Catholic', 'spokesmen', 'lay', 'AND', 'religious', 'rightly', 'point', 'current', 'climate', 'hostility', 'Church', 'media', 'academic', 'culture', 'skepticism', 'even', 'cynicism', 'regarding', 'message', 'church', 'Rev', 'Robert', 'P.', 'Imbelli', 'professor', 'theology', 'Boston', 'University', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'due', 'honest', 'criticisms', 'failures', 'priestly', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'hostile', 'culture', ""n't"", 'stop', 'honest', 'criticism', 'Philomena', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'gifted', 'filmmaker', 'part', 'hostile', 'culture', 'therefore', 'Philmena', 'not', 'objective', 'portrayal', 'historical', 'events', 'film', 'artistic', 'work', 'contemporary', 'critical', 'agenda', 'projected', '1951', '2013', '60', 'year', 'span', 'Many', 'viewers', 'express', 'indignation', 'Philomena', 'hurtful', 'treatment', 'such', 'indignation', 'coming', '2013/14', 'anachronistic', 'imposing', 'contemporary', 'enlightened', 'view', 'very', 'different', 'circumstances', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'distance', 'time', 'space', 'easy', 'lazy', 'accusation', 'make.So', 'Albarino', 'means', 'enjoy', 'film', 'engaged', 'cinematic', 'art', 'keep', 'mind', 'liberties', 'actual', 'events', 'persons', 'outcomes', 'do', 'note', 'cinematic', 'Philomena', 'more', 'forgiving', 'old', 'church', 'Sixsmith', 'then', 'cynic', 'played', 'one']",N/A

It was certainly an outstanding and well made film. But this sort of quiet movie rarely makes the cut to the nomination list. As others have said, it's based on a true story, beginning with the birth of a boy by an unwed girl, Philomena, in an Irish institution run by questionable nuns. What the nuns do is unconscionable and unbelievably cruel, both when the boy is a toddler and later when the boy is a man. You could almost say that what they did is downright evil..  I admit I cried during the movie. It was hard not to. As a woman, I could relate to Philomena. But I also laughed. There's quite a bit of humor in the movie. Judi Dench is superb. Steve Coogan is awesome in this film. He strikes the right note between being superficially caring and being overly sentimental. He shows a lot of emotion in his face and eyes. His heart truly breaks at one point.  (And he's not hard to look at, either.)If you want to know more about the nuns' institution, you can do an internet search of the Magdalene Laundries. It's unbelievable what Ireland did to young (and older) girls and women for years, and for profit.

1680452,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00GSBMNOQ,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 1]","A bittersweet tale of a mother&#8217;s search for a loved one from her past forms the core of Philomena, a real life semibiography of atonement and forgiveness amid ignorance and the passage of time.  As directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, My Beautiful Laundrette) from a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Lost Child of Philomena Lee&#8221;, it features impressive acting and an affecting story.Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is an unemployed news writer in Britain who is searching for direction in his life.  At the same time, an elderly woman, Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), prays in church and commemorates an anniversary of the pain and loss of her illegitimate son. She recalls the distant memories of working at an abbey in Ireland and being forced to give her young boy for adoption.  Her plight makes its way to Sixsmith who at first is not interested in human interest stories, but Philomena&#8217;s anguish kindles a curiosity within Sixsmith and eventually grows into a crusade that has the support of a publisher.  Stymied by false leads and lost records, Philomena&#8217;s desperate search for her adult son leads to a revelation and the truth despite the dogmatic doctrines of a holy institution.Simultaneously a love story of a mother for her child and an investigative mystery, this is essentially a two person play, in which Philomena and Martin are contrasts in personality and background-she has a navety about her while he is a born cynic.  That she must experience a full spectrum of emotions during her journey from shame to anticipation to despondency contrasts with Martin&#8217;s determination, anger, and frustration.As expected, Dench (Skyfall, Notes on a Scandal) excels in the sensitive role of an older woman anxious to reconnect with her son. She even gets the nuances and behavior of a woman who has had a sheltered, broken life and lacks the sophistication and social graces of normalcy. This detail is nice texture to her character.  Like the sole photograph she has of her son, she clings to memories and hopes of redemption.  Coogan is quite convincing as the determined reporter, quite a contrast to his comedic roots in British television and film.There is liberal use of flashbacks to show Philomena&#8217;s life as a teenage girl.  Sometimes dredging old memories can cause great pain not only for Philomena, but for other people who hold clues to her son&#8217;s whereabouts.  What become of him?  What kind of relationships and profession did he have in life?  And perhaps, most importantly, did he ever wonder about his birth mother?The film shows how life can be a series of events punctuated by remarkable links and coincidences particularly in one revelatory moment that serves as a remarkable thread that binds the principals together.  Some antiquated themes recall the stigma of being an unmarried mother and the practice of adopting illegitimate children through the church.  In some ways this film is the flip side to The Cider House Rules.It calls into question how much an institution like the Catholic Church may or may not have been  complicit in the knowledge or whereabouts of her son.  It seems too obvious to place responsibility and condemn the Catholic Church, the very foundation of faith, and its nuns as villains.  In fact you wish you could learn much more about the motives and thinking of the older nuns and countless other nameless victims that passed through the abbey; Philomena is but one story.  What about Philomena&#8217;s life beyond the abbey? We see that she also has a grown daughter, and yet we don&#8217;t have those details.After all that has transpired, the detective work, and globetrotting from Europe to the United States, there is only the love between a mother and her son.  In the end, a mother&#8217;s hope and a reporter&#8217;s quest become a heartfelt search for the truth, a truth born of love that transcends time.",4,A Mother&#8217;s Redemption in PHILOMENA,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,3962,"['bittersweet', 'tale', 'mother', '8217', 'search', 'loved', 'one', 'past', 'forms', 'core', 'Philomena', 'real', 'life', 'semibiography', 'atonement', 'forgiveness', 'ignorance', 'passage', 'time', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'Queen', 'My', 'Beautiful', 'Laundrette', 'screenplay', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Jeff', 'Pope', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', '8217', 'book', '8220', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Philomena', 'Lee', '8221', 'impressive', 'acting', 'affecting', 'story.Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'unemployed', 'news', 'writer', 'Britain', 'who', 'searching', 'direction', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'church', 'anniversary', 'pain', 'loss', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'distant', 'memories', 'working', 'abbey', 'Ireland', 'being', 'forced', 'give', 'young', 'boy', 'adoption', 'plight', 'way', 'Sixsmith', 'who', 'first', 'not', 'interested', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'Philomena', '8217', 'anguish', 'kindles', 'curiosity', 'Sixsmith', 'eventually', 'crusade', 'support', 'publisher', 'Stymied', 'false', 'leads', 'lost', 'records', 'Philomena', '8217', 's', 'desperate', 'search', 'adult', 'son', 'revelation', 'truth', 'dogmatic', 'doctrines', 'holy', 'institution.Simultaneously', 'love', 'story', 'mother', 'child', 'investigative', 'mystery', 'essentially', 'two', 'person', 'play', 'Philomena', 'Martin', 'are', 'contrasts', 'personality', 'background-she', 'navety', 'born', 'cynic', 'must', 'experience', 'full', 'spectrum', 'emotions', 'journey', 'shame', 'anticipation', 'despondency', 'contrasts', 'Martin', '8217', 'determination', 'anger', 'frustration.As', 'expected', 'Dench', 'Skyfall', 'Scandal', 'excels', 'sensitive', 'role', 'older', 'woman', 'anxious', 'reconnect', 'son', 'even', 'nuances', 'behavior', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'sheltered', 'broken', 'life', 'sophistication', 'social', 'graces', 'normalcy', 'detail', 'nice', 'texture', 'character', 'sole', 'photograph', 'son', 'memories', 'hopes', 'redemption', 'Coogan', 'quite', 'convincing', 'determined', 'reporter', 'quite', 'contrast', 'comedic', 'roots', 'British', 'television', 'film.There', 'liberal', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'Philomena', '8217', 's', 'life', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Sometimes', 'dredging', 'old', 'memories', 'can', 'cause', 'great', 'pain', 'not', 'only', 'Philomena', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'hold', 'clues', 'son', '8217', 'whereabouts', 'What', 'become', 'What', 'kind', 'relationships', 'profession', 'did', 'have', 'life', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'did', 'ever', 'wonder', 'birth', 'mother', 'film', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'series', 'events', 'punctuated', 'remarkable', 'links', 'coincidences', 'particularly', 'one', 'revelatory', 'moment', 'remarkable', 'thread', 'principals', 'together', 'antiquated', 'themes', 'recall', 'stigma', 'being', 'unmarried', 'mother', 'practice', 'adopting', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'church', 'ways', 'film', 'flip', 'side', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules.It', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'institution', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'complicit', 'knowledge', 'whereabouts', 'son', 'too', 'obvious', 'place', 'responsibility', 'condemn', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'very', 'foundation', 'faith', 'nuns', 'villains', 'fact', 'wish', 'could', 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'motives', 'thinking', 'older', 'nuns', 'countless', 'other', 'nameless', 'victims', 'passed', 'abbey', 'Philomena', 'one', 'story', 'What', 'Philomena', '8217', 's', 'life', 'abbey', 'see', 'also', 'grown', 'daughter', 'yet', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'details.After', 'transpired', 'detective', 'work', 'globetrotting', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'only', 'love', 'mother', 'son', 'end', 'mother', '8217', 'hope', 'reporter', '8217', 'quest', 'become', 'heartfelt', 'search', 'truth', 'truth', 'born', 'love', 'time']",N/A

1680459,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00GSBMNOQ,Darren,"[2, 2]","It's not responsible, let alone fair, to paint an entire religious sect with one brush, or even to paint one geographical area of that sect with one brush, but &#34;Philomena&#34; pretty much succeeds in convincing American viewers of the perfidy of the Irish Catholic Church, an institution whose resume includes child sexual abuse cover-ups and, as featured here, the &#34;Magdalene Laundries&#34; of the last century, in which compromised young women were walled up against their will to serve as slave labor for the laundry business of Ireland's nunneries.  If the women survived the ignorant medical treatment during the childbirth process, they were allowed brief visitations with their own children on site until rich couples (mostly Americans, as it turned out) arrived to quite literally buy the little tykes.  The exquisite cruelty -- cruelty by design, doubtless -- is almost beyond comprehension, in terms of such happenings occurring anywhere in Western civilization in the 20th century after the Second World War.  One expects such stories from places like Sudan, the Caucasian steppes, the Middle-East desert, or other so-called &#34;Third World&#34; garden spots, but the story &#34;Philomena&#34; describes occurred in Ireland.  In the 19 (not 18) 50s.  The fuzzy and cheerful home of leprechauns, the Guinness Brewery, and other touristy delights.  The shame will remain until the Magdalene orphans and their mothers are all finally buried, at which time the whole sorry affair will become yet another frowny-faced asterisk pointing to a footnote in the history of an institution that dares to wonder why so many people (in the West, at least) have either left the flock entirely or define themselves as &#34;lapsed&#34;.Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, the little old Irish lady determined to find her long-lost son, is dependably excellent.  Her character may be defined as a &#34;cup is half-full&#34; type of person, while her foil, Steve Coogan as journalist and inept politico Martin Sixsmith, may be defined as a &#34;cup is half-empty&#34; type of person.  What this movie makes clear is that to get anything done or even to find out anything in this world, you need both types of people, preferably working together.  A can-do, forgiving attitude can (and will, and is) taken advantage of by the malignant elements in the world; a smooth, sophisticated cynicism is merely insufferable without a cause to reignite passionate idealism.  And boy, does Coogan ever need a cause in this movie.  But once he finds it and believes in it, he's a bulldog.  Without spoiling anything, we're far more sympathetic to his stance during the movie's climactic confrontation than we are to Dench's, but it helps to remember that the scene might not take place without Dench's diplomatic entree into the nunnery in the first place.Some nitpicks: I wonder if director Stephen Frears and Coogan (who also wrote the co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope) is too willing to settle for scene construction that turns some of the dialogue into crowd-pleasing middle-brow bromides (&#34;That's hard for me! -- to say, 'I forgive you&#34;, etc.).  Dench worried about the obesity of Americans because of portion-sizes at restaurants is also a groaner, which goes hand-in-hand with the whole fish-out-of-water thing that comes with an elderly Irish lady traveling in our fair land.  &#34;We have no Mexicans where I come from,&#34; she tells the short-order cook -- that sort of thing.  I'm probably in the minority here, but I would've preferred that Frears and the writers left out all attempts at crowd-pleasing humor, instead mining the humor organically from the particularities of the characters themselves.  For instance, it's a bit funnier when Coogan has to endure Dench's recounting of every plot-point in her favorite romance novels -- now that's the real-life stuff.  We also probably didn't require the prerequisite Spiritual Argument between the two protagonists that comes straight out of Screenplay Cliches 101.But, all in all?  Engaging, enraging, and well worth the investment of your time.

Surprisingly, there is much humor in the film, anger about what had been done to Philomena with much understanding and forgiveness.(spoils below)The story of Philomena begins in Ireland in 1952 when she becomes pregnant as a teenager.  Although it is not shown in the film, her family puts her in a convent. At no time are we aware of any feelings on the part of her family toward her. Apparently, she was cast out because of her pregnancy. Philomena must work in the convent for four years, performing backbreaking labor in the convent laundry, seven days a week. Philomena has a son, who she names Anthony and the nuns force her to sign a document relinquishing her parental rights and agree to never attempt to contact her son. Anthony is adopted, along with a girl, by an American couple for a ten hefty fee of $1,000.The story of the film is Philomen&#8217;s search for her son fifty years later. She is joined by journalist Martin Sixsmith, who has been forced to resign from his job.  Martin is looking for something to do and agrees to write a book about Philomena&#8217;s quest to find her son. The humor of the film comes from the relationship between Martin and Philomena. She loved to read romance novels and recount the plots to Martin, who would is more into Shakespeare. For years, Philomena has visited the convent hoping that she could persuade the nuns to allow her to have the location of her son. The adoption records have been destroyed in a fire but as Martin discovers they were burned by the nuns themselves. The search for her son takes Philomena and Martin to Washington D. C. but, unknown to her, Philomena&#8217;s son has been searching for her.(end of spoilers)Comedian Steve Coogan is the driving force behind the film, having read the book by Martin Sixsmith and realized the screen possibilities. Coogan co-authored the screen play with Sixsmith, as well as producing the film and is perfect in portraying Sixsmith on screen. Dame Judy Dench is wonderful as Philomena, portraying her as a strong and determined woman who is strong in her Catholic faith, remaining conflicted over being forced to give up her son.

1680462,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00GSBMNOQ,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","As a practicing Roman Catholic I approached this film with a little trepidation cautious that it may be another example of Hollywood bashing organized religion.  That said I am also aware of the child abuse scandal that was not only exposed in my own diocese but others throughout the U.S.  After a lot of soul searching you come to the conclusion that our Church not only encompasses imperfect clergy but parishioners searching for a way to lead their lives the way Christ would.  Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) is a woman at the twilight of her life who has gained peace and the ability to forgive notably the Sacred Heart sisters who sold her son for adoption.  When the film begins Philomena is a woman looking for closure in her life wanting to find out what happened to the toddler son taken from her before she had a chance to grow as a woman and a mother.  She is assisted in an odyssey that will take her from England to Ireland to America by a recently sacked BBC investigative journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who is looking for a human interest story that will get him back in the game.  Sixsmith is the polar opposite of Philomena not only a lapsed Catholic but an embittered cynic.  Their journey together is not only a fact finding one but one where Sixsmith reconnects with his humanity under the positive tutelage of Philomena which allows for his personal growth.  ""Philomena"" will wring your emotions like few films can.  Dench's work is one of great nuance and warmth.  She and Coogan have great chemistry that brings out the best out of each performer.

It also has the advantage of being closely based on a true story involving some fairly prominent political figures. While it may not have the heavily dramatic twists and turns that many desire, there is well-earned surprise and revelation here. Judi Dench is her usual great in the lead role, and Steven Coogan is also most convincing as Martin Sixsmith, a tabloid journalist who discovers that ""silly human interest stories"" for ""weak-minded"" people can involve matters that any intelligent person should care about. Outstanding acting by many of the supporting cast as well, a wonderfully rich script, and expert cinematography that gives us some stunning views of rural Ireland.There is an interesting mesh of somber, often disturbing back-story of Philomena's adolescence and pregnancy in an Irish orphanage during the 1950s and more upbeat yet moving front-story of her search for the son she hasn't seen in 50 years.

She gave birth to a boy, Anthony, in a country convent at Roscrea, Tipperary, in 1952.  After he turned three, Anthony was adopted by an American couple, in return for a handsome fee. Philomena, meanwhile, was forced to perform backbreaking labor for three years to pay for her room and board.Many years go by, and Philomena is now elderly with a family of her own. She and Martin Sixsmith team up to learn the truth about what became of Anthony after he left Ireland.  In return for his help, Martin plans to write an expos&eacute; revealing the church's cruelty to unwed mothers during the fifties and sixties. The script, which is ""inspired by true events,"" takes liberties with the facts, presumably to make the film more poignant and powerful.  Still, Frears, who directs with great sensitivity, and the two screenwriters, Steve Coogan (who portrays Sixsmith) and Jeff Pope, beautifully capture Philomena's spirit.  Viewers grow to care about this courageous and determined individual and hope that she can reconnect with her grown-up son.""Philomena"" moves us without being overly sentimental.  Judi Dench delivers her usual spot-on performance, portraying Lee as a plain-spoken person with a backbone of steel.  She chides Sixsmith when he behaves rudely, but she refuses to take no for an answer when someone stonewalls her.  Coogan and Dench balance one another out perfectly. She is good-hearted, gracious, and a devout Catholic; he is brash, ill- mannered, and an avowed atheist.  ""Philomena"" has moments of gentle humor, but Frears and Coogan also touch on serious themes: the role of religion in society; a mother's enduring love for her child; and one's need for closure, especially after having suffered a terrible loss. Further enhancing the film are its fine cinematography and lovely, understated score. In addition to Dench and Coogan, kudos go to Sophie Kennedy Clark as the anguished young Philomena, and Barbara Jefford, who plays the unyielding, self-righteous Sister Hildegarde.

Stephen Frears, 2013, 99 minutes, based on the bookLost Child of Philomena Lee The Heartbreaking Story of a Mother and the Son She Had to Give Awayby Martin Sixsmith (2009) and I do recommend the bookPhilomena: A Mother, Her Son, and a Fifty-Year Search (Movie Tie-in)by Martin Sixsmith and Judi Dench (2013).) ~I just watched PHILOMENA. This is one of the most stunning, wonderful, funny and heartbreaking films I have ever seen, or am likely to see. It is a true story and as such, I have given the customer links to pertinent materials. This will be easy to review, because I can spoil nothing--though if you know this story already, which I certainly didn't, you will know it well.Martin Sixsmith (an unusually charismatic and riveting Steve Coogen), a washed-up author/journalist, meets Irish grandmother and retired nurse Philomena Lee (a stunning Dame Judi Dench). Philomena is longing to find her illegitimate son, Antony, taken from her fifty years before at the convent where Philomena spent much of her early adult life.Sixsmith dove right into the story, and decided he would help Philomena find her son. From the convent in Roscrea (Ros Cr&eacute;), Ireland, to Washington D.C. and back again--this is a story of the heart, about the heart, and how the heart remembers what the mind cannot. Andre Desplat outdid himself with the lively, vibrant score and Frears has frankly outdone himself.Needless to say--but I'm saying it anyway--Dame Judi gives of herself totally to the audience. She plays Philomena as a true innocent, which one can readily see is the only way to play the part. I actually learned something, worded profoundly yet simply. Whether it was the real Philomena or Dame Judi or the writers, it reminded me of my mother's wisdom: don't mistreat people who are on their way up because you might meet them again on YOUR way down, and it is so true!While I will not spoil a bit of this wonderful instant super-classic film, I can give you one or two more scenes to watch for:-When Philomena is chatting about Mexicans in England.-When Martin tells an old nun what Jesus would do!-When Philomena tells Martin what God would say to him.The extras on this DVD are smashing. There is an interview with Dame Judi Dench, a terrific little segment on the real Philomena Lee, and a fantastic onstage Q&A; with Steve Coogan about the entire project and his prominent role as writer and co-star. Get this, and learn something that stunned but certainly did not surprise me: there is evil that far outweighs illegitimate births, and it is not evil to be found in the mothers.I suggest, perhaps as a lead-in to this film, you also see the exquisite true story/cinematic sleeper from 2010,Oranges and Sunshine(see my review) which tells a very similar story about the exact same general subject.",5,"""I don't want to hate people..."" -Philomena Lee",1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,2847,"['PHILOMENA', 'Writ', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Dir', 'Stephen', 'Frears', '2013', '99', 'minutes', 'based', 'bookLost', 'Child', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'Heartbreaking', 'Story', 'Mother', 'Son', 'Had', 'Give', 'Awayby', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', '2009', 'do', 'recommend', 'bookPhilomena', 'Mother', 'Her', 'Son', 'Fifty-Year', 'Search', 'Movie', 'Tie-in', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Judi', 'Dench', '2013', '~I', 'just', 'watched', 'PHILOMENA', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'heartbreaking', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'likely', 'see', 'true', 'story', 'such', 'have', 'given', 'customer', 'links', 'pertinent', 'materials', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'review', 'can', 'spoil', 'nothing', 'know', 'story', 'already', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'will', 'know', 'well.Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'unusually', 'charismatic', 'riveting', 'Steve', 'Coogen', 'washed-up', 'author/journalist', 'meets', 'Irish', 'grandmother', 'retired', 'nurse', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'stunning', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Philomena', 'longing', 'find', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Antony', 'taken', 'fifty', 'years', 'convent', 'where', 'Philomena', 'spent', 'much', 'early', 'adult', 'life.Sixsmith', 'dove', 'right', 'story', 'decided', 'would', 'help', 'Philomena', 'find', 'son', 'convent', 'Roscrea', 'Ros', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'Ireland', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'back', 'again', 'story', 'heart', 'heart', 'how', 'heart', 'what', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'Andre', 'Desplat', 'outdid', 'lively', 'vibrant', 'score', 'Frears', 'frankly', 'outdone', 'himself.Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'saying', 'anyway', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'totally', 'audience', 'Philomena', 'true', 'innocent', 'one', 'can', 'readily', 'see', 'only', 'way', 'play', 'part', 'actually', 'learned', 'something', 'worded', 'profoundly', 'yet', 'simply', 'was', 'real', 'Philomena', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'writers', 'reminded', 'mother', 'wisdom', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistreat', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'might', 'meet', 'again', 'YOUR', 'way', 'down', 'so', 'true', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'bit', 'wonderful', 'instant', 'super-classic', 'film', 'can', 'give', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'scenes', 'watch', '-When', 'Philomena', 'chatting', 'Mexicans', 'England.-When', 'Martin', 'old', 'nun', 'what', 'Jesus', 'would', 'do', '-When', 'Philomena', 'Martin', 'what', 'God', 'would', 'say', 'him.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'smashing', 'interview', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'terrific', 'little', 'segment', 'real', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'fantastic', 'onstage', 'Q', 'A', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'entire', 'project', 'prominent', 'role', 'writer', 'co-star', 'Get', 'learn', 'something', 'stunned', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'evil', 'far', 'illegitimate', 'births', 'not', 'evil', 'be', 'found', 'mothers.I', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'lead-in', 'film', 'also', 'see', 'exquisite', 'true', 'story/cinematic', 'sleeper', '2010', 'Oranges', 'Sunshine', 'see', 'review', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'exact', 'same', 'general', 'subject']",N/A

1680500,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GSBMNOQ,FNDNreview,"[2, 5]","After all these years, Judi Dench still doesn't cease to amaze. For more than 50 years, this wonderful actress has wowed audiences in such films as Mrs. Brown, Shakespeare in Love, and several films in the immensely popular James Bond franchise. She's won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, various BAFTA Awards on six separate occasions, and also a Golden Globe for Best Actress. While awards don't necessarily tell the whole story about an actress, these numerous awards are the result of a lifetime of devotion and hard work. But, just when you think someone is preparing to wind down their career, a role comes along to prove you absolutely wrong.Philomena, directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, High Fidelity), stars Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, an elderly woman that reveals to her daughter how she had a child out of wedlock and gave her son, Anthony, up for adoption 50 years earlier. After years of searching for him and running into roadblocks, dumb luck leads Philomena to a down-on-his-luck former BBC reporter, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who also serves as a producer and screenwriter with Jeff Pope). Reluctant at first to write a human interest story, Martin quickly agrees to help Philomena track down her son.The film begins with Philomena as a young woman (presumably in or around 1952) in Ireland. She's out for the night at a carnival and meets a charming young man with whom she has a one night stand. A short time later, she's pregnant with nowhere to go, forcing her to give birth to her child at a small Irish convent. This particular convent takes in young pregnant girls and sells their child for profit &#8211; forcing (more like insisting) the mother to sign their rights to the child away. The convent finds parents that are looking to adopt (mainly in the United States), and for a sum, they sell them.Philomena can still recall the day with clarity that she watched her child leave the convent, purchased by adoptive parents. Looking for information about the possible location of her child, Philomena and Martin return to the convent only to be informed such info is not available (allegedly it was destroyed in a fire). From there, Martin receives a tip that most of the children sold did in fact end up in the United States. Believing that&#8217;s where Anthony was likely take, Martin encourages Philomena to join him on a trip to the United States.Once in the United States, Martin arrives at more roadblocks, but finally discovers who and where Anthony has been since he left the convent all those years ago &#8211; information which he also shares with Philomena and his news editor. He&#8217;s put in a difficult situation due to the fact that he&#8217;s contractually obligated to tell Philomena&#8217;s story regardless of the outcome. After discovering her child&#8217;s whereabouts, Philomena goes back and forth about whether to stay in the United States or return home. Initially, she wants to leave but ultimately decides to stay and dig deeper into the past of her son. It&#8217;s an emotional journey, yet one that she's unwilling to give up on until she finds closure.The film is based on real life events depicted in the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, written by Martin Sixsmith. While the book focuses more on the life of Anthony, the journey to find him makes for a wonderful story on film. If you imagine this movie being a typical tale where the mother has her son taken from her and years later is reunited with him &#8211; like most fairy tale endings, you should brace yourself for something much different and far more emotional. This film is full of twists, turns, and unexpected revelations that you usually don&#8217;t find in films of this nature. It&#8217;s almost like a breath of fresh air, even though the true story doesn&#8217;t exactly leave you with a satisfying taste in your mouth.As you might expect, Judy Dench is absolutely flawless in her execution as Philomena Lee. Her command of the various emotional swings is just superb &#8211; and proves without a shadow of a doubt that she&#8217;s still one of the finest actresses on the planet. Age has no restriction because she continues to out due herself with every additional role that she adds to her already lengthy film resume. Dench portrays this character as someone that has made peace with the choices she&#8217;s made in her life, yet that doesn&#8217;t deter her desire for closure. There isn&#8217;t a scene in this film that won&#8217;t have you marveling in her mastery &#8211; especially in those scenes where she randomly goes on a tangent about her novels. For such a pointless scene, she sure does make it captivating.Martin Sixsmith is a typical, business as usual type of character. After having just been fired from a high-end government position, he falls back into journalism. On several occasions he declares he&#8217;s going to write a book on Russian history, so the fact that he takes the time for a random human interest story is a unique dynamic. Steve Coogan starts out with this character as someone that&#8217;s simply trying to figure out the next chapter of his life &#8211; let alone get into human interest journalism. However, that&#8217;s exactly what he does, and wholeheartedly, too. At no point does it feel like he&#8217;s only servicing himself or his career. He becomes morally invested, a train that Coogan sells perfectly. While Coogan gives a notable performance, he&#8217;s terribly overshadowed by Judi Dench.The story and acting are both memorable, but this film also doesn&#8217;t hesitate to take quite a few needless pot shots at religion and politics. Obviously, the fact that a convent basically sells off babies for a fee raises all sorts of red flags about the church in general &#8211; but something tells me that nasty message was conveyed quite well when Sixsmith&#8217;s book hit shelves in 2009. Politics is also the subject of several timely insults, directly largely at Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party. Reagan takes a shot for reducing AIDS funding, while the Republican Party in general takes a whacking for being non-liberal (in this case anti-gay).Overall, Philomena is a peace-of-mind story that aims to tell the truth more than provide a happy-go-lucky tone. This is a human interest piece though and through, meaning it intends to depict a series of events while still supplying information. Steve Coogan obviously has quite a bit invested in this film (literally) and will most likely be rewarded for it on more than one occasion (during award season). Judi Dench will also be in for quite a bit of attention after giving yet another career defining performance (and who would have thought that was possible given her already full list of incredible portrayals).

If at times the story becomes a bit `Hallmarky' that flaw is quickly diminished because of the power of the story and the manner in which it was made.Former BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is dismissed from the Labour Party in disgrace and is at a loss as to what do. His loathing for `human interest stories' is legendary, but that changes when a young Irish woman approaches him about a story of her mother, Philomena (Judi Dench), who when she fell pregnant as a teenager in Ireland in 1952, was sent to the convent to be looked after as a fallen woman. She cared for her baby for three years until the Church took him from her and sold him, like countless others, to America for adoption. Coerced into signing a document promising never to attempt to see her child again, she nonetheless spent the next fifty years secretly searching for him, unaware that he was searching for her from across the Atlantic. Suddenly struck by the strength of the story Martin arranges a magazine assignment about her search for Anthony that eventually leads to America. Along the way, Martin and Philomena discover as much about each other as about her son's fate. Furthermore, both find their basic beliefs challenged.There are many fascinating aspects to the story and the manner in which it ends but to share those would destroy the film for other viewers. Love conquers all and there is something in the genes that never lets go. Dench, Coogan, and Cathy Belton deserve special kudos but he cast that includes such non-verbal roles as Sean Mahon, and the bit parts by Peter Hermann, Mare Winningham, Sophie Kennedy Clarke, and Barbara Jefford add immensely to this sensitive film.

I'm 60+ and could really relate to both Philomena (Dame Judi Dench) and Martin (Steve Coogan.) Of course, being a GIANT fan of Judi Dench for years helps too. Dench is Philomena to perfection. Many have written about the story: Unwed Irish mother gets baby taken away for adoption by nuns. Philomena looks for him after 50 years. The story is the search, the flashbacks, and of course, the end results. Some of the flashback footage was REAL.Having the DVD (I chose to wait, instead of doing the theater viewing) allows for a second viewing with actor/writer commentary, and special features like a 9 min interview with Dench; 3 minutes meeting the real Philomena; and 25 min of Q&A; with Steve Coogan who not only acted Martin's part, but was writer and producer, not to mention the driving force to get this project started. He did more, but is unaccredited for the extra touches.

1680518,A9I40WFF40R4,B00GSBMNOQ,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[14, 18]","I have just seen in a local theatre the film ""Philomena."" I hardly know how to describe it. I went because I have never seen Judi Dench in a bad movie and because of the recent trailer I saw.  And another reason: a friend of mine, adopted as an infant, now at 70 has learned that she has a brother and sister and has made contact with them and has gleaned precious information about her birth mother who died several years ago. I do not believe  I have ever seen another human happier than she is right now.I cannot remember when I have found a movie so powerful and disturbing. I recently heard Scott Simon on NPR use a phrase about an interview on ""Story Corps"" that describes perfectly my reaction: ""it peels away the heart."" Based on the book by Martin Sixsmith and directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen""), ""Philomena"" relates the story of a young pregnant Irish girl who gave up a child for adoption and for 50 long years  wanted to find him. This is all I knew from the trailer and if any reviewer is intent on telling someone planning to see the film much else, I would advise you  not to read that review.I was devastated by the film. Two times during this hour and a half film that seems much shorter I screamed out at the film, a first for me. (I apologized to the woman seated two seats from me when the credits went up.) I cannot imagine that the movie will not reduce you to tears. I left the theatre angry and sad-- I vote for the journalist Mr. Sixsmith's (Steve Coogan) reaction to the events that take place rather than  Philomena's for whatever it's worth. Philomena Lee is a much better human being than I; she is right of course when she says that hate destroys the hater. I have just read via the internet her thoughtful, beautiful response in writing to a review by Kyle Smith in the NEW YORK POST in which he said that the movie is ""a sucker punch"" and that it attacks both the Catholic Church and Republicans. Ms. Lee is obviously a woman with class. Part of her gentle letter to Mr. Smith reads as follows: ""Stephen's movie is not an attack. . . It is a testament to the undying bond that exists between mothers and their children."" To that I say, say amen, somebody. Smith's review might be the nastiest I have ever read. And he totally ignores the scenes from near the end of the film when nuns-- and the last time I checked they were Catholic-- had a chance to do a kind and human, surely Christ-like deed and chose not to.While the writer and director take some liberties with the facts-- for example, Ms. Lee who worked for 30 years as a nurse in real life, is portrayed in the movie as sometimes a bit silly, reading romance novels and being too complimentary to the personnel in restaurants, Mr. Frears' depiction of how the Catholic Church treated both Philomena Lee and her son is completely accurate.  My reaction upon seeing the film, as a friend of mine recently opined concerning  its massive cover-up of pedophile priests, the Catholic Church has much to answer for. The question to ask, it seems to me, is whether or not what Mr. Frears through the movie says about the Catholic Church or the Republican Party is biased or untrue. After all, isn't the truth supposed to set us all free?Ms. Lee's story ultimately is about love-- the best kind-- and forgiveness which her letter indicates.  Surely Ms. Dench will win awards for her performance in this unforgettable movie.Addendum: For anyone interested in knowing more about this remarkable woman, Philomena Lee was interviewed for an article that appeared in the NEW YORK TIMES on November 30, 2013.",5,As Good as Movies Get,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,3591,"['have', 'just', 'seen', 'local', 'theatre', 'film', 'Philomena', 'hardly', 'know', 'how', 'describe', 'went', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'bad', 'movie', 'recent', 'trailer', 'saw', 'reason', 'friend', 'mine', 'adopted', 'infant', 'now', '70', 'learned', 'brother', 'sister', 'made', 'contact', 'gleaned', 'precious', 'information', 'birth', 'mother', 'who', 'died', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'human', 'happier', 'right', 'now.I', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'when', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'recently', 'heard', 'Scott', 'Simon', 'NPR', 'use', 'phrase', 'interview', 'Story', 'Corps', 'perfectly', 'reaction', 'away', 'heart', 'Based', 'book', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'Queen', 'Philomena', 'story', 'young', 'pregnant', 'Irish', 'girl', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'child', 'adoption', '50', 'long', 'years', 'wanted', 'find', 'knew', 'trailer', 'reviewer', 'intent', 'telling', 'someone', 'planning', 'see', 'film', 'much', 'else', 'would', 'advise', 'not', 'read', 'review.I', 'was', 'devastated', 'film', 'Two', 'times', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'much', 'shorter', 'screamed', 'out', 'film', 'first', 'apologized', 'woman', 'seated', 'two', 'seats', 'when', 'credits', 'went', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'reduce', 'tears', 'left', 'theatre', 'angry', 'sad', 'vote', 'journalist', 'Mr.', 'Sixsmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'reaction', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'rather', 'Philomena', 'whatever', 'worth', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'much', 'better', 'human', 'being', 'right', 'course', 'when', 'hate', 'hater', 'have', 'just', 'read', 'internet', 'thoughtful', 'beautiful', 'response', 'writing', 'review', 'Kyle', 'Smith', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'POST', 'said', 'movie', 'sucker', 'punch', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Republicans', 'Ms.', 'Lee', 'obviously', 'woman', 'class', 'Part', 'gentle', 'letter', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Stephen', 'movie', 'not', 'attack', 'testament', 'undying', 'bond', 'mothers', 'children', 'say', 'say', 'amen', 'somebody', 'Smith', 'review', 'might', 'be', 'nastiest', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'totally', 'scenes', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'last', 'time', 'checked', 'were', 'Catholic', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'kind', 'human', 'surely', 'Christ-like', 'deed', 'chose', 'not', 'writer', 'director', 'take', 'liberties', 'facts', 'example', 'Ms.', 'Lee', 'who', 'worked', '30', 'years', 'nurse', 'real', 'life', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'silly', 'reading', 'romance', 'novels', 'being', 'too', 'complimentary', 'personnel', 'restaurants', 'Mr.', 'Frears', 'depiction', 'how', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'treated', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'son', 'completely', 'accurate', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'film', 'friend', 'mine', 'recently', 'opined', 'concerning', 'massive', 'cover-up', 'pedophile', 'priests', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'much', 'answer', 'question', 'ask', 'not', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Frears', 'movie', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Republican', 'Party', 'biased', 'untrue', ""n't"", 'truth', 'supposed', 'set', 'free', 'Ms', 'Lee', 'story', 'ultimately', 'love', 'best', 'kind', 'forgiveness', 'letter', 'Surely', 'Ms.', 'Dench', 'will', 'win', 'awards', 'performance', 'unforgettable', 'movie.Addendum', 'anyone', 'interested', 'knowing', 'more', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'was', 'interviewed', 'article', 'appeared', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'TIMES', 'November', '30', '2013']",N/A

And remember Judi Dench is well regarded for portraying ""real people"" with authenticity...true to the person. So when I realized that through out this journey Dench's Philomena did not allow herself to get caught up in anyone else's issues or agendas, I was riveted to what I was learning about forgiveness - compassion - and transcendent love that takes a mother beyond the temptations of anger that would weaken her resolve and distract her from her path to reunion. Her single-mindedness penetrates to a purity of heart that humbled me... there was only one thing that mattered... finding her child. Clearly, Dench's Philomena had been preparing her heart for 50 years for reunion.  From the moment Philomena reveals to her daughter the photograph of her son.... everyone has an opinion and employs their powers of persuasion... either to pursue her intention or to abandon it. The focus of the reunion wasn't about what Philomena would gain, or achieve from the reunion -- the reunion was the fruit of her love for her child.  She wasn't about  settling scores.... nor punishing anyone - not even herself.  She didn't allow anyone's anger and rage to penetrate her tranquility of spirit... her peace....  THESE qualities --- what Philomena brought in her heart for the journey of reunion --- these serve as a model for anyone considering a reunion.Don't be distracted by who helps and who deters ... focus on how centered Philomena stays. Pure Grace! It would be a mistake to focus on what she did and miss how she did it. She did it with a purity of heart, and a peace that could not be uprooted by anyone. And she even avoided the trap of trying to change the opinions of others. She let her love bear witness.  I was deeply aware of how far I was from staying at peace in such combative circumstances! Tilting at windmills and getting distracted by my own brokenness. So... this is what the Beatitudes look like when lived in everyday life.  The film is a primer... for anyone yearning for a reunion of any type... and it is one of the most profound witnesses to the truth of the Beatitudes.",5,"For anyone considering ""reunion""...",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2190,"['Perhaps', 'most', 'profound', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Remember', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'remember', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'well', 'regarded', 'portraying', 'real', 'people', 'authenticity', 'true', 'person', 'when', 'realized', 'journey', 'Dench', 'Philomena', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'anyone', 'else', 'issues', 'agendas', 'was', 'riveted', 'what', 'was', 'learning', 'forgiveness', 'compassion', 'transcendent', 'love', 'mother', 'temptations', 'anger', 'would', 'weaken', 'resolve', 'distract', 'path', 'reunion', 'single-mindedness', 'penetrates', 'purity', 'heart', 'humbled', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'mattered', 'finding', 'child', 'Clearly', 'Dench', 'Philomena', 'had', 'been', 'preparing', 'heart', '50', 'years', 'reunion', 'moment', 'Philomena', 'daughter', 'photograph', 'son', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'powers', 'persuasion', 'pursue', 'intention', 'abandon', 'focus', 'reunion', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Philomena', 'would', 'gain', 'achieve', 'reunion', 'reunion', 'was', 'fruit', 'love', 'child', 'was', ""n't"", 'settling', 'scores', 'punishing', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'anyone', 'anger', 'rage', 'penetrate', 'tranquility', 'spirit', 'peace', 'THESE', 'qualities', 'what', 'Philomena', 'brought', 'heart', 'journey', 'reunion', 'serve', 'model', 'anyone', 'considering', 'reunion.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'distracted', 'who', 'who', 'deters', 'focus', 'how', 'centered', 'Philomena', 'stays', 'Pure', 'Grace', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'focus', 'what', 'did', 'miss', 'how', 'did', 'did', 'purity', 'heart', 'peace', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'uprooted', 'anyone', 'even', 'avoided', 'trap', 'trying', 'change', 'opinions', 'others', 'let', 'love', 'bear', 'witness', 'was', 'deeply', 'aware', 'how', 'far', 'was', 'staying', 'peace', 'such', 'combative', 'circumstances', 'Tilting', 'windmills', 'getting', 'distracted', 'own', 'brokenness', 'So', 'what', 'Beatitudes', 'look', 'when', 'lived', 'everyday', 'life', 'film', 'primer', 'anyone', 'yearning', 'reunion', 'type', 'one', 'most', 'profound', 'witnesses', 'truth', 'Beatitudes']",N/A

The Celtic harp is the key to the story.Like all testimonies of some past horror, after seeing it, after being told about it, no one can really say anything coherent about the drama they have just witnessed.Did that girl who had been entrusted to a nunnery for her education and had fallen into some carnal attraction deserve the severe punishment of dying in labor because the nuns did not provide her with any medical help, or deserve the punishment of seeing her own child be adopted away for a big sum of money from some rich Americans, or deserve the revenge of these nuns who refuse fifty years later to give her any indication about her son, and even lie to this mother in her old age and her lifelong repentance?If it were only one girl, we would say there was something wrong with her, but when there were always a dozen of girls in the same situation practically permanently in that nunnery, you can wonder what was wrong with this institution that could not educate these girls into some prudence and care about what they did. There sure was something wrong since they did not inform the girls of the danger of having sex on the wild side of the moon, and they did not provide the girls with any protection, of course not we are Catholic and we are in 1952, in other words in the Middle Ages, and we have to keep in mind the Catholic church, in spite of its recently promoted Pope, still advocates some hostility against any protection at all, and of course against abortion, which should never have to be performed if all precautions had been taken before, provided the teenagers were informed about these dangers and these protections.Was that cultivated ignorance a way to keep a dozen of adoptable children in constant availability for the parents who were ready to provide the nunnery with a wealthy income? Was that nunnery a nursery of orphans to be sold to the highest bidders?We have to keep in mind that contraception was liberated only twenty or thirty years after World War II in many western countries, and is still not common in many countries today, even when the law has made it legal. A shortage is so easily organized in this market economy.So is it the fault of Ireland who was thinking of many other problems including a civil war and did not even thought of women's rights? Is it the fault of the nuns who were totally engulfed in an ideology that made sex a sin and carnal desire a crime? Is it the fault of the Catholic church that was and still is in many ways tied up in some medieval beliefs? And is this Catholic church the only culprit in this world on that crime against humanity that uses sex to crush people down and keep them in some kind of mental slavery? Are other religions and fundamentalist ethics better on that subject?We are confronted to a drama that happened in one situation but similar dramas happened in many other situations, orphanages or simple homelessness and neglect, and are still happening, including the abduction of millions of children every year, sold by their parents on not, ending up in global prostitution, which seems to be so profitable in the countries where it is economically accounted for and financially registered. Who is responsible if not the human mind that seems to just start being able today in wider and wider zones in the world to understand that individual freedom is the condition to individual success and that common success cannot be reached in any society when individuals are not free enough to excel.That's what this film made me sad about: history is going so slow at times. And yet I am not that sad after all because history seems to be going slightly faster in the present period than it used to go before 1945. And yet has the world changed really? And will it really ever reach a proper general and global level of acceptability?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Poignant, gay and sad",1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,3976,"['film', 'time', 'continent', 'Ireland', 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'world', 'Celtic', 'harp', 'key', 'story.Like', 'testimonies', 'past', 'horror', 'seeing', 'being', 'told', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'anything', 'coherent', 'drama', 'have', 'just', 'witnessed.Did', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'entrusted', 'nunnery', 'education', 'had', 'fallen', 'carnal', 'attraction', 'deserve', 'severe', 'punishment', 'dying', 'labor', 'nuns', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'medical', 'help', 'deserve', 'punishment', 'seeing', 'own', 'child', 'be', 'adopted', 'away', 'big', 'sum', 'money', 'rich', 'Americans', 'deserve', 'revenge', 'nuns', 'who', 'refuse', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'give', 'indication', 'son', 'even', 'lie', 'mother', 'old', 'age', 'lifelong', 'repentance', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'girl', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'when', 'were', 'always', 'dozen', 'girls', 'same', 'situation', 'practically', 'permanently', 'nunnery', 'can', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'institution', 'could', 'not', 'educate', 'girls', 'prudence', 'care', 'what', 'did', 'sure', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'did', 'not', 'inform', 'girls', 'danger', 'having', 'sex', 'wild', 'side', 'moon', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'girls', 'protection', 'course', 'not', 'are', 'Catholic', 'are', '1952', 'other', 'words', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'Catholic', 'church', 'spite', 'recently', 'promoted', 'Pope', 'still', 'hostility', 'protection', 'course', 'abortion', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'be', 'performed', 'precautions', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'before', 'provided', 'teenagers', 'were', 'informed', 'dangers', 'protections.Was', 'cultivated', 'ignorance', 'way', 'keep', 'dozen', 'adoptable', 'children', 'constant', 'availability', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'ready', 'provide', 'nunnery', 'wealthy', 'income', 'Was', 'nursery', 'orphans', 'be', 'sold', 'highest', 'bidders', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'contraception', 'was', 'liberated', 'only', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'many', 'western', 'countries', 'still', 'not', 'common', 'many', 'countries', 'today', 'even', 'when', 'law', 'made', 'legal', 'shortage', 'so', 'easily', 'organized', 'market', 'economy.So', 'fault', 'Ireland', 'who', 'was', 'thinking', 'many', 'other', 'problems', 'including', 'civil', 'war', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'thought', 'women', 'rights', 'fault', 'nuns', 'who', 'were', 'totally', 'engulfed', 'ideology', 'made', 'sex', 'sin', 'carnal', 'desire', 'crime', 'fault', 'Catholic', 'church', 'was', 'still', 'many', 'ways', 'tied', 'up', 'medieval', 'beliefs', 'Catholic', 'church', 'only', 'culprit', 'world', 'crime', 'humanity', 'sex', 'crush', 'people', 'down', 'keep', 'kind', 'mental', 'slavery', 'Are', 'other', 'religions', 'fundamentalist', 'ethics', 'better', 'subject', 'are', 'confronted', 'drama', 'happened', 'one', 'situation', 'similar', 'dramas', 'happened', 'many', 'other', 'situations', 'orphanages', 'simple', 'homelessness', 'neglect', 'are', 'still', 'happening', 'including', 'abduction', 'millions', 'children', 'year', 'sold', 'parents', 'not', 'ending', 'up', 'global', 'prostitution', 'be', 'so', 'profitable', 'countries', 'where', 'economically', 'accounted', 'financially', 'registered', 'Who', 'responsible', 'not', 'human', 'mind', 'just', 'start', 'being', 'able', 'today', 'wider', 'wider', 'zones', 'world', 'understand', 'individual', 'freedom', 'condition', 'individual', 'success', 'common', 'success', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'reached', 'society', 'when', 'individuals', 'are', 'not', 'free', 'enough', 'excel.That', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'sad', 'history', 'going', 'so', 'slow', 'times', 'yet', 'am', 'not', 'sad', 'history', 'be', 'going', 'slightly', 'faster', 'present', 'period', 'used', 'go', '1945', 'yet', 'world', 'changed', 'really', 'will', 'really', 'ever', 'reach', 'proper', 'general', 'global', 'level', 'acceptability', 'Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I wonder if this wonderful actress ever dreamed her career would continue to soar into her golden years. I hasten to add that everything you have heard in praise of this film is richly deserved. This is a road picture without the outrageous calamities that usually beset players in this genre; it is a gentle comedy without demeaning any of the characters; and it is also a very effective drama about a young mother and her long-lost child.This PG-13, pleasantly scripted dramedy was co-written by Jeff Coke (Lots of TV) and Mr. Coogan himself, based on the book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee"" by Martin Sixsmith. You will see no sweaty bodies (except when Philomena gives birth), hear no gunshots, and see no vehicular mayhem. What a relief!We have:* Judi Dench (""Skyfall"") is Philomena Lee. Many decades ago, as a pregnant teenager abolished to a convent, she was forced to give up her out-of-wedlock boy as penance. She has searched for him for a long, long time. This woman is not worldly, but she IS wise...* Steve Coogan (""What Maisie Knew"") is Martin Sixsmith, a jaded journalist who suffers from a mild case of depression; he did after all, just lose his job. When he is first approached about this story, his reaction is strictly negative. ""Human Interest Stories"" are NOT his cup of tea! This may be the first time I've found this actor appealing.* Anna Maxwell Martin (""North and South"") is Jane, Philomena's daughter who is convinced her mother deserves to know what happened to her little boy after he was taken from her. Jane is the one who approaches the journalist...The facts, as they are uncovered, are NOT kind to the Catholic Church, nor to the people who administer the penances for their parishioners. In recent years, much has been disclosed about the treatment of young girls and orphans in Ireland, courtesy of the Church, so there is no big surprise here. This simply puts a face on one of its victims.The home movies that appear throughout seem so authentic, it's hard to know if they are real or not. I can't find anything that tells me, so I think this is simply an extremely sophisticated blend of fact and fiction. Kudos to the artists who put this together!

The connection between Judi Dench and Steve Coogan is what makes it work, and must have been similar to the connection between the real characters - Philomena and Martin Sixsmith. He is an out of work journalist who agrees to take on this human interest story at the urging of Philomena's daughter and his editor, though it's not usually his &#34;cup of tea&#34;. He finds Philomena extremely frank and forthcoming, and enjoys her delight in experiencing America for the first time when they visit Washington, D.C. to start the search for her long-lost son.50 years after her son was taken away from her by the nuns in Roscrea Abbey, she is still conflicted between the shame of having a baby out of wedlock and keeping it a secret for so many years. Sixsmith can't understand her Catholic guilt, particularly since the nuns had mistreated her so badly. She vacillates between supporting him in writing her story and wanting to keep it a secret. When he learns the real story, he is angry and outraged, and doesn't understand why she can be so forgiving. These are complex characters, both on a journey of discovery which is revealed gradually throughout the film.Some of the settings in Washington D.C. and Ireland are quite beautiful and the cinematography is rich. Both actors give wonderful performances. I didn't realize until watching the bonus material on the DVD that this is based on a true story.

In yet another shameful chapter in the Catholic Churches recent past, Philomena (an unwed mother in fifties Ireland) is forced to work as unpaid slave labor and have her young child sold to Americans by hateful nuns wit the collusion of the church and her government (it is a true story!) Despite fifty years of searching for her boy with nothing but lies from the convent in which she was held, Philomena still has hope. It is in playing Philomena that Dame Dench excels. She is completely without guile, and her faith remains unshaken. She can almost seem to be naive to Matin the journalist, but she never is.

1680565,A24UPY3K2IMZYV,B00GSBMNOQ,Joseph Elliott,"[6, 8]","Philomena was one of the most overlooked and under publicized movies nominated for best picture at the oscars this year, but certainly one of the best. The film is about the true story of Philomena Lee, who after getting pregnant out of wedlock, is abandoned by her shamed family to work in a Convent with other young Irish women in the 1950's. Long story short, her child is wrongfully taken from her by the nuns at the abbey and put up for adoption. Fast forward 50 years, and we have Judi Dench's Philomena, who is still searching for her son. Events pair her with a disgraced journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who sets out with her to locate her son. I won't divulge any more than this, for fear of spoilers. The story is an intriguing mystery that slowly unravels throughout the film. Philomena is a movie that gradually reveals itself to be more then it seems, starting out as a seemingly simple and formulaic road trip buddy comedy, and slowly forming itself to be the thoughtful, contemplative story that it is. The writing is excellent, using dialogue driven scenes to develop the two main characters, both of whom have differing beliefs and worldviews. They disagree often, and these scenes are both amusing and thought provoking. The film is very fair in that it doesn't take sides, but is nonetheless honest and pointed. The performances are perfect, with Judi Dench being the standout. Normally she plays very strong, dignified characters, so it was interesting to see her play such a naive, modest, and optimistic character. She is the beating heart of the film. Steve Coogan is very good as well, playing his character with snarky appeal and biting cynicism.In the hands of a different group of people, this movie would have been insufferable and overly sentimental. This is very difficult material, and it would have been very easy to demonize the Catholic Church for the self righteous cruelty they visited upon these young girls, of whom Philomena is one of many. Likewise, it would have also been easy to make this a preachy and weepy film about the power of forgiveness. But thanks to the competent direction of Stephen Frears, the excellent writing, and knockout performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena not only overcomes these obstacles, but transcends them. It goes without saying that this is a moving film, but not in a manipulative way. This is genuinely powerful drama on an intimate level.

1680594,A3485K2A3Q814Z,B00GSBMNOQ,Lemons,"[5, 7]","There is never smoke without fire and given the many atrocities perpetrated by members of the Catholic Church which have finally been exposed, investigated and acknowledged by the Vatican, this was not a glowing coal, but a raging inferno. The Catholic Church in particular has come under fire for its cruelty, perversion and cover-ups, but is not unique in warranting castigation.More horrors have been perpetrated in the name of ""religion"" than anything else. Such institutions were often vehicles for sick, bitter, misguided individuals exacting payback for past injustices, or giving vent to their perversions on ignorant and hapless victims, without fear of consequence.Without deviating too far from religion in general or the Catholic Church in particlar, non-religious organizations that recruit followers are equally guilty, using their own twisted interpretation of faith or atheism to exploit members of their communities. Sleepers (1996) is a case in point - there are numerous others.The 2002 Magdalene Sisters film was a similar expos&eacute;, much broader than Philomena, which proved largely true, allowing the world a glimpse of the punitive conditions endured by inmates. Young fallen women (mostly teenage girls) were disowned by their families because of the ingrained stigma of illegitimacy drummed in by the church. It was an excellent movie, but compared to Philomena, comes across as more heavy handed and shocking. Philomena has it's light moments, leaving one uplifted rather than depressed. In many ways, it is more about the system and narrow mindedness of the families who abandoned their daughters, than a pure assassination on the Catholic Church.Forced to sign disclaimers relinquishing rights to their children, years of indentured servitude were imposed in return for taking in these girls.  They were forced to suffer inhumane, punitive conditions - 12 hour workdays, 7 days per week, with meagre food, clothing and shelter for mother and child, some institutions only only permitting 1 hour per day for mothers to be with their children. Albeit limited, this contact exacerbated the trauma of inevitable separation.This generated income for the convent, while the nuns themselves did little physical work.  Adding another money spinner - adoption -  made these institutions highly profitable. The exact details may have been distorted for media sensationalism, but the truth is, it happened mostly as portrayed. Too many similar accounts from women all over Ireland who didn't know one another cannot all be shades of the same fabrication. Smoke with fire indeed. Feedback from inmates of previous Magdalene laundries have testified that the movie, The Magdalene Sisters was tame in comparison to reality.As a poor, almost 3rd world country, dominated by the dogma of the Catholic Church, it is little wonder that mid-20th century Ireland's treatment of the dispossessed has been the focus of so much controversy. Unfortunately, these institutions had been meting out this type of treatment for hundred of years, in a time capsule devoid of modern enlightenment. Far from emancipating these women to move on and have meaningful lives after serving out their penance, they set out to break their spirit.Without spoilers, Philomena based on the true story of Philomena Lee's desire to contact her son, born 50 years earlier, who was forcibly removed and put up for adoption. Due to Ireland's poverty, wealthy Americans were targeted to ""buy"" these superfluous children. Suitability as parents was not an issue, just the ability to pay.Cynical and disillusioned Martin Sixsmith, recently misquoted and forcibly ""resigned"" from his position with the BBC, is not keen on assisting with this human interest project initally, but relents. The common thread between these two completely disparate individuals is their sense of injustice.Philomena, a naive, motherless girl who spent most her childhood in an orphanage/convent, is then disowned by her father when she falls prey to a silver tongued seducer at a fair who impregnates her. We do not know if this was a one night stand, or whether he abandons her after discovering that she is pregnant. Her guilt at her sin is so deeply ingrained that she is not bitter, just sad and curious to find out what sort of life her son had, who he is and whether he ever thought of her and Ireland.Sixsmith, who wrote the story (The Lost Child of Philomena Lee) and collaborated on the screenplay with Steve Coogan (who plays the role of Sixsmith) is leery of religion. His anger and frustration at the antipathy and continued cover-ups create a counterbalance to Philomena's unworldly viewpoints. Somewhere in the middle is the truth on faith. In the broad sense, is neither for nor against religion, but there is no doubt that an evil system was allowed to operate for so long.Throughout the film, Philomena's simple unsophisticated, but straightforward character is grateful for any services that she receives from paid emploees such airport crew, hotel and restaurant staff, neatly juxtaposing Sixsmith's brusque manner. She is easily sidelined by the glib nuns at the convent. Sixsmith, an experienced tenacious journalist is not so easily put off, which ultimately leads to closure for Philomena.No, it is not another boring attack on the Catholic Church. Yes, there has been some licence. Sister Hildegarde had actually passed on in 1995, nine years before Sixsmith got involved, but was included for 2 reasons.1. It was not necessary to introduce more characters to clutter the story unnecessarily.2.  By deviating from the truth to include Sister Hildegarde, their encounter was an embodiment of the narrow minded vituperative mindset of the time.The current Mother Superior, Sister Clare is far more enlightened, a product of her time. She could never convey what the infirm Sister Hildegarde did with her brief moments onscreen. Sister Clare had to deny the accusations against the convent, taking the party line - what is her alternative?This is not a happily ever after story. It's intimate, bittersweet and believable. Dame Judi Dench is consummate as ever as Philomena, as is Steve Coogan as Sixsmith, under the delicate direction of Stephen Frears. Oscar-worthy? Not quite. Despite winning a number of awards, there are more deserving offerings out there. Worth seeing - absolutely!Trivia :1.  Philomena Lee met Pope Francis, whom she feels has absolved her of the guilt that haunted her for so long. Of this, she said : ""I bet those nuns would be jealous now"".2. On being interviewed about his choice of Judi Dench as Philomena, Steve Coogan, who is well known for his dry wit as a comedian and impersonator (particularly of the numerous James Bond characters), lightened the moment by recounting their first meeting at her home.He said he was completely intimidated by the prospect and when she herself opened the door to receive him, he thought ""Oh my goodness, it's ""M""!"" (Forgive the possible misquote - I cannot find the exact wording anymore). However, On set, Judi put him at his ease, asking him to do Bond impersonations. The ease with which they interacted off-screen enhanced their on-screen chemistry considerably.",4,Duo find redemption in this uplifting story,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,7212,"['never', 'smoke',

Philomena, fifty years earlier was forced to give up her four year old son to comparatively rich Americans who in collusion with the Irish government and the Catholic charities literally bought the children of unwed mothers.Philomena gave birth under harsh circumstances then was mercilessly worked to pay her 'debt' to the Sisters in their laundries for four years. Though never given a chance to say goodby to her son or even told that he would be adopted, she has never forgotten him or stopped trying to find him.Her worries are endless--is he homeless, a drug addict, did he die in Viet Nam -and most hilariously--is he obese?--she's heard that is an enormous problem in America due to portion sizes. Her worries are both unfounded and very real--her son had done very well in life, was loved  but died young. In the interim, he tried to find her as well, and asked to be buried in the churchyard of the place he was adopted from.How Philomena reacts when she finds out about her son's life, the gentle lessons she teaches Martin, and her enduring love and ability to forgive are lovingly portrayed in this touching and often humorous story.",5,Lovely!,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,1361,"['lovely', 'gentle', 'tale', 'enduring', 'power', 'love', 'importance', 'forgiveness.When', 'sophisticated', 'cynical', 'journalist', 'Martin', 'job', 'approached', 'grown', 'daughter', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'Philomena', 'fifty', 'years', 'earlier', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'comparatively', 'rich', 'Americans', 'who', 'collusion', 'Irish', 'government', 'Catholic', 'charities', 'literally', 'bought', 'children', 'unwed', 'mothers.Philomena', 'gave', 'birth', 'harsh', 'circumstances', 'then', 'was', 'mercilessly', 'worked', 'pay', ""'debt"", 'Sisters', 'laundries', 'four', 'years', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'say', 'goodby', 'son', 'even', 'told', 'would', 'be', 'adopted', 'never', 'forgotten', 'stopped', 'trying', 'find', 'him.Her', 'worries', 'are', 'endless', 'homeless', 'drug', 'addict', 'did', 'die', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'most', 'hilariously', 'obese', 'heard', 'enormous', 'problem', 'America', 'due', 'portion', 'sizes', 'worries', 'are', 'unfounded', 'very', 'real', 'son', 'had', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'life', 'was', 'loved', 'died', 'young', 'interim', 'tried', 'find', 'as', 'well', 'asked', 'be', 'buried', 'churchyard', 'place', 'was', 'adopted', 'from.How', 'Philomena', 'reacts', 'when', 'out', 'son', 'life', 'gentle', 'lessons', 'Martin', 'enduring', 'love', 'ability', 'forgive', 'are', 'lovingly', 'portrayed', 'touching', 'often', 'humorous', 'story']",N/A

PHILOMENA falls into both categories, a sad tale that offers hope before the end of the film, a movie that inspires you to be a better person, to be like Philomena. Would that we could all achieve that goal.The movie opens with Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), a battle hardened political journalist caught up in controversy and looking for work. At a party he goes to a friend tells him to contact her should he ever decide to write a piece for her magazine. He also finds himself introduced to a woman who tells him he should meet her mother. Not expecting to find much interesting he agrees.When they first meet Martin is unimpressed with Philomena (Judi Dench), an elderly woman who wants him to help her with a quest. When she was a young girl in Ireland, Philomena found herself pregnant but unmarried. With no way to support herself she was sent to have the child and work for the nuns at Sean Ross Abbey. While she is told ahead of time what will happen, it still comes as a shock for her. Children born out of wedlock in this Abbey are sold off to American couples looking for children. What makes it horrifying is that the girls are allowed to nurse their children and spend time with them prior to their being taken away. Now some 50 years later Philomena turns to Martin to help her find her son.Martin isn't interested at first but the more he thinks about it, the deeper his interest grows. If nothing else he can get a story out of it. Contacting the magazine editor he met at the party he gets funding and he and Philomena set out to find her son. Their initial contacts in the Abbey lead to nothing but stonewalling and being informed that the records of all the children were burned in a fire some years back. Unwilling to settle for their replies Martin digs deeper until he discovers a leak that leads the pair to the U.S.A. Unfortunately the information they find isn't quite what they expected or hoped for.What makes this movie special isn't just the lead in story. The movie explores the relationship between Martin and Philomena, two completely different people from two totally different backgrounds. The posh world that Martin comes from is filled with superficial people who consider themselves above it all, especially when it comes to religion. Philomena, on the other hand, retains her faith in God after all that has happened to her in the past. A salt of the Earth character, her attitudes toward the world around her are to see the wonder of it all where as Martin takes it all for granted. Before their journey ends Martin will find his life changed forever.Coogan not only stars in the film, he helped write it as well. While not a known mega-star in the U.S., he is a big name in England. Some will recognize him from his roles in both NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM films. He turns in a wonderful performance here, showing his disdain for common people and being taken to task for that from Philomena. Dench is absolutely fantastic in the lead role, bringing a sense of amazement to the character as she observes her surroundings while trying to settle the heartbreak she has suffered through for all these years.If anything this film will tear at your heart with the whole story of the Catholic Church selling babies back in the 50s. It will anger you. But it will also make you realize that it is people who make poor decisions not organizations. This was a small group that made this decision, not the entire church. At the same time in today's times it's hard to imagine a world where young people have no idea how they will become pregnant and are stunned when it happens. It only makes the loss they experience that much sadder.Even with such a sad story there is much hope to be found in the experiences of both Martin and Philomena. Both of them walk away from the tale much wiser and closer than they were when they began this journey. The answer is found and just what that is I won't reveal. I would whole heartedly suggest though that you watch the film to find out. No guns, no explosions, no monsters or superheroes...just a movie about real people. In particular a movie about one true hero and that is Philomena. .",5,SEARCH FOR A SON,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4275,"['are', 'movies', 'want', 'see', 'others', 'feel', 'obligated', 'see', 'fall', 'categories', 'PHILOMENA', 'categories', 'sad', 'tale', 'hope', 'end', 'film', 'movie', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'be', 'Philomena', 'Would', 'could', 'achieve', 'goal.The', 'movie', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'battle', 'hardened', 'political', 'journalist', 'caught', 'up', 'controversy', 'looking', 'work', 'party', 'friend', 'contact', 'should', 'ever', 'decide', 'write', 'piece', 'magazine', 'also', 'introduced', 'woman', 'who', 'should', 'meet', 'mother', 'Not', 'expecting', 'find', 'much', 'interesting', 'first', 'meet', 'Martin', 'unimpressed', 'Philomena', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'help', 'quest', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'Ireland', 'Philomena', 'found', 'pregnant', 'unmarried', 'way', 'support', 'was', 'sent', 'have', 'child', 'work', 'nuns', 'Sean', 'Ross', 'Abbey', 'told', 'ahead', 'time', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'still', 'shock', 'Children', 'born', 'wedlock', 'Abbey', 'are', 'sold', 'off', 'American', 'couples', 'looking', 'children', 'What', 'horrifying', 'girls', 'are', 'allowed', 'nurse', 'children', 'spend', 'time', 'prior', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'Now', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Philomena', 'Martin', 'help', 'find', 'son.Martin', ""n't"", 'interested', 'first', 'more', 'deeper', 'interest', 'grows', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'get', 'story', 'Contacting', 'magazine', 'editor', 'met', 'party', 'funding', 'Philomena', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'son', 'initial', 'contacts', 'Abbey', 'lead', 'nothing', 'stonewalling', 'being', 'informed', 'records', 'children', 'were', 'burned', 'fire', 'years', 'back', 'Unwilling', 'settle', 'replies', 'Martin', 'deeper', 'leak', 'pair', 'U.S.A', 'Unfortunately', 'information', 'find', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'hoped', 'for.What', 'movie', 'special', ""n't"", 'just', 'lead', 'story', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Martin', 'Philomena', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'people', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'posh', 'world', 'Martin', 'filled', 'superficial', 'people', 'who', 'consider', 'especially', 'when', 'religion', 'Philomena', 'other', 'hand', 'faith', 'God', 'happened', 'past', 'salt', 'Earth', 'character', 'attitudes', 'world', 'are', 'see', 'wonder', 'where', 'Martin', 'granted', 'journey', 'Martin', 'will', 'find', 'life', 'changed', 'forever.Coogan', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'helped', 'write', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'known', 'mega-star', 'U.S.', 'big', 'name', 'England', 'will', 'recognize', 'roles', 'NIGHT', 'AT', 'THE', 'MUSEUM', 'films', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'here', 'showing', 'disdain', 'common', 'people', 'being', 'taken', 'task', 'Philomena', 'Dench', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'role', 'bringing', 'sense', 'amazement', 'character', 'surroundings', 'trying', 'settle', 'heartbreak', 'suffered', 'years.If', 'anything', 'film', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', 'whole', 'story', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'selling', 'babies', 'back', '50s', 'will', 'anger', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'realize', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'poor', 'decisions', 'not', 'organizations', 'was', 'small', 'group', 'made', 'decision', 'not', 'entire', 'church', 'same', 'time', 'today', 'times', 'hard', 'imagine', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'will', 'become', 'pregnant', 'are', 'stunned', 'when', 'only', 'loss', 'experience', 'much', 'sadder.Even', 'sad', 'story', 'much', 'hope', 'be', 'found', 'experiences', 'Martin', 'Philomena', 'walk', 'away', 'tale', 'much', 'wiser', 'closer', 'were', 'when', 'began', 'journey', 'answer', 'found', 'just', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'would', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'suggest', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'guns', 'explosions', 'monsters', 'superheroes', 'just', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'particular', 'movie', 'one', 'true', 'hero', 'Philomena']",N/A

I saw this picture in the theater, but I saw so many other movies around the same time, that I kind of forgot to write a review for it. This was a movie that gets even better and more rich in its second viewing, a movie that doesn&#8217;t lose any of its punch in a Blu-ray viewing. This picture is &#8220;Philomena.&#8221;Judi Dench stars as Philomena Lee, a real woman whose wedlock-born child was stolen from her by nuns when she was a teenager. Her mother had died and her father had shipped her off to the nuns when it was revealed she was pregnant. She had an intense maternal connection to her son Anthony, but he was given up for adoption without her consent, and she had been quietly looking for him for over 50 years. Martin Sixmith (Steve Coogan) is a journalist who doesn&#8217;t quite know what his own future holds. He is told Philomena&#8217;s story at a dinner party one night, and he decides to take this &#8220;human interest&#8221; story, which isn&#8217;t what he is used to writing, and tell this story that needs to be heard by the public.I haven&#8217;t read Sixmith&#8217;s book, and don&#8217;t quite know how accurate this film is to Lee&#8217;s real story. However, in this brisk and massively entertaining film, her story is very fascinating and multi-layered. Unlike many of the other Oscar films in 2013, the film has a humane running time - just over 90 minutes. However, these 90 minutes are filled to the brim with a rich story and incredible performances.The story packs an intense emotional punch that doesn&#8217;t hit you right away, but when it does in the film&#8217;s third act, you&#8217;ll likely be in tears. Judi Dench is basically playing the everywoman here - the every-old-lady, if you will. She will probably remind you of your own grandmother, or perhaps a teacher or some other older woman who was a great influence to you at some point in your life. She makes this (mildly?) fictionalized Lee someone who we love and root for from the beginning. We understand her and want her to find what she&#8217;s looking for.Steve Coogan, whom this is a passion piece for, co-wrote the screenplay as well. He does an incredible job as the man who stands as the voice of the audience - we&#8217;re hanging on every word of her story and we&#8217;re occasionally shocked, baffled and irritated at what&#8217;s going on, and so is he.The story is incredibly accessible. I&#8217;m not a parent. I don&#8217;t even like children at all, but I felt every bit of Philomena&#8217;s pain, because she is a very well written character. It eventually becomes nothing short of an old-fashioned crowd pleaser once the characters come full circle. This is a film that I suggest you buy on DVD, Blu-ray, whatever you fancy. It&#8217;s the kind of thing you can watch again and again, because I don&#8217;t see it becoming any less powerful in multiple viewings.Grade: A",5,Facts can sometimes make one great story...,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,3026,"['Oscar', 'race', 'early', '2014', 'brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'key', 'awards', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'end', 'day', 'saw', 'picture', 'theater', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'forgot', 'write', 'review', 'was', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'more', 'rich', 'second', 'viewing', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'lose', 'punch', 'Blu-ray', 'viewing', 'picture', '8220', 'Philomena.', '8221', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'real', 'woman', 'wedlock-born', 'child', 'was', 'stolen', 'nuns', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'father', 'had', 'shipped', 'off', 'nuns', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'pregnant', 'had', 'intense', 'maternal', 'connection', 'son', 'Anthony', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'consent', 'had', 'been', 'quietly', 'looking', '50', 'years', 'Martin', 'Sixmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'journalist', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'own', 'future', 'told', 'Philomena', '8217', 's', 'story', 'dinner', 'party', 'one', 'night', 'take', '8220', 'human', 'interest', '8221', 'story', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'what', 'used', 'writing', 'tell', 'story', 'be', 'heard', 'public.I', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'Sixmith', '8217', 'book', 'don', '8217', 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'film', 'Lee', '8217', 's', 'real', 'story', 'However', 'brisk', 'massively', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'very', 'fascinating', 'multi-layered', 'many', 'other', 'Oscar', 'films', '2013', 'film', 'humane', 'running', 'time', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'However', '90', 'minutes', 'are', 'filled', 'brim', 'rich', 'story', 'incredible', 'performances.The', 'story', 'intense', 'emotional', 'punch', 'doesn', '8217', 'hit', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'film', '8217', 's', 'third', 'act', '8217', 'll', 'likely', 'be', 'tears', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'basically', 'playing', 'everywoman', 'here', 'every-old-lady', 'will', 'will', 'probably', 'remind', 'own', 'grandmother', 'perhaps', 'teacher', 'other', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'influence', 'point', 'life', 'mildly', 'fictionalized', 'Lee', 'someone', 'who', 'love', 'root', 'beginning', 'understand', 'want', 'find', 'what', '8217', 'looking', 'for.Steve', 'Coogan', 'whom', 'passion', 'piece', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'incredible', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'voice', 'audience', '8217', 'hanging', 'word', 'story', '8217', 're', 'occasionally', 'shocked', 'baffled', 'irritated', 'what', '8217', 'going', 'so', 'he.The', 'story', 'incredibly', 'accessible', '8217', 'm', 'not', 'parent', 'don', '8217', 'even', 'children', 'felt', 'bit', 'Philomena', '8217', 'pain', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'character', 'eventually', 'nothing', 'short', 'old-fashioned', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'characters', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'film', 'suggest', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'fancy', '8217', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'becoming', 'less', 'powerful', 'multiple', 'viewings.Grade']",N/A

Helping in her search, which takes her to the United States, is British journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who begins his relationship with Philomena seeking a story, but winds up caring more about the woman he&#8217;s writing about than the facts he&#8217;s uncovered.Coogan and Jeff Pope wrote the screenplay, adapted from a book by Sixsmith, which takes a surprising, disheartening turn at its midpoint, yet moves on to a more than satisfying conclusion.Dench is magnificent as a woman who has kept her &#8220;dark&#8221; secret for half a century.  Indeed, some of her most effective scenes are without any dialogue whatsoever.  Coogan and Sophie Kennedy Clark, as the young Philomena, are also effective.PHILOMENA, released on home video by Anchor Bay Entertainment, is a truly touching film that is not afraid to inject some humor into what is, essentially, a tragic story.I don&#8217;t think the Catholic Church will like this movie.Extras on the Blu-Ray disc include feature commentary with Coogan and his screenwriting partner, Jeff Pope, an interview with Judi Dench, a Q&A; with Coogan, and a look at the real Philomena Lee.

He's looking for work and is eventually convinced that he would lower himself to write a human interest story, a genre he loathes.Eventually the odd couple (Martin and Philomena) travel to Washington, D. C. where they believe they will have better luck finding the boy, who now would be a middle aged man.  Martin, using some connections and some very cool software find the man now named Michael (Sean Mahon in home movies) who is now deceased.  It turns out he was a highly placed attorney in the Reagan and Bush administrations.Directed with a light touch by Stephen Frears, the movie is guaranteed to produce a tear or two, but not by manipulating the audience with swelling violins or overly distraught characters.  In fact, Dench keeps the character's emotions in check for the most part.  At the same time the pain is clearly visable in her eyes and gestures.  A great piece of acting.Coogan is also underrated as a dramatic actor and for the most part plays Sixsmith as a cold, calculating cynical investigative reporter.  At the same time his humor is always on the cusp.  Sixsmith is a non-believing lapsed Catholic and Philomena is a God fearing regular which creates some humorous byplay between the two.  This is an Oscar worthy film that moves along briskly coming in at 98 minutes and while there is a melancholy theme, it plays honestly without a bit of saccharin.",4,4 1/2 stars for a well made beautiful film,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1946,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'who', 'lost', 'child', 'adoption', 'sold', 'property', 'rich', 'Americans', 'unwed', 'teen', 'Philomena', 'played', 'unusual', 'wit', 'character', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'been', 'searching', 'boy', 'named', 'Anthony', 'decades', 'return', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'home', 'girls', 'been', 'met', 'stonewalled', 'rejection', 'Philomena', 'daughter', 'serving', 'waiter', 'social', 'gathering', 'meets', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'recently', 'sacked', 'political', 'press', 'aid', 'looking', 'work', 'eventually', 'convinced', 'would', 'lower', 'write', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'genre', 'loathes.Eventually', 'odd', 'couple', 'Martin', 'Philomena', 'travel', 'Washington', 'D.', 'C.', 'where', 'believe', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'finding', 'boy', 'who', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'Martin', 'using', 'connections', 'very', 'cool', 'software', 'find', 'man', 'now', 'named', 'Michael', 'Sean', 'Mahon', 'home', 'movies', 'who', 'now', 'deceased', 'out', 'was', 'highly', 'placed', 'attorney', 'Reagan', 'Bush', 'administrations.Directed', 'light', 'touch', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'produce', 'tear', 'two', 'not', 'manipulating', 'audience', 'swelling', 'violins', 'overly', 'distraught', 'characters', 'fact', 'Dench', 'character', 'emotions', 'check', 'most', 'part', 'same', 'time', 'pain', 'clearly', 'visable', 'eyes', 'gestures', 'great', 'piece', 'acting.Coogan', 'also', 'underrated', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'most', 'part', 'Sixsmith', 'cold', 'calculating', 'cynical', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'same', 'time', 'humor', 'always', 'cusp', 'Sixsmith', 'non-believing', 'lapsed', 'Catholic', 'Philomena', 'God', 'fearing', 'regular', 'humorous', 'byplay', 'two', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'film', 'along', 'briskly', 'coming', '98', 'minutes', 'melancholy', 'theme', 'honestly', 'bit', 'saccharin']",N/A

As the movie opens, we learn that journalist Sixsmith just lost his job (Sixsmith: 'I'm depressed because I just go the sack'; his doctor: 'But it wasn't your fault'. Sixsmith: &#34;that's why I'm depressed!&#34;) and is now contemplating writing a book about Russian history. Meanwhile, through flashbacks we learn that in the early 1950s Philomena became pregnant at a young age. Her parents gave her into care of the nuns at Roscrea Abbey in Ireland, where eventually her young son was given up/sold to an American couple. Philomena has been wanting to find her son ever since. Philomena's daughter convinces Sixsmith to take on this &#34;human interest story&#34;, and off go Sixsmith and Philomena looking for her son. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Steve Coogan pretty much took on this project, and in addition to starring, he also co-wrote the script and produced the movie. I very much enjoyed his restrained performance. Even better is Judi Dench, now in het mid-to-late 70s yet seemingly better than ever. While the movie is ostensibly about Philomena looking for her son, the movie is actually much more about the at first awkward relationship between Philomena and Sixsmith, and the &#34;fish out of water&#34; experiences when Philomena gets to the US. The chemistry between Dench and Coogan is palpable, and it truly carries the movie (Philomena: 'do you want a N-Tune?', to which Sixsmith responds: 'if I hum it, will you play it?', ha!). But the last 15-20 min., when all is revealed, of course will tuck at your heart, so bring a Kleenex or two. Make sure to stay when the credits start rolling, as not only do we learn what became of Philomena and Sixsmith, but we also get to see real-life pictures of them.I had seen the trailer of this a few times in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see it. The movie finally opened this weekend here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday matinee screening I saw this at was quite packed, and not surprisingly heavily leaning towards seniors. The crowd laughed and hollered at all the right times, and ate up this movie.

The movie poster for this film is one of the biggest misrepresentations of a movie I&#8217;ve ever seen. It makes the movie seem like some kind of screwball road-movie-romantic-comedy for retired people. This is absolutely NOT what the movie is.2. Based on a true story, this is a charming but heartbreaking comedy drama. It&#8217;s also simultaneously heartwarming, but without being sappy or saccharine.3. It&#8217;s about a young troubled girl, Philomena, who goes to live with nuns in Ireland in the 1950&#8217;s. But this is not &#8220;The Sound of Music&#8221;. Not by a long shot.4. Philomena is pregnant, and she is one of thousands of pregnant girls who work in convents almost as slaves, while the nuns sell the children.5. As an older woman, Philomena decides she wants to find the son that the nuns took from her and sold to rich Americans. She teams up with Martin, an unemployed journalist, to help her solve the mystery.6. What Philomena discovers gives proof to the old saying &#8220;Truth is stranger than fiction.&#8221;7. Martin is an atheist, and Philomena is a devout Catholic. They have strong words for each other at different stages of their quest. It&#8217;s a fascinating partnership, and give an extra layer of depth to an already interesting story.8. I&#8217;m used to seeing Judy Dench play smart, strong female characters. It&#8217;s pretty shocking to see her play such a timid, simple, religious woman going far out of her comfort zone to look for her son.9.

Then the last part of the book focuses on  Philomena looking for the son she had given up. I could not imagine how they could make this book into movie.The movie changed the structure to start when Philomena begins looking for his son. There are flashbacks to the convent and things that happened to her and her son. But most of her son's life is referenced rather than shown. The movie works beautifully as a mother's quest to find her lost son and reduces the focus on the more difficult issues in the book.Judy Dench makes Philomena come alive as a warm, funny and very sincere woman.

1680678,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00GSBMNOQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Philomena (Stephen Frears, 2013)Stephen Frears, it has always seemed to me, and I rush to add for no reason I can quantify, has always struck me as being Mike Leigh's filmic little stepbrother&#8212;not nearly as well-known, laboring in the shadow etc. where this side of the pond is concerned, but vastly more talented and enjoyable a filmmaker. That has started changing over the past decade or so. Frears is a very good all-rounder, but there are certain aspects of filmmaking where he excels. One of those specifics is pulling the best possible performances out of every woman he puts on a screen. (If you've never, sit down with Frears' two 1987 features, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Prick Up Your Ears, both of which feature a young Frances Barber, for an object lesson on how an actor and a director can work together to create magic.) America stopped being able to brush Frears under the rug when he took one of the world's best actresses, had the hubris to cast her as Queen Elizabeth, and netted Helen Mirred a long-overdue Oscar for Best Actress. With seven years and six films in between them (including the critically-lauded Tamara Drewe and the equally critically reviled Lay the Favorite), it would be somewhat disingenuous to case Philomena as Frears' followup to The Queen, but once again, Frears has taken one of the world's greatest actresses&#8212;and if there is an actress working today better than Judi Dench, I am entirely unaware of her existence&#8212;stuck her in a role based on a real person, and scored a Best Actress Oscar nomination. (The film is also nominated for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Score.) This is Dench's fifth Best Actress nomination; she deserves it here more than she has since 2002's Iris.Philomena Lee (Dench), as we open, is quietly mourning the fiftieth birthday of the son she hasn't known since he was a toddler; Lee, pregnant out of wedlock, was left by her family with the Magdalene nuns for four years after her pregnancy was discovered; the nuns raised money in part by selling the girls' babies to adoptive parents, usually from America (one minor character wryly notes that it was the Americans what had the money, in those days). Her daughter Jane (South Riding's Anna Maxwell Martin), who knew nothing of this story until that night, is waitressing at a party where she runs into disgraced former journalist Martin Sixsmith (What Maisie Knew's Steve Coogan), who's casting about for a story to get back into journalism; match made in heaven, no? At this point, the movie takes some turns into, essentially, comedic mystery, with Lee and Sixsmith attempting to track down Lee's son.Both the movie's greatest strength and its defining weakness lie in Judi Dench. She has taken the role she was given and played it to the hilt; Philomena Lee herself, anecdotally, is said to have loved Dench's portrayal. (Dench, in an interview, said she was more nervous than she had ever been, since she was playing someone still alive.) The problem is, well, Philomena Lee. A great deal of the movie's comedy is of the uncomfortable kind, poking fun at Lee's working-class background and general lack of tact (there's a scene with a Mexican omelet chef in a hotel that's positively cringe-worthy) and playing the fish-out-of-water class-war aspect of the film a great deal more than was necessary. To me, at least, it had the effect of watering down the entire last half of the film; the first part is gut-wrenching, while the second is...not. Ironically, in the hands of a lesser actress, I don't think the difference would have been as severely noticeable.A very good movie? Unquestionably. All it could have been? No, I don't believe so. *** ",4,I can see forever.,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,3712,"['Philomena', 'Stephen', 'Frears', '2013', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'always', 'seemed', 'rush', 'add', 'reason', 'can', 'quantify', 'always', 'struck', 'being', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'filmic', 'little', 'stepbrother', '8212', 'not', 'nearly', 'well-known', 'laboring', 'shadow', 'etc', 'where', 'side', 'pond', 'concerned', 'vastly', 'more', 'talented', 'enjoyable', 'filmmaker', 'started', 'changing', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'Frears', 'very', 'good', 'all-rounder', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'where', 'One', 'specifics', 'pulling', 'best', 'possible', 'performances', 'woman', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'never', 'sit', 'down', 'Frears', 'two', '1987', 'features', 'Sammy', 'Rosie', 'Get', 'Laid', 'Prick', 'Up', 'Ears', 'feature', 'young', 'Frances', 'Barber', 'object', 'lesson', 'how', 'actor', 'director', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'magic', 'America', 'stopped', 'being', 'able', 'brush', 'Frears', 'rug', 'when', 'took', 'one', 'world', 'best', 'actresses', 'had', 'hubris', 'cast', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'netted', 'Helen', 'Mirred', 'long-overdue', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'seven', 'years', 'six', 'films', 'including', 'critically-lauded', 'Tamara', 'Drewe', 'equally', 'critically', 'reviled', 'Lay', 'Favorite', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disingenuous', 'case', 'Philomena', 'Frears', 'followup', 'Queen', 'once', 'again', 'Frears', 'taken', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', '8212', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'better', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'am', 'entirely', 'unaware', 'existence', '8212', 'stuck', 'role', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'scored', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Score', 'Dench', 'fifth', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'here', 'more', '2002', 'Iris.Philomena', 'Lee', 'Dench', 'open', 'quietly', 'mourning', 'fiftieth', 'birthday', 'son', ""n't"", 'known', 'was', 'toddler', 'Lee', 'pregnant', 'wedlock', 'was', 'left', 'family', 'Magdalene', 'nuns', 'four', 'years', 'pregnancy', 'was', 'discovered', 'nuns', 'raised', 'money', 'part', 'selling', 'girls', 'babies', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'usually', 'America', 'one', 'minor', 'character', 'wryly', 'was', 'Americans', 'had', 'money', 'days', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'South', 'Riding', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'story', 'night', 'waitressing', 'party', 'where', 'disgraced', 'former', 'journalist', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knew', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'who', 'casting', 'story', 'get', 'back', 'journalism', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'point', 'movie', 'turns', 'essentially', 'comedic', 'mystery', 'Lee', 'Sixsmith', 'attempting', 'track', 'down', 'Lee', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strength', 'defining', 'weakness', 'lie', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'taken', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'played', 'hilt', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'anecdotally', 'said', 'have', 'loved', 'Dench', 'portrayal', 'Dench', 'interview', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'nervous', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'was', 'playing', 'someone', 'still', 'alive', 'problem', 'well', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'comedy', 'uncomfortable', 'kind', 'poking', 'fun', 'Lee', 'working-class', 'background', 'general', 'lack', 'tact', 'scene', 'Mexican', 'omelet', 'chef', 'hotel', 'positively', 'cringe-worthy', 'playing', 'fish-out-of-water', 'class-war', 'aspect', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'was', 'necessary', 'least', 'had', 'effect', 'watering', 'down', 'entire', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'first', 'part', 'gut-wrenching', 'second', 'not', 'Ironically', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'difference', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'noticeable.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Unquestionably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'so', '***']",N/A

I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as reviews of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray Combo pack.I had a chance to see this wonderful film last year when it played the Philadelphia Film Festival and couldn&#8217;t wait to see it again on home video as well experience the bonus features. Though my 42 inch TV screen is much smaller than the big screen I saw it on, originally, the film is just interesting and Dame Judi Dench gives the Academy Award nominated performance  that she was honored with.  The images on the Blu-ray are sharp and crisp.Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the script &#8211; based on a short article in the British newspaper The Guardian &#8211; is best known as a comedian but he does just right by the story here playing an out-of-work newsman who takes on the task of helping Philomena (Dench) find the son she gave up for adoption. Personally I feel the less you know of the plot, the more you will enjoy the film so you&#8217;ll get no &#8220;spoilers&#8221; from me.As for the &#8220;Bonuses&#8221; on the BD, the only reallu significant one is the feature length commentary by Coogan and his co-writer Jeff Pope. I would loved to have heard Director Stephen Frears and Dame Judi chime in but they aren&#8217;t there. Instead we get a nine-minute &#8220;Conversation with Judi Dench&#8221; featurette in which she responds to questions shown as title cards.  The questions are about her career and things she&#8217;s learned in her many years of acting (including her preference for live stage acting versus films. Next up is a piece titled &#8220;The Real Philomena Lee&#8221; which is really one of those &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurettes which includes comments from Dench, Coogan, Frears and finally the REAL Philomena and her daughter. It runs less than three minutes.  Lastly is a 24-minute &#8220;Q&A; with Steve Coogan&#8221; from December 2013 held at a screening.  It does add to the pleasure of the film.So, if you haven&#8217;t seen the film, I do highly recommend it. If you saw it in the theater or streaming on Amazon, and want to know more, there are a few hours of &#8220;extra material&#8221; (including the commentary) here for you.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of the Bluray version INCLUDING the &#8220;Bonus Features&#8221;,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,2779,"['Okay', 'figured', 'are', 'already', '460', 'posted', 'Amazon', '8221', 'Philomena', '8221', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'together', 'version', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'version', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'covers', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'buyers', 'sort', 'reviews', '8220', 'Most', 'Recent', '8221', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'said', 'Bluray', 'Combo', 'pack.I', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'wonderful', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'played', 'Philadelphia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'couldn', '8217', 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'home', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'features', '42', 'inch', 'TV', 'screen', 'much', 'smaller', 'big', 'screen', 'saw', 'originally', 'film', 'just', 'interesting', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'performance', 'was', 'honored', 'images', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'sharp', 'crisp.Steve', 'Coogan', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', '8211', 'based', 'short', 'article', 'British', 'newspaper', 'Guardian', '8211', 'best', 'known', 'comedian', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'here', 'playing', 'out-of-work', 'newsman', 'who', 'task', 'helping', 'Philomena', 'Dench', 'find', 'son', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'Personally', 'feel', 'less', 'know', 'plot', 'more', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', '8217', 'get', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'me.As', '8220', 'Bonuses', '8221', 'BD', 'only', 'reallu', 'significant', 'one', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'Coogan', 'co-writer', 'Jeff', 'Pope', 'would', 'loved', 'have', 'heard', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'chime', 'aren', '8217', 'there', 'Instead', 'get', 'nine-minute', '8220', 'Conversation', 'Judi', 'Dench', '8221', 'featurette', 'questions', 'shown', 'title', 'cards', 'questions', 'are', 'career', 'things', '8217', 's', 'learned', 'many', 'years', 'acting', 'including', 'preference', 'live', 'stage', 'acting', 'versus', 'films', 'Next', 'up', 'piece', 'titled', '8220', 'Real', 'Philomena', 'Lee', '8221', 'really', 'one', '8220', 'Making', '8221', 'featurettes', 'comments', 'Dench', 'Coogan', 'Frears', 'finally', 'REAL', 'Philomena', 'daughter', 'less', 'three', 'minutes', 'Lastly', '24-minute', '8220', 'Q', 'A', 'Steve', 'Coogan', '8221', 'December', '2013', 'held', 'screening', 'add', 'pleasure', 'film.So', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'film', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'saw', 'theater', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'hours', '8220', 'extra', 'material', '8221', 'including', 'commentary', 'here', 'you.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A

1680718,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00GSBMNOQ,StrangePegs,"[9, 13]","I don't have anything against Catholics, but it's difficult for me, at this point in my life, to have sympathy for the Catholic Church at all, despite the fact that I think the new Pope is pretty cool. The history of the Catholic Church is so full of injustices done for the &#34;good&#34; of people it makes it difficult to see any actual good. The fact that this stuff is still ongoing and that we are constantly finding out about new ways in which the Church covered up wrongs and, even, allowed them to keep happening is incredible to me. To paraphrase a line from Philomena, &#34;If Jesus was here, he'd tip the Church out of its wheelchair, and it wouldn't get up and walk!&#34;And, now, the spoiler warning!That was it. The warning, I mean.The movie is not about the Catholic Church while being about the Catholic Church. It's about a woman's search for her son, who was taken from her against her will and sold... by a nunnery. Because that's what they did with unwanted girls and their babies, wanted or not. Basically, young girls who had become pregnant and, therefore, an embarrassment to their families were given over to this particular convent as slaves. Seriously. They were held for a particular amount of time and made to work everyday unless they could buy their way out of it. Of course, they weren't paid for their work, and their families had abandoned them there, so they had no way of coming up with any money with which to purchase their freedom. They were also forced to sign away the rights to their babies, which were then sold, usually to Americans. It was horrid.So... slavery and selling babies. Just par for the course for the Catholic Church, I guess. And, of course, after the fact, they lied to both the mothers and the children who were trying to reunite with each other. And burned all the records so that they could honestly say, &#34;the records all burned up in the great fire.&#34;I suppose I might be able to start getting over my ill feelings toward the Catholic Church if all of this stuff was in the past. If this was stuff the church used to do, but this stuff... this stuff just happened. It took an investigative reporter to uncover the truth of  this situation because they, the nuns and the church, were still busy lying about what had happened. And we continue to find out about things like this month after month. It makes it difficult to look at any good things the Catholic Church may have done.Anyway...Steve Coogan is amazing in this movie. He also co-wrote the script. I'm used to him playing comedic side characters of no real import, but he was completely convincing as Martin Sixsmith, the reporter who investigated the convent in order to help Philomena track down her son. I hope Coogan pursues more work of this nature, both writing and acting, because he was excellent.As was Judi Dench, but that's to be expected. However, if you're used to her in more commanding roles, she may surprise you in this one as the somewhat-daft-and-possibly-not-always-quite-in-touch-with-things Philomena Lee. She was a pleasure to watch and deserves her nomination.Philomena is a very good movie, certainly one of the best I have seen this year, so I can totally support its nomination. I don't think it's going to win, nor do I think it should, but it's not out of place on the list. And, now, I actually (more than) kind of want to read the book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, and, when you adapt a book into a movie (whether it's a true story or not), I think the highest achievement of the movie is that it makes you want to read the book. I'm not saying I will (because my TBR stack is huge), but I want to. Also, it's good to get more of this stuff from the Church out into the open and, hopefully, prompt them into some real change.",4,The Church Wouldn't Get Up and Walk,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3789,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'Catholics', 'difficult', 'point', 'life', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'fact', 'think', 'new', 'Pope', 'pretty', 'cool', 'history', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'so', 'full', 'injustices', 'done', '34', 'good', '34', 'people', 'difficult', 'see', 'actual', 'good', 'fact', 'stuff', 'still', 'ongoing', 'are', 'constantly', 'finding', 'out', 'new', 'ways', 'Church', 'covered', 'up', 'wrongs', 'even', 'allowed', 'keep', 'happening', 'incredible', 'paraphrase', 'line', 'Philomena', '34', 'Jesus', 'was', 'here', ""'d"", 'tip', 'Church', 'wheelchair', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'walk', '34', 'now', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'was', 'warning', 'mean.The', 'movie', 'not', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'being', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'woman', 'search', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'will', 'sold', 'nunnery', 'what', 'did', 'unwanted', 'girls', 'babies', 'wanted', 'not', 'Basically', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'pregnant', 'therefore', 'embarrassment', 'families', 'were', 'given', 'particular', 'convent', 'slaves', 'Seriously', 'were', 'held', 'particular', 'amount', 'time', 'made', 'work', 'everyday', 'could', 'buy', 'way', 'course', 'were', ""n't"", 'paid', 'work', 'families', 'had', 'abandoned', 'there', 'had', 'way', 'coming', 'up', 'money', 'purchase', 'freedom', 'were', 'also', 'forced', 'sign', 'away', 'rights', 'babies', 'were', 'then', 'sold', 'usually', 'Americans', 'was', 'horrid.So', 'slavery', 'selling', 'babies', 'Just', 'par', 'course', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'guess', 'course', 'fact', 'lied', 'both', 'mothers', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'reunite', 'other', 'burned', 'records', 'could', 'honestly', 'say', '34', 'records', 'burned', 'up', 'great', 'fire.', '34', 'suppose', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'start', 'getting', 'ill', 'feelings', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'stuff', 'was', 'past', 'was', 'stuff', 'church', 'used', 'do', 'stuff', 'stuff', 'just', 'happened', 'took', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'uncover', 'truth', 'situation', 'nuns', 'church', 'were', 'still', 'busy', 'lying', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'continue', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'month', 'month', 'difficult', 'look', 'good', 'things', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'may', 'have', 'done.Anyway', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'amazing', 'movie', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', ""'m"", 'used', 'playing', 'comedic', 'side', 'characters', 'real', 'import', 'was', 'completely', 'convincing', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'reporter', 'who', 'investigated', 'convent', 'order', 'help', 'Philomena', 'track', 'down', 'son', 'hope', 'Coogan', 'pursues', 'more', 'work', 'nature', 'writing', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent.As', 'was', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'be', 'expected', 'However', ""'re"", 'used', 'more', 'commanding', 'roles', 'may', 'surprise', 'one', 'somewhat-daft-and-possibly-not-always-quite-in-touch-with-things', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'nomination.Philomena', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'can', 'totally', 'support', 'nomination', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'going', 'win', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'not', 'place', 'list', 'now', 'actually', 'more', 'kind', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'when', 'adapt', 'book', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'think', 'highest', 'achievement', 'movie', 'want', 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'will', 'TBR', 'stack', 'huge', 'want', 'Also', 'good', 'get', 'more', 'stuff', 'Church', 'out', 'open', 'hopefully', 'prompt', 'real', 'change']",N/A

It didn't look like there was any violence so I knew my wife might like it, AND it was at our favorite theatre, one of those old places that're cold inside like when I was a kid, and my wife and I, both in are 60s, are often among the youngest there!What better a combination?Philomena (Dame Judi Dench) starts out--as we all do--young. There's a short reference to the young man with whom she had an affair, upwards of a half century ago, which left her &#34;with child.&#34; Her parents rejected her, and she ended up as slave labor in a convent in Ireland, along with her young son.(There was another film several years ago about how those wretched nuns treated the girls in the Irish convent well into the 20th century, so, at long last, exposure of some of that oppression is being revealed!)In the meantime, here, late in the 20th century (That's when it took place.), journalist Martin Sixsmith's (Steve Coogan) career is on the wane. He needs something, and he ends up with Philomena who wants to find out what happened to her son, who another flashback in the film points out was taken from her, by the highest bidder, still another thorn in the Church's side!When I saw Coogan, I was wondering, do I know that guy? Where have I seen him before. My God he looks familiar! When I got home I checked out my movie database. I've seen him before in, of all things, &#34;Tropic Thunder,&#34; which had a dramatically different theme than this film!Now, I'm afraid to give anything away about the film so I'll only point out it has just enough one-liners to make the script delightfully entertaining, in addition to sentimental. Look for one about her finding out that her son had a harp on his lapel...and there are others.And the make up. The role of Sister Hildegard--I wonder if that was the Mother Superior's real name or if the character's name was taken from the noted 12 century matriarch Hildegard von Bingen, much of whose music I have in my collection of ancient music--was played by Barbara Jefford. Not only was her acting superior, but the make-up: She sent from being a relatively young sister of upwards of 50 years ago to an ancient nun in a wheelchair, and she looked &#34;natural&#34; as both. So, between the acting and the make-up, we have a couple of real winners! Her little soliloquy toward the end decrying Philomena for her promiscuity, while &#34;I maintained my celibacy&#34; or something like that was so on-target from an elderly sister that it bordered uncomfortable!And, as a veteran of 12 years of Catholic education, my role as a theology graduate student when I was in my 40s, my having worked for the Catholic Church for four years, and still having some dear friends still &#34;in the habit,&#34; I can speak for there having been that kind of repression not that many years ago, and that, thank heaven, most of it is now history.I feel like I could have said more except that I don't want to give much away. it's definitely worth seeing, maybe even more than once.",5,Excellent,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3053,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'critics', 'applauded', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'violence', 'so', 'knew', 'wife', 'might', 'like', 'was', 'favorite', 'theatre', 'one', 'old', 'places', ""'re"", 'cold', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'wife', 'are', '60s', 'are', 'often', 'youngest', 'there', 'What', 'better', 'combination', 'Philomena', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'out', 'do', 'young', 'short', 'reference', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'had', 'affair', 'upwards', 'half', 'century', 'left', '34', 'child.', '34', 'parents', 'rejected', 'ended', 'up', 'as', 'slave', 'labor', 'convent', 'Ireland', 'young', 'son', 'was', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'wretched', 'nuns', 'treated', 'girls', 'Irish', 'convent', 'well', '20th', 'century', 'so', 'long', 'last', 'exposure', 'oppression', 'being', 'revealed', 'meantime', 'here', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'when', 'took', 'place', 'journalist', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'career', 'wane', 'something', 'up', 'Philomena', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'who', 'flashback', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'was', 'taken', 'highest', 'bidder', 'still', 'thorn', 'Church', 'side', 'When', 'saw', 'Coogan', 'was', 'wondering', 'do', 'know', 'guy', 'Where', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'God', 'familiar', 'When', 'got', 'home', 'checked', 'out', 'movie', 'database', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'things', '34', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', '34', 'had', 'dramatically', 'different', 'theme', 'film', 'Now', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'film', 'so', ""'ll"", 'only', 'point', 'out', 'just', 'enough', 'one-liners', 'make', 'script', 'delightfully', 'entertaining', 'addition', 'sentimental', 'Look', 'one', 'finding', 'out', 'son', 'had', 'harp', 'lapel', 'are', 'make', 'up', 'role', 'Sister', 'Hildegard', 'wonder', 'was', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'real', 'name', 'character', 'name', 'was', 'taken', 'noted', '12', 'century', 'matriarch', 'Hildegard', 'von', 'Bingen', 'much', 'music', 'have', 'collection', 'ancient', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'acting', 'superior', 'make-up', 'sent', 'being', 'relatively', 'young', 'sister', 'upwards', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'ancient', 'nun', 'wheelchair', 'looked', '34', 'natural', '34', 'So', 'acting', 'make-up', 'have', 'couple', 'real', 'winners', 'little', 'soliloquy', 'end', 'decrying', 'Philomena', 'promiscuity', '34', 'maintained', 'celibacy', '34', 'something', 'was', 'so', 'on-target', 'elderly', 'sister', 'bordered', 'uncomfortable', 'veteran', '12', 'years', 'Catholic', 'education', 'role', 'theology', 'graduate', 'student', 'when', 'was', '40s', 'having', 'worked', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'four', 'years', 'still', 'having', 'dear', 'friends', 'still', '34', 'habit', '34', 'can', 'speak', 'having', 'been', 'kind', 'repression', 'not', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'thank', 'heaven', 'most', 'now', 'history.I', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'once']",N/A

You are the cause of this shame, you and your indecency.&#34; Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) has just been forced out of his political office and has no idea what to do next. When a woman tells him a story about how her mother Philomena (Dench) gave birth to a son who was taken away from her by the nuns in the convent she was living at. Philomena has never really had any contact with the son for her entire life. Martin approaches his former magazine with an idea of doing a story about the reunion between a mother and son. What starts off as a simple human interest piece becomes so much more. This movie will make you angry. I start off with that because no review I have seen starts with that statement.

The most amazing thing about her though is even though she is constantly facing disappointment and heartache she doesn't let it affect her. Martin is the voice of most people in the way that he becomes frustrated and angry to the point of almost saying and doing things he can't take back but you understand why. Philomena represents the kind of person we all want to be. The movie itself was good, a little slow moving but by the end you will be glad you stuck with it and watched it. That is if you still have a screen to watch it on, depending on what you find to throw. Overall, a good movie that will make you angry. Really shows why pushing your fundamentalist principals on others is never a good thing and only ends up contradicting what religion is supposed to be about.

1680755,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GSBMNOQ,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Philomena is an interesting but odd little film that probably is more noteworthy for the controversy it engendered rather than for the efficacy of its narrative. It's based on the novel, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist Martin Sixsmith, a BBC correspondent turned Labour government adviser turned civil service worker, who became embroiled in a political scandal and was forced to resign (according to Wikipedia, the government later had to issue an apology and pay compensation). The screenplay was written by Steven Coogan who plays Sixsmith in the film. Coogan grafted a good part of his own personality on to Sixsmith who notably is Protestant with Coogan now portraying him as a lapsed Catholic, which is basically how Coogan views himself.Coogan is very harsh on the Catholic church and the director of Philomena, Stephen Frears, basically admitted on Charlie Rose, that Coogan wrote his own autobiography into it. Frears took issue with Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, in his article ""Debunking ""Philomena"", who claimed, ""A half century ago an Irish woman gave birth to a son out-of-wedlock and gave him up for adoption."" Frears argued that Philomena's child was actually ""taken and sold."" Donohue correctly maintains that the child wasn't ""taken"", as it was Philomena's father who brought his daughter to the abbey after Philomena's mother died when she was very young and he could not take care of her.Donohue takes exceptional issue to the charge that the Catholic Church took the children and ""sold them to the highest bidder."" Coogan/Sixsmith imply that the nuns at the convent conspired to destroy the records through an act of arson (recall the scene in the pub where Sixsmith takes the word of villagers who believe the 'rumors'). According to Donohue, a fire did actually destroy most of the records as reported in the NY Times at the time--but all the rumors about the nuns actually destroying the records, was never substantiated (but the filmmakers act as if this is a fact).Donohue also takes issue with Judi Dench who has been quoted as saying that Philomena was ""forced"" to give up her child. Donohue points out, however, that Dench forgets the scene in the film where Philomena acknowledges that she signed a legal agreement that she was relinquishing full claim to her child and handing it over to the nuns. And notably Philomena did this, not when she was a teenager, but when she was 22 years old!Nonetheless, one cannot ignore Philomena's feelings of bitterness toward the nuns which she expresses throughout the film. The actual giving up of the child (indeed if that's the way it happened), was an example of great insensitivity on the part of the nuns in charge and could have been handled in a much better way. At the same time, Donohue can't understand why Philomena would complain about her grudge work in the laundry for four years. He writes: ""The fact is that the nuns did what they could for the girls in their care, when no one else would accept them."" He points out that the government was in no position in 1952 to care for the children. If there's anyone to blame here, it would be Philomena's family and Irish society in general--in 1952 Ireland, a baby born out-of-wedlock, was simply not accepted. Donohue adds that if the nuns were that 'evil', why did they help Philomena obtain a job after she left the convent?According to Donohue, Sixsmith asserted that both Philomena and her son separately visited the abbey in 1977 looking for each other but the nuns have no record of that visit. Even more startling is the fact that Philomena and Sixsmith never went to the United States to search for her son--this was completely invented out of whole cloth by Coogan.The bulk of 'Philomena' concerns the search for Philomena's son, Anthony (adopted name Michael), who Sixsmith (Coogan) discovers was a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, was gay and died of AIDS, eight years earlier. After Philomena learns the shattering news, she and Sixsmith both decide to try and learn more about Michael and they end up speaking with his sister and ex-lover, who is initially hostile to communicating but warms up after Philomena directly approaches him.Is Donohue correct in asserting that 'Philomena' is one big Catholic bash? Not completely as the dialectic between the two principals makes it clear that Philomena is completely forgiving toward the nuns whereas Sixsmith/Coogan casts them as evil incarnate. In fact, Sixsmith/Coogan come off as self-righteous prigs who refuse to listen to Philomena's message of forgiveness. When Sixsmith damns the nuns when it's revealed they never told Philomena of Michael's visit to the abbey, Philomena points out they couldn't have known since he was visiting them as 'Michael' and not using his birth name of 'Anthony'.Nonetheless, Sixsmith is still enraged since there is at least one nun there, the ailing Sister Hildegarde, who would have known about Michael's visit and could have told Philomena later on. The problem is (and Donohue is completely correct about this), the real Sister Hildegarde died in 1995, and Sixsmith didn't start helping Philomena find her son until 2004. So the entire scene where an 'evil' Hildegarde blasts Philomena for her wayward ways is completely made up and never happened. Thus, the most significant dramatic moment in the film should be classified as wholly manipulative.I'm not an apologist for the Catholic Church especially in light of its history of pedophile priests. Nonetheless, in the case of this film, it's clear that the film's scenarists have unfairly stacked the deck against the nuns who cared for Philomena. The film still is worth watching particularly for Judi Dench's great performance as Philomena, the chronicle of her quest to find her son and the fascinating controversy the film has engendered.",3,One big Catholic bash or justified critique of the Church?

Philomena is an older Irish woman who lives in England. One day she breaks down in front of her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin) and reveals to her a secret that she has kept from the world most of her life: when she was a young girl she became pregnant out of wedlock and was forced to live in at the Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea. Sean Ross Abbey essentially was a Magdalene Asylum, an institution for young &#8220;wayward&#8221; woman that was run by nuns and the young women who were taken in there were basically treated as slaves who were forced to work out their penance. Philomena&#8217;s child, a boy, was taken away from her and she has always wondered what happened to him. Philomena meets Martin Sixsmith (portrayed by Steve Coogan), a former journalist for the BBC who was recently &#8220;sacked&#8221; from his job as a government advisor. Sixsmith is desperately trying to find a new project to work on as he works on a book about Russian history. While at a party a friend of his suggests he do a human interest story. Jane happens to be at the party and suggests to Sixsmith that she has the perfect person for his story, her mother Philomena Lee. At first Sixsmith is against the idea, but he eventually agrees to at least meet Philomena and soon this most unlikely duo are off on a surprising and moving journey.Other than knowing PHILOMENA had been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and that it starred Judy Dench, I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The film is full of interesting little twists and turns and that in itself makes it an enjoyable film. However, what really makes it such a wonderful and charming movie are the performances of Dench and Coogan and how the play off of each other. Dench received an Academy Award nomination for her performance, but she and Coogan should have been nominated as a pair; Dench&#8217;s performance would have been grand either way, but it&#8217;s made better by playing against Coogan.Overall, PHILOMENA is a surprisingly delightful and highly engaging movie that&#8217;s full of warmth and character. It tells a story worth telling and, if for no other reason, is worth watching for the chemistry between Judy Dench and Steve Coogan.",5,A Joyful Surprise,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2480,"['Based', 'book', 'THE', 'LOST', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'PHILOMENA', 'LEE', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'movie', 'PHILOMENA', 'biopic', 'woman', 'named', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'portrayed', 'wonderful', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'search', 'long-lost', 'son', 'Philomena', 'older', 'Irish', 'woman', 'who', 'England', 'One', 'day', 'down', 'front', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'reveals', 'secret', 'kept', 'world', 'most', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'became', 'pregnant', 'wedlock', 'was', 'forced', 'live', 'Sean', 'Ross', 'Abbey', 'Roscrea', 'Sean', 'Ross', 'Abbey', 'essentially', 'was', 'Magdalene', 'Asylum', 'institution', 'young', '8220', '8221', 'woman', 'was', 'run', 'nuns', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'were', 'basically', 'treated', 'slaves', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'work', 'out', 'penance', 'Philomena', '8217', 'child', 'boy', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'Philomena', 'Martin', 'Sixsmith', 'portrayed', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'former', 'journalist', 'BBC', 'who', 'was', 'recently', '8220', 'sacked', '8221', 'job', 'government', 'advisor', 'Sixsmith', 'desperately', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'project', 'work', 'book', 'Russian', 'history', 'party', 'friend', 'suggests', 'do', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'Jane', 'be', 'party', 'Sixsmith', 'perfect', 'person', 'story', 'mother', 'Philomena', 'Lee', 'first', 'Sixsmith', 'idea', 'eventually', 'least', 'meet', 'Philomena', 'soon', 'most', 'unlikely', 'duo', 'are', 'surprising', 'moving', 'journey.Other', 'knowing', 'PHILOMENA', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'starred', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'knew', 'nothing', 'movie', 'watching', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'full', 'interesting', 'little', 'twists', 'turns', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'However', 'what', 'really', 'such', 'wonderful', 'charming', 'movie', 'are', 'performances', 'Dench', 'Coogan', 'how', 'play', 'other', 'Dench', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Coogan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'pair', 'Dench', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'grand', 'way', '8217', 'made', 'better', 'playing', 'Coogan.Overall', 'PHILOMENA', 'surprisingly', 'delightful', 'highly', 'engaging', 'movie', '8217', 'full', 'warmth', 'character', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'other', 'reason', 'worth', 'watching', 'chemistry', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Steve', 'Coogan']",N/A

Based on a true story of an Irish woman's search for her son, the movie is a journey of discovery. Because it has so many twists and turns that will completely surprise you, I won't spoil the outcome. (Tissues may be required.)The story begins with Philomena's encounter with a young man at a fair, with whom she has sex. As a result of her encounter, she becomes pregnant. Her family sends her away to Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland, where she gives birth at a convent that houses young girls who are pregnant out of wedlock.During her time there, Philomena endures the harshness of working seven days a week and the constant condemnation of the nuns for her sexual indiscretion. Eventually, her young son and another baby girl are adopted by a family.  For 50 years, she has kept the secret of what happened to her, even though she eventually married and had other children. In her mind, it was a sin to have given birth out of wedlock and a sin to have kept it secret for 50 years. She can't decide which is the worse of the two.A journalist, Martin Sixsmith, decides to do a human interest story about Philomena's experience and search for her son. Her own attempts to find out what happened to him have been unfruitful, but with his journalist connections he is able to help her discover his whereabouts. They continue their search in Washington, D.C.  It is here, that the story begins to surprise and shock its audience, but it culminates in a discovery you don't see coming.The movie is filled with themes, mostly around faith, guilt, regrets, unconditional love, and the ability to forgive the cruelty of the sisters' actions. Unfortunately, Philomena is a woman driven by guilt of sins past and those present, which have been placed upon her by the church. Martin is a man who doesn't believe in God or understands the reasoning of the Catholic faith, and he often clashes with her beliefs.The true story is also a very sad commentary of the practices of this particular Catholic abbey regarding their own lack of compassion and secrets. From 1930 to 1970 they housed pregnant, unwed mothers, buried the ones who died in childbirth from poor care, sold babies, and continued to make the girls pay for their transgressions with heartless treatment and hard work.  In the end, it was a story that had to be told.Judi Dench is wonderful, of course. She was nominated for best actress multiple times for this movie, and the winner of multiple awards. Steve Coogan humorously portrayed the journalist, along with his cynicism over religion and the church. At times, you chuckled over some of his comments and the sparring between Philomena and himself.All in all, it's quite a good movie.

1680772,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00GSBMNOQ,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[299, 311]","Sometimes a film will surprise you by just how unexpectedly good it is.  Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, Liam, My Beautiful Launderette), with a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith, Philomena is one of those films. An extraordinary story about a woman's real-life search for the child she was compelled to give up for adoption fifty years earlier, it's also a marvelous character study of two highly mismatched people brought together by chance to solve a mystery with both knowing that the odds are very much against them. And even though this sort of story has been done many times before, Philomena not only manages to avoid cliche, it takes surprising twists and turns along the way showing that real life can indeed trump the best that fiction has to offer. It engages you from the very beginning, draws you further in with each scene until you are so deeply invested in the characters and their quest that everything that unfolds on the screen matters to you.The plot begins with Philomena Lee (marvelously played by Judi Dench) , a retired Irish woman living in England with her grown daughter, staring at a small old photograph of a little boy about 3 years old. When her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), asks, Philomena reveals a secret she's kept all her adult life - that when she was a young girl in Ireland she had a son out of wedlock that she was forced, very much against her will, to give up for adoption. The details of her story are revealed in flashbacks in which we see young Philomena (a compelling performance by Sophie Kennedy Clark) held in one of Ireland's now infamous Magdalene Asylums, institutions run by various orders of nuns where many young Irish girls of the time were sent for getting pregnant (as well as any number of other ""improprieties"" such as engaging in prostitution, being promiscuous or sometimes just for flirting), becoming virtual prisoners - and slave labor - beyond the reach of the secular law and with no hope of appeal.  She has been haunted by this her entire life, always wondering what became of her little boy, and finding her every attempt to find out thwarted by the implacable bureaucracy of the Irish church.At the same time, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan in a deft counterpart to Dench), a former adviser to the current Labour government at the time, has just lost his job due to a minor scandal due to something he said. Given the sack in his mid-fifties, Martin is at loose ends, unsure of what to do with himself, vacillating between taking up running or pursuing a vaguely-formed notion of writing a book on Russian history.  Prior to working in government though, Martin was a journalist of sorts, and while at a party an editor friend of his suggest that perhaps he should try his hand at doing a ""human interest"" story.  Jane, who happened to be at the party, overhears this and approaches Martin with the story of her mother's dilemma over her lost son, thinking that perhaps he can help.  Martin, who had openly said he wasn't interested in doing human interest story as he considered them nothing but fluff, brushes her off. But later, when pondering his options, he finds himself drawn back to Jane's idea. He gets her name and number from another friend and calls her to set up a meeting with Philomena, and soon they're off, going first to the convent in Ireland, where Martin learns firsthand just what Philomena has been up against.I can't speak of what subsequently unfolds plot-wise without spoiling the revelations and discoveries that are made, but a lot of what makes the film so enjoyable is simply watching Dench and Coogan's mismatched characters interact with each other. Where Martin is world-weary, a bit cynical and of a suspicious nature, Philomena is trusting, irrepressibly chatty, and finds delight in the simplest things, all of which tends to drive Martin up the wall. But in spite of the first impression that we first get of her, as the film progresses Philomena reveals that she's far from naive about life, having moments where she shows a remarkably clear-eyed view of the world (particularly when it comes to sex). It's simply that she refuses to let the bad things that have happened to her color her view of everything else in life. But this attitude, while in some ways admirable, is not very helpful when one is up against forces that are deliberately trying to prevent people from digging up the past, and this is where Martin's suspicious nature proves its worth as he begins to examine the stories they're being told and openly question their veracity, a thing Philomena by nature is not capable of. But what truly works more than anything else is the way Dench's Philomena is delightfully funny even though she's not trying to be, completely oblivious to the way she's coming across to Martin, while Coogan's Martin is hopelessly inept at being funny, most especially when he's trying to be, one of those unfortunate individuals who cannot tell a joke to save their life. It's a comic chemistry of a very human kind, made completely natural by two superb actors at the top of their form.Also worth mentioning is the beautiful film score by Alexandre Desplat that heightens the mood without intruding on or distracting from the events on screen, and the cinematography by Robbie Ryan that really captures the intimacy of the story and the characters involved.On a side note, it helps if you can find Peter Mullan's 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters, which is all about the Magdalene Asylums and their decades-long horrendous abuses of vulnerable young Irish women, most notably forcibly taking their children away from them and compelling the women to work in the institution's laundries which the nuns operated as a commercial enterprise, reaping the profits while the women working in them got nothing. The parts of Philomena that only touch on those abuses fall into greater context if you've seen the earlier film.Highly, highly recommended as an engaging film on every level, a very human story worth hearing, and for the wonderfully mismatched chemistry between Dench and Coogan's characters.",5,A path of many twists and turns that keeps you engaged every minute of the way,1385942400,"12 2,
