There's a former college roommate, a nude yoga instructor and a shy nerd co-worker.  Also a high-paid callboy, who actually knows three of the others through his work.It's a film about gay male relationships, borrowing a bit of the dynamic from both ""Love! Valour! Compassion"" and ""Boys In The Band,"" and actually does a good job briefly tackling such topics such as ageism, monogamous vs ""open"" relationships, how having come-of-age during the worst of the AIDS epidemic has affected gay baby boomers, self-image and spirituality.  There's the drama of a relationship falling apart, and the joy of another one beginning, right before their eyes. That's a lot to cram into 84 minutes, and, as a result, the plot is somewhat light overall, although the acting is above average, the production values and direction excellent for a low budget gay film.  DVD includes extensive extras, including deleted and extended scenes, bloopers, music video, director commentary and cast interviews.

It could have been good -- maybe with a good editing and an out-loud read thru. Much of the dialogue, which should have been good, was just stilted--unreal. Most of the actors were anything but, we're talking middle-school level, but most were very attractive and we get to see most of them naked or close to. Daniel Rhyder as the male prostitute was a poor choice. I wouldn't pay him. He's not ugly, but he's skinny and shapeless and why pay someone like that for sex? A far better choice would have been the actor--Joel Harrison--that played Cameron, a gorgeous young hunk with an amazing body (who was also a far better actor). The movie was very very preach-ie. I don't mind a message, but for goodness sake, 100 messages shoved down my throat every other minute in fortune cookie language just got boring. It is a ""talking heads"" movie. I didn't believe these were real people, just puppets to deliver the author's message--and that get's boring instead of meaningful. So much was just totally unbelievable. The characters all speak the same with the same voices, even though they are supposed to be different people. The soundtrack is pretty wretched. It is stuffed with lousy un-funny lines and cliches, like: ""It's a business doing pleasure with you,"" and lots and lots of ""come/cum"" jokes. Oh well, nothing is perfect.

Put eight gay men into one log cabin, and have all the stereotypical gay neurosis emerge.

Scenes felt forced, and whilst there were moments of excellent scripting, the actors failed horribly in delivering the content in a manner which I expect the writer had originally envisaged.The sex and nudity was gratuitous, and served no purpose what so ever to the story. Whilst perversely some of the scenes which required nudity seemed obviously choreographed to avoid such. The script was stretched with moments of grandeur and insight.

There is another young man but he is a plain looking tall skinny guy who falls for an older, short pudgy yoga instructor. They kiss. Some partial nudity but no sex scenes; not even simulated. They do go to bed with one another but you cannot see any action. Since they are predominantly older men who are not particularly great looking, you most likely wouldn't want to see their fully naked bodies anyway. There are no erotic sex scenes. There is a little nudity. Even the 'hustler' is old and ugly! The sound quality is very poor. The only thing that resembles a plot is when a couple splits up because of the hustler.
