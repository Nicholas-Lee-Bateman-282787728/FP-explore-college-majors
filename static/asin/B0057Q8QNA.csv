At least the music unions could, because we know they didn't pay to clear the music either!!The official fifth season of The Lucy Show will be released on December 6th.  On that upcoming release, the episodes have been beautifully remastered in HD from the film negatives.  They look like night and day when compared to this cheap release.",1,MORE LUCY SHOW BOOTLEGS!!,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,455,"['Do', 'not', 'buy', 'are', 'terrible', 'quality', 'are', 'illegal', 'bootlegs', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'shut', 'companies', 'down', 'least', 'music', 'unions', 'could', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'clear', 'music', 'official', 'fifth', 'season', 'Lucy', 'Show', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'December', '6th', 'upcoming', 'release', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'HD', 'film', 'negatives', 'look', 'night', 'day', 'when', 'compared', 'cheap', 'release']",Lucy - A Legacy of Laughter

I have not watched all four at this time but the ones I have watched have been excellant quality both in picture and sound.

That's no reflection on it, (just personal opinion) Still had laughs and it is a fine product. I wasn't totally thrilled with how the dvds were in the dvd case. All in seperate sleeves so you have to pop out the top ones out if you are looking to get to the bottom dvd. Not a huge deal. Just not as nice as some. But overall I was satisfied. And I enjoyed the 5 episodes on the 4th disc of ""Life with Elizabeth"" with Betty White :) The shipping was fast, the condition perfect!",5,Satisfied!,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,547,"['did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', ""'as"", 'much', 'seasons', 'love', 'Lucy', 'reflection', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Still', 'had', 'laughs', 'fine', 'product', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'thrilled', 'how', 'dvds', 'were', 'dvd', 'case', 'seperate', 'sleeves', 'so', 'have', 'pop', 'out', 'top', 'ones', 'out', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'bottom', 'dvd', 'Not', 'huge', 'deal', 'Just', 'not', 'as', 'nice', 'overall', 'was', 'satisfied', 'enjoyed', '5', 'episodes', '4th', 'disc', 'Life', 'Elizabeth', 'Betty', 'White', 'shipping', 'was', 'fast', 'condition', 'perfect']",Lucy - A Legacy of Laughter
