So my question is: How do you make a movie like this, with a couple of big name stars, and make so many stupid decisions?Here's the scoop. Djimon Hounsou is an ex-operative on hire from a father to wipe out a gang of Bangkokian sex traffickers who did his baby girl bad. He finds himself with a mysterious, young, female sidekick, and before you can say Bangkokian sex traffickers, he finds himself in the middle of a gang war. He approaches another British ex-operative, played by Kevin Bacon, to supply the arms to win said war.If there was really a need to make the arms dealer British then why not hire a Brit to play the role? It didn't seem germane to the story so why not make Kevin Bacon a Yank and not have him perform the awful Limey accent. Stupid stuff abounds throughout this movie. The fight scenes are choreographed poorly and the story just doesn't progress all that smoothly. And what's with the other-worldly aspect? It would have had more heart had Hounsou's sidekick been real flesh and blood. That was a cheap card to play.Sorry. This fails on too many levels. I was wondering why I'd never heard of it.

1395504,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004BR7XGM,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Human trafficking and child prostitution are the focal points of this very dark, noisy, brutally frank film, and if those preliminary adjectives don't deter then there are a few reasons to watch this direct to DVD film, mainly the contribution of producer/star Djimon Hounsou.  Thai director Prachya Pinkaew holds this slaughter of the bad guys together fairly well and the minimal script by Kevin Bernhardt attempts to infuse the bitter story with a dollop of mysticism (the title is the clue).  The acting by a very large cast of Thai actors is basically relegated to shooting and getting shot so there isn't a lot of character development possible.The setting is Bangkok where Curtie Church (Djimon Hounsou) who is a prolific professional assassin who has accumulating a sizable cash reserve from his trade. His impressive store of weapons (a larger cash of bizarre guns has never been so visible!) is provided by his English arms dealer Jimmy (Kevin Bacon). Curtie wishes to retire from his sordid role and is on his last assignment when he is joined by a strange and beautiful young girl name Mae (Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul). During the completion of his final score, Curtie is annoyed by Mae who wonders why the assassin is killing in the first place. Curtie admits it is for the money, but the somewhat ethereal Mae informs him that other evil men need his expertise and brand of justice: Curtie becomes involved in a mission to stop the trafficking of child prostitutes by eliminating those who deal in human flesh.For the most part the film is about killing and is a constant stream of assassinations by a variety to weapons and chases. Hounsou is solid, manages to capture some tenderness in his relationship with Pitakporntrakul, and the efforts to make the film have mystical effects almost works at times.  Kevin Bacon does his best in a thankless role but is bogged down with a twitchy British accent. This is definitely not a film for the easily disturbed, but for proponents of action and mounting killings the film should satisfy. And it does address the ongoing global problem of sex trafficking. Maybe someone will notice this problem soon.

1395508,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004BR7XGM,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","This is an unusual movie. Not entirely action/thriller, not entirely surreal/eastern philosophy. If one were to blend the classic action flick 'First Blood' with the deeply intense Anglo-Thai cult film 'Brokedown Palace' - you'll get a sense of what awaits you.Very much enjoyed because of both aspects: The hardcore one-man-special-forces-wrecking-crew, which was really good. And the ... other element. No spoilers, but it caught me off-guard and that unexpected slice of the evanescent really spun a stock plotline and flung it into an interesting tale of pure revenge and eternal devotion.I've mentioned elsewhere what a fantastic badass Djimon Hounsou is when portraying a gunslinger/sword swinger. The guy is solid steel, an absolutely no doubt rock-steady dude. I'm very grateful to any production company and director that can see his ability to carry the load as sole lead. He doesn't need to sidekick with another more recognizable actor as 'insurance'. Sadly, this ability isn't recognized by many and hence we're often left with half a performance. That's not to say that's all bad, his stints with Leo DiCaprio in 'Blood Diamond' and Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator' were very good. But half is always half - and his onscreen presence can deliver so much more.And Kevin Bacon's turn as an British expatriate arms dealers equals that of his homosexual informant in 'JFK' - a nuanced and amusingly slimy performance that somehow makes likable an unlikable and difficult character. These jobs are usually tasked to a Steve Buscemi-type so I was surprised at how good he was in the role. I hope he takes on more of these as I'm intrigued at the possibilities of the one-time pretty boy finding equal success as a character actor.There seems to be no end to the amazing beauties that populate the Thai film industry - Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul is pretty much par for the course, if par is stunningly delicious.That this production was staged outside of the US may be a silver lining to Honsou's career. There was a time when six-pack actors like Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson left Hollywood for the dry deserts of Spain and found career rebirths. I like to think that these asian studios are the modern equivalent for many actors and directors.

Kevin Bacon and Djimon Hounsou are obviously the big draw here.Straight to DVD fair is getting better and better as of late, and this one is no exception.  The DVD is a bare bones affair no bells and whistles, but the direction, cinematography, sound and foley work is all top notch, and the acting is stellar!  The story is of Hounsou who it's alluded to as being a USA government agent who is on a holiday in Bangkok and moonlighting as a hired gun.  He is hired by a desperate father to avenge his daughter, and all hell breaks loose.  Hounsou is a strong lead, and dominates the screen.  Kevin Bacon plays an old acquaintance of Djimon's character and a weapons dealer in Bangkok, a very solid supporting role to say the least.

Kevin Bacon (who has the single WORST accent I have heard in years) plays the gun-running buddy/sidekick. The story has some razor thin plot lines as to why any of this is actually happening or why they keep killing when the story ran out long before, but Hounsou gives a concerted effort here and proves he is better than the whole of what was trying to get accomplished.There are no special features and the TrueHD was mixed average to horribly (a lot of bad voice dubbing and remixing). But the picture quality is what sells this. The majority of the film is at night with a great deal of action and killing, so even with plenty of chances to falter it does not. The lines are solid, there is no grain and the lighting actually shines perfectly (for the scenes that were being made anyway). Some nice footage of Bangkok is preserved here and might be worth the watch for the fans of Hounsou and/or Bangkok films.The cover art is incorrect: (Hounsou and Bacon never look like that in the movie - both with facial hair and clothing) that gun/scope is never in the film, and it says Region 1; three strikes or more on cover art shows to me they could care less about marketing the film. 1.5 stars for the film and 1.5 for the picture clarity.

In Siam, kings would offer them as gifts to someone who was obnoxious so they would go broke attempting the up keep. The movie deals with the child prostitution trafficking in Thailand as a background, but does very little to expose the horrors, but rather concentrates on killing.A man hires Djmon Hounsou to find his abducted daughter working somewhere in a Thai brothel. He also has a bounty for every bad guy that is killed. Djmon contacts Kevin Bacon, now with a British accent, in order to obtain guns. Bacon runs a legit brothel and formally worked with Djmon. Using the weapons, Hounsou is able to start a war between two rival gangs. The head count increases.During his campaign, a girl joins up with him and helps him with some spiritual guidance, as well as a look out. There are minor twists as people and alliances are not quite what they seem, with one major twist at the end I admit I didn't see coming.There is a missed opportunity in this film for a little humor. Kevin Bacon collects guns used in movies. What they should have mentioned were guns used specifically in Bacon movies. They did not.Hounsou play a stone cold killer who wants to make things right while getting paid. His acting ability is better than the Rock, but below that of Van Diesel.

He has been hired by a distraught father whose daughter has been abducted by some drug gang where by they turn her into an addict as her introduction to being trafficked onto the sex industry. Where she winds up on a mortuary slab.So as retribution he pays him to kill six for a fixed bounty. Church duly obliges and attracts the attention of one of the girls, who follows him and becomes a sort of partner, Mae. The grieving father then asks for a bit more revenge and Church is starting to feel empathy for the girls so he signs up. This time he needs some new weaponry and where better to go than an International Arms Dealer in the shape of Jimmy `The Brit' (Kevin Bacon) who after an initial reticence agrees to hire some kick butt guns that the army would be proud of. A word on Mr Bacon, I have immense respect for him as an actor, but he really could have done with a language coach on his Mary Poppins attempts at an English accent. It is dubbed at one point and then he starts to sound like a lost Australian, pretty poor and verging on the embarrassing.Meanwhile Churchy has declared war on the gangs who have formed an uneasy alliance to find out who is killing them all. Church and Mae take up residence at a Buddhist Temple which he uses to launch his attacks from and we get lots of Eastern wisdom from the ephemeral Mae.This is a very full on action film, the action is pretty much there right from the start and is actually really good though not gratuitous. There are a few twists in the plot but nothing heart stopping and some nudity but mainly incidental which you would expect in a film of this nature. The few plot holes are forgivable until the end and that is where you have to do a rather large leap of faith to believe what has happened, I can not say what, as it is a plot spoiler. So for a ninety minute action fest with some decent plot and questionable accents, this is the one for you. If you can live with that and the plot holes then you should enjoy, but I felt it was just OK, hence the rating but will still give Mr Bacon another chance as he still tends to deliver in most of his films.",3,"Kidnap, Hit men, Landfill and Elephants in this Thai Based Action Fest!",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2227,"['set', 'Bangkok', 'story', 'Curtie', 'Church', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'hired', 'hit', 'man', 'been', 'hired', 'distraught', 'father', 'daughter', 'been', 'abducted', 'drug', 'gang', 'where', 'turn', 'addict', 'introduction', 'being', 'trafficked', 'sex', 'industry', 'Where', 'up', 'mortuary', 'slab.So', 'retribution', 'kill', 'six', 'fixed', 'bounty', 'Church', 'duly', 'obliges', 'attention', 'one', 'girls', 'who', 'sort', 'partner', 'Mae', 'grieving', 'father', 'then', 'bit', 'more', 'revenge', 'Church', 'starting', 'feel', 'empathy', 'girls', 'signs', 'up', 'time', 'new', 'weaponry', 'where', 'better', 'go', 'International', 'Arms', 'Dealer', 'shape', 'Jimmy', 'Brit', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'initial', 'reticence', 'hire', 'kick', 'butt', 'guns', 'army', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'word', 'Mr', 'Bacon', 'have', 'immense', 'respect', 'actor', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'language', 'coach', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'attempts', 'English', 'accent', 'dubbed', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'sound', 'lost', 'Australian', 'pretty', 'poor', 'verging', 'embarrassing.Meanwhile', 'Churchy', 'declared', 'war', 'gangs', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killing', 'Church', 'Mae', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'Buddhist', 'Temple', 'launch', 'attacks', 'get', 'lots', 'Eastern', 'wisdom', 'ephemeral', 'Mae.This', 'very', 'full', 'action', 'film', 'action', 'pretty', 'much', 'there', 'right', 'start', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'plot', 'nothing', 'heart', 'stopping', 'nudity', 'mainly', 'incidental', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'nature', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'forgivable', 'end', 'where', 'have', 'do', 'rather', 'large', 'leap', 'faith', 'believe', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'So', 'ninety', 'minute', 'action', 'fest', 'decent', 'plot', 'questionable', 'accents', 'one', 'can', 'live', 'plot', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'hence', 'rating', 'will', 'still', 'give', 'Mr', 'Bacon', 'chance', 'still', 'deliver', 'most', 'films']",Elephant White

What you don't have is the usual B list action stars. Instead of them, you get two names, Djimon Hounsou and Kevin Bacon.""Elephant White"" stars twice Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (""In America"" ""Blood Diamond"") as Curtie Church, who works as a mercenary/contract killer in Bangkok. He takes a job from a Thai businessman Rajahdon (Sahajak Boonthanakit), whose daughter is kidnapped and murdered by a local gang. Kevin Bacon plays Jimmy, an arms dealer with a Jason Statham-like accent, who reluctantly collaborates with Church.The script is so confusing and often frustratingly underwritten that we are not allowed to know our hero's motive for what he does in the first place. It even attempts to weave serious social issues like human trafficking into the thin story by introducing a mysterious girl named Mae (Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul), a drug addict and former prostitute, who witnesses Church killing the targets. Their relationship lacks any emotional punch and the film's weak conclusion (with a twist or two) is just weird.""Elephant White"" is directed by Prachya Pinkaew, best known for Tony Jaa films ""Ong Bak"" and ""Warrior King"" as well as ""Chocolate"" starring JeeJa Yanin.
