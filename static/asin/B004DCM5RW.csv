1396800,A26QQHF9T6ODUB,B004DCM5RW,Melanie Stepp Lane,"[7, 9]","Disgusting. I could say it over and over again. This movie is so irritating, it's--you guessed it--disgusting. These Disney stars trade in their Wizard wands and golden microphones for ""easy upchuck"" medicine and foul mouths. To hear them cry ""you narccisstic b----h"" and ""He sounds like an a--"" in their squeaky little high-pitched voices isn't just offensive, it's stupid. Honestly? It's like hearing 6th and 7th graders cuss out their friends. That's what these girls look like, too...grade-schoolers instead of seniors. There's very few redemptive qualities: Jo shrugs off Mandi's tormenting (until the Plastics hurt Jo's dad...then she makes Mandi's life miserable). Jo is made fun of for being a virgin, but then people tell her secretly they wish they'd waited too. Jo has a good relationship with her dad. She doesn't want to accept money for being friends with a girl, but soon after she does take it she feels guilty and returns it. The soundtrack isn't spectacular, but it has some good tracks.On the other hand, you have the bad: Mandi is a seemingly perfect little princess, but she's spiteful and vindictive. She proudly admits ""I'm a benevolent dictator"" and is thoroughly obsessed with herself. Chastity is the complete opposite of what her name means, as she has a ""raging libido"" and is ""stupid enough to hit a home run with any guy who was willing to play"". We see her passionately kissing several boys in isolated areas such as a stairwell ""a herpes disaster waiting to happen"". The plastics use everything from sex to money, compliments to sabotage to get exactly what they want. Jo, for all her good qualities, is a foul-mouthed tomboy who steals Mandi's popularity by wearing immodest rocker clothes (but of course, they have to be trendy--thus the bright yellow flowers and lacy frills and girly accents. Right.).For the utterly ridiculous aspects, there's plenty: The show-down, a game of powerpuff football...huh??? The plastics do not deliver a particularly memorable performance in their popular girl roles. They seem more like mediocre superstar wannabes. Their clothes don't really pop or stand out; they seem to blend. There's just not much to differentiate between the populars and the ""normal"" people, except perhaps the be in the in crowd you must be completely evil and wear pink. There's also no explanation as to why the Plastics are...well, the Plastics. They aren't involved in anything at the school...sports, cheerleading, no class president-status...they aren't the principal's kids and their parents aren't the richest. I suppose it must be that they ruin people's lives. But honestly, if some punk freshman with no real power started playing the pranks on everyone, trying to be top dog, wouldn't the older kids put them in their place in the real wrold? Maiara Walsh, who plays Mandi, gives the best effort. She's gorgeous and brunette (always nice to see the ""it"" girl with dark hair, not blonde) and her voice is deeper than you would expect--not the normal high-pitched whine. The storyline is predictable, shallow, and boring. If I could, I'd give it a negative five stars. Wish I hadn't wasted so much time watching it.

I never go into a sequel comparing it to the original.  If this movie had been made using a different name, and was considered an individual movie in it's own right, then I'm sure there wouldn't be as many complaints.  I think this movie was a lot of fun.  How could anyone not love the character of sweet Abby.  My heart went out to her every time she was treated badly, and I found myself wanting to protect her from the meanies.  I also think Jo was a cool character.  I love how she was a sassy, streetwise smart girl who could do anything the boys could do.  There was also more romance in this movie than there had been in the first one.  I admit the dumb character Chastity didn't do as good a job as Amanda Seyfried did in the first movie, and the queen bee Mandi didn't quite have the edge of Rachel Mcadams, but I think you understand Mandi's motives in this movie better than Regina.  I never did understand why Regina was so mean.  The friendship between Jo and Abby was also nicer than the one between Janis and Cady in the first movie.

However, this was not the case with this movie.  A semi innocent outsider comes into a new high school wanting to have a year free of drama before she finishes her last year before heading off to Carnegie Mellon.  She's a tough girl, so she seems, not caring what others think and has her quirky interests (shop class) where she doesn't have to contend with other women/girls for attentions.  And then she meets a loveable gal named Abby who is clumbsy and awkward, and oddly enough, from a wealthy family.  Her father eventually pays Jo (our hero) to be Abby's friend.  Then the Mean Girls clique, headed by the slightly dimwitted Mandy, is out to get her.  Jo and her friends then form their own clique, calling themselves the Anti-Plastics, in an effort to usurp the Plastics powers and control.The story itself had some potential, but it was ruined by fair acting and not being very strong a plot to begin with.

At one point it was a High School Animal Farm where the non-plastics were as bad as the plastics, and at other times it was about friendship.The movie starts out at about 4 stars and digresses to no stars during a female football game that made no sense.

When Jo stands up for Abby (Stone) at school, Abby's dad offers to pay for her college (which her dad can't afford) if she will be Abby's friend.  I will start by saying I thought the first one was really funny.  Tim Meadows is the only returning cast member from the original, and the best part of the movie.  This one took everything that was funny and great about the first one and replaced it with the ""New Plastics"" just being evil.  Not like first mean girl mean, but out right evil!  There were a few scenes that made me chuckle but overall I felt bad for everyone in the school.  If this is how high school girls really act now, private or home school is the way to go.  I also think I am probebly 20 years to old to fully relate, and a guy, so I did not enjoy it.  No big surprises here, very predictable and not very funny.  It does have the obligatory ""Saved by the bell"" story arc and ending.  Evil, evil girls, decent message.
