That's the DVD business. And that's certainly MASH, who milked this series way past the ripe period to bilk it for all they could money-wise. By the time this final episode came out I watched it merely out of curiousity to see how they'd put this bastard child of its original idendity to sleep. It didn't displease as far as that goes, since it continued it's sappiness, extremely over the top acting and storylines, and frankly, going for the jugular for tears. But that's what MASH had been since season 4, evolving into that format with each season until culmiinating into ""Goodbye, Farewell, Amen."" I suppose by comparison to the final 7 seasons this wasn't so bad. It was at least consistent so there were no surprises. And to be fair, it wasn't as bad as I'd expected. But that ain't no ringing endorsement. In their overreaching attempts at pacifism, they did to Hawkeye in this final episode what they'd done to the series long before the airing of this program. Make no mistake, MASH had from the start made anti-war statements. But at one time it was done with some of the cleverest writing in TV history, and with some of the funniest dark humor, just like the movie it was based on. But like most writers of final episodes, this one seems to reveal that they just got too caught up in themselves in pandering to the audience's emotions rather than simply writing good material. Their decisions as to how to send of the various main characters (of which Klinger and Father Mulcahy were never really worthy of, particularly with their horrible acting) were reaching, but not really surprising, as was the writing for some time. And the other main characters fate's were interesting at best. This episode wasn't necessarily bad by the standards it had set up to this point. It's just that it was anti-climactic. So why the complaints? What did you really expect? Well, if you expected more, you got it with ""After MASH,"" the final smear on the once solid brand name of MASH.",2,"At this point, what more was there to complain about?

I've noticed a few sour grapes reviews because they went ahead and bought Season 11 before they ever knew they were gonna release &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen&#34;, with awesome extras. Well, that stinks for them, because this 3 disc set is totally worth it. The extras are amazing!! It has the Shelley Long(Who guest-starred in an episode of M*A*S*H, before her own run on an all time classic), hosting a retrospective from 1991, I think it was, which was terrific. The 30th Anniversary Reunion Special from 2002 is also included, and is very informative. And it's cool to see the whole cast minus Linville and Stevenson because they were deceased, unfortunately, sitting around and talking over all the old, good times. They have on the set footage, and the last day of filming footage. Just excellent stuff. The one exta I was slightly disappointed with was the bloopers. They were only of Alan Alda and Mike Farrell, mainly, and only like 3 or 4 minutes long. Why no bloopers from the other actors?? It'd be awesome to see some of Alda and Rogers, or Steveson, or Linville, or Swit, or anybody else. But, that doean't deter this awesome release.

I got home and noticed there weren't any. I reasoned that MASH was good enough without all of the extras on it's own.I saw this in the store and thought it was the same as the one I already had but cheaper ($14.95 while season Eleven is usually around $19.95) and then realized that this was the finale plus assorted extras, not season 11.The best of the extras is a ""Biography"" of MASH from the Biography channel giving a pretty good timeline of MASH from book to movie to tv and the recruiting of and eventual departure of certain key members of the cast. Even the failed spin-off, ""AfterMASH"" is recalled here.The 30 year Anniversary Special reunites the cast, minus Larry Linville and Mclean Stevenson who had passed on.Also noteworthy is an earlier special hosted by Shelley Long (Diane Chambers on Cheers).The rest of these extras are a little on the tedious side:There are some bloopers mostly reaturing Alan Alda and Mike Farrell. These are bloopers that repeat the same scene and the same mistakes too many times and should've included the other cast members as well.A segment of PSA's (Public Service Announcements) for charities featuring Mike Farrell which made me wonder if the dvd player was stuck on repeat. Each PSA is practically a carbon copy of the one before it and when shown back to back the effect is almost annoying.Also each cast member names their favorite episodes. Usually this is where they first joined the others or where the writers began to give certain charcters more lines. Hot Lips engagement...BJ's first day...Potter's arrival...etcThe trivia quiz is really dumb with the easiest questions you could imagine. No challenge whatsoever.The main complaint about putting all of these features on all in one set is overkill. The interviews here within are compiled from anywhere from the early days of the show until 30 years later and don't appear to be put together for the dvd. As a result many of these interviews say the same thing.Be prepared for the cast of your favorite show to give numerous interviews in which the main point that is stressed was the way the show uniquely combined comedy and drama, which may be commendable but after it's repeated several times gets a bit monotonous. Also the development of each character is discussed somewhat at length and this too can become a bit much. But stil, overall it's much better than anything else before or since and maybe they have reason to pat themselves on the back.",5,Could Use An Editor,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,2812,"['came', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'bargain', 'bin', '7.95', 'piece', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'would', 'include', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'first', 'season', 'Col', 'Potter', 'BJ', 'classic', 'MASH', 'irresistible.I', 'bought', 'season', '11', 'buying', 'others', 'order', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'store', 'were', 'extras', 'got', 'home', 'noticed', 'were', ""n't"", 'reasoned', 'MASH', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'extras', 'own.I', 'saw', 'store', 'thought', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'already', 'had', 'cheaper', '14.95', 'season', 'Eleven', 'usually', 'around', '19.95', 'then', 'realized', 'was', 'finale', 'assorted', 'extras', 'not', 'season', '11.The', 'best', 'extras', 'Biography', 'MASH', 'Biography', 'channel', 'giving', 'pretty', 'good', 'timeline', 'MASH', 'book', 'movie', 'tv', 'recruiting', 'eventual', 'departure', 'certain', 'key', 'members', 'cast', 'Even', 'failed', 'spin-off', 'AfterMASH', 'recalled', 'here.The', '30', 'year', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'cast', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'Mclean', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'had', 'passed', 'on.Also', 'noteworthy', 'earlier', 'special', 'hosted', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Cheers', '.The', 'rest', 'extras', 'are', 'little', 'tedious', 'side', 'are', 'bloopers', 'mostly', 'reaturing', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'are', 'bloopers', 'repeat', 'same', 'scene', 'same', 'mistakes', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'should', ""'ve"", 'included', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'well.A', 'segment', 'PSA', 'Public', 'Service', 'Announcements', 'charities', 'featuring', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'made', 'wonder', 'dvd', 'player', 'was', 'stuck', 'repeat', 'PSA', 'practically', 'carbon', 'copy', 'one', 'when', 'shown', 'back', 'back', 'effect', 'almost', 'annoying.Also', 'cast', 'member', 'names', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Usually', 'where', 'first', 'joined', 'others', 'where', 'writers', 'began', 'give', 'certain', 'charcters', 'more', 'lines', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'engagement', 'BJ', 'first', 'day', 'Potter', 'arrival', 'trivia', 'quiz', 'really', 'dumb', 'easiest', 'questions', 'could', 'imagine', 'challenge', 'whatsoever.The', 'main', 'complaint', 'putting', 'features', 'one', 'set', 'overkill', 'interviews', 'here', 'are', 'compiled', 'anywhere', 'early', 'days', 'show', '30', 'years', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'dvd', 'result', 'many', 'interviews', 'say', 'same', 'thing.Be', 'prepared', 'cast', 'favorite', 'show', 'give', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'main', 'point', 'stressed', 'was', 'way', 'show', 'uniquely', 'combined', 'comedy', 'drama', 'may', 'be', 'commendable', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'bit', 'monotonous', 'Also', 'development', 'character', 'discussed', 'somewhat', 'length', 'too', 'can', 'become', 'bit', 'much', 'stil', 'overall', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'maybe', 'have', 'reason', 'pat', 'back']",N/A

I'm glad that I don't have to buy that box set now just to get the bonus extras.  So, I guess I'll just have to cough up another 20 bucks just to get the bonus features.  Another 20 plus bucks!

I quickly decided I didn't need the bonus features and moved on with my life. Then I heard about Fox's special release of the series finale, and was glad the studio was throwing us a bone.Then I actually walked into the store on release day, and balked at that expensive bone.Objectively, this is a fine set for both the casual and hardcore fan. Tying the bonus materials to a series finale release draws in additional sales that wouldn't be possible if this was the bonus materials alone. It's a gift set, if you will. Nice slim packaging, nice graphics. The best-produced MASH set outside of the Martinis and Medicine box. You kinda wish the other seasons were this slim.Fox also did a great job digging through the archives for material. All the major documentaries are here, including Memories of Mash, the 30th reunion, the A&E; special. The docs rely too heavily on series clips at times, but otherwise the info is there. There are classic PSAs and episode promos, and the legendary unproduced script where two nurses trick Hawkeye into thinking he's gotten them both pregnant (it was deemed too risque to film, and it's a hoot to read). There's also a blooper reel, but it's a fraction of the known bloopers out there. What happened to the other stuff? About the only other thing I would've liked to see would be the IBM commercials starring the MASH cast, but Fox probably doesn't own those.So it's a great, comprehensive, inclusive set of extras - but again, it's a heavy sticker price! I'm sure Fox had the option to make this set even a few dollars cheaper, and they didn't take it. That's disappointing.I bought it. I still question if it was fully worth the price, but I have it now and that's that.
