The movie was about a group of dwarf vampires who attack the ankles.  As they say in the movie, they're &quot;3 feet tall with 2 inch fangs and an undying thirst for blood.&quot; Haha.  Only see this if you want to laugh at a corny, low-budget film and not for serious purposes.",3,"Really bad, but hilarious",1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,425,"['only', 'rented', 'movie', 'laugh', 'how', 'bad', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'yes', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'was', 'laughing', 'whole', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'group', 'dwarf', 'vampires', 'who', 'attack', 'ankles', 'say', 'movie', ""'re"", 'quot', '3', 'feet', 'tall', '2', 'inch', 'fangs', 'undying', 'thirst', 'blood.', 'quot', 'Haha', 'Only', 'see', 'want', 'laugh', 'corny', 'low-budget', 'film', 'not', 'serious', 'purposes']",Ankle Biters

Yuck!  Repulsive.  Redundant.  Horrible performances, script and direction.  You can tell from the opening you're in for a trash ride.  Not even a great ""B"" movie.

It has the crystallized douchieness of the early 2000's, late 90s, &#34;Nu-Metal&#34; era in there, along with the horrible acting and midget vampires.  This is a must see for fans of bad movies.  I really like that the lead actor and director's parents did the catering.

732018,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00007M5J9,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 4]","Vampire dwarves invade a small southern town.  They obtain possession of a sword that has traces of the blood of the last full sized vampire (dwarf vampires can only infect other dwarves.  You should have known that) and plot havoc and, presumably, world domination.  At least minions of full-sized vampire subjects.  Half-vampire, half-human Drexel, with dwarf sidekick T-Bone, combine to battle the evil dwarves.ANKLE BITERS is pretty dreadful.  Everything from acting to editing to the script is below average, is some cases way below.  If you're looking for a real vampire hunter movie check out BLADE or JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.  The dwarves are a nice twist, but the movie doesn't come near to having a clue about what to do with them.",2,Three foot tall with two inch fangs,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,743,"['Vampire', 'invade', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'obtain', 'possession', 'sword', 'traces', 'blood', 'last', 'full', 'sized', 'vampire', 'dwarf', 'vampires', 'can', 'only', 'infect', 'other', 'dwarves', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'plot', 'havoc', 'presumably', 'world', 'domination', 'least', 'minions', 'full-sized', 'vampire', 'subjects', 'Half-vampire', 'half-human', 'Drexel', 'dwarf', 'sidekick', 'T-Bone', 'combine', 'battle', 'evil', 'dwarves.ANKLE', 'BITERS', 'pretty', 'dreadful', 'Everything', 'acting', 'editing', 'script', 'below', 'average', 'cases', 'way', ""'re"", 'looking', 'real', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'BLADE', 'JOHN', 'CARPENTER', 'VAMPIRES', 'dwarves', 'are', 'nice', 'twist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'come', 'having', 'clue', 'what', 'do']",Ankle Biters
