(2004), which did have its charms, but not to the point where I'd watch it again anytime soon.  Written, directed, and produced by Cody Jarrett (Surfbroads, Sugar Boxx), the film stars Kristi Russell (Chasing Indigo, Surfbroads), an actress who doesn't seem to mind showing some skin (she's got a great rack), as it were, at least in terms of this film, which is the only feature I've ever seen her in...also appearing is Ariadne Shaffer (Beneath the Mississippi), Robert Patrick Brink (The Perfect Wife), Michael McConnohie, primarily known, it seems, for his voice over work on such video games as those in the Xenosaga series, and Mary Woronov (Rock 'n' Roll High School, Eating Raoul).After a somewhat pointless opening picnic sequence (a kid finds a bowling ball sized tadpole in a nearby pond) we move into the opening credits to which we see two nekkid women getting it on...kind of, if you consider `getting it on' to consist of a whole lot of licking...turns out one of them is Dr. Barbara Michaels (Russell), while the other is her slightly butch girlfriend named Trixie (Shaffer).  Seems Michaels, an agent for the EPA, has come to Jerkwater, U.S.A. to investigate complaints of polluted water, which I'm guessing is ultimately the cause of the ginormous tadpole we saw earlier.  Her investigations eventually lead her to a nearby company called Grimes Chemicals, run by an overly hostile man named Huntley Grimes (McConnohie), who, in fact, is responsible given the fact he's been ordering some of his flunkie workers to bury toxic byproducts in a nearby field.  Here are a few tips for those irresponsible manufacturers looking to skirt the laws by illegally dumping their manufacturing wastes...1. Ensure your company's name isn't plastered across the 55-gallon drums in which the toxic waste to be illegally dumped is stored.2. It's probably best not to have the guys hauling the toxic waste to be illegally dumped doing so in a company truck, with the company's name on the side.3. It's probably best not to have the guys doing the dumping to be wearing t-shirts with the company name clearly printed on the front.Anyway, as I mentioned, Michaels investigation eventually leads her to Grimes Chemical, but she soon hit a roadblock (figuratively speaking) as the local sheriff, a man named Buford Lawson (Brink), has ties to the chemical company owner.  As a major health crisis begins to develop (some people are becoming ill from exposure), Michaels has her research stolen, but not before she manages to send off some samples to the home office for further tests.  Eventually things get a whole lot goofy as frog man begins popping up around town, one who seems only interested in mating with female humans, and eventually things come to a head once the amphibious humanoid makes his appearance at a local high school football game, one the whole town is attending.Now in watching this film, it was fairly obvious to me it was intended as a spoof of the low budget, schlocky creature features shown throughout the 1970s, so, given this, I'm guessing most of that which I'd normally consider bad here (the acting, the story, the dialogue) to be bad intentionally so...given that, my biggest gripe about the movie is that there isn't more of the frog creature in it...he doesn't appear until well into the story, and even then his appearances are limited.  He does make a good showing in the last ten minutes but by then it felt like too little, too late.  The frog suit isn't particularly convincing (it truly looks like a guy in a frog suit), but again, I think this was another aspect that was meant to come off as did, so I went with it.  Another element of the production I though could have used a little work was the pacing.  Director Jarrett seems more interested, at times, in filming the lesbian scenes than he did furthering the plot, although I can't blame him all that much as the women were attractive.  There is some nekkidness but hardly any blood as there's only one scene where someone actually gets killed by the frog man (there's actually two frog related deaths in the film).  The production values (except for the frog suit) are decent enough for an independent feature like this, so no complaints from me there.  The funniest bit, for me at least, comes near the end as the frog man shows up at the local football game.  While the game is being played the frog man appears on the field and clotheslines a receiver, which elicited the following response from one of the coaches...""He's not on my team!""It would have been funnier if the filmmakers had extended the scene slightly in showing a referee calling a foul on the play, but oh well.  If you're checking this out mainly because you saw Mary Woronov's name prominently listed on the DVD case, known that she's only in the movie for about two minutes near the end, featured in a very small, bit part.  It's annoying when filmmakers promote a recognizable name appearing in their films as being a much larger part of the production than they are (as was the case here), but it's a fairly common practice, especially in the world of low budget movies.  All in all I thought this a somewhat entertaining film and a great effort, but it could have used a few more gags (especially if it was supposed to be a spoof), better pacing, and a lot more frog, in my humble opinion.The DVD, released by a company called Vital Fluids Releasing, features a widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture that looks very good and the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio comes through cleanly.  There are a couple of extras including a humorous trailer for the film made to look like public service announcement and a featurette entitled `Making of Frog-G-G!' which is comprised of interviews, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage.  Also tossed in are a few previews for some independent features like Ball of Wax (2003), Ding-a-ling-Less (2001), and Horns and Halos (2002).Cookieman108",3,"""You're in no shape to go toe to toe with

The production values and acting are competent, but what turned me off was the amount of story development vs. the actual amount of violence and quality nudity.It's perfectly possible to start a movie off with a big scene, sprinkle in some nudity as you develop the story then bam get right back into the action/nudity and don't let up until after the end credits have rolled, unfortunately that's not what happened here.FROG-G-G! is a good movie with a few solid laughs.  I'd recommend fans of the genre to watch it once, but that's about it.  Oh yea, I know the cover promised Miss Togar, I mean Mary Woronov, but she's only in the movie for like a minute.

881907,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B0007L86NA,Joshua Koppel,"[2, 4]","An EPA agent has been investigating reports of toxic dumping in a small rural community.  While investigating, she develops a relationship with the local barmaid.  But other than the barmaid, the agent is not well received.  She is seen as a trouble maker and someone looking into nothing.  But there is something worth looking into.Toxic waste has caused mutations in local animal life, especially in the form of a man-sized frog.  This frog has a biological imperative to breed with human women.  It takes awhile, but eventually some of the locals begin to take the trouble seriously and plans are made to put an end to the problem.Conceived as a new drive-in movie, this film makes no use of CGI effects or other high-tech effects.  The monster is a man in a rubber suit (albeit a better rubber suit than in most movies).  The cast and plotting are familiar for the genre although some of the acting is better than usual.  This is especially true with the ""frog"" who does an excellent job of being a frog (you have just got to see it).  The lesbian love scenes are not the norm but do not detract from the feel.  Fans may be disappointed to discover that Mary Waranov only appears in the final minutes in a very minor role.  All in all this is a wonderful tribute to those memorable drive-in monster movies.

(This, by the way, is damning with faint praise.)It has a good sense of fun about it, a real catchy theme song and lipstick lesbian sex scenes. It is also a missed opportunity that tries to do a couple of things and pretty much fails at all of them.For example the lead scientist character is a lesbian. She is played by Kristi Russell who does make a decent movie lesbian. (A movie lesbian is a hot chick who likes to make out with other hot chicks preferably when guys are watching. This should not be confused with non-movie lesbians who have mullets, beer guts, wear hockey jerseys and will kick your ass for looking at them twice.) While there are a couple of brief lesbian sex scenes they seem a bit sisterly. (I really don't mean this in a good way). There is some topless hugging and kissing but nothing that screams good exploitation.Well at least as a parody of 70's nature gone wild movies it works right? Nope. All the parts are here (The scientist hero, her girlfriend, the reluctant sheriff and the big bad industrialist who of course is both the lifeblood of this town and the sheriff's brother-in-law.), but the movie plays it much too straight for a good Airplane style parody.Everything else is downhill from there. The movie has no horror at all and considering the plot consists of a man-sized frog copulating with virgins the exploitation is disappointing. (I'm sorry but when one rents a cheap C-grade Humanoids from the Deep rip-off. One expects a hecatomb of nubile young flesh and gratuitous nudity to boot.)Nevertheless I'm a sucker for nature gone wild movies and movie lesbian sex, no matter how tame, has never hurt a film.

The cover looked so funny that I forgot Rule Number 1--The better the cover, the worse the movie. It tried very hard to be a send up of 1950's style monster flix, but that fell apart after the first 5 minutes when we got the nudity and the (rather tame) girl on girl stuff. Another flick with an identity crisis, great. There's really not much to say about this one except that I tend to cut low budget movies a lot of slack when it comes to everything, but the (over) acting here was a bit much even for me.The only aspect of the flick that I did enjoy was the monster himself when he finally did show up. He was never meant to be taken seriously by any means and his suit had everything except a zipper--or maybe it did and I just wasn't paying attention. But I have to admit that I got a kick out of the horny amphibian when he appeared on the football field in the middle of the big game and ran towards the girls in the stands, flinging full backs hither and thither as he waddled or hopped or did whatever it was that was he was doing.

Further, there's only one creature in this film, and his costume looks so much like a man in green rubber (by comparison, the low-grade costumes in Humanoids look more believable).Even when he 'mates' with a human its less explicit than Humanoids, he only thrusts into the air over one woman.Given that this film is made more recently, you'd expect some improvement over the 'big-hair' 80s feel of Humanoids.

Obviously a tribute to those fifties movies that featured genetically mutated creatures, FROG-G-G has some of the most inane dialogue one could imagine, a creature which is obviously a man in a frog suit and actors who treat their roles like Shakespeare.  This all adds up to an entertaining, often hilarious, comedy horror flick.  The finale in which the female doctor confronts the frog creature and strips to her breasts is priceless; the fan in the stadium who screams ""It's a giant frog..run for your lives"" is straight out of ""Them.""

881912,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0007L86NA,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","""Frog-g-g"" is an intentional spoof of pre-CGI monster movies, and as such is a mixed bag. At times it takes itself a bit too seriously, but at others is intentionally campy. The plot is as old as cinema itself: evil business tycoon dumps toxic waste into the town water supply creating a strain of giant killer amphibians who need to spawn. What I am saying here is that the giant frog is extremely attracted to human women, which, naturally, leads him directly to the St. Mary's Catholic School For Girls. There is a corrupt Sheriff (the brother-in-law of the businessman, of course) and a romance subplot. In other words, it's exactly what you would expect from a silly guy-in-a-rubber-suit monster movie from the 1970s.Sometimes the spoof works (normally when it is being more intentional) and sometimes it just drags. There is a lot of high school football shown (some might crassly call this padding) and eventually the frog man does invade the football game. I have a couple of favorite moments from the film, the first was in the opening credits: I knew I was in for a rough ride when I saw the credit ""Music by The Glam Spice Generation."" Although unable to top the music credit, I did enjoy that the frog killed a nun instead of procreating with her. When asked to explain this unusual behavior, our heroine, EPA super agent Barbara Michaels, says that ""he probably sensed a low estrogen level.""There were also some things that I did not like about the film, notably the inability to fast forward through the previews, and the frog-human hybridoma birth at the end of the film, which was both predictable and unnecessary. It did feature scream-queen Mary Woronov as a gynecologist delivering the little biology experiment, which was a bit of a B-movie coup for the production. In another unexpected touch of ""class,"" there is a short on the making of ""Frog-g-g"" as well, something not frequently seen in this league.The film is somewhat entertaining on a camp level. I would recommend it more highly if it were more focused as either a humor or satire piece, and if it did not feature a giant frog breakdancing during the closing credits.",3,"Giant Frogs, Football, And Mary Woronov As A Gynecologist",1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2147,"['Frog-g-g', 'intentional', 'spoof', 'pre-CGI', 'monster', 'movies', 'such', 'mixed', 'bag', 'times', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously', 'others', 'intentionally', 'campy', 'plot', 'as', 'old', 'cinema', 'evil', 'business', 'tycoon', 'dumps', 'toxic', 'waste', 'town', 'water', 'supply', 'creating', 'strain', 'giant', 'killer', 'amphibians', 'who', 'need', 'spawn', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'here', 'giant', 'frog', 'extremely', 'attracted', 'human', 'women', 'naturally', 'directly', 'St.', 'Mary', 'Catholic', 'School', 'Girls', 'corrupt', 'Sheriff', 'brother-in-law', 'businessman', 'course', 'romance', 'subplot', 'other', 'words', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'silly', 'guy-in-a-rubber-suit', 'monster', 'movie', '1970s.Sometimes', 'spoof', 'normally', 'when', 'being', 'more', 'intentional', 'just', 'drags', 'lot', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'shown', 'might', 'crassly', 'call', 'padding', 'eventually', 'frog', 'man', 'invade', 'football', 'game', 'have', 'couple', 'favorite', 'moments', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'opening', 'credits', 'knew', 'was', 'rough', 'ride', 'when', 'saw', 'credit', 'Music', 'Glam', 'Spice', 'Generation', 'unable', 'top', 'music', 'credit', 'did', 'enjoy', 'frog', 'killed', 'nun', 'instead', 'procreating', 'When', 'asked', 'explain', 'unusual', 'behavior', 'heroine', 'EPA', 'super', 'agent', 'Barbara', 'Michaels', 'probably', 'sensed', 'low', 'estrogen', 'level', 'were', 'also', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'notably', 'inability', 'fast', 'forward', 'previews', 'frog-human', 'hybridoma', 'birth', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'predictable', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'feature', 'scream-queen', 'Mary', 'Woronov', 'gynecologist', 'delivering', 'little', 'biology', 'experiment', 'was', 'bit', 'B-movie', 'coup', 'production', 'unexpected', 'touch', 'class', 'short', 'making', 'Frog-g-g', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'not', 'frequently', 'seen', 'league.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'camp', 'level', 'would', 'recommend', 'more', 'highly', 'were', 'more', 'focused', 'humor', 'satire', 'piece', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'giant', 'frog', 'breakdancing', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A

I've read a lot of bad reviews and figured it wasn't worth my time.  I was an idiot for listening to those reviews.  I understand why they didn't like it.  There is nudity but not enough for some people.  If you begn to take this serious then you will hate it.  If like me you can't think of anything more hilarious than a mutated frog/man in a rubber suit trying to procreate with human women then this is for you.
