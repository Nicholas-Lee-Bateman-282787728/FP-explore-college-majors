1249627,A32T2H8150OJLU,B00246QGHE,ARH,"[1, 1]","In 1939 Germany invaded Poland and the USSR invaded Finland.  Some Norwegian volunteers went to the aid of their scandinavian neighbors, and Max Manus was there.  The Soviets met stiff resistance and were stopped cold.  Later, Germany invaded Norway in one swift stroke and the Norwegian royalty had to flee to England.  Immediately after the German invasion and occupation of Norway Manus and others joined the Norwegian resistance.  This movie tells their story, focusing on Manus, one of their leaders.This movie is filmed in Norwegian and subtitled in English.  I found the story to be extremely compelling.  The foreign language actually added a lot to the experience for me.  I didn't really notice that I was following along with subtitles.  The costuming, sets and locations used for filming were authentic and convincing.  The actors were great, as was the story.Most people, including me, know very little about WWII Norway, and all that most people know is about Quisling and his abrupt capitulation to the Germans or that a fjord in Norway was where the Bismarck hid out before its attempt to break out into the Atlantic.  This movie shows more about life in WWII German-occupied Norway and the Norwegian patriots who fought in the resistance there.I recommend this film highly to anyone with interest in WWII history or foreign films.

1249630,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B00246QGHE,David Ljunggren,"[4, 12]","This film, which was apparently the most expensive movie ever made in Norway, tries to tell the story of decorated Norwegian resistance hero Max Manus, who spent much of World War Two sabotaging the German war effort by blowing up ships and buildings and generally causing mayhem. To my mind it doesn't really work.The first problem is the script, which is workmanlike at best and shows far too many scenes of young Norwegian men hanging around, talking at length or larking about or preparing for action. It moves in fits and starts and some of the longest battle scenes take place in Finland, where Manus was a volunteer fighting against the Soviet Union during the Winter War of 1939 to 1940. There isn't actually that much action in this movie. After each attack in Norway Manus and his men escape to Sweden and we see far too many scenes in peaceful Stockholm, which really slows down the film.The second problem is the uniformly wooden acting and the generally mediocre characterisation. We never really care for these people. The love scene between Manus and the woman who eventually becomes his wife is unconvincing and involves an awful lot of chatting and smoking and snarky small talk.The third problem is that you never really feel you are in an occupied country. Manus complains that fighting with the resistance is highly stressful because you never know who is really your friend and who might be an infiltrator, yet we don't see a single scene to show us an example of this ambiguity and torment. Nowhere do we learn what it was like living under Nazi occupation in Scandinavia.

1249631,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00246QGHE,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Not unlike ""Flame and Citron"" this film deals with how some of the folk in the Scandinavian countries weren't too pleased with the fact their governments sidled up with the Nazis during WWII.Max was a Norwegian soldier who fought the Nazis in Finland. He is now going to join the resistance, train in Scotland, and, as a commando, disrupt their actions at every turn possible.With any book or film based in fact you have to wonder how much things had to be punched up to appeal to the audience. Given a certain lack of Hollywood flair, it seems this one might have stuck very close to the truth. Max is a likeable enough guy, but single minded in his resolve to punish the Nazis. He can be rude and short tempered but he's sharp and brave. He, and a few of his close colleagues, manage to do in some heavyweight Nazi ships. They also destroy rail lines and, at a crucial time, take out a large troop transport ship. The Nazis, one officer in particular, do everything possible to capture him. Some die. Some are tortured, but Max soldiers on.This is a good story made into a good movie. The acting is good. It's shot well with great attention paid to some gorgeous scenery. There is also great attention paid to period detail. The wardrobe and settings feel authentic. The music score is well written. It's nice to hear a soundtrack played by an orchestra. The only real problem is that it's a bit too calm in parts that, by nature, are filled with tension.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Maximo Guillermo ""Max"" Manus really existed. Born in 1914 to a Norwegian-Danish couple living in Bergen, he owed his first and second name to the great love his father always felt to Spanish and Latino culture, as he lived many years in numerous Spanish speaking countries. Young Maximo Manus also followed in his father's steps and lived and worked in South American and in Cuba for some time, before returning to Norway in early 1939 and joining Norwegian Army as simple soldier. In winter 1939 together with some other Norwegians he volunteered to serve in Finnish Army and he fought, quite bravely, during Winter War in 1939-40 against invading Soviets.A digression here for fire arms and other military detail maniacs. Before watching this film I couldn't really understand the picture on the cover of the DVD, as the weapon used puzzled me - well, it turns out this is the scene from Winter War and the hero uses here a Finnish Suomi KP/31 9 mm submachine gun with a 36-round box magazine. End of digression for fire arms and other military details maniacs.After surviving the war against Soviets, ""Max"" Manus returned to Norway and re-joined the army, just in time to see the Germans invade his country... After fighting in the Norwegian campaign, once Germans won, he went underground and joined the resistance. And here the film really begins and I am not saying anything more...If you want to fully enjoy this film I advise against checking on internet what happened to the hero and his companions, as well as their nemesis, SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Siegfried Fehmer, a senior Gestapo executive in occupied Norway. The film tries to follow quite close the real history and therefore the suspense can be easily killed.The film shows quite well the cost of the war and of resistance fight on people involved in it. With butcher bill on both sides accumulating and the fighting going on and on seemingly without end, exhaustion, burnout and finally depression settle in and even if one keeps soldiering on, the ghosts of fallen comrades start to slowly replace the company of living and one starts to self-medicate with solitude and strong liquor... And no amount of glory and honors can change it - at least not easily...I liked this film, although a great masterpiece it is not. There are some weaker moments, like the repetitive rather useless reminiscences of Winter War - one would be a good thing, but there is too many of them. The general tone is, I believe, quite typical to the Scandinavian character - serious, even grave, to the point and rather low-key, avoiding excessive display of feelings and drama even when most extremely tragic events are described.There is no cult of super-hero here. ""Max"" Manus is shown here as a very human being, who can occasionally be careless, reckless and even occasionally self-destructive - also, sometimes he is a real jerk... But it actually doesn't hurt his image much - he is simply a tough guy who lives in even tougher times.Bottom line, this is a good, solid war film about armed resistance against a ruthless foreign occupation and especially about one particularly ferocious, charismatic and relentless freedom fighter.

Back in Norway he leads many daring coup-de-main until the end of the war.In the way he loses his friends one by one to the hands of the Germans, this erodes his soul and still he never gives up!Playacting is really very good with Aksel Hennie as Max Manus, Nicolai Cleve Broch as Gregers Gram, Ken Duken as the German Police Chief and Agnes Kittelsen as Tikken.

Which means that it was all really fresh in his mind. Which makes this movie adaptation of his exploits very accurate.  Max fought for finland in 1939-40 before returning to Norway to help fight the Nazi's.  He also helped to create the resistance there as well. The movie does feature his romance with his handler and the stories of several other agents. This isn't hollywood though so you can't expect massive amounts of special effects.  It is a truthful story though and it can't even begin to scratch the surface of all the missions this guy did in the war. However you do get a feel for the resistance movement here and this is what this movie is really about the norwegian resistance. It could have had more action though and that will turn some viewers off but they must remember this is based on real events and made on a budget (and it's well done at that).  the blu ray version of this one will not play on u.s. blu ray players and even if you get a all region blu ray player I would not count on it playing on a u.s. tv. (it is a (56hz blu ray )The dvd though is fine and it looks great. there is a great extra feature which the interview max and other resistance fighters as well as the movie makers. It's a good documentary film in itself.  The negative revierers probably wanted to see a hollywood blow em up flick. but this is not that movie, it's a drama about a resistance fighter and most of the war violence is men shooting at each other.

1249650,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00246QGHE,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Max Manus: Man of War"" follows the exploits of Norwegian saboteur Maximo Guillermo ""Max"" Manus, who was decorated by both Norway and Great Britain for his service during World War II. The story is told from Manus' perspective, based on his autobiographical account and aided by consultation with the surviving members of the Lingekompaniet in which he served in Norway. In 1940, Max Manus (Aksel Hennie) and a handful of like-minded Norwegians who were embarrassed by their country's quick capitulation to Germany published an underground, anti-Nazi newspaper. In 1941, Max was caught, then spirited to Scotland for training after a daring escape. There, he was reacquainted with his friend, the propagandist Gregors Gram (Nicolai Cleve Broch).Max and Gregors return to Norway repeatedly to carry out missions of sabotage, using Sweden as a safe haven, where they receive instructions from a woman named Tikken (Agnes Kittelsen). Most spectacularly, Max and his team, under the command of Gunnar Snsteby (Knut Joner), destroyed German ships in Oslo harbor. Max becomes increasingly disturbed by the deaths of his compatriots, whose lives are often lost in accomplishing very little. Though we don't see it in the film, most attempts at sabotage were not successful. Max Manus and his colleagues were sufficiently destructive, however, to become something of an obsession with the Gestapo officer in Oslo, Siegfried Fehmer (Ken Duken), who took many innocent lives in hunting for the saboteurs.Aksel Hennie plays a fine charismatic, brave, and slightly self-destructive man, in the mold of a Nordic national hero. I like his performance, but the casting is a little ironic, as Max Manus was known for not looking the part of a Nordic warrior. He was dark-haired and short. The film has been taken to task by some critics in Norway for being too conventional and avoiding the moral dilemmas faced by the saboteurs. Those criticisms are true, but these are fine performances of flawed men, who were quite ordinary except in their commitment to their cause. ""Max Manus"" conveys an affecting impression of just how daring the work of the Resistance often was, how easy is was to get caught, and the horrific implications of capture that these men all lived with.Critics have tended to compare ""Max Manus"" to the Danish ""Flame and Citron"" (2008), about the work of two members of that country's Resistance during the War. There is no denying that ""Flame and Citron"" is more nuanced and controversial. It explores the delicate, disturbing politics of collaboration and occupation -divisive, complicated subjects that are still taboo in many European nations. ""Max Manus"" is a more conventional war movie, but it is entertaining and educational as such. In Norwegian with optional English subtitles. The DVD (Music Box Films 2011) includes a theatrical trailer (2 min) and ""Max Manus: Film & Reality"" (45 min), which interviews the film's directors, writer, cast, and Manus' living family members and comrades.

1249654,A104QTD4GDT2OQ,B00246QGHE,Philip S. Walker,"[10, 14]","Like most other European nations that were occupied by the Germans during WWII, the Norwegians have been traumatised by the experience practically ever since. That is no wonder, since what happened in these countries often had character of a civil war, with some people setting up underground resistance movements and others assisting the Germans in trying to hinder their activities. You would think there's material here for some great films dealing with these ultra sensitive issues. Unfortunately, they don't seem to emerge, and certainly not in this case.Instead, this is a completely traditional film tribute to a well-known spearhead of the Norwegian resistance movement, Max Manus. In many ways it might as well have been a statue or a coffee table book, since it does very little to go into the more complex aspects of what is probably, at least in some ways, the nastiest form of war there is. Also, Manus' traumatic childhood and youth are only hinted at, and no moral issues are dealt with when he starts courting a married woman with children. There is a lot of talk about Manus' time as a volunteer in Finland during the Winter War, but no mentioning at all of the ambiguous feeling our hero must have had about this two years later when he is fighting the Germans in Norway and Finland has joined the Germany army in their invasion of Russia.The structure is a typical Hollywood three-acter (1. You chase a man up in a tree. 2. You shake a stick at him. 3. You get the man down from the tree) portraying clean-cut, heroic Norwegian lovers of King and country fighting nasty Nazis. The acting is in parts pretty good, but generally as wooden and skin-deep as you would expect with this kind of manuscript. The story-line is partly over-simplified and partly marred by the inclusion of irrelevant threads, some of the action scenes I simply refuse to believe can be correctly presented (particularly the sabotage of the German warship Donau), the strange out-of-proportion digital effects will be laughed at in ten years time (as we now laugh at those from ten years ago), but worst of all the physical environment is completely unrepresentative of those times. We are talking about the 1940s in an occupied country under heavy rationing. Things were dirty, scruffy, chipped, clothes were worn to shreds, and people couldn't wash so they stank and had bad teeth, yet everything in this film is so super cleansed it could be Disneyland.By far the strongest scenes are the main character's brief flashbacks to his participation on the Finnish side in the Winter War. Not only are these scenes much more authentic, they also expose him as a far more complex human being than the rest of the movie. Most notably, when his sub-machine gun develops a fault he follows some poor, scared to death Russian conscript on foot through the snow, attacks him and kills him with his knife. Since this happens on the Finnish front it's hardly an act in honour of good old Norway and its king; however, this significant side of Manus' character isn't really dealt with otherwise in the movie. If he really is the killer type the title wants us to believe, he doesn't show it very much.Talking of misleading the public, I agree with others that the attempts to sell this film as an action packed war movie are pretty deplorable. The picture on the box shows our not so mad Max dressed in white Finnish camouflage, yet the scenes in Finland hardly take up one percent of the film. The trailer for the film is equally way off the mark, trying to give the impression that this is an English speaking movie. It isn't, but to say that the actors speak Norwegian wouldn't be telling the truth either. Except for one or two all they do is mumble incomprehensively. That, of course, is a current trend in most films and is claimed to be realistic, yet it is most certainly not how the beautiful Norwegian language was spoken in the 1940s. Funnily enough, in the extras documentary they all speak much more clearly - so much for the realism of muttering.I give this film three stars because, all technical criticism aside, you have to honour the people who freed the world of the Nazis, and because the extra material - or at least the bits that work as a documentary on Manus' life - are well worth watching. However, if you want a truer and more thought-provoking image of the Nordic countries during WWII you're better off with the Danish film 'Flame and Citron'.Still, the real treat awaits those who look further East, to Finland. The movie simply titled 'The Winter War' is like the best two minutes of 'Max Manus - Man of War' stretched into three and a half hour, and even better is 'The Unknown Soldier' (the 1985 version), a pure work of genius.",3,Not so Mad Max,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,4741,"['most', 'other', 'European', 'nations', 'were', 'occupied', 'Germans', 'WWII', 'Norwegians', 'have', 'been', 'traumatised',

An exellemt and important story about the Norwegian commandos who faught a resistance that while small in scale, crippled much of the German transports of supplies and weapons that were meant to be shipped to nazi's on the front but never got there because Max Manus and his group of commandos planted bombs on those transport vessels and destroyed them. The risks these men took to accomplish their missions were bold, dangerous, and incredibly couragious, but they succeeded in putting major chink in the nazi's war effort. Without these tackics in seemingly small ways such as what Max and his group of devoted mercinaries did, the nazi's might have been strong enough to win the war. This is a superb, well acted, produced and directed film about this story in history that honors Norways greatest war time heroes admirably. I don't see the connection between this film and Flame and Citron that other members have commented on, except that they are both great films out of Norway. But the comparrsons stop there. These stories are completely different in most ways. Certainly if this movie were an americam film with amercian actors there is no doubt it would have been one of the Oscar contenders for best picture. It's that good. While not quite in the league of films like Saving Private Ryan, Schilndler's List or Polanski's ""The Pianist"", there is no denying it is a really good film and a very honorable salute to the brave men this story is about.

1249656,A164FJ2Z5FD4RH,B00246QGHE,"Reckless Reader ""Just Read""","[0, 0]","Others have already written that this is a good little movie, with good acting/cinematography/direction/etc. It's a wonderful piece of realistic hero-worship of a member of the miniscule Norwegian Resistance during WWII. It's fun to watch, the way all good movies about little guys fighting the Man are, especially when the Man is the entire Nazi Regime.But after watching it, and taking it at face value, it left me thinking about far deeper issues than those it tackles --- Norway, after all, was taken by the Nazis in almost no time at all, and the nation had little trouble adapting to life under the collaborationist government of Quisling. In fact, it was so easy that we still use the word ""quisling"" to refer to collaborationists everywhere in every time. Norway is a very homogeneous nation, an Aryan nation with many blond blue-eyed types that were worshipped and adored by the Nazis, and so it was not that hard to see the Nazis as not all that bad, except that they were outsiders, Germans, with a different language and different culture.The deeper issues this left me thinking about --- of what value is Resistance when the Invaders and their Collaborators are so strong and overwhelming. Max and his small band of young student warriors definitely did some damage -- a few ships blown up, some rail lines destroyed, some Nazis killed -- but they did not make the war end one day earlier, they did not throw off the Nazi yoke -- one could argue that if they had not existed, the course of the war would have been basically the same.So one is led to that most existential of questions -- does one resist simply because there is no moral alternative, even if it does little to change anything in real time? And the companion question -- does one do this even though one knows that he and his friends may die dirty, violent, ugly, tortured deaths, and may lead to the deaths of innocent victims killed in revenge by the Nazis because they cannot capture the real resistance fighters?These are hard questions, inherent in this good little film -- Max loses all his friends, his deepest allies, his soul brothers, and lives a difficult life thereafter filled with alcohol and despair, but was it nevertheless worth it, even if the results were minimal? Is it worth it because one must do what one can in the face of Evil, no matter what the price to be paid?These are, as I say, hard questions -- and I'm thankful to the movie makers for bringing me to them, even though it does not appear that this is their purpose -- they seemed to simply want to make a film that extolled Norway's heroes, and helps everyone forget that by and large, the nation of Norway was not such a resistant collaborator with the Nazis during the Quisling Regime.I'd like to think I could be with Max Manus in such times....but it's really easy to say this from the safety of our times and places....it's harder to know what one would do if actually forced to face immediate death for not much of any reward other than knowing that one is right, and on the side of right....",4,Good Movie Raises Deeper Issues,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3059,"['Others', 'have', 'already', 'written', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'good', 'acting/cinematography/direction/etc', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'realistic', 'hero-worship', 'member', 'miniscule', 'Norwegian', 'Resistance', 'WWII', 'fun', 'watch', 'way', 'good', 'movies', 'little', 'guys', 'fighting', 'Man', 'are', 'especially', 'when', 'Man', 'entire', 'Nazi', 'Regime.But', 'watching', 'taking', 'face', 'value', 'left', 'thinking', 'far', 'deeper', 'issues', 'Norway', 'was', 'taken', 'Nazis', 'almost', 'time', 'nation', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'life', 'collaborationist', 'government', 'Quisling', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'easy', 'still', 'use', 'word', 'quisling', 'refer', 'collaborationists', 'everywhere', 'time', 'Norway', 'very', 'homogeneous', 'nation', 'Aryan', 'nation', 'many', 'blond', 'blue-eyed', 'types', 'were', 'worshipped', 'adored', 'Nazis', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'see', 'Nazis', 'not', 'bad', 'were', 'outsiders', 'Germans', 'different', 'language', 'different', 'culture.The', 'deeper', 'issues', 'left', 'thinking', 'about', 'what', 'value', 'Resistance', 'when', 'Invaders', 'Collaborators', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'overwhelming', 'Max', 'small', 'band', 'young', 'student', 'warriors', 'definitely', 'did', 'damage', 'few', 'ships', 'blown', 'up', 'rail', 'lines', 'destroyed', 'Nazis', 'killed', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'war', 'end', 'one', 'day', 'earlier', 'did', 'not', 'throw', 'off', 'Nazi', 'yoke', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'had', 'not', 'existed', 'course', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'basically', 'same.So', 'one', 'led', 'most', 'existential', 'questions', 'one', 'resist', 'simply', 'moral', 'alternative', 'even', 'little', 'change', 'anything', 'real', 'time', 'companion', 'question', 'one', 'do', 'even', 'one', 'friends', 'may', 'die', 'dirty', 'violent', 'ugly', 'tortured', 'deaths', 'may', 'lead', 'deaths', 'innocent', 'victims', 'killed', 'revenge', 'Nazis', 'can', 'not', 'capture', 'real', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'are', 'hard', 'questions', 'inherent', 'good', 'little', 'film', 'Max', 'friends', 'deepest', 'allies', 'soul', 'brothers', 'difficult', 'life', 'thereafter', 'filled', 'alcohol', 'despair', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'even', 'results', 'were', 'minimal', 'one', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'face', 'Evil', 'matter', 'what', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'are', 'say', 'hard', 'questions', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'movie', 'makers', 'bringing', 'even', 'not', 'appear', 'purpose', 'seemed', 'simply', 'want', 'make', 'film', 'extolled', 'Norway', 'heroes', 'everyone', 'forget', 'large', 'nation', 'Norway', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'resistant', 'collaborator', 'Nazis', 'Quisling', 'Regime.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'Max', 'Manus', 'such', 'times', 'really', 'easy', 'say', 'safety', 'times', 'places', '.it', 'harder', 'know', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'actually', 'forced', 'face', 'immediate', 'death', 'not', 'much', 'reward', 'other', 'knowing', 'one', 'right', 'side', 'right']",Max Manus: Man of War

1249663,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00246QGHE,trebe,"[0, 0]","Max Manus: Man of War (2008) is a Norwegian production that follows the wartime activities of Max Manus (1914-96), who as a member of the resistance, was one Norway's most renowned World War II heroes.  Based on Manus' own memoirs, the movie attempts to cover the pertinent facts of his life, while also presenting them in a realistic and compellingly dramatic fashion.  The film does a remarkable job of capturing the atmosphere of Norway under Nazi occupation, and while not entirely accurate historically, many of the characters in the movie are based on real people and actual events.  The acting is truly exemplary, and along with the period costumes and authentic locations, makes it quite easy to believe that the characters are who they are supposed to be.After a traumatic time fighting the Russians in Finland in 1940, Max Manus (Aksel Hennie) returns to his homeland of Norway, which after surrendering, is now under German occupation.  Manus joins the resistance movement, which leads to his arrest by the Gestapo.  After making a dramatic escape from a hospital with the help of his friends, he eludes capture and makes his way to Scotland, joining the Norwegian army in exile.Something of a celebrity after escape, Manus receives commando training including sabotage and demolition.  After which, he and his close friend Gregers Gram (Nicolai Cleve Broch) return to Norway in 1943 to operate at saboteurs, planting mines on German ships in Oslo harbor, and causing great destruction.Norway's resistance agents typically operate out of Stockholm in neutral Sweden, and it is there that Manus meets ""Tikken"" Lindebraekke (Agnes Kittelsen), who is a friend of Gregers, working for the British embassy.  The pair have a certain chemistry, however Tikken being married and separated, and Max's desire to be at the frontlines, puts stress on their relationship.  Manus and Gregers return to Norway, and barely escape with their lives, after another dangerous mission, that sees them near the top of Gestapo officer Siegfried Fehmer's (Ken Duken) most wanted list.  Being in the resistance is a very dangerous game, and as the war goes on Manus, loses some of his closest friends.The story is told in increments, focusing on particular operations involving Manus and his resistance colleagues, seasoned by Manus' flashbacks to his experiences in the infantry, fighting Russians in the snow.  In their most brazen escapade, the saboteurs boldly impersonate electricians and enter a shipyard in order to plant mines on a massive troop transport ship.  The aftermath shows the vessel grounded near the shore, with one side blown out, as a shocked Fehmer surveys the damage.With so many films being released, it is very easy for a great movie to slip by, and this is particularly true for foreign films.  Even if you dislike reading subtitles, if you enjoy wartime suspense adventures, do yourself a favor and see this movie.  There are no superhuman heroics or stereotypical characters.  Most of what happens seems very real and credible.  A an understanding of history helps, but is not essential to understanding what is happening.
