438286,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6304872402,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","After the year 1989 which saw two awesome Don Bluth films (All Dogs Go To Heaven and The Land Before Time), for some reason something bad happened in the 90's. Before Anastasia came out in 1997, we were given efforts from Don Bluth such as The Pebble And The Penguin (Easily his worst film.), Rock A Doodle Doo (It was alright.), and a few other not-so-great efforts. While I would have to say this is not my favorite Don Bluth film (It ranks third behind All Dogs Go To Heaven and The Secret of Nimh), this is still a fantastic film that brought Don Bluth back to the top of film-making form. This film is a  dazzling, eye-catching, extraordinary cinematic accomplishment that can easily overthrow many Disney films even to this day.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film starts off in the year 1916, in Russia at the Czar's palace during a ball. It is during this ball that an evil man named Rasputen (Played by Christopher Lloyd) puts an evil curse on the Romanov family. Then a short while later, an angry mob storms the palace and kills most of the family except for the Grandmother (Who is the ruler of France) and Anastasia, but when the two try to escape by train, Anastasia loses her Grandmother's grip and falls. Fast forward ten years later and we are now in the Soviet Union and rumors start popping up around St. Petersburg that Anastasia is still alive so two guys; Dimitri (Played by John Cusack) and Vladimir (Played by Kelsey Grammer) decide to hold auditions to find a girl who looks like Anastasia so they can claim a reward of ten million rubles. Then we are introduced to Anya (Played by Meg Ryan), an eighteen-year-old girl who has no memory past the age of eight and wants to find her family that she never knew, so she starts off by going to St. Petersburg where she plans to go to Paris but first meets Dimitri and Vladimir who decide to take her to Paris with them because she looks a lot like Anastasia. But the group has troubles on their journey because they are being hunted by Rasputen who wants to kill Anastasia to fulfill the curse he put on Romanov family.MUSIC: The music in this film is great, and even the musical parts of the film are great and never get annoying. I have no problems with this area because it is superbly done.ACTION: This film is extremely entertaining and there is never a dull moment. There's even action scenes in this film which are rather awesome to watch (Watch the train scene and you'll see why.). The animation looks stunning even in this day and age despite the fact it came out twelve years ago. Overall, I don't really have any gripes with this area either.ACTING: The only problem here is a few moments of cheesy dialogue, but other than that all the actors do a really good job at their roles. I don't think better people could have been cast for such roles because their roles suit them perfectly. I even enjoyed them for moments of fun humor. Other than dialogue issues, I don't really see any other issues.OVERALL: If you enjoy animated films, musicals, or just amazing films in general, then what the hell are you waiting for? Buy this damn film! This is a review coming from a person who rarely ever gives positive (Let alone raving) reviews of animated films, but this is one of those rare animated films that I love so much because it's a breathtaking, awe-inspiring, ride that you don't want to end.THE GOOD: Stunning animation, superb music, awesome action scenes, cool storyline, fun humor, and good acting.THE BAD: Moments of cheesy dialogue.",5,ONE OF DON BLUTH'S BEST  9.25 OUT OF 10,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,3511,"['year', '1989', 'saw', 'two', 'awesome', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'films', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'Land', 'Before', 'Time', 'reason', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', '90', 'Anastasia', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'were', 'given', 'efforts', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'such', 'Pebble', 'Penguin', 'Easily', 'worst', 'film', 'Rock', 'A', 'Doodle', 'Doo', 'was', 'alright', 'few', 'other', 'not-so-great', 'efforts', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'favorite', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'film', 'third', 'All', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'Secret', 'Nimh', 'still', 'fantastic', 'film', 'brought', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'back', 'top', 'film-making', 'form', 'film', 'dazzling', 'eye-catching', 'extraordinary', 'cinematic', 'accomplishment', 'can', 'easily', 'overthrow', 'many', 'Disney', 'films', 'even', 'day.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'film', 'year', '1916', 'Russia', 'Czar', 'palace', 'ball', 'ball', 'evil', 'man', 'named', 'Rasputen', 'Played', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'evil', 'curse', 'Romanov', 'family', 'Then', 'short', 'while', 'later', 'angry', 'mob', 'palace', 'most', 'family', 'Grandmother', 'Who', 'ruler', 'France', 'Anastasia', 'when', 'two', 'try', 'escape', 'train', 'Anastasia', 'Grandmother', 'grip', 'Fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'now', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'rumors', 'start', 'popping', 'up', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Anastasia', 'still', 'alive', 'so', 'two', 'guys', 'Dimitri', 'Played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Vladimir', 'Played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'decide', 'hold', 'auditions', 'find', 'girl', 'who', 'Anastasia', 'can', 'claim', 'reward', 'ten', 'million', 'rubles', 'Then', 'are', 'introduced', 'Anya', 'Played', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'eighteen-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'memory', 'age', 'eight', 'find', 'family', 'never', 'knew', 'going', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'where', 'go', 'Paris', 'first', 'meets', 'Dimitri', 'Vladimir', 'who', 'decide', 'take', 'Paris', 'lot', 'Anastasia', 'group', 'troubles', 'journey', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'Rasputen', 'who', 'kill', 'Anastasia', 'fulfill', 'curse', 'put', 'Romanov', 'family.MUSIC', 'music', 'film', 'great', 'even', 'musical', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'never', 'get', 'annoying', 'have', 'problems', 'area', 'superbly', 'done.ACTION', 'film', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'even', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'rather', 'awesome', 'watch', 'Watch', 'train', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why.', 'animation', 'stunning', 'even', 'day', 'age', 'fact', 'came', 'out', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'gripes', 'area', 'either.ACTING', 'only', 'problem', 'here', 'few', 'moments', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'such', 'roles', 'roles', 'suit', 'perfectly', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'moments', 'fun', 'humor', 'Other', 'dialogue', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'other', 'issues.OVERALL', 'enjoy', 'animated', 'films', 'musicals', 'just', 'amazing', 'films', 'general', 'then', 'what', 'hell', 'are', 'waiting', 'Buy', 'damn', 'film', 'review', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'rarely', 'ever', 'positive', 'Let', 'alone', 'raving', 'reviews', 'animated', 'films', 'one', 'rare', 'animated', 'films', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'breathtaking', 'awe-inspiring', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end.THE', 'GOOD', 'Stunning', 'animation', 'superb', 'music', 'awesome', 'action', 'scenes', 'cool', 'storyline', 'fun', 'humor', 'good', 'acting.THE', 'BAD', 'Moments', 'cheesy', 'dialogue']",Anastasia VHS

Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales.

It was believed that the princess anastasia survived due to the fact that her body was unaccounted for among her relatives.  It was thought to believe that she was found but actually the woman, now dead, was proved to be a fake when Anastasia's bones were finally found after the imposters death.  This woman tho did not know she was an imposter because she had amnesia and did not know whether or not she was actually anastasia.While the movie takes its own spin on this tale, it is still fun and facinating to watch as the evil Rasputin, a real character in history who was believed to posses dark powers, tries endlessly to fulfill his curse of killing the Romanove (unsure of spelling) family by killing the sole survivor, Anastasia.  This film is to be considered a musicle due to all the songs in it but it should be noted that these songs, unlike most in disney and other kid films, are not horrible and make you want to plug your ears....these songs are heartfelt and made for all listeners young and old.  My favorite song is ""One Step at A time"" where Anastasia is travleing to St. Peterspurg to begine her search for her family.Another great aspect of this film is that it has a wonderful vioce cast that helps contribute to the magic of the film...such actors are as follows...Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, and Angela Lansbury.  Each actor does an excelant job at helping the film come to life before your eyes and show that they not only know how to act on screen in real life, but to animated character with out making it sound fake and hollow.  They are extremly enjoyable to listen to.I encourage you to buy Anastasia, its the perfect animated film for anyone in the family who dreams that perhaps, they were actually born a princess.",5,Great Movie!!,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,2169,"['Anastasia', 'may', 'never', 'become', 'classic', 'hearts', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'witness', 'young', 'woman', '18', 'years', 'old', 'lost', 'alone', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'unforgiving', 'world.Anastasia', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Bolzchevic', 'Revolution', 'where', 'Czars', 'Russia', 'were', 'overthrown', 'killed', 'was', 'believed', 'princess', 'anastasia', 'survived', 'due', 'fact', 'body', 'was', 'unaccounted', 'relatives', 'was', 'thought', 'believe', 'was', 'found', 'actually', 'woman', 'now', 'dead', 'was', 'proved', 'be', 'fake', 'when', 'Anastasia', 'bones', 'were', 'finally', 'found', 'imposters', 'death', 'woman', 'tho', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'imposter', 'had', 'amnesia', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'not', 'was', 'actually', 'movie', 'own', 'spin', 'tale', 'still', 'fun', 'facinating', 'watch', 'evil', 'Rasputin', 'real', 'character', 'history', 'who', 'was', 'believed', 'posses', 'dark', 'powers', 'tries', 'endlessly', 'fulfill', 'curse', 'killing', 'Romanove', 'unsure', 'spelling', 'family', 'killing', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Anastasia', 'film', 'be', 'considered', 'musicle', 'due', 'songs', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'songs', 'most', 'disney', 'other', 'kid', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'horrible', 'make', 'want', 'plug', 'ears', '.these', 'songs', 'are', 'heartfelt', 'made', 'listeners', 'young', 'old', 'favorite', 'song', 'One', 'Step', 'time', 'where', 'Anastasia', 'travleing', 'St.', 'Peterspurg', 'begine', 'search', 'family.Another', 'great', 'aspect', 'film', 'wonderful', 'vioce', 'cast', 'contribute', 'magic', 'film', 'such', 'actors', 'are', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'actor', 'excelant', 'job', 'helping', 'film', 'come', 'life', 'eyes', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'animated', 'character', 'out', 'making', 'sound', 'fake', 'hollow', 'are', 'extremly', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'to.I', 'encourage', 'buy', 'Anastasia', 'perfect', 'animated', 'film', 'anyone', 'family', 'who', 'perhaps', 'were', 'actually', 'born', 'princess']",Anastasia VHS
438298,AK0CENM3LUM28,6304872402,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","Anastasia / B000CNE092""Anastasia"" is an animated historical fiction of the ""alternate reality"" variety. Here, the impetus behind the brutal deposition of the Tsar and his family have less to do with social unrest and more to do with a magical curse levied by a disgruntled Rasputin, here voiced superbly by a frenetic Christopher Lloyd. Young, innocent Anastasia - a mere child at the time of this alternate reality overthrow - barely manages to escape the curse, losing her memory in the process, and grows up in a quick cutaway in an orphanage, dreaming of a better life. Fast forward several years and, in an astounding coincidence, the young Ana falls in with a duo of fraudsters hoping to pass the young woman off as the ""real thing"" in exchange for a reward from her mourning grandmother.Along the way, audiences will be treated to the usual romantic subplot, a montage of musical songs that will stick in the brain as Ear Bugs but never attain the same level of classic status as, say, Disney musical songs of the same decade, and almost enough whimsy to offset the particularly dark and potentially frightening bits featuring Rasputin as an undead abomination with rotting bits constantly falling off. It is due to these frightening scenes, however, that this movie almost certainly won't enthrall very young children, and the movie lacks the staying power for older audiences. Older viewers will likely be tired by the predictable romantic subplot, and while the music is definitely catchy, the ethereal sadness underlying many of the songs may prevent their being sung again and again by audiences.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Potentially Frightening,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1621,"['Anastasia', '/', 'B000CNE092', 'Anastasia', 'animated', 'historical', 'fiction', 'alternate', 'reality', 'variety', 'Here', 'impetus', 'brutal', 'deposition', 'Tsar', 'family', 'have', 'less', 'do', 'social', 'unrest', 'more', 'do', 'magical', 'curse', 'levied', 'disgruntled', 'Rasputin', 'here', 'voiced', 'superbly', 'frenetic', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Young', 'innocent', 'Anastasia', 'mere', 'child', 'time', 'alternate', 'reality', 'overthrow', 'barely', 'escape', 'curse', 'losing', 'memory', 'process', 'up', 'quick', 'cutaway', 'orphanage', 'dreaming', 'better', 'life', 'Fast', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'astounding', 'coincidence', 'young', 'Ana', 'duo', 'fraudsters', 'hoping', 'pass', 'young', 'woman', 'real', 'thing', 'exchange', 'reward', 'mourning', 'way', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'usual', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'montage', 'musical', 'songs', 'will', 'stick', 'brain', 'Ear', 'Bugs', 'never', 'attain', 'same', 'level', 'classic', 'status', 'say', 'Disney', 'musical', 'songs', 'same', 'decade', 'almost', 'enough', 'whimsy', 'offset', 'particularly', 'dark', 'potentially', 'frightening', 'bits', 'featuring', 'Rasputin', 'undead', 'abomination', 'rotting', 'bits', 'constantly', 'falling', 'off', 'due', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'however', 'movie', 'almost', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enthrall', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'movie', 'staying', 'power', 'older', 'audiences', 'Older', 'viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'tired', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'music', 'definitely', 'catchy', 'ethereal', 'sadness', 'underlying', 'many', 'songs', 'may', 'prevent', 'being', 'sung', 'again', 'again', 'audiences.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Anastasia VHS

It is full of adventures to keep the children interested but includes many complicated plots and subplots going on at the same time for the adults to enjoy.  When found, Anya was told she had the beauty of her mother, Alexandra; her father had been the last czar, Nicholas.On the ship to France, curses were being thrown Anya's way by Rasputian.  She feels like she is falling apart.  A waif for many years, she is hoping to find her family and her destiny.  At the Effiel Tower, we saw a beautiful dancing water show similar to that at the downtown park in Chicago in summer.The elderly Empress with her white hair has reached the point of despair and will no longer interview any of the many girls who claim to be Anastasia.  She had a cat with a fluffy tail.  Her maid Sophia, the blonde bombshell with Dolly Parton attributes, informs them of the Soviet ballet and takes them on a fantastic shopping spree.Dimitri had been a servant lad in the palace and had led the group to safety during the revolution.  Now he has turned into a conman to find the heiress.  He is pictured with my son Geoffrey's hair and even his smile.  There is a model in Chicago who is Jeff's 'double' so it could have been based on him.Out in the streets of Paris, there is dancing as in HAVANA NIGHTS cartoon style.  At the Moulin Rouge shaped like a windmill we see the can can dancers' show.On the way to the ballet, we saw a huge statue of Rodin's THE THINKER.  Cinderella was the ending of the ballet; we did not see the beginning.  When confronted with Anya, she wearily inquires, ""How much pain will you inflict on an old woman?""  Now, she had decided to end her days with a lonely life in peace.  Dimitri carjacked the Empress to explain how and why he knows for sure this is the right Anastasia.  ""I know you've been hurt,"" he says, by his search for the young girl he had fallen in love with.Anya had prayed, ""Please let her remember me.""  It was the thing she wore around her neck which opened the music box which was the deciding factor.  As we watched the music box dancers, we hear a lovely song, ""Once Upon a December.""She had become bitter toward Dimitri when learning of his con game.  ""From the beginning, you lied,"" she'd proclaimed thinking he was just after the reward money.  Upon learning that he had refused the fortune due to a 'change of heart,' we see a bittersweet ""goodbye.""The mutt was a good mood-changer.  He was so cute, as was the bat which Rasputian had who wished he would just 'get a life.'  He got his own at the end of this movie.Anya was lured into a maze built around a beautiful fountain by evil forces.  She told Rasputain, the mad monk, ""I'm not afraid of you.""  He'd declared, ""What goes around comes around."" She is saved by Dimitri who had returned to claim her as his own and they destroyed his evil by tearing up the lighted skull.  Rasputain is turned into ashes after Dimitri had an encounter with a destructive Pegasus.After she tells him that 'all men are babies,' they eloped.  Isn't that romantic?!

Her grandmother offers a reward of 10 million rubles to anyone who can find Anastasia and have her come back to her. Dimitri and Vlad are scheming to have auditions to have an Anastasia look a like and they unexpectedly find the real Anastasia knowing it was really her til the middle/end.

My favorite part was when Anastasia and the grandmother were reunited and that Anastasia and Dimitri were together and they promised to visit grandmother and sophie in the future. The movie has a great soundtrack to it and great songs. I sing a long to them all the time. Its hard to pick favorite songs to it because they're all awesome and I love them all.

I wish there was a prequel and a sequel to this movie. The prequel would be what Anastasias life was like before all the bad stuff happened. And the sequel could have Anastasia and Dimitri getting married in Paris and they bring everyone including grandmother Sophie and Vlad. And Rasputin could come back from the dead seeking revenge.

438311,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6304872402,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 3]","This warm and romantic film from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has long been my favorite animated feature. This mostly fictional story of Russia's famous Anastasia and her search for her family is sprinkled with humor and great songs. The animation, from snowy Russia to glamorous Paris, is top notch and the story is both heartwarming and fun.A great cast of voices, including Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Cusack (Dimitri), Kelsey Grammer (Vladimir), Christopher Lloyd (Rasputin) and Angela Lansbury as Anastasia's beloved grandmother add depth to an enchanting film. Anastasia wants to leave Russia for Paris because the necklace she wears has the inscription, ""Together in Paris,"" which she is sure holds the key to her journey to discover who she is and where she belongs.Dimitri and Vladimir plan to pass her off as the real Anastasia for the reward in exchange for her visa out of Russia. The banter between Anastasia and Dimitri masks a growing attraction, of course, and when Dimitri discovers before she does that she really is Anastasia he knows he must step aside.Complicating matters is the evil Rasputin, who has placed a curse on her family and sold his soul to destroy them. His little fruit bat Bratok (Hank Azaria) is a very funny creation and turns out to be not so evil at all.The story is peppered throughout with great songs, including ""Journey to the Past"" and the haunting ""Once Upon a December."" Anastasia is warm and involving, separating it from other animated films. When Anya discovers she really is Anastasia, it is bittersweet, as she now must choose between her past and her future. Love may conquer all, but not if the evil Rasputin has his way.This is a heartfelt and funny animated feature you'll want to own and watch over and over.

438323,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6304872402,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 9]","That's the best way I can describe this film. Don Bluth created 2 films that I absolutely loved as a kid: An American Tail and Land Before Time(I still quote that ""mother, what's a looooong neck?"" line). So watching Anastasia you think, ooh, another one. Just too bad that's not the case since not only did they mess around a bit with history but it just smacks of trying to outdo Disney instead of just telling a good story.The film centers around Anastasia who escapes a siege in her castle. She loses her memory and becomes Anya and meets Dimitri, the grown up boy who saved her from the castle. He's been training would-be Anastasia's to collect prize money but he finds the real one and has to travel to Paris from Russia to reunite her with her grandmother.One of the most infamous mysteries in history, let alone Russian history, is what happened to Anastasia, the daughter of Czar Nicholas the 2nd. During the Revolution, Anastasia supposedly escaped and details are wild saying she was bayoneted many times, others say she went to Germany and became Anna Anderson which turned out to be false. The film says that not only did Anastasia survive but actually made it to Paris and all was well.It's a very interesting story with many ways to go about it but this is quite something. Unlike other films which takes creative liberties to make a better story/pacing, this film throws history out the window entirely. Not to fault the film for wanting to tell a fuller story but it's practically rewriting history. For starters, Rasputin didn't start the Revolution, Lenin did. And Rasputin was actually assasinated way before it began.What made other animated films that had musical numbers was that they were catchy. Here they seem kind of a hindrance, there's literally a moment where not even 2 minutes pass and we're ""treated"" to another song. It would be ok if they were memorable but I can't remember anything about them at this point.One thing that I can't fault the film on is the animation and voice acting. The animation for the most part works, especially backgrounds. Never did like the character designs though since they look kind of ugly, especially Anastasia. The voice acting is quite top notch though featuring Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar and Christopher Lloyd as well as Hank Azaria.If you want notable Bluth films, watch American Tail and Land Before Time but if you want check this film out too but I didn't enjoy it as much.",2,Really disappointed,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2459,"['best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'film', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'created', '2', 'films', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'kid', 'American', 'Tail', 'Land', 'Time', 'still', 'quote', 'mother', 'what', 'looooong', 'neck', 'line', 'So', 'watching', 'Anastasia', 'think', 'ooh', 'one', 'Just', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'mess', 'bit', 'history', 'just', 'smacks', 'trying', 'outdo', 'Disney', 'instead', 'just', 'telling', 'good', 'story.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Anastasia', 'who', 'siege', 'castle', 'memory', 'Anya', 'meets', 'Dimitri', 'grown', 'up', 'boy', 'who', 'saved', 'castle', 'been', 'training', 'would-be', 'Anastasia', 'collect', 'prize', 'money', 'real', 'one', 'travel', 'Paris', 'Russia', 'reunite', 'grandmother.One', 'most', 'infamous', 'mysteries', 'history', 'let', 'alone', 'Russian', 'history', 'what', 'happened', 'Anastasia', 'daughter', 'Czar', 'Nicholas', '2nd', 'Revolution', 'Anastasia', 'supposedly', 'escaped', 'details', 'are', 'wild', 'saying', 'was', 'bayoneted', 'many', 'times', 'others', 'say', 'went', 'Germany', 'became', 'Anna', 'Anderson', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'false', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Anastasia', 'survive', 'actually', 'made', 'Paris', 'was', 'well.It', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'go', 'quite', 'something', 'other', 'films', 'creative', 'liberties', 'make', 'better', 'story/pacing', 'film', 'history', 'window', 'entirely', 'Not', 'fault', 'film', 'wanting', 'tell', 'fuller', 'story', 'practically', 'rewriting', 'history', 'starters', 'Rasputin', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'Revolution', 'Lenin', 'did', 'Rasputin', 'was', 'actually', 'assasinated', 'way', 'began.What', 'made', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'had', 'musical', 'numbers', 'was', 'were', 'catchy', 'Here', 'seem', 'kind', 'hindrance', 'literally', 'moment', 'where', 'not', 'even', '2', 'minutes', 'pass', ""'re"", 'treated', 'song', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'were', 'memorable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'point.One', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'animation', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'Never', 'did', 'character', 'look', 'kind', 'ugly', 'especially', 'Anastasia', 'voice', 'acting', 'quite', 'top', 'notch', 'featuring', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'as', 'well', 'Hank', 'Azaria.If', 'want', 'notable', 'Bluth', 'films', 'watch', 'American', 'Tail', 'Land', 'Time', 'want', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much']",Anastasia VHS

But anyways, on to the movie:Story: Anastasia, her grandmother, and the rest of the Romanov family are enjoying a royal ball in their palace. But alas, there's always a bad guy,.......Rasputin in this case. He says that Anastasia's whole family will die soon, and that happens (off screen of course). Well, everybody except for Anastasia and her grandma. Her grandma escapes to Paris. &quot;Anya&quot; falls off a train, hits her head, and ends up in an orphanage. 10 years later, two conmen named Dimitri and Vladamer are &quot;collecting&quot; girls that look/act like Anastasia. This is because Marie (Anya's grandma) is holding a grand reward of 10 million rubels for anyone who finds her lost granddaughter. And Anastasia? She is finally released from the orphanage. But instead of going &quot;fishing&quot; like the lady at the orphanage tells her to, she goes to St. Petersburg to find her family. Following her is the undead Rasputin (ha, and you thought he was dead). He's trying to get revenge since Anya lived. The rest of the story follows the journey's of Anastasia, and how she finds her grandmama.As for the historical record? Well, Rasputin was actually a &quot;friend of the family&quot; as you might call him. He helped to cure little Alex, Anastasia's brother, from a fever. From what I've heard, I guess Anya's whole family (including her) was killed. Not a very happy ending is it? Of course, they can't let the kids know this, so it's all &quot;re-arranged&quot;. As for Pooka (the dog), who knows if the Romanov family had a dog or not. Dimitri? He looks suspiciously like Alex dosn't he? And what about Bartok (the bat)? Of course, he is purely fictional. I have to admit that he seemed like the main character more than Anya, since he had the most &quot;personality&quot;. Kind of a cute little guy actually.Overall, it's fun, cute, and whimsicall.

438333,A1W81OCSO03PYH,6304872402,Dorie,"[1, 1]","First of all, unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not think the historical inaccuracy of this film constitutes a problem.  All historical movies are inaccurate to some extent, and this particular film does not purport to reconstruct historical events, but rather to play on a fantasy, on an interesting rumour.  What I did find rather problematic was the fact that we are supposed to identify with the Romanov family, that is to say, to endorse power, tyranny, and aristocracy, at the expense of harsh social realities. We are supposed to feel regret over the lost splendor of the Romanov court, when most Russians did not live like this. Retrospectively, the Russian revolution brought misery and suffering to many, but the idea that one is supposed to sympathize with the czar's family and their plight seems to me problematic.Having said that, the film in itself is quite good though. The animation is flawless, the songs are OK, though only the theme song, Once Upon A December, is great, and the title character is very likable. I enjoyed watching the development of the relationship between Anastasia and Dmitry. However, there were some weak links in the plot, such as the fact that Dmitry and his companion are defined as complete crooks at first, and suddenly we learn that actually they're great human beings.  Not that this is implausible, but I thought the transition from one state to another was too abrupt.  I would have liked to see a gradual development in their characters.Personally, I did not like the white bat character, which, to my taste at least, failed to provide the comic relief it was intended for. I also disliked Rasputin, whose character I felt made no sense in this context, nor do I think is it clear to the unitiated viewer who he is. I did not find him believable as a character posing an obstacle for the heroine, and I think a more realistic solution, such as, I don't know, real bolsheviks pursuing Anastasia, would have worked better.Nevertheless, if one can get over these weak spots, the movie is quite enjoyable, and overall I indeed liked it, because:The Anastasia character is credible and I liked her throughout; she is beautifully dubbed by Kirsten Dunst (as an 8 year old) and then by Meg Ryan (as the 18 year old Anastasia);""Once Upon a December"" is a very good song, and I liked the use of it to express nostalgia, or as an aid to memory;The theme of lost and recollected memory is very well treated;The opening, with the dowager empress's voiceover, is strong;The animation is fantastic.Despite all its faults, the movie is definitely watchable, entertaining, and worthy of repeated viewings.",4,"Good, though not great",1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,2648,"['First', 'other', 'reviewers', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'film', 'problem', 'historical', 'movies', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'extent', 'particular', 'film', 'not', 'purport', 'reconstruct', 'historical', 'events', 'rather', 'play', 'fantasy', 'interesting', 'rumour', 'What', 'did', 'find', 'rather', 'problematic', 'was', 'fact', 'are', 'supposed', 'identify', 'Romanov', 'family', 'say', 'endorse', 'power', 'tyranny', 'aristocracy', 'expense', 'harsh', 'social', 'realities', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'regret', 'lost', 'splendor', 'Romanov', 'court', 'when', 'most', 'Russians', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'Retrospectively', 'Russian', 'revolution', 'brought', 'misery', 'suffering', 'many', 'idea', 'one', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'czar', 'family', 'plight', 'problematic.Having', 'said', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'though', 'animation', 'flawless', 'songs', 'are', 'OK', 'only', 'theme', 'song', 'Once', 'A', 'December', 'great', 'title', 'character', 'very', 'likable', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'development', 'relationship', 'Anastasia', 'Dmitry', 'However', 'were', 'weak', 'links', 'plot', 'such', 'fact', 'Dmitry', 'companion', 'are', 'defined', 'complete', 'crooks', 'first', 'suddenly', 'learn', 'actually', ""'re"", 'great', 'human', 'beings', 'Not', 'implausible', 'thought', 'transition', 'one', 'state', 'was', 'too', 'abrupt', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'gradual', 'development', 'characters.Personally', 'did', 'not', 'white', 'bat', 'character', 'taste', 'least', 'failed', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'intended', 'also', 'disliked', 'Rasputin', 'character', 'felt', 'made', 'sense', 'context', 'do', 'think', 'clear', 'unitiated', 'viewer', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'believable', 'character', 'posing', 'obstacle', 'heroine', 'think', 'more', 'realistic', 'solution', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'bolsheviks', 'pursuing', 'Anastasia', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better.Nevertheless', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'weak', 'spots', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'overall', 'indeed', 'liked', 'Anastasia', 'character', 'credible', 'liked', 'beautifully', 'dubbed', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', '8', 'year', 'old', 'then', 'Meg', 'Ryan', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Anastasia', 'Once', 'December', 'very', 'good', 'song', 'liked', 'use', 'express', 'nostalgia', 'aid', 'memory', 'theme', 'lost', 'recollected', 'memory', 'very', 'well', 'treated', 'opening', 'dowager', 'empress', 'voiceover', 'strong', 'animation', 'fantastic.Despite', 'faults', 'movie', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewings']",Anastasia VHS

I agree with most of it: the animation was good, the songs were wonderful, the characters were fasinating. I would, however, like to add a note in defense  of the film's &quot;villians&quot;, Rasputian and Bartok. Christopher Lloyd  was Rasputian, and he made Rasputian undoubtedly the best character villian  in the history of animated films. He got so _into_ his role, obviously  having a blast with his performance while at the same time doing a  wonderful acting job. Rasputian's voice will send chills down your spine!  I had no trouble believing that Rasputian was a &quot;real&quot; person  (yes, I _know_ he was a real person, but I am talking about his cartoon  version), insane and totally determined to get revenge.  A few have said  that Bartok, the white albino bat that is Rasputian's sidekick, is an  unnecessary character, but I disagree. KUDOS to Hank Azaria as Bartok;  there was some much-needed comic relief in all of Bartok's lines. His  timing was excellent, and he got the best lines of the film. A character  was needed for Rasputian's lines and personality to bounce off of: Bartok  is the ideal character, or bat, for the job!  His sense of humor made the  scenes all the more enjoyable, and were something of a grounding point. I  can't explain it any better than that!  To Hank Azaria; great job!

Why was Rasputin the chief villain? I mean I know that you can't expect too much historical accuracy from an animated movie, but there really was a Prime Evil in the story of Anastasia, the Romanovs and Russia:  and his name was Vladimir Illyich Lenin.Rasputin had nothing to do with the murder of the Romanov family, but the Bolsheviks certainly where brutal and evil, beyond anything in any fairy tale, and their acolytes (eg Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky, the apologist of tyranny and terror). So why where such perfect villains almost completely left out of the movie?Put in Lenin instead of Rasputin as the chief villain/devil role and now you have a classic!

The only thing I knew about Russia was its figure skaters and that Russia used to be a communist nation.  I can remember after the movie was over thinking ""what a nice fairy tale.""  I had absolutely no idea idea that Anastasia or the Romanovs were real people.  But after seeing the film and learning that Anastasia was a real person, and the story itself was LOOSELY based on historical events, I began to research Russian history and culture and have really enjoyed it.The film ""Anastasia"" while not historically accurate by a long shot, is still a great movie with breathtaking animation and a wonderful musical score.  I still can't get the song ""Once upon a December"" out of my head.  The DVD itself has a lot of very entertaining bonus features including: a making of featurette (I'm a sucker for those things), a ""Once upon a December"" sing-a-long, and Aaliyah's music video for ""Journey to the Past.""  My favorite bonus feature is the tour of the imperial palace.  During the tour, you can click on objects in the palace and learn about that particular object as it pretains to Russian history, or culture.  The only thing that dissapointed me about the tour was that I would've liked to have seen more of the palace itself..but oh well.

438355,A3PJQ4742VN84H,6304872402,"Hope this helps ""help""","[1, 1]","Ok, just to get this out there: this movie is straight up a historical fiction.  This is not a docudrama, dramatized history, or whatever non-fiction derivatives there are.  But with that said, this was a brilliant film with a truly complimentary set of &#34;extras&#34; thrown in.  This being their first animated theatrical feature, 20th Century fox definitely shows their pride through the package of this film.CONTENT ISSUES:Ok, this is definitely a family film.  No innuendos or nudity type stuff, no language issues...this is a safe film.  There is violence, but it is well-purposed and not all that vicious.  What I will say, though, is that the villain, Rasputin, can be kinda scary for young kids.  In many ways, his visual presentation is a bit more horrifying/intimidating than most if not all Disney villains out there.  So I would wait for kids to at least be around 10 years of age (as a general suggestion).  But, again, totally nothing to worry about.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):I won't discuss plot points and things, but will just give a general impression.  I really did enjoy the narrative that was told.  It's nothing too complexed but it is told well and presented well.  It definitely is pretty straight forward.  Ultimately, I felt satisfied and complete.  Actually, I felt refreshed and warm fuzzies haha  But, though it was very very well done, I have to say, they really could have slowed down a bit and explored a little more of the ambience.  I would have loved to see more of the happenings in Russia and in Paris.  I would have loved to explore more of the ambient aspects of their train ride.  The film really followed a blatantly point-A-to-point-B kind of storytelling.  I AM DEFINITELY NOT SAYING THIS IS A  TERRIBLY BAD THING, AT ALL.  Again, it was good, but a little more &#34;looking around&#34; instead of rushing through would have been a wonderful way to greatly enhance the tale.  But, the character interaction really makes this film...especially the main 3.MUSIC:Yes, this is a musical...and it's this part that really helps make this tale, fly.  I loved all the numbers except for one...and the music was smartly written, well placed, led up to in a believable manner.  If you want a good taste, the song &#34;Once Upon a December&#34; is really the musical keystone of the film.EXTRAS:I won't list all of them, since they are already listed in the main product description area.  All of them are excellent and fun little additions (though I think the stacking doll game could have been a little more &#34;entertaining&#34;).  But I would like to draw special attention to the &#34;making of&#34; mini-documentary.  This is, by far, one of the best &#34;making of&#34; mini-documentaries that I've seen included with a film or tv series and should be a standard for such things.  Often times, other ones simply touch and grace the various aspects of the production process.  But, here, they go into greater depth.  Not only do you hear about &#34;experiences&#34; and &#34;opinions&#34; from the staff, but they take you through the animation process, the voice over/singing process, and a whole ton of other things, as well.  It's not as good as a more focused documentary in say Discovery or Smithsonian....but they really take you much deeper than most DVD Extras type documentaries I have personally seen.ALL IN ALL:This is a wonderful film for the whole family.  A lot of wonderful lessons and fun interactions.  Also, strong acting as well.  It may be a bit more straightforward than some of would like, but for me, that did not ruin the experience at all.  And the music was simply wonderful.  I do think that this film comes fairly close to being a classic in animated movies, just my opinion of course.  Either way, I hope you take it for a spin and that you'll enjoy this gem, as well.",5,A Magical Look at a Bygone Era,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,3843,"['Ok', 'just', 'get', 'there', 'movie', 'straight', 'up', 'historical', 'fiction', 'not', 'docudrama', 'dramatized', 'history', 'non-fiction', 'derivatives', 'are', 'said', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'truly', 'complimentary', 'set', '34', '34', 'thrown', 'being', 'first', 'animated', 'theatrical', 'feature', '20th', 'Century', 'fox', 'definitely', 'pride', 'package', 'film.CONTENT', 'ISSUES', 'Ok', 'definitely', 'family', 'film', 'innuendos', 'nudity', 'type', 'stuff', 'language', 'issues', 'safe', 'film', 'violence', 'well-purposed', 'not', 'vicious', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'villain', 'Rasputin', 'can', 'be', 'kinda', 'scary', 'young', 'kids', 'many', 'ways', 'visual', 'presentation', 'bit', 'more', 'horrifying/intimidating', 'most', 'not', 'Disney', 'out', 'there', 'would', 'wait', 'kids', 'least', 'be', '10', 'years', 'age', 'general', 'suggestion', 'again', 'totally', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about.PLOT', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'plot', 'points', 'things', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'general', 'impression', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'narrative', 'was', 'told', 'nothing', 'too', 'complexed', 'told', 'well', 'presented', 'well', 'definitely', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'Ultimately', 'felt', 'satisfied', 'complete', 'Actually', 'felt', 'refreshed', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'haha', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'bit', 'explored', 'little', 'more', 'ambience', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'happenings', 'Russia', 'Paris', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'explore', 'more', 'ambient', 'aspects', 'train', 'ride', 'film', 'really', 'followed', 'blatantly', 'point-A-to-point-B', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'AM', 'DEFINITELY', 'NOT', 'SAYING', 'THIS', 'TERRIBLY', 'BAD', 'THING', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Again', 'was', 'good', 'little', 'more', '34', 'looking', '34', 'instead', 'rushing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'way', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'tale', 'character', 'interaction', 'really', 'film', 'especially', 'main', '3.MUSIC', 'Yes', 'musical', 'part', 'really', 'make', 'tale', 'fly', 'loved', 'numbers', 'one', 'music', 'was', 'smartly', 'written', 'well', 'placed', 'led', 'up', 'believable', 'manner', 'want', 'good', 'taste', 'song', '34', 'Once', 'December', '34', 'really', 'musical', 'keystone', 'film.EXTRAS', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'are', 'already', 'listed', 'main', 'product', 'description', 'area', 'are', 'excellent', 'fun', 'little', 'additions', 'think', 'stacking', 'doll', 'game', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', '34', 'entertaining', '34', 'would', 'like', 'draw', 'special', 'attention', '34', 'making', '34', 'mini-documentary', 'far', 'one', 'best', '34', 'making', '34', 'mini-documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'included', 'film', 'tv', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'standard', 'such', 'things', 'Often', 'times', 'other', 'ones', 'simply', 'touch', 'grace', 'various', 'aspects', 'production', 'process', 'here', 'go', 'greater', 'depth', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'hear', '34', 'experiences', '34', '34', 'opinions', '34', 'staff', 'take', 'animation', 'process', 'voice', 'over/singing', 'process', 'whole', 'ton', 'other', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'more', 'focused', 'documentary', 'say', 'Discovery', 'Smithsonian', '.but', 'really', 'take', 'much', 'deeper', 'most', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'type', 'documentaries', 'have', 'personally', 'seen.ALL', 'IN', 'wonderful', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'lessons', 'fun', 'interactions', 'Also', 'strong', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'straightforward', 'would', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'ruin', 'experience', 'music', 'was', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'fairly', 'close', 'being', 'classic', 'animated', 'movies', 'just', 'opinion', 'course', 'way', 'hope', 'take', 'spin', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'gem', 'as', 'well']",Anastasia VHS

It is quite simply a masterpiece, a significant step up from the more familiar early films.  From the quality of the drawing (rich & vivid colors, capturing light most remarkably) to the original music (yes, they burst into song but the melodies are quite compelling and not syrupy at all) to the well-known voice talents, this film really drew me in.  The story is not at all what one would expect for a movie aimed at kids:  Russian Tsar Nicholas II's entire family was arrested, confined and eventually brutally executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but it was speculated at the time that one young daughter, Anastasia, escaped from the palace and so survived.  The film's focus is on the orphaned girl and her search for her family, it is handled well and even believably (although DNA evidence has since disproven the possibility).  As well, the bonus features on Disc 2 of the Family Fun Pack edition included ""The Making of Anastasia"", a behind-the-scenes look at the entire production with commentary by Gary Goldman & Don Bluth, which was excellent.

438362,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,6304872402,J. Edkin,"[13, 14]","Don Bluth is an incredibly gifted artist.  His character designs and animation can be breathtaking.  Unfortunately, he and frequent collaborator Gary Goldman can't tell a cohesive story to save their lives.  Of all of his films I've seen, &quot;Anastasia&quot; is by far their best.  Whether this is because of solid source material (although that didn't stop &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; from falling to pieces story-wise) or the incredible score by Lynn Aherns and Stephen Flaherty, &quot;Anastasia&quot; remains in my estimation Bluth and Goldman's most watchable movie.Based loosely on a play by Marcelle Maurette and Guy Bolton. As well as the 1956 film adaptation of the play by Arthur Laurents, the story turns the mystery of the disappearance of Anastasia, daughter of Czar Nicholas, following the murder of the Russian royal family, into a fairy tale.  You have to ignore everything you know about history in order to accept the execution of the film--it plays loose with the Communist revolution and with Rasputin.Dimitri (voiced with great charm by John Cusack, sung by John Dokuchitz) is a con artist living in St. Petersburg.  Along with his friend Vladimir (the entertaining Kelsey Grammer), he is searching for a young girl who can play the role of the missing Romanoff heir in order to claim a reward from the dowager empress who has escaped to Paris.  He meets Anya (voiced with much character by Meg Ryan, sung by the incredible Liz Callaway) and immediately sees in her the girl to carry out his plans.  As he and Vladimir work with Anya to perfect her ruse, he comes to realize that she is the true Anastasia.Then we add the elements that make it a Don Bluth movie--Anya has a cute dog and there is a magical villain in the (dead) body of Rasputin (played gleefully over the top by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings).  And, of course, Rasputin has his cute animal sidekick in the form of an albino bat, Bartok (the always effective Hank Azaria).  Rasputin wants revenge on the Romanoffs for his undead state and sets off to kill the princess.  It should also be noted that Bernadette Peters and Angele Lansbury round out the voice cast in entertaining performances.Okay, if you can put aside your feelings of misgivings regarding the animal sidekicks and revisionist history, there is much that is entertaining in this film.  The score by Broadway veterans Aherns and Flaherty is probably one of the best ever composed for an animated movie.  The script does provide action, adventure, romance, and comedy.  It's probably the most human script directed by Bluth and Goldman.  There is some spectacular animation, the runaway train scene stands out as truly effective.There are drawbacks.  It is trying too hard to out-Disney Disney, from the opening number to the very structure of the story.  The computer animation isn't always well integrated.  The music box never looks like it exists in the same reality as the animated characters and the afore-mentioned train sequence is obviously not cell animation.  But these drawback are relatively minor compared to the overblown climax of the movie.  Still, flaws aside, it does entertain.  I have watched it several times and have definitely gotten my money's worth of this DVD.The DVD ovvers you the option of fullscreen and letterbox presentation, a short featurette about the making of the movie, and a pair of sing-along sequences.All in all, I recommend this movie to people who enjoy animated musicals.  If you like this, you may also like Disney's &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, Frank Oz's musical version of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare before Christmas&quot;.(C)2001 Joe Edkin",3,The Best Don Bluth Movie I've Seen,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,3836,"['Don', 'Bluth', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'artist', 'character', 'designs', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'breathtaking', 'Unfortunately', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'Gary', 'Goldman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'cohesive', 'story', 'save', 'lives', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Anastasia', 'quot', 'far', 'best', 'solid', 'source', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'quot', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'quot', 'falling', 'pieces', 'story-wise', 'incredible', 'score', 'Lynn', 'Aherns', 'Stephen', 'Flaherty', 'quot', 'Anastasia', 'quot', 'estimation', 'Bluth', 'Goldman', 'most', 'watchable', 'movie.Based', 'loosely', 'play', 'Marcelle', 'Maurette', 'Guy', 'Bolton', 'As', 'well', '1956', 'film', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Laurents', 'story', 'mystery', 'disappearance', 'Anastasia', 'daughter', 'Czar', 'Nicholas', 'following', 'murder', 'Russian', 'royal', 'family', 'fairy', 'tale', 'have', 'ignore', 'everything', 'know', 'history', 'order', 'accept', 'execution', 'film', 'loose', 'Communist', 'revolution', 'Rasputin.Dimitri', 'voiced', 'great', 'charm', 'John', 'Cusack', 'sung', 'John', 'Dokuchitz', 'con', 'artist', 'living', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'friend', 'Vladimir', 'entertaining', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'searching', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'role', 'missing', 'Romanoff', 'heir', 'order', 'claim', 'reward', 'dowager', 'empress', 'who', 'escaped', 'Paris', 'Anya', 'voiced', 'much', 'character', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'sung', 'incredible', 'Liz', 'Callaway', 'immediately', 'sees', 'girl', 'carry', 'out', 'plans', 'Vladimir', 'work', 'Anya', 'perfect', 'ruse', 'realize', 'true', 'Anastasia.Then', 'add', 'elements', 'make', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'movie', 'Anya', 'cute', 'dog', 'magical', 'villain', 'dead', 'body', 'Rasputin', 'played', 'gleefully', 'top', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'sung', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'course', 'Rasputin', 'cute', 'animal', 'sidekick', 'form', 'albino', 'bat', 'Bartok', 'always', 'effective', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Rasputin', 'revenge', 'Romanoffs', 'undead', 'state', 'sets', 'off', 'kill', 'princess', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Angele', 'Lansbury', 'round', 'out', 'voice', 'cast', 'entertaining', 'performances.Okay', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'feelings', 'misgivings', 'regarding', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'revisionist', 'history', 'much', 'entertaining', 'film', 'score', 'Broadway', 'veterans', 'Aherns', 'Flaherty', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'composed', 'animated', 'movie', 'script', 'provide', 'action', 'adventure', 'romance', 'comedy', 'probably', 'most', 'human', 'script', 'directed', 'Bluth', 'Goldman', 'spectacular', 'animation', 'runaway', 'train', 'scene', 'out', 'truly', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'out-Disney', 'Disney', 'opening', 'number', 'very', 'structure', 'story', 'computer', 'animation', ""n't"", 'always', 'well', 'integrated', 'music', 'box', 'never', 'same', 'reality', 'animated', 'characters', 'afore-mentioned', 'train', 'sequence', 'obviously', 'not', 'cell', 'animation', 'drawback', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'compared', 'overblown', 'climax', 'movie', 'Still', 'flaws', 'aside', 'entertain', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'definitely', 'gotten', 'money', 'worth', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', 'ovvers', 'option', 'fullscreen', 'letterbox', 'presentation', 'short', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'pair', 'sing-along', 'sequences.All', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'animated', 'musicals', 'like', 'may', 'also', 'like', 'Disney', 'quot', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'quot', 'quot', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'quot', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'musical', 'version', 'quot', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'quot', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'quot', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'C', '2001', 'Joe', 'Edkin']",Anastasia VHS

On one hand, the story line was terrific, even though Rasputin was a bit scary at times. The songs were wonderful, and I especially liked &quot;At the Beginning&quot; (if that's the right name for the title.) The animation was superb, especially in the &quot;Once upon a December&quot; sequence. The characters were believeable and enjoyable, and I liked watching Anya's relationship with Dmitri go from constant bickering to genuine affection. The reunion with her grandmother was touching as well.However, the historical inaccuracies in this film bothered me, especially since I've read a lot about the real Romanov family and know that their situation was nothing like what's portrayed in the film. I realize that this is a kid's movie, but I think the directors rearranged the facts a bit too much. To begin with, Anastasia was not a child when her family was murdered -- she was 17. The family's massacre took place in Siberia in 1918, not in St. Petersburg in 1916, as the film depicts. And Ansastasia's grandmother lived in Denmark, not Paris. Apparently the prouducers just thought Denmark wasn't impressive enough for a background setting.Other than the distortion of historical facts, I enjoyed this film.

438367,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,6304872402,Joshua Koppel,"[2, 2]","At the end of last week I had the opportunity to see Anastasia.  Due to the prevalence of magic and the changing of history, Anastasia does qualify as a fantasy film.When the Russian empire falls (in a fortnight due to Rasputin's curse), young Anastasia escapes with her life but not her memory.  An old member of the court and an old member of the palace staff look for a girl they can pose as Anastasia in order to collect a reward.  The girl they pick turns out to be the genuine article.  After some harrowing adventures made more difficult by the efforts of Rasputin from beyond the grave, Anastasia is reunited with her grandmother.  Then, just as all obstacles and plot complications are out of the way of romance the final showdown with Rasputin occurs.One of the main reasons I had wanted to see this film was that it was the first true challenge to Disney's animation empire.  I was very surprised to find out that Don Bluth (All Dogs Go To Heaven and other dogs) was behind the film.  Bluth seems to have finally figured out how to make a good film and Anastasia will hopefully not be the last.There are a few faults (of course) with the overall plot and the dealings with history but if one accepts this as alternate history they are not a real problem.  For one, Rasputin dies by accident (although he does drown).  Anastasia is found and reunited with her family.  The Russian Empire is likened to Camelot where all is good for everyone.  Rubles seem to have worth outside of Russia.  But if you can handle that, you should have no problem with the story.  The only real problems I had with the production involved the musical numbers and the animation.  There was some good music but it just wasn't as clear as it should be.  Oftentimes one had to guess what the song was about.  The problem with the animation stems from to jarring an interface between the computer animation and the cell animation.  Hopefully these small problems can be eliminated in future projects.So, overall I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun story with some old cliches eliminated (Tracy thinks they too a close look at the success of Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  The animation was beautiful, if jarring in a few spots.  The characters were likeable and believable and were backed by some excellent voice talents.  If you get a chance to see this one on a big screen you should take that opportunity; it's worth it.

I love the characters, the way they look, and the reluctant love story that blossoms-- great chemistry for animated characters!  The animation is unforgettable.  The three major action sequences were great, especially the train wreck-- wow.I don't know when my kids will be old enough to view this (maybe around 8?), but after warning them that the spooky guy is only part of a cartoon, I hope they like this movie.

""Kimberly""","[2, 3]","When I was little this was my favorite movie I had the Anatasia Barbies, C.D., saw the ice show, had a stuffed Pooka and computer games. Now even as a teen I still get a kick out of watching this flick.Taking place after the Russian Revolution in St. Petersberg Dimitri a street rat trys to pull off the biggest scam in history by hiring an imposter to claim that she is the long lost Czarress Anatasia of Russia. Well, this is when young Anya comes into play being an orphan who was recently released with no recolection of her family-she's on a search to find them. When, she accidently bumps into Dimitri. Dimitri sees a resemblance to the long lost Anatasia and decides to use Anya(Anya dosn't know his plan). Well, only 2 problems an evil Rasputin is following Anya trying to make certain she dosn't succeed by putting curses and demons in her way and she is falling in love with Dimitri. When, Dimitri and Anya finally arrive in Paris to pull of the scheme- Dimitri realizes that Anya really is Anatasia and that he must never see her again.This movie may not be historical accurate but what do expect when you watch an animated movie??? With an all-star voice over cast and done in the time of classic animation this movie will never go out of style. I still enjoy watching it and I find myself missing the days of the less high-tech animation style. The music in this is also touching, I own the soundtrack and I love the song ""Once Upon A December.""

The quality of Disney films varies greatly from film to film.  Bluth  has been far more consistent. Finally, the criticisms that this film isn't  historically accurate are moot.

438382,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6304872402,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 32]","""Anastasia"" is a animated musical that works despite some serious problems fundamental to the story for anybody who knows anything about Russian history.  The legend of Anastasia has in roots in a historical truth: that when the Communists executed the Romanovs and gunned them down, the young Grand Duchess was not shot; she fainted.  When it was discovered she was still alive she was clubbed and bayoneted to death.  But the ""truth"" remains, she was not shot dead with the rest of her family.  In this version that issued is rendered moot because the young Anastasia never joins her parents as they fled St. Petersburg.  However, the greatest historical liberty is the idea that the Russian Revolution was the result of a curse the mad monk Gregorei Rasputin laid on the Romanovs.  Forget Lenin and the Communists overthrowing the Czar; it was a crazy monk and his friend, an albino bat named Bartok.However, ""Anastasia"" has several things working in its favor to counter-attack this nonsense.  First, there is the haunting ""Once Upon a December,"" which carries the mood of the story perfectly and comes into play at several key moments in the film.  The rest of the music is above average and avoids cuteness for the most part (the bad guys get the fun song with ""In the Dark of the Night""), but ""Once Upon a December"" is musically the cornerstone of the whole film.  Second, there is the wonderful vocal work by Kelsey Grammer and Angela Landsbury as the supporting characters Vladimir and the Dowager Empress Marie; they are the pair who provide the film with its heart while Anna and Dmitri wait for their brains to catch up with their hearts.  Third, in true giant cartoon movie style, the film reduces everything to the fundamental desire to go home and be part of a family.Ultimately, the backbone of the story is more the 1956 Ingrid Bergman film version of the ""Anastasia"" story than history: a con artist wants to earn the reward for finding the lost heiress to the Russian thrown and turns an amnesia victim into Anastasia only to discover that she is the real thing and that he is in love with her.  Then basically they throw in the standard evil person trying to keep the princess and her boyfriend apart (think Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" except instead of an evil queen it is a mad monk and instead of a giant dragon there is a small albino bat and the princess is really a Grand Duchess and the prince is now a former servant boy, but other than that they are remarkably the same).  Besides, kids like this film and they should be allowed to do so for a few years before they discover they can not learn history from movies (and should never let watching a movie substitute for reading an assigned book).",4,Just do not expect historical accuracy in a cartoon musical,1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,2722,"['Anastasia', 'animated', 'musical', 'serious', 'problems', 'fundamental', 'story', 'anybody', 'who', 'anything', 'Russian', 'history', 'legend', 'Anastasia', 'roots', 'historical', 'truth', 'when', 'Communists', 'executed', 'Romanovs', 'gunned', 'down', 'young', 'Grand', 'Duchess', 'was', 'not', 'shot', 'fainted', 'When', 'was', 'discovered', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'was', 'clubbed', 'bayoneted', 'death', 'truth', 'remains', 'was', 'not', 'shot', 'dead', 'rest', 'family', 'version', 'issued', 'rendered', 'moot', 'young', 'Anastasia', 'never', 'parents', 'fled', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'However', 'greatest', 'historical', 'liberty', 'idea', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'was', 'result', 'curse', 'mad', 'monk', 'Gregorei', 'Rasputin', 'laid', 'Romanovs', 'Forget', 'Lenin', 'Communists', 'overthrowing', 'Czar', 'was', 'crazy', 'monk', 'friend', 'albino', 'bat', 'named', 'Bartok.However', 'Anastasia', 'several', 'things', 'working', 'favor', 'counter-attack', 'nonsense', 'First', 'haunting', 'Once', 'December', 'mood', 'story', 'perfectly', 'play', 'several', 'key', 'moments', 'film', 'rest', 'music', 'above', 'average', 'avoids', 'cuteness', 'most', 'part', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'fun', 'song', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Once', 'December', 'musically', 'cornerstone', 'whole', 'film', 'Second', 'wonderful', 'vocal', 'work', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Angela', 'Landsbury', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Vladimir', 'Dowager', 'Empress', 'Marie', 'are', 'pair', 'who', 'provide', 'film', 'heart', 'Anna', 'Dmitri', 'wait', 'brains', 'catch', 'up', 'hearts', 'Third', 'true', 'giant', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'style', 'film', 'everything', 'fundamental', 'desire', 'go', 'home', 'be', 'part', 'family.Ultimately', 'backbone', 'story', 'more', '1956', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'film', 'version', 'Anastasia', 'story', 'history', 'con', 'artist', 'earn', 'reward', 'finding', 'lost', 'heiress', 'Russian', 'thrown', 'amnesia', 'victim', 'Anastasia', 'only', 'discover', 'real', 'thing', 'love', 'Then', 'basically', 'throw', 'standard', 'evil', 'person', 'trying', 'keep', 'princess', 'boyfriend', 'apart', 'think', 'Disney', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'instead', 'evil', 'queen', 'mad', 'monk', 'instead', 'giant', 'dragon', 'small', 'albino', 'bat', 'princess', 'really', 'Grand', 'Duchess', 'prince', 'now', 'former', 'servant', 'boy', 'other', 'are', 'remarkably', 'same', 'Besides', 'kids', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'so', 'few', 'years', 'discover', 'can', 'not', 'learn', 'history', 'movies', 'should', 'never', 'let', 'watching', 'movie', 'substitute', 'reading', 'assigned', 'book']",Anastasia VHS

438384,ACC8K30ZFCB0M,6304872402,Lisa Dawn,"[121, 129]","PLEASE BE AWARE:  The lovely cover image you see on Amazon is actually from the first DVD release of this movie.  If you order this product, you will receive something that looks like &lt;a href=""[...]"">this&lt;/a>. (Unfortunately.)Despite the horrible artwork on the cover, this DVD set is by far one of the best 2-disk special editions I have ever seen. The movie is presented in its original widescreen cinemascope glory with sparkling menus, tons of extras, a tour of the castle, and a bonus movie. If it only had a concept art gallery, I would put it all the way up there with the Disney Platinum Editions.The first disk makes use of a map of Anya's journal to Paris as the main menu integrated with clips from the movie. It also has something the Disney DVDs have been lagging on lately--a commentary. A commentary, no doubt, with Don Bloth and Gary Goldman, the two masterminds behind this film and many other animated masterpieces.Aside from that, the first disk also contains bonus features on how to draw four of the main characters in the movie. Now, most ""how"" to draw features start out with a perfect drawing of a character and then show three steps, each with perfectly matching lines and expect you to do exactly the same thing, which is simply ridiculous. This one was different, though. Don Bluth hosted four beautiful art sessions talking very realistically about how real artists do it, from 6B pencils to kneaded erasers to the fact that it's okay to make mistakes. He went through the process step by step and amazingly, his drawings looked very sketchy and none looked exactly like the character he was drawing. I thought this was wonderful because it teaches that not all drawings come out perfect at first and even the best artists don't just sit down, put their pencil to the paper, and have a perfect picture magically appear. The only thing I didn't like about this feature was that you had to click Continue after each step or it would just stay paused.The other main feature on the disk was a singalong track containing songs from various older 20th Century Fox movies and hosted by a girl claiming to be Anastasia, but sounding nothing like her older or younger voices. The funny thing is, most of the songs on this track had absolutely nothing to do with Anastasia. In fact, I was surprised they expected kids to buy this DVD and know about these old movies such as Young Frankenstein, Shirley Temple, and many others including songs from the other newly rereleased animated Fox ""Family Fun Edition"" DVD, Fern Gully. Despite having little to do with the film, this 45-minute singalong track felt complete enough to sell on its own without any other attachments so it was a very hearty feature.The second disk had the must unenthusiastic narrator I have ever heard in my life. Never the less, the disk's menu is a beautiful CGI tour of the Romanov palace. Each shelf contained objects that the real Anastasia might have had along with a description of their use and place in history. Some objects turned out to be games and others were more bonus features.The meat of the disk was a 45-minute documentary about the making of the film. It was very nice to hear from all the voice artists and other people involved, but the best part came from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's commentary. Those two men always know exactly what to say! Their honest, straightforward, and down to earth nature really made this DVD a gem to own. They have no intention of playing down to a young audience and are clearly very passionate about what they do. It was always wonderful to hear their insights on the movie and the art of animation in general and they really made this set worthwhile.Among the other features on the disk were a music video of Aaliyah's rendition of ""Journey to the Past,"" a trivia game with questions that were not too easy, but not too hard about the film, and a virtual paper doll of Anastasia. There was also a multi-language reel of ""Journey to the Past"" and ""Once Upon a December,"" preceeded by a list of phonetic letters. The ""karoake"" section of the reel was extremely tedious because it would first show Anya singing a line in one language, followed by two girls who were being used as examples of how phonetic letters are pronounced repeating that line, then the line was played without singing so ""you"" could sing it in that language, and then Anya would sing it one more time and these four cuts would repeat for every line in the song in every different language. Fortunately you also have the option of just watching the multi-language song reel by itself without the girls or karaoke versions.Now we come to the icing on the cake. Not only do you get the movie Anastasia in this set, but you also get its spin-off film, Bartok the Magnificent, absolutely free! This 60-minute film is too long to be a short, but too short to be a movie and isn't really worth buying by itself. However, considering that it's free, it's quite a worthwhile bonus feature indeed! With a unique story, original musical numbers, and everyone's favorite pink and white bat, it's sure to entertain for at least one sitting even if you never want to watch it again after that. The movie has nothing to do with Anastasia, but instead involves Bartok trying to rescue the kidnapped prince of Moscow. There are unfortunately no cameos of anyone else in Anastasia, but nevertheless, it's a cute flick.At $10 on Amazon, this DVD is an absolute steal and anyone in their right mind should grab it the first chance they get. Not only do you get a gorgeous and expertly crafted film, but you also get a SingAlong movie, a second spin-off movie, games, historical references, and beautifully insightful commentary from the ever-devoted, ever-friendly Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. The princess Anastasia has truly returned to her rightful throne. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because of the cover art.",4,Beautifully crafted DVD!,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,5935,"['PLEASE', 'BE', 'AWARE', 'lovely', 'cover', 'image',

Christopher Lloyd does a fabulous job doing the voice for the role, but the character himself adds nothing to the plot, and his screen time is when you start to feel time dragging.  Many of his scenes also make the movie unsuitable for young or sensitive children.  While the majority of the movie would be entertaining for all ages, Rasputin's scenes tend to involve depictions of his rotting corpse that would've scared me as a child, and I find them unpleasant even now.The rest of the movie is really rather well done.  The animation, while not spectacular or awe-inspiring, is pleasant and has character.  The dialogue is rather clever, and the voice actors do a very nice job delivering it.  There's a great mix of fun, adventure, and humor, to go along with the sentimental parts that will touch your heart.  The highlight of the movie is definitely its soundtrack.  Even if the plot does nothing for you, the songs are beautiful.

A necklace with the words ""Together In Paris"" enscribed on it.It's a beautifuly done movie, breathtaking animation- how can you NOT get shivers up and down your spine during the ""Once Upon A December"" scene? I know I can't. Rasputin in the cartoon looks rather like his historical counterpart, very, very creepy. I rather enjoyed how they made him ""Undead"" as in real life he was VERY hard to kill. (I don't remember HOW many times they attempted to kill Rasputin.)Other than Rasputins looks, and several smaller details, the movie is largely historically unaccurate, but wonderful nontheless.My one complaint? Sometimes Don's animation goes.... funny when he's trying to animate humans from a particular point of view. It could be just me, but I think he has that problem in ALL his animated films.

438391,A2G7JFHNUEC45G,6304872402,"Maria ""Maria Kanai""","[11, 13]","&quot;Anastasia&quot; is my 2nd favorite Disney Animation movie (My most favorite one is &quot;The Quest for Camelot&quot;)!! It's got fun and lovely songs, very nice animation characters, and lots of excitement! This movie is great to watch with your family.This movie tells of the lost Russian princess Anastasia and her goal to find her true identity and how her family was killed by the curse of the evil sorceror, Rasputin (The revolution was the curse). When the revolution started in Russia, Anastasia, the royal family's youngest daugther, escapes barely with her life, but loses her memory when she tried to get on the train to Paris with her royal Grandmother. Anastasia falls from the train and hits her head but lives.Demetre, who was the kitchen boy when the fateful day had happened,and his assistant, Vladimer hears that the Empress(which is the Grandmother) offers a huge amount of money for the one who finds her lost Russian princess, Anastasia. Demetree and Vladimer tries to find someone who looks like Anastasia to fool the Empress and get away with the money. They meet Anastasia, who calls herself Ania, and she is trying to find a way to get to Paris. The reason she wants to go to Paris is because her Grandmother had given her a music box with a key to make the music play.Ania (or Anastasia) has the key but does not remember how she had gotten it there or what it was for. On the key was an inscription: Together in Paris. Demetre and Vladimer is very suprised at Ania's likeness with Anastasia and 'tricks' her into pretending like Anastasia. They go off to Paris together but little do they know that Rasputin was still alive (but was falling apart into pieces because he had sold his soul to destroy the royal Russian family!) and had sent his evil minions to kill Anastasia. For if Anastasia was killed, Rasputin would no longer be 'falling apart'.Can Anastasia and her 'friends' escape from the ghostly demons? Would Anastasia be able to recover her true identily?I love this movie and it's wonderful to watch again and again! In my opinion, I think this movie had the best animation. I especially liked Rasputin's assistant, Bartok the Bat. Bartok wasn't really bad. I also liked Demetre, even though he WAS rather greedy at first, he became one of the heros in this movie.

And what a wonderful little story they tell. It  is of a young woman who looks very much like Anastasia, but cannot remember  her childhood. Will her seach for discovery lead her to finding that she is  indeed the Princess Anastasia? Or will her hopes of finding a family be  dashed in Paris? So we have as this story unfolds one of the first, if not  the first, animated Movie that is aimed squarely at not only children but  their parents as well. The addition of Bartok and Rasputin are definite  adds for Children, but the rest of the Movie plays like a very nice  romantic comedy.The animation is top notch, in fact after seeing this  movie again, after recently having seen _Tarzan_ made me realize how good  the animation really is. Personal tastes may vary, but I find the animation  much better than most of Disney's work.The voice acting is very good.  Meg Ryan plays the role of Anastasia, and John Cusak plays the role of  Dimitri.The music is very good as well, and while they are not as  memorable as _The Little Mermaid_ or _Beauty and the Beast_, they are still  very good.As far as the DVD is concerned, I think Disney could learn a  lot from Fox Video. We have a Making of documentary, a little featurette,  the standard trailer stuff, and then two Sing-a-long songs that will  definitely appear to the younger audience.If you are looking upon  building a DVD library, especially if you have Kids or like animation, then  this is a cannot miss purchase.",5,An outstanding Movie.,959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,1784,"['Now', 'know', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'said', 'Anastasia', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'had', 'story', 'have', 'here', 'least', 'think.That', 'fun', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'so', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'what', 'scenario', 'given', 'life', 'Twentieth', 'century', 'Fox', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'what', 'wonderful', 'little', 'story', 'tell', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'Anastasia', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'childhood', 'Will', 'seach', 'discovery', 'lead', 'finding', 'indeed', 'Princess', 'Anastasia', 'will', 'hopes', 'finding', 'family', 'be', 'dashed', 'Paris', 'have', 'story', 'one', 'first', 'not', 'first', 'animated', 'Movie', 'aimed', 'squarely', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'parents', 'well', 'addition', 'Bartok', 'Rasputin', 'are', 'definite', 'Children', 'rest', 'Movie', 'very', 'nice', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'fact', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'recently', 'having', 'seen', '_Tarzan_', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'animation', 'really', 'Personal', 'tastes', 'may', 'vary', 'find', 'animation', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'Disney', 'work.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'role', 'Anastasia', 'John', 'Cusak', 'role', 'Dimitri.The', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', '_The', 'Little', 'Mermaid_', '_Beauty', 'Beast_', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'good.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'think', 'Disney', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'Fox', 'Video', 'have', 'Making', 'documentary', 'little', 'featurette', 'standard', 'trailer', 'stuff', 'then', 'two', 'Sing-a-long', 'songs', 'will', 'definitely', 'appear', 'younger', 'audience.If', 'are', 'looking', 'building', 'DVD', 'library', 'especially', 'have', 'Kids', 'animation', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'purchase']",Anastasia VHS

438398,A370Z6I5GBWU44,6304872402,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[2, 2]","The real-life tale of Princess Anastasia and the Romanov family is a very sad one, caused by the Russian Revolution and various events within it that piled up on one another to doom an innocent family who had the bad luck to be royals in a time where the upper classes were increasingly scorned.None of this is shown in this movie. The downfall of Anastasia's family comes from the evil wizard Rasputin, who plots and carries out the ruin of most of the family, leaving Anastasia an orphan, her memories lost. Fast forward ten years later, and Anastasia is now Anya, an eighteen-year-old girl in 1926 (in real life, Anastasia would have been twenty-five in this year) This Disney Anastasia bears little if any resemblance to the real Anastasia Romanov, but the story itself is enjoyable for Disney fare, with some fun musical numbers and some really nice animation.Bits and pieces of the real story can be seen here - Anastasia's grandmother Maria Feodorovna (formerly a Danish Princess before she married the Czar and became mother to Nicholas II) really did survive the Revolution after losing her son and daughter-in-law. Maria has saved things from her family, including a painting. The painting is one that the real Anastasia did, so I thought it was cool that they incorporated that in the film.

The 3D and 2D mesh isn't as good in some places as one would like it to be, but (a) it was 1997 and (b) we still can't pull it off now in 2005!

It's useless to describe it.  Words cannot express how mysterious and haunting and amazing and joyous and creepy and astounding every second of listening to it is.  The rest of the songs, while not quite as good, are still enjoyable.And the writing...Oh, the writing was fantastic.  To those of you who wanted a historically accurate Anastasia, I have two words for you: TOUGH BEANS.  Did you REALLY expect a historically accurate Anastasia.  and besides, the rest of the movie is so amazing that you HAVE to just let it go.

However, when those graves were at last discovered it seems that the youngest of his children, the princess Anastasia, was not among the bodies.  Even before this discovery it was rumored that Anja had escaped her fate with a sympathetic soldier from the Royal Guard.  Whatever the truth, to this day, no one really knows what became of the little princess.Don Bluth's ""Anastasia"" attempts to offer up a fanciful account of the 'what if' scenerio that, while void of facts, is an engaging piece of musical fiction that really brings down the house.  So, in this case, Anja (voiced by Meg Ryan) is a precocious, independant woman growing up in impoverished Russia. She is suffering from amnesia when a con artist (voiced by John Cusack) reasons that she would be a great imposter for his scheme to steal a reward offered by the real Anastasia's grandmother who is exhiled in Paris.  One problem - the ghost of Rasputin (a figure of mythical interest in his own time)is out to destroy the last of the royals before she gets to Paris.As is the case with animated movies, the blood and guts of the story are toned down.  Musical numbers are added in and everything is treated to an ultra high gloss glamor treatment that, while not historically accurate, is one hell of a show besides.  THIS IS BAR NONE THE BEST NON-DISNEY ANIMATED FEATURE FILM!  Bluth and his associates have created a rich tapestry of characters married to lush background drawings and a masterful score that really sets the film on a grand scale apart from anything North American cartoon buffs have seen since Walt Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY, nearly 50 years before.Fox has given us the film in both widescreen and full frame formats.  Unfortunately the widescreen version is not anamorphic - a genuine disappointment.  That said, there's really nothing else to complain about.  Colors are eye-popping.  Fine detail is extremely well defined.  The sonic experience has to be heard to be believed.  We also get a documentary on the making of the movie which is informative and fun and the original theatrical trailer and Richard Marx music video ""Life Is A Journey"".  This is a great family film that I wish more adults would see.  It combines all the virtues and esthetics of the Hollywood/Broadway musical and animated feature film.

The Romanovs were detained by the Red Army and then executed in their basement.  They did not escape the communist forces that were taking over the country.  Even so, Don Bluth and company have rewritten history for a child friendly film that is sure to entertain for a couple of hours.Anastasia is separated from her family during their escape from the family palace in Moscow, and is relegated to the life of a young vagabond girl who runs into an equally vagabond young man who, as fate would have it, served in her families household.It is a heart warming tale of a girl lost from her parents only to rediscover their fate in one of the world's most romantic cities.  Don Bluth's animated production values, character designs and animation itself, are unparalled as usual.  Character expressions, gestures, and overall movement and perspective are first rate, and beat anything foreign or domestic at the time it was made.My only beef is that the DVD cover art on the disk I bought is not the classic still from the film with Anastasia looking up at the viewer, but the idiotic cartoonified pose of the two main characters holding hands with one another at the base of a staircase.

Personally, if kids are interested in the history of the czars and Anastasia, this movie will spur  them to look further into the subject. I do agree with the person who said  that Rasputin's presence in the story was kind of unneccessary, and seemed  like a 'forced' bad guy, like they just needed a villan thrown into the  storyline (the whole falling apart thing was cool, though). He and Bartok  have a strong resemblance to Jafar and Iago in &quot;Aladdin&quot;.But I  digress.Being an artist and musician, I like to watch animated stuff for  those reasons best. The animation in &quot;Anastasia&quot; was very good,  especially the people and the background designs. I didn't care for the  scenes that overpowered drawn animation with computer animation, though.  (check out the stone horse @ the end.ea. chara looked good separate,but not  togeather)The different types of animation didn't flow as smoothly as some  other computer/traditionally animated films.

438429,A37DZX4F5RU2PQ,6304872402,Sarita Dutta,"[4, 5]","The story of the lost Romanov princess has become a legend in itself; captivating the interests of people worldwide. To mould such a story into an animated movie was certainly no easy task; but what directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman have achieved is an unique masterpiece you cannot help marvel at. The Little Mermaid had re-incarnated animation in 1989 and the following years saw a saga of animated hits from the mouse. But after the record breaking `Lion King' and acclaimed `Pocahontas', Disney began to lose its iron grip at the box-office. The rather disappointing Hercules did not help to hype up the position at all. Fox's first animated motion picture possesses a beauty and splendor comparable in every way to major Disney hits like Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King.It is dramatic yet spontaneous, humorous yet emotional; and although not historically very accurate, it indulges in a dramatic fictional narrative, combining an essence of traditional values and modern story-telling that give the movie a spectacular outlook. The visuals are extremely vibrant and poignant, with colorful spell-binding backgrounds in which are carefully blended the CGI sequences.  Stephen Flaherty's music is rich and deeply melodious. From the Broadway styled `Learn To Do It' to the Oscar nominated `Journey To The Past', the songs are indeed memorable and leave a lasting impression on your mind. The tune that lingers on and on is `Once Upon A December', its melody hauntingly beautiful and probing. And for those who love fast numbers, you will certainly adore the pop end title `At The Beginning' by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis.David Newman's score, although short, is simply one of the best to ever grace an animated movie; its emotional gravity so astoundingly deep and soul-searching that it makes you forget it is an animated movie you are watching. Newman was honored with his first Academy Award nomination for Anastasia. As to why he did not win remains a big mystery to me. Anne Dudley's The Full Monty, which eventually won the best Musical Score in 1997, is at best tolerable and certainly pales before Anastasia's heavenly appeal.Fox's voice cast comprises of renowned on-screen actors and actresses, who have delivered praiseworthy performances. Meg Ryan is enthusiastic, fiery and brings surprising life to the character of Anastasia . John Cusack portrays Dimitri, and his voice adds amazing warmth and glow to the lines of the male protagonist. Other talents include Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, Bernadette Peters and Kirsten Dunst. The best role probably belongs to Angela Lansbury who puts excruciating depth in the character of Anastasia's grandma, the Dowager Empress Marie.The main highlight of the movie is its sentimental appeal, cleverly mixing the elements of heart, emotion, sacrifice and depth that is sure to conquer any romantic heart. I repeat, there are times which make you forget that it is an animated movie you are watching, not a real one. The re-union scene where the Empress Marie says ""Oh Anastasia My Anastasia!"" is voiced with such depth that it brings tears to the eyes. To imagine the joy of a woman who has lost her son and her whole family during a revolution, who has been hurt countless times by imposters, to finally know that her grandchild is still alive!Fox's DVD offers a 1.33:1 pan and scan as well as a 2.35:1 widescreen picture. The anamorphic transfer looks very crisp and colorful. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound makes good use of surround, nicely highlighting the score and special effects. The special features offer an in-depth look at the making. Also included are a featurette, two trailors, two sing-alongs and a puzzle game.An unique masterpiece, Anastasia has marvelous music and an excellent storyline which depicts two very strong women. The movie, though, is geared more at the mature audiences. Ten-year olds will hardly understand the emotional moments or the occasional verbal clashes between the two protagonists during the first half of the movie. I highly recommend it to people who truly appreciate artistic and emotional beauty. Anastasia stands as a classic to be cherished now and forever.",5,AN EMOTIONAL MASTERPIECE; A CELEBRATION OF LIFE!!,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,4191,"['story', 'lost', 'Romanov', 'princess', 'become', 'legend', 'captivating', 'interests', 'people', 'worldwide', 'mould', 'story', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'easy', 'task', 'what', 'directors', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'Gary', 'Goldman', 'have', 'achieved', 'unique', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'marvel', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'had', 're-incarnated', 'animation', '1989', 'following', 'years', 'saw', 'saga', 'animated', 'hits', 'mouse', 'record', 'breaking', 'Lion', 'King', 'acclaimed', 'Pocahontas', 'Disney', 'began', 'lose', 'iron', 'grip', 'box-office', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'Hercules', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'hype', 'up', 'position', 'Fox', 'first', 'animated', 'motion', 'picture', 'beauty', 'splendor', 'comparable', 'way', 'major', 'Disney', 'hits', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Lion', 'King.It', 'dramatic', 'yet', 'spontaneous', 'humorous', 'yet', 'emotional', 'not', 'historically', 'very', 'accurate', 'dramatic', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'combining', 'essence', 'traditional', 'values', 'modern', 'story-telling', 'give', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'outlook', 'visuals', 'are', 'extremely', 'vibrant', 'poignant', 'colorful', 'spell-binding', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'carefully', 'blended', 'CGI', 'sequences', 'Stephen', 'Flaherty', 'music', 'rich', 'deeply', 'melodious', 'Broadway', 'styled', 'Learn', 'Do', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Journey', 'Past', 'songs', 'are', 'indeed', 'memorable', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'mind', 'tune', 'Once', 'A', 'December', 'melody', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'probing', 'who', 'love', 'fast', 'numbers', 'will', 'certainly', 'adore', 'pop', 'end', 'title', 'Beginning', 'Richard', 'Marx', 'Donna', 'Lewis.David', 'Newman', 'score', 'short', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'grace', 'animated', 'movie', 'emotional', 'gravity', 'so', 'astoundingly', 'deep', 'soul-searching', 'forget', 'animated', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'Newman', 'was', 'honored', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Anastasia', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'big', 'mystery', 'Anne', 'Dudley', 'Full', 'Monty', 'eventually', 'won', 'best', 'Musical', 'Score', '1997', 'best', 'tolerable', 'certainly', 'pales', 'Anastasia', 'heavenly', 'appeal.Fox', 'voice', 'cast', 'comprises', 'renowned', 'on-screen', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'delivered', 'praiseworthy', 'performances', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'enthusiastic', 'fiery', 'surprising', 'life', 'character', 'Anastasia', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Dimitri', 'voice', 'amazing', 'warmth', 'glow', 'lines', 'male', 'protagonist', 'Other', 'talents', 'include', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'best', 'role', 'probably', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'who', 'excruciating', 'depth', 'character', 'Anastasia', 'grandma', 'Dowager', 'Empress', 'Marie.The', 'main', 'highlight', 'movie', 'sentimental', 'appeal', 'cleverly', 'mixing', 'elements', 'heart', 'emotion', 'sacrifice', 'depth', 'sure', 'conquer', 'romantic', 'heart', 'repeat', 'are', 'times', 'make', 'forget', 'animated', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'not', 'real', 'one', 're-union', 'scene', 'where', 'Empress', 'Marie', 'Oh', 'Anastasia', 'My', 'Anastasia', 'voiced', 'such', 'depth', 'tears', 'eyes', 'imagine', 'joy', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'whole', 'family', 'revolution', 'who', 'been', 'hurt', 'countless', 'times', 'imposters', 'finally', 'know', 'grandchild', 'still', 'alive', 'Fox', 'DVD', '1.33:1', 'pan', 'scan', 'as', 'well', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'very', 'crisp', 'colorful', 'Dolby', 'digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'good', 'use', 'surround', 'nicely', 'highlighting', 'score', 'special', 'effects', 'special', 'features', 'offer', 'in-depth', 'look', 'making', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'featurette', 'two', 'trailors', 'two', 'sing-alongs', 'puzzle', 'game.An', 'unique', 'masterpiece', 'Anastasia', 'marvelous', 'music', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'two', 'very', 'strong', 'women', 'movie', 'geared', 'more', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Ten-year', 'olds', 'will', 'hardly', 'understand', 'emotional', 'moments', 'occasional', 'verbal', 'clashes', 'two', 'protagonists', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'artistic', 'emotional', 'beauty', 'Anastasia', 'classic', 'be', 'cherished', 'now', 'forever']",Anastasia VHS

I was a little hesistant at first, but indeed this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.  The mix of traditional animation mixed with computer-generated animation is superb and done extremely well.  The acting and voice talents were well cast and the voices truly embody the characters that they play.  However, the best part is the music.  Although there are only a few, they are all done extremely well and are creative, cute, as well a being catchy.  I often have found myself absent-mindedly humming ""Journey to the Past"" or ""Once Upon a December"".  The song that is done over the credits (I believe it is called ""Life is a Road"") is also one of the best theme songs written for a movie, in my opinion.

Starting with Anastasia herself. Who seemed a bit too  self centered for my tastes. Which is pretty common with female characters  in most animated films, but she in particular seems to be driven ONLY by  her own needs. Wanting to know about her past and finding her family is  fine, but it would have been nice if she had be shown to express concern  for, or helping out someone else during the course of the movie.  To this  day I still think the most enduring female character in an animated movie  has to be Mrs. Frisby from The Secret of Nimh. A character motivated not by  finding Prince Charming, but who's strife and hidden courage comes from  trying to save the life of her child. A character you truly feel for. I  really wish more characters could be written like that.It would have  also been better to see more of why Rasputin hated the Romanovs so much,  which BTW makes you wonder, if he was out to obliterate the Romanovs  completely why didn't he go after the Grandmother, wasn't she one too?I  do believe Anastasia is a really good film, if not perfect, and I recommend  seeing it.

Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an ""Anastasia"" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri & Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio.Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features.
