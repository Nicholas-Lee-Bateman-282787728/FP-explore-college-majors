The stories these comedians share are felt by all, not just by the Black culture.  Humor has kept many of us going.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","Today on Twitter I asked Tony Rock, ""If you had to choose between a woman who could make you laugh nonstop and a serious woman who could make your toes curl, which 1?"" He answered quickly. I couldn't answer my own question. I love to laugh. I love funny people. I don't think there are enough genuinely funny people who aren't recycling somebody else's jokes or trying to get by on being negative, so when I see genuinely funny people I want to support them as much as possible. I happened to glance at the preview for this DVD while watching another one. Not sure if the promo slipped under my radar, but I strongly suggest that anyone who likes comedy (especially in the African-American market) should watch this to hear about how we got from the blaxploitation comedy to today's comedy. It's a fascinating journey filled with diversity, from Bill Cosby's mildly cookie cutter comedy (although he WILL check you), Richard Pryor's raw appeal, Eddie Murphy's vulgar comedy, grown folks comedy from folks like Steve Harvey and D.L. Hughley, and folks who are close to our hearts and gone too soon like Robin Harris.Hands down my top five favorite comedians (in this order) are: Bill Cosby, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac, Wanda Sykes and Steve Harvey. And although Bernie Mac and Wanda Sykes weren't featured in this DVD, I was absolutely ecstatic to see individual interviews with the other three. This was in addition to an entire documentary that featured heavy hitters (comedians and well-known personalities) like Bill Bellamy, Sherri Shepherd, Katt Williams, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Robert Townsend, Dick Gregory and Cornel West.It was fun seeing skits from pioneer comedians and watching today's personalities talk about how they were influenced by them. But it wasn't all jokes. They also talked about the controversy of the n-word, whether comedians have a social responsibility to their audience, Bill Cosby's statements about lower class blacks, whether blaxploitation helped or hurt African-Americans, whether comedians are selling out and the hole to fill for female comedians.I loved this film. I highly recommend buying it. I rented it, but it's something I could watch over and over again without complaint, minus Sherri Shepherd's interview which I thought was a bit boring and Katt Williams' interview that made me think he was incredibly high (he just kept on eating those strawberries and grapes). I wish Martin Lawrence and Whoopi Goldberg would've been on the DVD, but even without them, it was still very good quality.",5,Enjoyed watching the journey,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,2559,"['Today', 'Twitter', 'asked', 'Tony', 'Rock', 'had', 'choose', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'nonstop', 'serious', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'toes', 'curl', '1', 'answered', 'quickly', 'could', ""n't"", 'answer', 'own', 'question', 'love', 'laugh', 'love', 'funny', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'enough', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'recycling', 'somebody', 'else', 'jokes', 'trying', 'get', 'being', 'negative', 'when', 'see', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'people', 'want', 'support', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'happened', 'glance', 'preview', 'DVD', 'watching', 'one', 'Not', 'sure', 'promo', 'slipped', 'radar', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'especially', 'African-American', 'market', 'should', 'watch', 'hear', 'how', 'got', 'blaxploitation', 'comedy', 'today', 'comedy', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'filled', 'diversity', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'mildly', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'comedy', 'WILL', 'check', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'raw', 'appeal', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'vulgar', 'comedy', 'grown', 'folks', 'comedy', 'folks', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'close', 'hearts', 'gone', 'too', 'soon', 'Robin', 'Harris.Hands', 'top', 'five', 'favorite', 'comedians', 'order', 'are', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'were', ""n't"", 'featured', 'DVD', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'individual', 'interviews', 'other', 'three', 'was', 'addition', 'entire', 'documentary', 'featured', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'comedians', 'well-known', 'personalities', 'Bill', 'Bellamy', 'Sherri', 'Shepherd', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Shawn', 'Wayans', 'Keenen', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'Dick', 'Gregory', 'Cornel', 'West.It', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'skits', 'pioneer', 'comedians', 'watching', 'today', 'personalities', 'talk', 'how', 'were', 'influenced', 'was', ""n't"", 'jokes', 'also', 'talked', 'controversy', 'n-word', 'comedians', 'have', 'social', 'responsibility', 'audience', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'statements', 'lower', 'class', 'blacks', 'blaxploitation', 'helped', 'hurt', 'African-Americans', 'comedians', 'are', 'selling', 'out', 'hole', 'fill', 'female', 'comedians.I', 'loved', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'rented', 'something', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'complaint', 'Sherri', 'Shepherd', 'interview', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'boring', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'interview', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'incredibly', 'high', 'just', 'kept', 'eating', 'strawberries', 'grapes', 'wish', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'DVD', 'even', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'quality']",N/A
