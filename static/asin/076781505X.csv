Rush always finds the heart of whatever character he is playing and becomes the character. I wasn't impressed with either Claire Danes as Cosette or Uma Thurmon as Fantine. Both worked at acting as the characters but didn't reach outside of their personalities. I saw only Claire and Uma. The actor who played Marius did a creditable job. For me he was Marius because I'd never seen him before or since. Overall the film was well done. If someone had not read the Victor Hugo book (a major undertaking) they would leave the film with a good sense of the storyline. I bought both this Les Mis and the musical because I love to compare movie styles and interpretation. I was 10 years old when I first read a version of Les Miserables.

12325,A1432ACW6PZBH1,076781505X,,"[0, 13]","First, let me admit up front that I have not watched the movie.  I've read reviews repeatedly, none of which have convinced me I need to buy it. I was an English (Academic English, not Teaching program) major in college.  Way back in the 50's, as a Jr. in high school I'd attempted to check out a mere condensed, 1 volume version, of the novel.However, the school librarian had a tizzy fit, saying the novel was reserved for high school seniors.  She grudgingly allowed me to check it out for one week.  I kept it a week and returned it without opening it.  But, my older, liberal sister had long raved about it; so after high school I read the complete, multi-volume version.  I found it difficult to read only in that I thought it was maudlin and wasted far too many pages interrupting the story with descriptive essays, such as a lengthy description of the setting of The Battle of Waterloo. This might have been good in a history work, but didn't belong in (contribute to) a novel. What did it have to do with the main character, plot, theme, denoument, or climax?  I suspected that it was one of those pieces of the whole which the author was so pleased over that he didn't edit it out, even though it didn't further his story line, indeed temporarily derailed it.Generally, I love good musicals, and love stories of noble, heroic characters.  Have always admired those gifted broadway writers who can retain the period, setting, theme, and characters of a wonderful, classic story, while turning it into a marvelous musical.  Such achievements as The Man of La Mancha, Fiddler on the Roof, Camelot, The Sound of Music, come quickly to mind. The songs from such musicals become well deserved classics (timeless) themselves. Perhaps this is equally true of Les Miserables.  As I say, I'm ill-equipped to judge, and shall probably remain so.  Still, the movie was released quite some time ago.

12329,AEPPGGR3KBXZT,076781505X,,"[0, 1]","The most engaging aspects of the film are the scenes focusing on the confrontation between the protaganist Valjean and the antagonist Javert. The opposing characters are played with conviction by Liam Neeson and  Geoffrey Rush. Especially interesting is to see Rush portraying a  vindictive character that is a complete opposite from his Oscar winning  role as the bumbling and loveable Helfgott in Shine. Otherwise, the rest of  the story fails to stir up the emotion and passion that is evoked in Victor  Hugo's novel or the Broadway musical. The daunting task of reducing a 1000  page novel for the screen will inevitably result in sacrificing the  intricacies of characters development and the political setting. That is  the case in this adaptation as much of the supporting characters are  underdeveloped and the political atmosphere is less integral. Furthermore,  the ending felt rushed and anti-climatic. Not the kind of reward I'd  expected after sitting for nearly two and a half hours.The DVD picture  is matted at 2.35:1 and exhibits excellent composition. Besides some minor  shimmering, the picture contains no other artifacts. The color scheme  consists of muted palettes from the surrounding grey structures to the  formal black attires. The atmosphere reinforces the gloominess with  constant overcast skies and drab lighting. Colors are well saturated and  look great on the red and blue uniform of the guards. The interiors are  low-lit by candles that reveal appropriate shadow details and deep blacks.My interest in this film grew after listening to Basil Poledouris'  dramatic score on the CD soundtrack a few months back. There are a handful  of composers that would automatically garner my interest in the movie and  Poledouris is one of them. In a last minute decision, Poledouris was called  in to compose a new score to replace the one already finished by Gabriel  Yared (The English Patient). That decision worked out commendably as  Poledouris' score is powerfully driven and flooded with emotions in an  otherwise straightforward adaptation. On the DVD, the score is the dominant  source of the sounding environment. Yet, I feel that the Dolby Digital  recording sounds restrained comparing to the CD recording which has a  richer fidelity. Other sound effects are limited in spatiality with an  occassional discrete effects from the rear channels. Only toward the  revolution stage in the end does the sound mix becomes more aggressive.  Dialogue is too focused on the center channel and sounds  ADR-produced.Fans of the Broadway musical might find this movie  adaptation to be less than inspiring as a lot of the sentimental subplots  in the play are missing. But then again, if you just can't get enough of  Les Miserables or don't necessarily want to read the entire novel, the  performances and the script are engaging enough to merit a night  rental.",3,Failed to stir the emotion or passion of the novel.,911260800,"11 17, 1998",1998,2887,"['most', 'engaging', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'focusing', 'confrontation', 'protaganist', 'Valjean', 'antagonist', 'Javert', 'opposing', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'conviction', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'Rush', 'portraying', 'vindictive', 'character', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'bumbling', 'loveable', 'Helfgott', 'Shine', 'Otherwise', 'rest', 'story', 'stir', 'up', 'emotion', 'passion', 'evoked', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'daunting', 'task', 'reducing', '1000', 'page', 'novel', 'screen', 'will', 'inevitably', 'result', 'sacrificing', 'intricacies', 'characters', 'development', 'political', 'setting', 'case', 'adaptation', 'much', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'political', 'atmosphere', 'less', 'integral', 'Furthermore', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', 'anti-climatic', 'Not', 'kind', 'reward', ""'d"", 'expected', 'sitting', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'matted', '2.35:1', 'exhibits', 'excellent', 'composition', 'minor', 'shimmering', 'picture', 'other', 'artifacts', 'color', 'scheme', 'muted', 'palettes', 'surrounding', 'grey', 'structures', 'formal', 'black', 'attires', 'atmosphere', 'gloominess', 'constant', 'overcast', 'skies', 'drab', 'lighting', 'Colors', 'are', 'well', 'saturated', 'look', 'great', 'red', 'blue', 'uniform', 'guards', 'interiors', 'are', 'low-lit', 'candles', 'reveal', 'appropriate', 'shadow', 'details', 'deep', 'blacks.My', 'interest', 'film', 'grew', 'listening', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'dramatic', 'score', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'are', 'handful', 'composers', 'would', 'automatically', 'garner', 'interest', 'movie', 'Poledouris', 'one', 'last', 'minute', 'decision', 'Poledouris', 'was', 'called', 'compose', 'new', 'score', 'replace', 'one', 'already', 'finished', 'Gabriel', 'Yared', 'English', 'Patient', 'decision', 'worked', 'out', 'commendably', 'Poledouris', 'score', 'powerfully', 'driven', 'flooded', 'emotions', 'otherwise', 'straightforward', 'adaptation', 'DVD', 'score', 'dominant', 'source', 'sounding', 'environment', 'feel', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'recording', 'sounds', 'restrained', 'comparing', 'CD', 'recording', 'richer', 'fidelity', 'Other', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'limited', 'spatiality', 'occassional', 'discrete', 'effects', 'rear', 'channels', 'Only', 'revolution', 'stage', 'end', 'sound', 'mix', 'becomes', 'more', 'aggressive', 'Dialogue', 'too', 'focused', 'center', 'channel', 'ADR-produced.Fans', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'be', 'less', 'inspiring', 'lot', 'sentimental', 'subplots', 'play', 'are', 'missing', 'then', 'again', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'read', 'entire', 'novel', 'performances', 'script', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough', 'merit', 'night', 'rental']",N/A

I saw this movie one lazy, Sunday afternoon, and was so enthralled that I stayed glued to the TV all day. The movie was stunning, complete with great script, incredibly well-acted and well-developed characters. Some say the thematic elements of love and revenge were downplayed, and not well done, but I beg to differ. I thought Geoffrey Rush's character, Javert, the villain, was marvelous - evil and yet very human. I loved every bit about this movie! Uma Thurman and Claire Danes were suprisingly good, as well, and gave a lot of spark to characters that didn't have much on the page.Ah, the page. Right. Well, of course I had to read the book after watching the film, and so I purchased a handsome hardcover edition at my local bookshop. Even though it's nice having hard-bound volumes of classic literature lying about (and I have quite a bit!), this particular one seems only to gather dust. It's horrible. It's like Victor Hugo is even more confused than the reader is, stumbling back and forth from character to character with no flow and very little interest. His characters are shallow and silly, even the men (it's funny to note how the characters that Thurman and Daines play in the movies are so lively and willfull in the film, since their characters in the book are silly girls that run around giggling and using flowerly language to express their devotion to any and all male characters that seem to be lying about). The author Hugo also doesn't seem to know what he wants his book to be about: a historical look at old Paris? or an adventure story, filled with exciting plot and strong heroes? I still don't know. One minute, the villains are running through the sewers, playing a deadly game of chase... and the next, Hugo has launched into (yet another!) hundred page lecture, this time on the history of the sewers. If you manage to make it through that long, long, loooong chapter, you are so burnt out and confused and disallusioned that the rest of the story holds very little enjoyment. You want to take Hugo by the hand and kindly inform him that nobody really cares about the sewers. And, sadly, nobody really cares about his characters now, either.Bottom line: watch the movie, it's great. Check out the book from your local library if you want, but please don't pull out of the parking lot until your very sure this book is going to be something that appeals to you.

No, and this doesn't do it.  To put a novel on film would seem a very difficult task.  Maybe you can do it with Moliere, Ibsen, O'Neal or Wilde if you adapot their plays, but can you do it with Flaubert, Cervantes, Camus, et al.?  I think not.This is a good movie and as a movie I give it five stars.  No apology.  As an adaptation of the book it ranks maybe three or two.  I think some real benefit could be gained to the world if those who occupy the ultra-moralistic, ultra-fight were encouraged to see this movie--they are never going to read the book.  But perhaps it is too much of a shock to their systems.  They might become moral, see the value of mercy, adopt the Golden Rule, and what would that do to religion in the world?

It is, at times, more faithful to the original story than other versions that I have viewed.  However, though more faithful in many scenes, it just lacks some of the heart found in previous screenplays.  I'm going to give this one away, and purchase the 1978 version starring Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins.  While the '78 is not 100% true to the book, I think it better portrays the character of the original story, especially in the scenes at the bishop's house.  Neither film is true to text here, but Jean Valjean's change of heart - the reason for his conversion - is much  more clear in the 1978 film portrayal.  Another place where, while less accurate, the '78 version is preferred is in the introductory scenes.  The Liam Neeson version is definitely the more true to story, yet the '78 version with Richard Jordan gives more of a sense of why a poor starving man who steals a piece of bread could become hardened to the point of needing to undergo a conversion of heart in the first place.  Finally, the scenes at the end are, once again, 100% true to neither film but the Anthony Perkin's character (in the '78 film version) gives a much more compelling, dramatic conclusion, which leaves one pondering, much more deeply (in my opinion) the difference between the letter of the law and that which is right and just.It seems to me that one of the critical flaws of this version (Liam Neeson) is that you never really develop a bond with his portrayal of Valjean.  There's a coldness (and I think it's in the screenplay rather than in neeson's acting), if you will, that never allows me to really enter into his character.

12343,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,076781505X,,"[1, 3]","This movie certainly isn't great.  But it is solid, entertaining, and worth watching.  I rate it somewhere between a 3 and 4, with the nod going to 4 simply because it puts on display just how great a story Les Miserables really is.Strengths?  Liam Neeson brings an interesting balance of realism and extraordinary decency to the role of Jean Valjean.  It is a subtle enough performance that it brings additional layers of complexity to the character that I was surprised to see.  Valjean has, through years in prison, been redeemed, it appears, from a life and ethos which was not as pure and innocent as the stereotypical view of him might suggest.  You get the sense that it likely was his almost two decades behind bars that brought almost all the way to redemption, coupled with a few acts of unnecessary kindness and mercy that completed his transformation.  Neesons performance was so convincing that I truly came to expect him to dive into the frigid water to save his nemesis in what was disappointingly executed ending.Geoffrey Rush's performance was moving in its own way.  Inspector Javert could easily have been reduced to one dimension--as many other actors have done.  Not so here, although his performance is not so finely nuanced as Neeson's.  Rush brings a satisfying degree of sadism to Javert's character that plays a logical twin to self-righteousness.  Still, I've seen others do a better job with this character.Uma Thurman was terrific, too.  Claire Danes?  I still don't get Clair Danes.

12344,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,076781505X,,"[14, 47]","Oh, Amazon.com, curse your limited review space, because I could write an entire dissertation on why this movie was so bad!  By the way, you folks may remember me as the fourth person who reviewed this movie, before she saw it, just because she was annoyed that people were hyping it up before they had even seen it.  Yeah, I finally saw it.  Be prepared, guys.Okay, I'm going to admit from the get-go that I am most definitely not a ""Phan""; I used to be, but then I came to my senses not more than a year later.  Now, I only hate five musicals and Phantom is at the top.  I think that ALW in general is simply awful, and the Phantom musical makes a mockery of Gaston Leroux's original story.  But when I went to go see the movie, I kept thinking about how great ""Evita"" was as a movie and tried to remain hopeful, despite the horrid things I'd heard (like the soundtrack soundclips.)Phantom got nominated for cinematography, and that I will give it.  You could really see that it tried a lot to be like Moulin Rouge, only more elegant and upper-class.  While at first it was beautiful, and some transitions were simply lovely, though, there are only so many times you can show roses, candles, and snow and have it be meaningful.  Plus the snow was very obviously fake.Story. I'm not going to say the Phantom musical's story.  I was expecting the movie-musical to not be the book, but I most certainly was NOT expecting it to not be the musical either!  The thing that pissed me off the most was the whole added backstory with Madame Giry; that she hid Erik in the opera house when he was a kid and he's been there ever since, slowly going mad.  Um, here's the thing.  Erik's supposed to be this worldly genius.  The torture chamber, the Punjab Lasso, his various talents, they all come from his travels.  And finally, if he didn't help design/build the opera house, how the heck did he get all of those trap doors, not to mention the house on the lake?  Also, I don't like how they made Erik so young.  It doesn't make sense.  Sure, Gerard was sexy and pleasing to watch (I'll elaborate more on that later), and I'm sure Erik looked something like that when he was younger, but there are a lot of questions raised if he is not much older than Christine or Raoul.The Chandelier being moved was dumb; Phantom by Susan Kay did that too and I still don't know why.  Not that the musical had it in the right place either, but I digress.  Other story elements that annoyed me: Meg ""stumbling"" upon Erik's little passageway--because we all know a genius would leave it open for all to see; Raoul falling into the ""torture chamber"" and then Madame Giry getting him out--it was a nice book thing to see, but no one can rescue you from the torture chamber; Erik and Raoul's ""swordfight""--because we all know if you have a magical lasso that is inescapable, you're going to bother with a freaking sword.  Also, some of the song shifting annoyed me.The little ""dolls""!  Why not just give him a chess set and be done with it, in how cliche THAT was!Also, the ""love story"" was handled extremely poorly.  Even more poorly than it should be (the musical does a horrendous job of it too.) All they put between Christine and Erik is sexual, nothing scary yet exciting and nothing tender to show the genuine love he had for her.  For all we know, he's just an obsessed madman.  It was incredibly shallow.Music... like I said, I personally think that ALW shows have about two amazing songs, then the rest is either mediocre or just plain bad.  Phantom movie pointed out the flaws even more, by making it all ""rock opera.""  Phantom is NOT a rock opera, it is horrendously stuffy and ""proper."" It was also at its most notably obvious that ALW's ""operas"" really don't resemble opera at all, unless sung by Piangi and La Carlotta.  I'm supposed to believe that Christine is an opera singer, on par with Carlotta, who can sing the part of Margarita in Faust!Don Juan Triumphant.  This is the worst part of the musical, story-wise.  I hate hate hate hate it.  I can rant about this for hours.  But it just plain did not sound like an opera.  And most of it consisted of prior Phantom melodies.  I'm beginning to think ALW was trying to insinuate that Erik's ""brilliant music"" is like his.  He would do something like that, wouldn't he... however, I DO love Point of No Return, though as an opera song it is laughable, and as compared to what Erik's music should sound like, it is just too inferior.The whole ""not focusing on Erik"" bit.  For the title role, he's really pretty much brushed over story-wise.  The musical does this (they don't even give him a NAME!) but the movie made it even worse.  Perhaps because Butler was just so... not good, he did the opposite of stealing the show--he lost it.What the HELL was up with the random talking!?  They Shattner-ized Phantom!  They turned one of my favorite songs (which is saying a lot, seeing as how much I hate Phantom) into a... poem!  They even had talking during Il Mutto... which is an OPERA!  Operas have NO TALKING!  Arghhhhhh!Now, the best part to judge: the acting/singing.  Singing first. How do I put this nicely... everyone sucked.  While I hate Michael Crawford, I have heard good Phantoms--Anthony Warlow, Gary Mauer, etc--and Butler was... I refuse to call that ""singing.""  Okay, here's the thing.  ""Angel of Music"" implies that you not only can sing, but you sound absolutely divine.  It does not imply that you hiss out words and attempt to sound like a rock n' roll star.  Rossum was pathetic.  Her singing most of the time sounded like a peanut vendor whistle, and her voice was incredibly thin.  She also had lots of technique, but no soul.  I did not believe for one second that her voice was show-stopping, better than La Carlotta's.  Raoul (dunno his name) was decent, at least.  Meg sounded too young and very unprofessional.  Ah heck, all of the singing sounded unprofessional.In short: They should have just dubbed everyone over.  They did for Minnie Driver, and the effect was WONDERFUL.  That's why old movie musicals were so great.. .they didn't hesitate to replace any voices that sucked!Acting... this is the worst offense, even worse than singing, and that is SAD.  Rossum looked stoned throughout the whole show.  She just stood there and looked amazed or confused, or both.  Butler didn't understand the complexity of the character he was playing; of course, in the Phantom musical Erik is hardly a complex character, but a movie could try to do that better.  Driver was the best (and I LOVED the accent), which is really sad when you think about it.  Whoever played Meg... she had the same lines over and over and each time they sounded the same.  Ridiculous.I'm going to throw in a random choreography thing too--the ""backup dancing"" during Point of No Return?  Um, what?  You could tell they were trying to be all ""Tango de Roxanne"" from Moulin Rouge, and it simply did not work.  I always burst out laughing whenever they showed the dancers.  Hahaha.And last, but hardly least, the ending! The musical's ending sucked, but it was meant to end there.  Phantom movie continues afterwards, unnecessarily.  Not only are you mad because you're like ""I should be done watching this terrible thing!"" but then the movie throws this weird thing at you.  It insinuates that Erik visited Christine's grave.  Um, what?  Don't tell me this is an opening for a sequel and they're going to make a movie of The Phantom of Manhatten now!Y'know, that ""What?"" thing was my most common spoken line throughout the movie.  I just kept saying it: ""What?""  That should tell you exactly how little sense this movie made, and some of its ""artistic moments"" were really either insanely corny, overdone, or just plain weird.  The acting is terrible, the singing is terrible.  The story is terrible.During the movie, I kept thinking back to last May when I saw Phantom onstage.  I really found it unsoulful and it did not touch me in the least.  Yet I kept thinking of it pretty longingly during the movie.  Maybe that's the movie's goal... to be SO bad that it makes the performed musical look good.",1,I don't even know where to begin...,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,8136,"['Oh', 'Amazon.com', 'curse',

Liam Neeson makes a great Jean Valjean, and Geoffrey Rush is a thoroughly threatening Inspector Javert.  Claire Danes also depicted Cosette skillfully.I found the resulting story thoroughly believable, and the camerawork unobtrusive and well-handled.The problems in filming a great classic are nearly insurmountable, because so many people are familiar with the book and are prepared to be disappointed. Also the culture being depicted in this case, as someone has pointed out, is foreign to today's viewer. Conditions that we find unspeakable today were the accepted pattern in France, 200 years ago.  Even in the United States, in that period, people underwent conditions and practices that we cannot relate to today.  Many trades in common practice then are nonexistent today, and their very names are unknown--for example, who knows what a &quot;cordwainer&quot; was?  It was a skill in high demand--a worker in cordovan leather.Hugo's main theme was, indeed, the possibility of redemption.  In that time, and even today many people believe, &quot;once a thief, always a thief.&quot;  The fact that it is usually true only makes the story resonate the more strongly.  In those days, the convict's chances of regaining a normal life after his release from prison were slim to non-existent.  Today, they are not much better.I think this story carries Hugo's theme out very well, and the changes in the storyline are insignificant.  I found the movie riveting, and I highly recommend it.

It's not inconceivable that a man who has been brutally imprisoned for 19 years would emerge a hardened and angry man. But it's not the portrayal you get in the book, and it erodes the sympathy you have for him in the movie. Strike a priest? Hit Cossette?!? Not a chance. (And equally unbelievable that Cossette, minutes later, would stroke his cheek in love.) It renders silly the scene in which Valjean refuses to kill Inspector Javert. The man in this movie would leap at the chance!At least you get a good laugh as the scriptwriters try to craft a love story between Valjean and Fantine. She even rallies from her death bed to enjoy an intimate lunch with her benefactor -- rosy cheeks and all! Ha! And don't even get me started on the ending, as Valjean strolls away from Javert's suicide, light-hearted and smiling.

Les Miserables is almost a hobby with me. The musical as I think most people agree is by far the  best representation of the novel.  But this was by far the best of all the  movies.  The filming was fantastic and all of the actors (except Marius who  was awful) were perfect for their parts.  I have noticed that a lot of  people have criticized Claire Danes for her role as Cosette. It wasn't her  fault that the screen writer wrote her part wrong, she made the best of  what she had to work with.  Marius was one of the things that I hated  most about the movie.  Marius was taller than Cosette, he was also supposed  to be handsome, not to mention that this guy was a bad actor, at least in  this part. I have no complaints againts Liam Neeson's performance.  He was  absoulutly perfect for this part and I have not yet seen a Valjean that  compares with him, besides Colm Wilkinson (from the musical). Some people  have complained that Valjean would never hit the bishop, hit Cosette or  smile at Javert's death (though I did not like the end either, it is not  true that he was laughing at Javert's death he was happy to be free) all of  these flaws are again the fault of the writer. Fantine was fabulous only I  would have changed a few of the scenes with her in it.  Also Valjean never  fell in love with her but I thought that was kind of a interesting twist, I  mean you can't wxpect everything to be like the book.

Films work by direct representations of their subjects, albeit in a selective manner; while books work by way of textual signs, leaving more room for imagination to the reader.I watched this movie shortly after it was released on video in 1999 or 2000, and I watched it again recently, realizing that it is a dramatic masterwork that one can return to over and over again. I find the arch-nemesis casting of Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush to be perfect to the core and I possibly couldn't identify these roles with any other actors that could sparkle such on-screen chemistry when placed in similar antithetical casting. Rush's performance is probably even unsurpassed by his similarly bravado performance in Quills (1999).Uma Thurman surprised me with her willingness to discard her damsel-like appearances in previous films to act as Fantine, appearing much like the modern ""heroin chic"" - though very much a role that gave her performance another breakthrough; audiences can surely sympathise with her plight.

12354,AB34G6VKP28L,076781505X,,"[4, 8]","There is  perhaps no novel as gripping or emotionally draining as Victor Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables, the story of redemption, overzealous fundamentalism (justice at all costs) and selfless heroism. Which is probably why it has been translated into numerous languages, and portrayed on Broadway, television, and by Hollywood a dozen times over. Jean Valjean has been brought to the screen by many actors, but perhaps none with quite the charisma and on-screen passion of Liam Neeson, the Oscar-nominated actor from ""Schlinder's List."" With an ideal, stunning cast, a gorgeous soundtrack, and a premise that should touch even the most hardened of hearts, Les Mis&eacute;rables is a triumph.If you worship the book, this adaptation may fall flat... but for this viewer, who had never before seen the story of Jean Valjean (and who now has become a fan of both book and film) this is a masterpiece. The story is spellbinding... Jean Valjean has spent nineteen years at hard labor in a French prison for stealing a loaf of bread. Released but still in bondage by a yellow passport that brands him as a convict, he travels the lonely roads of France seeking for redemption. Turned away by all the inns, he finds a place of safety and solace within the church, and by the hand of a compassionate old Bishop. But Valjean has grown hard and cruel in prison, and he betrays the man by thieving his silver and stealing away in the night. Fate, however, is not upon his side. He is caught and returned to the judgment of the church. But instead of judgment, he receives mercy... and a new lease on life.But the past returns to haunt him in the figure of Inspector Javert, a merciless and overly-zealous member of the Paris prefix. Valjean, who has become the mayor of the small but prosperous town of Vigau, is able for a time to conceal his real identity... but Javert suspects and begins to seek information to use against him. This isn't even traversing into the side plot, the prostitute Fantine and her abused daughter Cosette, who is forced to work as a slave at an inn. To them Valjean will be tied... his fate bound with their own by a simple act of compassion.What unfolds through the two-plus hour epic is a touching story of renewed faith and moral strength in a time of revolution and cruelty. Valjean and Javert are two men of conviction. But in one there is an allowance for human failings; in the other, no exceptions are made. It has romance, suspense, action, a stunning soundtrack, and unforgettable performances. My first viewing left me in utter astonishment, captivated by the story that unfolded before me, managing to touch me so deeply that it has since retained a place of honor in my film case.

Okay, maybe a little less then a few.-It shows a little more of a relationship between Valjean and Fantine. Okay, the romantic part of it was a little over the top, but it showed at least more of a relationship and more buildup before Valjean said he'd take Cosette. In the musical, it feels like Valjean just walks into the hospital and sees Fantine, who asks him to take care of her daughter, and Valjean says, ""Okay, random stranger! I'll take care of your daughter even though I don't know who you are!""-The movie more realistically portrays Fantine. I loved Lea Salonga and Ruthie Henshell as Fantine, but they were a little too pretty for someone who had just cut off their hair, sold some teeth, and was now a prostitute. And besides that, Uma Thurman was a fantastic Fantine.And now for the cons of this movie.-Liam Neeson could have played a good Valjean if they had written the character out correctly. In the musical, Valjean is portrayed as gentle and kind. He cares for people, even if he doesn't know them. In this, he's kind of violent. I don't know how many people he hit, slapped, etc., how many people ended up with a bloody nose because of him, but it wasn't that realistic. He didn't die at the end of the movie, as he should have. And WHY oh WHY did he walk away SMILING after he watched Javert commit SUICIDE? What?? I don't care if I didn't like the person; I would not walk away SMILING after someone just committed suicide in front of me.-Javert is portrayed as so antagonistic it's unbearable. He's not supposed to be the favorite character of the play/book, but he's supposed to have turned hard from a rough life. He is, in a sense, the antagonist to the protagonist Valjean. But in this, he's like a complete villain. He wouldn't hold Cosette hostage just to capture Valjean. I mean, yeah, he's all the law and all the order, but in this he's like an OCD freak: ""Must catch Valjean, must catch Valjean.""-What was up with Marius? I'll get my teenage-girl out of me, but he wasn't even CUTE! How could Cosette be attracted to him? He looked like a hippie! And he was so out of character I can't even tell you. He took over Enjolras's role (thus reducing Enjolras's role in the film to about a minute of screentime.) He was a reluctant participant in the revolution, not the leader.-Where was Eponine? Really? Seeing her for about two minutes when she's playing with Azelma. Wow. Eponine's my favorite character and her story with Marius is tragic. Would it have killed the producers to add in Eponine's character?It's a good movie to watch if you're going to see the musical and you've never read the book. It will give you a basic outline of the story (somewhat unrealistically, but I digress.) The acting is good and the script is okay.

Lees,"[5, 7]","It's obviously not easy to compress for the screen something as complex, vast, and subtle as Hugo's novel, particularly when the focus of the book is internal and a movie is necessarily something that is focused on the external.  Coupled to these difficulties comes the inevitable Hollywood fixation on test market inputs, happy endings, and schlock-horror-thrills violence.  The result is a movie like this, which starts moderately well and then ambles off the rails around the mid-way point.Liam Neeson is an accomplished actor, but you wouldn't necessarily know that from this movie.  His Jean Valjean lacks nuance, perhaps because he's forced into portraying situations that are at times in conflict with the essence of who Valjean is supposed (pace Hugo) to be.  His redemption scene is brief and superficial, and his supposed inner torment during the crucial trial scene (in which he ultimately elects to confess his true identity in order to save the idiot in the dock) resembles nothing so much as a man trying to determine which flavor of ice cream to select from the freezer.  The only bright spot is Uma Thurman's performance, which is both unexpectedly accomplished and deeply moving.  If only Neeson could have produced a performance to match this would have made the movie worth watching.As for the fabricated love-story conclusion which owes nothing to Hugo and everything to Hollywood, the less said about that the better except for the masterful camera work, in which Valjean's spiritual euphoria is brilliantly conveyed by a long tracking shot that gradually opens up from the gray of the quayside to include finally the features of Paris and the open sky.If you enjoyed Hugo's book you'd be much better off seeing the French version with Gerard Depardieu, or better still find the wonderful 1990 interpretation starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, which avoids all the normal pitfalls of bringing a huge book to the screen while capturing the essence and subtlety of Hugo's masterpiece.",3,Striving but not really succeeding,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,1997,"['obviously', 'not', 'easy', 'compress', 'screen', 'something', 'complex', 'vast', 'subtle', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'particularly', 'when', 'focus', 'book', 'internal', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'something', 'focused', 'external', 'Coupled', 'difficulties', 'inevitable', 'Hollywood', 'fixation', 'test', 'market', 'inputs', 'happy', 'endings', 'schlock-horror-thrills', 'violence', 'result', 'movie', 'moderately', 'well', 'then', 'rails', 'mid-way', 'point.Liam', 'Neeson', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'know', 'movie', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'nuance', 'perhaps', 'forced', 'portraying', 'situations', 'are', 'times', 'conflict', 'essence', 'who', 'Valjean', 'supposed', 'pace', 'Hugo', 'be', 'redemption', 'scene', 'brief', 'superficial', 'supposed', 'inner', 'torment', 'crucial', 'trial', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'confess', 'true', 'identity', 'order', 'save', 'idiot', 'dock', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'trying', 'determine', 'flavor', 'ice', 'cream', 'select', 'freezer', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'performance', 'unexpectedly', 'accomplished', 'deeply', 'moving', 'only', 'Neeson', 'could', 'have', 'produced', 'performance', 'match', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.As', 'fabricated', 'love-story', 'conclusion', 'nothing', 'Hugo', 'everything', 'Hollywood', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'masterful', 'camera', 'work', 'Valjean', 'spiritual', 'euphoria', 'brilliantly', 'conveyed', 'long', 'tracking', 'shot', 'gradually', 'up', 'gray', 'quayside', 'include', 'finally', 'features', 'Paris', 'open', 'sky.If', 'enjoyed', 'Hugo', 'book', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'seeing', 'French', 'version', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'better', 'still', 'find', 'wonderful', '1990', 'interpretation', 'starring', 'Jean-Paul', 'Belmondo', 'normal', 'pitfalls', 'bringing', 'huge', 'book', 'screen', 'capturing', 'essence', 'subtlety', 'Hugo', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Therefore, I cannot judge the quality of this film adaptation against the novel, although I do know the basic plot of the novel. (There is some mischaracterization in this production, as there likely will be in any 130 minute film based upon a very long novel.)However, I did find the film adaptation relatively interesting. For the most part, the acting was good. I believe the main element of plot (i.e. the revenge story) was covered adequately.I would personally recommend the French ""Les Miserables"" miniseries staring Gerald Depardieu (who also plays in another French-language miniseries entitled ""Le Compte of Monte Cristo""). Although it is not perfect, it is better than any other adaptation of which I am currently aware. [However, my knowledge of French films based on classic novels is far less than my knowledge of British or American films based on classic novels of British or American literature.]As of December 2009, the French ""Les Miserables"" miniseries is NOT available in the U.S. DVD market (i.e. the Region 1 market).

This is by far the most lucid interpretation of the story that I have seen. Also it's just plain well done in all respects, which can't hurt a bit.Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) was jailed at hard labor for 19 years for stealing food. (Traditionally a loaf of bread, but it may have been two or three loaves.) When he is finally released, he begs a night's lodging from a priest, then steals the priest's silver spoons the next morning. When he is caught, he claims the priest gave him the silver. The gendarmes return him to the priest and he says yes, that's right, I gave them to him, but why did you forget the candlesticks? After the police leave, Valjean and the priest talk about why the priest had protected Valjean, and the priest reminds Valjean that he had said he would become a new man.Fast forward five years, and he has indeed become a new man. He has purchased a mill in a small town, instituted reforms in the management of the mill, and become the mayor of the town. One day, Inspector Jovert (Geoffrey Rush) shows up and it's not long before he recognizes Valjean (who has changed his name, of course) as one of the prisoners he guarded when he spent a year as a prison guard some while back.From this point, the underlying theme of the movie is the deadly game of hide and seek played out by Jovert and Valjean. But there are many, many other plot threads.Fantine (Uma Thurman) worked in Valjean's mill, but was fired when it was discovered that she had an illegitimate child who was being cared for by other people, and she begs for her job because she needs to buy medicine for the child, Cosette. In fact, she is being ripped off by the innkeeper and his wife who are boarding the child, and they are also using the child for slave labor.Anyway, the story of how Valean gets involved in Fantine's life and death, and then Cosette's life, is complicated and needs to be told in its own way. Suffice to say he promises Fantine on her death bed that he will take care of Cosette, and he does.He rescues the child Cosette and takes her with him to Paris, where they have to sneak in because they have no papers. Once again we fast forward until Cosette is a beautiful young lady (Claire Danes) who is understood to be Valjean's daughter.

12376,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,076781505X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[9, 11]","""Les Miserables"", the popular musical and play that has entertained many since its premiere in London back in 1985.But ""Les Miserables"" (which translates to ""The Wretched"" or ""The Poor Ones"") goes back even further.  More than 100 years into the past, when it was first written by Victor Hugo as a French historical fiction novel in 1862.  Considered as one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, the film has been entertaining generation after generation from its first film (""Victor Hugo et les principaux personnages des mis&eacute;rables"") back in 1897 courtesy of the Lumiere Brothers and countless adaptations since.But its first big budget film adaptation was in 1998 courtesy of a film directed by Billie August (""House of the Spirits"", ""Pelle the Conqueror"") and a screenplay by Rafael Yglesias (""Fearless"", ""From Hell"") which was loosely based on Hugo's popular novel.  As the film adaptation was similar to Hugo's novel,  some characters who had a more prominent role in the book were removed entirely or their presence lessened in the film version as the primary focus is on the character of Jean Valjean.In December 2012, a new British film for ""Les Miserables"" was released in theaters, but where this version of the film was a musical, the 1998 film was not.  And now, the 1998 version of the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.VIDEO:""Les Miserables"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Part of me was wondering if this film would look soft and how the clarity would look compared to the original DVD release.  And I was quite pleased with how the film looked overall.  During the outdoor sequences, especially during the parade, the scene looked vibrant and colorful.  Indoor scenes were well-lit, even though the film was trying to capture certain scenes with less lighting, I didn't see any noise during those scenes.  Closeups on the faces of the characters were well-detailed and clarity was much more apparent in the closeups of the scenes vs. its older DVD counterpart. Cinematography by Jorgen Persson (""My Life as a Dog"", ""The House of Spirits"") was beautifully done!Overall, picture quality was very good and I noticed no artifacts, banding or aliasing.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Les Miserables"" is presented in English, French and Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Portuguese Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  The film is not a musical, so dialogue the film is primarily dialogue driven.  Until the film gets to the scenes of the parade and revolt, the surround channels are then utilized for crowd ambiance but also gunfire. A musical score by Basil Poledouris (""Starship Troopers"", ""The Hunt for Red October"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""Robocop"") is also featured throughout the film.  But for the most part, the majority of the film is dialogue driven through the front and center-channels.Subtitles are in English SDH, English, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Les Miserables"" comes with the following special feature:A First Look at Les Miserables - (3:39) A short special feature featuring interviews with the cast of ""Les Miserables"".EXTRAS:""Les Miserables"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:I was very fortunate to be introduced to ""Les Miserables"" back during my high school years.  As a person who took part in theater and one who enjoyed singing, I fell in love with the ""Les Miserables"" soundtrack and of course, the musical itself.But when I heard that ""Les Miserables"" was being adapted into a film, I didn't know how they could do it.  As TV series before (and after) the 1998 film had to be shown as a mini-series because of its number of characters and how big the story is, there was just not much you can do with a 2 hr. film, unless a lot of storyline is cut out of the film.But upon watching the film for the first time, many years ago, the focus on the character of Jean Valjean would make sense.  Eliminating the musical segments, Cosette not playing a major role, until she is older was a major change, not showcasing Eponine or Azelma changes the story a lot and most importantly, by not focusing too much on the love between Marius and Cosette especially the involvement of the Thernardiers towards the end.  The story has changed a lot for the film adaptation.While I know purists who loved the musical or the novel may have cried foul that the story was changed, I felt that to make ""Les Miserables"" to a film without any sequels or to make it last over 3 hours long, to keep things within budget, important decisions of what trim had to be made.  And in order to create a modified storyline of the novel without these characters, major changes had to be made.  And for that, screenwriter Rafael Yglesias was able to successfully write a film that tries to keep the heart and soul of ""Les Miserable"" but also to keep the image of Jean Valjean as not only as a hero but a compassionate man who was able to change his life from an ex-convict to a mayor and as an industrialist who gave people a chance., because even he himself was given a second chance to change his life.Liam Neeson did a wonderful job of playing the former convict, turned good guy and later on, father.  This was a complex character which Neeson played with efficacy.  But with Neeson highlighting his skills, you need an antagonist to match up with him and Geoffrey Rush played the role of Javert amazingly well.  A conceited man, a stubborn man and a driven man, obsessed with catching Valjean, Rush did an amazing job portraying this role.While hardcore ""Les Miserables"" fans may also be ticked that the storyline of Cosette and Marius was changed drastically, writer Rafael Ygleasias was able to show that the two characters love one another, but also to show the relationship between Cosette and her papa Valjean. But the changes made for this film adaptation was to inspire hope but also to bring things full circle with a new storyline that shapes the final half of the film.  But Claire Danes was able to take Cosette's character and showcase a teen who has found love, while Hans Matheson was able to portray the role of a young man, so much in love, but also a man dedicated to the revolution.Sure, it's sad that the revolution, Eponine, the Thernardiers play a smaller or non-existent role in this film adaptation.  But once again, considering the changes that had to be made in order to keep the film to a little over two hours long, major cuts and restructuring of the plot to fit this duration had to be made.As for the Blu-ray release, compared to its previous DVD outlet the film looks better on Blu-ray but the noticeable aspect of the film in HD is its lossless soundtrack and bringing the ambiance of crowds and gunfire to this film, made things much more enjoyable this time around.  I do believe that if you enjoyed this film and own it on DVD, it is worth upgrading to Blu-ray!  Special features only feature the one ""A First Look at Les Miserables"" featurette and that is it.Overall, the 1998 film ""Les Miserables"" may not be the same storyline that people watched in a musical, nor is it exactly what the original Victor Hugo novel had featured with its many characters and longer storyline.  But to create a film adaptation of ""Les Miserable"" for a two hour film, it' s not an easy task.  Yet, filmmaker Billie August and writer Rafael Yglesias were both able to create a film that may be different from the original novel but yet manages to be exciting and compelling.""Les Miserables"", the 1998 film adaptation is recommended!",4,"Exciting and compelling.

As for Cosette and Marius, they are lovely to look at.

12383,AT5SCHXAWHGI6,076781505X,huiwen86,"[13, 14]","I can't judge this movie fairly. I have read the book and watched the musical, both live and on DVD. So, naturally, I will be making subconscious comparisons, even though we all know that movies generally undertake their own artistic direction.For one, although some people have claimed the storyline to be jumpy, I thought it was rather smooth-flowing, possibly because I already know the story beforehand. Although changes were made to the original story, for example, Valjean admitting to Cosette that he is a convict when he only did so before he died in the end, and Cosette remembering that Valjean is not her father when it was originally intended for her to believe that he was her real father, these changes were probably made to accommodate the short play time (2 hours is barely enough to fit in a 1484-pages story).Liam Neeson portrayed Valjean to be exactly the way Hugo would have intended Valjean to be. In the beginning, he was a hard, animalistic beast of a man. But Neeson is able to morph into the gentle Mayor with ease, and that highlights Valjean's transformation. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Javert. Never was there anyone more suited to play the cold, sadistic inspector. Uma Thurman is surprisingly convincing as Fantine. I had begun to stereotype her as the sort of action-thriller-sci-fi flick girl but this proved me wrong. Watch this movie for these three actors alone, for they bring class to your living room.What I didn't like about the movie was the lack of development on the revolution. Hugo was a revolutionary. He wanted Les Mis to ignite the people's spirits. The revolution was a crucial scene, and the death of the revolutionaries a touching one. Through this movie, I can barely recognize which ones are Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Feuilly etc and yet the character names appear on the credit roll in the end.The change of the ending (with Valjean walking free) did not leave much of an impact on me compared with the original ending. I loved the last page of Hugo's novel, where Cosette read Valjean's letter. Valjean had a tragic life. He was one of the Les Miserables, the underdogs, the wretched. For me, they had distorted the true message of Les Mis by changing the ending of the wonderful classic.",3,An enjoyable classic!,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,2241,"['ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'fairly', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'watched', 'musical', 'live', 'DVD', 'So', 'naturally', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'subconscious', 'comparisons', 'even', 'know', 'movies', 'generally', 'undertake', 'own', 'artistic', 'direction.For', 'one', 'people', 'have', 'claimed', 'storyline', 'be', 'jumpy', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'smooth-flowing', 'possibly', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'beforehand', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'original', 'story', 'example', 'Valjean', 'admitting', 'Cosette', 'convict', 'when', 'only', 'did', 'so', 'died', 'end', 'Cosette', 'remembering', 'Valjean', 'not', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'believe', 'was', 'real', 'father', 'changes', 'were', 'probably', 'made', 'accommodate', 'short', 'play', 'time', '2', 'hours', 'barely', 'enough', 'fit', '1484-pages', 'story', 'Neeson', 'portrayed', 'Valjean', 'be', 'exactly', 'way', 'Hugo', 'would', 'have', 'intended', 'Valjean', 'be', 'beginning', 'was', 'hard', 'animalistic', 'beast', 'man', 'Neeson', 'able', 'morph', 'gentle', 'Mayor', 'ease', 'highlights', 'Valjean', 'transformation', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'brilliant', 'Javert', 'Never', 'was', 'anyone', 'more', 'suited', 'play', 'cold', 'sadistic', 'inspector', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'Fantine', 'had', 'begun', 'stereotype', 'sort', 'action-thriller-sci-fi', 'flick', 'girl', 'proved', 'wrong', 'Watch', 'movie', 'three', 'actors', 'alone', 'bring', 'class', 'living', 'room.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'lack', 'development', 'revolution', 'Hugo', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'wanted', 'Les', 'Mis', 'ignite', 'people', 'spirits', 'revolution', 'was', 'crucial', 'scene', 'death', 'revolutionaries', 'touching', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'barely', 'recognize', 'ones', 'are', 'Enjolras', 'Courfeyrac', 'Feuilly', 'etc', 'yet', 'character', 'names', 'appear', 'credit', 'roll', 'end.The', 'change', 'ending', 'Valjean', 'walking', 'free', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'much', 'impact', 'compared', 'original', 'ending', 'loved', 'last', 'page', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'where', 'Cosette', 'read', 'Valjean', 'letter', 'Valjean', 'had', 'tragic', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'underdogs', 'wretched', 'had', 'distorted', 'true', 'message', 'Les', 'Mis', 'changing', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'classic']",N/A

This Bille August rendering  focuses on the man Valjean (Liam Neeson) who has learned forgiveness and to ""pay it forward"", and Inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush) who can only follow the strict and dogmatic path.For the first time, I walked away from this story with THAT thought in mind: some people have learned to not be so stiff,so right,so in line,whereas other people live in consuming self righteousness and inflexibility.Sounds like a good sermon to me!For that reason,I am able to accept this particular ""adaptation"" which I know strays from the book and where characters are exacto-knifed altogether (yes,I am aware that Eponine and Enjolras,and the Thernardiers are pretty well gone!) .Why?

Gray ""kennypop702""","[12, 16]","Let me start of by saying that Les Miserables is a huge book and the thought of trying to get that whole book into a movie is impossible. In order to do such a think the script writter must make some liberties to accomplish the means.The first half of the movie is pretty good, it stays true to the story and the things that are cut are are things that are appropriate to cut out. I thought the story flowed as well as it possibly could and one could easily understand what was going on even if one had not read the book. I thought it was well acted with great performances from the actor/actress who played Javert and Fantine.Let me say some of the liberties and things they cut out of the second half did not sit well with me. First off, the Ternardiers are hardly in this movie. They are there just for Jean Val Jean to pick up Cossette. The Ternardiers play such a huge part of the book to have them almostly completely cut out of the movie, was to me, stupid. The Ternardier daugthers aren't even in the movie which is hard to stomache when Eponine plays such a big part and the sons are not directly connected to the Ternardiers at all. Marious grandfather was also left out of the film as well.The Jean Val Jean in the book would never have beaten up Javert to escape, he would never have slapped Cossette and he would never have walked happily around at the end when Javert killed himself. Jean Val Jean was so non violent that he didn't even shoot at anyone when he was in the barricade.The thing that upset me the most was Marius. Marius to me, in the film was creepy. The way he stocked Cossette in the film and was very aggressive was almost sickening. He pretty much gives her his poem and then invites her outside for a ""booty call"" or a makeout party. I didn't feel any love at all between Marius and Cossette to me it was more lust than anything.Stick with the musical or the book and skip this movie.",2,1st Half Good 2nd half dissaster,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1917,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'huge', 'book', 'thought', 'trying', 'get', 'whole', 'book', 'movie', 'impossible', 'order', 'do', 'think', 'script', 'writter', 'must', 'make', 'liberties', 'accomplish', 'means.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'true', 'story', 'things', 'are', 'cut', 'are', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'appropriate', 'cut', 'out', 'thought', 'story', 'flowed', 'as', 'well', 'possibly', 'could', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'even', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'performances', 'actor/actress', 'who', 'played', 'Javert', 'Fantine.Let', 'say', 'liberties', 'things', 'cut', 'second', 'half', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'First', 'Ternardiers', 'are', 'hardly', 'movie', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'Jean', 'Val', 'Jean', 'pick', 'up', 'Cossette', 'Ternardiers', 'play', 'huge', 'part', 'book', 'have', 'almostly', 'completely', 'cut', 'movie', 'was', 'stupid', 'Ternardier', 'daugthers', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'hard', 'stomache', 'when', 'Eponine', 'big', 'part', 'sons', 'are', 'not', 'directly', 'connected', 'Ternardiers', 'Marious', 'grandfather', 'was', 'also', 'left', 'out', 'film', 'well.The', 'Jean', 'Val', 'Jean', 'book', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'beaten', 'up', 'Javert', 'escape', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'slapped', 'Cossette', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'walked', 'happily', 'around', 'end', 'when', 'Javert', 'killed', 'Jean', 'Val', 'Jean', 'was', 'so', 'non', 'violent', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'shoot', 'anyone', 'when', 'was', 'barricade.The', 'thing', 'upset', 'most', 'was', 'Marius', 'Marius', 'film', 'was', 'creepy', 'way', 'stocked', 'Cossette', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'aggressive', 'was', 'almost', 'sickening', 'pretty', 'much', 'poem', 'then', 'outside', 'booty', 'call', 'makeout', 'party', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'Marius', 'Cossette', 'was', 'more', 'lust', 'anything.Stick', 'musical', 'book', 'skip', 'movie']",N/A

There is a little Fantine in everyone people that have made one mistake and are condemed for life because of it. A little Javert in everyone hell bent on revenge.

12402,AN94YI3URSAII,076781505X,Lostgirl,"[9, 10]","I've been a Les Miserables fan for about as long as I've been a concsious being. I love the musical, the novel and several film versions. However adapting Hugo's epic novel (easily over a thousand pages) which spans several decades into a 2 hour film is a difficult task for anyone. The various made for TV miniseries have the luxury of time to present the story in something resembling it's entirty.Given the challenges I think the creative team did an admirable job. Yes, there are some huge cuts (gone is Enjolras whose function is filled by Marius, gone is Eponine, and the Threnardiers make only brief appearance) but the writers of the screenplay manage to streamline the story fairly well, keeping the focus on the fugitive Jean Valjean's redemption. Imprisoned for almost two decades for stealing a loaf of bread, Valjean leaves prison a hardened criminal who takes refuge one night in the home of the Bishop of Dinge. Valjean repays the Bishop's kindness by stealing his silver. When he is caught and brought before the Bishop, the Bishop tells the police that he'd given the silver to Valjean as a gift. He then tells Valjean to keep what he has stolen and take more besides, but that he must use the money to become an honest man. Valjean decides to start anew. He breaks his parole and we meet him ten years later as the mayor of a town and a small business owner. However when a new police inspector, Javert, arrives in town, Valjean is recognized as who he is and is forced to confront his past. The rest of the story follows Valjean as he attempts to save a dying prostitute (Fantine) and failing that, raise her orphaned daughter (Cosette) while he eludes the grasp of the single minded Javert.  The novel and musical deal with many subpolts however this film narrows it's focus to the central relationship between Valjean an Javert, and the theme of sin and redemption.The acting is by far the film's greatest strength. Liam Neeson portrays Valjean as a good man, but also a flawed man. Many actors fall into the trap of portraying Valjean as a saint- Neeson portrays him as a man struggling with himself and the world, and attempting to let the best of himself dictate his actions. Geoffrey Rush is a perfect foil as Javert, a man who strictly adheres to a moral code. However his rules leave no room for extenuating circumstances, and thus no place for mercy. These conflicting worldviews are the crux of the tension in the film. In a supporting role as Fantine, Uma Thurman is introduced to us as a prostitute desperately trying to support her young daughter who boards with a greedy innkeeper and his wife. We see her sell her hair, her clothes and finally her body to support her child. Her health deteriorates. When we first meet her she is stressed looking, when she finally encounters Valjean she is a wreck of a human being. Looking at her worn expression and the sparkle that appears when she speaks of her daughter the viewer can imagine the beauty she was before the harshness of the world beat her down. Cosette, Fantine's daughter, never really knows the mother who loved her so much. Valjean takes her from the innkeeper and his wife (where we see her being neglected and abused) and raises her as his own. However he never tells her the truth about who her mother was or his own past. As she enters womanhood Cosette knows that there is something her father isn't telling her and is frustrated by his refusal to do so. When she falls in love with a young revolutionary (Marius) she feels the need to hide the relationship from Valjean who she knows would not approve. People criticize Claire Danes for portraying Cosette as ""spoiled"" or ""bratty"" while the character should be sweet and oblivious.I think Danes wisely shows Cosette's love for her adoptive father, her gratefulness to him for all he has given her but is also angry at him for underestimating her intelligence and maturity.The film falters where it deals with the student uprising that preceded the second French revolution. It doesn't have sufficient time to explain the political motivations for events and therefore things feel hastily brushed over. As a character Marius appears to be a cipher.  His actions seem completely unmotivated. The editing of these parts feels forced and hastily pieced together.Still Billie August creates an admirable atmosphere and allows Victor Hugo's most important themes to shine through.",4,An Underrated Adaptation,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,4422,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'fan', 'about', 'as', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'concsious', 'being', 'love', 'musical', 'novel', 'several', 'film', 'versions', 'However', 'adapting', 'Hugo', 'epic', 'novel', 'easily', 'thousand', 'pages', 'several', 'decades', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'difficult', 'task', 'anyone', 'various', 'made', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'have', 'luxury', 'time', 'present', 'story', 'something', 'resembling', 'entirty.Given', 'challenges', 'think', 'creative', 'team', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'Yes', 'are', 'huge', 'cuts', 'gone', 'Enjolras', 'function', 'filled', 'Marius', 'gone', 'Eponine', 'Threnardiers', 'make', 'only', 'brief', 'appearance', 'writers', 'screenplay', 'manage', 'streamline', 'story', 'fairly', 'well', 'keeping', 'focus', 'fugitive', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'redemption', 'Imprisoned', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'Valjean', 'prison', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'who', 'refuge', 'one', 'night', 'home', 'Bishop', 'Dinge', 'Valjean', 'Bishop', 'kindness', 'stealing', 'silver', 'When', 'caught', 'brought', 'Bishop', 'Bishop', 'police', ""'d"", 'given', 'silver', 'Valjean', 'gift', 'then', 'Valjean', 'keep', 'what', 'stolen', 'take', 'more', 'besides', 'must', 'use', 'money', 'become', 'honest', 'man', 'Valjean', 'decides', 'start', 'anew', 'parole', 'meet', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'mayor', 'town', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'However', 'when', 'new', 'police', 'inspector', 'Javert', 'town', 'Valjean', 'recognized', 'who', 'forced', 'confront', 'past', 'rest', 'story', 'Valjean', 'save', 'dying', 'prostitute', 'Fantine', 'failing', 'raise', 'orphaned', 'daughter', 'Cosette', 'grasp', 'single', 'minded', 'Javert', 'novel', 'musical', 'deal', 'many', 'subpolts', 'however', 'film', 'focus', 'central', 'relationship', 'Valjean', 'Javert', 'theme', 'sin', 'redemption.The', 'acting', 'far', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Valjean', 'good', 'man', 'also', 'flawed', 'man', 'Many', 'actors', 'fall', 'trap', 'portraying', 'Valjean', 'saint-', 'Neeson', 'man', 'struggling', 'world', 'attempting', 'let', 'best', 'dictate', 'actions', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Javert', 'man', 'who', 'strictly', 'moral', 'code', 'However', 'rules', 'leave', 'room', 'extenuating', 'circumstances', 'thus', 'place', 'mercy', 'conflicting', 'worldviews', 'are', 'crux', 'tension', 'film', 'supporting', 'role', 'Fantine', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'introduced', 'prostitute', 'desperately', 'trying', 'support', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'greedy', 'innkeeper', 'wife', 'see', 'sell', 'hair', 'clothes', 'finally', 'body', 'support', 'child', 'health', 'deteriorates', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'stressed', 'looking', 'when', 'finally', 'Valjean', 'wreck', 'human', 'being', 'Looking', 'worn', 'expression', 'sparkle', 'when', 'daughter', 'viewer', 'can', 'imagine', 'beauty', 'was', 'harshness', 'world', 'beat', 'down', 'Cosette', 'Fantine', 'daughter', 'never', 'really', 'mother', 'who', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'Valjean', 'innkeeper', 'wife', 'where', 'see', 'being', 'neglected', 'abused', 'own', 'However', 'never', 'truth', 'who', 'mother', 'was', 'own', 'past', 'womanhood', 'Cosette', 'something', 'father', ""n't"", 'telling', 'frustrated', 'refusal', 'do', 'so', 'When', 'love', 'young', 'revolutionary', 'Marius', 'need', 'hide', 'relationship', 'Valjean', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'approve', 'People', 'criticize', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'portraying', 'Cosette', 'spoiled', 'bratty', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'sweet', 'oblivious.I', 'think', 'Danes', 'wisely', 'Cosette', 'love', 'adoptive', 'father', 'gratefulness', 'given', 'also', 'angry', 'underestimating', 'intelligence', 'maturity.The', 'film', 'falters', 'where', 'student', 'uprising', 'preceded', 'second', 'French', 'revolution', ""n't"", 'have', 'sufficient', 'time', 'explain', 'political', 'motivations', 'events', 'therefore', 'things', 'feel', 'hastily', 'brushed', 'over', 'character', 'Marius', 'be', 'cipher', 'actions', 'seem', 'completely', 'unmotivated', 'editing', 'parts', 'feels', 'forced', 'hastily', 'pieced', 'together.Still', 'Billie', 'August', 'admirable', 'atmosphere', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'shine']",N/A

Such thoughts and impulses had been removed from his spirit, and he absolutely adored Cosette.  The bishop, so near to God in the book, was played here with a ecclesiastical and superior manner.  Without looking into the souls of the characters, which this movie did not do, their actions cannot be explained.  Read the unabridged book, then watch the French version with Gerard Depardieu. If you read the book, you will not miss the lack of subtitles.  Another version worth watching is the 1978 version with Anthony Perkins as Javert.

It took him 17 years to write the novel and it's still in print so he would also have a steady income. Overall I think he would have liked all the film versions of ""Les Miserables"" going all the way back to the earliest known silent version released by the Fox Film Co in 1919. There have been many film versions since, both English and French productions. I've always liked this 1998 version starring Liam Neeson(Jean Valjean) and Geoffrey Rush(Inspector Javert) ever since I saw it during it's original release in the theatre. I was hoping that it would someday be released on blu ray and got my wish earliar this week. I can only assume it's because of the new musical version that's hitting the theatres with Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe in the leads. I have both the 1935 and 1952 B&W versions that 20th Century-Fox released a number of years ago and have seen the current Broadway musical twice so I'm very familar with the story. I won't go over it but it's the ultimate story of redemption, faith and love which is something that everyone needs in these troubled times. Those themes are certainly brought out in this beautifully restored blu ray film directed by Bille August. Jorgen Persson's cinematography looks stunning on blu ray(aspect ratio: 2.40.1) and the Paris and Czech Republic locations have never looked better. The audio is superb too. The folks at Sony deserve a lot of credit for making this blu ray pop off the screen. The principle actors(Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes) give some of the best performances of their careers. The scenes between Neeson and Thurman's characters are both touching and heartwrenching. I've always thought that this was Uma Thurman's best performance and seeing it again after all these years only confirms that. Neeson's scenes with the young Clare Danes are equally touching and he more than holds his own whenever he and Rush on screen together. Geoffrey Rush's unsympathetic portrait of Javert will send chills down your spine. This version is 134 mins long and contains the following subtitles: English, English SDH, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish. Audio is: English, French(PAR), Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Portuguese Dolby Surround. There are no special features except the original trailer.

A horrible adaptation that plunges the film into your typical melo-dramatic Hollywood fluff.  A terrible film that shouldn't bear the title of such a great literary masterpiece.The retelling of Jean Valjean's (Liam Neeson) tale as the ex-con whose escape leads to a chance encounter with a benevolent priest who sets him on a new course in life to do good deeds, is horribly mutilated in this watered-down version of the story.  As with the recent 'Count of Monte Cristo' with James Caviezel, so many aspects of the story have been changed that there's little resemblance to the original work as intended by its author.  Instead, we have the vision of poor writers who arrogantly presume to be more adept at writing a story than the most brilliant literary masters.  The result is a screenplay demonstrating no talent or imagination: adding plots and themes that either obscure or completely undermine the author's thematic message.  I will not go into detail as to those changes as previous reviewers have elaborated on that quite well.The title and concept of a great story are here packed with Hollywood fluff to cover up the ineptitude of those who contrived this pathetic screenplay.

Of course things were left out!!If you take the film on its own merit, without making comparisons it can be tremendously moving.  I found the story to be deeply touching--it's not just about an ex-convict trying to make a better life for himself and for others.  But the way he managed to forgive, over and over, as he had been forgiven by the Bishop, is amazing!  I admit that I wanted him to shoot the inspector when he had the chance, in the alley and I groaned when he let him go.  I groaned some more when he let Cossette stay one more evening to meet her beloved, instead of just grabbing her and carrying her to safety.  The power of his forgiveness and intense self-sacrificial love was amazing. And I loved the ending!I found Liam Neeson to be superlative as ValJean.  His strength and tenderness touched me deeply.  Jeffrey Rush as ValJean's nemesis, is very good at embodying rigid legalist righteousness.  These two mirror one another in a perfect way!  Uma Thurman is good as the beautiful, pathetic woman whom ValJean befriends.  I found Claire Daines a little disappointing as Cossette.  Her lapses into an American accent seemed jarring and her behavior seemed at times too ""modern"" and trivial for the story. She seemed more like some girl you'd see shopping at the Mall, than a girl raised in a strict French convent with an adoring ""father.""  I found ""Marius"" less than impressive, too.  This did weaken the last portion of the film that focused on their romance.  It did seem improbable that such a deep love would have formed in such a short time, but I guess that's how it is in times of war...!However the power of the story and the performance of Neeson make up for the flaws.

12423,A281NPSIMI1C2R,076781505X,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[8, 11]","This movie serves its purpose well. You will completely fall in love with the story and want to read the book and see other movie adaptations. The story is so alive and fulfilling, it will not only capture your heart...it will in fact change the way you think.Is revenge sweet? Or, is forgiveness sweeter? What joy is there in the death of an enemy? Is there not more beauty in freeing the soul and making your enemy your friend? In all cases this is not possible, but our actions can speak to the heart.In Les Miserables, Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) gives of himself continually throughout the movie. He is the example of how a life can be changed through kindness. We find him on parole after 20 years of hard labor for stealing bread. Still unchanged by his punishment, he seeks to steal again from those who sought to be kind to him. While the owners of the house sleep, he steals their silverware. The next day he is caught and returned. What happens next will not only surprise you, but will set the mood for the entire movie.This is a story about two men who are given a second chance. Each takes a path and they then meet at the end again. One soul awakens to the chance to start again, the other, prison guard (Geoffrey Rush), is filled with hate and can think of nothing but revenge.Not only is this about forgiveness but it is also about a father's love for his daughter and what he will give up, even though his daughter is adopted. He treats her as if she is his own child. His daughter falls in love with a handsome ""dangerous radical."" ;> Who doesn't seem that dangerous. I really wish the story had been longer and they had put more into the character development of both Cosette (Claire Danes who really brightened up the screen), Marius (who needed a lot more character development) and Fantine (Thurman who spent most of her time looking quite ill).My favorite line: ""I didn't breath while you talked, I was afraid I'd miss a word."" -CosetteThis movie may not be exactly as the story is written, but what movie have you ever seen that captured the complete story? If it makes you fall in love with the characters, then it has succeeded in making you hungry for more. Is that not the point? To get you to read the book? I sure found that to be true.A movie you will want to add to your top 100 collection! I would have loved if this movie had been much more complex. I could have watched this story for 4 or 5 hours! Basil Poledouris' score adds quite an appeal to this story and evokes the right emotions as a great soundtrack should. I also just became a fan of Liam Neeson. His character is almost mercy personified.Truly an inspiration and will change your life.

12430,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,076781505X,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[3, 4]","Victor Hugo's enormous output is unique in French literature... He was described as 'The most powerful mind of the romantic movement' and his novel, published in 1862, continued to be widely read...The plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of Paris... Its author claimed it as a 'religious' work, and indeed by means of its characters, sometimes a little larger than life, yet always vital and engaging, and by its re-creation of the swarming Parisian underworld, the main theme of man's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life...Hugo relives his youth in this vast novel, the culmination of 14 years work... He and Valjean share their most outstanding characteristic: their charitable heart...The story contains glimpses of Hugo's disgust towards 'the treatment of the lower class French citizens by the government: Valjean, an ex-convict recently released from prison, but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself; Fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child...And towards the 'general injustice of the law enforcement system: Valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread; Fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class...The symbol of France's greed that Hugo despises is Thenardier - the man that Fantine entrusts Cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making Cosette his personal slave...The strongest emotions of ""Les Mis&eacute;rables are love and hate...Javert and Valjean are both extremes, with a conscience incredibly strict...Liam Neeson is cast as the gentle Valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation... He changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of Vigau, and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent, giving manual and financial help to the weak, sick and poor...After nine years, Valjean was horrified to discover that Javert - a former guard of the Quarries of Toulon, where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of Vigau's police force...Valjean's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire (indirectly) one of his workers Fantine - turned prostitute... He assumes responsibility for raising her daughter Cosette... He becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness...Geoffrey Rush plays the icy chief inspector Javert, the man who tries ""to live his life without breaking a single rule."" When he is given the job of spying in the barricades and Valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him, things begin to fall apart for him...The action of mercy of Jean Valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence... He is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions... He sees too late the truth...Valjean's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud... He is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in Paris to investigate the mayor, the man he believes is a convict...When he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying Monsieur Le Maire as the 'convict' Jean Valjean, he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed: ""You must punish me"", he says, ""or my life will have been meaningless."" (A key line in the film).Uma Thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of Fantine with admirable restraint, giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film... She gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character's frustration and pain exquisitely...Fantine's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child... Being in a wild state, enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery, she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers, but Valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding Javert's authority...When Valjean helps her, she begins to rediscover hope... Her joy at the thought of having Cosette with her is great... But the shock of Valjean's arrest and the discover that Cosette is not there, are too much for the poor creature...Claire Danes plays the teenage Cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful... She disobeys her father's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing Marius - a charismatic young Parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love...Cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the Thenardier's inn, horribly mistreated and constantly terrified... She grew up in a convent, innocent, pure and a bit nave...Peter Vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered Valjean around...Bille August tries to capture the essence of Hugo's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance, keeping the eternal three elements: the bishop handing over the candlesticks; Fantine's collapse; Marius crying out: ""To the barricades!""History doesn't change, as Voltaire once remarked... But what we need from it, does... Valjean's story is not unique, it's universal... In other world, it's contemporary... There are certainly enough ""Les Mis&eacute;rables"" to go all around the world...",4,An echo of greatness!,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,5430,"['Victor', 'Hugo', 'enormous', 'output', 'unique',

In summery, it does what every great movie should:  it suspended my disbelief.",5,Review the Movie not the book,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,440,"['can', 'understand', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'movie', 'not', 'following', 'book', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'direction', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disapointed', 'buying', 'film', 'like', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Jeffery', 'Rush', 'then', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'great', 'summery', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'should', 'suspended', 'disbelief']",N/A
12436,ABWLP372NGWG8,076781505X,"Vincent M. Maysee ""raider fan""","[1, 1]","I am a consummate fan of the novel ""Les Miserables"" having read it in both its abridged version several times and the unabridged version at least once. This is a story which can be appreciated for not only being a thrilling and deeply emotional one but a philosophical and spiritual one as well.Having read the novel, and having seen several screen and television versions, as well as the staged musical version six times in nearly twenty years, I consider myself qualified to critique this particular version. I enjoyed this film with certain reservations those being the performances of Claire Daines as Cosette and Hans Matheson as Marius. They both appeared to lack the depth of understanding and the emotional investiment to portray a pair of lovers who were literally beyond their years in maturity.On the other hand, Liam Neeson as Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as Javert were superb in portraying both the long suffering hero and the archtypical villian. The key to both these characters is the individual decisions which they both make as they approached the turning points in both their own lives. With Valjean having been shown kindness and compassion from a kindly old bishop, becomes a kind and virtuous soul himself while Javert being born of a criminal and a prostiute in prison is trying to redeem his circumstance at virtually every turn for something that truly wasn't his fault....his birth!Uma Thurman was equal to the task of playing the abandoned but hopeful Fantine whose short, tragic life is made whole upon her death by Valjean's promise to her that he would spend his remaining days caring for her beloved child Cosette.All in all, and I must agree with a previous reviewer, that the ending is rather anti-climactic and should have concluded with a more subtly nuanced one both satisfying and worth remembering. I recommend it highly!",4,a worthy adaptation of a timeless novel,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,1857,"['am', 'consummate', 'fan', 'novel', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'having', 'read', 'abridged', 'version', 'several', 'times', 'unabridged', 'version', 'least', 'once', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'thrilling', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'one', 'philosophical', 'spiritual', 'one', 'well.Having', 'read', 'novel', 'having', 'seen', 'several', 'screen', 'television', 'versions', 'as', 'well', 'staged', 'musical', 'version', 'six', 'times', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'consider', 'qualified', 'critique', 'particular', 'version', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'certain', 'reservations', 'being', 'performances', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'Cosette', 'Hans', 'Matheson', 'Marius', 'appeared', 'lack', 'depth', 'understanding', 'emotional', 'investiment', 'portray', 'pair', 'lovers', 'who', 'were', 'literally', 'years', 'maturity.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Valjean', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Javert', 'were', 'superb', 'portraying', 'long', 'suffering', 'hero', 'archtypical', 'villian', 'key', 'characters', 'individual', 'decisions', 'make', 'approached', 'turning', 'points', 'own', 'lives', 'Valjean', 'having', 'been', 'shown', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'kindly', 'old', 'bishop', 'kind', 'virtuous', 'soul', 'Javert', 'being', 'born', 'criminal', 'prostiute', 'prison', 'trying', 'redeem', 'circumstance', 'virtually', 'turn', 'something', 'truly', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', '.his', 'birth', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'was', 'equal', 'task', 'playing', 'abandoned', 'hopeful', 'Fantine', 'short', 'tragic', 'life', 'made', 'whole', 'death', 'Valjean', 'promise', 'would', 'spend', 'remaining', 'days', 'caring', 'beloved', 'child', 'Cosette.All', 'must', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'ending', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'should', 'have', 'concluded', 'more', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'one', 'satisfying', 'worth', 'remembering', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A
