Jonathan Switcher(McCarthy) has held,but not for long,various jobs. Some of those jobs only lasted a few hours! But that all changed when Jonathan came to a department store and found his main superior,a late 50ish-early 60ish woman,very sweet and loving. He did everything at the store. He was a sales clerk,manager and even a security guard. At the store,in one of the ladies' departments,he discovers a beautiful female mannequin who comes alive. Cattrall,is the mannequin named Emmy. She even becomes the girl of his dreams! Jonathan couldn't be happier. Another security guard(G.W. Bailey) finds Jonathan pretending the mannequin is a real woman and romancing it. To everyone except Jonathan until the final scene,Emmy is an &quot;it&quot;. James Spader plays one of Jonathan's immediate supervisors. Steve Vinovich is the store's president. Jonathan had broken up with his pre-Emmy girlfriend. So the girlfriend and her new boyfriend spy on Jonathan in the store and with a camera. Jonathan and Emmy are riding a motorcycle in one scene in formal apparel,with Jonathan operating the vehicle. Everyone else observes the &quot;it&quot; behind Jonathan on the bike. Jonathan almost lost Emmy to a trash incinerator in operation. The shoes she wore were destroyed by the incinerator. Bailey's and Vinovich's characters were taken into police custody after committing some kind of devious crime. The surveillance camera caught them in the act. It was then when the mannequin &quot;died&quot; and &quot;was reincarnated as&quot; a real woman. In the final scene,we see Jonathan and Emmy tying the knot. The featured song is &quot;Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;,recorded by Starship.

I also recorded it on tape then when I saw it will be shown on tv so that I could watch it again and again but unfortunately lost it years ago because the tape got worn out after watching it too many times. Never saw it again since then. I was mad about the theme song ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" since I first heard it playing at the end of the movie and I still am today each time I hear it. It's very funny how nobody can understand why this new young guy has those great successes of his window dressings.

Somehow, when the mannequin he is designing comes to life -- in the person of Emmy, played by Kim Cattrall -- he is obsessed with his creation. Sparks fly, the two fall in love, and then their world turns into mayhem. Far-fetched? Yes. Entertaining? Sometimes.McCarthy is everyone's favorite smartass -- the things that he says that are cute on-screen would get your average quirky artist's butt kicked three ways from Sunday.

206645,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,6300189821,Erica Anderson,"[8, 9]","""Mannequin"" is one of those movies where critics completely raked it over hot coals because the premise of the film is too silly but was a box office hit. Although an artistic bomb, I loved ""Mannequin"". I saw it in the theatre back in 1987. Still love it to this very day.Andrew McCarthy plays Jonathan Switcher, a starving artist who moves from one job to another aimlessly because he focuses too muchon creating artwork as opposed to simply doing his job. One of his jobs was putting together mannequins for department stores. Before being let go, Jonathan finally creates his masterpiece. A few jobs later he comes across the same mannequin at his latest job working for Claire Prince Timkins(Estelle Getty). The mannequin comes to life as Ema 'Emmy' Hesire (played by a young Kim Cattral). Sparks immediately flies between the two. The only catch is that Jonathan can only see her while everyone else can see her only as a mannequin. The premise is silly but harmless. James Spader played the same smarmy, oily character as he usually does in a lot of his films (which is a good thing) as Mr. Richards, the head of the employment dept. at the store. G.W Bailey as Capt. Felix Maxwell was hilarious with his dogs Rambo I and II but the showstealer here was Meschach Taylor as the flamboyant Hollywood Montrose with his over the top sunglasses. He was hysterical. My favorite moment in the film was when Jonathan took Emmy out on his motorcycle and they pass an elderly couple in a car, not to mention the car chase when Felix and Mr. Richards pursues the pair.

My boyfriend laughs at me for stating it's one of my favorite movies of all time, but heck, what does he know?It's campy, it's corny, it's oh-so-dated, but it's hilariously fun. 'Mannequin' is the story of an Egyptian princess (neat concept played fluffily well by Kim Cattrall) that is cursed to become a Mannequin unless she's in the presence of the person she chooses to reveal herself to. Andrew McCarthy is Jonathan, a down-on-his luck stockboy that's got a chance to make something of himself by helping decorate the storefront windows in a failing department store in NYC. That's where Cattrall's mannequin Emmy steps in, and the two fall in love (come on, you knew they would).The fun thing about this movie is that it's chock full of 80's goodness. I'm not just talking the clothes or the music (though those are great too), I'm talking about the actors as well. Not only do you have 80's king Andrew McCarthy, but we have James Spader playing the slimy manager of a competing store, and GW Bailey (from the Police Academy movies) playing a slightly off-kilter security guard. Meschach Taylor almost steals the entire movie away with his portrayal of Hollywood Henderson, a flamboyant gay man with strange eyeglasses and a penchant to cry at the thought of True Love.It's fun and fluffy overall, but it's entertaining. Those of you that saw it in the 80's will love the walk down memory lane. My only complaint (and why it didn't get 5 stars from me) is that the DVD is rather cheap. Cheap box, and zero extras.

With such stars as Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City), Estell Getty (Golden Girls), James Spader, G.W. Bailey (Police Academy), and Meshach Taylor (Designing Women).It's about a man Jonathan Switcher who isn't having much luck job wise (Who is these days), until he creates his masterpiece Mannequin, and finds her while working at a new job at Prince in Company (A failing store). She comes to life and tells him that she was born many years and centuries ago in Egypt, together they build magnificent store windows that helps Prince in Company get more than back on their feet. However, another rival company is trying to get their business back and by what ever means possible. As well as stealing Emmy (the Mannequin) to get Jonathan to work for them.I think this classic romantic comedy is still a hit today with great colorful characters such as Hollywood, the quirky cop, and the romantic story line between Emmy (Kim Cattrall) and the handsome Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy).Let's not forget the hit song by Starship called ""Nothing's Going to Stop Us."" Everyone today will love this movie. Even though its corney as well as it's storyline Mannequin will be a classic 80's film throughout the years.The DVD is pretty average it has a trailer and a few other related movie trailers.

Comedy, romance, silliness, and a great song performed by Starship; Nothing is going to stop us now.The movie is about Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) who struggles to find a steady job. Everywhere he goes, he can't seem to keep it. When he saves Mrs. Timpkin (Estelle Getty from the Golden Girls) from certain death, she repays him by giving him a job and a department store she owns called Prince and Company. He goes from stock boy to head of window displays thanks to a Mannequin that comes to life only to him and creates a masterful window display. Prince and Company is about to be taken over by Illustra; the more popular department store run by B.J. Wert. B.J. is trying ot buy out Prince and COmpany but Mrs. Timpkin sees a bright light at the end of the tunnel for her store after people begin to notice the window displays.This mannequin played by the very beautiful Kim Cattrall. She is an Egyptian princess who was reincarnated into the Mannequin that just happened to be put together by Jonathan at a former job of his. The trouble is that only Jonathan can see her. She quickly goes back to a mannequin if anyone comes near. Many of the employees begin to wonder about Jonathan's sanity. Hollywood (Mesach Taylor) could care less but it on Jonathan's side as Mr. Richards (a nerdy James Spader in this one) keeps a close eye on him. Mr. Richard's is upset at Jonathan because he might wreck the sale of Prince and Company and loose his opportunity to get a much higher job from B.J. Richards also enlists the help of the goofy night watchman Felix (Lt. Harris from Police Academy) and his dog Rambo. Enter Jonathan's girlfriend Roxy who takes pictures of Jonathan playing with his dummy as B.J will use them to his advantage.All and all this is a really good movie. Throughout the movie there are laughs at every corner, but spread out. When Jonathan goes to Illustra to save Emmy (Catrall), there's a good number of laughs as Felix and his fellow security guards at Illustra (he gets fired from Prince and Company) try to arrest Jonathan but fumble each time. Hollywood gets the last laugh. The ending is capped with: "" and they lived happily forever,"" with a great song to end it: Nothings gonna stop us now by Starship. I wish the music video was inlcuded on the DVD as the DVD is as bare as it can get. It has the widescreen and standard screen format (you know the deal of, this movie was formatted to fit your screen). If you have any worries, I've played it on my LCD and the picture is great.Anyone who loves the 80's movies, music and loves a romantic comedy will not want to miss this one. Kim Cattrall is very beautiful but if you want to see an even younger Kim Cattrall, check out Porky's (another great 80's flick).",5,"""Who are you? She's the dummy!!

But I had never heard of Pygmalion and didn't realize it was a sort of 80s version of it.  Still, it made for a few light hearted moments and silly humor.Andrew McCarthy plays an artist type named Jonathan who can't seem to hold a job because he insists on throwing a creative spin onto everything and can't do it like the boss wants.  He lands a job at a department store, mostly in the hope of pursuing a dummy that he had created on a previous job.  (Weird)  She comes to life, and is actually a floating spirt named Emmy from ancient Egypt who is looking to be reincarnated in a more suitable time for women.  They go through some madcap adventures while it's just the two of them in the store at night (kind of like the future children's book series of Eloise at the Plaza), and they begin to create their own store window designs.  This attracts the attention of the public, and they reboost the store's popularity and revenue.This was a cute idea, no doubt about that, but the movie tries too hard to create madcap adventures with the other cast of characters.  Hollywood the fellow store designer is so over the top gay.  The jealous store executive, the rivals at the other department store, and the semi psychotic security guard make for a few funny moments, but they are inflated and you know their half baked ideas will fail in the end and Jonathan will triumph.

But after taking a look at `Mannequin' for the first time in several years, I think I can make an exception in this instance. Filled with many instances of the aforementioned comedy subgenres, this light and enjoyable romantic comedy-fantasy is a nice change of pace from the heavier action & sci-fi fare I usually watch. And alongside `Xanadu', `Buckaroo Banzai', and `Back to the Future', `Mannequin' really stands out as a notable showcase of the styles & fashion that made the 80s so memorable! Ah, pink spandex and pastel-colored narrow neckties...Especially enjoyable was Meschach Taylor's overwhelmingly over-the-top portrayal of `Hollywood' Montrose, an unabashed and definitely out-of-the-closet stereotype of gaiety. I never thought I'd see the day when Mr. Humphries from the BBC series `Are You Being Served?' would be outdone in the flamboyance department! GW Bailey as the department store security guard brings inept bumbling to new heights, with a little of that `Police Academy' anal-retentive authority-figure clowning thrown in for good measure! And how can I forget the titular star, Kim Cattrall! I don't know about the rest of you guys out there, but I was definitely feelin' the ol' raging hormones whenever she stepped into frame! Ooh yeah!
