The sci-fi premise of this sweet romance movie is that you can have your personal history changed by having your memories erased.In the movie both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey decide to have their memories of their romance erased.  But Carrey changes his mind in the spin sycle and chaos ensues, as he tries to keep their romance or his memories of it alive.The goofy CGI scene erasing just made me nuts.  Maybe once or twice it's effective, but finally it's a nauseating bore and I just stopped giving a darn about the characters or the story at all. Maybe there's till time to get free popcorn refill.To make me not care about Ms. Winslet is some kind of major achievement.I did enjoy the movie up until they went on max CGI.* The title is lifted from Alexander Pope, the renowned 17th Century British poet. Sadly for me, it was the best part of the whole movie.Oh, crud, I just realized it's written by Charlie Kaufman, the man who penned the eminently weird Adaptation. (Invent a twin brother to help you?

It's a little weird with a few quirks thrown in for good measure. It's basically a love story though so if you are into that, then there is a lot here for you to grab onto. Jim Carrey ultimately meets Kate Winslet, who is the most confusing, multifaceted free-spirited woman that Jim's character has never met (until now). They meet on a train and she weirdly introduces herself to him as he acts a bit coy and somewhat defensive. The movie more or less centers around these two's story with side characters getting their small roles sewed in also. I don't wanna spoil anything major for you but the last 15 or so minutes of the movie had me in immense tears for the sheer intensity (this is a love story, after all!).I would recommend anyone who still hasn't seen this wonderful 2004 hit to watch it if you still believe in love!

The maze like, comedic drama exploration of his subconscious. The leading men play different aspects of Kaufman. The honesty in which they go this is slanted by a highly original comic imagination in such a way to be appealing to an audience.In the film Jim Carey joins Nicholas Cage (Adaptation), and John Cusack (Being John Malkovich) in getting to play a new side of Kaufman. Joel is a quiet man who is better at communicating through his drawings, then words. The world he writes about in his notebook fills him with fear and uncertainty.He is suffering the aftermath of a failed 2-year relationship with Clementine (Kate Winslet).  This is Winslet at her most un-Titanic best. She is impulsive in her choice of hair color, and life decisions. Even before the opening credits to the film, they have met, feeling an awkward but intense attraction to each other they can't explain.Joel discovers Clementine has had all of her memories of him erased by Lacuna Inc. He goes there, and after speaking to the mild mannered Dr. Mierzwiak (the great British actor Tom Wilkinson from the Full Monty), arranges to undergo the same procedure.This involves Joel following in his mind a map of his memories of Clementine. He confronts first the bad, but then steadily the better memories of her he has allowed himself to forget. Soon he decides he wants to keep remembering her after all, and begins to fight to retain the memories of her he has left.In the real world, trying to complete the procedure is the very funny trio of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst). Patrick is using his job at Lacuna to help improve his love life. Stan is trying to impress his girlfriend Mary. Dunst here is especially good. Finding the right balance in her role of cuteness, comedy and drama.Throughout the film we jump backwards and forwards in time, with no chronological order to things. It is similar to the Naomi Watts drama 21 Grams, Guy Pearce's revenge film Memento. Like in these, the technique works, but you need to concentrate, to have any idea of what is going on.The message of the film is in its way just as messy, and hard to pin down. Even our most painful memories link up with the good, to altogether make us who we are. But even without them, there are things in us, all which can bring people together.You come away from the film remembering lost relationships, and reminded trust is the most important part of true love.",5,"An Intellignet, Thoughful Romance",1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2711,"['How', 'happy', 'blameless', 'vestal', 'lot', 'world', 'forgetting', 'world', 'forgot.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'pray', 'r', 'accepted', 'wish', ""resign'd.Alexander"", 'Pope', 'Eloisa', 'Abelard', 'Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'created', 'own', 'film', 'genre', 'maze', 'comedic', 'drama', 'exploration', 'subconscious', 'leading', 'men', 'play', 'different', 'aspects', 'Kaufman', 'honesty', 'go', 'slanted', 'highly', 'original', 'comic', 'imagination', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'appealing', 'audience.In', 'film', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Adaptation', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'getting', 'play', 'new', 'side', 'Kaufman', 'Joel', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'better', 'communicating', 'drawings', 'then', 'words', 'world', 'notebook', 'fear', 'uncertainty.He', 'suffering', 'aftermath', 'failed', '2-year', 'relationship', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Winslet', 'most', 'un-Titanic', 'best', 'impulsive', 'choice', 'hair', 'color', 'life', 'decisions', 'Even', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'have', 'met', 'feeling', 'awkward', 'intense', 'attraction', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain.Joel', 'discovers', 'Clementine', 'had', 'memories', 'erased', 'Lacuna', 'Inc', 'there', 'speaking', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Full', 'Monty', 'undergo', 'same', 'procedure.This', 'Joel', 'following', 'mind', 'map', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'first', 'bad', 'then', 'steadily', 'better', 'memories', 'allowed', 'forget', 'Soon', 'keep', 'remembering', 'fight', 'retain', 'memories', 'left.In', 'real', 'world', 'trying', 'complete', 'procedure', 'very', 'funny', 'trio', 'Stan', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Patrick', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mary', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Patrick', 'using', 'job', 'Lacuna', 'help', 'improve', 'love', 'life', 'Stan', 'trying', 'impress', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Dunst', 'here', 'especially', 'good', 'Finding', 'right', 'balance', 'role', 'cuteness', 'comedy', 'film', 'jump', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'time', 'chronological', 'order', 'things', 'similar', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '21', 'Grams', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'revenge', 'film', 'Memento', 'technique', 'need', 'concentrate', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'message', 'film', 'way', 'just', 'messy', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'Even', 'most', 'painful', 'memories', 'link', 'up', 'good', 'altogether', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'bring', 'people', 'together.You', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'remembering', 'lost', 'relationships', 'reminded', 'trust', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'true', 'love']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

619987,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B00005JMJG,alex bushman,"[1, 2]","With Michel Gondry you have a director who is interested in both making art that is visually captivating and smart. He does that continually in this film. I also have to say that because this is true of him he's the most unique director to ever have brought Charlie Kauffman's scripts to life. Since Kauffman was new to the feature film scene and so was Spike Jonze, a lot of people thought that it was Jonze who was the mastermind when he was actually just channeling the ability of Kauffman. Jonze does deserve credit for feeling that his script was important and worth doing though.  Gondry really knows how to work with Kauffman's scripts the best at this point and time.  ""Human Nature"" was good, but not great.  He's learned more this time around.  One thing that I noticed about the film was that he included music which had an vinyll hiss to it and sort of gave the feeling that the actions that were taking place on the screen were relived and dated which is exactly what was happening. Ingenius! I didn't notice the slight of hand visuals until the scene where Jim Carrey is remembering seeing Clementine in Barnes and Noble with Elijah Wood hiding and he walks away while the lights in the B&N turn off and he fluently walks out of the kitchen of his friends house and into their reality. The effects are like that in this movie for the most part.  Certainly there are many clues into what is happening and some of them are obvious such as the people who have no face because the memory has already been zapped.  When a memory is being zapped and the subtle things start to disappear it's because Gondry wants your focus to be on the emotional crisis at hand, but still cogniscent of the danger of the procedure. OK, I MUST STEP OUT OF MY REVIEW TO STATE TO ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM FILMGOERS THAT THIS FILM IS COMPLEX. To exemplify this, let me explain a scene. Jim Carrey's character is having his memories of his girlfriend erased in the comfort of his own home. While this procedure is taking place he is in a semi-sleeping state where he can't revive and stop it, but he visualizes the memories when they come up. He can occasionally hear the voices of the people working on the procedure and his subconscious can change his living of the memory as if he were awake while still being asleep. Multilayered, huh.? Anyway, the thing that I liked most about this film was trying figure out the relevance of the supporting characters in this film after it was finished.  I'm still thinking about it. As for Jim Carrey, he does a tremendous job and my friend who went with me didn't like him at all in any of his previous roles, serious, or funny.  She found a respect for him after watching this film. Kate Winslet was serviceable in a role that really takes a backseat in the scheme of things. When I say servicable it means she was great, it was just a serviceable role, but it was miraculous how she made the role obnoxious, difficult, profane, and yet, believably likable to Joel, the Jim Carrey character.

When Clementine and Joel break up she has him erased from her memories. He learns of this and decides to erase her from his memories and end the hurt.The movie opens with Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) meeting on the beach in February. They hit it off immediately and after a second meeting they decide to sleep at his apartment. Then things seem to get out of kilter because what you've just seen is near the end and the film goes back in time and circles back around to where we came in and moves on to the end. We see them fall in love, become disillustioned and break up. Then Clem decides to erase Joel from her memory. Joel finds out and decides to erase her from his memories but during the process he decides he wants to stop and keep his memory of her so within his mind he begins to try to hide her memory so he can hold on to her. In this process they begin to talk to each other instead of at each other even though this is a memory not the real person. Earlier in the movie he'd said, ""Just because you talk doesn't mean we're communicating.""They learn that each had erased the other and then they have to decide if they want to begin the relationship again. It's an interesting film because of the way it was filmed as the memories are destroyed for the characters and plot. But we are the sum total of our past experiences and the learning we gained from those experiences no matter how painful or happy. If you erase the painful memories when they occur you'd be a different person -- could you grow? Much food for thought here.

This view being despite the fact that its screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was responsible for ""Being John Malkovich"", a wonderfully magic yet funny film that I rate very highly.  ""Spotless Mind"" is a very different film in that it tried to take itself much too seriously.Over the years, it has been my observation that Jim Carrey, the lead in ""Spotless Mind"", is more highly regarded in America than he is elsewhere.  Americans seem to regard him as a genius while non-Americans see him as largely a slapstick actor.  I fall into this latter category.  Carrey's role is not one of humour in this role, yet he still fails to capture the imagination.  His hype precedes him.In brief, the film covers a process whereby one's immediate memory of a particular person or event can be erased.  Carrey's girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, has the procedure down to eradicate Carrey (Joel) from her memory.  In retaliation, Joel does the same for his girlfriend.  In the middle of the process, however, he has second thoughts and tries to reverse or evade the changes.  He desperately tries to cling to his lover.  His memories become precious.  Identity tries to override deceit and revenge.I am very glad that I have now seen this film if only to understand other people's views.

619999,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMJG,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Very rarely does a film come around that is so utterly flawless I have absolutely nothing negative to say in its behalf.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is that movie.  From start to finish, from its script to its cast to its brilliant direction, `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is fantastic, engaging, entertaining and most of all genuinely refreshing, unique and completely original and that is a facet of film that is very rarely attached to a motion picture.  All to often the same concept is revisited time and time again with different actors but the same story is being told, and while the underlining moral behind this film, of the haste in action and the reversal of consequence, I can't say has never been broached I can honestly say it's never been exploited with such sheer brilliance and most likely never will again.The film tells the story of Joel, played by Jim Carrey in his finest performance to date, a man who falls in love with a woman any man would be lucky to find.  Clementine is funny, spunky and sincere, nothing like anyone Joel or maybe even the movie going public has ever met and immediately he is absorbed and content in her light.  Everything is going perfect, going as expected.  They love, they fight, they live and they repeat.  They have a normal, healthy relationship until one day when Clementine doesn't remember Joel.  Joel soon finds that Clementine had a procedure done to erase him from her memory and so in haste he decides to do the same only to realize partway through the process that his best memories are of her.  He struggles to save her, hide her away in the corners of his mind and his fight is so remarkable and heartbreaking to watch.Director Michel Gondry is a masterclass of a director, and here he is so remarkably in tune with his characters and their surroundings that every scene jumps from the screen and into our skin.  Every scene, every prop is a perfect compliment to the actors and dialog and chemistry that just illuminates and oozes forth with utter satisfaction.  The cast is also at the top of their game.  As I mentioned Carrey himself gives us the best performance of his career breathing so much maturity coupled with adult naivety into Joel that he becomes the man we know or perhaps even are.  Winslet though is a revelation as Clementine giving one of if not the best individual performance of the past decade.  Her character is not an easy character to create let alone master yet she effortlessly becomes Clementine and thus we become enthralled in every scene she accompanies.  The mere fact that Kate Winslet is nothing more than `Oscar Nominated' infuriates me to no end, but that is for another discussion.The supporting cast of talented actors is flawless.  Kirsten Dunst is charming and fun and Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as always.  Even Elijah Wood, an actor I've never really felt owned it, surprised me and put in a great performance despite its lack of length.  Plus, any movie with the great Tom Wilkinson is worth its weight in gold, and the subplot involving his infidelitious doctor is a great asset to the film.`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' dissects the most common of problems, human relationships, and does so with such grace and candor that the audience is involved and invested in every second of running time.  It beautifully captures the very real feelings of pain, abandonment and despair and the very childish ways that we as adults so often deal with those feelings and then of course the negative affect they have and our humane struggle to correct the problem before we're forced to live with it.  Charlie Kaufman's script is perfect, not a flaw in sight, and the casting of Winslet and Carrey in the leads was genius.

620000,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JMJG,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 1]","This movie is definitely something new; it was produced by Focus Features, which tends to focus on films that are very anti-Hollywood in the sense that they are definitely not for everyone.  This film, along with Lost in Translation (another Focus movie), appeal to certain people, while others may not understand the content or simply find it boring.  This film also requires the viewer to think, which is a trait that many big studio films severely lack lately.The story centers around Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a quiet introvert who, while constantly making negative observations toward the world, never does anything to better his situation in life.  That is until one day, for no reason at all, he skips out on work and goes to the beach, despite the fact that it's February.  While there, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who is Joel's polar opposite.  She's a free spirit with a bit of a drinking problem, and she and Joel fall in love.  After a messy relationship, Clem decides to have her memories of Joel erased.  Joel finds about this, and, out of a combination of depression and suppressed rage, he decides to have her erased from his memories.  He goes to this clinic run by a Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his unprofessional staff.  While his staffers Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) get drunk, stoned, and naked while working on Joel, he subconsciously decides that he no longer wants to erase her after he is forced to remember all the good memories he made with Clementine.  He then proceeds to ""hide"" his mental Clem in other memories where she doesn't belong, which creates some pretty funny results.For such a difficult concept, writer Charlie Kauffman did a very good job keeping things from getting too confusing.  Not only that, but he was also able to create a great twist to the whole thing.As I said earlier, this movie is not for everyone.  I did like it, but it was bizzare and a little trippy in some places.

If extreme sexual and emotional repression, along with mediocre intelligence is considered romantic, then there is a point.  Perhaps it makes some smile or laugh, since it's supposed to be a comedy, but probably it's laughter through tears -  the story is the most helpless and pathetic, of a totally passive guy, with no energy, no imagination, with brain ability borderline with a mammal, who is being captured by an extravagant girl full of passions and ambitions.  It is nerve-racking to see how she is trying to wake up his lethargic mind, but his grey matter is indeed so spotless and clean, just as Forrest Gump's, who must be a relative of this imbecilic patient.  Perhaps he had a lobotomy before?  Is love and romance really about poor dialogs, with vocabulary of 20 words, of constant grumpiness and quarreling, hopelessly, miserably?  They reunite, but for what - there cannot be any bright future as they cannot create it.

All I can say is that I love how original it is in telling a love story. The characters are well done with both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet making a good impression with them. And some scenes were touching with Jim Carrey's character reliving some beautiful moments that he had forgotten how much they meant to him. While it's not as inventive as ""Being John Malkovich"", or as clever as ""Adaptation"", I think this is still Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay because it has a light charm that wasn't in the others, and plus his characters are more rich in seeming like real people in a crazy situation. There's a lot of good elements to this movie that shouldn't be overlooked. I'm hoping it gets nominated for majors from the Academy Awards(Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, and maybe Editing) because it's a beautiful movie that's hard to get out of your head at the end.

620006,A21U04RIT5AUDJ,B00005JMJG,A Reader with Gratitude and Appreciation,"[10, 17]","The acting of this movie is amazing, especially Jim Carey's acting and his ability to show the range of emotions - hurt, pain, anger, rage, the wrestle betwen forcing the memory out of the mind and the difficulty of letting go.Inspiring is the only word I can explain about this movie.  If you have a scientific mind who loves to rationalize, this movie is complex for you and you will not understand the morale behind the film.  Nothing wrong with you but this movie is not your kind.  But if you are an artist who understands a variety of deep emotions and the pain one goes through in relationships, you will fall in love with the movie.Lesson learned in this movie is that memory cannot be erased because they are too painful.  You cannot try to forget the memories because it is stored in your brain, your soul.  Every time you try to erase your memory, your soul is crying and struggling.  When you try to shut them away, there is always more coming back.  If you think you can erase your painful memories in order to ""gain"" the spotless, perfect mind, you can never achieve it because your mind, your soul is still crying, struggling between storing and forgetting.  It is painful enough to go through a break up.  But why are we doing this to ourselves trying to forget the memories, hoping the pain attached to it is removed?  Why do we put ourselves through so much struggle?  The movie proves a point that no matter how advance science is, we still cannot remove memories and pain out of our mind, our heart.  Instead of using advance medical equipment and the brightest scientists to erase memories, we human beings get engaged into all kinds of self medication methods trying to forget the pain (rebound relationships, exercising, alcohol, work, TV, video games, sex, keeping ourselves ""busy"", getting to involved into others' lives).  The pain seems numbed and erased but it is stored subconsiously somewhere else, waiting for something/someone to trigger it back.Heartbreaks are painful, extremely painful.  Our hearts are fragile but it can be healed. The only way to heal the painful suffering experiences is through grieving.  Honor your pain and honor your memories.  Don't shut it away because memories won't just go away no matter how clever you are.  Pay every one of your emotions full respect and experience it.  Let yourself cry when needed.  Let yourself write and draw when needed.  Don't shut yourself down but be gentle to yourself.  Love yourself and listen to your pain without judgment.  The pain seems forever to heal but it is not true.  One day, eventually one can wake up in the morning realizing the memory are still stored in the mind, but the pain has left leaving a scar.  Scars are like beautiful tatoos on our body to appreciate.  The moment of drawing the tatoo on our body is painful.  But when you have healed from the pain, you will appreciate the piece of art crafted in your emotional body.  That piece of art is attached to you till the day you die.  Just like the learned lessons that will be attached in your mind till the day you die.  People can only grow out of painful experience or running away from the pain.  When you run away, you will find the experience coming back and haunt you.  The pain will be triggered some point in the life time again.  When you grow out of the painful experience, you become empowered and fearless about life.Thank you for reading my review.",5,Amazing...

620010,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B00005JMJG,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[7, 15]","I expected more from ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."" Some great actors are in it, the plot sounds compelling on several levels, and it was written by one of Hollywood's best.It has a wonderful menagerie of intriguing elements: psychological drama, philosophical and ethic layers, complex love stories, greed, honesty, manipulation, and questions of destiny, reality and time. What doesn't it work? What happened?The idea of this film was bigger than those who put it together.The IdeaAdventurous girl (Clementine) meets shy boy (Joel). They fall into a sweeping romance, as the Yin finds the Yang.Somehow, for reasons only vaguely alluded to, it all breaks down. Clementine does something stupid and Joel suspects the worst.They break up, and Clementine decides to go to a special service to have her memory of him erased. He finds out after the fact, and decides he should do the same.In the process of having this done, he subconsciously remembers each event chronologically reversed. It isn't a tape played backwards. He just remembers what happened a month early, then the day before, until he gets to that first memory. However, as he goes through the messy breakup, and back into the good times, he realizes he loves her.Joel struggles the entire time asleep, as he has a sense of what is happening and desperately wants to save the relationship. Clementine too, although in Joel's mind, wants the relationship and understands the issue of his memory being erased. She does not see the same urgency, frustrating Joel.The ultimate conflict becomes saving the relationship. Can Joel find a solution, will he be able to in time even though various hurdles are before him, and what would the relationship look like when he wakes up?I had a difficult time following which reality, and what time and place things were happening. During the time inside Joel's memory, I became lost, and did not know what I was seeing. We see Joel as a child, as a man-child, at different events of his relationship with Clementine, and events would be different from the one I though was reality. On paper, this whole process is interesting, but, on screen, I had a hard time keeping up.Secondary plot lines are loose, at best, and could be removed without affecting the strength of the movie. Their presence, in fact, adds to the confusion, as I did not understand why certain characters were acting the way they did.For example, Stan, the technician overseeing Joel's memory erasure brings along his assistant Patrick, and they both pillage Joel's home for snacks and drinks while Joel is there asleep mid-procedure. Mary, Stan's girlfriend and receptionist at the clinic, comes by she and Stand smoke some pot. A lack of class and ethics I understand, but how this happens is the confusing part. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the brilliant, though staid, doctor who invented the procedure tolerates it all when he comes by to help out. He must have smelled the pot, and otherwise saw the pandemonium that had ensued. He himself seems largely professional, and yet never comments on their actions.The movie has good points.Kate Winslet demonstrates an amazing American accent. I forgot she was British. Her skills here were underused. The producers could have saved money with a more stereotypical actress like Drew Barrymore. Barrymore has played similar characters before.Jim Carrey shows us he has more chops than just as an incredible comedic physical actor. His dramatic personality here was key to my interest in the movie.Elijah Wood (he played Patrick), most known for his part as Frodo Baggins in LOTR, keeps stretching himself. His part was inconsequential to the plot, and a secondary plot about his efforts to woo Clementine was not seriously developed.""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" is a well-reviewed movie, and is worth seeing. The question of memories and how we should manage a broken heart is good to ponder, and the movie will help you get there. Its unorthodox approach might not bog down other viewers as is did for me, so give it a shot.

It's like peeling an onion- as each layer of skin comes off, it reveals yet another layer...and so forth.There is so much more than meets the eye each time around.The story is centered on a couple ( Jim Carey and Kate Winslet)who after 2 years together,have a nasty arguement, and Winslet goes to a company that specializes in erasing unpleasant memories, and has Carey erased totally from her memory.After He realizes what she has done, he is too hurt to go on without her, and he in turn has her erased.During HIS procedure is where most of the movie takes place-In Carey's unconcious mind. The deeper they probe into his memories to erase her, the more he realizes he really loves her and don't want her erased.Unconscious though, he is unable to stop them, so begins a dillema in his mind to HIDE her in other PARTS of his memory, And THAT is where the story gets SO original !!! As we see them mapping his brain on a scanner, we see the couple running crazily from them through his memories- LITERALLY!We are also treated to other characters stories : Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood (The staff at the Company that does the erasing)and thier characters add a lot of flavour to the movie, too.I seen another reviewer say that they kept track of time by her hair color (which changes from one bizarre color to the next)and that is also how I kept track.Because it skips in time- a LOT, but in a good way.I just absolutely LOVE this movie, and LOVED seeing Jim Carey in such a serious role  He is so awesome in this!The only reason I only gave it 4 stars, Is that,thoughit was directed good, I think the directing could have been better.I think we should have got to know them as a COUPLE a little better BEFORE the break up, Not DURING the erasing procedure. The first time I seen it, I didn't really sympathize with Carey while he was Grieving toward the beginning of the movie- I think SOME of thier closeness should have been revealed earlier on.Over all though, This film is PURE entertainment! - GENIOUS !!I will watch this movie over and over for years to come , and always reccomend it to others.",4,DEEP-  I Appreciate it more with each viewing !!!!,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2185,"['true', 'more', 'times', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'discover', 'peeling', 'onion-', 'layer', 'skin', 'off', 'yet', 'layer', 'so', 'forth.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'time', 'around.The', 'story', 'centered', 'couple', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', '2', 'years', 'together', 'have', 'nasty', 'arguement', 'Winslet', 'company', 'erasing', 'unpleasant', 'memories', 'Carey', 'erased', 'totally', 'memory.After', 'what', 'done', 'too', 'hurt', 'go', 'turn', 'erased.During', 'HIS', 'procedure', 'where', 'most', 'movie', 'place-In', 'Carey', 'unconcious', 'mind', 'deeper', 'probe', 'memories', 'erase', 'more', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'erased.Unconscious', 'though', 'unable', 'stop', 'so', 'dillema', 'mind', 'HIDE', 'other', 'PARTS', 'memory', 'THAT', 'where', 'story', 'SO', 'original', 'see', 'mapping', 'brain', 'scanner', 'see', 'couple', 'running', 'crazily', 'memories-', 'LITERALLY', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'other', 'characters', 'stories', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'staff', 'Company', 'erasing', 'thier', 'characters', 'add', 'lot', 'flavour', 'movie', 'too.I', 'seen', 'reviewer', 'say', 'kept', 'track', 'time', 'hair', 'color', 'one', 'bizarre', 'color', 'next', 'also', 'how', 'kept', 'time-', 'LOT', 'good', 'way.I', 'just', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'LOVED', 'seeing', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'such', 'serious', 'role', 'so', 'awesome', 'only', 'reason', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'directed', 'good', 'think', 'directing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.I', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'know', 'COUPLE', 'little', 'better', 'break', 'up', 'Not', 'erasing', 'procedure', 'first', 'time', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sympathize', 'Carey', 'was', 'Grieving', 'beginning', 'movie-', 'think', 'SOME', 'thier', 'closeness', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'earlier', 'though', 'film', 'PURE', 'entertainment', 'GENIOUS', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'years', 'come', 'always', 'reccomend', 'others']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Coming from the mind of Charlie Kaufman, this film is luckily more in the vein of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and ADAPTATION than HUMAN NATURE.The film, which operates on the premise that people can delete bad relationships from their memories, travels essentially backward down its story's timeline. It examines several key themes regarding compatibility, fate and how our memories can make up who we are.Jim Carrey, who plays his role of Joel straight rather than wacky, delivers his best and most human performance since THE TRUMAN SHOW. But the movie, thankfully, belongs to Kate Winslet. As Clementine, the girlfriend who Joel wants to either love or forget, Winslet is wacky, colorful and hilarious - the sort of girl you want to either love or strangle.While their central story plays out mostly within Joel's brain, several equally interesting subplots emerge involving the memory-erasing workers played by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.The thing I like best about Charlie Kaufman scripts is that I don't always know where they're going but, in the end, they cover all their bases, address all the philosophical questions inherent in their twisted plots and always leave me entertained.

There are elements of comedy and science fiction, yes, but at heart, it's simply a perfectly captured, bittersweet love story--one that, if you're single, makes you long for such a relationship, even as you watch it disintegrate.It should be pointed out that the movie--a close second to ""Lost in Translation"" among the best films in recent memory--is by no means just a Charlie Kaufman vehicle. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play against type perfectly, truly inhabiting the characters of Joel and Clementine. Michel Gondry deftly brings his and Kaufman's story to the screen, putting his music-video background to good use while taking care not to overwhelm things with too much fancy footwork. And Jon Brion's score brilliantly accentuates the scenes without threatening to overshadow them.There are some simply lovely shots in this movie, among them Joel and Clem on the frozen Charles River; a little girl in a cowgirl outfit leading young Joel away from a group of taunting boys; and Joel and Clem on the snow-covered beach at Montauk. One memorable shot that the filmmakers simply stumbled upon was the elephant parade over which Kirsten Dunst reads the lines of Alexander Pope's ""Eloisa to Abelard"" which give the movie its title.

They're complete opposites - Joel quiet and melancholy, Clem a wild woman - but they fall for each other pretty fast.  Then one day Joel visits her at work and not only does she seem not to remember who he is, but she is involved with someone else whom Joel can't quite identify.  He later discovers that she has undergone a process to have him erased from her memory, and he decides to do the same.  But partway through he decides he doesn't want to lose his memories of her after all, so he attempts to bury them off the ""map"" where the erasure technicians can't find them.A good portion of the film is spent following the two through Joel's memories, deeper and deeper as they try to escape deletion.  These surreal sequences go on too long and cause the film to drag at times (the childhood memories are particularly grating.)  But the movie's biggest flaw is a lack of substance.  Despite getting a direct look at some of Joel's defining moments, we never get a sense of him as a person.  Clementine is a complete enigma, and I couldn't figure out what the two of them saw in each other at all.  In the end, all we're left with is ""boring"" Joel and ""wacky"" Clementine.  There is a slight plot complication involving the hospital staff towards the end, but there isn't much to the story as a whole.  Overall, it's an interesting concept but one that mildly fails as a movie.I didn't like the film enough to do much exploring of the special features, but I did see the rather lame music video (composed entirely of film clips with singing mouths superimposed over the characters) and a cheap-looking commercial for Lacuna, the company in the film.",3,"Ambitious, but falls short",1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1743,"['Joel', 'Clementine', 'meet', 'train', 'Joel', 'impulse', 'skip', 'work', 'day', ""'re"", 'complete', 'opposites', 'Joel', 'quiet', 'melancholy', 'Clem', 'wild', 'woman', 'fall', 'other', 'pretty', 'fast', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Joel', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'seem', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'involved', 'someone', 'else', 'whom', 'Joel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'identify', 'later', 'undergone', 'process', 'have', 'erased', 'memory', 'do', 'same', 'partway', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'memories', 'bury', 'off', 'map', 'where', 'erasure', 'technicians', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'them.A', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'spent', 'following', 'two', 'Joel', 'memories', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'try', 'escape', 'deletion', 'surreal', 'sequences', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'cause', 'film', 'drag', 'times', 'childhood', 'memories', 'are', 'particularly', 'grating', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'lack', 'substance', 'getting', 'direct', 'look', 'Joel', 'defining', 'moments', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'person', 'Clementine', 'complete', 'enigma', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'two', 'saw', 'other', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'boring', 'Joel', 'wacky', 'Clementine', 'slight', 'plot', 'complication', 'involving', 'hospital', 'staff', 'end', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'whole', 'Overall', 'interesting', 'concept', 'one', 'mildly', 'movie.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'enough', 'do', 'much', 'exploring', 'special', 'features', 'did', 'see', 'rather', 'lame', 'music', 'video', 'composed', 'entirely', 'film', 'clips', 'singing', 'mouths', 'superimposed', 'characters', 'cheap-looking', 'commercial', 'Lacuna', 'company', 'film']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620033,A2N9OENVXDF643,B00005JMJG,Brian M. Benway,"[14, 16]","With quirky films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has identified himself as a modern-day genius, bending reality to a point where fiction truly is stranger than truth.  His latest project, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a much more tender and introspective film, exploring the concepts of memory and lost love.Jim Carrey, in his best role yet, plays Joel Barish, a quiet, unassuming man who falls in--and out--of love with the quirky Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-energy, moody girl that couldn't be more his polar opposite.  Following their breakup, Clementine elects to have her memories of him selectively erased from her mind at a place that specializes in memory erasure.Not to be outdone, Joel decides to level the playing field.  What follows is a sometimes confusing and often disorienting exploration of Joel's memories of Clementine.  Much like our own memory, the details are subject to change, and follow no chronological order.  The good times, however scarce, seem to outweigh the bad.  And sometimes the desires of the present don't seem to equate with the dreams of the past.To say more about the plot would be difficult... and improper.  Suffice it to say that this movie works because Joel's walk down memory lane is a familiar stroll for us all.  Stylistically, the film is an assault on the senses, with constant and sometimes subtle visual effects enhancing the alternate reality of events remembered.  The film is funny at times, but more often, it is achingly tender, and other times pathetically desperate.  There is a brilliant subtext of emotion woven into the story, the cinematography, and the performances.With lesser actors at the helm, Eternal Sunshine could have quickly degraded into a simple film experiment, but Carrey and Winslet truly elevate this movie beyond its impeccable style, creating honest characters that ground the film.  As we look in on their first meeting, as well as their last, it's easy to forget we're just watching two actors.Eternal Sunshine was pegged by the powers that be as a romantic comedy, probably to make it more palatable to the moviegoing public.  This is doing the film a disservice.  Anyone expecting a mindless and lighthearted diversion, complete with the predictable happy ending, will likely be a little put off by this film.Eternal Sunshine cannot really be described in conventional terms, which is a great deal of the magic of Charlie Kaufman films.  It is tender, evocative, and ultimately profoundly moving.

She knows about a doctor who has the ability to remove selective memory and she undergoes the procedure without telling her former lover. When he discovers what she did, he decides to do the same thing himself and relives the moments they shared together. He then wants to stop the procedure, but it may be too late.This movie has received much critical acclaim and for good reason. It is one of the more original movies I have watched in a long time and it is completely unpredictable. It keeps you guessing and guessing, all the way to the end. Some parts don't even make sense at first, but everything comes together when the movie concludes. It's a thinking type of movie. It makes you think about your own relationships and how important they are to you. Even though disagreements will occur, we often don't realize what we have until it's gone, which is what this movie illustrates.With this type of basis for a plot, this movie is one of the more unusual I have seen in a long time. The sequences in this movie are not always chronological and they require your complete attention. Some viewers might even need a second viewing to fully understand what is taking place. The film is surreal, with many of the action taking place while Jim Carrey is in a state of half- consciousness. He is fully aware, in his head, of what is happening and he wants to bring it all to an end once he realizes how much he loves his mate. But in order to stop the procedure, he has to wake up and this isn't likely to happen with this type pf procedure.Many veterans of movie watching will appreciate this film for its originality and for its fine performances. Others will feel it makes no sense and dislike it completely. I fit into the former category.

Jim Carrey plays  plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays  extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as ""very nice"". Joel must be searching for something other than ""very nice"" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service. When Joel discovers what she has done he is so hurt that he wants the same thing done to him so that he can erase the pain. The process takes an entire night, and during this process Joel relives all of the moments he and Clementine had together and realizes that Clementine brought enough happiness into his life that he doesn't want her erased from his mind after all. However, he is now unconscious and unable to communicate his wishes to those handling the procedure. Thus, he tells Clementine - inside his mind - what is going on and they attempt to hide from the ""mind erasers"" in places in his memories where he would have never taken her. Specifically, he takes her to particularly humiliating points in his childhood and adolescence. It seems telling that the pair have been together for two years yet Joel has apparently never told Clementine about any of these memories, apparently having shut her out of selective portions of his life. However, these evasion tactics are no match for the mind-erasing team of Lacuna Inc., and ultimately Clementine is cleansed from Joel's mind. Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them. The next day he awakes, is drawn to this prearranged meeting place for reasons he doesn't understand, and she is there. Neither one of them knows who the other is, but the relationship is beginning to start all over again when a disgruntled Lacuna employee gives them their files, which include tapes of what both Joel and Clementine thought of one another at the the time each requested to have the other erased. They listen to each others tapes and are both shocked and embarrassed. These are not flattering revelations, to say the least. In spite of the fact that they know their relationship will likely end up right where it did before, they decide to give it another try, because the alternative is to lose one another and the possibility of love and companionship.The plot may be hard to follow as it bends back and forth through time, but it is worth it, and Jim Carrey gives the best performance he has given since ""The Truman Show"". The movie has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconsciable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves. You'll find yourself catching something you missed before each time you watch it.

620039,A2YVV3TCN3SUMR,B00005JMJG,Cate,"[0, 0]","I saw the beautiful ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" about 2 weeks ago, but have refrained from writing a review until I thought I knew just what to say about it.I'm sure you know the plot by now. Joel (played perfectly by Jim Carrey) finds out that his wild ex-girlfriend of 2 years (Another perfect performance by Kate Winslet) has had all her memories of him erased. Hurt and confused, he goes to the same clinic she did to get the procedure done himself. The rest of the movie now swiches back and forth from inside Joel's mind with all memories of Clementine slowly being broken apart (literally) and the sub-stories about the three young erasers actually performing the procedure while Joel sleeps. About halfway through the process, Joel realizes upon reliving the memories with Clementine, that he truly does love her. But when he wakes up he won't remember her. So he tries to hide her in other parts of his mind before it's too late.This is a very humble film. It knows it's brilliant, but never boasts. It just thrives in it's own genuine originality from beginning to end, unlike some films that seem to shout every 5 minutes, ""Isn't this COOL? Look how wacky we are! This is smart! SMART!""I wasn't sure exactly how they would show Joel's memories being erased and how Clementine would act in them, but it's actually very simple. Since it is in Joel's head, it's not REALLY Clementine he's talking to. The memories are real enough, but the Clementine he interacts with, the one he desperately tries to hide away from the erasers once he realizes he's made a mistake, is just an idea of her. Since this is true, all he has to say is, ""Look, I need to hide you from them"" and she goes along with it without asking any questions. It's almost dreamlike.This is definately the sweetest movie I've seen in a long time. It's also funny, real, romantic, and very smart.

620042,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005JMJG,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","In every script that Charlie Kaufman writes there always seems to be a very twisted mind game as the premise; and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exception. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) have just gone through a messy break up. Clementine, being rather impulsive (to say the least), undergoes a pseudo medical treatment to erase all memories of Joel Barish, so she can get on with her life. Joel discovers what she has done and opts for the same treatment. Somehow, in sifting through their memories, they rediscover what made them fall in love in the first place. Herein lays the twisted mind game that Kaufman is so fond of. Joel and Clementine must battle the memory erasers to hold onto each other, and the battle royale is all taking place inside Joel's head.Kaufman is aided and abetted here by director Michel Gondry -- a visual genius. He realizes Kaufman's vision with a variety of special effects, like forced perspective and stop action. Nothing computer generated here, it is all done with clever manipulation of the camera. Michel has really brought Charlie's nutso ideas to life, and no matter how far fetched, it all has the gritty look and feel of reality.In a role reversal, you could say that Kate Winslet is playing the Jim Carrey part, while Jim is rather reserved and understated -- the usual sort of Winslet role. Joel, always with three days of stubble on his face, pours his feelings into a diary and whimsical sketches rather than blabbing them out loud. Joel Barish is a projection of Charlie Kaufman, and I can really see him in Jim Carrey's introverted character creation. Who issued the restraining order?There is also a lot of underground cartoonist Robert Crumb in Barish, and some of the scenes where Joel is reliving his childhood could have been lifted directly from Crumb's comic book memoirs. Joel is reading an R. Crumb comic in one scene.-------------Clementine: What are you, NUTS?Joel: It's been suggested.=====================But Joel keeps all his craziness locked inside, whereas Clementine spills it out for all to see. She dyes her hair crazy colors, like Blue Ruin or Agent Orange, and it all matches her clothes -- and the drinks she mixes. She is high maintenance to the max, and she tells him so in no uncertain terms. Soon after meeting she has Joel breaking and entering.---------Clementine: Look, I'm sorry if I came off a little nutso, I'm not really.Joel: That's okay; I really didn't think you were.===================Joel is always very polite and nice, and nice is something that Clementine hates -- or at least she thinks she does, until Joel starts to grow on her. Clementine pushes Joel to experience life to the fullest, to get out of his shell. Clementine has Joel out on thin ice -- figuratively and literally. They are laying together out on the frozen River Charles, a central metaphor of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.------------------------------------Joel: I could die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.=============================================Carrey and Winslet make a great team, with Carrey letting Winslet carry the film, while Jim is the anchor. Kate Winslet is spectacular here. I enjoyed her here much more than watching her go down on the Titanic.Also contributing to the success of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as Stan and Patrick, the technicians who perform the memory erasing procedure; Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the inventor of the technique; and Kirsten Dunst as Mary the receptionist. Stan and Patrick are The Two Stooges of pseudo medical procedures, and Dr. Howard has a suitably reassuring bedside manner -- but you wonder just whose bedside he's been at. ""Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard. Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.""--------------------Joel: Is there any risk of brain damage?Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Well, technically speaking, the operation is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.================================Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also on a par with a night of heavy drinking -- just as much fun but without the hangover, regrets, or DUIs. Though the plot is convoluted, the viewer should have no problem following it. The visual story telling style of director Michel Gondry really pulls you in. Repeated viewings will no doubt reward with additional revelations. Kate Winslet, Jim Carrey, and the rest of the cast really give it their all. It is a very funny film that also has a lot to say about the nature of love, memory, and how much we need each other, even if we are all a little crazy.--------------------------------------Clementine: You know me, I'm impulsive.Joel: That's what I love about you.==================================================Synecdoche New York(2008) (written by Charlie Kaufman)The Reader(2008) ....

Kaufman writes what could be argued as his best screenplay and the end result is another great movie.I'm sure you know the story is about a man named Joel (Carrey) who breaks up with his girlfriend, Clemintine (Winslet, who gives a hell of a performance), and finds out the she got all of her memories of their relationship erased.  So Joel decides to also get his memories erased of their relationship.  While doctors are erasing his memories, Joel decides that he rather have bad and good memories of Clemintine than none at all, so he tries to avoid get the memories erased by hiding in other memories in his mind and taking Clemintine with him.Confused?

620052,A3BOUPGDLG7QPP,B00005JMJG,"Christian Hunter ""Christian Hunter""","[8, 13]","""Let's see a movie together""...It had become a wholesome mantra against the backdrop of hedonism and debauchery in which I've come to know, and from time to time (over a span of two years) ""see"" a certain girl in town.Tonight, at the Paseo Theatre downtown we met for that long promised movie.  She recommended we see ""the one with Jim Carrey in it"".  Fine, benign enough.Wrong.Fast forward about one hour to me inconspicuously offloading the nachos housed on my lap so I could move into ""cry shield posture""......this movie quickly threw off the casual vector in which I had approached it and wrapped me in its seductive and mysterious ether.  I haven't had long enough to fully digest my very strong feelings about this film, but I'm compelled to share at least a few basic thoughts with those interested in reading them.First, this is a wonderfully put together film.  The cinematography is brilliant.  Michel Gondry (the Director) has, in my opinion, done more to preserve the asymmetrical genius of Charlie Kaufmans screenwriting mind than any other previous film (most notably Adaptation and Being John Malcovich - which I should add are both very smartly put together works in their own right).  Perhaps it was that they've worked together before (on a little known indie film starring Tim Robbins called ""Human Nature""), or maybe it was all that time he spent with far out characters like Bjork (directed many of her multi-award winning videos as well as others for artists such as The Rolling Stones, Beck, Daft Punk, Chemical Brothers, Foo Fighters, Lenny Kravitz, Sheryl Crow and Cibo Matto).Setting aside the ""look and feel"" of the film, the basic story is fantastic one.  Without giving too much away, the film chronicles a typical love gone bad.  Two flawed souls who couldn't sustain the incredible weight of love.  The drama enters in with advent of a new technology; the ability to erase painful memories - including whole relationships - from your mind.  That ability, which today may seem impossible or incredibly far off, could one day exist; and what a hellbroth of consequence it would usher in.Experience...chillingly important flashes of memory - deliciously passionate moments of ecstacy, the blindingly painful ones - they comfort, they hurt; quite often they teach.  But this movie brings into light how much more they are a part of us, and even more interestingly, how certain memories (as intersections of choices and time) may be less choice and more destiny.  Not in the ethereal sense, but more as a course of nature.  This movie posits in its main story, as well as subplot, that erasing relationships by way of erasing memory does little to extinguish the natural gravity between people and the choices they have a propensity to make.  That in some sense, relationships have a will to live (almost like biological organisms), to survive as entities; and erasing them doesn't necessarily kill them...There are scenes in this film that elicited such powerful emotion in me that chills ran up my spine and tears down my (deliberately hidden) face.  I think it was in the way in which it reminded me of those relationships in my own life whose memories have such monumental importance.  Even though, through the choices I've made, many of them are sufficiently out of sight and therefore out of mind, for a brief moment they flashed into existence not as pictures of the past, but as living entities.Whether we are fully aware of it or not, those people, those choices, are alive in us.  They are so much of who we are.  This movie weighted me with that realization and left me paralyzed, literally, in my seat.  I wasn't alone.  The movie cuts instantly to black screen and text credit at the end.  No eye candy, no reason to stay; other than to emotionally compose yourself and dry your face......which it took a good number of people in the theatre a understandably long amount of time to do.",5,"A beautiful, painful, and mindbending journey.",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,3925,"['Let', 'see', 'movie', 'together', 'had', 'become', 'wholesome', 'mantra', 'backdrop', 'hedonism', 'debauchery', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'time', 'time', 'span', 'two', 'years', 'see', 'certain', 'girl', 'town.Tonight', 'Paseo', 'Theatre', 'met', 'long', 'promised', 'movie', 'recommended', 'see', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Fine', 'benign', 'enough.Wrong.Fast', 'forward', 'one', 'hour', 'inconspicuously', 'offloading', 'nachos', 'housed', 'lap', 'could', 'move', 'cry', 'shield', 'posture', 'movie', 'quickly', 'threw', 'off', 'casual', 'vector', 'had', 'approached', 'wrapped', 'seductive', 'mysterious', 'ether', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'long', 'enough', 'fully', 'digest', 'very', 'strong', 'feelings', 'film', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'share', 'least', 'few', 'basic', 'thoughts', 'interested', 'reading', 'them.First', 'wonderfully', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'Director', 'opinion', 'done', 'more', 'preserve', 'asymmetrical', 'genius', 'Charlie', 'Kaufmans', 'screenwriting', 'mind', 'other', 'previous', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'should', 'add', 'are', 'very', 'smartly', 'put', 'together', 'works', 'own', 'right', 'Perhaps', 'was', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'together', 'before', 'little', 'known', 'indie', 'film', 'starring', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'called', 'Human', 'Nature', 'maybe', 'was', 'time', 'spent', 'far', 'out', 'characters', 'Bjork', 'directed', 'many', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'videos', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'artists', 'such', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Beck', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'Foo', 'Fighters', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Cibo', 'Matto', '.Setting', 'aside', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'basic', 'story', 'fantastic', 'one', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'typical', 'love', 'gone', 'bad', 'Two', 'flawed', 'souls', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'incredible', 'weight', 'love', 'drama', 'enters', 'advent', 'new', 'technology', 'ability', 'erase', 'painful', 'memories', 'including', 'whole', 'relationships', 'mind', 'ability', 'today', 'may', 'seem', 'impossible', 'incredibly', 'far', 'off', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'exist', 'what', 'hellbroth', 'consequence', 'would', 'usher', 'in.Experience', 'chillingly', 'important', 'flashes', 'memory', 'deliciously', 'passionate', 'moments', 'ecstacy', 'blindingly', 'painful', 'ones', 'comfort', 'hurt', 'quite', 'often', 'teach', 'movie', 'light', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'part', 'even', 'more', 'interestingly', 'how', 'certain', 'memories', 'intersections', 'choices', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'choice', 'more', 'destiny', 'Not', 'ethereal', 'sense', 'more', 'course', 'nature', 'movie', 'main', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'subplot', 'erasing', 'relationships', 'way', 'erasing', 'memory', 'little', 'extinguish', 'natural', 'gravity', 'people', 'choices', 'have', 'propensity', 'make', 'sense', 'relationships', 'have', 'will', 'live', 'almost', 'biological', 'organisms', 'survive', 'entities', 'erasing', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'kill', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'elicited', 'such', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'ran', 'up', 'spine', 'tears', 'down', 'deliberately', 'hidden', 'face', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'reminded', 'relationships', 'own', 'life', 'memories', 'have', 'such', 'monumental', 'importance', 'Even', 'choices', ""'ve"", 'made', 'many', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'sight', 'therefore', 'mind', 'brief', 'moment', 'flashed', 'existence', 'not', 'pictures', 'past', 'living', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'not', 'people', 'choices', 'are', 'alive', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'who', 'are', 'movie', 'weighted', 'realization', 'left', 'paralyzed', 'literally', 'seat', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'movie', 'instantly', 'black', 'screen', 'text', 'credit', 'end', 'eye', 'candy', 'reason', 'stay', 'other', 'emotionally', 'compose', 'dry', 'face', 'took', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'theatre', 'understandably', 'long', 'amount', 'time', 'do']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

In revenge, he tries to have her erased from his memory, but then realizes he doesn't want to lose all the memories of her. The movie doesn't follow a chronological sequence; it is one of those movies where everything makes sense at the end. I usually like movies that keep me guessing till the end, but this isn't one of them. I mean, I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's a movie that I admire more than like.I know people will disagree with me, but one of the reasons for my lukewarm approval of the movie is, simply, it tries too hard to be smart. Don't get me wrong, it is a smart movie with some terrific writing, but as the movie wore on, I sort of lost patience with it. For example, there are many scenes showing Joel and Clementine's relationship that are deliberate placed out of order. For the first hour or so, it worked for me because it was interesting, and I had never seen anything like it. But I felt some scenes just felt out of place...if you can understand the `humiliation' scene, please explain it to me.Despite my reservations with the plot, I thought the movie was very well-acted. Jim Carrey gives a great, nuanced performance - sad, happy, tired. He looks very weathered in the movie and it works here. Kate Winslet also gives a great performance. Her impulsive, spunky Clementine is the perfect compliment to Carrey's despair. The supporting characters are also fantastic, particularly Tom Wilkinson as the doctor, and Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as his assistants. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst, though; she was irritating.Don't let my opinions stop you from seeing this movie. It's one of those movies that you like a lot or you like a little.

620058,AZ5250G2U795I,B00005JMJG,C. K. Ogi,"[0, 0]","Eternal Sunshine is an impossible film to try to surmise, because it is an incredibly complex story that, when you try to relate it to someone, makes perfect sense to you but probably comes out sounding like you have absolutely NO idea what you are talking about.I will try to do it justice in this very short recap.  Joel is recovering from a breakup from his girlfriend Clementine.  The pain is mounting, when he runs into his former love and is further jarred by her inability to show him the slightest recognition.  She isn't just giving him the cold shoulder:  she has no concept who he is.  Through a mixup, Joel discovers Clementine has had him 'erased' from her memory, and he figures this to be a terrific remedy for his heartbreak.  He discovers, during the erasing process, that some memories should stay, and he and the Clementine of his mind work desperately to hide her by incorporating her into other memories of his. The way the story weaves past and present is complicated but engaging.What this movie does BRILLIANTLY examine is what happens to the good memories if we throw out the bad, and how intricately both are woven together.  It also questions how important are experiences we live through in terms of our destiny?  Can we really 'erase' those who fate has put in our paths?  Are the bad memories worth erasing if it means the good go with it?  These are very interesting questions 'Eternal' poses.And I doubt any other actor could have served 'Eternal' well as Joel.  Carrey gives a career best performance as the heartbroken Joel, and it's a performance filled with perfectly nuanced pain.

DeRiemer,"[2, 4]","I reacted to the movie this way...the bad and the good...or the less good and the good, because I think its a fine film.I started out reluctant to see it. For me, Kate Winslet has always had a kind of calculating look about her that I've never responded to except for Quills. And a little Jim Carrey, for me, goes a long way. I react to him the same way I do to Robin Williams. I like them both, but in smaller doses than I usually get. All that energy wears me out after a while, and when they try to be ""serious,"" I think they often veer off into being mawkish.With that out of they way, I still didn't respond much to Winslet, but I thought Carrey did a fine job...understated, lonely, lost. Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst are always first rate in what they do, and they were first rate here.The movie itself was clever by half, but with so much more heart than Charlie Kaufman usually shows. The whole thing of being so hurt by past expectations and hopes that you want out is a powerful plot device. And I think Carrey's performance hit the bulls eye. Swinging back and forth in time, going back and forth between memories and reality, had me quickly paying attention to what was going on. I really like a movie that poses puzzles, with issues that can be figured out only if you don't doze off...and where the writer and director play fair with the audience. Memento and Usual Suspects also come to mind as good examples of this.I think Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's best work, as well as Carrey's.One other thing...Carrey, I think, hits 50 in seven or eight years. It will be interesting to see if he can finally break out of his typical image (Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, etc) and become accepted as a serious, disciplined actor. He's not there yet, but he's trying. Before long I expect to see Mick Jagger and Keith Richards shuffle on stage with walkers, with the sound of their creaking joints drowning out Richards' guitar.

Kate Winslet does a terrific job playing the often times out of control wacko Clementine, who appears to be the diametric opposite of Barish.The fun starts when Winslet, tiring of their rocky relationship undergoes an experimental procedure to totally erase Carey from her memory.  Carey freaks out and in spite also seeks out Dr. Mierzwiak, the inventor of this technology, well played by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson.  He desires to have Winslet also purged from his memory.  During the procedure, Carey gets second thoughts and while bit by bit of his memory is being erased, he starts changing his mind about doing it.  Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are hysterical as Dr. M's technical associates. While reliving memories about to be expunged, Carey decides that he deeply cares for Winslet.""Eternal Sunshine"" was an exhilirating movie experience.

620068,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JMJG,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 4]","Interestingly, as the film scripts of Charlie Kaufman have gotten praised through the roof over the last several years, with comparisons ranging to Herman Mankiewicz, Robert Towne, Paul Schrader, and Paddy Chayefsky- at least in terms of recognizability, most writers I have known have been far less impressed with his solipsistically obsessed screenplays than the general public.I think that is because that any reader of fiction or poetry in the last 40 or so years has been so inundated with puerile post-modernism that self-referential tautologies fail to impress. This is the fourth CK-scripted film I've seen and easily the best film was that he adapted from an outside source- the film of Chuck Barris's autobiography Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind- directed by George Clooney. That's because, given the source, CK was forced to stay on track and not veer back into his own ego like the Titanic to the-  You get what I mean. His first filmed screenplay, Being John Malkovich, was a cute humorous fable- not too deep, nor too troubling. His second scripted film, Adaptation, was merely a banal recapitulation of themes laid out in the first film, yet with the added baggage of destroying a potentially interesting film with a last third larded with the neuroses of writer's block raised to epopee. No, not really, but the attempt was embarrassing. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind explores similar areas of memory and mind far better, although the film has some notable flaws. I grade it as a 75 out of 100- good, but nowhere near the great rankings many critics bestowed upon it....However, this is still the best CK film based on his original script. The problem is that his `original' scripts are all mere slight tangents on the same tired theme.

620069,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005JMJG,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[7, 8]","Surprising enough, given the inclinations of his doppelgangers in the films he has written, I think Charlie Kaufman truly understands love. This is, in fact, quite obvious upon watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.In the first scene, we see Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) skip work impulsively and take a Long Island train to Montauk. There he sees Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they have a cute, though uncomfortable, meeting scene. But in a Kaufman film, nothing is as it seems, and we soon realize that this is not the first time Joel and Clementine have met. In fact, they have just ended an unhappy love affair and chosen to have each other erased from their memories.This is only the first time switch that we will be presented with. But the beauty of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is that the film is not hard to follow. The memory-erasing process is not remotely science-fiction in its presentation and is explained within the context of the story. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) operates Lacuna, Inc. with help from eraser Stan (Mark Ruffalo), his girlfriend Mary (Kirsten Dunst) the receptionist, and co-eraser Patrick (Elijah Wood). When Joel discovers through a friend that Clementine has had him erased, he vindictively goes to do the same, but then realizes--right in the middle of the process--that perhaps even bad memories are better than no memories at all.I'm always very impressed by films that use special effects to enhance the storyline instead of substituting for it. The scene in Amelie where she melts is a perfect example. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the same way. While Joel is having his memory erased, we are taken through scenes from his and Clementine's relationship and we watch as the memory is erased bit by bit. One scene in a bookstore is particularly effective as the titles on the books begin to fade until the shelves are filled with white. In other scenes, people's faces will turn unrecognizable, giving the whole thing an eerie effect.Charlie Kaufman is undoubtedly one of the more original screenwriters Hollywood has working today. So far, the four films (not including Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) he has released have been directed by only two different directors--Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry--and they both began by directing music videos. I think this is an example of the kind of cinematic vision that it takes to interpret Kaufman's work. Michel Gondry directs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with a sure eye for the material, something that was missing from their previous collaboration, Human Nature.The cast is uniformly excellent. Jim Carrey loses his usual antics entirely, even when playing a four-year-old version of himself. I hope he has stopped ""trying"" to win an Academy Award, because this may be the year he takes it. Kate Winslet is a little out of her element as Clementine but she pulls it off wonderfully by just letting the script tell her what to do. Kirsten Dunst is becoming the go-to girl for fully ripe portrayals--she uses her body to its best advantage (there is a long scene where she is only wearing a T-shirt and panties), but as long as it's okay with her, it's okay with me.  And it is really quite a relief to see Elijah Wood playing a decidedly non-heroic role. I had not seen Mark Ruffalo before--though I heard a lot about his work in You Can Count on Me--but he is truly solid, even a standout among this stellar cast.I've had to hold back on the description of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind because a lot of the joy is in discovery and going along in the story with the characters.

620070,A1S1O3YT8NS68A,B00005JMJG,crazyforgems,"[3, 4]","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautiful, sweet, amazing movie.Charlie Kaufman, the eccentric Hollywood screenwriter, penned this script. At first, I hesitated. I had seen some of his previous work-""Being John Malkovich"", ""Adaptation"",-and liked it but thought it weird. I found ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" far more approachable.The plot-or what there is of it-is convoluted yet intriguing. Joel, played by a very low key Jim Carrey, is trying to come to grips with a breakup from his crazy, neurotic girlfriend, Clementine, played by a very high key Kate Winslet. Joel is stunned when he finds that the impulsive, impetuous Clementine has had her memory of their relationship erased by a company that specializes in eliminating bad memories.And so Joel decides that he too, will have his memories erased. Most of the movie centers on the night that he is having his erasure-a complex procedure that involves him being asleep and a very entertaining crew of technicians (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) managing the operation. As Joel relives each memory, the most recent first, he rediscovers the passion and tenderness of the relationship. And he wants to reclaim these memories. Ah, but to no avail: even if his technicians were paying attention (they're partying very hard), they really couldn't stop the procedure. And so Joel tries to escape them by escaping with Clementine into the recesses of his mind.This movie boasts outstanding performance. You will not recognize Jim Carrey: beyond his goatee and scruffy appearance, he plays this role in the lowest key possible. Quite a change from his manic, high key public persona. He very generously lets the magnificent Kate Winslet steal every scene. Meanwhile Kirsten Dunst continues to astonish me. She possesses a leading lady's looks and talent-yet she chooses to appear in character roles like ""Mary"" in this movie. She is amazing. So is Mark Ruffalo.This movie is very sweet, very romantic and of course, very offbeat. I would recommend it to those who love romantic comedy--with a twist.",5,"Brilliant, offbeat, sweet romance",1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,2088,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'amazing', 'movie.Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'eccentric', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'penned', 'script', 'first', 'hesitated', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'work-', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', '-and', 'liked', 'thought', 'weird', 'found', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'far', 'more', 'approachable.The', 'plot-or', 'what', 'it-is', 'convoluted', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'Joel', 'played', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'breakup', 'crazy', 'neurotic', 'girlfriend', 'Clementine', 'played', 'very', 'high', 'key', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Joel', 'stunned', 'when', 'impulsive', 'impetuous', 'Clementine', 'had', 'memory', 'relationship', 'erased', 'company', 'eliminating', 'bad', 'memories.And', 'so', 'Joel', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'memories', 'erased', 'Most', 'movie', 'centers', 'night', 'having', 'erasure-a', 'complex', 'procedure', 'being', 'asleep', 'very', 'entertaining', 'crew', 'technicians', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'managing', 'operation', 'Joel', 'memory', 'most', 'recent', 'first', 'passion', 'tenderness', 'relationship', 'reclaim', 'memories', 'Ah', 'avail', 'even', 'technicians', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', ""'re"", 'partying', 'very', 'hard', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'procedure', 'so', 'Joel', 'tries', 'escape', 'escaping', 'Clementine', 'recesses', 'mind.This', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'recognize', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'goatee', 'scruffy', 'appearance', 'role', 'lowest', 'key', 'possible', 'change', 'manic', 'high', 'key', 'public', 'persona', 'very', 'generously', 'magnificent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'steal', 'scene', 'Meanwhile', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'astonish', 'leading', 'lady', 'looks', 'talent-yet', 'appear', 'character', 'roles', 'Mary', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo.This', 'movie', 'very', 'sweet', 'very', 'romantic', 'course', 'very', 'offbeat', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'twist']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620071,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JMJG,Cubist,"[14, 16]","Filmmaker Michel Gondry must be a firm believer in the old saying, ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" His feature film debut was the Charlie Kaufman-penned Human Nature that, by most accounts, was simply awful. Maybe Gondry just didn't connect with the material or figure out a way to bring it successfully to life. His second feature and second crack at a Kaufman screenplay, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was met, initially, with trepidation. By most accounts, he's directed one of the most original films in years.The Collector's Edition comes with an attractive booklet filled with glossy photos and excerpts from enthusiastic reviews praising the movie.The first disc starts with ""A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" a promo with soundbite interviews and clips from the movie. The cast and crew talk about the characters and the unique nature of the script.""A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry"" is an entertaining dialogue between the two men mixed with rehearsal footage. They talk about the hardest day of the shoot when they got into a heated argument that they can laugh about now.There is an audio commentary by Gondry and Kaufman. They had pitched the idea for the movie as early as 1998 and not surprisingly had a tough time finding a studio willing to take a chance.There are seven minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, there is no context for the footage of a commentary track to explain why they were cut out. It almost simulates the mind erosion that Joel experiences in the movie. What do these scenes mean?There is a music video for ""Light and Day"" by Polyphonic Spree that tweaks footage from the movie in an unsettling way.There is also a funny commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the fictitious company that erases people's memories.The second disc begins with ""Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry"", a 20-minute look at the director's creative process. It is amazing how much of the film's more fantastical images were done without CGI, just good ol' fashioned editing, lighting or forced perspective shots.""Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue"" examines how a specific scene was put together, mostly through CGI with the sound effects and score explored in detail.""A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry"" is a dialogue between the actress and the filmmaker. She was surprised that Gondry cast her as she was known mostly for reserved period dramas.Finally, there are almost 19-minutes of additional deleted or extended footage. Mostly, it is bits and pieces that were trimmed from existing scenes. We even see Joel's previous girlfriend, Naomi, who is only mentioned in the final cut.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film about how precious our memories are and how we should savour them while we can because our minds erase them gradually over time on their own anyway. Kaufman has established an ingenious premise: the notion of selectively erasing your memories and reliving a relationship again and again. The story actually starts at the end and works its way back-think of a romantic comedy version of Memento.",5,A love story in reverse...,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,3125,"['Filmmaker', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'must', 'be', 'firm', 'believer', 'old', 'saying', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'try', 'try', 'again', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman-penned', 'Human', 'Nature', 'most', 'accounts', 'was', 'simply', 'awful', 'Maybe', 'Gondry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'material', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'bring', 'successfully', 'life', 'second', 'feature', 'second', 'crack', 'Kaufman', 'screenplay', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'was', 'met', 'initially', 'trepidation', 'most', 'accounts', 'directed', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'films', 'years.The', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'attractive', 'booklet', 'filled', 'glossy', 'photos', 'excerpts', 'enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'praising', 'movie.The', 'first', 'starts', 'A', 'Look', 'Inside', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'promo', 'soundbite', 'interviews', 'clips', 'movie', 'cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'characters', 'unique', 'nature', 'script', 'Conversation', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'entertaining', 'dialogue', 'two', 'men', 'mixed', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'talk', 'hardest', 'day', 'shoot', 'when', 'got', 'heated', 'argument', 'can', 'laugh', 'now.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Gondry', 'Kaufman', 'had', 'pitched', 'idea', 'movie', 'as', 'early', '1998', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'finding', 'studio', 'willing', 'take', 'chance.There', 'are', 'seven', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'context', 'footage', 'commentary', 'track', 'explain', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'almost', 'mind', 'erosion', 'Joel', 'experiences', 'movie', 'What', 'do', 'scenes', 'mean', 'music', 'video', 'Light', 'Day', 'Polyphonic', 'Spree', 'tweaks', 'footage', 'movie', 'unsettling', 'way.There', 'also', 'funny', 'commercial', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.', 'fictitious', 'company', 'people', 'memories.The', 'second', 'disc', 'Mind', 'Michel', 'Gondry', '20-minute', 'look', 'director', 'creative', 'process', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'more', 'fantastical', 'images', 'were', 'done', 'CGI', 'just', 'good', 'ol', 'fashioned', 'editing', 'lighting', 'forced', 'perspective', 'shots', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'Saratoga', 'Avenue', 'how', 'specific', 'scene', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'sound', 'effects', 'score', 'explored', 'detail', 'Conversation', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'dialogue', 'actress', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'surprised', 'Gondry', 'cast', 'was', 'known', 'mostly', 'reserved', 'period', 'dramas.Finally', 'are', 'almost', '19-minutes', 'additional', 'deleted', 'extended', 'footage', 'Mostly', 'bits', 'pieces', 'were', 'trimmed', 'existing', 'scenes', 'even', 'see', 'Joel', 'previous', 'girlfriend', 'Naomi', 'who', 'only', 'mentioned', 'final', 'cut.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'film', 'how', 'precious', 'memories', 'are', 'how', 'should', 'savour', 'can', 'because', 'minds', 'erase', 'gradually', 'time', 'own', 'anyway', 'Kaufman', 'established', 'ingenious', 'premise', 'notion', 'selectively', 'erasing', 'memories', 'reliving', 'relationship', 'again', 'again', 'story', 'actually', 'end', 'way', 'back-think', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'version', 'Memento']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Although I will warn you that if you want traditional romance, comedy, and drama, then this film is not for you.  After all it is made by Focus Features, and was written by Charlie Kauffman.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky comedy/drama.  Jim Carrey is amazing as the understated, and at times, dull Joel.  Kate Winslet is perfection as the outspoken, trying-so-hard-to-impress-you freak girl Clementine.  They meet and have a wonderful relationship, but like so many others, they fall apart.In the quirkiest of turns, Joel finds out Clementine has had him erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same.  And this is where the action and emotion begin.  While remembering all the pain and anguish this love affair caused him, he also realizes that those emotions pale in comparison to the love and affection they also shared (but have apparently forgotten about).This movie has a truly stunning ending that makes me cry with happiness.

620076,A1PLRDMBCSULMI,B00005JMJG,Daniel Ferrisi,"[2, 2]","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the year's first great film, and a welcome haven for any filmgoer who has gotten tired of the B and C level movies that inhabit the theatres following Oscar season. Eternal Sunshine is exactly what you'd expect from scribe Charlie Kaufman working at the top of his form--inventive, mind-blowing storytelling with a helping of sharp dialogue and a dash of bizarre characters. Kaufman's typical problem areas, pacing and detachment from the audience, are nowhere to be found here, making the film substantially better than Being John Malkovich and perhaps a notch better than Adaptation.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is a single New York schlub who drags his feet through life, a victim of his own inability to take risks and break from the comforts of habit. Clementine Kruczynski (a remarkably accent-less Kate Winslet) is Joel's foil, a hair-dyed, spontaneous rebel who is easily bored and repelled by routine. Against all odds, the two hit it off tremendously and begin a long and tumultuous relationship. Over the course of two years together, their partnership is a roller coaster of manic-depressive magnitude.Eventually, they harshly split up, with Clementine determined to not just end the relationship, but to eradicate every trace of its ever existing. She goes to Lacuna Inc., a company that has pioneered a new procedure that wipes from the brain unpleasant memories. When Joel finds out that Clementine has erased him, he spitefully decides to do the same. He meets Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (a really good Tom Wilkinson), as well as secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst) and geeky tech guy Stan (a wild-haired Mark Ruffalo). Shortly after, Stan and his assistant (Elijah Wood) are in Joel's apartment, ready to cleanse his emotional wounds.Unfortunately, Joel is in a conscious dream state while his memories of Clementine are being deleted, and he slowly begins to realize that though the relationship turned sour, tender memories die hard. He changes his mind, and with the help of Clem, tries to evade the permanent loss of the only person who ever pushed his boundaries and challenged his robotic lifestyle. Frenetic and touching simultaneously, the two explore the crannies of Joel's mind in a frantic dash for togetherness.Carrey and Winslet are both great, reaching career highs and approaching Oscar caliber work. Director Michel Gondry balances the comedic and dramatic tones skillfully, as well as the Candyland glitter of a dream and the flatter mundanity of a Long Island train station. Kaufman's script is full of real gems, such as an exchange between Clementine and Joel in which she accuses him of using the oldest trick in ""the stalker book."" ""There's a stalker book?"" he asks. ""I've got to read that.""Eternal Sunshine unfolds in a loopy, non-linear way, but while in many cases such a structure is either a rip-off or a gimmick to hide weak material, in this case it works flawlessly. The ""bookend"" scenes at the beginning and finale add a layer to the material that is only fully realized, and appreciated, during the long conversation the film provokes on the ride home. Also to its credit, Eternal Sunshine is fairly easy to grasp, accessible not only to those who like having their minds bent, but to everyone who gives the film the attention it warrants. A second viewing will come from appreciation, rather than incomprehension.There are a couple of sequences, particularly one where Joel is remembering back to being a young child, when Carrey's tendency toward zany overacting becomes a bit overbearing on a story that walks the line between creativity and outrageousness. One scene in particular, when he's hiding under the kitchen table, is detrimental to the film's tone. Yet, even with Kaufman's creative flourishes, genuine emotion is captured in the third act. As the film winds toward its finale, numerous possible endings are in reach. It is a major accomplishment that the filmmakers chose just the right one.

620077,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JMJG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","I really have to get out more because I wasn't even familiar with this film until about a month ago, when one of my friends told me how good it was and said it was probably the type of film I would like. I've never been a big fan of Jim Carrey's movies, so I held off watching it for a few weeks - only to learn that my friend was right on target with her recommendation to me. I can't imagine how this incredible motion picture experience escaped my attention for so long. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just incredible, the kind of film that renews one's faith in motion pictures. Every time I think Hollywood's last glowing embers of originality and intellectual beauty have been snuffed out by an endless rehashing of uninspired sequels and re-makes, a film like this comes out and blows me away. Let me be perfectly clear: I absolutely love this movie.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't your typical Hollywood faire. It's a complex film that some will undoubtedly find confusing, and that's okay. For those who love a deep, multi-layered, challenging motion picture presented in an ingenious, somewhat risky manner, though, this film is something to shout about. This is a romance, a drama, a comedy, and a marginal science fiction (concept-wise, anyway) film all rolled into one exquisite ball that can leave you laughing one minute, crying the next, and tossing and turning all night trying to push the story out of your mind long enough for you to fall asleep.To succeed, this film had to have great performances by all of the main characters - and it did. Jim Carrey was amazing; I'm not a big fan of his over-the-top comedic films, and I wasn't sure he could pull off a role such as that of the shy, quiet, introspective Joel Barish - he definitely surprised me here. Kate Winslet made the movie for me, though; she is simply enchanting as the quirky and delightfully spontaneous Clementine Kruczynksi. Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others turned in solid performances in the form of secondary characters, but this film is really all about Joel and Clementine.The plot revolves around the unusual but definitely heart-warming romance of our two charmingly unique lovers and their subsequent decisions to have each other erased from their memories. Joel wakes up one day and finds Clem gone from his life; she truly doesn't even know him anymore. Naturally, this would devastate and confuse any man; when he finds out she had him erased from her memories, he naturally decides to do the same thing rather than live with the pain of losing her. As he begins reliving the memories as they are erased, though, he realizes that a lot of wonderful memories are being taken away from him. Helpless to stop the procedure, he fights as hard as he can to keep Clem in his heart and mind.I've just described the movie, but I really haven't described it at all - not by a long shot. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the kind of film that defies description. You really have to experience it for yourself - and I would encourage you to do so. This is truly one of the most memorable, exquisite, touching films to come along in a long, long time.",5,Nothing short of exquisite in both story and execution,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,3171,"['really', 'have', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'familiar', 'film', 'month', 'ago', 'when', 'one', 'friends', 'told', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'probably', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'like', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'held', 'off', 'watching', 'few', 'weeks', 'only', 'learn', 'friend', 'was', 'right', 'target', 'recommendation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'incredible', 'motion', 'picture', 'experience', 'escaped', 'attention', 'so', 'long', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'just', 'incredible', 'kind', 'film', 'one', 'faith', 'motion', 'pictures', 'time', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'glowing', 'embers', 'originality', 'intellectual', 'beauty', 'have', 'been', 'snuffed', 'out', 'endless', 'rehashing', 'uninspired', 'sequels', 're-makes', 'film', 'out', 'blows', 'away', 'Let', 'be', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'faire', 'complex', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'find', 'confusing', 'okay', 'who', 'love', 'deep', 'multi-layered', 'challenging', 'motion', 'picture', 'presented', 'ingenious', 'somewhat', 'risky', 'manner', 'though', 'film', 'something', 'shout', 'about', 'romance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'marginal', 'science', 'fiction', 'concept-wise', 'anyway', 'film', 'rolled', 'one', 'exquisite', 'ball', 'can', 'leave', 'laughing', 'one', 'minute', 'crying', 'next', 'tossing', 'turning', 'night', 'trying', 'push', 'story', 'mind', 'long', 'enough', 'fall', 'asleep.To', 'succeed', 'film', 'had', 'have', 'great', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'over-the-top', 'comedic', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'such', 'shy', 'quiet', 'introspective', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'definitely', 'surprised', 'here', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'made', 'movie', 'though', 'simply', 'enchanting', 'quirky', 'delightfully', 'spontaneous', 'Clementine', 'Kruczynksi', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'others', 'turned', 'solid', 'performances', 'form', 'secondary', 'characters', 'film', 'really', 'Joel', 'Clementine.The', 'plot', 'unusual', 'definitely', 'heart-warming', 'romance', 'two', 'charmingly', 'unique', 'lovers', 'subsequent', 'decisions', 'have', 'other', 'erased', 'memories', 'Joel', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'Clem', 'gone', 'life', 'truly', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'anymore', 'Naturally', 'would', 'devastate', 'confuse', 'man', 'when', 'out', 'had', 'erased', 'memories', 'naturally', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'rather', 'live', 'pain', 'losing', 'reliving', 'memories', 'are', 'erased', 'though', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'Helpless', 'stop', 'procedure', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'keep', 'Clem', 'heart', 'mind.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'described', 'movie', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'described', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'kind', 'film', 'description', 'really', 'have', 'experience', 'would', 'encourage', 'do', 'so', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'exquisite', 'touching', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'long', 'long', 'time']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Honestly, I was  disappointed I didn't enjoy this film because my expectations were very high.  Maybe too high.  I LOVED Being John Malkovich and for the most part LOVED Adaptation; both Charlie Kaufman screenplays.  So why didn't I love this?  I thought the idea behind the film was very good and the cast excellent.  Though I can think of several other actors who could probably have given the character of Joel a little more depth than Jim Carrey.  Sorry.  I hate to dump on the guy but he doesn't have much range, as far as I'm concerned.  Anyway, if you're to buy this film and its premise then you need to believe in the relationship at its heart between Joel & Clementine.  And I just didn't.  Carrey played the role with a perpetual ""sad sack"" expression on his face and Winslet came across as more annoying than anything else.  What exactly attracted these two to each other?  I didn't see it.  And I didn't find either character particularly likeable.  I usually like Winslet in just about anything.  Even her famous peeing scene in Holy Smoke.  LOL!!!  Anyway, another problem was Gondry's direction.  To me, he kept us far removed from any emotional attachment to his characters.  And the eccentric editing & cutting didn't help at all.  And don't get me started on the annoying background music that accompanied certain scenes.  I can't really say there was anything about the film I liked except for the cast & idea, adding up to 2 stars.

Dein ""passafist""","[10, 16]","I think a casual movie-goer is used to seeing a name like Julia Roberts or Adam Sandler and knowing exactly what to expect from them.  Jim Carrey on the other hand keeps throwing us all for a loop.  He's an actor whose climbed and fought his way to the top because he has the ability to be himself in any role, and yet at the same time engross his audience into believing he's not really there.  With the right director Jim Carrey can shine, even if the material is weak.  He shines in this film even if it doesn't quite match up.So what happens when you mix Carrey with Screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann, one of the few offbeat writers that continues to get work done in the Hollywood system?  ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND is what you get.  The film tells the story of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  Two lovers who are torn apart and yet drawn together by tattered memories.  You see an enterprising doctor named Howard (Tom Wilkenson) has created a medical process in which people can be removed from your memory ultimately removing them from your life.  It seems Clemintine has already undergone this process and so Joel does the same thing.  That is until he realizes our memories make us and it might regret losing them.I sometimes wonder what the early pioneer's of film would think of what it has becometoday.  Like any great media it's had its hurdles of technical innovation to jump through.Would they like what they saw or would they be like the old man who sat behind me atETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND?  He hated it, for all the wrong reasons.So do we make memories or do memories make us?  That is the basic premise of the story.  We watch with frantic hope to grasp the story as it runs through Joel's mind.  It's told in a style that is far from linear, jumping from moment to moment without much time to breathe.  Like some bizarre ""Alice in Wonderland"" adventure.  I kept hoping to see the Cheshire Cat's grim jump into the frame.  Sometimes the film gets a little crazy and yet the movie is strangely engrossing.  That is if you let it.So what happens when you mix Carrey with Screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann, one of the few offbeat writers that continues to get work done in the Hollywood system?

You have to engage your eyes and brain and put pieces together.  Half the fun of this film is interpretation.  If you can't you'll hate it.  I mean if you walk into this movie with hopes of BRUCE ALMIGHTY you'll probably feel as gypped as those Adam Sandler fans that laid out money for PUNCHDRUNK LOVE.That being said the film does overstay it's welcome especially after it weaves in subplots involving Kiresten Dunst and Elijah Wood.  I understand their inclusion in the film I just wished they didn't feel so curt.  They sort of reemphasize points that's are already made by Joel and Clemintine in far more effective ways.  They steal from the self-discovery of the hero, and thus knock the movie down pegs it really didn't have to.So will you like ETERNAL SUNSHINE?  If you're in for an inventive trip with lots of suppress, and you also like to discuss the nature of philosophy and it's effect on man, absolutely.

This critically acclaimed film shows more of writer Charlie Kaufman's creative mind beyond his past works ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"".  Some may consider this his best work.  He stays true to his signature writing style throughout this film.  The unusual events chained to one another surprisingly fit, making this film much more groundbreaking.  The plot of Joel wanting to erase ex-girlfriend Clementine from his mind takes a unique turn.  As it explores the relationship between the two - backwards - the camera graphics deeply reveal the emotions of Joel and Clementine.  Meanwhile, Joel learns his past wrongs.The acting amongst the cast is amazing, namely Carrey and Winslet.  Carrey, as Joel, unbelievably holds back the signature slapstick comedy style and replaces it with his dramatic side.  This style is a big step from his previous dramatic effort ""The Majestic"".  He could finally receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  Equally emotional in her performance is Winslet as Clementine.  As always, whether she expresses free-spirit or sadness, she shows how great an actress she is.  The rest express their strengths in various scenes, especially Dunst after her character discovers a shocking secret about her own past.Such film quality makes ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" enjoyable for many audiences.

That's why I was so glad to finally see this wonderfully inventive film last week. Jim Carrey plays a man in a relationship with a spiky unpredictable woman (Kate Winslet) who tires of him and pays to have all memories of him wiped from her mind. He's pretty upset by this and decides to take his revenge by going to the same clinic and undergoing the same prodecure.By this stage of the film I was interested in the idea, nothing more. The performances chug along and while the spectacle isn't that gripping, I hung on to see what happened. I'm glad I did. The movie really takes off as Carrey is knocked unconscious and lies down at home while the clinic's experts attach him up to their computers and start zapping Winslet out of his memory. Suddenly he half wakes and decides this might not be such a good idea. She appears beside him and they relive some of their past, all the time as the backdrop is wiped away by the clinic. They are left scrambling from memory to memory and then, in desperation, he takes her to parts of his past life that have nothing to do with her, all in a bid to hide from the eradication process. The scene turns into an elegy to pain, happiness, memories both good and bad, love, relationships and perhaps most of all regret, examining what could have happened had you decided to do something different at a moment which turned out to be a turning point, although you didn't realise it at the time.I found this to be surprisingly moving. My wife, watching with me, thought it  bewildering. I can see how this film would appeal to some people and totally deter others. I won't say much more about the plot, which continues to twist away, save to say the movie takes no short cuts and ends with a scene I'll call intriguing, and leave it at that.Eternal Sunshine won the best Oscar for original screenplay and fully deserved the honour.",5,"Starts slowly, turns into a wonderfully inventive romance",1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,2029,"['depressing', 'era', 'where', 'general', 'schlock', 'laziness', 'seem', 'be', 'hallmarks', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'rare', 'find', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'original', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'see', 'wonderfully', 'inventive', 'film', 'last', 'week', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'man', 'relationship', 'spiky', 'unpredictable', 'woman', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'pays', 'have', 'memories', 'wiped', 'mind', 'pretty', 'upset', 'take', 'revenge', 'going', 'same', 'clinic', 'undergoing', 'same', 'prodecure.By', 'stage', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'idea', 'nothing', 'more', 'performances', 'chug', 'along', 'spectacle', ""n't"", 'gripping', 'hung', 'see', 'what', 'happened', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'movie', 'really', 'off', 'Carrey', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'down', 'home', 'clinic', 'experts', 'attach', 'computers', 'start', 'zapping', 'Winslet', 'memory', 'Suddenly', 'half', 'wakes', 'decides', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'relive', 'past', 'time', 'backdrop', 'wiped', 'away', 'clinic', 'are', 'left', 'scrambling', 'memory', 'memory', 'then', 'desperation', 'parts', 'past', 'life', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'bid', 'hide', 'eradication', 'process', 'scene', 'elegy', 'pain', 'happiness', 'memories', 'good', 'bad', 'love', 'relationships', 'perhaps', 'most', 'regret', 'examining', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'decided', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'moment', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'time.I', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'My', 'wife', 'watching', 'thought', 'bewildering', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'people', 'totally', 'deter', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'twist', 'away', 'save', 'say', 'movie', 'short', 'cuts', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'call', 'intriguing', 'leave', 'that.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'won', 'best', 'Oscar', 'original', 'screenplay', 'fully', 'deserved', 'honour']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

He is at a small lab called Lacuna, a company which specializes in removing the memories of someone you love so they don't hurt you anymore.  Joel's ex girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has already had the procedure performed and so Joel is there partly for spite and partly to let go of the pain.The movie, around 100 minutes in length, spends the majority of this time on Joel's procedure.  The lab is staffed by a main doctor (Tom Wilkenson), an assistant who does the all night erasing work (Mark Ruffalo), a pretty receptionist (Kirsten Dunst) and a kid who assists Ruffalo in the erasure (Elijah Wood).  About halfway through the erasure of Clementine from his memory, Joel decides there are some memories too good to let go of, and decides that the pain of loving and losing her is better than thinking he never knew her and he tries to abort the procedure.  This leads us into a strange journey into Joel's subconscious, where he tries to outwit the doctors he has hired to cleanse his brain of his ex girlfriend.The film is a brilliant idea and is very well executed.  Visually it is stunning, as Joel's memories are erased, we see his surroundings changing around him.  Charlie Kaufman, the writer, has already shown us his ability to think outside the box with his movies, with films like ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"".  Here, he once again takes a simple concept like love lost and takes a totally different angle on it--What if you could go back to before you ever met this person and start from scratch?The film actually answers this question--or it tries to.  The one weakness of the movie is that there are a couple of side plots which tie the whole story together, but are not really necessary and we don't care about them.  This is a movie about Joel and Clementine, not anyone else.  I found these other storylines, which come toward the end of the film, tiresome and distracting.The DVD itself is okay, but nothing superb.  There is a conversation between the French director, Michel Gondry and star Jim Carrey which is interesting, a commentary with screenwriter Kaufman and Gondry, and a brief ""look"" at the film with snipit interviews with the whole cast.  It's basically a long trailer of the movie.  There are 4 deleted scenes which add nothing to the story and were wisely left out, and finally a short commercial to the fictional company ""Lacuna"" which is funny.  The film's transfer is very good, and the sound (DTS) is great.  Overall this is a DVD you will enjoy.

Given that Jim Carrey starred, that's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry in particular) involved with this delightful and imaginative project.  Both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet play skillfully against type--he shy and introverted; she way off-beat.  Their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to--like eyes adjusting to a darkened room, but it's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view.  Other treats include Elijah Wood (Frodo) role as junior memory erasure technician and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman's girlfriend) quoting ""Pope Alexander's"" poem that gives the film its title.

620087,A3RQWGYU848KYV,B00005JMJG,"Debby ""Dreamy Debb""","[4, 6]","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is an atypical romantic drama, as suggested from its unusual title. From the beginning to the end it leads the audience to a journey mixed with joys and sorrows resulted from one failed romance. After watching the movie, its philosophical connotation makes me ruminate over and over.The movie starts with a somberly subtle suspense when Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) met supposedly for the first time. They were attracted to each other at once and spent the following day together, yet the delight of finding the right person is blurred by an unknown scent of sadness, which voluntarily produces a mysterious circumstance to continue the storytelling.Another part of the story begins as Joel decided to cleanse Clementine thoroughly from his mind after he discovered that she had taken such a drastic measure in an attempt to turn over a new leaf. However, when the operation was being carried out, Joel re-experienced every moment he and Clementine had spent together. Although some were sweet and some were painful, Joel found that the memories were too precious to let go. With his headstrong reluctance, he made efforts to resist to the overwhelming procedure of the operation. His struggles were out of question futile, yet there were quite a few things he could have done or could have undone to mend the doomed relationship. Therefore, Joel reviewed his intense love for Clementine with a more thoughtful attitude in the fictitious occasions created in his brain before they disappeared.Perhaps it is an axiom that people will not learn to treasure things until they are lost. However, we always end up treading in the wrong footsteps again and again. The subplots in the film serve as another evident proof. Everyone, black and blue from the wounds their troubles cause, is victim to this unchangeable cycle.The memory may no longer exist; nevertheless, fate or some divine power still gather the same people in one cluster. When Joel and Clementine reunite in the end, will they go through their same old problems and suffer another painful breakup thereafter? On the other hand, is true love everlasting so that even though the two lovers are strangers, destiny or fate will eventually unite them? The movie can be interpreted in two aspects, both are thought-provoking.Love can be both bliss and anguish, yet it is not to be denied. Its presence everywhere weaves human life into an inexplicable mystery, in which we feel and breathe.Highly recommended. 5/5",5,Lost time is found again?,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,2526,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'atypical', 'romantic', 'drama', 'suggested', 'unusual', 'title', 'beginning', 'end', 'audience', 'journey', 'mixed', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'resulted', 'one', 'failed', 'romance', 'watching', 'movie', 'philosophical', 'connotation', 'ruminate', 'over.The', 'movie', 'somberly', 'subtle', 'suspense', 'when', 'Joel', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'met', 'supposedly', 'first', 'time', 'were', 'attracted', 'other', 'once', 'spent', 'following', 'day', 'together', 'yet', 'delight', 'finding', 'right', 'person', 'blurred', 'unknown', 'scent', 'sadness', 'voluntarily', 'mysterious', 'circumstance', 'continue', 'storytelling.Another', 'part', 'story', 'Joel', 'decided', 'cleanse', 'Clementine', 'thoroughly', 'mind', 'discovered', 'had', 'taken', 'drastic', 'measure', 'attempt', 'turn', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'However', 'when', 'operation', 'was', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'Joel', 're-experienced', 'moment', 'Clementine', 'had', 'spent', 'together', 'were', 'sweet', 'were', 'painful', 'Joel', 'found', 'memories', 'were', 'too', 'precious', 'let', 'go', 'headstrong', 'reluctance', 'made', 'efforts', 'resist', 'overwhelming', 'procedure', 'operation', 'struggles', 'were', 'question', 'futile', 'yet', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'could', 'have', 'undone', 'mend', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'Therefore', 'Joel', 'reviewed', 'intense', 'love', 'Clementine', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'attitude', 'fictitious', 'occasions', 'created', 'brain', 'disappeared.Perhaps', 'axiom', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'learn', 'treasure', 'things', 'are', 'lost', 'However', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'treading', 'wrong', 'footsteps', 'again', 'again', 'subplots', 'film', 'serve', 'evident', 'proof', 'Everyone', 'black', 'blue', 'wounds', 'troubles', 'cause', 'victim', 'unchangeable', 'cycle.The', 'memory', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'nevertheless', 'fate', 'divine', 'power', 'still', 'same', 'people', 'one', 'cluster', 'When', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'reunite', 'end', 'will', 'go', 'same', 'old', 'problems', 'suffer', 'painful', 'breakup', 'thereafter', 'other', 'hand', 'true', 'love', 'everlasting', 'even', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'strangers', 'destiny', 'fate', 'will', 'eventually', 'unite', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'two', 'aspects', 'are', 'thought-provoking.Love', 'can', 'be', 'bliss', 'anguish', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'presence', 'everywhere', 'human', 'life', 'inexplicable', 'mystery', 'feel', 'breathe.Highly', 'recommended', '5/5']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film.  Yet, yet...  There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role.  Sorta straight.  Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines.  I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie.  She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week.  Yeah, I remember her.  My god she was nice.  Quirky, but nice.And then she erased all memory of me.  I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me.  Didn't know me!  Wow, after all we had been through.  I mean she's an emotional roller coaster.  And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased.  And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right.  I met her on the beach.  But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned.  Mary, her name is.  She and the doc had this fling.  He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again.  Really bummed his wife out.Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control.  She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people.  All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan.  There's something going on here with these memory movies.  I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it.  Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories?  Would life be worth living?  If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals?Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life.  But is it possible to selectively erase memories?  I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose?  Is that legal?  It is safe?  Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999).  Need I say more?  I mean clever with a capital K.  By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski.  Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted?  No, that was Kaczynski.  Okay, never mind.  Anyway, here's a clever line: ""Are we like couples you see in restaurants?  Are we the dining dead?""  I think I said that, or wish I had.  Or, ""Drink up young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.""  She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory.

I think I have should have the 2-disc set, but this is what I've got...Talking about this film I must say I was very impressed. I'm not really sure that the whole plot has convinced me at all, but I think it is really innovative, close to Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" and much better than Cruise's ""Vanilla Sky"". The way scenes are developed is also fascinating.The science-fiction background is something you can be for or against. You can be conviced or not about the experience that is carried out with the ""main character"" mind to let it be spotless. During the first 3/4 hour you can see what is all about.The romantic background is out of all doubt. The story of these two strange couple is lovely and their acting is very funny. Carrey can and must do the best of himself like in this movie and forget doing things like ""Liar Liar"" and ""Ace Ventura"". Winslet is at least the actress she could be in ""Titanic"" and now is showing the best of herself. Brilliant job.But, why did I have to quit one star and not give five? The reason is, for me, very simple, the middle of the film is somewhat ridiculous. I have to refer to the scene in which the treatment is applied. The assistant doctor, his friend and his fianc&eacute;e having a party at the same time they try to erase the memory is something apart of the main line of the story.Yes, the idea is memorable.

620092,A2FCL4OC6CJB0X,B00005JMJG,Devon,"[8, 11]","A man lies still in his bed as a semi-whimsical score begins to play softly behind.  A painted birdhouse hangs in the window; a slight breeze, a clean room of neutral colors.  The mans opens his eyes, his body stiff, and a whispy voice-over begins as the man embarks on what may become one of the strangest days of his life.  Ten minutes and several plot points later, the opening credits roll: Focus Features presents Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I know the opening all too well.  I saw the film four times on the big screen before buying it on DVD the other day.The genius and apparent insanity of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) strikes again with Eternal Sunshine, yet in a more breathtaking and emotionally charged fashion than ever before.  While reaching, but meanwhile utterly confusing mainstream audiences with his previous stories of love, freedom, and odd occurrences, the script of Eternal Sunshine reaches a compromise between reality and fantasy enough to satisfy both romantic comedy lover and Kaufman fanatic alike.The storyline itself is fairly straightforward:  boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy and girl argue, girl leaves boy.  However, there is twist.  In this case, Clementine (played outstandingly by Kate Winslet) decides to have her lover Joel (Jim Carrey) erased from her memory forever.  Yes, erased.  Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) has created a system to erase memories from the human brain, effectively eliminating a person or pet from one's mind forever.Strange enough for Kaufman?  Not quite.The manner in which the story is told most notably carries on the screenwriter's anti-mainstream tradition.  Through montages of special effects, trick photography, superb acting, intense editing, and enlightening music, a comic yet touching story is told of the love of Clementine and Joel.  While it may take more than several scenes to even partially comprehend the story portrayed on screen, the seemingly random and roundabout presentation eventually becomes a clear contributor to the emotionally grounded themes of the film.Meanwhile, Eternal Sunshine is perfectly acted.  Kate Winslet's acting talents take on new challenges as she aptly fills the shoes of the hard-headed but strangely comedic book store clerk Clementine, while Jim Carrey's comic impulses step aside in the intense and quietly dramatic Joel.  In roles so different from their previous works, the actors create entirely new entities.  Prior conceptions of the dramatic Winslet or the hilarious Carrey dissipate as the chemistry on screen within their own characters and with each other proves more than alarming.  Meanwhile, Kirsten Dunst, as Dr. Mierzwiak's receptionist, confirms that her acting talent with a character that is almost unbearably multi-dimensional.  Each player, including the supporting cast of Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood, is given and utilizes the opportunity to completely open himself on screen.  Every character achieves compassion.As a platform for the film's brilliantly drawn characters, Michel's Gondry's direction coupled with unique cinematography and John Brion's terrific original score create a world of Eternal Sunshine that is not quite real and not quite false.  Gondry grants realistic human emotion to each beautifully composed scene, however visually strange it may be.  And while the cinematography has a tendency to become a bit documentary, the effect is ultimately a sense of heightened realism necessary to counterbalance the plot's peculiarity.Beneath the brilliant acting, direction, editing, writing, and cinematography of Eternal Sunshine is its emotional core.  There are moments that evoke tears, moments that evoke rounds of laughter, and moments that evoke deep thought.  The film speaks to not only lovers past, present, and future, but the human soul.  And in its way, the film is simply what the viewer brings to it.I have seen very few films so many times; if I had already watched it one hundred times, I would go out and watch it one hundred more.  And each time my amazement would reach greater and greater heights.",5,Eternal Sunshine in Every Frame,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,4152,"['man', 'still', 'bed', 'semi-whimsical', 'score', 'play', 'softly', 'painted', 'birdhouse', 'hangs', 'window', 'slight', 'breeze', 'clean', 'room', 'neutral', 'colors', 'mans', 'eyes', 'body', 'stiff', 'whispy', 'voice-over', 'man', 'what', 'may', 'become', 'one', 'strangest', 'days', 'life', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'later', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'Focus', 'Features', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'know', 'opening', 'too', 'well', 'saw', 'film', 'four', 'times', 'big', 'screen', 'buying', 'DVD', 'other', 'day.The', 'genius', 'apparent', 'insanity', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'strikes', 'again', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'yet', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'fashion', 'ever', 'reaching', 'meanwhile', 'utterly', 'confusing', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'previous', 'stories', 'love', 'freedom', 'odd', 'occurrences', 'script', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'compromise', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lover', 'Kaufman', 'fanatic', 'alike.The', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'falls', 'love', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'argue', 'girl', 'boy', 'However', 'twist', 'case', 'Clementine', 'played', 'outstandingly', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'have', 'lover', 'Joel', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'erased', 'memory', 'forever', 'Yes', 'erased', 'Dr.', 'Howard', 'Mierzwiak', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'created', 'system', 'erase', 'memories', 'human', 'brain', 'effectively', 'eliminating', 'person', 'pet', 'one', 'mind', 'forever.Strange', 'enough', 'Kaufman', 'Not', 'quite.The', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'most', 'notably', 'screenwriter', 'anti-mainstream', 'tradition', 'montages', 'special', 'effects', 'trick', 'photography', 'superb', 'acting', 'intense', 'editing', 'enlightening', 'music', 'comic', 'yet', 'touching', 'story', 'told', 'love', 'Clementine', 'Joel', 'may', 'take', 'more', 'several', 'scenes', 'even', 'partially', 'comprehend', 'story', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'seemingly', 'random', 'roundabout', 'presentation', 'eventually', 'clear', 'contributor', 'emotionally', 'grounded', 'themes', 'film.Meanwhile', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'acting', 'talents', 'take', 'new', 'challenges', 'aptly', 'shoes', 'hard-headed', 'strangely', 'comedic', 'book', 'store', 'clerk', 'Clementine', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comic', 'impulses', 'step', 'aside', 'intense', 'quietly', 'dramatic', 'Joel', 'roles', 'so', 'different', 'previous', 'works', 'actors', 'create', 'entirely', 'new', 'entities', 'Prior', 'conceptions', 'dramatic', 'Winslet', 'hilarious', 'Carrey', 'dissipate', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'own', 'characters', 'other', 'more', 'alarming', 'Meanwhile', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'receptionist', 'acting', 'talent', 'character', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'multi-dimensional', 'player', 'including', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Wilkinson', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'given', 'opportunity', 'completely', 'open', 'screen', 'character', 'compassion.As', 'platform', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'direction', 'coupled', 'unique', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Brion', 'terrific', 'original', 'score', 'create', 'world', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'not', 'quite', 'real', 'not', 'quite', 'false', 'Gondry', 'grants', 'realistic', 'human', 'emotion', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'scene', 'however', 'visually', 'strange', 'may', 'be', 'cinematography', 'tendency', 'become', 'bit', 'documentary', 'effect', 'ultimately', 'sense', 'heightened', 'realism', 'necessary', 'counterbalance', 'plot', 'peculiarity.Beneath', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'direction', 'editing', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'emotional', 'core', 'are', 'moments', 'evoke', 'tears', 'moments', 'evoke', 'rounds', 'laughter', 'moments', 'evoke', 'deep', 'thought', 'film', 'speaks', 'not', 'only', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'human', 'soul', 'way', 'film', 'simply', 'what', 'viewer', 'it.I', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'one', 'hundred', 'times', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'watch', 'one', 'hundred', 'more', 'time', 'amazement', 'would', 'reach', 'greater', 'greater', 'heights']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

The largely polarized ""loved it-hated it"" reviews posted here prove once again that you either buy into Kaufman's somewhat myopic Woody Allen-on-crack worldview, or you don't. I will admit to being a bit of a fence-sitter in regards to Mr. Kaufman's work-I can appreciate his creativity and where he is coming from, but his films sometimes give me the uncomfortably creepy feeling that I am reading someone's private dream journal that was never intended for my prying eyes. Tom Wilkinson (""Full Monty"", ""In The Bedroom"") keeps a straight face as the doctor-scientist running Lacuna, Inc., a clinic specializing in ""erasing"" unpleasant memories (love affairs and other mental traumas) from client's minds, sort of a ""Total Recall"" in reverse. Jim Carrey plays a lovelorn depressive who decides to go through the process after learning that his ex (a complete kook played by a decidedly unglamorous Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. This silly, faux-sci-fi concept works mostly due to the earnest (albeit weird) performances from the cast. As unconventional as Kaufman's approach is, the movie surrenders to a somewhat predictable denoument that makes you feel like you've been led around the theater by your nose.

Two people are drawn to each other because there is something greater is at work, bringing lovers together. Fantastic idea, but it can be told in much simpler ways than done in this movie.

I wasn't quite as enthralled as she was, but I enjoyed it very much anyway.When the movie opens, Joel (Jim Carrey) impulsively skips work and goes to the shore, where he meets a blue-haired woman, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and they hit it off. But then strange things start happening.Turns out, Clementine has had boyfriend Joel erased from her mind. When he gets the letter from the memory-erasing clinic informing him of this, he decides to have her erased from his mind as well.The movie jumps back and forward in time, which can be a little disorienting, though I think that was the point. Oddly enough, the story flows well that way, as things learned in one scene impact the meaning of the next regardless of where they fit in the chronology, and the story is much more effective than if it had been told in strict chronological order.I suspect part of the difference between my daughter's ""best movie ever"" and my 4.5 stars is that I've read and watched a lot more science fiction than she has, and the concept of erasing memories isn't a new one for me. I did enjoy the details of the technique in this one, though I'd have liked to see it explored a little more thoroughly. For example, much was made of needing to find every single object connected with the person to be erased, but we never saw the consequences of missing something.I was surprised, though, that she liked the romance of the movie--she's usually pretty cynical about such things.

I was pleasantly shocked to see this movie get such rave reviews from so many people and that was a major factor in deciding to watch this film and I am not disappointed in the least.The casual observer would never think that Jim Carrey (known for his comedic skills) would be able to pull off a dramatic role but he did it (and then some) with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  I like the way he whispered throughout the film when a memory with Clementine came up.  It added depth to what was about to happen (""This was the last time I saw you"").I've always had great respect for Kate Winslet (I feel she was slighted for never receiving an Oscar for her role in ""Titanic"" and she was superb in ""Quills"") but watching this just made me respect her a little bit more.  She played flaky but introspective Clementine convincingly, drawing you into her character.The supporting cast was just as good.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with Kirsten Dunst but boy was I wrong.  I thought she was going to play an empty role and leave after a few scenes (scene candy) but what a twist the ending turned out to be (watch it to find out).  Mark Ruffalo was cute in his role as the assistant to the scientist behind the memory cleansing technique and who could have guessed the turn Patrick (Elijah Wood) would take?This is quite the proverbial cut above the rest.  I feel the way the film was edited added to the depth of the storyline.  The film's format was far from conventional (having the opening credits roll 18 minutes into the movie underscored that) - there was no spelling out of the plot nor was it too obvious, the twists at the end, for me, were a pleasant surprise (not a shocker that left you wondering ""Where did *that* come from?"") and the way the scenery would collapse as Joel's memories were erased was outstanding as well as the way he would convey his current feelings in the context of past events (""By morning you'll be gone.  The perfect ending to this piece of s*** story!"").There is only one word to describe ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"": BRILLIANT!

620105,A1IPFS2WVJ1XP8,B00005JMJG,Dorian Tenore-Bartilucci,"[6, 12]","If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's ""disappearing"" as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: ""Valentine's Day is our busiest time."" Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Hmm, maybe that's the point.Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible (for a film with ""SUNSHINE"" in the title, it often looks dull and dingy; maybe that's part of the joke?) that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. You get the feeling Gondry doesn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!",3,A Love Story As Only Charlie Kaufman in a Phildickian Mood Could

I expected it to be clever, interesting and fun. What I didn't expect was that it would turn out to be such a touching and poignant love story as well. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but he does very well here, going against type to play a subdued character who constantly refers to himself as ""not that interesting"". It's actually the luminous Kate Winslet (still radiantly gorgeous, even with blue hair) who plays the zany, unpredictable one, who Jim Carrey's character is drawn to, like a moth to a flame. The story has a slight sci-fi premise to it, with the two main characters trying to erase their memories of one another and their tumultuous relationship, but this film is really about love, relationships, fate and forgiveness. Aside from the love story involving the lead characters, there's also an interesting subplot involving the employees of the ""memory erasing"" agency, with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood all giving terrific supporting performances.

MIERZWIAK says ""TECHNICALLY SPEAKING - IT IS BRAIN DAMAGE"" - BUT ITS A SUPERB DRAMAJim Carrey does very well in this highly unusual drama. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk ""Special Edition"".MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, ""Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking."" The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.ABOUT THE DVD:The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new ""2-disk Special Edition"" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk ""Special Edition"" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGSMy daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time.

Have you ever wished that you could simply forget about it, so that you would no longer have to endure the pain?  Have you thought that life would be simpler & easier if you could move on without ever having to ""look back""?The present film takes that concept & runs with it.  The title is an allusion to Alexander Pope and it refers to the ""spotless mind"" of someone who has been ""wiped clean"" of painful memories of love.  Thanx to a new technology, it is at last possible to kiss goodbye your recall of the proverbial ""one that got away.""Of course, the $60,000 question is:  is this a good thing?  After all, our memories are part of our personality makeup;  they make us who we are.  This is true of both good & bad memories.  Is it not dangerous to try & be selective about what we remember?Such is the outline of the story that this movie addresses.  It ends up being a cross between a Drama and Romantic Comedy (it has some VERY funny scenes).Jim Carrey continues on his quest that he can do more than slapstick comedy, and he does a credible job.  This is a very different role for Kate Winslett.  Normally she portrays characters who are subdued & rational.  In this film, her character is flakey, impulsive and (somehow?) endearing.If you are in the market for a great date movie, this one is worth a look.

I am not a Jim Carrey but the premise of the film still intrigued me.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet plays a dysfunctional couple named Joel and Clementine. The couple are polar opposites from one another. Joel is more quiet and reserved while Clementine is more gregarious and unpredictable. These personality differences makes their relationship far from dull. After having a huge blow out with Joel, Clementine decides to have her memories of Joel erased courtesy of Howard (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistants played by Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Woods. When Joel finds out about what Clementine did, he decides to get the same procedure done on him. During the process of having his memories of Clementine erased (which is basically a lobotomy), Joel relizes that he still loves Clementine and does not want to forget her.I loved this film right from the first time I saw this film in the theatre but I really didn't get it until I viewed it a few more times on dvd. The way the film is edited is a bit confusing but the more I have watched it, the more the film makes sense. What I saw was a history of Joel and Clementine's rocky relationship. The performances was great. It was nice to see Jim Carrey actually tone down his comedic schtick and Kate Winslet take on a more comedic role. The writing and directingis just as good.

But he takes a slightly different turn in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" a sort of romantic dark comedy that raises questions about memory and identity. It may not be the best of Kaufman's work, but it's in some ways the most endearing.Uptight Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that his likably flaky ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has taken unusual measures, post-breakup. She's having her memories of him erased from her brain at Lacuna Inc. When he learns WHY she broke up with him (she thought he was boring), he gets mad and decides to have the same thing done to himself.So a group of offbeat techies and doctors (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) begin to erase the memories of Clementine from Joel's brain (Wood's character also tries to use Joel's memories to seduce Clementine). Problem is, his brain doesn't want to let them go. It pokes Clementine into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong, so he won't have to let go. And viewing the memories makes him fall in love all over again...""Dark romantic comedy"" is the closest thing that ""Eternal Sunshine"" has to a description. Like Kaufman's other films, it's funny in a subtle way, and more obviously sweet and romantic. Not to mention thought-provoking. If you could erase unpleasant memories, would you do it, if it changed the person you were? If we get rid of the pain, do we also get rid of the joy?Michel Gondry is best known for his work on Bjork, Radiohead and White Stripes music videos -- deliciously strange ones. Somehow, he fits perfectly into directing ""Eternal Sunshine."" A trip through a person's brain is a hard thing to manage, but he does it -- surreal little images like a teeny tiny Winslet and Carrey bathing in a kitchen sink, or lying on the ice. It's weird, and it works. At the same time, he can capture more mundane moments well.Jim Carrey gives what may be his best ""serious"" role ever, as the conflicted, lovelorn Joel. Kate Winslet's Clementine breaks the mold of ""romantic comedy heroine"" with her free-spirited wackiness. Together, they make a flawed couple that you really want to see together.

620116,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00005JMJG,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[20, 24]","In &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,&quot; Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a nebbishy and depressed man who has difficulty articulating his feelings.  Into his life comes Clementine Kruczynski, played charmingly by the versatile Kate Winslet. Unlike Joel, Clementine is free-spirited and impulsive.  Yet, somehow, the two connect and they enter into a relationship.  When she starts to tire of Joel, Clementine undergoes a procedure to erase him from her mind, and Joel, in turn, decides to erase Clementine from his mind.  Much to his dismay, Joel discovers that forgetting Clementine is much easier said than done.The inimitable Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay for &quot;Sunshine&quot; and it is a doozy.  The story is told out of sequence, and fantasies are intertwined with &quot;real&quot; events.  Much of the movie takes place in Jim Carrey's memory.  Michel Godry, the director, and Ellen Kuras, the cinematographer, lend a surrealistic and kaleidoscopic aura to this film that may leave viewers breathless and off-balance.All of the actors are fine, especially Tom Wilkinson as the seemingly staid doctor who makes a good living erasing memories, and Kirsten Dunst as his ditsy blonde nurse.  Ultimately, however, the movie belongs to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.  They beautifully portray two lonely and vulnerable people who take a big risk to find love.&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is an original, intriguing, and challenging experience.

620117,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00005JMJG,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[36, 58]","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is the new film from writer Charlie Kaufman. I have loved every one of his films-""Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Human Nature, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and now this. Out of all his films, I thought this one was the best. This was moving, funny, dramatic, and wildly inventive, all at the same time. It stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and they both could be contenders at the Oscars next year, seriously. The film is a work of genius, and it's constantly entertaining, and all of the scenes work. It is not  your average Jim Carrey movie like ""Bruce Almighty,"" and ""Liar, Liar."" Carrey proves once again that he could do more then physical comedy, and he already proved himself with ""The Majestic"" which I really liked.The movie is about Joel Barish. One day he decides to skip work and take a train out to the beach. On the return trip he meets Clementine Kruczynski. They both become attracted to each other and become a couple. They are exactly the opposite of each other, and this is proved when Clementine leaves and doesn't seem to know who Joel is. Joel finds out from his friends that Clementine has had him erased from her memory, and doesn't remember ever having a relationship with him. Joel finds out that she went to Lacuna, founded by Dr Howard Mierzwiak, and he decides to go check things out. Thinking that it is a hoax, he decides to have the procedure done to him, sort of as a revenge as well. Joel meets Stan who is doing the prodedure, Patrick who works at Lacuna, and is also dating Clementine, and Mary who is the receptionist at the office, who also has a crush on Howard. Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind, and his memories are deleted backwards. Joel goes through the most painful memories of his relationship first, and then the ones where him and Clementine had good times. He decides that he wants the procedure to stop, but the erasure team cannot hear him, so Joel and his memory of Clementine are forced to flee around Joel's mind and hide.Jim Carrey is giving his best preformance yet as Joel, and I also thought that Tom Wilkinson was great as the founder of Lacuna, but he always does great anyway. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a movie that I feel could be up for many Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Score, and Best Orignal Screenplay, just to name a few. This is one of the best films of the year, and also probally the most inventive. I give it five stars, and I plan on getting it when it comes out on DVD.

620118,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JMJG,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.The labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from Joel's plight.It helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with Dunst particularly affecting toward the end.The looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music. The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman, which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic Spree's ""Night and Day"" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna.",5,Kaufman Lends Surprising Humanism to an Exceptional Mind-Bending Story of Loss and Regret,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3044,"['Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'reality-bending', 'work', 'become', 'Hollywood', 'staple', 'becoming', 'more', 'distinctive', 'directors', 'who', 'give', 'life', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'solipsistic', 'scripts', 'give', 'dramatic', 'form', 'nebulous', 'psychological', 'states', 'border', 'horror', 'stories', 'Directed', 'Michel', 'Gondry', '2004', 'study', 'love', 'loss', 'exception', 'Kaufman', 'notion', 'struggling', 'relationship', 'manic', 'piece', 'science', 'fiction', 'involving', 'medical', 'procedure', 'scrub', 'one', 'memory', 'same', 'time', 'Gondry', 'Kaufman', 'have', 'injected', 'strong', 'dose', 'humanism', 'film', 'grounding', 'characters', 'are', 'relatable', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'quirky.The', 'labyrinth', 'plot', 'focuses', 'shy', 'taciturn', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'who', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'raucous', 'unstable', 'Clementine', 'Much', 'dismay', 'particularly', 'ugly', 'fight', 'Clementine', 'impulsively', 'decided', 'erase', 'memory', 'relationship', 'medical', 'company', 'called', 'Lacuna', 'headed', 'benevolent', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'renowned', 'leader', 'field', 'memory', 'erasure', 'Mierzwiak', 'heartbroken', 'Joel', 'same', 'procedure', 'Clementine', 'However', 'Joel', 'overcome', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'act', 'reciprocation', 'rebelling', 'deep', 'consciousness', 'treatment', 'regain', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'surreal', 'twists', 'occur', 'mind', 'viewer', 'not', 'way', 'Joel', 'plight.It', 'sturdy', 'cast', 'been', 'recruited', 'starting', 'surprisingly', 'subdued', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'depressed', 'Joel', 'easily', 'most', 'effective', 'attempt', 'straight', 'dramatic', 'role', 'even', 'Gondry', 'provide', 'flashes', 'manic', 'personality', 'when', 'appropriate', 'Displaying', 'trace', 'corseted', 'Britishness', 'bedraggled', 'free', 'spirit', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'right', 'level', 'abandon', 'natural', 'earthiness', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'usual', 'steady', 'self', 'somewhat', 'remorseful', 'Mierzwiak', 'spirited', 'trio', 'assistants', 'played', 'relish', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'three', 'are', 'fine', 'Dunst', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'end.The', 'looping', 'narrative', 'could', 'have', 'spiraled', 'control', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'stellar', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'Ellen', 'Kuras', 'production', 'designer', 'Dan', 'Leigh', 'editor', 'Valdis', 'Oskarsdottir', 'combining', 'bring', 'much-needed', 'fluidity', 'initially', 'incoherent', 'scenes', 'only', 'fly', 'ointment', 'Jon', 'Brion', 'overly', 'intrusive', 'music', '2004', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'best', 'consistently', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Gondry', 'Kaufman', 'explain', 'more', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'turns', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'standard', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'short', 'fifteen-minute', 'conversation', 'Gondry', 'Carrey', 'banal', 'Seven', 'minutes', 'understandably', 'excised', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'creative', 'music', 'video', 'Polyphonic', 'Spree', 'Night', 'Day', 'faux-commercial', 'Lacuna']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

The breakup of the protagonists cause both to eventually desire to lose their minds - or at least their memories - of their relationship by undergoing experimental memory erasure therapy.  Two elements occur to bring the viewer into some level of connectedness with the protagonists - first, the pain of breaking up is always best forgotten, but also that even the worst relationship, the worst memories generally had some redeeming quality in it.  To wish something never happened doesn't mean it didn't, and there is truly no way to erase our past, or fully forget about it.The actors stretch themselves from their traditional roles, and do a pretty fine job of it.

620124,A1XPIXEIB0QXCM,B00005JMJG,El Rey Lin,"[6, 15]","Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet put in great performances in uncharacteristic roles. Carrey skillfully plays a character that is not, for once, a hyperactive, face-contorting caricature, while Winslet's American accent is perfect, and her character's neurotic, willfully unconventional persona is compelling.I realize that a movie like this requires one to suspend disbelief and accept a premise that is obviously impossible. But I found the depiction of a memory-erasing clinic and the blithe insensitivity that its staff exhibited towards its clients too ridiculous to get past. Fine, we know that mind-erasing services for the heartbroken are something that could never happen in real life, but why make this even more implausible by having the clinic offer holiday specials in the manner of K-Mart and perform its services with such utter lack of care--things that would be quite unlikely if such services were possible? Yes, the director is trying to show us that the practitioners at the clinic are essentially cold-hearted and indifferent to the love that its hapless clients--and, ostensibly, the viewers of the movie--feel for those close to them. This recalls the Spielberg bomb, ""A.I."", where we're supposed to be indignant that a company could so callously market human-like robots like Barbie dolls while turning a blind eye to the robots' emotions and suffering.But in both cases, this attempted appeal to the audience's moral outrage falls flat. The films encourage us to righteously declare: ""*We* would never try to erase the precious memories of loved ones! *We* would never mistreat robots if they had human feelings!""

I am truly at a lost for words; I am awed by the utter brilliance of screenwriter Charlie Kauffman.  This man is a genius.  He understands love and expresses it in such a stunning and truthful way that I never thought possible onscreen.  Never before have I seen such an innovative, quirky, and truly touching film.  Not the kind of touching that leaves you bawling for hours afterwards in the ""Titanic"" tradition, but the kind that really sticks with you; the kind that hits a nerve and will have you thinking about it for months afterwards.With ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", both Jim Carrey and Charlie Kauffman prove something to us.  Carrey establishes himself without a doubt as a talented, versatile actor.  For awhile, I never though he'd move beyond slapstick comedies (think ""Ace Ventura), which he's good at, don't get me wrong, but this man has such an interesting soul and such profound emotional depth that never really had a chance to shine through until now (we caught a glimpse of it in the enjoyable ""The Majestic"").  I hope that now that Carrey has proved himself more dramatic roles will be offered to him.  He is capable of much more than we originally believed!Two of my favorite quotations (my favorite is above).

620127,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005JMJG,Erica Anderson,"[0, 0]","I just saw ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (...). It is one of the films that I was dying to see. I am by no means a fan of most of Jim Carrey's films but ""Eternal Sunshine..."" really appealed to me when I read about it in a recent issue of IFC magazine as well as saw a trailer for it. I was intrigued by the concept of having the opportunity to erase painful memories and start over with a clean slate.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Paul and Clementine, a couple who are in a volatile relationship. Paul is the straight guy to Clementine's unpredictable, impulsive nature. They are complete opposites. Nevertheless the pair manages to connect on an emotional level. Unfortunately the camel's back breaks and on an impulse, Clementine decides to start over on a clean slate and forget about Paul by having a memory specialist played by the talented Tom Wilkinson, erase her memories. Paul is devasted when he finds out what Clementine does so he follows suit. What happens next is a chain reaction. I got to see Paul and Clementine's relationship, the good, the bad, and the ugly through Paul's eyes. The lesson here is that we should be careful of what we wish for because it might actually happened. In Paul's case, he realized that having his memories of Clementine erased was not a hot idea. Another lesson here is learning to appreciate life and Paul figures that out just as his memories are being slowly deleted. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline between Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. I really wasn't expecting their personal involvement with each other or with Clementine. It was enjoyable enough not to detract from the main storyline of the movie.I will admit that I have never seen ADAPTATION or the entire BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (well some I have seen on Comedy Central) but ETERNAL SUNSHINE...reminded me a bit of 21 GRAMS in the way the film was shot. I really didn't understand the opening sequence to the film until towards the end of the movie. And at one point, I was confused about the way Paul and Clementine first met. I thoroughly enjoyed ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.

620128,A146D2LYLICNLS,B00005JMJG,eric_f,"[3, 4]","It's a well-known fact that most movies these days work by spoon-feeding us the plot, characters and story, not asking us to think about what's going on but rather, simply to entertain us. We enjoy the film and then walk out of the theater going home being thankful that we had the chance to escape reality for a couple of hours. But every once in a while there comes along a movie that asks a little more of us. A movie that asks us to think about what we just saw, what it all meant, and how we can relate to it. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is the perfect example of such a movie. It's been a long time since a movie as original and thought-provoking like this has come along.The plot is rather simple: Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a process that erased their life together from her mind. Both curious as well as desperate to undergo the same process, Joel seeks out the inventor (Tom Wilkinson) of this memory-erasing device and undergoes the same procedure. But as his memories of Clementine begin to dwindle away, Joel realizes the mistake he and Clementine have made, because what they had together was special.Having this plot as its foundation, this movie could have easily been just another run-of-the-mill ""romantic comedy"" filled with cliched laughs and turn of events. However, it's nothing you would ever expect. There really is no way to describe how ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" plays out. One just has to experience it for themselves. One thing is true though: this is not a movie for those with a low attention span, or those who can't appreciate a film that diverges from the formulatic blueprint. I'll admit that I couldn't make sense of the whole thing upon my first viewing. So for most people, this movie will take multiple viewings to fully grasp. But the payoff is worth it, believe me. It's not about the destination, but the journey getting there.I can't end this review without praising Jim Carrey's performance. This is hands-down his best acting in his career, proving that he's capable of being much more than the rubber-faced, over-the-top screwball character. I hope he makes more movies in the future that allow his true talent to shine. But Jim Carrey isn't the only one who gives a great performance. I was equally impressed with Kate Winslet, who's very charming and likeable as Clementine. She and Carrey have great chemistry together. Who would have thought?I'll end by saying that ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a movie not to be missed, offering something truly special that most movies out there don't have the courage to do. It's a unique type of love story that's a reminder of what's most important in our lives, and that we shouldn't let a good thing go if we have it, despite its imperfections. I've rarely been as moved, entertained and touched as I was by this movie.

When he performed in Good Will Hunting and One Hour Photo, it's almost fascinating to see someone like him in a drastically different environment. This is a fair indication that actors can do more than just the same role that they've been playing their entire lifetime. Jim Carrey succeeded in doing that as well with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.The movie is all about a man who wants to remove the memory of his former girlfriend, but during the process, he is having second thoughts because of all the fun times the two of them shared. Carrey fans are advised: this is NOT a slapstick comedy. This is a very imaginative and very spellbinding romantic comedy/drama. Director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman have created a marvel. It's an almost surreal experience due to the fantastical images and unorthodox storytelling. The entire cast give splendid performances. The chemistry between Carrey and Kate Winslet's character is almost spot-on: realistic, to be more precise.I can see why this movie has garnered a cult following.

620132,A2E0CB9F9BMXUJ,B00005JMJG,"Eugene Wei ""eugene""","[5, 5]","Let's review the roster of mad geniuses involved. I didn't love Adaptation or Being John Malkovich, but they left no doubt that Charlie Kaufman was the most creative and inimitable screenwriter in Hollywood. Michel Gondry has long been a cult favorite for his hip music videos, and though his first feature film Human Nature was very rough around the edges, some of it glittered with promise. For a few years, Jim Carrey was one of the few actors breathing life into movies. Kate Winslet is extremely gifted and brave, and Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Kirsten Dunst are too skilled to be considered character actors. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is what happens when all of these all-stars team up and hit their peaks at the same time.Kaufman's concept is ingenious: Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his former girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to have her memories of their tempestuous relationship erased. Wilkinson, Dunst, Wood, and Ruffalo are the staff at Lacuna Inc., the agency offering the service which Wilkinson describes as a type of brain damage ""on a par with a night of heavy drinking."" Heartbroken himself, Joel decides to undergo the same procedure. But if one has all the painful times erased, what is left but love? Trapped inside his own memories, Joel begins to have second thoughts. Can he salvage some of the happiest memories? And if he can't, will fate still bring the two of them together, or is the idea of a soul mate just a function of chance? This is a thinking person's romantic comedy.Gondry's visualization matches Kaufman's concept in wacky originality. As memories are wiped, they begin to overlap, and Gondry represents this with set pieces and characters that begin to meld and overlap in ways that will leave you grinning with pleasure. What do our memories look like if shown as a movie? Dali-esque, if Gondry is to be believed, complete with melting faces. The handheld shots and grainy photography lend the movie a dynamic, organic energy.

620135,A2YDTAOREY8X0,B00005JMJG,ferretk4,"[17, 18]","If you've seen the trailer, you know the plot: Jim Carrey's Lowell discovers that his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet's Clementine) has had all memories of him erased by a company called Lacuna, Inc.  So Lowell decides to get all of his memories of her erased, too.  Then, during the procedure, he changes his mind and tries to save her from within literally vanishing memories.This is not the whole plot, but it is enough to get by on--and saying anymore would give away too much: the movie is kingly in its execution of plot twists.Other characters worth noting are the doctor who erases Lowell's memories, and his girlfriend Mary; and Patrick (Elijah Wood), who helps the doctor and gets himself rather thickly embroiled in another part of the plot as well; and the head of Lacuna Inc, who is definitely not the guy he appears to be.Obviously, this film has an unusual premise.  In fact, the entire film is unusual--and deliciously wonderful.  Most of it takes place within Lowell's head, within warped memories in which fences and people vanish and people who don't belong appear; and oftentimes the settings change as swiftly and with as little fuss as scenery often does in our dreams.  Yet it never becomes confusing and certainly never ridiculous: the movie sucks you in and the unreality of much of it seems oddly realistic, probably because it is the sort of unreality that we find in our heads and that we endure nearly every night when we dream.  You don't even notice that the movie is particularly surreal: it feels far more realistic than your average romantic comedy or action movie, certainly!Much of this film is not surreal in any way.  We get many glimpses of Lowell's memories--obviously--and they are amazingly engaging, running the gamut of emotional extremes and not-so-extremes in Lowell and Clementine's relationship.All of them actors and actresses do a marvelous job.  Jim Carrey is especially wonderful; Elijah Wood, though with a fairly minor part, has one of the best entrances I have ever seen in a film.  Kate Winslet's Clementine catches you off-balance when you realize how much you believe in her, with all her strangeness.This is one of the most creative movies I have seen in a while.  I worry about using words like ""creative"" and ""surreal"" in this review: they are accurate, but they arouse the wrong connotations.  One hardly has to be a fan of abstract art to enjoy this film!  Indeed, it should appeal to a wide range of audience types--it could be anything from a romantic comedy to an ""arty"" film to whatever you call poignant, realistic movies.  It lets you do detective work, handing you clues subtly and without giving the best trick away until the end--but if you don't enjoy putting two and two together at the cinema, you aren't required to either.This film is practically impossible to describe.  If you find the trailer (go to the Focus Features website), that will give you a fairly good taste of it.  But really good films should not be overly described, and I would hate to give away any of Eternal Sunshine's tricks.  So forget descriptions: just go see it.

Carey is noexception to that (Sandler did this with Punch DrunkLove) with this movie, and it does fantastic despiteits indie qualities.  It's great that a good movie canbe truly appreciated by the majority of society atleast some of the time.  This movie is also Winslet'sbreakthrough to show the world that she can and likesto do movies that aren't necessarily as sappy like asTitanic.  She does not disappoint on this one as youmay notice how quickly she has to change in charactersometimes as hers in one that can be very moody, andMark Ruffalo is also a stand out.  Dr. Mierzwiak'swife is not even listed on imdb, but she was excellentfor her extremely small role.  All the actors weregreat, but the ones mentioned were the ones that stuckout for me the most.What makes this film so great is of course, not somuch its popularity necessarily, but all the nuancesyou do and don't notice, and the way it was created.There were some prop setups for a scene in which JoelBarish (Carey) looks like a small toddler with hisadult face, but Clementine (Kate Winslet) looks normalto the scene.  What's really weird is that since Careywas doing this scene with overly sized props, whenClementine was under the table with Joel, it seemed asif the proportions still kept nicely, and maybe thatis because of some visual effect which occurs whenJoel is back further from the camera and more crouchedup.Dunst was not a big fan of improvising on this movie,and I think it was mentioned in the commentary that itwas a bit hard for her working with Ruffalo and Wood.This actually fit in with her character in the storymore though, so it worked out!There is also snow on the beach in a scene, and I donot know of another movie with that feature in it.Other nuances to notice is the crack that is on theice pond when Carey and Winslet are lying on the iceof the pond.  There's a shot of the Barnum and Baileycircus, and that was pretty much a one time deal whereCarey and Winslet were rushing to the scene(s) at thelast minute to capture that interesting piece offootage.There are also some visual effects which you may ormay not notice throughout the movie.  There is slightsmoke used several scenes to make some of the scenesseem more dreamy, and if you aren't really looking, oreven if you are, you may not notice.  The effects withthe lighting really come out when things aredisappearing.  There's also a stream of lights at theice pond scene, and it looks like it's just a carouselof lights flying by, but when you hear from thecommentary that it's a highway, you realize that it'sactually a bunch of cars driving by.  Another coolthing about this movie is that there is a bed car thatCarey rides on.  During the set, they were having somuch trouble with the car that the brakes didn't workat one point, and Carey actually had to drive the bedcar out onto the highway and let its gas run out.People passing by must've been quite appalled to saythe least!

Frustrated by the idea of still being in love with a woman who doesn't remember their time together, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine. The film, which takes place mostly within Joel's mind, follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced, and the procedure then goes on to the previous one, which is likewise seen, and then erased. Once the process starts, however, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine and that their love was real, so he starts smuggling her away into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong which alters other things about his memories as well, Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) however chase him through the maze of his memories, leading Joel to take desperate measures, hiding Clementine in obsolete, long forgotten childhood memories, some of which  are embarrassing moments. Interestingly enough however the beginning of the film loops back at the end as surprises galore end up affecting all the characters, some good, some bad.The main theme is basically that of accepting faults in one another and giving love a chance. Realizing our own faults in a relationship and adjusting compromises in order for it to work is a key component of successful couples. We all have things we'd like to forget, but what would be the point, we learn from our mistakes and experience the good and the bad otherwise we would simply repeat the process, getting heartbroken again and again.The directing is excellent; nearly all special effects in the memory scenes were created using special camera and lighting effects, the movie itself is in a moderately shaky camera, with a cold New York winter setting adding to the mood.The soundtrack is great, made by Jon Brion, the main song being Polyphonic Spree's ""Light and Day"" also featured are The Willowz, and Don Nelson. Jim Carry provides a decent not so comedic performance, but the real star is Kate Winslet, who perfectly pulls off the quirky, multi colored hair, Clementine. Nominated for several Golden Globes, this movie attracted many critics' reviews and was featured at the Sundance festival last year.A beautifully crafted romantic comedy that's not your typical romantic comedy, with a sense of sadness about it, this movie will satisfy and fascinate nearly all who watch this.",5,About on par with a night of heavy drinking,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,3173,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'few', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'once', 'while', 'represent', 'truly', 'unique', 'original', 'idea', 'remake', 'sequel', 'going', 'accomplish', 'when', 'writing', 'credits', 'are', 'attributed', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'genius', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'now', 'have', 'talent', 'ideal', 'creating', 'movie', 'warmth', 'comedy', 'ingenious', 'plot.This', 'story', 'guy', 'Joel', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'long-time', 'girlfriend', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'undergone', 'psychiatrist', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'experimental', 'procedure', 'memory', 'Joel', 'removed', 'couple', 'tried', 'years', 'get', 'relationship', 'working', 'fluidly', 'Frustrated', 'idea', 'still', 'being', 'love', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'together', 'Joel', 'undergo', 'procedure', 'as', 'well', 'erase', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'film', 'place', 'mostly', 'Joel', 'mind', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'backwards', 'time', 'recent', 'memory', 'replaced', 'procedure', 'then', 'previous', 'one', 'likewise', 'seen', 'then', 'erased', 'process', 'however', 'Joel', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'forget', 'Clementine', 'love', 'was', 'real', 'smuggling', 'away', 'parts', 'memory', 'where', ""n't"", 'belong', 'other', 'things', 'memories', 'as', 'well', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'crew', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'however', 'chase', 'maze', 'memories', 'leading', 'Joel', 'take', 'desperate', 'measures', 'hiding', 'Clementine', 'obsolete', 'long', 'forgotten', 'childhood', 'memories', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'however', 'beginning', 'film', 'back', 'end', 'surprises', 'galore', 'end', 'up', 'affecting', 'characters', 'good', 'bad.The', 'main', 'theme', 'basically', 'accepting', 'faults', 'one', 'giving', 'love', 'chance', 'Realizing', 'own', 'faults', 'relationship', 'adjusting', 'compromises', 'order', 'work', 'key', 'component', 'successful', 'couples', 'have', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'forget', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'experience', 'good', 'bad', 'otherwise', 'would', 'simply', 'repeat', 'process', 'getting', 'heartbroken', 'again', 'again.The', 'directing', 'excellent', 'nearly', 'special', 'effects', 'memory', 'scenes', 'were', 'created', 'using', 'special', 'camera', 'lighting', 'effects', 'movie', 'moderately', 'shaky', 'camera', 'cold', 'New', 'York', 'winter', 'setting', 'adding', 'mood.The', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'made', 'Jon', 'Brion', 'main', 'song', 'being', 'Polyphonic', 'Spree', 'Light', 'Day', 'also', 'featured', 'are', 'Willowz', 'Don', 'Nelson', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'decent', 'not', 'so', 'comedic', 'performance', 'real', 'star', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'perfectly', 'quirky', 'multi', 'colored', 'hair', 'Clementine', 'Nominated', 'several', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'movie', 'attracted', 'many', 'critics', 'reviews', 'was', 'featured', 'Sundance', 'festival', 'last', 'year.A', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sense', 'sadness', 'movie', 'will', 'satisfy', 'fascinate', 'nearly', 'who', 'watch']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did - I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt - I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through - for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. ""Being John Malkovich"" amused me; ""Adaptation"" irritated me - too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. ""Eternal Sunshine..."" is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us - to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst.

Almost, I say. He is a masterful actor, and he plays the sad sack Joel as plausibly as anyone could. But whatever slouch he adopts, whatever stubble covers his chin, he's still The Grinch, Loki, Truman, and above all Ace! Ventura! At some fundamental level of thespian craft, he fails. He needs the help of Dr. Mierzwiak to erase MY memories of his previous roles.Kate Winslet has no such handicap. It never occurred to me to remember her in any other role. In this film, in the role of the 'impetuous' Clementine, she's every man's worst memory. If I'd survived hooking up with Clementine in my flaming youth, I'd pay to have the memory erased also. But this is a film about Recurrence - endless cycles of predestined Recurrence! - a Kosmic Kharma Komedy. ""In this whole world / you can love but one girl / let me be that one girl / I'll be true to you"", as the Shirelles sang when I was a teenager, with the implication that 'not only will you never be able to forget me after I dump you but you'll always always find another me.' In other words, this film is more a tragedy than a comedy, a coy examination of how vulnerable we humans are to our own psyches. No, amigos, that is NOT a happy ending.But there's also a meta-message in the film: we are what we remember. Tampering with the brain, with memory, is risky business, a Dr Frankenstein trick. ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a sort of science fiction film. Plausibility isn't relevant. We the audience are supposed to think deeply about its implications. That might be where the film falls short; it's too zany for its concept to be taken seriously. All the flashbooks to memories being expunged, while Joel is unconscious, clash too bizarrely to stimulate much empathy. Joel at half size, hiding under his Mommy's kitchen table, is .... wait! He's ... Ace Ventura Pet Detective!I skipped this film when it was first run. Who remembers why? But I had to see it now, after watching the film ""Synecdoche New York"" by the same screen-writer Charlie Kaufman. Frankly, ""Eternal Sunshine"" seems like a practice piece, a warm-up for the powerful expressiveness of ""Synecdoche"".My wife watched ""Eternal Sunshine"" with me.

620145,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00005JMJG,Glen Engel Cox,"[4, 6]","Many people mistake science fiction for spaceships and blasters, so when a science fiction movie comes around that doesn't contain either, like Gattaca or Brazil, critics describe the movie instead as surreal. While that adjective may justly describe those movies, it's poor payment for that science fiction tradition that celebrates ideas over action.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a science fiction movie. Given one unreal but scientifically plausible idea (that one could erase memories), the rest of the movie is logical and internally consistent. Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) is an awkward and lonely New York salaryman who, on a typical commute, decides suddenly to call in sick and heads to the beach at Montauk, even though it's February. The cold weather and deserted beach match his mood, but something draws him to a girl in an old orange sweater. On the train back, she takes the initiative and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslet). The suddenness of it all is both shocking and exhilarating for Joel, but nothing compared to the shock he's about to get when Clem returns from her apartment with her toothbrush and mail.I hesitate to share any more of the plot, because in a story of ideas, the plot serves as the antagonist by exploiting the ramifications of the idea (if so, then...). That basic idea is that there is a company that offers the ability to erase memories, amiably staffed by efficient receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst), inventor/doctor Howard (Tom Wilkinson), and somewhat nerdy technician Patrick (Elijah Wood). Add to the plot mix a tumultate relationship between Joel and Clementine and a very impetuate action by her, then let the rest of the movie play out.I'd somewhat given up looking for this type of story from a movie, as it seemed the movies had followed the science fiction novel industry in emphasizing action over thought SF short stories, which do not support their authors, seemed to have been the last bastion for this type of story. Perhaps because special effects have become cheaper over the years, smaller independent films like this have a niche. I look forward to seeing if that proves true. I also look forward to seeing what screenwriter Charles Kaufman does next.

Charlie Kaufmann has again come up with a very original and intellectual script based on the inner workings of the mind.  The loops and circles of the story are wonderfully constructed and laid out in such a way to allow a very mysterious plot, and yet is not completly confusing.  Michael Gondry did an amazing job of directing this film, taking a very challenging script that could easily have been botched into a muddy mismash of confusion.  Instead, he weaves it together brilliantly, using fascinating effects, subtle visuals that allow new things to be discovered through every viewing, and symbolism that will keep your mind chewing for days.Jim Carrey has succesfully proven that he is more than just a comical genius.  His portrayal of Joel Barish is very human and consistently believable and heartfelt.  He has finally been able to play a dramatic character and completely leave out any hints of his outrageous comic characters.  For him, I believe this is a spectacular performance.This is a very well constructed, thought-provoking science fiction movie that harkens back to the original concepts of Sci-Fi.

Kaufman has the ability to take a tiny thought/idea and trace it through the minds of his characters much like the way synapses propel sensory input.  And in doing so he provides more intelligent insights about personality variations and relationships and the vulnerability and neediness of contemporary man than just about any person writing scripts today.  This is 21st Century existentialism delivered in the most cogent manner.But the story would be only half told were it not for director Michel Gondry and his enormously gifted cast of characters:  Jim Carrey finally demonstrates his innate thespian gifts with the role of Joel, a laid back, fearful, needy cookie-cutter piece of a man who finally finds someone who loves him in goofy Clementine (the always superb Kate Winslet) only to have the 'business' of memory erasing (run by Dr. Miarzwiak - Tom Wilkinson - assisted by his technicians Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) destroy his new found happiness and drive him to the same extreme that drove Clementine to have their memories of each other erased.  Despite the apparent linear storyline this film begins to act like the confusion of electrical stimuli to brain cells and for the remainder of the the movie we are not sure how the idea is playing out until the magic ending which is so fine that it should be withheld from those who have not experienced this film.

620152,A1QFH9H4VN0QJ5,B00005JMJG,"""hammershu""","[5, 8]","Eternal Sunshine is a complete bizarre trip.  Unlike most Hollywood movies, this film requires you to bring your brain in with you and not leave it at the front door.  Director Michel Gondry has delivered an intense emotionally draining film that falls nothing short of brilliant.Jim Carrey stars as Joel, a lonely quiet man who ponders through life with little hope or desire.  This all changes when he meets a crazy up-beat woman named Clementine, played by Kate Winslet.  Joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend has had the memories of their tumultuous relationship erased.  Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory.  But as Joel's memories begin to disappear one by one he begins to realize the fantastic times they had together.  Joel then attempts to escape the procedure from deep within the recesses of his brain while Dr. Howard and his associates, (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), chase him through this maze.Completely original, Eternal Sunshine will have you watching, questioning, and absorbing all its film aspects while intrigued by its stimulating story.  Jim Carrey gives one of his best, if not the best, performance of his career.  Kate Winslet is equally convincing as the out-going girlfriend Clementine, who is wild and all over the place.  It's almost as if the two characters were written for the wrong person.  Ms. Winslet's Clementine has the zany attributes that are perfect for Mr. Carrey's style and wit.  Vice-versa for Mr. Carrey's character toward Ms. Winslet.  But what we are witnessing here are two actors who give performances that are not the norm for them and the result is phenomenal.This film is a joy to watch.  Beautiful cinematography is shown throughout the entire film.  The elephant parade scene is a dazzling marvel to observe.  I was reminded of the intriguing cinematography used in the cities of Japan from Lost in Translation.  They were both shot without tripods, both real and full of eye candy.  The music is perfect as it captures the anomalous tone the film gives.  Jon Brion is slowly getting fame as one of the great film composers of our time.  You may remember his other quirky and offbeat music sufficiently used in the extraordinary ""Punch-Drunk Love.""  I found myself almost in tears at just how gorgeous some of the scenes are with the music.  In one scene, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are sitting in a room when all the sudden rain pours in flooding the entire room.  They began to smile and playfully flirt with one another in a way true lovers do while Mr. Brion adds a touching delicate piano playing in the background.  There are many scenes like this that touches the viewer and enables them to grasp and understand the true love and chemistry these characters have for each other even though they are complete opposites.The extremely talented Charlie Kaufman writes the screenplay.  Mr. Kaufman has written other strange but compelling scripts for the movies ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation.""  It boggles me to understand where and how he comes up with these uncommon but astonishing stories.  We are seeing a genius at work, providing us with stories we wouldn't normally see or think of with a script that gives lines that can be well executed by its actors and actresses.Unlike ""Adaptation"" or ""Being John Malkovich"", Spike Jonze does not direct this move.  Director Michael Gondry gives another try after working with Mr. Kaufman on the not-so successful ""Human Nature.""  Mr. Gondry has proved successful this time as he allows his actors and actresses to be unique and abnormal while staying true and real at the same time.If there was one thing I did not like about this film, it would have to be the ending.  I was so disappointed that after watching a film that seemed to want to break all standard forms of a Hollywood movie would succumb to a Hollywood ending.  But don't let this confuse you.  I loved this movie and if I had to pick a flaw that would be it.This is a strong film with a peculiar theme that asks us to question if what we consider the right thing to do to help others is really helpful indeed?  Dr. Mierzwiak creates a system to help others by erasing painful memories from their brains.  But is this really helping people?  Later in the film, Kirsten Dunst's character makes a decision in trying to help fellow patients that proves just to add more problems.  What we consider helpful may be disastrous to others.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a must-see for anyone dieing to see a film that is challenging and completely different from the norm of most movies.  Finally, a film that ironically is about the human brain while at the same time requiring the viewer to use his or her brain in the process.",5,Clearing the Mind...,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,4843,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'complete', 'bizarre', 'trip', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'film', 'bring', 'brain', 'not', 'leave', 'front', 'door', 'Director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'delivered', 'intense', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'lonely', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'little', 'hope', 'desire', 'changes', 'when', 'crazy', 'up-beat', 'woman', 'named', 'Clementine', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Joel', 'stunned', 'discover', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'memories', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'erased', 'desperation', 'inventor', 'process', 'Dr.', 'Howard', 'Mierzwiak', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'have', 'Clementine', 'removed', 'own', 'memory', 'Joel', 'memories', 'begin', 'disappear', 'one', 'one', 'realize', 'fantastic', 'times', 'had', 'together', 'Joel', 'then', 'escape', 'procedure', 'deep', 'recesses', 'brain', 'Dr.', 'Howard', 'associates', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'chase', 'maze.Completely', 'original', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'will', 'have', 'watching', 'questioning', 'absorbing', 'film', 'aspects', 'intrigued', 'stimulating', 'story', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'equally', 'convincing', 'out-going', 'girlfriend', 'Clementine', 'who', 'wild', 'place', 'almost', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'wrong', 'person', 'Ms.', 'Winslet', 'Clementine', 'zany', 'are', 'perfect', 'Mr.', 'Carrey', 'style', 'wit', 'Vice-versa', 'Mr.', 'Carrey', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Winslet', 'what', 'are', 'witnessing', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'give', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'norm', 'result', 'phenomenal.This', 'film', 'joy', 'watch', 'Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'shown', 'entire', 'film', 'elephant', 'parade', 'scene', 'dazzling', 'marvel', 'observe', 'was', 'reminded', 'intriguing', 'cinematography', 'used', 'cities', 'Japan', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'were', 'shot', 'tripods', 'real', 'full', 'eye', 'candy', 'music', 'perfect', 'anomalous', 'tone', 'film', 'Jon', 'Brion', 'slowly', 'getting', 'fame', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'composers', 'time', 'may', 'remember', 'other', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'music', 'sufficiently', 'used', 'extraordinary', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'found', 'almost', 'tears', 'just', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'are', 'music', 'one', 'scene', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'sitting', 'room', 'when', 'sudden', 'rain', 'pours', 'flooding', 'entire', 'room', 'began', 'smile', 'playfully', 'flirt', 'one', 'way', 'true', 'lovers', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Brion', 'touching', 'delicate', 'piano', 'playing', 'background', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'grasp', 'understand', 'true', 'love', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'have', 'other', 'even', 'are', 'complete', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'screenplay', 'Mr.', 'Kaufman', 'written', 'other', 'strange', 'compelling', 'scripts', 'movies', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'understand', 'where', 'how', 'up', 'uncommon', 'astonishing', 'stories', 'are', 'seeing', 'genius', 'work', 'providing', 'stories', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'see', 'think', 'script', 'lines', 'can', 'be', 'well', 'executed', 'actors', 'actresses.Unlike', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'not', 'direct', 'move', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'try', 'working', 'Mr.', 'Kaufman', 'not-so', 'successful', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Mr.', 'Gondry', 'proved', 'successful', 'time', 'actors', 'actresses', 'be', 'unique', 'abnormal', 'staying', 'true', 'real', 'same', 'time.If', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'film', 'seemed', 'want', 'break', 'standard', 'forms', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'would', 'succumb', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'confuse', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'pick', 'flaw', 'would', 'be', 'it.This', 'strong', 'film', 'peculiar', 'theme', 'question', 'what', 'consider', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'help', 'others', 'really', 'helpful', 'indeed', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'system', 'help', 'others', 'erasing', 'painful', 'memories', 'brains', 'really', 'helping', 'people', 'Later', 'film', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'character', 'decision', 'trying', 'help', 'fellow', 'patients', 'just', 'add', 'more', 'problems', 'What', 'consider', 'helpful', 'may', 'be', 'disastrous', 'others.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'dieing', 'see', 'film', 'challenging', 'completely', 'different', 'norm', 'most', 'movies', 'Finally', 'film', 'ironically', 'human', 'brain', 'same', 'time', 'requiring', 'viewer', 'use', 'brain', 'process']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620155,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00005JMJG,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD Review2 Disc Collector's Edition (2004)This is an almost a perfect movie for me.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was directed by Michel Gondry who also wrote it along with Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth. I want to live in this man's head for a day, his brilliance and creativity and ingenuity with limited resources was inspiring and gripping to say the least. This is a different kind of love story, beginning at the end and ending at the beginning. Joel played by Jim Carrey and Clementine played by Kate Winslet are a couple who have had their ups and downs like anyone else. During this latest down, Joel goes to a specialist to have his memories of Clementine erased after he finds out she did the same for him. As he drifts though the memories, he finds he doesn't want to forget because he still loves her.Jim Carrey took a turn for the dramatic here. One of his first scenes is really balling his eyes out in the car in utter anguish. It hits you right in the gut when you realize you can empathize with that emotion of being at bottom and that this normally comedic actor strikes right to your core. This character is so different from his other roles. He's shy, awkward, inhibited for once, angry, and heart-broken.Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses. Her Clementine is real, quirky, charismatic, impulsive, and moody. She is the outgoing one instead of Jim Carrey and carries many of the comedic moments. Her unique rainbow of hair colors really displays her personality to the world.Meanwhile, Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, inventor of the process of erasing memories. His employees include his receptionist, Mary played by Kirsten Dunst who admires him and secretly loves him, field worker Stan played by Mark Ruffalo who is in love with Mary and has a relationship with her, and another field worker, Patrick played by Elijiah Wood. Elijiah Wood plays an uncharacteristically creepy role here (this was before Sin City, mind you) who falls in love with Clementine during the memory erasure and uses Joel's memories to woe her. It's a very complicated layering of love triangles and while the storyline of the memory clinic workers is linear, the story of Joel and Clementine is backward through Joel's eyes.It's amazing how memories of a person are just moments in time that you experience with them, good or bad and they can be very random or very special. Since it's all within the mind, there's a lot of jumping around and fuzziness, especially as Joel tries to find ways to outwit the process. It's also one of those movies where you actually notice how good the music is, I got the soundtrack afterward. The love themes and the ""Elephant Parade"" track are especially moving. This movie will stick with you emotionally, the last scenes always bring tears to my eyes. It also takes you on a thrill ride that will open up your mind and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if he will succeed.DVD Extras:There is director & writer commentary and there are conversations with the director alone, with Jim Carrey, and with Kate Winslet as they dissect characters and talk about how certain effects were done. It's amazing how simple some things were and how many ideas the director had, many that never even were used! One example is during one memory of an argument with Clementine, Joel is walking away and she becomes blurry while he does not. There were a pair of grips walking behind with a frosted glass pane to achieve the effect. In another scene, Clementine is leaving the apartment and she goes into one room and then appears in another and then appears by the front door. This was achieved with trapdoors and at the last second, a body double! Very smart, very simple. In one scene taken in one shot, Jim Carrey had to play Joel in the doorway and then Joel sitting in a chair in the room so he kept running behind the camera and putting his hat on and off till they got it. Some deleted scenes show more dreamy out-of-sequence events and odd situations with Clementine and Joel trying to evade the memory erasers. They give just a little more activity for the characters and illustrate the genius of the director. A Polyphonic Spree Music video is on Disc 1 and you'll either love it or hate it. It's a very sunny song that will make you jump around the room or groan in disgust depending on your frame of mind. I really enjoyed the Lacuna Commercial also on Disc 1 showing how the memory erasing could be advertised by the company, it's pretty amusing and disturbing at the same time. One of my favorite bits would be the Anatomy of a Scene bonus feature on Disc 2 where they take the major fight scene where cars and things are falling from the sky in the memory and breakdown how it was done in layers, how things were added, until the final product developed. One last thing, this DVD comes with a Souvenir booklet that mainly has quotes from critics about how special and unique they felt the movie was along with many production still photos.",5,Blessed are

If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk ""Special Edition"".MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, ""Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking."" The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.ABOUT THE DVD:The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new ""2-disk Special Edition"" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk ""Special Edition"" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGSMy daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time. See what you think!",5,"DR.

Both Adaptation and Being John Malkovich got a lot of hype and praise at the theater. For some reason this one slipped by quietly without drawing much attention. I say this because I feel like this is by far his best film.  For me it was a prime example of art taking on it's own life. It is a love story that is both sad and beautiful at the same time. Most of the plot invovles a world of memories and the processis of the higher psyche. I personally, have never seen a film that I felt was so in tune with human feelings and the subconcious. Somehow Charlie Kaufman captures those private feelings and experiences that you have and hold inside of you during a relationship and puts them on a screen in a way that is both touching and sad. Hands down one of the most remarkable scripts I've ever seen. Also, I feel like I have to write a blurb about Jim Carrery because in this particular film he really won me over. I have to admit I'm not what  you'd call a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler guy. I don't know why but their films do more to annoy me than entertain. I will say this though he proved to me in this film that he is a damn fine actor and the character he played was both very convincing and incredibley likeable.",5,Blown away,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1320,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'have', 'been', 'thouroughly', 'impressed', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'got', 'lot', 'hype', 'praise', 'theater', 'reason', 'one', 'slipped', 'quietly', 'drawing', 'much', 'attention', 'say', 'feel', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'prime', 'example', 'art', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'love', 'story', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'Most', 'plot', 'world', 'memories', 'processis', 'higher', 'psyche', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'tune', 'human', 'feelings', 'subconcious', 'Somehow', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'private', 'feelings', 'experiences', 'have', 'hold', 'relationship', 'screen', 'way', 'touching', 'sad', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'scripts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Also', 'feel', 'have', 'write', 'blurb', 'Jim', 'Carrery', 'particular', 'film', 'really', 'won', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'films', 'do', 'more', 'annoy', 'entertain', 'will', 'say', 'proved', 'film', 'damn', 'fine', 'actor', 'character', 'played', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'incredibley', 'likeable']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Nostalgia for example, is perhaps the most poetic region of this faculty.So when you have the chance to erase from the memory a bite of it, in a way equivalent to a lobotomy. We are not better, just different. Charlie Kaufman wrote a postmodern fable in which science fiction is the gateway to imagine the possibility of building our memories, beyond the free will. Hence the nostalgia - for me it is a verb rather than a word - makes both decide, despite the errors, and disconnectedness of everyday disagreements correct the helm and give both a second chance.The script is nearly round, with a secondary reading of a noted physician and his beautiful assistant. That line was not sufficiently dramatically developed and its outcome did not quite measure up. Moreover, the conductor thread would have enabled dramatic confront both sides of the coin: rearrangement and impregnable tragedy.Though it would mean not acknowledging that this was perhaps in the most interesting cult film of that year. It's a film that continues to captivate much of the new generations despite the elapsed years.Jim Carrey has never been better in any film.

Total self-indulgence.  ""Dramatic masterpiece"" one reviewer called it!??  Well, where exactly is the dramatic logic in the plot's central turning point, that Clementine, presumably because of her oh-so endearing ""impulsive character,"" decided to erase boyfriend Joel from her memory?  Where or where in these 2 hours is the justification for such an act?  This is just a presumed plot device, and one that would fool juveniles who are smoking too much pot to notice - to notice anything except how ""cool"" it is that Stan and Mary are fooling around while Joel lies there getting his brain drained.  Remember that Stan was introduced by his boss as ""one of our most experienced workers.""  Come on!  Who is Charlie Kaufman fooling?  He's just an impulsive kid who never in a million years would be entrusted with such a responsibility.  And by the way, speaking of responsibility, Stan's unethical behavior pales in comparison to Patrick's: the little monster stole someone's identity and tried to pass himself off as ""deeper"" than he is so that he could win Clementine's affections.  His ethical breach of his job was, in my opinion, extremely grave.  Does this film even once make the slightest effort to bring this spoiled lying thief to justice?  Think about that one for a minute. No, he's completely forgotten about in the end - dispensed with once his nasty role is over.  But that's all in the spirit of this film, where everybody gets away with everything and even the characters we're supposed to like are so dispicable that all they do is leave a terrible taste in the mouth.This film has no respect for it audience's intelligence.

Yes, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is every bit as fantastic as the theatrical trailer made it appear to be. Yes, believe it or not, Jim Carrey's performance is a tour de force in humorous subtlety surpassed only by his characterization of true-to-life sitcom bait in ""The Truman Show.""Director Michel Gondry has fashioned a psychedelic masterwork that will likely rattle the impatient moviegoer like a wooden roller coaster. For those of you who don't like your noggin to be tickled and gouged during a journey to the theater, I definitely don't recommend this one.Joel Barish (Carrey) is a melancholic loner who has grown weary of his girlfriend, Naomi. It is while Barish is sitting on a set of steps overlooking a beach party she has presumably thrown that his pupils become lustfully fixated. Splashing in the tide is a big-lipped, blue-jeaned beauty with her hair dyed an inexplicable shade of red. Eventually, this woman visits Barish, and after the initial jitters, the two hit it off. He learns her name is Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet).Kruczynski's attitude tends to fluctuate with the hue that coats her locks. When she awakens in political furor at the start of a week perhaps she'll slather her curls with the color Green Revolution. But if she feels especially threatening to societal values, maybe a dime-sized deposit of Red Menace on the scalp will suffice.In spite of their differences, the two share a romantic courtship that, for the most part, is functional though some of the abrasive inner workings.One evening, Barish says the wrong thing and Kruczynski trots out of his life for what he thinks is a temporary leave. He couldn't have been more mistaken. The always-impulsive Clementine immediately opts for an experimental procedure that permanently erases unshakable memories. She wants to forget Barish for all of time and move on with her life.The problem is no one told poor Joel the news. Cluelessly, he attempts to apologize to her at her workplace.

Meet Clementine Kruczynski, a wacky, spontaneous, uninhibited woman who colors her hair as often as she brushes her teeth. Kate Winslet is brilliant here. She bounces with energy as the vibrant Clem. And Carrey gives one of his most mature, deeply felt performances as Barish. Joel and Clementine meet each other. Sparks fly. It's love. The conventional and the eccentric collide. More sparks - a veritable conflagration. And then the inevitable. Kaput! Abruptly. Painfully. Clementine wants to ""wash that man right outta her hair,"" so she literally has him removed from her mind. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, (Tom Wilkinson), invented a procedure to erase isolated, unwanted memories. He provides this process through his company, Lacuna. Ever unpredictable, Clementine decides this is for her. The next time the ex-couple meets, Clementine acts as if she has never seen Joel before. Joel is astounded, confused. A friend, (the very funny David Cross), finally tells Joel that he has been erased. Devastated and depressed, Joel decides to have the same procedure performed.Most of the film's action takes place inside Joel's head. Hooked up to the memory-erasing apparatus, which pinpoints each Clementine-related memory in his brain and zaps it, he relives every moment before it's wiped-out. The emotional sense of loss is magnified, as one memory after another is visually annihilated. Unconscious, Joel realizes these moments are far too precious to destroy. Is it too late to save them?""Why remember a destructive love affair?""  So asks, Dr. Mierzwiak, who presides over a hearty-partying Lacuna staff, which includes: Patrick, the unethical technician, (Elijah Wood), who uses ill-gained information to court Clementine; Mary, the ditzy receptionist, (Kirsten Dunst), who fools around with senior technician, Stan, (Mark Ruffalo), while her heart lies elsewhere. This off-beat gang of unprofessionals is responsible for the comic relief. They bring unlooked for depth to their roles also.Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the remarkable landscape of Joel Barish's mind. This unbelievable visual collage of memories, and shifted, twisted realities, is absolutely brilliant and most memorable. The cinematography, (Ellen Kuras), is amazing! Dreams morph into reality then fade back to fantasy, while people disappear in mid-stride, as Joel's brain cells are destroyed. There are no boundaries here.WOW! What a whimsical, delightful, poignant, refreshing gem of a film! I laughed out loud at times, and my eyes teared-up at others. Jim Carrey and Ms. Winslet really shine and emphasize, with their performances, our very human need for love. Eternal Sunshine's premise is that we need each other, even during those periods when being together interferes with being happy. As someone once said, ""love is hard."" And ""Eternal Sunshine"" is, above all else, an original love story. The movie's title is a quotation from Alexander Pope's poem ""Eloisa to Abelard:"" ""How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind/ Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.""Kudos to director Michel Gondry, and Charlie Kaufman.

Of course we all know the premise of the movie, but when you just look at that you can't completely see how funny this movie really is.At the same time that Joel is having his memory of Clementine erased we see the ones who are erasing his memory it starts out with Patrick (Frodo) and the one who is actually running the equipment played by Mark Ruffalo. At this point we find out that Patrick is dating Clementine and using pieces of Joel's past to win her over.Soon after Kirsten Dunst's character comes over where the erasing Joel's memory, Patrick has to leave to comfort Clementine and so Mark and Kirsten are having a party. All the while Joel lies in the bed, Mark and Kirsten are dancing on it in their underwear, smoking weed next to him, and drinking in the area. (This part makes me never want to go through surgery.)Joel eventually decides to start hiding his memory of Clementine elsewhere in his mind in order to remember her, but Mark picks up on it even in his screwed up state, and calls his boss to come over and help. He gets there and their able to fix things and he takes over the operation and Mark goes outside to get air as Kirsten stays in and flirts with their boss.I'm not going to give anymore away, because this part adds a little twist to the movie that I didn't expect.

It has a quirky premise and characters.  The heroine, Clementine, played by Kate Winslett, is on the outs with her lover, Joel, played by Jim Carrey. She impulsively decides to try out a new procedure which deletes unwanted memories.  She has the memory of her relationship with Joel erased.  When Joel finds out, he decides to have his memories of her erased.  Most of the movie concerns the night of this erasure, when the unconcious Joel fights desperately to maintain the memory of his lost love.  For such an outlandish premise, the movie seems very realistic to me.  It poignantly portrays how constant love is and how we cherish our memories of even failed relationships.  I don't want to say much more because I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone but, suffice it to say, that this film wonderfully portrays the complexity and permanance of love.  It also calls to mind for me the French quotation, which loosely translated says that ""the heart has its reasons which reason cannot understand"".  One final word to those of you who are not fans of Jim Carey.  I am not a great fan of Jim Carrey in his comic roles.  The Jim Carrey in this movie seems to be another actor altogether.

Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[14, 18]","I read all of the 4 star reviews and raves for this film but was still a little leary of Jim Carrey's ability to pull this off. Well, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind main star may be billed as Jim Carrey, but it's true star is Michael Gondry, the director. This film is best described as an acid trip, a bad case of deja vu and a nightmare rolled into one. The story centers around the relationship between an introverted, lonely man Joel (Jim Carrey) and a spontaneous, vivacious extrovert named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They meet by chance and fall in love and then hit some hard times which leads the impulsive Clementine to have her memories of Joel erased by a company called Lacuna. Once Joel realizes this, he decides to have his memories of Clementine erased from his memory. Much of the duration of the film is spent as the doctor tries to erase Joel's memories of Clementine, while Joel realizes (as the process is going on) that he's made a big mistake. Joel and Clementine try to escape to a part of Joel's brain where they can't be detected so that Joel can keep his precious memories of her. Carrey gives a fantastic understated performance, while Winslet continues to impress with every role she takes. Eternal Sunshine does shine brightly because of the impeccable, flawless direction of Michael Gondry. Simply put, you have never seen another movie like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and you never will after it. This movie will resonate in your brain and haunt you...in a good way.

Buettner ""Jaws Fan""","[26, 36]","Eternal Sunshine is totally unconventional in every way, especially the way the story is told and that should be no surprise to anyone that is familiar with Charlie Kaufman's work. I absolutely loved the movie and found it to be heartbreaking and handled it's characters and their relationships in a way not seen in most movies.What was surprising to me was the emotional impact of the movie. Eternal Sunshine reveals its characters through their flaws making them real and human. This is an honest love story. It doesn't stick in flat uninteresting, good looking teen actors, and have them go through the motions of a standard love story. Instead the movie reveals its love story in layers through moments, both good and bad, but important.The performances by Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are nothing short of brilliant. There is not one moment of Jim Carrey's comic shtick, so those fans wanting to see the Jim Carrey of Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura or Liar Liar will be very disappointed. Kate Winslet was able to pull of a very tough role, and I couldn't imagine anyone else that could have pulled it off so convincingly.The way that the film handled its material was effective and interesting. The special effects employed here work within the story and give it a definitive and different look.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone.

That first bit of the film might make you think you are watching another insufferable Jim Carey movie about a couple of simpleminded (brain damaged? mentally ill? Borderline retarded?) people who fall in love. What becomes clear after the 20-minute point, however, is that ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a much richer and more interesting film.The main plot device is a company called Lacuna, Inc whose job is to erase bad memories. The rest of the film involved a love story, but also explored the complicated realities and ethics involved when you lose your bad memories but others don't. There are some scary moments in the film, mostly revolving around a character who changes his mind about the procedure. There are intense chase sequences that take place inside a person's memories that are at least as frightening as any chase involving cars or bad guys.Carey and Kate Winslet are perfect as the crazy-in-love couple. ElijahWood is perfect as the geeky tech who wants to date Kate. Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst are fantastic as the workaday team busy changing brains while eating pizza and flirting.The real star of the show, though, is artistic. The writing, editingand lighting had to be perfect to represent the dreamlike mindscapes in which the characters maneuver for much of the film. Sections of the film take on a surreal quality with quick cuts, pinprick lighting, bizarre (but comprehensible) scene changes and repetitions.The effects used to represent the disappearance of cherished memories were varied and quote convincing.A phenomenal achievement on every level.HINT: do not ruin the film by watching Jim Carey mug through the DVD extras.

620182,A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T,B00005JMJG,Jed Shlackman,"[2, 2]","Eternal sunshine is a clever movie that explores the concept of memory being erased to remove unpleasant memories.  The setting is a dreary, blighted area of Long Island NY and the beaches of Montauk, where the disrupted romance of the Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet characters begins.  The story shifts back and forth in time as well as in and out of the mind of the Carrey character.  The supporting cast includes Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst, with each supporting character playing an important role in the progression of the plot.  The story can be confusing at times during the film, and overall the movie leaves a bittersweet emotional aftertaste.  There are a couple interesting philosophical quotes presented by the Dunst character, and the very nature and setting of the film are rather curious in light of documented stories and rumors about mind control/manipulation experiments and projects carried out by government/occult groups using a military facility at Montauk.  The wintery scenes and changes in Winslet's hair color in the course of the film are quite metaphoric of what is happening within the consciousness of the lead character, and can also be used to help track the temporal sequence of the film.  This film is quite intriguing, though it has a somewhat ambivalent ending that won't satisfy those seeking story closure or a ""feel good"" conclusion.  Carrey's role is quite serious, although he gets to show some of his childish side in sequences where he goes back into his mind and tries to modify his own memories to hide his consciousness of his girlfriend from the memory erasing apparatus.

The plot line folds in on itself. It reveals bits and pieces of the relationship slowly and sometimes you have to put a piece somewhere else than where you originally placed it in the jigsaw puzzle of their relationship. This makes the movie interesting to watch. In this respect it is like ""Memento."" Carey and the other actors do a good job. Carey plays a lonely loner in this movie very well.The plot device is the memory erase. A doctor comes up with a method to erase all memories of a relationship. What the movie points out very well,using Carey's relationships and subplots, is that memories of even bad relationships should be valued and erasing memories does not really solve any thing in your life.I did not give the movie five stars because I was not engaged in the relationship. There is an emotional center in the movie, but it really did not interest me. I could care less whether Carey's character and Winslett's character have a successful relationship. Maybe it is just me, but you see much of the bad parts of the relationship before you see the good so it is hard to be a cheerleader for this relationship to work.I recommend the movie; however, it did not overwhelm me.

620186,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JMJG,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 6]","I usually like Jim Carrey movies, so I decided to give ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" a twirl. Wow. The rubber faced Canadian comic has certainly come a long way since the days of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""Dumb and Dumber."" Heck, he's come a long way since his turn as The Riddler in one of the Batman movies. As far as I can tell, Carrey suffers from the same affliction that infected Steve Martin and Robin Williams, namely the disease that convinces wildly popular comedians to turn their backs on stand up in favor of careers as ""serious"" actors making ""serious"" films. Think about it. Martin went from such classics as ""The Jerk"" and ""The Man with Two Brains"" to ""Grand Canyon"" and ""The Spanish Prisoner."" Robin Williams's turn towards the dramatic is even starker. He turned in memorable comedic performances in the television series ""Mork and Mindy"" and movies like ""The Survivor"" before moving on to the depressingly downbeat ""Jakob the Liar"" and ""One Hour Photo."" What's going on? Well, once comedians hit it big, they worry about becoming pigeonholed in funny flicks. So they immediately seek out meatier roles, preferably ones with Oscar winning potential, in order to achieve longevity in Hollywood.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" defies easy explanation. If I had to sum the film up in a few words, I'd say it's a story about how we need both good and bad memories to experience the fullness of life. How we get to that conclusion is the interesting part. The movie introduces us to a miserable looking chap named Joel Barish (Carrey) as he rides a train through the countryside on a rather bleak day. Our hero (or is it anti-hero?) has about had it with life. His biggest problem seems linked to bad relationships, but all of that is about to change when he runs into Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). The two immediately strike up a rapport, and it becomes quite clear that Joel and Clementine couldn't be further apart in demeanor. Barish slinks around as though he's trying to hide from the world, never talking above a hoarse whisper. Clementine is wild, with blue hair and an extroverted personality that screams, ""Look at me!"" Nonetheless, the old adage that claims opposites always attract seems to bear fruit here. Joel and Clementine strike up an intense relationship that soon finds them living together in a blissful state of love. As in many relationships, love doesn't last.One day Joel discovers that Clementine has decided she's not only had enough of him, but she's also decided to erase any memories of their time together with the help of a place called Lacuna, Inc. Run by a kindly doctor named Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna operates a facility that can literally burn memories of any event out of a person's head. When Joel discovers what his love is up to, he decides to retaliate in kind. Unfortunately, once Barish is under the knife (metaphorically speaking) he decides that he doesn't want to lose his precious memories. What follows is a rollercoaster ride as recollections both good and bad fly through Joel's mind. We enter his mind and follow the pair's relationship backwards, at least I think it's backwards, and see how things went so wrong. We also see why Joel fell in love with this wonderful woman in the first place. The best parts of the film show us how Barish tries to hide Clementine in his childhood memories to protect her from Lacuna's invasive procedures. A subplot involving Mierzwiak and his subordinates Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood) plays a big role in the film's twist conclusion. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is definitely not your typical Hollywood romance flick.First and foremost, I want to commend Jim Carrey for his work in this film. Anyone who has seen his manic comedy bits and over the top acting skills will express the utmost astonishment at his incredibly subtle performance in this movie. He conveys a real sense of pain and vulnerability without coming across as forced or insincere. The actor also plays the comedic bits well, mainly the memories of his childhood, without going for broad slapstick. Just as excellent is Kate Winslet. I like this actress anyway, and would watch her in practically any movie she chooses to do, but she's quite good here. She plays off Carrey perfectly, and the two have great onscreen chemistry that makes a relationship between them more believable. I can't say I cared for the subplot involving the Lacuna employees, which I initially thought only added unnecessary clutter to a storyline that demands your full and undivided attention, but their presence becomes important as the film progresses. The conclusion wouldn't work, for example, without Mary giving Joel and Clementine some important items that help them figure out what's going on. I was appreciative of any help at this point because this is one confusing film. Subsequent viewings are practically mandatory.Listening to the commentary track helps. Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman shed a bit of light--perhaps sunshine is a better term--on the movie's intricate plot. A making of featurette and a conversation with Carrey and Gondry provide further insights. The disc also gives us deleted scenes, a music video, and an infomercial for Lacuna, Inc. I liked the movie immensely, but I'm not sure ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" rates highly as a date movie. My girlfriend quickly bored of the twisting plotlines and promptly fell asleep, leaving me to ponder the film's inimitable charms alone. Oh well. Watch Gondry's film, and then watch it again. It's worth your time.",5,One of a kind,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,5665,"['usually', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'decided', 'give', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'twirl', 'Wow',

Thankfully enough I found ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" an excellent romantic and intriguing comedy-drama about two people who don't truly realize they are in love until one loses the other. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is a lonely yet sweet man who is looking for true love and the ideal woman. His search ends when he meets Clementine Krucynksi (Kate Winslet), an energetic and wild young woman. Clementine is everything Joel isn't... at least not the Joel the world sees. The feelings locked up inside of him are released through Clementine. They prove you do not have to make love or kiss all the time to be in love. This couple can play music, in the snow, go shopping, or just lounge around at home and the audience can tell they are in love. But as time goes by, their relationship begins to shatter and really goes to the extreme when Joel discovers Clementine erased him from her mind, thanks to a brilliant doctor's invention. Joel contacts the agency, Lacuna Inc., and its main doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), for Joel to receive the same operation. During the evening Dr. Mierzwiak and his team: another doctor/technician (Mark Ruffalo), a lovestruck receptionist/assistant (Kirsten Dunst), and naive (Elijah Wood) perform the operation, Joel evaluates his relationship with Clementine and realizes he is still in love with her and wishes to keep the memories of her.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is an incredible film and one of the greatest modern romantic comedies of our time. It is smart, clever, and charming with an exceptional cast and an intelligent crew. This movie received many excellent reviews and anyone that I've known that has seen it agrees. A movie like that is superb.  This movie is unique and makes the audience think and comprehend of what is happening. Carrey delivers a superb performance that made him avoid the ""Oscar"". His humor mixed with sadness and all the complexity of the character made me understand that he is a great actor (before, Truman Show made the audience give a serious look at this actor) and performer. Kate Winslet, again, delivers a full featured character, a ""girl"" from town, this ""Shakespeare"" actress can do it all and likely see the wild and funny side of her, what you would think would be vice versa. The supporting cast consisting of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson is does a great job. Charlie Kaufman, as always, writes a phenomenal script with such creativity and intellect. Speaking of intellect, director Michel Gondry uses his own intellect to make this film a spectacle. The shots are captivating and exciting.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a romantic motion picture unlike any other. It is definitely not one of those typical romantic comedies when they both love each other without realizing it. This film captures beauty and the true quality of a great film.

620190,A1IRC4VBTL6B6J,B00005JMJG,"J HADFIELD ""James Hadfield""","[1, 2]","One of the strangest and most downright heartwarming films to drift out of the States in the last few years, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is - what? - an inside-out romance story of sorts. When Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski's (Kate Winslet) relationship seems to have hit the rocks, the latter chooses to, um, erase her lover from her memory. Joel, on discovering why his girl suddenly seems to have no idea - or interest in - who he is, decides to do the same, only to change his mind halfway through the procedure.Much of ""Eternal Sunshine..."" takes place within Joel's head, as his every memory of Clementine is identified and erased - so providing an abstract and decidedly arse-over-backwards account of the entire relationship. Seeing his recollections of Clementine get literally stripped away before his eyes (one noteworthy scene takes place in a disintegrating building), he starts trying to find somewhere he can ""hide"" his love, flicking through childhood memories for some mental cranny sufficiently far from the erasers' reach. Clementine becomes a childhood friend, a family acquaintance, and then... ooh, I've gone cross-eyed.You'd struggle to find a love story more poignant, or a more telling meditation on the nature of both relationships and memory - the way that disconnected events bleed into one another, that one recollection can spark another. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is as audacious and intelligent as you'd expect and, in former music video auteur Michel Gondry, he's found a director more than capable of realising his vision. ""Eternal Sunshine..."" is an almost embarassingly rich treasure trove of elegant, perfectly-conceived visuals.There's enough human drama for your biscuit, too. Carrey (nervous, deflated, refreshingly de-smugged) and Winslet (whimsical, outrageous - and, Lordy, you've gotta dig that ever-changing barnet) come across like chalk and cheese, but their performances are touching, nuanced and oddly loveable. Props to the ever-reliable Tom Wilkinson, too - seen here as the (apparently) mild-mannered doctor behind all this mind wiping malarky. If his support crew (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and - put those dewy eyes away! - Kirsten Dunst) prove rather less compelling, it's probably just down to unfairly stiff competition.

And people think this movie is ""innovative"" ?! It gave that up right there and then, and makes me feel nauseous hours after walking out of the theatre.The plot (if there's any) is simple but extremely boring, shortly into the movie you got the message that love is in the persuit itself but not in the end result. Yet the movie went on forever and all you could get further is the repetition of ""Oh I love you, oh you're gone.. awww"" 1000 times (plus more shaking images, blackouts, erratic lighting, and your dizziness caused by it).I love Carrey and Dunst, but I don't give a dime to this movie, and I refuse to praise The Emperor's New Suit.

620192,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B00005JMJG,Jim&Yvonne,"[0, 0]","Kaufman (""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" among others) again writes a spectacular screenplay which follows the lives of an introverted man searching for love and manic woman who searches for stability, well maybe not stability, but someone who can put up with her, who both goes through unique life events and tries to overcome them to end where they begin.  The movie is loaded with talent, too much to mention, but it is especially Kate Winslet (Titanic) that moves this film along and outshines all others.  She was perfectly cast and she nailed her performance.  She is one of those actresses that seem to work only when she wants, I wish she was working more because she is so talented, however, we'll be seeing plenty of her in 2006.  Even though ""Titanic"" made her a household name, it was far from her best work.  The director (Gondry) came from the same mold as Spike Jonze and others (music videos directors) and for some reason, these type of directors are able to make very unique screenplays work.  Jim Carrey did not play his normal character, but a quirky, introverted individual and actually pulled it off.  He showed range that I did not think he had in him and I would be happy to see him in similar type roles.  The supporting cast that consisted of ""A or almost A"" list actors (Dunst, Ruffalo, Wood and Wilkinson) were superb in supporting the leads and the story.  The story worked, it was dramatic, visceral and very creative.

M Quiggins ""Sole_Fish""","[2, 4]","A lot of us, those who are considered 'die-hard' fans, have watched Jim soar, stumble, bore us, and cause our stomachs to hurt from laughing. It is sometimes hard to know what his next project will turn out to be. I have followed Jim since his early days. I own an original copy of Rubberface (on VHS). A movie he was part of for Canadian television long before we knew him in the states. I even remember his failed sitcom, ""The Duck Factory."" I was one of those who watched him stumble with ""The Cable Guy"" , bore us with "" The Majestic"" and make me fall down laughing with "" Liar Liar"". In this particular flick, he SOARS. I finally got the chance to see this. It wasn't anywhere near me when it was in the theaters. I had to rent it. And, i think our old friend Jim has learned a lot. Mainly how to portray dramatic acting in a very powerful way. The movie itsself is a celebration of individuality, regrets , hopes , dreams , and love. Sometimes it strays away from those basic concepts to show us a living, breathing ,artistic way to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. His love is stolen away fom him. Or, rather, her mind is stolen away from him. And, in his pain, he decides his own mind needs to go too. Only, while he is allowing this act of very well portrayed science fiction to be done to him, he begins to regret the decision. As this regret surfaces in his mind, he becomes active in his thoughts. Much like he himself is in control of his dream. He becomes aware of what is happenning. He tries to stop it. He lives his most wonderful memories all over again. He also visits the dark sides of his mind. One where he is coaxed, by a gang of bullies, to finish off a half-dead bird with a hammer. What a painful moment. There is even a dose of the comical side of Jim. Though, it is a very sedate version of his comical side. Robin Williams had his turn in an Indie movie, "" One Hour Photo"" that was terrific. Bill Murray had ""Lost in Translation"" , Adam Sandler had "" Punch Drunk Love"", and there are so many more. All of these movies have one concept in common. They were complex movies approached in a very simple way. Those movies, like this one, all allowed the talent of the star to rise above everything else. And, all of these stars are great talents. This movie, along with The Truman Show, will be the defining moment(s) in Jim Carrey's career. If you are able to watch a movie, and split the artistic vision away from the surface ,and see the acting in the movie as a seperate entity, then you will enjoy this movie. Just don't try to decipher it as you go. It probably won't work. The director is trying to take you on a trip armed only with the information that Jim himself has. And, that ain't much. But as the story unfolds, it becomes a truly endearing romantic story. While that may sound sappy to some, it is really not. It really delivers a unique perspective on just about everything.

Well, what if that was an option for separated couples? What if people could actually erase their memory of a failed relationship and partner? And most importantly, would it be worth it? ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" asks these questions as the film wonderfully and cleverly unfolds. Never have I seen a film that I and others can easily relate to. This film is wonderfully acted, sports amazing direction, and is extremely touching when it comes to its characters and subject matter.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) learns that his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had their relationship erased from her memory by Lacuna Inc, run by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). Not knowing what to do, he decides to have the process done as well, wanting Clementine out of his mind for good. Once Mierzwiak and his fellow workers, Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) have begun to delete Joel's memory of the relationship one frame at a time, Joel discovers that that there are aspects of the relationship that he wants to keep. Thus, he journeys through his mind as he tries to preserve as much memory of Clementine as he can, hoping she won't be erased forever.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a film that is rare in Hollywood these days. It's engaging, touching, funny, realistic, and most of all, original. Expertly written by Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry, it's a film that expresses how important relationships are regardless of how much they may hurt at times.Jim Carrey (best known for his roles in ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura"" films) truly shines here as Joel. From desperate to getting rid of Clementine to desperate trying to keep her, he handles it perfectly. The chemistry Carrey has with Kate Winslet is genuine and real. Speaking of Winslet, her quirky Clementine is the ying to awkward Joel's yang. Again, perfect. All the other performances are great as well and really help round out the film.This is a Michel Gondry meaning one can expect something visually unique and original, and he doesn't disappoint in this department. The story moves at a brisk pace and never in linear fashion. It's quite complex and should be watched more than once to truly appreciate what is happening. Gondry utilizes subtle, but amazing special effects to portray Joel's crumbling mind and his use of color is outstanding. Without his direction, the film wouldn't be as great as it is.Michel Gondry's, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" is a film that needs to be seen by everyone. A complex, original story filled with lively characters and a relatable situation. Most importantly though, it's moved me in ways that films rarely can.

620197,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMJG,Joe Sherry,"[1, 3]","A film by Michel GondryFrom the very creative mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman comes ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", one of the best movies of 2004.  The narrative is kind of disjointed, but that is par for the course with a Kaufman script.  The first scenes of the movie are really from quite a bit later chronologically, but at first we do not know quite how these first scenes fit into the story or why.  Not long into the movie we learn that Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) had a relationship, but when it ended Clementine decided to have a new procedure done which can remove a person's memories of another person (or another thing).  So, as far as Clementine now knows, she and Joel have never met.  When Joel learns about this he has the same procedure done to remove all memories of Clementine.At this point, the movie loses all sense of chronology, but it is makes more sense.  The following scenes are Joel's memories as they are being erased, so his unconscious is reliving the memories and remembering both the good and the bad of his relationship with Clementine.  At some point Joel decides that these are memories he doesn't want to lose.  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a very original look at love and relationships and what it could mean to really try and make a relationship work.  The film is uncompromising in how it reveals Joel and Clementine, but at the same time it is very tender and sweet.  Co-starring Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirstin Dunst, the movie never makes a wrong turn.  With a subject that could easily have mad a very bad movie, Michel Gondry instead makes a very good one.  In a refreshing change of pace Jim Carrey plays the straight man to Kate Winslet's far crazier Clementine.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the most original, well acted, and simply excellent movies of the year.  It deserves a place on any critics Top 10 list and is well worth watching.

I loved the idea of this movie, the acting in this movie, the way that both of those were framed and offered to the viewer. I love that this movie starts at the end and ends at the start. I love the visuals of this movie, the little details that you might not notice the first time around. I love that the books disappear when Joel tells Clementine 'bye' in her bookstore towards the end. I love the little loops that this movie makes, the twists and ties of things that seem so innocent, but that end up turning back and consuming themselves.Most of all, I love that this movie takes careful aim at the condition of being human and gives us all a second chance. I love that the writer decided to give Love itself an encore, a curtain call, a way to come back and make sure to make it work the second time. I love that this movie takes away all our hope, then gives back the seed of something new, something better.Aside from the raving lunacy I just put down...this movie is good. It offers us a possibility: erasing unwanted memories through science. It then takes that (non)existant science and asks questions about it, about the implications of it, about what our memories mean to us. Are memories something we should tamper with? Would we want to? What is the price of a memory? This is nothing new to movies, and there are other movies that deal with real world science, such as cloning, but I would argue that this one is more touching and close to home. This is something that could happen to any of us; not just through science either. With things like alzheimers and the like, the threat of losing our memories of ourselves and others is a real one. This is a movie to take an idea and really make you think about it. This is a movie that will make you cherish what fond memories you already might have.Bottom line: this is a must see.-LP",5,I can't remember,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,2002,"['know', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'majority', 'one', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'movie', 'favorites', 'time.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'loved', 'idea', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'way', 'were', 'framed', 'offered', 'viewer', 'love', 'movie', 'end', 'start', 'love', 'visuals', 'movie', 'little', 'details', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'first', 'time', 'love', 'books', 'disappear', 'when', 'Joel', 'Clementine', ""'bye"", 'bookstore', 'end', 'love', 'little', 'movie', 'twists', 'ties', 'things', 'seem', 'so', 'innocent', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'back', 'consuming', 'themselves.Most', 'love', 'movie', 'careful', 'aim', 'condition', 'being', 'human', 'second', 'chance', 'love', 'writer', 'decided', 'give', 'Love', 'encore', 'curtain', 'call', 'way', 'come', 'back', 'make', 'sure', 'make', 'work', 'second', 'time', 'love', 'movie', 'away', 'hope', 'then', 'back', 'seed', 'something', 'new', 'something', 'better.Aside', 'raving', 'lunacy', 'just', 'put', 'down', 'movie', 'good', 'possibility', 'erasing', 'unwanted', 'memories', 'science', 'then', 'non', 'existant', 'science', 'asks', 'questions', 'implications', 'what', 'memories', 'mean', 'Are', 'something', 'should', 'tamper', 'Would', 'want', 'What', 'price', 'memory', 'nothing', 'new', 'movies', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'deal', 'real', 'world', 'science', 'such', 'cloning', 'would', 'argue', 'one', 'more', 'touching', 'close', 'home', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'not', 'just', 'science', 'either', 'things', 'alzheimers', 'like', 'threat', 'losing', 'memories', 'ourselves', 'others', 'real', 'one', 'movie', 'take', 'idea', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'cherish', 'what', 'fond', 'memories', 'already', 'might', 'have.Bottom', 'line', 'must', 'see.-LP']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

I was eager to quickly purchase the DVD when it was first released - and I did so.Less than a month afterwards they announced a new 2-Disc edition, which must be the record for the shortest-ever re-release (apart from simultaneous separate editions such as the ""regular"" edition of Ray and the ""special"" edition for the die-hard fans of the film).At first I was very upset, and angry at the film studio for doing this. Then I saw the extra features on the 2-Disc edition:- Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry- Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue- A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry- Deleted & Extended Scenes- Souvenir BookletFirst of all, the front packaging for the new DVD is awful. It's the same as the old one, but centered, with annoying critics' reviews highlighted all over the place. Second of all, the new features are, simply put, not worth the upgrade. There's already an Anatomy of a Scene on the original disc. Once you've seen one, you get the idea. Only the most die-hard of fans would find it worth upgrading just for this. The conversation with Kate Winslet and Gondry is just as bad as teh conversation with Jim Carrey on Disc 1 - boring and not insightful at all. ""Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry"" was also available before and the souvenir booklet isn't anything special.I think this is the worst case of marketing ever. I love the movie. I'm disappointed in the DVDs - the commentary isn't very interesting, the bonus features are dull, and to my surprise the instantaneous release of the ""special"" edition is just as bad.I'd give it five stars if they hadn't tried to rip everyone off with two editions. The difference between the normal edition of Ray and the special edition is that they were announced at the same time, and put on the shelves at the same time.

It's an interesting premise and one that many would jump at the chance to do.  I, however, would not want to have the procedure done because I feel your past experiences are what make you a stronger person.Joel (Jim Carrey) meets and falls in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet) and it's an incredible relationship.  I found myself noticing things that only people truly in love do.  But, it does go sour and things end badly.  One person chooses to have their memories erased of the other and the other person chooses to do it as well (out of spite?) but regrets it during the procedure.  I won't get that far into the plot, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the ending is well worthwhile and meaningful.Another great part of the DVD are the deleted scenes.  I was really moved by one in particular and I felt it should have been included...Supporting cast is great, especially Kirsten Dunst.  She's so emotionally needy in the film and she plays it very well.  Elijah Wood is good in a mostly negative and backhanded role.  It's good to finally see him play something other than a Hobbit.

Well, Joel has gone through the same situation with a girl named Clementine, He wants to forget her, but his heart wants to keep her. All through out the film, we see Joel(Jim Carrey) trying to cherish the love and respect that he had for Clemintine(Kate Winslet). What Joel doesn't relieze is that they are already erasing the memories one by one, and He loses Clementine every second. He gets her back by parading her through his deep and secluded memories of her, his childhood, and his parents. He then ends up going to her house and they reconcile and share a truly unqiue love moment, as they patch their relationship back up and start all over again.Micheal Gondry is a genius. He has such a creative mind, and creative ways to show how Joel's mind works, He has one of the most unique directing styles I have seen. He can take something ordinary, and twist it past complexion, and how we see things, he totally warps that. Charlie Kaufman is quickly becoming one of my favorite screenwriters, He has the knack for writing truly weird, but interesting stories. He can take words and make them sound different, He can take people and make them look different, he can take places and make them look unique, yet puzzling. He is a very gift man. Jim Carrey was robbed of a Oscar, He puts on one of the most dramatic and awe inspiring performances I have ever seen him do, He is quickly becoming more of a dramatic actor rather than a comedian. Kate Winslet, she is a fine young lady, She can absolutely act, and keep up with Jim Carrey, and She really had a chemistry with him.

620207,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B00005JMJG,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[2, 3]","Simply stated, Charlie Kaufman is one of the most talented, original presences in modern film. So far, he's delivered the strikingly innovative ""Being John Malkovich"", the quirky and amusing ""Human Nature"", and the vibrant masterpiece, ""Adaptation"". I find ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to be somewhat more difficult to rate. I will tell you why later in the review.First, the story. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a man heart-broken by the loss of his eccentric girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet). He finds out she underwent a controversial new procedure (offered by a company named Lacuna, Inc.) that erases a selected memory from the human brain. Her selected memory was the long, meaningful relationship between her and Joel, which came to a bitter end. After learning this, Joel impulsively decides to have the procedure done on him. The film then shows us what goes on inside Joel's head while two young Lacuna employees (Wood, Ruffalo) carry out the procedure. Joel relives his relationship with Clementine, revealing all of their most intimate moments and quirks, and in the process, realizes how much he loves her. He then attempts to hide from the memory erasure with Clementine, burying himself in his most humiliating memories, trying to save some memory of the woman he now does not want to forget about.The film features wonderful performances from the entire cast, Carrey especially, who delivers arguably his best performance. The writing, of course, is top notch, Kaufman is a genius. The directing from former music video director Michel Gondry is teeming with life, vision, and personality. The film itself is absolutely excellent, as it perfectly portrays one of the most realistic, down-to-earth relationships ever conveyed through film, striking a delicate balance of joy and pain, revealing the couples most intimate and candid moments while never exploiting sex between the two characters.Now, here's my dilemma in rating this film. For some reason, I just don't love it like I feel I should. I don't know, for some reason it just doesn't connect with me like it does others. But this is just me personally. If I were rating this film on quality alone, I'd give it a 10/10. But since I rate films based on how much I like them, I give it an...8/10",4,A Touching Modern Romance,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2278,"['Simply', 'stated', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'original', 'presences', 'modern', 'film', 'So', 'far', 'delivered', 'strikingly', 'innovative', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'quirky', 'amusing', 'Human', 'Nature', 'vibrant', 'masterpiece', 'Adaptation', 'find', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'be', 'somewhat', 'more', 'difficult', 'rate', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'later', 'review.First', 'story', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'man', 'heart-broken', 'loss', 'eccentric', 'girlfriend', 'Clementine', 'Winslet', 'out', 'underwent', 'controversial', 'new', 'procedure', 'offered', 'company', 'named', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.', 'selected', 'memory', 'human', 'brain', 'selected', 'memory', 'was', 'long', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'Joel', 'came', 'bitter', 'end', 'learning', 'Joel', 'impulsively', 'have', 'procedure', 'done', 'film', 'then', 'Joel', 'head', 'two', 'young', 'Lacuna', 'employees', 'Wood', 'Ruffalo', 'carry', 'out', 'procedure', 'Joel', 'relationship', 'Clementine', 'revealing', 'most', 'intimate', 'moments', 'quirks', 'process', 'realizes', 'how', 'much', 'then', 'hide', 'memory', 'erasure', 'Clementine', 'burying', 'most', 'humiliating', 'memories', 'trying', 'save', 'memory', 'woman', 'now', 'not', 'want', 'forget', 'about.The', 'film', 'features', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Carrey', 'especially', 'who', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'writing', 'course', 'top', 'notch', 'Kaufman', 'genius', 'directing', 'former', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'teeming', 'life', 'vision', 'personality', 'film', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'perfectly', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'down-to-earth', 'relationships', 'ever', 'conveyed', 'film', 'striking', 'delicate', 'balance', 'joy', 'pain', 'revealing', 'couples', 'most', 'intimate', 'candid', 'moments', 'never', 'exploiting', 'sex', 'two', 'characters.Now', 'here', 'dilemma', 'rating', 'film', 'reason', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'feel', 'should', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reason', 'just', ""n't"", 'connect', 'others', 'just', 'personally', 'were', 'rating', 'film', 'quality', 'alone', ""'d"", 'give', '10/10', 'rate', 'films', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'like', 'give', '8/10']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

What to do?Well, if the movie grabs you in any way, watch it again, and if it grabs you some more, watch it once more.For me, it was the opening 20 minutes or so, which grabbed me. Such a bizarre couple, but with a special chemistry that made me want to learn as much about them as I could. Plus, the photography, bits of music, etc., were also inviting in those minutes.  So, I was willing to see the film through, even though at times it tried to lose me.After seeing it the first time, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars or so. However, I still had a desire to see it again, now that I could revisit scenes with a better understanding and from different viewpoints.So, the second viewing really did hook me, now that the plot was clearer. Two people, so different and so flawed, yet finding that special bond, with the unconscious figuring out things that somehow eluded the conscious. I personally can relate to that, remembering I had a dream once, where, in the dream I actually recognized that I was in a dream, so that my unconscious was indeed plugged directly into my conscious.I have always questioned how in a two minute conversation, talk show pseudo-therapists can tell a caller to drop a deeply flawed mate. Aren't even the deeply flawed, allowed to experience love? Of course they are, and this film really does capture that.Someone commented in their review that there were no words worthy to remember from the film, however, I will never see the word, ""nice,"" in quite the same way again.Without the performances from Carrey and Winslet and the chemistry they generated, this film likely would not have succeeded in capturing the power of love in quite the way it did.

620210,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JMJG,Josh Hitchens,"[3, 4]","Michael Gondry and Charlie Kaufman's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" may be one of the most original and moving film romances in years. It is impressively directed, and as labrynththine as Kaufman's screenplay gets, the movie never becomes confusing.""Eternal Sunshine"" tells the story of the tumultuous romance of Joel and Clementine, played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. The two are madly in love, and at first they seem to be an odd match. Joel is reseved and introverted, while Clementine is a wild, impulsive woman whose hair color changes with her mood. They are together for two years, and then their relationship comes to a bitter end. Clementine decides to have a medical procedure to erase all of her memories of Joel, and Joel decides to do the same. But as the his memories of Clementine are being removed, Joel realizes how much he loves her, and tries to get her back.The majority of the movie details Joel and Clementine's relationship in reverse, beginning at their final fight and ending at their blissful first encounter. You fall in love with the characters, as flawed as they are, and desperately want them to be together in the end. Other plots include the story of the mind-erasure company employees, played by Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood. All of them give stellar performances, making the most of their limited screen time.But there is no question that ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" belongs to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Carrey has slowly moved towards more serious roles, and this may be his finest performance to date. His Joel is a sad, ordinary individual, and not for a moment does Carrey fall out of character. Winslet, one of the best actresses of her generation, positively glows as the madcap Clementine, whose impulsive behavior masks a deep insecurity and pain. Together, the two actors create a couple so beautifully in love that we want them to stay together forever, even though the film leaves you with the sense that they are destined to go their separate ways.",4,"""Looking for my own piece of mind.""",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,2053,"['Michael', 'Gondry', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'moving', 'film', 'romances', 'years', 'impressively', 'directed', 'as', 'labrynththine', 'Kaufman', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'never', 'confusing', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'story', 'tumultuous', 'romance', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'two', 'are', 'madly', 'love', 'first', 'seem', 'be', 'odd', 'match', 'Joel', 'reseved', 'introverted', 'Clementine', 'wild', 'impulsive', 'woman', 'hair', 'color', 'changes', 'mood', 'are', 'together', 'two', 'years', 'then', 'relationship', 'bitter', 'end', 'Clementine', 'have', 'medical', 'procedure', 'erase', 'memories', 'Joel', 'Joel', 'do', 'same', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'are', 'being', 'removed', 'Joel', 'how', 'much', 'tries', 'get', 'back.The', 'majority', 'movie', 'details', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'relationship', 'reverse', 'beginning', 'final', 'fight', 'ending', 'blissful', 'first', 'encounter', 'fall', 'love', 'characters', 'as', 'flawed', 'are', 'desperately', 'want', 'be', 'together', 'end', 'Other', 'plots', 'include', 'story', 'mind-erasure', 'company', 'employees', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'making', 'most', 'limited', 'screen', 'time.But', 'question', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Carrey', 'slowly', 'moved', 'towards', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'Joel', 'sad', 'ordinary', 'individual', 'not', 'moment', 'Carrey', 'fall', 'character', 'Winslet', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'generation', 'positively', 'madcap', 'Clementine', 'impulsive', 'behavior', 'masks', 'deep', 'insecurity', 'pain', 'Together', 'two', 'actors', 'create', 'couple', 'so', 'beautifully', 'love', 'want', 'stay', 'together', 'forever', 'even', 'film', 'sense', 'are', 'destined', 'go', 'separate', 'ways']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

If cloning is ever allowed in the United States we need to clone Mr. Kaufman. (If there is any community that will embrace cloning it will be Hollywood. Name any other place in America where nepotism is a religion. Hiring your own clone is the ultimate in nepotism.)Charlie Kaufman has found that fine line between realistic dialog and interesting dialog. Characters talk, fight and fall in love just like they do in real life. But unlike most movies that try to mirror real life speech Kaufman makes it interesting. (Of course it helps that Kaufman is always throwing in the bizarre; such as adulterous homicidal book authors addicted to sniffing Angel Trumpet or people entering John Malkovich's head.)Now just imagine if a Kaufman clone could, oh I don't know, help George Lucas write romantic dialog. (If there is anyone who occupies the opposite side of the good dialog screen writing scales its Lucas. His dialog is so wooden it would embarrass a marionette. Plus think of the Variety headline ""Kaufman Clone helps pen Clones"")Oh the movie. Eternal Sunshine has some great performances especially by a subdued Jim Carrey. (This should surprise but after his brilliant turn in Man on the Moon, the only real surprise is how with his quiet desperate performance you forget its Carrey.) There is a really good subplot about the goings on at a mind erasure clinic. (The movie sensibly sets it up as a no big deal four-man operation like one of those laser eye surgery places in a strip mall.)And there is a really realistic romance between Carrey and Kate Winslet that blows most movies away.

620214,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00005JMJG,Just Bill,"[12, 14]","Charlie Kaufman's movies are not for the faint of mind. If you enjoy low-brow films riddled with slapstick humor, you'll hate what he creates.However, if your taste in movies runs toward the intelligent, well-scripted and exceptionally well acted, then Kaufman is just what the doctor ordered.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is extraordinary, for many reasons:1. The acting. Simply put: first-rate, with Jim Carrey delivering his finest performance as the emotionally repressed lover of Kate Winslet, his flamboyant, somewhat nuts girlfriend.2. Its sheer originality. All Kaufman films (Being John Malkovich, in particular) are complex and enjoyable on many layers. When they're over, one is just as apt to scratch his or her head in bewilderment and say, ""Huh?"" as to say ""Wow!"" In other words, Kaufman's movies are not typical Hollywood fare. They're original, creative and require one to pay attention.3. Its message. Eternal Sunshine is, arguably, about the importance and staying power of love as it overcomes the gritty minutae of every day life. The relationship between Carrey's and Winslet's characters is hard to fathom. And it doesn't always seem to be based on anything of substance. Yet, for whatever reason, they fit together. One has what the other lacks. Two interlocking puzzle pieces, if you will. If you can accept their quirky attraction and relationship, the movie makes more sense. If you can't accept it, the movie probably won't stand up to closer scrutiny.4. The ""Wow Factor."" I tend to enjoy movies that mesmerize me. If I am captivated by a movie, unable to guess what happens next, I'm hooked. I file it under Must-Own. Eternal Sunshine was one of those movies. When my wife and I saw it at the theater we left thinking, ""Wow. We've just seen something amazing."" So the minute the DVD was released, we were there. We've watched it twice since, in fact.5.

""Being John Malkavich"" was a genius idea, very quirky and unusual. Sad thing is, the actual story of the idea turns out to be rather drab and slow. Same with this movie, sorry to say. A brilliant IDEA ruined by bad writing - slow and tedious pace equals droopy eyes and eventually boredom. But I can't say the movie is a total loss. What keeps the interest here isn't the story, but the atmosphere. The director has done a good job keeping a disjointed feel to what you're seeing on the screen. Nothing is very steady, nothing looks pre-cooked or pre-planned. Almost a documentary style, as if they're capturing what's really going on rather than filming take after take like they do in many movies. Even if they DO a billion takes, it sure feels fresh.

If you've never seen a film writing by Kaufman I suggest you see it, if you have you should have been first in line.  What makes this story so unique is the fact that the premise is very simple.  You have a socially isolated man and a woman who is the complete opposite and they have a connection only to be lost in the midst of their every day lives.  When Joel Barish gets his memory erased from her is how the story is told.  We see all the memories they have had together through the erasing of his memory.  Now the audience embarks and a journey of dark and symbolic images that could only come from Kaufman.  The story is so simple yet so powerful that it's very hard to explain the meaning of each image that the film evokes.  The movie is a visionary masterpiece that will evoke emotion from the audience and leave a lasting impact.ACTING: This is Jim Carrey's most emotional and stunning performance.  I really hope he gets nominated for this come Oscar time, but with the movie opening so early that is highly unlikely.  Kate Winslet is fabulous as well, as a matter of fact the entire cast was sensational.  The only rotten egg here was Kirsten Dunst.  I felt that her performance was too forced, too blocky if you know what I mean.  I mean, you really got the impression that she was acting, and that shouldn't be.

The story revolves around Joel Barish/Jim Carrey who meets Clementine/Kate Winslet and thus begins their tumultuous relationship. They break up.  She gets her memories of him removed at Lacuna Inc. Joel finds out the hard way after a failed attempt at trying to reconcile their relationship to find she doesn't have any idea who he is and decides to have the procedure done too just to spite her.I too have posed the question of whether or not, if given the opportunity, I would have unpleasant memories erased.  The thing is, I think the story proved that you can erase the memory, but the idea will always be there (as is the case with both Celmentine/Joel as with Mary and Howard.)I loved the way Gondry shot the movie going in one instance at the bookstore Clementine works at and fading as Joel walks in the next room where he is visiting friends.  I know it's nothing revoluntionary, but it stood out for me.I must also admit, that these past few years, I've had a new grown respect for Jim Carrey as an actor.  When he first started out, he annoyed the living crap out of me with, what I felt, were pointless excuses for him to put $15 million in his pocket.  However, ever since ""The Truman Show"" he has chosen roles which are different from the ones we're used to.  This role, in particular, was interesting in that Joel Barish is a quiet introvert who pretty much keeps to himself which is, what I think, the total opposite of what we usually see with Jim Carrey.The rest of the cast, did an excellent job as well.  It took me a while to adapt to Elijah Wood's turn as a stalker type of character who stole Joel's possessions which reminded him of Clementine in order to woo her.  However, it was welcomed considering that I spent the last 3 years watching him as a humble hobbit.If you're a fan of Kaufman, don't waste any time, go see this movie.

Carrey turns in the performance of his career here, eclipsing even ""The Truman Show"".  He is restrained and believable, doesn't try to hog the screen and never once pulls a funny face.  While Adam Sandler's attempts to ""go straight"" have never really captured the imagination, Carrey pulls it off here with style and aplomb.The master plot is all but given away by the trailers and reviews, but it doesn't really matter - within the first 4 minutes there's certain clues and spoilers that give it away anyway.  However, this movie is more about the wild ride than the final destination. The subplots twist and turn, the timeline jumps around in a way not seen since ""Memento"", the camera work appears handheld and shaky, adding to the dream-like quality of the movie, while the special effects, (people disappearing mid frame), and especially the sound effects (disembodied voices from the present appearing in memories of the past) mean that this movie has to be seen in the theatre to be truly appreciated.I've always been a little turned off by Charlie Kaufman's scripts - too self aware, too postmodern- writing ones-self into the screenplay? Twice? Too self indulgent.  This movie seems to start off like his own personal wet dream - A nice, sensitive, budding artist meets a hot, crazy arty girl on a train and she then repeatedly comes on to him even though he's too shy to respond to her advances? Besides, how many other movie writers can you name?  Thankfully the (loooong) opening sets up the film, rather than defining it - it gets much, much better so bear with it!I won't spoil the plot for you, but the sci-fi memory-removal stuff works really well as a metaphor for breaking up with a lover.  Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? That's the real question the movie addresses, and if you've ever asked yourself that you should go see this movie!P.S.

It has been labelled as a ""romantic-comedy"" in nearly every other review, but I do not see it that way. Romantic, yes, but comedy, no. Although it has some humorous aspects, it is more a drama with tinges of fantasy and low-key science fiction. This movie can be partially described with ""uns"":Un-conventional -Odd use of lighting which is very harsh in many instances, including a lot of use of a single spotlight. Sets with forced-perspective. Snow-covered beaches.Un-usual -Odd subject matter (erasing memories). Fantasy transitions between sets - one example is Jim Carrey exits a bookstore directly into a friend's apartment. Transitions to past/present/future within a relationship. In one scene, Carry is playing two versions of his character in the same scene, requiring him to quickly change clothes behind the camera.Un-characteristic -Kate Winslet (with American accent) plays the typical Jim Carrey-type extroverted role, while usual physical-comedian Jim Carrey's character is somber and introverted.Un-predictableYou don't know what is coming next.This is a complex movie that will reward the viewer with new details on multiple screenings.

At the train station waiting for the train Joel gets the impulsive feeling to call in sick and leave for an unknown destination.  The destination is Montauk, a place that seems familiar, yet unknown to Joel who wanders the beach where he sees a girl with blue hair and visits a porch of a beach house a the middle of February.  Disoriented Joel returns to the train station where he encounters the girl with blue hair, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), who initiates a small conversation with Joel.  The conversation leads them closer to one another as they spend the remaining day and evening together.Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind is a cerebral journey, pun intended, as the audience will be somewhat disoriented if attention is not kept on the screen.  Clementine and Joel seem to have a history together, and the company Lacuna Inc. ([...]) seems to be the parallel that connects the two.  Lacuna is a company that focuses on destruction of the brain, i.e., erasing memories.  It happens to be that both Clementine and Joel have done business with  Lacuna.The story between Clementine and Joel brings the audience an intricate tale where the past feebly attempts to hide in the darkest and narrowest corner of the mind.  It is a ingenious tale created by Charlie Kaufman, who is also known for Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, where he combines cognitive psychology and love.  This combination turns out to be a well directed, sublimely edited, brilliantly performed, and an exceptional script that together brings the audience a truly unique cinematic experience that will cause both bewilderment and astonishment in the audience.",5,An Astonishing & Bewildering Cinematic Experience...,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1783,"['quiet', 'introvert', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'feeling', 'weather', 'work', 'everyday', 'train', 'station', 'waiting', 'train', 'Joel', 'impulsive', 'feeling', 'call', 'sick', 'leave', 'unknown', 'destination', 'destination', 'Montauk', 'place', 'familiar', 'yet', 'unknown', 'Joel', 'who', 'beach', 'where', 'girl', 'blue', 'hair', 'porch', 'beach', 'house', 'middle', 'February', 'Disoriented', 'Joel', 'returns', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'girl', 'blue', 'hair', 'Clementine', 'Kruczynski', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'small', 'conversation', 'Joel', 'conversation', 'closer', 'one', 'spend', 'remaining', 'day', 'evening', 'together.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'cerebral', 'journey', 'pun', 'intended', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disoriented', 'attention', 'not', 'kept', 'screen', 'Clementine', 'Joel', 'seem', 'have', 'history', 'together', 'company', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.', '[', ']', 'be', 'parallel', 'two', 'Lacuna', 'company', 'destruction', 'brain', 'i.e.', 'erasing', 'memories', 'be', 'Clementine', 'Joel', 'have', 'done', 'business', 'Lacuna.The', 'story', 'Clementine', 'Joel', 'audience', 'intricate', 'tale', 'where', 'past', 'feebly', 'hide', 'darkest', 'narrowest', 'corner', 'mind', 'ingenious', 'tale', 'created', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'also', 'known', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'where', 'cognitive', 'psychology', 'love', 'combination', 'out', 'be', 'well', 'directed', 'sublimely', 'edited', 'brilliantly', 'performed', 'exceptional', 'script', 'together', 'audience', 'truly', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'cause', 'bewilderment', 'astonishment', 'audience']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Not only is it one of the best films of 2004 but it's probably one of the best films within the last decade. It's absolutely amazing. Jim Carrey and Charlie Kaufman are at their very best in this brilliant piece of cinematic art. This is my second viewing today (My first was at the theaters about 6 months ago) and I don't think I could ever get tired of it. Kaufman, your Oscar is coming. Hopefully the Academy won't be dumb enough to ignore this one.Jim Carrey, in one of his most subtle and best performances of his carrer, plays Joel, a quiet and mousey man who buries himself in writing a bunch of journal entries of his ""not very interesting"" life (Which explains why there's several blanks). But then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free-spirited but rather impulsive woman who changes colors of her hair that depict her many different moods. They epitomize the ""opposites attract"" phrase because Joel's shy and Clementine's energetic and talky. They're immediately attracted to eachother which leads to a long-term relationship that ends rather badly. Joel's heartbroken beyond belief after an encounter with Clementine when she acts as if she's never seen him before in her life. Confused and ultimately sad, he then realizes that she has had her memory erased of him over at a clinic called Lacuna, which specialzes in erasing the memories of a certain person in the patients minds that upsets them. Joel desperately decides to participate. But is this really what he wants? Do you seriously not want to remember your past girlfriends/boyfriends?Director Michael Gondry, creates rather surreal imagery and deja-vu that brings you inside the mind of Joel's memories, which he is gradually losing. The visuals are innovative on his memory loss. People begin disappear, surroundings begin to break apart, Joel's brought into a new memory in an instant (Some of his childhood, which are some of the most bittersweet and amusing parts of the film), etc. But the props of the film go to Charlie Kaufman. I am just obsessed with Kaufman and I think he is, along with David Mamet, the best screenwriter in Hollywood.  I never thought any of the brilliance and complexity of ""Adaptation"" would ever be topped,  but ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is his best work to date.  As for Carrey, his performance was wonderfully subtle compared to his previous work. He portrays Joel as a quiet and melancholy individual and that's a different turn for Carrey since he's known for playing maniacal or goofy characters from ""The Cable Guy"" and ""Dumb & Dumber."" Not the least bit of overacting in this performance. So if you're the usual Carrey fan, I wouldn't recommend it. But as for film buffs, definitely recommended. It's moving, it's sad, it's funny and it's brilliant.

Bad relationship so poof- it is gone out of your mind.  Nothing to learn from.  No memory of the mistakes retained.Jim Carrey's character (Joel) is dating Kate Winslet's character (Clementine) and they are having a rocky relationship.  He learns that she has gone to a doctor to have him and their relationship erased from her mind and he decides to do the same.  However, during the procedure, he changes his mind and tries to retain his memories of her.As I said, the premise was interesting but I did nt like the movie.  I guess it just did not click for me.  Also, the way the movie skipped around from past happenings to the current days to Jim Carrey's character's hallucinations during the erasing procedure were a bit jarring for me.I did not see any performance worthy of an Oscar which is probably why Kate Winslet did not win.  However, I did give the movie three stars due to the work of Kirsten Dunst.

620235,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMJG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","To consider the position of Charlie Kaufman in the Hollywood universe look at the career M. Night Shyamalan.  Once you successfully trick your audience in a film they laugh and then demand that you do it again...and again...and again.  Shyamalan's latest film, ""The Village,"" got trashed by a lot of people because it did the surprises were not good enough.  Having written ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation,"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" and facing the daunting prospect of doing it again, Kaufman came up with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  To be fair, the idea came was given to Kaufman by director Michel Gondry, who got from his friend, the artist Pierre Bismuth, the idea of getting a card in the mail that says ""You have been erased from someone's memory.""  But it was Kaufman who came up with the story.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is much more of a love story than anything Kaufman has written before, even with the writer's twisted view.  The title is taken from Alexander Pope's poem ""Eloisa to Abelard,"" and the story is of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) is not merely pretending not to know who he is, but has actually had her memories of him wiped clean.  After going through brief periods of disbelief and outrage, Joel demands that Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) wipe his memory as well.  But while he is going through the process and he relives the memories that are being erased, Joel has second thoughts.  However, since he is ""under"" the process what can he do to save his precious memories?Most of this movie takes place while Joel undergoes the process.  The procedure is taking place at an apartment rather than at the office, where Joel is supposed to be monitored by a pair of Mierzwiak's assistants.  However, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) is too busy jumping around on the bed with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) while they are both in their underwear.  Meanwhile, Patrick (Elijah Wood) has gotten a crush on Clementine and is using some of Joel's choice memories to impress her.  As his memories of the good times with Clementine are swept away one by one, Joel tries to find a way to fight back.  Then the Clementine of his memories suggests she take him into other memories where she never was so that they can hide out.  This is when Stan discovers that Joel has gone ""off the map"" and has to summon Dr. Mierzwiak to save the day.The attractive moral here is quite simple: love might be forgettable, but it is still indestructible.  Obviously this film is all about memories and the mind, but it also argues the importance of the heart.  You have to pay attention to this film because Joel Barish has become unstuck in his memories and once they start to fuse and merge things can get a bit confusing.  There are memories that are being remembered, altered, and forgotten, and sometimes they come fast and furious.  Still, I think that having cut our teeth on ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Memento,"" and other films that play fast and loose with the idea of narrative chronology, audiences are more willing to except the roller coaster ride of this 2004 film than they would have a decade ago.Carey's performance is one of his best.  We know full well that he can do dramatic roles, but this time he is doing a markedly better job of stripping away even more of his standard mannerisms and vocal affectations, so that you have no trouble thinking this is Joel.  I actually enjoy his dramatic films more than his wild and crazy guy efforts, so I hope the actor finds the positive responses to this role encouraging.  The character of Clementine is a free spirit, but since Winslet is playing her there is a sense of weight that you would not get with another actress (e.g., Kate Hudson).  That becomes a key reason for us to hope these two find each other again, even if they do not remember who the other one is any more.  But in the end it is Kaufman's story that carries this film, which is one of the most unusual love stories you will have ever seen.  You can only wonder what Kaufman will come up with next (no idea of the plot, but the director will be Spike Jonze again as it was on ""Adaptation"").",5,Some memories are too important to just forget...,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,4211,"['consider', 'position', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Hollywood', 'universe', 'look', 'career', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Once', 'successfully', 'trick', 'audience', 'film', 'laugh', 'then', 'demand', 'do', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'film', 'Village', 'got', 'trashed', 'lot', 'people', 'did', 'surprises', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Having', 'written', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'facing', 'daunting', 'prospect', 'doing', 'again', 'Kaufman', 'came', 'up', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'be', 'fair', 'idea', 'came', 'was', 'given', 'Kaufman', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'who', 'got', 'friend', 'artist', 'Pierre', 'Bismuth', 'idea', 'getting', 'card', 'mail', 'have', 'been', 'erased', 'someone', 'memory', 'was', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'story', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'much', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'anything', 'Kaufman', 'written', 'even', 'writer', 'twisted', 'view', 'title', 'taken', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'poem', 'Eloisa', 'Abelard', 'story', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Clementine', 'Kruczynski', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'not', 'merely', 'pretending', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'actually', 'had', 'memories', 'wiped', 'clean', 'going', 'brief', 'periods', 'disbelief', 'outrage', 'Joel', 'Dr.', 'Howard', 'Mierzwiak', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'wipe', 'memory', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'process', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'erased', 'Joel', 'second', 'thoughts', 'However', 'process', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'save', 'precious', 'memories', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'Joel', 'process', 'procedure', 'taking', 'place', 'apartment', 'rather', 'office', 'where', 'Joel', 'supposed', 'be', 'monitored', 'pair', 'Mierzwiak', 'assistants', 'However', 'Stan', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'too', 'busy', 'jumping', 'around', 'bed', 'Mary', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'are', 'underwear', 'Meanwhile', 'Patrick', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'gotten', 'crush', 'Clementine', 'using', 'Joel', 'choice', 'memories', 'impress', 'memories', 'good', 'times', 'Clementine', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'one', 'one', 'Joel', 'find', 'way', 'fight', 'back', 'Then', 'Clementine', 'memories', 'take', 'other', 'memories', 'where', 'never', 'was', 'so', 'can', 'hide', 'out', 'when', 'Stan', 'Joel', 'gone', 'map', 'summon', 'Dr.', 'Mierzwiak', 'save', 'day.The', 'attractive', 'moral', 'here', 'quite', 'simple', 'love', 'might', 'be', 'forgettable', 'still', 'indestructible', 'Obviously', 'film', 'memories', 'mind', 'also', 'importance', 'heart', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'become', 'unstuck', 'memories', 'once', 'start', 'fuse', 'merge', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'confusing', 'are', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'remembered', 'altered', 'forgotten', 'sometimes', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'Still', 'think', 'having', 'cut', 'teeth', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Memento', 'other', 'films', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'idea', 'narrative', 'chronology', 'audiences', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', '2004', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'decade', 'ago.Carey', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'can', 'do', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'time', 'doing', 'markedly', 'better', 'job', 'stripping', 'away', 'even', 'more', 'standard', 'mannerisms', 'vocal', 'affectations', 'have', 'trouble', 'thinking', 'Joel', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'dramatic', 'films', 'more', 'wild', 'crazy', 'guy', 'efforts', 'hope', 'actor', 'positive', 'responses', 'role', 'encouraging', 'character', 'Clementine', 'free', 'spirit', 'Winslet', 'playing', 'sense', 'weight', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'actress', 'e.g.', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'key', 'reason', 'hope', 'two', 'find', 'other', 'again', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'other', 'one', 'more', 'end', 'Kaufman', 'story', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'love', 'stories', 'will', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'Kaufman', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'idea', 'plot', 'director', 'will', 'be', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'again', 'was', 'Adaptation']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620236,A17CTW1EJ0E94J,B00005JMJG,L. Clem,"[4, 6]","I love this movie! It was so ingenius and clever. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give amazing perfomances. At first I thought maybe the actors were too old to be playing these characters that seem too young and crazy, but I think they pulled it off perfectly. I've read in movie reviews that there was a lack of chemistry between the two, but I think they compliment each other nicely and you can tell that they love each other.Okay so Carrey plays Joel, this sweet and somewhat boring guy who meets Clementine, this amazingly off beat woman with colored hair. She's crazy, he's crazy, so they get together! It's very cute and it seems to have this ""Garden State"" tone.The whole movie mostly consists in Joel's head when these tech guys come and try to erase his Clementine memories. I was reading another review that said how this movie really isn't that great if you take away all the special effects, which is true, but the effects are apart of the movie and it makes it great. The scenes where Joel is trying to hide Clementine are so cutesy and they work well. It's a very interesting concept, the ability to erase memories and it's a clever theme for the movie.There's a twist later on when we learn that Kirsten Dunst's character, Mary, the receptionist at the memory wiping company, has also had her memories erased. It was a nice shocker. So Mary had her memories of the memory erasing doctor erased after a bad relationship and now she's overcome by confusion. She, realizing how much she regrets it, sends back all these files explaining everything to everyone.It's confusing, but once you think it over, it clicks.This is an amazing movie that you should watch at least once. It's clever, funny, cute, smart, and amazingly awesome.

It's unique, quirky, funny, romantic, sad, and simply fascinating.One of the movie's masterstrokes was the way that time was handled.  If you don't already know, Joel (Jim Carrey) decides to have the memory of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine - Kate Winslet) erased after she did the same to him.  Most of the movie takes place in his memories as they are being erased.  However, the memories are erased in reverse-chronological order.  So it starts with these very negative memories about their breakup which only confirm the need for the operation.  Then, as he travels back in time through more positive memories, he realizes how much he still loves her and he changes his mind about the operation.  Of course, since he's asleep, he has trouble figuring out a way to do that.  If the movie had shown their relationship go from good to bad, then it would not have been near as touching.  Here we get to see that no matter how bad things seem, there are always good memories and the love is still inside somewhere.  Both hopelessness and the feeling of love build up concurrently making the film a very intense emotional experience.  The last memories (chronologically the first) were unbelievably touching.Another thing that made this film great was the dialogue.  In modern films, it is rare to see dialogue so eloquent.  If you like classic movies, then this may be your film.  The dialogue was one of the reasons that the scene in the beachhouse moved me so much.The music needs mention too.  The soundtrack is amazing and very emotional.  My favorites are the song played during the opening and closing credits and the song that was played backwards (fitting, huh?) before, during, and after the beachhouse scene.If you haven't seen this movie, do so immediately.  It is so unique and very touching.  It also has some nice comedic moments although the film is more of a ""Twilight Zone"" romance than a comedy.  Being an image-conscious male, the number of movies that made me cry I can count on one hand.

But can it work in a film?Well, Charlie Kaufman, who wrote Being John Malkovich wrote the screenplay and he's somewhat of a creative genius.  And Focus Features, the specialty unit of Universal Pictures that brought us Lost in Translation, Swimming Pool, The Pianist and Far From Heaven is producing it.  Then take Jim Carrey who is ready for a serious role and Kate Winslet who has won her share of acting accolades, add an excellent supporting cast and put some big bucks into creative editing and cinematography and the result is clearly one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen.As I watched the film, I was totally confused.  Where was the beginning, middle and end?  There's a romance going one between Winslet and Carrey.  But how much is happening in the present, how much has happened in the past, and how much is a distorted memory?  At first I was annoyed.  I like linear stories.  I like to know where I am in time and space.  But there's no comfort of this sort in the film.And yet, I loved the characters.  Even the supporting characters who were cast as employees of a company that specialized in erasing memories.  Mark Ruffalo, who I have come to appreciate for the range of his acting ability, is cast as a geek technician. Kisten Durst is cast as the receptionist and Tom Wilkinson is cast as the doctor who is willing to admit that memory erasure procedure is, in reality, brain damage.Some might view this as a comedy, and, indeed there are several funny moments.  But even though the film might be whimsical at times, it has a serious theme.  And the way it is put together, it is almost impossible to understand what is happening until after the film.  While it is going on there just isn't time for reflection.  Instead, as a subtext I found myself reliving some of my own memories.  They flashed though my mind in concert with what was happening on the screen.Some of the scenes in the film annoyed me, others were crafted with great subtlety and sensitivity.  If I, myself, were editing it, I would have eliminated the Alice In Wonderland-style shrinking into childhood scenes.  But yet, I'm aware that they added another layer of perspective.The ending made the film worthwhile because it resolved what at first seemed disjointed.

They find out that even though they try to control their thoughts which is also their feelings or vice versa it still doesn't really change who they are. They erase their relationship and connection but they do it all over again anyway. Maybe the erasing helped them to grow because they found out about it.

620244,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B00005JMJG,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[2, 12]","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an intriguing title, kind of surreal and postmodernist.  The film's premise is also intriguing: you can have painful memories of a bad relationship erased; but once you make that choice, you may not want to go through with it.Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who has given us Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Eternal Sunshine.  Stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wonderful, as are all the supporting cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst (at last breaking out of her Mary Jane role!).  Carrey plays Joel, an introverted man in love with impulsive blue/green/red-haired Clementine, played by Kate Winslet.  I have to say, her American accent is scarily perfect (Are we that easily imitated?  I will have to work on my British accent).Joel and Clem are very different people, and their differences soon begin to rub the relationship raw.  Clementine decides to have her memories erased at a company called Lacuna.  From this point on, the film becomes more confusing, convoluted, and complicated than intriguing.The film's basic message is as Carrey put it in the extras:  you can't help but love who you love.  You can make it work despite your differences.  It may sound profound, but it is not.  Joel is dreary and boring, Clementine is shallow and silly.  To put viewers through all this to arrive at this message makes trying to understand the movie more work than entertainment.  After I watched the film with my husband, I was so frustrated as to why the film had two completely different beginnings, and why the end was so confusing, that I watched the entire film again with commentary.  I just wanted to relax for a couple of hours, but this ended up like a study session, work, not fun.In the extras, even Jim Carrey says he and Winslet had to ""constantly ask in what time frame"" they were doing a scene.  Kaufman comments that many people told him the film was ""too complicated,"" but he basically shrugs and brushes them off.  The French director casually mentions that viewers will ""get it the second . . . third . . . or fourth time they see it.""  Hey, I don't know about you, but I don't like to pay to have my intelligence insulted.  Another thing that was unrealistic is that Clementine had outrageous, brightly-colored hair, but tasteful, demure, professionally applied makeup.To look at a different movie with a secret, many saw the Sixth Sense and didn't ""get it.""  But that movie's twist was truly original, and big.  Eternal Sunshine is just about two people who are attracted to each other, but who lack relationship skills.  If Joel and Clem were your downstairs neighbors, you would be like ""oh, God, THAT COUPLE is fighting again!!!"" To look at Clementine, she wasn't a very likeable character.  Several times in the film she boozes it up, and crows ""Yay, ALCOHOL!"" I have a friend who is an alcoholic, and I don't think Clementine's borderline alcoholism is funny or endearing.  Clementine is also impulsive and reckless, even dragging Joel onto a frozen lake.  That is dangerous.  Clementine is cute, but she only lives for the moment.How many friends or relatives do you have who are in a bad relationship, and whine to you over the phone about it until you want to scream?  How many bad relationships have you been in?  Are you in one now?  There is nothing profound about the basic message of this film if you are looking at these two characters, Joel and Clementine.",4,"Complicated Movie, Too Simple Message",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,3484,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'intriguing', 'title', 'kind', 'surreal', 'postmodernist', 'film', 'premise', 'also', 'intriguing', 'can', 'have', 'painful', 'memories', 'bad', 'relationship', 'erased', 'make', 'choice', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'it.Screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'given', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Stars', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'last', 'breaking', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'role', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'introverted', 'man', 'love', 'impulsive', 'blue/green/red-haired', 'Clementine', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'have', 'say', 'American', 'accent', 'scarily', 'perfect', 'Are', 'easily', 'imitated', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'British', 'accent', '.Joel', 'Clem', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'differences', 'soon', 'begin', 'rub', 'relationship', 'raw', 'Clementine', 'have', 'memories', 'erased', 'company', 'called', 'Lacuna', 'point', 'film', 'more', 'confusing', 'convoluted', 'complicated', 'intriguing.The', 'film', 'basic', 'message', 'Carrey', 'put', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'who', 'love', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'differences', 'may', 'sound', 'profound', 'not', 'Joel', 'dreary', 'boring', 'Clementine', 'shallow', 'silly', 'put', 'viewers', 'arrive', 'message', 'trying', 'understand', 'movie', 'more', 'work', 'entertainment', 'watched', 'film', 'husband', 'was', 'so', 'frustrated', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'beginnings', 'why', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'confusing', 'watched', 'entire', 'film', 'again', 'commentary', 'just', 'wanted', 'relax', 'couple', 'hours', 'ended', 'up', 'study', 'session', 'work', 'not', 'fun.In', 'extras', 'even', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Winslet', 'had', 'constantly', 'ask', 'what', 'time', 'frame', 'were', 'doing', 'scene', 'Kaufman', 'comments', 'many', 'people', 'told', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'complicated', 'basically', 'shrugs', 'brushes', 'off', 'French', 'director', 'casually', 'mentions', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'see', 'Hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pay', 'have', 'intelligence', 'insulted', 'thing', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'Clementine', 'had', 'outrageous', 'brightly-colored', 'hair', 'tasteful', 'demure', 'professionally', 'applied', 'makeup.To', 'look', 'different', 'movie', 'secret', 'many', 'saw', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'twist', 'was', 'truly', 'original', 'big', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'just', 'about', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'who', 'lack', 'relationship', 'skills', 'Joel', 'Clem', 'were', 'downstairs', 'neighbors', 'would', 'be', 'oh', 'God', 'THAT', 'COUPLE', 'fighting', 'again', 'look', 'Clementine', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'Several', 'times', 'film', 'up', 'Yay', 'ALCOHOL', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Clementine', 'borderline', 'alcoholism', 'funny', 'endearing', 'Clementine', 'also', 'impulsive', 'reckless', 'even', 'dragging', 'Joel', 'frozen', 'lake', 'dangerous', 'Clementine', 'cute', 'only', 'moment.How', 'many', 'friends', 'relatives', 'do', 'have', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'relationship', 'whine', 'phone', 'want', 'scream', 'How', 'many', 'bad', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'Are', 'one', 'now', 'nothing', 'profound', 'basic', 'message', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'two', 'characters', 'Joel', 'Clementine']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620246,A2B663RLH19RH8,B00005JMJG,LnKnProphets,"[5, 6]","Wow...where to start?  First of all, the plot is ingenious and so original.  It may seem like just another love story at first, but once you get into the movie, you realize that this is so much more than a love story.  It is a revelation of how important our memories are and how despite our wanting to be rid of some, they can never be undone and will shape the person we become.Next, the acting is incredible.  I will never look at Jim Carrey the same way.  While he proved he can play a character other than a quirky dimwit in The Majestic, he has really outdone himself as the somewhat soft-spoken Joel.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets an Oscar nod.  His performance was that good.  Kate Winslet also did an awesome job as the free-spirited and impulsive Clementine.  You can't even tell she has an English accent in real life!  Dunst, Ruffalo, Wood, etc., completed the amazing ensemble.  However, Carrey and Winslet shine in this movie.Finally, this is the kind of movie where you have to really pay attention in order to understand everything, which I love about it.  The movie bounces back and forth between Joel's memories and what's happening in real-time, so it is definitely not for those who need a sequential movie.  However, if you pay attention, everything will come together.I can't say enough positive things about this movie.  I would say this is one of the best films of 2004, and I would be very disappointed if the film didn't get any Oscar nods.

He (Boston guy) swooned over Kate Winslet and said that the concept was ridiculous. I, on the other hand, wished such a medical technology could be invented, perfected, patented, and commercialized NOW. Freeing up all sorts of support groups and therapist offices from the heartbroken and lovelorn in just one delete button to our brain. Love sears the brain no doubt. And when it goes sour it really drives us somewhat mental. But really .... would you truly want to erase the memories with someone you loved? My verdict - NO. Painful as it is these memories are still very sacred and that person very special. I still would have erased Boston guy (and New Jersey blind date guy from the previous year) in the click of a mouse but never the Toronto guy who came as a complete and welcome surprise a long while later after my Massachussetts episode.Joel and Clementine have their moments as a couple. Their breakup is pretty dramatic and before he knows it Celemtine has impulsively had her memory bank erased to get over Joel. In his desperation Joel seeks to do the same but somehow during the process ... he fights for every last bit of memory. He still wakes up ""clear"" of Clementine but fate has other plans and they meet that afternoon and start all over again. The dream sequence as Joel resists the process are psychedelic and poignant. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a touching lesson for all of us ... if love is a battlefield (quoting Pat Benetar) having battlescars is nothing to be ashamed of.

This movie was crafted very carefully, so don't be suprised if you spend the rest of the evening trying to figure it out! And when you do, it will certainly impact you.There are a number of things I really don't like about this movie, but I think it does bring out some very pertinent issues and raises a number of important questions. Some of them include: To what extent can the mind be tampered with? What role does manipulation play in relationships? How does easy access to technology change human relationships? Is there a difference between the ""mind"" and the physical ""brain""? Is there any sort of consciousness that trancends the physical aspects of the brain? Are we comfortable enough with mind-altering technology to entrust the manipulation of our brain to a particular company or organization? Is there a distinction between reality and fantasy, existence and non-existence, and if so--how can we know it?In some ways this film is horror. Why? Because our society, technologically and ethically speaking is not on a much different level. We (society in general) lack a sufficient moral and ethical basis that would give us form (limitations) that would prevent the If-We-Can-Do-It-We-Will-Do attitude that is often prevelant in technological development. Freedom without form is an invitation to disaster. The question of whether X or Y or Z is harmful or immoral becomes a moot point when society has determined that something is in its reach and finds no sufficient basis in its worldview for moral absolutes. This film is a stark portrayal of this.One thing of note about this movie is that this is an atypical role for Jim Carey.

620256,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B00005JMJG,maskirovka,"[1, 1]","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" still holds --five years after its release-- a triple honor in my view.  It's the most beautiful love story I have ever seen or read.  It's the movie that has caused me think the most about love and relationships.  And hands down, it's just the best movie I've seen in my life to date.  I love it enough that I almost wish that a company like Lacuna really did exist, so I could erase my memory of having seen it and have the joy of watching it again for the first time.  It's that good.&lt;spoilers>But the funny thing is that I might not have bothered to see it when it came out. When I first saw the trailer for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I found myself wondering if it was another Jim Carrey comedic vehicle in which he'd overact and effectively ruin any humor I might find in it.  Part of this suspicion was driven by the fact that music for trailer (which was not used in the film) was a extremely cheerful song called ""Mr. Blue Sky.""But my curiosity was piqued by the film and the premise of memory erasure, and when I looked at an early draft of the shooting script that was online I saw pretty soon that it wasn't some unsubtle comedy but something a lot deeper...in fact, I wondered if seeing might even be a downer given the rather bleak ending that the script had (where Joel and Clementine were ""doomed"" to endlessly meet, fall in love, fall out of love, and have their memories erased.""But I decided to take a chance and see it, and I'm very glad I did because it was a wonderful film...I feel about it the same way that some people feel about ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind.""  Why did I like it so much?  I came up with eight reasons:1.  Kate Winslet as Clementine:  I salute Kate Winslet and thank her for bringing to life a female character I instantly fell in love with.2.  Jim Carrey as Joel:  He did a great job and showed that he's more than a clown in depicting the character, who was sort of an everyman whose shoes I could see myself in.3.  Beautiful Story:  It was all about love, loss, memory with tenderness, passion, humor, and insight.  The scenes of the happy moments Joel and Clementine had are touching and totally authentic.4.  Fantastic Premise:  The premise of memory erasure and how that might work is just loaded with philosophical and moral questions that are well worth pondering.5.  Ingenious Use of Camera and Special Effects:  The movie is full of clever uses of the camera by Michel Gondry and none of it is overdone.  I see something new every time I watch it.6.  Solid Supporting Cast:  Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Woods all made their characters memorable and sympathetic (even Woods as Patrick who would have easily come across as REALLY creepy but instead comes across as just pitiable).7.  Beautiful, Real, and Upbeat Ending:  It would have been such a downer if the movie had ended the way Charlie Kaufman originally wrote it, and the idea that Joel and Clementine would have just fallen into each others' arms after the enormity of what had happened had struck home would have been unrealistic.  The idea that they were going to give things ""another go round"" was realistic but hopeful.8.  Beautiful Images:  There are many in the movie, in particular Joel and Clementine on the frozen Charles, a pensive Clementine pondering her relationship with Joel, and the scene in the bookstore where the books gradually fade to white as the memory vanishes.&lt;comments about the DVD itself>It's an excellent two disk collection of materials.  About the only thing I did not like was the music video by Polyphonic Spree which puts animated mouths on the characters in various scenes of the movie...it comes across as creepy.  There are a lot of deleted scenes included as well, which make interesting watching.This is definitely the DVD set to have if you loved ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  I just wish now that they would release a special ""Director's Cut"" that incorporates some of the deleted scenes.&lt;Summing Up>I could go on and on about what a great movie this is, but I think I've said enough.  If you want a simple formulaic romantic comedy with glamorous leads and a totally predictable outcome, don't bother with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  But if you want a film that has tenderness, beauty, humor, and is unbelievably creative with a ""real"" ending that is hopeful and not synthetic, by all means rent, borrow, or buy this movie.",5,"Beautiful, Funny, Clever, Heartfelt...In a Word ""Great""",1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,4495,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'still', 'five', 'years', 'release', 'triple', 'honor', 'view', 'most', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'read', 'movie', 'caused', 'think', 'most', 'love', 'relationships', 'down', 'just', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'life', 'date', 'love', 'almost', 'wish', 'company', 'Lacuna', 'really', 'did', 'exist', 'could', 'erase', 'memory', 'having', 'seen', 'have', 'joy', 'watching', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'good.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'funny', 'thing', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'found', 'wondering', 'was', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedic', 'vehicle', ""'d"", 'overact', 'effectively', 'ruin', 'humor', 'might', 'find', 'Part', 'suspicion', 'was', 'driven', 'fact', 'music', 'trailer', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'cheerful', 'song', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued', 'film', 'premise', 'memory', 'erasure', 'when', 'looked', 'early', 'draft', 'shooting', 'script', 'was', 'online', 'saw', 'pretty', 'soon', 'was', ""n't"", 'unsubtle', 'comedy', 'something', 'lot', 'deeper', 'fact', 'wondered', 'seeing', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'downer', 'given', 'rather', 'bleak', 'ending', 'script', 'had', 'where', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'were', 'doomed', 'endlessly', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'memories', 'erased', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'see', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'feel', 'Casablanca', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Why', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'came', 'up', 'eight', 'reasons:1', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Clementine', 'salute', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'thank', 'bringing', 'life', 'female', 'character', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'with.2', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showed', 'more', 'clown', 'depicting', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'sort', 'everyman', 'shoes', 'could', 'see', 'in.3', 'Beautiful', 'Story', 'was', 'love', 'loss', 'memory', 'tenderness', 'passion', 'humor', 'insight', 'scenes', 'happy', 'moments', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'had', 'are', 'touching', 'totally', 'authentic.4', 'Fantastic', 'Premise', 'premise', 'memory', 'erasure', 'how', 'might', 'work', 'just', 'loaded', 'philosophical', 'moral', 'questions', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'pondering.5', 'Ingenious', 'Use', 'Camera', 'Special', 'Effects', 'movie', 'full', 'clever', 'uses', 'camera', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'none', 'overdone', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'watch', 'it.6', 'Solid', 'Supporting', 'Cast', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Elijah', 'Woods', 'all', 'made', 'characters', 'memorable', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'Woods', 'Patrick', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'come', 'REALLY', 'creepy', 'instead', 'across', 'just', 'pitiable', '.7', 'Beautiful', 'Real', 'Upbeat', 'Ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'downer', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'way', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'originally', 'wrote', 'idea', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'fallen', 'others', 'arms', 'enormity', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'had', 'struck', 'home', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unrealistic', 'idea', 'were', 'going', 'give', 'things', 'go', 'round', 'was', 'realistic', 'hopeful.8', 'Beautiful', 'Images', 'are', 'many', 'movie', 'particular', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'frozen', 'Charles', 'pensive', 'Clementine', 'pondering', 'relationship', 'Joel', 'scene', 'bookstore', 'where', 'books', 'gradually', 'fade', 'white', 'memory', 'vanishes.', 'lt', 'comments', 'DVD', '>', 'excellent', 'two', 'disk', 'collection', 'materials', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'Polyphonic', 'Spree', 'animated', 'mouths', 'characters', 'various', 'scenes', 'movie', 'creepy', 'are', 'lot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'interesting', 'watching.This', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'loved', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'just', 'wish', 'now', 'would', 'release', 'special', 'Director', 'Cut', 'deleted', 'scenes.', 'lt', 'Summing', '>', 'could', 'go', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'think', ""'ve"", 'said', 'enough', 'want', 'simple', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'glamorous', 'leads', 'totally', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'want', 'film', 'tenderness', 'beauty', 'humor', 'unbelievably', 'creative', 'real', 'ending', 'hopeful', 'not', 'synthetic', 'means', 'rent', 'borrow', 'buy', 'movie']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620257,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JMJG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","As you may already know, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about two lovers who love each other despite the fact that they are rather mismatched. Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) decides she's unhappy in the relationship after yet another fight and goes to a company named Lacuna that specializes in erasing unwanted or unhappy memories from a person's mind. She wants to rid her memory of Joel. Joel (played by Jim Carrey) decides to do the same after he accidentally finds out his former girlfriend has had ""the procedure."" Unfortunately Joel decides too late--during the procedure--that he doesn't want to forget Clementine. He tries to retain some of his memories of her. Joel dreams of running away with Clementine from the memory erasing process during his sleep. The ending of the film has an unexpected happy twist: The office assistant sends all the patients' files back to them from Lacuna with the possibility that patients can then choose to regain at least some of their memories. Joel and Clementine meet in Joel's apartment and there seems to be hope that they will learn from their mistakes and try their luck at love again.At first the plot can be a bit confusing since the film alternates between flashbacks and the present. Nevertheless, the scenes are actually very carefully thought out and planned--even if you know the plot beforehand you can truly appreciate the movie anyway. The acting is very convincing. Many people have commented that both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey get to expand themselves in this film: Carrey plays a very shy guy who speaks little, while Winslet plays a loud mouthed free spirit. The cinematography is excellent and many of the character's emotions are so universal we can all relate to them: There is the longing to feel wanted by Joel throughout his life; and the freedom of acting on impulses in Clementine. Great performances are also turned in by Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as two inept Lacuna employees who don't do a very good job of monitoring Joel during the procedure to erase Clementine from Joel's mind. Although there are some mildly funny moments I would call this film a drama more than a comedy.The DVD comes with great extras including deleted scenes, a conversation between Jim Carrey and the director Michel Gondry, a brief TV commercial for Lacuna as well as a music video.This is a great film for adults; it's not a family film since it does have sex and drug scenes as well as language content. I believe this film is going to be one of the better films of this year and I highly recommend the DVD.

620258,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JMJG,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Movies are not always so easy to review because all movies are not created equally. Some are big budget ventures whose sole purpose is to entertain. These are relatively easy. Despite a critic's personal feelings, it fairly easy to see that, for example, ""Spiderman 2"" is a lot more bang for the buck than ""Lara Croft 2"".Movies like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are harder to write about because they aspire to be art. Whether or not they entertain in the conventional sense is of secondary importance. `Art' is such a subjective thing. When a reviewer uses words like `masterpiece', `genius' or `brilliant', a red flag is raised. The opinion becomes very subjective. To me, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is the most interesting American movie I have seen so far in 2004. It is also the best love story / romantic comedy I have watched in awhile. To you, the opposite may be true.The premise itself is simple. Joel [Jim Carrey] and Clementine [Kate Winslett], two eccentric people, meet and fall in love. They have a falling out, and Clementine resorts to a doctor [Tom Wilkinson] who knows how to erase all memory of Joel from her mind. Naturally, this leaves Joel dazed and confused. When he finds out the truth, the angry young man confronts the doctor and his staff. Forlorn and desperate, he takes the only logical course and has the doctor erase HIS memories of Clementine. The question then becomes whether or not true love can ever really be forgotten.The movie bounces wildly between past and present, between real memories and false ones. This is the way it loses some viewers because the plot is anything but linear.Since ""The Truman Show"", I've thought that Carrey is a remarkable actor who has been trapped by his ""I'm so funny"" reputation. He really should get a Best Actor Oscar nod for his work here. Kate Winslett is superb as Clementine. In supporting roles, Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Woods and Mark Ruffalo are outstanding.I think in years to come ""Eternal Sunshine"" will be rememberd as both a mesmerizing love story and as a sharp commentary on relationships is the early 21st Century.",5,An excellent love story / comedy,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,2113,"['Movies', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'easy', 'review', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'created', 'equally', 'are', 'big', 'budget', 'ventures', 'sole', 'purpose', 'entertain', 'are', 'relatively', 'easy', 'critic', 'personal', 'feelings', 'fairly', 'easy', 'see', 'example', 'Spiderman', '2', 'lot', 'more', 'bang', 'buck', 'Lara', 'Croft', '2', '.Movies', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'are', 'harder', 'write', 'about', 'aspire', 'be', 'art', 'Whether', 'not', 'entertain', 'conventional', 'sense', 'secondary', 'importance', 'Art', 'subjective', 'thing', 'When', 'reviewer', 'words', 'masterpiece', 'genius', 'brilliant', 'red', 'flag', 'raised', 'opinion', 'very', 'subjective', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'most', 'interesting', 'American', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', '2004', 'also', 'best', 'love', 'story', '/', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'watched', 'awhile', 'opposite', 'may', 'be', 'true.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'Joel', '[', 'Jim', 'Carrey', ']', 'Clementine', '[', 'Kate', 'Winslett', ']', 'two', 'eccentric', 'people', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'Clementine', 'doctor', '[', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', ']', 'who', 'how', 'erase', 'memory', 'Joel', 'mind', 'Naturally', 'Joel', 'dazed', 'confused', 'When', 'out', 'truth', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'doctor', 'staff', 'Forlorn', 'desperate', 'only', 'logical', 'course', 'doctor', 'erase', 'HIS', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'question', 'then', 'not', 'true', 'love', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'be', 'forgotten.The', 'movie', 'bounces', 'wildly', 'past', 'present', 'real', 'memories', 'false', 'ones', 'way', 'viewers', 'plot', 'anything', 'linear.Since', 'Truman', 'Show', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Carrey', 'remarkable', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'trapped', ""'m"", 'so', 'funny', 'reputation', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'work', 'here', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'superb', 'Clementine', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Wilkinson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Elijah', 'Woods', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'are', 'outstanding.I', 'think', 'years', 'come', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'will', 'be', 'rememberd', 'mesmerizing', 'love', 'story', 'sharp', 'commentary', 'relationships', 'early', '21st', 'Century']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620259,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B00005JMJG,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[11, 13]","The Film:I won't wax too rhapsodic about the movie itself. Others have done so effusively. I can say, without reservation, that this is my personal favorite film of all time. I have watched it a good 10 to 15 times, and it rewards me upon each viewing. I think it's one of the most affecting, well-observed, and *real* portrayals of a relationship ever committed to celluloid. The structure of the story is inordinately clever, and the performances are superb.The Blu-Ray:What I am reviewing here is the blu-ray edition. I have owned and watched the DVD since its release. So 14 of 15 viewings were in 480p, and now my 15th was in a new 1080p transfer. This is an upgrade, certainly. Detail, color, and contrast are quite a bit stronger than the DVD transfer. There is nothing that takes away from the presentation generally, such as edge enhancement or obtrusive Digital Noise Reduction. It is not competitive with some of the best Blu-Ray material on the market today, but this owes more to the soft, dreamy, somewhat hazy filming style, than to any technical deficiency of the disc. Don't get me wrong - this looks better than the best cable or satellite HD. It is just middling in terms of Blu-Rays. You shouldn't be getting this in order to ""demo"" your new A/V setup. You should be getting this because you love the movie.The extras are a direct port from the DVD. If it was there, it's here. None are upgraded to higher resolution, but this is to be expected. There are no new extras. The extras are quite good, it should be said (with the exception of the short EPK ""documentary""), so it's nice that none have been dropped.Conclusion:I gave this 4 stars because it's not the sort of ""home run"" upgrade that simply demands to be purchased no matter what editions you already own (DVD to BD upgrades in this category include 2001, Fight Club, Star Trek The Original Series). Instead, this is a competent Blu-Ray that, while it definitely improves on the previous transfer, is not the sort of revelatory experience that the aforementioned discs represent. The lack of new extras make this less of a value proposition, too.If you don't own it already, then definitely buy this one. If you are only a minor fan and own the DVD, stick with that. If you're a huge fan (as I am), then go ahead and get it, but wait for a good deal. I'm very happy with my purchase, but can't help but feel that this film might have deserved a bit more window-dressing.",4,***Blu-Ray Review*** - Worth the Upgrade?,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2450,"['Film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wax', 'too', 'rhapsodic', 'movie', 'Others', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'effusively', 'can', 'say', 'reservation', 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'have', 'watched', 'good', '10', '15', 'times', 'viewing', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'affecting', 'well-observed', '*real*', 'portrayals', 'relationship', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'structure', 'story', 'inordinately', 'clever', 'performances', 'are', 'superb.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'What', 'am', 'reviewing', 'here', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'have', 'owned', 'watched', 'DVD', 'release', 'So', '14', '15', 'viewings', 'were', '480p', 'now', '15th', 'was', 'new', '1080p', 'transfer', 'upgrade', 'certainly', 'Detail', 'color', 'contrast', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'stronger', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'away', 'presentation', 'generally', 'such', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'obtrusive', 'Digital', 'Noise', 'Reduction', 'not', 'competitive', 'best', 'Blu-Ray', 'material', 'market', 'today', 'more', 'soft', 'dreamy', 'somewhat', 'hazy', 'filming', 'style', 'technical', 'deficiency', 'disc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'better', 'best', 'cable', 'satellite', 'HD', 'just', 'middling', 'terms', 'Blu-Rays', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'order', 'demo', 'new', 'A/V', 'setup', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'love', 'movie.The', 'extras', 'are', 'direct', 'port', 'DVD', 'was', 'there', 'here', 'None', 'are', 'upgraded', 'higher', 'resolution', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'new', 'extras', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'exception', 'short', 'EPK', 'documentary', 'nice', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'dropped.Conclusion', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'sort', 'home', 'run', 'upgrade', 'simply', 'be', 'purchased', 'matter', 'what', 'already', 'own', 'DVD', 'BD', 'upgrades', 'category', 'include', '2001', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'Instead', 'competent', 'Blu-Ray', 'definitely', 'previous', 'transfer', 'not', 'sort', 'revelatory', 'experience', 'aforementioned', 'discs', 'represent', 'lack', 'new', 'extras', 'make', 'less', 'value', 'proposition', 'too.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'already', 'then', 'definitely', 'buy', 'one', 'are', 'only', 'minor', 'fan', 'own', 'DVD', 'stick', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'am', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'wait', 'good', 'deal', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'purchase', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'deserved', 'bit', 'more', 'window-dressing']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!"", says a poem. But how much truth can we find there?. What if we could erase our bad memories of a romance gone sour?. Would we be happier, or would we just lose the benefit of experience, and the good memories along with the bad ones?. Of course, posing these questions seems far-fetched, so strange that many people wouldn't even think about it if it weren't for the fact that ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" brings to the fore the possibility of starting anew, and not in a metaphorical sense :)That is as a matter of fact exactly what Clementine (Kate Winslet) does on an impulse, after a particularly awful fight with her boyfriend, Joel (Jim Carrey). Afterwards, Joel doesn't understand why Clementine pretends not to know him, until he discovers she has had an operation to ""erase"" him. When he confronts the doctor who performed the operation, he decides to undergo the same procedure. But as the operation begins, and his memories start to fade, Joel begins to realize that he wants to remember his good moments with Clementine, even if that means keeping the bad ones too. As a result, he endeavors to hide his memories with her in parts of his brain that weren`t supposed to be wiped by the machine that the doctor manipulates. But will he succeed?.There are some secondary characters that are quite interesting, for example the unethical technician (Elijah Wood) that helps to wipe memories, and that starts dating Clementine after her operation. However, the best thing this movie offers is the great performances given by Carrey as an introspective and shy Joel, and Winslet as a loveable yet really eccentric woman who changes the colour of her hair to suit her whims. The director (Michel Gondry) and the scriptwriter (Charlie Kaufman) also made a wonderful job of showing us the dynamics of Joel and Clementine's relationship, and of making the spectator believe that what was happening was real...On the whole, I can say that I loved this movie. The central themes are easy to relate to, because they have to do with feelings we all have experienced at some point in our lives: love, loss, anger, disappointment, the need to start all over again... ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" entertains you, but it also makes you think.

620261,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00005JMJG,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[2, 2]","The first 17 minutes or so of the movie shows Joel (Jim Carrey) waking up...going to work...and then freaking out. He has this sudden urge to rush to Montague (I'm not sure where that's at though). Joel is not the kinda of person that is spontaneous like that. But for some reason...he just has to go to Montague. He gets to a beach and sees a pretty girl in an orange sweater with blue hair. Being shy..he doesnt talk to her. But she notices him. When he is leaving Montague he notices that the girl is on the train with him now. The girl comes over and starts talking to him and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslett). They hit it off and spend the whole day together having a great and wonderful and exciting (especially for Joel) time.Then the title credits start to appear and Joel is crying his eyes out. We come to find out that when he goes into the store where Clementine works, she is completely ignoring him. So Joel is crushed and then his friends let him know what really happened. She erased him. Erased him from her mind. He's gone to her. So he's devastated and wants to do the same to her.And that's when the real movie begins in my opinion. As the doctor begins to erase his memories, Joel is remembering most of them at the same time. So he's witnessing his memories dissapearing right before him. We come to find out that he's had a long relationship with Clementine. One that seemed like it was really fun and had so much love with the occasional arguing that most couples in love have. As Joel is remembering and actually living out these memories again, he realizes he screwed up and he doesn't want to lose Clementine forever. So he tries to wake up but cant. So he does the next best thing... he tries to hide her in memories that she shouldn't belong in. All the while you are sitting and watching their relationship from Joel's memories and you just want to wake him up yourself and send him off to get Clementine back.This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie. They are opposites from each other. Joel is shy and Clementine is outgoing. Joel makes plans and Clementine is spontaneous. Joel is careful of his actions and Clementine is carefree. They both helped each other out. Clementine would help Joel have more fun in life, while Joel would help Clementine calm down just a tad. Many love stories have the same plot and the same fairy tale feel to it. This one didn't.The reason why I give this movie a 4 and not a 5 is that there were some things in the movie that I just thought were getting in the way. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst's role between her and the main doctor. I thought the way the movie ended was definitley cool, but I still wish I coulda seen more.I think everyone should at least watch this movie once.

620264,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B00005JMJG,Medusa,"[1, 1]","What an intriguing idea for a story, a man and woman meet, fall in love, fall out of love, have their memories of the whole love experience erased from their memories by a reverse brain mapping process.  Who among us would not jump at the possibility of erasing painful or unpleasant memories and then be able move on with our lives with no recollection of anything associated with the person we had wiped from our memory.The lead characters in the story Joel and Clementine meet and fall and love, but after a period of few years they have drifted apart.  Clementine discovers a doctor, who offers a service where he can erase memories of a particular person from your mind.  Part of the process of forgetting is remembering.  In order to map all the areas of the brain where the memories reside; the person wanting to forget has to collect all items associated with the person they are trying to forget.  These items are shown to the individual, who is trying to forget and as they view the object a map of brain's reaction to the stimulus is created.  Through the marvel of modern science this brain map is then used to execute a pinpoint destruction of the memories.  Clementine successfully undergoes this procedure and completely erases any memories of Joel.  Presumably, she is now free of the pain of a failed relationship.  Joel is now a complete stranger to Clementine.Later, Joel is told by a friend that Clementine has had all memories of him erased and he becomes interested in doing the same with his memories of Clementine.  We are then treated to the spectacle of Joel having all memories of Clementine zapped.  The erasing is done while Joel is sleeping and the ""technicians"" drink, party and mess around during the process, in a startling display of indifference to what is being done to this person.  Perhaps this is an indictment against the medical community that treats our mental anguish and discomfort with drugs or other means with a sort of detachment from what other damage may be inflicted on the individual.As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed.  Other memories from his childhood become more vivid and we can clearly see that all his memories work together to create the person that is Joel.  That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film.  We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche.  We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good.  Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own map",5,External Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: A thoughtful romantic story or a dark precautionary tale,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,2866,"['What', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'memories', 'whole', 'love', 'experience', 'erased', 'memories', 'reverse', 'brain', 'mapping', 'process', 'Who', 'would', 'not', 'jump', 'possibility', 'erasing', 'painful', 'unpleasant', 'memories', 'then', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'lives', 'recollection', 'anything', 'associated', 'person', 'had', 'wiped', 'memory.The', 'lead', 'characters', 'story', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'period', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'Clementine', 'doctor', 'who', 'service', 'where', 'can', 'erase', 'memories', 'particular', 'person', 'mind', 'Part', 'process', 'forgetting', 'remembering', 'order', 'map', 'areas', 'brain', 'where', 'memories', 'reside', 'person', 'wanting', 'forget', 'collect', 'items', 'associated', 'person', 'are', 'trying', 'forget', 'items', 'are', 'shown', 'individual', 'who', 'trying', 'forget', 'view', 'object', 'map', 'brain', 'reaction', 'stimulus', 'created', 'marvel', 'modern', 'science', 'brain', 'map', 'then', 'used', 'execute', 'pinpoint', 'destruction', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'successfully', 'procedure', 'completely', 'memories', 'Joel', 'Presumably', 'now', 'free', 'pain', 'failed', 'relationship', 'Joel', 'now', 'complete', 'stranger', 'Clementine.Later', 'Joel', 'told', 'friend', 'Clementine', 'had', 'memories', 'erased', 'becomes', 'interested', 'doing', 'same', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'spectacle', 'Joel', 'having', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'zapped', 'erasing', 'done', 'Joel', 'sleeping', 'technicians', 'drink', 'party', 'mess', 'process', 'startling', 'display', 'indifference', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'person', 'Perhaps', 'indictment', 'medical', 'community', 'mental', 'anguish', 'discomfort', 'drugs', 'other', 'means', 'sort', 'detachment', 'what', 'other', 'damage', 'may', 'be', 'inflicted', 'individual.As', 'watch', 'Joel', 'memories', 'disappearing', 'use', 'clever', 'cinematographic', 'techniques', 'see', 'Joel', 'desperately', 'trying', 'keep', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'removed', 'Other', 'memories', 'childhood', 'become', 'more', 'vivid', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'memories', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'person', 'Joel', 'think', 'precautionary', 'tale', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'humans', 'selectively', 'erase', 'bad', 'painful', 'memories', 'minds', 'having', 'impact', 'overall', 'psyche', 'may', 'lose', 'pain', 'may', 'also', 'give', 'up', 'piece', 'soul', 'being', 'when', 'try', 'block', 'out', 'bad', 'keep', 'only', 'good', 'memories', 'are', 'complex', 'twisted', 'tied', 'together', 'ways', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'hit', 'erase', 'button', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'create', 'own', 'map']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620265,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JMJG,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[6, 7]","Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind had a very interesting concept for a movie, and a twist on your typical rom-com movie. It is basically about the way interfering with memories can result in something bad - ie. The Butterfly Effect & Total Recall.If you're a fan of Jim Carrey playing the funny man in movies, then I suggest you don't see this movie, unless you're interested in seeing him play a relatively different role. What shocked me was his appearance in this. He looked really old. It's these bags under his eyes, and grooves down the side of his mouth, and the hair was unwashed, and he was unshaven a lot of the time.The start credits don't start until 17 minutes into the movie which is a very cool effect. There is one main story, the love between Clementine (Kate Winslet wearing a wide selection of wacky wigs) and Joel, and an underlying story between Kirsten Dunst's character, and the doctor of Lacuna Inc. Which seemed pretty much pointless, as there was no incline that they had a ""past"", and suddenly it just happens for no reason. But I suppose if you haven't seen this movie, then expect the unexpected.There are quite a few scenes which were cut out of the script for this movie, which I reckon would have been very interesting. The original script featured a cut beginning and ending sequence that took place in the future. In the end, an older Clementine comes in to have the procedure done and a look at her screen shows that she's had the procedure done multiple times and all of them involved Joel. At the very end of the script, an older Joel calls Clementine to ask why she hasn't called, but the technicians performing the procedure erase his message. Other cuts in the original script include a montage of memories people wanted erased, including a soldier seeing his dead friend on a battlefield and a girl who was raped at a young age. Another sub plot dropped from the script was Mary ( Kirsten Dunst) finding out that Howard made her get an abortion after they had the affair resulting in her desire to have her memory wiped.If you look at your DVD collection and find mostly rom-coms (not me of course!) then this is the DVD for you to get. It's certainly a romance with a twist. I can't say I was that keen on Jim Carrey not playing the funny guy. And he had TWO assistants listed in the credits, plus hair and makeup people who weren't needed! This will also get you thinking, as I know for certain, if I went through this procedure, I would lose quite a few years of my life! Imagine all those memories, just gone.",3,Would you erase me?,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,2558,"['Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'movie', 'twist', 'typical', 'rom-com', 'movie', 'basically', 'way', 'interfering', 'memories', 'can', 'result', 'something', 'bad', 'ie', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Total', 'Recall.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'funny', 'man', 'movies', 'then', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'play', 'relatively', 'different', 'role', 'What', 'shocked', 'was', 'appearance', 'looked', 'really', 'old', 'bags', 'eyes', 'down', 'side', 'mouth', 'hair', 'was', 'unwashed', 'was', 'unshaven', 'lot', 'time.The', 'start', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', '17', 'minutes', 'movie', 'very', 'cool', 'effect', 'one', 'main', 'story', 'love', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'wearing', 'wide', 'selection', 'wacky', 'wigs', 'Joel', 'underlying', 'story', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'character', 'doctor', 'Lacuna', 'Inc', 'Which', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'much', 'pointless', 'was', 'incline', 'had', 'past', 'suddenly', 'just', 'reason', 'suppose', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'expect', 'unexpected.There', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'script', 'movie', 'reckon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'original', 'script', 'featured', 'cut', 'beginning', 'ending', 'sequence', 'took', 'place', 'future', 'end', 'older', 'Clementine', 'have', 'procedure', 'done', 'look', 'screen', 'had', 'procedure', 'done', 'multiple', 'times', 'involved', 'Joel', 'very', 'end', 'script', 'older', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'ask', 'why', ""n't"", 'called', 'technicians', 'performing', 'procedure', 'erase', 'message', 'Other', 'cuts', 'original', 'script', 'include', 'montage', 'memories', 'people', 'wanted', 'erased', 'including', 'soldier', 'seeing', 'dead', 'friend', 'battlefield', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'raped', 'young', 'age', 'sub', 'plot', 'dropped', 'script', 'was', 'Mary', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'finding', 'out', 'Howard', 'made', 'get', 'abortion', 'had', 'affair', 'resulting', 'desire', 'have', 'memory', 'wiped.If', 'look', 'DVD', 'collection', 'find', 'mostly', 'rom-coms', 'not', 'course', 'then', 'DVD', 'get', 'certainly', 'romance', 'twist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'keen', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'not', 'playing', 'funny', 'guy', 'had', 'TWO', 'assistants', 'listed', 'credits', 'hair', 'makeup', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'needed', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'thinking', 'know', 'certain', 'went', 'procedure', 'would', 'lose', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'life', 'Imagine', 'memories', 'just', 'gone']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

It examines many of the truths in relationships, such as how the things that draw us to a person end up driving us crazy eventually and how we're often attracted to people who have the qualities in abundance that we lack. The movie also examines the complexity of memory and how we as humans natually seek out relationships that challenge us and help us grow, which is why the characters with certain memories erased by choice seem doomed to learn the same lessons they just learned all over again.The only problem I had with this movie was that it would be impossible to erase the memory of one person completely. You couldn't erase all of the associations you have with someone you've dated over 2 years, of course, as you are going to run into their mother/father/sister/friend/neighbour, etc. eventually and when they ask you how you're doing and you don't know at all who all these people are, you would start to think perhaps you have Alzheimer's or wonder why it is that some people out there in the world know an awful lot about you and you don't know them at all...plus the insert of ""Patrick"" in the film shows the dangers involved in someone having all this knowledge of you and you not knowing them.The acting and the way this film is designed is beyond amazing.

620267,A2TLQP6QUE5T28,B00005JMJG,Melinda Hart,"[4, 6]","Eternal Sunshine proves that there can still be originality in Today's Hollywood. Charlie Kaufman conquers the very difficult task of weaving an intricate, touching tale about the complexities of love and how, in a moment of anger or heartache, we can take for granted our most precious memories and destroy the very best things experienced in life.Michel Gondry and his team saw to it that every trick of the lens, every visually stunning moment worked to enchance the heart of the story and therefore deserves every one of the five stars celebrating their celuloid triumph. Same goes for the actors, who do such a beautiful job with their performances, you'd never know their characters came from words on a page. Jim Carrey deserves special attention as his performance was an understated tour de force, in my opinion - as was Kate Winslet's, and the unlikely pairing making the story all the more surprising and enjoyable.

620268,A2IRATR53843WU,B00005JMJG,M,"[8, 15]","***spoilers***Let me start out first by praising the writer and the director.  This film, despite the shifting frames of reference, is nearly airtight.  That alone makes it a marvel of filmmaking.  In fact, the movie is a smorgasbord for anybody who is interested in any of the technical aspects of filmmaking, because it's nearly flawless (the music, I thought, could have been better, but that's hardly material here).  But it's a great film because it's the very best satire:  biting, but not too obvious or preachy, and open somewhat to interpretation without collapsing as a result of not having the guts to mean something specific.  I've seen lots of positive reviews in here by people who loved it as a love story.  Well, I'm glad, but IMHO you missed the point.The film is about human nature and how this nature manifests itself in personal relationships.  Jim Carrey is a man with a girlfriend (Kate Winslett) who had her memories of him purged after they broke up.  Upon discovering this, he opts for the procedure himself.  His unconscious mind rebels mid-way and while he relives the memories with his GF, he tries to stop the procedure.  He fails, but the couple ""re-meet"" again and are drawn to each other.  Presumably, they will fall in love again.  But are they ""saved?""  I think Kaufman rather clearly indicates that instead, they're doomed.Since the story is not told chronologically, it takes some work by the audience to figure out what exactly is happening.  But, the direction and writing are so tight that each scene always reveals itself -- eventually -- for what it truly is, either memory or reality (and reality is further divided beween pre- and post-procedure).  Carrey is private and aloof to a fault, whereas Winslett is spontaneous and outgoing -- to a fault.  They are not like each other, and scenes of their fights and eventual break-up indicate that they are not a good match for each other, despite their genuine feelings.  Distinguish between Carrey's memories of his GF and his actual interaction with her:  most of the memories, especially from the vantage point of his imminent danger having these memories erased -- are mostly very good.  But that's Charlie Kaufman's commentary on the human condition -- we are apt to exaggerate things, especially under emotional circumstances: hence, the allure of the quick-fix, the memory-erasing procedure.  The reality of their relationship, we are shown, differs somewhat from Carrey's memories.Consider also the parallel story for evidence of Kaufman's satiric intent.  This sub-plot deals with the relationship between a young medical assistant (Kirstin Dunst) and a married doctor, who is decades older than she.  She exhibits a crush on him -- but later it is revealed that they previously had something much more serious.  We learn that she had the procedure to erase their relationship from her memory (he didn't have the procedure, though).  But the procedure was powerless to quell her basic urges:  she may have forgotten the pain of the past, but she remained as attracted to him as before, yet lacking the wisdom gained from the hindsight that he possesses.  Thus, while she throws herself at him he, with obvious difficulty, nevertheless rebuffs her advances, breaking the spiral and perhaps saving his marriage.Carrey and Winslett, though, don't have this luxury.  Their ""re-meeting,"" as it turns out, was actually shown to the audience in the first scenes of the film.  Kaufman's choice to do this as opposed to presenting it last is further evidence of his satiric aims.  Kaufman could easily have presented this scene last, and with no loss of impact.  In fact, it would be the standard Hollywood tear-jerking formula to draw it up in this manner -- if the message was in fact to be ""love conquers all.""  But this isn't the message, and we weren't meant to linger, teary-eyed, on this scene as the lovers fumble over themselves and into each other's arms again.  Thus this scene is best presented out of order, in the beginning of the film -- not as some gimmicky gesture of ""edginess"" but as an essential element for creating the cyclical quality of the relationship that Kaufman wants to convey.  Because it doesn't matter when Carrey and Winslett meet, and it doesn't matter whether this meeting was their first or fiftieth:  the results will be the same.  And, unfortunately, so will the inevitable pain and hurt that the two mis-cast lovers will inflict upon each other.  Carrey and Winslet took the easy way out and deleted themselves from their troubled post-breakup psyches, thereby leaving them powerless from eternally repeating their mistakes, like unthinking rodents on a wheel.  Any wisdom gained by Carrey during the procedure was subsequently erased by the procedure.  Love, Kaufman warns, is irrational.  Only by facing their pain and dealing with it can these two hope to jump off the wheel and find healthy relationships with others -- or hope to patch things up between themselves.This wickedly cynical film ends with them breathlessly taken with each other, their spotless minds unaware of all that lies ahead.  To my shock I saw a few tissues dabbing eyes in the theater during the credits; me, I couldn't stop from laughing.",5,A Deliciously Vicious Satire,1084924800,"05 19,

In spite of all the kudos this movie has received, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those ""artsy"" movies that brags on its own originality, but fails to really address the issues at hand:  you may be able to erase a person's memories, but you cannot erase the feelings that person has.  This is proven not only in the main storyline with Joel and Clementine, but in the secondary plot featuring the impressionable Mary who thinks that the work of her idol Howard is so wonderful.  We later find out that her heroic doctor has been ""playing"" her like a fiddle, too.  We first meet Joel as he skips a day from work and goes off on an adventure where he runs into the blue-haired Clementine.  There's the slightest hint that they've ""met before"", and by the time the opening credits roll, we see a disgruntled and angry Joel finding out that Clementine has had a procedure done to ""erase"" her memories of Joel and she's on to a new life with a new boyfriend.  A hurt Joel decides to have the procedure done, but as it is being performed, he finds his memories aren't as awful as the thought and he tries to stop the procedure.  Of course, by the end, both Joel and Clementine realize they made a mistake in having the procedure done, but we also realize that even though they want to try and make it together again, the same things that caused them to split in the first place are still there and they will more than likely appear again.I didn't find the script all that enticing, it's manipulative and much of what goes on is predictable and forced.  As for the acting, Jim Carrey takes a dramatic leap but I found myself thinking, ""This is Jim Carrey trying to show us he's a serious actor and not just a manic Ace Ventura.""  Kate Winslet's performance, while professionally done, pales in comparison to her work in ""Finding Neverland,"" and she should have gotten her oscar nomination for that film instead of this one in which she merely seems to be ""acting.""  Elijah Wood looks painfully out of place in his role as the lovestricken Patrick, again like an actor who is saying ""Don't just think of me as Frodo.""  Ironically, it is in the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, that the heart of this movie is evidenced.  Ruffalo is marvelous as the programming geek with the hots for an unsuspecting Dunst; Dunst, meanwhile, uses her adolescent charms gamely and does a real reversal when she finds out what's happened to her; and Wilkinson exudes a calm confidence and vulnerability as the mastermind behind Lacuna, which is the memory erasing company.  The film offers some great visual effects as Carrey's memory is being erased, but by the time the deed is done, so much posturing and padding has crippled the movie.I'm sure all of the afficionados of this vastly overrated film will hit their ""No"" buttons by now, but as always, it's not whether one agrees with the film, but if one can find something that helped them make up their own minds about this movie.  I found it too manipulative and artsy.",2,WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE REALITY OF THIS MOVIE,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,3065,"['..it', 'pretty', 'lame', 'spite', 'kudos', 'movie', 'received', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'one', 'artsy', 'movies', 'brags', 'own', 'originality', 'really', 'address', 'issues', 'hand', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'erase', 'person', 'memories', 'can', 'not', 'erase', 'feelings', 'person', 'proven', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'storyline', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'secondary', 'plot', 'featuring', 'impressionable', 'Mary', 'who', 'work', 'idol', 'Howard', 'so', 'wonderful', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'heroic', 'doctor', 'been', 'playing', 'fiddle', 'too', 'first', 'meet', 'Joel', 'day', 'work', 'off', 'adventure', 'where', 'blue-haired', 'Clementine', 'slightest', 'hint', ""'ve"", 'met', 'time', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'see', 'disgruntled', 'angry', 'Joel', 'finding', 'out', 'Clementine', 'had', 'procedure', 'done', 'erase', 'memories', 'Joel', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'hurt', 'Joel', 'have', 'procedure', 'done', 'being', 'performed', 'memories', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'awful', 'thought', 'stop', 'procedure', 'course', 'end', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'realize', 'made', 'mistake', 'having', 'procedure', 'done', 'also', 'realize', 'even', 'want', 'try', 'make', 'together', 'again', 'same', 'things', 'caused', 'split', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'appear', 'again.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'script', 'enticing', 'manipulative', 'much', 'what', 'predictable', 'forced', 'acting', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'dramatic', 'leap', 'found', 'thinking', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'trying', 'show', 'serious', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'manic', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'professionally', 'done', 'pales', 'comparison', 'work', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'instead', 'one', 'merely', 'be', 'acting', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'painfully', 'place', 'role', 'lovestricken', 'Patrick', 'again', 'actor', 'who', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'think', 'Frodo', 'Ironically', 'performances', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'heart', 'movie', 'evidenced', 'Ruffalo', 'marvelous', 'programming', 'geek', 'hots', 'unsuspecting', 'Dunst', 'Dunst', 'meanwhile', 'adolescent', 'charms', 'gamely', 'real', 'reversal', 'when', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Wilkinson', 'calm', 'confidence', 'vulnerability', 'mastermind', 'Lacuna', 'memory', 'erasing', 'company', 'film', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'Carrey', 'memory', 'being', 'erased', 'time', 'deed', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'posturing', 'padding', 'crippled', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'afficionados', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'film', 'will', 'hit', 'No', 'buttons', 'now', 'always', 'not', 'one', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'helped', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'movie', 'found', 'too', 'manipulative', 'artsy']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620271,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JMJG,Michael Crane,"[538, 570]","When you hear the basic storyline of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" it sounds like another one of those ""wacky"" romantic comedies that they love to put out every month.  However, when you realize that this is written by Charlie Kaufman (who also wrote ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich""), then you know that this will be a very different movie.  This is such an enjoyable, hilarious and a brutally honest film that has immediately become a favorite of mine.Jim Carrey plays ""Joel;"" a quiet and shy person who keeps to himself most of the time.  He's bummed out when he discovers that his girlfriend had a new procedure done in where she has erased him from her memory.  Not knowing what else to do, Joel decides that he must get the same thing done to him and goes to the clinic to have her erased from his memory, hoping that the pain and sadness will go away.  When he's undergoing the procedure, unconscious and reliving the memories as they are being erased, Joel begins to realize that there were some very happy moments he had with her and he doesn't want to lose them after all.It's really hard to categorize a movie like this.  While it is indeed a comedy on some levels, it has a lot of dramatic elements to it, as well.  Because of this, people will either fall in love with it or despise every minute of it.  What really struck home with me is how honest and creative it really is.  You'll find a lot more honesty and truth in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" than in most of the ""cute"" comedies that are out there today.  It is extremely easy to relate to the characters, and that is what makes it all the more realistic for us.  Jim Carrey is absolutely fantastic in this, as he is very controlled and doesn't try to steal the show.  This is when you really get to see his acting skills shine.  Kate Winslet takes the challenge of playing opposite of Carrey head-on and succeeds every single time.  We cannot forget about Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, who also make the movie that much more entertaining.What I really admire about the movie is the theme of it, and that is that just because a relationship doesn't work out in the end, it doesn't mean that it was time wasted.  Sure, there are certain memories we wish would go away somehow, but how would that change us as a person if we could do such a thing?  We learn from our experiences; from the good and the bad.  That's how we mature as human-beings, and Kaufman's clever writing really establishes that perfectly.  The DVD has some cool extras, such as behind-the-scenes documentaries, audio commentary from the writer and the director, deleted scenes and more.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" remains the best film to come out of 2004 for me.  It's strange, yet clever; funny yet sad, and imaginative, yet honest.  If you're looking for a risk-taking film that is like a breath of fresh air, then I highly recommend this excellent picture.  This can possibly be the best movie of Jim Carrey's career.  Take a chance and find out why so many people are raving about it in the first place. -Michael Crane",5,"""I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE!!!""",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,3134,"['When', 'hear', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'one', 'wacky', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'love', 'put', 'out', 'month', 'However', 'when', 'realize', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'then', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'such', 'enjoyable', 'hilarious', 'brutally', 'honest', 'film', 'immediately', 'become', 'favorite', 'mine.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'quiet', 'shy', 'person', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'bummed', 'out', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'new', 'procedure', 'done', 'where', 'erased', 'memory', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'Joel', 'must', 'get', 'same', 'thing', 'done', 'clinic', 'have', 'erased', 'memory', 'hoping', 'pain', 'sadness', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'When', 'undergoing', 'procedure', 'unconscious', 'reliving', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'erased', 'Joel', 'realize', 'were', 'very', 'happy', 'moments', 'had', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'all.It', 'really', 'hard', 'categorize', 'movie', 'indeed', 'comedy', 'levels', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'fall', 'love', 'despise', 'minute', 'What', 'really', 'struck', 'home', 'how', 'honest', 'creative', 'really', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'honesty', 'truth', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'most', 'cute', 'comedies', 'are', 'there', 'today', 'extremely', 'easy', 'relate', 'characters', 'what', 'more', 'realistic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'very', 'controlled', ""n't"", 'try', 'steal', 'show', 'when', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'acting', 'skills', 'shine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'challenge', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Carrey', 'head-on', 'single', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'also', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'really', 'admire', 'movie', 'theme', 'just', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'end', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'time', 'wasted', 'Sure', 'are', 'certain', 'memories', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'somehow', 'how', 'would', 'change', 'person', 'could', 'do', 'thing', 'learn', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'how', 'mature', 'human-beings', 'Kaufman', 'clever', 'writing', 'really', 'perfectly', 'DVD', 'cool', 'extras', 'such', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentaries', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer', 'director', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'best', 'film', 'come', '2004', 'strange', 'yet', 'clever', 'funny', 'yet', 'sad', 'imaginative', 'yet', 'honest', ""'re"", 'looking', 'risk-taking', 'film', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'picture', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'career', 'Take', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'raving', 'first', 'place', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620272,A7FJVRLMG5BF9,B00005JMJG,Michael JR Jose,"[4, 4]","Some people are put off this film because they don't like Jim 'Manic' Carrey, but strangely, this is a reason to watch the film as he plays a shy boy in this one. Underacting is so much less exhausting than overacting! Kate Winslett plays the bit-above-average American extrovert, and plays it very well, so she reverses her normal refined English rose role too. The genius of the story is the play with the timeline, with more twists and loops than 'Timecop' and 'Pulp Fiction' together. Flashback is the technical term, but this barely begins to describe the new heights to which it is brought.The story opens with the shy boy waking up, and on a whim, taking the day off work to go to the beach. He does not feel too good, but he does not know why yet. He meets a stranger, a forward girl who gives him the glad eye so often that he is embarrassed out of his skin. Of course they get it together, and then the complications set in. They seem made for each other, but in way so strange that it seems like they have a previous shared deja vu sort of attraction.Then their memories play the strangest tricks, the story is partly seen thru his eyes, in a First Person Point Of View way, but not entirely, as he often appears to be viewing his own memories and life. It is a life he chose to throw away, he tried to live it and failed and wanted to run away, and then, even as he threw it away, knowing that he is making a mistake, he tried to change his mind. The story is his inner turmoil made visible. Only film can do this! Even very interior books like 'Rebecca' or 'Jane Eyre' can only approximate the effect.The science fiction aspect of the story is quite familiar, similar to ideas found in 'Total Recall' and 'Blade Runner', but the whole story is so set in the Now that it has no feel at all of futurism. The morally dubious nature of the procedure he is so set on instinctively fighting is very cleverly handled. A significant film, and one worth watching more than once. Any film that can quote Nietszche and Alexander Pope inside one minute has to be worth a look.",5,"POPE ALEXANDER, ALEXANDER POPE",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,2077,"['people', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jim', ""'Manic"", 'Carrey', 'strangely', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'shy', 'boy', 'one', 'Underacting', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'exhausting', 'overacting', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'bit-above-average', 'American', 'extrovert', 'very', 'well', 'normal', 'refined', 'English', 'rose', 'role', 'too', 'genius', 'story', 'play', 'timeline', 'more', 'twists', 'loops', 'Fiction', 'together', 'Flashback', 'technical', 'term', 'barely', 'describe', 'new', 'heights', 'brought.The', 'story', 'shy', 'boy', 'waking', 'up', 'whim', 'taking', 'day', 'work', 'go', 'beach', 'not', 'feel', 'too', 'good', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'yet', 'stranger', 'forward', 'girl', 'who', 'glad', 'eye', 'so', 'often', 'embarrassed', 'skin', 'course', 'get', 'together', 'then', 'complications', 'set', 'seem', 'made', 'other', 'way', 'strange', 'have', 'previous', 'shared', 'deja', 'vu', 'sort', 'memories', 'play', 'strangest', 'tricks', 'story', 'partly', 'seen', 'thru', 'eyes', 'First', 'Person', 'Point', 'View', 'way', 'not', 'entirely', 'often', 'be', 'viewing', 'own', 'memories', 'life', 'life', 'chose', 'throw', 'away', 'tried', 'live', 'failed', 'wanted', 'run', 'away', 'then', 'even', 'threw', 'away', 'knowing', 'making', 'mistake', 'tried', 'change', 'mind', 'story', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'made', 'visible', 'Only', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'Even', 'very', 'interior', 'books', ""'Rebecca"", ""'Jane"", 'Eyre', 'can', 'only', 'approximate', 'effect.The', 'science', 'fiction', 'aspect', 'story', 'quite', 'familiar', 'similar', 'ideas', 'found', ""'Total"", 'Recall', ""'Blade"", 'Runner', 'whole', 'story', 'so', 'set', 'Now', 'feel', 'futurism', 'morally', 'dubious', 'nature', 'procedure', 'so', 'set', 'instinctively', 'fighting', 'very', 'cleverly', 'handled', 'significant', 'film', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'Any', 'film', 'can', 'quote', 'Nietszche', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'one', 'minute', 'be', 'look']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620273,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JMJG,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 5]","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another Jim Carey movie I wasn't too sure about. He's had a better track record lately with his more serious films, so I was willing to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did.Combining all the mental hijinks of Memento and the mind-bending, ""is this reality?"" confusion of movies like Strange Days and eXistenz, the movie essentially posits one question: if you could erase any one experience from your mind, would you?But before we get to that question, we see Joel Barish (Jim Carey) meet Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. It's supposedly happenstance, and the two hit it off immediately. These first five minutes carry the whole movie. The two actors exhibit just enough nuanced familiarity that it's alternately exhilarating and creepy-they FEEL like they've known each other their entire lives. The rest of the movie then swings back to the circumstances leading up to their meeting.Joel has, in fact, met Clementine before and had a whirlwind romance that somewhere along the lines lost its whirl. They are strikingly different personalities who find attraction in their opposite: Joel is cautious, Clementine's a maniac. Joel is quiet (hard to believe Carey playing quiet, I know), Clementine is a bundle of energy. They alternately drive each other crazy and are crazy about each other. But unfortunately, the nature of the relationship is so tempestuous that the possibility of erasing one's memory is simply too tempting. Like a madman with a pocket nuke, it's inevitable that Clementine's personality will succumb to the lure of memory erasing...but the consequences have grave repercussions.Hurt and desperate, Clementine's brash decision pushes Joel to do the same thing. If she's going to erase him, well he's going to do the same thing right back at her! It's a procedure that takes an entire night and it's only a few days into the erasing of her memories that Joel realizes he LIKES his pain, his angst, his embarrassment, and even his hatred of her. The ups and downs, the good and bad parts of their relationship, are ultimately inseparable, and Joel realizes he will lose a part of his soul along with Clementine should his memory of her be erased.So he fights it. Thus have another plot thread, as Joel drags his memory of Clementine with him through the dark hallways of his mind. All the while, Joel is pursued in the real world by the Lacuna Memory Erasure team. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) leads the team, a kindly father figure who is not nearly as nice as he seems. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) assist the good doctor, making an on-site visit to Joel's house. Which is at least as horrifying as it is comedic, because while Joel is in a drugged coma on his bed, Stan and Patrick eat his food, drink his beer, get high, and practically have an orgy in his apartment.Like Memento, Spotless Mind posits that when people aren't looking, the ethics of society don't just fall apart, they explode...whatever you imagine people might do to you while you're helpless is just the tip of the iceberg. Patrick proves just who unethical he is when we discover he has decided to take advantage of Clementine by recycling all of Joel's memories-memories that were supposedly destroyed to complete the erasure process.As if that weren't enough, Dr. Mierzwiak's assistant Mary (Kirsten Dunst), is dating Stan. The secret she uncovers about herself and her work will shatter the Lacuna program and the lives of all those who it touched.The director takes an innovative twist on how he conveys the dream world. Images become faded and indistinct. Sound crackles in and then whispers away. Some scenes appear to be lit exclusively by a flashlight, perfectly representing the selective memory of Joel's mind. Other scenes are lensed in distinct colors of yellow and blue. Still other scenes are nightmarish-people are faceless, bodies slide off into darkness, and as Joel's mind stumbles under the technological assault, structures and people literally collapse in front of him.Ultimately, it's Charlie Kaufman's writing that perfectly blends what could be a horrible mess. Just when you think all the various plotline could not possibly be resolved...we're back at that train, and the thrill and awkwardness of that first attraction.Spotless Mind is about the maturation of a romance and the decision every couple must go through when they realize that the ""honeymoon is over."" Joel and Clementine come to a crossroads and stumble horribly astray, just as so many couples fall apart every day without the benefit of erasing the memories of their exes. Love, Kaufman seems to say, is about the person you are after the honeymoon is over.Carey is suitably restrained, which makes him seem all the more pathetic when the movie focuses on the happier, more energetic times. His hair is a mop top, is sweaters always rumpled. In short, he's a sad sack that Carey captures perfectly...a funny man who has nothing to laugh about.Dunst plays a perfectly awkward, clueless young girl dealing with a technology she does not understand. Her characters growth, destruction, and rebirth steals the show. The other characters are suitably dazed and confused, not the least of which is Wood's not-Frodo-anymore Patrick. He's so fresh-faced, it's hard to believe he's doing such disrespectful things to Clementine.But by far, Winslet plays the most compelling character of her career. Winslet not only adopts an American accent, she plays Clementine as herself (a sometimes whiny, neurotic mess), as Joel remembers her (erotically playful, maddeningly confusing, and sometimes just a shrew), and as echoes of Joe's memories. This is a lot to pull off for anybody, but Winslet never missed a beat.Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give this movie is that I KNOW these people.

But their differences eventually divide them and the relationship ends abruptly in an explosion of meanness.  Clementine decides to have Joel removed from her memory, and seeks the assistance of Dr. Mierzqwiak (Wilkinson) and his less than professional assistants (Wood and Ruffalo).  When Joel discovers this, he decides to follow suit and remove Clementine from his mind.  But Joel's memory is a tangled place, and soon he discovers that he does not want to lose the memories that he has.  What follows is a foreword and backward journey through Joel's mind as he tries to hide his memories of Clementine from the ""erasers"".  As usual, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has produced an offbeat movie.  Those looking for a typical Jim Carrey movie will be sorely disappointed.  If you are looking for an off the wall romance in which almost anything can happen (after all, a good portion of the movie takes place in Joel's head), you will walk away with a smile on your face and the realization that all memories are a part of who we are and should never be forgotten.",4,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,1175,"['When', 'introverted', 'Joel', 'Carrey', 'meets', 'extroverted', 'Clementine', 'Winslet', 'fly', 'romance', 'blooms', 'quickly', 'differences', 'eventually', 'divide', 'relationship', 'abruptly', 'explosion', 'meanness', 'Clementine', 'have', 'Joel', 'removed', 'memory', 'assistance', 'Dr.', 'Mierzqwiak', 'Wilkinson', 'less', 'professional', 'assistants', 'Wood', 'Ruffalo', 'When', 'Joel', 'follow', 'suit', 'remove', 'Clementine', 'mind', 'Joel', 'memory', 'tangled', 'place', 'soon', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'memories', 'What', 'foreword', 'backward', 'journey', 'Joel', 'mind', 'hide', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'erasers', 'usual', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'produced', 'offbeat', 'movie', 'looking', 'typical', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'are', 'looking', 'off', 'wall', 'romance', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'place', 'Joel', 'head', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'smile', 'face', 'realization', 'memories', 'are', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

He has those crinkles of humor around his eyes, his face, everything. He's a classically handsome man, but I just can't see him as anything but a comedic actor.Secondly, the filming of the movie was poor. It felt B-grade, low-grade, and kind of dark and jerky. Perhaps that was the intent but for me, it made the movie feel old. Had I not known it was a newer movie, and just glanced at it on the television, I would have thought it was a 70s movie.All that said, I love the premise: What would life be like if you could just erase all your worst memories, to get rid of all those things that are painful, negative, etc. What would that do to who you are and how you feel?The movie brings up more questions than it does answers, but in a good way. And it does provide answers as to what it does to certain people.However, I found it boring, dragging and slowly plotted. I was easily distracted because I couldn't get into the movie.

620276,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMJG,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 2]","It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love ? If you haven?t experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real ?love connection? per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can?t be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is ? utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn?t like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another ? That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable ? Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius.Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey?s performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It?s not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can?t help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone?s affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn?t perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role.Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn?t work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn?t play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, ?gut-instincts?, or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?",4,The Moose Hole - 'Sunshine' Nearly 'Spotless',1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,6329,"['both', 'best', 'worst', 'time', 'lives',

620277,A27QLYGAM9AU3M,B00005JMJG,Mike Sobocinski,"[1, 2]","I believe that this film will produce three different reactions in viewers.  There will be a sizable chunk of people who find the film completely disorienting and confusing.  For these persons, I will advise that they recognize that things are not told in straight chronological order, and that because the film involves the point of view of a man whose mind is being affected, his perceptions and memories are becoming confused with his actual experiences.  Audiences are not given information in a simple manner, so just remember what you can and hold onto the puzzle pieces until you find a way to fit things together.The second type of reaction many viewers will have is to delight in the film's unconventional structure and surreal presentations, and to therefore herald it as a great work of genius.Not to try to rain on their parade, but the third reaction to the film, I think, is the one that I actually had.  Yes, the film is different and this in itself sets it above most other works.  I enjoyed the unconventional presentation and got a lot of kicks out of the humor scattered throughout the film.  There are many gags and clever tricks that the filmmakers play upon perceptive audiences here!  But the question for me then becomes: to what degree does the film work as a unified whole?  A serious scrutiny will ask how well the scenario is really being served by all the details we are given.  It often feels like these filmmaker tricks and gags are the main appeal the film has.  I don't think they should be - the film had the potential to be a quirky, surreal version of Frank Capra, and the performances are very good (I was especially impressed by Kirsten Dunst here!) but the cleverness of presentation tends to undercut the effectiveness of some of the story arcs - the film touches upon some interesting issues but all too often focuses on expressive flashiness and quirky details at the expense of building upon its most valuable themes.  There are numerous episodes that are amusing but don't actually advance the story.  The supporting character, Mary, has her story told effectively, but the impact of the other characters' own experiences does suffer, I feel, from the great emphasis on clever surreal episodes and the ""puzzle piece"" approach to providing viewers with information.  Reassembled in a different way, we would have a very moving and heartfelt story here.  There is some freshness to the material here, and great creativity in the filmmaking, but that creativity unfortunately seems to come at the expense of keeping a connection with the characters.  The writer has interesting ideas but needs to work at unifying those ideas into the overall theme, so that his cleverness enhances rather than distracts from our empathy for the characters.  It's not that the film failed - far from it.  But in the end, more care seems to have been taken with the surface glitter than with the depth of the story's potential.  Consistent use of symbolism or metaphor would have gone a long way here to help solidify the film's exploration of a worthy theme.  Instead, we have an enjoyable hodgepodge that engages the brain while the heart longs to also get involved, but mostly keeps being pushed aside.  A very worthy effort, but more effort needed to be put into parsimonious use of material to better allow for an exploration of the film's theme.  Instead, the nutritional value of the film is only moderate - there are extensive garnishes on the plate but for those who look I think they'll find that the main course is a bit undersized.",4,Clever production,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,3566,"['believe', 'film', 'will', 'produce', 'three', 'different', 'reactions', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'sizable', 'chunk', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'film', 'completely', 'disorienting', 'confusing', 'persons', 'will', 'advise', 'recognize', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'straight', 'chronological', 'order', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'man', 'mind', 'being', 'affected', 'perceptions', 'memories', 'are', 'becoming', 'confused', 'actual', 'experiences', 'Audiences', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'information', 'simple', 'manner', 'so', 'just', 'remember', 'what', 'can', 'hold', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'find', 'way', 'fit', 'things', 'together.The', 'second', 'type', 'reaction', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'delight', 'film', 'unconventional', 'structure', 'surreal', 'presentations', 'therefore', 'herald', 'great', 'work', 'genius.Not', 'try', 'rain', 'parade', 'third', 'reaction', 'film', 'think', 'one', 'actually', 'had', 'Yes', 'film', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'works', 'enjoyed', 'unconventional', 'presentation', 'got', 'lot', 'kicks', 'humor', 'scattered', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'gags', 'clever', 'tricks', 'filmmakers', 'play', 'perceptive', 'audiences', 'here', 'question', 'then', 'what', 'degree', 'film', 'work', 'unified', 'whole', 'serious', 'scrutiny', 'will', 'ask', 'how', 'well', 'scenario', 'really', 'being', 'served', 'details', 'are', 'given', 'often', 'filmmaker', 'tricks', 'gags', 'are', 'main', 'appeal', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'quirky', 'surreal', 'version', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'here', 'cleverness', 'presentation', 'tends', 'undercut', 'effectiveness', 'story', 'arcs', 'film', 'touches', 'interesting', 'issues', 'too', 'often', 'expressive', 'flashiness', 'quirky', 'details', 'expense', 'building', 'most', 'valuable', 'themes', 'are', 'numerous', 'episodes', 'are', 'amusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'advance', 'story', 'supporting', 'character', 'Mary', 'story', 'told', 'effectively', 'impact', 'other', 'characters', 'own', 'experiences', 'suffer', 'feel', 'great', 'emphasis', 'clever', 'surreal', 'episodes', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'approach', 'providing', 'viewers', 'information', 'Reassembled', 'different', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'very', 'moving', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'here', 'freshness', 'material', 'here', 'great', 'creativity', 'filmmaking', 'creativity', 'unfortunately', 'come', 'expense', 'keeping', 'connection', 'characters', 'writer', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'needs', 'work', 'unifying', 'ideas', 'overall', 'theme', 'cleverness', 'rather', 'distracts', 'empathy', 'characters', 'not', 'film', 'failed', 'far', 'end', 'more', 'care', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'surface', 'glitter', 'depth', 'story', 'potential', 'Consistent', 'use', 'symbolism', 'metaphor', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'here', 'help', 'solidify', 'film', 'exploration', 'worthy', 'theme', 'Instead', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'hodgepodge', 'brain', 'heart', 'also', 'get', 'involved', 'mostly', 'being', 'pushed', 'aside', 'very', 'worthy', 'effort', 'more', 'effort', 'needed', 'be', 'put', 'parsimonious', 'use', 'material', 'better', 'allow', 'exploration', 'film', 'theme', 'Instead', 'nutritional', 'value', 'film', 'only', 'moderate', 'are', 'extensive', 'garnishes', 'plate', 'who', 'look', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'main', 'course', 'bit', 'undersized']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620278,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JMJG,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Charlie Kaufman's screenplay for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" may be his most elaborate cinematic mind game yet; as filmed by Michel Gondry, with a superb cast led by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, it's at least tied with ""Being John Malkovich"" as his most entertaining. This definitely is a movie that the less you know about it going in, the better, so this is all I will tell you about the plot: Tom Wilkinson is a doctor who heads Lacuna Inc., a company devoted to helping people erase their most unpleasant memories; Carrey and Winslet are an unhappy couple who (separately) come to Wilkinson to wipe out all memories of each other; Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are various employees of Wilkinson, with entanglements of their own. From there on in, the movie becomes a virtuoso meditation on the importance of memory, the problem of pain and the persistence of love. Kaufman and Gondry (aided immeasurably by photographer Ellen Kuras, who gives the film a compellingly unreal look) have many, many surprises in store for us, all of which would be spoiled if I said any more about them. I'll just say that viewers have to work to keep up with the whiplash changes and hairpin turns of the plot and the visual imagery, but I think most will find it worthwhile.

620281,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMJG,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay to date. His typical self-indulgence is tamed by a tight, disciplined story. The offbeat and unconventional script comments on the value of relationships and painful memories without being weird for its own sake. Michel Gondry's relatively low budget direction is creative, stylized, but not heavy-handed. I think this is Jim Carrey's best dramatic role, as well. Joel (Jim Carrey) has split with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his free-spirited girlfriend of two years. As Valentine's Day approaches, he decides to try to reconcile, but finds to his bewilderment that Clementine doesn't seem to recognize him. She has impulsively had their tempestuous relationship erased from her memory in an effort to put it behind her. Joel tracks down Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkerson), who performed the procedure, and decides in a huff to do the same. But midway through the erasure, Joel changes his mind. He tries desperately to preserve memories of Clementine by hiding her in parts of his brain the procedure may not reach.Considering that the past, present, fantasy, and reality all run together in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless  Mind"", it's amazing how coherent this film is. We go backward and forward, in and out of memories, switch between characters and subplots, and I never lost track of what was going on. Nor does the film ever lose its emotional focus. Michel Gondry and the film's editor, Vald&iacute;s &Oacute;skarsd&oacute;ttir, have done some amazing work. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfectly suited to their roles. Carrey is low-key, and Winslet takes on the hyperactive, outgoing role that is usually his. Kirsten Dunst does a nice job in a supporting role as Dr. Mierzwiak's enamored secretary. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are appropriately flakey as his technicians.  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the best films of 2004, and it deserved better than a tepid reception at the box office. Its brilliant direction, two big stars, and off-the-wall, but ultimately upbeat, script never fail to entertain.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, an audio commentary by director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, 4 deleted scenes, a music video, and a commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the memory erasure folks. ""A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (10 minutes) features interviews with the cast and principle crew in which they talk about their roles in the film. It's not insightful. ""A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry"" (15 minutes) contains more information about making the film and has some funny moments. The audio commentary isn't bad, but it does have a rambling quality and a lot of lulls. I would have liked more technical information, because the film is so innovative, but there is some discussion of how the film's very long shots were made. The music video is for the song ""Light & Day"" by Polyphonic Spree. Not a good video. It's too bad that the DVD does not include the theatrical trailer for the film, as it was one of the most creative and effective trailers in my memory.

No it is not perfect love, but it is about two people coming together and enjoying one anthers company.

The actors do a marvelous job of portraying daily life, and the director Michel Gondry, along with Kaufman's script, does a wonderful job of illuminating those everyday moments.I especially liked the idea that things revolve, and return, and are in a sense reborn.  The memory eraser company seems like science on the cutting edge; however, ethical dilemmas and personal endangerment highlight this as a man vs. machine theme too.

It turned out to be far better than anything I may have had in mind beforehand. Though billed as a romantic comedy, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a far cry from most of the ""chick flick"" type movies we see today. The film is surreal in nature, but the story is honest, touching, and surprisingly down-to-earth. The central character, Joel (Jim Carrey), is a quiet man, bashful and awkward around girls. Then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a vibrant and spontaneous young woman, and the two embark upon a tumultuous but passionate relationship. But this is only the beginning. After a particularly nasty fight, Clementine impulsively decides to undergo a procedure which will have Joel and all memories connected to him erased from her mind.When Joel discovers what his girlfriend has done, he is devastated, and decides to have the same procedure performed on himself to wipe Clementine out of his own memory. The procedure is done while he is asleep, and we see each of his memories played back just before it is erased forever. As Joel relives these memories, however, he begins to realize that he may not want to forget Clementine after all. He finds that he still loves her, and wants to hold onto the good things they had. But how can he stop the forgetting process once it has begun?The story may sound strange, but amazingly, it works. From the beginning it draws the viewer in, revealing enough to make us care about the characters, but concealing enough to keep us guessing. Unlike so many romantic comedies, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is anything but predictable. Right up to the last scenes, it is still unclear how everything is going to end. The atmosphere of the film is very surreal, and the style is quite fragmented, making for some confusion (this is intentional), but all the threads come together seamlessly in the end. This is a very artistic and thought-provoking film, and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has woven a plotline of surprising brilliance.Needless to say, the part of Joel is a significant departure for Jim Carrey from the roles he has played before. Unlike the wild, offbeat characters we are used to seeing from him, Carrey's performance here is almost understated. I was surprised by how heartfelt and genuine Joel was. We see none of Carrey's usual off-the-wall antics. This film showcases his acting ability, proving that he can portray a character with real emotional depth. Kate Winslet also turns in a terrific performance as Clementine. This is a bit of a departure for her, too, quite different from her roles in films such as ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Finding Neverland."" Here Winslet is a brash, spontaneous, and rather foul-mouthed young American woman. She pulls it off surprisingly well, creating a character that is at times flagrant and moody, but genuinely likeable nonetheless.The DVD Special Features (referring to the regular edition, NOT the 2-disc edition) are worth a look. The featurette ""A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" offers some great information on the filmmaking process. Cast and crew members provide their own insights into the making of the movie. Another featurette, ""A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry"" is just that; the two reflect briefly on various experiences on the set.

Kate Winslet is completely charming, as usual, and it's a bit of a stretch to think this guy could have been this miserable with her.  Once Jim Carey's character really understood what was happening, and began to fight losing his memories, it became interesting. When the two of them start trying to hide from the process, the story takes on a non-linear, almost poetic turn that is really unexpected and beautiful. There's also a nice subplot about the ways in which the technology is already being abused, and we get a most unexpected ending from an unexpected (Kirsten Dunst) source.I'd say this movie is a must see, because of the originality of the storyline.

Charting the story of Joel (Carrey), who upon discovering his ex Clementine (Winslet) has had her memory erased of him, decides to go through the process himself.  The only hitch is that halfway through the process, as he trawls backwards through his time with Clementine he wants to call the whole thing off.It's difficult to descrive the story in full partly because it's more of a movie you have to see rather than hear described.  Suffice to say that as well as being tightly scripted by Kaufman, it's also directed with verve and passion and visually it's brilliant.  Any fans of Kaufman will absolutely love it, and in my mind this combines the wacky off-the-wall humour of Being John Malkovich with the humanity of Adaptation.  Whilst it's true that Kaufman's brand of comedy isn't perhaps as exciting as it was in Being John Malkovich, but let's face it, this is heaps better than the usual dross.  As a matter of fact, this is actually more poignant than the promotion would have you believe.  Not only is it stuffed full of literary allusions but the relationship between Joel and Clementine is sensitively drawn, as are the dynamics between the other characters.The acting is also brilliant.  Carrey gives his most restrained, human performance yet, surpassing even The Truman Show with his glum, miserably, introverted Joel.  Winslet hits the big time again after a string of fantastic performances in lower budget affairs, and doesn't disappoint.  It's a credit to her that we never find Clementine annoying for a single moment.  Of the supporting players, Elijah Wood breaks out of the Frodo role by playing a loveable nerd and Mark Ruffalo shows that he can be a real asset to a film as long as he's given an interesting role.  The only real casting problem is Kirsten Dunst, who seems to have plateaued acting-wise after her dreamy performance in The Virgin Suicides.  Whilst she continues to pick good roles, she hasn't had anything to really test her for a while.More than anything else though, with just a few movies, Kaufman has proved to be a big name in intelligent, interesting movies and one that can even rescue the term 'romantic comedy' from out of the doldrums.

The movie's strength lies in its originality and creativity, two elements much needs in film.  This movie has screenwriter Charlie Kaufman written all over it.  You will find the elements of ""Being John Malkovich,"" threaded throughout.  Especially in the area of the suspense of reality in order to tell an internal tale of human motivation and ultimately love.The title is a quote from Alexander Pope (or Pope, Alexander depending on how you look at it), ""How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! / Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.""John Carrey and Kate Winslet turn in great performances as two polar opposites that find themselves destined to be together despite the difficulty of learning to live so closely with another person (a person you won't always agree with, be treated nice by, be nice to, etcetera, etcetera...but a person you love just the same).  They find themselves still drawn together despite selective amnesia.  The film takes a while to develop and the viewer finds himself waded around through Carrey's character's unconscious mind as he seeks to hold on to the one thing that matters to him in life...the love of a completely impulsive alcoholic (go figure).In the end you might find the non-linear approach to be off-putting, or the subject matter to be too much on the ""deep"" side, but you will find it boils down to a drama about how lives are intertwined in mutual attraction and love, despite all reason, despite all logic, sometimes despite self-preservation.  The heart trumps the mind once again in matters that last, in matters of life choices.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what Kaufman is trying to say with ""Eternal Sunshine.""

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","From the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a stunningly original film that features possibly career best performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet as doomed couple Joel and Clementine.  When Joel learns that Clementine that undergone a proceedure to erase her memories of him, Joel strikes back by undertaking the same treatment.  However, as the proceedure gets underway, Joel realizes that throughout their tumultuous relationship, he has and will always love her, and he fights to save his memories.  As you can tell by the plot synopsis and previous reviews, Eternal Sunshine is not a film for everyone and it's not something that is instantly likeable.

And then there's the bit players, if you could call Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood bit players. The supporting cast in this movie is excellent. There isn't a weak elemant anywhere.Then we come to plot. Top notch. I wouldn't call the ending a surprise ending, although some people might not see it coming, but it is a hopeful ending. The movie leaves you with a great feeling. The feeling that we are something more than our experiences and our mind. That certain things are destined to turn out for the best no matter what.

It's also one of the most moving. The basic plot of the movie is this: A shy Joel (Carrey) meets the outgoing Clementine (Winslet), and the two fall in love. After a horrible fight/break up, Clementine undergoes a procedure that erases Joel from her memory. In the heat of anger, Joel himself signs up for a similar procedure. However, mid-way through the erasure, he changes his mind. The viewer is granted an opportunity to inhabit Joel's mind as he tries to hold on to the final shreds of his love with Clementine.The movie interestingly explores themes relating to love. When you really love someone, and the realtionship ends badly, you ARE tempted to wish the whole mess had never happened. This movie shows us what a tragedy it would be if our wishes were granted.I thought Jim Carrey did a fabulous job in this film; I don't think I've seen him turn in such a layered performance in anything else he's ever done. It's just such an original concept - the thought that you could erase people, places, things, from your memory. But if you erase things that bring you pain, you also erase some of the joy out of your life. And you erase part of who you are. If you erase your mistakes, you don't learn from them.

Simple, moving, intelligent, well written, and perfectly acted, what more could one ask for?!I have read some reviews that said that the plot was complicated, but I must fiercely disagree; the plot is as easy to follow as it is easy to watch. Woman erases man, man wants to erase woman, man changes his mind. The real fun is in watching them escape from memory to memory in a funny, tear-jerking move to save his love from extinction.This movie is perfectly acted. Carrey gives, easily, his finest serious performance, and probably his best overall. One can literally see the pain in his face, which is looking its age I might add; never-the-less, for the first time I was moved by one of his performances. Other great jobs in the film were done by: Dunst (perfect for the cute, free secretary), Ruffalo (looking good in the undies), Wilkinson (in a role that nearly mimics that of _In the Bedroom_), and Wood (great as the unlikable thief). However, these, to me, pale in comparison to the superb (and hopefully Oscar winning) performance of Kate Winslet as the off the wall girlfriend with a thousand haircolors. She really blew me away (as she always does).See this move, bottom line. It is not just a crazy ""art movie"" like so many I have talked about.

620307,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00005JMJG,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[11, 12]","It is, despite the Truman Show, still a bold move to cast Jim Carrey in any movie that doesn't require outrageous slapstick. Here, Carrey is not just required not to gurn, but to play the most anally retentive character in the film. As a concept, you would think, that would be madness. But, and with a surprising amount of ease, it works. Carrey is credible and likeable as the everyman Joel Barish. Just as Joel is believably uptight (bearish, even?), Kate Winslet's Clementine is believably flaky, and their relationship (besotted at first, but ultimately at wits' end with each other) rings very true.This film is not principally concerned with the memory eraser process. That is simply a device which allows the film maker to explore what would happen if two people who have grown apart really did make the proverbial fresh start without the complications of their existing history interfering. The conceptual holes that misunderstanding pedants might seek to pick are intended rather to underscore the point that this really isn't possible. The screenplay also explores the converse situation: what might happen if two people who, having just met and still in the throes of infatuation, are confronted with the reality of what life will be like down the track when, as the late Ian Curtis put it, ""routine bites hard, and resentment rides high"". Armed with that knowledge, would they still really give it a shot? It's a good question, and one which in real life never gets properly asked.Given the preponderance of ""twist"" movies in the last five years, I was interested to see that Kaufman deliberately defused a plot twist before it went off by presenting Joel's reconciliation with Clementine before showing their original separation. I wondered, for a while, why he did that, but I think there are two reasons. Firstly, to have the characters fall out of love, erase their memories and then miraculously meet up again as a denouement would be too cheap and manipulative - an audience of the sort Kaufman aspires to attract would see right through that and mark the film down heavily as a result. Secondly, the *fact* of their meeting up again, of itself, isn't what Kaufman is interested in: rather it is the presentation of their forgotten history once the meet-up has taken place. By giving up that fact before the commencement of play, Kaufman can disarm accusations of cheesy sentimentality.A large portion of the film takes place while Joel's memory is in the process of being erased. This allows Kaufman to place a (post-modern) tragic love story in the middle of a film about a couple who have already fallen out of love: Joel knows that, by his own intemperance (in commencing the erasure process in the first place), everything of his relationship (good as well as bad) will be lost as surely as if Clementine has died. As the process wears on, the more her sins pale into significance and they resemble star cross'd lovers, dashing from room to room avoiding the inevitable onset of sleep.There were two minor things I didn't understand. Firstly, while most of the medical characters were plot-functional, I couldn't fathom the Patrick character. I couldn't see what his point was, other than to assist Elijah Wood to de-typecast from a furry little hobbit. Query, though, whether ""oily little creep"" is the sort of type he really wants to be moving into. Secondly, unless I misheard, at one point Joel Barish was referred to as ""still Mrs. Carrey's little boy"". Was this a continuity error, or simply a playful bit of screenwriting from Mr Kaufman?I suspect we will never know.Beautifully shot and imaginatively staged, this one is definitely a keeper.Olly Buxton",5,Absolutely spotless,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,3684,"['Truman', 'Show', 'still', 'bold', 'move', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', ""n't"", 'require', 'outrageous', 'slapstick', 'Here', 'Carrey', 'not', 'just', 'required', 'not', 'gurn', 'play', 'most', 'anally', 'retentive', 'character', 'film', 'concept', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'madness', 'surprising', 'amount', 'ease', 'Carrey', 'credible', 'likeable', 'everyman', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'Just', 'Joel', 'believably', 'uptight', 'bearish', 'even', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Clementine', 'believably', 'flaky', 'relationship', 'besotted', 'first', 'ultimately', 'wits', 'end', 'other', 'rings', 'very', 'true.This', 'film', 'not', 'principally', 'concerned', 'memory', 'eraser', 'process', 'simply', 'device', 'film', 'maker', 'explore', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'proverbial', 'fresh', 'start', 'complications', 'existing', 'history', 'interfering', 'conceptual', 'holes', 'misunderstanding', 'pedants', 'might', 'seek', 'pick', 'are', 'intended', 'rather', 'underscore', 'point', 'really', ""n't"", 'possible', 'screenplay', 'also', 'converse', 'situation', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'having', 'just', 'met', 'still', 'throes', 'infatuation', 'are', 'confronted', 'reality', 'what', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'down', 'track', 'when', 'late', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'put', 'routine', 'hard', 'resentment', 'rides', 'high', 'Armed', 'knowledge', 'would', 'still', 'really', 'give', 'shot', 'good', 'question', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'properly', 'asked.Given', 'preponderance', 'twist', 'movies', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'Kaufman', 'deliberately', 'defused', 'plot', 'twist', 'went', 'off', 'presenting', 'Joel', 'reconciliation', 'Clementine', 'showing', 'original', 'separation', 'wondered', 'while', 'why', 'did', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'have', 'characters', 'fall', 'love', 'erase', 'memories', 'then', 'miraculously', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'denouement', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'cheap', 'manipulative', 'audience', 'sort', 'Kaufman', 'attract', 'would', 'see', 'right', 'mark', 'film', 'down', 'heavily', 'result', 'Secondly', '*fact*', 'meeting', 'up', 'again', ""n't"", 'what', 'Kaufman', 'interested', 'rather', 'presentation', 'forgotten', 'history', 'meet-up', 'taken', 'place', 'giving', 'up', 'fact', 'commencement', 'play', 'Kaufman', 'can', 'disarm', 'accusations', 'cheesy', 'sentimentality.A', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'place', 'Joel', 'memory', 'process', 'being', 'erased', 'Kaufman', 'place', 'post-modern', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'middle', 'film', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'fallen', 'love', 'Joel', 'own', 'intemperance', 'commencing', 'erasure', 'process', 'first', 'place', 'everything', 'relationship', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'as', 'surely', 'Clementine', 'died', 'process', 'wears', 'more', 'sins', 'pale', 'significance', 'resemble', 'star', 'cross', ""'d"", 'lovers', 'dashing', 'room', 'room', 'avoiding', 'inevitable', 'onset', 'sleep.There', 'were', 'two', 'minor', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Firstly', 'most', 'medical', 'characters', 'were', 'plot-functional', 'could', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'Patrick', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'other', 'assist', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'de-typecast', 'furry', 'little', 'hobbit', 'Query', 'though', 'oily', 'little', 'creep', 'sort', 'type', 'really', 'be', 'moving', 'Secondly', 'misheard', 'one', 'point', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'was', 'referred', 'still', 'Mrs.', 'Carrey', 'little', 'boy', 'Was', 'continuity', 'error', 'simply', 'playful', 'bit', 'screenwriting', 'Mr', 'Kaufman', 'suspect', 'will', 'never', 'know.Beautifully', 'shot', 'imaginatively', 'staged', 'one', 'definitely', 'keeper.Olly', 'Buxton']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Reading the negative so-called ""reviews"" of this gem is like reading a page or two of historical ""wisdom"" from a certain attention-craving, ex-(part-time)-governor from Alaska.  It's just sad to realize that our education system has failed THAT badly.Ah well, pointing at lemmings never makes them anything but sillier.About the movie:This critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning screenplay provides a typically brilliant, quirky and chancy role for Kate Winslet, who has opted to be in some of the most interesting (and intelligent) flix in the last two decades (and I ain't just talkin' 'bout Titanic, folks).  The supporting cast is also very good, and well-selected.The real surprise here is Carrey, who is almost exclusively known as a master of silly, physical comedy.  With the possible exception of The Truman Show, this may well be his best (and is certainly his most sensitive) role, ever.Entertaining on several tiers, this movie definitely has its hilarious moments, and is continuously entertaining. Though billed as a ""romantic fantasy"", the film also crosses into the realm of smart, speculative fiction-- reminiscent of Harlan Ellison, or Phillip K. Dick. Yet it also manages to keep its plot points grounded in the emotional realities common to anyone who's ever suffered for love.  And there are some quite touching moments, which might just have you in tears, as well.Well Done!",5,"Oh waaaa, my little brain hurts!",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1464,"['sigh', 'Thinking', 'just', ""n't"", 'style', 'country', 'anymore', 'Reading', 'negative', 'so-called', 'reviews', 'gem', 'reading', 'page', 'two', 'historical', 'wisdom', 'certain', 'attention-craving', 'ex-', 'part-time', '-governor', 'Alaska', 'just', 'sad', 'realize', 'education', 'system', 'failed', 'THAT', 'well', 'pointing', 'lemmings', 'never', 'anything', 'movie', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenplay', 'typically', 'brilliant', 'quirky', 'chancy', 'role', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'opted', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'flix', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'talkin', 'Titanic', 'folks', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'well-selected.The', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'Carrey', 'who', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'known', 'master', 'silly', 'physical', 'comedy', 'possible', 'exception', 'Truman', 'Show', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'certainly', 'most', 'sensitive', 'role', 'ever.Entertaining', 'several', 'tiers', 'movie', 'definitely', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'continuously', 'entertaining', 'Though', 'billed', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'film', 'also', 'realm', 'smart', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'reminiscent', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'also', 'keep', 'plot', 'points', 'grounded', 'emotional', 'realities', 'common', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'suffered', 'love', 'are', 'quite', 'touching', 'moments', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'tears', 'well.Well', 'Done']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620313,ADE852UR9121C,B00005JMJG,perfecto,"[6, 7]","Few movies engage the mind and touch the soul like this one. It is based on a simple premise but it is told in such a way that leaves me in awe everytime I watch it.Joel is an all-round nice guy who lives a very normal and quiet life. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Clementine shows Joel the wild side of things. She makes things exciting. They're in love. But it's not long before each finds the other annoying. They feel suffocated in the relationship, and they want out. Clementine goes to a clinic and gets her memories removed. Joel, who finds out about this decides to do the same and we are shown glimpses of memories that is being erased while Joel is, in fact unconcious in his living room.If I was unclear about the story, I'm sorry...but this is a movie that you have too see to truly understand. What grabbed me most about this movie was the screenplay and the acting. The story is something we all can relate to...I mean, who hasn't been so in love only to find that it's not working out and soon, you wish that you never met that person. Based on this, Charlie Kaufman has conjured a magnificent story about these two people, as different as light and day, who end up being happy with each another. The love between the characters are described in specific memories, and moments rather than words...and that's the true beauty of this movie. Because of this, it does not end up being like every other romantic movie out there. This movie also questions the viewer, if given a chance...would you really give up the memories of a past love? Would it make you happier? If that love is strong enough, could it bring the two of you back together? These are some of the questions that I pondered upon watching this movie. Charlie Kaufman deservedly won an Oscar for this screenplay.The acting was also superb. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances here. I was mesmerized by what he brought to his character. Kate Winslet also shines in her role as Clementine. Their acting made the love between their characters seem so real and honest. They strengthen Kaufman's script so well that the whole movie seems natural. The supporting actors are no less impressive. The whole cast brings a certain authenticity to the movie.To be honest, I have not watched a movie as good as this for a long time. It gives a breath of fresh air towards a dying genre of movies in Hollywood, and that is romance. Intelligent, creative and original are some of the words I would choose to describe this movie.

Hardly!Kaufman takes the most direct route to the human mind. Forget reality, forget the mind numbing qualities of most romantic comedies, that lead to predictable and therefore extremely boring conclusions.This film is an exploration of human memory, and asks the question ""what if we were able to erase memories we didn't want; memories too painful to live with?"" and what follows is one of the most emotional and realistic depictions of human relationships I've ever seen.Recent films like ""closer"" bordered on pretentiousness, and kept an emotional distance between the audience and the characters, with an end that could only be depressing-so critics can say how ""poignant"" it is-even though, let's face it, depressing ends are starting to become more popular than happy endings these days.""Eternal sunshine"", while exploring the darkness and light of relationships is able to draw sympathy for its characters. This film actually is poignant.The direction is amazing. It's one of those rare films that takes the ""full circle"" approach, getting your attention right from the beginning and maintaining it throughout.Although it's a very emotional piece with a strong message it remains objective with more of an open ending, that some have observed as being depressing, while others (like myself) find a (realistic) positive ending.The good thing is you can appreciate this in your own way.

A smart, out-of-the box and funny script by Charlie Kaufman, a good director and dynamite performances make this both thought-provoking and greatly entertaining.Jim Carrey, whose manic/zany performances turn me off, is brilliant here (as he was in The Truman Show).  He plays vulnerable so well, I'd like to see him do more of that.  The early scenes with him on the bus, wanting to talk to the girl, but terrified of actually doing it, are perfect.Kate Winslett is always good.  Here her youthful joie de vivre makes an indelible impression on Joel, the Carrey character, and on the audience.  As Clementine, aka Tangerine, with her multicolored hair and quixotic personality she makes a perfect match to the shy introvert Joel.A subplot, involving the employees of a company that erases troublesome memories works in its own bizarre way.  Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are all very good in their roles.I got a little bored with the flashbacks to Joel's childhood, wanting Mommy to hold him, etc.  They were a little too literal for my taste.  But there was so much that was wonderful that I won't subtract a star from the rating.Some of my favorite scenes:-Carrey and Winslett playing in the snow at the beach.

Whoa!  Cinema doesn't get much better than this---it reminds me of the emotional honesty of John Cassvetes' films.I didn't care all that much for Kaufman's films, ""Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation.""

Rarely do you get to see such a movie that makes you think of what a unique concept the storyline of the movie is, commend on the actor's performances, and also make you feel good about the movie. `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' does exactly that.The story revolves around Joel (played by Jim Carrey) who meets Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) and starting a relationship with her. However, later Clementine gets tired of being with Joel, and decides to go to this organization that removes memories from the minds of various people. Clementine loses all her memories of Joel. Joel, on the other hand, discovers what has happened and decides to get this mind erased as well...but during the process realizes how precious some of his memories with Clementine were. Can he stop his memories from getting erased in time? Will he win Clementine back or has he lost her forever?`Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind' is a very unique movie unlike any other that I have ever seen. It gives a very surreal effect while you are watching the movie, yet after you have finished seeing it, makes you feel that the story is really believable. From the first scene itself, you will be drawn to the story immediately. Although it is a little hard to understand what is going on at first, in the end, you find that everything fits into place and makes sense. Even though I was a little skeptic about whether Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet would pair off well in the movie before watching it, they both gave a wonderful performance.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't overly technical with color and technical innovation, but it does have the greatest screenplay writer in the world, the great Charlie Kaufman.  Here is a writer as legendary as any actor or director. Look him up on Goggle and you'll see his amazing story.Jim Carey (Joel) is a likable slump and Kate Winslet (Clementine) is the pretty but troubled wild girl.  They meet, they love, they screw up, they hate each other, and they break up.  Then Tom Wilkinson, the brain doctor, erases their memory of each other.  We suspend belief because the script goes a little science fiction with the medical procedure that erases bad memories, humiliations, foolish fears, or any other unpleasantness of a lifetime.  During the procedure Joel changes his mind and he rebuilds his psyche in order to retrieve the magic in love.There is a secondary story.  Kirsten Dunst is playing her first adult role, a doctors' receptionist.  Her memory is erased also, so that she doesn't wreck Wilkerson's marriage.  Hmm, I see this is getting difficult to explain.  Know that this film had a decent emotional punch.  Loving another person is very difficult over a long period.  Not everyone gets the hang of it.  After all, it takes two to tango.

I have read some negative reviews on this movie where people seem to complain about how they prefer Jim Carrey to be `Jim Carrey' AKA the persona that plays the mask, Ace Ventura, liar liar, Bruce Almighty etc. Well I can't blame him for wanting to explore his other side, even if we, the public, prefer to have our funny bones tickled. What if, in his next movie, he played a violent rapist? Would we bitch and moan about how we want our friendly likable persona back, or praise him to the stars if he did a decent job? Who knows? Onto the film, I personally enjoyed it. To me it demonstrates how, when we our hurt by someone we care about, we see them in a wholly negative light, and if asked, we will rant about all their bad points. I know I've done it in the past. Joel gets severely hurt by Clementine. He then decides to completely erase her from his memory. Before the procedure he compiles a tape about his feelings for her. All are negative. About how he dislikes her for this trait and that trait of her personality. Only halfway through the procedure he realizes that she has many positive qualities about her and remembers all the happy and meaningful memories they shared as well as the bad. And since there is not one without the other he tries, in vein, to stop the procedure. To cling onto those precious, irreplaceable memories. I thoroughly enjoyed this film I didn't find it complicated, but it was certainly thought provoking. I recommend that you rent it first though.

David Roe,"[2, 2]","""How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sun-shine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.""Nearly three hundred years ago Alexander Pope in his poem ""Eloisa to Abelard"" satirized a world that mistakenly assigned ""virtue"" to the cloistered and empty life.  What is the virtue of innocence when one simply fails to make any mark at all on the world?  To ""forget"" the world and avoid its temptations and ignore its intrinsic unfairness is to miss engaging with the defining part of what it is to be human.Charlie Kaufman takes Pope's criticism of the ""virtue of avoidance"" and turns it on modern society.  What he targets is our present-day habit of routinely turning to medicine and drugs to cushion ourselves from the pain and unpleasantness of everyday life.  Instead of dealing with reality, we simply ""take a stress pill"" as Kubrick's HAL9000 computer of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" advises.  Yet the narcotized bliss we experience is as empty as Pope's hollow virtue.  We feel nothing but we also learn nothing about ourselves.Don't expect the annoying, mugging Jim Carrey of ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb and Dumber.""  Here he plays Joel, a hermit-like nebbish whose life is briefly transformed by a chance encounter with a quirky extrovert, Clementine (Kate Winslet).  When their relationship goes sour, he must confront his return to the emptiness of his prior existence.  After learning that the memories of their brief affair can be destroyed by a simple outpatient procedure, he opts to avoid the pain by having the memory of her surgically ""removed.""Yet after the procedure begins, the unconscious Joel begins to regret his decision and realizes that -- despite the pain he associates with their past relationship -- he must protect and defend his memories of Clementine from a doctor intent on tracking them down and destroying them in a mad chase through the labyrinthian passages of Joel's mind.This movie is not for everyone -- but it should be.  I give it five stars because in a world of mindless entertainment, this movie not only challenges you to keep up with its frenetic pace, it gives you the chance to be a bit better off than you were when you started.

What I say about likely won't capture what makes it so utterly charming and inescapably honest.There's the standard stuff -- the performances, for example, are uniformly excellent. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey deliver what may well be the finest performances in their careers for this film, and Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo also show up with some wonderful acting. The visual effects are sharply original and incredibly well-executed, so that they add to the film's story rather than serving as a distraction from it. The script is top-notch, conveying a rare complexity and a clear message through a unique story that nevers fails to captivate.If I say that this is now one of my favorite films, will that mean anything to you? It is one of my new favorites -- frankly, it's one of the best new movies I've seen in a long time, and it's a movie I know I'll be thinking about for a long time to come, and which I'll see many times again. I already know this, because it's captured my spirit and my imagination in a way that only a few movies have. ""Fearless"" was (and is) one such film, ""Leon"" is another. These are among my favorite movies, and now ""Eternal Sunshine"" is too.The concept of the film is deceptively simple, a straightforward ""what-if"" story: what if painful memories could be just plucked out of our head? How would that affect our lives? How would it affect our selves? To explore this concept, ""Eternal Sunshine"" looks at the lives of two lovers who were once happy, but had a painful breakup. The film takes us through the process of one of these characters, Joel, as his memories of Clementine are removed from his mind.The way this movie expresses memory is what makes it so magical. The fractured, interconnected, tenacious nature of our most treasured memories is examined closely here, with an honesty that is refreshingly rare. The complex way Joel's memories intermingle (like his childhood memory of Huckleberry Hound and his adult memory of Clementine's name) is expressed with such clarity, such honesty... here's the part where it would be easy to say too much and ruin it all. Suffice it to say that this is a film which understands how we cling to our memories, how our memories cling to the heart, and how the heart yearns for that which is lost.Have I said anything to convince you? I don't know... I'm still a bit swept up in the movie myself, and that's all I'm really trying to say here. The acting, the writing, the direction, the music -- all were excellent in ""Eternal Sunshine."" But what I really want to get across is that here, here at last is a film which might just capture your imagination the way it has mine, which might just set your heart beating and your mind racing and your soul reaching out for an unnamable something, a something which we rarely see but can all understand.

620337,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JMJG,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","The basic premise is that Jim Carrey's character, already despondent over losing his great love, Kate Winslet, becomes even more despairing when he learns that she has erased him from her memories using a procedure developed by the Lacuna Corporation.  It's a sorta sci-fi premise, true, but the technical trappings of the movie are almost non-existent.In many ways, this is a love story, or at least a story that explores the nature of love. As Carrey submits to the process of erasure, he ""experiences"" his memories of the relationship in a sort of reverse order, and begins to regret his decision.  We see the memories...many of them painful and unlovely, and we experience them on the usual level of watching a romantic comedy.  But we also see Carrey experiencing their erasure, and we feel for him and Winslet on a different level.  The movie (as you might expect from the writer of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and ADAPTATION) bounces around in time a bit, but frankly, it doesn't seem that hard to grasp what's going on.  His memories are in reverse...that's not hard...and they are a little weird, because memories are a little like dreams...so we accept their oddity.  But the memories feel very specific and real too, and that's why we get sucked in by the characters.In a sorta subplot, we meet the four main people who run Lacuna.  Tom Wilkinson, a really terrific older actor (IN THE BEDROOM, is the chairman of the company.  His office feels like the office of a low-brow bookkeeper or shady dentist, not a scientist on the cutting edge.  We get the idea that perhaps this procedure isn't quite as refined as one might like yet.  Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are his ""techies,"" a nerdy bunch with lots of social problems of their own.  And Kirsten Dunst is the administrative assistant with a secret.  The night that Carrey's memories are being erased takes up most of the time in the movie, and we jump back and forth from his internal experiences and the goings-on of the Lacuna bunch.The movie is terrifically acted.  I've read many people say ""Jim Carrey has never been better.""  This is true, in a way.  He really disappears into this essentially non-humorous role.  At one point, he is playing himself as a young child, but other than that, he plays it ""straight"" and we mostly forget it's that wild and crazy Ace Ventura guy.  It's a real treat to see Winslet, as always.  She's such a daring and generous actor, with a spot-on American accent.  Her character is quirky and difficult to like, but she infuses is with loads of pathos, humanity and energy.  She and Carrey really play off each other...Carrey usually just plows right over his co-stars...this time, Winslet pushes right back, and they are a nice couple.The supporting cast are all fine.  I like Mark Ruffalo, particularly.  Elijah Wood is supremely unlikable, which is a good stretch for him.  Dunst is a tad underwritten, and thus, when her big secret is revealed, one's reaction is to shrug ones shoulders a bit.  What she does when her secret is revealed is a bit of a stretch, too.  She becomes a bit of a device at the end...I didn't totally buy that she would do what she does with Wilkinson's records.  So, for that reason, I dock the movie about a quareter of a star.The other quarter to a half star goes for the Carrey / Winslet relationship.  We see how they meet, which is well explored, and feels real and awkward, like a new relationship does.  We see how they crumbled, and that feels real and ugly, just like a long-time relationship coming to a bitter end.  But somehow, I missed the cozy, comfortable, settled-in portion of their relationship. We can't go from the heat of the first date to the ice of the end without seeing the comfortable middle...yet the movie skimps on those details.So, the film gets 4.25 stars.  But it is nonetheless HIGHLY recommended for anyone who has experienced adult, painful romance or for anyone who can appreciate a film that never takes the easy way and seldom gets predictable.",4,A triumph of imagination!,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,4007,"['basic', 'premise', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'character', 'already', 'despondent', 'losing', 'great', 'love', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'even', 'more', 'despairing', 'when', 'erased', 'memories', 'using', 'procedure', 'developed', 'Lacuna', 'Corporation', 'sorta', 'sci-fi', 'premise', 'true', 'technical', 'trappings', 'movie', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existent.In', 'many', 'ways', 'love', 'story', 'least', 'story', 'nature', 'love', 'Carrey', 'process', 'erasure', 'experiences', 'memories', 'relationship', 'sort', 'reverse', 'order', 'regret', 'decision', 'see', 'memories', 'many', 'painful', 'unlovely', 'experience', 'usual', 'level', 'watching', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'also', 'see', 'Carrey', 'experiencing', 'erasure', 'feel', 'Winslet', 'different', 'level', 'movie', 'might', 'expect', 'writer', 'BEING', 'JOHN', 'MALKOVICH', 'ADAPTATION', 'around', 'time', 'bit', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hard', 'grasp', 'what', 'going', 'memories', 'are', 'reverse', 'not', 'hard', 'are', 'little', 'weird', 'memories', 'are', 'little', 'like', 'dreams', 'so', 'accept', 'oddity', 'memories', 'feel', 'very', 'specific', 'real', 'too', 'why', 'get', 'sucked', 'characters.In', 'sorta', 'subplot', 'meet', 'four', 'main', 'people', 'who', 'run', 'Lacuna', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'really', 'terrific', 'older', 'actor', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'chairman', 'company', 'office', 'feels', 'office', 'low-brow', 'bookkeeper', 'shady', 'dentist', 'not', 'scientist', 'cutting', 'edge', 'get', 'idea', 'perhaps', 'procedure', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'refined', 'one', 'might', 'like', 'yet', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'are', 'techies', 'nerdy', 'bunch', 'lots', 'social', 'problems', 'own', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'administrative', 'assistant', 'secret', 'night', 'Carrey', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'erased', 'up', 'most', 'time', 'movie', 'jump', 'back', 'forth', 'internal', 'experiences', 'goings-on', 'Lacuna', 'bunch.The', 'movie', 'terrifically', 'acted', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'people', 'say', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'true', 'way', 'really', 'essentially', 'non-humorous', 'role', 'one', 'point', 'playing', 'young', 'child', 'other', 'straight', 'mostly', 'forget', 'wild', 'crazy', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'guy', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'Winslet', 'always', 'such', 'daring', 'generous', 'actor', 'spot-on', 'American', 'accent', 'character', 'quirky', 'difficult', 'like', 'loads', 'pathos', 'humanity', 'energy', 'Carrey', 'really', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'Carrey', 'usually', 'just', 'plows', 'right', 'co-stars', 'time', 'Winslet', 'pushes', 'right', 'back', 'are', 'nice', 'couple.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'fine', 'like', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'particularly', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'supremely', 'unlikable', 'good', 'stretch', 'Dunst', 'tad', 'underwritten', 'thus', 'when', 'big', 'secret', 'revealed', 'one', 'reaction', 'shrug', 'ones', 'shoulders', 'bit', 'What', 'when', 'secret', 'revealed', 'bit', 'stretch', 'too', 'bit', 'device', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'totally', 'buy', 'would', 'do', 'what', 'Wilkinson', 'records', 'So', 'reason', 'dock', 'movie', 'quareter', 'star.The', 'other', 'quarter', 'half', 'star', 'Carrey', '/', 'Winslet', 'relationship', 'see', 'how', 'meet', 'well', 'explored', 'feels', 'real', 'awkward', 'new', 'relationship', 'see', 'how', 'crumbled', 'feels', 'real', 'ugly', 'just', 'long-time', 'relationship', 'coming', 'bitter', 'end', 'somehow', 'missed', 'cozy', 'comfortable', 'settled-in', 'portion', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'heat', 'first', 'date', 'ice', 'end', 'seeing', 'comfortable', 'middle', 'yet', 'movie', 'skimps', 'details.So', 'film', '4.25', 'stars', 'nonetheless', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'experienced', 'adult', 'painful', 'romance', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'never', 'easy', 'way', 'seldom', 'predictable']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620339,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00005JMJG,Robert Graves,"[4, 5]","This is a difficult movie to review. I assume you're reading this for one of two reasons: 1) because you want to maybe glean something from my review that might help you decide if you want to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or 2) because you didn't understand any of it and have come for answers.My assumptions aren't entirely unfounded, since in the last week I've have about 7 phone calls that were covered by the 2 above options, since friends knew I'd seen it twice and heard I loved it. I'll take you through one of these conversations, much in the same way Charlie Kauffman takes us through Eternal Sunshine.1. Question: I heard it's weird...would I like it?Answer: Did you see Being John Malkovich or Adaptation?(if NO, proceed to *A*, if YES proceed to *B*)A. Kaufman writes in a very unique voice, and Eternal Sunshine is no exception. You should probably rent Being John Malkovich first, then make the decision to go see Eternal Sunshine. If you like BJM, you'll probably enjoy ESOTSM.B. Did you like these movies?(if NO, proceed to * a.*, if yes proceed to *b.*a. If you saw both BJM and Adaptation and didn't like either of the movies, I'm skeptical that you would like Eternal Sunshine. BJM, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine all convey profound philosophical points about the state of man, but they do it in a way that requires you to suspend disbelief for 90 minutes. If you haven't been successful at suspending disbelief in the other films, you probably won't here either, so in order to avoid having you see the film, hate it, waste twenty dollars taking your girlfriend, and then hate me for telling you to see it, I'm going to recommend you avoid this movie. (Really, I'm hiding a challenge in here, and I'm hoping you'll find it and be ticked enough to still go see it, while I'm safely absolved of leading you there.)b. What are you waiting for? If you liked BJM and Adaptation you'll love Eternal Sunshine. It's told the most brilliantly of any of them, the acting is amazing (as in all of them) and the message portrayed is quite literally, a potentially life-changing one. Don't take any bathroom breaks during the movie - sit there from beginning to end. You'll thank yourself later when you're not asking your date a slew of stupid questions.2. Question- Okay, I didn't see BJM or Adaptation and I don't have time to. What can I expect from Eternal Sunshine?Answer: You can expect to see a beautiful story told in a nonlinear way, that, if you follow it, will deliver a profound message of love at the end, one that might change the way you view the person sitting next to you in a big way. This is accomplished because the filmmakers are able to set up an alternate world which you may (or may not) buy into. Once you do, they can then illustrate massive points that they otherwise couldn't. For example, they couldn't have analyzed the deepest concepts of identity unless they first got you to believe there was a portal that took you into John Malkovich's mind. Once you accepted that, they could show you things in a direct and powerful way, a method unavailable in traditional filmmaking.3. Question- I heard it's told all out of sequence and is hard to follow. Is it?Answer: yes it's very much out of sequence and it can be hard to follow. On top of that, it's hard to tell what's happening in reality and in Jim Carrey's head. But there are clues if you are looking. If you're an intelligent person and you pay attention to the movie, it's not hard to understand exactly what's happening and when.But, this doesn't always happen, does it? So here are the common dialogue for those of you who've seen but don't understand.4. Question- How could Joel and Clementine have met twice? Was one real and one dream?Answer: No, they were both real. They met twice, both times at the same beach. The first meeting we see in the film (when Clementine's hair is Blue and they ride back on the train) is actually the second time they met in ""real life."" Chronologically, the first time they meet is shown very late in the film, when Joel is sitting on the stairs of the beach house and she joins him, steals his chicken, etc.Their entire one year relationship happens between these two ""first"" meetings.5. Question- But Joel freaked out and ran out of the beach house (in the ""real"" first meeting). How did they get back together?Answer: This was answered by a memory that was shown just before the scene where Joel runs out. Joel goes into the bookstore (the scene when all the books are turned backwards, pages facing out) and has a conversation with Clementine, where she says, ""You just ran out."" This referred to the beach house incident. It was in that bookstore conversation that they decided to start their relationship.6. Question- why couldn't he hide her in his old memories?Answer: He tried, but Howard always found them and destroyed them. This is why he didn't remember his favorite childhood toy, Huckleberry Hound. (When they met at the beach house he sang ""Clementine"" and mentioned huckleberry hound. But after he had the erasing process, on the train [in the second meeting] he didn't remember anything about Huckleberry Hound or the Clementine song - those childhood memories were erased when he tried to take her there.)Bottom line, this was possibly the most powerful film I've ever seen. If you think there's a chance you might like it, do yourself a favor and go. (And if you could follow this review, you'll probably do alright at the film : )",5,Kaufman nailed it again,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,5498,"['difficult', 'movie', 'review', 'assume', ""'re"",

620342,A379FTDQT1NKSN,B00005JMJG,Robert Pratte,"[5, 9]","This movie, like Being John Malkovich, does a good job of bringing surrealistic and experimental elements into a ""mainstream"" setting.  Before I realized that this movie shared directors with Being John Malkovich, I found a number of similarities and started to place it within the modern surrealistic framework.  However, if you found the latter movie interesting but a bit too esoteric, the somewhat tamer Eternal Sunshine may be a better choice.  I would say that it is a mixture of Being, Serendipity, and Weird Science.Of course, if you are more of a purist, then you may find this one too mainstream.  Personally, I found the ending a bit too neat and predictable and the story a bit too polished.  I really enjoyed certain scenes - great camera work, excellent editing, engaging acting - but these highs made the lows more stark.That being said, this is a fine movie to add to one's collection.  My slight reservations aside, this movie is far forward of much of today's pathetic fare.  There is enough here to excite the eyes and mind without traveling too far into the fringes to alienate most viewers.

Well, wacko screenwriter Charlie Kaufman apparently has, and the result is a truly amazing movie by music video director Michel Gondry (check out his work with Bj&ouml;rk).Joel Barish (Carrey) is a very introverted, shy man, who is afraid of letting his feelings control him. He decides one day to skip work and heads to the beach - the kind of thing he never does. While there, he sees a girl, who later rides the same train back home. Her name is Clementine Kruczynski (Winslet). She's the complete opposite of Joel. She's extroverted, emotional and wild. She dyes her hear in a variety of wild colors, blue, green, pink...tangerine.They end up getting together, but after a while, their relationship falls apart and they both decide, separately, to erase the memories of each other. They go to Lacuna, a laboratory of sorts run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Wilkinson).However, while the procedure is being done on Joel, he realizes he doesn't want to forget Clementine, no matter how hurtful those memories are. What follows is a crazy, emotional ride as we accompany Joel thru memory lane as past experiences are intertwined and deleted and re-lived.There's a sub-plot involving the lab technicians, Patrick (Wood), Stan (Ruffalo) and Mary (Dunst) and the relationship between them, Dr. Mierzwiak and the moral issues raised by the whole procedure of erasing memories.The acting on this film is simply superb. It seems Carrey can't do middle ground, he excels while on both extremes, either his maniac Ace Ventura outrageous persona, or on subdued turns like the one from this movie. He's very likeable as the somewhat loser-ish Joel, and the despair he shows while having his memories deleted is truly touching. Winslet shines as the wild and loveable Clementine. She is simply luminous and steals the show. The rest of the cast have less screen time, but manage to give great performances, especially Wood in a role very different from his Lord of the Rings character, and Ruffalo, who, like Johnny Depp, seems to be better if the character is that much quirky and off.The directing is also very good, particularly the memory erasing scenes. They're a wild ride with a lot of things not making sense, disappearing or being warped. Joel's mind is dimly lit to reflect it not being a happy place.But the true gem of this film is it's script. Kaufman has managed to produce yet another work of genius, just as his previous efforts (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Human nature and Confessions of a dangerous mind).

620346,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMJG,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","In the modern world, we've come to rely on technology as a means of deadening our pain and mitigating the unpleasant realities of our lives.  We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness.  But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us?  Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all?  It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings?  Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real?  These are just some of the questions posed by ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, "" a romance-cum-science-fiction tale that is yet another demanding, provocative brainchild of Charlie Kaufman, the man responsible for ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation.""In ""Eternal Sunshine,"" Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man.  However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences.  In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory.  When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her.  The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.The synopsis for this movie fails to do justice to the sheer brilliance of both the concept and the execution, as we are taken through a cascading cavalcade of reality and fantasy, memories and recollections, all highly revelatory of the relationship between these two people.  The movie is like a glorious kaleidoscope in which the writer and director, Michel Gondry, continually twist the picture in such a way that we never know what the next image or concept will be, yet with their hands so firmly placed on the instrument that we always know where we are at all times.  Even if we don't always understand every single scene or image at the moment we are seeing it, we know that it will all make sense once the full scenario has played itself put.  If ""Eternal Sunshine"" reminds us of any one movie, it is most likely Stanley Donen`s ""Two For the Road,"" that great 1967 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney that also used an ingenious structure of interlocking time periods and events to show us the growth and disintegration of a romantic relationship.  ""Two For the Road"" did it while operating solely on the level of conscious reality; now, Kaufman, by delving into the subconscious world of half-remembered incidents and ephemeral dreams, ratchets up the concept a notch or two higher.  Even though ""Eternal Sunshine"" keeps shifting the planes of its reality, the audience never loses its bearings for a single moment.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have never been better than they are here, creating characters who are compelling, likable and utterly believable as they make their way through this convoluted but wonderfully challenging maze of a screenplay.  It's amazing how believable and touching Carrey and Winslet manage to be in the midst of all this seeming disorder.  They root the film in the human reality all fantasies need to be compelling.Towards the end, as the film brings all its disparate elements together on a single plane of reality, the movie asks us to ponder yet another difficult and challenging question:  is it possible for two people in a failed relationship to drift apart for awhile, then reunite successfully if they go into the renewed relationship fully cognizant of those elements that drove them apart the first time around?  It is just one of the many intriguing ideas to consider in this brilliant, creative and thoroughly fascinating film.As with Kaufman's  previous cinematic mindbenders, ""Eternal Sunshine"" occasionally feels a bit too cute and a bit too clever for its own good.  However, this film suffers less from this malady and feels to be more of a piece than his earlier works.  With a Kaufman film - and with ""Eternal Sunshine"" in particular - we know we're getting something original, unique and intellectually demanding, which is far from the normal state of affairs when it comes to mainstream American moviemaking.  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a film for the ages.",5,movie genius,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,5090,"['modern', 'world', ""'ve"", 'come', 'rely', 'technology', 'means', 'deadening',

620349,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B00005JMJG,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[8, 8]","I watched this movie recently per a friend's recommendation, when it actually came out I did not have any interest as I am not a big Jim Carrey fan. When I was told Carrey's performance was as good as in `Truman Show' I decided to watch it.The movie basically tells the story of  Joel and Clementine, they had a relationship that did not end well, luckily for both, there is a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) who offers an alternative to suffering from heart breaking: erase all the memories related to a person. While the premise sounds a little too weird (written by Charlie Kauffman who previously gave us `Being John Malkovich'), it establishes a very interesting possibility, what if you could do this? (There is a funny moment in which we get to see an old lady waiting for the memories of her dead puppy to be erased.. if you have suffered the loss of a dog you'll understand). The director makes you think about it for a while; yes, we do all have memories we would wish to go away, but would we do it? Is it better to forget than to face and learn from the experience? The `memory deleting' situation is definitely one of the best moments of the film.And it is because in Joel's `memory deleting' process (which takes the most part of the film), we get to see all their memories together... tender moments that make you realize what a wonderful relationship they had. It is in this moment in which Joel faces the fact that he may not want to delete Clementine from his head. There are other subplots related to the characters who perform the `memory deleting' which are ok but do not add anything of value to the central story of Joel and Clementine.While it has some funny moments the movie is not a comedy, actually Carrey's acting is superb in his character of quiet and indecisive Joel, Kate Winslet performs great as supporting Clementine in Joel's brain while his memories are being deleted.Do not be fooled by the premise of the film, it is a very serious movie about relationships and what we learn from them. Directed by Michel Gondry (who has in his resume some of Bjork's best music videos) you can expect not only a good film but also a very interesting visual experience.",4,A bizarre yet delightful love story,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2184,"['watched', 'movie', 'recently', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'when', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'interest', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'When', 'was', 'told', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Truman', 'Show', 'decided', 'watch', 'it.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'story', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'had', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'luckily', 'doctor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'alternative', 'suffering', 'heart', 'breaking', 'erase', 'memories', 'related', 'person', 'premise', 'little', 'too', 'weird', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kauffman', 'who', 'previously', 'gave', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'very', 'interesting', 'possibility', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'funny', 'moment', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'lady', 'waiting', 'memories', 'dead', 'puppy', 'be', 'erased..', 'have', 'suffered', 'loss', 'dog', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'director', 'think', 'while', 'yes', 'do', 'have', 'memories', 'would', 'wish', 'go', 'away', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'forget', 'face', 'learn', 'experience', 'memory', 'deleting', 'situation', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'film.And', 'Joel', 'memory', 'deleting', 'process', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'memories', 'together', 'tender', 'moments', 'make', 'realize', 'what', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'had', 'moment', 'Joel', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'delete', 'Clementine', 'head', 'are', 'other', 'subplots', 'related', 'characters', 'who', 'perform', 'memory', 'deleting', 'are', 'ok', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'value', 'central', 'story', 'Joel', 'Clementine.While', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'not', 'comedy', 'actually', 'Carrey', 'acting', 'superb', 'character', 'quiet', 'indecisive', 'Joel', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'great', 'supporting', 'Clementine', 'Joel', 'brain', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'deleted.Do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'premise', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'movie', 'relationships', 'what', 'learn', 'Directed', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'who', 'resume', 'Bjork', 'best', 'music', 'videos', 'can', 'expect', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'visual', 'experience']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620350,A1CEK79P47OADL,B00005JMJG,ruby717,"[11, 12]","We all know how the saying goes: ""It is better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all."" Just because something doesn't work out doesn't mean that it was a waste of time. It you're very lucky, you can learn from your mistakes. Everybody needs their memories, both good and bad-especially bad, to learn from them and not repeat them.That is the basic point of 'Eternal Sunshine.' As the film opens, Joel (played to perfection by Jim Carrey) impulsivly skips work to go to Montauk. There he meets Clementine (the lovely and amazing Kate Winslet), a woman so different from him she might just be perfect for him. They have an instant bond and everything seems fine for these perfect strangers.However, as the film continues, we find out, in a bout of dramatic irony, that Joel and Clem aren't strangers-they are past lovers who have no memory of each other. At the end of their crumbling relationship, Clem impulsivly had her memory of Joel ereased. Heartbroken and angry, Joel went to have the same procedure, founded by Howard Meirzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and performed by technicians including Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood, retiring gracefully from 'Lord of the Rings') and Mary (Kirsten Dunst). Most of the film takes place in Joel's head as he is having the procedure. He relives/remembers his memories with Clem, working backwards from the crumbling end. However, as time goes by (or backwards), he realizes that there were some really beautiful memories of them, and that they were in love. So he tries to ""hide"" her in memories where she doesn't belong, much to the frustration of the technicians doing the procedure. The film also cuts to the three technicians doing the procedure at Joel's house while he is asleep. We find out that Patrick is now dating Clem by using Joel's lines, and that Mary and Stan are lovers but she is in love with Howard, but she has no idea of her own past. In fact, it is Mary, not Joel or Clem, who makes a 180 and realizes the power of memory and tries to undo her, and others', mistakes.I have no idea where to begin. This film was by far the best film of 2004. French music video director Michel Gondry uses his visual knowledge and wisdom to create a beautiful, wonderful and crazy atmosphere, using little to no special affects, just camera moves and choreography, to make wonders. Also, the freedom that he gives to his actors to improvise enhances all of their performances. If you aren't already familiar with composer Jon Brion's work (Magnolia, I Heart Huckabee's), I can assure you that you will now-his dreamy atmospheric music totally enhances the scenes in every way. Charlie Kaufman, the brilliant and manic mind behind the Oscar nominated films 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' finally won his first Oscar for his crazy and beautiful script.And then there's the acting. I am in total awe of Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey. You have never seen them in roles like these before. At first I was knocked out of my chair, waiting for them to suddenly become ""themselves"", but they never got out of character ONCE. Actually, their roles are switched-it is Jim Carrey playing the introverted and shy character and Kate Winslet playing the spontaneous and free character. On the outside they look like water and oil, but underneath the skin they are the same blue ruins.As tough as the male competition was for Best Actor, I still argue and am shocked that Jim Carrey didn't get nominated for his role. He was totally inside Joel's head the entire time and you truly believed Jim's performance. Actually, it wasn't even a performance-he WAS Joel. And Kate Winslet proves that she is one of the greatest living actresses today. She keeps Clem exciting and witty, but also allowing us to see Clem's vulnerable side. As good as Hilary Swank was in Million Dollar Baby, I just really wanted to see Kate take home her first Oscar, in the most exciting performance of 2004. Jim and Kate have the best chemistry in a long draught of awful ""romances"" over the years-different as they are, they complete each other and you really believe why they are both in love and love each other. Together they were, well, spotless.I can say without being over-entheusiastic that 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is easily one of the best films ever made. It is wildly romantic, undeniably original, incredibly poignant, and surprisingly real.

Keep in mind that you are still heartbroken over the end of the relationship. Would you be able to live with the memories knowing that she didn't even know you?In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey's character Joel is plagued with the decision to erase Clementine from his memory or not. He decides to, but halfway through the process changes his mind.This movie is unconventional, heartfelt, and hard to put into a category. It is simply amazing. One truly feels the tumultuous emotions that a romantic relationship entails. Instead of simply presenting the great times like some film makers might have done, all sides of the relationship are shown. Clementine is presented as the eccentric, nagging, and complex person that she established herself to be in Joel's mind. Joel is almost exactly her opposite, but through his struggle to deal with Clementine's personality and later his fight to keep even the tiniest memory of her, the audience is given insight to the love that is being erased. The plot unfolds mysteriously almost like a dream.The supporting cast is also wonderful. Elijah Wood plays Patrick, Clementine's desperate new boyfriend. Kirsten Dunst's character Mary works with Patrick and is subject of a plot twist midway through the film.The beginning of the movie can be better understood when the film is completed. It helps make clear the moral that love is unavoidable and sometimes destiny.I am not sure why this film is considered a comedy.

620353,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JMJG,Samuel Chell,"[4, 8]","Perhaps my mistake was watching this immediately after ""Stranger than Fiction,"" an equally overworked, derivative premise about a repressed, unfulfilled personality who requires not so much the extermination of his pedestrian self as the recovery of his more vital self (i.e. he needs the right, ""spontaneous,"" life-endowed woman).  The prototype is Chris Marker's 1962 masterpiece, ""La Jetee,"" a film that's as profound as it is fresh, provocative, and haunting.  The problem with these later spin-offs is not their lack of originality. Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob's Ladder"" is one of several films to approach ""La Jetee""'s greatness.  But these most recent efforts are low-budget formula pictures with big-budget stars that unfortunately lend validity to ""Chick Flick"" as a dismissive term for the whole sub-genre.The performances are often of Oscar-worthy quality.  But I don't recall Rosalind Russell (""His Girl Friday"") or Katherine Hepburn (""Adam's Rib"") ever being wasted in scripts so unworthy of their talents as are Emma Thompson and Kate Winslett.  Of the two present films, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is the better-made movie, but ""Eternal Sunshine"" is more ambitious and multi-dimensional.  The decidedly anti-intellectual message of ""Stranger"" is: Smelling and eating fresh-baked cookies not only satisfies the palate but heals the incomplete soul more surely than the agonized meanings of great literature.  ""Spotless Mind"" might be said to test this thesis by offering the viewer quotes from Nietszche (""Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders"") and Alexander Pope (""How happy is the blameless vessel's lot/The world forgetting by the world forgot/Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"").The problem is that the quotes are spoken out of context, as if the characters of the film (and their creator) are clueless to the irony of the quoted statements, both of which condemn forgetfulness and deride the notion of a ""spotless mind.""  As if it weren't bad enough that the writers of the screenplay make mockery of Chris Marker's achievement, they misrepresent Nietszche and Alexander Pope, both of whom prefer to the sunshine of the spotless mind the mind that is alive ""because"" it remembers the past, however painful or imperfect it may be.  (How often I ponder the question of which is worse: the destruction of the world's great literary texts or the distorted, gross and even dangerous interpretations to which such texts, including the Bible, are subjected by tone-deaf, unimaginative, utterly ""selfish"" readers.)Both films overstay their welcome, attempting closure and not finding it. At least ""Spotless Mind"" provokes genuine reflection, and perhaps some minimal self-scrutiny at that.  Were the writers of the film as unashamedly didactic and verbal in their exit strategy as the makers of ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" I would have offered them the following (by Kierkegaard):  ""When one has once fully entered the realm of love, the world - no matter how imperfect - becomes rich and beautiful, it consists solely of opportunities for love.""",3,Far from a spotless movie,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,3084,"['Perhaps', 'mistake', 'was', 'watching', 'immediately', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'equally', 'overworked', 'derivative', 'premise', 'repressed', 'unfulfilled', 'personality', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'extermination', 'pedestrian', 'self', 'recovery', 'more', 'vital', 'self', 'i.e', 'right', 'spontaneous', 'life-endowed', 'woman', 'prototype', 'Chris', 'Marker', '1962', 'masterpiece', 'La', 'Jetee', 'film', 'as', 'profound', 'fresh', 'provocative', 'haunting', 'problem', 'later', 'spin-offs', 'not', 'lack', 'originality', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'one', 'several', 'films', 'approach', 'La', 'Jetee', 'greatness', 'most', 'recent', 'efforts', 'are', 'low-budget', 'formula', 'pictures', 'big-budget', 'stars', 'unfortunately', 'lend', 'validity', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'dismissive', 'term', 'whole', 'sub-genre.The', 'performances', 'are', 'often', 'Oscar-worthy', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'ever', 'being', 'wasted', 'scripts', 'so', 'unworthy', 'talents', 'are', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'two', 'present', 'films', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'better-made', 'movie', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'more', 'ambitious', 'multi-dimensional', 'decidedly', 'anti-intellectual', 'message', 'Stranger', 'Smelling', 'eating', 'fresh-baked', 'cookies', 'not', 'only', 'palate', 'incomplete', 'soul', 'more', 'surely', 'agonized', 'meanings', 'great', 'literature', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'test', 'thesis', 'offering', 'viewer', 'Nietszche', 'Blessed', 'are', 'forgetful', 'get', 'better', 'even', 'blunders', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'How', 'happy', 'blameless', 'vessel', 'lot/The', 'world', 'forgetting', 'world', 'forgot/Eternal', 'sunshine', 'spotless', 'mind', '.The', 'problem', 'quotes', 'are', 'spoken', 'context', 'characters', 'film', 'creator', 'are', 'clueless', 'irony', 'quoted', 'statements', 'condemn', 'forgetfulness', 'deride', 'notion', 'spotless', 'mind', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'writers', 'screenplay', 'make', 'mockery', 'Chris', 'Marker', 'achievement', 'misrepresent', 'Nietszche', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'whom', 'prefer', 'sunshine', 'spotless', 'mind', 'alive', 'past', 'however', 'painful', 'imperfect', 'may', 'be', 'How', 'often', 'ponder', 'question', 'worse', 'destruction', 'world', 'great', 'literary', 'texts', 'distorted', 'gross', 'even', 'dangerous', 'interpretations', 'such', 'texts', 'including', 'Bible', 'are', 'subjected', 'tone-deaf', 'unimaginative', 'utterly', 'selfish', 'readers', 'films', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'attempting', 'closure', 'not', 'finding', 'least', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'provokes', 'genuine', 'reflection', 'perhaps', 'minimal', 'self-scrutiny', 'Were', 'writers', 'film', 'unashamedly', 'didactic', 'verbal', 'exit', 'strategy', 'makers', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'would', 'have', 'offered', 'following', 'Kierkegaard', 'When', 'one', 'once', 'fully', 'entered', 'realm', 'love', 'world', 'matter', 'how', 'imperfect', 'becomes', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'solely', 'opportunities', 'love']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620354,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JMJG,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 3]","Charlie Kaufman reaches for greatness in writing ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and he nearly gets it: His poignant, knowing examination of love lost and the memories it leaves behind bursts with pain, humor and originality. It is slightly undone by the art-house approach of director Michael Gondry, the music video wunderkind who strikes a distanced, muted tone in the first scene and presses the dreary. The movie never shakes free of it. And yet it is moving, and features the best performance of Jim Carrey's career.Carrey is Joel, a tall, sluggish ""nice"" guy in skullcap and perpetual slouch; he works a nameless job somewhere in New York. He ditches work as the movie opens, heads to the beach in winter. He takes his journal. As he writes he finds it strange: He hasn't written in it in two years. A woman walks nearby. She's got blue hair and big sparks in her eyes. Clementine (Kate Winslet) sneaks shots of booze into her coffee and approaches Joel on the subway back to the city.Clem does not want to hear that Huckleberry Hound song about her name. Joel's never heard of it. He has, but it's been erased. By Lacuna.In Kaufman's world, Lacuna is run by a frumpy, quiet psychoanalyst (Tom Wilkinson), operates out of a brownstone and excels at wiping memories, painful, even blissful, from your mind. Bring everything that might have reminded you of it, or him, or her. Lacuna burns the stuff, then burns the memories, like warts.Joel and Clementine have met before, we learn. Dated, in fact, for two years. As the remainder of ""Eternal Sunshine"" unfurls, we understand how the Lacuna process works, and why Joel - who's chosen erasure after he discovers Clementine has erased him - tries and fails to reverse the sequence once he's under anesthesia and inside his own, quickly fading memories of his relationship with Clementine.Brilliant as the construct is, the movie's real heart resides with Carrey and Winslet, who create a believable sad, opposites-attract couple who admire the traits in one another - calm likeability in Joel, outgoing spirit in Clem - more than they can love and learn to live with those traits. Clem changes her hair color with her moods, and seemingly her personality, while Joel likes to remain right...where...he...is. The relationship is a failure. And yet Joel decides, as he watches a quiet moment with Clem slip away in his sleep, he wants the pain and joy of their time together. ""Eternal Sunshine"" is honest but hopeful about love, sad but redeeming.The rest of the film doesn't work as well. The Lacuna employees (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and a surprisingly creepy, good Elijah Wood) have their own secrets and schemes, and seem to have had their own minds erased a few times. Kaufman's original script developed this trio better; Gondry has pared down those characterizations, and cut an important framing device that book-ended Kaufman's initial work, to get more from the Carrey-Winslet coupling. The result is uneven when switching between the central love story and the functions of Lacuna.Joel's dream sequences account for at least half the movie, and they are murky and strange - good, but occasionally out of focus. Gondry succeeds in suggesting dream logic. He also succeed at lulling the audience. ""Eternal Sunshine"" is an exceedingly quiet, somber experience.Contrast that with Kaufman's other works, ""Adaptation,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and you get the sense Gondry missed some of the irony and fun of this story. We never feel in the throes of a terrific movie. We float by it. As with Joel and Clem, the movie is easier to appreciate than it is to enjoy.",4,"Not quite what Charlie had in mind, but still poignant.",1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,3668,"['Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'greatness', 'writing', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'nearly', 'poignant', 'knowing', 'examination', 'love', 'lost', 'memories', 'bursts', 'pain', 'humor', 'originality', 'slightly', 'undone', 'art-house', 'approach', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'music', 'video', 'wunderkind', 'who', 'distanced', 'muted', 'tone', 'first', 'scene', 'dreary', 'movie', 'never', 'free', 'yet', 'moving', 'best', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'career.Carrey', 'Joel', 'tall', 'sluggish', 'nice', 'guy', 'skullcap', 'perpetual', 'slouch', 'nameless', 'job', 'somewhere', 'New', 'York', 'work', 'movie', 'heads', 'beach', 'winter', 'journal', 'strange', ""n't"", 'written', 'two', 'years', 'woman', 'nearby', 'got', 'blue', 'hair', 'big', 'sparks', 'eyes', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'shots', 'booze', 'coffee', 'approaches', 'Joel', 'subway', 'back', 'city.Clem', 'not', 'want', 'hear', 'Huckleberry', 'Hound', 'song', 'name', 'Joel', 'never', 'heard', 'been', 'erased', 'Lacuna.In', 'Kaufman', 'world', 'Lacuna', 'run', 'frumpy', 'quiet', 'psychoanalyst', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'brownstone', 'excels', 'wiping', 'memories', 'painful', 'even', 'blissful', 'mind', 'Bring', 'everything', 'might', 'have', 'reminded', 'Lacuna', 'stuff', 'then', 'memories', 'warts.Joel', 'Clementine', 'have', 'met', 'learn', 'Dated', 'fact', 'two', 'years', 'remainder', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'unfurls', 'understand', 'how', 'Lacuna', 'process', 'works', 'why', 'Joel', 'who', 'chosen', 'erasure', 'Clementine', 'erased', 'tries', 'fails', 'reverse', 'sequence', 'anesthesia', 'inside', 'own', 'quickly', 'fading', 'memories', 'relationship', 'Clementine.Brilliant', 'construct', 'movie', 'real', 'heart', 'Carrey', 'Winslet', 'who', 'create', 'believable', 'sad', 'opposites-attract', 'couple', 'who', 'admire', 'traits', 'one', 'calm', 'likeability', 'Joel', 'outgoing', 'spirit', 'Clem', 'more', 'can', 'love', 'learn', 'live', 'traits', 'Clem', 'hair', 'color', 'moods', 'seemingly', 'personality', 'Joel', 'remain', 'right', 'where', 'relationship', 'failure', 'yet', 'Joel', 'quiet', 'moment', 'Clem', 'slip', 'away', 'sleep', 'pain', 'joy', 'time', 'together', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'honest', 'hopeful', 'love', 'sad', 'redeeming.The', 'rest', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Lacuna', 'employees', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'surprisingly', 'creepy', 'good', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'have', 'own', 'secrets', 'schemes', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'minds', 'erased', 'few', 'times', 'Kaufman', 'original', 'script', 'developed', 'trio', 'better', 'Gondry', 'pared', 'down', 'characterizations', 'cut', 'important', 'framing', 'device', 'book-ended', 'Kaufman', 'initial', 'work', 'get', 'more', 'Carrey-Winslet', 'coupling', 'result', 'uneven', 'when', 'switching', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'functions', 'Lacuna.Joel', 'dream', 'sequences', 'account', 'least', 'movie', 'are', 'murky', 'strange', 'good', 'occasionally', 'focus', 'Gondry', 'suggesting', 'dream', 'logic', 'also', 'succeed', 'lulling', 'audience', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'exceedingly', 'quiet', 'somber', 'experience.Contrast', 'Kaufman', 'other', 'works', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'get', 'sense', 'Gondry', 'missed', 'irony', 'fun', 'story', 'never', 'feel', 'throes', 'terrific', 'movie', 'float', 'Joel', 'Clem', 'movie', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'enjoy']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620357,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B00005JMJG,Sarah Schenkkan,"[0, 0]","From Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriter of ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"", and Michel Gondry, the director of ""Human Nature"", comes a supremely unique and delightful film; ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".Set in present day New York, ""Eternal Sunshine"" follows the story of reclusive Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who learns that his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) has erased all her memories of him from their recently ended relationship. Hurt and desperate, Joel seeks out Dr. Mierzwiak of Lacuna Inc. to give him the same procedure to erase Clementine from his mind. However, during the procedure, Joel begins to rehash his memories of his eclectic former love, and begins to rediscover his affections for her, while realizing how much her memories have now become a part of him. With that, he decides the rebell against Dr. Mierzwiak and his assistants by hiding Clementine in other memories in various corners of his brain to save her.Performance wise, the film is incredibly strong, in both the main characters and the supporting cast. Jim Carrey, whom you usually see playing in comedic roles, takes on a softer, somber, and more serious side, all the while interjecting his character with humorous dialogue and physical comedy. Kate Winslet, as the free spirit Clementine, is perfect for her role, embracing the wild child persona into a completely eclectic performance, all the while maintaining a realistic depth. Together, they create an unlikely likeable couple, whom you as the audience, adore. Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo (one of my personal favorites in the film) are all strong, well-established characters that complete the rich backdrop.As one of the most original and unique films of the year, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is absolutely fantastic, much owed to the intelligent screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, who in my opinion, should receive an Oscar, or at least a nomination for his work on this movie. The idea, which is also credited to the director Michel Gondry, is brilliant, and the script, while to some might be overwhelmingly sporadic, is delightfully out of order, all which contributes to an ingenious, satisfying climax and a film that holds the audience's interest as to what could come next. At times a dark comedy and at others a romance, it is a smart, funny, subtle, and overall entertaining film with a truly unique idea, all the while keeping the audience engrossed, as well as pleasantly dazed and confused as all the pieces of the film begin to fall into place.

Reminds me strongly of elements from Chris Nolan's Memento in form and substance to a large degree.  Joel Barrish is played by Jim Carrey in a dramatic, intensely emotional role and Kate Winslett plays Clementine, a wilful, brutally honest woman with an impulsive mind of her own.The story actually has a backdrop regarding a company called Lacuna, which specializes in wiping memories of those we've missed and rather than deal with the pain, we would rather forget about it.  Unfortunately trying to forget instead of deal with it is not so easy.Thus the good doctor that runs Lacuna runs a very brisk business.  People want to forget Fido or forget their dead husbands and wives, their broken hearts.  The doc and his employees are a pretty irresponsible, unethical bunch.The doctor himself uses the memory erasing techniques to wipe out his receptionist's affair with him.  Damn!  And Patrick, another assistant, uses Joel's memories to pick up on the girl Joel is erasing.  Stealing the files, Patrick's plan seems to work out OK for some time.  This part of the story was never resolved for me, since Patrick never was caught or punished for this clear doctor patient violation.Trying not to get too ""into"" the subplots, Joel overall seemed a good guy in this film but a bit addled and frightened by the memory erasure procedure, especially after he found out that his girl did the same thing.The special effects were well done and subdued -- memories erase, and Clementine and Joel hide in memories to prevent the erasing.The overall film, though very original and at times endearing and charming, did not hold my interest to a great degree.  Even so, Kate Winslett got an Academy Award nomination for best actress in 2004 for this film.Jim Carrey in a dramatic role never appealed to me, so I must protest the casting.What if you could erase memories of those you've loved and lost?  And could you trust a company that would do that for you not to go all unethical and irresponsible on you, and take advantage of your trust?Frightening concept.It is available as a one-disc Widescreen Collector's Edition worldwide.

Jim Carrey puts on a fantastic performance as a guy who is first erased, then erases back.  I don't think that's giving away too much.What it reminds you is that technology is not the way to solve your depression or your relationship problems.  It also reminds you that there are probably equal amounts of good memories in your past relationships, even if the bad ones are so bad they hurt.At times painful, at times a tad bit confusing, and at other times funny, this is a departure for Carrey.I enjoyed the movie, even finding myself wiping away a little tear.Now, for the other half of me.  My husband did not like this movie.  Apart from being an extreme stretch of the imagination and too much of a notion to accept (regarding the memory erase:  why not just erase the one bad memory?  why the whole peson?  An end to all the problems of the movie.....), he also thought there were some serious flaws in the continuity of the film.  For instance, we are led to believe that the characters have known each other for like hours or maybe a couple of days when he goes in to do the erase.

I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. You understand?""--Michael Corleone, Godfather Part II""The LORD God therefore banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken. When he expelled the man, he settled him east of the garden of Eden; and he stationed the cherubim and the fiery revolving sword, to guard the way to the tree of life.""--Genesis 3:23-24""I have no regrets! Everything I went through makes me stronger/the person I am today.""--In almost every girl's MySpace profile (with some variations)What things in our past have helped us grow? What have hurt us? Would we be better off without some events of the past? Or, is everything that has happened part of some bigger plan for our lives?Questions and issues such as these were raised in the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, starring Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey plays Joel, a heartbroken man who visits his girlfriend Clementine at the bookstore she works at only to find out that she either does not know who he is or is pretending as if to not know. Joel finds out that Clementine went to a special doctor who erased her mind of any memories of Joel so that she could get a fresh start and move past their tumultuous relationship as if it never existed. Joel, in hasty frustration, decided to undergo the same mind erasing, collecting all items he has that are associated with Clementine in order to undergo the deep mind cleansing sleep. But, once in the mind erasing sleep, Joel realizes how much he loves Clementine and tries to hold onto memories of her before he wakes up and she is gone.The first natural reaction to the decisions of Joel and Clementine is the nave teenage girl reaction. We can say, ""no way would I erase my memory. I have no regrets! Everything that happened has made me the person I am."" That is a shallow surface level reaction, though. We all have hurts. It does no good to sugarcoat them or play as if all the bad things really help. ""What doesn't kill me makes me stronger"" is a false clich&eacute;. Looking at our world of drug addicts and suicides, it is pretty obvious that, though some people come out stronger from trying ordeals, many are broken by their sad circumstances.I have some things in my past that I cannot just look at and say, ""it is good that that happened."" I have had people who have hurt me, where I cannot really say, ""I am glad that happened; it is a learning experience."" There are some things where I just have to say, ""there is no reason for that to have happened. Nothing can justify it. There is nothing to gain from this or learn from that.""There is also another dangerous view to take. It is to take the view that Joel and Clementine made the right decision to erase unhappy memories. This comes from the Cartesian viewpoint that has largely shaped the modern worldview since Descartes wrote in the 17th century, ""I think, therefore I am."" Based on observations of crazy people who saw things that were not really there, Descartes made the claim that there is really no way to know if the reality we see and perceive is really the way things are. After all, crazy people do not know that they are crazy. How is each of us to know that we are not really crazy, and we are not really seeing a skewed view of the world? Descartes says that each person can know for certain that he exists, since if you are doing the thinking, you must exist. But, beyond that, we cannot be certain of anything. ""I think, therefore I am"" means that I know I must exist since I am doing the thinking, but beyond that, I have no real way of knowing that anything else I think is real is really real.Slogans such as ""perception is reality"" descend from this Cartesian worldview. What one thinks is real is real for that person. A person's ""reality"" is what he perceives. A person's past is what he remembers. Each person has his own reality, separate from all other persons. Obviously, we cannot use time machines to literally change our pasts, but, according to a Cartesian, changing memories is essentially the same thing. If our perception is our reality, why not change things so that we can be happier?The problem with this idea is that, like the teenage girl with the no regrets view, it is also nave. Yes, we each perceive reality a little different. But, we perceive reality differently because there really is a reality to perceive. Most of us see things, though a little differently, almost the same. The few crazy people who really see things differently are an exception. There is an old saying that goes, ""The exception proves the rule."" When we notice that crazy people see things weirdly, it is because we know that there is a right way to see things, and thankfully, most of us see things rightly most of the time.Changing our memories, erasing our memories, though we all, if we are not nave, wish we could do sometimes, does not really change our pasts. It is an escape mechanism that we use so we don't have to deal with the past. As humans, our task is to deal with, and confront the things that happen to us. The ""I have no regrets"" viewpoint and the ""let's change our memories since perception is reality"" viewpoint both avoid actually dealing with our problems. It is not healthy to cut ourselves off from those who hurt us, like Michael Corleone does to his brother Fredo in the Godfather Part II. We also can't go back to the way things were before bad things happened. This is why God would not let Adam and Eve back into the Garden of Eden.The late classical/early medieval philosopher Boethius, in his Consolation on Philosophy, said that all fortune is good fortune, and, in particular, bad fortune is better than good fortune, because we can learn from it. That is, everything that happens to us, whether good or bad, is good, because we can learn from it. And, the bad things are ""better"", because we learn more from bad things. I am not so sure I entirely agree, but Boethius is right that we cannot ignore the things that happen. Like Jim Carrey's character Joel in his dream, he realizes that we cannot just grudgingly accept the past or ignore the past, but we must confront it.Did Joel and Clementine get back together?

Based on the premise that it is possible to delete selective memories, the question pops up: is this the right way to go after a bad relationship? Keep in mind that in order for the procedure to be successful they have to delete every little memory connected to that person, so you would lose the bad recollections, but also the good ones. So, is the trade-off worthwhile?The film starts in a somewhat confusing way, when we see Joel (Carrey) following an impulse one morning, deciding to ditch work for the day and run off to Montauk. Once he gets there he meets Clementine (Winslet), a girl of eclectic tastes regarding her hair-style and who works at a bookstore. Not only does Clementine change his hair following her impulses, but she also does other things that way. For example the same day she meets Joel, she declares ""I'm gonna marry you"". As you can probably guess, we get the feeling that there is something weird going on, which is explained by the fact that these two people have met before, but have erased each other from their memories.Joel and Clementine had a two-year long relationship that had its good and bad times, and which was so intense that when it ended, they could not bear remembering the details of it. So they went to Lacuna and took care of the problem. Michael Gondry presents all this information using a combination of what is going on in the present and events from the past, as well as incorporating very interesting and creative scenes that show the process to which the mind is exposed to when erasing the memories.At some points we get to feel some anguish connected to what is happening to the main characters, and this in my mind is a reflection of how well they perform in their roles. Carrey have been showing for quite some time that he is not only a funny guy, but that he can really act, following a similar career path as Tom Hanks. For more evidence of Carrey's outstanding acting I recommend ""The Majestic"". In the case of Winslet, I have not been a very big fan of her, but here she excels at her role and I got the same positive impression as in ""Finding Neverland"". It seems that she is maturing in terms of her acting career and improving consistently. When most people see that the movie features Jim Carrey they automatically think ""Comedy"", and as you can guess by now, this is not the case of the present movie. As long as you are clear on that, and are not looking for laughs, I believe that you will find the experience interesting, to say the least.",4,"""Please let me keep this memory""",1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,2595,"['movie', 'interesting', 'topic', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'while', 'Based', 'premise', 'possible', 'delete', 'selective', 'memories', 'question', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'bad', 'relationship', 'Keep', 'mind', 'order', 'procedure', 'be', 'successful', 'have', 'delete', 'little', 'memory', 'connected', 'person', 'would', 'lose', 'bad', 'recollections', 'also', 'good', 'ones', 'So', 'trade-off', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'way', 'when', 'see', 'Joel', 'Carrey', 'following', 'impulse', 'one', 'morning', 'deciding', 'ditch', 'work', 'day', 'run', 'off', 'Montauk', 'Once', 'there', 'Clementine', 'Winslet', 'girl', 'eclectic', 'tastes', 'regarding', 'hair-style', 'who', 'bookstore', 'Not', 'only', 'Clementine', 'change', 'hair', 'following', 'impulses', 'also', 'other', 'things', 'way', 'example', 'same', 'day', 'Joel', ""'m"", 'gon', 'marry', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'get', 'feeling', 'something', 'weird', 'going', 'explained', 'fact', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'have', 'erased', 'other', 'memories.Joel', 'Clementine', 'had', 'two-year', 'long', 'relationship', 'had', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'when', 'ended', 'could', 'not', 'bear', 'remembering', 'details', 'went', 'Lacuna', 'took', 'care', 'problem', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'information', 'using', 'combination', 'what', 'going', 'present', 'events', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'incorporating', 'very', 'interesting', 'creative', 'scenes', 'show', 'process', 'mind', 'exposed', 'when', 'erasing', 'memories.At', 'points', 'get', 'feel', 'anguish', 'connected', 'what', 'happening', 'main', 'characters', 'mind', 'reflection', 'how', 'well', 'perform', 'roles', 'Carrey', 'have', 'been', 'showing', 'quite', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'guy', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'following', 'similar', 'career', 'path', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'more', 'evidence', 'Carrey', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'recommend', 'Majestic', 'case', 'Winslet', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'here', 'role', 'got', 'same', 'positive', 'impression', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'maturing', 'terms', 'acting', 'career', 'improving', 'consistently', 'When', 'most', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'automatically', 'think', 'Comedy', 'can', 'guess', 'now', 'not', 'case', 'present', 'movie', 'As', 'long', 'are', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'laughs', 'believe', 'will', 'find', 'experience', 'interesting', 'say', 'least']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

After Joel (Jim Carrey) learns that his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her mind following a terrible argument, he decides to do the same.  He goes to the special clinic where the procedure is offered, and we meet the people who work there - as it turns out, they've got their own secrets and their own hidden entanglements.  They set to work on Joel's mind, zapping memory after memory of his relationship with Clementine, and as the procedure is being done, we see that Joel is regretting it.  He doesn't want Clementine out of his mind and, desperately, he tries to hide her deep in his brain, away from the merciless, pain-eradicating technology.The movie gives us an unsparing look at a relationship - what enchants one partner about the other, and how they also find things about one another that are really irritating and nearly intolerable.  But love is still worth it at the end...  it's beautiful to see Joel realize that; despite the boredom that can set in during a relationship or the arguments that might arise, he still loves this woman and what she has brought to his life.  Jim Carrey gives a great performance, full of quiet, subdued humor and real emotional pain.  It's wonderful how restrained he is...  even in one scene, where he is a four-year-old, he manages to make it funny without going over the top.Though I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief enough about the technology used to zap memories (especially the way the procedure was done, in Joel's home, with the technicians smoking pot and dancing half-naked on his bed), I liked the issues that the movie dealt with, how it didn't simplify things, and how much feeling ultimately came out of it at the end.

Most of the story is told as we see Joel's memories being erased.The story is told beautifully and the characters are completely alive.  We see the ups and downs of Joel and Clemintine's relationship.Finally, the movie is existential because Joel and Clemintine and everyone else who goes through the procedure is erasing who they are.  They are erasing their essence.  Without an essence one simply exists and there is nothing human about you.

620373,A2K0Y55A5KQSU7,B00005JMJG,Sloopydrew,"[9, 11]","A poetic film critic would describe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as being festive like happiness, buoyant like romance, fiery like a new love, and shattered like a broken heart.  And if a critic without a poet's soul is driven to retirement by trying to critique one of Charlie Kaufman's movies, I would imagine that a director without an artist's eye would be driven mad trying to commit Charlie's writings to film.This is undoubtedly Charles Kaufman's most circuitous work.  The screenplay is a veritable labyrinth of the human mind, heart and soul.  In the wrong hands, this movie could have been disastrous.  But, since tripping over some of the words Charlie typed out in Human Nature; Michel Gondry has learned Charlie's game.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind defies convention.  While it is one of the most beautiful romances to ever shine on the silver screen, it takes place almost entirely inside of one man's head.  That man is Joel Barish (Jim Carrey).  The only way Joel really expresses himself is through a journal where he puts down his thoughts and even draws up some pretty wild images.Joel's having an unusual day.  Valentine's Day is fast approaching and he's feeling the blues.  He's been single for quite a while, but doesn't think he has any chance of finding a girlfriend, being that he can't even look a female in the eye.  He's baffled by the recent discovery that he apparently ripped two years worth of his thoughts and drawings out of his journal.  Everything is building up, and Joel does something Joel never does ... Joel something spontaneous.Enter Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet).  Joel finds Clementine pouring booze into her coffee cup at the greasy spoon diner he eventually stops at.  Her hair's dyed a bright blue and her personality is no less colorful.  Clementine essentially forces herself on Joel.Joel tries to crawl inside himself, but Clementine isn't one to give up.  He's caught her fancy and she's going to have him, one way or another.  It's within minutes that she announces that the two of them will get married.  The two end up spending the day together.  When Joel leaves Clementine's apartment, she asks him to call her as soon as he gets home.  Joel calls and a new romance begins...There's obviously no question in this movie that love is indeed all in a person's head.  Even if love is nothing more than a chemical reaction and string of random memories, it is indeed real.  It's only when you decide to erase what makes love what it is -- the memory of love itself -- that love turns into nothing more than flowery words scribbled out on Hallmark cards.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an unconventional love story powerful enough to remind us that there's no such thing as unconditional love, but conditional love is more than enough.  Charles Kaufman takes us on the ultimate head trip in this film.  With help from a superb directing job by Michel Gondry, a wonderful cast and an insanely entertaining premise, Kaufman has created his finest piece of work to date.Love is fleeting, Kaufman tells us.  But fleeting love can be the best thing in the world.  And don't ever let yourself forget the good times you had, because, although they can never come back, they'll always be there waiting for you when you need them the most.",5,Fiery like a new love and shattered like a broken heart ...,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,3315,"['poetic', 'film', 'critic', 'would', 'describe', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'being', 'festive', 'happiness', 'buoyant', 'romance', 'fiery', 'new', 'love', 'shattered', 'broken', 'heart', 'critic', 'poet', 'soul', 'driven', 'retirement', 'trying', 'critique', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'movies', 'would', 'imagine', 'director', 'artist', 'eye', 'would', 'be', 'driven', 'mad', 'trying', 'commit', 'Charlie', 'writings', 'film.This', 'undoubtedly', 'Charles', 'Kaufman', 'most', 'circuitous', 'work', 'screenplay', 'veritable', 'labyrinth', 'human', 'mind', 'heart', 'soul', 'wrong', 'hands', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disastrous', 'tripping', 'words', 'Charlie', 'typed', 'out', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'learned', 'Charlie', 'game.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'convention', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'romances', 'ever', 'shine', 'silver', 'screen', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'one', 'man', 'head', 'man', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'only', 'way', 'Joel', 'really', 'journal', 'where', 'down', 'thoughts', 'even', 'draws', 'up', 'pretty', 'wild', 'images.Joel', 'having', 'unusual', 'day', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'fast', 'approaching', 'feeling', 'blues', 'been', 'single', 'quite', 'while', ""n't"", 'think', 'chance', 'finding', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'female', 'eye', 'baffled', 'recent', 'discovery', 'apparently', 'ripped', 'two', 'years', 'thoughts', 'drawings', 'journal', 'Everything', 'building', 'up', 'Joel', 'something', 'Joel', 'never', 'Joel', 'something', 'spontaneous.Enter', 'Clementine', 'Kruczynski', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'pouring', 'booze', 'coffee', 'cup', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'diner', 'eventually', 'Her', 'hair', 'dyed', 'bright', 'blue', 'personality', 'less', 'colorful', 'Clementine', 'essentially', 'Joel.Joel', 'tries', 'crawl', 'Clementine', ""n't"", 'one', 'give', 'up', 'caught', 'fancy', 'going', 'have', 'one', 'way', 'minutes', 'two', 'will', 'get', 'married', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'spending', 'day', 'together', 'When', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'apartment', 'call', 'as', 'soon', 'home', 'Joel', 'new', 'romance', 'obviously', 'question', 'movie', 'love', 'indeed', 'person', 'head', 'Even', 'love', 'nothing', 'more', 'chemical', 'reaction', 'string', 'random', 'memories', 'indeed', 'real', 'only', 'when', 'decide', 'erase', 'what', 'love', 'what', 'memory', 'love', 'love', 'nothing', 'more', 'flowery', 'words', 'scribbled', 'out', 'Hallmark', 'cards.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'unconventional', 'love', 'story', 'powerful', 'enough', 'remind', 'such', 'thing', 'unconditional', 'love', 'conditional', 'love', 'more', 'enough', 'Charles', 'Kaufman', 'ultimate', 'head', 'trip', 'film', 'help', 'superb', 'directing', 'job', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'insanely', 'entertaining', 'premise', 'Kaufman', 'created', 'finest', 'piece', 'work', 'date.Love', 'fleeting', 'Kaufman', 'fleeting', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'forget', 'good', 'times', 'had', 'can', 'never', 'come', 'back', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'there', 'waiting', 'when', 'need', 'most']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Kaufman's great visuals give physical form to Joel's memories and their systematic destruction: Houses disintegrate, faces become blurred and entire streets crumble as, neuron by neuron, the procedure progresses.We learn that the impetus for this voluntary brain damage is Joel's roller-coaster romance, and bitter breakup, with the impulsive Clementine (Winslet). As in 'Adaptation' Kaufman approaches love with a realism that is often deeply cynical but ultimately betrays a loner's desire to be loved. Everyman Joel and the untameable Clementine make a good pair, and most of us will be able to identify with their tumultuous relationship.An excellent, highly imaginative exploration of how the little things in life, good or bad, make us who we are.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[7, 9]","There hasn't been a movie ever since Pulp Fiction that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a genius form of storytelling.The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) and Kate Winslett (Titanic), Sunshine is an instant classic.The movie might be a little awkward, but the detailed direction of Michael Gondry gives you no excuse not to be able to follow along understanding what is going on. The film is about a shy man named Joel who meets an eccentric girl named Clementine (like the song!) and immediately they fall in love.Clementine's behavior takes a toll with Joel who begins distrusting her, so Clementine leaves him and erases him out of her memory with the help of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak, played by Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson. Joel goes crazy as a result and ends up at the same doctor's office to have his memory cleaned up of all memory of Clementine.Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind from here on. The essence of the picture is that Joel realizes, as his treasured memories of Clementine begin to fade away one after the other, that he still loves Clementine and attempts to get out of the procedure before it's too late.Jim Carrey is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future. Winslett, who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for Carrey.Eternal Sunshine is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years.Highly recommendedA+",5,One of the best movies of the past ten years!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1724,"[""n't"", 'been', 'movie', 'ever', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'really', 'made', 'watch', 'full', 'attention', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'next', 'scene', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'genius', 'form', 'storytelling.The', 'movie', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'original', 'plot', 'excellent', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Titanic', 'Sunshine', 'instant', 'classic.The', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'awkward', 'detailed', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'excuse', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'shy', 'man', 'named', 'Joel', 'who', 'eccentric', 'girl', 'named', 'Clementine', 'song', 'immediately', 'fall', 'love.Clementine', 'behavior', 'toll', 'Joel', 'who', 'distrusting', 'so', 'Clementine', 'memory', 'help', 'Doctor', 'Howard', 'Mierzwiak', 'played', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Joel', 'crazy', 'result', 'up', 'same', 'doctor', 'office', 'have', 'memory', 'cleaned', 'memory', 'Clementine.Most', 'movie', 'place', 'Joel', 'mind', 'here', 'essence', 'picture', 'Joel', 'treasured', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'begin', 'fade', 'away', 'one', 'other', 'still', 'Clementine', 'attempts', 'get', 'procedure', 'too', 'late.Jim', 'Carrey', 'quite', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'turn', 'turn', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'earn', 'Hollywood', 'praise', 'golden', 'statue', 'future', 'Winslett', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'work', 'here', 'incredibly', 'convincing', 'be', 'perfect', 'competition', 'Carrey.Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'past', 'ten', 'years.Highly', 'recommendedA+']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

I think they confuse ""funny"" with avante garde, or even quirky (and it's likely that the more conservative of them couldn't understand either anyway).  Overall, I thought the movie was so sad - the idea of being trapped in a situation where your precious memories are being erased, and there is nothing you can do about it, is simply heartbreaking to watch.The movie, which maps out a reverse transgression of what appeared to be a great relationship (meeting, dating, comfort-zone, annoyance and insecurity, then breakup) is something that anyone who's had a great girl/guy and let him/her go can relate to.  The script and the direction really drive it home, to the point where I felt that I was slowly losing this relationship as well.As many other reviewers might agree, it's worth more than one viewing.  While the movie isn't ""David Lynch"" abstract, it was still quite a pleasure to see it a second time and say, ""Ohhh...so that's what they meant at the end of the movie.""

620384,AYKM1B74OLEVC,B00005JMJG,Story Charts,"[1, 1]","ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of ""is it worth it?"" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub-plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film - the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been ""Love happens because of fate"". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again - he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes ""Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love"". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca",5,Love as Fate and Willing Acceptance,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,2445,"['ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'narrative', 'essentially', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'backwards', 'traditional', 'problem', 'reverse', 'narrative', 'new', 'way', 'traditional', 'problem', 'audience', 'already', 'ending', 'bitter', 'breakup', 'then', 'telling', 'story', 'reverse', 'audience', 'question', 'watch', 'story', 'back', 'beginning', 'falling', 'love', 'experience', 'rather', 'giving', 'dramatic', 'action', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'problem', 'intellectualization', 'giving', 'protagonist', 'active', 'role', 'reverse', 'narrative', 'Joel', 'able', 'interact', 'old', 'memories', 'try', 'stop', 'process', 'erasing', 'attempt', 'escape', 'major', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'catharsis', 'audience', 'rediscovery', 'love', 'Clementine', 'try', 'escape', 'together', 'fail', 'escape', 'climax', 'sub-plot', 'memory', 'erased', 'lovers', 'meet', 'again', 'fate', 'once', 'again', 'fall', 'love', 'fake', 'climax', 'main', 'love-story', 'plot', 'placed', 'beginning', 'film', 'again', 'end', 'film', 'audience', 'losing', 'memory', 'lovers', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'film', 'ended', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'central', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Love', 'fate', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Joel', 'went', 'huge', 'journey', 'discovery', 'change', 'go', 'waste', 'fate', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'put', 'together', 'again', 'be', 'one', 'making', 'active', 'choice', 'internal', 'change', 'climax', 'real', 'climax', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'reversal', 'end', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'discover', 'bitter', 'past', 'must', 'choose', 'not', 'commit', 'past', 'Joel', 'inner', 'journey', 'choose', 'commit', 'completing', 'Joel', 'journey', 'internal', 'change', 'external', 'action', 'central', 'idea', 'now', 'Love', 'happens', 'fate', 'will', 'only', 'result', 'happy', 'relationship', 'open', 'acceptance', 'other', 'painful', 'compromises', 'come', 'love', 'real', 'climax', 'fueled', 'true', 'character', 'change', 'dilemma', 'choice', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'climax', 'audience', 'catharsis', 'experienced', 'Joel', 'rediscovery', 'love', 'result', 'girl', 'are', 'touched', 'great', 'story.My', 'Story', 'Chart', 'movie', 'storycharts.ca']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

About half-way through the erasing he realizes that he doesn't want to forget Clementine and attempts to hide her which makes for some excellent comic relief.The good points to this movie are the way that Joel is inside his own head.

For once, she was the pessimist. (Write this date down!)To me it raised the interesting question of, if you know ahead of time how disappointing something is going to turn out, is it still worth going through anyway? Few things meet our expectations; the concept always outshines the actuality. But when you fall in love everything seems like it's going to be peachy for the rest of eternity. Disappointment almost always looms. It's how you deal with it that counts.Because even in the best relationship, you're going to get bored with each other. You're going to start to find small niggling faults becoming reasons for a major fallout. Most breakups aren't over big, dramatic actions (""You slept with my sister while you said you were on a business trip in Seattle!"") but rather small things that start to irritate you about the other person--the weird color they dye their hair, or how they say ""liberry"" instead of ""library.""This is what happens to both Jim Carey and Kate Winslet in this movie. And both of them, to forget each other, have their memories of the other person flushed out. But to paraphrase Tennyson, is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? That's the difficult question the movie grapples with, and the astonishing thing about it is that you never feel like it's ""grappling"" with it at all. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman knows how to deal with some uncommon themes (particularly in Hollywood, where any film in which the female lead doesn't take her top off or get hung upside-down on a meat hook is considered practically an art film these days) very naturally. Carey gradually discovers that even bad feelings have their upside, their purpose, because without them the good have no context. They're inseparable, and when the ""bad"" ones have to go so must the good. Too late he realizes this is not what he wants. Then a series of complications almost too twisted to chart ensue. Kaufman must have had a roadmap tacked to his wall to keep it all straight. The astonishing thing--and the tribute to his screenwriting prowess--is that we the viewers can keep them straight too. Despite a story that's almost impossible to re-tell, Eternal Sunshine is actually a very easy movie to watch, never confusing, never too fast or too slow. This is no small achievement.So that's my take on things. My wife's view is that the film was trying to say that no matter how many chances you get, you still make the same stupid mistakes. She cites as evidence the moment in the doctor's office where the receptionist tells a patient she can't have the procedure three times in one month. She cites as evidence the fact that although a key character (not Winslet) has her memory wiped clean, she turns around and does the same foolish thing with another person when the same opportunity presents itself. All true, but I think that's more of a subplot than *the* plot. The minor characters may fumble about, but our heroes Kate and Jim will learn something in the end from their stumbles, and they do, at an empty beach house, that has to be one of the saddest, most underwritten (in a good way), farewell scene I've watched in years (decades?). Kaufman and the producers trusted their audience. They didn't feel they needed to get out the pile driver. It's beautiful writing. I wish there were more intelligence like this in Hollywood these days.As some others have noted, this is first and foremost a director and writer's picture. It's not the acting that carries things along. Still, the right casting is important, for we really have to relate to these characters quickly, since we don't get a lot of exposition before things go nonlinear. In Jim Carney we have the perfect ""everyman."" I never care for Carey when he's manic or crazy, but beneath the ""over-the-top"" persona there beats the warm heart of a genuine artist. Brit Kate Winslet astonishes at how effortlessly she plays a very American, very ordinary character--every semi-big town is full of ""individualists"" like Clementine, with her ever-changing hair, Doc Marten boots, and terminal retail career outlook. (""I'm just a f---ed up girl looking for her own piece of mind!"") Both characters have the tough and thankless job of appearing unremarkable while making us care about them very much. Kirsten Dunst plays the Cameron Diaz role--a nice but ditzy blonde who spends a lot of time dancing around in her underwear. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo look like they should have the Verizon wireless Network behind them. (How the sophisticated job of memory erasure is done with a couple of laptops and some simple software is hilarious.) And Tom Wilkinson is effortless, as usual, in the supporting role of the doctor who runs the clinic that vacuums minds the way those cheap professional maid services vacuum carpets. (You never quite trust them in your house. Are they going to break your porcelain knick-knacks? Raid your fridge and drink your beer?)But mostly it's the ideas--and the way they're executed--that makes Eternal Sunshine so memorable. Extras include lots of interviews with Carey and director Michel Gondry, Winslet and Gondry (where things start out a little testy, and no, I don't think they were kidding), a making-of featurette that includes the scoop on how they did the remarkable special effects (not how you'd think in this digital day and age), and lots of other goodies we've come to expect from hit movies. Transfer to DVD is excellent. This is one of the more intelligent films to come out in recent years.

620393,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JMJG,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[6, 7]","Director:  Michael GondryCast:  Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Gerry Robert Byrne, Elijah Wood, Thomas Jay Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, Jane Adams, David Cross, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson.Running Time:  108 minutesRated R for for language, some drug and sexual content.One of the most unique and heartwarming films of the year, ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is remarkable in its delivery and supreme in its scope.  Joel (Jim Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet).  She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click in ways even they can't pinpoint, but from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.  However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is ""technically brain damage"", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision, wanting the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.""Eternal Sunshine"" is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed ""Human Nature"". He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.  Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.  There is a very deep message in ""Sunshine,"" and it is arguably screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's (""Adaptation"") deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies of the year.",5,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  (2005),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,4056,"['Director', 'Michael', 'GondryCast', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Gerry', 'Robert', 'Byrne', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Thomas', 'Jay', 'Ryan', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'David', 'Cross', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson.Running', 'Time', '108', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'drug', 'sexual', 'content.One', 'most', 'unique', 'heartwarming', 'films', 'year', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'remarkable', 'delivery', 'supreme', 'scope', 'Joel', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'socially', 'inept', 'had', 'girlfriends', 'none', 'really', 'meant', 'anything', 'never', 'had', 'significant', 'relationship', 'kind', 'one', 'day', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'wild', 'kooky', 'changing', 'hair', 'color', 'red', 'orange', 'blue', 'green', 'depending', 'current', 'mood', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Joel', 'click', 'ways', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'moment', 'meet', 'know', 'something', 'special', 'there', 'However', 'silly', 'argument', 'breaks', 'up', 'relationship', 'Clementine', 'visit', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.', 'company', 'wiping', 'troubling', 'memories', 'away', 'forever', 'decided', 'erase', 'memory', 'Joel', 'When', 'Joel', 'friends', 'angrily', 'do', 'same', 'Clementine', 'erasing', 'completely', 'mind.The', 'erasing', 'process', 'mapping', 'memories', 'night', 'process', 'erasure', 'technically', 'brain', 'damage', 'according', 'doctor', 'bulk', 'film', 'place', 'process', 'Joel', 'mind', 'most', 'recent', 'memories', 'are', 'first', 'go', 'watch', 'slowly', 'disappear', 'nothingness', 'recent', 'memories', 'are', 'bitter', 'witness', 'arguments', 'boredom', 'relationship', 'time', 'memories', 'get', 'better', 'travel', 'backwards', 'watch', 'Joel', 'Clem', 'best', 'moments', 'loving', 'life', 'loving', 'other', 'Joel', 'desperately', 'decision', 'wanting', 'inevitable', 'erasure', 'stop', 'completely', 'powerless', 'Soon', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'forgot', 'film', 'attempts', 'foil', 'process', 'retain', 'recesses', 'mind', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'directed', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'who', 'also', 'helmed', 'Human', 'Nature', 'flare', 'Kaufman', 'words', 'perfect', 'symmetry', 'film', 'around', 'timeline', 'almost', 'hysterically', 'director', 'never', 'get', 'lost', 'always', 'feel', 'control', 'senses', 'emotions', 'tribute', 'Carrey', 'Winslet', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'same', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'pulled', 'off', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'transformation', 'would', 'have', 'deemed', 'impossible', 'decade', 'ago', 'becoming', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'qualities', 'resemble', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fabulous', 'everyman', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'knowing', 'interesting', 'kind', 'tremendous', 'praise', 'role', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'actresses', 'have', 'Here', 'type', 'fascinating', 'woman', 'who', 'attention', 'intimacy', 'Hers', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'will', 'go', 'overlooked', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Joel', 'love', 'Clementine', 'very', 'deep', 'message', 'Sunshine', 'arguably', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Adaptation', 'deepest', 'film', 'date', 'Love', 'romance', 'memories', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'examined', 'thought-provokingly', 'tenderly', 'are', 'wonderful', 'motion', 'picture', 'movie', 'very', 'profound', 'message', 'viewers', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'are', 'many', 'small', 'intricacies', 'film', 'surely', 'picked', 'up', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'entire', 'construction', 'movie', 'completely', 'enthralling', 'intelligent', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'eloquently', 'voiced', 'Gondry', 'firmly', 'constructed', 'rooted', 'eerie', 'nightmarish', 'fantasy', 'land', 'where', 'anything', 'possible', 'beautiful', 'bizarre', 'exceptional', 'funny', 'lovely', 'touching', 'witty', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

The effect is almost therapeutic to the viewer, it's that dead-on.When Carrey's character is reliving the good times that came before the end of his relationship with Clementine, the scenes have a surreal, ""viewing from a distance"" glow that very closely mimic those thoughts that crop up in your head when you remember lost love.

However, this review is for the DVD presentation as well.First, the movie.  The script, the performances, the direction, all brilliant and enjoyable.  I've been a big fan of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman since Being John Malkovich, and despite his inability to give his stories appropriate and satisfying endings, I think the end of Eternal Sunshine was a great improvement.  A creative genius.The story said a lot to me, a lot I could relate to, about relationships and philosophy, thoughts that a lot of people believed only they would have, myself included.  It touches upon the old adage that without history, you're dooming yourself to repeat it.  But some histories are well worth repeating as demonstrated beautifully by the film.My only problem is with the DVD presentation.  While it looks and sounds great, it doesn't have a lot of bonus features to offer.  There's the interesting commentary, a music video, a fake commercial for the fictional Lacuna services, a couple of shorts and a handful of deleted scenes.  While these are fine features for the price, it just isn't very much.  Directory Michel Gondry mentions coming very close to going overbudget and having shot a week's worth of film in a day.  Where is all this footage?  I'd like to know more about how this movie was made and I want to see more of what went on the cutting room floor.  The deleted scenes also need some commentary or at least a brief text description, so you know what context the scene was supposed to be in.The overall presentation of the DVD just seems so very dull as well.  Completely static and silent menu screens, it seems like someone could've put together the DVD menus on their home PC.  It's a very dated-looking presentation.  I want to hear music from the movie, especially the main theme, during the menus, I want menus that look more than a website from 1994.  It's a simple lack of effort.  Also worth noting, as with most, if not all Universal DVD releases, is the annoying presence of a bunch of trailers for other Universal movies appearing as soon as you put the disc into your player.  You could bypass them, but you shouldn't have to skip something each and every time you want to watch.For the money, this DVD is a good buy on the merits of the film alone.

620397,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B00005JMJG,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[8, 22]","The premise is intriguing. Girl gets tired of a declining relationship and has all memory of boyfriend erased. Boyfriend finds out and decides he can't live with that: gets himself erased as well. In the middle of the procedure, which he experiences as a kind of dream, he becomes lucid, realizes what's going on and decides he doesn't want this to happen. But it's too late; despite all his efforts his memory is erased. Fate in the shape of an accidental post-erasure meeting and the other actions of other characters involved twists the plot around and brings them together again.The cast: a director's dream. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslett, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo. How can you go wrong? Well, you can, and something did. I've been trying to work out what, because there are so many factors that nuked this movie.First of all what went right: Carrey and the rest of the cast were amazing, even if most of them never got a chance to actually evince what you might call 'depth of character'.  Carrey and Winslett do get that chance in the first part, where 'Joel' and 'Clementine' meet again, and those few minutes alone make the movie worth watching; after that it's mostly downhill: the story falls apart in the same way that 'Being John Malkovich' ultimately does, except that here at least the story has somewhere to go, though the writer, director and editor seem to have no idea about how to get there, but ultimately fumble themselves through to an ending.There were some elements with incredible potential: for example the whole dream-like erasure process, with the built-in flashes of lucidity, followed by lapses back into non-awareness. Anybody who's had lucid dreams will recognize the process. Then there's what amounts to a mental chase and battle of wits, as Joel tries to hide his memories in places where the hi-tech backed pursuit cannot find it. The whole thing throws up a whole plethora of troublesome questions related to cognitive research and philosophy, and especially the nature of 'identity'. The suffocating predicament Joel got himself into (by surrendering control of his mind to someone else) and can't get himself our of. The twists and turns of contingency as, despite all this, it all appears to turn out all right.The flaw at the heart of this movie is that someone forgot what story to tell, and instead tried to tell too many, and in the process the movie lost its soul. The editing completed the job that the directing started. It was so VISIBLE as to become detrimental to the actors: in its contrived cleverness it erased much of the depth they could have brought to the characters. Sometimes I had the feeling that there actually WAS something more to this moment or that; but then it usually got zapped, as if the editor was chasing that precious something down like Stan was doing to Joel's memories.The cinematography was trying to be so clever that one could almost touch it. In conjunction with the awful editing, almost every 'cut-to' became a painful jarring of this viewer's attempt to relate to the story and the characters, and made the thing into a cinematographic, rather than an emotional experience.Without this, maybe the other problems of the movie would have been non-existent. I don't know, because the movie is as it is, and we can play 'what if' games forever and speculate into a vacuum. But I'd like to think that maybe in the hands of someone less keen to 'make a movie' and more interested in people and telling a story, we might actually have some emotional understanding of why Joel and Clementine needed to be together, and why it was right that in the end they were. Don't misunderstand me: give me ANY reason for an upbeat ending and I'll embrace it joyfully. So why, in this instance, did I feel that the ending was tacked-on, contrived, artificial? The back-together-despite-all-the-odds simply rings false, if only because the only reason why they are is contingency, sheer dumb luck, twists of fate. They get a second chance and maybe they'll work it out this time. But did they do anything to earn it? In particular, did Clementine, who evinces no sign of actually thinking that there was something wrong with her method to opt out of a situation with the minimum of pain? Do these people actually love each other, and if they do, is that love enough or shown as even indicatively sufficient to bridge the gap they've created in their past and through their actions of surrendering their power of their minds to someone else?Finally, there is something offensive about the general attitude by director and editor towards the actors: in this case a dream-cast, whose potential was mostly edited out of existence. There is a school of film-makers who see actors as a kind of cinematographic element, like a piece of landscape or a prop. As long as they perform the correct motions and say the right things at some time or during some take, there's probably a way to edit it together so that it looks right. That's OK if the actors actually need such treatment. There is another school who believes that actors are to be considered not just essential, but next to the director the dominant visible participants in any decent story-telling process. To demean them into becoming just pieces in a mosaic of self-important film-making is degrading. That Carrey, Winslett and the rest of the cast still manage to shine is a testimony to their professionalism and consummate skill.

Oh wait...all of these films were screenwritten by Charlie Kaufman. I guess that explains it. Honestly , with all of the corny references aside...this movie offers a creative and innovative script , excellent direction , nice soundtrack , and great acting. And one of the most noticable and impressive things , about this film , is the performance , given by it's leading man , Jim Carrey ( playing against typecast ). It took meatleast 10 minutes to stop waiting for Jim Carrey to break out into "" Mask , Ace Ventura , Dumb and Dumber"" mode. Therefore, after realizing that this guy, obviously, wasn't going to go there..I relaxed and allowed myself to stop watching for Jim Carrey. Then , this innovative story..started breathing a life and believability of it's own. There are also fine performances by the supporting cast , especially Kate Winslet , who contrasts Jim Carrey's charactor , perfectly.The dvd doesn't provide many extras...but most dvd's don't until the initial "" fuss"" is over. So , if you're into dvd's with loads of extras , you'll be waiting for about two years , on this one.

620399,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JMJG,Tom Benton,"[5, 6]","After eighty years of cinema, the film industry is running out of original ideas.  There seem to be more and more remakes of old films, or recycled ideas, everyday.  I find this loss of originality to be quite depressing.  That's why I'm overjoyed to find that there is still some creativity in Hollywood today.  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a perfect example.Jim Carrey stars as Joel, a man who one day discovers that his lover, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her memory after their relationship has gone over the edge.  In retaliation Joel decides to have his memory erased as well, but it's only through doing so that he realizes all the good times they had together.Charlie Kaufman is one of Hollywood's most important writers, and certainly one of its best living screenwriters.  Before bringing us ""Eternal Sunshine"", he's written such greats as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"".  Thanks to Mr. Kaufman, I feel happy knowing that there is still such a thing as an intelligent script nowadays.One of the things that leads this movie is the cast.  If ever I had any doubts about Jim Carrey's acting talents, they were cleared up after this movie.  Mr. Carrey is excellent, and thanks to his performance I really sympathized with his character.  Kate Winslet is also terrific.  These two are both equally deserving of an Academy Award nomination.  Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Thomas Jay Ryan play in supporting roles.At the director's helm is Michel Gondry, and he knows how to steer this ship.  Jon Brion's emotional score really adds to the film.I am proud to declare ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as my pick for the best film of 2004.  This is one of the greatest films of recent years, and in my opinion one of the best films made.

This is possibly the best picture of the year, and has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exercise in existential drudgery. Coming from the bizarre thought processes of Charlie Kaufman, who minted the new mind-game cinema with his ""Being John Malkovich"" script, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is as giddy as it is intellectual. And it finally delivers the role Carrey has wanted to play for the last five years. Jim Carrey heads the cast of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, directed by Michel Gondry from Academy Award nominee Charlie Kaufman's (Adaptation) original screenplay. The two-time Golden Globe Award winner is joined in the movie by threetime Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Tom Wilkinson (Academy Award nominee for In the Bedroom), Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count on Me), and Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings). Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover his love for Clementine. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get Clementine out of his head.

What if someone offered you a simple solution that would only take one evening and cost a nominal fee? Would you take it?When we first meet Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey), he's waking up in his home, wearing pajamas he doesn't recognize. It's Valentine's Day and, rather than go to work, he makes a spur of the moment decision to visit Montauk. As is typically the case with beach communities in the off-season, Montauk is deserted. Then, unexpectedly, Joel sees a woman on the beach. He wonders why he ""falls in love with every woman"" he sees who shows him ""the slightest bit of attention"". He encounters the same woman when he orders breakfast at a local restaurant and then, one final time, on the train home. The woman (played by Kate Winslet) introduces herself without any prompting. Her name is Clementine and she and Joel are getting off at the same stop. Their initial interaction makes Joel rather uncomfortable, he being the quiet, reserved type while Clementine is very outgoing and gives little thought to other peoples' opinions of her. Additionally, she has great disdain for generic adjectives like ""nice"", a word Joel uses more than once during their time on the train. When Joel spots Clementine walking home he offers to give her a ride and she accepts. When they arrive at her apartment, Clementine invites Joel up to her place for a drink and, despite the differences between them, or maybe as a result of them, Joel is intrigued. They take a late night trip to see the frozen Charles River and their romance progresses. The following morning, they arrive at Clementine's once again, Joel driving while Clementine slept, and she asks if they can go to his place and sleep there. She enters her apartment to retrieve some personal items and Joel, waiting in the car, is approached by a stranger who inquires as to why Joel is there. The conversation is awkward and short. Then, Clementine returns and they depart. Next, the credits begin rolling and we are shown an obviously distraught Joel. That is when the story really begins.I go back and forth on the subject of non-linear storytelling. There are some stories that seek to make themselves seem interesting by showing the elements out of order and others that are genuinely enhanced by jumping from one point in time to another. I believe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind falls in the second category. The creative manner by which they depict those elements of the story that take place within the mind of the main character, the subplots involving the unprincipled technicians performing the procedure add a whole new dimension to an already engrossing tale. Carrey and Winslet are both at the top of their games and, in my opinion, Carrey was never better before and hasn't been since. This is an amazing movie.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing of the sort.Jim Carrey provides his most vulnerable performance, serious performance to date.  Kate Winslet is the Gen Xer who is both desireable and yet difficult at the same time.  Both actors portray characters who are against their usual types.Winslet's character (Clementine)decides to erase her memories of the Carrey chracter (Joel).  Upon learning this, Joel opts for the same procedure.  However, while his memory is being erased, he chages his mind as he relishes the good memories he had with her.  We see flashbacks that morph between one another, in settings that become surreal and dream-like.

620404,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMJG,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","There are so many ways to describe the charms of 'Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind' -- original, strange, bizarre, confusing, funny, New York City, frozen winter, tricks done by memories, Kate Winslet's hair, etc.  To me, it's simply a love story.Of course, as this is Charlie Kaufman-scripted love story, it's no ordinary love story, and in fact you are introduced to a medical service 'Lacuna Inc' that offers you a great chance to erase parts of your memories, to start your new life.  But still 'Eternal' remains a love story.  And the story goes like this.[THE STORY] Joel (very strained Jim Carrey) decides to erase his memoires of Clementine (excellent Kate Winslet), after, it seems, he had a bitter argument with her.  He goes, like any embittered lover does, 'Fine, I'm going to forget everything about her.'But we soon realize one true thing.  Once the erasing process starts, which goes from the newest memories to the older ones, Joel realizes that his decision was too hasty, for after all, not everything was bad as he thinks.  The older the memories become, the more precious they are, and Joel realises it, maybe too late.There are many visual gimmicks (which are supported largely by Michel Gondry's well-crafted low-tech skills), and some sequences in which Jim Carrey can unleash his wild comic genius, 'Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind' is for the most part about the relations between a man and a woman.  You may call it romantic comedy, but it is also the first romantic comedy of which romance grows in someone's brain, or the spotless mind.Altough top-notch cast including Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson are assembled (or probably they came to the filmmaking FOCUS studio very spontaneously), it is Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who really shine in this unusual film.  It is great to see Kate Winslet coming back from the devastating 'Holy Smoke' by which her career was almost killed (I'm talking about that scene).It is confusing at times, but is also worth the trouble.  If you cannot follow some part, just forget it and keep on watching the love story between Joel and Clementine.  That's very intelligent and moving at the same time.",5,"Intelligent and Moving Romantic Story, and Wonderful Winslet",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2201,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'describe', 'charms', ""'Eternal"", 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'original', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'confusing', 'funny', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'frozen', 'winter', 'tricks', 'done', 'memories', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'hair', 'etc', 'simply', 'love', 'story.Of', 'course', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman-scripted', 'love', 'story', 'ordinary', 'love', 'story', 'fact', 'are', 'introduced', 'medical', 'service', 'Inc', 'great', 'chance', 'erase', 'parts', 'memories', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'still', ""'Eternal"", 'love', 'story', 'story', '[', 'THE', 'STORY', ']', 'Joel', 'very', 'strained', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'erase', 'memoires', 'Clementine', 'excellent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'had', 'bitter', 'argument', 'embittered', 'lover', ""'Fine"", ""'m"", 'going', 'forget', 'everything', 'soon', 'realize', 'one', 'true', 'thing', 'erasing', 'process', 'starts', 'newest', 'memories', 'older', 'ones', 'Joel', 'decision', 'was', 'too', 'hasty', 'not', 'everything', 'was', 'bad', 'older', 'memories', 'become', 'more', 'precious', 'are', 'Joel', 'maybe', 'too', 'late.There', 'are', 'many', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'supported', 'largely', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'well-crafted', 'low-tech', 'skills', 'sequences', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'unleash', 'wild', 'comic', 'genius', ""'Eternal"", 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'most', 'part', 'relations', 'man', 'woman', 'may', 'call', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'also', 'first', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'grows', 'someone', 'brain', 'spotless', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'including', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'are', 'assembled', 'probably', 'came', 'filmmaking', 'FOCUS', 'studio', 'very', 'spontaneously', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'really', 'shine', 'unusual', 'film', 'great', 'see', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'coming', 'back', 'devastating', ""'Holy"", 'Smoke', 'career', 'was', 'almost', 'killed', ""'m"", 'talking', 'scene', '.It', 'confusing', 'times', 'also', 'worth', 'trouble', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'part', 'just', 'forget', 'keep', 'watching', 'love', 'story', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'very', 'intelligent', 'moving', 'same', 'time']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620405,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JMJG,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 7]","The title of this film is taken from a poem written by Alexander Pope entitled ""Eloisa to Abelard"".  Pope based his poem upon the lives of two real people who were involved in an illicit affair.  The poem is written from Eloisa's point of view and illustrates the conflict the woman has between her deep love for Abelard and her devotion to God.  The movie takes it's name from the lines, ""How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!/The world forgetting, by the world forgot./ Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!/Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" in which Eloisa wonders what it would be like if she had never fallen in love with Abelard and had the affair erased from her life.That idea, of being able to erase one's memories, is the plot structure in which ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND revolves.  The film stars Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, a shy man who usually keeps to himself but who thought he had found the love of his life in a woman named Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet).  Clementine is everything that Joel is not and the two individuals discover that not only do they complement each other, but that they complete each other as well.  However, after a particular messy argument, Joel receives a notice that Clementine has had all memory of him erased from her mind.  Joel tries to force the relationship afresh and fails. He realizes that he cannot live knowing that the love of his life has no memory of him and decides to have the procedure done himself.  While undergoing the memory-erasure, Joel begins to remember all the good times he had and everything about Clementine that made him fall in love with her in the first place.  He then tries to fight the erasing by hiding out with Clementine in other memories in his mind.  Think of a bizarre and quirky IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.That might sound very confusing and that's not even taking into consideration that's not how the plot of the movie takes place because we see the story in reverse (kind of like MEMENTO) from the time Joel and Clementine had their last argument until they first met.  Of course, the movie actually begins more towards the end rather than the beginning and ends at a new beginning.  The film also has a small subplot about the Dr. in charge of the procedure (Tom Wilkinson) and one of his employees (Kristen Dunst).  Despite the labyrinth structure, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of the best romantic movies of the past decade.  It's a very honest film, full of emotion and heart.  It doesn't sugarcoat the hardships and sometimes seemingly dullness that a relationship can bring, but illustrates that the good times far outweigh all of that and that even if they didn't, those difficulties are important because they make us who we are and help us to become better people.Besides the story and wonderful script (written by Charlie Kaufman), ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is notable for a couple of other reasons. First, the movie is one of Jim Carrey's best performances ever.  Carrey has given some Oscar-worthy performances before (THE TRUMAN SHOW, MAN ON THE MOON) but his performance as Joel is his best to date.  If you had never seen Jim Carrey perform before, you would never know that he became famous because of his comedy--you would think he was a Shakespearean-trained actor.  He should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar here, too, but wasn't.Secondly, the film is a great example of how a movie with a lot of special effects can be made without using a lot of CGI.  All of the bizarre scenes were created using good old fashioned tricks through manipulation of the camera, set, props, editing, or lighting.ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those films that people are either going to love or are going to hate.  I enjoyed the film immensely.  It stayed in my head for weeks.  Both the story and filmmaking are inspiring.  But that's just me. Maybe you'll hate it. If that's the case, you might want to visit Lacuna Inc.The DVD includes an informative making-of featurette (explains how some of the best stuff in the movie wasn't really scripted), some deleted scenes, a conversation with Carrey and director Michael Gondry, a Lacuna infomercial, a music video, and a commentary.",5,Fragile Life and Conquering Love.,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,4256,"['title', 'film', 'taken', 'poem', 'written', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'entitled', 'Eloisa', 'Abelard', 'Pope', 'based', 'poem', 'lives', 'two', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'illicit', 'affair', 'poem', 'written', 'Eloisa', 'point', 'view', 'conflict', 'woman', 'deep', 'love', 'Abelard', 'devotion', 'God', 'movie', 'name', 'lines', 'How', 'happy', 'blameless', 'Vestal', 'lot', '/The', 'world', 'forgetting', 'world', 'Eternal', 'sunshine', 'spotless', 'mind', '/Each', 'pray', 'r', 'accepted', 'wish', 'resign', ""'d"", 'Eloisa', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'fallen', 'love', 'Abelard', 'had', 'affair', 'erased', 'life.That', 'idea', 'being', 'able', 'erase', 'one', 'memories', 'plot', 'structure', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'film', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'Barish', 'shy', 'man', 'who', 'usually', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'woman', 'named', 'Clementine', 'Kruczynski', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Clementine', 'everything', 'Joel', 'not', 'two', 'individuals', 'discover', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'complement', 'other', 'complete', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'particular', 'messy', 'argument', 'Joel', 'notice', 'Clementine', 'had', 'memory', 'erased', 'mind', 'Joel', 'force', 'relationship', 'afresh', 'fails', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'knowing', 'love', 'life', 'memory', 'decides', 'have', 'procedure', 'done', 'undergoing', 'memory-erasure', 'Joel', 'remember', 'good', 'times', 'had', 'everything', 'about', 'Clementine', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'fight', 'erasing', 'hiding', 'out', 'Clementine', 'other', 'memories', 'mind', 'Think', 'bizarre', 'quirky', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE.That', 'might', 'sound', 'very', 'confusing', 'not', 'even', 'taking', 'consideration', 'not', 'how', 'plot', 'movie', 'place', 'see', 'story', 'reverse', 'kind', 'MEMENTO', 'time', 'Joel', 'Clementine', 'had', 'last', 'argument', 'first', 'met', 'course', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'end', 'rather', 'beginning', 'new', 'beginning', 'film', 'also', 'small', 'subplot', 'Dr.', 'charge', 'procedure', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'one', 'employees', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'labyrinth', 'structure', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'movies', 'past', 'decade', 'very', 'honest', 'film', 'full', 'emotion', 'heart', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'hardships', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'dullness', 'relationship', 'can', 'bring', 'good', 'times', 'far', 'outweigh', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'difficulties', 'are', 'important', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'help', 'become', 'better', 'story', 'wonderful', 'script', 'written', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'notable', 'couple', 'other', 'reasons', 'First', 'movie', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Carrey', 'given', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'TRUMAN', 'SHOW', 'MAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'MOON', 'performance', 'Joel', 'best', 'date', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'perform', 'before', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'became', 'famous', 'comedy', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'Shakespearean-trained', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'here', 'too', ""wasn't.Secondly"", 'film', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'movie', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'using', 'lot', 'CGI', 'bizarre', 'scenes', 'were', 'created', 'using', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'tricks', 'manipulation', 'camera', 'set', 'props', 'editing', 'lighting.ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'one', 'films', 'people', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'love', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'stayed', 'head', 'weeks', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'are', 'inspiring', 'just', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'case', 'might', 'want', 'visit', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.The', 'DVD', 'informative', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'how', 'best', 'stuff', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'scripted', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'conversation', 'Carrey', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gondry', 'Lacuna', 'infomercial', 'music', 'video', 'commentary']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

620411,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00005JMJG,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 4]","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind begins with the theory that memory is a tangible thing. The brain is the equivalent of a large filing cabinet, and the removal of painful memories is as simple as isolating the files associated with the person or event and taking them out. Described as a form of brain damage, the procedure is quick and efficient, as troubled patients are promised a future free of those troubling episodes that haunt us all.But that only establishes the world of the film. The plot involves the question of what happens when two former lovers both choose to erase each other from their memories and then meet again without any knowledge of their previous relationship. The film goes on to explore questions about true love and how much a person's identity depends on his/her memory.The two lovers in the film as played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and neither have been better. Carrey is reserved and introverted, a reminder of other Charlie Kaufman-created leads in Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. He is witty, educated, but painfully inept in social settings. As opposites attract, his love interest is all the things he is not. She is spontaneous and lively, but lacks much mystery and depth.The film begins in the middle, before they meet again ""for the first time"". We see their previous relationship in flashbacks, most of the film taking place in Carrey's mind as he goes through his memory erasing procedure. While in the middle of the process, conflict arises in his mind. A heartbreaking realization ensues, as he must give up the tender moments of their affair (along with the painful ones). The horror of the procedure is exposed; it is the equivalent of the death of a loved one.While watching them build their relationship a second time, many viewers will be torn. Some will say it is the power of true love, thrusting them back together as if they are destined for each other. Others will believe they are making the same mistake again and will not want them to suffer through another courtship that ended as badly as the first.At the heart of the film is a relationship between two people presented with all the cruel truths of reality. While we do see the wonderful moments shared by two people in love, we also see how painful love can be when those involve really know what how to hurt their partner.

620412,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JMJG,Westley,"[5, 6]","Charlie Kaufman has become the go-to-man for scripts that bend time, place, and traditional conventions: he's scored another winner with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  Teaming with Director Michel Gondry for the second time (they made the semi-flop ""Human Nature"" in 2001), they have made a great film, perhaps the best from a Kaufman script.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the unlikely stars, both cast against type.  Carrey excels as a withdrawn and depressed man who meets a free-spirited neurotic, played by Winslet, who's never been better.  The two have a fling and seem to bring out the best in each other, although it quickly devolves.  Winslet decides to have her memories of Carrey erased by Lacuna Inc., which jump starts the time-bending plot.  Kaufman's scripts are always pleasantly off-beat and funny, as is ""Eternal Sunshine.""  However, what Kaufman has added this time around are some keen perceptions about relationships.  Carrey and Winslet manage, against all odds, to portray a believable couple and the results are genuine moments of understanding and heartbreak.Every remaining element of the film is superior.  Gondry's direction is masterful, aided significantly by the cinematography of Ellen Kuras (Blow, Swoon).  The supporting cast are also excellent: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood (as the amusing memory-busters), and Tom Wilkinson.  Overall, this film is the best of 2004 so far and stands poised to become a modern classic.DVD Extras: The DVD is packed, including interviews, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a director's commentary, and deleted scenes.",5,"""I wish you'd stayed""",1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,1608,"['Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'become', 'go-to-man', 'scripts', 'bend', 'time', 'place', 'traditional', 'conventions', 'scored', 'winner', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Teaming', 'Director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'second', 'time', 'made', 'semi-flop', 'Human', 'Nature', '2001', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Kaufman', 'script.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'unlikely', 'stars', 'cast', 'type', 'Carrey', 'withdrawn', 'depressed', 'man', 'who', 'free-spirited', 'neurotic', 'played', 'Winslet', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'two', 'have', 'fling', 'seem', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'other', 'quickly', 'Winslet', 'have', 'memories', 'Carrey', 'erased', 'Lacuna', 'Inc.', 'jump', 'time-bending', 'plot', 'Kaufman', 'scripts', 'are', 'always', 'pleasantly', 'off-beat', 'funny', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'However', 'what', 'Kaufman', 'added', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'keen', 'perceptions', 'relationships', 'Carrey', 'Winslet', 'manage', 'odds', 'portray', 'believable', 'couple', 'results', 'are', 'genuine', 'moments', 'understanding', 'heartbreak.Every', 'remaining', 'element', 'film', 'superior', 'Gondry', 'direction', 'masterful', 'aided', 'significantly', 'cinematography', 'Ellen', 'Kuras', 'Blow', 'Swoon', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'amusing', 'memory-busters', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Overall', 'film', 'best', '2004', 'far', 'poised', 'become', 'modern', 'classic.DVD', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'packed', 'including', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'director', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620413,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JMJG,Wheelchair Assassin,"[11, 21]","At first glance, it would be easy to dismiss Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as just another pretentious indie movie.  And there's a very good reason for that: it is a pretentious indie movie.  A newly broken-up couple deciding to have their memories of one another erased?  Entire scenes filmed inside Jim Carrey's memory?  A stream-of-consciousness narrative with a constantly-jumping timeline?  God, that sounds even worse than the snoozeathon that was Lost in Translation.  However, there's more to the story here.  Unlike many movies of its ilk, Eternal Sunshine doesn't attempt to be all cleverness and originality at the expense of everything else.  It may be a pretentious indie movie, but it's a pretentious indie movie with heart.While Eternal Sunshine does take a little while to get going, and it can take even more time to figure out what's going on, those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most innovative and intelligent viewing experiences of recent years.  It's definitely not your typical popcorn movie, but Eternal Sunshine mixes its bizarre plot with much more emotional resonance than you might expect from what initially appears to be a rather gimmicky film.  In fact, the high concept and the underlying lost-love story ultimately serve to enhance one another.  The movie's unconventional idea and narrative structure actually serve to make the central message about holding onto one's memories more, not less, affecting.  It's a pretty neat trick, really.The movie's helped along by some of the best ensemble casting you'll ever see, led by a surprisingly solid performance from Jim Carrey.  There are a lot of prominent characters in this movie, but they're all nicely fleshed out with some economical dialogue and strong if understated acting.  Those accustomed to Carrey's furious mugging in his prior outings will be surprised by what he shows here, as his quiet desperation and occasional befuddlement add to the proceedings without distracting from them.  There are plenty of memorable performances elsewhere, from Kate Winslet's quirkiness and passion to Elijah Wood's underhanded smarminess to Kirsten Dunst's naive innocence.  Not to mention, any movie that features Dunst dancing on a bed in her underwear gets some extra points from me.By this point, two bifurcated opinions regarding independent films have emerged.  People tend to regard them (in general) as either inspired pieces of art free from the demands of commercialism or boring exercises in self-indulgence.  Of course, if you're reading this review you probably gravitate toward the former view, but even if you don't you may well find something to like here.  It can take some work to get past the admittedly weird goings-on here, but some persistent watching reveals a challenging, well-constructed movie with lots to enjoy for the intelligent viewer.  Plus, unlike many indie comedies, it's actually funny.",3,"Another one of ""those"" movies?

It is smart, compelling, interesting, and deeply emotive.  It is brilliantly put together and has a richness of texture that can only be appreciated on multiple viewings.It is a love story told in an unfamiliar way - the possibility of memory erasure.  The pain of a just-ended relationship with Kate Winslet leads Jim Carrey to choose a unique method to ameliorate his despair - to take advantage of a medical technique that promises to erase from his brain all memories of his former lover.  It sounds strange because it is.The story continues on via Carrey's character reliving the memories of this woman while they are being erased in his sleep.  He is in a dream-state as he confuses memories, mixes things up, and discovers while inside his dream a powerful human lesson about life and love.  The acting is absolutely superb, as it boasts an amazing cast of Carrey, Winslet (a brilliant performance that surprised me), Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson.  All of them are extraordinary.If you like intelligent, thought-provoking films that also happen to pull at your emotional heart-strings, you will love this film.  It is a heavy script with multiple meanings, and one can examine it on several different levels.  The power, inconsistency, and unreliability of memory, the psychological and philosophical reality of memory and the possibility of its erasure or creation, the brilliant, discontinuous script, the dynamic direction, the able and highly competent acting.  How the resilience of human personality is greater than discrete collections of memory instances.  And how no matter how or what you may try, it is neither possible nor wise to completely erase any significant and remembered instance of human experience, especially in love.The film makes you think and makes you cry at the same time.

I did finish the film and decided that if you are patient, sit still for the whole film and ignore the plot failures there is some reward.  However, plot failures do exist and the biggest one is the absence of the motivation needed for Joel(Jim Carrey) to fight the memory erasing process he has volunteered for. You see, Joel has received a note telling him that his girlfriend, Clementine(Kate Winslet) has had his part of her memory erased.  So, Joel decides to erase Clementine from his memory.  Make sense?  Sort of. Most of the film are clips of Joel clinging to rapidly disappearing memories.  However, none of the memories justified themselves as something I would want to keep, just some stoner's fractured view of life and love.To make this film work the way so many reviewers have painted it, Kaufman(writer) and Gondry(director/writer) should have given us a least a part of the relationship to cling to.  The viewer must have some sympathy for the loss else the loss is nothing and this is where the filmakers leave us.I'm all for post-modernism but I'm also a film addict and historian.  I can tell you this is not a romantic comedy at all but, rather, a self-indulgent film that gets lost before it gets started. The filmakers are much more concerned with method than substance.  However, it takes these efforts, short of definition as this one is, to help define the movement by telling us this is not the direction we need to go.  Rent if first before you buy.

I highly reccommend this to those who love to think, I think you'll love it.

620420,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JMJG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","For many years, I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's wacky brand of comedy.  I consider ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" to be the funniest movies of all-time, and can watch them over and over without fail.  However, I had always been skeptical about his ability to pull off a really dramatic role.  Sure, he was decent in ""The Majestic"" and ""The Truman Show"", but in my mind he would always be typecast as that goofy guy with the impossibly stretchy face and crazy voice accents.  That all changed after viewing ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".Though trying to give a brief plot description of this film is like trying to determine what ""Alice in Wonderland"" was really all about, the basic premise centers on the two characters of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  When their once-loving relationship begins to fail miserably, both opt to partake in a new scientific procedure in which all memories of that person are erased from your brain.  Clementine completes the operation with no difficult, but Joel has a much harder time letting go, and his journey through his own mind (as he re-lives his relationship with Clem) comprises much of the film.To me, one of the greatest compliments you can give a film (ala Back To The Future) is to not quite know what genre to place it in.  Walk into your local video store (or peruse any online source) and you could find this movie in ""Comedy"" (for Carrey's name and subtle touches), ""Romance"" (for the lead relationship), ""Drama"" (for the aching love story), or even ""Action"" (for the incredible visual sequences that director Michel Gondry composes).  The only two films I can remember watching that took my breath any at the end are ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", and this one tops those by a considerable margin.The acting is also fantastic.  Remarkably, Carrey makes a strong case that this may be the best role he's ever played (comedy included), while Winslet is every bit his equal in terms of character depth.  I could have started the movie right back at the beginning after finishing it and still enjoyed their performances (as well as excellent auxiliary cast that shines in their respective roles).Thus, though I wasn't expecting all that much when pressing the ""Play"" button on this one, it instantly jumped into the top ten films I have ever laid eyes on.  PLEASE go out and find this movie somewhere if you consider yourself a movie fan whatsoever.  It will absolutely astound you.",5,Will Forever Change The Way You View Cinema (And Jim Carrey),1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2483,"['many', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'wacky', 'brand', 'comedy', 'consider', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'be', 'funniest', 'movies', 'all-time', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'fail', 'However', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'skeptical', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Sure', 'was', 'decent', 'Majestic', 'Truman', 'Show', 'mind', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'typecast', 'guy', 'impossibly', 'stretchy', 'face', 'crazy', 'voice', 'accents', 'changed', 'viewing', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'trying', 'give', 'brief', 'plot', 'description', 'film', 'trying', 'determine', 'what', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'was', 'really', 'basic', 'premise', 'centers', 'two', 'characters', 'Joel', 'Carrey', 'Clementine', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'When', 'once-loving', 'relationship', 'fail', 'miserably', 'opt', 'partake', 'new', 'scientific', 'procedure', 'memories', 'person', 'are', 'erased', 'brain', 'Clementine', 'operation', 'difficult', 'Joel', 'much', 'harder', 'time', 'letting', 'go', 'journey', 'own', 'mind', 'relationship', 'Clem', 'much', 'film.To', 'one', 'greatest', 'compliments', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'ala', 'Back', 'Future', 'not', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'genre', 'place', 'Walk', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'peruse', 'online', 'source', 'could', 'find', 'movie', 'Comedy', 'Carrey', 'name', 'subtle', 'touches', 'Romance', 'lead', 'relationship', 'Drama', 'aching', 'love', 'story', 'even', 'Action', 'incredible', 'visual', 'sequences', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'composes', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'took', 'breath', 'end', 'are', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'tops', 'considerable', 'margin.The', 'acting', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Remarkably', 'Carrey', 'strong', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'played', 'comedy', 'included', 'Winslet', 'bit', 'equal', 'terms', 'character', 'depth', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'movie', 'right', 'back', 'beginning', 'finishing', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'shines', 'respective', 'roles', '.Thus', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'that', 'much', 'when', 'pressing', 'Play', 'button', 'one', 'instantly', 'jumped', 'top', 'ten', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'laid', 'eyes', 'PLEASE', 'go', 'out', 'find', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'consider', 'movie', 'fan', 'whatsoever', 'will', 'absolutely', 'astound']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
620421,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,B00005JMJG,Zack H.,"[0, 4]","What an excellent, excellent movie. Jim Carrey (Joel) dominates the screen in probably his best serious role yet. Basically, he meets a girl, and they fall in love. Well, trouble brews between them, and the girl, Clementine, decides to erase all memory of Joel. Finding out about this, Joel decides to go through with the procedure himself. Halfway through Joel fights desperately to keep his memories of Clementine alive because he doesn't want to forget her. The best part of the movie is inside Joels mind as he tries to hold on to the memories he has left. Cinematography plays a HUGE role in effectively showing Joels mind, and in the beginning it seems kind of creepy as everything is kind of shadowy and dark. It is a great way to symbolize our thinking onto the big screen. During the end, the plot goes a little awry, but eventually fits into the end story. I believe the weakest moments of this film are when the movie goes to the scenes that focus on the people performing the memory erasure. Elijah Wood is also in the movie, which kind of ruined it for me because i still see him as Frodo from the Lord of the Rings. I feel that movies have more of a realistic quality when the actors are people I don't know. Sure Jim Carrey is someone I know, but he plays the part so well that he doesn't ruin the movie. So because of these small flaws i listed, Eternal Sunshine gets a 4 out of 5. It is definately a great movie to watch, and is quite moving at some points. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so when it comes out to rent, or to buy. A fantastic movie all around that really makes you think at parts.",4,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1621,"['What', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Joel', 'screen', 'probably', 'best', 'serious', 'role', 'yet', 'Basically', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'Well', 'trouble', 'brews', 'girl', 'Clementine', 'erase', 'memory', 'Joel', 'Finding', 'out', 'Joel', 'go', 'procedure', 'Halfway', 'Joel', 'fights', 'desperately', 'keep', 'memories', 'Clementine', 'alive', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'inside', 'Joels', 'mind', 'hold', 'memories', 'left', 'Cinematography', 'HUGE', 'role', 'effectively', 'showing', 'Joels', 'mind', 'beginning', 'kind', 'creepy', 'everything', 'kind', 'shadowy', 'dark', 'great', 'way', 'symbolize', 'thinking', 'big', 'screen', 'end', 'plot', 'little', 'awry', 'eventually', 'end', 'story', 'believe', 'weakest', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'movie', 'scenes', 'focus', 'people', 'performing', 'memory', 'erasure', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'also', 'movie', 'kind', 'ruined', 'i', 'still', 'see', 'Frodo', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'feel', 'movies', 'have', 'more', 'realistic', 'quality', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sure', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'someone', 'know', 'part', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'So', 'small', 'flaws', 'i', 'listed', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', '4', '5', 'definately', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'quite', 'moving', 'points', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'out', 'rent', 'buy', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'really', 'think', 'parts']",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
