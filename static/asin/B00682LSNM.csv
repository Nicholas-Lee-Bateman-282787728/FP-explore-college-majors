1513153,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00682LSNM,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 4]","I've always been a fan of Sean Patrick Flanery.  Every since his days on THE INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES - where he played the late teenage version of the legendary archaeologist himself, Indiana Jones - I thought the kid was destined for some great film roles.  Unfortunately, it apparently wasn't to be, as he found himself mostly stalled in one B-picture after another.  Though he has managed to eek out a respectable film and television career (he had a solid run in USA Television's ""The Dead Zone""), he's found himself as a strong lead in forgettable pictures, and I can only hope INSIGHT will be the last of its kind.Honestly, INSIGHT is one of those films that's almost impossible to review without some measure of spoilers, and that's due largely to the nature of the story: once you know what's happening - or, at least, once you've seen the conclusion - then what came before changes dramatically.  This technique was used to its best, most effective intent with a film like THE SIXTH SENSE, where the main character goes the length of the film without knowing he's been shot and killed and has returned as a ghost.  Now, that ISN'T what happens in INSIGHT; I'm only trying to underscore that the film has that style of storytelling - what you say may or may not be what you get - and what you get here is all a bit muddled.For what it's worth, the premise of INSIGHT is worthy: emergency room nurse Kaitlyn (played by the lovely Natalie Zea, most recently seen on the FX show, ""Justified"") is accidentally shocked by a faulty defibrillator used just as a dying woman's confession is passing from her lips to Kaitlyn's ears ... and, when she wakes up, the nurse is now reliving the dead woman's memories.  Granted, it may not be the most creative set-up for a murder mystery, but, for the purposes of a thriller, it works well enough.  As a result of inheriting the victim's last moments, Kaitlyn feels compelled to solve the crime; while she can't quite see the murderer's face clearly, she recalls enough of the details to put her on track to catching a criminal before she believes he will strike again.Now, that's the set-up for the picture, but what actually happens turns out to be something much different.  According to the detective (Sean Patrick Flanery) assigned to the case, the victim died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, so there's no way Kaitlyn could've recovered the memories.  Convinced she's somewhat spiritually `tied' to the victim, the nurse persists, and she continues her quest to bring the killer to justice, even though the cost may be her own sanity.  I won't spoil it further - as I said above it's almost impossible to review without spoiling it - but I will state, for the record, that I wasn't convinced.  The crime that gets solved here isn't so much a crime as the audience is led to believe, and INSIGHT turns out to be more of a `what happened here' than it does any genuine `whodunit' as its packaging and publicity materials suggest.At best, the performances are mediocre, the look is mediocre, and the setting is mediocre, completely befitting a film that ends up pulling the rug out from under its audience (and its characters) in trying to craft some novel twist.As I said, I've had high hopes for Mr. Flanery.  After this one, I may just have to hang those hopes up.The film comes as a production of Braeburn Entertainment and Celco, with contributing efforts from A G. C. Pix LLC and Check Entertainment Production.  The disc is distributed through Phase 4 Films.  It's reasonably well produced with solid cinematography and sound, though neither should define any one person's career-best.  It's shot and feels mostly like a bloated tele-film, though - for some reason I can't tell you - it's rated R for violence and language, though the violence is exceedingly tame and the language is mostly under control.  There's a brief behind-the-scenes feature and a trailer, but don't be fooled: the trailer is much more entertaining than the feature itself!NOT RECOMMENDED.  An utter disappointment.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Phase 4 Films provided me with a DVD screener of INSIGHT for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1,Don't Be Fooled: INSIGHT Offers Little Insight Into Good Storytelling,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,4244,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'Every', 'days', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'CHRONICLES', 'where', 'played', 'late', 'teenage', 'version', 'legendary', 'archaeologist', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'thought', 'kid', 'was', 'destined', 'great', 'film', 'roles', 'Unfortunately', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'mostly', 'stalled', 'one', 'B-picture', 'managed', 'eek', 'out', 'respectable', 'film', 'television', 'career', 'had', 'solid', 'run', 'USA', 'Television', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'found', 'strong', 'lead', 'forgettable', 'pictures', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'INSIGHT', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'kind.Honestly', 'INSIGHT', 'one', 'films', 'almost', 'impossible', 'review', 'measure', 'spoilers', 'due', 'largely', 'nature', 'story', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'least', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'conclusion', 'then', 'what', 'came', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'technique', 'was', 'used', 'best', 'most', 'effective', 'intent', 'film', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'length', 'film', 'knowing', 'been', 'shot', 'killed', 'returned', 'ghost', 'Now', ""N'T"", 'what', 'INSIGHT', ""'m"", 'only', 'trying', 'underscore', 'film', 'style', 'storytelling', 'what', 'say', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'get', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'bit', 'what', 'worth', 'premise', 'INSIGHT', 'worthy', 'emergency', 'room', 'nurse', 'Kaitlyn', 'played', 'lovely', 'Natalie', 'Zea', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'FX', 'show', 'Justified', 'accidentally', 'shocked', 'faulty', 'defibrillator', 'used', 'just', 'dying', 'woman', 'confession', 'passing', 'lips', 'Kaitlyn', 'ears', 'when', 'up', 'nurse', 'now', 'reliving', 'dead', 'woman', 'memories', 'Granted', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'creative', 'set-up', 'murder', 'mystery', 'purposes', 'thriller', 'well', 'enough', 'result', 'inheriting', 'victim', 'last', 'moments', 'Kaitlyn', 'compelled', 'solve', 'crime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'murderer', 'face', 'clearly', 'enough', 'details', 'put', 'track', 'catching', 'criminal', 'will', 'strike', 'again.Now', 'set-up', 'picture', 'what', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'much', 'different', 'According', 'detective', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'assigned', 'case', 'victim', 'died', 'ambulance', 'way', 'hospital', 'way', 'Kaitlyn', 'could', ""'ve"", 'recovered', 'memories', 'Convinced', 'somewhat', 'spiritually', 'tied', 'victim', 'nurse', 'persists', 'quest', 'bring', 'killer', 'justice', 'even', 'cost', 'may', 'be', 'own', 'sanity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'further', 'said', 'almost', 'impossible', 'review', 'spoiling', 'will', 'state', 'record', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'crime', 'solved', 'here', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'crime', 'audience', 'led', 'believe', 'INSIGHT', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'genuine', 'whodunit', 'packaging', 'publicity', 'materials', 'suggest.At', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'mediocre', 'look', 'mediocre', 'setting', 'mediocre', 'completely', 'befitting', 'film', 'up', 'pulling', 'rug', 'audience', 'characters', 'trying', 'craft', 'novel', 'twist.As', 'said', ""'ve"", 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Mr.', 'Flanery', 'one', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'hang', 'hopes', 'up.The', 'film', 'production', 'Braeburn', 'Entertainment', 'Celco', 'contributing', 'efforts', 'A', 'G.', 'C.', 'Pix', 'LLC', 'Check', 'Entertainment', 'Production', 'disc', 'distributed', 'Phase', '4', 'Films', 'reasonably', 'well', 'produced', 'solid', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'should', 'define', 'one', 'person', 'career-best', 'shot', 'feels', 'mostly', 'bloated', 'tele-film', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'violence', 'exceedingly', 'tame', 'language', 'mostly', 'control', 'brief', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'trailer', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'feature', 'NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'utter', 'disappointment.In', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'Phase', '4', 'Films', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'INSIGHT', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",Insight

She disturbs a crime scene and the police........do NOTHING?  This just names a few but it was the constant unbelievability of this protagonist that just drove me nuttier than a fruitcake.

The defibrillator is applied and Kaitlyn gets too close, is shocked and blacks out. She comes to asking about Allison.Kaitlyn believes Allison passed on a cryptic message before she died. Her co-workers tell her she flatlined on the way to the hospital.Kaitlyn can't let it go and goes behind the police tape surrounding Allison's apartment. She meets a neighbor Shep Hagen (Christopher Lloyd), who has a key to Allison's. She is able to use some misdirection, get the key and go inside. She finds a photo of Allison with a boyfriend, Kaitlyn starts to have visions of someone else being in the apartment and flees. Outside she blacks out and collapses close to the sight where Allison was killed.When she comes to, she meets Detective Peter Rafferty (Sean Patrick Flanery) who has been assigned the case. The detective begins to question her sanity, but is obviously attracted to Kaitlyn, so overlooks her crazy theories.Insight has gotten mediocre reviews. It's actually a pretty neat little thriller.
