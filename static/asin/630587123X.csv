481594,A1EHB4EG09BVYP,630587123X,Alan Mora,"[17, 17]","The Queen of Exploitation, Doris Wishman, brings us one of her most successful films and her most popular female superstar, Chesty Morgan (billed in this movie as ""Zsa Zsa"").  Where in the world did Doris Wishman find Chesty Morgan?  I'm sure there's a story there.  Chesty is clumsy throughout the film, she has zero talent as far as acting ability is concerned and she looks as if she is absolutely miserable in practically every scene.  Her teeth are hideous, her wigs are tacky, and whomever it was that told her to get dressed for every scene in the closet in the dark should be ashamed of themselves!  As is the trademark for Doris Wishman movies there are many shots of feet, lamps, and other such inanimate objects for no apparent reason (often the camera will zoom in on Chesty's monsterous breasts) but all of this makes the film more appealing in a strange and bizzare way.  The plot is simple...after the mob kills her boyfriend, Crystal (played by Chesty) goes on a rampage and murders his killers using the only weapons she has....her 73 inch breasts!  Yes, she actually suffocates her victims between her ample bossoms in mind boggling murder sequences that must be seen to be believed!  This film was so successful that it spawned a pseudo-sequel titled ""Double Agent 73"" which also features Chesty and is directed by Wishman.",5,You must see this movie in order to believe it!,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,1342,"['Queen', 'Exploitation', 'Doris', 'Wishman', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'most', 'popular', 'female', 'superstar', 'Chesty', 'Morgan', 'billed', 'movie', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Where', 'world', 'did', 'Doris', 'Wishman', 'find', 'Chesty', 'Morgan', ""'m"", 'sure', 'story', 'there', 'Chesty', 'clumsy', 'film', 'zero', 'talent', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'ability', 'concerned', 'absolutely', 'miserable', 'practically', 'scene', 'teeth', 'are', 'hideous', 'wigs', 'are', 'tacky', 'was', 'told', 'get', 'dressed', 'scene', 'closet', 'dark', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'trademark', 'Doris', 'Wishman', 'movies', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'feet', 'lamps', 'other', 'such', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'apparent', 'reason', 'often', 'camera', 'will', 'zoom', 'Chesty', 'monsterous', 'breasts', 'film', 'more', 'appealing', 'strange', 'bizzare', 'way', 'plot', 'simple', 'mob', 'boyfriend', 'Crystal', 'played', 'Chesty', 'rampage', 'murders', 'killers', 'using', 'only', 'weapons', '.her', '73', 'inch', 'breasts', 'Yes', 'actually', 'victims', 'ample', 'bossoms', 'mind', 'boggling', 'murder', 'sequences', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'spawned', 'pseudo-sequel', 'titled', 'Double', 'Agent', '73', 'also', 'Chesty', 'directed', 'Wishman']",Deadly Weapons

Dalton,"[6, 9]","Chesty Morgan (real name Lillian Wilczkowsky but billed here assimply Zsa Zsa) and her 73"" bust made their movie debut in thiscult sleaze classic by schlock-shock director Doris Wishman.  Inthis sexploitation tale Chesty uses her gargantuan chesties tosmother the bad guys who killed her lover.  What a way to go!  Atleast it's a novel idea -- the only one in this bizarre film.  Theimage and sound quality are pretty good.This DVD has few things to recommend it except the movie itself.Just a theatrical trailer for the movie and its sequel, Double Agent73, a chapter index, a silent montage of posters of other Wishmanefforts, and a short subject called ""Breast Development"" whichlooks like it was transferred from a poor quality 16mm film fromthe `50s.  It's rather tepid but of some interest.The main interest is, of course, Chesty herself and her incredibleendowments, which she displays here at every opportunity.

481596,A1S3C5OFU508P3,630587123X,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 1]","My first exposure to this exposure was in my teens when a male friend and I went to a drive-in movie. We were similar in that our breast experience was limited to suckling at our mother's breasts or accidental encounters with a bare female relative. Therefore, we were both big-time gaga over the ""bigtime"" gaga's that appeared so often on the screen. Every possible excuse (and many times without one) is used to fix the camera on Chesty's massive mammary glands. In our teens, we used to joke about girls that could be dangerous if they spun around quickly, but with Chesty it may not all be a joke. She is huge and saggy.Other than that, this movie has practically nothing going for it, the plot is slow, dull, and it meanders back and forth from plot movement to breast movement. It is difficult to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Fundamentally, Chesty's boyfriend is killed by mobsters, so after a good soaking of her bare breasts by her tears she vows to seek revenge. She then tracks them down one-by-one and kills them by smothering them with her bare breasts. ""If you're gonna die anyway . . .""This movie is really bad, suitable only for reliving a high point of your youth or as an element of a bad movie festival where you invite some close friends so that you can all hoot at the hooters.",2,What a chest!

Let's face it : while perhaps a John Waters, Russ Meyer or Pedro Almodovar might have had the guts to make a tongue in cheek film about a lady who's mountainous boobies were her deadly weapons, who but Doris Wishman could have done it so... well so *un*campily... This is a typical trademark of Doris Wishman's films...  - - While an Ed Wood Film will make you laugh, Waters puke and Russ Meyer run for a cold shower, expect none of this from a Doris Wishman film... no matter how much nudity or violence there is... no flinching, no gasps... and no woodies... yet, despite the absence of this, your jaws will drop at times... and that my friend is art... unintentional perhaps... but art nonetheless...

481599,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,630587123X,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","Crime drama and sexploitation go together like peanut butter and jelly, and Doris Wishman is certainly one director who made a career off blending the perverse with the criminal. So, you'd think with a gimmick like Chesty Morgan at her disposal, you'd have an easy winning sleaze-fest. Sadly, you'd be very much mistaken.In &#34;Deadly Weapons,&#34; Chesty plays a woman named Crystal, who's boyfriend is a member of the mob. But when he double-crosses his boss, he ends up dead. So, Crystal sets out to revenge her lover with the two best weapons she has: her enormous breasts! That's as far as any story development goes.To say the plot here is tissue thin, is really an insult to tissues. Little in this freak show makes any sense. We never learn what the information is that the crime boss is so eager to recover. And when Chesty's character goes for her revenge, there is absolutely no planning of any kind. She just packs up and miraculously finds her targets. The attempt for a twist ending, unlike Chesty herself, falls completely flat. Throw in some of Wishman's typical directorial excesses throughout the film, like lingering camera shots of the floor or ashtrays and plants, as well as a group of actors who don't know how to deliver lines, even they are sent by Western Union, and you have a train wreak larger than Chesty's own boobs.And speaking of which, let me say, as an American male of the heterosexual persuasion, I love me some boobies. But Chesty's aren't sexy at all. Not just because their massive size is so unseemly, but she really doesn't even know how to use them effectively. There's a striptease scene she does about halfway in the film and it has to be the most unerotic thing I've ever seen. She just looks like she walking through the whole movie bored out of her mind. Even a scene where she bathes is completely unenticing.Is there anything worth seeing here? Well, there is some nice scenic shots of the old 70's Las Vegas and Miami. And the opening montage during the credits is as close as Chesty comes to doing anything of value with her ample mammaries. That's about it, however.No one ever goes into a sexploitation film like this expecting great cinematic brilliance, but you do expect some level of entertainment value, either by arousal or unintentional humor and a fun plot. This film has neither of those qualities, which given Chesty's figure you might think wouldn't be possible. There was certainly enough potential with the material and assets here to make something that could have been some dirty fun, but there was simply no follow through by anyone involved with this production. What you end up with is an uninteresting and unerotic film, which is pretty much a kiss of death in this genre. Unless you are a total Doris Wishman die-hard, this one should be an easy skip for you.",1,Never has one woman done so LITTLE with so MUCH!,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2834,"['Crime', 'drama', 'sexploitation', 'go', 'together', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jelly', 'Doris', 'Wishman', 'certainly', 'one', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'blending', 'perverse', 'criminal', 'So', ""'d"", 'think', 'gimmick', 'Chesty', 'Morgan', 'disposal', ""'d"", 'have', 'easy', 'winning', 'sleaze-fest', 'Sadly', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'much', 'mistaken.In', '34', 'Deadly', 'Weapons', '34', 'Chesty', 'woman', 'named', 'Crystal', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'member', 'mob', 'when', 'boss', 'up', 'dead', 'So', 'Crystal', 'out', 'revenge', 'lover', 'two', 'best', 'weapons', 'enormous', 'breasts', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'development', 'goes.To', 'say', 'plot', 'here', 'tissue', 'thin', 'really', 'insult', 'tissues', 'Little', 'freak', 'show', 'sense', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'information', 'crime', 'boss', 'so', 'eager', 'recover', 'when', 'Chesty', 'character', 'revenge', 'absolutely', 'planning', 'kind', 'just', 'up', 'miraculously', 'targets', 'attempt', 'twist', 'ending', 'Chesty', 'completely', 'flat', 'Throw', 'Wishman', 'typical', 'directorial', 'excesses', 'film', 'lingering', 'camera', 'shots', 'floor', 'ashtrays', 'plants', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deliver', 'lines', 'even', 'are', 'sent', 'Western', 'Union', 'have', 'train', 'wreak', 'larger', 'Chesty', 'own', 'boobs.And', 'speaking', 'let', 'say', 'American', 'male', 'heterosexual', 'persuasion', 'love', 'boobies', 'Chesty', 'are', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'Not', 'just', 'massive', 'size', 'so', 'unseemly', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'effectively', 'striptease', 'scene', 'halfway', 'film', 'be', 'most', 'unerotic', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'walking', 'whole', 'movie', 'bored', 'mind', 'Even', 'scene', 'where', 'completely', 'unenticing.Is', 'there', 'anything', 'worth', 'seeing', 'here', 'Well', 'nice', 'scenic', 'shots', 'old', '70', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Miami', 'opening', 'montage', 'credits', 'as', 'close', 'Chesty', 'doing', 'anything', 'value', 'ample', 'mammaries', 'one', 'ever', 'sexploitation', 'film', 'expecting', 'great', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'do', 'expect', 'level', 'entertainment', 'value', 'arousal', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'fun', 'plot', 'film', 'qualities', 'given', 'Chesty', 'figure', 'might', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'possible', 'was', 'certainly', 'enough', 'potential', 'material', 'assets', 'here', 'make', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dirty', 'fun', 'there', 'was', 'simply', 'follow', 'anyone', 'involved', 'production', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'uninteresting', 'unerotic', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'kiss', 'death', 'genre', 'are', 'total', 'Doris', 'Wishman', 'die-hard', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'skip']",Deadly Weapons
