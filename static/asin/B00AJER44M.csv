1612367,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00AJER44M,Acute Observer,"[3, 9]","Henry Ford - American Experience, 2013 filmHenry Ford established a rubber plantation in Brazil and created a company town. He basically invented the automobile as a product for the many, not a toy for the rich. Ford went from a farmer's son to one of the richest men in the world by building a product people wanted. Raised on a farm, he became a machinist and engineer. [The craze for bicycles in the 1890s allowed people to travel where they wanted when they wanted without the limitation of railway lines.] Ford believed in improving his product. His background led him to view the wealthy as his enemy. Ford's racing car won a race and gained publicity. He incorporated the Ford Motor Company in 1903. He innovated yet kept the design simple for his customers. The Model T was low cost and durable, transportation for everyone. Manufacturing parts took less time than assembling a car; the assembly line sped up production (from twelve hours to just over one hour).The film shows men working at various jobs. Many left these repetitive jobs. Ford offered $5 an hour for an eight hour day to reduce turnover and increase consumption by his workers. This created a sensation in the news. His pride grew. Ford had English language classes for immigrant workers. He had a Sociological group to look into worker's lives and control them. He built a large estate in Dearborn rather than Gross Pointe. He disdained wealthy society. In 1915 he began a new plant at River Rouge. There was a conflict with some investigators over non-payment of dividends. Ford planned a new car company whose real aim was to get investors to sell their shares; it worked, he gained control. A libel suit expose a lack of knowledge on subjects known to high-school students. Ford won this libel suit. Ford hated lawyers as well as investors.[This film does not mention Ford's attempts to bring peace during the Great War in 1916, a controversial political action.] Ford loved camping in the wilderness, leading a simple life. He started a campaign against Wall Street and the Jews (as the source of all evil). Many condemned him for this. [Was this due to hardening of the arteries?] Automobiles increased steel, rubber, and gasoline production. The 1920s saw changes in America. [More people now lived in cities than the country.] General Motors now offered competition to the Model T. [""Change is the only constant.""] They began to produce the Model A in 1927. Fast, reliable, safe, affordable, and successful.Ford created Greenfield Village as a museum to the recent past. The Crash of October 1929 damaged the market for cars. Ford came to depend on Harry Bennett and his goons to run his plants. Edsel's style irritated his father, who spied on him. The United Auto Workers union organized GM and Chrysler, later Ford. There was an incident in May 1937 that was publicized. In 1941 Ford got an order to build B-24s. The UAW signed a contract with Edsel. After Edsel's death Henry took over, but a stroke affected his behavior. He died at age 83 in 1947. Grandson Henry II took over and made changes. Ford issued common stock [but the preferred stock remained in the Ford family].There are books that will provide a lot more information. Henry Ford's control of his workers probably wasn't much different than other businesses, then or now. The ""Computing, Tabulating, and Recording Company"" also banned alcohol for its employees. Banks in New York ban alcohol by state law (at least in past years). Ford's influence can be seen in the novel ""Brave New World"". Increased production benefits both manufacturers and consumers (as long as they have money).",3,One Biography of This Great Man,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,3635,"['Henry', 'Ford', 'American', 'Experience', '2013', 'filmHenry', 'Ford', 'established', 'rubber', 'plantation', 'Brazil', 'created', 'company', 'town', 'basically', 'invented', 'automobile', 'product', 'many', 'not', 'toy', 'rich', 'Ford', 'went', 'farmer', 'son', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'world', 'building', 'product', 'people', 'wanted', 'Raised', 'farm', 'became', 'machinist', 'engineer', '[', 'craze', 'bicycles', '1890s', 'allowed', 'people', 'travel', 'where', 'wanted', 'when', 'wanted', 'limitation', 'railway', 'lines', ']', 'Ford', 'believed', 'improving', 'product', 'background', 'led', 'view', 'wealthy', 'enemy', 'Ford', 'racing', 'car', 'won', 'race', 'gained', 'publicity', 'incorporated', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'Company', '1903', 'innovated', 'yet', 'kept', 'design', 'simple', 'customers', 'Model', 'T', 'was', 'low', 'cost', 'durable', 'transportation', 'everyone', 'Manufacturing', 'parts', 'took', 'less', 'time', 'assembling', 'car', 'assembly', 'line', 'sped', 'up', 'production', 'twelve', 'hours', 'just', 'one', 'hour', '.The', 'film', 'shows', 'men', 'working', 'various', 'jobs', 'Many', 'left', 'repetitive', 'jobs', 'Ford', 'offered', '5', 'hour', 'eight', 'hour', 'day', 'reduce', 'turnover', 'increase', 'consumption', 'workers', 'created', 'sensation', 'news', 'pride', 'grew', 'Ford', 'had', 'English', 'language', 'classes', 'immigrant', 'workers', 'had', 'Sociological', 'group', 'look', 'worker', 'lives', 'control', 'built', 'large', 'estate', 'Dearborn', 'rather', 'Gross', 'Pointe', 'disdained', 'wealthy', 'society', '1915', 'began', 'new', 'plant', 'River', 'Rouge', 'was', 'conflict', 'investigators', 'non-payment', 'dividends', 'Ford', 'planned', 'new', 'car', 'company', 'real', 'aim', 'was', 'get', 'investors', 'sell', 'shares', 'worked', 'gained', 'control', 'libel', 'suit', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'subjects', 'known', 'high-school', 'students', 'Ford', 'won', 'libel', 'suit', 'Ford', 'hated', 'lawyers', 'as', 'well', 'investors', '[', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'Ford', 'attempts', 'bring', 'peace', 'Great', 'War', '1916', 'controversial', 'political', 'action', ']', 'Ford', 'loved', 'camping', 'wilderness', 'leading', 'simple', 'life', 'started', 'campaign', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Jews', 'source', 'evil', 'Many', 'condemned', '[', 'Was', 'due', 'hardening', 'arteries', ']', 'Automobiles', 'increased', 'steel', 'rubber', 'gasoline', 'production', '1920s', 'saw', 'changes', 'America', '[', 'More', 'people', 'now', 'lived', 'cities', 'country', ']', 'General', 'Motors', 'now', 'offered', 'competition', 'Model', 'T.', '[', 'Change', 'only', 'constant', 'began', 'produce', 'Model', 'A', '1927', 'Fast', 'reliable', 'safe', 'affordable', 'successful.Ford', 'created', 'Greenfield', 'Village', 'museum', 'recent', 'past', 'Crash', 'October', '1929', 'damaged', 'market', 'cars', 'Ford', 'came', 'depend', 'Harry', 'Bennett', 'goons', 'run', 'plants', 'Edsel', 'style', 'irritated', 'father', 'who', 'spied', 'United', 'Auto', 'Workers', 'union', 'organized', 'GM', 'Chrysler', 'later', 'Ford', 'was', 'incident', 'May', '1937', 'was', 'publicized', '1941', 'Ford', 'got', 'order', 'build', 'B-24s', 'UAW', 'signed', 'contract', 'Edsel', 'Edsel', 'death', 'Henry', 'took', 'over', 'stroke', 'affected', 'behavior', 'died', 'age', '83', '1947', 'Grandson', 'Henry', 'II', 'took', 'over', 'made', 'changes', 'Ford', 'issued', 'common', 'stock', '[', 'preferred', 'stock', 'remained', 'Ford', 'family', ']', 'are', 'books', 'will', 'provide', 'lot', 'more', 'information', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'control', 'workers', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'other', 'businesses', 'then', 'now', 'Computing', 'Tabulating', 'Recording', 'Company', 'also', 'banned', 'alcohol', 'employees', 'Banks', 'New', 'York', 'ban', 'alcohol', 'state', 'law', 'least', 'past', 'years', 'Ford', 'influence', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'novel', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'Increased', 'production', 'benefits', 'manufacturers', 'consumers', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'money']",American Experience: Henry Ford

1612375,A3KWF0Z9R8TIHM,B00AJER44M,HoneyBadgerReviews,"[0, 0]","I had only picked-up bits and pieces of information on Henry Ford over the years, and had always wanted to see a documentary on his life that summarized it all.  This American Experience documentary may not be perfect, but it is quite good and worth viewing.The documentary captures Henry Ford as the automobile genius, a bit of his private life, and the ups and downs of his life over time. It was interesting to see how a rather simple man had a vision of making automobiles and was able to put that vision into practice. Ford often defied popular opinion and his financial backers with his ideas, and his gamble paid off.One tidbit that captured my attention is that Ford, when trying to modernize auto assembly, was inspired by seeing how cattle were handled in a slaughterhouse. As the carcass moved along (on meat hooks), various parts were taken off. He envisioned doing the same thing with an auto - except as it moved along, parts would be added on. The idea worked and the auto assembly line was born.The documentary spends a lot of time explaining the Model T Ford, which was wildly successful. Perhaps too successful? This model sold so well that Ford refused to modernize it. Ford's sales eventually began to slip as GM and Chrysler offered newer and flashier models during the Roaring 20s.Edsel Ford, his only child, was showcased a lot too.  It's unfortunate that Edsel is best remembered for the failed car with his name because he was intelligent and wanted to modernize the company in the 1930s, while Henry became more stubborn and more autocratic. Eventually Edsel fell ill in his 40s, undoubtedly worsened by his father's constant criticisms and hard-headed behavior.This film has lots of film clips and still photography of both the Ford family and the Ford factories.  It was interesting to get a glimpse back in time and see how the auto industry grew so rapidly and how it changed American society. In many ways Henry Ford did not like the new world he helped create though, and he lashed out at 'Jewish bankers' and resisted the unionization movement to the point of condoning violence to keep the company union free as long as possible.If you are a fan of the auto industry or industry titans of the 20th century you will most likely enjoy this documentary. It's packed with information and flows along quickly. Henry Ford had plenty of faults - some quite enormous - but I think his inventiveness and drive contributed considerably to the American way of life.",5,Is there a Ford in your future?,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2488,"['had', 'only', 'picked-up', 'bits', 'pieces', 'information', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'years', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'documentary', 'life', 'summarized', 'American', 'Experience', 'documentary', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'quite', 'good', 'worth', 'viewing.The', 'documentary', 'captures', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'automobile', 'genius', 'bit', 'private', 'life', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'time', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'rather', 'simple', 'man', 'had', 'vision', 'making', 'automobiles', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'vision', 'practice', 'Ford', 'often', 'defied', 'popular', 'opinion', 'financial', 'backers', 'ideas', 'gamble', 'paid', 'off.One', 'tidbit', 'captured', 'attention', 'Ford', 'when', 'trying', 'modernize', 'auto', 'assembly', 'was', 'inspired', 'seeing', 'how', 'cattle', 'were', 'handled', 'slaughterhouse', 'carcass', 'moved', 'along', 'meat', 'hooks', 'various', 'parts', 'were', 'taken', 'off', 'envisioned', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'auto', 'moved', 'along', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'added', 'idea', 'worked', 'auto', 'assembly', 'line', 'was', 'born.The', 'documentary', 'lot', 'time', 'explaining', 'Model', 'T', 'Ford', 'was', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'successful', 'model', 'sold', 'so', 'well', 'Ford', 'refused', 'modernize', 'Ford', 'sales', 'eventually', 'began', 'slip', 'GM', 'Chrysler', 'offered', 'newer', 'flashier', 'models', 'Roaring', '20s.Edsel', 'Ford', 'only', 'child', 'was', 'showcased', 'lot', 'too', 'unfortunate', 'Edsel', 'best', 'remembered', 'failed', 'car', 'name', 'was', 'intelligent', 'wanted', 'modernize', 'company', '1930s', 'Henry', 'became', 'more', 'stubborn', 'more', 'autocratic', 'Eventually', 'Edsel', 'fell', 'ill', '40s', 'undoubtedly', 'worsened', 'father', 'constant', 'criticisms', 'hard-headed', 'behavior.This', 'film', 'lots', 'film', 'clips', 'still', 'photography', 'Ford', 'family', 'Ford', 'was', 'interesting', 'get', 'glimpse', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'auto', 'industry', 'grew', 'so', 'rapidly', 'how', 'changed', 'American', 'society', 'many', 'ways', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'did', 'not', 'new', 'world', 'helped', 'create', 'lashed', 'out', ""'Jewish"", 'bankers', 'resisted', 'unionization', 'movement', 'point', 'condoning', 'violence', 'keep', 'company', 'union', 'free', 'as', 'long', 'possible.If', 'are', 'fan', 'auto', 'industry', 'industry', 'titans', '20th', 'century', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'packed', 'information', 'along', 'quickly', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'had', 'plenty', 'faults', 'quite', 'enormous', 'think', 'inventiveness', 'drive', 'contributed', 'considerably', 'American', 'way', 'life']",American Experience: Henry Ford

1612380,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00AJER44M,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[13, 16]","This is another fine example of the kind of documentaries that PBS' ""American Experience"" produces.  They make the assumption that the viewer may be well versed in the basics of a subject's life or they could just as well know nothing. The basics are often covered entertainingly so as not to bore the former and the musical score often keeps the interest in the story, even if the facts get too technical.This 110-minute documentary begins in the rubber forests of Brazil - and ends there. Not something you would expect for the story of one of America's great industrialists. But - as you will see if you watch it - it makes sense. And, it moves - just like Ford's Model T Ford - at a nice pace.  Ford was responsible to the ground-breaking $5.00 wage and the assembly line but he also did ""social engineering"" building ""towns"" for his workers to live in and providing social activities for them. He also was an anti-Semite and this is not denied in the script.The director is clever in using lots of archival movie footage - which keeps things moving along, but younger viewers should remember that until the mid-1920s, except for some experimental sound films by Ford's friend Thomas Edison, all movies were silent. So all the sounds you hear until 1930 (which is the bulk of footage here) has been supplemented by sound effects. But nicely done.One weakness I found in this production that I don't remember being in other AE productions is the identification of the ""talking heads"" who are interviewed. With the sole exception of Bob Casey, Curator of the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI - all the ""experts"" are identified by their name and the title ""Historian"". They could be college professors, authors or researchers but we are never told where they reside or their professional affiliation. All are quite interesting but I - for one - would like to know where their expertise lies.The film is narrated by actor Oliver Platt, who does a fine job. The DVD has no additional bonus features.I would recommend this to anyone interested in American history as well as those interested in business - not just the auto business.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Well done and concise portrait of Ford (and his relationship with his only son, Edsel).
