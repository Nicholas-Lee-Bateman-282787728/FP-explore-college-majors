It is not an action packed movie that would rumble your house with it's base and keep all the  neighbors on their toes. Rather this movie shows the suttle bond between a  brother and sister and it's growth through one of their daily hardships. I  should add that the director is in no hurry either to show this.  A movie  with some depth to it needs to be at a so called &quot;slow pace&quot;  inorder for the viewer to absorb and comprehend the ideas and thoughts that  are being introduced to them.If you like to watch a movie alone or  with a small crowd of patient viewers you will come out of this movie with  a big smile on your face and a happier heart :),5,Another Masterpeice,947548800,"01 11, 2000",2000,791,"['most', 'Iranian', 'made', 'movies', 'deeper', 'message', 'lesson', 'might', 'say', 'be', 'realized', 'movie', 'different', 'not', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'would', 'rumble', 'house', 'base', 'keep', 'neighbors', 'toes', 'Rather', 'movie', 'suttle', 'bond', 'brother', 'sister', 'growth', 'one', 'daily', 'hardships', 'should', 'add', 'director', 'hurry', 'either', 'show', 'movie', 'depth', 'be', 'so', 'called', 'quot', 'slow', 'pace', 'quot', 'inorder', 'viewer', 'absorb', 'comprehend', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'are', 'being', 'introduced', 'them.If', 'watch', 'movie', 'alone', 'small', 'crowd', 'patient', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'movie', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'happier', 'heart']",The White Balloon VHS

While not exactly spoiled, she is nonetheless sheltered from some of tense dynamics within her family --- and unfortunately, a stressed out mother and a father prone to violent outbursts also are far too easy for people across the world to relate to.For Razieh, it is all pretty simple --- the quest for the extra-chubby goldfish, and dealing with the twists and turns of achieving her goal.  Every child has been a situation like this, and for those of us who can remember how it felt, this movie is a fascinating and deceptively simple tale.The world can be a pretty scary place for a seven-year-old, and this movie brings that home quite powerfully.  One feels especially the ominous presence of a not particularly benign government. in the form of an intimidating military presence.The movie's success rests on the ability of the girl playing Razieh to deliver her lines while retaining that natural little girl quality.  This she does magnificently.  She is irresistably cute (and knows it) but also can be a real pain in the ass when she doesn't get what she wants.  She is also overwhelmed by the world outside, but has enough resourcefulness to stick up for herself when she is being dealt with unfairly (as with the snake charmer).She also conveys the power of loss, and reminds the viewer that just because an adult may regard something as trivial, it is nonetheless very real and very devastating to a child, and that the despair of loss for the child is as real as anything an adult might experience.  The moment when Razieh is at the pet shop and realizes that she has lost her bank note --- where she realizes that she is really screwed and also in big big trouble --- is as moving a scene in the cinema as I have seen.Some viewers may find life as it actually happens to be pretty boring cinema, and I suppose in the wrong hands it could be extremely boring, but not in this case.  This has remained one of my favorite foreign films of all times.  I look forward to my not-quite one-year-old daughter reaching Razieh's age, so that I can begin to appreciate the similarities.  I sure she will drive me crazy just like Razieh would.",5,Deceptively simple story-telling at its best,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,2284,"['Simply', 'put', 'determined', 'seven-year-old', 'girls', 'are', 'one', 'constants', 'universe', 'little', 'Razieh', 'excellent', 'example', 'not', 'exactly', 'spoiled', 'nonetheless', 'sheltered', 'tense', 'dynamics', 'family', 'unfortunately', 'stressed', 'out', 'mother', 'father', 'prone', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'also', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'people', 'world', 'relate', 'to.For', 'Razieh', 'pretty', 'simple', 'quest', 'extra-chubby', 'goldfish', 'dealing', 'twists', 'turns', 'achieving', 'goal', 'child', 'been', 'situation', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'tale.The', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary', 'place', 'seven-year-old', 'movie', 'home', 'quite', 'powerfully', 'One', 'especially', 'ominous', 'presence', 'not', 'particularly', 'benign', 'government', 'form', 'intimidating', 'military', 'presence.The', 'movie', 'success', 'ability', 'girl', 'playing', 'Razieh', 'deliver', 'lines', 'retaining', 'natural', 'little', 'girl', 'quality', 'magnificently', 'irresistably', 'cute', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'pain', 'ass', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'also', 'overwhelmed', 'world', 'enough', 'resourcefulness', 'stick', 'up', 'herself', 'when', 'being', 'dealt', 'unfairly', 'snake', 'charmer', '.She', 'also', 'conveys', 'power', 'loss', 'viewer', 'just', 'adult', 'may', 'regard', 'something', 'trivial', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'devastating', 'child', 'despair', 'loss', 'child', 'as', 'real', 'anything', 'adult', 'might', 'experience', 'moment', 'when', 'Razieh', 'pet', 'shop', 'lost', 'bank', 'note', 'where', 'really', 'screwed', 'also', 'big', 'big', 'trouble', 'moving', 'scene', 'cinema', 'have', 'seen.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'life', 'actually', 'be', 'pretty', 'boring', 'cinema', 'suppose', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'extremely', 'boring', 'not', 'case', 'remained', 'one', 'favorite', 'foreign', 'films', 'times', 'look', 'forward', 'not-quite', 'one-year-old', 'daughter', 'reaching', 'Razieh', 'age', 'can', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'similarities', 'sure', 'will', 'drive', 'crazy', 'just', 'Razieh', 'would']",The White Balloon VHS

410760,A84UFSF2SZS2W,6304274793,"EriKa ""E""","[22, 22]","The Iranian cinema industry is filled with charming films like this one. It is very subtle and understated... a tale of a little girl who wishes so much for a goldfish she sees when she and her mother are passing through the city together. She is convinced that the goldfish they see in the shop is fatter, more beautiful and superior to the goldfish they already have swimming in the pond in their courtyard at home. She begs her mother for the money to get the goldfish, but her mother denies it. The little girl then enlists her older brother's help to get the money. Eventually she succeeds in getting the money, but this is only the beginning of her adventure. At many times throughout the film, an odyssey through Tehran on Iran's New Year's Day (which I believe falls in March), the little girl and the money part company, and she has to struggle to find it and retrieve it. The story is charming and heartwarming. Iran's film censors are very strict about what they allow, so films like this are the standard fare. The films themselves are actually quite telling about everyday life in modern Iran, and I think these elements are the most telling of all. Unlike in western (particular American) cinema where you are beat over the head with parables and themes and lessons, these Iranian films just present a story simply and let you conclude whatever you like.",4,SUBTLE AND SIMPLE,982368000,"02 17, 2001",2001,1368,"['Iranian', 'cinema', 'industry', 'filled', 'charming', 'films', 'one', 'very', 'subtle', 'understated', 'tale', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'goldfish', 'when', 'mother', 'are', 'passing', 'city', 'together', 'convinced', 'goldfish', 'see', 'shop', 'fatter', 'more', 'beautiful', 'superior', 'goldfish', 'already', 'have', 'swimming', 'pond', 'courtyard', 'home', 'begs', 'mother', 'money', 'get', 'goldfish', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'then', 'older', 'brother', 'help', 'get', 'money', 'Eventually', 'getting', 'money', 'only', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'odyssey', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', 'believe', 'falls', 'March', 'little', 'girl', 'money', 'part', 'company', 'struggle', 'find', 'retrieve', 'story', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'Iran', 'film', 'censors', 'are', 'very', 'strict', 'what', 'allow', 'so', 'films', 'are', 'standard', 'fare', 'films', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'telling', 'everyday', 'life', 'modern', 'Iran', 'think', 'elements', 'are', 'most', 'telling', 'western', 'particular', 'American', 'cinema', 'where', 'are', 'beat', 'head', 'parables', 'themes', 'lessons', 'Iranian', 'films', 'just', 'present', 'story', 'simply', 'let', 'conclude', 'like']",The White Balloon VHS

At the shop, however, she discovers that she has lost the money, her family's last banknote.With an unpredictable story that unfolds in real time, and realistic characters (two snake charmers are really wonderful), ""The White Balloon"" is more than a feel-good, slice-of-life movie.
