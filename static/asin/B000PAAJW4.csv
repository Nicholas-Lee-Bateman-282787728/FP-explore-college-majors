1069287,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000PAAJW4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","Driving lessons are tough. Life lessons even more so. Combine the two and you've got a whopping big set of obstacles to overcome.Rupert Grint ofHarry Potterfame stars as Ben Marshall, a young high schooler who wants to get his driver's license. Trouble is, though, his excessively over-bearing mother Laura (Laura Linney,The Exorcism of Emily Rose) doesn't give him much help. Her focus is on her stilted relationship with god, her failing marriage to Ben's dad, Father Marshall (Nicholas Farrell), and her growing intimacy with a handsome new clergyman.The invasion of the Marshall home by a mentally disturbed Mr. Finchman (Jim Norton,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) only adds to Laura Marshall's demands on young Ben; she asks him to go find a job so they can help give funds to Mr. Finchman and get him back on his feet (even though it becomes glaringly obvious that Mr. Finchman has no idea what is going on around him).The job Ben finds is with an aging and washed-up actress named ""Dame"" Evie Walton (Julie Walters (also from theHarry Potterfilm series). What initially seems like physical work for Ben soon turns to a challenge of the heart. Evie and he become close through some outlandish antics the old actress perpetuates upon him; specifically a road trip where Ben comes to terms with his soon-to-be-adult self. Can he stick with his family, including his messed up mother and distant father? Or should he plow his own path with his newfound friend Evie as a guide? Neither option sounds overly appealing but a gathering together of personal nexus points soon make a decision necessary. And Ben's choice will give viewers a great sigh of relief.Although Rupert Grint does an okay job as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films, seeing him as a lead actor here was a bit tough to swallow. He is, for the most part, rather wooden and not a very animated character actor. By contrast, Laura Linney, Nicholas Farrell, and the estimable Julie Walters swallow up Grint's lackluster performance and make this film a solid flick. It is Walters specifically whom viewers will eagerly await to see again and again as she steals every scene she's in. Laura Linney does a great job, too, as a despicable and religious contrarian who spends too little time with her son and too much time on herself. Nicholas Farrell as Father Marshall does a good job too, finding solace away from his argumentative wife by burrowing into birding books ...and away from Ben as well (whom is consistently berated by his mother). The ending scene between Ben and his father is pulled off quite well and is the most powerful young Grint has in the film's entirety.But even with these strong performances the story is slow. And since Rupert Grint is the main character and has the most screen time, Driving Lessons often fails to inspire. If it weren't for the strong supporting cast (especially Julie Walters' performance), this one most likely would've bombed.",3,Driving Lessons Nearly Crashes And Burns,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,2950,"['Driving', 'lessons', 'are', 'tough', 'Life', 'lessons', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Combine', 'two', ""'ve"", 'got', 'whopping', 'big', 'set', 'obstacles', 'overcome.Rupert', 'Grint', 'Potterfame', 'Ben', 'Marshall', 'young', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'get', 'driver', 'license', 'Trouble', 'though', 'excessively', 'over-bearing', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'help', 'focus', 'stilted', 'relationship', 'god', 'failing', 'marriage', 'Ben', 'dad', 'Father', 'Marshall', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'growing', 'intimacy', 'handsome', 'new', 'clergyman.The', 'invasion', 'Marshall', 'home', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'Mr.', 'Finchman', 'Jim', 'Norton', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'only', 'Laura', 'Marshall', 'demands', 'young', 'Ben', 'go', 'find', 'job', 'can', 'help', 'give', 'funds', 'Mr.', 'Finchman', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'even', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'Mr.', 'Finchman', 'idea', 'what', 'going', '.The', 'job', 'Ben', 'aging', 'washed-up', 'actress', 'named', 'Dame', 'Evie', 'Walton', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'also', 'theHarry', 'Potterfilm', 'series', 'What', 'initially', 'like', 'physical', 'work', 'Ben', 'soon', 'challenge', 'heart', 'Evie', 'become', 'close', 'outlandish', 'antics', 'old', 'actress', 'specifically', 'road', 'trip', 'where', 'Ben', 'terms', 'soon-to-be-adult', 'self', 'Can', 'stick', 'family', 'including', 'messed', 'up', 'mother', 'distant', 'father', 'should', 'plow', 'own', 'path', 'newfound', 'friend', 'Evie', 'guide', 'option', 'overly', 'appealing', 'gathering', 'together', 'personal', 'nexus', 'points', 'soon', 'make', 'decision', 'necessary', 'Ben', 'choice', 'will', 'give', 'viewers', 'great', 'sigh', 'relief.Although', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'okay', 'job', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'seeing', 'lead', 'actor', 'here', 'was', 'bit', 'tough', 'swallow', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'wooden', 'not', 'very', 'animated', 'character', 'actor', 'contrast', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'estimable', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'swallow', 'up', 'Grint', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'make', 'film', 'solid', 'flick', 'Walters', 'specifically', 'whom', 'viewers', 'will', 'eagerly', 'await', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'scene', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'despicable', 'religious', 'contrarian', 'who', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'son', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Father', 'Marshall', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'finding', 'solace', 'away', 'argumentative', 'wife', 'burrowing', 'birding', 'books', 'away', 'Ben', 'as', 'well', 'whom', 'consistently', 'berated', 'mother', 'ending', 'scene', 'Ben', 'father', 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'most', 'powerful', 'young', 'Grint', 'film', 'entirety.But', 'even', 'strong', 'performances', 'story', 'slow', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'main', 'character', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'often', 'inspire', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bombed']",N/A

The idea of this movie kinda starts off like this, but to be quite honest, it bored me terrebly for few reasons. The young man has a mother who is always a bit too worried for him. She seems not to like her husband very much who is the pastor in their church. Okay, I can handle that, but I'm not sure about watching the movie for an hour and still waiting for it to take off. So the boy meets this old actrees lady who curses a lot, talks loud in public, she takes him far away from home and doesn't let him contact his family to let them know he's okay. Is that the kind of lesson she was teaching him? I don't care how annoying the mother might be, letting parents know where their children are is not just a Christian thing, at least I would assume it's not... Anyway, after they end up in some hotel the boy sleeps with some girl and so the story goes on to him trying out alchohol and dance clubs... Honestly, I don't mind none of that, but you gotta be kidding me if that's the kind of lessons the lady was trying to teach him. The movie goes on with his mother being hit by a car as if this whole time the audience just waited for that to happen. No, not really, even though the mother was kind of annoying, she seemed to me like yet another human being who is not perfect... If his mother is christian, that doesn't mean she cannot have her own mistakes or worry too much for her kid, or have problems with her husband. I wasn't sure what the religion had to do with any of the things that the movie put this boy through... Taste of sin? I don't think now days it's that hard to taste sin... To make an extremely boring movie about it with passion of bashing christian families seems like a thing for loosers who don't have a life. Even though I come from a christian family, and have a lot of friends who are christians, a behavior characterized by the boy's parents is strange news to me personally. A rather naive and empty idea. There are hundreds of happy families and not so happy regardless of which religion or phelosophy. Why do people praise this movie so much? Not sure, but watch it I guess for yourself to have your own opinnion.

It was supposed to be a ""coming of age"" film, in which a shy, repressed young man, Ben, discovers his sexuality, his independence, and his spirit through the influence of an eccentric, former actress entering her twilight years. The idea was cute, but the execution was a mish-mash of half-baked ideas that pulled the film in several opposing directions. Was this a drama? A comedy? Heartfelt family film? (Not with all those f-words...) The writer clearly couldn't choose a genre, or a consistent style. The characters were two-dimensional, the soundtrack inappropriate (what was with the Scottish fusion?), and the plot holes too large to ignore. (What work did Ben actually do for Evie?) Rupert Grint did a convincing impersonation of a deer caught in headlights, and Julie Walters pulled off more than her fair share of tantrums, but even those riveting performances couldn't keep me on the couch.

1069292,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000PAAJW4,Grady Harp,"[17, 18]","DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you.  What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. Writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive, progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors.Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post 'Harry Potter' series) is a quiet, plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do-gooder mother (Laura Linney) in a home where 'needy people', such as the murderous cross-dressing  Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), using Ben as her cover!Sad Ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor Mr. Fincham's needs.  Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created.  She hires Ben and the fireworks begin.  Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip Evie demands they take, the two learn life's lessons missing from each other's natures: Ben learns self respect and self confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.Julie Walters, always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable.  Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben.  The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film 'Harold and Maude'.  Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire.  And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations.  This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message!

Have not seen, and do not care to see, any of the Harry Potter cinemataculars. I'm not opposed to them, I just know I don't like that brand of film making. Prefer the small, the intimate, the character focused. I'm not going to compare these performances to their well known alter-egos, cuz they ain't well known to me. I watched it because it was recommended as a good film. And while promising, the sagging cliches and completely unsurprising development left me cold.Let's see, which one dimensional characters can we snap off the movie bulletin board and insert as-is? Well, there's the moody teenager, struggling to be a poet and misunderstood by his parents. That's a favorite, always popular among self-diagnosed poets who are (probably justifiably) underappreciated. Oh, over there's the flakey old lady, wild and ostentatious and outlandishly over the top, yet with that crusty heart of gold and a lesson to teach. She's been working regularly since at least ""Where's Poppa?"" There's the religious nut who, imagine that!, turns out to be a self-serving hypocrite. Haven't enough room to list all the places we've seen her before, but she sure is popular with the movie-going crowd. Better grab the sensitive conflicted priest offering New Age pablum, though it is likely what most Anglicans would offer. Don't want to appear anti-religious. Add one perky and quite pretty young girl who has friendly inconsequential sex with someone she barely knows. Gosh, there's another novel character. And for fun, toss in a wacky old man who happens to be a cross-dresser. Exotic. Controversial. Oooooh. Hmm, other than Punch and Judy, did they leave any of the Stock Characters out? I think not.Yet with all this stereotype and canned material, the movie is still almost successful. Superb performances by everyone (except the big star, Rupert Grint, whom I found a tad bland) elevate the wobbly plot and its paper thin inhabitants. Special kudos to Nicholas Farrell, often very good in this kind of role, here, quite touching as he struggles to reconnect to a world yanked out from beneath him.

Did he discover that driving isn't so great?  Or had he transcended his desires and was on to something new, courtesy of Dame Evey Walton (played by the irrepressible Julie Walters just as if Rosalind Russell had never essayed the part years ago, in AUNTIE MAME, and just as if elderly Ruth Gordon had never fallen in love with young Bud Cort years ago, in HAROLD AND MAUDE).They should box up all of Julie Walters' scenes and use them to show young actors what unbridled scene-stealing is all about.  Did she ever figure out it her character, Dame Evey Walton, is actually a dame or not, actually mad or not, actually dying or not, actually talented or not?  Perhaps the screenplay and director dictated a fatal indecision about all these questions, in the name of keeping us guessing, but Walters' performance suffers because she doesn't have a bottom line, just a vicious need to surprise and outglow her competition.  I used to think that Lily Tomlin singing with the black gospel choir in NASHVILLE was the last word in racialized exoticism, but Julie Walters makes Lily Tomlin seem like Mahalia Jackson.As for Laura Linney's accent, it's pretty wild!  Again, people used to laugh at Dick Van Dyke acting English in MARY POPPINS but she's got him beat, plus she's evil.

He does go through some overly-dramatic events with a loud and self-centered old woman, but he remains a bystander, and a baffled one at that.

1069300,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000PAAJW4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 16]","Like many I checked out ""Driving Lessons"" because it has Rupert Grint doing something other than Ron Weasley in a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  I was researching to see what else the trio of young stars of those movies had done and discovered that Emma Watson has yet to do anything else while Daniel Radcliffe, who first came to our attention in a BBC production of ""David Copperfield,"" has been performing ""Equus"" on stage, opposite Richard Griffiths, who plays Uncle Vernon in the ""Harry Potter"" movies.  Here we have Grint playing opposite Julie Walters, who plays Ron Weasley's mum and who now has quite a different role to play in this film by first time director Jeremy Brock, who wrote the screenplays for ""Mrs. Brown"" and ""The Last King of Scotland.""  Clearly it was the script that attracted not only Grint and Watlers, but Laura Linney as well, when certainly suggests that it is well worth checking out.Grint plays Ben Marshall, whose only two concerns are getting his driver's license and impressing a girl that he likes.  However, his idea of coming to an emergency stop is to drive up on a lawn and run the car into something, which is nothing compared to the disaster that awaits when Ben summons up the courage to read aloud to the girl a poem he has written and she dismisses him as being ""weird.""  Ben's mother Laura (Linney) insists she will teach him to drive, but clearly she does not want him to succeed.  What she wants is for him to play a eucalyptus tree in a church pageant, a telling metaphor for their trouble relationship.  Ben is hired by Evie Walton (Walters) to do odd jobs around her house and the older woman turns out to be an eccentric actress.  Predictably enough, Ben and Evie are the best things that have happened to each other in a long time.  He needs more than just the opportunity to learn how to drive a car, and both directly and indirectly Evie is able to help him with his education in many key regards.  She needs more than just an audience and Ben provides support in a whole bunch of key ways.An obvious goal here is for Grint to carry off a role other than Ron Wesley and Grint easily accomplishes this with an understated earnestness that works well for the character of Ben.  One thing I especially liked about his performance is that when Ben apologizes (which he has several opportunities to do), you actually believe the kid, and he does a nice job reciting Shakespeare too.  Of course, given how messed up his parents are you have to wonder how he turned out to be such a fundamentally good kid.  Meanwhile, Walters manages to keep Evie grounded when ample opportunities exist for her to go way over the top and run away with the film (in a bad way).  Linney is playing the villain in the story, usually with a smile plastered on her face and only her eyes betraying what is really going on in her warped little mind.  Also worth mentioning is Michelle Duncan as Bryony, the young girl who not only  would  like to hear Ben's poetry, but who also wants to get to the intended payoff of the private poetry reading as well.""Driving Lessons"" is one of those movies whose elements will remind you of other films.  The relationship between Ben and Evie recalls clearly ""Harold and Maude,"" albeit without the sexual element.  The relationship between Ben and his father (Nicholas Farrell) recalls ""Ordinary People"" and Walters is playing the latest in a long series of eccentric English actresses (insert your favorite example here).  However, for me the problematic element of this film is in trying to decide what position it is taking on Christianity.  Cleary Laura's hypocrisy is a target, but the same can be said for the ineffectualness of Ben's father as a rather boring vicar.  But when Laura gets her comeuppance it seems to me that the congregation comes under ridicule as well.  The music Brock selected for the soundtrack covers both sides as well, with covers of Woody Guthrie's ""Jesus Christ"" as well as the traditional ""God Don't Never Change.""  I cannot decide if Brock is making a particular point, simply obscuring his tracks, or trying to have it both ways.  Final Warning: The film is rated PG-13 because Ben lets loose with a couple of bits of profanity at the end and has a bedroom scene earlier on, so younger viewers picking up this movie because Grint and Walters are in it could be surprised and not in a pleasant may with the more mature elements.",4,"Rupert Grint and Julie Waters find something else to do together besides ""Harry Potter""",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,4420,"['many', 'checked', 'out', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'doing', 'something', 'other', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'was', 'researching', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'trio', 'young', 'stars', 'movies', 'had', 'done', 'discovered', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'yet', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'who', 'first', 'came', 'attention', 'BBC', 'production', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'been', 'performing', 'Equus', 'stage', 'opposite', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Here', 'have', 'Grint', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'who', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'mum', 'who', 'now', 'quite', 'different', 'role', 'play', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Jeremy', 'Brock', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplays', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Clearly', 'was', 'script', 'attracted', 'not', 'only', 'Grint', 'Watlers', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'well', 'when', 'certainly', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.Grint', 'plays', 'Ben', 'Marshall', 'only', 'two', 'concerns', 'are', 'getting', 'driver', 'license', 'impressing', 'girl', 'However', 'idea', 'coming', 'emergency', 'stop', 'drive', 'up', 'lawn', 'run', 'car', 'something', 'nothing', 'compared', 'disaster', 'when', 'Ben', 'up', 'courage', 'read', 'aloud', 'girl', 'poem', 'written', 'being', 'weird', 'Ben', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'will', 'teach', 'drive', 'clearly', 'not', 'want', 'succeed', 'What', 'play', 'eucalyptus', 'tree', 'church', 'pageant', 'telling', 'metaphor', 'trouble', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'hired', 'Evie', 'Walton', 'Walters', 'do', 'odd', 'jobs', 'house', 'older', 'woman', 'out', 'be', 'eccentric', 'actress', 'Predictably', 'enough', 'Ben', 'Evie', 'are', 'best', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'other', 'long', 'time', 'more', 'just', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'Evie', 'able', 'help', 'education', 'many', 'key', 'regards', 'more', 'just', 'audience', 'Ben', 'support', 'whole', 'bunch', 'key', 'ways.An', 'obvious', 'goal', 'here', 'Grint', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'other', 'Ron', 'Wesley', 'Grint', 'easily', 'understated', 'earnestness', 'well', 'character', 'Ben', 'One', 'thing', 'especially', 'liked', 'performance', 'when', 'Ben', 'several', 'opportunities', 'do', 'actually', 'believe', 'kid', 'nice', 'job', 'reciting', 'Shakespeare', 'too', 'course', 'given', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'parents', 'are', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'kid', 'Meanwhile', 'Walters', 'keep', 'Evie', 'grounded', 'when', 'ample', 'opportunities', 'exist', 'go', 'way', 'top', 'run', 'away', 'film', 'bad', 'way', 'Linney', 'playing', 'villain', 'story', 'usually', 'smile', 'plastered', 'face', 'only', 'eyes', 'betraying', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'warped', 'little', 'mind', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Michelle', 'Duncan', 'Bryony', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'Ben', 'poetry', 'who', 'also', 'get', 'intended', 'payoff', 'private', 'poetry', 'reading', 'as', 'well', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'one', 'movies', 'elements', 'will', 'remind', 'other', 'films', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Evie', 'clearly', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'sexual', 'element', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'father', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Walters', 'playing', 'latest', 'long', 'series', 'eccentric', 'English', 'actresses', 'insert', 'favorite', 'example', 'here', 'However', 'problematic', 'element', 'film', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'position', 'taking', 'Christianity', 'Cleary', 'Laura', 'hypocrisy', 'target', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'ineffectualness', 'Ben', 'father', 'rather', 'boring', 'vicar', 'when', 'Laura', 'comeuppance', 'congregation', 'ridicule', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'Brock', 'selected', 'soundtrack', 'sides', 'well', 'covers', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'as', 'well', 'traditional', 'God', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Never', 'Change', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'Brock', 'making', 'particular', 'point', 'simply', 'obscuring', 'tracks', 'trying', 'have', 'ways', 'Final', 'Warning', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Ben', 'lets', 'loose', 'couple', 'bits', 'profanity', 'end', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'earlier', 'so', 'younger', 'viewers', 'picking', 'up', 'movie', 'Grint', 'Walters', 'are', 'could', 'be', 'surprised', 'not', 'pleasant', 'may', 'more', 'mature', 'elements']",N/A
1069301,A2C4I09VM52T81,B000PAAJW4,Lisa,"[2, 3]","I had seen a few ads for Driving Lessons, and as I adore Rupert Grint and Julie Walters, I thought this would be a fun movie.  This movie definatly exceeded my expectations. It was a funny, quirky, realistic tale of a young, repressed boy named Ben (Grint) and the crazy retired actress he works for named Evie (played by Walters) who brings him out of his shell and helps him break away from his all controlling hyprocritical mother (Linney).  With no false pretenses, it told a heartwarming story with a familar message presented in a non preachy, unassuming matter.The acting was frankly fantastic.  Walters was eccentric, funny, larger then life and great, Linney was delightfully evil in a holier than thou, controlling matter,(though at times the accent was slightly forced yet still pretty good) but I felt it was definatly Grint who totally stepped it up in this movie easily proving that he's not just a sidekick but can handle different movies with ease.  As a general rule I  don't compare actors to parts they have done in other movies (because in each movie, hoefully they are a totally different character), but I'll bend it for Grint.  In the Potter films he provides ample comic relief but he's often outshined, and overlooked in favor of Radcliffe and Watson who in fairness do have the meatier parts.  Grint's character has  been downsized to a funny sidekick, and therefore allowed to get away with decent, if mediocre preformances relying manly on his raw talent.  His character in Potter never seemed to go beyond 1-dimensional.  In Driving Lessions, Grint definatly showed what he could do if he was pushed, particulary in the second half of the film, prompting a more sympathetic view of him in general, as in Potter he's never given much to do or work with.  Though I would have liked to see Grint pushed still further in Driving Lessons, and really want to see him tackle darker, less sympathetic roles, this movie in itself finally did him justice showing he's an actor to be reckoned with.All in all this a movie I would definatly see. My only critique of it would be that the overall plot in itself was a bit predicatble, and sometimes the movie fell just short of really going all the way there- it was nearly there but not quite.  Plus there were a few times were it began to trend the ridiculous- the cross dressing charity nut case taken in by Ben's mom didn't really add much to the story, and likewise Ben's dad character wasn't fully realized.  Besides these forgivable faults (because really nearly anythings forgivable in a movie as long as the characters are good, and there's some sembelance of a plot) this movie was a defiante must see- you'll either love it, or at least appreciate that Grint is a way better actor then he's given credit for.",5,I ADORED IT,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,2784,"['had', 'seen', 'few', 'ads', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'adore', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'movie', 'definatly', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'was', 'funny', 'quirky', 'realistic', 'tale', 'young', 'repressed', 'boy', 'named', 'Ben', 'Grint', 'crazy', 'retired', 'named', 'Evie', 'played', 'Walters', 'who', 'shell', 'break', 'away', 'controlling', 'hyprocritical', 'mother', 'Linney', 'false', 'pretenses', 'told', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'familar', 'message', 'presented', 'non', 'preachy', 'unassuming', 'matter.The', 'acting', 'was', 'frankly', 'fantastic', 'Walters', 'was', 'eccentric', 'funny', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'great', 'Linney', 'was', 'delightfully', 'evil', 'holier', 'thou', 'controlling', 'matter', 'times', 'accent', 'was', 'slightly', 'forced', 'yet', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'felt', 'was', 'definatly', 'Grint', 'who', 'totally', 'stepped', 'up', 'movie', 'easily', 'proving', 'not', 'just', 'sidekick', 'can', 'handle', 'different', 'movies', 'ease', 'general', 'rule', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'actors', 'parts', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'movies', 'movie', 'hoefully', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'character', ""'ll"", 'bend', 'Grint', 'Potter', 'films', 'ample', 'comic', 'relief', 'often', 'outshined', 'overlooked', 'favor', 'Radcliffe', 'Watson', 'who', 'fairness', 'do', 'have', 'meatier', 'parts', 'Grint', 'character', 'been', 'downsized', 'funny', 'sidekick', 'therefore', 'allowed', 'get', 'away', 'decent', 'mediocre', 'preformances', 'relying', 'manly', 'raw', 'talent', 'character', 'Potter', 'never', 'seemed', 'go', '1-dimensional', 'Driving', 'Lessions', 'Grint', 'definatly', 'showed', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'pushed', 'particulary', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'prompting', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'general', 'Potter', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Grint', 'pushed', 'still', 'further', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'tackle', 'darker', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'roles', 'movie', 'finally', 'did', 'justice', 'showing', 'actor', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.All', 'movie', 'would', 'definatly', 'see', 'only', 'critique', 'would', 'be', 'overall', 'plot', 'was', 'bit', 'predicatble', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'fell', 'just', 'short', 'really', 'going', 'way', 'there-', 'was', 'nearly', 'there', 'not', 'quite', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'were', 'began', 'trend', 'ridiculous-', 'cross', 'dressing', 'charity', 'nut', 'case', 'taken', 'Ben', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'story', 'likewise', 'Ben', 'dad', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'forgivable', 'faults', 'really', 'nearly', 'anythings', 'forgivable', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'sembelance', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'defiante', 'must', 'see-', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'least', 'appreciate', 'Grint', 'way', 'better', 'actor', 'then', 'given', 'credit']",N/A

Though it definitely had its maudlin/trite moments, it's worth seeing for Julie Walters' great performances and to take a look at what Grint can do minus his Hogwarts wand.Grint plays Ben, a 17-ish young man with an overbearing mother (Linney, though it's not her best work). Ben's mom, a priest's wife, makes it her personal mission to take care of all the aged people in their neighborhood, and she enlists Ben's help in caring for them. She also demands a strict schedule of driving lessons (administered by herself, of course) so that Ben can earn his license (which has been, thus far, elusive). Finally, she suggests that Ben get a summer job so that he can contribute his income to helping another one of his mother's projects - an older man who accidentally ran over his wife and is now living with them until he ""recovers.""In this suffocating environment, Ben takes a job as the assistant to an aging actress, Evie (Walters). Evie is the original free spirit, mixed with equal parts vanity, insecurity, short temper, and loneliness. The two are oddly compatible, and Ben soon begins learning all kinds of things about life from Evie's quick one-liners and current struggles.Though I thought the script could have been a bit tighter, and I thought that Grint's character could have undergone more meaningful change, I liked this film. Walters is amazing in it, and she clearly anchors the whole production. (With a lesser actress in this role, the whole film would have come tumbling down.) Grint has the hunched, insecure, shy act down pat, but I longed to see more of a transformation in him during the course of the film. Also, I would like to see Grint eventually play a character more dramatically different from Ron Weasley. If he doesn't do so, and soon, he will be relegated to this character type for a while.Worth watching for the one-liners and for Walters' performance.",3,"Awkward, coming-of-age dramedy",1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1987,"['watched', 'Driving', 'Lessons', 'starring', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'week', 'definitely', 'had', 'maudlin/trite', 'moments', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'great', 'performances', 'take', 'look', 'what', 'Grint', 'can', 'do', 'minus', 'Hogwarts', 'wand.Grint', 'plays', 'Ben', '17-ish', 'young', 'man', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Linney', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'Ben', 'mom', 'priest', 'wife', 'personal', 'mission', 'take', 'care', 'aged', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'Ben', 'help', 'caring', 'also', 'strict', 'schedule', 'driving', 'lessons', 'administered', 'course', 'Ben', 'can', 'earn', 'license', 'been', 'thus', 'far', 'elusive', 'Finally', 'Ben', 'get', 'summer', 'job', 'so', 'can', 'contribute', 'income', 'helping', 'one', 'mother', 'projects', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'accidentally', 'ran', 'wife', 'now', 'living', 'recovers', 'suffocating', 'environment', 'Ben', 'job', 'assistant', 'aging', 'actress', 'Evie', 'Walters', 'Evie', 'original', 'free', 'spirit', 'mixed', 'equal', 'parts', 'vanity', 'insecurity', 'short', 'temper', 'loneliness', 'two', 'are', 'oddly', 'compatible', 'Ben', 'soon', 'learning', 'kinds', 'things', 'life', 'Evie', 'quick', 'one-liners', 'current', 'struggles.Though', 'thought', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'tighter', 'thought', 'Grint', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'undergone', 'more', 'meaningful', 'change', 'liked', 'film', 'Walters', 'amazing', 'clearly', 'anchors', 'whole', 'production', 'lesser', 'actress', 'role', 'whole', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'tumbling', 'down', 'Grint', 'hunched', 'insecure', 'shy', 'act', 'down', 'pat', 'longed', 'see', 'more', 'transformation', 'course', 'film', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Grint', 'eventually', 'play', 'character', 'more', 'dramatically', 'different', 'Ron', 'Weasley', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'relegated', 'character', 'type', 'while.Worth', 'watching', 'one-liners', 'Walters', 'performance']",N/A
1069306,A232JQR4NBH9SX,B000PAAJW4,Nikola,"[0, 0]","""Driving Lessons"", Rupert Grint's first important movie since ""Harry Potter"" is a throughly enjoyable effort. It tells a story of Ben, a 17-year old Jesus-obsessed high schooler, hired to take care of a second-rate ex-actress Evie (Julie Walters). Evie is very free-spirited, and after the initial shock (and a life-altering road trip), Ben starts questioning his values, upbringing and desires, much to the dislike of his controlling mother (Laura Liney).The themes and the plot are masterfully thought-out, and although this movie could easily be tagged as ""coming-of-age"" or ""disrespectful-of-Christianity"", it never really falls into cliches of these categories. The very subtle execution and fantastic performances promise to make it watchable and easy to relate to. Grint is amazing as Ben, boldly venturing into much more mature material than his previous efforts, and Julie Walters is hilarious as Ben's confidante and roll model. Although there are plenty of laughs, the movie is essentially a drama, handling the conflicts these characters deal with in a very serious manner.

Ben's father is the local parish vicar (Richard Marshall), a well meaning but somewhat defeated man, and his mother Laura (Laura Linney) either has to be in control of everything and when she's not controlling everything, she's a religious fanatic. Laura decides that the family will take in a homeless old man who accidentally killed his wife (driving over her) and it's suggested to Ben that he get a job so he can earn some money to contribute to the new house guest's wellbeing. Ben does in fact get a job, assisting a once great actress Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), who is remembered more for her role in a soap opera than her great theatrical triumphs. The eccentric ""Evie"" seems to be exactly what the young Ben needs. She doesn't so much instill a sense of confidence in him as she exposes him to a new world: one that is full of possibilities, free of judgment, and a world waiting to be explored. This occurs during an unplanned trip to Edinburgh, at least unplanned by Ben, and he learns to dive en route,  hence the film's title DRIVING LESSONS.I'll admit, when I first watched, DRIVING LESSONS it did not appear to be all that original, and if anything a bit clich&eacute;. It has some moments where the film is a bit improbable and a few scenes could have been deleted or tweaked a bit to make a stronger story. The characters started out more as caricatures than actual people. Ben seemed almost too fearful and withdrawn, Laura Marshall a bit too fanatical, and Evie a bit too eccentric. You almost think ""I've seen this before in other films,"" yet as the film progresses, the story gets stronger and the characters, especially Ben and Evie grow on the viewer, the characters become individuals, a bond develops between the viewers and characters, and we care how the film will conclude.Overall in spite of its flaws, it is an enjoyable film with some rather humorous moments and worth watching.",4,A Good Film That's At Times Touching And Humorous,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,2112,"['DRIVING', 'LESSONS', 'endearing', 'British', 'film', 'young', 'Ben', 'Marshall', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'overly', 'awkward', 'shy', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'less', 'ideal', 'home', 'situation', 'Ben', 'father', 'local', 'parish', 'vicar', 'Richard', 'Marshall', 'well', 'meaning', 'somewhat', 'defeated', 'man', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'either', 'be', 'control', 'everything', 'when', 'not', 'controlling', 'everything', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'Laura', 'family', 'will', 'take', 'homeless', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'wife', 'driving', 'suggested', 'Ben', 'get', 'job', 'can', 'earn', 'money', 'contribute', 'new', 'house', 'guest', 'wellbeing', 'Ben', 'fact', 'get', 'job', 'assisting', 'once', 'great', 'actress', 'Dame', 'Eve', 'Walton', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'who', 'remembered', 'more', 'role', 'soap', 'opera', 'great', 'theatrical', 'triumphs', 'eccentric', 'Evie', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'young', 'Ben', 'needs', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'instill', 'sense', 'confidence', 'new', 'world', 'one', 'full', 'possibilities', 'free', 'judgment', 'world', 'waiting', 'be', 'explored', 'unplanned', 'trip', 'Edinburgh', 'least', 'unplanned', 'Ben', 'dive', 'route', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'DRIVING', 'LESSONS.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'DRIVING', 'LESSONS', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'original', 'anything', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'bit', 'improbable', 'few', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'tweaked', 'bit', 'make', 'stronger', 'story', 'characters', 'started', 'out', 'more', 'caricatures', 'actual', 'people', 'Ben', 'seemed', 'almost', 'too', 'fearful', 'withdrawn', 'Laura', 'Marshall', 'bit', 'too', 'fanatical', 'Evie', 'bit', 'too', 'eccentric', 'almost', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'yet', 'film', 'story', 'stronger', 'characters', 'especially', 'Ben', 'Evie', 'grow', 'viewer', 'characters', 'become', 'individuals', 'bond', 'viewers', 'characters', 'care', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'conclude.Overall', 'spite', 'flaws', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'rather', 'humorous', 'moments', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
