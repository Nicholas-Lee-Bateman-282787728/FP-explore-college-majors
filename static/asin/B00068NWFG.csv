It is worth every penny, unlike all the rest of the Boxes for series it's shaped like Zim's house in the series with an opening door that that is magnetic and the roof opens too with a little Gir toy inside, but this house comes in its own large box too - so thats 2 boxes for the price of one and you get a DVD as well with the unmade episodes audio's on it as well. It is a fantastic buy!

863368,A27M0C8ZHDWSEG,B00068NWFG,"Groove Holmes ""Groove""","[16, 20]","First off, it's a miracle that Jhonen Vasquez was even able to make a cartoon, a miracle that Nick produced it,  a miracle the design and animation and voice talent was as great as it was, a miracle that it was put to DVD and a huge miracle that we now have toys and shirts and DVD Collector's boxes.Does anyone remember the days when we thought this would never make it to DVD? The lame 3 inch DVD's to ""test the waters?"" Anyone? I mean, my girlfriend just got a Gir shirt at Target!! Not Hot Topic!! TARGET!!Please put this in persepective...if you don't wanna shell out the 30 bucks then don't. You have to understand how things are priced relative to the numbers produced...This ain't a Harry Potter DVD that will sell 20 million copies...the time and cost to make something is high if you're only going to sell 3500 of them...jeez people!! It's just like a collectible toy or book or comic statue. It still costs the same money to produce something that will sell a million copies or something that wll sell 1000 copies. When it's limited it costs more to cover the production cost.I personally think it's one of the coolest things I own. Has anyone ever priced Anime boxes? Anyone? And the ""design"" is just that it's a box. And they're like 6 discs for 150 bucks.And one last thing: this is in no way a ""rip-off"" as some have said. No, a rip-off would be if they released this box with the 4 DVD's and that's it, leaving those of us who bought each of the first 3 DVD sets out in the cold. I think it was brilliant and very acommodating that they released a ""full"" and ""empty"" box. They were very mindful of the rabid fans in doing that.And again, if you feel that it's a rip-off then just don't buy it.

The box set that includes the series is about $90, which seems fair to me considering I paid $15 for each of the three volumes.  So, really, they haven't ripped anyone off by releasing the box set after they released the three volume dvds.  If anything, the people who bought the dvds before the box set came out are getting a better deal than those who bought the $90 box set especially since we can now buy the special features box set so inexpensively.

863370,A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B00068NWFG,Pecos Bill,"[48, 53]","Wow.  Invader Zim is awesome.  I'd heard of it, vaguely, but only watched it when my Tivo happened to record an episode at random one day.  I had it record a few more, then went and bought this ""House Box Complete Set"".First off, Invader Zim is hilarious for all age ranges.  The animation style and overt humor will surely appeal to the younger crowd but there's plenty of jabs that adults will laugh over.  (As the hamster runs on a wheel in its cage, the teacher explains to the children that they should watch it to prepare themselves for their lives in our nightmarish corporate system, for example.)The premise of the story is that Zim is an alien Invader, so incompetent (and so oblivious to this fact) that his leaders have packed him off to invade the most distant, uncharted planet they could find: Earth.  Normally, Invaders are sent out with fearsome robot assistants but because they didn't like him, Zim's leaders gave him an ""advanced"" model, which was actually a defective unit that has a short attention span, acts crazy virtually all the time and can generally only attack people by annoying them -- Zim most of all.  Between Zim's incompetence, his insane robot and his arch-nemesis, Dib, Zim's chances of actually conquering the earth are pretty much zero but there's also roughly zero chance that he'll ever notice this or get discouraged.  Zim is nothing if not persistant.The voice acting and writing for this show are both absolutely great.  Zim in particular is fantastic.  He's a complete megalomaniac, yells almost all the time, for no good reason and has the best maniacal laugh ever.Anyway, if you're not familiar with the show, catch an episode or two on TV if you can, then come buy this.If you are familiar with the show, here's why you want this box set:* The ""house"" is awesome.  Shaped like Zim's house from the show, the front of it swings open to reveal the DVDs inside.  The roof also opens up to reveal GIR.* There's a bonus DVD that contains a ""demo"" soundtrack for the show, interviews and other stuff.  The reason it's a ""demo"" soundtrack is because it's built into the DVD and can only be played from there, it's not in CD format, which is too bad.  That much is sold seperately.  Interviews with the musician behind the show are on this DVD.* The DVDs themselves contain other extras, including an interview with the voice actors and a mode I think they're calling ""Animatrix"".  I didn't know what it was until I turned it on:  in this mode, instead of seeing the regular show, you'll see the rough drawings and storyboards used to construct the show, well before being finalized into the crisp animation you usually see.  This is pretty awesome if you wanted to get a glimpse of a work in progress.All in all, this may be the best box set I've ever bought.  It now sits proudly on top of my TV, since it's not just a box set, it's a display piece!  Sadly, it seems these shows always eventually drop off the charts and the DVD sets become unavilable so if I were you, I'd buy this.  Now, human!
