824642,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00024JC30,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 1]","Pssshhh....I have seen month old garbage that seemed more appealing than this crooked caper.  Just like the title suggests, The Big Bounce, is nothing more than a deeply contrived story that lacks in story, element, and excitement, and instead takes comfort in the ability to ""bounce"" us around from character to character in hopes that big names and Hawaiian scenery will help us forget about the plot.  Well, Mr. Director, it did not.  In fact, the poor story and lacking excitement only gives us this rotted taste in our mouths that somehow now surfaces whenever we see pictures of Hawaii, Owen Wilson, and Oscar winner Morgan Freeman.  Who read these scripts before the actors jumped aboard?  I am nearly certain that no actor in their right mind would have read this script and with the greatest pleasure, joined this production.  I have no Earthly clue as to how director George Armitage found all these people and got them to sign the dotted line, but it is the only aspect of this film that he can be applauded for.  Normally, when you see the names Morgan Freeman, Owen Wilson, and Gary Sinise, you are expecting some level of decency, yet that never seemed to arrive with The Big Bounce.The top layer of icing on this disturbing cake were the actors.  Years at Juliard thrown out the window when it came to this film.  Apparently, the appeal of working in Hawaii for free was more appealing than actually doing work that you could be proud of.  Apparently, the appeal of working in Hawaii proved better than any sort of million dollar pay scale that any of these fine, OSCAR-winning actors should deserve.  Either way, the acting gave us nothing into the lives of these flimsy, nearly one-dimensional characters.  The leader of this pact was Owen Wilson trying to give us a spin-off of his character from Bottle Rocket where these ""cute"" one-liners were allowed because Owen Wilson is so ""cute"" himself.  Give me a break.  He wasn't even acting in this film.  There were moments where I thought I could see his character beginning to form, but then he opened his mouth and any sort of evidence crashed down on the hard floor.  The same can easily be said for Freeman (which I never thought I would say about), Charlie Sheen (who was miserable in this film), and Gary Sinise (who just can't seem to cover evil that well).  From the top of the list completely down to the bottom, nobody seemed to care about actually building a character, but instead just enjoying the sun and sand.Then, as we dig deeper into this pathetic cake, we discover that not all the fault lies on the shoulder of the actors (though I would have to say that a major part does), but instead some of the dead weight of this film actually falls on the shoulders of George Armitage, director at large.  He honestly makes us wait, the honest working people that paid for this film, until halfway through the film to begin bringing us into the heart of the story.  I am nearly certain that this is not the way that Leonard would have penned it.  We have short-term characters trying to give themselves a name in this film with nothing happening within the first hour.  This is sad.  This only causes more confusion and chaos as we slowly, at an ants pace, reach the middle of the film where we finally begin to see the inevitable clich&eacute;s that follow this type of movie.  Armitage takes no risks or any creativity in building our story from the ground up and honestly acts as if he is enjoy the sand and sun as much as the rest.  He gives us nothing but bits and irrelevant pieces that show us nothing and give us even less.Then, as if perhaps the bottom of this crunchy cake would finally provide us with something of substance, actually just proves to be yet another disappointing let down.  Even when you think you know what is going on, Armitage throws that extra bit of unknown morsel your way to keep you guessing deep within the hours of the next morning.  The only trouble is, I didn't care.  When the ending of this film finally occurred, it stumped me for nearly three seconds as I realized that this wasn't the film that I needed to worry myself over.  There wasn't any reason for me to be excited when this film started, and by God, there wasn't any reason for me to find myself loosing sleep over this convoluted ending either.Armitage really did some damage with this film.  Everyone, including the amateurish editor, took a holiday on this film.  It is not a good sign when you watch the theatrical trailer to the film and then watch the film itself only to discover that half the scenes from the trailer didn't make the final cut of the film.  Oh, how sad it is to see a film like this suffer.  It had quite a bit of potential to break the common mold and provide at least several minutes of entertainment, but alas, it chose not to go the extra mile.  The idea of spending more time on the film instead of on the beach collecting rays seemed to be the popular consensus with the cast and crew.  Procrastination and poor workmanship seemed to be a hirer priority for these filmmakers and their final result will show it.Grade: * out of *****",1,God is just an imaginary friend for grown

Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Willy Nelson, Sara Foster and even Harry Dean Stanton......and the list goes on. Even the pedigree of Elmore Leonards novel and George Armitage in the directors chair (Grosse Pointe Blank) make you sit back after watching this and ask - What happened? This is a very dull movie that promises much, but fails to deliver on just about all levels. A who's scamming who? game unfolds that keeps you guessing, but fails to really grab your attention, and looks like everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck. The visual distraction of Foster (virtually bikini clad throughout the picture)wears thin very quickly, and even though I am a fan of Wilson, I found this picture to be hard work. Always waiting for something to get going leaves you feeling deflated as the end titles roll, and aside from a few sparse moments of comedy I cannot really recommend this movie. Freeman is as always engaging, but even his talents are wasted here, and one suspects that the original 1969 movie was better as it at least had an ending. The confusing and implied added ""twist"" at the end here makes no sense at all, and feels like a fun ride that ends halfway round.

824644,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00024JC30,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","`The Big Bounce' is a somewhat unusual comedy thriller somewhat similar to `Fletch', where the hero and his allies are perceived to be in real danger in the course of their largely funny business as they try to pull off some scheme or other. I confess I was not expecting a lot from this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised to find some extremely entertaining twists in action, characterization, and plot.The first big surprise was in an early piece of business where our hero, played by Owen Wilson does a take on a similarly surprising scene from `Good Will Hunting' where the lead character unexpectedly actively picks a fight with a largely innocent supporting cast member. Things continue to get stranger from there, with the three main male supporting cast members, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, and Morgan Freeman are all playing against type. Sheen and Sinise are usually in the role of hero or at least supporting the good guy. Sheen is a bumbler and Sinise is the primary heavy. I won't comment on Freeman's twist because that will give away too much of the good stuff. I was disappointed that the roles for Bebe Neuwirth and the sorely missed Harry Dean Stanton were not larger. It seemed almost a waste to use such good supporting cast members in small roles, but they played them well.I was surprised to see such a light comedy / thriller based on a story by Elmore Leonard, but it made me appreciate where the substance behind the story came. Like `Fletch' mentioned above, I suspect the movie makers did things to the story which were not really in tune with the tone of the original novel, but I think they succeeded in creating an entertaining flick. I was quite surprised by the quality of the movie, since it seems as if there was virtually no advertising campaign for the movie, or at least I slept through the fortnight when it appeared in theaters.Several over reviewers gave poor to very poor reviews to this movie, and I suspect those are based on completely different expectations, based either on reading the novel or seeing an earlier version with a cast headed by Ryan O'Neal. As I had no expectations whatsoever other than those conveyed by the cast and the very lighthearted presentation on the DVD case, I was pleasantly surprised, as I am not an especially big Owen Wilson fan, and usually watch his movies based on the reputation of his costars, such as Jackie Chan and Ben Stiller.For those of you who read the negative reviews, I recommend you reconsider. his is definitely not film noir and it is definitely not the usual thriller. It is simply good entertainment, where the main fault may have been in wasting some of the talents of the supporting cast, including Sinise, Sheen, and Stanton. Freeman is so perfectly cast and plays his role so well, that his fans should see this just for the switch he does here from his heavy thrillers like `Seven'.Recommended viewing, as long as you don't take it too seriously.",4,"Entertaining, comic, caper / confidence game movie",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2954,"['Big', 'Bounce', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Fletch', 'where', 'hero', 'allies', 'are', 'perceived', 'be', 'real', 'danger', 'course', 'largely', 'funny', 'business', 'try', 'pull', 'off', 'scheme', 'other', 'confess', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'twists', 'action', 'characterization', 'plot.The', 'first', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'early', 'piece', 'business', 'where', 'hero', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'take', 'similarly', 'surprising', 'scene', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'where', 'lead', 'character', 'unexpectedly', 'actively', 'fight', 'largely', 'innocent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'member', 'Things', 'continue', 'get', 'stranger', 'there', 'three', 'main', 'male', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'playing', 'type', 'Sheen', 'Sinise', 'are', 'usually', 'role', 'hero', 'least', 'supporting', 'good', 'guy', 'Sheen', 'bumbler', 'Sinise', 'primary', 'heavy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Freeman', 'twist', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'disappointed', 'roles', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'were', 'not', 'larger', 'seemed', 'almost', 'waste', 'use', 'such', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'small', 'roles', 'played', 'well.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'such', 'light', 'comedy', '/', 'thriller', 'based', 'story', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'made', 'appreciate', 'where', 'substance', 'story', 'came', 'Fletch', 'mentioned', 'suspect', 'movie', 'makers', 'did', 'things', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'tune', 'tone', 'original', 'novel', 'think', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'virtually', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'movie', 'least', 'slept', 'fortnight', 'when', 'appeared', 'theaters.Several', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'poor', 'very', 'poor', 'reviews', 'movie', 'suspect', 'are', 'based', 'completely', 'different', 'expectations', 'based', 'either', 'reading', 'novel', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'version', 'cast', 'headed', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'had', 'expectations', 'whatsoever', 'other', 'conveyed', 'cast', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'am', 'not', 'especially', 'big', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'fan', 'usually', 'watch', 'movies', 'based', 'reputation', 'costars', 'such', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Ben', 'Stiller.For', 'who', 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'recommend', 'reconsider', 'definitely', 'not', 'film', 'noir', 'definitely', 'not', 'usual', 'thriller', 'simply', 'good', 'entertainment', 'where', 'main', 'fault', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wasting', 'talents', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Sinise', 'Sheen', 'Stanton', 'Freeman', 'so', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'fans', 'should', 'see', 'just', 'switch', 'here', 'heavy', 'thrillers', ""Seven'.Recommended"", 'viewing', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",The Big Bounce

824650,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00024JC30,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 16]","I really didn't expect a lot from this movie - but it did feature Morgan Freeman, the greatest actor working today, as well as the scantily-clad Sara Foster, so I said what the heck.  Actually, the movie really isn't that bad.  Sure, it's a little silly and predictably unpredictable (you know how these comic con game movies are), it sometimes seems as if the actors are making things up as they go along, and the ending leaves much to be desired, but - and I hate to admit this - Owen Wilson is pretty darn funny, the Hawaiian setting is gorgeous, there's no shortage of bikini-clad ladies, and the storyline is enough to keep you interested.  You also have all these weird cameo appearances by celebrities such as Gary Sinise, Willie Nelson, Harry Dean Stanton, and Bebe Neuwirth - they don't really add to the movie, but you're always wondering what famous person will show up next.I don't think I need to explain how these con game movies work, not after all of the con game movies Hollywood has sent our way in recent years.  You've got your con, then you've got your hidden ""conspiracy"" of con men and women making things more complicated, and then you have an ending that flies off in another direction altogether without adequately explaining what just happened.  Owen Wilson plays Jack Ryan, a rather typical roustabout who has made his way to Hawaii.  There's an unfortunate incident involving his supervisor's head and a baseball bat, but oddly enough, the district judge Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman) gives him a job, and it's not long before he is hanging out with Nancy Hayes (Sara Foster), the young mistress of Jack's now-former boss Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise).  Drawing upon the natural charms she was blessed with, Nancy talks Jack into pulling a heist for her; two hundred grand is going to be ripe for the plucking and - best of all - the robbery victim will be none other than Ray Ritchie himself.  Now that you know the basic setup, forget all about it because things change a great deal by the time everything actually goes down.Morgan Freeman was, naturally, quite good in this film - although I don't consider The Big Bounce to be much of a feather in his cap.  Methinks my favorite actor really just wanted to spend a working vacation in Hawaii.  It seems obvious to me that Owen Wilson was the perfect choice to play Jack Ryan - I'm not saying he's a great actor, but few actors could have delivered all of his cheesy dialogue without bringing the whole production down around his feet.  Sara Foster is quite good as well (and I'm not just saying that because she was scantily-clad most of the time).  Unfortunately, the ending of the movie just isn't very satisfying - too much is left unexplained, and it just doesn't feel right.Maybe I'm just too easy to please, but I think The Big Bounce is a pretty good film for the most part - a silly little diversion that will make you laugh a few times and leave you feeling entertained (although the unsatisfying conclusion might lead you to forget the good things about the film).",4,"I actually enjoyed this movie, despite its faults",1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,3054,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'movie', 'did', 'feature', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'greatest', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'scantily-clad', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'said', 'what', 'heck', 'Actually', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Sure', 'little', 'silly', 'predictably', 'unpredictable', 'know', 'how', 'comic', 'con', 'game', 'movies', 'are', 'sometimes', 'actors', 'are', 'making', 'things', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'ending', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'hate', 'admit', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'pretty', 'darn', 'funny', 'Hawaiian', 'setting', 'gorgeous', 'shortage', 'bikini-clad', 'ladies', 'storyline', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'also', 'have', 'weird', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'celebrities', 'such', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'movie', ""'re"", 'always', 'wondering', 'what', 'famous', 'person', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'next.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'explain', 'how', 'con', 'game', 'movies', 'work', 'not', 'con', 'game', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'sent', 'way', 'recent', 'years', ""'ve"", 'got', 'con', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hidden', 'conspiracy', 'con', 'men', 'women', 'making', 'things', 'more', 'complicated', 'then', 'have', 'ending', 'off', 'direction', 'altogether', 'adequately', 'explaining', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'rather', 'typical', 'roustabout', 'who', 'made', 'way', 'Hawaii', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'involving', 'supervisor', 'head', 'baseball', 'bat', 'oddly', 'enough', 'district', 'judge', 'Walter', 'Crewes', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'job', 'not', 'long', 'hanging', 'out', 'Nancy', 'Hayes', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'young', 'mistress', 'Jack', 'now-former', 'boss', 'Ray', 'Ritchie', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Drawing', 'natural', 'charms', 'was', 'blessed', 'Nancy', 'Jack', 'pulling', 'heist', 'two', 'hundred', 'grand', 'going', 'be', 'ripe', 'plucking', 'best', 'robbery', 'victim', 'will', 'be', 'none', 'other', 'Ray', 'Ritchie', 'Now', 'know', 'basic', 'setup', 'forget', 'things', 'change', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'everything', 'actually', 'down.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'naturally', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'be', 'much', 'feather', 'cap', 'Methinks', 'favorite', 'actor', 'really', 'just', 'wanted', 'spend', 'working', 'vacation', 'Hawaii', 'obvious', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Jack', 'Ryan', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'great', 'actor', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'bringing', 'whole', 'production', 'down', 'feet', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', 'was', 'scantily-clad', 'most', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfying', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'unexplained', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right.Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'please', 'think', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'silly', 'little', 'diversion', 'will', 'make', 'few', 'times', 'leave', 'feeling', 'entertained', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', 'might', 'lead', 'forget', 'good', 'things', 'film']",The Big Bounce
824651,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00024JC30,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[3, 3]","'The Big Bounce' is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name.  Actually, it is the second attempt to do so.  The movie has moved the locale from Michigan to Hawaii and into the current day.  The movie starts off well enough with a fairly faithful adaptation of Leonard's trademark dialogue, and close attention to the novel.  However, the last third of the movie makes a radical departure.The movie tells the story of Jack Ryan (no, not Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan).  Jack is an ex-con that has mainly been involved in petty crimes.  He finds himself in Hawaii working on a construction project that is picketed by natives.  Next thing he knows, he is caught on video taking a bat to the foreman's head (he is a little more innocent than this sounds).  He gets a quick release, makes friends with the local judge, and then finds himself involved with the girlfriend of a local real estate tycoon.The movie does have its strengths.  Owen Wilson was a great choice for Jack.  He was a natural with his easy going attitude and look of innocence.  Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, which makes him good in about anything, including his role as the judge that owns a small resort property.  Freeman's character hires Jack to do odd jobs around the resort.  Gary Sinise is not in the movie enough to really evaluate his performance.  Charlie Sheen was a good choice for Sinise's lead henchman.  The character was a bit more a buffoon that Sheen usually plays, but he pulled it off well.  Sarah Foster as Nancy was a good enough choice.What doomed this movie was that it tried to adapt a novel for the big screen that really doesn't translate well.  Unlike 'Get Shorty,' 'Out of Sight,' and 'Jackie Brown,' which were great Leonard adaptations to the big screen, 'The Big Bounce' is a little light on action that would grip an audience in the theater.  What made the novel great was the dialogue and the development of the characters.  The creators of this movie did a good job with the Hawaiian scenery, use of Leonard's dialogue, and adaptation of the plot in the first half, but then they abandoned all of that in the last third.  Seriously, the move takes a left turn, and it doesn't make a lot of sense.Ultimately, I'd recommend this novel to Elmore Leonard fans.  I'm guessing the producers of the DVD weren't expecting a large demand for this DVD as they didn't bother to add a lot of extra features besides a short featurette about the cast and story, some surfing footage, and the trailer.  DVD enthusiasts will be disappointed that there are no deleted scenes or outtakes.  Its worth watching if you have seen everything else, but don't pass up some of the other great movies that are new to DVD for this.  If you really need to kill time, grab the novel instead.",3,"Leonard-esque start, mystery ending....",1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,2777,"[""'The"", 'Big', 'Bounce', 'adaptation', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Actually', 'second', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'moved', 'locale', 'Michigan', 'Hawaii', 'current', 'day', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Leonard', 'trademark', 'dialogue', 'close', 'attention', 'novel', 'However', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'radical', 'departure.The', 'movie', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'not', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Jack', 'ex-con', 'mainly', 'been', 'involved', 'petty', 'crimes', 'Hawaii', 'working', 'construction', 'project', 'picketed', 'natives', 'Next', 'thing', 'caught', 'video', 'taking', 'bat', 'foreman', 'head', 'little', 'more', 'innocent', 'quick', 'release', 'friends', 'local', 'judge', 'then', 'involved', 'girlfriend', 'local', 'real', 'estate', 'tycoon.The', 'movie', 'have', 'strengths', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'Jack', 'was', 'natural', 'easy', 'going', 'attitude', 'look', 'innocence', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'good', 'anything', 'including', 'role', 'judge', 'small', 'resort', 'property', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Jack', 'do', 'odd', 'jobs', 'resort', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'not', 'movie', 'enough', 'really', 'evaluate', 'performance', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'Sinise', 'lead', 'henchman', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'buffoon', 'Sheen', 'usually', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'Sarah', 'Foster', 'Nancy', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'choice.What', 'doomed', 'movie', 'was', 'tried', 'adapt', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'really', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', ""'Get"", 'Shorty', ""'Out"", 'Sight', 'Brown', 'were', 'great', 'Leonard', 'adaptations', 'big', 'screen', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'little', 'light', 'action', 'would', 'grip', 'audience', 'theater', 'What', 'made', 'novel', 'great', 'was', 'dialogue', 'development', 'characters', 'creators', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Hawaiian', 'scenery', 'use', 'Leonard', 'dialogue', 'adaptation', 'plot', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'abandoned', 'last', 'third', 'Seriously', 'move', 'left', 'turn', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense.Ultimately', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'novel', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'fans', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'producers', 'DVD', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'large', 'demand', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'add', 'lot', 'extra', 'features', 'short', 'featurette', 'cast', 'story', 'surfing', 'footage', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'new', 'DVD', 'really', 'need', 'kill', 'time', 'grab', 'novel', 'instead']",The Big Bounce

When it came out back in January 2004, this BIG BOUNCE's new Hawaii setting was especially welcome during that year's harsh winter season! Hell, all it took to make me love this flick was the playful rock-tinged Hawaiian-style score (though scorer George S. Clinton missed an opportunity: it would've been such a hoot to include Paul Revere & The Raiders' ""Kicks"" or a cool cover of same, in honor of TBB's thrill-seeking leads! :-), the lush tropical scenery, and the sight of Owen Wilson naked in the ocean! :-) Wilson, the king of comedic neo-slacker cool, is in his element as Jack Ryan (so not Tom Clancy's action hero! :-), an ex-con surfer dude with a penchant for getting in trouble (as he says, his ""two longtime companions"" are ""bad luck and bad choices""). Jack gets into plenty of it thanks to newcomer Sara Foster as Nancy, a sun-kissed cutie with the insouciant insolence of the young Lauren Bacall. Wilson and Foster have an easygoing, playful chemistry even when they get their kicks from stealing cars and ""B&E"" (Breaking and Entering, a popular indoor sport for movie couples earlier this year what with TBB and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND). When the stakes are raised up to murder, however, Jack has to start rethinking his laissez-faire approach to life... Wilson and Foster have a great cast to double-cross and be double-crossed by, including Morgan Freeman, Bebe Neuwirth, Gary Sinise, our fave British movie tough guy Vinnie Jones (nice change of pace, seeing him get his butt kicked for a change :-), Willie Nelson, and Charlie Sheen and Harry Dean Stanton as father and son! Add lots of snappy dialogue (I particularly liked Wilson's ""friendship"" speech to Gregory Sporleder: ""If I'm in trouble, you won't be there for me...I won't be there for you..."" It's a Bogart-style tough-guy speech given a slyly witty spin thanks to Wilson's laid-back delivery), much of it uttered over the rocks (in more ways than one -- I haven't seen so much drinking in a crime comedy since the THIN MAN movies, only the drinking impairs the characters' judgment here :-), and you've got a lighthearted, lightweight way to pass a lazy afternoon, especially if the weather is too dreary for real-life fun in the sun!",4,"Great Cast Buoys Lighthearted, Lightweight Leonard Caper",1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2566,"['Maybe', 'second', 'movie', 'version', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'caper', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'first', 'filmed', '1969', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Leigh', 'Taylor-Young', 'GET', 'SHORTY', 'OUT', 'OF', 'SIGHT', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'critics', 'gave', 'credit', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'dreary', 'original', 'sure', 'deserved', 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'January', '2004', 'BIG', 'BOUNCE', 'new', 'Hawaii', 'setting', 'was', 'especially', 'welcome', 'year', 'harsh', 'winter', 'season', 'Hell', 'took', 'make', 'love', 'flick', 'was', 'playful', 'rock-tinged', 'Hawaiian-style', 'score', 'scorer', 'George', 'S.', 'Clinton', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hoot', 'include', 'Paul', 'Revere', 'Raiders', 'Kicks', 'cool', 'cover', 'same', 'honor', 'TBB', 'thrill-seeking', 'leads', 'lush', 'tropical', 'scenery', 'sight', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'naked', 'ocean', 'Wilson', 'king', 'comedic', 'neo-slacker', 'cool', 'element', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'so', 'not', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'action', 'hero', 'ex-con', 'surfer', 'dude', 'penchant', 'getting', 'trouble', 'two', 'longtime', 'companions', 'are', 'bad', 'luck', 'bad', 'choices', 'Jack', 'plenty', 'newcomer', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'Nancy', 'sun-kissed', 'cutie', 'insouciant', 'insolence', 'young', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Wilson', 'Foster', 'have', 'easygoing', 'playful', 'chemistry', 'even', 'when', 'get', 'kicks', 'stealing', 'cars', 'B', 'E', 'Breaking', 'Entering', 'popular', 'indoor', 'sport', 'movie', 'couples', 'earlier', 'year', 'what', 'TBB', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND', 'When', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'murder', 'however', 'Jack', 'start', 'rethinking', 'laissez-faire', 'approach', 'life', 'Wilson', 'Foster', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'double-cross', 'be', 'double-crossed', 'including', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'fave', 'British', 'movie', 'tough', 'guy', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'seeing', 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'change', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'father', 'son', 'Add', 'lots', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Wilson', 'friendship', 'speech', 'Gregory', 'Sporleder', ""'m"", 'trouble', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'Bogart-style', 'tough-guy', 'speech', 'given', 'slyly', 'witty', 'spin', 'thanks', 'Wilson', 'laid-back', 'delivery', 'much', 'uttered', 'rocks', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'drinking', 'crime', 'comedy', 'THIN', 'MAN', 'movies', 'only', 'drinking', 'characters', 'judgment', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lighthearted', 'lightweight', 'way', 'pass', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'especially', 'weather', 'too', 'dreary', 'real-life', 'fun', 'sun']",The Big Bounce

824655,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B00024JC30,Isaac,"[5, 7]","Over the past number of years I have familiarized myself with the pleasant oddities of Elmore Leonard's books and the films conjured from his genius. There is a machine concealed within the mind of this man that creates characters and plots so original that you never know what you are going to get. You can read his novels with the same awe that you can watch the film adaptations. A film such as ""Get Shorty"" or ""Jackie Brown"" can arguably compare to the man's work.Those two films are rarities in the sense that they function solely on the brilliance of Leonard and the social oddballs whom he produces. All of them are interesting people. You have mobsters, drifters, crooked cops, criminals, liars, cheaters, killers, and thieves elbowing each other for screen time. He uses his characters as valuable people, not fictional pawns, and they are all necessities to the story.In the case of George Armitage's train wreck, ""The Big Bounce,"" we are deprived of the luxuries of interest and captivation that the characters are supposed to create. Instead, the film takes the bold foundation of Leonard's book and mutates it into an inferior lackluster comedy, a ballsy and unfortunate mistake. Would it be wise to point out that ""The Bourne Identity"" at least came within a mile of being as good as Robert Ludlum`s novel, even if it took the plot in an entirely different direction?The cast appears to be one that was gathered at the last minute. Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Sara Foster, and Gary Sinise, all very gifted people who made the mistake of buying into the script, carry the story with some degree of willingness. For a film to have good actors and disrespect their talents is an unfortunate case that is all-too common. ""The Big Bounce"" uses the big name actors for show and narrative hinderance, not for any productive reason.Jack Ryan (Owen Wilson) is a beach bum surfer dude who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Jack drifts around the Hawaiian Islands looking for work after being released from prison, and he is hired by a local judge, Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman), to do custodial work in and around a certain beach area. Through his unfavorable job, Jack comes across Nancy (Sara Foster), a beautiful, bikini-clad seductress who wants to run a major scam on her developer boyfriend. That would be the wealthy and powerful Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise), whose apparent ties to the mob will prove to be a challenge to her scheme.A few of the characters have hidden motives and obscure areas of reason, but the film tries to focus a bit too much on that. Instead of going ahead with their plan, Jack and Nancy tease and kid with one another in an obvious attempt to sidestep their sexual chemistry. The Freeman character stumbles around aimlessly in ignorance of the trouble that his employee is getting into. Sinise shows up only when the film is blatantly desperate for the story to continue. Charlie Sheen, who has gone unmentioned up until this point, is the puppet of the Sinise character, and his rivalry with Jack supplies an admirably humorous moment. And there is an outside player who pretty much ties everything together, however bizarre, albeit marginally brilliant, it may be.But ""The Big Bounce,"" in its feeble entirety, is a bit of a bore. The story lingers and never really engages itself, making the film seem as long as a Ridley Scott epic when it is only a brisk 88 minutes. It is a wind-up and no pitch, a clock without all of its functioning parts, the Three Stooges without Curly. Everything feels like it originated from Leonard. The movie, on the other hand, feels like it originated from a script that was written for the sole purpose of altering a story unwillingly. Whoever gave this movie a green light should not be happy with themselves. - IsaacRated PG-13; 88 minutes; Directed by George Armitage",2,The Big Bounce,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3842,"['past', 'number', 'years', 'have', 'familiarized', 'pleasant', 'oddities', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'books', 'films', 'conjured', 'genius', 'machine', 'concealed', 'mind', 'man', 'characters', 'plots', 'so', 'original', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'can', 'read', 'novels', 'same', 'awe', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'adaptations', 'film', 'such', 'Get', 'Shorty', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'can', 'arguably', 'compare', 'man', 'work.Those', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'rarities', 'sense', 'function', 'solely', 'brilliance', 'Leonard', 'social', 'oddballs', 'whom', 'are', 'interesting', 'people', 'have', 'mobsters', 'drifters', 'crooked', 'cops', 'criminals', 'liars', 'cheaters', 'killers', 'thieves', 'elbowing', 'other', 'screen', 'time', 'characters', 'valuable', 'people', 'not', 'fictional', 'pawns', 'are', 'necessities', 'story.In', 'case', 'George', 'Armitage', 'train', 'wreck', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'are', 'deprived', 'luxuries', 'interest', 'captivation', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'create', 'Instead', 'film', 'bold', 'foundation', 'Leonard', 'book', 'inferior', 'lackluster', 'comedy', 'ballsy', 'unfortunate', 'mistake', 'Would', 'be', 'wise', 'point', 'out', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'least', 'came', 'mile', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 's', 'novel', 'even', 'took', 'plot', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'cast', 'be', 'one', 'was', 'gathered', 'last', 'minute', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'very', 'gifted', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'buying', 'script', 'carry', 'story', 'degree', 'willingness', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'actors', 'disrespect', 'talents', 'unfortunate', 'case', 'all-too', 'common', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'show', 'narrative', 'hinderance', 'not', 'productive', 'reason.Jack', 'Ryan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'beach', 'bum', 'surfer', 'dude', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'trouble', 'Jack', 'drifts', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'looking', 'work', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'hired', 'local', 'judge', 'Walter', 'Crewes', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'do', 'custodial', 'work', 'certain', 'beach', 'area', 'unfavorable', 'job', 'Jack', 'Nancy', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'beautiful', 'bikini-clad', 'seductress', 'who', 'run', 'major', 'scam', 'developer', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'be', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'Ray', 'Ritchie', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'apparent', 'ties', 'mob', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'challenge', 'scheme.A', 'few', 'characters', 'have', 'hidden', 'motives', 'obscure', 'areas', 'reason', 'film', 'focus', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Instead', 'going', 'ahead', 'plan', 'Jack', 'Nancy', 'tease', 'kid', 'one', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'sidestep', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'Freeman', 'character', 'stumbles', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'ignorance', 'trouble', 'employee', 'getting', 'Sinise', 'up', 'only', 'when', 'film', 'blatantly', 'desperate', 'story', 'continue', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'who', 'gone', 'unmentioned', 'up', 'point', 'puppet', 'Sinise', 'character', 'rivalry', 'Jack', 'supplies', 'admirably', 'humorous', 'moment', 'outside', 'player', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'however', 'bizarre', 'marginally', 'brilliant', 'may', 'be.But', 'Big', 'Bounce', 'feeble', 'entirety', 'bit', 'bore', 'story', 'lingers', 'never', 'really', 'making', 'film', 'seem', 'as', 'long', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'epic', 'when', 'only', 'brisk', '88', 'minutes', 'wind-up', 'pitch', 'clock', 'functioning', 'parts', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Curly', 'Everything', 'feels', 'originated', 'Leonard', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'feels', 'originated', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'sole', 'purpose', 'altering', 'story', 'unwillingly', 'Whoever', 'gave', 'movie', 'green', 'light', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'IsaacRated', 'PG-13', '88', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'George', 'Armitage']",The Big Bounce

After attacking a co-worker with a baseball bat, Wilson is befriended by Walter (Morgan Freeman) the local judge/resort owner who offers Jack a job instead of sending him to jail.  Jack eventually meets Nancy (Sara Foster) who is having an affair with Jack's rich, former boss Ray (Gary Sinise).  Jack and Nancy plan to steal money from Ray's cabin and this forms the ""plot"" of the movie.I guess that this is supposed to be a ""heist"" movie, but most of the movie does not really focus around the heist much at all.  Instead, Jack and Nancy dance around and have a stupid flittery romance for most of the scenes.  Jack and Nancy's plan is never completely fleshed out and seems rather simplistic.  I can say that there are some suprizes when the actually get around to stealing the money, but the suprises are somewhat predictable and not really that inovative.I agree with other viewers who say that the actors in this movie are wasted on shallow characters.  There is nothing stellar about Wilson's character and Foster's character is little more than eye candy.  Freeman, Charlie Sheen, and Gary Sinse (who only has a few lines in the movie) should have been better.In terms of heist movies, this one falls far short.  If you want a good heist movie, see The Italian Job.  Even National Treasure has a pretty good heist scene.

Zwick,"[20, 27]","Why anyone would have thought it was a good idea to remake ""The Big Bounce,"" an utterly unmemorable 1969 caper comedy (based on an Elroy Leonard novel), is a complete mystery to me.  Owen Wilson takes over the role of Jack Ryan (originally played by Ryan O'Neal), a petty crook who has some issues with his ex-boss, Ray Ritchie, a corrupt real estate developer in Hawaii.  Hooking up with Ritchie's bombshell mistress, Ryan comes up with a scheme to rob the big man of a couple hundred thousand dollars.  Ryan is also befriended by an anti-Ritchie judge named Walter Crewes, for reasons that make almost no sense at all until the closing moments.  As in all films of this type, Ryan soon learns that people are not always what they appear to be and that the conning game can work both ways.  Actually, if the truth be told, Ryan is remarkably stupid for a con man.The pacing of this film is almost shockingly bad.  The story plods along for a good hour or so before the inevitable plot twists begin to kick in.  Then, when they finally arrive, they are so poorly worked out and explained that you will probably be scratching your head wondering what it was that just happened - if you still care that is.  The attitude on the part of both the filmmakers and the actors is so lackadaisical and indifferent that the film is really an insult to the audience who is paying good money to sit through this mess.  In addition to Wilson, the film wastes the considerable talents of Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Willie Nelson, Harry Dean Stanton, Sara Foster and Gary Sinise, among others, all of whom at least got a trip to Hawaii out of the deal.

It's short to begin with (88 minutes including credits), and after being very patient it was frustrating that there was no real payoff.Don't get me wrong, the movie has sort of an easy-going charm.  A little too easy-going, to be blatantly honest.  For a movie about con men pulling various scams, the movie just didn't have a lot of energy.  The cast can't be faulted, plenty of A-list talent.  Most of the movie rests on Owen Wilson, who is more or less typecast here, and newcomer Sara Foster, who is stunningly attractive but rather bland as an actress.  The movie could've benefited from a little steam, but either Foster had a no-nudity clause or the producers didn't want to go beyond a PG-13 rating for some reason.  In supporting roles, great actors like Morgan Freeman and Gary Sinise have very little to do in underwritten roles.The movie is easy on the eyes, lots of great cinematography featuring the natural beauty of Hawaii.  The cast is game, even when working with very little.  There are a few off-handed laughs sprinkled throughout.  And for two-thirds of the running time, I was fairly certain that things would come together with some nice twists and a satisfying conclusion.  The satisfaction never really occurred, and the movie faded from memory not long after it was over.The dvd looks and sounds great (some cool tunes on the soundtrack, sounding great in the 5.1 mix).  I realize the movie was a bomb at the box office, but even so a little more effort could've been put into the supplemental features.  Here's what we get:  a 12 minute promotional featurette (standard mix of movie clips, cast interviews, behind-the-scenes snippets), a 3 minute mini-featurette about the surfing segments (a very minor part of the movie), and 7 minutes of surf footage outtakes (with surfing being such a sidenote in the movie, I guess they wanted to get some use out of this footage!).",2,Never catches fire,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1985,"['one-hour', 'mark', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'short', 'begin', '88', 'minutes', 'including', 'credits', 'being', 'very', 'patient', 'was', 'frustrating', 'was', 'real', 'payoff.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'sort', 'easy-going', 'charm', 'little', 'too', 'easy-going', 'be', 'blatantly', 'honest', 'movie', 'con', 'men', 'pulling', 'various', 'scams', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'energy', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'plenty', 'A-list', 'talent', 'Most', 'movie', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'more', 'less', 'typecast', 'here', 'newcomer', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'who', 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'rather', 'bland', 'actress', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'little', 'steam', 'either', 'Foster', 'had', 'no-nudity', 'clause', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'reason', 'supporting', 'roles', 'great', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'underwritten', 'roles.The', 'movie', 'easy', 'eyes', 'lots', 'great', 'cinematography', 'featuring', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Hawaii', 'cast', 'game', 'even', 'when', 'working', 'very', 'little', 'are', 'few', 'off-handed', 'laughs', 'sprinkled', 'two-thirds', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'fairly', 'certain', 'things', 'would', 'come', 'together', 'nice', 'twists', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'satisfaction', 'never', 'really', 'occurred', 'movie', 'faded', 'memory', 'not', 'long', 'was', 'over.The', 'dvd', 'looks', 'great', 'cool', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'sounding', 'great', '5.1', 'mix', 'realize', 'movie', 'was', 'bomb', 'box', 'office', 'even', 'so', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'put', 'supplemental', 'features', 'Here', 'what', 'get', '12', 'minute', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'standard', 'mix', 'movie', 'clips', 'cast', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'snippets', '3', 'minute', 'mini-featurette', 'surfing', 'segments', 'very', 'minor', 'part', 'movie', '7', 'minutes', 'surf', 'footage', 'outtakes', 'surfing', 'being', 'such', 'sidenote', 'movie', 'guess', 'wanted', 'get', 'use', 'footage']",The Big Bounce
824667,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00024JC30,Tom Benton,"[1, 2]","There is a rule that is generally accepted: an Elmore Leonard book is magnificent; an Elmore Leonard film is not.  There are a few notable exceptions to the rule - OUT OF SIGHT, JACKIE BROWN, GET SHORTY - but for the most part, film adaptations of Leonard's novels are pretty weak.  One such example is 2004's THE BIG BOUNCE, the second attempt at adapting Leonard's novel.Owen Wilson stars as Jack Ryan, a small-time con artist who was recently fired from his job after dislocating his employer's jaw with a baseball bat.  After a series of chance encounters, he falls for the mysterious Nancy Hayes (Sara Foster), who tells him about her fool-proof plan to steal $200,000 from her rich ""boyfriend"", Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise).  Things may not be as they seem, but Jack has too many other things on his mind to worry about that, like his wise new boss (Morgan Freeman), his stand-offish old boss Bob Jr. (Charlie Sheen), and his angry  ex-supervisor (Vinnie Jones).THE BIG BOUNCE, despite the all-star cast, is not a good movie.  Sebastian Gutierrez's script is rather weak, particularly during the non-sensical closing.  The acting is less than superb, although Freeman is good (as always).  George Armitage is not as talented a director as previous Leonard adaptators Quentin Tarantino or Steven Soderbergh, and thus THE BIG BOUNCE fails as both a comedy and, more so, as a crime caper.That said, the film is rather entertaining.  Why?  I don't know.  It has its moments - once when Owen Wilson answers a stolen cell phone, and once when he engages in a furious fight with Sheen - but for the most part, it's not funny.  During some scene transistions, we are shown surfers crashing into the ocean.  It's meant to be funny, but it's not.  At all.  And yet the film is still entertaining.

824668,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00024JC30,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","This is the second film version of Elmore Leonard's 'The Big Bounce' published in 1969.  In the same year, they made a film starring Ryan O'Neal, which Elmore Leonard, himself a great film buff, didn't like.  Now, for the newer version, Hollywood  assembled very impressive cast, plus the director George Armitage, who did a pretty good job in 'Grosse Pointe Blank.'  SO ... what happened to this newer film, which is so thin in contents?Not everything is bad, and the star Owen Wilson is not to be blamed.  He plays a very likable small-time thief Jack Ryan, who fell for a gorgeous girl Nancy in Hawaii.  Nancy (played by newcomer Sara Foster) is game for fun, and petty crimes too, but this time the stake is high.  She encourages Jack to steal $200,000 hidden in the house of one rich guy Ray, with whom she is having an affair.  The story is a typical Elmore Leonard.See this great cast.  In addition to Wilson and Foster, you get Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Charlie Sheen, Vinnie Jones, Bebe Neuwirth, Willie Nelson, and Harry Dean Stanton.  The film is entirely shot on location in beautiful Hawaii, so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes.And ... what a thin story!  The main story is too cursorily told to interest us, and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot, which gets lost among the pointless set-pieces.  One example.  Vinnie Jones plays a hot-tempered supervisor of a construction site.  In the middle part of the film, he terrorizes Wilson and Freeman, riding a RV.  The scene happens and ends suddenly, out of the context of the film.  The motives of characters, or the relations between them, often lack enough explanation, leaving us wonder 'who is he, anyway?'I do not know Elmore Leonard's personal reaction to this film.  He must have seen it already, and most probably he didn't like it.  Very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of Leonard's -- good dialogues and unpredictable story -- but you need an ear of Tarantino to make his great books into equally great films.",2,"Great Elmore Leonard, Great Cast, and Very Thin Story",1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,2078,"['second', 'film', 'version', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', ""'The"", 'Big', 'Bounce', 'published', '1969', 'same', 'year', 'made', 'film', 'starring', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'great', 'film', 'buff', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Now', 'newer', 'version', 'Hollywood', 'assembled', 'very', 'impressive', 'cast', 'director', 'George', 'Armitage', 'who', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', ""'Grosse"", 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'SO', 'what', 'happened', 'newer', 'film', 'so', 'thin', 'contents', 'Not', 'everything', 'bad', 'star', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'very', 'likable', 'small-time', 'thief', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'who', 'fell', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'Nancy', 'Hawaii', 'Nancy', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Sara', 'Foster', 'game', 'fun', 'petty', 'crimes', 'too', 'time', 'stake', 'high', 'Jack', 'steal', '200,000', 'hidden', 'house', 'one', 'rich', 'guy', 'Ray', 'whom', 'having', 'affair', 'story', 'typical', 'Elmore', 'Leonard.See', 'great', 'cast', 'addition', 'Wilson', 'Foster', 'get', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'film', 'entirely', 'shot', 'location', 'beautiful', 'Hawaii', 'can', 'enjoy', 'blue', 'sea', 'landscapes.And', 'what', 'thin', 'story', 'main', 'story', 'too', 'cursorily', 'told', 'interest', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'performances', 'talented', 'actors', 'are', 'sadly', 'thrown', 'away', 'weak', 'plot', 'lost', 'pointless', 'set-pieces', 'One', 'example', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'hot-tempered', 'supervisor', 'construction', 'site', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'Wilson', 'Freeman', 'riding', 'RV', 'scene', 'suddenly', 'context', 'film', 'motives', 'characters', 'relations', 'often', 'lack', 'enough', 'explanation', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'anyway', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'personal', 'reaction', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'already', 'most', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'Very', 'sporadically', 'film', 'unmistakable', 'touch', 'Leonard', 'good', 'dialogues', 'unpredictable', 'story', 'need', 'ear', 'Tarantino', 'make', 'great', 'books', 'equally', 'great', 'films']",The Big Bounce

824671,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B00024JC30,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[0, 0]","Elmore Leonard's THE BIG BOUNCE is more of a travelogue movie or a commercial for Hawaii's travel bureau than a crime caper. It also seems to be a music video as sometimes the music gets in the way of the story instead of enhancing it (JET's ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" is an excellent rocker). The cast is impressive, but the film seems lightweight and unmemorable. There are some twists and turns to all the miscreant, but something is lacking.  Lead Owen Wilson's Jack Ryan is pathetic and hard to root for. Maybe that is one of the problems with the film (who wants to root a professional thief in the first place). Sara Foster as Nancy is not too distracting of eye candy as the lead femme fatale.  Maybe that is part of the problem also, we want her to be distracting but she comes off as another face in the crowd of beach bunnies. The film is slightly interesting because of the presence of Morgan Freeman in a somewhat phone-in performance and Bebe Neuwirth is always good in everything she does. This means that the support cast is more interesting than the leads.  The caper lacks any energy as with the characters in the film.
