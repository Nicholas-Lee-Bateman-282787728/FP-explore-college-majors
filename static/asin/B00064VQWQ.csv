If you're wanting to work out to try to get toned, #2 is great. I felt this all day and the next. There are a lot of isometrics. I would recommend this singular video hands down. The rest of them... eh. They were ok. I have been using Turbo Jam for my aerobics, and I was looking for a set of dvds with the same uptempo workout to substitute for the days I want a change.

860658,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B00064VQWQ,Basbenee,"[4, 5]","This is a great dvd. I got it for Xmas, and am totally impressed with this product. Carmen and her producers have put together a smart, well-crafted, fun workout. She has a great warmup, and you can do it with her instructions, or you can just follow along. There are two more routines, each with the option of having Carmen walk you through it, or you can just go along with the music. The music is customized, too, where you can choose to dance/workout to techno, hip-hop or rock. So it's been well thought out to offer variety. Carmen explains the moves well, gives you a chance to try them a couple of times with her, and then you work through the routine. The third routine is the most complex, with leads into floor work, and definitely takes more strength to do, so some may need to build to it, but she even tells you how to get down on the the floor and back up to standing without looking like a dork. The whole premise could be totally sleazy or totally corny, but it's handled well. Carmen tells you to loosen up a bit and enjoy the dancing and being sexy, but she approaches it with a sense of humor, like she knows some people are going to feel a  little goofy when instructed to smack their butt or whatever. But the moves are good, some are a bit reminiscent of bellydance (undulations, punching hips side to side, but with more attitude). But it's fun, very well done,  and I like all the options she offers, including in her intro telling you what her other dvds focus on (role playing, etc). It's fun and sassy, and you're working your whole body and it you're not staring at the clock waiting for it to end already. A great buy. More videos should be this well thought out and this fun to do.

860659,A13X76X3HOBJK9,B00064VQWQ,Blandy,"[2, 2]","DVD 1 says Aerobic Strip Tease but it is really anything but. It is more like strip tease basics. I bought this to get a great workout but also have fun doing it. Fun it may be but no where near a good workout. It is basically a few simple dances and a little warm-up.If you are new to fitness then this may be a enough to raise that heart rate a tad and get you use to moving. Also if you are looking for a way to spice up your marriage a little and decide to do a little saucy novice strip tease for the husband then this would be helpful but other than that I find this trivial.So to sum it up-Wanna learn how to get off your knees in a sexy way? Then here you go. If you are looking for a a heart pumping dance workout, look elsewhere because this is not it!As for DVD 2 (Fit to Strip) I like it a lot better. It is a decent strength training workout that requires nothing more than a chair and a yoga mat. This one has nothing to do with stripping or dancing. It is just toning and strength training. It is a total body routine but customizable. You can choose if you just want to do arms, legs or abs. Michael Carson is wonderful at explaining and demonstrating the moves in a friendly and simply way. Carmen really don't have much to do with this one other than acting like a cast and putting in little tid bits of dialogue. I recommend this to anyone that is trying to lose weight. It may not be aerobic but it will help prevent that flab from dropping the weight and make you feel stronger so it is easier to get through all that cardio from other workouts.",3,Not Exactly a Workout,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,1566,"['DVD', '1', 'Aerobic', 'Strip', 'Tease', 'really', 'anything', 'more', 'strip', 'tease', 'basics', 'bought', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'also', 'have', 'fun', 'doing', 'may', 'be', 'where', 'good', 'workout', 'basically', 'few', 'simple', 'dances', 'little', 'warm-up.If', 'are', 'new', 'fitness', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'tad', 'get', 'use', 'moving', 'Also', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'spice', 'up', 'marriage', 'little', 'decide', 'do', 'little', 'saucy', 'novice', 'strip', 'tease', 'husband', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'other', 'find', 'trivial.So', 'sum', 'up-', 'Wan', 'na', 'learn', 'how', 'get', 'off', 'knees', 'sexy', 'way', 'Then', 'here', 'go', 'are', 'looking', 'heart', 'pumping', 'dance', 'workout', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'DVD', '2', 'Fit', 'Strip', 'like', 'lot', 'better', 'decent', 'strength', 'training', 'workout', 'nothing', 'more', 'chair', 'yoga', 'mat', 'one', 'nothing', 'do', 'stripping', 'dancing', 'just', 'toning', 'strength', 'training', 'total', 'body', 'routine', 'customizable', 'can', 'choose', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'Michael', 'Carson', 'wonderful', 'explaining', 'demonstrating', 'moves', 'friendly', 'simply', 'way', 'Carmen', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'one', 'other', 'acting', 'cast', 'putting', 'little', 'tid', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'trying', 'lose', 'weight', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aerobic', 'will', 'help', 'prevent', 'flab', 'dropping', 'weight', 'make', 'feel', 'stronger', 'easier', 'get', 'cardio', 'other', 'workouts']",N/A
860660,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B00064VQWQ,C. Daly,"[124, 137]","The title of this DVD makes it sound like it's something really advanced (and aerobic).  But actually the first two DVDs in Carmen's set are much more physically challenging than this one.  This DVD is kind of a cheesy joke.  It consists of two 10 minute strip routines which require dressing up.  The first one is a ""sexy librarian.""  To do the routine as Carmen demonstrates you need some glasses and a scarf.  The next routine is wearing men's clothing--a big button shirt, a tie, and a really stupid hat.  Taking these items off is an integral part of the routine, although there is no actual nudity involved.The routines are too slow and short to actually count as aerobic.  So this DVD is useful for one thing...learning some strip routines to act out for your significant other.

860661,A37E6RW5BUX4U0,B00064VQWQ,Cherise Everhard,"[5, 6]","I received this DVD as a gag gift for Christmas one year.  I recently became bored with my normal workout DVD's and decided to give it a go.I think Carmen was stretching things a bit when she named this DVD AEROBIC Striptease.There are two short 'routines'.  In the first one you dress like a librarian. Carmen has on stilettos, business suit, scarf, glasses and her hair is up.  She takes you through a small dance where you lose the glasses, scarf and the hair comes down.  It was a little too brief for me and a little dull.The second one was a lap dance.  This one was a little more fun.  The idea is to be dressed in your lovers dress shirt, tie and hat along with your stilettos.  The routine takes you through a small lap dance involving a chair.  Your supposed to do everything like someone is sitting there.  You do a little dance in front of the chair, and remove the tie.  A little bump and grind on the lap of your imaginary partner and you remove the shirt.I have to admit I got a kick out of working out in the stilettos.  It was a little fun.  As far as a work out, I did both routines and barely elevated my heart beat.Rating the sexiness of these routines on a scale of 1-10, I would say the librarian gig would rate a 4 and the lap dance, maybe a 6. The stripper routines are 'cute' and a little sexy.  You'll have to add a little more spice if you're looking to heat things up at home.The music in the DVD was better than I thought it would be, but still not that great.  It had an OK beat, but that's all it had going for it.  I've heard many songs that sound to me like stripper music. This one song in the DVD, did not.If you're looking to lose weight, this is not the DVD for you.It's better than not doing any work out at all, and if you repeat the routines later that evening for a one-man audience, then I guess you'll burn a few more calories. ;)",2,You can leave your hat on...,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,1873,"['received', 'DVD', 'gag', 'gift', 'Christmas', 'one', 'year', 'recently', 'became', 'bored', 'normal', 'workout', 'DVD', 'decided', 'give', 'go.I', 'think', 'Carmen', 'was', 'stretching', 'things', 'bit', 'when', 'named', 'DVD', 'AEROBIC', 'Striptease.There', 'are', 'two', 'short', ""'routines"", 'first', 'one', 'dress', 'librarian', 'Carmen', 'stilettos', 'business', 'suit', 'scarf', 'glasses', 'hair', 'up', 'small', 'dance', 'where', 'lose', 'glasses', 'scarf', 'hair', 'down', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'brief', 'little', 'dull.The', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'lap', 'dance', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'idea', 'be', 'dressed', 'lovers', 'dress', 'shirt', 'tie', 'hat', 'stilettos', 'routine', 'small', 'lap', 'dance', 'involving', 'chair', 'supposed', 'do', 'everything', 'someone', 'sitting', 'there', 'do', 'little', 'dance', 'front', 'chair', 'remove', 'tie', 'little', 'bump', 'grind', 'lap', 'imaginary', 'partner', 'remove', 'shirt.I', 'have', 'admit', 'got', 'kick', 'working', 'out', 'stilettos', 'was', 'little', 'fun', 'As', 'far', 'work', 'did', 'routines', 'barely', 'elevated', 'heart', 'beat.Rating', 'sexiness', 'routines', 'scale', '1-10', 'would', 'say', 'librarian', 'gig', 'would', 'rate', '4', 'lap', 'dance', 'maybe', '6', 'stripper', 'routines', 'are', ""'cute"", 'little', 'sexy', ""'ll"", 'have', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'spice', ""'re"", 'looking', 'heat', 'things', 'up', 'home.The', 'music', 'DVD', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'not', 'great', 'had', 'OK', 'beat', 'had', 'going', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'songs', 'sound', 'stripper', 'music', 'one', 'song', 'DVD', 'did', 'not.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'lose', 'weight', 'not', 'DVD', 'you.It', 'better', 'not', 'doing', 'work', 'out', 'repeat', 'routines', 'later', 'evening', 'one-man', 'audience', 'then', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'few', 'more', 'calories']",N/A

Some years, I'm more successful than others, of course. Usually, I've either walked or done Denise Austin's 7:00AM workout.This year, I'm trying something different.About a month ago, my mom (yes, my mom) bought me this DVD. I'd been joking about it, but was a little daunted by it. I mean, Carmen Elektra's a total babe, and I'm not terribly confident.Needless to say, I've been doing the first couple of routines for a few days, now. And, it's so much fun! Who knew, right? Carmen is very accessible - it's less like a celebrity, more like a good friend showing you how to have a little fun. The dances are cute, not slutty. There's nothing on this DVD that you couldn't playfully show your friends, and nothing that won't make you feel better in the bedroom. Of course, you may want to practice and watch yourself in a mirror to ensure that you're being sexy, and not... well... flailing. :)The routines are very simple, and are practiced piece by piece with and without instruction and music. There are also two other dancers that you can watch, instead of Carmen. And, what's fun about it, besides the dance is that, every time Carmen begins to take herself a little too seriously, she cracks up. :) It's really a great DVD, and I plan on collecting the entire set.Truthfully, though, it's not that great of a workout. If you really put yourself into it, you can work up a sweat. But, I think the point is that you're working up a sweat after the dance. ;)I highly recommend the DVD, and encourage you gals (and guys, why not) to try it! A strip tease DVD doesn't mean you have to do it for anyone, and it doesn't mean you're a slut. It means you're an open-minded woman having a little bit of fun. It makes you feel sexy, confident, and maybe like you've got a naughty little secret.

I love Carmen Electra.  I bought them all, hoping to learn a few moves while getting some exercise.  Basically, the rest in the series are garbage.  They are not going to help get you in shape, and I didn't use any of them more than a couple of times.Disc 2, however, I have used for years.  Carmen does the whole thing with fitness trainer, Michael Carson.  He is very informative and the exercises are great for women looking to get in better shape without doing something ridiculously hard like P90X.  There is the basic overall aerobics, and then you can also do the scenes that are meant for certain parts of your body.  Doing all of it takes about 50 minutes.  If you can't find the energy to do it all at first, just start with the basic workout.The both of them really make a great team and are fun to watch.  Carmen is just a down-to-earth looking girl who is a little lost on what to do.

I think Carmen Electra is great, and this is a cute dvd, so the only reason why I am giving it three stars is because it's supposed to be a WORKOUT dvd.  First of all, there are really only two striptease routines (the second one has a little floorwork), because the first one is the dancer's warmup (which is like 8-counts of neck stretching and stuff).  The last routine looked like it worked some muscles with the floorwork, though.  But overall, Carmen and her two accomplices weren't sweating at ALL (in their little short shorts and knee high socks), and I don't think I will either.  I'll say more when I get my ""workout"" on.  ***So I did the workout, and I must say I didn't sweat at all and felt like I would have toned my legs more by walking around the mall.  I mean, it's a cute little dancy thing to do, especially if you need to feel sexier, but you definitely won't lose weight or tone up by doing this.

The first DVD in the series is fun and effective. I have been exercizing for 10yrs now on a daily basis, and truth be told, things that I haven't worked in a while are being worked. My usual routine consist of: Tae bo, waits, DDR, running, and resistance training. However, I was missing something in my regular workout routine that this DVD filled.I've only done the first two DVD's so far, and I can definitely vouch for both of them being extremely exffective, as my body toned up and trimmed down within the first three days I used the DVD's. My arms are slimmer, my abs tighter, my thighs trimmer, and my butt firmer. I'm also gaining flexibility back in when I thought I'd never get it back.If I had to say something negative about this DVD, it would probably be that Carmen as an instructer is encouraging, but not all that informative. She seems slightly, well, empty-headed. Other than that though, I really have no complaints, the routines are fun, cute, and easy to learn. At the same time, they really do firm you up.

I'm working on making the abs section more difficult for myself because I don't usually feel sore in the midsection the next day. I supplement this with other cardio routines because there are only about 5-6 minutes of cardio at the beginning. The arms portion could be more difficult, but I sometimes add my own weights to get better results. I'm very happy with Michael's explanations of the exercises, and all of the moves are very safe.

D Haynie ""girlranger""","[8, 9]","If you're hoping to get in shape for your swimsuit--or for your lingerie--this dvd could be an integral part of your workout routine. I recommend doing the workout in this dvd (takes about 55 minutes if you do them all) five days a week and then do the weight training routines from QuickFix TotalMix.  There are a few reasons why.First of all, you just have to do cardio to lose weight.  The Carmen Electra dvd does a good bit of cardio, but I recommend pausing the dvd after the ballerina squats to do one more set of each, and then pausing again with the squat/leg lift combo to do another rep just so you get enough cardio.  You've got to get your heart rate up!  If you do this five days a week, combined with the weight training, you should lose about a pound a week (without even changing your diet...Of course, if you do change your diet you may shed pounds faster).For the weight training, do those three times a week.  Lifting weights rules because muscle mass burns calories more efficiently.  Honestly, you just sit, or sleep, and those muscles use up the caloric energy.  It's just not fair!  Fat sits there and jiggles but muscles work even when you don't.  It's like a self-perpetuating thing.Anyways.

860697,A2T33U7BJ2517Z,B00064VQWQ,"TNTSafari ""TNT""","[6, 6]","The title of this DVD doesn't lie. You learn strippers' moves, which happens to provide a good workout in the process. And like Carmen says, if you're doing it right, then it's hard work. If you play the DVD in its entirety, you'll be working out for about 55 minutes. And even if you just play one of the programmed selections that run through each segment quickly, you'll still get a compact workout (about 15 minutes) that warms you up & gets your body moving. One of the great features of the DVD is that all 3 routines are broken down, depending on time restraints and/or personal preference (with instruction vs. performing the routines straight through just to music). The 1st routine is more like a proper warm up for the 2nd two. And you're definitely working out your body: your stretching, your working your core when doing moves like body rolls, and your working your legs, hips, & butt. Overall, it's just a really fun way to exercise.

You can also choose between three different kinds of music throughout the workout: rock, house & hip/hop.What I hate most is when she is teaching nice & slow with a lot of talking, there is only soft almost elevator-like music to keep you inspiried & makes it feel more slow. The whole workout, she teaches first with alot of talking with soft, boring music at half speed 2-3x, then normal speed 2-3x more. THEN there's good music & you following along normal tempo with NO talking at all & that's repeated several times. Each time you learn new moves when the music comes on, you do all the previous moves as well, building to a routine. There are two very short routines.The warm-up itself is great & long & extensive. The pace is slow w/o music, but great for building endurance for anyone who isn't in althletic shape. You'll definitely feel stretched out & already muscle use. She talks a lot about theory as well as warning about injury from moving incorrectly & describing how to move including analogies. Then it's repeated with music & no instruction at all, just mimic by watching & memory of what you were taught.The workout she teaches a few moves at a time, teaching in the usual 8-count dancer style with very good cues & instruction, almost perfect. Almost everyone should have no trouble understanding/following the moves. The movies themselves get me.... It's actually very fast, almost the same style you'd see on any music video or music commercial with a few butt slaps, a finger in the mouth & on your back with legs crossing added in. There's only a few mooves on the floor.You definitely will get a decent toning workout especially by doing the moves & make it seem like you're graceful & light as a father though holding all your weight as you dip in a squat many times or on your back holding your weight on your arms, etc. Becasue of the pace being slow, fast, slow, fast... not as much as a cardio workout unless once you master you just do it w/o instruction normal speed for the whole workout or even repeat it.One I like as well is Jeff Costa's Cardio Strip Tease.",4,"Fun/good teaching, decent workout, slow pace & short content",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,2264,"['bought', 'several', 'months', 'only', 'did', '2x.The', 'menu', 'options', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'many', 'chapters', 'choose', 'can', 'either', 'choose', 'instruction', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'three', 'different', 'kinds', 'music', 'workout', 'rock', 'house', 'hip/hop.What', 'hate', 'most', 'when', 'teaching', 'nice', 'slow', 'lot', 'talking', 'only', 'soft', 'almost', 'elevator-like', 'music', 'keep', 'inspiried', 'feel', 'more', 'slow', 'whole', 'workout', 'first', 'alot', 'talking', 'soft', 'boring', 'music', 'half', 'speed', '2-3x', 'then', 'normal', 'speed', '2-3x', 'more', 'THEN', 'good', 'music', 'following', 'normal', 'tempo', 'NO', 'talking', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'learn', 'new', 'moves', 'when', 'music', 'do', 'previous', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'building', 'routine', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'short', 'routines.The', 'warm-up', 'great', 'long', 'extensive', 'pace', 'slow', 'w/o', 'music', 'great', 'building', 'endurance', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'althletic', 'shape', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'feel', 'stretched', 'out', 'already', 'muscle', 'use', 'lot', 'about', 'theory', 'as', 'well', 'warning', 'injury', 'moving', 'incorrectly', 'describing', 'how', 'move', 'including', 'analogies', 'Then', 'repeated', 'music', 'instruction', 'just', 'mimic', 'watching', 'memory', 'what', 'were', 'taught.The', 'few', 'moves', 'time', 'teaching', 'usual', '8-count', 'dancer', 'style', 'very', 'good', 'cues', 'instruction', 'almost', 'perfect', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding/following', 'moves', 'movies', 'get', 'actually', 'very', 'fast', 'almost', 'same', 'style', ""'d"", 'see', 'music', 'video', 'music', 'commercial', 'few', 'butt', 'slaps', 'finger', 'mouth', 'back', 'legs', 'crossing', 'added', 'only', 'few', 'mooves', 'floor.You', 'definitely', 'will', 'get', 'decent', 'toning', 'workout', 'especially', 'doing', 'moves', 'make', 'seem', ""'re"", 'graceful', 'light', 'father', 'holding', 'weight', 'dip', 'squat', 'many', 'times', 'back', 'holding', 'weight', 'arms', 'etc', 'Becasue', 'pace', 'being', 'slow', 'fast', 'slow', 'fast', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'cardio', 'workout', 'once', 'master', 'just', 'do', 'w/o', 'instruction', 'normal', 'speed', 'whole', 'workout', 'even', 'repeat', 'it.One', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'Jeff', 'Costa', 'Cardio', 'Strip', 'Tease']",N/A
