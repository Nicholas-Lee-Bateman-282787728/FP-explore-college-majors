I am extreemly careful about anything that would bring the Jewish people and the nation of Israel into disrepute or partake of anything that even resembles anti Semitism - there was something about this movie that intrigued me, I am so glad it did. This movie will move you, its ending is something that the viewer would never expect and without spoiling it for anyone, make sure that anyone prone to expressions of tearful emotions has a generous supply of tissues handy. In saying that, it is a movie that either gender can watch and very much enjoy; the acting is well above par with no well 'Known' actors involved and those in it do an excellent job. Shot on location in the Middle East they story highlights the misery that both sides of the conflict endure - though I am unashamedly pro-Israeli, I do not deny the suffering that the Arab peoples of this land suffer and this movie fairly and accuratly converys the suffering that both sides experience. This is not so much a 'them' and 'us' conflict story parse that we often see on the TV news most nights, even though that is what is indicated on the DVD cover, it is at a completly different level. It is a movie that the Directors and Producers have managed to avoid the common rhetoric of this most painful conflict and remind us that it is the individuals that count, not the politics, and how the most brutal of wars or conflicts cannot keep the most tender of hearts apart, even when they come from opposite sides of the spectrum.",5,What A Wonderful Movie,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1720,"['Please', 'read', 'review', 'not', 'stop', 'end', 'first', 'two', 'sentances', 'disagree', 'support', 'Israel', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'shy', 'buying', 'movie', 'believe', 'cause', 'Israel', 'divine', 'right', 'exist', 'am', 'extreemly', 'careful', 'anything', 'would', 'bring', 'Jewish', 'people', 'nation', 'Israel', 'disrepute', 'partake', 'anything', 'even', 'anti', 'Semitism', 'was', 'something', 'movie', 'intrigued', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'ending', 'something', 'viewer', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'spoiling', 'anyone', 'make', 'sure', 'anyone', 'prone', 'expressions', 'tearful', 'emotions', 'generous', 'supply', 'tissues', 'handy', 'saying', 'movie', 'gender', 'can', 'watch', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'well', 'par', 'well', 'actors', 'involved', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'Shot', 'location', 'Middle', 'East', 'story', 'highlights', 'misery', 'sides', 'conflict', 'endure', 'am', 'unashamedly', 'pro-Israeli', 'do', 'not', 'deny', 'suffering', 'Arab', 'peoples', 'land', 'suffer', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accuratly', 'converys', 'suffering', 'sides', 'experience', 'not', 'so', 'much', ""'them"", ""'us"", 'conflict', 'story', 'parse', 'often', 'see', 'TV', 'news', 'most', 'nights', 'even', 'what', 'indicated', 'DVD', 'cover', 'completly', 'different', 'level', 'movie', 'Directors', 'Producers', 'have', 'managed', 'avoid', 'common', 'rhetoric', 'most', 'painful', 'conflict', 'remind', 'individuals', 'count', 'not', 'politics', 'how', 'most', 'brutal', 'wars', 'conflicts', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'most', 'tender', 'hearts', 'apart', 'even', 'when', 'come', 'opposite', 'sides', 'spectrum']",N/A

1368008,A1CHM200OEN65X,B003VZ8I50,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[4, 5]","My wife and I have traveled in Israel and the West Bank, and so the cover and topic of this film caught our interest while perusing options at the local Redbox. We sat down to watch it, unsure what to expect.Shot entirely in Israel, ""Language of the Enemy"" is ambitious and has a lot to offer. Romi, a Jewish man living in Boston, returns to Israel after three years when his father is killed in a bus bombing incident there. Soon, he is recruited to go undercover in Ramallah, using his knowledge of Arabic to help track down his father's killers. Complications arise when he meets a beautiful, single nurse, a woman named Joleh. She is Muslim, albeit a fairly liberal one. He is Jewish, though not a very good one in his own mind. They are sworn enemies, and yet their attraction is immediate, leading to life-altering choices for both of them.""Language of the Enemy"" moves from political thriller to romantic comedy to social commentary. It touches on religious and ethnic issues, showing honor to all concerned, while never whitewashing either side's faults. The script walks that line with surprising agility, although the romantic aspects get over-dramatized at a few points, with sweeping music and one or two sappy lines. Overall, though, the acting is strong, the action scenes tense, and the humor warm and welcome. Despite its faults, it's a thought-provoking film, capable of providing entertainment while also tugging on hearts and expanding minds. This is a ""Language . . ."" that should be discovered by many.",4,A Language Worth Discovering,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1523,"['wife', 'have', 'traveled', 'Israel', 'West', 'Bank', 'so', 'cover', 'topic', 'film', 'caught', 'interest', 'perusing', 'options', 'local', 'Redbox', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'what', 'expect.Shot', 'entirely', 'Israel', 'Language', 'Enemy', 'ambitious', 'lot', 'offer', 'Romi', 'Jewish', 'man', 'living', 'Boston', 'Israel', 'three', 'years', 'when', 'father', 'killed', 'bus', 'bombing', 'incident', 'there', 'Soon', 'recruited', 'go', 'undercover', 'Ramallah', 'using', 'knowledge', 'Arabic', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'father', 'killers', 'Complications', 'arise', 'when', 'beautiful', 'single', 'nurse', 'woman', 'named', 'Joleh', 'Muslim', 'fairly', 'liberal', 'one', 'Jewish', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'own', 'mind', 'are', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'yet', 'attraction', 'immediate', 'leading', 'life-altering', 'choices', 'Language', 'Enemy', 'moves', 'political', 'thriller', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'issues', 'showing', 'honor', 'concerned', 'never', 'whitewashing', 'side', 'faults', 'script', 'line', 'surprising', 'agility', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'get', 'over-dramatized', 'few', 'points', 'sweeping', 'music', 'one', 'two', 'sappy', 'lines', 'Overall', 'though', 'acting', 'strong', 'action', 'scenes', 'tense', 'humor', 'warm', 'welcome', 'faults', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'capable', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'also', 'tugging', 'hearts', 'expanding', 'minds', 'Language', 'should', 'be', 'discovered', 'many']",N/A

Nevertheless and leaving aside the enormous barrier of cultures and beliefs, an North American entrepreneur from Boston goes to Israel to be present in the funeral of his father, victim of a criminal slaughter . Once he arrives he accepts to bring some information from the side of the enemy thanks to his knowledge about the language. But the destiny has for him an unexpected surprise that will change both lives.There's a remarkable highlight: the superb performance of F. Murray Abraham as Wahid, that it might well deserve him another nomination as Best supporting Actor.On the other hand the versatile direction his director Jim Abrahms is a true legendary triumph.This is a wise choice that carves in relief the whereabouts of a war that seems to have no end, with a sensitive touch of Romeo and Juliet, just at the end of the dramatic resolution.Watch it and you will be aware that love transcends all sort of beliefs.",5,"Two different religions, but hate is the same!",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,1191,"['language', 'enemy', 'haunting', 'touching', 'film', 'supported', 'agile', 'script', 'notable', 'intensity', 'profound', 'realism', 'outs', 'endless', 'conflict', 'non', 'sides', 'disposed', 'give', 'chance', 'peaceful', 'dialogue', 'Nevertheless', 'leaving', 'aside', 'enormous', 'barrier', 'cultures', 'beliefs', 'North', 'American', 'entrepreneur', 'Boston', 'Israel', 'be', 'present', 'funeral', 'father', 'victim', 'criminal', 'slaughter', 'Once', 'bring', 'information', 'side', 'enemy', 'thanks', 'knowledge', 'language', 'destiny', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'will', 'change', 'remarkable', 'highlight', 'superb', 'performance', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Wahid', 'might', 'well', 'deserve', 'nomination', 'Best', 'supporting', 'Actor.On', 'other', 'hand', 'versatile', 'direction', 'director', 'Jim', 'Abrahms', 'true', 'legendary', 'triumph.This', 'wise', 'choice', 'relief', 'whereabouts', 'war', 'have', 'end', 'sensitive', 'touch', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'just', 'end', 'dramatic', 'resolution.Watch', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'love', 'sort', 'beliefs']",N/A
