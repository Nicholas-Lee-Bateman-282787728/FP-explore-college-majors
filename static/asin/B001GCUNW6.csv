1193977,A3OWMX70M5NXVQ,B001GCUNW6,"Aaron F. ""aaronfissel""","[7, 10]","The only way I can tell you about this film, is that I really love it! The movie has solid animation, great characters, and plenty of action & comedy! In my opinion, it is the best out of the Ice Age Trilogy.I especially love the one eyed weasel Buck (Simon Pegg) and the Tyrannosaur family, who adopt Sid as one of their own. I have written out the plot below, but be warned, it contains spoilers!Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Manny (Ray Romano) are expecting their first child, and Manny is obsessed with making life perfect and safe for the family, since his first experiences as a husband and father went bad when his family was killed by hunters. At the same time, Diego (Denis Leary) finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle (Bill Hader) he has been stalking and decides to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid (John Leguizamo) grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and ""adopts"" three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and call them Eggbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid instead looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus the next morning.Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the other animals' young and ruins a playground Manny built for Ellie's baby. A female Tyrannosaurus, Momma, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit.Manny, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an Ankylosaurus threatens the herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by an insane, one-eyed weasel named Buckminster, or Buck (Simon Pegg).Buck has been living in this jungle for some time and is chasing Rudy (a huge albino Baryonyx), intending to avenge the eye he lost to it. He agrees to lead the herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid and her babies.In the meantime, Sid and Momma try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is soon welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.As the herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a Guanlong pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered Pteranodon only to been chased by a flock of Quetzalcoatlus on the way and saves his life.Manny reaches Ellie, and there is suddenly a reaction, the cry of a newborn baby, then he sees that it is a girl. He wants to name her Ellie, or Little Ellie, but Ellie instead names her Peaches after the fruit (and the codeword they had chosen for Ellie to use if she went into labor during the trip). Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to ""his"" children as he returns to the herd and learns of Peaches' birth.Before they can exit the jungle, Rudy attacks at full force; Buck lures Rudy away from the group and is nearly eaten himself, before Diego saves him at the last second. They then ensnare him briefly, but he escapes and resumes his onslaught. The herd is saved by the timely arrival of Momma, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff before roaring her victory. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck - now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone - decides to join the herd and live on the surface.However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends the herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time so that no one else can go down there. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children (though Manny tells Diego that he will never let Sid babysit Peaches). Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays where he wants to be: underground, battling it out with Rudy.The storyline is great, the characters are awesome, and the pace of the film is very fast. Basically, it is a film that you shouldn't miss out on. So far, its the best animated film of 2009 (that I've seen).My advice, buy this DVD. It's a great movie that is sure to please both young and old alike. So, what are you waiting for?

1193987,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001GCUNW6,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 10]","Before you get all up in arms, note that I adore the first two `Ice Age' films.  In fact, I recently gave the first one a 5-star review.  I agree that these films layer on the sap sometimes and that Pixar is far better equipped to actually illicit emotions out of us, but these films have (up until now) delivered sheer comedic enjoyment.Sadly, `Dawn of the Dinosaurs' just doesn't cut it.I'm going to make this short and (not so) sweet.  The film is basically too much of the same shtick.  There really is nothing new here.  The sequences seem like regurgitated moments from the two earlier (better) installments, and the whole `adventure' aspect of the films second half felt like a poorly realized `Dora' episode.  The funny moments were far and few in between.  That's what really upset me.  I can forgive a film like `Ice Age' for being slightly redundant if that redundancy produces the funny, but this film made me chuckle twice that I can think of (that helium scene was hilarious, but helium is always hilarious).  The `unusual' family aspect of this film is a great idea, but it just doesn't hold together so wonderfully here.  The films first half is too sappy and uneventful and the films second half is too predictable and uninspired.I really wanted to love this movie.The film borrows too heavily from more well rounded and better thought out films.  There are obvious comparisons to be made to Shrek, which is sad since this film should be able to stand on its own.  I also want to call to attention to crude jokes inserted in this film.  There were a handful of them, and I was kind of shocked.  I'm no prude, but this is a kid's movie, and some of the things done and said were highly inappropriate.  I didn't expect that from this movie.Scrat was the films main highlight (as he was for the first two films as well) and yet here his sub-plot also felt a tad forced.  The inclusion of the female counterpart was an obvious attempt to spruce up his storyline and add a layer of freshness to his tired routine, but it only worked in parts.All in all I can't really recommend this film.  The first two films are far better.  It's not awful, but it is far from good.  If you love the first two and have yet to see this, see it.  Simon Pegg is always welcome, and his character Buck has some nice moments.  Sadly though, this film fails to live up to what I expected and all that it could have (and should have) been.",2,It's getting a little old...,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,2429,"['get', 'up', 'arms', 'note', 'adore', 'first', 'two', 'Ice', 'Age', 'films', 'fact', 'recently', 'gave', 'first', 'one', '5-star', 'review', 'agree', 'films', 'layer', 'sap', 'sometimes', 'Pixar', 'far', 'better', 'equipped', 'actually', 'illicit', 'emotions', 'films', 'have', 'up', 'now', 'delivered', 'sheer', 'comedic', 'enjoyment.Sadly', 'Dawn', 'Dinosaurs', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'short', 'not', 'so', 'sweet', 'film', 'basically', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'shtick', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'sequences', 'seem', 'regurgitated', 'moments', 'two', 'earlier', 'better', 'installments', 'whole', 'adventure', 'aspect', 'films', 'second', 'half', 'felt', 'poorly', 'realized', 'Dora', 'episode', 'funny', 'moments', 'were', 'far', 'few', 'what', 'really', 'upset', 'can', 'forgive', 'film', 'Ice', 'Age', 'being', 'slightly', 'redundant', 'redundancy', 'funny', 'film', 'made', 'chuckle', 'twice', 'can', 'think', 'helium', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', 'helium', 'always', 'hilarious', 'unusual', 'family', 'aspect', 'film', 'great', 'idea', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'too', 'sappy', 'uneventful', 'films', 'second', 'half', 'too', 'predictable', 'uninspired.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie.The', 'film', 'borrows', 'too', 'heavily', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'better', 'thought', 'out', 'films', 'are', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'be', 'made', 'Shrek', 'sad', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'also', 'want', 'call', 'attention', 'crude', 'jokes', 'inserted', 'film', 'were', 'handful', 'was', 'kind', 'shocked', ""'m"", 'prude', 'kid', 'movie', 'things', 'done', 'said', 'were', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie.Scrat', 'was', 'films', 'main', 'highlight', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'well', 'yet', 'here', 'sub-plot', 'also', 'felt', 'tad', 'forced', 'inclusion', 'female', 'counterpart', 'was', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'spruce', 'up', 'storyline', 'add', 'layer', 'freshness', 'tired', 'routine', 'only', 'worked', 'parts.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'not', 'awful', 'far', 'good', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'see', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'always', 'welcome', 'character', 'Buck', 'nice', 'moments', 'Sadly', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'expected', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been']",N/A

These animated animals travel through rivers, down dangerous paths, fall down steep cliffs, ride through volcanos and waterfalls... this is actually some of the prettiest animation I've ever seen, second only to the Simpsons I suppose.Anyway, the story in this film is about the sloth character who discovers dinosaur eggs, and when they hatch, he wants to mother them.  Of course ""you know who"" doesn't want that to happen (the mother dinosaur) and from there, the adventure of a lifetime takes place.I still believe adults can enjoy these type of movies just as much as children.  You don't have to buy these kind of films for children only.I was laughing the entire time, and I believe you will too.  That is, if you share a love for animated comedies the same way I do.

1194005,AJ0FKS7G1O6RK,B001GCUNW6,beta,"[15, 22]","To compare the strengths and weaknesses of two different types of 3D I watched this movie with both the red/green anaglyph 3D glasses that comes with the 3D DVD, and with a pair of TV Eyes 3D Glasses, a new kind of non-electronic 3D glasses designed for use with regular 2D movies and TVs.Ice Age is always a fun franchise, and Dawn of the Dinosaurs holds up that tradition admirably. This DVD comes with both a 3D format DVD, and a regular 2D DVD, as well as 4 pair of red/green cardboard (anaglyph) 3D glasses.I watched both versions of the movie on a 32 inch RCA HDTV, and turned off the room lights as the DVD instructed for 3D viewing.I tried the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses first, and I was surprised at how well the colors came through. Often anaglyph movies can have a strange silvering effect, basically washing out all but a few colors, but this DVD actually did very well. The mammoths', sloth's, and tiger's fur all looked the right color brown, and the white of the snow and blue of the sky came through nicely. It did tend to make dark blues and greens stand out oddly, and eyes and mouths tended to have an oddly psychedelic flashing quality as they went from pink to white and back again, especially in fast motion scenes.For the most part the tracking and converging of the frames was very good, ghosting was mostly limited to far away objects, which could gain a pink side shadow, and the occasional odd effect, such as one scene where the possum's noses were very luridly pink all during one scene.The depth of the image was nice, adding a true three dimensional feel to the backgrounds, and while there weren't any ""jump out"" scenes that I noticed, there were some wonderfully deep and solid looking scenes, such as when Sid and the eggs are thrown into the air and briefly ""float"" in space until they start falling.This is definitely the old fashioned ""50's"" style of 3D, with the colored glasses, but overall it was done very well and made for a very entertaining movie.Next, I watched the 2D version of the movie in 3D with the TV Eyes 3D glasses. TV Eyes 3D glasses are a bit odd compared to most other 3D glasses, because they have a row of small holes across each lens. You have to look through the holes to watch the movie. I didn't think they'd actually work when I first tried them, if nothing else I figured it would just be impossible to see out of the holes, regardless of whether they did anything 3D or not.They did make the room dimmer when I tried them on, but once I aligned the holes the way the instructions said, and turned off the lights, I could see the TV just fine.This type of 3D was not as deep as the red/green 3D glasses. Things didn't stand out quite so much in some scenes, but the characters did look very solid and three dimensional. The main difference (aside from the colors) that I saw was that the red/green glasses had a tendency to give a ""layered"" look to some scenes. Almost a pop-up book effect sometimes as if things had been laid on top of each other. The TV Eyes 3D wasn't as deep, but the transitions seemed to be smoother. Giving a more natural look to the depth it had.The other thing that I really liked about the TV Eyes 3D was that it made the picture very clear and sharp. The 3D was actually higher definition than my regular HDTV. I couldn't see the scan lines or pixels, so it made it look that much more real without losing detail. And the colors were very natural. There wasn't any problem with psychedelic colors or the pink flashing eyes like with the red/green glasses. It was just like the normal movie picture had been upgraded for clarity, while also adding a bit of depth, like the background had been pushed back so you could see the shape of everything.So, for me, it was a toss up. For a really deep 3D experience I'd go for the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses. But for a more natural, less distracting 3D view I'd probably go with the 2D version of the movie and the TV Eyes 3D Glasses.I also saw this movie in it's original 3D theater release in Real-D 3D. That effect was about halfway between the two discussed here, Real-D at the theater had all the depth of the red/green 3D version, while having the natural colors of the TV Eyes 3D version.But, however you decide to watch it, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a totally fun movie. From its mad-weasel dinosaur hunter, to its ""lonely hearts"" musical scene of the acorn being ""Alone Again"" when Scrat gives it up for the love of a flying squirrel.Brilliant!",4,I Watched This in

1194020,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001GCUNW6,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 12]","This is starting to get silly. There shouldn't be dinosaurs in a story that takes place during the last ice age. It's a well known fact that they were long since extinct at that point. Yes, I'm well aware that this is a fantasy, and yes, I'm aware that it's supposed to be silly and fun and unburdened with historical accuracy. But come on, even fantasies have their limits. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" the third chapter in the series, is goofy and innocuous, completely removed from the more clever ideas that made the first two films enjoyable. Despite the fact that the release is in ""eye-popping"" 3-D, it's been reduced to the level of your average Saturday morning cartoon, lacking any real depth and full of thrill-ride misadventures that don't really go anywhere. I grant you that it's a decent enough film for younger children, but I fear that the adults in the audience won't get much out of it.The film, which reunites all the main characters from the previous films, is founded on the premise that a handful of dinosaurs survived extinction and made their home beneath the snow-covered earth. How this happened is something the film never bothers to explain, but I guess it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), Manny the Wooly Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), his pregnant wife, Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah), her possum brothers Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck), and Diego the Saber-Tooth Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary) have stumbled onto this hidden world and go on yet another adventure. New to the series is Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg), a weasel left stranded in the dinosaur cave. He has one eye and an Australian accent. If you ever wondered what Steve Irwin would have been like with a mental disorder, now's your chance to find out.The plot: Sid, longing for a family of his own, stumbles upon three eggs after falling through a patch of thin ice. He happily claims them as his own--he even draws crude smiley faces on the shells to give them some personality. Only when they hatch does he discover that his ""children"" are actually T-Rexes. It isn't long before their real mother ascends and rounds up her children, taking Sid along with her. It's now up to his friends to enter the dinosaur cave and rescue him. Lo and behold, they're aided by Buck, a thoroughly insane adventurer with a leaf for an eye patch and a dinosaur tooth for a hunting knife. He's on a quest for his own version of Moby Dick: A great white dinosaur he has named Rudy.The main story is occasionally interrupted by comedic vignettes with Scrat the Squirrel, who, of course, is still on a mission to find an acorn. His frenetic escapades have been enhanced for this new movie with the addition of Scratte, a female flying squirrel who's also in search of an acorn. They're simultaneously in love and in competition with each other, which is kind of funny but also kind of lame. Scrat's acorn episodes may have been fun at first, but now they're just getting old. Think back to the era of the Warner Bros. cartoons: How many Wile E. Coyote shorts does it take to make it clear that (a) he'll always get hurt by defective Acme products and (b) he'll never catch the Road Runner? Not too many, I should think. At a certain point, you're just beating a dead horse.The humor is periodically tamed, albeit weakly, by more serious plot points. Diego, for example, fears he's losing his edge, which is why he wants to leave as soon as Manny's baby is born. Sid is still being hassled for his more annoying tendencies, none of which are helped by the fact that he likes kids so much. Manny is overprotective of Ellie and the baby, so much so that he begins neglecting his friends. All of this is addressed, but they're hardly developed. This is probably why I didn't feel much of anything for the characters, certainly not like I did in the first two films. It now seems as if the filmmakers were more interested in perfecting the look, and indeed, the computer imagery and bold color scheme provide great visual appeal (the 3-D doesn't do much for them, but then again, 3-D itself hasn't been all that impressive lately).I'm sure some of you think I'm being too hard on this film, but I'm sorry, I can only suspend disbelief so high before the ropes threaten to buckle. I'll say this much: If you absolutely must see this film, or if your child is pressing the issue, I recommend you save the extra money and see it in traditional 2-D. Otherwise, you should be in no hurry to get the theater. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is proof that there can be too much of a good thing; Manny, Sid, Ellie, Diego, and the rest are fun characters, but after two entertaining adventures, they've officially overstayed their welcome. It doesn't help that they're trapped in a story undeserving of them; when it comes to this kind of cartoon, there's no way to genuinely be interested in the idea that dinosaurs live underground.

1194037,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001GCUNW6,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 26]","""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" marks the third CG animated film for 20th Century Fox via Fox's CGI division Blue Sky Studios and the third ""Ice Age"" film directed by Carlos Saldanha (also directed ""Robots"" and ""Gone Nutty"").  The film is co-directed by Mike Thurmeier (""Horton Hears a Who"", ""Robots"", ""Gone Nutty"") and a story by Jason Carter Eaton and a screenplay by Pete Ackerman, Michael Berg (both worked on previous ""Ice Age"" films), Yoni Brenner and Mike Reiss (""The Simpsons"", The Critic"", ""It's Garry Shandling's Show"").  Music is composed by John Powell (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""United 93"", ""Kung Fu Panda"").Back in 2002, the original ""Ice Age"" film focused on the friendship between creatures Manny the woolly mammoth (voice over by Ray Romano, ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Sid the weird looking, not-so-bright and clumsy ground sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo, ""ER"", ""Miracle at St. Anna"", ""Titan A.E."") and the saber-toothed tiger (aka smilodon) named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary, ""Rescue Me"").  Also, seen outside of the main core of the group is side-story featuring a squirrel known as Scrat who has a passion towards acorns.With the first film focusing on the migration to avoid the Ice Age and the main character's friendship, the second film ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" (2006) features the melting of the ice and focuses on Manny finding another woolly mammoth named Ellie (voice by Queen Latifah, ""Mad Money"", ""Chicago"").This time around for the third film ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", Ellie is now pregnant and is soon to give birth.  Being the worried and concerned father, Manny is highly anticipating the birth of his child and each kick, he often accidentally tells the whole herd that Ellie is about to give birth.Meanwhile, his friends are not in a better place. Diego is getting older and feels that he is not the agile fighter as he once was as he now gets dizzy and can't even chase after his prey like he once used to. So, Diego feels as if he has to leave home. Sid feels alone now that his best friend has other responsibilities.  As for the nutty squirrel known as Scrat, upon discovering his beloved acorn, he becomes smitten with a female squirrel named Scratte who is also passionate for the acorn.Manny creates a playground for his upcoming child and surprises Ellie with it.  Meanwhile, Sid feeling that he has no one ends up falling through a hole and discovering three eggs.  Wanting to be a parent himself, he brings the three eggs to the village.  Because of the size, Manny tells Sid to return the eggs back to its mother but Sid of course has other plans.  Not wanting to be alone, he ends up sleeping with the eggs and when hatched, three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex's come out and Sid becomes the designated ""mother"" for the three which he names Eggbert, Shelly and Yoko.Excited about being a parent, he tries to introduce to his new children to his friends but instead brings the three to Manny's playground (which was supposed to be for Manny and Ellie's child).  The kids of the village then join in on the fun and because of the Tyrannosaurus Rex's nature, they begin to roughhouse the children and end up swallowing a few of them.  Also, in the process...the three young dinosaurs end up destroying the playground.Manny and Ellie arrive to find the destruction and Manny is upset that Sid didn't listen to him and now the playground he built is destroyed.  To make things worse, the true mother of the three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex now wants her children back and leads the huge dinosaur right into their village.The Tyrannosaurus Rex ends up getting her children back but with Sid not willing to give up the children, he is taken as well by the dinosaur.Now Manny, Ellie, Diego along with the two weasels Crash (voiced by Seann William Scott, ""American Pie"" films) and Eddie (Josh Peck, ""Drake & Josh"", ""The Wackness"") end up going after the dinosaur to find Sid and find themselves away from the ice and into a new land where there is no snow and dinosaurs exist.  Not knowing how to survive around the dangerous dinosaurs, they run into a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg, ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Sean of the Dead"", ""Star Trek"") who knows his way around the area.So, the group try to survive the dangerous dinosaurs, tough terrain but most importantly trying to be careful for the nastiest dinosaur of them all...Rudy.""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" on Blu-ray comes with three discs.  The original Blu-ray is accompanied with the movie on DVD and also a digital copy.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1, AVC@36 MBPS), I'm always impressed to see how hair/fur continues to look better and better via CG and the sheer detail found in each character and its surroundings are much more evident now than ever.  In fact, this is probably the most vibrant ""Ice Age"" film due to the fact that the film is taken outside of its ice habitat and into the land of the dinosaurs where there is a lot of lush plant life, sunlight, etc.  Overall, CG animated fans will love the picture quality of this film.  Sky Blue Studios did a fantastic job!As for the audio, the film is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital) and as fantastic as the picture quality was, the audio quality is just as magnificent.  Talk about an immersive soundtrack, dinosaur growls all around you and how its utilized through the surround and rear surround channels are nicely done. Front and center channels feature the dialogue and the music which are crystal clear.  Also, good use of LFE during the action sequences.Both video and audio quality for ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaur"" receive high marks!

A fun screenplay, top notch animation and audio and voiced by an all-star cast, this is my favorite ""Ice Age"" film yet!  Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah do a fantastic job as they have in previous films.  But also, Josh Peck and Seann William Scott do a hilarious job as Eddie and Crash.  And Simon Pegg as the one-eyed weasel known as Buck does a fantastic job as well!I was really impressed of how much detail was in the actual film.  To have the characters in a new setting outside of just ice was great and it really showcased the animation due to the fact that more colors and different characters can be utilized.  Blue Sky Studios did a fantastic job on this release.As for the Blu-ray release, this is where Twentieth Century Fox also receives big kudos.  Similar to what Disney has done for their films, Twentieth Century Fox also included a DVD (for those long commutes for your children) and also a digital copy.  Also, there are plenty of special features and CG shorts included as well.  In fact, if you are a big fan of the character of Scrat, you are definitely going to enjoy this film!Overall, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is the best film of the series yet and an exciting and hilarious CG animated film to own on Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: Wow...I really dig the picture quality and the immersive lossless audio on this film!

Yes, the graphics is wery well done and landscapes are beautiful. 3D is not outstanding but is reasonably good. The characters are colorful. However, I found the plot fairly boring and slowly paced (for an adult) (by the way, there are many cartoons which I really enjoy) and ended up fast-forwarding through most of the second half of the movie. There are many episodes with aggressive and scary looking dinosaurs biting everything around which can scare younger kids (I can very well imagine my 5 year old not sleeping well for several nights if I would allow him to watch it). Many cartoons have some message - like idea of achievement or friendship or love - in ""Ice Age 3"" there is no clear message which kids could learn, there is not much humor, and at the end it is hard to explain what this movie was about. Pure entertainment? - Maybe, but I was not entertained by it. The parallel plot line - two fox-like creatures fighting for a unicorn - seems to be completely meaningless and out of sync with the main plot. My best guess about so many positive reviews is that there are many people who watched the first two movies in this series and fell in love with them, which explains why they were eager to see the sequel and were thrilled about the fact that it is there and it is in 3D.

1194072,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001GCUNW6,John F. Rooney,"[3, 4]","""Ice Age 3"" when I saw it kept the kids in the audience enthralled and screaming with delight every time characters were speeding downhill or falling into chasms. Adults will find the sound track imaginative and hilarious at times with variations on ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" (one a fun tango version) including the dynamic vocal rendition by Lou Rawls himself. The ""Adagio from Spartacus"" by Khachaturian and Chad Fischer's ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" will also seem clever by their juxtaposition at the oddest moments.Two prehistoric Ice Age squirrels, Scrat and Sratt&egrave;, turn up in frequent episodes independent of the main plot fighting over a giant acorn. They'll remind old timers of the short cartoons of yesteryear like Roadrunner and Woody the Woodpecker. Free falls from extreme heights, splats, flattenings, catapults into space, chases, and flirtations make the whole thing wacky fun.Familiar characters from previous Ice Age outings show up in this ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" sequel including the two mammoths Manny (voice of Ray Romano) and expectant mother Ellie (voice of Queen Latifah), Sid, the sloth (voice of John Leguizamo), Diego, the saber-tooth tiger, and assorted smaller animals. A new character, Buck, a pirate weasel with a leaf as an eye-patch, shows up, and he's on a quest to kill the giant raptor dinosaur who has blinded him in one eye. (Captain Ahab, anyone?).The main character is Sid the Sloth who is lonely and ""adopts"" three dinosaur eggs that hatch and become his babies. From that point on there are all kinds of scary adventures with teetering rock platforms, red hot lava, falling off cliffs--these hair-raisers come up as the animal family tries to rescue Sid from the clutches of the T-Rex.The movie is full of funny situations, gags, and some adult humor that will go over the heads of little kids. Breakneck speed is an important element in the action sequences, and there are plenty of death-defying falls and enemies to contend with. The computer animation is well done. The walk and gait of the mammoths is particularly effective. This is a film that youngsters will enjoy, and it won't be a chore for adults to see with them or on their own.",5,Great Entertainment for All,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2209,"['Ice', 'Age', '3', 'when', 'saw', 'kept', 'kids', 'audience', 'enthralled', 'screaming', 'delight', 'time', 'characters', 'were', 'speeding', 'downhill', 'falling', 'chasms', 'Adults', 'will', 'find', 'sound', 'track', 'imaginative', 'hilarious', 'times', 'variations', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Find', 'Love', 'Mine', 'one', 'fun', 'tango', 'version', 'including', 'dynamic', 'vocal', 'rendition', 'Lou', 'Rawls', 'Adagio', 'Spartacus', 'Khachaturian', 'Chad', 'Fischer', 'Alone', 'Again', 'Naturally', 'will', 'also', 'seem', 'clever', 'juxtaposition', 'oddest', 'moments.Two', 'prehistoric', 'Ice', 'Age', 'squirrels', 'Scrat', 'Sratt', 'egrave', 'turn', 'up', 'frequent', 'episodes', 'independent', 'main', 'plot', 'fighting', 'giant', 'acorn', ""'ll"", 'remind', 'old', 'timers', 'short', 'cartoons', 'yesteryear', 'Roadrunner', 'Woody', 'Woodpecker', 'Free', 'extreme', 'heights', 'splats', 'flattenings', 'catapults', 'space', 'chases', 'flirtations', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'wacky', 'fun.Familiar', 'characters', 'previous', 'Ice', 'Age', 'show', 'up', 'Dawn', 'Dinosaurs', 'sequel', 'including', 'two', 'mammoths', 'Manny', 'voice', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'expectant', 'mother', 'Ellie', 'voice', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Sid', 'sloth', 'voice', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Diego', 'saber-tooth', 'tiger', 'assorted', 'smaller', 'animals', 'new', 'character', 'Buck', 'pirate', 'weasel', 'leaf', 'eye-patch', 'up', 'quest', 'kill', 'giant', 'raptor', 'dinosaur', 'who', 'blinded', 'one', 'eye', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'anyone', '.The', 'main', 'character', 'Sid', 'Sloth', 'who', 'lonely', 'adopts', 'three', 'dinosaur', 'eggs', 'hatch', 'become', 'babies', 'point', 'are', 'kinds', 'scary', 'adventures', 'teetering', 'rock', 'platforms', 'red', 'hot', 'lava', 'falling', 'off', 'cliffs', 'hair-raisers', 'come', 'up', 'animal', 'family', 'tries', 'rescue', 'Sid', 'clutches', 'T-Rex.The', 'movie', 'full', 'funny', 'situations', 'gags', 'adult', 'humor', 'will', 'go', 'heads', 'little', 'kids', 'Breakneck', 'speed', 'important', 'element', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'plenty', 'death-defying', 'falls', 'enemies', 'contend', 'computer', 'animation', 'well', 'done', 'walk', 'gait', 'mammoths', 'particularly', 'effective', 'film', 'youngsters', 'will', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'chore', 'adults', 'see', 'own']",N/A

Has it been so long that nobody recognizes that?The eventual relationship between the mother T-Rex and Sid reminded me of the dragon that falls in love with Donkey during Shrek.I never thought for a moment that anything bad would really happen to Sid, so the suspense turned out to be how many big dinosaur feet the characters would dodge on the way to his inevitable rescue.Diego has devolved into a boring selfish middle-aged sabre toothed tiger that doesn't want to find a mate, or get motivated to do anything unless disaster strikes.  I'll resist the obvious joke that he's grown rather long in the tooth.  Nope, I couldn't resist, actually.Addng a love interest for Scratt was the most original thing I saw happen in this movie.

Ice Age 3 is no different, very fun, with a little bit of a message.  Again, new characters are added, most of which are fun.  The silent dinosaurs are funny, and sweet in a destructive way.  The best new addition is Buck, the crazed dino hunter/guide.  Very funny, and crazy and added another level of humor to the familiar characters that are already fun. If I had a complaint it would be the use of the coming of age story.  Like Shrek 3, this movie follows the new pattern of having a coming of age/midlife crisis story within a kids movie.  Frankly, kids movies seem to be the last place these type of stories belong.  But unlike Shrek 3, this movie wasn't bogged down by the story, but just used it as a stepping stone for more fun.Overall, Ice Age 3 probably won't win over any new fans, but it will definitely be a lot of fun for the fans of the previous movies.

Diego (v. by Denis Leary) is ready to leave, but Sid the Sloth (v. by John Leguizamo) can't figure out why they don't all stay a herd.When Sid adopts three dino babies of his own, not knowing what they are, of course) the whole crew goes underground and into the land of the dino to rescue him.

1194140,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B001GCUNW6,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","Ice Age:The Dawn of the Dinosaurs(released July/09)is the latest in the Ice Age franchise with the return of the ""herd"" of Manny(Ray Romano),Diego(Denis Leary),Sid the Sloth(John Leguizamo),Ellie(Queen Latifah),Crash(Seann Scott) and Eddie(Josh Peck).It is another whirlwind adventure with the same heart the previous films have had.This time around Ellie is pregnant and Manny is the doting but extremely nervous father to be.A crisis of sorts comes about when Diego realizes that Manny's priorities have changed and feels it's probably best Sid and he moved on.Diego leaves while Sid ventures not too far only to find three dinosaur eggs from an unknown species.He instantly declares himself their parent and comes back to show HE is now a parent also.Manny warns him to return the eggs to their original location but Sid will hear none of it.He leaves and the eggs hatch and we see he has become the proud parent of three....baby tyrannosaurs!They of course bond with him declaring him to be their mommy.Well it is of course natural that whose ever eggs they were,they are going to come looking for them.And sure enough the mother T-Rex shows up to claim her young.Sid puts up some objections which deters the mother not a speck.She picks up her babies AND Sid and heads for the underground cave from whence Sid first got the eggs.In the mothers travels she passes Diego,who witnessing the surreal scene,decides to follow the T-Rex,which works out well as Manny,Ellie and the gang hook up as they are also following the mother.Their pursuit leads them all into a huge underground cavern which harbours a nature time capsule full of supposedly extinct dinosaurs of which the mother T-Rex is just one.Almost immediately they run into a weasel with an eye patch called Buck(Simon Pegg).He lives there and has been chasing a large Baronyx called Rudy who took his eye.He talks with an Aussie accent and is more than a little eccentric.He guides them from here on into the underground world they are about to enter.First they navigate the chasm of death where the air is filled with helium gas.They next move on to lava falls but get ambushed by a pack of smaller carnivorous reptiles after Ellie gets separated from the rest due to unstable rocks.The group attempts to double back and save Ellie from certain death.Diego is first there and becomes her saviour until Manny can get there.Meanwhile Sid has been in a parent contest with the mommy T-Rex but it is a losing battle.She's all over him like a dirty shirt.She welcomes Sid into her family but the next day Sid is separated from his kids and the mother after an attack by giant Rudy.He ends up on a floating rock in a lava field headed for lava falls.His screams are heard by all and Buck,Crash and Eddie decide to head out to rescue Sid.They commandeer a pterodactyl and just as they spot him and head in they are jumped by other flying reptiles. Through alot of fancy maneuvering and some sling shots by Eddie and Crash,they save Sid just as he starts to plummet over the falls.Meanwhile back on the rocks with Ellie she has finally given birth to a sweet baby girl they will call Peaches.It's another Ice Age tear jerking moment.Sid arrives on the scene to witness the newborn but regrets that as they start to head back home that he never had a chance to say goodbye to his family.Just as they reach the entrance Rudy pops up scattering the group.At that moment the mother T-Rex  stampedes onto the scene and pushes Rudy over a cliff.Thinking that Rudy is now gone Buck decides to come topside with the rest.Just as they are about to leave the cavern Rudy's call is heard echoing in the distance and Buck decides to stay to hound his old nemesis.The group returns to the surface and introduces little Peaches to her new cold environment.Diego says he plans to stay with Manny and company as he has all the adventure anyone could ever want with them.The running gag Scrat is of course seen throughout the film.This time his pursuit of his ever lovin' acorn is temporarily halted by the presence of a girl flying squirrel called Scratte,whom he sets up a domestic life with.Lou Rawls""You'll never find"" plays in the background as the two court but Scrattes demanding ways finally frustrate him so much that when he spies his acorn(which now also has its own song sung to the tune of ""Alone Again,Naturally""),he returns to it with glee.But the two are soon arguing again and when the acorn is slammed into the ground this causes a lava explosion which sends Scrat and his nut back to the surface.As he dances about with glee the piece of ice hurled skyward as he broke through now returns sending the nut back to the cavern below and seals the hole.Scrat simply loses it and screams.This film,like the last,comes in at around 91 minutes,and it has the consistent quality of the first.The payoff at the end(with Diego staying on and the group being together again) is anti-climactic.The real payoff is the birth of Peaches,which,as I said,is another tearjerker of a moment.The plot is fast moving and the world is populated with alot of fascinating creatures.You will notice that the creatures themselves,like the T-Rex mom and Rudy,are all drawn without sharp edges and less than realistic faces as not to scare the small-fries in the audience.This is not Jurassic Park and the Ice Age creators know and deliver to their demo,not alienating their adult viewers(with their smart dialogue)in the process.Technically the film has been transferred into its 1:85:1 a/r and the picture is crisp and clear.Extras include some commentary and trailers.All in all yet another winner from Blue Sky animation that the whole family can

I loved how the animators created the sense of size and weight of the Dino's.  This movie is definitely worthy of being the summer box office smash hit that it was, grossing 878.5 million worldwide.  Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks can only ""wish"" they could produce a ""cash-cow"" like this movie for under 90 million.  I love some of the computer animated movies from those companies, as well.I saw Ice Age 3 for the first time when it came out on DVD.  I loved it. The movie had a very strong story but well-tempered by the comedy relief of Scrat, Scratte, & the Acorn. Speaking of the Scrat & Scratte scenes, this movie revived my interest in the classic song ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine,"" by Lou Rawls, which was used as a romantic backdrop in those scenes.  It is a beautiful song.  I remember seeing Lou Rawls sing it on TV when I was a kid.After renting this movie to see it for the first time, I purchased my own DVD copy on Amazon.I have the blu-ray version of this movie as well.  The blu-ray version seems to be a poorly programed.

Diego gets the hint & is ready to take off on his own again, when he realizes he may be to old to go it alone.

Of course, mama T Rex comes a calling & its not long before ole Sid is in big trouble & its up to his buddies to bale him out.The first Ice Age was something new, fresh, funny & had the advantage of being one of the more successfull CG animated films that didn't come from Disney or Pixar. Ice Age 3 has none of these advantages. There is nothing really new, except a character thats voiced by Simon Pegg who has all the best funny bits (and they are few and far between).
