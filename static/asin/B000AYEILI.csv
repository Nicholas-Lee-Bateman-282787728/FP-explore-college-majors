934771,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000AYEILI,Anton Ilinski,"[15, 23]","""Scrapbook"" is one of the movies from the ""Most Disturbing Films Ever Made"" list every gorehound supposedly should have.Leonard is a lunatic who keeps Clara in his house, torments her, abuses sexually and emotionally, shoots everything he's doing to her on video and makes her write her thoughts down in a scrapbook which he considers to be some kind of a magnum opus.Director Eric Stanze made this violent film not for violence's sake, that would be too simple and not interesting at all. He put a lot of effort creating an insight into maniac's mentality and mentality of his helpless victim who learns to manipulate her torturer through her suffering. That is what attracted me in the movie - this killer-victim relations. If it was not for them, the film, shot on video, would seem just another mindless amateur gore flick intended to sicken the audience and nothing more. And ""Scrapbook"" is indeed brutal and disturbing. It's full of blood, mayhem, naked bodies and torture. Emily Haack and Tommy Biondo (who unfortunately died without having seen the final cut of this work) act awesome, you totally believe them, they did a great job, it's because of them mainly the movie looks so realistic. Of course if you dedicated your life to the search of THE most disturbing film ever, ""Scrapbook"" is not the one. It really is one of them, but Fred Vogel's ""August Underground"" for example is by far more messy and gory and disgusting. And more clever I'd say although they both have pretty much the same plot.But ""Scrapbook"" is not stupid, it's a good work, I think it found its own niche within the genre, so if you're a collector or just like disturbing films - this one is for you.What's important, the edition has nice extras - ""making of"" featurette and interviews with cast and crew. That's a nice bonus that lets you relax after such a grim film and see guys who were doing it are not maniacs at all, but a bunch of very nice people. I had watched all the extras right after the movie itself and I should say I slept better at night than I think I would without them :)",4,A REMARKABLE MOVIE WITHIN ITS GENRE,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,2076,"['Scrapbook', 'one', 'movies', 'Most', 'Disturbing', 'Films', 'Ever', 'Made', 'list', 'gorehound', 'supposedly', 'should', 'have.Leonard', 'lunatic', 'who', 'Clara', 'house', 'sexually', 'emotionally', 'shoots', 'everything', 'doing', 'video', 'write', 'thoughts', 'down', 'scrapbook', 'be', 'kind', 'magnum', 'opus.Director', 'Eric', 'Stanze', 'made', 'violent', 'film', 'not', 'violence', 'sake', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'simple', 'not', 'interesting', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'creating', 'insight', 'maniac', 'mentality', 'mentality', 'helpless', 'victim', 'who', 'manipulate', 'torturer', 'suffering', 'what', 'attracted', 'movie', 'killer-victim', 'relations', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'shot', 'video', 'would', 'seem', 'just', 'mindless', 'amateur', 'gore', 'flick', 'intended', 'sicken', 'audience', 'nothing', 'more', 'Scrapbook', 'indeed', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'full', 'blood', 'mayhem', 'naked', 'bodies', 'torture', 'Emily', 'Haack', 'Tommy', 'Biondo', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'died', 'having', 'seen', 'final', 'cut', 'work', 'act', 'awesome', 'totally', 'believe', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'mainly', 'movie', 'so', 'realistic', 'course', 'dedicated', 'life', 'search', 'THE', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'ever', 'Scrapbook', 'not', 'one', 'really', 'one', 'Fred', 'Vogel', 'August', 'Underground', 'example', 'far', 'more', 'messy', 'gory', 'disgusting', 'more', 'clever', ""'d"", 'say', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'plot.But', 'Scrapbook', 'not', 'stupid', 'good', 'work', 'think', 'found', 'own', 'niche', 'genre', 'so', ""'re"", 'collector', 'just', 'disturbing', 'films', 'one', 'you.What', 'important', 'edition', 'nice', 'extras', 'making', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'nice', 'bonus', 'relax', 'such', 'grim', 'film', 'see', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'doing', 'are', 'not', 'maniacs', 'bunch', 'very', 'nice', 'people', 'had', 'watched', 'extras', 'right', 'movie', 'should', 'say', 'slept', 'better', 'night', 'think', 'would']",N/A

The concept is interesting although it's a shame the writing and the acting are not up to par. I was expecting to see ""reality"" horror i.e. 'Irriversable' or even 'A Serbian Film' but I only ended up bored out of my mind and even fast forwarding through several dull scenes.

934776,A2HOSAIQKAPR1H,B000AYEILI,Sid Stirling,"[6, 10]","Image Entertainment has re-released another WICKED PIXEL CINEMA title uncut and with good special features. First, the movie SCRAPBOOK itself is a beautifully simplistic serial killer story with basically two characters: Leonard, the serial killer played by the late Tommy Biondo (ICE FROM THE SUN, SATISFACTION) and Clara, the victim played by EMILY HAACK (THE UNDERTOW, SAVAGE HARVEST 2:OCTOBER BLOOD). Both actors are brilliant in this movie. By keeping the movie simple, director ERIC STANZE (ICE FROM THE SUN, DEADWOOD PARK) is able to portray all of the torturous elements of kidnapping and torture, without pulling any punches. This movie made we cringe, wince, and shutter in terror, leaving me saying, ""I can't believe they put that in a movie."" Which, makes the movie one of the best serial killer, suspense, and horror movies I have seen in a long time.The special features on this re-release aren't as extensive as the previous Wicked Pixel Cinema re-release of Ice From The Sun, but they did not disappoint. The commentary tracks are informative and the ""shower cam"" sequence was a nicely added, chilling surprise.Although this movie is not for everyone, I highly recommend this movie to anybody looking for no-holds-barred brutality, done in a brilliantly simple style and design that leaves you breathless.",5,Beauty and Terror in Simplicity...,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,1321,"['Image', 'Entertainment', 're-released', 'WICKED', 'PIXEL', 'CINEMA', 'title', 'uncut', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'First', 'movie', 'SCRAPBOOK', 'beautifully', 'simplistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'basically', 'two', 'characters', 'Leonard', 'serial', 'killer', 'played', 'late', 'Tommy', 'Biondo', 'ICE', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SUN', 'SATISFACTION', 'Clara', 'victim', 'played', 'EMILY', 'HAACK', 'THE', 'UNDERTOW', 'SAVAGE', 'HARVEST', '2', 'OCTOBER', 'BLOOD', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'keeping', 'movie', 'simple', 'director', 'ERIC', 'STANZE', 'ICE', 'FROM', 'THE', 'SUN', 'DEADWOOD', 'PARK', 'able', 'portray', 'torturous', 'elements', 'kidnapping', 'torture', 'pulling', 'punches', 'movie', 'made', 'cringe', 'wince', 'shutter', 'terror', 'leaving', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'put', 'movie', 'Which', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'serial', 'killer', 'suspense', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'special', 'features', 're-release', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'extensive', 'previous', 'Wicked', 'Pixel', 'Cinema', 're-release', 'Ice', 'Sun', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'informative', 'shower', 'cam', 'sequence', 'was', 'nicely', 'added', 'chilling', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anybody', 'looking', 'no-holds-barred', 'brutality', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'simple', 'style', 'design', 'breathless']",N/A
934777,A1H7PH075VTHO8,B000AYEILI,Sir Jub-Jub,"[12, 20]","I have to disagree with all the other reviewers here. ""Scrapbook"" is simply not a good film. It basically illustrates the abduction, humiliation, raping and terrorizing of a female. The main problem with the film, aside from its pointlessness is that the acting is extremely poor. The whole idea of the film is to witness the interaction of the victim and her abductor, but this is entirely undone by the lame acting. The direction is also very poor with continued use of static camera placements that only highlight the fact that these actors are unable to portray their characters. At no time is their any sense of terror properly demonstrated by the female actress and at no time is their any sense of malevolence demonstrated by the male actor.
