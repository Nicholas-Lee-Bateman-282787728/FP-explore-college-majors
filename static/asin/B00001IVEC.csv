The opening scene must be seen to be believed. Keaton and his band (which includes Henry Rollins) are belting out---kiddie songs to a packed crowd of adults,who looove it! Really,is a drunken bar crowd really going to cheer for ""Frosty the Snowman""? Maybe there is ""beer ears"" in addition to ""beer goggles.""Keaton dies in an accident,but his annoying young son revives him by playing the harmonica. He returns... as a creepy snowman. Conservative commentator Michael Medved claimed this movie was objectionable because it implies intimacy between Keaton's wife (Kelly Preston,far from herMetalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn [VHS] glory days) and the snowman/husband. Frankly, Preston spends most of the movie thinking her little boy is slightly delusional.For a kids' film,it is awfully creepy (such as the way Jack Frost strikes back at his son's friends) Yes,the love scene between Preston and Keaton is objectionable,only because it brings up the birds and bees discussion before it's time.

They are reunited when Dad's spirit animates a bouncy, energetic man of snow. Michael Keaton (in his best work since &quot;Multiplicity&quot;) provides the voice of this cool character. Together, Charlie and the snowman share many snow-themed adventures, from a rousing sled-ride to a snowball fight. To be sure, their opponents don't stand a chance against a being so adept at throwing projectiles formed from his own substance!

Kramer ""Eric Kramer""","[1, 1]","This movie is about a dad named Jack Frost (Michael Keaton) who gets so caught up in trying to impress the world that he forgets about his wife, portrayed by Kelly Preston, and most importantly, his son Charlie (Joseph Cross.) On the way to a band gig one Christmas Eve, he realizes that he has neglected his wife and his son. On the way back to their cabin, Jack gets in a car accident and is killed. Fast-forward to the next Christmas; we see that Charlie is still struggling to cope with his dad's passing. His dad had spent a lot of time trying to make lots of money for his family, which his son couldn't have cared any less about. All he wanted was his dad's time, and to feel his dad's love.One year later, Charlie builds a snowman and starts playing the harmonica that his dad had given him and had told him was a magic harmonica. Not long after, Charlie is greeted by a walking, talking snowman. Initially, Charlie is scared of it (who has ever had a snowman talk to them), and he tries to melt the snowman. Soon, Charlie realizes that his dad, who he loves with all his heart has come back to try and make things right with him. In the end, Jack makes things right with his family, particularly his son. The few hours that Jack and Charlie spend together make up for a lot of lost time, and Charlie finally gets to feel all of his dad's love all at once. The end is awesome, and I think the Bob Carlisle song ""Father's Love"" was very appropriate. The only change I would have made is that I would play that song during the final moments that Charlie spends with his dad before he has to say good-bye.Everyone turned in an awesome performance in this film, but Michael Keaton and Joseph Cross stole the show with their scene at the end of the movie. Those two seemed like a real father and son. Kelly Preston turned in an awesome performance as Charlie's mom. Those three seemed like a real family, and like they'd known each other their whole lives.

510648,A25F53TXHRHEVK,B00001IVEC,lovehitzalot,"[2, 3]","Jack Frost is a delightful, touching, and magical Christmas movie for the family. It begins with a father named Jack Frost (played by the wonderful Michael Keaton). Though he has very good intentions and so much love for his family (his wife Gabby played by the lovely Kelly Preston and talented newcomer Joseph Cross plays son Charlie), the demands on his time at the onset of his musical career cause him to miss out on a lot of time with them as well as important events in his son's life. The movie doesn't make Jack out to be a bad father/husband. It's apparent in his interactions/conversations with his wife and son that he's not unaware of what he's missing, he regrets it, and he's really trying to make it better (with realistic commitments set upon him by his job-relatable to all of us). The family dynamic here is truly special as they openly discuss their issues/feelings (without it being cheesy, since the dialogue is so witty and concise). Ever supportive, the family tries to work out plans so that Jack can live out his dreams (very important too) without missing out on his family life at the same time. These early scenes produce some of the greatest laughs of the movie, in my opinion. The dialogue is clever and honest. Also, despite the fact that we know this is going to turn into a snowman movie shortly, some of these moments within the family rank up for me among the most genuine and touching that I've ever seen in a family film.So, Jack must miss out on Christmas morning with his family so he can travel with his band to a gig in order to get signed to a record deal. Halfway there, Jack decides he's made the wrong decision and heads home to surprise his wife and son. Tragically, he meets an untimely end on the way there. Now we cut to one year later and Charlie is a changed little boy. Still a sweet young man, he's understandably filled with deep sadness and disappointment over the loss. When it hits him the hardest, he goes out to build a snowman like he did with his father the year before and then blows on a ""magic harmonica"" that Jack had pretended he would always be able to hear.

It's more about a man named Jack Frost, played by Michael Keaton, dying and coming back to life as a snowman to make up for his past mistakes.  Like in some other movies, I found the explanation for this phenomenon to be lackluster at best.  Come on, the harmonica happens to be magic after Jack Frost had said as much while meaning it as a joke?  Pretty weak.  But I suppose it can work for younger kids.  Problem is, I doubt kids young enough to accept this will not be age-appropriate for this film, what with the death, bullies, grief, etc.  But despite the reasons, Keaton brought a fair amount of life to the snowman, making more than just a snowy creation.  Unfortunately, Keaton's was by far the best performance here with Joseph Cross taking a somewhat distance second.  Too many cast members seemed to just be going through the motions of making the movie rather than actually acting.  Also, some character's changes of heart were sudden and jarring and therefore just didn't make sense.  But ultimately, it's a kids' film, so kids might get more out of it than me.

To me, it's not really a Christmas movie, but more of a family film that could be watched around Christmas time. (If that makes any sense.) A musician named Jack Frost spends too much time with his music, than with his son and smokin' hot wife. He gives his son, Charlie a harmonica that he says is magic. When Jack has to leave on Christmas Eve, his son gets mad and gives him back the harmonica. Jack changes his mind and decides to go back. While driving, he has a terrible accident and dies. A year later, we see how Charlie and his smokin' hot mom deal with the pain. It's actually quite sad to think about having no dad at Christmas time. Charlie builds a snowman just for the heck of it, and later plays his dad's harmonica. Jack comes back, but in the body of the snowman. Throughout the film, Charlie and Jack have fun and get into misadventures. Until it gets hot, Charlie tries to save his dad from the heat, but Jack knows that he only came back to temporarily for a 2nd chance.

He had me read it to him at bedtime.  When I was reading the ending to him, I looked over and saw tears in his eyes.  That created the same effect in me and I immediately decided that we WOULD see the movie.  It must have been a slow night at the theatre complex because my son and I were the only two watching the movie that night.  It certainly added to the special feelings we both had for the movie.  Obviously, the VHS was under the Christmas tree next year.With all that, why did I only rate it 4 stars?  Well, as a movie, it doesn't quite earn its' place among the classics.

It's about an aspiring musician, Jack Frost (Michael Keaton) who is struggling relationships with his loving wife, Gaby (Kelly Preston), and 12-year-old son, Charlie (Joseph Cross) because his band is keeping him from spending quality time with them. Then, on Christmas, Jack finds out that his band just got a record deal but they have to leave to go to a party so the record label can hear them play. And he had already made plans to spend Christmas with his family. He goes off, but then decides to head home again because he doesn't want to miss Christmas with his family. On the way home, however, it starts snowing really hard and he gets into a car accident and dies.Exactly a year later, Gaby and Charlie and still struggling from the loss of Jack. Charlie goes outside his house one night and tries to make a snowman the way he made one with his father the year before. Suddenly, a few hours later, the snowman comes to life after Charlie plays the hermonica his father had given to him. Jack is given a second chance (even though he comes back to life in the form of the snowman Charlie built) to prove to Charlie and his wife that he can be a dedicated loving father and husband.JACK FROST is a really fun and delightful family film. It's for all ages (though really young children may find the death of Jack Frost a little tense). Through all the humor, there is a tender, touching message. It's a little sad at the end, too. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. I was surprised that Michael Keaton could sing - he does it very well, even if he was trained for it during the filming. The supporting cast also includes Andy Lawerence, who plays Charlie's best friend. The actor who really shines in this film isn't actually Michael Keaton or Kelly Preston - but it's Joseph Cross (WIDE AWAKE), who plays the son.This film may look a little cheesy, but it really isn't.

Now they can do all the things they've missed when Jack was human, but what will people think when they see Charlie talking to a snowman and what will happen when the weather gets warmer?This harmless fantasy was unfairly maligned by the majority of critics upon its release, some of whom gave it no or one star in their rating.

Kelly Preston is, of course, gorgeous as the mom, but Joseph Cross as son Charlie is a little weak.You could certainly do worse for a holiday movie, but at the same time you could also do much better.",3,AN OK BUT ULTIMATELY FORGETTABLE HOLIDAY FILM,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,1163,"['Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'one', 'horror', 'film', 'killer', 'snowman', 'same', 'name', 'Christmas', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'magic', 'cheer', 'make', 'become', 'one', 'movies', 'want', 'view', 'annually.Jack', 'Frost', 'Blues', 'singer', 'who', 'road', 'most', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'son', 'Charlie', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'When', 'Jack', 'car', 'accident', 'Charlie', 'very', 'sad', 'young', 'man', 'Jack', 'snowman', 'Now', 'can', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'human', 'what', 'will', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'see', 'Charlie', 'talking', 'snowman', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'weather', 'warmer', 'harmless', 'fantasy', 'was', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'majority', 'critics', 'release', 'whom', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'nothing', 'original', 'here', 'terms', 'themes', 'ideas', 'plenty', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'own', 'terms', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'course', 'gorgeous', 'mom', 'Joseph', 'Cross', 'son', 'Charlie', 'little', 'weak.You', 'could', 'certainly', 'do', 'worse', 'holiday', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'much', 'better']",Jack Frost
510695,A1ZTSOBAPOWT3,B00001IVEC,Timotee,"[5, 5]","Christmas time is for giving. But unfortunately for the Frost family, Dad's not coming home. After a car accident, ""Jack Frost"" (Michael Keaton) is reincarnated as a snowman! He comes back to spend some quality time with his grieving family, his wife Gabby and son Charlie (Kelly Preston and Joseph Cross). While bonding with his boy, the two join forces to battle the local bullies at school with torpedo snowballs and massive sled chases. It was pure superiority! Gabby learns how to live without her husband and becomes an independent, single mother. Jack's motives were clearly dauntless. Charlie gained confidence as well and stood up against the evil snowboarders. Jazz music has never sounded better with the talent of Michael Keaton singing. This movie is an inspiration for anybody and is a masterpiece that should be experienced every Christmas. People watch the ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" but they forget the true adroitness of this refined family picture. Some people may even be afraid of building snowmen after watching this movie. It's just freaky that a snowman can talk and boogy with his kid. Oh, he's the coolest dad now, get it!? ... This movie really does deliver life changing messages that should not be taken granted for. Family bonding is an important value everyone should cherish. I praise this movie. Surely, this is Michael Keaton's finest performance since ""Batman"" and Kelly Preston is an idolic figure for any single mother. Just think if you have it bad now, just see how Gabby dealt with her late husband being a snowman. So, why don't you sit down with your family and build a fire, but be sure you don't have a snowman around. No melting. Love is the key and I can't emphasize that enough. This movie shows the true meaning of Christmas.
