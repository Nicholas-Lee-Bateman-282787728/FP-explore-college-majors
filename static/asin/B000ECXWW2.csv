In THE DARK, Fawcett goes for more of a haunting sense of building dread and ultimate doom.

Sean Bean (Silent Hill, Lord Of The Rings) is his familiar, consternated self as the husband / father, James.

971654,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000ECXWW2,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","After watching the first five minutes, I thought, &#34;Haven't I seen this film before?&#34;  And then I realized that I hadn't.  It just seemed like it was a rip off of &#34;Half Light&#34; (HL) with Demi Moore.But then again, it appears that &#34;The Dark&#34; (TD) came out a year before HL so maybe it was the other way around.  But either way, if you're going to rip off a movie, wouldn't it be a good idea to rip off a good film instead of a very-mediocre-at-best one?But I will admit, I really did like the cinematography and scenery here.  I believe that HL was filmed in Ireland, while TD was filmed in Wales.  Wow; there's a big difference right there.  And this is (I believe) the first film in which I've seen Sophie Stuckey.  I thought, &#34;Well, if you're going to rip off another film, why not rip off another actress?  Or at least give her a part because she looks like another actress.&#34;  Yes; she suspiciously reminds me of a younger Scarlett Johannson, not that that's a bad thing though.  Woody Allen, are you reading or listening?  Perhaps you have your future star!I did believe that the first act did have promise, but this film unfortunately begins to drown in the second.  Without giving much away, there is a ghost that appears there -- with a real spooky voice!  Scary! -- and I actually started laughing.  Luckily, I was watching this at home instead of the theater; but then again, more than likely, this was a straight-2-DVD endeavor so maybe it never played in the theater?And I would probably recommend against playing this in your house as well.  Unless of course, it is on &#34;free&#34; TV, which it was for me.  And I was free to turn it off just before the third act began, which I did, and which I'd recommend.

What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how ""creepy"" it was, and I just didn't feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me.  Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously nave and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C'mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn't really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what's wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that's enough?!?! There aren't any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don't understand Hollywood's obsession right now with creepy children, it's an echo of the days of ""the bad seed"" and ""the omen"" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no ""oomph"".

The result is way out of the ordinary with an ending that blows you out of your socks. The characters are fully fleshed out with Maria Bello giving an outstanding performance as the mother you just love to hate: mean-spirited, selfish, you choose your own term.The horrid little creature that is her daughter is as loathsome as the girl who returns is sympathetic, a victim of her father's insanity. Until the point comes when you realise that this is not quite the case...The only downside of this beautifully crafted film is the ubiquitous Sean Bean who, like Michael Caine, never seems to turn down work. Even so, his is a solid performance. As unlikable as the characters are, do they really deserve their fate?This is a gritty and thoroughly unnerving picture. The photography is exceptional, particularly in the ""Anwyn"" sequences - the real horror of which is entirely in the presentation.

And as far as the rather silly content goes, it is a better than average Halloween season tidbit.  Despite some good ideas dealing with old Welsh mythology, the plot wears thin and spends most of the film's time in dark and tiresome explorations of dank rooms in a cottage by the sea.  The sea is the main character and serves the movie well.Adapted from the novel 'Sheep' by Simon Maginn, the squeaky screenplay by  Stephen Massicotte has a very simple plot idea dealing with a legend that in Wales a dead person enters a purgatory-like place called Annwyn, a mythological place humans can enter spiritually or corporeally, and can be redeemed by the sacrifice of a living being willing to die as the payment for the return of the dead person.  Darkly secret veiled Ad&egrave;le (Maria Bello) and her troubled daughter Sarah (Sophie Stuckey) visit husband/father James (Sean Bean) who has followed his loner dream and escaped to Wales, living in an old haunted house where once dwelled the Shepherd, a leader or a religious sect not unlike the Jamestown group.  Knowing that the sect jumped of the nearby cliff so that the Shepherd's daughter could be restored, the current action mimics the past and to reveal which characters are involved in which way would be detrimental to the viewer, depriving what little surprises there are in this overlong film.John Fawcett directs a strong cast who are required little range of emotion.  But oh, the scenery!

971666,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B000ECXWW2,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[1, 1]","In recent years, this new chick flick styled horror has sprung up. The Grudge, The Ring, Darkness, and The Dark. This 2005 British production adds a few new twists to the genre, but doesn't take the next step in standing out amid such similar films.After separating from her artist husband James (Sean Bean), Adelle (Maria Bello) travels to Wales with daughter Sarah (Sophie Stuckey) for a visit. Things have been tough between the ladies, but the Welsh countryside seems good for the reuniting family. The area is full of mysterious buildings, cult legends, and lovely beaches and cliffs. Unfortunately, Sarah vanishes on the beach. While James and local handyman Dafydd (Maurice Roeves) lead a massive search, Adelle discovers a strange girl named Ebril (Abigail Stone) now living in their home.Okay, so the chick flick horror genre really began with Jamie Lee Curtis and Halloween, but this recent trend of chick horror always has the same key pieces: An American woman in a foreign country with a child somehow involved in said horror. The Dark brings a nice twist with its Welsh mythology, but there isn't much time invested in this notion. Two scenes of the staple `talking to the old person who was there' and the standard `lost journal/internet/microfilm' montage set the intrigue but doesn't take what makes The Dark unique far enough.Maria Bello (A History of Violence, ER) is finely cast as the not so perfect mother on a quest to find her missing daughter. She's the right style; a bit edgy, off her rocker, yet hip, blonde rocker chick. Bello does fine, and it's a strong role for what is odd to say an `older maternal' part as compared to a teeny sexy chick part. The Dark, however, is not going to make Maria Bello a movie star anytime soon. Nothing ill against her, but everyone does the foreign low budget horror flick at some point. The Dark isn't bad, just meh. Naomi Watts, Sarah Michelle Gellar, aren't they all the same?Likewise I am curious why Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings) took two so similar parts within a year. Silent Hill and The Dark are very much the same vein, and Bean plays the searching, protective father in both. Odd that he has come down to independent horror features after such success with The Fellowship of the Ring. However, after seeing him in so many villainous roles, it is nice to see the softer side of Bean. (My husband kept suspecting he was someone involved in the evil!) Still, I can't help but chuckle during his scenes with Sophie Stuckey and Abigail Stone. Do these little girls know who he is? Were they afraid of him? Don't they say to never work with kids or dogs?There is no question, however, about the lovely locations in The Dark. The stunningly beautiful yet violent and creepy cliffs and oceans onscreen add to the parental fear of the leads. My goodness how do British people really live so close to these cliffs without fearing their kids are going to plummet? This realistic filming adds to the creepiness of the abattoir. Based upon the novel Sheep by Simon Maginn, the animals are also a bit freaky; Herds of sheep surrounding folks, looking at people and baa-ing. The Dark shows promise with these foreign and weird touches, but it's not enough.I suppose the biggest question is this: Is The Dark scary? First viewing; maybe. Bean and Bello fans will tune in for sure, but those made to jump moments are now so commonplace that the spooks don't work. Television Director John Fawcett's (Xena, Queer as Folk, Taken) jagged abattoir flashbacks, cliff plummets, and otherworldly Annwn hell-like filming make great strides and look very cool, but don't top what's already been done onscreen.Outside of a few f-bombs, I don't see why The Dark is rated R. The child torture scenes are mild compared to other films, and the blood and gore isn't heavy. Maybe European audiences prefer the parental struggles and life versus death debates, but us Americans want Blood! Gore! Sex! And we want it Now!The Dark does nothing wrong, in fact its foreign and mature takes add to the film, not detract. The Dark is good. I've watched it several times, I'd watch it again, and I recommended The Dark to my horror loving husband. Too many similar films and not enough umph unfortunately give The Dark a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and familiarity instead of nail biting horror.Although the dvd only offers one extra-an alternate ending that isn't too shocking-if you're looking for a bit of weird and creepy, The Dark is an affordable show without too much commitment.",3,"Good, and freaky sheep",1229299200,"12 15,

Not only did I have this immediate reaction to the end of the movie but even after I was done watching it, the ending lingered with me for quite some time, sending chills down my spine.There's more to the movie than just the end. In the beginning, places of the movie feel almost like Silent Hill, but once it starts going, it develops its own personality. In it, a troubled mother and daughter travel to Wales in order to visit the child's father. He is renovating a home, formerly occupied by a reverend who commanded his congregation to kill themselves. When the couple's daughter disappears, they will stop at nothing to get her back, even if that means unraveling the past, and learning why a girl that should have been dead more than 50 years ago has found a way to return.Some of the plot is a bit contrived, and some of the suspense is odd instead of scary. However, most of the film is very well done, and on a psychological level it is utterly terrifying.

The approach of the film, especially to begin with, resembles that of classics like Don't Look Now, or Picnic at Hanging Rock -- above all, the strangeness of the circumstances and the fear they invoke mirror the psychological turmoil of the characters -- and, as with those films, the hints at a deeper supernatural mystery are nicely balanced with the growing anxiety of the characters.  That is true, at least, until the latter quarter of the film when it gives in to the supernatural and to the twists and turns of more mainstream scary fare and begins to seem more like, say, The Skeleton Key.  Maria Bello gives her usual strong performance and, while he has less to do, Sean Bean is convincing as a distraught and loving father and estranged husband.  The real star of the film, though, is the cinematographer and crew: the colors of the Welch coast are both beautiful and evocative of a deep and mythical past; the anxiety of the characters and the power of the ocean when they are looking for a drowning girl is captured by the frantic, but not shaky, movements of the camera; the look of ""the dark"" (you'll know it when you see it), is both subtle and believable.

So it seemed to me that Fawcett directing an adaptation of Simon Maginn's stellar novel Sheep was a guaranteed shot out of the park. That was unfortunately not the case, thanks mostly to Stephen Massicotte (Ginger Snaps Back)'s screenplay, but it certainly doesn't deserve the oblivion it has been relegated to in the years since its release.James (Sean Bean, recently of Silent Hill) and Adele (The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor's Maria Bello) have recently lost their daughter Sarah, who drowned. Soon after, where they are visited by Ebril (Abigail Stone in her first screen role), a girl who claims to have drowned sixty years before. Could this be the spirit, or the reincarnation, of Sarah?The concept of Annwn is not unknown to Americans, thanks mostly to Lloyd Alexander's tales of Taran, steeped in the same mythology that guides The Dark.  And since the movie was made for a British audience, you'd think they'd have done something a bit more advanced than Annwn 101. Yet that's pretty much what we get here, and the balance that comes from the tension in the novel is erased (there's one scene, especially, that's noticeably absent from the film that worked very, very well in the book, the midnight flight to the doctor's house).  Plotwise, this one feels almost phoned in. Yet Fawcett's distinct sense of atmosphere remains in this movie, even when it goes far, far over the edge of cheesiness in its climax. Fawcett knows how to create a scene, and he does it as well here as he ever has; pity there's so little substance to go with the style.

At least 'The Dark' has great scenery!  The plot is pretty standard (and very much like the aforementioned 'Silent Hill'): an American mother brings her daughter to Wales to visit her father, an artist, who lives in suitably remote and rather creepy cottage.  Maria Bello's Adele is not the most sympathetic mother; in flashbacks, she's not the best caretaker for her child, and we see that the Welsh trip is an attempt for a ""second chance"" with her daughter.  Of course, in the dark upper story of the cottage, there's a secret, and, like many films of this kind ('The Ring' is another good example), the mother's devotion to saving her child takes her into what appears to be madness.  At times, the film is literally so 'dark', it's hard to tell what's happening; I like creepy, but when you have to rewind a scene to try to see it clearly, that destroys the suspense. There is, of course, the requisite twist at the end (who's really alive, good, come back from the dead, etc), and at least Sean Bean has a little more to do here than in 'Silent Hill'!

971686,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ECXWW2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In spite of its creepy atmosphere and clever psychological subtest, `The Dark' fails to truly scare us as a whole because of its formulaic storytelling in its first half, and the clever but confusing narrative in the second. I'm not saying the film is a total failure, but after watching recent horror films inspired or influenced by Asian and Spanish horrors (like `The Ring'), `The Dark' seems to lack something intriguing in its narrative to draw us into the occult world it tries to present to us.Still the story begins promisingly when a mother Adele (Maria Bello) and her daughter Sarah arrives at a remote house by the sea in Wales, where Sarah's estranged father James (Sean Bean) lives alone. On their way, however, the two travelers find something weird by the cliff. It could be a monolith or gravestone, on which a strange word is curved in Welsh, and Adele just cannot shake off uneasy premonition since then. Actually something very bad happens, and the girl really goes missing.[TOO FAMILIAR SCARE TACTICS] John Fawcett (known for his much better `Ginger Snaps') continues his story with the mother's lonely and desperate battle to take back her daughter she knows she should have cared more. The story itself is interesting together with her fear of losing the daughter to James suggested in the beginning, but the problems is, for all the eerie atmosphere of the seaside or the local history, what Adele does is in fact much more unbelievable than the story of the cursed videotape of `The Ring' (with which `The Dark' shares some elements). Moreover, the films relies on clich&eacute;d items like haunted little girl, character researching in the library, or dream sequences. To make matters worse, the busy editing sometimes fail to show what is going on there.But the real reason I was hugely disappointed with `The Dark' is probably that the film is not emotionally involving at all. The missing daughter is not particularly a nice girl, and what should we care if she goes missing in the film? Or how about her mother who ill-treats her in flashbacks? As the film gets closer to the end, however, Maria Bello with her powerful acting manages to make us care, and that's why the film ending (original or alternate alike) works. But sadly, the film is almost over by then.",2,Some Creepy Images Damaged by Confusing Story and Uninvolving Characters,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2292,"['spite', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'clever', 'psychological', 'subtest', 'Dark', 'fails', 'truly', 'scare', 'whole', 'formulaic', 'storytelling', 'first', 'half', 'clever', 'confusing', 'narrative', 'second', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'total', 'failure', 'watching', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'inspired', 'influenced', 'Asian', 'Spanish', 'horrors', 'Ring', 'Dark', 'lack', 'something', 'intriguing', 'narrative', 'draw', 'occult', 'world', 'present', 'us.Still', 'story', 'promisingly', 'when', 'mother', 'Adele', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'remote', 'house', 'sea', 'Wales', 'where', 'Sarah', 'estranged', 'father', 'James', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'alone', 'way', 'however', 'two', 'travelers', 'find', 'something', 'weird', 'cliff', 'could', 'be', 'monolith', 'gravestone', 'strange', 'word', 'curved', 'Welsh', 'Adele', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'off', 'uneasy', 'premonition', 'then', 'Actually', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'happens', 'girl', 'really', 'missing', '[', 'TOO', 'FAMILIAR', 'SCARE', 'TACTICS', ']', 'John', 'Fawcett', 'known', 'much', 'better', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'story', 'mother', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'battle', 'take', 'back', 'daughter', 'should', 'have', 'cared', 'more', 'story', 'interesting', 'together', 'fear', 'losing', 'daughter', 'James', 'suggested', 'beginning', 'problems', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'seaside', 'local', 'history', 'what', 'Adele', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'cursed', 'videotape', 'Ring', 'Dark', 'shares', 'elements', 'Moreover', 'films', 'relies', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'items', 'haunted', 'little', 'girl', 'character', 'researching', 'library', 'dream', 'sequences', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'busy', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'fail', 'show', 'what', 'going', 'real', 'reason', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'Dark', 'probably', 'film', 'not', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'missing', 'daughter', 'not', 'particularly', 'nice', 'girl', 'what', 'should', 'care', 'missing', 'film', 'how', 'mother', 'who', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'closer', 'end', 'however', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'powerful', 'acting', 'manages', 'make', 'care', 'why', 'film', 'ending', 'original', 'alternate', 'alike', 'sadly', 'film', 'almost', 'then']",N/A
