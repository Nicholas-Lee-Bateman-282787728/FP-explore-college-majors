1320006,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B0033HKBQK,A_Plain_Janeite,"[45, 46]","First, to rate the show-- it fully deserves 5 stars!  It's definitely one of my (few) favorite current shows I watch.  I actually first saw the show on the ""CW Network"" in the US in late 2010, and soon afterwards caught up on all the episodes posted online (FYI, the CW network is no longer airing episodes in the US, only GMCTV).Now, I'm current, and am awaiting the new season 6 which airs on the CBC in Canada!**EDIT: There WILL be a Season 7 sometime around Sept. 2013!**_____________In regards to the dvd set I received:This is the mistake I just figured out tonight (AFTER I removed the wrapper & discs)...  At the very bottom (the last sentence) on the back cover, it states: ""Please Note: This Package Contains Episodes 23 To 45 Of Heartland As Seen On GMCTV"".I went online and compared the original CBC/Canadian lineup with the episodes named in the ""GMCTV's Completed Second Season"" set, and figured out that it is in fact season 2 episode 10 to season 3 episode 14 (so it's missing episodes 14 to 22 if you're like me and own the original Canadian set of the ""Complete Season One"").FYI, Heartland in Canada has had an 18 episode run for seasons 2 to 5.Upon further checking with different online retailers, I'm wondering if the Canadian releases are being phased out (it's getting harder and harder to find them on Amazon US, and even on eBay, even Amazon CA is selling these sets).  Although season 5 is set to release on Sept. 18 on Amazon.ca .To sum it up, you CAN'T mix and match the releases (otherwise you will be missing episodes)!!  Decide if you want the first run/Canadian dvd's (which as I noted earlier- they appear to be phasing out), OR wait longer for GMCTV to release theirs (if they're just now beginning to air the middle of season 3 as the insert said, they may release their next set at the end of this year or early next.)_______P.S. I contacted Amazon to ask which version they're selling currently, because under product details it lists ""DVD Release Date: June 5, 2012""; so if they are selling the ""GMC"" labeled one, the picture needs to be changed to avoid any further confusion (the new picture has Amy & Ty, with wild horses in the background, and of course the orange bar with ""As Seen On GMC"")!The reply was: ""I'll notify our catalog team about this and will ask them to correct the error. You'll see the change in 5-7 business days. We need to be able to verify the accuracy of new information from multiple sources.""",5,"BE ADVISED: ""GMC"" Release Is Season 2: Ep. 10 to Season 3: Ep. 14",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,2458,"['First', 'rate', 'show', 'fully', '5', 'stars', 'definitely', 'one', 'few', 'favorite', 'current', 'shows', 'watch', 'actually', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'CW', 'Network', 'US', 'late', '2010', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'caught', 'up', 'episodes', 'posted', 'online', 'FYI', 'CW', 'network', 'no', 'longer', 'airing', 'episodes', 'US', 'only', 'GMCTV', '.Now', ""'m"", 'current', 'am', 'awaiting', 'new', 'season', '6', 'airs', 'CBC', 'Canada', '**EDIT', 'WILL', 'be', 'Season', '7', 'sometime', 'Sept', '2013', '**_____________In', 'regards', 'dvd', 'set', 'received', 'mistake', 'just', 'figured', 'out', 'tonight', 'AFTER', 'removed', 'wrapper', 'discs', 'very', 'bottom', 'last', 'sentence', 'back', 'cover', 'Please', 'Note', 'Package', 'Episodes', '23', '45', 'Heartland', 'As', 'Seen', 'GMCTV', '.I', 'went', 'online', 'compared', 'original', 'CBC/Canadian', 'lineup', 'episodes', 'named', 'GMCTV', 'Completed', 'Second', 'Season', 'set', 'figured', 'out', 'fact', 'season', '2', 'episode', '10', 'season', '3', 'episode', '14', 'missing', 'episodes', '14', '22', ""'re"", 'own', 'original', 'Canadian', 'set', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One', '.FYI', 'Heartland', 'Canada', 'had', '18', 'episode', 'run', 'seasons', '2', '5.Upon', 'further', 'checking', 'different', 'online', 'retailers', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'Canadian', 'releases', 'are', 'being', 'phased', 'out', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'Amazon', 'US', 'even', 'eBay', 'even', 'Amazon', 'CA', 'selling', 'sets', 'season', '5', 'set', 'release', 'Sept.', '18', 'Amazon.ca', '.To', 'sum', 'up', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'mix', 'match', 'releases', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'episodes', 'Decide', 'want', 'first', 'run/Canadian', 'dvd', 'noted', 'earlier-', 'appear', 'be', 'phasing', 'OR', 'wait', 'longer', 'GMCTV', 'release', ""'re"", 'just', 'now', 'beginning', 'air', 'middle', 'season', '3', 'insert', 'said', 'may', 'release', 'next', 'set', 'end', 'year', 'early', 'next.', '_______P.S', 'contacted', 'Amazon', 'ask', 'version', ""'re"", 'selling', 'currently', 'product', 'details', 'DVD', 'Release', 'Date', 'June', '5', '2012', 'so', 'are', 'selling', 'GMC', 'labeled', 'one', 'picture', 'be', 'changed', 'avoid', 'further', 'confusion', 'new', 'picture', 'Amy', 'Ty', 'wild', 'horses', 'background', 'course', 'orange', 'bar', 'Seen', 'GMC', 'reply', 'was', ""'ll"", 'notify', 'catalog', 'team', 'will', 'ask', 'correct', 'error', ""'ll"", 'see', 'change', '5-7', 'business', 'days', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'verify', 'accuracy', 'new', 'information', 'multiple', 'sources']",N/A
