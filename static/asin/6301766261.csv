I have always enjoyed the performances of Jeff Fahey and Theresa Russell, separately, in their own respective careers, but in ""Impulse"" they are dynamite together.  They have palpable chemistry that makes the film work. Their sex scene when they first get together was very hot, and very real. Good plot, good directing by Sondra Locke, good acting by Fahey, Russell, and a capable supporting cast.

264649,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6301766261,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[14, 14]","The alluring Theresa Russell has made a healthy film career out of playing prostitutes (one of her films was actually titled WHORE). In IMPULSE, also starring Jeff Fahey, Russell plays Lottie, an undercover cop who most often poses as---you guessed it---a prostitute.Russell is hot onscreen, so hot the screen melts, even when she plays it straight. As an actress, she has a lock on the confused inner motivations of good girls gone bad or bad girls trying to be good, and it's hard to take your eyes off of her, not at least partially because she's engaging and imbues her emotionally conflicted characters with both depth and pathos.Lottie poses as the hook in a major drug bust being managed by FBI agent Fahey who promptly falls into bed and in love with her. Lottie reacts typically---although she disdains this ""nice guy,"" she yearns toward him as well.Lottie's career is on the skids. In counseling and under Internal Affairs scrutiny, after a particularly brutal shootout, she impulsively goes over the line while having a drink in some bar and accompanies a stranger home for money. She reconsiders before her shoes get kicked under the bed, but while she makes her exit, this boyfriend d'jour is the victim of a hit. The circumstances of course compromise Lottie, who finds she can't tell the straight-shooting Fahey the full truth. Enter George Dzundza (Lieutenant Morgan) the embittered cop with a grudge against Lottie, who delights in sabotaging the Fahey-Russell relationship.The chemistry between Fahey and Russell is palpable and the acting is excellent despite the overall ""B"" movie atmosphere. Russell's characterization is surprisingly strong, and the story doesn't let go until the credits roll.Far better than you'd expect, IMPULSE delivers, and comes well recommended.",5,"""I didn't know what I was doing there...""",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1791,"['alluring', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'made', 'healthy', 'film', 'career', 'playing', 'prostitutes', 'one', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'titled', 'WHORE', 'IMPULSE', 'also', 'starring', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'Russell', 'Lottie', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'most', 'often', 'as', 'guessed', '-a', 'prostitute.Russell', 'hot', 'onscreen', 'so', 'hot', 'screen', 'melts', 'even', 'when', 'straight', 'actress', 'lock', 'confused', 'inner', 'motivations', 'good', 'girls', 'gone', 'bad', 'bad', 'girls', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'not', 'least', 'partially', 'engaging', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'depth', 'pathos.Lottie', 'poses', 'hook', 'major', 'drug', 'bust', 'being', 'managed', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Fahey', 'who', 'promptly', 'bed', 'love', 'Lottie', 'typically', 'nice', 'guy', 'well.Lottie', 'career', 'skids', 'counseling', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'scrutiny', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'shootout', 'impulsively', 'line', 'having', 'drink', 'bar', 'stranger', 'home', 'money', 'shoes', 'get', 'kicked', 'bed', 'exit', 'boyfriend', ""d'jour"", 'victim', 'hit', 'circumstances', 'course', 'compromise', 'Lottie', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'straight-shooting', 'Fahey', 'full', 'truth', 'Enter', 'George', 'Dzundza', 'Lieutenant', 'Morgan', 'embittered', 'cop', 'grudge', 'Lottie', 'who', 'sabotaging', 'Fahey-Russell', 'relationship.The', 'chemistry', 'Fahey', 'Russell', 'palpable', 'acting', 'excellent', 'overall', 'B', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'Russell', 'characterization', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'story', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'roll.Far', 'better', ""'d"", 'expect', 'IMPULSE', 'delivers', 'well', 'recommended']",Impulse VHS

264654,A3AY1AO8U0IUV3,6301766261,"Smrz ""smrz""","[3, 3]","Impulse(1990) is a stylish neo-noir that delivers good action with underlying layers of deception. It displays Russell's finest performance that captures the conflicts within her playing L.A.'s best undercover vice cop. It is indeed about time that it is now on dvd so that fans of both neo-noir,as well as police action-thrillers, can fully appreciate this underrated film. Russel plays Lottie Mason, who, is wild, dangerous, and kinky. Lottie is constantly in conflict with her job in vice and her real straight identity as an honest cop. When we first see Lottie walking down Hollywood Boulevard, we are also drawn to the decay of this side of Hollywood, with streets at night drenched with the rain-soaked neon signs of the cheap hotels that line the Boulevard. Lottie is dressed in a skin-tight, vinyl mini-dress with stiletto heels playing a prostitute. Her job is to lure men and then call in reinforcements after the ""john"" commits a bookable offense. Therein lies the perpetual conflict that Lottie faces every day and night. As an officer of the law, she is supposed to be honest and ""good"". But her job in vice demands that She be deceptive and ""bad"". Russel captures the never-ending conflict very well, both in her actions, as well as in her face and body. So this constant conflict captures Lottie as she teeters on the very thin line separating her life as a cop from the lurid, tantalizing life of neon glitz. As the film moves forward, it captures the toll that it takes on Lottie, especially evident in her face and body language. When Lottie stumbles into a situation in which she finds a key to a locker where she finds a suitcase with one million dollars in cold cash, she is once again caught in a cinflict as whether or not to keep the cash or play it straight and turn it in to the authorities. I will not reveal the twisted ending here so as not to ""spoil"" the finale. As I said before, Russell is indeed excellent here in capturing the never-ending conflict within herself. I found her co-star, Jeff Fahey, who plays the assistant D. A., rather weak as Lottie's love interest, and the only times that the film bogs down is their scenes together. As the police lieutenant who has strong feelings towards Lottie, George Dzundza, is much more convincing in his twisted role. The Film is 109 minutes long and the transfer to widescreen is very good. The movie was directed by Sondra Locke. As I said before, it is good to finally see this on dvd. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
