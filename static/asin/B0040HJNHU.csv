1379252,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0040HJNHU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","First thing first, I must offer South Africa's ""White Wedding"" a little bit of tough love.  A road comedy about the potential pratfalls and pitfalls on a cross country journey toward impending nuptials, ""White Wedding"" has had the unfortunate honor of being compared to ""The Hangover"" by a couple of critics.  Furthermore, these proclamations loom large on the DVD packaging.  Why is being compared to one of the biggest comedies in recent history bad?  A great question.  Anyone bamboozled into expecting the raucous humor of ""The Hangover"" will undoubtedly be confounded.  Don't get me wrong, ""White Wedding"" certainly has its gentle comedic charms but ""The Hangover"" quip will certainly set up expectations in the viewer that the film will never be able to fulfill.That said, ""White Wedding"" is more likely to appeal to fans of the romantic comedy genre.  It tells the story of a groom making his way across South Africa for his wedding party in Cape Town.  Accompanying him on the journey are his misogynistic best friend and an English woman they encounter in their travels.  The bride, meanwhile, is dealing with drama of her own--her mother's expectations for the big day differ from her vision and a successful ex has reentered the picture.  Needless to say, the road trip aspect of ""White Wedding"" hits plenty of obstacles which leaves both the ceremony and the bride's feelings in jeopardy.  While the actors are appealing, however, we never do see the bride and groom as a real couple (they speak perfunctorily during several phone conversations)--so the romantic stakes may be a bit compromised.  While I liked them, the film never really convinced me that it was their destiny to be together.That leaves the comedy.  First, I'll say that I've never seen a trip with less urgency--especially as everything was on such a strict deadline.  Nothing they encounter is particularly outrageous or unique, but the South African setting provided a new perspective.  Race relations and apartheid come into play, get a gentle poke, and get incorporated harmlessly into the feel good nature of ""White Wedding.""  And there's a goat.  I love road trips that involve livestock!  The situation at home plays out a little more believably--and should provide some identifiable chuckles for anyone who has been in similar circumstances dealing with the pressures of a wedding.Mostly, in the end, it is the actors that will sell you on the appeal of ""White Wedding.""  Agreeable and winning, they compensate for some of the rather haphazard and convenient plotting.  I don't think you'll be surprised by the outcome of this ""White Wedding,"" but it's a fitfully entertaining journey--just don't expect ""The Hangover.""  About 3 1/2 stars overall for mild amusements--but I'll round up for the game cast giving it everything!

1379253,A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT,B0040HJNHU,"Linda R. Hendrex ""Rubicon""","[0, 1]","There are so many things I like about WHITE WEDDING.  The characters are cute and interesting, the scenery is beautiful, the storyline is engaging, and the actors are obviously having fun with it all.I especially enjoyed peeking into the languages, customs, and personal interactions of another country.  Even though it is a comedy and some things are most likely exaggerated, I still came away with a connected feeling to the people there, who no longer seem so different from my own experience.  South Africa is so interesting because of their rich and complex history, and recent changeover from apartheid to their present form of government.  Seeing this comedy helped me put some normal, present day structure to all the things I have heard.  One very insightful line in the movie came from an elderly lady who was greeting an old friend after he returned from America, ""Where have you been?  Thank God you're here!  They told me you were in America! I hear there are bombings everywhere, that side.""  It is rare to get some perspective on the feelings and attitudes in a place so far away, and I loved that.All in all, it was a fun, silly, down to earth road trip tale - but it also had heart and depth.  Amid all the farce and buffoonery, this story touched on some very serious themes without ever descending into heavyhanded, self righteous preachiness.  The tone was always hopeful and lighthearted.The scenes and dialoge were relatively ""clean"" - no nudity and very little ""language"".  There was a suggestion of group sex early on, and in context this part of the story was to emphasize a character who had a good heart but had gotten morally lost.  It was not exploitive or glorified, but was done in a comedic way.  It wasn't explicit, but it was clear what was going on, so I wouldn't want to watch it with children. I might have given it 5 stars, but the goup sex scene made me uncomfortable and I wish that this character's moral issues had been illustrated in some more discreet way.  Also, some people might be offended by an interracial romance that occurs in the sub plot, but this storyline was actually very sweet, and I don't think it would be a problem for most folks.  Another potential issue is that the dialogue is only partly in English, with the majority of the speaking done in Xhosa.  The sub titles went by too fast and it was difficult to keep up with what was going on.  In this way, there was some work involved in watching this movie, so it is not appropriate entertainment for someone who is simply in the mood to ""veg out"".I watched it three times (because I missed some of the dialoge due to the language barrier and subtitles), and it was just as much fun the third time as it was the first.  This is saying a LOT because I seldom go back to a movie I have already wached.  I just wish I could see it with a South African so they could fill me in on the details I might have missed and the idioms that I don't understand.  I had to Google the song, ""Delarey"" to get the full significance of the scene where it is played.All said, I thought is was a good movie and highly recommend it.  While not being the best movie I have ever watched, it is certainly very enjoyable.",4,Adventurous and Fun,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,3209,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'WHITE', 'WEDDING', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'interesting', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'storyline', 'engaging', 'actors', 'are', 'obviously', 'having', 'fun', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'peeking', 'languages', 'customs', 'personal', 'interactions', 'country', 'Even', 'comedy', 'things', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'exaggerated', 'still', 'came', 'away', 'connected', 'feeling', 'people', 'there', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'seem', 'so', 'different', 'own', 'experience', 'South', 'Africa', 'so', 'interesting', 'rich', 'complex', 'history', 'recent', 'changeover', 'apartheid', 'present', 'form', 'government', 'Seeing', 'comedy', 'helped', 'put', 'normal', 'present', 'day', 'structure', 'things', 'have', 'heard', 'One', 'very', 'insightful', 'line', 'movie', 'came', 'elderly', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'greeting', 'old', 'friend', 'returned', 'America', 'Where', 'have', 'been', 'Thank', 'God', ""'re"", 'here', 'told', 'were', 'America', 'hear', 'are', 'bombings', 'everywhere', 'side', 'rare', 'get', 'perspective', 'feelings', 'attitudes', 'place', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'loved', 'that.All', 'was', 'fun', 'silly', 'down', 'earth', 'road', 'trip', 'tale', 'also', 'had', 'heart', 'depth', 'Amid', 'farce', 'buffoonery', 'story', 'touched', 'very', 'serious', 'themes', 'ever', 'descending', 'heavyhanded', 'righteous', 'preachiness', 'tone', 'was', 'always', 'hopeful', 'lighthearted.The', 'scenes', 'dialoge', 'were', 'relatively', 'clean', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'language', 'was', 'suggestion', 'group', 'sex', 'early', 'context', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'emphasize', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'heart', 'had', 'gotten', 'morally', 'lost', 'was', 'not', 'exploitive', 'glorified', 'was', 'done', 'comedic', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'was', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'children', 'might', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'goup', 'sex', 'scene', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'wish', 'character', 'moral', 'issues', 'had', 'been', 'illustrated', 'more', 'discreet', 'way', 'Also', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'interracial', 'romance', 'sub', 'plot', 'storyline', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'problem', 'most', 'folks', 'potential', 'issue', 'dialogue', 'only', 'partly', 'English', 'majority', 'speaking', 'done', 'Xhosa', 'sub', 'titles', 'went', 'too', 'fast', 'was', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'way', 'was', 'work', 'involved', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'appropriate', 'entertainment', 'someone', 'who', 'simply', 'mood', 'veg', 'out', '.I', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'missed', 'dialoge', 'due', 'language', 'barrier', 'subtitles', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'first', 'saying', 'LOT', 'seldom', 'go', 'back', 'movie', 'have', 'already', 'wached', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'South', 'African', 'could', 'fill', 'details', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'idioms', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'had', 'Google', 'song', 'Delarey', 'get', 'full', 'significance', 'scene', 'where', 'played.All', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'being', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'certainly', 'very', 'enjoyable']",White Wedding
