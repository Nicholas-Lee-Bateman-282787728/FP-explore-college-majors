696140,A2CAW4NKVFY6I7,B000063V8I,,"[0, 0]","If you're going to buy a children's video for your toddler to watch, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",4,AAP recommends no tv before 2,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1943,"[""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'children', 'video', 'toddler', 'watch', 'means', 'buy', 'video', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'older', 'child', 'highly', 'recommend', 'compared', 'other', 'kids', 'videos', 'engaging', 'fun', 'educational', 'not', 'cartoon', 'animated', 'fast-paced.Having', 'said', 'have', 'beef', 'title', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'marketing', 'BABIES', 'imply', 'watching', 'videos', 'good', 'babies', 'are', 'NOT', 'videos', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'older', 'kids', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'babies', 'brains', 'research', 'found', 'out', '1', 'brain', 'wave', 'activity', 'babies', 'slower', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'sleeping', '2', 'hour', 'television', 'baby', 'day', 'chances', 'acquiring', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'increases', '10', '%', '3', 'hour', 'television', 'viewed', 'daily', '4', 'yrs', 'old', 'significant', 'odds', 'increase', 'being', 'bully', 'later', '4', 'consistent', 'heavy', 'television', 'viewing', 'more', '2', 'hrs', 'daily', 'early', 'childhood', 'can', 'cause', 'behavior', 'sleep', 'attention', 'problems.The', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'television', 'children', '2', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'media', 'tv', 'videos', 'video', 'games', 'computers', 'daily', 'age', '2', 'think', 'important', 'parents', 'caregivers', 'be', 'aware', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'informed', 'choices', 'hope', 'people', 'limit', 'television', 'usage', 'babies', 'look', 'other', 'outlets', 'when', 'possible.For', 'looking', 'calm', 'babies', 'build', 'better', 'brains', 'recommend', 'baby', 'carriers', 'studies', 'show', 'infants', 'who', 'are', 'carried', 'extra', '3', 'hours', 'day', 'cry', '40', '%', 'less', 'effect', 'lasting', 'time', 'Frequently', 'held', 'babies', 'pick', 'up', 'verbal', 'skills', 'faster', 'develop', 'better', 'core', 'muscle', 'strength', 'balance', 'Also', 'learning', 'communicate', 'sign', 'language', 'can', 'reduce', 'frustration', 'tantrums', 'accelerate', 'language', 'development', 'promote', 'parent-child', 'bonding', 'infants', 'toddlers']",N/A

Baby Newton All About Shapes is proabably my most favorite Baby Einstein video (the other 3 good ones are Baby Neptune, Baby Galileo and Numbers Nursery).At the beginning of this video, an animated crayon box tips over and these crayons spill out.  They have faces, arms and legs and run around.  There is a song about shapes, which is real cute and catchy.  The crayons draw a clown.  The clown has parts that are different shapes (circle for his head, triangle for his hat, etc).  The clown ends up becoming this 3-D clown that walks around.  He is really cute.  There ar 5 shapes on the wall (triangle, square, circle, rectangle and oval).  The clown walks to a shape and then there will be all kinds of things about that shape.For circle you'll see bubbles, clocks, owls eyes, a tire swing, a basketball, etc.  For triangle you'll see the Pyramids (this is really cool because it's time-lapsed photography with fast-moving clouds above the pyramids), a sail boat on the ocean (it looks like you are zooming over the ocean and see this sail boat with a triangular sale below you).  It is live-action.  The music is really good too.This video has a purpose behind showing toys and shiny spinning things (unlike most of the other Baby Einstein videos) because they have to do with that particular shape.  This still shows puppets and they are actually cute puppet scenes.  This dvd is so different from your typical Baby Einstein videos because of the animated crayons and the clown.

Interesting....I got the video home and watched it with my daughter, and when you think of the tone of Baby Shakespeare, or Baby Van Gogh...Baby Newton is the EXACT opposite.  It's VERY loud with an obnoxious song called ""I Know My Shapes"" that is sung NOT once, but TWICE in the 30 minute video (This sequence with the clown takes at least five minutes, so just that sequence makes up a third of the whole video).  There is an extreme amount of computer generated graphics, and MUCH less classical music and puppets.  The only time my 2 year old daughter laughs is when she sees the puppets...once at the beginning and once towards the end!!! Julie Clarke sold Baby Einstein to Disney and you can definitely tell.  If you loved her videos because they were quiet and relaxing- those days are long gone.  It seems that from now on Baby Einstein will be just another kids cartoon, ALL computer generated, and no originality or ""real"" anything.",1,VERY DISSAPPOINTING,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,1153,"['eagerly', 'purchased', 'video', 'many', 'other', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'videos', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'others', 'was', 'looking', 'back', 'box', 'noticed', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'made', 'Interesting', '.I', 'got', 'video', 'home', 'watched', 'daughter', 'when', 'think', 'tone', 'Baby', 'Shakespeare', 'Baby', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'Baby', 'Newton', 'EXACT', 'opposite', 'VERY', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'song', 'called', 'Know', 'Shapes', 'sung', 'NOT', 'once', 'TWICE', '30', 'minute', 'video', 'sequence', 'clown', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'just', 'sequence', 'up', 'third', 'whole', 'video', 'extreme', 'amount', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'MUCH', 'less', 'classical', 'music', 'puppets', 'only', 'time', '2', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'when', 'puppets', 'once', 'beginning', 'once', 'end', 'Julie', 'Clarke', 'sold', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Disney', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'loved', 'videos', 'were', 'quiet', 'relaxing-', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'ALL', 'computer', 'generated', 'originality', 'real', 'anything']",N/A

Big Mistake - I was disappointed and so was my daughter.  All the classical music is gone, no more puppet interaction, no more kids on the video.  It is all computer image animation and some very annoying song that is played in full twice during this video. That's it, no more music at all!  Yes, it does show you the initial shapes but then shows you real life pictures of the shapes that a 1 even a 2 year old couldn't pick out.  They are showing briges from afar whoose wires slightly resemble triangles.  Very poor. My 19mo old daughter does know her shapes but not from this video and she was bored FAST! There isn't the interaction of learning from the other videos.  I recommend you stay away from this one.Although all the previous videos they made are good my daughter's favs were Baby Bach and Baby Santa when she was an infant and then she grew into Baby Van Gogh and Baby Dolittle (neighborhood animals) These are the best in my opinion. The Einstein company tried to veer off from what made them famous - this one is too technical for babies/toddlers.

I, personally, prefer Brainy Baby over Baby Einstein DVDs because there's more educational content, the videos are twice as long,  and the children are more culturally diverse. He loved Brainy Baby so much I decided to try a Baby Einstein video (Baby Santa's music box) mostly because he didn't enjoy Christmas video's made for older children (Besides Charlie Brown). He enjoyed it so much I decided to buy Baby Newton, Baby Van Gogh, Galileo, Neptune and Numbers Nursery (he already knows his numbers past 5 so I use it to teach him his numbers in Spanish). He enjoys all of them (Neptune and Van Gogh are his favorites). He likes this DVD the least but he doesn't dislike it. Basically he likes the clown, he likes the Shapes song and the rest of the video but he doesn't like the CGI crayons so he goes to play when they appear on screen. They should've only used the crayons to draw the clown, they could've used the extra minutes to add another shape to the DVD. He's learned a few shapes from it already and we've only had it for a week, because of that I'll recommend it. I'm not a die-hard Baby Einstein fan, like I said I prefer Brainy Baby (basically the same thing except alot less puppets, more babies/toddlers).
