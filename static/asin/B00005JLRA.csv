604211,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLRA,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Summary:Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), after having done his best to counsel notorious mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) and help him overcome his anxiety is now faced with helping the mobster again. Vitti, beginning the movie in prison but with only a few weeks until his parole, has a contract on his head and he's scared.  Feigning insanity, he is finally released into Sobel's care.  Sobel is entrusted with this assignment by the FBI who is actually trying to set Vitti up believing he will recontact his old croons so they can bring them all down.  Sobel, on the other hand, believes that Vitti is supposed to be reforming and therefore tries to help him find a job.  He eventually lands one that works for him as a consultant on a mafia TV show (very Soprano's like), but is planning a massive heist on the side.Of course, what we don't realize or perhaps Vitti doesn't realize, is that, with the help of Sobel - both physically and psychologically - Vitti's heist is going to turn into a scam that will rat out the people trying to kill him and end up putting them in jail - helping him, the FBI, and the new head of his mob family, Patti LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty).My Comments:Billy Crystal is funny; I don't believe anyone can argue that.  Robert DeNiro, on the other hand, is fun to laugh at with the help of Billy Crystal.  He doesn't really have the comedic touch, but teaming him up with Crystal, pioneered in Analyze This, seems to work just as well, if not better, in Analyze That.The story is engaging for the most part, but definitely suffers from some serious slow time.  Even though it is supposed to be funny, the time spent consulting on the TV show drags on and on.  Perhaps this is understandable because Vitti needs time to develop his plan for the heist, but it really slows the movie to a crawl for a while.The other part of the movie that just doesn't seem to work is the continual crying outbursts by both Vitti and Sobel.  Sure, the movie is a comedy and perhaps, in a sense, this is frontier breaking work in having grown men crying on screen, but their crying comes across more as infant wailing then men expressing emotion.  I felt it was just an odd mix of the actors trying to balance humor and seriousness because their psychological problems are supposed to be both at the same time - it just doesn't work.Overall, the comedy makes up for the slow pace, but the movie isn't something special.  It's funny, perhaps funnier than Analyze This because they learned what worked from the first one, but hopefully they will be content to let the series end with this one.",3,Very funny but kind of drawn out.,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,2602,"['Summary', 'Dr.', 'Ben', 'Sobel', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'having', 'done', 'best', 'counsel', 'notorious', 'mobster', 'Paul', 'Vitti', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'help', 'overcome', 'anxiety', 'now', 'faced', 'helping', 'mobster', 'again', 'Vitti', 'beginning', 'movie', 'prison', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'parole', 'contract', 'head', 'scared', 'Feigning', 'insanity', 'finally', 'released', 'Sobel', 'care', 'Sobel', 'entrusted', 'assignment', 'FBI', 'who', 'actually', 'trying', 'set', 'Vitti', 'up', 'believing', 'will', 'recontact', 'old', 'croons', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'Sobel', 'other', 'hand', 'Vitti', 'supposed', 'be', 'reforming', 'therefore', 'tries', 'help', 'find', 'job', 'eventually', 'one', 'consultant', 'mafia', 'TV', 'show', 'very', 'Soprano', 'like', 'planning', 'massive', 'heist', 'side.Of', 'course', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'perhaps', 'Vitti', ""n't"", 'realize', 'help', 'Sobel', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'Vitti', 'heist', 'going', 'turn', 'scam', 'will', 'rat', 'out', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'jail', 'helping', 'FBI', 'new', 'head', 'mob', 'family', 'Patti', 'LoPresti', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', '.My', 'Comments', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'can', 'argue', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'other', 'hand', 'fun', 'laugh', 'help', 'Billy', 'Crystal', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'comedic', 'touch', 'teaming', 'up', 'Crystal', 'pioneered', 'Analyze', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'Analyze', 'That.The', 'story', 'engaging', 'most', 'part', 'definitely', 'suffers', 'serious', 'slow', 'time', 'Even', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'time', 'spent', 'consulting', 'TV', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'understandable', 'Vitti', 'time', 'develop', 'plan', 'heist', 'really', 'movie', 'crawl', 'while.The', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'continual', 'crying', 'outbursts', 'Vitti', 'Sobel', 'Sure', 'movie', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'sense', 'frontier', 'breaking', 'work', 'having', 'grown', 'men', 'crying', 'screen', 'crying', 'across', 'more', 'infant', 'wailing', 'then', 'men', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'odd', 'mix', 'actors', 'trying', 'balance', 'humor', 'seriousness', 'psychological', 'problems', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.Overall', 'comedy', 'up', 'slow', 'pace', 'movie', ""n't"", 'something', 'special', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'funnier', 'Analyze', 'learned', 'what', 'worked', 'first', 'one', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'content', 'let', 'series', 'end', 'one']",N/A

Fakes insanity of course. How's he do that? By singing West Side Story songs. No, I'm not kidding. And the movie just gets worse from there. Vitti is placed into the caring hands of his old pal Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal) and laughs are nowhere to be found.  I honestly think I only laughed once during the whole 96 minutes that actually felt more like 179 minutes. There's a small scene where Vitti is trying to take on normal jobs, but his mafia mindset causes a few chuckles. That's about all that's funny in this disaster. A good subtitle for the movie would be ""Cashin' the Paycheck"". That's all everyone seems to be doing in the flick. Everyone just seems so miserable, and with that cloud hanging over things laughter can't develop.

He is brought into prison to treat Vitti; who has been singing songs from Broadway musicals before lapsing into a state of catatonia. This doesn't surprise Sobel who diagnoses Vitti as having ""brief psychotic disorder"". The problem is that the mobster could become a permanemt schizo if he remains in the prison environment. The solution? Have Vitti released into Dr.Sobel's care- and if Sobel refuses to accept  he loses his license to practice psychiatry. So Sobel has no choice but to again work with a guy ""with an I.Q just south of a bedroom slipper"".But upon picking Vitti up from prison Sobel finds out that the mafioso's been faking his symptoms because he's been targeted by his old cronies who literally want his head on a plate. So it's up to Sobel to attempt once more to help Vitti go straight. The first job opportunity that comes along seems talior made for Vitti: as a Creative Consultant on a Mob movie, which predictably turns sour. So it's not long before Vitti's back to his old ways, joining crime lord Lou Rigazzi and his ""family"" to help plan a gold heist, which Ben finds himself dragged into.With Crystal and Barry Levinson serving as Executive Producers, and again Directed and Co-written by Harold Ramis, the man behind the wonderful GROUNDHOG DAY and the amusing MULTIPLICITY; ANALYZE THAT is a huge disappointment which pales in comparison to its predecessor. Obviously just an attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie, it's lacking that crucial something: A good script.I laughed maybe twice during the entire movie, which offers less laughs in favor of more violence and ample profanity in pure GOODFELLAS fashion, so parental discretion is advised. Another quibble is that Lisa Kudrow has virtually nothing to do here, leaving you wondering if Ramis only recast her merely as a pretty face to offset tbe wrinkles of the movie's ageing leads.Even the bloopers during the end credits aren't funny, though the cast and crew seem to think so. Methinks not. Rent this if you must, but don't buy it. If you want a laugh you're better off watching the first movie again.

Someone is gunning for Paul in the big house, and Ben's father dies. Paul has a complete nervous breakdown, singing the score to &quot;West Side Story,&quot; and he is released into Ben's care (after some very funny psychoanalytic tests). Of course, Paul was faking and of course, the FBI knows, trailing the men as Paul must suddenly go out into the world and get a real job.After several employment mishaps, Paul is hired on as a consultant on the mob TV series &quot;Little Caesar.&quot; There, he reunites with his old gang and they begin planning a huge heist. Meanwhile, Ben is still trying to grieve for the father he sometimes hated, popping pills and trying desperately to keep Paul in line. In the end, we find out who was trying to kill Paul, who may be redeemable after all.Like its predecessor, &quot;Analyze That&quot; is merely okay. The focus here is definitely on DeNiro, as he is featured in almost every scene. Ben takes a backseat in the film when in fact his situation dealing with his father's death (running gag: &quot;He's grieving, it's a process&quot;) is more interesting than Paul's heist and double crossing cronies.The film takes an almost angry look at &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in the form of its fictional show &quot;Little Caesar.&quot; Naturally, I felt a little hypocrisy at this stage. A fake movie about mobsters poking fun at a fake TV show about mobsters.While no laugh riot, there are some bright spots. DeNiro has the funny psycho tests scenes, and Crystal is very natural while watching his life unravel. If you thought Kudrow's role in the first one was overpraised, then you will completely think the same here.

Crystal and DeNiro have the potential to be a great ""ham-and-egg"" comedy team, but they're not given much to work with in this snoozer of a plot.As Crystal's character grieves the passing of his father, DeNiro's character's schemes a way out of prison in order to keep from being the victim of a plot to put him on ice, permanently.  DeNiro fakes mental illness in order to get placed in Crystal's custody so he can get out of Sing Sing.  The rest of the movie is spent with DeNiro trying to regain his status as mob while trying to figure out who attempting to bump him off.  Crystal tries desperately to stay out of the way, but as you can imagine, gets hopelessly involved in DeNiro's affairs.  Numerous predictable scenes (as well as copious amounts of gratuitous vulgar language) occur that seem to be part of the movie because of the lack of imagination and skill shown by the writing team.Unfortunately the talents of two fine actors are wasted in this turkey.  Both men put up a good front, but appear to be sleepwalking their way through the movie.  A fine supporting cast, including an underused Lisa Kudrow and Cathy Moriarity-Gentile aren't enough to make this a memorable experience.

Especially since the freshness of the idea has been completely dampened by the successful & far superior HBO series ""The Sopranos"".The sequel, and I don't know why they bothered(actually I do - $$$$$$$$), is depressing viewing simply b/c most of it is just a re-hash of the first film.  The brief out-takes provided are funnier than the entire film.With ""Analyze That"", we have Crystal's Dr. Sobel grieving the loss of his own father at the beginning of the film and we're  treated to Sobel saying at least 5 times throughout: ""I'm grieving.  It's a process.""  We got it the first time you said it.  And it wasn't very funny to begin with.  We also get to go over the whole assassination of Vitti's father thing, with the requisite flashbacks, and how that has scarred him.  This territory was mined in the first film and they didn't need to go there again.  But they do.  The only difference in this film is that we have Vitti faking lunacy(this is where we have to sit through the painfully unfunny scene of Deniro doing a few Broadway show tunes in prison) and being entrusted to the care of Crystal's Sobel with much hilarity ensuing.  Not even close.One of the best things about the first film was the character Jelly and some of Crystals reactions & line readings.  I didn't find Deniro funny at all in the first film.  But in ""Analyze That"", Jelly has hardly anything to do at all and isn't remotely funny.  Crystal has a couple of lines I laughed at and Kudrow is again wasted along with Cathy Moriarty, whom I usually love.  Vitti & Sobel get to cry again.  Ugh!!!  Why is it so often necessary to weigh down comedic films with mawkish sentimentality.  And believe it or not, they have Vitti again pointing his finger at Sobel:  ""You.....you're good.  You got a gift.""  This was something that brought a wan smile to my face in the first film but director/co-writer Harold Ramis must think we all find this a scream because they do it several times here.  And if that isn't enough to put you off watching this, the film ends with Vitti, Sobel & Jelly entertaining us with a final show tune.  YUCK!!!  And not funny!!!That said, if you LOVED the first film and have very low expectations and aren't too picky you may find yourself entertained for 90  minutes.

In this film, Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is called to the prison where Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is serving time.  It seems that Vitti has suffered a psychotic break after telephoning Sobel, and the powers-that-be release Vitti into Sobel's care.  Of course, there's much more hiding behind DeNiro's obsessive reenactment of &quot;West Side Story&quot; than a breakdown, and the viewer is once again led into the wacky world of Vitti's crime family.  The problem is that the first movie had a freshness of plot and character that seem stale in the sequel.  We've seen it all before - and with better plotting.

And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough.

But you are, oh well. I guess I'll have to review the movie, now.The Boss and The Shrink are back in therapy: Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) has been locked up in Sing-Sing for 850 days. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has just lost his father. That's when he gets the call from Vitti. Vitti gives him the low-down: Someone is trying to kill Vitti in jail. Sobel hangs up, Vitti gets mad, so he fakes crazy, and Sobel gets called in (since he is Vitti's psychiatrist). Sobel believes Vitti is cuckoo in the slammer, as he sees him singing tunes from ""West Side Story"" (one of the funniest parts in the film). So Vitti is released into the custody of Ben Sobel. But on the ride to Sobel's house, Vitti snaps out of it, only to reveal that he is not crazy, but, in fact, quite well. Now Vitti must start a new life and get a real job - that involves working ""from 9 to 5!"" - and find out who is trying to kill him...and why.Perhaps I am mistaken, but ""Analyze That"" is funnier than ""Analyze This."" Maybe it's just me, but I found it quite funny. I didn't think it was a ""rip-off"" sequel, there for ""no artistic reason."" Sure, it's a sequel. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar-winner for originality; I don't ask for that in a comedy. Honestly, can you think of any sequel (other than the rare ""Godfather Part II"" film) that is as good as the original in terms of reasons for being there? All I know is that I think ""Analyze That"" had some very funny moments. Take, for instance, the scenes where Vitti is trying to get a new job. He becomes a car salesman for a day, and leads around a couple, showing them a nice car. ""Look at that trunk - you could fit three bodies in there!"" he says. When they say they're going to think about it: ""What's there to think about? You've been busting my b@lls for the last hour over this thing, asking me all these stupid questions, taking it for a test drive...so why don't you buy it?""Scenes like these are hilarious. And while there are somewhat long sequences without any laughs, the laugh-out-loud scenes more than make up for those lacking.The only thing about this film that makes me drop the rating a notch is the execution of the last half hour. Just like the first movie, they set up a ridiculous ""action"" ending, that isn't action at all. Its ending is overlong and goes way too long without any laughs.But that is the only thing I didn't like about the movie. De Niro and Crystal have a real chemistry, even more so here than in the first film. De Niro steals the scenes he is in, and Crystal steals the scenes he is in, and when they are both on screen, you're not sure who to look at.I find Robert De Niro's latest journeys into comedy quite funny. He made a few comedies here and there in the past, but in the last three years he's coughed out some funny movies. ""Analyze This,"" ""Meet the Parents,"" ""Analyze That,"" and to a certain degree (it was okay), ""Showtime.""Perhaps I am confused. Maybe I need to see the first again. But having seen the original about twice, and ""Analyze That"" once, I can honestly say that I laughed more in ""Analyze That"" than I did watching ""Analyze This."" And if that's not a good sequel, I don't know what is.Here's to ""Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing""!",4,"Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing...",1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,3347,"['Analyze', 'critics', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', 'Which', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'listening', 'either', 'are', 'oh', 'well', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'review', 'movie', 'now.The', 'Boss', 'Shrink', 'are', 'back', 'therapy', 'Paul', 'Vitti', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'Sing-Sing', '850', 'days', 'Ben', 'Sobel', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'when', 'call', 'Vitti', 'Vitti', 'low-down', 'Someone', 'trying', 'kill', 'Vitti', 'jail', 'Sobel', 'up', 'Vitti', 'mad', 'crazy', 'Sobel', 'called', 'Vitti', 'psychiatrist', 'Sobel', 'Vitti', 'cuckoo', 'slammer', 'singing', 'tunes', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'one', 'funniest', 'parts', 'film', 'So', 'Vitti', 'released', 'custody', 'Ben', 'Sobel', 'ride', 'Sobel', 'house', 'Vitti', 'only', 'reveal', 'not', 'crazy', 'fact', 'quite', 'well', 'Now', 'Vitti', 'must', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'working', '9', '5', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'trying', 'kill', 'why.Perhaps', 'am', 'mistaken', 'Analyze', 'funnier', 'Analyze', 'just', 'found', 'quite', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'rip-off', 'sequel', 'artistic', 'reason', 'Sure', 'sequel', 'course', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Oscar-winner', 'originality', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'comedy', 'Honestly', 'can', 'think', 'sequel', 'other', 'rare', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'terms', 'reasons', 'being', 'know', 'think', 'Analyze', 'had', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'Take', 'instance', 'scenes', 'where', 'Vitti', 'trying', 'get', 'new', 'job', 'car', 'salesman', 'day', 'around', 'couple', 'showing', 'nice', 'car', 'Look', 'trunk', 'could', 'fit', 'three', 'bodies', 'When', 'say', ""'re"", 'going', 'think', 'What', 'there', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'busting', 'b', '@', 'lls', 'last', 'hour', 'thing', 'asking', 'stupid', 'questions', 'taking', 'test', 'drive', 'so', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Scenes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'are', 'somewhat', 'long', 'sequences', 'laughs', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'lacking.The', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'drop', 'rating', 'notch', 'execution', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Just', 'first', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'ending', ""n't"", 'action', 'ending', 'overlong', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'laughs.But', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'De', 'Niro', 'Crystal', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'here', 'first', 'film', 'De', 'Niro', 'scenes', 'Crystal', 'steals', 'scenes', 'when', 'are', 'screen', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'look', 'at.I', 'find', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'latest', 'journeys', 'comedy', 'quite', 'funny', 'made', 'few', 'comedies', 'here', 'there', 'past', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'coughed', 'out', 'funny', 'movies', 'Analyze', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Analyze', 'certain', 'degree', 'was', 'okay', 'Showtime', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'confused', 'Maybe', 'need', 'see', 'first', 'again', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'twice', 'Analyze', 'once', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'laughed', 'more', 'Analyze', 'did', 'watching', 'Analyze', 'not', 'good', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Analyze', 'Other', 'Thing']",N/A

Video quality and sound is good, just as you'd expect most modern DVDs.The movie, unfortunately, is not quite as well-made as the disc.  The first movie had the advantage of originality, pairing Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal for the first time with snappy dialog and interesting situations.  I hate to say it, but you, Analyze That, you... you're not so good, you.With the main action of the movie based around a ""Sopranos"" TV show look-alike, Little Caesar, the movie about the mafia makes fun of a TV show about the mafia.  I don't know why they'd feel the need to do this... the lead actor in the TV show ""Little Caesar"" is from Australia (though Italian), making fun of actors who really aren't Italian trying to pass off as the genuine article.  However, all the actors on the Sopranos pretty much are the real thing, aren't they?  I don't get why you'd need to make fun of it... it's definitely not saying anything to me, though I don't watch the Sopranos.  Maybe I need a few season history to catch more of the jokes...Some snappy dialog is exchanged between DeNiro and Crystal... and again, as many others have said, Lisa Kudrow is essentially shoved in a corner, not getting a chance to show her considerable comedic skill.  It's a shame, too, because too much of this movie seems ... well... not funny.  You're looking for a laugh, since you think it's supposed to be a light-hearted Billy Crystal romp... but it just doesn't come off as that effectively enough.Even with a pretty average to sub-par comedy, the music will have you rockin'.  Done by David Holmes, the soundtrack here is very much in the same vein as the Clooney/Pitt Ocean's Eleven.  Very deep beats.The beginning 20 minutes or so start off well enough, but the movie just dragged after that.

604241,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLRA,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","Being a huge Robert De Niro fan and, having really enjoyed ""Analyze This"", the prequel to this film, my son rented this film, expecting a very funny film. We hunkered down to watch it together, waiting for the film to make us laugh. We had a very long wait.It is hard to believe that Harold Ramis, the same director who successfully directed the very funny ""Analyze This"", as well as other successful comedic gems, such as ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Bedazzled"", could turn out such an unfunny clunker of a film. Ham handed, leaden, and obvious would best describe this effort. Of course, he is hampered by the material with which he had to work. There is only so much one can do with a script that is torpid, stupid, and just not funny. The director is lucky that he had such an excellent cast with which to work. Who knows how much worse this film would have fared in the hands of less talented and skillful actors.Reprising their roles in ""Analyze This"", Robert De Niro, as Mob boss Paul Vitti, and Billy Crystal, as his reluctant shrink, Dr. Ben Sobel, do all they can to raise the material with which they had to work to another level. In the final analysis, they are unable to do so, and the film fails to deliver. In fact, the viewer ends up feeling almost embarrassed for them, so forced and contrived are their performances. They are simply not very funny.The actual premise of the film is simple. Paul Vitti is in prison, on the cusp of completing his sentence, when he realizes someone is trying to kill him. He feigns insanity by singing show tunes and being seemingly catatonic, at times. The Feds call in Dr. Sobel, who is forced to take Vitti out of prison into his care and custody, with orders to get Vitti in shape for his parole board hearing and onto the straight and narrow. Once free, however, Vitti reveals to Dr. Sobel that his actions were merely part of a ruse to get out and discover who is trying to kill him.Moving in with Dr. Sobel, Vitti disrupts the doctor's life. He fails to take to holding down a regular job, as he has socialization problems. When Vitti finally hooks up with a gig he can tolerate, as consultant to a TV series about a mob boss, he uses the job as a front for bringing his old crew together and finding out who is trying to ice him.Lisa Kudrow, as Dr. Sobel's wife, is not given much with which to work, and the little material with which she has to work is not particularly funny. Cathy Moriarty, who once played De Niro's wife in ""Raging Bull"", the film about boxing great, Jake LaMotta, is teamed up with De Niro again. Looking none the worse for wear, she appears here as a rival mob boss. She, too, does the best she can do with the hand that she has been dealt.

I reasoned to myself that maybe, its originality is gone due to Soprano's viewing.  Moreover, all of us might get tired of those cliche overweight Italian mafioso with chunky gold necklaces, hair styles that are comparable to bricks in either their track-suits or in tailor-made Italian suits hanging out in a strip joint named Bada-Bing or perhaps, in pizza parlour or traditional Italian restaurant sampling spaghetti or meatballs with over-the-top body & verbal expressions.  Yes, ""Analyse That"" did have those elements but not as significant as in ""Analyse This"".  In this sequel offering, it's about De Niro's character's survival.  He would need to weigh his options to outwit, outplay, outdo his opponents.  With humour aside, this sequel is actually rather edgy.  To put into another perspective, it is a more matured version of ""Analyse This"", where the characters were not as two-dimensional.  Billy Crystal reprised his role as the shrink & this time around, he got to express his rough side as he was coping with the mourning over his love-&-hate father.  Along the way, Billy's character realised that there's actually quite a similarity between him & De Niro's character of their complex over their fathers.  ""Analyse That"" also slapped the ""Soprano""s series on the face by having Anthony LaPaglia (a truly versatile Australian who played the lead in ""Without A Trace"", guest starring in ""the Frasiers"" as Dephany's brother with a rather plonky British accent) engaging De Niro's character as a advisor to his TV series character called Caesar.  Naturally, the West Side Story singing by De Niro's character was a highlight but truth to be told, ""Analyse That"" is a worthy sequel to the original.

Analyze This was a marvellous comedy -- sharp, witty, and laugh-out-loud hilarious with just the right mix of smart lines and visual gags.Analyze That suffers from the younger sibling syndrome. It's clear they scampered to recreate the infectious chemistry between De Niro and Crystal in the original, but it's just not as crisp. Too many moments look affected, and too often the story plods into unnecessary melodrama. A supposed big heist as the finale is a bit of a gyp, clinched by the very last scene which could really have been done without.That said about the plot (or lack of it,) the hit and miss A-That also has its moments. I can think of at least 10 memorable one-liners, and there are patches in the movie when you feel light hearted, but the humor is rather dry. Lisa Kudrow squeezes in perhaps 6 minutes of airtime.I adored the original. Based on reviews here, had pretty low expectations. It's not that bad, in its own right it is even a fair movie, but is not up to the task of matching up to its ripper of a prequel.The soundtrack here is a bit better though. Some great R&B; music (a genre I don't usually care much about) and the DVD has some interesting ""Making of.."" moments.Recommended rental, not much more.",4,"LACKS THE SPARKLES OF FIRST, BUT FUNNY NONETHELESS",1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,1295,"['not', 'easy', 'sequel', 'notch', 'up', 'super', 'first', 'movie', 'Analyze', 'was', 'marvellous', 'comedy', 'sharp', 'witty', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'smart', 'lines', 'visual', 'gags.Analyze', 'younger', 'sibling', 'syndrome', 'clear', 'scampered', 'recreate', 'infectious', 'chemistry', 'De', 'Niro', 'Crystal', 'original', 'just', 'not', 'crisp', 'Too', 'many', 'moments', 'look', 'affected', 'too', 'often', 'story', 'plods', 'unnecessary', 'melodrama', 'supposed', 'big', 'heist', 'finale', 'bit', 'gyp', 'clinched', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'said', 'plot', 'lack', 'hit', 'miss', 'A-That', 'also', 'moments', 'can', 'think', 'least', '10', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'are', 'patches', 'movie', 'when', 'feel', 'light', 'hearted', 'humor', 'rather', 'dry', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'perhaps', '6', 'minutes', 'airtime.I', 'adored', 'original', 'Based', 'reviews', 'here', 'had', 'pretty', 'low', 'expectations', 'not', 'bad', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'fair', 'movie', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'matching', 'up', 'ripper', 'prequel.The', 'soundtrack', 'here', 'bit', 'better', 'great', 'R', 'B', 'music', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'much', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'Making', 'of..', 'moments.Recommended', 'rental', 'not', 'much', 'more']",N/A

Sobel agrees that he is insane and will take him in his custody, little does he know Vitti has a plan...There are some truely hilarious moments, for example DeNiro walks downstairs in Crystal's house, Jewish majority, with just a dressing gound showing his privates. He then claims - 'what ya gotta do for some bacon round here eh?' Joe Viterelli is superb as the slow moving, slow thinking original mobster named 'Jelly' who really brings a spark to the show.

The basic story is Mob boss DeNiro is about to be released from Sing Sing after serving his term, but DeNiro seems to be having a nervous breakdown because of the recent threats on his life by a rival family or maybe his funny behavior is a ploy to get out of jail early? The FBI who has been monitoring him isn't sure and neither is his former shrink Billy Crystal, who gets called in to consult on the case. The last time Crystal treated DeNiro, he barely scratched the surface. It's going to take a lot of time to examine DeNiro and get him back on the right track  The problem is that Crystal has problems of his own. His father has just died, plunging him into an identity crisis in both his personal and professional life. On top of it all, he knows his wife will be pissed if he allows DeNiro back into their lives. DeNiro ends up being released to Crystal as his house-guest and Crystal really has no choice but to take him. In order to get peace back in his life, he must help the MOB boss sort out his life and find a normal job.

The basic premise that DeNiro is spoofing the mafia roles he has done in the past while Billy Crystal is trying to help him get over his anxiety was pure genius.  Then came the sequel, and well it treads on familiar territory but doesn't do much else.The story here is that DeNiro is still in jail after 3 years (wasn't the sentence only 18 months) and he is up for parole in a few weeks.  In the mean time  Crystals father just died.  In jail some one is out to kill DeNiro.  From there he fakes a mental illness to get out.  When he first arrives in Crystals custody immediatly it is revealed that it was all a hoax.  Then for the first 24 hours at his place things go not quite as planned.  Soon after DeNiro goes job hunting while trying to figure out who is trying to kill him.  He eventually gets a job on this TV mob story (think Sopranoes) and he adds a little moer realism to the show.  Eventually he figures out who is out to get him and he sets up this huge gold heist to frame the family that is trying to rub him out.For the first half of the movie it is truely a funny piece of work.  Especially DeNiro singing West SIde Story as part of his hoax.  However after he goes job hunting the movie starts to lose something as the comedy goes stale and there seems to be to many physical jokes revolved around Crystals groin.  SO over all the movie gets a strong start, but the story goes flat rather quickly after the first half and quite frankly it could of been better.",3,A typical sequel,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,1586,"['little', 'doubt', 'Analyze', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'while', 'basic', 'premise', 'DeNiro', 'spoofing', 'mafia', 'done', 'past', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'trying', 'help', 'get', 'anxiety', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', 'Then', 'came', 'sequel', 'well', 'familiar', 'territory', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'else.The', 'story', 'here', 'DeNiro', 'still', 'jail', '3', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'sentence', 'only', '18', 'months', 'up', 'parole', 'few', 'weeks', 'mean', 'time', 'Crystals', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'jail', 'one', 'kill', 'DeNiro', 'mental', 'illness', 'get', 'out', 'When', 'first', 'Crystals', 'custody', 'immediatly', 'revealed', 'was', 'hoax', 'Then', 'first', '24', 'hours', 'place', 'things', 'go', 'not', 'quite', 'planned', 'Soon', 'DeNiro', 'job', 'hunting', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'trying', 'kill', 'eventually', 'job', 'TV', 'mob', 'story', 'think', 'Sopranoes', 'little', 'moer', 'realism', 'show', 'Eventually', 'out', 'who', 'out', 'get', 'up', 'huge', 'gold', 'heist', 'frame', 'family', 'trying', 'rub', 'out.For', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'truely', 'funny', 'piece', 'work', 'Especially', 'DeNiro', 'singing', 'West', 'SIde', 'Story', 'part', 'hoax', 'However', 'job', 'hunting', 'movie', 'lose', 'something', 'comedy', 'stale', 'there', 'be', 'many', 'physical', 'jokes', 'revolved', 'Crystals', 'groin', 'movie', 'strong', 'start', 'story', 'flat', 'rather', 'quickly', 'first', 'half', 'quite', 'frankly', 'could', 'been', 'better']",N/A
