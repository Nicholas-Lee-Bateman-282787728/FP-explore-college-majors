ABCs ""Detroit 1-8-7"" is new to our primetime schedule here in Australia - currently being aired on Seven/Prime, and the pilot episode was enough to get me hooked.  With David Zabel, of ""ER"" fame involved in its production, I am not surprised by its exceptional creative visual and sound quality.  The show's documentary style of filmmaking and soundtrack captures the perfect tone of Detroit - similar to how ""Law & Order"" and ""NYPD Blue"" captured the tone of New York City; ""Homicide: Life On The Street"" captured the tone of Baltimore; and ""SouthLAnd"" captured the tone of south-central Los Angeles, ""Detroit 1-8-7"" is another new show in the line, including CBSs ""Blue Bloods"" and NBCs ""Harry's Law"" giving me such great viewing pleasure.
