The scenery is breath-taking, the plot rivoting, acting is top notch, and has a startling ending.  There is also some rough language from the prisoners in the jail and the escaped convicts which I could have lived without, but it is realistically done.Two prisoners escape from a maximum security prison and hop on board a train whose engineer dies, leaving the train as a runaway with nobody on board able to stop it.  Jon Voight turns in a tour de force performance as convict Manny, a fierce, crazed individual running from himself.  His tag-along buddy, Buck, is an obnoxious fellow who is trying to ingratiate himself with Manny, but is not really a hard core con.  They are joined by Sara, a train worker who fell asleep during the commotion.  The interplay between these three and that of the prison warden makes for a tense, well acted drama that takes many twists and turns.The support acting is all good, maybe a little over the top in the control center at times, but one still can feel the tension building over this runaway train and its runaway riders.

Jon Voight plays a man just released from the hole (inside a prison) after three of being in it and is accompanied by Julia's brother Eric Roberts in this thrilling tale about two men breaking out of prison and catching a ride on a train which quickly becomes out of control.  Voight is amazing as the title role and really shows his acting skills in this all out preformance.  Roberts plays his part well but no comparison to Voight.

141048,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792838424,Austin Somlo,"[3, 3]","Viewed: 7/07, 6/11Rate: 107/07: Jon Voight's Manny Manheim is one mean, hard, and tough SOB to ever grace the screen. He makes James Woods look like a wimp. Runaway Train is a spectacular, breathtaking, and thrilling machine that never lets down, not even for a slightest second. Why!...Jon Voight completely owned the picture. His performance is a monster of a beast, and it is way ahead of what he had done in Midnight Cowboy. The two supporting performances supplied by Eric Roberts and Rebecca De Mornay are nothing short of excellence. This goes to the same practically everybody else involved in the picture, especially John P. Ryan. Poetic as it could be, the ending of Runaway Train is absolutely mesmerizing. It belongs on the list of greatest screen endings ever put forth. As well, Runaway Train belongs on the list of greatest movies made. Jon Voight is brilliant, breathtaking, and ferocious. The story is quite ingenious: full of twists and turns. It never tries to be unrealistic in terms of impossible physics. While the moving train itself is awesome in sight, the growth and the emotional spirit become transparent in feeling like some kind of an energy that propels a comet. Eric Roberts gives this remarkable transformation from being a gleeful, nave fighter to this broken-spirited, surrendering coward that keeps his face up in light of defeatism. But Jon Voight's character is absolutely out of this world. When I think of Manny, I think of that raw energy like Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski. To have them paired up, that would be quite something else. That Alaskan snow-covering atmosphere, it heightened the suspense of Runaway Train along with the incredible stunt work, especially when Ranken holds to the ladder at the bottom of a helicopter. This battle between the two, Manny and Ranken, contains this bleeding machismo for the sake of glory to win-or-death finish. And guess what? They don't care. Honor, pride, and principle overtake everything else and become the driving force for valorization of male egotism. There is a fine line separating those who can and those who can't...I see that plainly and clearly in Jon Voight and Eric Roberts. To think back, Eric Robert's character boasts of it in the boxing ring, but he fails to back it up on the runaway train. Enter Manny, he shows me exactly how the law works and the law of aggressiveness will decide the manhood. He clearly displays that on the runaway train, even with one healthy hand and the other badly disfigured. That is...a work of art...a legendary performance...and beyond Jon Voight. On the other hand, I've read about the technical errors regarding to runaway trains, and my answer to that is: I don't give a damn. This is not going to take away the film that Runaway Train is. I've seen absolutely ridiculous movies that defied the laws of physics and got away with them. I've seen films where characters have the strength of a superman to withstand anything that's thought as violations of nature. Runaway Train does not allow its characters to defeat nature to be heroes but rather find heroism in different ways. This is one of the greatest films made, one of the most thrilling made, one of the greatest action flicks, and one of the most suspenseful ever. Last of all, again, Jon Voight gives one of the greatest performances ever in screen history and plays possibly the hardest, toughest screw on-screen. I have to completely think Runaway Train as one of the biggest contenders for the best movie of the decade.6/11: Runaway Train is one of the most unusual pictures that will leave me exasperated for a breath from start to finish. It's easily Jon Voight's show, and I think the thrilling performance as Oscar ""Manny"" Manheim tops his Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy. Don't get me wrong: both are outstanding pieces of work, but I feel his in Runaway Train is all raw and to the core. Eric Roberts proves that he will always be the better actor than his sister Julia Roberts. Although Jon Voight has his moments, it's the action, especially the scenes with the helicopter over the snow filled mountains, that provides the most excitement and thrills. Of course, the ending is one of the top 10 greatest ever and is a must-see. There is nothing like it. All in all, Runaway Train is a brilliant masterpiece and a one-of-a-kind.",5,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made.,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,4336,"['Viewed', '7/07', '6/11Rate', '107/07', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Manny', 'Manheim', 'one', 'mean', 'hard', 'tough', 'SOB', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'James', 'Woods', 'look', 'wimp', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'spectacular', 'breathtaking', 'thrilling', 'machine', 'never', 'down', 'not', 'even', 'slightest', 'second', 'Why', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'completely', 'owned', 'picture', 'performance', 'monster', 'beast', 'way', 'ahead', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'two', 'supporting', 'performances', 'supplied', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellence', 'same', 'practically', 'everybody', 'else', 'involved', 'picture', 'especially', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'Poetic', 'could', 'be', 'ending', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'list', 'greatest', 'screen', 'endings', 'ever', 'put', 'forth', 'As', 'well', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'belongs', 'list', 'greatest', 'movies', 'made', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'brilliant', 'breathtaking', 'ferocious', 'story', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'never', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'terms', 'impossible', 'physics', 'moving', 'train', 'awesome', 'sight', 'growth', 'emotional', 'spirit', 'become', 'transparent', 'feeling', 'kind', 'energy', 'comet', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'remarkable', 'transformation', 'being', 'gleeful', 'nave', 'fighter', 'broken-spirited', 'surrendering', 'coward', 'face', 'up', 'light', 'defeatism', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'character', 'absolutely', 'world', 'When', 'think', 'Manny', 'think', 'raw', 'energy', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'have', 'paired', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'something', 'else', 'Alaskan', 'snow-covering', 'atmosphere', 'heightened', 'suspense', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'incredible', 'stunt', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'Ranken', 'ladder', 'bottom', 'helicopter', 'battle', 'two', 'Manny', 'Ranken', 'bleeding', 'machismo', 'sake', 'glory', 'win-or-death', 'finish', 'guess', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Honor', 'pride', 'principle', 'overtake', 'everything', 'else', 'become', 'driving', 'force', 'valorization', 'male', 'egotism', 'fine', 'line', 'separating', 'who', 'can', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'plainly', 'clearly', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'think', 'back', 'Eric', 'Robert', 'character', 'boasts', 'boxing', 'ring', 'back', 'up', 'runaway', 'train', 'Enter', 'Manny', 'exactly', 'how', 'law', 'law', 'aggressiveness', 'will', 'decide', 'manhood', 'clearly', 'runaway', 'train', 'even', 'one', 'healthy', 'hand', 'other', 'badly', 'disfigured', 'work', 'art', 'legendary', 'performance', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'read', 'technical', 'errors', 'regarding', 'runaway', 'trains', 'answer', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'Runaway', 'Train', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'movies', 'defied', 'laws', 'physics', 'got', 'away', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'strength', 'superman', 'withstand', 'anything', 'thought', 'violations', 'nature', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'not', 'allow', 'characters', 'defeat', 'nature', 'be', 'heroes', 'rather', 'find', 'heroism', 'different', 'ways', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'made', 'one', 'greatest', 'action', 'flicks', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'ever', 'Last', 'again', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'ever', 'screen', 'history', 'possibly', 'hardest', 'toughest', 'screw', 'on-screen', 'have', 'completely', 'think', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'one', 'biggest', 'contenders', 'best', 'movie', 'decade.6/11', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'pictures', 'will', 'leave', 'exasperated', 'breath', 'start', 'finish', 'easily', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'show', 'think', 'thrilling', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'Manny', 'Manheim', 'Joe', 'Buck', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'outstanding', 'pieces', 'work', 'feel', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'raw', 'core', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'better', 'actor', 'sister', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'moments', 'action', 'especially', 'scenes', 'helicopter', 'snow', 'filled', 'mountains', 'most', 'excitement', 'thrills', 'course', 'ending', 'one', 'top', '10', 'greatest', 'ever', 'must-see', 'nothing', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'one-of-a-kind']",N/A

Suspense builds as railroad personnel try to figure out a way to stop it (the conductor is dead from a heart attack), or at least divert other trains along the line away from it. Meanwhile prison warden John P. Ryan is determined to get aboard the train to stop Voight before he (Voight) becomes a hero to his prison mates back in Alaska. A lot in the picture doesn't make sense, such as why the train, which is barreling along at 90 mph, doesn't simply derail after plowing through snowdrifts and crashing into the caboose of a sidetracked train.

The movie starts off kinda slow and boring. Prison scenes usually ARE boring, but once Eric Roberts and Jon Voight escape from Prison in Alaska, and travel through the barren lanscapes of Alaska in the freezing snow, the movie slowly builds in INTENSITY. I get cold just watching it.The story really is intense. Could you imagine being on a train that's out of control, knowing you can't get off it without breaking your neck, and heading for certain disaster? Well, I can't give this movie less than a 5 star rating because it's the best movie I seen in years. I never seen it when it first came out, but i always saw it in the video store. It had the coolest looking cover artwork I've seen, but for some reason I never rented it.The score of this movie is chilling, and the camera work is intense also. That mixed with the well written story, makes for an intense thrill ride. I do have one complaint though about this re-release on DVD. Why do the film companies always re-release movies that have really cool cover artwork, with really lame covers? They completely change the cover art. They put some stupid picture of a train coming around a bend, and a picture of Jon Voight and Eric Roberts on the cover. WOW, GREAT JOB! NOT!If you've seen the original artwork, you would know what I'm talking about. For those curious, try searching out the original artwork on the net, and you'll see what I mean.

He's riveting in here. As tough as he is - a hardened criminal who escapes from prison with ""Buck"" (Eric Roberts) - he gives Roberts a little lecture during this story  about being humble enough to serve, even in the most humiliating circumstances. I've never forgotten that intense short speech.This is an action-packed, rough film with rough people and very rough - to the point of crude - language. The language is actually ludicrous at times with over-the-top characters like the ones played by John P. Ryan and Kenneth McMillian.  Being a Golan-Globus film of the period ('70s and '80s), this film is overridden by low-life characters, a trademark of those  filmmakers.Back on the positive side, the story features great suspense, and a real feel for the bleak, snowy Alaskan terrain.

The  reason they can't stand the test of time is because they're all about who can make the biggest explosion or who can pull off the most ellaborate stunt.  But that's not the biggest problem Runaway Train has to contend with, it's the poor plot and lack of character development.  Despite the typical tour-de-force performace turned in by Jon Voight the movie is, for the most part, very poorly acted.  Leading the way of supporting characters are Eric Roberts and Rebecca DeMornay.  They're both semi-stars in their own rite but here are reduced to a ridiculous romance that's so far fetched it'll have you howling with laughter.  Voight is a con, just released from solitary, when he decides to bust prision and go on the lam(e).  Roberts tags along for little other reason than to give him somebody to talk to and at least attempt to flesh-out this cardboard character.  Roberts is a rapist (we're supposed to care for this guy?) who hops the train with Voight and along with DeMornay attempt to stop the train before it's derailed.  Add to the mix a sadistic warden (aren't they alway) and the cliches start piling up so fast they be up to your neck before you know it.

An almighty God, the informatician that controls the  railtracks, is leading the runaway train in any direction he wants. The  shadow of Akira Kurosawa can be recognized behind this idea of men  believing to be free while the Fate has already marked the end of the  journey.The last scene of RUNAWAY TRAIN is a lyrical masterpiece worthy  to be compared to the most visionary works of german director Werner Herzog  or to the silent films of King Vidor.

I ordered it on a Thursday night, and had it in my mailbox the following Monday, so kudos to Amazon for a speedy delivery at a fair price.It should be noted that ""Runaway Train"" was released in late 1985, whereas Amazon has the film being released in '86. Starring Jon Voight (Angelina Jolie's dad)as Manny and Eric Roberts (yes, Julia's brother) as Buck , ""Train"" is about a couple of convicts who escape from an Alaskan prison and stowaway aboard the first freight train they come across as a means of shelter against the bitterly cold elements, in addition to speeding up their escape. What they don't realize is the train's engineer has suffered a fatal heart attack just as the train is departing the station, leaving it without anyone to control the train's speed or destination. The two fugitives are also pursued from a helicopter by the prison warden(John P. Ryan), who seems to hold a personal grudge against Manny. Rebecca DeMornay, in a decidedly un-glamourous role, plays the role of Sara, a young girl working on the train and inadvertently getting stranded aboard with Manny and Buck. With the train headed for a dead end at a dangerously high rate of speed and the warden hot on the trail of the fugitives, the film achieves a fever pitch of intensity in the closing minutes, and reaches a tragic, yet poetic conclusion.Both Jon Voight and Eric Roberts received Academy Award nominations for their performances, and Rebecca DeMornay is fine in her smaller role. What makes ""Runaway Train"" stand out, however, is the beautiful cimematography, among the finest I've ever seen in a film. Watching the train careen through the Alaskan countryside in heavy snowfall, I kept thinking how the entire film could have been about the train traveling through the snow, and I would have enjoyed it just the same. The acting and storyline are a bonus. I find it unusual that most DVD retail chains do not carry ""Runaway Train"", thus prompting my purchase from Amazon. I would certainly place the film in my top 25 all time favorites category. One bit of warning: The film is rated ""R"" for graphic violence, and a scene involving Voight's character trying to disconnect one train car from another is not for the squeamish. Regardless, it does not affect my rating.

Is freedom a physical or philosophical thing?  It depends on where you are at and where you have come from.  For ""Manny"" Mannheim (Jon Voight) freedom is going out on your own terms.  If you can take your nemesis with you, all the better.This film is a classic ""under the radar"" film.  You will not find it on many critic's lists, best of lists or featured in many film retrospectives, but it  comes as close to some of the classics of the 30's and 40's as any film of it's era.Voight's performance is powerful and multi-dimensional.  The point where he berates Brock (Eric Roberts) for falling into the too easy macho con trap and not working to improve himself for re-entry into society is a revelation.  When Brock asks Manny if he (Manny) could suck it up and work at some dull job to make it on the outside, Manny replies, ""I wish I could"".  The look on Brock's face says it all.  ""This guy really means it.  Here is a hardened con, a tough guy that everyone at the prison idolizes for his spirit and he's telling me that he would trade it all for a chance to wash dishes or clean floors.  But he knows it is too late.  He cannot go back now.""  Manny is a man locked into his fate.  He cannot knuckle under to the warden, or the system or to his own will to live free or die.A bothersome aspect of the film for me is Eric Robert's performance.  Somehow he garnered a nomination for best supporting actor, but to me his performance is a little too overbearing and annoying.  I know that he is supposed to idolize Manny and play the young man who grows during the film,  and I can get that as a boxer he may be a bit ""punchy"" but he often sounds like he is doing a drunken Elvis imitation and comes close to overacting in some scenes.  Also the storyline concerning the administrators at the central railroad office tends to veer close to cartoonish comedy, but these are small points that should not distract you from the overall message and story in the movie.I recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for an above average adventure movie with some great scenes of wintry landscapes shot along lonely rail lines and a protagonist a cut above the usual one dimensional character protrayal.",5,"What is ""freedom""?",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,2280,"['song', 'freedom', 'just', 'word', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'freedom', 'physical', 'philosophical', 'thing', 'where', 'are', 'where', 'have', 'come', 'Manny', 'Mannheim', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'freedom', 'going', 'out', 'own', 'terms', 'can', 'take', 'nemesis', 'better.This', 'film', 'classic', 'radar', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'many', 'critic', 'lists', 'best', 'lists', 'featured', 'many', 'film', 'retrospectives', 'as', 'close', 'classics', '30', '40', 'film', 'era.Voight', 'performance', 'powerful', 'multi-dimensional', 'point', 'where', 'Brock', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'falling', 'too', 'easy', 'macho', 'con', 'trap', 'not', 'working', 'improve', 're-entry', 'society', 'revelation', 'When', 'Brock', 'Manny', 'Manny', 'could', 'suck', 'up', 'work', 'dull', 'job', 'make', 'outside', 'Manny', 'replies', 'wish', 'could', 'look', 'Brock', 'face', 'guy', 'really', 'Here', 'hardened', 'con', 'tough', 'guy', 'everyone', 'prison', 'spirit', 'telling', 'would', 'trade', 'chance', 'wash', 'dishes', 'clean', 'floors', 'too', 'late', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'now', 'Manny', 'man', 'locked', 'fate', 'can', 'not', 'knuckle', 'warden', 'system', 'own', 'will', 'live', 'free', 'die.A', 'bothersome', 'aspect', 'film', 'Eric', 'Robert', 'performance', 'garnered', 'nomination', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'performance', 'little', 'too', 'overbearing', 'annoying', 'know', 'supposed', 'idolize', 'Manny', 'play', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'boxer', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'punchy', 'often', 'doing', 'drunken', 'Elvis', 'imitation', 'close', 'overacting', 'scenes', 'Also', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'administrators', 'central', 'railroad', 'office', 'veer', 'close', 'cartoonish', 'comedy', 'are', 'small', 'points', 'should', 'not', 'distract', 'overall', 'message', 'story', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'mood', 'above', 'average', 'adventure', 'movie', 'great', 'scenes', 'wintry', 'landscapes', 'shot', 'along', 'lonely', 'rail', 'lines', 'protagonist', 'cut', 'usual', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'protrayal']",N/A

141070,A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA,0792838424,FrontPage,"[7, 9]","Let me start by giving you some notes about the DVD. It's a bare- bones disc, with little done to give the purchaser more insight into the movie's production. It only contains the trailer; no added features like production stills, commentary, or even a &quot;making of&quot; page to scroll through. Most people that watch Train liked it, and I for one would liked to have seen some background about the development of the movie.Quite a decent yarn of two convicts -- one seasoned and numbed of almost all feelings and one rookie that yearns to be accepted -- who meet while imprisoned in Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison, housing the nation's toughest (or most despicable) convicts.I became curious about Train while thumbing through a movie review book. If you watch this expecting to be disappointed in the movie's plot or characters, you'll most likely enjoy it. If you demand perfection from the production and technical aspects, you'll not be quite as thrilled, and I'll tell you why.Oscar Manheim (Jon Voight) was a very believable character, and pairing him with Buck McGehee (Eric Roberts) was rather enjoyable. Lacking a solid plan to escape, they just kept digging themselves a bigger hole each time they made a decision to escape Stonehaven Prison, headed by Warden Ranken (John P. Ryan). FYI, &quot;Ranken&quot; is the correct spelling.I was most surprised by Eric Roberts.... The poor guy has been in the shadow of the career of his sister Julia Roberts and hasn't been nearly as successful in his acting career. Eric developed Buck's character well as a dim- witted felon, convicted of &quot;statustory&quot; rape, as Buck pronounces it. He tries to show a tough exterior in his actions throughout his criminal life, but Sara (Rebecca De Mornay) helps break down that wall. Maybe it was love but the movie was not a love story -- not one kiss was thrown.***SLIGHT SPOILER, SKIP*** It becomes the viewer's decision to contemplate what happens to the main characters after the quote from Shakespeare fades because we don't actually see the conclusion when Manny rides atop the lead engine.***END OF SLIGHT SPOILER***A few drawbacks: Some of the language was poorly dubbed, like T.K. Carter's character; sometimes the filming of the train was cranked up to give an appearance of speed; some of the snow scenes are abviously enhanced with haze to give an illusion of wind- driven snow. That's why I deducted a major star. Yet the story and plot development tends to keep the viewer entertained. Some might pick on a lack of development of the characters and what drives them. To me, Manny's survival depended on burying his past. And I think an attempt to delve into details about Sara and Buck would slow the film down. For Pete's sake, they're trying to stop a runaway locomotive before it kills them!I have the DVD and have watched it PLENTY of times. It's particularly nice to watch on a cold grey day. The end will leave you thinking, as well. Just make sure to digest the writing quoted from Richard III by William Shakespeare.PS- A note for wrestling and NBA fans: There's an African American guard named Jackson, played by Tom &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister, Jr (he is in the elevator). According to imdb.com, he had a short career in the NBA.

Unfortunately, while I didn't end up hating the movie or even disliking it necessarily, I was sincerely underwhelmed.To describe the plot, the movie begins in an Alaskan maximum security prison.  Oscar ""Manny"" Manheim (Jon Voight) has just been released from solitary confinement, much to the delight of Buck (Eric Roberts), who hero-worships him, and much to the disgust of the warden (John P. Ryan) who despises him.  In short-order Manny escapes, reluctantly taking Buck with him, and fairly soon thereafter they find themselves on a train hurtling through Alaska with no one at the controls.  Meanwhile the Javert-like warden attempts to discover what has become of his escaped nemesis.Despite the cool-sounding nature of the plot, there were many holes.  I can accept a certain amount of coincidence, contrivance, and cliche in any film but Runaway Train is built solidly upon a foundation of all three.  Wanna know how Jon Voight escapes? In the prison laundry cart--couldn't the screenwriters have come up with something a little more original than that?  Then after having little to no trouble with the harsh cold of Alaska (despite the fact that they both get soaked and Buck loses a shoe) they get on a train whose engineer perishes.  Thankfully there's a woman on board to explain how they could stop the train, but also explain how the film's screenwriters have precluded this from happening.  At no point in the first 90 minutes does it occur to any of these characters that they could simply UNCOUPLE THE LAST ENGINE and float away safely, but of course this does happen at the film's climax.  The characters also seem to have no problem touching cold metal with their bare hands, though Manny does have a hand injury that lends itself towards plot developments.Look, this movie is not worth watching.  Both characters got Oscar nods, but they're basically just annoying (Roberts intentionally, Voight unintentionally).  The action is pretty tepid--a much hyped bridge scene basically consists of wobbling railroad ties--and the sometimes-interesting character play doesn't make up for heavy levels of contrivance and clich&eacute;.",3,Disappointing,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2322,"['had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'like', 'action-adventure', 'movies', 'stars', 'seemed', 'be', 'aligned', 'viewing', 'John', 'Voight/Eric', 'Roberts', '1985', 'flick', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'hating', 'movie', 'even', 'disliking', 'necessarily', 'was', 'sincerely', 'underwhelmed.To', 'describe', 'plot', 'movie', 'Alaskan', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'Oscar', 'Manny', 'Manheim', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'much', 'delight', 'Buck', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'who', 'much', 'disgust', 'warden', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'who', 'short-order', 'Manny', 'escapes', 'reluctantly', 'taking', 'Buck', 'fairly', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'find', 'train', 'hurtling', 'Alaska', 'one', 'controls', 'Meanwhile', 'Javert-like', 'warden', 'attempts', 'discover', 'what', 'become', 'escaped', 'nemesis.Despite', 'cool-sounding', 'nature', 'plot', 'were', 'many', 'holes', 'can', 'accept', 'certain', 'amount', 'coincidence', 'contrivance', 'cliche', 'film', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'built', 'solidly', 'foundation', 'three', 'Wan', 'na', 'know', 'how', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'escapes', 'prison', 'laundry', 'cart', 'could', ""n't"", 'screenwriters', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'original', 'Then', 'having', 'little', 'trouble', 'harsh', 'cold', 'Alaska', 'fact', 'get', 'soaked', 'Buck', 'shoe', 'get', 'train', 'engineer', 'perishes', 'Thankfully', 'woman', 'board', 'explain', 'how', 'could', 'stop', 'train', 'also', 'explain', 'how', 'film', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'precluded', 'happening', 'point', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'occur', 'characters', 'could', 'simply', 'UNCOUPLE', 'THE', 'LAST', 'ENGINE', 'float', 'away', 'safely', 'course', 'happen', 'film', 'climax', 'characters', 'also', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'touching', 'cold', 'metal', 'bare', 'hands', 'Manny', 'have', 'hand', 'injury', 'plot', 'developments.Look', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'characters', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nods', ""'re"", 'basically', 'just', 'annoying', 'Roberts', 'intentionally', 'Voight', 'unintentionally', 'action', 'pretty', 'tepid', 'much', 'hyped', 'bridge', 'scene', 'basically', 'wobbling', 'railroad', 'ties', 'sometimes-interesting', 'character', 'play', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'heavy', 'levels', 'contrivance', 'clich', 'eacute']",N/A

He was a bank robber who had become a hero to his fellow inmates after several escape attempts including the dim whited convicted rapists Buck (Eric Roberts). That's when he was put in solitary confinement only to be freed by his lawyer which doesn't sit well with associate warden Ranken (John P. Ryan). With Ranken gunning for Manny, Manny begins to plan his escape and enlists the help of Buck who works in the laundry room. Buck then helps Manny escape the Alaskan prison and then follows him even though Manny doesn't want company. After surviving a long freezing trek and nearly freezing swimming across a river they take refuge on four locomotives buckled together. Things go wrong for the two escaped convicts as the engineer has a heart attack as the train is set in motion and thus we have the runaway train. The two aren't alone on the train as there is a train employee named Sara (Rebecca De Mornay) in one of the other locomotives. The story continues while the train employee's try to stop the train, while Manny and Buck also try to stop and Ranken tries to apprehend the two escaped fugitives. I won't give away the ending to the film, because it's a good one. Like I said the plot is nothing new. There have been films before and after Runaway Train about escaped convicts, but unlike the other films like this Runaway Train doesn't try to do too much relying on the simple story, the dark yet beautiful environment and cinematography and the acting of its small cast and the characters journey togetherSpeaking of the cast it featured young up and coming stars in Eric Roberts and Rebecca De Mornay. Rebecca's other major role being in Risky Business with Tom Cruise. I believe this was Eric Roberts first major film role and was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Buck. These two did a great job in the Runaway Train with Eric as Buck who idolized Manny and Rebecca as Sara who comes to know and respect the two convicts. Next there is Jon Voight who brings fire and passion to the character of Manny and his climatic scene with Ranken is memorable, and to be honest he should have won the Oscar for best actor he was nominated for. John P. Ryan did a really good job as Ranken and holding his own with John Voight. He brought passion to the character that at the end ended up respecting Manny. What I doubt too many people know is that the one and only Danny Trejo made his film debut in Runaway train. He played the boxer who's getting his ass handed to him by Buck in a boxing match.What also plays an important part of the film is the cinematography. The film was filmed in Montana and the desolate snow covered land and appearance of the film added to the dark feel and tone of the film, yet it is also beautiful at the same time. I believe this was the only American film Andrei Konchalovsky directed and he did a pretty good job with the story and actors. Trevor Jones does a good job with the score adding depth and feeling to the film.I do believe Runaway is an unappreciated and underrated film with a simple yet affective story with good characters, great acting and cinematography along with good directing and music. I highly recommend this little known and unappreciated film for anyone who hasn't seen it or if you have seen it watch it again you won't be disappointed.",5,"""No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

They then hop onto a train which they soon discover is a ""runaway"" with no driver. It is fascinating to watch as the relationship betwen Voight and Roberts develops. Roberts initially sees Voight as a ""Hero"" but as the movie progresses he realizes that Manny is only a man suffering from a great amount of Internal Conflict which Voight dramatically tries to resolve at the end of the movie. This movie also stars Rebecca De Mornay in a not so glamourous role which gives her the opportunity to prove that she is actually a very good actress which I have suspected all along.

141087,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0792838424,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a powerful and original action/adventure thriller, masterfully filmed and with great actors - but also with some scenario elements which I did not entirely like. Below, more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.""Manny"" Manheim (Jon Voight) is an extremely dangerous and violent bank robber incarcerated in Stonehaven high security prison in Alaska. Because of his conflict with the warden, he is a kind of ""hero"" to other inmates, especially to Buck (Eric Roberts), a young and rather stupid but very strong guy serving time for statutory rape. Together they plan an escape, using opportunities created by Buck's job in prison laundry - but as it is widely known, hardly any plan ever survives intact even the first step of its realisation. As result, Manny and Buck will find themselves in probably the only location on Earth which will make them almost miss the prison - and it will be a HUGE problem to leave this place...This film packs a mighty punch and has a lot of good points:- the scenario is strong, which is only normal considering that it was an unrealised Kurosawa project- this movie was filmed in a very original way - part of its originality certainly came from the non-Hollywoodian background of Soviet director Andrei Konchalovsky- visually the film is stunning, with the ferocious, merciless beauty of Alaska in winter captured in all its splendor- both main actors are absolutely EXCELLENT! Both Jon Voight and Eric Roberts were very deservedly nominated for Oscars for their roles in this film. Especially Eric Roberts did very well - because after all playing a pathetic, annoying idiot is somehow more difficult than portraying a scary, bad@ss, evil to the bone sociopath...- Rebecca de Mornay shines here as much as her two male partners - and that even if her great beauty is hidden inside bulky baggy clothes, under a not particularly sexy haircut and behind a face on which dirt and grease replaced the makeup...- action scenes are very good and for once in a Hollywood production they do not involve any shooting, which is a really pleasant change...- dialogs are also mostly goodThere are however also some problems with the scenario, which made it impossible for me to give five stars to this film:- I did not appreciate the transformation of two convicted criminal into ""heroes"" or ""good huys"" of the film.- ""lionising"" Manheim was really not necessary, as he himself explains, that his main problem is that he simply doesn't want to work hard at a poorly paid job and accept somebodies directions - but after all it was his own fault that he became a criminal and therefore wasted his resources: brains, guts, strength and charisma...

141091,AKCF45Z2DV6TN,0792838424,"Michael Weber ""fairportfan""","[83, 86]","I'm a railfan -- i try to go to virtually every &quot;train&quot; movie that i hear about.  I've seen some mediocre films (&quot;Breakheart Pass&quot;), some Awful Films (&quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot;) and some  Pretty Good films (&quot;Silver Streak&quot;) that way.And i saw  &quot;Runaway Train&quot; -- an Incredible Film.With Jon Voight  nominated for Both Oscar and Golden Globe (which he won) as Best Actor, and  Eric Roberts nominated for both Oscar and Golden Globe as Best Supporting  Actor, and featuring Rebecca deMornay in a decidedly UN-glamourous role,  this is obviously not your standard action film.And when one adds that  the original screenplay was by Akira Kurosawa, one realises that this is  NOT the usual Golan-Globus production at all, at all.In brief, the story  is simple -- two cons, one old and experienced and dangerous and one young,  cocky and ignorant, break out of a max security prison in Alaska, hop a  train headed for the Lower 48, and find themselves (along with a female  railroad worker) on a hair-raising ride to nowhere on a runaway train with  no brakes and no engineer.But the performances and the nuances make this  film Something Special Indeed.Voight's portrayal of Manny, the man so  dangerous that for three years his cell door was *welded* shut, is scary,  compelling and sympathetic by turns.  &quot;Anything that doesn't kill me  makes me stronger&quot; is his motto.Eric Roberts's performance as the  cocky young loser, destined to spend major parts of his life inside, who  can't even recognise good advice when Manny practically rubs his nose in  it, is at almost the same level, and honestly deserving of the &quot;Best  Supporting&quot; nominations he earned for it.John P. Ryan, as Assistant  Warden Rankin, Manny's antagonist and would-be nemesis, is adequate, but  not up to the level of performance of Voight and Roberts.In the end,  after all of the incredible stunt work and amazing train work, after all of  the violence and emotion, it comes down to two big men (Manny and Rankin)  finally confronting each other, in one final test to prove which is the  stronger.Along the way, Voight, playing the existential monster to the  hilt, gives us a view of a man who knows all too vividly that he long ago  chose the wrong road, but also knows that there is no turning back for  him.When the girl screams at him that he is an animal, he replies  &quot;No -- Worse!  Human!&quot;He tries to set the kid straight --  tells him that if he's smart he'll find a job flipping burgers or scrubbing  toilets, and do it well and earn his pay -- &quot;...and, if you could do  that, you could be President of the United States.&quot;  But the kid knows  better -- he wonders why this big tough guy is talking such nonsense; and  he doesn't hear the longing in Manny's voice.And the final confrontation  and the end -- after one last, horrifying and exhilirating stunt sequence  -- is exactly what the film needs for its perfect conclusion; as  exhilirating and appropriate in its way as the end of &quot;Thelma &amp;  Louise&quot; or of &quot;Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid&quot;.Be  warned -- this is a brutally, horrifyingly violent film (i spent a lot of  time wincing and cringing, reacting in a way that most film violence  doesn't bother me), and the language used, while probably somewhat less  graphic than actual cons would use, is not for Little Old Ladies.Add in  the Almost Perfect portrayal of railroading (there is one major departure  from the way a real railroad would Do Things, but it's necessary for the  film to work, and it *could* happen, i suppose), some incredible  cinematography, and generally perfect design and execution of sets and  costume, and you have got one incredible film experience; a thrill ride you  will NOT soon forget.((Knowing that Kurosawa wrote the original  screenplay and had intended to make this film himself, i kept trying to  guess whether Manny or Rankin would have been played by Toshira Mifune...))",5,Smashing Through All Obstacles...,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,4014,"[""'m"", 'railfan', 'i', 'try', 'go', 'virtually', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'i', 'hear', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mediocre', 'films', 'quot', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'quot', 'Awful', 'Films', 'quot', 'Cassandra', 'Crossing', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Good', 'films', 'quot', 'Silver', 'Streak', 'quot', 'way.And', 'i', 'saw', 'quot', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'quot', 'Incredible', 'Film.With', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'featuring', 'Rebecca', 'deMornay', 'decidedly', 'UN-glamourous', 'role', 'obviously', 'not', 'standard', 'action', 'film.And', 'when', 'one', 'original', 'screenplay', 'was', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'one', 'NOT', 'usual', 'Golan-Globus', 'production', 'all.In', 'brief', 'story', 'simple', 'two', 'cons', 'one', 'old', 'experienced', 'dangerous', 'one', 'young', 'cocky', 'ignorant', 'break', 'max', 'security', 'prison', 'Alaska', 'hop', 'train', 'headed', 'Lower', '48', 'find', 'female', 'railroad', 'worker', 'hair-raising', 'ride', 'nowhere', 'runaway', 'train', 'brakes', 'engineer.But', 'performances', 'nuances', 'make', 'film', 'Something', 'Special', 'Indeed.Voight', 'portrayal', 'Manny', 'man', 'so', 'dangerous', 'three', 'years', 'cell', 'door', 'was', '*welded*', 'shut', 'scary', 'compelling', 'sympathetic', 'turns', 'quot', 'Anything', ""n't"", 'kill', 'stronger', 'quot', 'motto.Eric', 'Roberts', 'performance', 'cocky', 'young', 'loser', 'destined', 'spend', 'major', 'parts', 'life', 'inside', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognise', 'good', 'advice', 'when', 'Manny', 'practically', 'nose', 'almost', 'same', 'level', 'honestly', 'deserving', 'quot', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'quot', 'nominations', 'earned', 'it.John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'Assistant', 'Warden', 'Rankin', 'Manny', 'antagonist', 'would-be', 'nemesis', 'adequate', 'not', 'level', 'performance', 'Voight', 'Roberts.In', 'end', 'incredible', 'stunt', 'work', 'amazing', 'train', 'work', 'violence', 'emotion', 'down', 'two', 'big', 'men', 'Manny', 'Rankin', 'finally', 'confronting', 'other', 'one', 'final', 'test', 'prove', 'stronger.Along', 'way', 'Voight', 'playing', 'existential', 'monster', 'hilt', 'view', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'vividly', 'long', 'ago', 'chose', 'wrong', 'road', 'also', 'turning', 'back', 'him.When', 'girl', 'screams', 'animal', 'quot', 'Worse', 'Human', 'quot', 'set', 'kid', 'straight', 'smart', ""'ll"", 'find', 'job', 'flipping', 'burgers', 'scrubbing', 'toilets', 'do', 'well', 'earn', 'pay', 'quot', 'could', 'do', 'could', 'be', 'President', 'United', 'States.', 'quot', 'kid', 'better', 'why', 'big', 'tough', 'guy', 'talking', 'such', 'nonsense', ""n't"", 'hear', 'longing', 'Manny', 'voice.And', 'final', 'confrontation', 'end', 'one', 'last', 'horrifying', 'exhilirating', 'stunt', 'sequence', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'exhilirating', 'appropriate', 'way', 'end', 'quot', 'Thelma', 'amp', 'Louise', 'quot', 'quot', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'amp', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'quot', 'warned', 'brutally', 'horrifyingly', 'violent', 'film', 'i', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'wincing', 'cringing', 'reacting', 'way', 'most', 'film', 'violence', ""n't"", 'bother', 'language', 'used', 'probably', 'somewhat', 'less', 'graphic', 'actual', 'cons', 'would', 'use', 'not', 'Little', 'Old', 'Ladies.Add', 'Almost', 'Perfect', 'portrayal', 'railroading', 'one', 'major', 'departure', 'way', 'real', 'railroad', 'would', 'Do', 'Things', 'necessary', 'film', 'work', '*could*', 'happen', 'i', 'suppose', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'generally', 'perfect', 'design', 'execution', 'sets', 'costume', 'have', 'got', 'one', 'incredible', 'film', 'experience', 'thrill', 'ride', 'will', 'NOT', 'soon', 'forget', 'Knowing', 'Kurosawa', 'wrote', 'original', 'screenplay', 'had', 'intended', 'make', 'film', 'i', 'kept', 'trying', 'guess', 'Manny', 'Rankin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Toshira', 'Mifune']",N/A

I have never seen it since, though remembered it very clearly.  After I found it for less than $10 (6 pounds) in a UK format, I though what the heck - though I would never buy it for the current (ridiculous) price of $39.  Happily, it stood the test of time.The film starts in the dankest of prisons, run by a warden who is, to say the least, a brutal macho twit.  The ""hero"" is Jon Voight, a murderer at war with the world yet admired by his cohorts as someone of unbendable will and drive to escape.  His idiot sidekick is Bruce Roberts, also a complete loser, who tags along to be near the great man.  After a series of difficulties that underlines their bad personal chemistry, they get stuck on the runaway train.  The atmospherics of these lowlives is exceptionally well done.  There is also the nerdy train-routing specialist, whose foolproof ""system"" turns out to not be up to the task of saving the train.  With great effort, the warden, who personally hates Manny the escapee and enjoys the game, chases down the train for a final confrontation.  The final result is a complete surprise.  Finally, de Mornay is in a pretty dull role, though her conscience does de-escalate the potential violence from time to time.What I didn't remember, which was a great delight, was how Manny talked to the punk sidekick, haranguing  him with a pretty retrograde philosophy of life:  you're on your own so no one can help you but yourself; the recognition that Manny is unable to function in the world and wishes he were able to deal with people in a means other than violence; the necessity of trying.

Ryan) who knows that his prison will be out of control if he fails to get them back...Faced with certain death in the world's most inhospitable climates, Manny and Buck wind up on an unmanned train ignoring that its driver has suffered a heart attack, and the locomotive is rolling into something very fast...Jon Voight completely embodies the brutal convict... The fierce intensity in his eyes, the ferocity in his voice, the hardness to withstand pain, these are indications of his madness... He has an injured hand, a scar around his eye, and a desire for revenge rooted deeply in his thoughts...Though the movie is a character study of the dangerous inmate... We see the aftermath of Manny's last encounter with the warden... We don't get the opportunity to examine his mind or figure out what makes him so fiery... Just like Buck, we're looking at a man at war with world and everybody in it...The film's centerpiece is the showdown between the warden and Manny... At this point it becomes clear that the warden's personal obsession overrides any human consideration... It is a thrilling show... Manny believes in nothing, and is capable of anything...Andrei Konchalovsky depicts prison life with all the usual clich&eacute;s: uptight guards, beatings, and murders... He does an admirable job of taking us into strange figures on a killer train... Konchalovsky crafts a memorable screen moment that reminded me the dramatic sequence of John Huston in Moby Dick...",4,Konchalovsky crafts a memorable screen moment that reminded me the dramatic sequence of John Huston in Moby Dick...,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,2224,"['Based', 'screenplay', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'bloody', 'intense', 'oppressive', 'movie', 'arresting', 'images', 'notorious', 'life', 'term', 'prisoner', 'who', 'been', 'welded', 'hole', '3', 'years', 'psychotic', 'warden', 'who', 'practically', 'dangerous', 'prisoner', 'will', 'make', 'first', 'move', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'excuse', ""'stop"", 'clock', 'film', 'place', 'freezing', 'landscapes', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'where', 'only', 'escape', 'death', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Manny', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'loose', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'unbalanced', 'prizefighter', 'called', 'Buck', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'infected', 'Manny', 'madness', 'escape', 'serious', 'blow', 'obsessive', 'warden', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'who', 'prison', 'will', 'be', 'control', 'get', 'back', 'Faced', 'certain', 'death', 'world', 'most', 'inhospitable', 'climates', 'Manny', 'Buck', 'wind', 'up', 'unmanned', 'train', 'ignoring', 'driver', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'locomotive', 'rolling', 'something', 'very', 'fast', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'completely', 'brutal', 'convict', 'fierce', 'intensity', 'eyes', 'ferocity', 'voice', 'hardness', 'withstand', 'pain', 'are', 'indications', 'madness', 'injured', 'hand', 'scar', 'eye', 'desire', 'revenge', 'rooted', 'deeply', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'character', 'study', 'dangerous', 'inmate', 'see', 'aftermath', 'Manny', 'last', 'encounter', 'warden', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'opportunity', 'examine', 'mind', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'so', 'fiery', 'Just', 'Buck', ""'re"", 'looking', 'man', 'war', 'world', 'everybody', 'film', 'centerpiece', 'showdown', 'warden', 'Manny', 'point', 'clear', 'warden', 'personal', 'obsession', 'human', 'consideration', 'thrilling', 'show', 'Manny', 'nothing', 'capable', 'anything', 'Andrei', 'Konchalovsky', 'prison', 'life', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'uptight', 'guards', 'beatings', 'murders', 'admirable', 'job', 'taking', 'strange', 'figures', 'killer', 'train', 'Konchalovsky', 'memorable', 'screen', 'moment', 'reminded', 'dramatic', 'sequence', 'John', 'Huston', 'Moby', 'Dick']",N/A

It is always gritty and harsh but there is an underlying compassion for its characters who are driven to their doom because they can't escape themselves.  Movies don't get any better that listening to Voight's &quot;Manny&quot; generate a sense of danger by describing in detail to Roberts the power behind being able to get down on your hands and knees and scrub tile grout. In scenes like this and others Manny is brilliant and inspired as he wrings truth out of the dirty rag of his life.  He evokes feelings of pity,grace and redemption yet there is never a moment where you aren't aware he is one of the most dangerous men on the planet.

Unbeknownst to them the driver of that train dies of a heart attack and they are left to defend for themselves as the train barrels through at break-neck speed. The only other passenger is a female train worker. What makes this movie work, along with the amazing stunts and special effects, are the superb acting by the leads played by Jon Voight and Eric Roberts. They play the convicts to the hilt as Voight displays moments when his character is nothing more than an animal who has no regard for human life. Roberts plays the more gentler convict who looks up to the Voight character as his idol. Rebecca DeMornay also stars as the female aboard the train in one of her most unglamorous roles. She pulls off the performance as a tough woman who must defend herself against these convicts while at the same time trying to save her life. The DVD is barebones, but the film comes in both widescreen and full screen formats and the theatrical trailer is included. The single disc is double-sided. Unfortunately ""Runaway Train"" is now out-of-print, but there are some copies available by private sellers on Amazon.

Each time I see it I discover additional nuances in mannerisms, glances, and speech. These subtleties reinforce the characters, their relationships, and the splendidly layered significance of the movie.Miyamoto Musashi, the Japanese samurai-turned-author, wrote ""Do nothing which is of no purpose."" If you're annoyed by the plot, characters, or dialogue, as some reviewers are, I suggest thinking about why it was done that way. For example, some people are irritated by Eric Roberts' character Buck, but they miss the point. He's supposed to be annoying, and  his annoying nature has meaning in terms of who he is underneath and his decisions/abilities/limitations. His reason for existence in the train's rolling philosophy discourse is to serve a purpose for the group, and to make us think about how the other characters relate to him.Put it on the biggest television or screen you can find, turn the lights down, turn the volume waaaaay up, and watch it without distraction. The key to this movie is to immerse yourself in it.

I wonder how much it's due to the script by Akira Kurosawa but in the end a powerful saga about freedom and fate was created. The story is about two convicts running away from the prison but is much more than that. It is full of symbolics. The movie is made in 1985 but it's as watchable today as probably 18 years ago. Jon Voight is phenomenal and Eric Roberts is also very very good. The rest of the cast is not on the same level (especially John P. Ryan, who plays Jon Voight protagonist) but it's probably not that's important. The cinematography is amasing. The scenes of running train in Alaska wilderness are breathtaking.

141104,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792838424,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","How ""Runaway Train"" bombed at the box office in December, 1985, I'll never know because it's the perfect blend of blockbuster thrills and weighty subtext.The story involves Manny (Jon Voight), a notorious prison hero, who escapes a maximum security prison in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts). They stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives whose engineer has a heart attack and the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.""Runaway Train"" is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest; the thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's ""at war with the world and everyone in it."" When called an animal he replies, ""No, worse -- human!""This is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.There's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own ""partner"". You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, completely spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.Powerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts -- like the aforementioned -- are timeless.Rebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an ""animal"" on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.The film was shot in Montana and Alaska and runs 111 minutes.GRADE: A+",5,Magnificent masterpiece,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,3400,"['How', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'December', '1985', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'perfect', 'blend', 'blockbuster', 'thrills', 'weighty', 'subtext.The', 'story', 'Manny', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'notorious', 'prison', 'hero', 'who', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'frozen', 'wastelands', 'Alaska', 'joined', 'naive', 'follower', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'stow', 'away', 'train', 'consisting', 'four', 'locomotives', 'engineer', 'heart', 'attack', 'train', 'away', 'Meanwhile', 'arrogant', 'warden', 'John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'warpath', 'Manny', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'powerful', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'thrilling', 'events', 'are', 'actually', 'stage', 'fascinating', 'study', 'human', 'condition', 'Manny', 'hardened', 'convict', 'who', 'war', 'world', 'everyone', 'When', 'called', 'animal', 'No', 'worse', 'human', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'thing', 'freedom', 'too', 'far', 'gone', 'make', 'conventional', 'society', 'shares', 'parable', 'dumb', 'partner', 'made', 'up', 'spot', 'having', 'menial', 'job', 'submitting', 'boss', 'even', 'might', 'want', 'rip', 'throat', 'out', 'key', 'making', 'society', 'submitting', 'authority', 'resisting', 'rage', 'then', 'getting', 'check', 'payday', 'enjoying', 'fruits', 'thereof', 'Manny', 'could', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'So', 'what', 'hope', 'there', 'modern', 'society', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'then', 'why', 'escaping', 'prison', 'other', 'words', 'Manny', 'hope', 'even', 'escape', 'successful', 'freedom', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'one', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'understand', 'why', 'potent', 'scene', 'where', 'Manny', 'knife', 'mercilessly', 'own', 'partner', 'see', 'rage', 'face', 'cornered', 'animal', 'intense', 'emotions', 'are', 'vented', 'Manny', 'suddenly', 'then', 'just', 'over', 'completely', 'spent', 'character', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'afraid', 'somehow', 'understands', 'compassionately', 'out', 'semi-embrace.Powerful', 'scenes', 'are', 'combined', 'surreal', 'images', 'misshapen', 'barreling', 'down', 'tracks', 'freezing', 'wilderness', 'accompanied', 'ominous', 'score', 'Trevor', 'Jones', 'parts', 'score', 'scream', 'mid-80s', 'other', 'parts', 'aforementioned', 'are', 'timeless.Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'atypical', 'role', 'railroad', 'worker', 'who', 'convicts', 'intuitively', 'macho', 'posturing', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'dangerous', 'also', ""'re"", 'not', 'wholly', 'evil', 'Roberts', 'basically', 'kid', 'heart', 'Manny', 'just', 'blinded', 'incredible', 'rage', 'only', 'irredeemable', 'stupid', 'pride', 'built', 'up', 'years', 'hardened', 'confinement.Voight', 'near', 'unrecognizable', 'Manny', 'Roberts', 'just', 'superb', 'dumb', 'sidekick', 'two', 'De', 'Mornay', 'are', 'examples', 'acting', 'finest.John', 'P.', 'Ryan', 'very', 'effective', 'machismo', 'warden', 'Ranken', 'Captain', 'Ahab-like', 'role', 'off', 'too', 'comic', 'booky', 'be', 'plausible', 'Ranken', 'can', 'be', 'animal', 'outside', 'prison', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'inside', 'Manny', 'Ranken', 'are', 'corrupted', 'pride', 'Manny', 'least', 'knows', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'gone', 'recognize', 'who', 'are', 'worthy', 'life', 'respond', 'accordingly.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Montana', 'Alaska', '111', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A+']",N/A
