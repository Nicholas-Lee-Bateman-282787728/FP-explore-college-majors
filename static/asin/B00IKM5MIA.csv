1694414,A1Z1VAFA9YUWND,B00IKM5MIA,amazon,"[1, 2]","Thought-provoking movie.I am sure the author from which this movie was made, Saramago, doesn't even realize what he wrote. The movie is a confusion of several elements. First of all, the 'spider' motif plays throughout the whole movie. From the beginning sex-scene a spider is presented, then you see a giant spider hovering over the city and a cobweb around the city. Then the movie confuses us with the history teacher lecturing about what is control....the Spider is the metaphor for control. The 2 men are the flies in film. The spider is the woman, the city, the apartment and all the environmental accoutrement, from clothing they wear, the car they drive and the place they live.Then the movie follows the lives of 2 men, who might be really the same person, one is a dark alter-ego with strange sexual tastes and the other is a mild-mannered and repressed history professor. As the movie goes on the complexity of the movie explodes, into a intricate psychological web, and reality of the 2 men become blurred as different realities merge into one. Are these 2 men identical men or the same person? Isabella Rossini, who plays the mother gives us a clue when she says ""You have a respectable job and a nice apartment, why don't you give up your 3rd rate acting job?"" This poses a conundrum now.  Are they 2 separate flies trying to switch places or the same one?  What is the answer? You decide....I can see why a lot of people here criticize this ending as the worst they have every seen, because the movie was set in a realistic manner and suddenly it becomes a Kafka-esque ending. Saramago presents a masterpiece work of fiction from his unconscious mind....the problem is no one wants to use their brains to figure out what has happened.

1694416,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00IKM5MIA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I can honestly say that I&#8217;ve never seen a film quite like &#8216;Enemy&#8217;.  I&#8217;ve been sitting on this review for the better part of a week (or two) trying to mull over in my head all the things that could possibly be said about it without looking at anything that anyone else has said about it, because at the end of the day (or at least for a review&#8217;s purpose) I&#8217;d like these ideas and these thoughts to be my own.What is weird is that what I take away from a film like &#8216;Enemy&#8217; almost seems too simple.Sitting down to watch &#8216;Enemy&#8217;, I had a lot of conflicting feelings.  First, I was fresh off of a very disappointing experience with &#8216;Prisoners&#8217;, which was one of my least favorite films from 2013.  I had zero faith in Denis Villeneuve as a director, and yet the many, MANY faults with &#8216;Prisoners&#8217; lied more in the script than anything else.  And in that regard, this film was an adaptation of a novel by Jose Saramago, and while I have NOT read this particular novel, I have read &#8216;Blindness&#8217; and that novel was exceptional.  The film version was not, but there was at least hope here.  So, I was torn, but all the favorable responses to the film made me really anxious to see how it all came together.I&#8217;m still not sure how it came together, but it came together and I kind of loved it!The premise is simple.  Adam, a teacher, stumbles across his doppelganger in a movie and becomes obsessed with tracking him down.  Turns out, his other self is an actor with a pregnant wife and a penchant for infidelity and soon after meeting this double, named Anthony, becomes consumed with taking advantage of Adam any way he can.  What isn&#8217;t simple is the way that the visual coexists with the subliminal to create a story that feels so layered and so deep and so profound and yet so hard to put your finger on.For me, &#8216;Enemy&#8217; is the struggle for self-identity.  I never once saw this as the story of two men but as the story of one man trying desperately to come to terms with who he was, and exploring every facet of his personality to the point where they splinter and take on their own lives, threatening to derail his very existence.  The way that the two men&#8217;s worlds start to blend together in ways that almost place them inside these worlds, even when they don&#8217;t belong (I think the scene with the mother is very telling) helps formulate this idea in my mind, for it establishes an inconsistency that feels purposeful.But I understand that this is just one man&#8217;s opinion.The great thing about &#8216;Enemy&#8217; is that it honestly feels like a deep pool of discussion.  The only other film this year that felt this polarizing, but in a good way, was &#8216;Noah&#8217;.  Both films share the ability to deliver ambiguity in a way that feels meaningful.  &#8216;Noah&#8217; was far more straightforward than &#8216;Enemy&#8217;, and the basic themes are pretty clear, but both film really rely on personal audience interpretation to make the needed impact.  &#8216;Enemy&#8217; delivers strongly here, for it feels like an open-ended discussion, which helps make a personal connection to the audience.  Many will walk away dumbfounded, especially because of that final frame, but that dumbfounded feeling should turn into a yearning for answers, answers that only you can provide.The film is propelled by Villeneuve&#8217;s dialed in direction, coaxing so much atmosphere out of every frame and creating a feeling that overwhelms in all the right places.  Couple that with a very strong ensemble, and an especially strong performance by Jake Gyllenhaal (his career best?) that shows so many shades not just to the characters but to the story itself, and you have a really vibrant film that will stay with you and continue to haunt and prod at your mind.",5,My spider sense is tingling&#8230;,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,3885,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', '8217', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'quite', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', '8217', 'been', 'sitting', 'review', 'better', 'part', 'week', 'two', 'trying', 'mull', 'head', 'things', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'said', 'looking', 'anything', 'anyone', 'else', 'said', 'end', 'day', 'least', 'review', '8217', 'purpose', '8217', 'd', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'be', 'own.What', 'weird', 'what', 'take', 'away', 'film', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'almost', 'too', 'simple.Sitting', 'down', 'watch', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'had', 'lot', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'First', 'was', 'fresh', 'very', 'disappointing', 'experience', '8216', 'Prisoners', '8217', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'films', '2013', 'had', 'zero', 'faith', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', 'director', 'yet', 'many', 'MANY', 'faults', '8216', 'Prisoners', '8217', 'lied', 'more', 'script', 'anything', 'else', 'regard', 'film', 'was', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Jose', 'Saramago', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'particular', 'novel', 'have', 'read', '8216', 'Blindness', '8217', 'novel', 'was', 'exceptional', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'was', 'least', 'hope', 'here', 'So', 'was', 'torn', 'favorable', 'responses', 'film', 'made', 'really', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'came', 'together.I', '8217', 'm', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'came', 'together', 'came', 'together', 'kind', 'loved', 'premise', 'simple', 'Adam', 'teacher', 'doppelganger', 'movie', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'tracking', 'down', 'out', 'other', 'self', 'actor', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'penchant', 'infidelity', 'soon', 'meeting', 'double', 'named', 'Anthony', 'consumed', 'taking', 'advantage', 'Adam', 'way', 'can', 'What', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'simple', 'way', 'visual', 'coexists', 'subliminal', 'create', 'story', 'so', 'layered', 'so', 'deep', 'so', 'profound', 'yet', 'so', 'hard', 'put', 'finger', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'struggle', 'self-identity', 'never', 'once', 'saw', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'trying', 'desperately', 'come', 'terms', 'who', 'was', 'exploring', 'facet', 'personality', 'point', 'where', 'splinter', 'take', 'own', 'lives', 'threatening', 'derail', 'very', 'existence', 'way', 'two', 'men', '8217', 'worlds', 'start', 'blend', 'together', 'ways', 'almost', 'place', 'worlds', 'even', 'when', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'scene', 'mother', 'very', 'telling', 'formulate', 'idea', 'mind', 'inconsistency', 'purposeful.But', 'understand', 'just', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'opinion.The', 'great', 'thing', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'honestly', 'deep', 'pool', 'discussion', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'year', 'felt', 'polarizing', 'good', 'way', 'was', '8216', 'Noah', '8217', 'films', 'share', 'ability', 'deliver', 'ambiguity', 'way', 'meaningful', '8216', 'Noah', '8217', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'straightforward', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'basic', 'themes', 'are', 'pretty', 'clear', 'film', 'really', 'rely', 'personal', 'audience', 'interpretation', 'make', 'needed', 'impact', '8216', 'Enemy', '8217', 'delivers', 'strongly', 'here', 'open-ended', 'discussion', 'make', 'personal', 'connection', 'audience', 'Many', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'dumbfounded', 'especially', 'final', 'frame', 'dumbfounded', 'feeling', 'should', 'turn', 'yearning', 'answers', 'answers', 'only', 'can', 'provide.The', 'film', 'propelled', 'Villeneuve', '8217', 's', 'dialed', 'direction', 'coaxing', 'so', 'much', 'frame', 'creating', 'feeling', 'right', 'places', 'Couple', 'very', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'especially', 'strong', 'performance', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'career', 'best', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'story', 'have', 'really', 'vibrant', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'continue', 'haunt', 'prod', 'mind']",Enemy Digital
1694417,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00IKM5MIA,Argyle Ronin,"[1, 2]","Enemy is a weird movie that uses a typically non-threatening theme (doubles) and turns it into a taut, psychological showdown between two men defending their identities. This is director Denis Villeneuve's 2nd outing with actor Jake Gyllenhaal after last year's Prisoners, also starring Jake. Make no mistake, Enemy's budget is tiny in comparison and is completely different in story and style.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a dual role, as both bumbling history prof Adam Bell and 3rd-rate actor Anthony Claire. They are, for all intents and purposes, identical in every single way. Adam's naive curiosity leads him to discover this doppelganger, who pops up as an extra in a random movie recommended by a friend. When the two meet in person, Anthony seizes the opportunity to demolish Adam's life.The plodding soundtrack and hazy-yellow color palette reek of equal parts confusion, dread, and fear. Adam's struggle with his double is reminiscent of Fight Club, where narrator Ed Norton projects his split personality onto a non-existent character played by Brad Pitt. In this way, Anthony Claire is Enemy's outspoken response to Adam Bell's inherent sheepishness. By the time the two characters collide to bring an end to each other's unique existence, the film screeches to a roaring halt in one bizarre final scene.This is a difficult movie to grasp for non-movie goers, and many reviews will tell you this. Watch close to spot how the director interweaves spider life into the various scenes; the symbolism is best left open to interpretation by Denis Villeneuve himself. If you enjoy slow-building psychological flicks, give this one a shot.

The name alone may not be something you recognize, but you've probably seen him as the exhilarating lead in ""Source Code"" and several other films like ""End of Watch"" and last year's ""Prisoners"". He's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and almost always provides an impeccable performance that won't let you forget his face. His latest part in the mind-bending mystery `Enemy' does just the same, and he proves once again how spectacular he can be.This slow burning thriller follows a depressed history professor named Adam (Gyllenhaal) who unexpectedly, while watching a movie, discovers an actor who could be his twin. On a mission to meet this man, he stalks, and eventually finds him. We see their lives quickly become intertwined, even if it may not be in the greatest of ways.

1694438,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00IKM5MIA,Doug Park,"[1, 2]","{3.5 stars}I enjoyed ENEMY but understand the negative reviews. Those who want a really solid storyline that makes complete sense will definitely NOT enjoy it. Still, I'm a little surprised that the overall rating is this low. The overall rating on IMDb, btw, is quite high: 6.9 as of today.ENEMY is a strange, solipsistic, rather Kafkaesque Canadian production based on a novel by Portuguese author Jos&eacute; Saramago. Introverted history professor Adam Bell, well-played by Jake Gyllenhaal, discovers his apparent doppelganger in B-movie actor Anthony ""Daniel"" St. Claire. Bell's girlfriend and St. Claire's pregnant wife--similarly well-played by M&eacute;lanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon respectively--also bear a more-than-passing ""incidental"" resemblance to each other. After a brief stalking by Bell, the two men meet and discover that they are indeed perfect facsimiles of each other. They both try to keep things congenial and then go their own ways, but that, of course, simply cannot happen. The first hour of this dark, humorless film is pretty draggy, but some weird and unexpected stuff happens in the last 30-40 minutes. A lot's open to interpretation, but ENEMY's whole conflict, it seems, has two basic possibilities that I won't give away.A sort of poor man'sFight Club, ENEMY raises the questions, ""What if I were to meet someone who looks and talks exactly like me, with certain personality likenesses as well as certain differences, who's led a completely different life than me? Would we like each other? (And how much do we like ourselves?) Would we want to trade places?""While definitely not for all tastes, ENEMY is nothing if not different. Though the budget was obviously low and the scope is limited, it's generally well-produced. One final thing: I can't make up my mind about the constant synthesized drum-rolls and ""mm-MMMMB!"" sounds. Though they add suspense to this simple but intriguing film, sometimes it seems that less would be more here.",4,"""Did you have a good day at school?""",1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1974,"['3.5', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'ENEMY', 'understand', 'negative', 'reviews', 'who', 'want', 'really', 'solid', 'storyline', 'complete', 'sense', 'will', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'enjoy', 'Still', ""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'overall', 'rating', 'low', 'overall', 'rating', 'IMDb', 'btw', 'quite', 'high', '6.9', 'today.ENEMY', 'strange', 'solipsistic', 'rather', 'Kafkaesque', 'Canadian', 'production', 'based', 'novel', 'Portuguese', 'author', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Saramago', 'Introverted', 'history', 'professor', 'Adam', 'Bell', 'well-played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'apparent', 'doppelganger', 'B-movie', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Daniel', 'St.', 'Claire', 'Bell', 'girlfriend', 'St.', 'Claire', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'similarly', 'well-played', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'Sarah', 'Gadon', 'respectively', 'also', 'bear', 'more-than-passing', 'incidental', 'resemblance', 'other', 'brief', 'stalking', 'Bell', 'two', 'men', 'meet', 'discover', 'are', 'indeed', 'perfect', 'facsimiles', 'other', 'try', 'keep', 'things', 'congenial', 'then', 'go', 'own', 'ways', 'course', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'happen', 'first', 'hour', 'dark', 'humorless', 'film', 'pretty', 'draggy', 'weird', 'unexpected', 'stuff', 'last', '30-40', 'minutes', 'lot', 'open', 'interpretation', 'ENEMY', 'whole', 'conflict', 'two', 'basic', 'possibilities', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away.A', 'sort', 'poor', ""man'sFight"", 'Club', 'ENEMY', 'questions', 'What', 'were', 'meet', 'someone', 'who', 'talks', 'exactly', 'certain', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'differences', 'who', 'led', 'completely', 'different', 'life', 'Would', 'like', 'other', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'like', 'Would', 'want', 'trade', 'places', 'definitely', 'not', 'tastes', 'ENEMY', 'nothing', 'not', 'different', 'budget', 'was', 'obviously', 'low', 'scope', 'limited', 'generally', 'well-produced', 'One', 'final', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'constant', 'synthesized', 'drum-rolls', 'mm-MMMMB', 'add', 'suspense', 'simple', 'intriguing', 'film', 'less', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'here']",Enemy Digital

1694441,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00IKM5MIA,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","I really liked this movie. Wish I knew what it was about.Here's the scoop. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Adam, a history professor who is pretty much sleepwalking through life and has a relationship with his wife(?) that seems less than romantic. He watches a movie and recognizes that one of the bit actors looks way too much like him. He sets out to track the actor down and what he finds turns the creep scale on its ear.I like these kinds of movies and this style seems to be on the rise with films such as ""Under the Skin,"" ""Upstream Color"" et al. This is really eerie. It's set on Toronto with a sickly green mist everywhere. Most of the architecture shows little style so the viewer feels they're in a lifeless, grey world. he really creepy stuff starts when the Adam meets his lookalike Anthony.. Things go way beyond just looking alike. Then there is the similarities in their wives and past girlfriends/ spouses. There are a thousand subtle touches and strong use of leit motif, particularly that of spiders,  that keep teasing the viewer's mind. The music score added to the creep factor as well. This is all just very unsettling, and when you get to the final shot, You're about ready to throw it all out the window and jump after it.Gyllenhaal does a great job in both roles. The perspective wives are also good. Isabella Rossellini might have been good given a few more lines to chew. The cinematography, color palette, lighting and editing were all of professional grade.

Give this guy some points: his physical bearing is very different, based on which character he is playing. I was impressed.* M&eacute;lanie Lauren (&#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34;) is the professor's girlfriend, far more patient with his moods than I would expect.* Sarah Gadon (Lots of TV) is the actor's porcelain-skinned, very pregnant wife.

It had gloomy lighting and mystifying relationships, plus unexplained weeping. These were compounded by two unlikable characters, each with an identical scar on his torso...which is never explained.The music, photography and production design all send portentous signals that all is not as it seems, particularly when the spider theme keeps showing up.

This wasn't helped much by seeing the star and director declare that the movie was about the &#34;subconcious&#34;. Oh my goodness, aren't they just tooooo smart for us. Except for the fact that anyone who knows much about psychology knows that the &#34;subconcious&#34; isn't even accepted as a valid term. I am a PhD and study cognitive processes, we refer to the term &#34;unconcious&#34; or &#34;automatic thinking process&#34; as a way to capture that not everything we do is done with a tremendous amount of forethought. But the idea that anyone can conceptualize (let alone create a movie about) unconcious thought processes is at best New Age BS or psuedo-intellectualism. And the fact that it includes large arachnids is laughable and absurd.Now normally I would even give an absurd movie a decent review. But not one that takes itself so seriously and has so many other shortcomings. Beyond the obvious absurdity of the movie, the acting was wooden and the cinematography was horrible (there is a difference between gray - the other movie with Villenueve and Gyllenhaal, &#34;Prisoners&#34;, gets it right - and simply out of focus and fuzzy).

1694457,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B00IKM5MIA,Kurt Russell,"[4, 5]","Wow, looking at the other reviews, people are all over the place on this film. From the lovers to the haters, there are some seriously different perspectives and explanations for the surreal events of this cerebral and suspenseful thriller.So this film is definitely NOT for people who want an easy, straight-foward movie. I'd say offhand it's closest to something like a Lynch film. But while I generally detest Lynch's work as taking far too many liberties with curveball nonsense to pad the strangeness of the experience with weird for the sake of weird, I find this film to be almost the opposite - It is still a strange and haunting film, yet possesses a much more serious and singular tone while being driven by a very precise logic. But even the most minute details have been designed to provoke fierce discussion and examination.The score is astounding one of the best I've ever heard, with restless strings and horns filling the silence, where even the most mundane scenes have a palpable sense of mystery and fear.Once you get into things, there's just so much to love:- Nonlinear storytelling- Intense, ubiquitous symbolism- Every line of dialog hides bits of code that support the major themes of identity, fidelity, oppression and morality.- One of the wildest endings in all of film- Flawless cinematography and production design- Great acting- The strange blend of its insane plot makes for a very unique experience from the usual Hollywood fare.In the tradition of other mind-bending masterpieces like &#34;2001,&#34; &#34;Donnie Darko,&#34; and &#34;Jacob's Ladder,&#34; the viewer may not immediately know exactly what happened and why, but the right kind of audience who is game for artistic and head-scratching puzzles will enjoy piecing everything together.My personal SPOILER explanation of the film:There are 3 different tricks that are possibly happening throughout the film:1) The chronology is out of order. Say, the car accident is really at the beginning, the club sequence is at the end, all feeding into the idea of the inevitable doom of history repeating itself a loop.2) There is only one protagonist torn into 2 schizophrenic identities. One is weak and tender, the other aggressive and brutal. Both try to reconcile themselves over the duality of faithfulness versus infidelity. Example: how both men have the same photo in their possession.3) The alien spider-women have imprisoned men in a fake reality. Sure, the spiders may all be metaphors for trapping him. Or maybe they are actually real too.

It is a very deep and thought provoking film. There is a lot to take in, much to view and even times to pause and think about what is happening. In the end, I let the credits roll and just sat and thought. Then I understood what the film was all about. Very cool style and brilliantly filmed and acted by all involved.The PQ is decent, but a little inconsistent at times. There are some extremely sharp shots, however some of the darker scenes seem cloudy or not as dark as they should be. There were a lot of filtered shots, hazing and other film techniques used, so much of that could have been intentional. The audio is decent, however even when blasting there were a few lines which seemed muffled or too low. Again, maybe intentional.The extras are short and simple, which I am fine with for a movie like this. There is simply a behind the scenes documentary.This movie is very odd and probably not like anything you've seen before. again, it can be taken many ways. Some may not be able to get through half of it because it's just too weird, however I loved it an couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I feel this movie is geared more toward men, and I can relate to both Jake Gyllenhaal characters. Women, which have been with men who have been in these situation may also be able to relate. There are two strong female characters in this as well as a wonderful performance by Isabella Rossellini as the mother.Rated R for nudity/sex and some language. The dislike for this film is by those who never took the time to understand it. I understood it and it touched me and I related to it. It's not all about spiders. Watch it and you will discover what the spider is to the character(s). Think about it before you hate it.

I also thought that the cinematography and the score added a lot to the overall atmosphere, with a dingy yellow tint on most of the scenes and moments punctuated with dissonant strings.

1694484,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00IKM5MIA,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","&#34;Enemy&#34; is a collison of an art house film and thriller which means that, while it does have suspense, it is of the slow cooking variety. Nevertheless, &#34;Enemy&#34; fails to be a cohesive film in my opinion and while there are parts of it I enjoyed, the over all impact is less than the sum of its parts.The arty elements aren't a problem with the film but it's the execution and lack of strong character development/pacing that undoes the film. The turgid pacing and heavy handed symbolism of the film does it no favors and, without a strong, compelling narrative &#34;Enemy&#34; just isn't all that involving.SPOILERS:Jake Gyllenhaal stars plays two parts in &#34;Enemey&#34;; He plays a professor named Adam teaching political science at a University and plays his double a small time actor named Anthony. When the Adam sees the Anthony in a film, he becomes obsessed with finding out who this person is and if they are anything like him. They have parallel but differing lives and are very different in terms of personality. Once they finally meet Adam decides he can't handle it and breaks off any further discussion but Anthony now becomes obsessed with Adam and his life. He insists that Adam switch lives with him briefly.END OF SPOILERS:&#34;Enemy&#34; is largely sustained by a terrific pair of performances from Gyllenhaal and while the director Denis Villeneuve (&#34;Prisoners&#34;) stages his scenes well, the film doesn't built with any sense of momentum to its unusual (but not unexpected) conclusion. The idea of doubles has been done before on TV, films (&#34;The Man Who Haunted Himself&#34; most notably) and less literarily in &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34; among others. Villenuve uses heavy handed symbolism (particularly the recurring motif of the spiders) and fails to develop his secondary characters which works to the disadvantage of the film--if you don't care about either of the main characters or the premise, you'll find yourself bored.While &#34;Enemy&#34; has its moments mostly due to Gyllenhaal's performance, it fails to gel as an effective thriller.Rent it.",2,"The ""Enemy"" of this film is a strong, compelling plot and lack of character development.",1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2107,"['34', 'Enemy', '34', 'collison', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'thriller', 'have', 'suspense', 'slow', 'cooking', 'variety', 'Nevertheless', '34', 'Enemy', '34', 'fails', 'be', 'cohesive', 'film', 'opinion', 'are', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'impact', 'less', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'arty', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'film', 'execution', 'lack', 'strong', 'character', 'development/pacing', 'film', 'turgid', 'pacing', 'heavy', 'handed', 'symbolism', 'film', 'favors', 'strong', 'compelling', 'narrative', '34', 'Enemy', '34', 'just', ""n't"", 'involving.SPOILERS', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'two', 'parts', '34', 'Enemey', '34', 'professor', 'named', 'Adam', 'teaching', 'political', 'science', 'University', 'double', 'small', 'time', 'actor', 'named', 'Anthony', 'When', 'Adam', 'Anthony', 'film', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'person', 'are', 'anything', 'have', 'parallel', 'differing', 'lives', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'terms', 'personality', 'Once', 'finally', 'meet', 'Adam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'breaks', 'off', 'further', 'discussion', 'Anthony', 'now', 'obsessed', 'Adam', 'life', 'Adam', 'switch', 'lives', 'briefly.END', 'SPOILERS', '34', 'Enemy', '34', 'largely', 'sustained', 'terrific', 'pair', 'performances', 'Gyllenhaal', 'director', 'Denis', 'Villeneuve', '34', 'Prisoners', '34', 'scenes', 'well', 'film', ""n't"", 'built', 'sense', 'momentum', 'unusual', 'not', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'idea', 'doubles', 'been', 'done', 'TV', 'films', '34', 'Man', 'Who', 'Haunted', 'Himself', '34', 'most', 'notably', 'less', 'literarily', '34', 'Strangers', 'Train', '34', 'others', 'Villenuve', 'heavy', 'handed', 'symbolism', 'particularly', 'recurring', 'motif', 'spiders', 'develop', 'secondary', 'characters', 'disadvantage', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'main', 'characters', 'premise', ""'ll"", 'find', 'bored.While', '34', 'Enemy', '34', 'moments', 'mostly', 'due', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'gel', 'effective', 'thriller.Rent']",Enemy Digital

1694487,AP3B615GM191G,B00IKM5MIA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 4]","Before I even actually start reviewing this movie, this is a very specific caveat that must be made: Are you the type of movie-goer who likes to settle in with a bucket of popcorn, a large coke, and kind of mentally check out for two hours?  If that describes your cinema tastes, run as fast as you can in the other direction RIGHT NOW!  This is NOT the movie for you.  In fact, it will most likely be the worst movie you have ever seen in your entire life (hence the multiple one-star ratings it has currently garnered).For a basic plot summary (heh, heh...good luck!), &#34;Enemy&#34; tells the story of Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a college professor who seems to be just coasting through life.  One night, while watching a movie, he discovers a doppleganger within the film.  Anthony (also Gyllenhaal) looks EXACTLY like him.  Adam tracks down Anthony, the two meet, and the tension/mystery continues to build over just what the heck is going on here.  To say anything more would be to start spoiling the fun (although is it possible to spoil what you can't quite understand in the first place?!).Like I said, this is a movie for deep-thinkers.  Those who like to go to the cinema to be challenged intellectually instead of just entertained.  I sound pretentious saying that, but I don't mean to be.  There is a reason why this film didn't get anything near a mass release (mostly art-house theaters...I think it came to one theater in my entire state of Minnesota): it doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  When watching &#34;Enemy&#34;, you have to be &#34;dialed in&#34; at all times...no texting, multi-tasking, or other distractions of any kind.  Every detail could be (and likely is) important when all is said and done.This is the kind of movie that cannot be &#34;figured out&#34; in the traditional sense.  It does not tie anything up in a nice bow.  In fact, it doesn't even bring wrapping paper (!).  Instead, the viewer is left to figure everything out in the end.  If you see this as a challenge and not a burden, you are the audience this movie is made for.  All others need not apply.I can hardly believe that I'm giving this movie a full five stars.  I'm usually the first to complain about &#34;strange endings&#34; or something being &#34;too artsy&#34;.  However, this film is so well-crafted in the hands of director Denis Villeneuve that it continues to grow on me every time I think about it.  Immediately after viewing, this would have been a three-star movie.  A day later?  Up to four stars.  Two days later?  A five-star review.  There are not too many movies floating around that can prompt such deep thought and evaluation.
