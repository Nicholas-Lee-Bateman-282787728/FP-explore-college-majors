Anyways, this book - by Phillip Jose Farmer - didn't catch my intrest ay that tender age; but the movie was very nice. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing really new; but very interesting all the same, and extremely well made. The CGI is great, the acting is at least as good as most big-budget movies these days. The history might be a little slippery (Emperor Nero as a swordfighter fighting a mongol warrior? Um.... )  but the rest of it is a real gem. I enjoyed it and, should a miracle occur and it turn into the series this was intended to be a start to, I would watch that too.Plot: an astronaut dies. Then he wakes up - in a bubble, in a river full of other bubbles. He's first awake, and his wake-up is a little different from everyone else's. They stagger out of the river - and after a little bit they meet their welcoming committee.",4,Interesting,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,957,"['long', 'time', 'when', 'earth', 'was', 'little', 'cooler', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'Ok', ""'m"", 'not', 'old', 'Anyways', 'book', 'Phillip', 'Jose', 'Farmer', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'intrest', 'ay', 'tender', 'age', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'Nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'very', 'interesting', 'same', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'CGI', 'great', 'acting', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'days', 'history', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'slippery', 'Emperor', 'Nero', 'swordfighter', 'fighting', 'mongol', 'warrior', 'Um', 'rest', 'real', 'gem', 'enjoyed', 'should', 'miracle', 'occur', 'turn', 'series', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'start', 'would', 'watch', 'too.Plot', 'astronaut', 'dies', 'Then', 'up', 'bubble', 'river', 'full', 'other', 'bubbles', 'first', 'awake', 'wake-up', 'little', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'stagger', 'river', 'little', 'bit', 'meet', 'welcoming', 'committee']",Riverworld
850404,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0002Y4TWE,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","Based very loosely on Philip Jose Farmer's book(s), this was intended as the pilot for a TV series, and so has an unfinished aspect. Much of what was a part of the book Riverworld is barely suggested here, but if you can view it as an adventure, without thinking about the books, or if you've never read the books, you will probably enjoy this quite a lot.Riverworld is not heaven or hell, but it is populated by people who have died on earth. There is exactly one alien, because he happened to be visiting the earth when he died. And there is exactly one child, but nobody seems to know why. Everyone else is a physically healthy adult. People who died of old age are young again, including Sam Clemens and Alice Liddle.Food and clothing are provided anonymously through a series of mushroom-shaped structures and canisters. The canisters were on the beach as they came ashore, and contained clothing. The next morning, the mushroom towers had holes in the sides where a canister inserted came out with food in it. Although the people who came ashore as a batch with our hero (an astronaut from 2009) were from very different eras and countries, they all seem to speak English. That is, whatever they believe they are speaking is understood by all the others, and it's English as far as the audience is concerned.But it doesn't take long to discover that there are a great many more people who have been there longer, and have built their own little societies. And almost inevitably, they come into conflict. Why? The mushrooms provide sustenance, so what's the point of fighting? The best explanation is illustrated by the king of the Vandals and by Nero. There is something about having power and control over others that seems to be necessary to their sense of manhood.Then there's women to fight over, and also women to do some pretty fierce fighting themselves. There's a pagan priestess who fights better than most of the men, in fact.There's also Sam Clemens and his riverboat, built with the help of the single alien who powers it with something otherworldly. And a few good hammer blows from Alice when the mechanism fails to start up.As I say, it was designed to be a pilot for a series. Sort of a pity the series was never made.

I wasn't disappointed. It was obvious it meant to be a pilot for a series but unfortunately it never got picked up by the networks. Ashame as I think this had potential. Hopefully someday someone may retry to make a series based on the books. In the meantime I suggest you check this movie out. A modern astronaut finds himself on a beach of a strange world. The people he meets are fairly similar to what he has known on Earth but the era seems like a conglomeration of eras from Earth's past and the planet economy is centered on river travel. In order to get around he takes passage on a steam paddlewheeler. My only complaint is this was obviosuly a pilot for a series that never happened.

850408,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B0002Y4TWE,Daisy Brambletoes,"[1, 2]","I will say this - the film did inspire me to read the original five books which, despite their tendancy to lengthy pontifications, are still fun to read and full of surprises, as well as some unavoidable cliches.As a sci-fi channel mini-series, it would have worked well if the studio had chosen to follow the novels and the original story, They did not. It used elements from the first two books, but the only characters who remained intact from the original were Alice, Sam, Lev, Gwenafra, and the alien Monat, though he is more or less combined with Joe Miller, the lovable hulk who follows Sam loyally through most of the series.However, being a 90-minute TV production, it seems to have been clearly intended as a series pilot.  For a continuous series of adventures, the cast of new characters would have been the most workable.  They would not have been tied to the existing story line in quite the same way, and after all, in the Riverworld, everyone (and I do mean everyone) is there, so any characters can exist.This film seemed to try having it both ways: new characters as well as old, a different story set within the same premise.  Sam Clemens was a lot more likable than his book counterpart, as was the alien, Monat.  But there were a number of things that I personlly found very bothersome.  First of all, instead of all of the human race being resurrected simultaneously, the citizens of Riverworld seem to be arriving in waves every few years.  There were also horses, which did not exist in the Riverworld at all.  The grail canisters were a disappointment because in the books they provided not only clothing, but fine, full meals instead of the icky green-and-yellow strips of what looked like epoxy ribbons!  But the most annoying part of all was the arrival of the Emperor Nero.  He was a substitute for other characters in the books, probably because he was better known to most of the audience.  But even so, this Nero had nothing whatsoever to do with the real Nero of history, and one of the more interesting things about farmer's books was his knowledge of the historical characters he portrayed.The film is a mixed bag.  It is enjoyable and fun on one level, but unsatisfactory on another.  Best advice is to enjoy the film first, then read the books.",3,Obviously a series pilot,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2281,"['will', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'inspire', 'read', 'original', 'five', 'books', 'tendancy', 'lengthy', 'pontifications', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'read', 'full', 'surprises', 'as', 'well', 'unavoidable', 'cliches.As', 'sci-fi', 'channel', 'mini-series', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'studio', 'had', 'chosen', 'follow', 'novels', 'original', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'used', 'elements', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'remained', 'intact', 'original', 'were', 'Alice', 'Sam', 'Lev', 'Gwenafra', 'alien', 'Monat', 'more', 'less', 'combined', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'lovable', 'hulk', 'who', 'Sam', 'loyally', 'most', 'series.However', 'being', '90-minute', 'TV', 'production', 'have', 'been', 'clearly', 'intended', 'series', 'pilot', 'continuous', 'series', 'adventures', 'cast', 'new', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'workable', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'existing', 'story', 'line', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'Riverworld', 'everyone', 'do', 'mean', 'everyone', 'there', 'characters', 'can', 'exist.This', 'film', 'seemed', 'try', 'having', 'ways', 'new', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'different', 'story', 'set', 'same', 'premise', 'Sam', 'Clemens', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'likable', 'book', 'counterpart', 'was', 'alien', 'Monat', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'personlly', 'found', 'very', 'bothersome', 'First', 'all', 'instead', 'human', 'race', 'being', 'resurrected', 'simultaneously', 'citizens', 'Riverworld', 'seem', 'be', 'arriving', 'waves', 'few', 'years', 'were', 'also', 'horses', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Riverworld', 'grail', 'canisters', 'were', 'disappointment', 'books', 'provided', 'not', 'only', 'clothing', 'fine', 'full', 'meals', 'instead', 'icky', 'green-and-yellow', 'strips', 'what', 'looked', 'like', 'epoxy', 'ribbons', 'most', 'annoying', 'part', 'was', 'arrival', 'Emperor', 'Nero', 'was', 'substitute', 'other', 'characters', 'books', 'probably', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'most', 'audience', 'even', 'so', 'Nero', 'had', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'real', 'Nero', 'history', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'things', 'farmer', 'books', 'was', 'knowledge', 'historical', 'characters', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'one', 'level', 'unsatisfactory', 'Best', 'advice', 'enjoy', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'read', 'books']",Riverworld

Everyone who ever lived is reborn on this new world with all the memories of their previous life, but with a 25 year old body. They are given clothing and food from mysterious canisters.Nero, the infamous evil emperor of Rome, leads the bad guys as they attempt to take control. Mark Twain leads a group of rebels who construct a River Boat, and want to sail up the river to find out what is the source of this strange river and what is the meaning of this planet.A little internet research shows that this ""movie"" was actually supposed to be a television pilot for a Science Fiction channel TV series based on Riverworld which for one reason or another never got green lighted. That explains the low production values, and the fact that most of the questions (like, what is this strange planet and why is everyone there) remain unanswered at the end of the film.Despite the low production values, and a lot of technical goofs in this film (day suddenly turning to night, etc), I've got to say that I thought it was a lot more interesting than many of the big budget Hollywood block busters I've seen in my time. Despite the ridiculous plot, it is kind of fun to imagine what would happen if all of history's people all of a sudden woke up on the same river at the same time. Maybe its shame this never got made into its own series, but I'll have to pick up the books someday.For the amateur history buff, there is plenty to nit-pick. Aside from the fact that they were both evil, the Nero in this film could not be more different from his historical inspiration. The Nero in this film is super-macho, fearless, an excellent fighter, is admired by his men, and has dreams of conquest and empire. The historical Nero was a fat mamma's boy who had to rig athletic contests so he could win, who abandoned the running of the empire so he could focus on the arts, and who was a weakling who barely had the strength to perform his own suicide. To the film's credits, it does address some of these incongruities near the end when one of the characters confronts Nero about the historical record, but I thought it was too little too late.Other minor stuff as well. At one point a former holocaust victim tries to tell an African slave ship victim that he too was enslaved by white men. She has trouble believing that white people would be so wicked as to enslave their own race, but Africans themselves enslaved other Africans during era of slavery. Also the image of Mark Twain in this movie certainly isn't the image I get of him from reading his books, but I guess some of this is open to interpretation.Also, given that everyone wakes up on this strange planet naked as the day they were born, I have a hard time believing that they could construct all the weapons and buildings they have. The explanation given is that some people have been on River World for as long as 10 years, but I doubt even 10 years would be long enough to mine all the metal and construct all the swords and armor that Nero and the bad guys use, much less the elaborate post-industrial revolution steamboat that Mark Twain and his friends build.But if you don't question the small stuff too much, it can be an interesting 2 hours.",3,Good light hearted fun if you can overlook the flaws,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,3400,"[""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'books', 'someone', 'will', 'have', 'help', 'how', 'faithful', 'books', 'movie', 'astronaut', 'space', 'shuttle', 'crash', 'up', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'Everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'reborn', 'new', 'world', 'memories', 'previous', 'life', '25', 'year', 'old', 'body', 'are', 'given', 'clothing', 'food', 'mysterious', 'canisters.Nero', 'infamous', 'evil', 'emperor', 'Rome', 'bad', 'guys', 'attempt', 'take', 'control', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'group', 'rebels', 'who', 'construct', 'River', 'Boat', 'want', 'sail', 'up', 'river', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'source', 'strange', 'river', 'what', 'meaning', 'planet.A', 'little', 'internet', 'research', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'supposed', 'be', 'television', 'pilot', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'channel', 'TV', 'series', 'based', 'Riverworld', 'one', 'reason', 'never', 'got', 'green', 'lighted', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'fact', 'most', 'questions', 'what', 'strange', 'planet', 'why', 'everyone', 'there', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'end', 'film.Despite', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'lot', 'technical', 'goofs', 'film', 'day', 'suddenly', 'turning', 'night', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'block', 'busters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'kind', 'fun', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'history', 'people', 'sudden', 'woke', 'up', 'same', 'river', 'same', 'time', 'shame', 'never', 'got', 'made', 'own', 'series', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'books', 'someday.For', 'amateur', 'history', 'buff', 'plenty', 'nit-pick', 'Aside', 'fact', 'were', 'evil', 'Nero', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'historical', 'inspiration', 'Nero', 'film', 'super-macho', 'fearless', 'excellent', 'fighter', 'admired', 'men', 'dreams', 'conquest', 'empire', 'historical', 'Nero', 'was', 'fat', 'mamma', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'rig', 'athletic', 'contests', 'could', 'win', 'who', 'abandoned', 'running', 'empire', 'could', 'focus', 'arts', 'who', 'was', 'weakling', 'who', 'barely', 'had', 'strength', 'perform', 'own', 'suicide', 'film', 'credits', 'address', 'incongruities', 'end', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'confronts', 'Nero', 'historical', 'record', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Other', 'minor', 'stuff', 'well', 'one', 'point', 'former', 'holocaust', 'victim', 'tries', 'tell', 'African', 'slave', 'ship', 'victim', 'too', 'was', 'enslaved', 'white', 'men', 'trouble', 'believing', 'white', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'wicked', 'enslave', 'own', 'race', 'Africans', 'enslaved', 'other', 'Africans', 'era', 'slavery', 'Also', 'image', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'image', 'get', 'reading', 'books', 'guess', 'open', 'interpretation.Also', 'given', 'everyone', 'up', 'strange', 'planet', 'naked', 'day', 'were', 'born', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'could', 'construct', 'weapons', 'buildings', 'have', 'explanation', 'given', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'River', 'World', 'as', 'long', '10', 'years', 'doubt', 'even', '10', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'enough', 'mine', 'metal', 'construct', 'swords', 'armor', 'Nero', 'bad', 'guys', 'use', 'much', 'less', 'elaborate', 'post-industrial', 'revolution', 'steamboat', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'friends', 'build.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'small', 'stuff', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'interesting', '2', 'hours']",Riverworld

The result is most often a jumble that proves a disappointment to the readers who come to the movie with high expectations.  In RIVERWORLD, author Phillip Jose Farmer postulates a colossal world populated exclusively by those who have died on earth from any era only to be reincarnated somewhere on Riverworld.  The premise is both astounding and metaphysical.  Farmer's novels explore the reality and the morality of life reborn in a land that promises to be neither heaven nor hell.  However, director Kari Skolgard gives us a film and fills it with a standard hero villain format to such an extant that Skolgard might just as easily placed his cast in a Lost Continent environment.  There are only scattered attempts to infuse a pallid script with the real trauma of beings facing rebirth in a land that looks suspiciously like the banks of the Mississippi River.Brad Johnson is Hale, an American astronaut who dies while on a space mission.  The film opens with him in a sort of underwater bubble from which he bursts out to swim to shore.  There he meets Alice Hargreaves (Emily LLoyd) who in her ""real"" life was a favorite of explorer Richard Burton.  Other interesting characters appear: a Jewish survivor from Birkenau, a beautiful slave girl, and the historical Nero.  The plot quickly devolves into a standard Mad Max actioner in which the villain (Nero) attempts to recreate on Riverworld a semblance of the empire he ruled on earth.  Along the way, he attempts to seduce the reticent Alice although one would think that he would be more attracted to the Warrior-Princess like slave girl who spends more than a few minutes dancing a slave girl bugaloo to the delight of all.  It is almost a quibble to point out that it would have been impossible for the reincarnated humans to have constructed even a semblance of a post-industrial level of technology that results in a steam driven paddle boat.  It is simply a matter of not having the tools to build the tools to build the tools.  Further, the film hints at a hooded race of beings who appear at convenient moments to suggest that Riverworld has a plan that may be carried out in further sequels.  It would have taken more spirit and vision for director Skolgard to have abandoned the action format and instead consider the spiritual and psychological ramifications of a transition from death on Earth to rebirth on Riverworld.

The premise is the same, the dead from all periods of history find themselves resurrected in RiverWorld. Gang fighting, Lord-of-the-Flies-type stuff ensues. My main attraction to the books was the protagonist, the dashing explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. (Found the source of the Nile, first westerner into Muslim kingdoms, translated the Arabian Nights and the Kama Sutra, etc. He was the real-life version of the Victorian hero all those romance novelists try to recreate.) This movie has Brad Johnson playing an astronaut as the main character. Mark Twain is kept as a character, building Mississippi paddle wheelers to navigate the mighty river, but sadly John Lackland (Former King of England, Richard the LionHeart's brother - you know, the evil King John from the Robin Hood tales) has been changed to Nero, probably because the average TV viewer would say ""John who?"".

This is one of those exceptions.Riverworld is a world which has one long river cutting across the planet that everyone goes to when they die. They all wake up around the same age speaking the same language and there are these alien structures which dispense food. People who woke up earlier have established primitive kingdoms.The original Riverworld series was a 5-book series which while an interesting concept was heavily-padded and ultimately went nowhere with some boring bland characters including the author!This unsuccessful pilot did a much better job at re-creating that world with a different set of characters. In the original Richard Burton (the explorer not the actor) is the main character and the main enemy in four of the books is King John who was just a miserable sod.In this version the protagonist is an astronaut of the earlier 21st century and the main villain is Nero. With the astronaut we are able to get a hero with some understanding of technology and the concept of aliens unlike the 19th century Burton. With Nero we have a complex twisted villain who sees himself as a hero and having been an emperor he would have commanded the loyalty of thousands to hundreds of thousands in his time unlike a medieval king who fought his own barons much of the time. Nero could call upon many of the inhabitants in this new world so he makes a more believable threat.It's a shame that the series was never followed through with because I would have liked to have seen what they would have done with their version of Riverworld.It was actually this movie which got me interested in the novels but the novels I soon found to be terrible with characters that are picked up and dropped and an ending that was so anti-climatic which really never answered anything.I recommend this film for a lazy sunday but I don't recommend the book series.,3,Not a bad attempt at a terrible book series,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1908,"['Usually', 'people', 'say', 'book', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'exceptions.Riverworld', 'world', 'one', 'long', 'river', 'cutting', 'planet', 'everyone', 'when', 'die', 'wake', 'up', 'same', 'age', 'speaking', 'same', 'language', 'are', 'alien', 'structures', 'dispense', 'food', 'People', 'who', 'woke', 'up', 'earlier', 'have', 'established', 'primitive', 'kingdoms.The', 'original', 'Riverworld', 'series', 'was', '5-book', 'series', 'interesting', 'concept', 'was', 'heavily-padded', 'ultimately', 'went', 'nowhere', 'boring', 'bland', 'characters', 'including', 'author', 'unsuccessful', 'pilot', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 're-creating', 'world', 'different', 'set', 'characters', 'original', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'explorer', 'not', 'actor', 'main', 'character', 'main', 'enemy', 'four', 'books', 'King', 'John', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'miserable', 'sod.In', 'version', 'protagonist', 'astronaut', 'earlier', '21st', 'century', 'main', 'villain', 'Nero', 'astronaut', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'hero', 'understanding', 'technology', 'concept', 'aliens', '19th', 'century', 'Burton', 'Nero', 'have', 'complex', 'twisted', 'villain', 'who', 'hero', 'having', 'been', 'emperor', 'would', 'have', 'commanded', 'loyalty', 'thousands', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'time', 'medieval', 'king', 'who', 'fought', 'own', 'barons', 'much', 'time', 'Nero', 'could', 'call', 'many', 'inhabitants', 'new', 'world', 'more', 'believable', 'threat.It', 'shame', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'followed', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'version', 'Riverworld.It', 'was', 'actually', 'movie', 'got', 'interested', 'novels', 'novels', 'soon', 'found', 'be', 'terrible', 'characters', 'are', 'picked', 'dropped', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'anti-climatic', 'really', 'never', 'answered', 'anything.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'lazy', 'sunday', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'book', 'series']",Riverworld

The returnees are scattered the shores of a seemingly infinite river, with nowhere to go except up and down that river. People from every place and time are mixed together - Nero meets Mark Twain, that kind of thing. As in the original book, the combinations made little narrative sense and never engaged my imagination.Despite the historical majority of people from the many parts of Asia and Africa, they are oddly rare (in this part of the river, at least), and everyone speaks English. After all these failures to use potentially exciting material, what's left is an ordinary adventure. There are good guys and and bad guys, pretty women and cute kids, sword fights and Mysterious Objects, all paraded out in conventional ways.Parts of the timing and sequel-bait ending suggest that this was originally a TV mini-series. I imagine it worked pretty well in that context, and the Riverworld books would have given lots of material to carry on with. There have been lots of worse series, and lots of worse movies built from series pieces bolted together. There have been better, too.//wiredweird",3,Ordinary,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1529,"['read', 'parts', 'Riverworld', 'book', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'bothered', 'read', 'rest', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'that', 'much', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'same', 'watched', 'way', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'watch', 'sequel', 'not', 'most', 'stirring', 'stuff.The', 'premise', 'interesting', 'enough', 'humanity', 'way', 'back', 'dawn', 'human', 'evolution', 'been', 'reincarnated', 'agencies', 'unknown', 'returnees', 'are', 'scattered', 'shores', 'seemingly', 'infinite', 'river', 'nowhere', 'go', 'up', 'river', 'People', 'place', 'time', 'are', 'mixed', 'together', 'Nero', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'kind', 'thing', 'original', 'book', 'combinations', 'made', 'little', 'narrative', 'sense', 'never', 'engaged', 'imagination.Despite', 'historical', 'majority', 'people', 'many', 'parts', 'Asia', 'Africa', 'are', 'oddly', 'rare', 'part', 'river', 'least', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'English', 'failures', 'use', 'potentially', 'exciting', 'material', 'what', 'left', 'ordinary', 'adventure', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'pretty', 'women', 'cute', 'kids', 'sword', 'fights', 'Mysterious', 'Objects', 'paraded', 'out', 'conventional', 'ways.Parts', 'timing', 'sequel-bait', 'ending', 'suggest', 'was', 'originally', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'imagine', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'context', 'Riverworld', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'lots', 'material', 'carry', 'have', 'been', 'lots', 'worse', 'series', 'lots', 'worse', 'movies', 'built', 'series', 'pieces', 'bolted', 'together', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'too.//wiredweird']",Riverworld
