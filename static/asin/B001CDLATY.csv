1176131,A3F8QKW0MT515A,B001CDLATY,Alexis,"[7, 14]","A very disappointing sequel to Winds of war, for two main reasons: The script was written by two writers other than Herman Wouk, who 'co-wrote'; and the director was completely out of his depth, allowing the actors who played Hitler, Stalin, Eichmann, and several others to disintegrate into cartoon characters. The change of cast is also distracting for those who saw Winds. The film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a docudrama about WWII, the search for Nathalie and her son, or the soap opera between Rhoda and Pug. There are several more subplots as well, so the mind starts to wander rather quickly. There are far too many unnecessaery scenes of violence and graphic suffering. As a specialist in military history and uniforms, I was driven around the bend by the inaccuracies in American uniforms, insignia, and decorations. May be worth watching once to find out what happened after Winds, but all in all, a very expensive letdown.",2,War and remembrance not very memorable,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,953,"['very', 'disappointing', 'sequel', 'Winds', 'war', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'writers', 'other', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'who', ""'co-wrote"", 'director', 'was', 'completely', 'depth', 'allowing', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'Eichmann', 'several', 'others', 'disintegrate', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'change', 'cast', 'also', 'distracting', 'who', 'saw', 'Winds', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'be', 'docudrama', 'WWII', 'search', 'Nathalie', 'son', 'soap', 'opera', 'Rhoda', 'Pug', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'subplots', 'well', 'mind', 'wander', 'rather', 'quickly', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'unnecessaery', 'scenes', 'violence', 'graphic', 'suffering', 'specialist', 'military', 'history', 'uniforms', 'was', 'driven', 'bend', 'inaccuracies', 'American', 'uniforms', 'insignia', 'decorations', 'May', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Winds', 'very', 'expensive', 'letdown']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series
1176132,A24PTVSZSM8968,B001CDLATY,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is the continuation of The Winds of War. It was considered to be one of the last of the great network TV miniseries. While a few key characters had a change in actors between the first series and this one, many from the original series also returned. In some cases, the replacement actors are even better than the originals. This series picks up where the last one left off right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It continues to follow the different members of the Henry family. While a lot of things are covered, most of the episodes focus on few big themes. The relationship between the patriarch, Victor Henry and his wife is an on-going storyline that gets a lot of screen time. Also, the experiences of his daughter-in-law and her son and uncle in German captivity and eventually concentration camps get a lot of exposure. Finally, a couple of episodes focus heavily on a couple of naval engagements in the Pacific, especially the battle of Midway. If you have seen The Winds of War, you really need to see the conclusion. There may be newer World War II movies that have better effects and are more flashy but none can compare to this one in scope. With 20 some hours, you really get a feel for what the war was like, especially for those not necessarily on the battlefield.",5,Must see,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1286,"['continuation', 'Winds', 'War', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'network', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'few', 'key', 'characters', 'had', 'change', 'actors', 'first', 'series', 'one', 'many', 'original', 'series', 'also', 'returned', 'cases', 'replacement', 'actors', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'originals', 'series', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'right', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'follow', 'different', 'members', 'Henry', 'family', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'covered', 'most', 'episodes', 'focus', 'few', 'big', 'themes', 'relationship', 'patriarch', 'Victor', 'Henry', 'wife', 'on-going', 'storyline', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'Also', 'experiences', 'daughter-in-law', 'son', 'uncle', 'German', 'captivity', 'eventually', 'concentration', 'camps', 'get', 'lot', 'exposure', 'Finally', 'couple', 'episodes', 'focus', 'heavily', 'couple', 'naval', 'engagements', 'Pacific', 'especially', 'battle', 'Midway', 'have', 'seen', 'Winds', 'War', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'newer', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'have', 'better', 'effects', 'are', 'more', 'flashy', 'none', 'can', 'compare', 'one', 'scope', '20', 'hours', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'especially', 'not', 'necessarily', 'battlefield']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series

I bought this from Amazon, through an independent dealer, and it was half the cost of the Amazon one. The only negative with doing it that way was I had to pay postage (couldn't get Free shipping), and it took about 1 week extra to get to us - neither of which made much difference to us.

A great mixture of Truth , Facts and Actual films documenting the the start of World War #2 from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii through the Pacific to the invasion of Nazi Germany through Europe to the brutality of the Jewish population throughout all of Europe. You hear of the Holocaust , the systematic mass slaughter of European Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World war #2 but hearing and seeing are two different things . They show how they transported the families in box cars on trains to the various concentration camps , forced them to walk miles to the camp , took all their valuables then forced them to remove their clothes in one building then to all walk naked to another building to be deloused but it was the gas chamber . They then would have workers remove the bodies and dump them in a ditch and cover them with lime anddirt . They chose young ones for the labor work . Many of the scenes are actual movies taken by the Nazis of theseevents . The story line features &#34;  Robert Mitchum &#34; as a Navy Officer his wife &#34;  Polly Bergen &#34; and his family of two sons and two daughters stationed at Pearl Harbor . One son is a Navy Carrier pilot and the other is a Navy submarine officer who is married to a Jewish girl &#34; Jane Seymore &#34;and they have a small son.

1176153,A3N3CNQD0L3HX9,B001CDLATY,David A. Franklin,"[3, 5]","I just finished watching both Winds of War and then War and Remembrance back to back. I have a completely different opinion of both projects with the first mini series getting better reviews than the last one.Overall, the writing was odd. The words were like something out of a 1930 movie. The way the males in the series talked to the females. Very mechanical and so respectful and proper. The affairs of the main characters, Pug and his wife, were so sterile. Even when his wife confronted Pug's mistress (if you call her that) it was just too polite.Also, I think the first mini series was shot just as Robert Mitchum was reaching his apex as a leading man. Then a few years later, he was older and much stiffer. All of the shots of him had him walking in standing and walking out. That isn't to take away from his presence, which he had plenty of, but to underscore that his character was supposed to be a Navy Captain in his prime. Clearly he was too old for the part and it showed.I also didn't like all the character recasting that the second mini series did. When you watch these back to back, the characters don't make sense when you are dealing with a new face. I think originally, when the two series were separated over many years, the viewing audience was not a familiar with the old cast and more forgiving. Back to back viewings probably not so much.I also really got sick of the thick British sayings. ""Indeed, By-Jove, Cherri o, etc. I did a little research and most of those sayings are rare, but not extinct in England. I think it is representative of the writer's impression of the English and not so much the reality of their slang.The best performance in both series was Ralph Bellamy as FDR. He made FDR come to life and played the part with conviction. The others got too old and they just waited too long to shoot the sequel.It is worth the viewing. I love WWII history and this provided some historical perspectives but there was far too many literally manipulations to take most of it serious. It was entertaining but could bog down if you tried to watch it back to back to back.

I also had the opportunity to watch the Winds of War television miniseries when it first came out, but was not able to watch the follow-on two part miniseries due to work commitments at the time.  I recently watched the Winds of War miniseries again when it became available for viewing on a service that we subscribe too.  After re-watching that series I decided I wanted to see the follow-on miniseries and purchased this version since it was not yet available for viewing.  I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to watch this version should either watch and/or read Winds of War first.  Otherwise many parts of it will be confusing in regard to the previous character developments in the first book/series.  That being said, if you read the book version of War and Remembrance first, you may be somewhat disappointed as I was in what I felt was a lack of balance in regard to the concentration on what was the obvious main theme of the video presentation.  In my opinion, many of the characters/subjects covered in the book were not as well developed in the video presentation.  The reason why was explained in one of the bonus DVD&#8217;s and I understand why it was done, but I would still have preferred to have had additional time spent on the other characters that were more thoroughly covered in the book.

In Winds of War, I thought the war/military scenes were well done, but I disliked the soap opera scenes (which amounted to 33% to 50% of each episode).I thought I'd give War and Remembrance a chance, and I was expecting it to be similar in style to Winds of War.  Most of the main characters have changed in War and Remembrance, and that was disappointing (except for Ali MacGraw--I was glad to see her gone).  I couldn't adjust to some of the new faces; they just didn't fit as well as the original folks.After watching the first DVD, it seemed to me that 50% or more was soap opera scenes, so I did a lot of fast forwarding.

1176167,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B001CDLATY,James Horlan,"[109, 111]","To those who stumble upon War and Remembrance, watching this series is somewhat difficult if you haven't seen Winds of War, the first part of the story.  It too is available on DVD and I highly recommend getting it.  Otherwise there are just enough in-jokes and previous references that you'll get confused.  So if you go on, I'll assume that you've either seen or read Winds of War and will know what I'm talking about.War and Remembrance is essentially a history lesson that's told dramatically.  The lesson, of course, is about the second part of World War II, the part that the United States was most actively involved in.  That's the strength of the series, how well it deals with the history, and of showing the viewpoints of American, Russian, and German officers, and American, British, and German politicians.  You saw all the sides in this, and the lesson was much the better for it.  Were the points a bit obvious at times?  Of course, but when you spend the kind of money they did on the series, you want to reach the broadest possible audience.How does it compare with the book?  Quite well really, the mini-series was long enough that relatively little was left out or compressed.  There were little scenes here and there, but nothing major was on the cutting room floor.  Does it help to have read the book first?  That depends on if WWII history is your thing.  If it's not, then reading the book is a great primer, long though the book is.  But if you're contemplating a 25 hour mini-series, something tells me that length is not an issue for you.The casting is always the key to any mini-series or long-form series (like Lost), and here it's a mixed bag.  Dan Curtis, writer/director/producer/bossman cast Winds of War's characters almost uniformly too old for their parts, and while some of them are back for this one, some were either let go or chose not to come back.  Those who are back include Robert Mitchum as Pug Henry, Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry, Victoria Tennant as Pam Tudsbury, David Dukes as Leslie Slote, and Ralph Bellamy as Franklin Roosevelt.  Bellamy to me is FDR, I can't read about him in history books without picturing Ralph's face.  Likewise Polly Bergen was PERFECT as Rhoda, the then semi-retired actress just nailed it in every scene.  Dukes was a great Leslie, the actor was taken from us far too early.  And Mitchhum?  Way too old for the part even in Winds of War, and the five year break in between did him no favors either (something he pointedly brought up to Curtis in between, telling him to hurry up with the W&R; script).  His romance with the much younger Tennant was a bit off putting as well, solid though she was.  But Mitchum had a gravitas and depth that was badly needed for the role, and for that I can't bring myself to criticize him.  His acting was certainly top notch, as always.The newcomers?  Jane Seymour replaces Ali MacGraw as Natalie Jastrow Henry, and while the acting is better, it's the age that  really matters.  MacGraw was 15 years older than the part and it really showed, though the character is the most frustrating of the books/series, behaving stupidly at almost every turn.  Hart Bochner replaces Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron Henry, and the age is better, but Bochner isn't the Byron of the books, and is such a long way off that it's like they wrote the character to fit the actor, rather than hire an actor to fit a character.  Vincent was a mess by this point, but I would have liked to have seen his take on things.  John Gielgud replaces John Houseman (who was very sick when production began, and would soon pass away), and he fit Aaron Jastrow a little better for the Paradise Ghetto parts.  I just couldn't see Houseman more or less becoming a rabbi, talented an actor though he was.  Most of the minor parts were re-cast, including an amusing switch by where Barry Morse, who played the German banker Wolf Stoller in WoW, played German General Halder here.  All in all the acting was an improvement, for the most part.The extras?  Well they're not bad, considering.  They have a series of retrospective docs, with interviews with most of the surviving actors (Mitchum, Dukes, and Gielgud are among the actors who had passed on by this point), and a lot of Dan Curtis (who too has died since).  Curtis does not lack for confidence, as the interviews will show, and it's totally necessary when you're shepherding a pair of nine figure mini-series to the screen, when $100 million meant a lot more in a budget than it does now.  They cover as much as can be covered really, and take the place of an almost impossible to do commentary track, much as I would have liked to have listened to one.  The video and audio quality are about what you would expect from a 20 year old series, and since I doubt they'll go the Blu-Ray route with either series, this is the best we're going to get.The price?  Awesome, for how much you get.  I'd been waiting for the makers of the series to get reasonable with their pricing (they topped out at over $140 at one point), and now it's a great deal, especially for how long the mini-series is.The myth is that W&R; killed off the long form mini-series, as the ratings were only so-so for how much money was spent.  Instead, I think that the genre has transferred to regular serielized TV dramas like Lost and Heroes.  One long story, told over many hours, with a large cast.  Not much difference really, if you think about it.Four stars.",5,An Epic,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,5461,"['who', 'stumble', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'watching', 'series', 'somewhat', 'difficult',

1176169,A17JVI15BRY90P,B001CDLATY,James T. Wheeler,"[50, 51]","After 18 hours of ""Winds of War (WW),"" it's hard to be brief about the 30-hour sequel, ""War and Remembrance (W & R)."" Both works were written by Herman Wouk and directed by Dan Curtis.  Other reviewers have been so critical of the sequel, mainly with cast changes, that you find yourself  dwelling on faults.  But the fact is WW was finished in 1983; W & R was produced 5 years later.  So the two works couldn't really use the same cast.To begin with, criticism of ""W & R"" seems out of proportion.  No, ""W & R"" is  not better than ""WW."" But we wonder what else people could have expected. Nazi brutality and glimpses of the holocaust may have been overdone, but that's how the author and the director wanted them.  Moreover, we believe fault-finding about some performers, notably Jane Seymour and Robert Mitchum is just not fair.  In our view, Jane does a marvelous job playing Natalie Jastrow Henry--probably better than Alie MacGraw had she reprised the role. (By the time of this production Alie would have been pushing 50 and 20 years too old for the part. Besides, Alie's just too feisty a person to put up with all Natalie had to endure in ""W & R."")  Regarding Mitchum, yes, he's five years older in this production but we didn't see him ""doddering"" as some reviewers say.  No, Mitchum was fine.As to other cast changes in ""WW,"" we generally have positive views.  We see Sir John Gielgud as an improvement playing Natalie's uncle, Aaron Jastrow.  Similarly, Robert Hardy was better as Winston Churchill, despite a limited role. Hart Bochner was fine as Byron Henry, replacing Jan-Michael Vincent.  And Sharon Stone seemed properly vampish as Janice Henry, Warren Henry's widow.  We don't see the actor playing Hitler as a downgrade over the one who played him in ""WW.""  On the contrary, we found him better, as he didn't have a lisp when he spoke and otherwise played the raving maniac Dan Curtis wanted.  Actors playing Germans all did well in our view, especially Jeremy Kemp as the fictitious General von Roon.  Granted, casting Barry Morse was odd as German Field Marshall von Halder, after Morse had played a Nazi banker in ""WW.""  But Morse did well in the part, especially when he tells Hitler, ""You lost the war when you declared war on America. "" For this attack of conscience, Halder gets fired.Finally, on the cast, Sky Dumont, who played Count Ciano in ""WW,"" returns to ""W & R.""  But this time he plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg.  We thought Dumont was fine as Stauffenberg both in bearing and performance.  What a tragedy his real-life person didn't do as well in assassinating Hitler. 10 million lives may have been spared if Hitler had died on July 20, 1944, when Stauffenberg tried to blow him up.Action sequences involving the Battle of Midway, submarine engagements, and the naval battle at Leyte Gulf are all done well in W & R.  Missing, however, are the final surrender of the Japanese in the Pacific and in-depth drama on Stalingrad and Kursk where the Russians dealt the Germans staggering defeats.  D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge are OK, but not as profound in the movie as they really were.  Scenes of these momentous events were all overshadowed, though, by the long ordeals of Natalie and Aaron Jastrow and their fellow Jews.  They are tortured by the Nazis from place to place and finally end up at Auschwitz.  Truly, the mass murders, gassing, and incineration of innocent people has to be one of the most horrifying depictions ever put on film.Other negatives about the production include subtitles having wrong names and information.  Example: von Roon being called, Roehm.  Also, the way some of the characters were either killed off prematurely or were never retrieved after being developed earlier.  Most outstanding of these may have been the character of Warren Henry being killed at the Battle of Midway after his heroic attack; Berel Jastrow being shot by the Nazis after his harrowing escape; and Leslie Slote being killed as a paratrooper after being trained all his life as a diplomat.  Also, as said above, too much time is devoted to the endless savagery of the Nazis.  Nevertheless, it brought to mind the quote from Hans Frank, one of the Nazis hanged at Nuremberg: ""A thousand years will pass and the guilt of the German people will still not be wiped out.""To sum up, we found ""W & R "" a thoroughly engaging series, well worth our time and money.  Special features, moreover, add to the storyline. We give the movie four (4) stars, as contrasted to five (5) for ""Winds of War,"" mainly because of the negatives cited above. ""WW"" was a hard act to follow, but ""W & R"" did about as well as could be expected.  At times the show is hard to watch, but it makes impressions you'll never forget.",4,"Good Sequel, not Great",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,4745,"['18', 'hours', 'Winds', 'War', 'WW', 'hard', 'be',

The series is aided by a brilliant, unforgettable score by Bob Cobert, especially the main theme which seems to encapsulate every single emotion of the thirty hours into its two minutes.Robert Mitchum turns in a fabulous performance as Victor 'Pug' Henry the no nonsense patriarch of the family. Polly Bergen plays his flibbertigibbet wife Rhoda to perfection.The heart, though, is the central plot of Jane Seymour, in a heartbreaking career-best performance as an American Jew trapped in Europe, and John Gielgud, mesmerizing as her uncle. Of course, having John Gielgud in the cast didn't hurt! He was absolutely marvelous. I can only say that the entire story concerning Gielgud and his family was remarkable.As they are slowly, inexorably pulled into the Holocaust we follow them, step by agonizing step, to the final horrors of Auschwitz, filmed entirely on location.The viewer is also given a glimpse into the thinking of the Nazi leadership, with Steven Berkoff providing a chilling and brilliant portrayal of Adolf Hitler.""War and Remembrance"" is as close to time travel as possible, and makes that dark period of history come powerfully alive.Won Emmy Award's for Outstanding Achievement in Special Visual Effects, Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or a Special - Single Camera Production and Outstanding Miniseries Dan Curtis (executive producer),Nominated for Emmy Award's for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Special Polly Bergen, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special Jane Seymour, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special John Gielgud and Outstanding Directing in a Miniseries or a Special Dan Curtis (director)BIOS:1.

Great story, although the pacing needed to be worked on a bit as some episodes are all romantic soap opera and the next episode will be full of action and war drama.I gave the Remembrance a four star rating mostly for content.  The video quality is questionable and the audio is a mixed bag.  On a big screen TV like I have the video is fuzzy and the colors very muted.  Looks like it was taken from a VHS master and not redone for DVD.  The audio is the most interesting thing to me.  The first set is in stereo and I can run it through my surround processor and the voices are in the middle track and the music and audio effects are in the two front channels.  On the second set of discs, called the Final Chapter, if I run it through the surround processor, everything comes out of the center speaker.

1176178,A1DD4LJSNJ0V9W,B001CDLATY,"Julia Stapp ""JS""","[2, 2]","I have lost track of the times I have replayed this fabulous series.  It is one of the best ways I can think of to really understand the events leading up to, and during, World War II.  I would give the first part, ""The Winds of War"" an unabashed 5 stars, but I dropped this one down to four stars probably because of things the production staff couldn't help.The re-casting of several key roles hurt the production.  I can only assume that the actors who portrayed the characters in the first part were no longer available.Hitler, in the first part, was far scarier and more realistic, because of the understated aura of perverted evil he projected.  It was far more effective than the raving maniac of ""War and Remembrance.""Ali McGraw was Natalie Jastrow come to life, precisely as portrayed by the author.  Feisty, stubborn, and wildly sexy, she brought Wouk's character vividly to the screen.  Her replacement, Jane Seymour, played Natalie as a victimized rag of a woman, swept along by events rather than throwing herself against them.  The spirit portrayed both in the novel and the first part of the mini-series was completely absent, and in my opinion seriously took away from the total impact.The same must be said of Jan Michael Vincent's replacement, Hart Bochner.  He reminded me of the guy who played Tony in ""West Side Story.""  He was there, walking through the part, without projecting anything but a body filling the camera.  That just didn't fit with the portrayal of the lazy, charming, Byron Henry, whose about-faces in times of crisis were so effective.  This guy didn't seem like he would do an about-face to confront so much as a mosquito.The substitution of John Geilgud to play Aaron Jastrow was brilliant, and one of the highlights of the second part of the mini-series.  Ralph Bellamy epitomized FDR, and the other continuing characters were excellent.  Sadly underrated as actors are the men who portrayed Rommel and Spruance...both were perfect for their roles.Other than that...highly recommended.",4,Well done!,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2026,"['have', 'lost', 'track', 'times', 'have', 'replayed', 'fabulous', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'ways', 'can', 'think', 'really', 'understand', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'would', 'give', 'first', 'part', 'Winds', 'War', 'unabashed', '5', 'stars', 'dropped', 'one', 'down', 'four', 'stars', 'probably', 'things', 'production', 'staff', 'could', ""n't"", 'help.The', 're-casting', 'several', 'key', 'roles', 'hurt', 'production', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'first', 'part', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'available.Hitler', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'far', 'scarier', 'more', 'realistic', 'understated', 'aura', 'perverted', 'evil', 'projected', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'raving', 'maniac', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'was', 'Natalie', 'Jastrow', 'come', 'life', 'precisely', 'portrayed', 'author', 'Feisty', 'stubborn', 'wildly', 'sexy', 'brought', 'Wouk', 'character', 'vividly', 'screen', 'replacement', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'played', 'Natalie', 'victimized', 'rag', 'woman', 'swept', 'events', 'rather', 'throwing', 'spirit', 'portrayed', 'novel', 'first', 'part', 'mini-series', 'was', 'completely', 'absent', 'opinion', 'seriously', 'took', 'away', 'total', 'impact.The', 'same', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'replacement', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'reminded', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Tony', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'was', 'there', 'walking', 'part', 'projecting', 'anything', 'body', 'filling', 'camera', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'portrayal', 'lazy', 'charming', 'Byron', 'Henry', 'about-faces', 'times', 'crisis', 'were', 'so', 'effective', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'would', 'do', 'about-face', 'confront', 'so', 'much', 'mosquito.The', 'substitution', 'John', 'Geilgud', 'play', 'Aaron', 'Jastrow', 'was', 'brilliant', 'one', 'highlights', 'second', 'part', 'mini-series', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'epitomized', 'FDR', 'other', 'continuing', 'characters', 'were', 'excellent', 'Sadly', 'underrated', 'actors', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Rommel', 'Spruance', 'were', 'perfect', 'roles.Other', 'highly', 'recommended']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series

(Though I highly recommend reading both books - they are outstanding.)  I guess I was the rare reviewer who was not bothered by the casting changes in W&R.  Yep, Mitchum was too old to play Victor Henry and the actor knew that very well, but his portrayal of VH and the gravitas he brought to the role made that a minor consideration.  Once you get used to watching him smooch with Victoria Tennant, it all sort of works out.  As a naval captain, he is superb.  I loved both Jane Seymour and Hart Bochner as Natalie and Byron.  I never quite bought into Ali McGraw's overacting and Jan Michael Vincent wasn't as convincing a submariner as Bochner was.  The other changes proved to be seamless for me making me quite forget John Houseman and the guy who played Churchill.  As to Hitler, the actor in W&R was a more credible likeness than the WW actor.  Complaints about the extended scenes of Nazi cruelty in the camps - that's what happened!  No film portrayal can properly convey the horror of those times and if this film helps spoiled Americans to &#34;never forget&#34;, then they did a good job.  &#34;The Winds of War&#34; and &#34;War and Remembrance&#34; stand tall as two of the greatest mini-series ever done by Hollywood.

1176189,ADY2T3QG6YSHF,B001CDLATY,Michael A. Weyer,"[2, 2]","Given how ""The Winds of War"" had been an excellent mini-series chronciling the lead-up to Pearl Harbor, one would think the follow-up would be better with the war itself. Instead, it suffers from overly padded dialouge and plotting and an overreliance on stock footage and narration to explain the big parts of the war. There's also the fact that about 90% of the cast has been changed which naturally shakes things up.The worst of the casting is Hitler as here we get an over the top performance rather than the more restrained actor of ""WOW."" I know that this is supposed to show how Hitler lost control as the tide turned but it still comes off too camp to be effective. Spending so much time on the plots to kill him also comes off hard as it takes away from the other storylines.However, casting Jane Seymour as Natalie works as she's a more sympathetic figure now and John Geilgulld is excellent as Jastrow musing over his fate. Mitchum may be a bit older now but he and Polly Bergen still mix wonderfully as does Victoria Tennett to give their story heart. It also helps having David Dukes back as Leslie Stole who redeems himself from the first story by discovering Germany's plans for the Jews. Those who wonder why the Allies could not find this out earlier are answered by the statement that no one wants to believe a civilized nation could carry out such a horror.Indeed, it's stunning how the Holocaust is depicted, with nudity of people that wouldn't get on TV today so it being shown on 1988 networks is amazing. The horrors are done from the gassing to mass graves and the horrible shot of a little girl lying amid a pile of bodies. Even worse are the Nazis treating it like a joke and going about things normally while committing mass murder.Like ""WOW,"" Herman Wouk co-wrote the screenplay so it's quite close to the novel and improves by showing stuff that was only mentioned in letters or notes. The big change is that the Battle of Leyte, a major event in the novel spanning several chapters, is brushed off here with stock footage. That amazed me as in the novel Pug reacts to the bad decisions his commanders make and would have made compelling drama but I guess they couldn't afford it.So while it doesn't match the scope or impact of ""WOW,"" this is still amazing for the scale of production and giving a human face to one of the greatest tragedies in our history.",4,A great epic but not quite as good as its predecessor,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2387,"['Given', 'how', 'Winds', 'War', 'had', 'been', 'excellent', 'mini-series', 'chronciling', 'lead-up', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'follow-up', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'war', 'Instead', 'overly', 'padded', 'dialouge', 'plotting', 'overreliance', 'stock', 'footage', 'narration', 'explain', 'big', 'parts', 'war', 'also', 'fact', 'about', '90', '%', 'cast', 'been', 'changed', 'naturally', 'things', 'up.The', 'worst', 'casting', 'Hitler', 'here', 'get', 'top', 'performance', 'rather', 'more', 'restrained', 'actor', 'WOW', 'know', 'supposed', 'show', 'how', 'Hitler', 'lost', 'control', 'tide', 'turned', 'still', 'off', 'too', 'camp', 'be', 'effective', 'Spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'plots', 'kill', 'also', 'off', 'hard', 'away', 'other', 'storylines.However', 'casting', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Natalie', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'now', 'John', 'Geilgulld', 'excellent', 'Jastrow', 'musing', 'fate', 'Mitchum', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'older', 'now', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'Victoria', 'Tennett', 'give', 'story', 'heart', 'also', 'having', 'David', 'Dukes', 'back', 'Leslie', 'Stole', 'who', 'first', 'story', 'discovering', 'Germany', 'plans', 'Jews', 'who', 'wonder', 'why', 'Allies', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'earlier', 'are', 'answered', 'statement', 'one', 'believe', 'civilized', 'nation', 'could', 'carry', 'out', 'such', 'horror.Indeed', 'stunning', 'how', 'Holocaust', 'depicted', 'nudity', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'TV', 'today', 'being', 'shown', '1988', 'networks', 'amazing', 'horrors', 'are', 'done', 'gassing', 'mass', 'graves', 'horrible', 'shot', 'little', 'girl', 'lying', 'pile', 'bodies', 'Even', 'worse', 'are', 'Nazis', 'treating', 'joke', 'going', 'things', 'normally', 'committing', 'mass', 'WOW', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'close', 'novel', 'improves', 'showing', 'stuff', 'was', 'only', 'mentioned', 'letters', 'notes', 'big', 'change', 'Battle', 'Leyte', 'major', 'event', 'novel', 'spanning', 'several', 'chapters', 'brushed', 'here', 'stock', 'footage', 'amazed', 'novel', 'Pug', 'bad', 'decisions', 'commanders', 'make', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'compelling', 'drama', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'it.So', ""n't"", 'match', 'scope', 'impact', 'WOW', 'still', 'amazing', 'scale', 'production', 'giving', 'human', 'face', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'history']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series

1176204,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B001CDLATY,Rick L. Parrish,"[3, 3]",I'm porting over my review of Winds Of War because it says it all.  There are cast changes in this sequel that irk some but don't detract from the completion of the story in the least (in fact I found they improved it a lot).  Just wanted to be fair and warn you of that fact.  And Winds of War is around 14 hours...this behemoth sequel is 26 hours or so.Superb story telling like you will never see again.  Dan Curtis (that's right...the Dark Shadows guy) put together the biggest mini-series of all time (topped only by it's sequel in length and span) and it was a ratings smash.  A week long mini-series experience like no other.  Headed up by Robert Mitchum in a role he was born to play and populated with some of the most distinquished film and television actors of the time (along with the requisite male and female ingenues of the day) it is a vast and sprawling story of the events leading up to World War II kept intimate and watchable by the focus on a single family that was the genius of Herman Wouk's internationally best selling novel.  This is history told with a timeline that is astonishingly accurate and clear and made palatable by it's dramatic story woven in among the historical events themselves.  It was a genius of a book and Dan Curtis saw to it that it got transferred to the screen mostly intact.  He was a much better producer storyteller than anyone has ever given him credit and this mini series and it's sequel five years later 'War and Remembrance' are his testament.  The sheer scope of the two (40 hours) is mind boggling but necessary to bring Mr. Wouk's work to fruition for a movie oriented audience.  I cannot recommend this highly enough if you want to learn the clockwork inner workings of the events that preceded and drove World War II to it's conclusion and be entertained first class all the way.  All I urge is that you buy both this and 'War and Remembrance' together and ignore the critics inevitable nitpicking of the latter and enjoy yourself immensely.,5,Magnificent Achievement!!,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2004,"[""'m"", 'porting', 'review', 'Winds', 'War', 'are', 'cast', 'changes', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'completion', 'story', 'least', 'fact', 'found', 'improved', 'lot', 'Just', 'wanted', 'be', 'fair', 'warn', 'fact', 'Winds', 'War', 'around', '14', 'hours', 'sequel', '26', 'hours', 'so.Superb', 'story', 'telling', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'right', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'guy', 'put', 'together', 'biggest', 'mini-series', 'time', 'topped', 'only', 'sequel', 'length', 'span', 'was', 'ratings', 'smash', 'week', 'long', 'mini-series', 'experience', 'other', 'Headed', 'up', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'populated', 'most', 'distinquished', 'film', 'television', 'actors', 'time', 'requisite', 'male', 'female', 'ingenues', 'day', 'vast', 'sprawling', 'story', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'kept', 'intimate', 'watchable', 'focus', 'single', 'family', 'was', 'genius', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'internationally', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'history', 'told', 'timeline', 'astonishingly', 'accurate', 'clear', 'made', 'palatable', 'dramatic', 'story', 'woven', 'historical', 'events', 'was', 'genius', 'book', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'saw', 'got', 'transferred', 'screen', 'mostly', 'intact', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'producer', 'storyteller', 'anyone', 'ever', 'given', 'credit', 'mini', 'series', 'sequel', 'five', 'years', 'later', ""'War"", 'Remembrance', 'are', 'testament', 'sheer', 'scope', 'two', '40', 'hours', 'mind', 'boggling', 'necessary', 'bring', 'Mr.', 'Wouk', 'work', 'fruition', 'movie', 'oriented', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'want', 'learn', 'clockwork', 'inner', 'workings', 'events', 'preceded', 'drove', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'conclusion', 'be', 'entertained', 'first', 'class', 'way', 'urge', 'buy', ""'War"", 'Remembrance', 'together', 'ignore', 'critics', 'inevitable', 'nitpicking', 'latter', 'enjoy', 'immensely']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series

I had forgotten that it wasn't the whole story until that scene in Theresienstadt when Natalie is separated from her toddler son Louis for what is allegedly health reasons, but is actually the boy being taken out of the camp by agents of a Czech partisan group. The next thing I know, I'm seeing the graphic ""to be continued"" on the screen. I had forgotten the fact that when this was first aired, parts 8 through 12 were held back until the following spring. That began a frantic search on my part for the VHS of the ""Final Chapter"" section. When this was crossed over to DVD, that separation survived.As it is, there's a new Byron (not that Jan Michael Vincent was that awesome), a new Natalie (ditto for Ali McGraw), a new Warren, a new Aaron Jastrow (to me, the late John Houseman was a bit too ""veddy British"" for a Jewish American college professor). But Robert Mitchum was still there, in a role as meant for him as Brando's Godfather. Polly Bergen is still there, although she didn't play Rhoda as ditsy as Wouk wrote her. And Victoria Tenant is the sweet charming English girl who charms American audiences in the same tradition as Julie Andrews or Hayley Mills. You can imagine a dour middle aged naval officer like Pug who you'd never imagine fallling for a girl as young as his kids doing so anyway with her.There's one part that calls for ""parental advisory"" between the Theresienstadt commandant and Natalie in which little Louis is also threatened, plus a grueling scene later on at Auschwitz involving Aaron. Still I hope they keep moving this film on to whatever new format they come up with. This story has been part of my library since it existed only in book form.

It has been years and I was happy to discover that the entire War and Remembrance was available in a complete DVD boxed set at an affordable price.  This latest boxed set comes attractively packaged and comprises:Parts I- VII (6 discs - 13  hours, Rating: NR) with bonus materials including a documentary, ""The Making of War and Remembrance"" featuring interviews with the actors, Herman Wouk (the author upon whose work this mini-series was based), and production personnel including director Dan Curtis, the featurette ""War and Remembrance - A Living History"" hosted by Robert Mitchum. There is an insert with summaries of Parts I-VII, an introductory message from Herman Wouk, and a message from director Dan Curtis.Parts VIII-XII (5 discs ) with bonus materials including ""War and Remembrance - Behind the Scenes"" (a documentary focusing on the Holocaust segments and including new interviews with Jane Seymour, Hart Bochner, and Victoria Tennant), director Dan Curtis' commentary of key scenes, TV promos, and a CD of the original television soundtrack music composed and conducted by Bob Cobert- the soundtrack was the longest motion picture score of all time. The insert here includes a message from Jane Seymour, Hart Bochner, episode summaries, and a production overview.For those new to this series, I would advise watching the prequel ""Winds of War"" which is also available on DVD.  ""War and Remembrance"" begins about a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and once again viewers get to see the various members of the Henry family. Victor ""Pug"" Henry (Robert Mitchum) assumes command of the U.S.S. Northampton, whilst his eldest son Warren (Michael Woods) is a fighter pilot on board the U.S.S. Enterprise. Byron (Hart Bochner), Pug's other son is a torpedo officer on a submarine. Byron misses his Jewish-American wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour) who together with their infant son and famous uncle Dr. Aaron Jastrow (Sir John Gielgud) are trying to evade the deadly Nazi web, though events will soon enough conspire against them.  Meanwhile, Berel (Chaim Topol), Aaron's cousin is a Soviet POW who ends up in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In Parts VIII-XII, we see the conclusion of this epic mini-series as the lives of the Henrys and the Jastrows play out against the backdrop of the war. The implementation of the Final Solution sees the destruction of European Jewry made all the more harrowing through the credible portrayal of Natalie, her young son and uncle Aaron and their collective suffering. The depiction of the Final Solution - mass shootings, gassings, etc is one of the most realistic and horrifying depictions of the Holocaust ever portrayed on screen (the other shows that come close are Holocaust, Amen, and Schindler's List, amongst others). The depictions of Nazi brutality are quite gruesome and I would advise caution against showing this to children under 12. Viewers get to see the leaders of both sides (the Allies and the Axis powers) - FDR, Churchill, Hitler, etc. make historic choices , and the eventual conclusion of the war.This is an epic mini-series that is memorable and will forever remain a classic of its genre. Highly recommended and a must-watch for history buffs and those interested in WW II history and Holocaust history.",5,War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-series Parts I-XII (Boxed Set- 2008),1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,3455,"['beginning', 'end', 'war', 'lies', 'remembrance-', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'loved', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'remember', 'watching', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'family', 'been', 'years', 'was', 'happy', 'discover', 'entire', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'was', 'available', 'complete', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'affordable', 'price', 'latest', 'boxed', 'set', 'attractively', 'packaged', 'comprises', 'Parts', 'I-', 'VII', '6', 'discs', '13', 'hours', 'Rating', 'NR', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'documentary', 'Making', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'actors', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'author', 'work', 'mini-series', 'was', 'based', 'production', 'personnel', 'including', 'director', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'featurette', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'Living', 'History', 'hosted', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'insert', 'summaries', 'Parts', 'I-VII', 'introductory', 'message', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'message', 'director', 'Dan', 'Curtis.Parts', 'VIII-XII', '5', 'discs', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'Scenes', 'documentary', 'focusing', 'Holocaust', 'segments', 'including', 'new', 'interviews', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'director', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'commentary', 'key', 'scenes', 'TV', 'promos', 'CD', 'original', 'television', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'composed', 'conducted', 'Bob', 'Cobert-', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'longest', 'motion', 'picture', 'score', 'time', 'insert', 'here', 'message', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'episode', 'summaries', 'production', 'new', 'series', 'would', 'advise', 'watching', 'prequel', 'Winds', 'War', 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'week', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'once', 'again', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'members', 'Henry', 'family', 'Victor', 'Pug', 'Henry', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'command', 'U.S.S', 'Northampton', 'whilst', 'eldest', 'son', 'Warren', 'Michael', 'Woods', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'board', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'Byron', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'Pug', 'other', 'son', 'torpedo', 'officer', 'submarine', 'Byron', 'Jewish-American', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'together', 'infant', 'son', 'famous', 'uncle', 'Dr.', 'Aaron', 'Jastrow', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'are', 'trying', 'evade', 'deadly', 'Nazi', 'web', 'events', 'will', 'soon', 'enough', 'conspire', 'Meanwhile', 'Berel', 'Chaim', 'Topol', 'Aaron', 'cousin', 'Soviet', 'POW', 'who', 'up', 'Auschwitz', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Parts', 'VIII-XII', 'see', 'conclusion', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'lives', 'Henrys', 'Jastrows', 'play', 'out', 'backdrop', 'war', 'implementation', 'Final', 'Solution', 'destruction', 'European', 'Jewry', 'made', 'more', 'harrowing', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'Natalie', 'young', 'son', 'uncle', 'Aaron', 'collective', 'suffering', 'depiction', 'Final', 'Solution', 'mass', 'shootings', 'gassings', 'etc', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'horrifying', 'depictions', 'Holocaust', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'other', 'shows', 'come', 'close', 'are', 'Holocaust', 'Amen', 'Schindler', 'List', 'others', 'depictions', 'Nazi', 'brutality', 'are', 'quite', 'gruesome', 'would', 'advise', 'caution', 'showing', 'children', '12', 'Viewers', 'get', 'see', 'leaders', 'sides', 'Allies', 'Axis', 'powers', 'FDR', 'Churchill', 'Hitler', 'etc', 'make', 'historic', 'choices', 'eventual', 'conclusion', 'war.This', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'memorable', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'classic', 'genre', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'must-watch', 'history', 'buffs', 'interested', 'WW', 'II', 'history', 'Holocaust', 'history']",War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-Series
