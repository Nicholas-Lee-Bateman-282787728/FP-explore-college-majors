Lots of things are going on at the same time in real life, and they often contradict each other.  In war, for example, friendship and crass rivalry-- as well as compassion and murderous rage at one another-- can all occur simultaneously.  Characters we may have come to care about deeply live and die for all the right reasons, for all the wrong reasons, or for no reason at all-- all in the same instant of whizzing bullets or exploding shells.  A soldier we come to like and admire obtains a photo off of an anonymous dead enemy portraying a pretty girl he swears he will find to marry after the war; only for her to turn out to be a sniper on the other side who takes his life from a impersonal long distance.  This movie has the grace and wisdom to make all its opposing possibilities seem to fit together organically, into a continuously coherent story.  And each time one thinks the movie has ended, it picks up again with some further wrinkles . . . just like life!  For a long time, people have turned to the arts and religion to punctuate and frame experience-- to reassure them that eventuality is not as random and as full of contradictions, or of things that don't belong together standing side by side-- as it really is.  So we have typically been regaled with protagonists and  antagonists, each type drawn very sharply, reassuring us that the world is indeed just a black and white India ink pen drawing . . . with a resolvable beginning, middle, and end.  Once in a while, however, a true colorist emerges, and we are subjected to the multi-hued nature of genuine existence.  Not everybody can handle that sort of exposure, and it can be very challenging in an initially confusing (ground shaking) sort of way.  I urge you to buy this movie and see how you manage it.  Allow its many-stranded course of events to touch you emotionally.  Then indulge in a bit of soul searching about what happened inside you as you watched . . . and maybe why.  Good luck, and enjoy.  The experience will certainly be worth it.",5,"After ""The Housemaid,"" Korean film does it again!!!",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2059,"['Living', 'never', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'Lots', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'contradict', 'other', 'war', 'example', 'friendship', 'crass', 'rivalry', 'as', 'well', 'compassion', 'murderous', 'rage', 'one', 'can', 'occur', 'simultaneously', 'Characters', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'care', 'deeply', 'live', 'die', 'right', 'reasons', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'reason', 'same', 'instant', 'whizzing', 'bullets', 'exploding', 'shells', 'soldier', 'come', 'like', 'admire', 'photo', 'anonymous', 'dead', 'enemy', 'portraying', 'pretty', 'girl', 'will', 'find', 'marry', 'war', 'only', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'sniper', 'other', 'side', 'who', 'life', 'impersonal', 'long', 'distance', 'movie', 'grace', 'wisdom', 'make', 'opposing', 'possibilities', 'seem', 'fit', 'together', 'organically', 'continuously', 'coherent', 'story', 'time', 'one', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'again', 'further', 'wrinkles', 'just', 'life', 'long', 'time', 'people', 'have', 'turned', 'arts', 'religion', 'punctuate', 'frame', 'experience', 'reassure', 'eventuality', 'not', 'random', 'full', 'contradictions', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'together', 'standing', 'side', 'side', 'really', 'have', 'typically', 'been', 'regaled', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'type', 'drawn', 'very', 'sharply', 'reassuring', 'world', 'indeed', 'just', 'black', 'white', 'India', 'ink', 'pen', 'drawing', 'resolvable', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'Once', 'while', 'however', 'true', 'colorist', 'emerges', 'are', 'subjected', 'multi-hued', 'nature', 'genuine', 'existence', 'Not', 'everybody', 'can', 'handle', 'sort', 'exposure', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'initially', 'confusing', 'ground', 'shaking', 'sort', 'way', 'urge', 'buy', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'manage', 'Allow', 'many-stranded', 'course', 'events', 'touch', 'emotionally', 'Then', 'bit', 'soul', 'searching', 'what', 'happened', 'inside', 'watched', 'maybe', 'why', 'Good', 'luck', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'will', 'certainly', 'be']",N/A

Velasquez,"[6, 9]","Many a time, when I'm watching and truly enjoying a movie, I keep asking myself, ""How come this film did not receive a wider distribution when released - if released at all in the United States?"" I know that you probably feel the same way when watching an excellent so-called foreign or local art movie that you rarely heard or know about. This is what I felt when watching ""The Front Line,"" a quite magnificent and unforgettable film about war and what it does to human beings - simply powerful.The movie stars Ha-kyun Shin as Kang Eun-pyo, a South Korean officer that is transferred to the intelligence unit against his will, and who is immediately sent to the eastern front. His mission is to investigate some alleged illegal behavior of the personnel in that area, which is one of the most brutal of the Korean War. He is told that there may be a spy in the so-called Alligator Company, because an officer was suspiciously assassinated with a South Korean bullet. It was important to put order in the eastern front, for there was a hill - the Aerok Hill - which was of strategic importance for determining the border between the two Koreas. Once at the front, Kang meets Kim Soo-hyeok (Soo Go), a fellow officer and great friend that he thought died few years back. He also discovers that the place is a mess, that morale is low, and discipline is almost non-existent. And it had to be that way, because, according to Kim, during his time with the Alligator Company, they have fought for Aerok Hill at least thirty times, loosing it and gaining it back. It was a never-ending, depressing cycle, due to stupid, easy decisions by the top brass. With time, Kang learns the truth about all the problems with the Alligator Company, and becomes part of the unit. Slowly and painfully, he realizes of the futility of this effort. His friend Kim, at one time, says, ""We could all be in hell, but hell can't be worse than here,"" and that ""winning the war is to survive, to stay alive."" And, sadly, he was right.Directed by Jang Hun, ""The Front Line"" is awesome in every aspect. It has grandiose cinematography, impressive and realistic battle scenes, great acting, and touching and funny moments of camaraderie (especially provided by Sergeant Yang) - all of what makes a war movie great. In the end, they will all realize that their ""enemies weren't the commies but the war itself."" Described as the last battle of the Korean War, ""The Front Line"" is probably the best movie ever about this conflict - a must. I can't praise it enough. The Blu-ray + DVD edition of the film includes a king of documentary, highlights, and more.

1526894,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0076XTFF0,C. Sawin,"[22, 24]","It's 1953 and The Korean War wages on. Negotiations for a ceasefire have been going on for over two years, but nothing has come of it. The South Korean group of men fighting at Aerok Hill is known as Alligator Company. Their commander was said to be shot with a gun from his own side and Intel says there's a spy residing in their midst. First Lieutenant Eun-Pyo (Ha-kyun Shin) of the Defense Security Command is sent to look into it. Once there, Eun-Pyo is reuinited with his best friend from college Su-Hyeok (Soo Go) who Eun-Pyo thought had died at the beginning of the war. But Su-Hyeok is not the man he used to be as his humanity has been stripped away, he doesn't think twice about killing anyone, and has somehow moved up in rank to Lieutenant in just two short years. But Alligator Company is hiding something that lies within the events that occurred at Po-hang and has left their current commanding officer Captain Il-Young (Je-hoon Lee) addicted to morphine.Despite being a fan of horror, blood and guts, and explosions, war movies have always been the oil to my water. No matter how hard you stir or shake the two of us together we just don't mix and have decided to see other genres because of it. It's not that I think war movies are bad. They just haven't appealed to me in the past and every one I've tried to watch up until this point has been okay at best. Maybe it's because I'm getting older or that I'm beginning to notice more during movies, but The Front Line makes me reconsider that opinion and those feelings.Ha-kyun Shin won me over as a fan with his performances in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and No Mercy For the Rude, so my expectations for the acting in this went up a few notches once I noticed him on-screen. Thankfully, those expectations weren't let down. Other than the general that speaks English in a scene very early on in the film, every person in the cast gives first-rate performances. Je-hoon Lee was really something. His addiction to morphine gives Il-young this mysteriousness to him. The last scene Il-Young is in will have you talking about him long after the movie is over. Soo Go was also fantastic. Su-Hyeok is relentless. Whatever happened during the time he was away from Eun-Pyo has made him cruel and relentless; almost a shadow of his former self. His eyes, facial expressions, and mannerisms help bring those feelings to fruition. Then there's Ha-kyun Shin who's just exceptional. He's just so emotionally absorbing. You can't help but glue your eyes to him whenever Eun-Pyo is around.The brilliant cinematography and exceptional lighting add a lot to the film. The lighting felt very natural yet always added just the right amount of light so nothing was ever too dark. The camera work made it seem like you're running around in the trenches with these soldiers. The battlefield was this desolate wasteland littered with loud gunfire and clouds of smoke. Most of the colors are very washed out as browns, grays, and various shades of navy green are the majority of the colors used in the film. But then you see something like a bright blue tablecloth and it just jumps off the screen because of the washed out colors you're used to. Plants, bloodshed, snow, rain, fog, and forests make things appear to be momentarily richer than they really are.The warfare isn't quite as gruesome as I was expecting. There was still quite a bit of blood, but it almost appeared to be more brown than red at times. Seeing somebody without an arm or a leg was a lot more unnerving. The orphans running around the Alligator Company camp bring out a few ""wow"" moments in the film. The chocolate bar scene and their scene with Su-Hyeok are both just heartbreaking.I would argue that the drama almost outweighs the war in The Front Line, but then most of the drama is happening because of the war. So it's an endless cycle. It's a bit surprising how good The Front Line is though. With its rich cinematography, smooth storytelling, and passionate performances, it's difficult to argue its merit.",4,"""I used to ask God to save, but now I ask him to kill.""",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,4033,"['1953', 'Korean', 'War', 'wages', 'Negotiations', 'ceasefire', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'two', 'years', 'nothing', 'come', 'South', 'Korean', 'group', 'men', 'fighting', 'Aerok', 'Hill', 'known', 'Alligator', 'Company', 'commander', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'shot', 'gun', 'own', 'side', 'Intel', 'spy', 'residing', 'midst', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'Eun-Pyo', 'Ha-kyun', 'Shin', 'Defense', 'Security', 'Command', 'sent', 'look', 'Once', 'there', 'Eun-Pyo', 'reuinited', 'best', 'friend', 'college', 'Su-Hyeok', 'Soo', 'Go', 'who', 'Eun-Pyo', 'thought', 'had', 'died', 'beginning', 'war', 'Su-Hyeok', 'not', 'man', 'used', 'be', 'humanity', 'been', 'stripped', 'away', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'killing', 'anyone', 'somehow', 'moved', 'up', 'rank', 'Lieutenant', 'just', 'two', 'short', 'years', 'Alligator', 'Company', 'hiding', 'something', 'events', 'occurred', 'Po-hang', 'left', 'current', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Il-Young', 'Je-hoon', 'Lee', 'addicted', 'morphine.Despite', 'being', 'fan', 'horror', 'blood', 'guts', 'explosions', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'oil', 'water', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'stir', 'shake', 'two', 'together', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'have', 'decided', 'see', 'other', 'genres', 'not', 'think', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'appealed', 'past', 'one', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'watch', 'up', 'point', 'been', 'okay', 'best', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'getting', 'older', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'notice', 'more', 'movies', 'Front', 'Line', 'reconsider', 'opinion', 'feelings.Ha-kyun', 'Shin', 'won', 'over', 'fan', 'performances', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'No', 'Mercy', 'Rude', 'expectations', 'acting', 'went', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'once', 'noticed', 'on-screen', 'Thankfully', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'Other', 'general', 'English', 'scene', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'person', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'Je-hoon', 'Lee', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'addiction', 'morphine', 'Il-young', 'mysteriousness', 'last', 'scene', 'Il-Young', 'will', 'have', 'talking', 'long', 'movie', 'Soo', 'Go', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Su-Hyeok', 'relentless', 'happened', 'time', 'was', 'away', 'Eun-Pyo', 'made', 'cruel', 'relentless', 'almost', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'help', 'bring', 'feelings', 'fruition', 'Then', 'Ha-kyun', 'Shin', 'who', 'just', 'exceptional', 'just', 'so', 'emotionally', 'absorbing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'glue', 'eyes', 'whenever', 'Eun-Pyo', 'around.The', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'lighting', 'add', 'lot', 'film', 'lighting', 'felt', 'very', 'natural', 'yet', 'always', 'added', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'light', 'nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'too', 'dark', 'camera', 'work', 'made', 'seem', ""'re"", 'running', 'around', 'trenches', 'soldiers', 'battlefield', 'was', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'littered', 'loud', 'gunfire', 'clouds', 'smoke', 'Most', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'washed', 'out', 'browns', 'grays', 'various', 'shades', 'navy', 'green', 'are', 'majority', 'colors', 'used', 'film', 'then', 'see', 'something', 'bright', 'blue', 'tablecloth', 'just', 'screen', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', ""'re"", 'used', 'Plants', 'bloodshed', 'snow', 'rain', 'fog', 'forests', 'make', 'things', 'appear', 'be', 'momentarily', 'richer', 'really', 'are.The', 'warfare', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'gruesome', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'blood', 'almost', 'appeared', 'be', 'more', 'brown', 'red', 'times', 'Seeing', 'somebody', 'arm', 'leg', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'unnerving', 'orphans', 'running', 'around', 'Alligator', 'Company', 'camp', 'bring', 'out', 'few', 'wow', 'moments', 'film', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'scene', 'scene', 'Su-Hyeok', 'are', 'just', 'heartbreaking.I', 'would', 'argue', 'drama', 'almost', 'war', 'Front', 'Line', 'then', 'most', 'drama', 'happening', 'war', 'endless', 'cycle', 'bit', 'surprising', 'how', 'good', 'Front', 'Line', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'smooth', 'storytelling', 'passionate', 'performances', 'difficult', 'argue', 'merit']",N/A
1526895,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0076XTFF0,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[57, 60]","Koreans know a thing or two about war.  While the Korean War lasted from 1950 - 1953, the nation remains divided into the Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea even today, a source of constant tension between the two peoples.  It's hard to imagine the stress and discord created between families broken apart due to living on opposing sides of the 38th Parallel, but films like THE FRONT LINE can offer citizens of the world a look back at the final moments of a struggle still creating divisions even today.THE FRONT LINE primarily deals with the various battles surrounding Aerok Hills, a hilly, cave- and trench-filled area where the fiercest battles result in the large piece of property changing hands between the two nations several times.  A South Korean company commander turns up dead, but, when the body is examined, he's found to have been killed by one of his nation's weapons.  Defense Security Lieutenant Kang Eun-Pyo (played by Shin Ha-kyun) is sent to investigate the affairs of Alligator Company.  Once there, he learns that a former soldier/friend of his, Kim Soo-Hyuk (Go Soo) - a man he long thought dead - is still alive, and Kim's actions may very well be close to the mystery of what's happened at the front.  Assuming Kang can survive the battles long enough, he may learn the shocking secret of what drove a soldier to turn on his superior ... a secret that may prove better left unknown.The film is a powder keg of action, intrigue, and drama as it explores not only the complex relationships that these soldiers develop in their respective times of crisis but also delves deeply into what it means to sacrifice for one's nation.  The audience is introduced to all of Alligator Company, and they're shown with all their beauty and scars.  They laugh together, they cry together, and, if fate has it, they die together, but never do they go into it blindly or without a reasonable amount of reflection on what war - the most brutal experience known to man - has done to them and their band of brothers.Also, the script is wonderfully peppered with amazing character moments.  Each of these soldiers - even the few we're introduced to in service to North Korea - are given some defining characteristic: no one is simple a soldier or a killing machine, even if that's the role they may inevitably play in the climax.  For example, an adversarial officer is shown early on in flashback, and, when confronting his enemy, he's respectful and, even, forgiving about having done what was needed to capture them.  Showing compassion, he turns them loose, telling them that the war will be over soon.  When we see this officer later - after the strain of three years of fighting - he maintains his nobility, but his face and body are covered with scars - the most strikingly visible effect combat can have on flesh.  The message here is that no one - despite their predilection for goodness and mercy - escapes war without consequence, a grim message indeed.While the narrative is clearly very anti-war (certainly, a handful of characters all reflect on the futility of the campaign to recapture Aerok Hills from the enemy), the film never descends (as so many American films tend to as of late) into sanctimonious preaching about the ills of combat.  Yes, all of these men are scarred from what they've done; and, yes, they each go to some length to question the legitimacy of it; but, in the end, they're all soldiers doing a dirty job.  As much as they'd like to put it all behind them, they repeatedly toe-the-line - with some prodding for drama's sake - with a spirit of nationalism, pride, and honor to carry out their orders.The camerawork is particularly harrowing as these men march, climb and crawl throughout the blasted remnants of Aerok Hills.  Other engagements are shown in flashback (I won't spoil any details, suffice it to say that there's a very specific backstory to the central mystery; it doesn't fully unfold until fairly late in the picture, but it's a frightening experience that underscores why some of these soldiers act the way they do).  The majority of it appears to have been accomplished through handheld cameras - with a fair amount of jerkiness to the action - but, unlike other films, I never found it intrusive or unnecessarily disturbing.  Director Jang Hun struck a terrific balance between the heavier and the lighter moments - inserting moments of human tenderness to balance out the realities of harsh combat.  Where some films descend into what's been termed `war porn,' THE FRONT LINE retains a focus on recording the history of these events, always leveraging them against the human cost, and it's exceedingly well done from start to finish.The film is a joint presentation of Showbox and Mediaplex with production by A-Po Films.  It served as South Korea's official submission to the 84th annual Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film, and it won four Grand Bell Awards (awards presented annually by The Motion Pictures Association of Korea), including Best Planning, Best Cinematography, Best Lighting, and Best Picture.  The disc is marvelously produced with exceptional picture and sound.  Sadly, there's only a brief (3 minute) `making of' feature, but there's also a section of the film's highlights and several trailers.  Still, the film's a winner through-and-through, and this is one that deserves to be in any film fan's collection.  English-subtitled.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  It's as gritty and uncompromising as it is heartfelt.  THE FRONT LINE starts out slowly but builds toward its dramatic war-torn conclusion.  This is take-no-prisoners guerilla filmmaking on par with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and Korea's own TAEGUKGI or SILMIDO.  This is one of the best films on war that I've seen in a very long time.  It's pitch & picture perfect.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE FRONT LINE for the expressed purposes

That's pretty much of what this Korean War based film is all about.Here's the scoop. The North and South Koreans have been negotiating a peace for two years, and one of the sticking points is a hill that seems to switch occupation, between the two, on a near daily basis. An intelligence officer from the South is sent to said hill because there is evidence of a mole in the troops. He gets there to find a truly cock-eyed situation in place.This is one of the best war movies ever made. That it deals with the Korean War is a plus because few films concern that conflict. I also like that it deals entirely with Korean troops. There is only one round eye, an officer, in the film. But it is a bizarre situation. Yes the two sides fight each other, but because they trade occupation of the hill so regularly, they leave gifts of booze, cigarettes and the like for each other. They deliver mail for each other as well. The intelligence officer comes to realize this is not a normal situation. But the war rages on and both sides go through the charade of taking the hill and giving it back again.This is a beautifully shot and directed film. The characters are drawn and acted well. The prelude to the final, insane battle I did not believe. I liked it. I wanted to believe it but couldn't.

1526906,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B0076XTFF0,Luke Killion,"[4, 5]","""The Front Line"" is a 2011 Korean film about the last months of their civil war, beginning during the winter of 1952-53.  I have seen the other well known movie about Korea, ""Tae Guk Gi"", which recieved alot of attention in an international audience upon its release in 2004. There is a similar sytle in ""The Front Line"", as both films are from Korean cinema, but this 2011 movie seemed much more realistic than the ""Tag Guk Gi"" for many reasons. The 2004 film is more of an action flick, with over the top body counts and Ramboesque heroics. It has some obvious strengths and commentary upon the war, but I didn't find it to measure up to the ""Band of Brothers"" standard which one reviewer compared to ""The Front Line.""The central theme of ""Tae Guk Gi"" focuses on brotherhood and the divided nature of one people that caused the Korean War. This is very much a part of ""The Front Line"", but the main factor that puts it above ""Ta Guk Gi"" would have to be the realism of the combat scenes and very strong writing, with an added bit of mystery regarding the true loyalties and morale of Korean troops on both sides of the 38th parallel. There has been much said about the fighting capacities of the ROK forces that fought along side Americans and other UN nations. Many American troops lay blame at their feet for the epic collapse during the first winter of the war when the Chinese counterattacked along the Yalu river. Many eye witnesses say the Chinese sought out ROK sectors to specifically attack in order to roll up the American flanks. Though this is probably true, the same sources also remember there were many excellent Korean units, whose effort was impressive for a nation that had no real tradition of independant miltary bodies prior to the splitting of Korea at the end of WWII.The biggest strength of this picture was ability to show the overall quagmired situation that developed in the latter years of Korea, as well as a seamless connection between a military investigation(which shines light upon some of the reasons for ""innefficiency"" in the ROK forces) and the combat over the main ""hill feature"" of the movie, Aerok. The loyalty and integrity of a company in the 10th ROK Division is put into question when their commanding officer is killed and Counter Intelligence picks up letters sent from a Northern soldier to his family in the south. A CIC officer (Eun Pyo) is sent to find a possible traitor, and encounters his old friend who he believed to be dead, who has risen in Alligator company from private to platoon commander.The see saw fighting over AeroK shows the viscious nature of the mountain fighting in Korea as well as the bloody stalemate that made the chewed up hill the sole arena for fighting in that sector of the front line. There is also a depiction of the differece between North Korean units and those of the Chinese; this scene is truely awe inspiring in its terror, as the reenactment of a human wave attack is one of eeriest single shots in any war movie I've come across.The location for this picture was amazing, as was the CGI mixed with cinametography that showed the setting typical in most of the fighting throughout Korea. As far as the character drama goes, the reality that Eun Pyo exposes shows the plight of the Korean people enmeshed in a civil war.

This and also some other inteligence seems indicate, that there is a North Korean agent infiltrated amongst the soldiers. Kang's mission is to identify this man. But once he arrives to his new unit he finds much, much more than he expected. And also, Aerok Hill must be retaken - at any cost...All this covers the first five minutes of the film and I will say no more here - you deserve to discover this excellent film by yourself.The scenario is very, very good and very original. This film is different from anything else I ever saw. Surprises are many and we do not see most of them coming. Things described are very believable and people act logically, although the logic can be sometimes a little bit... odd. With the time we start to develop an attachment to some characters, like the drug addicted Captain Shin, the veteran of anti-Japanese guerrilla Master-Sergeant Yang and even the cold and cruel Lieutenant Kim. At one moment we even have an insight into the minds of North Korean soldiers (in a rare moment when no political officer is present) and frankly I was pretty impressed by those scenes.Action scenes are exceptionally good, and certainly better than in the more renowned ""Brotherhood"". Great attention was given to the details concerning weaponry and uniforms. South Korean soldiers are armed with M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles, M1 semi-automatic carbines, Browning BAR light machine guns, 60 mm light American mortars and Colt M1911 pistols. North Koreans have Mosin 1891 rifles (and also for one of them a Mosin 1891/44 sniper rifle), PPSh-41 sub-machine guns, Maxim-Putilov 1910 heavy machine guns, 82 mm Soviet mortars and Mauser 1896 pistols. I couldn't find one mistake concerning military equipement.The final battle and the final scene are amongst the most powerful things I ever saw on screen. I will say no more here, but believe me, if you like war films, you WANT to see the last 15 minutes of this film.Bottom line, this is an exceptionnally good film, of highest quality, in my modest opinion better in every aspect than ""Brotherhood"".

(Paraphrase)  A North Korean commander lectures a group of South Korean prisoners during the opening weeks of the war, and surprisingly, let's them go because he believes that the war will be over soon.  This line is one of the key quotes that fuses this well-built war drama together: to show the ferocity, the futility, and cruelty during a war of attrition...and both sides lose.Lt. Kang Eun-pyo from Counter Intelligence is given an assignment in the last few weeks of the Korean War, during the close of the long and arduous truce talks between North Korea/China and South Korea/The UN.  Reports from the Eastern Front show that there is a spy within the Republic of Korea camp, where there are letters being sent out from the North Korean side to the South, and a commanding officer was shot...with a bullet from a South Korean weapon.  Eun-pyo and a new CO, along with a raw recruit, head to the front to find a dazed and battle-hardened ""Alligator Unit.""  This unit has been fighting back and forth against the enemy for the Aerok Hills, which up to this point in the movie has been lost and won several times.  Eun-pyo finds unusual circumstances among the camp such as a very young captain who is addicted to morphine, a crazy soldier who keeps asking ""where is 2nd platoon,"" and finally running into his best friend Su-hyeok whom he thought he lost during the North Korean invasion.  Everything is changed and the will to battle is more about orders rather than patriotism.  We find later that there are moments of compromise and cooperation between the Northern and Southern sides in a very unusual plot twist.As the story unfolds, the director sets the atmosphere of attrition and the viewer gets a feel of how grueling it must be for this unit to survive and do their best to keep their sanity.  The opening battle scenes watching the ROK soldiers climbing the hills to dislodge the North Koreans is bitter, long, and tough to watch.  Later in the film the North takes it back, which leaves a feeling of void to see the waste of life over a few miles of land (ala WWI).  You see the film as not of a story of courageous men who feel that they must finish the war, but of a tired unit who wants to go home.  You see scenes of the North Koreans as well who have this same mood in their camp.  Each character is haunted by their past, but at this point the fatigue of war has clouded the judgment of each soldier to the point where survival vs. right and wrong rule their decisions.  Eun-pyo comes to this realization and is horrified, but slowly towards the end he too sees why the soldiers do these things.This has been one of the more better war films I have seen in a while, especially for a foreign war film.  Though over dramatic at times, I felt it has done a better job in many areas to display the reality of war compared to the other blockbuster film, ""Taegukgi."" The violence is raw and ferocious, but you see that this film also displays humor, camaraderie, depth, and fairness to both sides.  It has elements of Catch-22 of fighting a losing battle while the truce talks are going on, especially after everyone loses reason to fight.  A must recommended film to see the human price paid for a war that has destroyed a nation: where war is now meaningless and where minds break.",5,The Fatigue of War,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,3394,"['Do', 'guys', 'know', 'why', 'are', 'losing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reason', 'are', 'fighting', 'Paraphrase', 'A', 'North', 'Korean', 'commander', 'group', 'South', 'Korean', 'prisoners', 'opening', 'weeks', 'war', 'surprisingly', 'let', 'go', 'war', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'line', 'one', 'key', 'quotes', 'well-built', 'war', 'drama', 'together', 'show', 'ferocity', 'futility', 'cruelty', 'war', 'attrition', 'sides', 'lose.Lt', 'Kang', 'Eun-pyo', 'Counter', 'Intelligence', 'given', 'assignment', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'Korean', 'War', 'close', 'long', 'arduous', 'truce', 'talks', 'North', 'Korea/China', 'South', 'Korea/The', 'UN', 'Reports', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'show', 'spy', 'Republic', 'Korea', 'camp', 'where', 'are', 'letters', 'being', 'sent', 'out', 'North', 'Korean', 'side', 'South', 'commanding', 'officer', 'was', 'shot', 'bullet', 'South', 'Korean', 'weapon', 'Eun-pyo', 'new', 'CO', 'raw', 'recruit', 'head', 'front', 'find', 'dazed', 'battle-hardened', 'Alligator', 'Unit', 'unit', 'been', 'fighting', 'back', 'forth', 'enemy', 'Aerok', 'Hills', 'up', 'point', 'movie', 'been', 'lost', 'won', 'several', 'times', 'Eun-pyo', 'finds', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'camp', 'such', 'very', 'young', 'captain', 'who', 'addicted', 'morphine', 'crazy', 'soldier', 'who', 'asking', 'where', '2nd', 'platoon', 'finally', 'running', 'best', 'friend', 'Su-hyeok', 'whom', 'thought', 'lost', 'North', 'Korean', 'invasion', 'Everything', 'changed', 'will', 'battle', 'more', 'orders', 'rather', 'patriotism', 'find', 'later', 'are', 'moments', 'compromise', 'cooperation', 'Northern', 'Southern', 'sides', 'very', 'unusual', 'plot', 'story', 'unfolds', 'director', 'atmosphere', 'attrition', 'viewer', 'feel', 'how', 'grueling', 'must', 'be', 'unit', 'survive', 'do', 'best', 'keep', 'sanity', 'opening', 'battle', 'scenes', 'watching', 'ROK', 'soldiers', 'climbing', 'hills', 'dislodge', 'North', 'Koreans', 'bitter', 'long', 'tough', 'watch', 'Later', 'film', 'North', 'back', 'feeling', 'void', 'see', 'waste', 'life', 'few', 'miles', 'land', 'ala', 'WWI', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'story', 'courageous', 'men', 'who', 'feel', 'must', 'finish', 'war', 'tired', 'unit', 'who', 'go', 'home', 'see', 'scenes', 'North', 'Koreans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'have', 'same', 'mood', 'camp', 'character', 'haunted', 'past', 'point', 'fatigue', 'war', 'clouded', 'judgment', 'soldier', 'point', 'where', 'survival', 'vs.', 'right', 'wrong', 'rule', 'decisions', 'Eun-pyo', 'realization', 'horrified', 'slowly', 'end', 'too', 'why', 'soldiers', 'do', 'things.This', 'been', 'one', 'more', 'better', 'war', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'especially', 'foreign', 'war', 'film', 'dramatic', 'times', 'felt', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'many', 'areas', 'display', 'reality', 'war', 'compared', 'other', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'Taegukgi', 'violence', 'raw', 'ferocious', 'see', 'film', 'also', 'humor', 'camaraderie', 'depth', 'fairness', 'sides', 'elements', 'Catch-22', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'truce', 'talks', 'are', 'going', 'especially', 'everyone', 'reason', 'fight', 'must', 'recommended', 'film', 'see', 'human', 'price', 'paid', 'war', 'destroyed', 'nation', 'where', 'war', 'now', 'meaningless', 'where', 'minds', 'break']",N/A

This one is about the last battle or properly battles that took place in the dyeing embers of that sad conflict (that is still officially not ended). All hills were strategic and Aerok Hill is one such command and has been taken and lost at least thirty times by Alligator Company of the South Korean Army.Then their captain winds up dead and it is found that he has been killed by a South Korean bullet, yet he was reported K.I.A (killed in action), so a keen young Lieutenant of the Defence Security Command Kang Eun-Pyo is sent to the Front Line to investigate. On his arrival he finds the place in disarray and the man who has been in leading the men is an old friend Kim Soo-Hyeok (also supposedly K.I.A.) There is also a replacement Commander who from his corpulent appearance, has not spent much of the war on `exercises' unless that was to the kebab shop.Kang Eun-Pyo starts investigating and starts to uncover small things but is generally met with a wall of silence. At the same time the truce negotiations rumble on but hostilities are not allowed to end - rather like World War I. So the killing continues and boy do we get a lot of that. Not only in battle but in the caves and the activities of some very cruel snipers. Korean films have garnered a reputation for making excellent war films, `Brotherhood', '71, Into The Fire' and `Assembly' and this is another to add to that list of quality if emotional films.The action is frequent and top notch, it can be fairly bloody too and sometime quite personal. There is as ever a plethora of characters, with the seventeen year old green recruit to the gnarled veteran from the War of Liberation of WW II. We also have characters that are less than black and white which is always welcoming and a past event from 1950 in the failed landings at Pohang that still haunts the company. The weapons and uniforms are pretty much spot on and the CGi is so good you accept it as authentic.There are a lot of emotional rants, but that goes with the territory and there is a bucket of not so subtle politicising. That is about reunification, a thread that runs from the start and through out the film, which some may find a bit of a stretch, to say why would be a plot spoiler. That all said this runs for just over two hours and held my attention from the very start and yes I was rooting for almost everyone, even the less heroic of the bunch. Director Hun Jang has done a great job with a great cast. The DVD has a whole disc of extras which has so much on it that it is like an extra film with a `making of' and loads more. In Korean with English sub titles this is a must for all serious fans of world cinema especially the ones with ruddy good battles in.",5,Excellent Telling of the Last Battle of the Korean War,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,2813,"['Yes', 'Korean', 'War', 'film', 'yes', 'Korean', 'War', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'make', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'last', 'battle', 'properly', 'battles', 'took', 'place', 'dyeing', 'embers', 'sad', 'conflict', 'still', 'officially', 'not', 'ended', 'hills', 'were', 'strategic', 'Aerok', 'Hill', 'one', 'such', 'command', 'been', 'taken', 'lost', 'least', 'thirty', 'times', 'Alligator', 'Company', 'South', 'Korean', 'Army.Then', 'captain', 'up', 'dead', 'found', 'been', 'killed', 'South', 'Korean', 'bullet', 'yet', 'was', 'reported', 'K.I.A', 'killed', 'action', 'so', 'keen', 'young', 'Lieutenant', 'Defence', 'Security', 'Command', 'Kang', 'Eun-Pyo', 'sent', 'Front', 'Line', 'investigate', 'arrival', 'place', 'disarray', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'leading', 'men', 'old', 'friend', 'Kim', 'Soo-Hyeok', 'also', 'supposedly', 'K.I.A', 'also', 'replacement', 'Commander', 'who', 'corpulent', 'appearance', 'not', 'spent', 'much', 'war', 'exercises', 'was', 'kebab', 'shop.Kang', 'Eun-Pyo', 'starts', 'investigating', 'starts', 'uncover', 'small', 'things', 'generally', 'met', 'wall', 'silence', 'same', 'time', 'truce', 'negotiations', 'rumble', 'hostilities', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'end', 'rather', 'World', 'War', 'killing', 'boy', 'do', 'get', 'lot', 'Not', 'only', 'battle', 'caves', 'activities', 'very', 'cruel', 'snipers', 'Korean', 'films', 'have', 'garnered', 'reputation', 'making', 'excellent', 'war', 'films', 'Brotherhood', ""'71"", 'Into', 'Fire', 'Assembly', 'add', 'list', 'quality', 'emotional', 'films.The', 'action', 'frequent', 'top', 'notch', 'can', 'be', 'fairly', 'bloody', 'too', 'sometime', 'quite', 'personal', 'ever', 'plethora', 'characters', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'green', 'recruit', 'gnarled', 'veteran', 'War', 'Liberation', 'WW', 'II', 'also', 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'black', 'white', 'always', 'welcoming', 'past', 'event', '1950', 'failed', 'landings', 'Pohang', 'still', 'company', 'weapons', 'uniforms', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot', 'CGi', 'so', 'good', 'accept', 'are', 'lot', 'emotional', 'rants', 'territory', 'bucket', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'politicising', 'reunification', 'thread', 'start', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'stretch', 'say', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'said', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'held', 'attention', 'very', 'start', 'yes', 'was', 'rooting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'even', 'less', 'heroic', 'bunch', 'Director', 'Hun', 'Jang', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'cast', 'DVD', 'whole', 'disc', 'extras', 'so', 'much', 'extra', 'film', 'making', 'more', 'Korean', 'English', 'sub', 'titles', 'must', 'serious', 'fans', 'world', 'cinema', 'especially', 'ones', 'ruddy', 'good', 'battles']",N/A

Toward the end of Korean War Lieutenant Kang Eun-Pyo is sent to investigate a murder on the front lines. He reaches the area called Aerok Hill where the fighting is most intense. Soon after the truth is reveled a cease fire is signed and the two sides rejoice. But the war is far from over. This war movie interested me more then most of the recent ones. The main reason is that my grandfather served in the Korean War and there hasn't been a lot of movies made about that war. I was interested to see the stuff he refused to tell me about. After watching this I can see why. The movie is a Korean movie so the entire movie deals with a platoon of South Korean soldiers and their struggles. I have said before that for better or worse every war movie since it's release is compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"", and I never thought a movie could top that one. This is as close as I've seen and in some ways may be better. This is far and away better then ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" but like both of those movies you are so involved with the characters it is no longer a movie of nameless faces dying but people you feel a connection with. This movie makes you feel all kinds of emotions but the last half hour will make you feel things you never knew you could. Another example of how much power a movie has when it's done right. I highly recommend this movie. Overall, one of, if not the best war movie I have ever seen. I give it an A.",5,"One of, if not the best war movie I have ever seen.

1526919,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0076XTFF0,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Set in the last days of the Korean War, ""The Front Line"" follows the story of a South Korean intelligence officer Kang Eun-pyo (Ha-kyun Shin), sent to the front line of the fictional Aerok Hills (Korea read backward), in order to investigate the possible murder of the commanding officer. It is also suspected that someone in the Alligator Company, renowned as the best soldiers of the army, might be receiving letters from the opposing North Korean forces.Kang Eun-pyo arrives at the front line, where he rejoices at the sight of Kim Soo-hyeok (Soo Go), his long-missing friend. His joy is short-lived, however, since he is soon dismayed at things are turning out. The new commanding officer is arrogant and incompetent. The soldiers are tired and ill-equipped. The negotiations for cease-fire go on and on.Those who are familiar with South Korean-made war movies (like ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"") know that there is a certain set of conventions in this genre, such as emotional stories that are often about two protagonists, and fierce military action sequences. ""The Front Line"" has both of them, a dramatic storyline and powerful combat sequences, and it works.With a few twists in the plotline and several credible characters we can relate to, ""The Front Line"" (South Korea's submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film) is a compelling war drama.

It is full of much action and warfare, which takes place in the last months of the killing in 1953. What is depressing is that after all these soldiers have been through, they make it to the end of the violence and begin to celebrate the idea of going home again. Then they are told by the idiots in High Command that the armistice won't take place for another 12 hours, so they have to go and risk their lives shooting at more North Korean troops until then. I can't imagine the thoughts that ran through their minds!!!What happened after that and before? Watch the movie! South Korea makes a good war movie about the Korean War.
