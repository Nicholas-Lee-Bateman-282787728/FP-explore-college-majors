1266797,A3LVWAIK5YN22G,B002FP1430,"James Bennett ""Second star to the right, and ...","[4, 6]","I am rating this review based on Bill's prior stand-ups. I have ordered this DVD, and anxiously await it. Bill is my wife and mine's favorite comedian out of the Blue Collar group. We like Jeff and Larry, but Bill is our favorite. Ron is our black sheep, that we would rather not see on the Blue Collar list. Anyway, I also wanted to review this because the only other reviewer here is by someone who bought the wrong item, and reviewed the DVD instead of the CD. I don't think any of Bill's stuff should have a 1 star rating. He turns everyday life into funny stuff. That's where Bill and Jeff top the cake, because they make family life that would normally be mondane, into funny, and at the same time, keep it clean. Larry is also funny, but for a different reason, he makes fun of all those who think you have to be pollitcally correct around everyone. As a Christmas present for my wife, I bought this DVD and tickets to Bill's show this tour. This is something she has wanted to go to for years now, ever since she heard him on his ""Hers's Your Sign"" CD. So, I really look forward to seeing this DVD, and being able to see Bill in person for the first time with my wife. I hope he keeps on doing the stand up, unlike Jeff, who I thought should have kept going with it and gave it up for too many TV Shows that didn't make it (except: ""Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader).

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[4, 4]","Engvall pitches himself this time as an outsider: not the smart guy handing signs to idiots, but a guy struggling to understand an incomprehensible world.  Women, culture, technology, society... you name it, Engvall struggles to understand it, and can't.  And he invites you to share in his incomprehension, like maybe we can work together to figure out the tough knots.Part of Engvall's magic is that he doesn't lapse into frantic mannerisms or mug for the camera.  He talks to his audience like we're at our local pub, commiserating because we got old and the world has left us behind.  His conversational tone, leavened with clean humor and sympathetic friendliness, hasn't shown up in comedy much since Carson died, and I've mourned its absence.Where his Blue Collar fellow travellers have grown aggressive in their down-home portrayals, Engvall remains disarming because I don't feel like he's playing a character.  He feels like that funny friend we all have, offering us another beer and telling us a story that cracks us up because it feels real.  We see ourselves in him.
