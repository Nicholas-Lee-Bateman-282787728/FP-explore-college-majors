I've seen a few gambling films and this is the one to see.  In this true story from the early 1980s Mahowny has a girlfriend in Minner Driver who sticks with him in spite of his gambling problem.  It's kind of like Leaving Las Vegas in that his girlfriend sticks with him unconditionally.The thrill he gets from gambling he rates a 100, compared to anything else in his life which he rates a 20.  When he walks into John Hurt's Casino in Atlantic City Hurt uses every possible psychological trick to catch the ""whale"".  He has his most beautiful hostess keep Mahowny's dinner on stand-by.  He sends up the sexiest hooker in the place, and he has a kitchen worker ""stick with him"".  But Mahowny doesn't care about any of it...he's the ""Iceman"" who only cares about gambling.  Meanwhile he gets through a bank audit and seems homefree until the Canadian authorities get wise.  His bookie is played by Maury Chaykin, yes, the guy who always looks like a sleezeball.But John Hurt is what really makes this film cool, as the cool Casino manager who's always on top of things: he reassures the owner when Mahowny's way up, ""ask me how we're doing at 4AM"".I guess that's what's least understandable to people about gambling addicts...even if they're winning big they never just walk away.  But it also depicts what a Casino will do for a whale: any desire fulfilled.",4,Hoffman and Hurt in well done true-to-life gambling film,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,1516,"['Owning', 'Mahowny', 'stars', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Canadian', 'banker', 'who', '22,000', 'Canadian', 'millions', 'can', 'blow', 'Atlantic', 'City', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'gambling', 'films', 'one', 'see', 'true', 'story', 'early', '1980s', 'Mahowny', 'girlfriend', 'Minner', 'Driver', 'who', 'spite', 'gambling', 'problem', 'kind', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'girlfriend', 'sticks', 'unconditionally.The', 'thrill', 'gambling', 'rates', '100', 'compared', 'anything', 'else', 'life', 'rates', '20', 'When', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Casino', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Hurt', 'possible', 'psychological', 'trick', 'catch', 'whale', 'most', 'beautiful', 'hostess', 'keep', 'Mahowny', 'dinner', 'stand-by', 'up', 'sexiest', 'hooker', 'place', 'kitchen', 'worker', 'stick', 'Mahowny', ""n't"", 'care', 'Iceman', 'who', 'only', 'gambling', 'Meanwhile', 'bank', 'audit', 'homefree', 'Canadian', 'authorities', 'get', 'wise', 'bookie', 'played', 'Maury', 'Chaykin', 'yes', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'sleezeball.But', 'John', 'Hurt', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'cool', 'cool', 'Casino', 'manager', 'who', 'always', 'top', 'things', 'owner', 'when', 'Mahowny', 'way', 'up', 'ask', 'how', ""'re"", 'doing', '4AM', '.I', 'guess', 'what', 'least', 'understandable', 'people', 'gambling', 'addicts', 'even', ""'re"", 'winning', 'big', 'never', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'also', 'what', 'Casino', 'will', 'do', 'whale', 'desire', 'fulfilled']",N/A
771636,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0000BXMZ8,Alistair McHarg,"[1, 1]","Many movies are ""based on a true story,"" but fail to convey the drama of their sources.  Owning Mahowny is the opposite.  By faithfully recreating the bizarre true story of Dan Mahowny with glamourless authenticity it mercilessly reveals the reality of addiction.  Hoffman's restrained performance as Mahowny is the key to its success.The plot is as simple, and focused, as Mahowny's life.  A bank Vice President in Toronto embezzles 10 million dollars and - because he is a compulsive gambler (and how!) - manages to squander it on bets with his local bookie and tables in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  He is inevitably caught and serves a pretty light 6-year sentence for his caper.What's so profoundly disturbing is that for Mahowny, it really is this simple, for him it's all about the game.  (It had to be explained to me that gamblers do not gamble in hopes of winning, indeed, at one point Mahowny is up millions of dollars.  They gamble for the rush, the adrenaline hit of being at the point where in an instant it is possible to lose everything.)  Mahoney is so compulsive that he bets randomly - all the home teams - all the underdogs - etc.  Even his bookie is appalled.  This is not an activity with an endgame - the juice is all in the next bet, like any true addiction the only point of doing it is doing it some more.Everything about this movie's construction reinforces the purity of addiction - it's always first.  Mahowny's car is so beat the parking lot attendant makes fun of it.  Mahowny himself looks like an unmade bed, ill-fitting clothes, physically unattractive, his body language screams, ""Property Condemned - Keep Out.""  Mahowny never makes eye contact; obviously content to live in the isolation that comes with every kind of addiction.  His girlfriend Belinda, Minnie Driver, is the very embodiment of codependence.  A nice girl who could do better elsewhere she has yet to learn that loving an addict - or at least being loved by one - is an impossibility.The movie is not without irony.  Mahowny lives a bipolar life - bank - gambling.  He steals from one and donates to the other.  In the banking world, one assumes, money is handled responsibly.  But in one memorable scene we watch bank officials discuss how to manipulate star clients into extending their debt into unsafe territory.  How different is it, we wonder, from the blatant bloodsucking of casino manager Victor Foss?  John Hurt's portrayal of Foss actually outshines Hoffman; it is perfection.  Foss knows every trick there is to part a fool from his money, but he quickly realizes that Mahowny is no ordinary fool.  He is a perfect fool, so single-mindedly focused on his addiction that the temptations sure to manipulate mere mortals cannot distract him.  Powerful voodoo.",4,The Biggest Loser,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,2772,"['Many', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'fail', 'convey', 'drama', 'sources', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'opposite', 'faithfully', 'recreating', 'bizarre', 'true', 'story', 'Dan', 'Mahowny', 'glamourless', 'authenticity', 'mercilessly', 'reality', 'addiction', 'Hoffman', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Mahowny', 'key', 'success.The', 'plot', 'as', 'simple', 'focused', 'Mahowny', 'life', 'A', 'bank', 'Vice', 'President', 'Toronto', '10', 'million', 'dollars', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'how', 'squander', 'bets', 'local', 'bookie', 'tables', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'inevitably', 'caught', 'pretty', 'light', '6-year', 'sentence', 'caper.What', 'so', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'Mahowny', 'really', 'simple', 'game', 'had', 'be', 'explained', 'gamblers', 'do', 'not', 'gamble', 'hopes', 'winning', 'indeed', 'one', 'point', 'Mahowny', 'up', 'millions', 'dollars', 'gamble', 'rush', 'adrenaline', 'hit', 'being', 'point', 'where', 'instant', 'possible', 'lose', 'everything', 'Mahoney', 'so', 'compulsive', 'randomly', 'home', 'teams', 'underdogs', 'etc', 'Even', 'bookie', 'appalled', 'not', 'activity', 'endgame', 'juice', 'next', 'bet', 'true', 'addiction', 'only', 'point', 'doing', 'doing', 'more.Everything', 'movie', 'construction', 'purity', 'addiction', 'always', 'first', 'Mahowny', 'car', 'so', 'beat', 'parking', 'lot', 'attendant', 'fun', 'Mahowny', 'unmade', 'bed', 'ill-fitting', 'clothes', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'body', 'language', 'screams', 'Property', 'Condemned', 'Keep', 'Out', 'Mahowny', 'never', 'eye', 'contact', 'obviously', 'content', 'live', 'isolation', 'kind', 'addiction', 'girlfriend', 'Belinda', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'very', 'embodiment', 'codependence', 'nice', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'elsewhere', 'yet', 'learn', 'loving', 'addict', 'least', 'being', 'loved', 'one', 'impossibility.The', 'movie', 'not', 'irony', 'Mahowny', 'bipolar', 'life', 'bank', 'gambling', 'one', 'other', 'banking', 'world', 'one', 'assumes', 'money', 'handled', 'responsibly', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'watch', 'bank', 'officials', 'discuss', 'how', 'manipulate', 'star', 'clients', 'extending', 'debt', 'unsafe', 'territory', 'How', 'different', 'wonder', 'blatant', 'bloodsucking', 'casino', 'manager', 'Victor', 'Foss', 'John', 'Hurt', 'portrayal', 'Foss', 'actually', 'Hoffman', 'perfection', 'Foss', 'trick', 'part', 'fool', 'money', 'quickly', 'Mahowny', 'ordinary', 'fool', 'perfect', 'fool', 'single-mindedly', 'focused', 'addiction', 'temptations', 'sure', 'manipulate', 'mere', 'mortals', 'can', 'not', 'distract', 'Powerful', 'voodoo']",N/A

771639,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,B0000BXMZ8,"cs211 ""cs211""","[2, 4]","The movie (""based"" on a true story - how much of it is real, and how much is invented?) portrays the descent of Dan Mahoney, an obsessive gambler who, like all of us, has ""a public life, a private life, and a secret life"".Dan's public life is that of a mid-level account manager at a Toronto bank, which gives him access to money he skims and shuffles around from his clients, in order to feed his gambling habit. In his private life, he is dating a rather simple-minded fellow bank employee. And in his secret life, Dan jets off to Atlantic City and Las Vegas, wagering and eventually always losing millions of dollars. His addiction is such that his secret life eventually subsumes his other lives, although (according to the epilogue) not fatally.One of the problems with this movie is the persona of Dan Mahoney. Evidently, remaining true to the original, Dan is an introverted, uncommunicative, shy, tradition-oriented Canadian of reserved British nature. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a very good performance as Dan, conveying his emotion in a very subtle, controlled manner. However, it does not create much opportunity for exploring Dan's inner thoughts and motivations - these must be surmised by the viewer. Additionally, the director chose to tell Dan's story in a very straightforward manner, rather than employing some of the more powerful tools of cinema (symbolism, flashbacks, alternative viewpoints, etc.). Yes, there is a scene of Dan witnessing a high-roller that is later repeated, this time with Dan as the high roller, and at another point Dan thinks he sees himself watching him gamble, but for the most part the film proceeds in a documentary-like fashion.The best performance is delivered by John Hurt, as a Satan-like Atlantic City casino boss. However, Minnie Driver's character of Belinda, Dan's girlfriend, is one-dimensional and is never developed.The film does trigger thoughts about the nature of addiction (from both sides, the addict and the enabler), as well as what people do when they are in a situation well over their heads. In the case of someone like Dan Mahoney, they just cannot stop. Hopefully, this will inspire the rest of us to exercise more self-control, before the police are forced to act.",3,"Fairly straightforward, predictable; a few good performances",1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,2238,"['movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'invented', 'descent', 'Dan', 'Mahoney', 'obsessive', 'gambler', 'who', 'public', 'life', 'private', 'life', 'secret', 'life', '.Dan', 'public', 'life', 'mid-level', 'account', 'manager', 'Toronto', 'bank', 'access', 'money', 'shuffles', 'clients', 'order', 'feed', 'gambling', 'habit', 'private', 'life', 'dating', 'rather', 'simple-minded', 'fellow', 'bank', 'employee', 'secret', 'life', 'Dan', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wagering', 'eventually', 'always', 'losing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'addiction', 'such', 'secret', 'life', 'eventually', 'other', 'lives', 'according', 'epilogue', 'not', 'fatally.One', 'problems', 'movie', 'persona', 'Dan', 'Mahoney', 'Evidently', 'remaining', 'true', 'original', 'Dan', 'introverted', 'uncommunicative', 'shy', 'tradition-oriented', 'Canadian', 'reserved', 'British', 'nature', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Dan', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'very', 'subtle', 'controlled', 'manner', 'However', 'not', 'create', 'much', 'opportunity', 'exploring', 'Dan', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'motivations', 'must', 'be', 'surmised', 'viewer', 'Additionally', 'director', 'chose', 'tell', 'Dan', 'story', 'very', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'rather', 'employing', 'more', 'powerful', 'tools', 'cinema', 'symbolism', 'flashbacks', 'alternative', 'viewpoints', 'etc.', 'Yes', 'scene', 'Dan', 'witnessing', 'high-roller', 'later', 'repeated', 'time', 'Dan', 'high', 'roller', 'point', 'Dan', 'watching', 'gamble', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'proceeds', 'documentary-like', 'fashion.The', 'best', 'performance', 'delivered', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Satan-like', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'casino', 'boss', 'However', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'Belinda', 'Dan', 'girlfriend', 'one-dimensional', 'never', 'developed.The', 'film', 'trigger', 'thoughts', 'nature', 'addiction', 'sides', 'addict', 'enabler', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'situation', 'well', 'heads', 'case', 'someone', 'Dan', 'Mahoney', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'inspire', 'rest', 'exercise', 'more', 'self-control', 'police', 'are', 'forced', 'act']",N/A
771640,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B0000BXMZ8,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[2, 7]","Owning Mahowny is in many ways a hilarious film.  You will find yourself constantly laughing even though it might make you feel guilty.  One can readily imagine the late Dudley Moore or Peter Sellers portraying Dan Mahowny in a light hearted manner.  Unfortunately, this story is based on the true story of a Canadian banker of the 1980s who recklessly gambled using his own employer's money.  Philip Seymour Hoffman once again proves that he among our greatest film actors. He brilliantly portrays Mahowny as a worldly sophisticated and well educated man who is unable to rationally come to grips with his ultimately doomed lifestyle.  The normally very sensible Mahowny refuses to concede that the odds are enormously against him.  It's only a question when the train wreck will occur, not if.  Those around him wrongly conclude that Mahowny's old beat up car and shabby clothes depict a prudent attitude unwilling to take unnecessary risks.  The bank officers cannot imagine him as anything but a straight arrow and dedicated junior executive.  Mahowny's wife Belinda (Minnie Driver) also has absolutely no idea that he is a obsessed gambler.  In one scene she naively asks if her modest savings of $5,000 might help Mahowny get out of debt.  It slowly dawns on Belinda that her husband might be hopelessly in trouble.Dan Mahowny travels to Atlantic City to so some serious gambling.  How serious?  He soon becomes a favorite to the manipulative casino general manager, Victor Foss (John Hurt), who does nothing to discourage him from casually placing $70,000 a hand bets!  Mahowny knows that he is being played for a sucker.  However, he lacks the will power to say no.  Lastly, parents of teenagers should make sure that their siblings view Owning Mahowny.  They should not get overly concerned by the R rating resulting from the brief nude scenes and vulgar language.  I strong believe that it's more important that youngsters learn early on that gambling addicts are to be pitied and not emulated.  No sane individual will look upon the loser Dan Mahowny as a role model.",5,Mahowny would be a delightful comedy if it were fictional,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,2078,"['Owning', 'Mahowny', 'many', 'ways', 'hilarious', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'constantly', 'laughing', 'even', 'might', 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'One', 'can', 'readily', 'imagine', 'late', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'portraying', 'Dan', 'Mahowny', 'light', 'hearted', 'manner', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Canadian', 'banker', '1980s', 'who', 'recklessly', 'gambled', 'using', 'own', 'employer', 'money', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'once', 'again', 'greatest', 'film', 'actors', 'brilliantly', 'Mahowny', 'worldly', 'sophisticated', 'well', 'educated', 'man', 'who', 'unable', 'rationally', 'come', 'grips', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'lifestyle', 'normally', 'very', 'sensible', 'Mahowny', 'concede', 'odds', 'are', 'enormously', 'only', 'question', 'when', 'train', 'wreck', 'will', 'occur', 'not', 'wrongly', 'conclude', 'Mahowny', 'old', 'beat', 'up', 'car', 'shabby', 'clothes', 'depict', 'prudent', 'attitude', 'unwilling', 'take', 'unnecessary', 'risks', 'bank', 'officers', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anything', 'straight', 'arrow', 'dedicated', 'junior', 'executive', 'Mahowny', 'wife', 'Belinda', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'also', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'obsessed', 'gambler', 'one', 'scene', 'naively', 'modest', 'savings', '5,000', 'might', 'help', 'Mahowny', 'get', 'debt', 'slowly', 'Belinda', 'husband', 'might', 'be', 'hopelessly', 'trouble.Dan', 'Mahowny', 'travels', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'so', 'serious', 'gambling', 'How', 'serious', 'soon', 'favorite', 'manipulative', 'casino', 'general', 'manager', 'Victor', 'Foss', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'nothing', 'discourage', 'casually', 'placing', '70,000', 'hand', 'bets', 'Mahowny', 'being', 'played', 'sucker', 'However', 'will', 'power', 'say', 'Lastly', 'parents', 'teenagers', 'should', 'make', 'sure', 'siblings', 'view', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'overly', 'concerned', 'R', 'rating', 'resulting', 'brief', 'nude', 'scenes', 'vulgar', 'language', 'strong', 'believe', 'more', 'important', 'youngsters', 'learn', 'early', 'gambling', 'addicts', 'are', 'be', 'pitied', 'not', 'emulated', 'sane', 'individual', 'will', 'look', 'loser', 'Dan', 'Mahowny', 'role', 'model']",N/A

The story is based on a true story about a gambling addicted loan officer who ""loans"" himself some of the bank's money to support his habit.  In life, he's a nobody.  He wouldn't be noticed by anyone.  But with the bank's money and his penchant for losing big, he becomes somewhat of a VIP in the casino he frequents.  It's amusing to watch him walk into the casino and have everyone make a big deal over him.  He gets nice suites and meals compliments of the casino, but does not seem interested in either.  He's there for the thrill of gambling.  As you watch the movie, you see that his situation becomes out of hand.  How could it not?  Mahowny loses.  He never comes home a winner.  At one point Mahowny seems to be in the verge of turning things around for himself.  He even somehow is able to find a woman (Minnie Driver) who wants to be with him.  But gambling always wins out.Hoffman's portrayal is even keeled and never seems over the top.  As a matter of fact, there isn't much to his character.  It's difficult to determine whether or not you like him.  For me, that's the weak part of the movie.  The movie's main character is bland and ordinary.  What he does is anything but ordinary, but that isn't enough to carry the movie.  In real life, things may be just like we see them here.  A one hour documentary on the true story would have been just as satisfying. I would have liked to have seen a little more put into Hoffman's character.  Ordinary is fine in real life, but I want to see interesting people when I watch a movie.  This movie is worth watching.

771645,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B0000BXMZ8,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[0, 1]","Philip Seymour Hoffman is truly one of the finest actors of this generation. I've been mesmerized by him ever since I saw him in the otherwise-dismal Twister (yes, Twister), where his was the only standout performance. In the years since, he has turned in many memorable performances including Brant in The Big Lebowski, Allen in Happiness, and Lester Bangs in Almost Famous. In the past year or two his status has risen even more, and he's gotten bigger and juicier parts. He appeared in the big-time Hollywood movie Red Dragon, a brief but memorable part in P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love, Spike Lee's 25th Hour and his biggest role to  date in the underrated Love Liza.Now, Phil Hoffman gets another juicy role to show off his acting chops in Richard Kwietniowski's Owning Mahowny, a portrait of a compulsive gambler that is based on a true story. Hoffman plays Dan Mahowny, a Canadian bank employee who is so helplessly addicted to gambling that his entire life soon revolves around it. He manages to swindle his bank out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and head to Atlantic City to indulge his passion. In the process he endangers his relationship with his girlfriend Belinda (played by a nearly-unrecognizable Minnie Driver), but begins a new relationship of sorts with casino boss Victor Foss (a suave John Hurt).Owning Mahowny is similar to other movies of this sort (It sort of reminded me of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can) and it's simple and straightforward. There are really no surprises to be found, it pretty much stays close to the facts of the true story. It's really not about plot, or even story, however. It's about one man's descent into addiction, gambling in this case, and how he is nearly destroyed by it and how he hurts others by it. The script and direction are unremarkable; it's Hoffman that makes the film worthwhile. His performance is harrowing and mesmerizing. Without speaking a word, he can convey unimaginable sorrow and frustration. In fact, Hoffman is at his best when he's silent. With mere movements he creates memorably pitiable characters. Sort of ironic that one of the most gifted actors of our time establishes himself by playing afflicted losers.For fans of Philip S. Hoffman, Owning Mahowny is a must-see. His performance carries the film and gives it its weight. For general audiences, the film may be unbearably slow and uninteresting. I can't wait to see what Phil does next.",4,Phil Hoffman is excellent as always,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,2433,"['Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'truly', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mesmerized', 'ever', 'saw', 'otherwise-dismal', 'Twister', 'yes', 'Twister', 'where', 'was', 'only', 'standout', 'performance', 'years', 'turned', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'including', 'Brant', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Allen', 'Happiness', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'status', 'risen', 'even', 'more', 'gotten', 'bigger', 'juicier', 'parts', 'appeared', 'big-time', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'brief', 'memorable', 'part', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'Spike', 'Lee', '25th', 'Hour', 'biggest', 'role', 'date', 'underrated', 'Love', 'Liza.Now', 'Phil', 'Hoffman', 'juicy', 'role', 'show', 'off', 'acting', 'chops', 'Richard', 'Kwietniowski', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'portrait', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Hoffman', 'Dan', 'Mahowny', 'Canadian', 'bank', 'employee', 'who', 'so', 'helplessly', 'addicted', 'gambling', 'entire', 'life', 'soon', 'swindle', 'bank', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'head', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'indulge', 'passion', 'process', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Belinda', 'played', 'nearly-unrecognizable', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'new', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'casino', 'boss', 'Victor', 'Foss', 'suave', 'John', 'Hurt', '.Owning', 'Mahowny', 'similar', 'other', 'movies', 'sort', 'sort', 'reminded', 'Spielberg', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'are', 'really', 'surprises', 'be', 'found', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'close', 'facts', 'true', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'plot', 'even', 'story', 'however', 'one', 'man', 'descent', 'addiction', 'gambling', 'case', 'how', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'how', 'others', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'unremarkable', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'performance', 'harrowing', 'mesmerizing', 'speaking', 'word', 'can', 'convey', 'unimaginable', 'sorrow', 'frustration', 'fact', 'Hoffman', 'best', 'when', 'silent', 'mere', 'movements', 'memorably', 'pitiable', 'characters', 'Sort', 'ironic', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'actors', 'time', 'playing', 'afflicted', 'losers.For', 'fans', 'Philip', 'S.', 'Hoffman', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'must-see', 'performance', 'film', 'weight', 'general', 'audiences', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'unbearably', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Phil', 'next']",N/A

I do not rent or see lots of movies anymore, largely due to the flashy, tabloid-fodder being churned out by Hollywood studios these days (curiously, who are all strangely confused why box office receipts keep dropping year-after-year).I very much like Owning Mahowny, and will be buying a copy.  I have a bias towards factual, documentary-style accounts which is part of the reason I like it.  But it carries a sober (if unintentional) message to it.  I agree with the reviewer who said this should be required viewing before any trip to Vegas.  Maybe for stock and options traders too.The setting of the early 80's is quite convincing, and I found it nostalgic to see the hairstyles, the cars, even the CDN $50 and $100 bills being counted in the opening credits.  The character Dan Mahowny is indeed an ""unexciting guy"" who speaks in a monotone...that's part of the character, as Philip Seymour Hoffman faithfully reproduced after speaking for hours with the real Brian Molony, whose name was changed slightly for the movie's title owing to privacy concerns.  Therein lies much of the movie's appeal.  This is truly an average guy who did something stunning.  Combine this with the movie's matter-of-factual attention to small details, and you suddenly feel like you're there, in 1981, watching this man implode before your very eyes.If you prefer an Angelina Jolie bad girl, or Uma Thurman dressed up in a yellow suit with a sword, or Will Smith punching-out an alien from the cockpit of an F-16, you're in luck.

771652,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000BXMZ8,Joseph Haschka,"[0, 0]","Like William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman might not fit the usual preconception of cinematic Leading Man. Yet, in 2003, both have the lead in movies about gambling or the gambling industry. For Macy, it was THE COOLER; for Hoffman, it was OWNING MAHOWNY. In their respective films, the character portrayed by each loses his job because he's either embraced or shunned by Lady Luck.In OWNING MAHOWNY, based on a true story, Hoffman is cast in the title role as the high ranking executive in charge of loans for a Toronto bank. Mahowny also has a gambling addiction, and is indebted to his bookie (Maury Chakin) for slightly over ten grand. To cover his marker, Mahowny creates a fictional loan account, and draws cash from it. Going a step further, he approves cash loans to an existing but unsuspecting customer with a large credit limit, and takes the money on weekend trips to Atlantic City, where he consistently loses at dice, cards, and roulette. By the time he's found out, Mahowny has embezzled over $10 million.The creators of this film made no attempt whatsoever to render the Mahowny persona attractive to the audience, and it's a wonder he even has a fiancee, Lisa (Minnie Driver). Indeed, Mahowny is so focused on gambling that when the casino manager, Mr. Foss (John Hurt), sends to his suite a complimentary courtesan, who sheds her fur coat to reveal not inconsiderable charms, Mahowny only tells her &quot;You've made a mistake.&quot; And he really means it; he only courts Lady Luck. Our hero is so indifferent to anything other than playing the odds that he isn't even somebody with whom you'd consider having a friendly beer. He's single-minded to the point of boorishness.One can't help but make the comparison between Foss and Shelly Kaplow, the manager of the Shangri-La Casino in THE COOLER. Alec Baldwin received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the latter role, and should have been, I think, the rightful winner of the award. Both Foss and Kaplow are control freaks. But, while Foss is almost coldly clinical in his manipulation of the high rollers that keep his house profitable, Kaplow is a tempestuous character capable of deep emotions, including a volcanic anger that can erupt into shocking violence. Compared to Kaplow, Foss is almost prissy. Baldwin had the meatier and more complex role, though Hurt's performance is excellent.Films about the sickness of obsessive gambling are few and far between. I haven't seen one as effective as OWNING MAHOWNY since the 1974 movie THE GAMBLER starring James Caan. Though OWNING MAHOWNY is perhaps an art house film not likely to appeal to a wide audience, it gets its message across superbly.

771654,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0000BXMZ8,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[1, 2]","Oceans Eleven? The Italian Job? The Usual Suspects? Yes, these were all very good films about one of hollywood's favorite subjects - the confidence scheme. And they all have something else in common - a bit too much glitz with a bit too little realism.That's where ""Owning Mahowny"" comes in. Based on the true story of a gambling-addicted Canadian banker who finds a way to play the bank's money against the casino's, ""Owning Mahowney"" is nothing if not focused on realism. As another reviewer noted, the drama is as much about the con as it is about the man behind it; equally about the game and the player. Whereas most con films concern themselves with wowing audiences with fast action and glitzy characters, ""Owning Mahowny"" is about an average guy who gets into a situation that quickly snowballs away from him.I can't say, as others do, that the acting was terribly phenomenal. It was certainly good, but nothing that blew me away. Philip Seymour Hoffman (our main character) has played the downtrodden, depressed, man often, and not shockingly, he does it here again. Minnie Driver, who plays Mahowny's disappointed but faithful, girlfriend, is decent and believable but that's about it. Again, nothing to blow me away, but enough for it to feel 'just right.'But when all is said and done, this film is less about acting and more about the dialogue and direction, which are both superb. The story line and characters have much realistic depth. The plot is intriguing but never over-the-top (as many con films can be).

And this 2003 film based on a true story certainly proves it.  He's cast as Dan Mahowny, an unassuming bank employee in Toronto.  Dan has a gambling problem - a big one.  And when he is pressed to cover his losses of about $10,000 at the track, he uses his job as assistant manager at the bank to embezzle the money.  Then, once he realizes how easy this is, he siphons off some more cash and heads down to Atlantic City.  His habit escalates as does his crimes and soon he's carrying bankrolls of $500,000 or more and losing it all in frenzied weekends.  His girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver is confused and tries to help him.  The casino owner, played by John Hurt, gives him lots of perks and tries to separate him from more and more cash.  Dan Mahowny's life becomes increasingly complicated and within a few months he has stolen $10.2 million from his bank.The story is paced so that it all seems possible.  We see the gambler at his trade and way the habit takes hold of him.  He plays all the casino games and, even when he might be ahead for a while, will always throw his winnings back on the tables.  I found myself feeling sorry for the man and loving him at the same time.  His performance comes across as so real and immediate that I just wanted to put my hands on his shoulders and shake him into reality.  The sense of place is perfect too.  The world of the casinos compared with the world of the quiet bank is an excellent contrast.  Through it all he remains an unassuming nice guy and it's easy to see why his girlfriend is willing to stay with him. I really loved this simple story and feel it is one of the most excellent films ever made about compulsive gambling.  Highly recommended.",5,Gambling habit takes hold of a nice guy.

He'll place bets on anything, even teams he's never heard of in sports he doesn't know. When his  debts to a local bookie threaten to shut down his credit line, Dan turns to the obvious source of funds: the bank. He forges business loan applications, borrows on his clients' credit lines, and strings it along by covering the activity on those accounts with bearer bonds drawn on false accounts. This shell game provides Dan with enough cash to win and lose very high stakes at casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But it's only a matter of time before phantom clients, overdrawn accounts, and missing money catch up with him.""Owning Mahowny"" is based on a book called ""No Limit"" (or alternatively, ""Stung"") written by Gary Ross about Canada's notorious gambling man, Brian Molony. Brian Molony served 6 years in prison for fraud after he used his position as assistant manager in a Toronto bank to defraud the bank of $10 million in order to fund his gambling addiction, between 1980 and 1982. This true story has been admirably adapted for the screen. The details of Mahowny's financial slight-of-hand could easily bog the narrative down. But the film concentrates on creating a compelling character study of a smart man who stupidly and compulsively gambles for its own sake without even regard for winning or losing. Director Richard Kwietniowski effectively uses images to contrast the subcultures of the bank and the casino and to make them seem like self-contained worlds which both revolve around money, in spite of their considerable differences. Without being told, we get a strong impression that banks run strictly according to the clock, whereas time doesn't exist in casinos. Cinematographer Oliver Curtis impresses by giving the edges of his images so much attention. I was struck by how well he uses the entire frame to communicate. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives another fine performance, which will probably prove to be one of the year's best. Minnie Driver and John Hurt are also memorable as Dan's girlfriend and the manager of an Atlantic City casino, respectively. Insight into competition between Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos is a detail which I particularly enjoyed, and, true to form, it is revealed through the emotions of the characters. ""Owning Mahowny"" is one of the best films I've seen in 2003. Every scene, every shot, and every piece of dialogue are perfectly chosen and executed.

Hoffman is a character actor and I'm sure that before undertaking this role, he would have studied the real Mahowny intensely.  Other than Hoffman, there's Paul Giacamatti that came to my mind who's also as versatile as he is.  The premise of the movie is to bring to light how any ordinary persons would get addicted to something so strongly and yet, there are the casinos who would try their best to reap every cents out of the pathological gamblers.  This movie really brings to light that with given power, authorities such as the casinos should act responsibly for to well-being of their clients rather than minding for their bottomlines simply.  John Hurt was also simply brilliant as the conniving and manipulative casino's boss whilst Minnie Driver was just as effective playing Mahowny's soon-to-be-wed girlfriend, who believed in her man in totality but didn't know the extent Mahawny had dug his hole that he couldn't come out from.

771662,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000BXMZ8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Owning Mahowny (James Kwietnowski, 2003)There is a scene at almost the exact halfway point of Owning Mahowny that sums the film up perfectly. Dan Mahowny (the great Philip Seymour Hoffman) is standing in the shower, having just gotten back from a jaunt in Atlantic City where he lost half a million dollars. His girlfriend Belinda (Minnie Driver) confronts him with her suspicions that he has a gambling problem. He says to her, ""I don't have a gambling problem. I have... a financial problem."" It makes perfect sense in the framework, but when hearing it, you have no idea if Mahowny is lying to cover up his problem or whether he's truly too delusional to see what's happening to him. This question is not answered until the film's final scene-- and when it is, it's an incredible sucker punch, the kind of thing you see coming, but you're too fascinated by the death and destruction laid out before you to even think about avoiding. And that's what makes this film so compelling, despite the fact that, well, it's not.Yes, I know, that makes no sense. But that's how I kept feeling about it. I would watch for a while, then wonder whether anything was ever actually going to happen, and realize that forty-five minutes had passed. I'd wonder when the incredible stable of actors Kwietnowski recruited for this movie were going to start living up to their potential, and then the movie would pop up with a scene like the one I mention at the beginning. And, of course, there are things like unanswered questions you don't think you'll ever get the answers to.The plot is simple: Dan Mahowny, a bank executive with a small gambling problem suddenly finds himself in charge of an account where he will have virtually unlimited access to millions of dollars. Hilarity ensues, in a brutally tragic sort of way. While Mahowny continues living his hand-to-mouth life in his native Canada, in Atlantic City he's one of the kings, the high rollers who get armed escorts through the casino, has a personal, first-name relationship with the owner (John Hurt) and a hotel employee whose entire job is to cater to his every whim (Chris Collins). Needless to say, his two lives have to catch up with one another eventually.I'm of two minds about the movie, and like the character of Dan Mahowny himself, I can't be sure whether it's duplicitous or simply thoughtless. I look back on the movie without thinking much of it-- it kind of fades into the background, like Mahowny himself-- but I remember being absorbed without realizing I was being absorbed. I remember glimpses of greatness, single lines that worked well, great performances from minor characters. But I have to work to remember them. And on one level, this is sheer genius, this idea that the film reflects its focus (in some ways, Owning Mahowny is the epitome of McLuhan's famous charge that ""the medium is the message"").

Zwick,"[14, 15]","""Some folks believe that everyone has a public life, a private life and a secret life.""These are the opening words of ""Owning Mahowny,"" a fascinating real-life tale of a compulsive gambler whose life falls to pieces when he begins embezzling funds from the bank where he works in order to feed his obsession.  Dan Mahowny's ""secret life"" became public in the early 1980's when he was finally arrested and convicted on charges of bank theft.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has made a career out of playing sad sack, tormented souls, gives one of his richest performances to date as Mahowny, a mild-mannered man caught in the grip of that compulsive sickness known as gambling addiction.  Minnie Driver plays his devoted girlfriend who loves Dan dearly but who cannot bear to stand by and watch helplessly as he slowly but inexorably destroys his life.If the film were only about Mahowny's gambling problem, it would be no different from countless TV movies made on the same subject.  What sets this film apart is the way in which writer Maurice Chauvet (working off the original novel by Gary Stephen Ross) and director Richard Kwietniowski make the background of the story as compelling as the foreground.  The astute, observant script focuses as much on the ins and outs of the casino and gambling worlds as it does on the personal travails of its main character.  Particularly intriguing is the way in which high rollers are followed and coddled by the casino owners using both high tech equipment like cameras and monitors as well as plain old-fashioned flattery, obsequiousness and deceit.  John Hurt, in a brilliant performance, plays a smarmy casino operator in Atlantic City who will stop at nothing to make Mahowny feel at home in his establishment - all for the purpose of having his new found ""friend"" gamble away a fortune at his tables, of course.  The film is, in fact, filled with interesting side characters, including a sympathetic bellhop, who befriends Dan and who tries to convince him to leave the casino he happens to work for; several of the petty loan sharks with whom Dan finds himself inextricably connected; and a whole host of law enforcement officials whose job it is to bring Dan in on grand theft felony charges.The filmmakers have taken a laid back, subtle approach to their material.  They allow the story to develop slowly, offering us the chance to get to know Mahowny and his world at an unhurried, leisurely pace.  Since Mahowny is, himself, such a secretive, quiet character, it is appropriate that the film that bears his name should also reflect that quality of muted sadness in its pacing and tone.  Towards the end, however, once the authorities begin moving in for the kill and we sense the inevitable grip of Fate tightening around this strangely likable character, the film becomes both highly suspenseful and immensely moving at one and the same time.  What's fascinating is that we are always one step ahead of Mahowny in our understanding of what is about to befall him.  As in all great tragedies, it is the Cassandra-like burden placed on the audience - that of being able to see the future with no hope of doing anything to prevent it - that gives the film its air of pervasive sadness.""Owning Mahowny"" is a beautifully written, directed and acted film that opens up for us a strange and fascinating world.",4,sad and haunting,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,3354,"['folks', 'believe', 'everyone', 'public', 'life', 'private', 'life', 'secret', 'life', 'are', 'opening', 'words', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'fascinating', 'real-life', 'tale', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'life', 'pieces', 'when', 'embezzling', 'funds', 'bank', 'where', 'order', 'feed', 'obsession', 'Dan', 'Mahowny', 'secret', 'life', 'became', 'public', 'early', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'arrested', 'convicted', 'charges', 'bank', 'theft', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'sad', 'sack', 'tormented', 'souls', 'one', 'richest', 'performances', 'date', 'Mahowny', 'mild-mannered', 'man', 'caught', 'grip', 'compulsive', 'sickness', 'known', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'devoted', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'Dan', 'dearly', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'stand', 'watch', 'helplessly', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'life.If', 'film', 'were', 'only', 'Mahowny', 'gambling', 'problem', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'countless', 'TV', 'movies', 'made', 'same', 'subject', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'way', 'writer', 'Maurice', 'Chauvet', 'working', 'off', 'original', 'novel', 'Gary', 'Stephen', 'Ross', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kwietniowski', 'make', 'background', 'story', 'as', 'compelling', 'foreground', 'astute', 'observant', 'script', 'as', 'much', 'ins', 'outs', 'casino', 'gambling', 'worlds', 'personal', 'travails', 'main', 'character', 'Particularly', 'intriguing', 'way', 'high', 'rollers', 'are', 'followed', 'coddled', 'casino', 'owners', 'using', 'high', 'tech', 'equipment', 'cameras', 'monitors', 'as', 'well', 'plain', 'old-fashioned', 'flattery', 'obsequiousness', 'deceit', 'John', 'Hurt', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'smarmy', 'casino', 'operator', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'make', 'Mahowny', 'feel', 'home', 'establishment', 'purpose', 'having', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'gamble', 'away', 'fortune', 'tables', 'course', 'film', 'fact', 'filled', 'interesting', 'side', 'characters', 'including', 'sympathetic', 'bellhop', 'who', 'Dan', 'who', 'convince', 'leave', 'casino', 'work', 'several', 'petty', 'loan', 'sharks', 'whom', 'Dan', 'inextricably', 'connected', 'whole', 'host', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'job', 'bring', 'Dan', 'grand', 'theft', 'felony', 'charges.The', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'taken', 'laid', 'back', 'subtle', 'approach', 'material', 'allow', 'story', 'develop', 'slowly', 'offering', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'Mahowny', 'world', 'unhurried', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Mahowny', 'secretive', 'quiet', 'character', 'appropriate', 'film', 'name', 'should', 'also', 'reflect', 'quality', 'muted', 'sadness', 'pacing', 'tone', 'end', 'however', 'once', 'authorities', 'begin', 'moving', 'kill', 'sense', 'inevitable', 'grip', 'Fate', 'tightening', 'around', 'strangely', 'likable', 'character', 'film', 'highly', 'suspenseful', 'immensely', 'moving', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'What', 'fascinating', 'are', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Mahowny', 'understanding', 'what', 'about', 'befall', 'great', 'tragedies', 'Cassandra-like', 'burden', 'placed', 'audience', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'future', 'hope', 'doing', 'anything', 'prevent', 'film', 'air', 'pervasive', 'sadness', 'Owning', 'Mahowny', 'beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'film', 'up', 'strange', 'fascinating', 'world']",N/A

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[2, 2]","Set in Toronto, Canada during the early 1980's OWNING MAHOWNY is an engrossing and interesting character study of Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who embezzles money from his job as an assistant bank manager in order to feed his increasing gambling addiction. Although Dan recently received a prestigious promotion and moved in with his girlfriend his full attention is focused on the next bet. He essentially lives a double life as he tries to keep his bookies happy while sneaking trips to the Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos to win big. What makes Hoffman's performance admirable is that while at the casinos he retains a tunnel vision on the task in front of him. He is never distracted by the various luxuries (i.e. suites, hookers) that the casino manager's extend to him as an added benefit for being a &quot;good customer&quot;. Throughout the course of this film there is a melancholy and somber atmosphere that further accentuates the desperation and seriousness of Dan's behavior. One can't help to cheer him on even as it becomes apparent that he is digging himself a giant hole for himself. As his gambling deficits continue to spiral out of control he never loses hope that he will come out on top.
