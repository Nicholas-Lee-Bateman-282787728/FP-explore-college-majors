It's so good, in fact, that my normally BBC-hating family took to chanting ""NAN-nies! NAN-nies!"" as soon as I would come home from work.The ""Berkeley Square"" of the title refers to a posh London address where our story unfolds. We quickly (the series is only a ten-parter, after all) get to know three young women: Mattie, just made head-nanny for three, Hannah, single mother desperate for a job, and Lydia, innocent country bumpkin about to get a crash course in the nanny life. The story weaves in and out of their lives with many smaller subplots thrown in, until it makes a compelling tapestry of a time and place gone by.For me the series was at its most interesting with Mattie, wonderfully played by Clare Wilkie. When this proper, straight-laced young woman (nicknamed ""Sarge"" by her brother) falls for ladies' man Ned Jones (very appealing Jason O'Mara), and he for her, the sparks fly. In time a when love was more or less forbidden for a girl in her position, loving a man wanted for murder is a double no-no.The rest of the stories are terrific as well, and a testament to the series' greatness is that there is not a single forgettable character. Everyone, from the Jewish immigrant who helps the destitute Hannah to the Scottish coroner on the screen for a just a few moments, is given witty, articulate dialogue and a story. Many other reviewers complain of the series' shortness, and I agree it could have been tied up better, and gone on longer. But I'm giving it five stars because it's absolutely not to be missed. It won over my family, it'll win over you.GRADE: A",5,"""I love you, and that's scary.""",1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,1699,"['Huge', 'BBC', 'am', 'have', 'say', 'Berkeley', 'Square', 'top', 'five', 'all-time', 'faves', 'period', 'dramas', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'normally', 'BBC-hating', 'family', 'took', 'chanting', 'NAN-nies', 'NAN-nies', 'as', 'soon', 'would', 'come', 'home', 'work.The', 'Berkeley', 'Square', 'title', 'refers', 'posh', 'London', 'address', 'where', 'story', 'unfolds', 'quickly', 'series', 'only', 'ten-parter', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'Mattie', 'just', 'made', 'head-nanny', 'three', 'Hannah', 'single', 'mother', 'desperate', 'job', 'Lydia', 'innocent', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'get', 'crash', 'course', 'nanny', 'life', 'story', 'weaves', 'lives', 'many', 'smaller', 'subplots', 'thrown', 'compelling', 'tapestry', 'time', 'place', 'gone', 'series', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'Mattie', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Clare', 'Wilkie', 'When', 'proper', 'straight-laced', 'young', 'woman', 'nicknamed', 'Sarge', 'brother', 'ladies', 'man', 'Ned', 'Jones', 'very', 'appealing', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'sparks', 'fly', 'time', 'when', 'love', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'forbidden', 'girl', 'position', 'loving', 'man', 'wanted', 'murder', 'double', 'no-no.The', 'rest', 'stories', 'are', 'terrific', 'well', 'testament', 'series', 'greatness', 'not', 'single', 'forgettable', 'character', 'Everyone', 'Jewish', 'immigrant', 'who', 'destitute', 'Hannah', 'Scottish', 'coroner', 'screen', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'given', 'witty', 'articulate', 'dialogue', 'story', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'series', 'shortness', 'agree', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'up', 'better', 'gone', 'longer', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'absolutely', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'won', 'family', ""'ll"", 'win', 'you.GRADE']",N/A

Three nannies from different backgrounds meet and help each other through adventures and travails in London's upper-crust Berkeley Square.While the costumes and setting were interesting, the plot line was pure soap opera.  The various characters' moral decisions and plot lines by no means accurately reflect the end of the Victorian era.

23701,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,0773343032,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[126, 132]","A wonderful 1902 period London Victorian drama. Activity surrounding three nannies in different posh families makes for dialogue and interaction between the classes. It's a shade like ""Upstairs Downstairs"" yet something unique too. Each of the 3 girls: Matty (Claire Wilkie-`Eastenders'),uneducated Lydia (Tabathia Wady-`Doctors' `Sense & Sensibility'), & Hannah (Victoria Smurfit-`Trial and Retribution' `Ballykissangel') have different backgrounds with Hannah perhaps being the most `colorful' having born a child through a relationship with a former Yorkshire upper. The girls become friends as well as soldiers tending the care of those rich youngsters. Of course the activity and lively constitution that the upper class families provide adds to the storyline, making its mark on the nannies hopes and dreams.Britain seems to have a hold on top quality Victorian series. The fact it is a period story makes the series very re-watchable. The settings, costumes, and props are first rate, a standard for British made turn-of the century Victorian tales. This is simply one of those many produced that have and will continue to be sold and watched, like classic Victorian novels.Also to be watched is part-nasty Nanny Collins (Rosemary Leach-many roles, I like ""Titmus Regained' `A Room with a View')and full-nasty Nanny Simmons (Ruth Sheen-'Lorna Doone' 'Vanity Fair') who is the head nanny to the Hutchinson kids where Irish Hannah assists. Ned Jones (Jason O'Mara-`Life on Mars' ""Monarch of the Glen' 2 great series) who is besotted by Matty (aka Sarge) and he sparkles back adding some interesting romance to their lives--and with footman Jones' violent past, tsk, tsk. Expect some intrigue and scandal along with the treks to the park and smiles. This is no ""Mary Poppins"" revival. This is more in line how British Victorian life of the posh as portrayed in the UK, not Disneyland. I like both, so I have no problem swallowing a bit of sour pickle with the sugar plums. Solid drama.

But once the miniseries moved on to the nannies' adventures, the plots became bizarre and disjointed.  There are 3 disks and I watched 2 before I decided that I had had enough.  I don't know if I'll ever watch the rest of this miniseries.  Not only were the storylines confusing but the acting was inferior.

On mine it said it was ""a warm-hearted family drama.""  Whoever wrote that must not have watched it as it is definitely not for children.The acting is great as is typical for a British made drama.  The recreation of the historical period (1902 London) is nicely done.  I did have trouble understanding the dialogue sometimes - not sure if it was the sound quality or the accents.A quote on the case from The Daily Mail: ""The long search for another Upstairs, Downstairs may be over ... with Berkeley Square TV's Holy Grail may have been rediscovered.""  That turned out to be wishful thinking as BS only lasted one season.It follows the lives of three young nannies/nurse maids working in three separate houses.  Other story lines involved members of the upstairs as well as other servants.  The characters, story lines and locations were fine.  The problem for me was the editing.  Instead of having each episode tell a story involving one or a couple of the characters, BS had about 5 story lines ongoing throughout the series.  They would switch back and forth repeatedly.  Some scenes literally lasted only about 10 seconds.  Also there was no sort of cue when transitioning from one story to another.  How about something simple like a fade out/fade in?  It was very hard to keep it all straight.  Which nanny was employed by that lady?  Which house is that housekeeper with?  I didn't see it when/if it originally aired on US television but I can imagine that a lot of people would have given up and tuned out.  It was bad enough watching on dvd where I would watch one or two episodes a night over a period of a week.  Watching it on television once a week must have really been confusing.  The dvd set should definitely come with a scorecard that you could refer to showing a photo and name and separating them into the three houses.By the end of the final episode all the stories were resolved to some extent but new plots evolved out of the old so you are left to imagine how things would have progressed if the series had been renewed.In summary, even with all the shortcomings, I would recommend BS to any Anglophile or lover of period pieces.  A reasonable price would be about 10-15 dollars.  You might need to watch it a couple times to get the most out of it.  I know I enjoyed it more on the second viewing.",4,Good - could have been great,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,2475,"['Berkeley', 'Square', '10', 'episodes', '8+', 'hours', 'special', 'featuresThe', 'current', 'picture', 'apparently', 'newer', 'version', 'what', 'bought', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'mine', 'said', 'was', 'warm-hearted', 'family', 'drama', 'wrote', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'definitely', 'not', 'children.The', 'acting', 'great', 'typical', 'British', 'made', 'drama', 'recreation', 'historical', 'period', '1902', 'London', 'nicely', 'done', 'did', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'sound', 'quality', 'accents.A', 'quote', 'case', 'Daily', 'Mail', 'long', 'search', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'may', 'be', 'Berkeley', 'Square', 'TV', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'rediscovered', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'BS', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season.It', 'lives', 'three', 'young', 'nannies/nurse', 'maids', 'working', 'three', 'separate', 'houses', 'Other', 'story', 'lines', 'involved', 'members', 'upstairs', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'servants', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'locations', 'were', 'fine', 'problem', 'was', 'editing', 'Instead', 'having', 'episode', 'tell', 'story', 'involving', 'one', 'couple', 'characters', 'BS', 'had', '5', 'story', 'lines', 'ongoing', 'series', 'would', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'repeatedly', 'scenes', 'literally', 'lasted', 'only', '10', 'seconds', 'Also', 'was', 'sort', 'cue', 'when', 'transitioning', 'one', 'story', 'How', 'something', 'simple', 'fade', 'out/fade', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'straight', 'Which', 'nanny', 'was', 'employed', 'lady', 'Which', 'house', 'housekeeper', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when/if', 'originally', 'aired', 'US', 'television', 'can', 'imagine', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'tuned', 'out', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'watching', 'dvd', 'where', 'would', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'night', 'period', 'week', 'Watching', 'television', 'once', 'week', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'confusing', 'dvd', 'set', 'should', 'definitely', 'come', 'scorecard', 'could', 'refer', 'showing', 'photo', 'name', 'separating', 'three', 'houses.By', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'stories', 'were', 'resolved', 'extent', 'new', 'plots', 'evolved', 'old', 'are', 'left', 'imagine', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'progressed', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'renewed.In', 'summary', 'even', 'shortcomings', 'would', 'recommend', 'BS', 'Anglophile', 'lover', 'period', 'pieces', 'reasonable', 'price', 'would', 'be', '10-15', 'dollars', 'might', 'need', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'get', 'most', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'second', 'viewing']",N/A

Jeffrey Donahue,"[1, 2]","I am giving this * for the disk quality because of the lack of subtitles, inevitably combined with the usual horrible BBC compressed sound.  The series rates ** overall.  The overall production quality is good, with excellent sets and costumes; however the storyline leaves a lot to be desired.  The last episode seems designed to hastily tie up all the loose ends as if the producers expected to do another series but BBC cancelled it, but that is a minor issue.  There are two large problems with the story, however.  One is that it consistently comes through as preachy, socialist propaganda about the evils of the class system and the potential abuse of power that it entails.  While the evils shown in the series did undoubtedly happen to some people, the truth is that most employers treated their servants reasonably well and that service was considered a good career at the time.  The other problem is that having 3 nannies and 3 households results in a severe lack of character development in most of the other characters besides the nannies themselves.  Characters that could possibly be very intriguing are simply not given enough air time because there are 3 households to deal with, unlike a single household as &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; or &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; portray.  Overall, the preachy tone, lack of character development, and contrived last episode leave you feeling quite empty at the end, even in spite of the fact that visually the series is very pleasing to watch.

It was worth every penny! My sister, who also loves period pieces, came over. Together, we hunkered down and proceeded to watch the entire series in one sitting, all eight and a half hours of it. We were positively riveted to the screen, so engrossing and well-acted is the series.The series centers around three young women, Mattie, Lydia, and Hannah, brought by fate to posh Berkley Square in turn of the twentieth century London. All three work in households where they are employed as nannies. All three meet and become fast friends.Mattie is a an experienced nanny, who was brought up in the tough East End of London and, consequently, is firmly capable of holding her own. She works for a family that is on the unpleasant side with two children, a boy and a girl. The boy is a positive little beast, and the household is run by a crafty and cunning housekeeper. Mattie's benign and pleasant, baby faced countenance, however, belies a will of iron. She most certainly can take care of herself and hold her own with this motley crew.Lydia, the fresh faced and naive country girl, works for a wonderful family, as assistant to a nanny who is like an old family retainer. She watches over the baby, the first child of her employer's second wife, who is an American with modern, egalitarian views. The only blight on her existence, is the grown, handsome son from her employer's first marriage.Hannah has a more unusual history, as she is an unwed mother. She worked as a lady's maid for one of Yorkshire's first families. A love affair with her employer's handsome, only son leads to the birth of their illegitimate son. When her child's father unexpectedly dies, she and her child are forced to flee Yorkshire. She ends up in London, where a chance meeting with Lydia finds her accepting employment in a household in Berkley square, working with the nanny from hell.The series revolves around their experiences and that of the families for whom they work. Over time, the threads of their lives are woven in such a way that they make for an intriguing tapestry of events.

The sets are fine, the attention to Edwardian detail is admirable, the acting so-so but the plots and characters, ah, the meat of it all, are sorely lacking.Let's start w/Lydia, shall we?  A farm girl w/a thick neck and full back shoulders, no couth whatsoever (I don't care if she was raised on a farm.  She doesn't have to behave like a cow.) It seems that every man just can't resist her, especially Lord Hugh played by Nicholas Irons.  He takes advantage of his position and attempts to force himself on her and when she refuses w/a slap and a bite of his hand, he threatens to ruin her family and take away their farm and he's almost successful but, of course, someone steps in to save the day.  Ugh.  Lord Hugh's mother is American, an Amazon of a woman w/thick arms and who marches through every set like a man in combat boots.Then there's Hannah, who had an affair w/her employer, another Lord, who was tragically killed when he was thrown from his horse.  Hannah bore a son to him out of wedlock and after the Lord's death, his mother tried to take the baby from Hannah.  She was unsuccessful but the story that unfolds later is just downright ridiculous.  When she became a nanny in another home, a baby in her superior nanny's charge died from what was believed to be a crib death, later found to be murder.  So genius that Hannah is, she decides to snatch the dead baby and do away w/it and replace it w/her own baby.  Brilliant, eh?  Oh yes, and someone actually unjustly goes to the gallows as a result of all this and at the end of the series, we see Hannah weeping but in agreement w/her young charge that they're ""made of tougher stuff than this.""  If it sounds as though I'm rambling, it's because I am but what can you expect from a plot so heinous and unbelievable?  During your viewing when you come to the episode ""When the Bough Breaks"", do yourself a favor and just eject the DVD and call it a day.Last we have Matty or as her soon-to-be-lover calls her in his thick Cockney accent ""Maa Eee"".  He sounds like Forrest Gump saying ""I love you, Jenny"" except insert the name Maa Eee"" here.  He, Ned, is wanted for murder and although he's innocent, he's too dumb to take action as Maa Eee's brother did in his behalf.  He's later acquitted but goes off to Somali Land in active service.  Such a lovely couple.  Yikes.We mustn't forget the nobility in all this.  Suffice it to say, they're all a bunch of self absorbed twits, one family not even noticing that their child has been swapped for another!  Then there's the family who is so concerned w/raising a son who won't shame them and yet the mother makes it a priority to have an affair while her son is sent off to school at the tender age of 7, all because he accidentally shot his father while he was forced to hunt w/him and his ""macho"" friends.If you can believe Amazon's description, why, this is wonderful family viewing.

23750,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0773343032,Only-A-Child,"[15, 16]","A highly recommended entry in the BBC mini-series genre, ""Berkeley Square"" holds its own with ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""The Pallisers"" and ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Lovers of Victorian/Edwardian-era costume dramas will especially enjoy it. Although it lacks the budget and polish of ""The Grand"", ""Brideshead Revisited"", and ""Duchess of Duke Street"" (and the plot intricacies of ""Upstairs- Downstairs"") it's friendship theme among the three main characters and its mood of subtle nuance more than compensate.I must confess a favorable bias as I was fond of taking my lunch in mid-1970's Berkeley Square during my time in London and have very pleasant associations with the location. It is a real square with houses on all sides of a small park.The mini-series takes place in 1902, a Victorian to Edwardian transitional time begun with the coronation of the new King. Although class differences are a feature of the program the real focus is on three young nannies/nursery-maids just beginning work for three prominent families on the square. This is the strength of the series as the three television actresses are perfectly cast physically for the compare and contrast dynamic that pulls the three parallel story lines together.Mattie (Clare Wilkie) is the only Londoner, a no-nonsense East Ender who has already worked her way up the domestic career ladder. Her brother calls her Sarge because she has always been controlling. The Sinjin family is the most challenging of the three households, the cook and head housekeeper being politically savvy, the nursery maid Pringle being resentful, and Mrs. Sinjin carrying on a turgid flirtation with a slimy officer. This moronic romance is the worst aspect of the entire series. Fortunately Mattie has her own action going with the new footman, their relationship has a high-energy mentally combative quality that holds your interest.Hannah (Victoria Smurfit) just moved from Yorkshire with her baby following the death of her upper class lover. Smurfit is the reason I began watching the series, having really enjoyed her nicely over-the-top performance in ""Bulletproof Monk"". While her Polish landlady minds the baby Hannah lives-in at the Hutchinson household and takes care of young Bertie (Adam Hayes). Their touching scenes together are terrific, the best segments in the series. Since the directing of the other child actors is not especially good, it is likely that Smurfit was responsible for getting such a perfect performance from young Hayes. Her regal look (she reminds me of Fay Masterson) is an asset in this role, as she must convincingly face off against upper class adversaries and she allows just the right amount of hidden strength to surface in these confrontations.Lydia (Tabitha Wady) is a horse-faced country girl who moved to London to escape the trap of the poor farmer. She is there to assist an elderly nanny who first feels threatened but eventually comes to appreciate Lydia's earthy openness, even her immature personality. Once secure in her new household Lydia must confront the reality of being a homely girl with little sincere attentions from men.""Berkeley Square"" has just 10 episodes of about 50 minutes. Unlike ""The Prisoner"" it appears that they intended to produce more and unlike ""Freaks and Geeks"" they did not have adequate advance notice of the early termination.  Although it ends at an obvious season break point (so major stuff is resolved),  there are some loose ends remaining after the last episode. This is not all bad, they stopped before they ran out of ideas and the loose ends make for interesting speculation.The DVD package is minimalist, without any useful special features. The marginal quality of the audio tracks cry out for captions although I don't envy someone trying to transcribe the least audible of this stuff.Bottom line it is a very entertaining series with fast sequencing and nice performances (especially from Smurfit-watch for the scene where they picnic in the country and Lydia becomes jealous of Hannah-Lydia insults her and the reaction shots of Hannah's exasperation are priceless).Then again, what do I know?

The television industry is ran by idiots who's bottom line is making the fast profit. I bought this DVD because it seemed rather interesting and lets face it no one tells a better story than the British writer. I like period pieces and the British seem to be experts in the Victorian and Edwardian era. I learned quite a bit from this mini series. I was not aware that women in the upper ranks of society did not take care of their own children.Also the upper crust would leave thier children for over a year with servants. They were more concerned with their sex lives . The servant was given the brunt of the aristocrat's irresponsibility. I thought ""HOW BARBARIC"". No doubt -this program was a pure soap opera with all of its melodrama but it was well written- well acted and it engaged me but there is o need for a continution because where else could one go with a story line like this.

23753,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,0773343032,Reliable Reviews Too,"[134, 148]","Three girls become nannies in London in 1902. Each works for a different household. The three become friends as they meet in the park with their strollers.The first five episodes of the ten are a pleasant, yet lively pace of intrigue within attractive English homes and parks.The pleasantness gives way to intrigue as the scandals, which have been building, explode in episode six. You find you have been lulled into a soap-opera abounding in sin: fornication, adultery, lying, deceit, manslaughter, seduction, extortion, child endangerment and neglect, to name just a few. The film is far from the ""warm-hearted family drama"" advertised on the cover.It is an enticing film. The story is intriguing. The film balances intrigue with pleasant dialogue; the actors are attractive in attractive costumes; the acting is fine within attractive surroundings. Children are present. All the good characters weakly display some virtue.It is helpful to know that Laudanum is morphine derived from opium mixed with alcohol, sold over-the-counter then, to relieve pain and induce sleep. Doctors knew it was addictive, and deadly in too large a dose.The characters draw you into the soap opera by displaying promising virtue, but then betraying that virtue (moving back and forth). Opposing minds within the same person. Science says that one mind must eventually win out. Red-head, Nanny Hannah Randall opposes child endangerment in one instance, but fails to inform the parents in another instance, who were due informing; and the endangerment continues. Hannah appears to wish to do Right, but fails to consistently act with the resolution of one with single mind to see Right through. The aunt expresses her good moral principles, but later gives way to extortion. The older nanny stands against the bad guy, but later makes a subtle statement justifying the seduction, extortion, and malice. The first half is pleasant, but in the end, a couple of the ""good characters"" have lied and deceived, causing devastating harm to another, taking away all the pleasantness. In the end, you have not experienced a world of cheer, humor, music, singing, fun, and characters to admire.A thoughtful film does not need all the scandal. It is interesting enough with the three girls starting jobs as nannies, as servants, the pretty London parks, difficult bosses, other servants, friendships, the charm and mischief of the children, working at doing a good job, what a good nanny is. Add some fun, humor, music, singing, adventures, and characters coming to values to admire.The lack of many good period films makes this pretty, intriguing, soap opera of technical ability, in which good does not win out, appear desirable. You will enjoy the 8 hours, but be left empty in the end, (Romance without Love). I will not keep it.I recommend these better films: ""Pride and Prejudice-2005, 1996, & 1940"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""North and South"", ""Middlemarch"", ""All Creatures Great and Small"", ""Pollyanna-2002"", ""Heidi"", ""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Under the Greenwood Tree"", and ""Road to Avonlea seasons 1-6"".If you must have a film of intrigue; ""The Way We Live Now"" is far better, because the bad-guys are openly bad from the start. The 5-hour, series has great acting; including a young man wasting his family's money and lying to various girlfriends. If there was not one, very brief, non-graphic, scene of the young-man attempting to rape his girlfriend on a busy street; I would recommend the film.

Three young women from quite different backgrounds go into service as Nannies to three upper-crust households in exclusive, respectable Berkeley Square.  How will they manage?  those who like BBC-style period drama will be glued to the screen as we find out.As upstairs staff and caretakers of the offspring, our girls are in the midst of the family and, of course, ideally placed to observe the family dramas... infidelity, marital discord, and of course the &quot;goings on&quot; among the servants.  This miniseries harks back to the best of the &quot;women's films&quot; of the 30's, with strong, appealing female leads who struggle with all the traditional female burdens: a rigid class hierarchy, Edwardian morality, harsh and unjust employers, and their troublesome, love-hungry charges.We've got everything here:  illegitimate children, forged references, baby-swapping, baby-farming, handsome but none-too-bright young man in trouble with the Law, Dickensian old women with terrifying personalities, dashing young Guardsman angling for wealthy marriage, children made to recite the colours of vanished Regiments before they are given a present, cuckolded husband trying pathetically to keep up appearances, frigidly vicious Society grandes dames, poor little rich boy terrorized by nasty governess, horrid young ne'er-do-well trying to molest the help -- In a word, it's lavishly &quot;dishy&quot; and great fun as our heroines cope with one crisis after another.Period setting and costume seems very consistent and well mounted, and the interiors are delightful (with appropriate soundstage too, a point on which British TV drama used to be a bit weak).  The young actresses are a treat -- nicely cast, charming, true to type, and quite individual -- and the supporting cast is a pleasure.  Some of the minor roles are so well played as  to steal all their scenes (&quot;Mrs B&quot; comes to mind), and if a couple of the characters seem a bit wooden -- well, it is Edwardian, don't you know :-)This is a wonderful boxed set with which to regale yourself and the family (if the children are not too young) on a series of chilly winter nights.

23759,AR1T36GLLAFFX,0773343032,Scott FS,"[4, 4]","I like British films and miniseries quite a lot.  I'm very attracted to the Jane Austen-type of films (I've seen all of those films multiple times).  Berkeley Square is set a century later than Austen, but it shares some of the same elements; women making decisions about who they marry based on love rather than on station in life (mainly), rocky romances and caddish men, and the disadvantage the serving class was to the upper class.  It also highlights the sometimes difficult relationships that evolve between the 'upstairs and downstairs'.The production values of this 500-minute miniseries is simply excellent.  (Though I've seen the outside of the row houses on the putative Berkeley Square before; perhaps in 'House of Elliot' and at least one version of 'Persuasion'.)  The use of film rather than videotape makes for sumptuous colors and the richness of the settings.  (In contrast, many British television series of the time used videotape exclusively, or shot outdoors on film and indoors on videotape.  See 'The Duchess of Duke Street' for an excellent example of this.)The acting is excellent as well.  The three main girls playing the nannies were just so good.  One could identify with all of them, perhaps a bit less so with Victoria Smurfit's character, Hannah, who makes one unbelievable choice in the series, involving her child and one of her charges who has taken a turn for the worse.  It just was unbelievable, and would only happen on television, IMO.I, too, would have liked the series to continue, but I strongly differ with those reviewers here who said the series wasn't tied up at the conclusion of the 10 episodes.  Not true!  Mrs. Bronowski's fate was revealed, Ned Jones had his adventures outlined, and even nanny Simmons showed up in the last episode.As for family viewing, I agree that it probably isn't the best fare for a Christian family to watch, though the themes would be OK for a mid-teen to late-teen person to watch.All-in-all, simply excellent.

For those of you who may find the lack of subtitles annoying, then beware.As you know by now, having read the numerous reviews here at Amazon's, the story centers around the three nannies who work for three different families which resided in London's Berkeley Square in early 1900s.

Firstly, there is pretty but prim, proper and straight-laced young Matty Wickham, the new nanny for Tom and Harriet, the children of the St. John family (pronounced SINjin). However, all is not domestic bliss in the household, as Mrs. St. John (Hermione Norris--Cold Feet's Karen) is busily engaged in an adulterous affair with dashing Captain Mason (who also happens to have an eye on Isabel, the beautiful but empty-headed young niece of the Hutchinson family).The head nanny to the children of the Hutchinsons (consisting of young Bertie and his baby brother Charlie) is cold, nosy, unkindly Nanny Simmons. Her new assistant is a beautiful young Irish woman named Hannah Randall (Victoria Smurfit--Ballykissangel's Orla), a woman whose secrets include an illegitimate baby of her own. Luck (with a little less-than-honest assistance from Hannah!) has landed her the position, but can she keep it under the ever-watchful eye of Nanny Simmons?Finally, there is the Lamson-Scribener family, consisting of the Earl, his young American second-wife and their baby, Ivo, who is the charge of elderly, carmudgeonly, no-nonsense Nanny Collins. Collins' new assistant is a naive-but-good-hearted country girl named Lydia Weston, the daughter of tenant farmers on the Lamson-Scribeners' country estate. Lydia's newfound life is threatened, however, when the Earl's adult son Hugh arrives home.This is an absolutely splendid, thoroughly captivating period drama with plenty of tension and suspense. However, because the story deals with three households and the interplay between them, it is a little more challenging initially to keep track of who is in the employment of whom! As a result, I recommend not having a break of more than a couple of days at most between episodes. (Believe me, you'll find it difficult waiting for the next episode anyway!).The series consists of ten 50-minute episodes, and although the last episode does serve to wrap up each of the stories, we are left with a few kernels which were likely designed to serve as a springboard for a further series of episodes, had one been commissioned. I know I'm not alone in hoping the BBC will someday revive this series (they've done so with many others in the past).In conclusion, I highly recommend this series to all fans of British period productions. Frankly, though, I don't think a penchant for period productions is prerequisite to enjoying this series.

Unfortunately for the nannies, their personal lives often intersect disastrously with that of their wealthy employers.The casting and acting is excellent. The Edwardian fashions reflect the period perfectly, and the ups and downs of the nannies relationships illustrate the class driven society, it's rules, and it's casualties for both the genteel and working class. An enjoyable production, with the only drawback being that the series was cancelled; leaving the last episode hastily packaged up leaving plotlines dangling, and a desire for more that can't be satisfied.",5,"Enjoyable ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" Like Tale",1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1065,"['Berkeley', 'Square', 'Edwardian', 'period', 'piece', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'flavor', 'it.London', 'Berkeley', 'Square', '1800', 'still', 'today', 'was', 'genteel', 'residential', 'area', 'situated', 'central', 'neighborhood', 'park', 'Here', 'where', 'upper', 'class', 'families', 'servants', 'lived', 'lives', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'privacy', 'Berkeley', 'Square', 'centers', 'three', 'nannies', 'difficult', 'task', 'living', 'residence', 'maintaining', 'semblance', 'personal', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'nannies', 'personal', 'lives', 'often', 'intersect', 'disastrously', 'wealthy', 'employers.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Edwardian', 'fashions', 'reflect', 'period', 'perfectly', 'ups', 'downs', 'nannies', 'relationships', 'illustrate', 'class', 'driven', 'society', 'rules', 'casualties', 'genteel', 'working', 'class', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'only', 'drawback', 'being', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'leaving', 'last', 'episode', 'hastily', 'packaged', 'up', 'leaving', 'plotlines', 'dangling', 'desire', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied']",N/A

This BBC drama revolves around the joys and tribulations [more of the latter] of three young nannies in an upper-class neighborhood in London.Lydia Weston [Tabitha Wady] is a young and hardworking poor farm girl [with lots of siblings] from Devon who is recommended for a position in the household of the Earl and Countess Lamson-Scribener. She is hired because the the Countess doubts the old nanny's abilities to take care of her infant son. Hannah Randall [Victoria Smurfit] is a young girl from Ireland who is forced to flee with her infant son after the locals banish her [due to the illegitimacy of her son]. She is hired by the Hutchinson's but is forced to conceal her real circumstances as an unwed mother, leaving him under the care of her landlady. Finally, Matty Wickham [Clare Wilkie] is hired as head Nanny in the St John household. Matty stands for no nonsense and this causes conflicts between her and the other employees of the household. The three girls eventually meet and form a strong bond with each other, sharing in their privations and being a source of comfort to each other.There are altogether 10 excellent episodes. Unfortunately, the series ends abruptly and there has been no sequel made. At the end of the tenth episode, a number of issues remain unresolved and lots of questions unanswered. I have tried looking up info for this series and found no indication of a sequel made or in the process of being made. Very disappointing considering the excellent cast and wonderful attention to period details. The compelling plot and intricate story lines make this a very addictive show and at the end of the final episode, viewers will be left clamoring for more. I'd still recommend this as a must-watch for those who love period dramas and Anglophiles.",5,"Absorbing period drama, marred only by  the lack of a sequel",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1944,"['had', 'actually', 'watched', 'excellent', 'Victorian', 'period', 'drama', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'recently', 're-watched', 'still', 'as', 'riveting', 'remembered', 'BBC', 'drama', 'joys', 'tribulations', '[', 'more', 'latter', ']', 'three', 'young', 'nannies', 'upper-class', 'neighborhood', 'London.Lydia', 'Weston', '[', 'Tabitha', 'Wady', ']', 'young', 'hardworking', 'poor', 'farm', 'girl', '[', 'lots', 'siblings', ']', 'Devon', 'who', 'recommended', 'position', 'household', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'Lamson-Scribener', 'hired', 'Countess', 'old', 'nanny', 'abilities', 'take', 'care', 'infant', 'son', 'Hannah', 'Randall', '[', 'Victoria', 'Smurfit', ']', 'young', 'girl', 'Ireland', 'who', 'forced', 'flee', 'infant', 'son', 'locals', 'banish', '[', 'due', 'illegitimacy', 'son', ']', 'hired', 'Hutchinson', 'forced', 'conceal', 'real', 'circumstances', 'unwed', 'mother', 'leaving', 'care', 'landlady', 'Finally', 'Matty', 'Wickham', '[', 'Clare', 'Wilkie', ']', 'hired', 'head', 'Nanny', 'St', 'John', 'household', 'Matty', 'nonsense', 'conflicts', 'other', 'employees', 'household', 'three', 'girls', 'eventually', 'meet', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'other', 'sharing', 'privations', 'being', 'source', 'comfort', 'are', 'altogether', '10', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'abruptly', 'there', 'been', 'sequel', 'made', 'end', 'tenth', 'episode', 'number', 'issues', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'lots', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'have', 'tried', 'looking', 'up', 'info', 'series', 'found', 'indication', 'sequel', 'made', 'process', 'being', 'made', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'excellent', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'attention', 'period', 'details', 'compelling', 'plot', 'intricate', 'story', 'lines', 'make', 'very', 'addictive', 'show', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'clamoring', 'more', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'must-watch', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'dramas', 'Anglophiles']",N/A
