1640363,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00BW4S87A,Acute Observer,"[20, 24]","Perry Mason Season 9 Volume 1These fifteen TV shows from 1965 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The titles begin with ""The Case of The"". None of these stories are from the novels.""Laughing Lady"";  ""Fatal Fortune"";""Candy Queen"";  ""Cheating Chancellor"".""Impetuous Imp"";  ""Carefree Coronary"";""Hasty Honeymoon"";  ""12th Wildcat"".""Wrathful Wraith"";  ""Runaway Racer"";""Silent Six"";  ""Fugitive Fraulein"".""Baffling Bug"";  ""Golden Girls"";""Bogus Buccaneers"".",5,The Original Courtroom Drama,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2154,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Season', '9', 'Volume', '1These', 'fifteen', 'TV', 'shows', '1965', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'informative', 'tell', 'life', 'not', 'experienced', 'most', 'people', 'books', 'explain', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'films', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'tell', 'ropers', 'rough', 'smooth', 'shadows', 'how', 'evade', 'surveillance', 'avoid', 'leaving', 'back', 'trail', 'questioned', 'legality', 'ethics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'tactics', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'modern', 'legal', 'rules', 'background', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'America', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'today', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'hero', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'founder', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'sought', 'free', 'unjustly', 'convicted', 'Gardner', 'sought', 'use', 'scientific', 'means', 'find', 'guilty', 'rather', 'using', 'hunches', 'alone.The', 'seeming', 'reality', 'stories', 'due', 'part', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'modified', 'TV', 'theme', 'music', 'typical', 'late', '1950s', 'Note', 'style', 'clothing', 'culture', 'ladies', 'wore', 'white', 'gloves', 'People', 'seldom', 'lock', 'doors', 'prices', 'date', 'films', 'One', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'automobiles', 'era', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Note', 'slimness', 'people', 'smoking', 'familiarity', 'pistols', 'Watch', 'how', 'actors', 'express', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'sharpness', 'quality', 'excellent', 'films', 'have', 'higher', 'contrast', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'stories', 'often', 'use', 'misinterpretation', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'Preliminary', 'Hearings', 'often', 'tell', 'law', 'titles', 'begin', 'Case', 'None', 'stories', 'are', 'novels', 'Laughing', 'Lady', 'Fatal', 'Fortune', 'Candy', 'Queen', 'Cheating', 'Chancellor', 'Impetuous', 'Imp', 'Carefree', 'Coronary', 'Hasty', 'Honeymoon', '12th', 'Wildcat', 'Wrathful', 'Wraith', 'Runaway', 'Racer', 'Silent', 'Six', 'Fugitive', 'Fraulein', 'Baffling', 'Bug', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Bogus', 'Buccaneers']",Perry Mason: The Ninth & Final Season - Volume One

They have all aged gracefully and it is nice to see Paul Drake still the consummate private detective and friend, ever faithful secretary Della Street and the fiercely independent Hamilton Burger honorable contemporaries in the courtroom with Perry.  The stories are well acted and it is nice to see stars who have gone to other careers getting their start in this wonderful series.  I was sorry to see Wesley Lau leave but Richard Anderson as Lt. Steve Drumm is a welcome replacement.  But the real enjoyment is seeing Raymond Burr in his signature role of which he has made his own doing the professional job he has always done.  Anybody that longs for the series that were shown in the past that bring back memories of what TV use to be and, sadly, won't be again, will love the memories it brings back.

I am also seeing that several of the episodes are in fact remakes of episodes from earlier seasons.. why was this necessary? Did the writers go on strike? Did they run out of original material? The one I've watched so far, the Impetuous Imp? is a remake of the Negligent nymph.. though the basic story line is very similar.. a girl's rich aunt has died and her uncle is accused of the murder.. this story is very poorly made in comparison to the original episode ... very sub par.

1640384,A32O5FZH994CNY,B00BW4S87A,"G. Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer""","[33, 35]","After nine years the Perry Mason franchise needed a rest. When the series began in the fifties, few shows were in color and the TV movie had yet to be invented. The earliest episodes of the series were often based on actual Earle Stanley Gardner titles, mostly pulp fiction mostly written in the thirties, forties and fifties.By the time the television series ended there were seventy seven Gardner novels and two hundred seventy one television episodes. Each case required Mason, but virtue of courtroom theatrics as Hamilton Burger often put it, not only to get his client off but also to serve the interests of justice by revealing the identity of the true killer who confesses in open court. Gardner had over thirty years to produce his seventy seven novels, the scriptwriters were churning out about thirty episodes a season, three quarters of them original screenplays.Those kind of demands take tolls on the writers, actors and directors. As time went by, the film noir grit and glamour of LA murders presented in grainy black and white began be stretched too far. And so, the final season of this iconic courtroom drama lacks some of the punch that hooked us so thoroughly during the Eisenhower Administration.But this season is the last of the real Perry Mason. Paisanos Productions offered us Monte Markham in the title role of the ""New Perry Mason"" for a season in 1973. That fifteen episode dud, proved to be like ""new Coke"" and swelled the demand for the real thing. Burr and Barbara Hale, as Della Street, returned to make twenty five TV movies between 1986 and 1993. These were two hour jobs ( no original show was ever even a two parter), filmed in color (so much for film noir) and set in Denver.

Perry is not always defending his client in a courtroom - or even in the USA - but so far Raymond Burr is present in all. No guest stars filling in in this volume. Richard Anderson is featured as Detective Lt. Steve Drumm as chief investigator this season. Also Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg is not billed. In season 8 he was billed though the majority of the time he never appeared. The actor was in ill health and finally passed away. It was at Burr's insistence his billing be continued. With that in mind I found it odd this season as in the last that those episodes in which D.A. Hamilton Burger does not appear the actor William Talman is not billed. The magic is still here thus far in season 9. Look for the second half of this final season due for release in August.",5,Strong Beginning To PM's Final CBS-TV Season,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,947,"['writers', 'series', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'counted', 'provide', 'intriguing', 'stories', ""I-didn't-see-that-coming"", 'plot', 'twists', '15', 'episodes', 'continue', 'strong', 'fashion', 'Perry', 'not', 'always', 'defending', 'client', 'courtroom', 'even', 'USA', 'so', 'far', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'present', 'guest', 'filling', 'volume', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'featured', 'Detective', 'Lt.', 'Steve', 'Drumm', 'chief', 'investigator', 'season', 'Also', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'Lt.', 'Tragg', 'not', 'billed', 'season', '8', 'was', 'billed', 'majority', 'time', 'never', 'appeared', 'actor', 'was', 'ill', 'health', 'finally', 'passed', 'away', 'was', 'Burr', 'insistence', 'billing', 'be', 'continued', 'mind', 'found', 'season', 'last', 'episodes', 'D.A', 'Hamilton', 'Burger', 'not', 'appear', 'actor', 'William', 'Talman', 'not', 'billed', 'magic', 'still', 'here', 'thus', 'far', 'season', '9', 'Look', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'season', 'due', 'release', 'August']",Perry Mason: The Ninth & Final Season - Volume One
