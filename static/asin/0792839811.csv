They refuse and tell them it is not due yet. Then Carface uses a magic whistle to control everyone into giving away all the gifts. The evil Belladonna is helping Carface ruin Christmas. With the help of Annabelle and a miracle charm, Charlie and Itchy do their own version of the Christmas Carol story using Carface as the Scrooge. They make him see the ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future as a way of showing him how wrong he is and how he needs to clean up his act. Carface then tries to turn on Belladonna and stop her from ruining Christmas.This is a sweet, cute, and funny movie that I love to watch during Christmas time.

Characters are alive that are supposed to be dead.  Carface is supposed to be in Hell he got pulled down into it at the end of the second one.If you  are 5 or older.  The good thing about it  is a lot more approapriate than the original and is rated corrected.  I think the first one should have ben PG13 and the second should of  been PG.  Unfortunatley back then the did not have any pg13 rated cartoons until  Beehives in Butt  do America can out.It would have be better Ive they had  put the king gator in it.  Belonda is okey she is  evil and wicked.  But I've seen betetr.

I love the evil witch Belladonna who appears in this movie and I like that her cousin Annabelle(the pink whippet) says more than 4 lines. The thing that takes  this rating down would be the plot. Who hasn't heard the real 'Christmas  Carol' a thousand times already? It's really just like all the rest with  the characters from ADGTH. I'm a big fan of ADGTH(I have a webisite on it  too)but the plot gets boring when you've heard it a thousand times.

Vaughan ""Vaughanster""","[4, 4]","This is one of the best animated versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" available, in my opinion, but not because of its fidelity to the novel by Charles Dickens.  Although it borrows enough elements from the Dickens classic to be recognizable as a version of that popular Christmas story, it also has elements more reminiscent of an episode of ""Batman and Robin,"" or ""The Wizard of Oz.""  The plots and sub-plots are complex, and the characters well developed.  The graphics are better than those in most animated versions, too.
