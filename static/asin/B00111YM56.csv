Second will happen on the  half  length of the movie. There are 3 main characters in the movie not including the one who you will see for less than a minute and another for a few short minutes. That said, there aren't many people in the movie, so it's really just 3 people and a crocodile. Of all 5 characters I liked none. 2 were O.K. One of them was the pregnant woman and another was the person who swam on his boat with them. After approximately 11-12 minutes of the movie, you will be left to unrealistical crocodile and its unrealistical behavior and one character who is all right and others who I couldn't care less about. At the very end, when you see the croc for the last time I felt really sad for what happened to it. It was cruel to see what they did to a poor croc in the movie and yet showing his eyes, which were showing his last seconds of life. As you look in the eyes, you can see that he didn't understand what happened. I don't understand how the movie can have good ratings. 90% of the movie, you will see characters sitting on the tree. For several times you will hear characters arguing over the same things, over and over again. How many times did they talk about no other boats nearby or that the husband of the pregnant woman had any other plans other than what he mentioned sadly not once? Bad movie, not recommended and therefore also could care less about acting, because it just doesn't matter.

A father, mother, and their twenty-two year old daughter have been travelling around in their Australian outback looking for things to do.  When they select a remote swamp fishing excursion, they get more than they bargained for.  The area is similar to the Everglades in Florida, and just as dangerous.  Areas like this around the world are filled with deadly snakes and gators or crocs.  In Australia the crocodiles get as large as thirty feet.  This family unfortunately finds out that they can overturn a small fishing boat.  When a croc overturns their boat they must try to figure out how to survive or die a horrible death.

1128678,A21VGNU5959O85,B00111YM56,CaterpillarGirl,"[2, 4]","I have a wierd fear of alligators/crocodiles. Living in Florida you pretty much are used to an alligator being in any body of water, Ive even knowingly swam in lakes that have them. I can hold baby ones, touch adults who have taped mouths of course. My fear only manifests itself in my nightmares where I am pursued by one, or many, and dragged underwater. I know thats just symbolism, but its sure as heck feels like a reptilian nightmare.This film inhabits those nightmares, and I was crazy in the head to watch it...but I still did! Black Water is an Australian film, based on a true story. The real story involved 3 teens who went for a bike ride by a river and there was a flash flood, the teen boy got pulled under by a crocodile and the other two, both girls,  climbed a tree. The Croc paraded the body past the girls all night, and then stuck around so they couldn't get down, they were finally rescued and the boys' body was never recovered.In Black Water the characters are also two women who are sisters and the oldest sister's husband. They take a vacation, and ironically go to a crocodile farm. The saltwater croc or ""saltie"" is the largest living reptile. The Australian Saltwater Crocodile population is estimated at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 adults, and its not uncommon to find one measuring in at 19 feet. Most of the farms were opened up by hunters who were capturing a record amount of crocs, and now using them for products (meat, purses, belts, etc) and the tourism aspect brought even more money in. Now they are breeding farms, and no wild crocodiles are brought in, so its turned into a conservation movement as well as an entertainment industry. I bring this up, because now there are fewer hunters and more crocodiles in the wild, and that's where this film comes in.These three go from the farm, where they observed how crocs can jump out of the water to grab prey, and just how powerful they are in pursuit of a meal, to going fishing down into the mangroves off a main river. While fishing, a crocodile turns over their boat and kills their guide immediately, and they must now find a way to survive its hunt. I love horror movies that take place in one distinct area, in this case a little plot of water, some trees, and a boat. They actually filmed in a real mangrove, with real crocodiles, none of that CGI nonsense that's hardly believable. I had to keep telling myself to breathe at points, and that it was only a movie.I only have one complaint, and that's the cover of the DVD, don't go by how terrible that is, the Australian release had a better one than the Americanized version.",5,Ausploitation Horror.,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2632,"['have', 'wierd', 'fear', 'alligators/crocodiles', 'Living', 'Florida', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'used', 'alligator', 'being', 'body', 'water', 'Ive', 'even', 'knowingly', 'swam', 'lakes', 'have', 'can', 'hold', 'baby', 'ones', 'touch', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'taped', 'mouths', 'course', 'fear', 'only', 'nightmares', 'where', 'am', 'pursued', 'one', 'many', 'dragged', 'underwater', 'know', 'thats', 'just', 'symbolism', 'sure', 'heck', 'feels', 'reptilian', 'nightmare.This', 'film', 'inhabits', 'nightmares', 'was', 'crazy', 'head', 'watch', 'still', 'did', 'Black', 'Water', 'Australian', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'story', 'involved', '3', 'teens', 'who', 'went', 'bike', 'ride', 'river', 'was', 'flash', 'flood', 'teen', 'boy', 'got', 'pulled', 'crocodile', 'other', 'two', 'girls', 'climbed', 'tree', 'Croc', 'paraded', 'body', 'girls', 'night', 'then', 'stuck', 'around', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'down', 'were', 'finally', 'rescued', 'boys', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'recovered.In', 'Black', 'Water', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'sisters', 'oldest', 'sister', 'husband', 'take', 'vacation', 'ironically', 'go', 'crocodile', 'farm', 'saltwater', 'croc', 'saltie', 'largest', 'living', 'reptile', 'Australian', 'Saltwater', 'Crocodile', 'population', 'estimated', 'somewhere', '100,000', '200,000', 'adults', 'not', 'uncommon', 'find', 'one', 'measuring', '19', 'feet', 'Most', 'farms', 'were', 'opened', 'up', 'hunters', 'who', 'were', 'capturing', 'record', 'amount', 'crocs', 'now', 'using', 'products', 'meat', 'purses', 'belts', 'etc', 'tourism', 'aspect', 'brought', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'Now', 'are', 'breeding', 'farms', 'wild', 'crocodiles', 'are', 'brought', 'turned', 'conservation', 'movement', 'as', 'well', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'bring', 'up', 'now', 'are', 'fewer', 'hunters', 'more', 'crocodiles', 'wild', 'where', 'film', 'in.These', 'three', 'go', 'farm', 'where', 'observed', 'how', 'crocs', 'can', 'jump', 'water', 'grab', 'prey', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'are', 'pursuit', 'meal', 'going', 'fishing', 'down', 'mangroves', 'off', 'main', 'river', 'fishing', 'crocodile', 'over', 'boat', 'kills', 'guide', 'immediately', 'must', 'now', 'find', 'way', 'survive', 'hunt', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'distinct', 'area', 'case', 'little', 'plot', 'water', 'trees', 'boat', 'actually', 'filmed', 'real', 'mangrove', 'real', 'crocodiles', 'none', 'CGI', 'nonsense', 'hardly', 'believable', 'had', 'keep', 'telling', 'breathe', 'points', 'was', 'only', 'movie.I', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'cover', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'how', 'terrible', 'Australian', 'release', 'had', 'better', 'one', 'Americanized', 'version']",Black Water

1128680,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00111YM56,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Black Water is a surprisingly scary horror film from Australia. I never once thought of Crocodile Dundee.Made on a shoestring, avoiding hokey CGI special effects, and relying on rhythm to scare; this movie works well. The film opens with an ominous subtitle describing how the crocodile population has grown. As with all good horror films, this one starts out with an innocent couple and the sister in law that go off on vacation. The one big mistake made, Adam the husband, chooses a fishing tour of the back waters. The good part of this mistake, there was nothing fundamentally wrong or stupid about the choice.The horror that will happen is nicely hinted at during a visit to a crocodile farm. The director did an outstanding job of pacing this film. There were good moments between action and most attacks were a surprise. There was only one moment when I laughed, not believing that a crocodile could have possibly done that. Otherwise, the film held true to death rolls and mostly the way crocodiles attack their prey. Early in the film I did find myself looking for the fast forward button, some of the action interludes were a few minutes too long.The acting was not the greatest, but there were no stupid people in this film. Everyone reacted to the situation about the way you might expect most people to act. There was a sense of realism in the film.This film is rated R for strong language. The way MPAA has swung lately, if it hadn't been for the overuse of the f-bomb, this film would have been PG-13. There is a lot of realistic gore, severed arms, a body with no head or legs, and crocodile blood splatters. There is no nudity.The DVD is packed with some very nice segments. The making of featurette is excellent, how they hired two directors to save on insurance for the film, and how the film was not shot on a set, but in a real mangrove swamp. The deleted scenes were interesting, I would have preferred to see them included in the film, and I think the movie would have been stronger.The film is about ten minutes too long, some of the non-action sequences could have been tightened up.This is a low budget, good thriller. The writers and directors avoided the whole Australia stereotype and Crocodile Dundee to their advantage.

1128681,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00111YM56,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[29, 34]","Black Water is one extremely intense human survival movie.  I don't know how anyone could sit through this and not have to consciously unclench most of his/her muscles before he/she can walk away after it's over.  I can see where comparisons withJaws (30th Anniversary Edition),Open Water (Widescreen Edition), orRoguewould ultimately come up in the discussion of this film, but I absolutely did not expect to see some viewers rating it so poorly.  I don't think the Jaws comparisons carry much weight, and -as far as the other film comparisons go - who cares?  Even if you've never seen a movie before in your life, you pretty much know how the film is going to play out by the twenty-five minute mark - and that doesn't make the film any less thrilling or suspenseful.  The only question that really matters here is who, if any, of the characters are going to survive.  The plot is one of brutal simplicity - and I mean that as a compliment.Here's the situation.  You're enjoying a fishing adventure with two family members in a mangrove swamp in Northern Australia when your boat is capsized by a salt-water crocodile.  Two of you manage to scurry up a nearby tree, while the most vulnerable member of your party clings to the top of the overturned boat.  Forget about your tour guide because he doesn't survive the initial attack.  The odds are that no one is going to be looking for you any time soon, and there are hundreds of little tributaries to search if someone does come.  Your best bet is the boat, but - assuming you can first rescue the third member of your party, there's no way to get to the boat without venturing dozens of terrifying meters into the water.  That water, by the way, isn't black but it is definitely dark (I imagine they would have called this movie Dark Water if that title hadn't already been taken so recently) - unless the crocodile shows himself, there's almost no way you're going to know he's coming until he's torn into you with his massive jaws.  What do you do?I love and respect crocodiles.  They are second only to sharks in the list of nature's most brilliantly designed killing machines.  As unfortunate as the characters' situation is, I can't hate or condemn this salty for doing what he was born to do.  That being said, this particular croc is a mean one; I don't want to give anything away, so just take my word on this.  The big guy's in total control of the situation, and he knows it - and he has all the time in the world to wait for his victims to make a deadly mistake.  You're not looking at some kind of CGI creation or mechanical beast here, either; Black Water serves us the real deal.  Some people, of course, complain that the crocodile does not get enough screen time, but any fan of classic horror can tell you that less is more in situations like this.  Maybe the ending doesn't ring quite true, but overall I found this film disquietingly realistic.Perhaps the most horrifying thing of all about this film is the fact that it was inspired in part by actual events.  Salt water crocs kill several people a year in Northern Australia, but most of those deaths involve humans doing something they shouldn't be doing.  Here, as in the case that inspired the movie, you simply have a case of three individuals being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I realize I haven't mentioned any of the characters in this film.  We may not get to know them like old friends, but I thought there was definitely adequate characterization in play here - and I thought Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody, and Andy Rodoreda turned in inspired performances.

After leaving from their mother's house two sisters and one's boyfriend head out for a road trip. After visiting a croc farm they decide it is time to go fishing, doesn't seem like the right move right? So after getting a guide to take them out they spend an uneventful day out on the water that is until the boat rocks. Turns out a very big croc was waiting underneath them and pushed the boat over. That was the last time the guide was seen, and the other three make their way up a tree. From here on out the movie is all about these three in the tree and the croc below.I remember watching this the first time and thinking here we go another nature run amuck flick that is supposedly based on true events. To my surprise this movie turned out to be good, much better than I expected. From what I can gather this is based on true events from a group of friends that were swimming or something and one got pulled underneath and was gone while the other two made it up a tree. Whether this is true or not it is still an effective and entertaining flick that all should enjoy. I personally like to think that this is based on some truth that is real close to this event. Don't get me wrong I don't like that people got ate alive but knowing that this is true adds a little something to it.This movie is far from the best thing ever made but it is an effective enough film on the level that it does have a bit on tension to it. I like that the filmmakers stuck to the less is more rule and only showed the croc when necessary. I especially like when the camera just looks to the water and nothing ever appears, then right when you are getting the feeling ever thing is ok just the top of the croc's head appears right in front of someone. Writer/directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki did a great job in my opinion on this indie flick about a killer croc.As far as performances go they only add to the tension since the small cast all do great jobs. The guys are good in this the boyfriend goes from a geeky looking dude to trying to be the hero, it doesn't work out. But it is the actresses that play the two sisters that steal the show from the boys in this one; the younger one in particular is great. Add in the atmosphere of the film and you have an enjoyable little killer croc flick there are more enjoyable films on this subject if you want gore or even comedy elements in croc/alligator flicks. But if you want a cool indie flick with a good amount of tension, I liked it.

However, within the first fifteen minutes--where barely anything happens in the film--I was pleasantly surprised and settled in for what I believed would be a good film.Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.BLACK WATER is about a small group of Australians away on a holiday. After visiting with family and going to the famed crocodile park, Mark, the leading man in this story, decides that he wants to go for some light fishing, but when they discover that they're unable to go they're disheartened and more than willing to abandon the trip--that is, until Jim, another caretaker, offers to take them.Things seem to be going well immediately. They're getting a few bites, they're having a great time--Then, out of nowhere, their boat is capsized, their captain killed by a giant crocodile, and they are left to survive, alone, in the Australian outback, with nothing more than a bottle of bug spray, a dead cell phone and a pocket knife.BLACK WATER is your usual, straight-forward creature-feature film--it features a small group of people who are suddenly thrust into a situation that they cannot control. Miles away from civilization and in a channel hardly-navigated by boat traffic, there seems to be little hope from the get go. This sense of hopelessness is conveyed not only by surprisingly-talented actors, but by an amazing score that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Tension flows and ebbs in wicked tones as the score first rises, then falls in between crocodile sightings. However, this film would be nothing without the amazing actresses who are thankfully focused upon throughout much of the film. Both the women who played Gracie and Lee did an amazing job and set up an amazing chemistry that only further served to complete this film.Do I have anything bad to say about this movie? Not really. I could have hoped for a more definite ending, but that might just be the fan of heroism in me that makes me desire that. However, that DOES NOT, in the least, detract from this movie.As of this posting, BLACK WATER can be seen for free on Fear.Net, and for the amount of fun and tension I had whilst watching this film, I would recommend any and everyone who reads this review to seek this film out.

And, having mentioned ""Open Water,"" I should add that I thought it a brilliant film. Thus, this review should be interpreted in light of that statement.Three twenty-somethings are on their summer holiday shortly after Christmas. They decide to take a fishing trip and engage a small boat and tour guide. While they are anchored in a mangrove swamp, a killer crocodile upsets the boat and dispatches the guide. This leaves the three vacationers to fend for themselves. Most of the time, they do so by sitting in the mangrove trees, which allow them safety from the crocodile if not comfort or a path to rescue.As I noted, comparisons to ""Open Water"" are inevitable. Here are just a few:1. The casts are mostly unknown to American audiences but do an admirable job.2. The films rely heavily on an inability to see the animals (sharks and the crocodile), building suspense through what are often simply shots of water.3. Both films begin with a short attempt to get us to know the characters, but these attempts are not enough; we only get to know the characters well once they are in serious trouble.4. There is little gore or overt violence in either film.5. Both films were made on small budgets.There are other similarities, of course, but I don't want to belabor the point. In the end, I thought ""Black Water"" was a solid movie, but it tended a few times a bit much toward predictability for my tastes.",4,"Think ""Open Water"" with a crocodile",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,1498,"['Comparisons', 'Australian', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'Open', 'Water', 'are', 'inevitable', 'apt', 'having', 'mentioned', 'Open', 'Water', 'should', 'add', 'thought', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Thus', 'review', 'should', 'be', 'interpreted', 'light', 'statement.Three', 'twenty-somethings', 'are', 'summer', 'holiday', 'shortly', 'Christmas', 'decide', 'take', 'fishing', 'trip', 'engage', 'small', 'boat', 'tour', 'guide', 'are', 'anchored', 'mangrove', 'swamp', 'killer', 'crocodile', 'boat', 'guide', 'three', 'vacationers', 'fend', 'Most', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'sitting', 'mangrove', 'trees', 'allow', 'safety', 'crocodile', 'not', 'comfort', 'path', 'rescue.As', 'noted', 'comparisons', 'Open', 'Water', 'are', 'inevitable', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few:1', 'casts', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'American', 'audiences', 'do', 'admirable', 'job.2', 'films', 'rely', 'heavily', 'inability', 'see', 'animals', 'sharks', 'crocodile', 'building', 'suspense', 'what', 'are', 'often', 'simply', 'shots', 'water.3', 'films', 'begin', 'short', 'attempt', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'attempts', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'only', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'well', 'are', 'serious', 'trouble.4', 'little', 'gore', 'overt', 'violence', 'film.5', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'small', 'budgets.There', 'are', 'other', 'similarities', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'belabor', 'point', 'end', 'thought', 'Black', 'Water', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'tended', 'few', 'times', 'bit', 'much', 'predictability', 'tastes']",Black Water

1128704,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00111YM56,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","""Black Water"" follows an almost identical set-up to the higher-profileRogue, with several people setting off boating along the rivers of Australia, only to have a pleasant, hot and sunny day take a turn for the worse when a large, aggressive crocodile shows up with hunger on its mind.  Rogue is slightly better on a technical level, and is a reccommended watch, but overall I thought Black Water was the better movie.The plot is basic but the crocodile is a formidable prescence (bolstered by impressive special effects) and the interactions (and sometimes tensions) among the human characters are well done and convincing.  Probably the most notable thing about Black Water is the very thing that, in mentioning it, has the potential to turn a lot of people off it: the croc attack comes early, and the surviving characters proceed to spend a large portion of the movie trapped up in the trees that dot the mangrove.  Now, I realize that sounds like it's going to be stupid, but it says something that the movie actually pulled it off.  The trees are sparse, and as the characters try to manuever from one to the other to make it to land, or clash over whether to brave the shallow, still waters and try and reach their capsized boat, or try to scramble higher up the trees and out of potential reach of the croc's jaws, the movie doesn't drag one bit.  I thought it was worth some kudos that while some movies have all kinds of interesting twists and subplots but can't always make them click, Black Water takes a very bare-bones scenario and keeps it fresh and engaging.  Of course, eventually, the movie does move on as the boaters's fight for survival gets increasingly desperate.  Like a lot of the other killer reptile films, Black Water doesn't really have a villain, per se: the crocodile is hungry, not evil.  Fortunately that distinction doesn't water him down any - he's one big, vicious, frightful reptile. Well done all around, this one's a must for fans ofLake Placid (Widescreen Edition), the ""Anaconda"" movies, or, of course,Rogue.

1128708,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00111YM56,Tim Janson,"[2, 4]","I recently reviewed the awful Lake Placid 2 and now we have another moving about a menacing crocodile, Black Water.  Trust me however; the two films could not be more different in every way possible.  Black Water is a true, low-budget diamond in the rough.  In this case, low-budget doesn't mean any sacrifice in quality.  This Australian-produced film is somewhat reminiscent of 2003's Open Water in that it has a very small cast--only five actors are listed in the credits--and is shot in only a few different settings.  The fear in Black Water is largely psychological and comes from what you don't see as much as what you do see.Set just after Christmas, two sisters Lee (Dermody) and Grace along with Grace's boyfriend, Adam, hire a boat to take them fishing and sightseeing along an Australian river.  The river waters are extremely high, creating a swamp out of the nearby forest.  As the trio cast their lines in the murky waters, their little boat is suddenly overturned by a crocodile who quickly munches their guide as they climb to safety up one of the trees.  Their boat lies overturned, just feet away but it may as well be a mile.  They find themselves completely trapped, surrounded by water and who knows how many crocodiles.Directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki deftly build the suspense as each little splash; each ripple in the water sends a chill of fear through the three survivors.  Adam wants to go for the boat but the sisters want to wait until someone comes along, a prospect Adam insists is useless as know one knows they are even out there.  It becomes a test of nerves and resolve as they try to keep their footing in the tree as exhaustion and starvation assaults them, not to mention the constant biting of mosquitoes.Unlike Lake Placid, this film doesn't use cheap CGI effects.  In an effort to bring the most realism to the production, they've used real crocodiles, combining them with the actors through blue screen photography which is seamless and often horrifyingly real.  Its real progenitor might be considered Jaws, as you don't see the crocodile a lot, particularly early on, although it does provide some of those signature jump-out-of-your-seat moments.  You knew the croc was always out there, lurking about but you never knew where.The cast was superb because they were so completely real and believable.  There was not a hint of overacting.  Adam didn't try to be the typical macho hero and the girls weren't just helpless bimbos.  They all did an outstanding job of conveying the helplessness and desperation of their plight.  Nerves become frayed and tempers begin to flare.  I can honestly say I didn't know who, if any of them, would ever get out of the swamp.The film was also shot on location in an actual mangrove swamp and provided the crew with only about a three hour window each day as the tide would go out leaving them in a muddy riverbed.  The scenery was beautifully shot and while it was made only a mile or so from Sydney, it strongly suggested a primeval remoteness.  This is one of those little hidden gems that you hope to find on a trip to the video store.  Definitely one to check out.ExtrasThe extras included an audio commentary with both directors, a few deleted scenes and an excellent, 23 minute making of documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.",4,SOLID SMALL B MOVIE,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3337,"['recently', 'reviewed', 'awful', 'Lake', 'Placid', '2', 'now', 'have', 'moving', 'menacing', 'crocodile', 'Black', 'Water', 'Trust', 'however', 'two', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'way', 'possible', 'Black', 'Water', 'true', 'low-budget', 'diamond', 'rough', 'case', 'low-budget', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sacrifice', 'quality', 'Australian-produced', 'film', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', '2003', 'Open', 'Water', 'very', 'small', 'cast', 'only', 'five', 'actors', 'are', 'listed', 'credits', 'shot', 'only', 'few', 'different', 'settings', 'fear', 'Black', 'Water', 'largely', 'psychological', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'do', 'see.Set', 'just', 'Christmas', 'two', 'sisters', 'Lee', 'Dermody', 'Grace', 'Grace', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'hire', 'boat', 'take', 'fishing', 'sightseeing', 'along', 'Australian', 'river', 'river', 'waters', 'are', 'extremely', 'high', 'creating', 'swamp', 'nearby', 'forest', 'trio', 'cast', 'lines', 'murky', 'waters', 'little', 'boat', 'suddenly', 'overturned', 'crocodile', 'who', 'quickly', 'munches', 'guide', 'climb', 'safety', 'up', 'one', 'trees', 'boat', 'overturned', 'just', 'feet', 'away', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'mile', 'find', 'completely', 'trapped', 'surrounded', 'water', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'crocodiles.Directors', 'David', 'Nerlich', 'Andrew', 'Traucki', 'deftly', 'build', 'suspense', 'little', 'splash', 'ripple', 'water', 'chill', 'fear', 'three', 'survivors', 'Adam', 'go', 'boat', 'sisters', 'want', 'wait', 'someone', 'along', 'prospect', 'Adam', 'insists', 'useless', 'know', 'one', 'are', 'even', 'there', 'test', 'nerves', 'resolve', 'try', 'keep', 'footing', 'tree', 'exhaustion', 'starvation', 'assaults', 'not', 'mention', 'constant', 'biting', 'mosquitoes.Unlike', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'film', ""n't"", 'use', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'effects', 'effort', 'bring', 'most', 'realism', 'production', ""'ve"", 'used', 'real', 'crocodiles', 'combining', 'actors', 'blue', 'screen', 'photography', 'seamless', 'often', 'horrifyingly', 'real', 'real', 'progenitor', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'Jaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'crocodile', 'lot', 'particularly', 'early', 'provide', 'signature', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'moments', 'knew', 'croc', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'lurking', 'never', 'knew', 'where.The', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'were', 'so', 'completely', 'real', 'believable', 'was', 'not', 'hint', 'overacting', 'Adam', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'typical', 'macho', 'hero', 'girls', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'helpless', 'bimbos', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'conveying', 'helplessness', 'desperation', 'plight', 'become', 'frayed', 'tempers', 'begin', 'flare', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'swamp.The', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'location', 'actual', 'mangrove', 'swamp', 'provided', 'crew', 'only', 'three', 'hour', 'window', 'day', 'tide', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'leaving', 'muddy', 'riverbed', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'mile', 'so', 'Sydney', 'strongly', 'suggested', 'primeval', 'remoteness', 'one', 'little', 'hidden', 'gems', 'hope', 'find', 'trip', 'video', 'store', 'Definitely', 'one', 'check', 'out.ExtrasThe', 'extras', 'included', 'audio', 'commentary', 'directors', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'excellent', '23', 'minute', 'making', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew']",Black Water

1128710,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00111YM56,trebe,"[1, 2]","Opening with a montage of candid vacation photos, Black Water (2007) is a film that unpretentiously tells a story about ordinary people, unexpectedly facing danger.  Supposedly based on real events in Australia, the tale is simple, but quite effectively told, as a party of tourists is attacked by a crocodile, while on a fishing tour.  The survivors experience fear, doubt, confusion, and despair, as the deadly crocodile seems to show up at exactly the wrong time.Grace (Diana Glenn), her boyfriend Adam (Andy Rodoreda), and her sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) are on vacation together.  With no definite plans, they decide to take a fishing tour on the river.  Boarding a small boat, Jim (Ben Oxenbould) their tour guide takes them out on the river.  While stopped in shallow water, the boat is flipped over by a croc, spilling the group into the water.  Grace and Adam make for a tree, while Lee tangled in some ropes is trapped beneath the capsized boat.  Unfortunately, Jim has become a snack for one of nature's more efficient killing machines.  Eventually, Lee makes her way to the tree, leaving the three survivors stuck up on the branches, looking down into the murky water, with the overturned boat floating few feet away, wondering what they should do.To say much more, would spoil it for those who haven't seen the film.  With much of the action centered around a boat and a small group of trees, Black Water still holds your interest, and seems to have a high believability factor.  The crocodile is very persistent, and a couple of times gets a bit too frisky, but mostly the creature's behavior seems credible.  The actions of the survivors, seems logical and believable as well.  Their thinking process is clear, and things play out in a very natural and realistic way.  Early on an element is introduced that becomes a crucial factor later, but to story's credit, it takes some effort and intelligence to play this last card.Black Water is co-written and co-directed by Andrew Traucki, and David Nerlich.  The pair provide an informative commentary track, with some interesting background information.  The cast and crew worked under some very challenging conditions on location.  Actors Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda, and Maeve Dermody are all very good, with Dermody delivering a very credible, and surprisingly gutsy performance.Black Water is unspectacular and has a slow pace, but is a solidly effective thriller, with some surprises.  For more along these lines, take a look atRogue - Unrated(2007), which also takes place in Australia.",4,monkeys in a tree . . .,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,2552,"['Opening', 'montage', 'candid', 'vacation', 'photos', 'Black', 'Water', '2007', 'film', 'unpretentiously', 'story', 'ordinary', 'people', 'unexpectedly', 'facing', 'danger', 'Supposedly', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Australia', 'tale', 'simple', 'quite', 'effectively', 'told', 'party', 'tourists', 'attacked', 'crocodile', 'fishing', 'tour', 'survivors', 'experience', 'fear', 'doubt', 'confusion', 'despair', 'deadly', 'crocodile', 'show', 'up', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'time.Grace', 'Diana', 'Glenn', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'Andy', 'Rodoreda', 'sister', 'Lee', 'Maeve', 'Dermody', 'are', 'vacation', 'together', 'definite', 'plans', 'decide', 'take', 'fishing', 'tour', 'river', 'Boarding', 'small', 'boat', 'Jim', 'Ben', 'Oxenbould', 'tour', 'guide', 'out', 'river', 'stopped', 'shallow', 'water', 'boat', 'flipped', 'croc', 'spilling', 'group', 'water', 'Grace', 'Adam', 'make', 'tree', 'Lee', 'tangled', 'ropes', 'trapped', 'capsized', 'boat', 'Unfortunately', 'Jim', 'become', 'snack', 'one', 'nature', 'more', 'efficient', 'killing', 'machines', 'Eventually', 'Lee', 'way', 'tree', 'leaving', 'three', 'survivors', 'stuck', 'up', 'branches', 'looking', 'down', 'murky', 'water', 'overturned', 'boat', 'floating', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'wondering', 'what', 'should', 'do.To', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'much', 'action', 'centered', 'boat', 'small', 'group', 'trees', 'Black', 'Water', 'still', 'interest', 'have', 'high', 'believability', 'factor', 'crocodile', 'very', 'persistent', 'couple', 'times', 'bit', 'too', 'frisky', 'mostly', 'creature', 'behavior', 'credible', 'actions', 'survivors', 'logical', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'thinking', 'process', 'clear', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'very', 'natural', 'realistic', 'way', 'Early', 'element', 'introduced', 'crucial', 'factor', 'later', 'story', 'credit', 'effort', 'intelligence', 'play', 'last', 'card.Black', 'Water', 'co-written', 'co-directed', 'Andrew', 'Traucki', 'David', 'Nerlich', 'pair', 'provide', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'interesting', 'background', 'information', 'cast', 'crew', 'worked', 'very', 'challenging', 'conditions', 'location', 'Actors', 'Diana', 'Glenn', 'Andy', 'Rodoreda', 'Maeve', 'Dermody', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Dermody', 'delivering', 'very', 'credible', 'surprisingly', 'gutsy', 'performance.Black', 'Water', 'unspectacular', 'slow', 'pace', 'solidly', 'effective', 'thriller', 'surprises', 'more', 'lines', 'take', 'look', 'atRogue', 'Unrated', '2007', 'also', 'place', 'Australia']",Black Water
1128711,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00111YM56,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Three travelers taking a fishing tour are left in the midst of mangrove swamps of Northern Australia. There is no one to guide them back to the town. The cell phone is dead. No one is likely to come where they are stranded. And somewhere in the muddy water a huge crocodile is hiding, waiting for the chance to eat them one by one.""Black Water"" is a solid B-suspense movie. Unlike other killer animal thrillers like ""Alligator"" (1980), ""Black Water"" employs a more realistic approach to tell the story of three hapless travelers and one deadly croc, cleverly using the swamp as the backdrop. Obviously this Australian film was shot with a minimal budget, but the film's atmospheric photography is impressive enough to make us believe the presence of the lurking danger. Sometimes cheap special effects ruin the film in this kind of low budget suspense films, but this doesn't happen in ""Black Water.""The film claims it is ""based on true events"" (I don't know anything about the events the film refers to), but actually the storyline of ""Black Water"" is pretty familiar to the fans of the genre. Don't get me wrong. This is not to say the film is bad. The acting is very good, and the film's direction is steady and solid, but honestly, the story after the first croc attack is not very surprising. Also, some of the dialogues delivered on a tree are just unnecessary..There are many suspense films featuring wild animals attacking humans and ""Jaws"" always comes top of the list.

1128712,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00111YM56,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","2007's ""Black Water"" is an Australian crocagator flick made for only $700,000, which shows you can make a quality movie on a very low budget. Not that ""Black Water"" is anything especially amazing, but it is the most realistic crocagator flick I've ever seen (although I haven't yet seen the acclaimed ""Rogue,"" another Australian croc film from 2007).PLOT: While on vacation, a man, his wife, her sister and a guide go fishing in a mangrove swamp in northern Australian where they get attacked by a croc, who is hardly ever seen in the muddy waters. They find temporary sanctuary in the trees but know they'll die of thirst if they don't make an effort to escape the remote swamp. But how?The story is said to be based on true events, which I don't doubt since the film smacks of near total realism. This of course sets it apart from most crocagator flicks, like ""Alligator,"" ""Crocodile"" and ""Lake Placid 2 (Unrated)"" which have too much goofiness to take very seriously. While I enjoy those movies, especially ""Crocodile,"" I always prefer realism if given the choice.The plot is in some ways reminiscent of ""Night Skies (Widescreen Edition)"", also from 2007, just substitute the croc for aliens.Aside from the totally realistic vibe, ""Black Water"" has solid no-name actors in the main roles, particularly the two sisters played by Diana Glenn (Grace) and Maeve Dermody (Lee). Not only are they worthy actors but they're appealing in a girl-next-door type of way.The only negative I can cite is the thin plot. The story as detailed above is the WHOLE movie. As a result, there's quite a bit of down time, particularly as the survivors mark time in the trees trying to figure out how to escape.For this reason the film would have probably worked better at the hour mark. As it is, it's 89 minutes with credits and some parts are really sssllllooooooww[...] But the film makes up for it in realism. What would YOU do if you and your loved ones were attacked and cornered by a huge croc in an isolated swamp in the middle of nowhere?I'm giving ""Black Water"" 4 Stars with reservations: If you're in the mood for a relatively fast-paced, partly goofy, horror thrill-ride, look elsewhere. If you want the awful truth, including many long sequences of heart-wrenching uncertainty and horror, check out ""Black Water.""GRADE: B-",4,"For once, a realistic crocagator flick",1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2317,"['2007', 'Black', 'Water', 'Australian', 'crocagator', 'flick', 'made', 'only', '700,000', 'can', 'make', 'quality', 'movie', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'Not', 'Black', 'Water', 'anything', 'especially', 'amazing', 'most', 'realistic', 'crocagator', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'acclaimed', 'Rogue', 'Australian', 'croc', 'film', '2007', '.PLOT', 'vacation', 'man', 'wife', 'sister', 'guide', 'go', 'fishing', 'mangrove', 'swamp', 'northern', 'Australian', 'where', 'get', 'attacked', 'croc', 'who', 'hardly', 'ever', 'seen', 'muddy', 'waters', 'find', 'temporary', 'sanctuary', 'trees', 'know', ""'ll"", 'die', 'thirst', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'escape', 'remote', 'swamp', 'how', 'story', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'film', 'smacks', 'total', 'realism', 'course', 'sets', 'apart', 'most', 'crocagator', 'flicks', 'Alligator', 'Crocodile', 'Lake', 'Placid', '2', 'Unrated', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'goofiness', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'especially', 'Crocodile', 'always', 'prefer', 'realism', 'given', 'choice.The', 'plot', 'ways', 'reminiscent', 'Night', 'Skies', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'also', '2007', 'just', 'substitute', 'croc', 'aliens.Aside', 'totally', 'realistic', 'vibe', 'Black', 'Water', 'solid', 'no-name', 'actors', 'main', 'roles', 'particularly', 'two', 'sisters', 'played', 'Diana', 'Glenn', 'Grace', 'Maeve', 'Dermody', 'Lee', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'worthy', 'actors', ""'re"", 'appealing', 'girl-next-door', 'type', 'way.The', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'cite', 'thin', 'plot', 'story', 'detailed', 'above', 'WHOLE', 'movie', 'result', 'quite', 'bit', 'down', 'time', 'particularly', 'survivors', 'mark', 'time', 'trees', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape.For', 'reason', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'worked', 'better', 'hour', 'mark', '89', 'minutes', 'credits', 'parts', 'are', 'really', 'sssllllooooooww', '[', ']', 'film', 'up', 'realism', 'What', 'would', 'YOU', 'do', 'loved', 'ones', 'were', 'attacked', 'cornered', 'huge', 'croc', 'isolated', 'swamp', 'middle', 'nowhere', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Black', 'Water', '4', 'Stars', 'reservations', ""'re"", 'mood', 'relatively', 'fast-paced', 'partly', 'goofy', 'horror', 'thrill-ride', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'awful', 'truth', 'including', 'many', 'long', 'sequences', 'heart-wrenching', 'uncertainty', 'horror', 'check', 'Black', 'Water', 'GRADE', 'B-']",Black Water
