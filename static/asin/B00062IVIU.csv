I had never heard of it but from the info given it sounded interesting. I watch this movie and laughed & laughed. It has a great cast of actors. And each character is essential to the movie. It's a movie that isn't a block buster but it is a movie that is very entertaining & one that you can watch over & over. It's about a crazy southern family, with quirky habits,lots of sibling rivalry,family love, and a family bond that eventually allows them to over come their obstacles & their feuds with one another & being a southerner I can relate. I have a list of movies that I have seen and enjoyed but they are rarely ever shown on TV again. So I went on-line & found it. If you want a laugh and to be highly entertained this is the movie to add to your DVD collection.
