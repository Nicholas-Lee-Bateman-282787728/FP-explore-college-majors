1538575,A2AF1K1RA8OVGO,B007V9EAH2,"Alecto Move-it Move-it, Boom","[0, 0]",I was very surprised by this anime in several different ways.  First being that I was lazy and didn't do my homework on it so I was shocked when I received it in the mail and realized it was only 11 episodes.  Second being that I usually can predict my way through almost anything I watch and I could not through this.  Third being that I absolutely should have been able to because it totally makes sense at the end and they do drop foreshadowing for you but they do it in such a way that it seems arbitrary.  ITS NOT.  However any show that can do that is fairly well written.  Fractale explores some slightly generic sci-fi Ideas and mechanics in new and unusual ways.  It is a smart buy but it is a little short.,4,good anime sci-fi,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,716,"['was', 'very', 'surprised', 'anime', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'First', 'being', 'was', 'lazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'so', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'received', 'mail', 'realized', 'was', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'Second', 'being', 'usually', 'can', 'predict', 'way', 'almost', 'anything', 'watch', 'could', 'not', 'Third', 'being', 'absolutely', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'because', 'totally', 'sense', 'end', 'do', 'drop', 'foreshadowing', 'do', 'way', 'arbitrary', 'ITS', 'NOT', 'However', 'show', 'can', 'do', 'fairly', 'well', 'written', 'Fractale', 'slightly', 'generic', 'sci-fi', 'Ideas', 'mechanics', 'new', 'unusual', 'ways', 'smart', 'buy', 'little', 'short']",N/A

Some of the clans background would have been nice and put flesh on the story's bones. The episode opening graphics were incorporated in the closing episode's storyline...an unusual and impressive touch.  Twelve episodes just doesn't do justice to all the potential in this series.

1538577,A1MM3MDVZCYIBG,B007V9EAH2,Andrew Ingram,"[1, 2]","Despite the series being cut short by one episode(Originally had 12 Episodes, but producer decided to end it early due to incredibly bad ratings--- Though many Japanese will argue that a lot of it had to do with what channel it aired and it's poor time-slot.  In the end they simply merged Episodes 11 and 12 into one episode and created an alternate ending to compensate.)Despite this, this series never fails to provide action, romance, and even those awkward situations that has become a must-have in many anime titles these days.  The artwork and music puts it up there with Last Exile (the FIRST one, that is)  I'm just glad to hear that the director of this series ""Doesn't plan to give up producing Series like this one""One of the many advantages to having a short story that begins and ends in one solid season is that the story becomes an easy watch.  11 Episodes is ~4 But also, the story isn't consumed by unnecessary details that add nothing to the overall storytelling experience.  (No real filler episodes)Realizing that FUNimation isn't the wealthiest company in any way judging its choice on character casting may not be all the fairest, however, many of their voice over cast tends to be a bit repetitive (if you've seen many other Funimation series) but most disturbing is that Clain's character is being voiced by an obviously ""Feminine"" voice which for a young 15 year old by, doesn't quite work for his character.  (you do get used to it over time, and she is a pretty good actress regardless)All in all, this series isn't #1 on my library of anime titles, but it certainly gets a top ten.",5,Failed In Japan - Only to Be Loved By Americans,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,1610,"['series', 'being', 'cut', 'short', 'one', 'episode', 'Originally', 'had', '12', 'Episodes', 'producer', 'decided', 'end', 'early', 'due', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'ratings', 'many', 'Japanese', 'will', 'argue', 'lot', 'had', 'do', 'what', 'channel', 'aired', 'poor', 'time-slot', 'end', 'simply', 'merged', 'Episodes', '11', '12', 'one', 'episode', 'created', 'alternate', 'ending', 'compensate', 'series', 'never', 'provide', 'action', 'romance', 'even', 'awkward', 'situations', 'become', 'must-have', 'many', 'anime', 'titles', 'days', 'artwork', 'music', 'up', 'there', 'Last', 'Exile', 'FIRST', 'one', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'hear', 'director', 'series', ""n't"", 'plan', 'give', 'up', 'producing', 'Series', 'one', 'One', 'many', 'advantages', 'having', 'short', 'story', 'one', 'solid', 'season', 'story', 'easy', 'watch', '11', 'Episodes', '~4', 'also', 'story', ""n't"", 'consumed', 'unnecessary', 'details', 'add', 'nothing', 'overall', 'storytelling', 'experience', 'real', 'filler', 'episodes', 'Realizing', 'FUNimation', ""n't"", 'wealthiest', 'company', 'way', 'judging', 'choice', 'character', 'casting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fairest', 'however', 'many', 'voice', 'cast', 'tends', 'be', 'bit', 'repetitive', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'Funimation', 'series', 'most', 'disturbing', 'Clain', 'character', 'being', 'voiced', 'obviously', 'Feminine', 'voice', 'young', '15', 'year', 'old', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'character', 'do', 'get', 'used', 'time', 'pretty', 'good', 'actress', 'regardless', 'series', ""n't"", '1', 'library', 'anime', 'titles', 'certainly', 'top', 'ten']",N/A

1538580,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007V9EAH2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","The future.  What happens when technology takes care of ever human need.  The things that people once enjoyed in life, the technologies created by humans in the past is no longer needed?This is the basis of the story ""Fractale"" written by Hiroki Azumi.  Back in 2011, ""Fractale"" aired in Japan and inspired a manga series for Square Enix's ""Gangan Online"" later that year.  And now the complete animated series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment in July 2012.""Fractale"" is directed by Yutaka Yamamoto (""Kannagi: Crazy Shine Maidens"", ""blossom"", ""Black Rock Shooter"") and featuring a screenplay by Mari Okada (""Black Butler"", ""Vampire Knight"", ""CANAAN"").  Character design is by Masako Tashiro and music by Shonei Kano.  The anime production is by A-1 Pictures and backgrounds by Studio Easter.VIDEO:""Fractale"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and the characters have a semblance to Studio Ghibli style of characters.  The anime series is vibrant, colorful and also well-balanced between animation and CG special effects.  Animation is what you come to expect from a TV series with less detail than one would see in a film or OVA but the animation by A-1 Pictures is very good.  I didn't notice any artifacts or banding during my viewing of the series.But overall, ""Fractale"" looks amazing for a TV series.  I love the visual references to Ireland, the character designs and also the well-detailed backgrounds from Studio Easter.AUDIO:""Fractale"" is presented in DolbyTrue HD 5.1 English and Dolby TrueHD 2.0 Japanese.  I had a chance to listen to both lossless soundtracks and the voice acting for both English and Japanese are well-done.As for the lossless soundtrack, there is quite a bit of action seen throughout the series, but with the English soundtrack, because of its 5.1 soundtrack, there is more dynamic range.  While the Japanese soundtrack is good, the English lossless soundtrack stands out the most during the more action intense sequences.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Fractale: The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:Episode 1 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by adaptive script writer J. Michael Tatum and Scott Freeman (Voice of Sunda).Episode 7 Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by ADR director Coleen Clinkenbeard and Brina Palencia (voice of Clain).Original Preview - (:31) The original Japanese preview for ""Fractale"".Promotional Videos - (3:50) The Japanese promotional video for ""Fractale"".DVD & Blu-ray Commercials - (1:07) The Japanese DVD & Blu-ray commercials for ""Fractale"".Shobi Wind Orchestra, Tokyo - (4:52) The performance of ""Fractale Suite' for Wind, Orcehstra Movement 1: Fractale"".  Composed by Souhei Kano.Fractale's Art Sanctuary - Featuring the art of ""Fractale"" (you can see each graphic using your remote/mouse to cycle through each image).U.S. Trailer - (2:02) The FUNimation Entertainment trailer for ""Fractale"".Texless Opening SongTextless Closing Song (Japanese Lyrics)Textless Closing Song (English Lyrics)Trailers - FUNimation Entertianment trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:""Fractale"" is a story about one young man wanting to keep his promise of protecting the two people that are important to him and humanity rebelling against technology and doing all they can to keep their individuality.With only eleven episodes, ""Fractale"" is a complex storyline that manages to incorporate beautiful animation and character designs but also escape banal anime themes by focusing on humanity and its over reliance towards technology.As most of us depend on the Internet, our cell phones and just being connected, what happens when human interaction is no longer needed?  A future when everyone is hooked up to a terminal to live a life they want and one can easily create their own virtual family, girlfriend, friends ala doppel.""Fractale"" is fascinating because it takes on the anti-technology theme and tries to show that as many people who are accepting of technology to run their lives, there are those who want their individuality and do not need to be hooked up to a terminal to live their lives.And the story goes even further by introducing us to the Fractale system and how it becomes almost like a religion as it is so powerful, the system guarantees peace for those who embrace it.While the series does feature on younger characters and tends to have an upbeat, happy theme for most of the episodes.  Things do get dark towards the end as we find out about Phryne's life, what Nessa is and also the war between the factions vs. those who represent the Fractale system.It's a storyline that is complex but not too cerebral or long.  With eleven episodes, the story is well-written during its entire duration and manages to end with closure for the characters and it makes the series quite accessible for anime fans who enjoy sci-fi, adventure and action.I do feel that ""Fractale"" is a series that would do much better in America than in Japan.  As the series uses Ireland as an inspiration, it utilizes the religious war that has been waged in Ireland for a long time.  In Japan, many viewers were confused by fighting amongst factions and also, people were not prepared to see a character having been sexually assaulted.  I've read Japanese online forums and it appears that people were taken in to the series at first, through its animation and character design, its upbeat story but for some, it seemed as if the storyline became a bit too dark for their taste.  But I have seen viewers come to the defense of the series, praising it because the story features a worldly feeling that something that is Japanese.But being from the west, I do feel that the series is much more accessible to westerners.While the series is rated 14, it's important to note that a lot of people are killed in this anime series (no bloody or scenes of gore are featured) and there is also a underlying theme of a character suffering sexual assault as well. So despite the younger characters and the fact that Nessa tends to be happy and upbeat throughout the series, ""Fractale"" is definitely not an anime series to share with the younger children.As for the Blu-ray, ""Fractale"" is looks good on Blu-ray.  It's important to remember that this is a TV series and not an animated film or OVA, so you will see that slight softness that is apparent on many anime TV series.  But there are backgrounds that are well-detailed and I really enjoy the character designs for this series.  It's vibrant and just beautiful to look at. As for audio, the fact that they brought in Sohei Kanno and an orchestra to perform the music for the series is rather cool.  With a lot of anime series now being synth-based, it's great to see an orchestra utilized for ""Fractale"".Also, for an anime series, where some just tend to feature a clean opening and ending theme, this release has a good number of special features, from audio commentary to the Japanese special features, which I enjoyed.Also, another plus for us in the U.S. is that unlike in Japan which the Blu-ray were released in volumes with a few episodes and was quite expensive, we get all episodes of ""Fractale"" in this Blu-ray and DVD combo.Overall, ""Fractale"" is a smart and enjoyable series.  A series that doesn't try to force any belief on the viewer, it shows you the perspective of two different sides and found it to be a very clever and enjoyable anime series.""Fracatale: The Complete

1538583,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B007V9EAH2,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[3, 3]","Fractale was introduced in the 22nd century to promote a peaceful society. It is a network containing billions of computers. Humanity has become complacent and lives their lives through doppelgangers. Very few actually live their lives with their real bodies. Clain is a young man that lives with a fascination of old technology. One day, he meets a girl named Phryne. She is a priestess of Fractale, which has now become controlled by a religious cult. She disappears and leaves Clain a pendant. Out from the pendant comes a cheery girl named Nessa. The connection between Nessa and Phryne is a mystery, but they are very important to the future of Fractale, and are pursued aggressively. The 3 are reunited and join a group of anti-Fractale freedom fighters. With their new friends, they discover the truth, and start a war to liberate humanity from the tyrannical Fractale ""religion"".This anime is very interesting. At first it seems like something that Miyazaki would come up with. Then as it progresses it reminds you of The Last Exile. It's kind of a mix between Castle In the Sky and The Last Exile. It has action, comedy, drama, and mystery. There are lots of great characters with good voice actors. The animation, and soundtrack are also very good. The series has potential to be 5 stars, but I think it needed to be longer. It doesn't seem rushed or anything, I just wish that they has developed the relationships between the characters a bit more than they did. That's my only complaint, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. It's got a little language, so I recommend it to viewers 11 and up.

In fact, it is a shame it is so short.To give you an idea without ruining much. The story sets in a distant future. The internet has advanced in a massive way and is referred to as the Fractale System. Most people in the world are hooked on it to the point they spend their lives in it rather than in the real world. Doppels are what you would call, the person's avatar in the real world. For those that choose to live more in the real world but take advantage of the Fractale System's benefits, they can view relatives or friends as Doppels.That all might sound a bit complicated but really the concepts are simple once you get into the story. Fractale is very much a utopia society and like most, it isn't perfect no matter how hard it is portrayed to be perfect. During the course of this series you will discover that and see that not everything is perfect in this future.Aside from that, the characters of Fractale are decent. They won't win awards for being the most original but they each play their parts well. The biggest surprises involve the antagonists as the story goes on. Despite how cheery and idealistic the story starts as, the anime does go into some dark areas later which some may not expect.Art and sound are both excellent. As this is a Funimation release, expect an English dub. How well done it is, that remains to be seen. Hopefully it will be on par with some of their other recent works like Okami-san.In the end, Fractale serves it's purpose. It wraps up the story well and leaves you with an overall good feeling of time well spent. Hopefully there will be a big price drop because the $70 list price is way too much for a show this short. Which I'm sure it will have. Enjoy it! At the very least, give it a rental.",5,"Doppels...yes, they are a bit..odd..",1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,1880,"['do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'checking', 'show', 'out', 'Fractale', 'story', 'characters', 'keep', 'going', 'many', 'episodes', 'fact', 'shame', 'so', 'short.To', 'give', 'idea', 'ruining', 'much', 'story', 'sets', 'distant', 'future', 'internet', 'advanced', 'massive', 'way', 'referred', 'Fractale', 'System', 'Most', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'hooked', 'point', 'spend', 'lives', 'rather', 'real', 'world', 'Doppels', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'person', 'avatar', 'real', 'world', 'choose', 'live', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'take', 'advantage', 'Fractale', 'System', 'benefits', 'can', 'view', 'relatives', 'friends', 'Doppels.That', 'might', 'sound', 'bit', 'complicated', 'really', 'concepts', 'are', 'simple', 'get', 'story', 'Fractale', 'very', 'much', 'utopia', 'society', 'most', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'portrayed', 'be', 'perfect', 'course', 'series', 'will', 'discover', 'see', 'not', 'everything', 'perfect', 'future.Aside', 'characters', 'Fractale', 'are', 'decent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'being', 'most', 'original', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'involve', 'antagonists', 'story', 'how', 'cheery', 'idealistic', 'story', 'anime', 'go', 'dark', 'areas', 'later', 'may', 'not', 'expect.Art', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'Funimation', 'release', 'expect', 'English', 'dub', 'How', 'well', 'done', 'be', 'seen', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'par', 'other', 'recent', 'works', 'Okami-san.In', 'end', 'Fractale', 'purpose', 'up', 'story', 'well', 'overall', 'good', 'feeling', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'price', 'drop', '70', 'list', 'price', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'short', 'Which', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'Enjoy', 'very', 'least', 'give', 'rental']",N/A
