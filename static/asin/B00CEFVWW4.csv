In this film Alfred (Erik Estrada) who has &#34;knowledge of many things&#34; gets killed by a man of a secret order. We know the order is secret because the man wears a hooded robe with a triple cross on it. His friend William (Richard Dutcher) leads a dig in the desert which leads to a remarkable find, one you might be able to figure out from the title. While the killing is a mystery, those of us who spent their childhood watching Shaggy figure things out, should have no problem with a single suspect killing.The skull prop was fake looking. I haven't seen teeth that white when bleached. The plot has hokey. The dialouge was a joke. The acting was extremely bad. Paul Pugmire couldn't deliver a line, and David Matochief Anderson didn't know what to do with his ridiculous lines. They plan on doing a sequel unless we can quickly repeal the first amendment and stop them.It is overrated at PG-13 too.
