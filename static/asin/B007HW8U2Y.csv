1530983,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B007HW8U2Y,A. Burchfield,"[0, 0]","I bought the DVD because I thought I'd seen the series on TV, as expected there's a lot of interesting material (if you've got a real interest in the Royal family, especially the Queen) that is divided into 3 segments and a &#34;montage&#34; thats a slide show with sound, some vocal, accompaniment. Each has recent and old footage along with still photography, some of each in b/w or color.There's a section on how history has shaped the Royal family of today, it starts with George VThe following section was largely about Traditions and modern innovation as the family adjusts over time, I think this section had the most &#34;Diana&#34; stuff to it- if you don't like the late Princess, don't worry- she isn't heavily covered.The final section I think was about defining moments during the Queen's reign.Throughout the DVD several individuals speak about Her Majesty,each is identified by proper title. The Queen's children (Prince Charles speaks only once- in a 2008 interview- he's seen a few times in passing) speak in each segment, as do her grandchildren, (William, Harry, Beatrice & Eugenie speak most often of that generation), You see their husbands and wives (if any) but never in interviews.Several former, and the current, Prime Minister(s) speak as well.The program aired before the big celebration day, all you get of that is a couple of computer generated images.Lots of interesting footage, including the first I've seen of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 ( she was 78- the current Queen was 86 for her jubilee), but it can be boring if you're not really into it - you do have the option of watching it in segments.",4,"Could get boring if you aren't a real ""fan""",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1643,"['bought', 'DVD', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'series', 'TV', 'expected', 'lot', 'interesting', 'material', ""'ve"", 'got', 'real', 'interest', 'Royal', 'family', 'especially', 'Queen', 'divided', '3', 'segments', '34', 'montage', '34', 'thats', 'slide', 'show', 'sound', 'vocal', 'accompaniment', 'recent', 'old', 'footage', 'still', 'photography', 'b/w', 'section', 'how', 'history', 'shaped', 'Royal', 'family', 'today', 'George', 'VThe', 'following', 'section', 'was', 'largely', 'Traditions', 'modern', 'innovation', 'family', 'time', 'think', 'section', 'had', 'most', '34', 'Diana', '34', 'stuff', 'it-', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'late', 'Princess', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry-', ""n't"", 'heavily', 'covered.The', 'final', 'section', 'think', 'was', 'defining', 'moments', 'Queen', 'reign.Throughout', 'DVD', 'several', 'individuals', 'speak', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'identified', 'proper', 'title', 'Queen', 'children', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'only', 'once-', '2008', 'interview-', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'passing', 'speak', 'segment', 'do', 'grandchildren', 'William', 'Harry', 'Beatrice', 'Eugenie', 'speak', 'most', 'often', 'generation', 'see', 'husbands', 'wives', 'never', 'interviews.Several', 'former', 'current', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'speak', 'well.The', 'program', 'aired', 'big', 'celebration', 'day', 'get', 'couple', 'computer', 'generated', 'images.Lots', 'interesting', 'footage', 'including', 'first', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Diamond', 'Jubilee', '1897', 'was', '78-', 'current', 'Queen', 'was', '86', 'jubilee', 'can', 'be', 'boring', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'option', 'watching', 'segments']",The Diamond Queen

1530989,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B007HW8U2Y,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[11, 11]","This wonderful 3-part miniseries documentary at just under 3 hours is a splendor, an enjoyable look into the world and workings of Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of England. It has history galore with some background on her grandfather, King George V, her wily uncle the abdicated King Edward VIII (some good, salient points here but not heavy on the subject) and we are graced with some sprinkles of information about her father, King George VI.What I may consider a minor drawback is host/presenter Andrew Marr, mugging for the camera and talking excessively. Oh the life one leads!Yet this manages to be an engrossing, captivating and beautiful film. It has rare footage from that classified documentary THE ROYAL FAMILY which can only be seen by permission of Her Majesty. It has delicate minutes from the newer documentary ELIZABETH R, and plenty of footage showing us the Queen at more mundane work rather than the stock footage one usually sees.Rather funny were the moments Marr was narrating just feet away from the Queen; he followed her for (I think) 18 months to shoot this film, leapfrogging with her from Australia to Northern Ireland. Once in a while the Queen would look right into the camera, as if to say, ""Oh, I know YOU'RE there."" Funniest moment: when Marr and the Queen have a little accidental face-to-face. The Queen dryly says something about him being around all the time; Marr immediately apologizes for following her so long.That may have actually been the best moment of this great film. The Queen pretending not to really recall why Andrew Marr is such a hanger-on; Marr going all red and flustered, apologizing and reminding the Queen they are shooting a film. Though she obviously doesn't need reminding. It is a rare moment that exposes Her Majesty's true, warm and funny interior.This is a must for anyone interested in anything remotely non-fiction; it is a 100% must for Anglophiles and lovers of the Queen. There is really nothing like it. I have enjoyed and reviewed the astonishing documentary setThe Windsors/Bertie and Elizabeth, the snotty anti-monarchistThe Queen: Behind the Mask by Andrew Morton / Queen Elizabeth II, and the stunning but very datedDays of Majesty / Queen Elizabeth II. All are worthy each in its own way.Even the disappointing and misleadingMonarchy: The Royal Family at Workshould be in your collection.I say you are simply bonkers if you miss the chance to own DIAMOND QUEEN. By the way ... you won't see a minute of Her Majesty's actual Diamond Jubilee here because they were wrapping this up when the Jubilee was still in secret planning stages. All Marr does is mention it, a sort of future teaser.",5,God Save Her,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,2672,"['wonderful', '3-part', 'miniseries', 'documentary', 'just', '3', 'hours', 'splendor', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'world', 'workings', 'Her', 'Royal', 'Majesty', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'England', 'history', 'galore', 'background', 'grandfather', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'wily', 'uncle', 'abdicated', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'good', 'salient', 'points', 'here', 'not', 'heavy', 'subject', 'are', 'graced', 'sprinkles', 'information', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'VI.What', 'may', 'consider', 'minor', 'drawback', 'host/presenter', 'Andrew', 'Marr', 'mugging', 'camera', 'talking', 'excessively', 'Oh', 'life', 'one', 'be', 'engrossing', 'captivating', 'beautiful', 'film', 'rare', 'footage', 'classified', 'documentary', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'FAMILY', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'permission', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'delicate', 'minutes', 'newer', 'documentary', 'ELIZABETH', 'R', 'plenty', 'footage', 'showing', 'Queen', 'more', 'mundane', 'work', 'rather', 'stock', 'footage', 'one', 'usually', 'sees.Rather', 'funny', 'were', 'moments', 'Marr', 'was', 'narrating', 'just', 'feet', 'away', 'Queen', 'followed', 'think', '18', 'months', 'shoot', 'film', 'leapfrogging', 'Australia', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Once', 'Queen', 'would', 'look', 'right', 'camera', 'say', 'Oh', 'know', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'there', 'Funniest', 'moment', 'when', 'Marr', 'Queen', 'have', 'little', 'accidental', 'face-to-face', 'Queen', 'dryly', 'something', 'being', 'time', 'Marr', 'immediately', 'following', 'long.That', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'best', 'moment', 'great', 'film', 'Queen', 'pretending', 'not', 'really', 'recall', 'why', 'Andrew', 'Marr', 'such', 'hanger-on', 'Marr', 'going', 'red', 'flustered', 'apologizing', 'reminding', 'Queen', 'are', 'shooting', 'film', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'need', 'reminding', 'rare', 'moment', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'true', 'warm', 'funny', 'interior.This', 'must', 'anyone', 'interested', 'anything', 'remotely', 'non-fiction', '100', '%', 'must', 'Anglophiles', 'lovers', 'Queen', 'really', 'nothing', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'reviewed', 'astonishing', 'documentary', 'setThe', 'Windsors/Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'snotty', 'anti-monarchistThe', 'Queen', 'Mask', 'Andrew', 'Morton', '/', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'stunning', 'very', 'datedDays', 'Majesty', '/', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'are', 'worthy', 'own', 'way.Even', 'disappointing', 'misleadingMonarchy', 'Royal', 'Family', 'Workshould', 'be', 'collection.I', 'say', 'are', 'simply', 'bonkers', 'miss', 'chance', 'own', 'DIAMOND', 'QUEEN', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'minute', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'actual', 'Diamond', 'Jubilee', 'here', 'were', 'wrapping', 'up', 'when', 'Jubilee', 'was', 'still', 'secret', 'planning', 'stages', 'Marr', 'mention', 'sort', 'future', 'teaser']",The Diamond Queen

The BBC did an excellent job of presenting the life, influence, and impact of Elizabeth upon her nation and empire.  Beginning as a youth, Elizabeth knew her responsibility of being a Princess during World War II in Great Britain, and the morale that the royal family had to contribute to the British people and the Commonwealth.  Interviews of the royal family and their thoughts about their famous mother, grandmather, and aunt enhance this highly entertaining and interesting documentary.  Interesting films, inverviews, and narration make this a must get to anyone who is interested in the modern history of Great Britain, the royal family, and the life of this most excellent queen.  Rare films and interviews give the viewer a glimpse inside her personal life and influence such as her father King George VI, and Elizabeth The Queen Mother.  Queen Elizabeth II daughter Princess Anne gives a rare interview and talks about the influence of her mother, other members of the royal family in the interviews are unabashed with their praise upon this great Queen and her influence in their lifes and nation.  This outstanding documentary is just over three hours long and it makes you wish it had many more hours to learn about the queen.Elizabeth II has been queen of the British Nation for 60 years now and may she reign for many years more.

Her coronation was the first to be televised. She has had a Silver Jubilee. She was photographed and filmed when Princess Diana died and the marriages of all her children were performed and ended in divorce, except for Prince Edward. She saw her home, Windsor Castle burn. She has had a Golden Jubilee. She has survived all trials and triumphs to see her Diamond Jubilee.And she has done all of this with a quiet dignity, navigating the mistakes of her children, maintained the British Empire as Commonwealth, and is loved more now by her people than ever.This is a beautiful, loving film for a beautiful, beloved woman who just happens to be HM the Queen.",5,A Respectful and loving tribute to the Queen on her 60th  year,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,1428,"['loving', 'respectful', 'review', 'life', 'HM', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'cover', 'reign', '60', 'years', 'be', 'shorter', 'would', 'leave', 'out', 'many', 'significant', 'events', 'life', 'history', 'Britain', 'am', 'unabashed', 'royalist', 'when', 'watched', 'watched', 'three', 'hours', 'uninterrupted', 'average', 'audience', 'must', 'be', 'best', 'viewed', 'sections.Britain', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'monarchs', 'reach', 'Diamond', 'Jubilee', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'case', 'HM', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'photographed', 'birth', 'action', 'documented', 'pledge', 'British', 'people', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'heard', 'radio', 'commonwealth', 'photographed', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'photographed', 'bride', 'was', 'photographed', 'mother', 'coronation', 'was', 'first', 'be', 'televised', 'had', 'Silver', 'Jubilee', 'was', 'photographed', 'filmed', 'when', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'died', 'marriages', 'children', 'were', 'performed', 'ended', 'divorce', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'saw', 'home', 'Windsor', 'Castle', 'burn', 'had', 'Golden', 'Jubilee', 'survived', 'trials', 'triumphs', 'see', 'Diamond', 'Jubilee.And', 'done', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'navigating', 'mistakes', 'children', 'maintained', 'British', 'Empire', 'Commonwealth', 'loved', 'more', 'now', 'people', 'ever.This', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'film', 'beautiful', 'beloved', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'HM', 'Queen']",The Diamond Queen
