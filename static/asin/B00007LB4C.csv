731572,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007LB4C,A Customer,"[2, 2]","Summary:Matty Demaret (Barry Pepper) is the son of a New York mob boss who has been convinced he has no stomach for his father's line of work; mostly by his uncle, Teddy Deserve (John Malkovich).  Mobster children not having a stomach for the work is apparently as common as bananas in Central America, so this shouldn't be a big deal, but Matty still wants to work.  The problem is Matty's family name prevents him from finding work elsewhere.  Thus, the movie begins with him finally convincing both his father and his Uncle (who is his father's second in command) that he can handle a job for the 'organization' since it is only going to involve transporting something and not killing anyone.The mission is to transport some money from the Midwest back to New York.  The money is a loan from a friendly mob to help Matty's father as he plugs some of the holes in his operation (someone is stealing his money).  One of Matty's close friends, Johnny Marbles (Seth Green), is a pilot, and Matty gets him to make the run.  But on the way back to New York with the money, Johnny has to temporarily ditch it when he stops for gas at an airport to avoid the suspicion of some authorities.  When he returns for the bag of money, it's gone.Matty then gets two of his closest friends, Chris Scarpa (Andrew Davoli) and Taylor Reese (Vin Diesel) to join him and Johnny in podunk Montana to track down the money.  Two stereotyped skateboarder airline employees found the bag and have begun to treat themselves to some of the money.  But the father of one of the boys, Sheriff Decker (Tom Noonan), catches up with his son and finds the money.  Quickly realizing why Matty and his friends are in town, the Sheriff decides to split the money with his deputy and kill the Knockaround Guys (Matty and his friends).The Knockaround Guys, meanwhile, have begun employing mobster style tactics to get the money back, but Matty has also had to report to his father, resulting in his Uncle Teddy coming out to solve the problem.  When everything comes to a head, only Matty and Taylor walk away alive, but with the money.  And, as it turns out, Teddy was the one stealing from Matty's dad.My Comments:I guess this is supposed to be a new twist on the mobster story as the movie is about a bunch of mobster children discovering what it really means to be mobsters.  But novelty isn't enough to make for a good story.From the beginning the movie is riddled with problems.  Why would Matty's dad trust his son's junkie friend to transport $500,000 when he knows he's a recovering dopehead, and a scrawny one at that?  I wouldn't trust the guy with a rock, let alone half a million dollars. And if Matty's dad is virtually all-powerful, why doesn't he just put on a little pressure to get him a job somewhere?  Am I naive to think that might work?And then there's the whole Uncle Teddy embezzling from the father thing.  Maybe I was the only person that that hit from out of nowhere, but it sure seemed to me there was no set up for this twist.  One minute Uncle Teddy was a nice guy, the next he was stealing money from Matty's dad and had every intention of killing Matty himself.  It was absolutely unconvincing.  I'm thinking it was thrown in there just to make the movie interesting.  There are numerous other plot problems as well, including Scarpa deciding not to run and some very slow sequences while the Knockaround Guys are waiting for the sheriff to deal.As far as the acting goes, it wasn't terrible, but neither should it be up for any awards.  John Malkovich was a little unique, but I think it's just because he isn't standard mobster material.  Seth Green was silly, but hey, that's Seth Green.  The rest of the cast was bearable, except when they attempted to deliver philosophical monologues, which just don't seem right coming from someone like Vin Diesel.Overall, the movie is watchable but not recommended.  It's slow, full of plot holes, and not particularly surprising or interesting.  I might recommend it for Vin Diesel or John Malkovich fans, but everyone else should stay away.",2,A coming of age mobster movie?,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,4080,"['Summary', 'Matty', 'Demaret', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'son', 'New', 'York', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'been', 'convinced', 'stomach', 'father', 'line', 'work', 'mostly', 'uncle', 'Teddy', 'Deserve', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Mobster', 'children', 'not', 'having', 'stomach', 'work', 'apparently', 'as', 'common', 'bananas', 'Central', 'America', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'Matty', 'still', 'work', 'problem', 'Matty', 'family', 'name', 'finding', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'Thus', 'movie', 'finally', 'convincing', 'father', 'Uncle', 'who', 'father', 'second', 'command', 'can', 'handle', 'job', ""'organization"", 'only', 'going', 'involve', 'transporting', 'something', 'not', 'killing', 'anyone.The', 'mission', 'transport', 'money', 'Midwest', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'money', 'loan', 'friendly', 'mob', 'help', 'Matty', 'father', 'holes', 'operation', 'someone', 'stealing', 'money', 'One', 'Matty', 'close', 'friends', 'Johnny', 'Marbles', 'Seth', 'Green', 'pilot', 'Matty', 'make', 'run', 'way', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'money', 'Johnny', 'temporarily', 'ditch', 'when', 'gas', 'airport', 'avoid', 'suspicion', 'authorities', 'When', 'bag', 'money', 'gone.Matty', 'then', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'Chris', 'Scarpa', 'Andrew', 'Davoli', 'Taylor', 'Reese', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'join', 'Johnny', 'podunk', 'Montana', 'track', 'down', 'money', 'Two', 'stereotyped', 'skateboarder', 'airline', 'employees', 'found', 'bag', 'have', 'begun', 'treat', 'money', 'father', 'one', 'boys', 'Sheriff', 'Decker', 'Tom', 'Noonan', 'up', 'son', 'money', 'Quickly', 'realizing', 'why', 'Matty', 'friends', 'are', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'split', 'money', 'deputy', 'kill', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'Matty', 'friends', '.The', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'begun', 'employing', 'mobster', 'style', 'tactics', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'Matty', 'also', 'had', 'report', 'father', 'resulting', 'Uncle', 'Teddy', 'coming', 'out', 'solve', 'problem', 'When', 'everything', 'head', 'only', 'Matty', 'Taylor', 'walk', 'away', 'alive', 'money', 'out', 'Teddy', 'was', 'one', 'stealing', 'Matty', 'dad.My', 'Comments', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'new', 'twist', 'mobster', 'story', 'movie', 'bunch', 'mobster', 'children', 'discovering', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'mobsters', 'novelty', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'story.From', 'beginning', 'movie', 'riddled', 'problems', 'Why', 'would', 'Matty', 'dad', 'trust', 'son', 'junkie', 'friend', 'transport', '500,000', 'when', 'recovering', 'dopehead', 'scrawny', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'trust', 'guy', 'rock', 'let', 'alone', 'million', 'dollars', 'Matty', 'dad', 'virtually', 'all-powerful', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'little', 'pressure', 'get', 'job', 'somewhere', 'Am', 'naive', 'think', 'might', 'work', 'then', 'whole', 'Uncle', 'Teddy', 'embezzling', 'father', 'thing', 'Maybe', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'hit', 'nowhere', 'sure', 'seemed', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'twist', 'One', 'minute', 'Uncle', 'Teddy', 'was', 'nice', 'guy', 'next', 'was', 'stealing', 'money', 'Matty', 'dad', 'had', 'intention', 'killing', 'Matty', 'was', 'absolutely', 'unconvincing', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'was', 'thrown', 'there', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'interesting', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'plot', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Scarpa', 'deciding', 'not', 'run', 'very', 'slow', 'sequences', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'are', 'waiting', 'sheriff', 'deal.As', 'far', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'awards', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'little', 'unique', 'think', 'just', ""n't"", 'standard', 'mobster', 'material', 'Seth', 'Green', 'was', 'silly', 'hey', 'Seth', 'Green', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'bearable', 'when', 'attempted', 'deliver', 'philosophical', 'monologues', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'coming', 'someone', 'Vin', 'Diesel.Overall', 'movie', 'watchable', 'not', 'recommended', 'slow', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'not', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'might', 'recommend', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'fans', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'stay', 'away']",Knockaround Guys

And it doesn't disappoint. Barry Pepper gives a great performance. Vin Diesel actually acts in this movie, rather than just relying on his size and 'action-hero' status. Seth Green's performance is uneven, but more often than not he plays his role (as an unlikeable guy) very well. Dennis Hopper plays Benny Chains, the mob underboss. There's nothing spectacular about his performance, but it is solid. John Malkovich is brilliant, even if his accent is not. Tom Noonan is the breakout star here. He plays his role as a crooked sherrif great (and very dark). This is Brian Koppelman and David Levien's first time at directing, and they also wrote the film (Lawrence Bender produced it). All in all, it is a pretty good movie. Well worth seeing. It's a mafia movie that is both what we expect and something new.

Goodfellas is too talky and it drags in some parts where as this movie has way more action and not one part that bores you. Barry Pepper did a great job as Matty Demerest, the son of legendary mob boss Benny Chains, who is played brilliantly by the very versatile Dennis Hopper. Matty is in a business filled with stone-cold killers and thieves but he is more of a good guy mobster and aspires for a brighter and better future. As far as Dennis Hopper, his performance in this movie has elevated him to the level of Pacino and De Niro. John Malkovic shows off his versatility as Uncle Teddy and further adds on another top-notch performance to his legacy. Seth Green as Johnny Marbles is the least responsible of the four guys trying to retrieve a missing bag filled with two million dollars and does more than enough to anger the other guys. Andrew Divoli did a great job as Scarpa, a man trying to go straight but the temptation of being a big time mobster is what makes him stay in the business. And Vin Diesel as Taylor turns in another top-notch performance. It shows how great Vin Diesel really is as an actor. He's also some-what of a good guy saving Matty's life twice despite being in the same business as Chains and Teddy and the part when he beats up that guy in the bar shows that you can't mess with The Diesel. Ok so there might not be as much action as you expect but it's spur of the moment action and the movie flows well.

731577,A2S0DU8QTQSKWK,B00007LB4C,Brendon Spencer,"[1, 2]","Ok, let's face it. I got it to look at Diesel in the tight t-shirt, which in my humble opinion, is a darn good reason for renting the thing if nothing else.On the other hand, there may be those who want more in a movie: a plot, good actors, action, etc. You're in luck. This movie has that, too. You not only have greats Dennis Hopper and John Malkovich, but also some young men who definately will be greats in their own time, like Barry Pepper, Andrew Devoli, Seth Green, and the reason I bought the flick -- Vin Diesel.Matty (Barry Pepper), convinced as a child that he was not ""up"" to being a mobster, has been trying to get a straight job but keeps getting shot down because his father is the infamous Benny Chains (Dennis Hopper). My first thought here was ""Why not move to another state where folks have no idea who Benny Chains is?"", which was the reaction in a small Montana town but I guess that would have killed the story.Anyway, he finally convinces Dad to trust him with a money delievery which goes very wrong. His pal, Marbles (Seth Green), gets paniced and loses the money bag. (Knowing Marbles was a former junkie, why didn't Matty go with him?) Matty is desperate to get the bag back and enlists help from a couple of friends, Chris Scarpa (Andrew Davoli), and Taylor Reese (Vin Diesel).PLOT SPOILER -I'm editing here after the rebulk from someone about this part. I've apologized...  Now -- I'm not a Seth Green fan. However, his death scene was absolutely wonderful. I was surprised at how he handled it. He did as much with simple expressions as some actors could with a page full of lines. Very well done.  Vin Diesel seems to do better in movies (Pitch Black aside) where he is not the main character. As a backup he is consistantly very good. No exception here. He is the bad boy in the group. (In his first scene no one ever explained WHY he bashed in his own machines before roughing up the owner of the store. Seemed pointless to me...)  Onward.  THE FIGHT SCENE.  In order to get information they decide they need to find out who the toughest guy in town is, beat the crap out of him, and take it from there. They find the guy who isn't the least bit afraid of them. As he and Diesel stand nose to nose, Vin takes off his jacket (once my breathing normalized I noticed the bad guy had much the same reaction as myself!) and starts his ""500 fights"" monologue. This is obviously a psychological ploy to get the bad guys thinking and nervous. It works. Then Diesel beats the crap out of him.The road to the money gets rockier as time goes on, resulting in a good action climax.The movie isn't flawless, but some of the acting definately was. Not a bad actor in the bunch, good action, decent plot.

731584,AY12DBB0U420B,B00007LB4C,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","The bargain-rack movie for last night was the ""Knockaround Guys"" DVD. It was an interesting movie involving the offspring of a big-time mob member. Barry Pepper played the son and Dennis Hopper played the father. The son didn't seem to be up to what it took to be a mob member but was given a task in which he might prove himself. He was to manage the transport of a satchel of money (about a half million bucks) from the source to the boss and his friend had a private plane in which could do it. Well, the plane had to land for a fuel stop in a small Montana town and the task became infinitely more complicated by the satchel getting stolen by a couple young punks. Hence, a call for help to find and rescue the satchel and the later arrival of three mob-related friends to help out. At this point we got into the dynamics of eastern mob tough guys (one was Vin Diesel) pitted against the local wild-west tough guys, including a couple crooked cops. It was an interesting match-up involving a lot of violence and ultimately death for most of the participants.The movie was well done. The acting was good. The photography and scenery of the set was good. The action was well paced and boredom had no chance to set in. The assorted violence was, well, violent. I wouldn't put ""Knockaround Guys"" among the top-rated movies to watch, but it was quite worthwhile.Gary Peterson",4,Interesting Movie.

731590,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00007LB4C,Joseph Haschka,"[8, 9]","In my days at a young age, a pre-teen boy might simply aspire to a Scout merit badge. In KNOCKAROUND GUYS, 11 year-old Matty has already demonstrated to his father, Benny Chains (Dennis Hopper), that he doesn't have what it takes to join the Old Man's business. Benny is a Chicago Mafia kingpin. So, by the time the boy's a young man (now played by Barry Pepper), he's completely without direction. Matty has long accepted the fact that he hasn't got what it takes to work for and impress Dad, and he can't seem to land a legit 9 to 5. So, now what?Then, opportunity knocks. Benny needs a handbag picked up at the Spokane airport and brought back to the Windy City. Matty begs for, and receives, the assignment. Rather than go himself, he gets his friend, Johnny Marbles (Seth Green), to fly his Beechcraft to Washington to make the connection. Marbles, who has the reputation for being a screw-up, is also a mobster's drifting kid. On his return flight, Johnny manages to lose the bag - filled with $500,000 - on a gas stop at the tiny airport that serves Wibaux, Montana. (Yes, Mabel, there really is a Wibaux - on Interstate 84 just west of the North Dakota state line.)Matty and two other discontented pals of Mob lineage, the dapper Chris (Andrew Davoli) and tough guy Taylor (Vin Diesel), arrive to help recover the dough before Benny goes ballistic. That's when things really go into the toilet.KNOCKAROUND GUYS is a coming-of-age story with a twist (albeit at an unusually late age for such Hollywood fairy tales). Part of the film's attraction can perhaps be traced to the viewing public's current love affair with such murderous offerings as THE SOPRANOS. Certain scenes in KNOCKAROUND GUYS are decidedly violent. And then there's the challenge of perceiving any of the main characters as likable enough to root for, much less invite home for Thanksgiving dinner. Perhaps we should instead be looking for personae of interest. Taylor and Teddy are the most watchable. Vin Diesel as the former is more substantial in a supporting role than his ""XXX"" lead. Taylor's just a buffed-up, uneducated, street-smart brawler. But, he's intensely loyal to Matty, and has no illusions about how he's wasted his life to the present. John Malkovich is mesmerizingly venomous as the psychopathic Teddy, Benny's right-hand Good Fella. There's one delicious scene in which Teddy bemoans the fact that, whereas before a hit man could just get the job done, now one has to be concerned with everybody's feelings.After viewing KNOCKAROUND GUYS, I was mildly surprised to realize that there was no actress in either a lead or significantly supporting role. There's no romance here. Not even any vaguely warm and touchy-feely moments.

Barry Pepper plays ""Matty,"" the drifting son of a major mobster, ""Benny The Chain"" (underplayed nicely by Dennis Hopper) who is looking for an entree into the life for lack of anything else to anchor himself.  The Chain is convinced that his son is incompetent, and by and large his predictions are borne out by the film's storyline. Matty's uncle (played by John Malkovich) is the younger man's champion, and ultimate ace in the hole.As a dry run, Matty is asked to arrange the transfer of a duffel bag containing payola from the west coast to the east. To do the job Matty hires his addled friend ""Marbles"" (Seth Green in an appropriately dazed role) to fly the bag back to New York. On a refueling stop in Onehorsetown Montana, Marbles of course promptly loses the bag to a pair of teenage skatepunks, one of whom happens to be the local Sheriff's son. Matty and his crew (Brooklyn accents and all) are forced to drive to Montana to reclaim their money and settle the score with the of-course corrupt Sheriff, who decides that a half-million dollars cold cash would make a nice retirement fund.The film plays off well on the Small Town versus Big City elements, including a brief but intense bar fight scene between the town tough guy (""Cat"" hat and all) and Vin Diesel who plays Taylor, a half-Jewish enforcer.

In the course of trying to prove their worth to the ""knockaround guys i.e. the mob they mess up a money pickup. This puts the mob father and uncle of Matty (one of the young guys) in a cross with the big boss. Now everyone is trying to get the money: the mob, the young men trying to prove themselves, corrupt small town sheriffs, and some inane skateboard stoners.The story is an interesting study of relationships corrupted by greed and stupidity. But it is more interesting for the juxtiposition of genuine friendship/loyalty as measured against the often bogus devotion of blood family ties and business associations. The performances are uniformly terrific-even the lesser roles. However Vin Diesel really stands out as the intelligent strong arm who believes he is out of options for himself but offers to let Matty avoid the showdown which promises to be lethal. He owns every scene in which he appears, not just because of his physical presence but because of his quiet intensity. You can believe that this is more than a talented actor reciting lines.If you prefer highly intellectual movies this will not be your cup of tea.

This film has taken a lot of flak from a lot of sides, and some of it justifiably; they should have left the direction to John Dahl (Rounders) again, because we ended up with a number of above-average performances in a mess of a movie.Matty Demaret (emerging star Barry Pepper, recently in 25th Hour and We Were Soldiers) is the kid of a mob boss known as Benny Chains (Dennis Hopper). He wants to live a normal life, but as soon as anyone hears he's a mob boss' kid, they shy away. So his only real option is to become a mob kid. Unfortunately, he tried that at thirteen and failed miserably. But he convinces his father to give him one more chance; he has to go pick up a bag of cash in Seattle and get it to New York City. He subcontracts out the job to his friend Johnny Marbles (Seth Green), who manages to lose the bag when stopping for gas in the nowhere town of Wibeaux, Montana. Matty and his friends Taylor (Vin Diesel, in what would have been his second big-screen appearance had the movie been released on time) and Chris (Andrew Davoli of Welcome to Collinwood fame) go to Wibeaux to help Marbles (Chris' brother, by the way) retrieve the money, all the while being told by Benny and Benny's right hand man Teddy (John Malkovich, reprising his Rounders role as Teddy KGB right down to the accent) that if they don't get this bag back pronto, the whole lot of them are going to be rubbed out.Let's face it, when your main characters include Diesel, Pepper, Green, Hopper, and Malkovich, you're bound to get some good roles. Diesel, especially, is worthwhile here; his ""aesthetics of fighting"" monologue doesn't have the emotional resonance of the ""Raisin in the Sun"" monologue of Multi-Facial, but the delivery is easily on a par. Pepper and Green play their Reservoir-Dogs-esque roles capably, though as the film progresses the roles themselves get more ludicrous. Malkovich has the same quiet menace here that he did in Rounders, but the role is overexposed (it was done perfectly in the former movie). Etc. The plot pretty much falls apart after Marbles loses the money, though; the directors didn't seem sure if they wanted to make a Reservoir Dogs-style comedy or a Lifetime Original Movie coming-of-age drama. The hybrid of the two does not a real barnburner make. See it if you're a fan of any of the principals, but most of the rest of anyone will be wondering what that mess was. **",2,"Great acting, but little else.",1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,2637,"['Knockaround', 'Guys', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'David', 'Levien', '1999', 'Koppelman', 'Levien', 'writers', 'brilliant', 'Rounders', 'not-so-brilliant', 'Runaway', 'Jury', 'take', 'first', 'date', 'last', 'helming', 'job', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'film', 'taken', 'lot', 'flak', 'lot', 'sides', 'justifiably', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'direction', 'John', 'Dahl', 'Rounders', 'again', 'ended', 'up', 'number', 'above-average', 'performances', 'mess', 'movie.Matty', 'Demaret', 'emerging', 'star', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'recently', '25th', 'Hour', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'kid', 'mob', 'boss', 'known', 'Benny', 'Chains', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'as', 'soon', 'anyone', 'mob', 'boss', 'kid', 'shy', 'away', 'So', 'only', 'real', 'option', 'become', 'mob', 'kid', 'Unfortunately', 'tried', 'thirteen', 'failed', 'miserably', 'father', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'bag', 'cash', 'Seattle', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'out', 'job', 'friend', 'Johnny', 'Marbles', 'Seth', 'Green', 'who', 'lose', 'bag', 'when', 'stopping', 'gas', 'nowhere', 'town', 'Wibeaux', 'Montana', 'Matty', 'friends', 'Taylor', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'second', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'time', 'Chris', 'Andrew', 'Davoli', 'Welcome', 'Collinwood', 'fame', 'go', 'Wibeaux', 'help', 'Marbles', 'Chris', 'brother', 'way', 'retrieve', 'money', 'while', 'being', 'told', 'Benny', 'Benny', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Teddy', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'reprising', 'Rounders', 'role', 'Teddy', 'KGB', 'right', 'down', 'accent', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bag', 'back', 'pronto', 'whole', 'lot', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'rubbed', 'face', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'include', 'Diesel', 'Pepper', 'Green', 'Hopper', 'Malkovich', ""'re"", 'bound', 'get', 'good', 'roles', 'Diesel', 'especially', 'worthwhile', 'here', 'aesthetics', 'fighting', 'monologue', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'monologue', 'Multi-Facial', 'delivery', 'easily', 'par', 'Pepper', 'Green', 'play', 'Reservoir-Dogs-esque', 'roles', 'capably', 'film', 'roles', 'get', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'Malkovich', 'same', 'quiet', 'menace', 'here', 'did', 'Rounders', 'role', 'overexposed', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'former', 'movie', 'Etc', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'falls', 'apart', 'Marbles', 'money', 'though', 'directors', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sure', 'wanted', 'make', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs-style', 'comedy', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'hybrid', 'two', 'not', 'real', 'barnburner', 'make', 'See', ""'re"", 'fan', 'principals', 'most', 'rest', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'mess', 'was', '**']",Knockaround Guys

Amazingly versatile Barry Pepper finally gets a starring role as Matty Demaret, son of mob-leader Benny Chains (expertly played by Dennis Hopper).  Matty wants to make something of his life outside his father's influence, but just can't seem to infiltrate the straight world, once everyone finds out about his family ties.Finally deciding to prove himself to his father, he takes on the important task of picking up a pay-drop for Benny, enlisting the help of his street friends, Taylor Reese (Vin Diesel) Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) and Chris Scarpa (Andrew Davoli).  Marbles has a pilot's license, but also an unfortunate drug habit too, so when Marbles looses the bag of money in a po-dunk Montana airport, Matty and the rest of his gang head to Montana to ferret out the money.But even as Matty and his friends discover a way to break through the thin crust of the small town community, Matty's uncle Teddy Deserve (played by the incomparable John Malkovich) heads to town also to take care of the fumbled operation himself.  Standing in their way is Sheriff Decker, (Tom Noonan from Manhunter) who sees himself as a match for the gang of young mobsters.Get ready for some spectacular acting from an incredible cast, each character seemingly cut from the finest cloth of the actor's abilities.  Watch for Barry Pepper's unruffled leadership, Vin Diesel's quiet and confident strength, Andrew Davoli's ladies-man charm, Seth Green's hyper twitchiness, John Malkovich's impeccably articulated evil, Tom Noonan's concealed danger, and Dennis Hopper's disdainful arrogance.Add to this mix a laid-back soundtrack that adds a casual menace to the overall feeling of the film, and you have a movie that is definitely worth a purchase.  The use of quiet trepidation over typical gangster style machinegun parties is what separates this modern mob movie from the rest of the wiseguy clones.  Not to mention that the shadier side of the law looks better than the side dappled with the light of a badge.  Definitely, a not-to-be-missed film.

Aside from someone getting killed near the end of the film, this is a film with a sense of humor.Vin Diesel, Barry Pepper, Seth Green, and Dennis Hopper give good performances. This is a light film that doesn't take a lot of thought to get, which is okay.Without going into a plot synopsis (I'm not going to explain something you can see for yourself), I will say that the story unfolds after Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) misplaces a valuable item earmarked for delivery to the New York mob at an airport in Montana. A contingency from New York headed by of Pepper and Diesel appear and set out in search of the lost item. They do this by first finding the biggest badass in the town and then proceed to beat the cr*p out of him.It sounds like pretty half-baked idea, but then, the story continues to unfold. In the end, there's a little plot twist. One little thing about the movie I thought was cool was that they showed guys - some of the characters - playing handball in the courts outside Central Park. At the end of the film, the Malkovich character has a few things to say about losing at handball (and how much he doesn't like losing) at the end of the film.

731614,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00007LB4C,Todd Smith,"[1, 3]","Why would anyone watch a movie that features Seth Green as a gangster or any movie with Vin Diesel for that matter? Personally, I had very little interest in this film, but I wanted to see it because of John Malkovich. He is so funny and no one plays the bad guy, better than he does. As always, Malkovich was brilliant, in an otherwise awful movie. Knockaround Guys is the story of four gangster's kids, who are tired of being nobodies, and decide it's time to make a score of their own. A score that they manage to royally screw up. It's a good premise for a movie and it was written pretty well. They did a great job casting veteran actors like Malkovich and Dennis Hopper to play the crime bosses, but they really blew it when it came to casting their kids. Seth Green isn't believable at all, seriously, I think the little kid in the beginning of the movie could kick his ass. They try to cover up the fact that he doesn't fit the role by making him a drug addict, but it doesn't work out. Vin Diesel is another one, he may be terrific in crazy action films that hardly have any lines, but when the role is something of substance, and requires a personality, Diesel is the last person who should be cast. He is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but there is a bright side. When Arnold Schwarzenegger first started acting, he was pretty terrible too, but after gaining some experience, he blossomed into a superstar, who gave us some great films. I hope the same can be said about Diesel in a few years, until then, unless you're a die hard John Malkovich fan, you can avoid seeing this giant mess of a film.",1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1618,"['Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'watch', 'movie', 'Seth', 'Green', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'matter', 'Personally', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'so', 'funny', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'better', 'always', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'brilliant', 'otherwise', 'awful', 'movie', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'story', 'four', 'gangster', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'tired', 'being', 'nobodies', 'decide', 'time', 'make', 'score', 'own', 'score', 'manage', 'royally', 'screw', 'up', 'good', 'premise', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'pretty', 'well', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'casting', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Malkovich', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'play', 'crime', 'bosses', 'really', 'blew', 'when', 'came', 'casting', 'kids', 'Seth', 'Green', ""n't"", 'believable', 'seriously', 'think', 'little', 'kid', 'beginning', 'movie', 'could', 'kick', 'ass', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'making', 'drug', 'addict', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'terrific', 'crazy', 'action', 'films', 'hardly', 'have', 'lines', 'when', 'role', 'something', 'substance', 'personality', 'Diesel', 'last', 'person', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'cast', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'bright', 'side', 'When', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'first', 'started', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'too', 'gaining', 'experience', 'blossomed', 'superstar', 'who', 'gave', 'great', 'films', 'hope', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Diesel', 'few', 'years', 'then', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'fan', 'can', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'giant', 'mess', 'film']",Knockaround Guys

731616,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007LB4C,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Though Vin Diesel would (naturally) attract the attention of the most viewers, he is just one of the great ensemble cast in this decent gangster film.  The director team Brian Koppelman/David Levien is also the writer duo of Matt Damon's &quot;Rounders.&quot;  Like &quot;Rounders,&quot; &quot;Knockaround Guys&quot; is atmospheric, and greatly helped by the uniformly good performance from the players though it ultimately goes on the beaten road.The film starts just like an average gangster film; a boy Matty is tested by older member of the family Teddy, who forces the little kid to kill a guy.  Then, cue to the present day, in which we see the grown-up Matty Demaret (Barry Pepper).  He wants a job, but constantly refused because of his father (Dennis Hopper), the famous boss of the gangsters.To prove that he deserves some respect from his father, Matty takes a job of carrying a bag which should never be lost ... but his friend Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) loses it in the middle of Montana.  Matty, Johnny, and two other friends (Vin Diesel and Andrew Davoli) of him fly to the place, only to find that the things are more complicated than they first thought.The clever touch is given to the rather familiar plot by changing the location from New York to Montana, adding the flavor of Western film.  In fact, the local sheriff perfectly played by Tom Noonan turns out what is more than these guys expected, sly and determined to get what he wants, kind of character you see in old Western films.  In addition, the boys have to handle John Malkovich's Teddy, whose threatening presence can be felt from thousand miles away.What is most impressive is the acting of the cast.  If you remember Barry Pepper as the hero of the ill-fated &quot;Battlefield Earth,&quot; it is time to forget that bomb.  He is superb as the leading character who knows what he wants to do, but cannot because of his flawed personality.  Vin Diesel is the same Vin (which is a compliment), whose macho personality gives a fascinating contrast to Barry Pepper.  John Malkovich is as creepy as ever, but our special mention must go to Seth Green, whose appearance in Mike Myers's films tend to typecast him.  He is also great as a natural-born loser Johnny, who we are sure is going to fail in the end.  And he does.&quot;Knockaround Guys&quot; is certainly derivative and clithed, but at least shows that the actors involved clearly know how to be the characters they play.  And it is that acting that really counts.",4,Another Gangster Film That Shows Great Ensemble Cast,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,2501,"['Vin', 'Diesel', 'would', 'naturally', 'attract', 'attention', 'most', 'viewers', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'decent', 'gangster', 'film', 'director', 'team', 'Brian', 'Koppelman/David', 'Levien', 'also', 'writer', 'duo', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'quot', 'Rounders.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rounders', 'quot', 'quot', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'quot', 'atmospheric', 'greatly', 'helped', 'uniformly', 'good', 'performance', 'players', 'ultimately', 'beaten', 'road.The', 'film', 'just', 'average', 'gangster', 'film', 'boy', 'Matty', 'tested', 'older', 'member', 'family', 'Teddy', 'who', 'little', 'kid', 'kill', 'guy', 'Then', 'cue', 'present', 'day', 'see', 'grown-up', 'Matty', 'Demaret', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'job', 'constantly', 'refused', 'father', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'famous', 'boss', 'gangsters.To', 'prove', 'respect', 'father', 'Matty', 'job', 'carrying', 'bag', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'lost', 'friend', 'Johnny', 'Marbles', 'Seth', 'Green', 'middle', 'Montana', 'Matty', 'Johnny', 'two', 'other', 'friends', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Andrew', 'Davoli', 'fly', 'place', 'only', 'find', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'thought.The', 'clever', 'touch', 'given', 'rather', 'familiar', 'plot', 'changing', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'Montana', 'adding', 'flavor', 'Western', 'film', 'fact', 'local', 'sheriff', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Tom', 'Noonan', 'out', 'what', 'more', 'guys', 'expected', 'sly', 'determined', 'get', 'what', 'kind', 'character', 'see', 'old', 'Western', 'films', 'addition', 'boys', 'have', 'handle', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Teddy', 'threatening', 'presence', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away.What', 'most', 'impressive', 'acting', 'cast', 'remember', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'hero', 'ill-fated', 'quot', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'quot', 'time', 'forget', 'bomb', 'superb', 'leading', 'character', 'who', 'what', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'flawed', 'personality', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'same', 'Vin', 'compliment', 'macho', 'personality', 'fascinating', 'contrast', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'as', 'creepy', 'ever', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Seth', 'Green', 'appearance', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'films', 'tend', 'typecast', 'also', 'great', 'natural-born', 'loser', 'Johnny', 'who', 'are', 'sure', 'going', 'fail', 'end', 'quot', 'Knockaround', 'Guys', 'quot', 'certainly', 'derivative', 'clithed', 'least', 'shows', 'actors', 'involved', 'clearly', 'know', 'how', 'be', 'characters', 'play', 'acting', 'really']",Knockaround Guys

This was a very interesting look at the Mob, which in my opinion differs from many other people.  It's a side that I have never seen from the Mob before, but of course I haven't seen a lot of Mob movies.  The characters were dynamic and had some life to them, which is a must.Barry Pepper did a brilliant job as a Mob Boss's semi exiled son.  John Malchovich was not terrible by any means, which is another opinion that I have that many others do not agree with.  He had a sort of swagger to him and power that really made him fascinating to watch.The movie definitely wasn't about Vin Diesel and I didn't expect it to be about him, and I really didn't want it to either.  Maybe this wasn't Vin's blockbuster role, but it was quite effective.  He was a little stiff, but it by no means lessened the quality of the movie.  Seth Green was the comedic relief, but he wasn't overbearing, which is good.  Dennis Hopper was worthless however, and I could have done without him.  He brought no spark to his character and that aspect of the movie left me out in the cold.The directing was fantastic and the music really added to the movie superbly.  Many film directors do not think music is an important part of a movie, but it really is.
