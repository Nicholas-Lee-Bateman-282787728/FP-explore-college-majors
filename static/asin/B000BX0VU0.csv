It is a great show that portrays hope, life, relationships, and emotions in each episode. I am glad that this show is finally releasing on DVD, as we can get to watch the series from the beginning.The story mainly revolves around Dr. Lu Delgado and Dr. Dana Stowe, two women who have nothing in common with each other, except for their passions in the field of work. They work in the Rittenhouse Women's Health Clinic, where they face new challenges, and solve new problems from performing plastic surgery to treating HIV positive patients.

Developed by Whoopi Goldberg and created by Tammy Ader, `Strong Medicine' has won numerous awards. Rosa Blasi (who plays Dr. Lu Delgado) won an Imagen Award for Best Actress in a Drama series.
