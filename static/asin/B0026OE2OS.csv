That being said, I purchased the DVD in the hopes that it would have some good footage from the 60's and 70's that would add to my archives of NFL Films material that I already have.  Needless to say, I was very happy with the purchase that I made here.  Great background material on the Bills during their formative AFL years, and the link that both the team and the owner had with the Detroit Lions of the NFL.  In addition, the interviews with Lou Saban, Billy Shaw and the coverage provided to the Bills championship teams of the mid-60's were equally enjoyable.  And as can be expected, a great deal of coverage was spent on the OJ Simpson years, as well as the Bills run in the late 80's, early 90's.  What made this DVD get 5-stars though was the bonus features of the NFL ""Missing Rings"" episode of the 1990 Bills, along with the AFC Playoff game comeback against the Houston Oilers.  Those two items were worth adding to my library alone.  The other ""extras"" contained segments on Bob Kalsu and Marv Levy as well.Would I have purchased this DVD at full price?  Probably not, as I managed to find a new copy for about $5.00.  But if you are a Buffalo Bills fan and looking to add to your collection, know that much of the material presented here was not a bunch of recycled material from old NFL DVD's or VHS reels from before.  For that, I give NFL Films kudos on the compliation that they came up with here.",5,"Not what you would call a Bills fan, but the DVD is worth purchasing.",1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1522,"['title', 'states', ""'m"", 'not', 'what', 'would', 'label', 'Buffalo', 'Bills', 'fan', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'being', 'said', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'hopes', 'would', 'have', 'good', 'footage', '60', '70', 'would', 'add', 'archives', 'NFL', 'Films', 'material', 'already', 'have', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'purchase', 'made', 'here', 'Great', 'background', 'material', 'Bills', 'formative', 'AFL', 'years', 'link', 'team', 'owner', 'had', 'Detroit', 'Lions', 'NFL', 'addition', 'interviews', 'Lou', 'Saban', 'Billy', 'Shaw', 'coverage', 'provided', 'Bills', 'championship', 'teams', 'mid-60', 'were', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'great', 'deal', 'coverage', 'was', 'spent', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'Bills', 'run', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'What', 'made', 'DVD', 'get', '5-stars', 'though', 'was', 'bonus', 'features', 'NFL', 'Missing', 'Rings', 'episode', '1990', 'Bills', 'AFC', 'Playoff', 'game', 'comeback', 'Houston', 'Oilers', 'two', 'items', 'were', 'worth', 'adding', 'library', 'alone', 'other', 'extras', 'contained', 'segments', 'Bob', 'Kalsu', 'Marv', 'Levy', 'well.Would', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'full', 'price', 'Probably', 'not', 'managed', 'find', 'new', 'copy', '5.00', 'are', 'Buffalo', 'Bills', 'fan', 'looking', 'add', 'collection', 'know', 'much', 'material', 'presented', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'bunch', 'recycled', 'material', 'old', 'NFL', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'reels', 'before', 'give', 'NFL', 'Films', 'kudos', 'compliation', 'came', 'up', 'here']",NFL: History of the Buffalo Bills
