1067918,A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y,B000P0J0GA,Sonja,"[4, 10]","I have two main problems with this video.  First of all, the name of this DVD:  ""Wolves: A Legend Returns to Yellowstone"" implies that these wolves (which are named the Druid Peak pack) are the first to be introduced to the park.  But about halfway through the DVD, the Druid Peak pack starts regularly encountering another larger wolf pack (the Rose Creek Pack).  Um, where did they come from if the Druid Peak pack was the first and presumably only?  Of course, now I no longer presume they were the only ones.  I guess they brought several packs into Yellowstone around the same time.  That all that makes sense, but I don't understand why they didn't just say that and add, ""We had to choose one pack to document, and we've decided on the Druid Peak pack.""My second issue is about some of the violence in the movie.  Yes, I know it's a nature documentary, and animals kill and hurt each other.  I've seen a lot of nature documentaries.  I'm okay with the whole circle of life stuff.  But this documentary showed a lot of violence between the wolves themselves and other predators.  Maybe part of my problem was that wolves and dogs are so closely related, so when they showed this scene of four or five wolves descending on a coyote (who was scavenging off of one of the wolves' abandoned kills) and then basically tearing the coyote apart, I felt a little nauseous.  Also, the end of the movie shows a wolf who had been attacked and mauled by the other wolves of her pack.  The narrator tells us that she dies from her wounds.  It was a bit more than I had bargained for, especially since the wolf that dies at the end was one of the major ""characters"" throughout the documentary.I got this documentary primarily for my 5 year old, who is very interested in wolves.  We had rented the documentaryWolves (IMAX)a year ago, which is also about wolves returned to Yellowstone.  I liked that film, and I thought that was what I was ordering.  When we started watching this and I realized it was different, I thought it was no big deal:  same animal, same topic, after all.  But now I think that ""Wolve (IMAX)"" is more suited to younger viewers.",3,seems like there's missing info and it's a bit too gruesome for me,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,2144,"['have', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'video', 'First', 'all', 'name', 'DVD', 'Wolves', 'Legend', 'Returns', 'Yellowstone', 'implies', 'wolves', 'are', 'named', 'Druid', 'Peak', 'pack', 'are', 'first', 'be', 'introduced', 'park', 'halfway', 'DVD', 'Druid', 'Peak', 'pack', 'regularly', 'encountering', 'larger', 'wolf', 'pack', 'Rose', 'Creek', 'Pack', 'Um', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'Druid', 'Peak', 'pack', 'was', 'first', 'presumably', 'only', 'course', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'presume', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'guess', 'brought', 'several', 'packs', 'Yellowstone', 'same', 'time', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'add', 'had', 'choose', 'one', 'pack', 'document', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'Druid', 'Peak', 'pack', 'second', 'issue', 'violence', 'movie', 'Yes', 'know', 'nature', 'documentary', 'animals', 'kill', 'hurt', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'nature', 'documentaries', ""'m"", 'okay', 'whole', 'circle', 'life', 'stuff', 'documentary', 'showed', 'lot', 'violence', 'wolves', 'other', 'predators', 'Maybe', 'part', 'problem', 'was', 'wolves', 'dogs', 'are', 'so', 'closely', 'related', 'so', 'when', 'showed', 'scene', 'four', 'five', 'wolves', 'descending', 'coyote', 'who', 'was', 'scavenging', 'one', 'wolves', 'abandoned', 'kills', 'then', 'basically', 'tearing', 'coyote', 'apart', 'felt', 'little', 'nauseous', 'Also', 'end', 'movie', 'wolf', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'attacked', 'mauled', 'other', 'wolves', 'pack', 'narrator', 'wounds', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'had', 'bargained', 'especially', 'wolf', 'end', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'documentary.I', 'got', 'documentary', 'primarily', '5', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'very', 'interested', 'wolves', 'had', 'rented', 'documentaryWolves', 'IMAX', 'year', 'ago', 'also', 'wolves', 'returned', 'Yellowstone', 'liked', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'ordering', 'When', 'started', 'watching', 'realized', 'was', 'different', 'thought', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'same', 'animal', 'same', 'topic', 'now', 'think', 'Wolve', 'IMAX', 'more', 'suited', 'younger', 'viewers']",N/A
1067919,A1A8KJ066DQ3US,B000P0J0GA,Warren J. Dew,"[56, 58]","A century ago, wolves were still common in the American West.  By 1930, they had been wiped out in the lower 48 states.  This video chronicles the reintroduction of three wolf packs, transported from Canada, to Yellowstone National Park.The video primarily follows one pack of wolves - the ""Druid's Peak"" pack, named for the territory they claimed after release - for about two years after they were transported to Yellowstone.  You'll see some of the wolves' first hunts, and how they pick out one target animal from the herd and coordinate to run it down - and you'll also see other hunts under different conditions, on powder and crusted snow and at night.  You'll see how the pack defends its territory from other wolves, and how it reacts to scavengers trying to steal bits of its kills.The video also shows how the pack's internal hierarchy works, with an alpha male and alpha female at the top, and new puppies being integrated at the bottom.  Individuals that threaten the positions of the alphas are thrown out of the pack to become lone wolves - but the alphas themselves can also be replaced.  One of the most interesting sequences covers how the pack tests a new male after their own alpha male is lost.There is some footage of the people doing the filming and the research - but not too much.  As in all the best wildlife videos, the focus is not on the humans, but on the wildlife.
