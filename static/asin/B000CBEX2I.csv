955979,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000CBEX2I,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 7]","It creaks. It huffs and puffs. Its jokes are so lame they need crutches. It so carefully replicates the popular radio show it was based on that it's excruciatingly artificial at times. Still, even though both the radio show and the movie, both titled Breakfast in Hollywood, are long forgotten, as is Tom Breneman, the smooth radio host responsible for both, the movie has a few good points if you're in an easy-going mood.The radio show was hugely popular in the mid-Forties. Tom Breneman would wander through the audience which was seated at tables in a large restaurant, mike in hand, chatting up the middle-aged and older ladies, trading jokes and quips, kissing cheeks, awarding an orchid to the oldest woman there and putting on the silliest hat he could find. He was a master interviewer, completely shameless at chortling over his own jokes, and skillful at almost but not quite leading the ladies to make fools of themselves. He had a good thing going on radio, so why not try a movie? All he needed was a plot gimmick.So we have the stories of several people who come to Breakfast in Hollywood one morning for the show, we see the show and then we see what happens to them after the show, with Breneman playing comforter and matchmaker. Among them are Dorothy Larson (Bonita Granville), young, sweet and looking for her Navy boyfriend; Elvira Spriggens (Zasu Pitts), feather-brained and wearing a hat that looks like a cross between a small dinosaur and a plumbing fixture; Mrs. Annie Reed (Beulah Bondi), a wise old woman who owns Tippy, her little dog who has the croup; and Ken Smith (Edward Ryan), a nice kid soon to be out of the Navy who by chance scores a ticket to the program from Tom Breneman himself. Everything comes together in a collection of contented (and one romantic) conclusions. In an odd way, watching Breneman, a radio man to his finger tips -- completely assured, smoothly working in all those planned ad libs, cozying and comforting and pleasing all the middle-aged ladies in his audience, laughing so easily at his own jokes and at the funny situations he puts others in -- is to witness a part of American radio history.For those who aren't enthusiastic about radio history, you'll also be able to see some of the guest artists Breneman always had on this program. So you can enjoy Nat Cole and the King Cole Trio doing ""It's Better To Be Yourself"" and swinging ""Solid Potato Salad"" (although carefully segregated in a nightclub with no connection to either the movie or the radio show setting); Andy Russell crooning ""If I Had a Wishing Ring,"" ""Magic is the Moonlight"" and ""Amour, Amour, Amour;"" and, best of all, Spike Jones and His City Slickers. For all those who may remember him only as a collection of honkers and washboards, Jones was a first-class musician who knew what he was doing with his musical parodies. Enjoy ""The Glow Worm"" and, especially, ""A Hat for Hedda Hopper.""Breakfast in Hollywood is in the public domain. It's not in very good shape. Breneman, incidentally, died at the height of his program's popularity, two years after this movie was released in 1946. He was 47. The program staggered on with guest hosts but he was key to its popularity. Soon it was cancelled. In my opinion, you'd need to be a radio scholar or a great fan of Tom Breneman's to get your money's worth at more than three or four dollars.",3,"You might want to stick with Fred Allen on the radio, but Tom Breneman was on the dial, too, if you're interested",1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,3370,"['puffs', 'jokes', 'are', 'so', 'lame', 'need', 'crutches', 'so', 'carefully', 'popular', 'radio', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'excruciatingly', 'artificial', 'times', 'Still', 'even', 'radio', 'show', 'movie', 'titled', 'Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'long', 'forgotten', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'smooth', 'radio', 'host', 'responsible', 'movie', 'few', 'good', 'points', ""'re"", 'easy-going', 'mood.The', 'radio', 'show', 'was', 'hugely', 'popular', 'mid-Forties', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'would', 'wander', 'audience', 'was', 'seated', 'tables', 'large', 'restaurant', 'mike', 'hand', 'chatting', 'up', 'middle-aged', 'older', 'ladies', 'trading', 'jokes', 'quips', 'kissing', 'cheeks', 'awarding', 'orchid', 'oldest', 'woman', 'there', 'putting', 'silliest', 'hat', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'master', 'interviewer', 'completely', 'shameless', 'chortling', 'over', 'own', 'jokes', 'skillful', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'leading', 'ladies', 'make', 'fools', 'had', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'radio', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'try', 'movie', 'needed', 'was', 'plot', 'gimmick.So', 'have', 'stories', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'morning', 'show', 'see', 'show', 'then', 'see', 'what', 'show', 'Breneman', 'playing', 'comforter', 'matchmaker', 'are', 'Dorothy', 'Larson', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'young', 'sweet', 'looking', 'Navy', 'boyfriend', 'Elvira', 'Spriggens', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'feather-brained', 'wearing', 'hat', 'cross', 'small', 'dinosaur', 'plumbing', 'fixture', 'Mrs.', 'Annie', 'Reed', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'wise', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'Tippy', 'little', 'dog', 'who', 'croup', 'Ken', 'Smith', 'Edward', 'Ryan', 'nice', 'kid', 'soon', 'be', 'Navy', 'who', 'chance', 'scores', 'ticket', 'program', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'Everything', 'together', 'collection', 'contented', 'one', 'romantic', 'conclusions', 'odd', 'way', 'watching', 'Breneman', 'radio', 'man', 'finger', 'tips', 'completely', 'assured', 'smoothly', 'working', 'planned', 'ad', 'libs', 'cozying', 'comforting', 'pleasing', 'middle-aged', 'ladies', 'audience', 'laughing', 'so', 'easily', 'own', 'jokes', 'funny', 'situations', 'others', 'witness', 'part', 'American', 'radio', 'history.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'enthusiastic', 'radio', 'history', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'guest', 'artists', 'Breneman', 'always', 'had', 'program', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Nat', 'Cole', 'King', 'Cole', 'Trio', 'doing', 'Better', 'Be', 'swinging', 'Solid', 'Potato', 'Salad', 'carefully', 'segregated', 'nightclub', 'connection', 'either', 'movie', 'radio', 'show', 'setting', 'Andy', 'Russell', 'crooning', 'Had', 'Wishing', 'Ring', 'Magic', 'Moonlight', 'Amour', 'Amour', 'Amour', 'best', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'City', 'Slickers', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'only', 'collection', 'honkers', 'washboards', 'Jones', 'was', 'first-class', 'musician', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'musical', 'parodies', 'Enjoy', 'Glow', 'Worm', 'especially', 'Hat', 'Hedda', 'Hopper', 'Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'public', 'domain', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'Breneman', 'incidentally', 'died', 'height', 'program', 'popularity', 'two', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1946', 'was', '47', 'program', 'staggered', 'guest', 'hosts', 'was', 'key', 'popularity', 'Soon', 'was', 'cancelled', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'need', 'be', 'radio', 'scholar', 'great', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'more', 'three', 'four', 'dollars']",Breakfast in Hollywood

955982,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B000CBEX2I,G. Charles Steiner,"[3, 4]","This is a wonderful miniature of Hollywood magic at its best, even if it is a B movie.  As a B movie, it's pretty darn good.  I never knew of Tom Breneman before this movie and I don't think it much matters whether you don't know him in the least.  His personality in this film is not much different from what Hugh Downes's personality was like on TV, although the former tells more (corny) jokes in this film.  It doesn't matter if the jokes are lame; most hit radio talk show programs' jokes, once revisited forty years later, won't stand the test of time either.What this movie does is recreate a radio talk show's celebrity and popularity among the average female audience across the country.  The sometimes drab dialogue is very much in  keeping with the style of any radio program host trying to engage on a daily basis the ordinary housewives and lives of average Americans.  Tom Breneman's popularity as a radio host is specifically presented but his program and the host both represent as well the typical host and the typical audience.The entire flavor of Hollywood and its magic is recreated here but in quick time.  There's music, dancing, singing, comedy, drama, and romance - a buffet of interests.For me, Beulah Bondi as the 82-year-old Mrs. Annie Reed practically stole the show.  And it was lovely to hear the distinguished love-bird articulations of Billie Burke once more.I liked Andy Russell's singing although one of his songs is staged such that the ""plot"" comes to a complete halt until his performance is finished, and I did not like that.  I also liked the Nat King Cole Trio, particularly the song ""It's Better to Be By Yourself.""  I found the Spike Jones and his City Slickers to be nerve-wracking and noisy, loud and rank -- despite whatever talents Spike Jones as a musician actually possessed.  They were not on full display here IMO.This movie is available on the Internet for free on at least two websites if you do a search.",4,"Good Feelings, Fella",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1957,"['wonderful', 'miniature', 'Hollywood', 'magic', 'best', 'even', 'B', 'movie', 'B', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'never', 'knew', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'matters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'least', 'personality', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'Hugh', 'Downes', 'personality', 'was', 'TV', 'former', 'tells', 'more', 'corny', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'jokes', 'are', 'lame', 'most', 'hit', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'programs', 'jokes', 'once', 'revisited', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'movie', 'recreate', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'celebrity', 'popularity', 'average', 'female', 'audience', 'country', 'sometimes', 'drab', 'dialogue', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'style', 'radio', 'program', 'host', 'trying', 'engage', 'daily', 'basis', 'ordinary', 'housewives', 'lives', 'average', 'Americans', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'popularity', 'radio', 'host', 'specifically', 'presented', 'program', 'host', 'represent', 'as', 'well', 'typical', 'host', 'typical', 'audience.The', 'entire', 'flavor', 'Hollywood', 'magic', 'recreated', 'here', 'quick', 'time', 'music', 'dancing', 'singing', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'buffet', 'interests.For', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', '82-year-old', 'Mrs.', 'Annie', 'Reed', 'practically', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'lovely', 'hear', 'distinguished', 'love-bird', 'articulations', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'once', 'more.I', 'liked', 'Andy', 'Russell', 'singing', 'one', 'songs', 'staged', 'such', 'plot', 'complete', 'halt', 'performance', 'finished', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'liked', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'Trio', 'particularly', 'song', 'Better', 'Be', 'found', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'City', 'Slickers', 'be', 'nerve-wracking', 'noisy', 'loud', 'rank', 'talents', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'musician', 'actually', 'possessed', 'were', 'not', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'IMO.This', 'movie', 'available', 'Internet', 'free', 'least', 'two', 'websites', 'do', 'search']",Breakfast in Hollywood
955983,A1TNWBQVG7SINE,B000CBEX2I,James J. Varela,"[8, 9]","Anyone who has ever visited Hollywood and wakled down Vine St will find the ruins of Tom Breneman's famous Hollywood restaurant. (The Parking lot across the street was where the famous Brown Derby stood until 1984). From 1940 until Mr. Breneman's untimely death in 1948 Mr. Breneman hosted inside the restaurant the mega popular morning radio show ""Breakfast in Hollywood"". Often radio listeners would be surprised by Mr.Breneman who  would reveal some major movie star who was in attendence such as Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, or Judy Garland. During WWII Mr. Breneman frequently gave free parties to servicemen on their way to and from the Pacific. This movie was made in 1946. This movie is did not transfer to DVD very well. Sound quality is at times poor and scratchy. Bonita Granville is at her loveliest in the movie and 40's crooner Andy Russell belts out some catchy tunes. You also get an early in his career appearence by Nat King Cole and another musical number by Spike Jones and his City Slickers. The DVD also includes a bonus episode of the  1950's episode of the tv show "" You Asked For it "". On it host Art Baker takes the audience on a tour of 1954 Hollywood including homes of the stars.

955986,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000CBEX2I,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Breakfast in Hollywood is indeed based on a radio show of the same name with Tom Breneman as its host. (True, there may have been a little life left in the show after Breneman died all too soon but the show really didn't fare well without him.) When I read the reviews of the film here on Amazon, I was pretty sure I'd find myself watching a real stinker but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there are some qualities of the film that I genuinely like! Don't get me wrong--this is far from the best movie I've ever watched but I enjoyed it anyway even with the poor quality image and the sound quality not being too hot after the first 44 minutes or so at least on my copy of it. The sets are fairly well done with good choreography and cinematography but then again on the other hand there is the embarrassingly dated way of showing The King Cole Trio (with Nat ""King"" Cole) so segregated from the film that if you cut them out you wouldn't notice the difference! Look also for Andy Russell to give some nice performances even if they don't tie into the plot very well either and there's also Spike Jones and His City Slickers. I think the point to keep in mind is that the film is purely light-hearted entertainment that doesn't require you to think hard to enjoy it if you can accept that it truly needs a restoration and that The King Cole trio is remarkably segregated. The film also shows what everyday housewives were listening to on the radio back in the days before television and thus Breakfast in Hollywood actually has a historic quality to it, too!The bulk of the film centers around Tom Breneman's ""Breakfast in Hollywood"" radio show and we meet quite a cast of characters all wanting to enjoy the show or somehow get into the act! There's Bonita Granville as Dorothy Larson who is engaged--she thinks--to a guy named Jim and how this plays out when she meets a sailor named Ken Smith (Edward Ryan) at the show is interesting to see. We also get a fine performance by Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Annie Reed whose dog Tippy has the croup--she wants to be the oldest woman in the audience to win an orchid given to her by Tom himself! I also liked Zasu Pitts as Elvira Spriggens who wants to win the hat contest at the radio show so Tom will try on her hat (this isn't all that humorous although the way they carry on you'd think it actually was funny).  Elvira does indeed wear the most outrageous hat that looks awful to put it mildly but will she win the contest and have Tom pick out her hat and try it on for fun or will some other woman in the audience win that ""prize"" herself? Look also for Raymond Walburn as Richard Cartwright, the playboy husband of Frances Cartwright (Billie Burke) and Hedda Hopper plays herself! There are some other people you might be surprised to see very briefly on screen as well but I'll let you discover them for yourself.Some of the songs I enjoyed include ""The Glow Worm"" performed by Spike Jones and His City Slickers; ""Solid Potato Salad"" performed by The King Cole Trio; ""It's Better to Be By Yourself"" also performed by The King Cole Trio and ""Magic Is the Moonlight"" performed by Andy Russell.There is one bonus feature I should mention: a TV episode of ""You Asked for It"" from 1954 with host Art Baker who gives the audience a tour of Hollywood including some homes of stars.Overall, if you're a fan of the principal actors in this film you may well want to get this if you don't mind the fact that it needs a restoration. People who like the history of old time radio may also want to get this film.",4,an interesting film with good actors and some history of old time radio -- but it's somewhat dated and it needs a restoration,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,3561,"['Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'indeed', 'based', 'radio', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'host', 'True', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'life', 'left', 'show', 'Breneman', 'died', 'too', 'soon', 'show', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'When', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', ""'d"", 'find', 'watching', 'real', 'stinker', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'are', 'qualities', 'film', 'genuinely', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'far', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'even', 'poor', 'quality', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'hot', 'first', '44', 'minutes', 'so', 'least', 'copy', 'sets', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'then', 'again', 'other', 'hand', 'embarrassingly', 'dated', 'way', 'showing', 'King', 'Cole', 'Trio', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'so', 'segregated', 'film', 'cut', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'difference', 'Look', 'also', 'Andy', 'Russell', 'give', 'nice', 'performances', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'tie', 'plot', 'very', 'well', 'either', 'also', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'City', 'Slickers', 'think', 'point', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'purely', 'light-hearted', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'require', 'think', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'can', 'accept', 'truly', 'restoration', 'King', 'Cole', 'trio', 'remarkably', 'segregated', 'film', 'also', 'what', 'everyday', 'housewives', 'were', 'listening', 'radio', 'back', 'days', 'television', 'thus', 'Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'historic', 'quality', 'too', 'bulk', 'film', 'centers', 'Tom', 'Breneman', 'Breakfast', 'Hollywood', 'radio', 'show', 'meet', 'quite', 'cast', 'characters', 'wanting', 'enjoy', 'show', 'somehow', 'get', 'act', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'Dorothy', 'Larson', 'who', 'engaged', 'guy', 'named', 'Jim', 'how', 'out', 'when', 'sailor', 'named', 'Ken', 'Smith', 'Edward', 'Ryan', 'show', 'interesting', 'see', 'also', 'get', 'fine', 'performance', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Mrs.', 'Annie', 'Reed', 'dog', 'Tippy', 'croup', 'be', 'oldest', 'woman', 'audience', 'win', 'orchid', 'given', 'Tom', 'also', 'liked', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'Elvira', 'Spriggens', 'who', 'win', 'hat', 'contest', 'radio', 'show', 'so', 'Tom', 'will', 'try', 'hat', ""n't"", 'that', 'humorous', 'way', 'carry', ""'d"", 'think', 'actually', 'was', 'funny', 'Elvira', 'indeed', 'wear', 'most', 'outrageous', 'hat', 'awful', 'put', 'mildly', 'will', 'win', 'contest', 'have', 'Tom', 'pick', 'out', 'hat', 'try', 'fun', 'will', 'other', 'woman', 'audience', 'win', 'prize', 'Look', 'also', 'Raymond', 'Walburn', 'Richard', 'Cartwright', 'playboy', 'husband', 'Frances', 'Cartwright', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'Hedda', 'Hopper', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'very', 'briefly', 'screen', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'let', 'discover', 'yourself.Some', 'songs', 'enjoyed', 'include', 'Glow', 'Worm', 'performed', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'City', 'Slickers', 'Solid', 'Potato', 'Salad', 'performed', 'King', 'Cole', 'Trio', 'Better', 'Be', 'also', 'performed', 'King', 'Cole', 'Trio', 'Magic', 'Moonlight', 'performed', 'Andy', 'Russell.There', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'should', 'mention', 'TV', 'episode', 'Asked', '1954', 'host', 'Art', 'Baker', 'who', 'audience', 'tour', 'Hollywood', 'including', 'homes', 'stars.Overall', ""'re"", 'fan', 'principal', 'actors', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'want', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'restoration', 'People', 'who', 'history', 'old', 'time', 'radio', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'get', 'film']",Breakfast in Hollywood

I can't believe the critics choice version of this film says it's restored or remastered, or whatever term they used.  The intro credits are shakey like it's taken from a poor quality video tape, and there are various sections of the film where the audio is so distorted that you can hardly make out what they're saying.  It's really awful.  The movie itself is worth seeing if you're a fan of the lovely Bonita Granville, plus appearances by Nat King Cole among others really make it worth your while.  But personally I'd hold off until they truly and honestly restore this one.  I wouldn't buy this terrible version which is nearly unwatchable with the audio and video problems.  Whoever released this version and claimed it was restored should be fired.  I'd give the film itself 4 stars, but the poor quality brings it down to an overall 3 stars for me.",3,Breakfast in Hollywood Review,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,953,"['film', 'nice', 'cute', 'funny', 'decent', 'storyline', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'terrible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'critics', 'choice', 'version', 'film', 'restored', 'remastered', 'term', 'used', 'intro', 'credits', 'are', 'shakey', 'taken', 'poor', 'quality', 'video', 'tape', 'are', 'various', 'sections', 'film', 'where', 'audio', 'so', 'distorted', 'can', 'hardly', 'make', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'really', 'awful', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'lovely', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'appearances', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'others', 'really', 'make', 'while', 'personally', ""'d"", 'hold', 'off', 'truly', 'honestly', 'restore', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'terrible', 'version', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'audio', 'video', 'problems', 'Whoever', 'released', 'version', 'claimed', 'was', 'restored', 'should', 'be', 'fired', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'poor', 'quality', 'down', 'overall', '3', 'stars']",Breakfast in Hollywood
