Her voice is calming, and while the instruction can be a bit tedious (we get it, up and down) it is a great yoga dvd to have your collection.",5,A Mid-range Yoga Session with Goregous Scenery,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,265,"['worth', 'just', 'view', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'beginners', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'intermediate', 'found', 'just', 'right', 'voice', 'calming', 'instruction', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'tedious', 'get', 'up', 'down', 'great', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'have', 'collection']",Colleen Saidman’s Yoga for Weight Loss

Since it is for ""weightloss"" I expected the workouts to be more challenging and work up more of a sweat.  This is not the only video I'm using, so I cannot tell if it is making a significant impoact on my weight or not.  I would do other workouts during the week and use this as a supplement versus relying solely on this workout for weightloss.That being said, I do like using it because it is easy and also relaxing, so it is good to use before going to bed at night or if you do not have enough energy to do an intense cardio workout.The one thing I really dislike about this video is her cues to not exactly match up to what she is doing on screen (they often come too early, sometimes too late).  Also, she does not always describe in enough detail what she is doing, so it is difficult when you are not in a position to look at the screen.  This is my biggest pet peeve when using workout videos, especially if they are yoga or pilates videos.",3,"Easy, Relaxing",1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,991,"['workouts', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'weightloss', 'expected', 'workouts', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'work', 'up', 'more', 'sweat', 'not', 'only', 'video', ""'m"", 'using', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'making', 'significant', 'impoact', 'weight', 'not', 'would', 'do', 'other', 'workouts', 'week', 'use', 'supplement', 'versus', 'relying', 'solely', 'workout', 'weightloss.That', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'using', 'easy', 'also', 'relaxing', 'good', 'use', 'going', 'bed', 'night', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'energy', 'do', 'intense', 'cardio', 'workout.The', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'dislike', 'video', 'cues', 'not', 'exactly', 'match', 'up', 'what', 'doing', 'screen', 'often', 'come', 'too', 'early', 'sometimes', 'too', 'late', 'Also', 'not', 'always', 'describe', 'enough', 'detail', 'what', 'doing', 'difficult', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'position', 'look', 'screen', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peeve', 'when', 'using', 'workout', 'videos', 'especially', 'are', 'yoga', 'videos']",Colleen Saidman’s Yoga for Weight Loss
1587459,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B0099115XW,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[8, 8]","This is a great yoga workout for intermediate level yoga practitioners interested in practicing at home, and especially interested in focusing their yoga routine on weight loss goals. It includes a comprehensive introduction, and 22-25 minute workouts that you can do separately or combine into one workout. I like the 'Total Flow' workout, combined with a 'Strengthening and Energizing' workout. There is also a Core focus one, and some bonus material. The setting for all of them is beautiful, the instructions clear, and the workout comprehensive. There isn't much time spent on how to modify the moves within the workout, so this won't be right for most people who are completely new to yoga. It's also not a particularly difficult workout, so if you are looking for a hardcore 'power yoga' type of workout, this isn't it. But if you've had a moderate level of experience, this will be excellent for you.",5,"Great Intermediate Level Yoga Workout, Especially For Those Focused on Weight Loss",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,908,"['great', 'yoga', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'level', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'interested', 'practicing', 'home', 'especially', 'interested', 'focusing', 'yoga', 'routine', 'weight', 'loss', 'goals', 'comprehensive', 'introduction', '22-25', 'minute', 'workouts', 'can', 'do', 'separately', 'combine', 'one', 'workout', ""'Total"", 'Flow', 'workout', 'combined', ""'Strengthening"", 'Energizing', 'workout', 'also', 'Core', 'focus', 'one', 'bonus', 'material', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'instructions', 'clear', 'workout', 'comprehensive', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'how', 'modify', 'moves', 'workout', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'new', 'yoga', 'also', 'not', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'workout', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'hardcore', 'yoga', 'type', 'workout', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'had', 'moderate', 'level', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'excellent']",Colleen Saidman’s Yoga for Weight Loss
1587460,A21B16NM6CH6D,B0099115XW,"M. Garcia ""Teacher and Mom""","[0, 0]","I like the setting and the instructor very much.  There is not a lot of babble about breathing or reaching inside, blah, blah.  Other yoga videos I've tried spend waaay too much time talking and not enough on actually doing yoga.  I like that there are three different  sessions, each about 20 minutes, that you can do individually or together.  The one thing that I am not really  crazy about is that she moves through the poses really quickly.  For me, I like to have a little bit longer in the pose to really stretch and feel the muscle release but there is no time given for that in this video.  I have modified by staying in a pose longer, if I feel like I need/want to, and then moving on to wherever the instructor is when I am ready.  I would say that if you have never done any kind of yoga before, then this is probably not the video for you.  She does move pretty quickly and there isn't a lot of explanation on how to get into each pose.  However, if you have had some yoga experience then this should be very approachable for you.  I am not a yoga expert.  I have taken classes off and on over the last decade and found this to be a great video for me and my skill level.",4,Good video for those with some yoga experience,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1184,"['like', 'setting', 'instructor', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'lot', 'babble', 'breathing', 'reaching', 'inside', 'blah', 'blah', 'Other', 'yoga', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'spend', 'waaay', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'talking', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'doing', 'yoga', 'like', 'are', 'three', 'different', 'sessions', '20', 'minutes', 'can', 'do', 'individually', 'together', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'crazy', 'about', 'poses', 'really', 'quickly', 'like', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'pose', 'really', 'stretch', 'feel', 'muscle', 'release', 'time', 'given', 'video', 'have', 'modified', 'staying', 'pose', 'longer', 'feel', 'need/want', 'then', 'moving', 'wherever', 'instructor', 'when', 'am', 'ready', 'would', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'kind', 'yoga', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'video', 'move', 'pretty', 'quickly', ""n't"", 'lot', 'explanation', 'how', 'get', 'pose', 'However', 'have', 'had', 'yoga', 'experience', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'approachable', 'am', 'not', 'yoga', 'expert', 'have', 'taken', 'classes', 'last', 'decade', 'found', 'be', 'great', 'video', 'skill', 'level']",Colleen Saidman’s Yoga for Weight Loss
