Finally after a 25 years wait and hundreds of requests from fans, it's available on DVD in 2013!China Beach was one of my most favorite shows back in the day. It has been so long that I didn't realize that Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, was the same actress as the very Hot Redhead, Karen Charlene &#34;K.C.&#34; Koloski, a heroin-addicted prostitute and later black-marketeer that I had a crush on as a teen. Also didn't realize that Dana Delany who played Katherine Mayfair on the Desperate Housewives and played Megan Hunt on the ABC drama series Body of Proof was the same actress as China Beach's Nurse Colleen McMurphy. They both looked different with red hair in China Beach (Nowadays Blond). Also surprised to see Robert Picardo,  the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), &#34;The Doctor&#34;, on Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and some Star Trek movies and played Richard Woolsey in the Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe was the same actor as Dr. Dick Richards on China Beach (who had hair back than).Only complaint, as someone mentioned earlier, with No Sub-Titles nor Closed-Captions which my wife needs (she's not deaf) just unable to comprehend actors talking in an accent whether it's a Texas, Southern, Mid-Western, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Boston, Scottish, Cockney, Irish, Aussie, Hispanic, Hip-Hop/Ghetto Talk, Cajun nor French-Canadian.

The pilot is stunning.  The photography, the story, the clothes and that tear jerking climax - it sets up the show perfectly and introduces each characters.  The first three episodes of Season One, while enjoyable, are at times a little weak.  Yes, the show is set during the VietNam War but instead of the war being the backdrop, at times it feels like an afterthought.  Instead, we get a lot of intrigue with Cherry's mission to find her brother, KC's black market ventures and McMurphy being wooed by a ""zoomie,"" complete with a really unconvincing jet ride through the clouds. We also get stories about air conditioners, laryngitis and a rather painful scene where the woman are all in a bunker together during an air raid and discuss their first times. (I didn't know they had segregated bunkers when everybody was scrambling for their lives.) Watching these early episodes, (save the pilot) I can see why some of the real-life nurses who served in VietNam were wary of the show.But luckily, the show gels with the episode ""Waiting for Beckett."" From then on, Season One closes out with some good episodes and the actors really get to know their characters (if you  watch closely, you'll see that Lila never refers to herself as military in Season One; she was retrofitted as brass in Season Two and suddenly her character makes a lot more sense.)

1653219,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D2UMHVA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[74, 76]","Earlier this year, Time Life and Star Vista finally released the ""China Beach"" set that fans had been awaiting for over 25 years!  Of course, it came with a rather hefty price tag.  If you are interested in the Complete Series, go straight to the source and do a quick Internet search of Time Life with China Beach to get the best price available.  Suggested selling price for the Complete Series is 199.95 with a Collector's Edition available at 274.95.  Do NOT pay second hand seller prices on this site!  I am pleased, however, that they have also portioned off Season One for a regular and priced-right DVD release.  This does make me nervous, though.  Whether or not future seasons will get individual releases is still up in the air and will undoubtedly be dependent on sales of this set.  The good news for those looking to make a Season One purchase, this is exactly what you would get in the Complete Series package.The three disc set has the seven episodes of Season One:1) China Beach Pilot2) Home3) Hot Spell4) Somewhere Over The Radio5) Waiting For Beckett6) Brothers7) Chad OngThe third disc has two extended featurettes:1) China Beach: How It All Began: The show's creators wax nostalgic about the program, its influence and importance, and the cast.  They are especially proud of this achievement.2) Highlights From The 25th Anniversary Cast Reunion:  This is a great peek at many of the major cast members now.  They contrast how they appear in present day with the series finale (which had aged them).  My only comment is that I watched this with someone who had not seen the series in its original run.  Seeing who attended, who was in the series finale and who was not, was a little bit of a plot spoiler for newbies.Debuting in 1988 and running for four seasons, the show constantly challenged its viewers and thwarted conventional expectations. In my opinion, it was one of the three defining shows of its era in terms of sheer ambition, gritty realism, and emotional impact. I remember episodes from the initial run as if I had seen them yesterday, and that says a lot for a program celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary! ""China Beach"" became one of the most requested unreleased programs on the popular website TVShowsOnDVD and so it's fair to say that expectations were high for this DVD debut. Part of the delay, I'm sure, was negotiating the rights to the many songs that were featured during its broadcast run. And unlike some other popular shows of the era (Northern Exposure, for example), they didn't want to make arbitrary substitutions for the DVD release. If you remember the show, the music was absolutely integral to its storytelling.Season One is largely seen through the eyes of two outsiders (Laurette and Cherry) to China Beach.  Perhaps the fullest character arc goes to Chloe Webb as Laurette, an entertainer that finds more than she bargained for in her experiences in Viet Nam.  Her powerful work in the last epsiode scored her a guest actress EMMY nomination.  The Pilot episode (nominated for Writing and Directing EMMYs) is still a tremendous introduction to the characters and situations.  While the show would continue to get richer in the following seasons, Season One really played up the core of female characters vital to the shows success including Dana Delaney and Marg Helgenberger, both would win EMMYs for later seasons.  No doubt about it, ""China Beach"" is landmark TV.  The whole series is essential viewing, let's just hope that those that purchase Season One will be able to get the other ones individually as well.

1653235,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00D2UMHVA,trebe,"[0, 0]","As my father spent some of his military career in Vietnam, I began watching China Beach back in 1988, looking to get some impression of what life could have been like there.  Set in 1967 at a hospital in Da Nang, China Beach turned out to be an engaging and  moving drama, with an extremely talented and mostly youthful cast, that included Dana Delany (Body of Proof), Marg Helgenberger (CSI), Michael Boatman (Spin City), Robert Picardo (Star Trek Voyager), Concetta Tomei, Nan Woods, Ricki Lake (The Ricki Lake Show), and Jeff Korber.  Dealing with war, death, medicine, romance, morality, and survival, the stories were often thoughtful, and emotional charged, as after so many years, it seemed that American television was prepared to feature the Vietnam conflict in prime time, asTour of Dutyhad premiered a year before.In 2013, roughly coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the premiere of China Beach (1988-91), Time Life released the entire series in a 21 disc collector's set, which contains the series' pilot, 62 one hour episodes produced in four seasons, and a prodigious amount of bonus materials.  The set is currently available at the Time Life website for about $200.  What appears to be thesame set, is now available through Amazon, but is selling for close to $330.  That's quite a hefty premium!By comparison, the 3 disc Season One set is a relative bargain, as it sells for about $30 at Time Life.  The set contains the two hour China Beach pilot, plus six one hour episodes.  According to Time Life, there are some 3 hours of bonus materials, most of which is probably the commentary track on the pilot.Blessed with superior writing and an outstanding cast, China Beach is a series often capable of touching the heart, and sometimes breaking it, so you might want to keep some tissues nearby.  Nominated four times, Dana Delany won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series twice.  Marg Helgenberger also won an Emmy, for her portrayal of a prostitute.  Nan Woods, whose acting career apparently ended with China Beach, gives a moving performance as a Red Cross volunteer.  The series also features some great guest stars, including Nancy Sinatra, who plays herself visiting the troops, in the final episode of Season One.Popular music was in integral part of China Beach, with The Supremes ""Reflections"" serving as a poignant theme song.  The inability to secure licensing rights for music, has been an issue with the DVD release of some TV programs, but thankfully that is not the case with China Beach, as apparently rights for all the music originally featured in the program, some 300 songs, were secured.  So the presentation of the episodes, is quite close to their original form.After being forgotten by many, sentiment toward the Vietnam war turned in a positive direction by the 1980's, which saw the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (The Wall).  The time was right for a program like China Beach.  Twenty five years may have passed since it debuted, but with American troops still being deployed in foreign lands, the subject matter dealt with in China Beach, still has some relevance today.Other complete series sets originally released by Time Life, such asGet Smart, andThe Man From U.N.C.L.E., eventually came down in price, after retailers like Amazon, were permitted to sell them.  Hopefully that also occurs with China Beach, because the current premium price for the entire series, just does not seem reasonable.",4,"after a long wait, the vietnam war enters prime time...",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,3481,"['father', 'spent', 'military', 'career', 'Vietnam', 'began', 'watching', 'China', 'Beach', 'back', '1988', 'looking', 'get', 'impression', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Set', '1967', 'hospital', 'Da', 'Nang', 'China', 'Beach', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'engaging', 'moving', 'drama', 'extremely', 'talented', 'mostly', 'youthful', 'cast', 'included', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Body', 'Proof', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'CSI', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'Spin', 'City', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Concetta', 'Tomei', 'Nan', 'Woods', 'Ricki', 'Lake', 'Ricki', 'Lake', 'Show', 'Jeff', 'Korber', 'Dealing', 'war', 'death', 'medicine', 'romance', 'morality', 'survival', 'stories', 'were', 'often', 'thoughtful', 'emotional', 'charged', 'many', 'years', 'seemed', 'American', 'television', 'was', 'prepared', 'feature', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'prime', 'time', 'asTour', 'Dutyhad', 'premiered', 'year', 'before.In', '2013', 'roughly', 'coinciding', '25th', 'anniversary', 'premiere', 'China', 'Beach', '1988-91', 'Time', 'Life', 'released', 'entire', 'series', '21', 'disc', 'collector', 'set', 'series', 'pilot', '62', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'produced', 'four', 'seasons', 'prodigious', 'amount', 'bonus', 'materials', 'set', 'currently', 'available', 'Time', 'Life', 'website', '200', 'What', 'be', 'thesame', 'set', 'now', 'available', 'Amazon', 'selling', 'close', '330', 'quite', 'hefty', 'premium', 'comparison', '3', 'disc', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'relative', 'bargain', '30', 'Time', 'Life', 'set', 'two', 'hour', 'China', 'Beach', 'pilot', 'six', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'According', 'Time', 'Life', 'are', '3', 'hours', 'bonus', 'materials', 'most', 'probably', 'commentary', 'track', 'pilot.Blessed', 'superior', 'writing', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'China', 'Beach', 'series', 'often', 'capable', 'touching', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'breaking', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'tissues', 'nearby', 'Nominated', 'four', 'times', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'Drama', 'Series', 'twice', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'also', 'won', 'Emmy', 'portrayal', 'prostitute', 'Nan', 'Woods', 'acting', 'career', 'apparently', 'ended', 'China', 'Beach', 'moving', 'performance', 'Red', 'Cross', 'volunteer', 'series', 'also', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Nancy', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'visiting', 'troops', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', 'One.Popular', 'music', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'China', 'Beach', 'Supremes', 'Reflections', 'serving', 'poignant', 'theme', 'song', 'inability', 'secure', 'licensing', 'rights', 'music', 'been', 'issue', 'DVD', 'release', 'TV', 'programs', 'thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'China', 'Beach', 'apparently', 'rights', 'music', 'originally', 'featured', 'program', '300', 'songs', 'were', 'secured', 'presentation', 'episodes', 'quite', 'close', 'original', 'form.After', 'being', 'forgotten', 'many', 'sentiment', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'turned', 'positive', 'direction', '1980', 'saw', 'construction', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Memorial', 'Wall', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'program', 'China', 'Beach', 'Twenty', 'five', 'years', 'may', 'have', 'passed', 'debuted', 'American', 'troops', 'still', 'being', 'deployed', 'foreign', 'lands', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealt', 'China', 'Beach', 'still', 'relevance', 'today.Other', 'complete', 'series', 'sets', 'originally', 'released', 'Time', 'Life', 'such', 'asGet', 'Smart', 'andThe', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E.', 'eventually', 'came', 'down', 'price', 'retailers', 'Amazon', 'were', 'permitted', 'sell', 'Hopefully', 'also', 'China', 'Beach', 'current', 'premium', 'price', 'entire', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'reasonable']",China Beach: Season 1

1653239,A1AT4OFBVBVL6Q,B00D2UMHVA,Zeke,"[0, 0]",China Beach was a ground breaking series.  It depicted a truthful picture of the Vietnam experience without concentrating solely on the carnage and it told the story largely from the perspective of the nurses who probably saw far more blood and gore than those of us who &#34;humped the bush&#34;.  It is a wonderfully done show that focuses more on the bond that people of diverse backgrounds develop under the harsh conditions of war.  For myself.....I identified heavily with the character Dodger.  That was me forty odd years ago so.....for me.....the show is therapeutic as well as entertaining.  You can't go wrong adding this to your collection.,5,China Beach Season 1,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,652,"['China', 'Beach', 'was', 'ground', 'breaking', 'series', 'depicted', 'truthful', 'picture', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'concentrating', 'solely', 'carnage', 'told', 'story', 'largely', 'perspective', 'nurses', 'who', 'probably', 'saw', 'far', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'who', '34', 'humped', 'bush', '34', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'show', 'more', 'bond', 'people', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'develop', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'war', '..I', 'identified', 'heavily', 'character', 'Dodger', 'was', 'forty', 'odd', 'years', 'ago', 'so', '..for', '..the', 'show', 'therapeutic', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'adding', 'collection']",China Beach: Season 1
