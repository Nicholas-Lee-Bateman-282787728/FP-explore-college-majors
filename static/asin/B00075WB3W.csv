876892,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00075WB3W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","What a gorgeous little film from Australia. It's so fabulous when a film starts with a particular quirky style and carries that style all the way to the end. When a character has a different outlook on life and the film doesn't degrade into standard melodrama. Ah I just love good films like this one.The film follows Placid Lake's life from a young boy to a grown man trying to make a living. Placid has many difficulties in life, a band of boys that beat him up daily at school. A pair of parents that are 100% completely stuck in the 60's and into themselves. His saving grace is a gorgeous intelligent and brave female friend, Gemma played by Rose Byrne (Damages television series).This film reminded me of several other films, but only in passing. Oddly, The Wild Thornberries (The Wild Thornberrys Movie) was one of them, mostly because of the quirky parents and a narrator that is intelligent but odd. And for reasons I don't totally understand, this felt a bit like Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist (Nick & Nora's Infinite Playlist [UMD for PSP]) - it's probably the relationship between Placid and Gemma was very similar to Nick and Nora. The music in Placid Lake was excellent, but not nearly as outstanding as Nick and Nora.The performances were outstanding. Every character was believeable and well acted. Even minor characters like Jenny, the tightly wound corporate climber, and Anton, the equally tightly wound corporate climber; were well played. The sound was very well recorded, dialog was crystal clear, and music supported the film nicely. There were not many special sound effects. Editing was tight and very well paced. The hour and a half film felt exactly the right length. Production was good, each setting felt very real.For a first time directing, this is a marvelously well done film.The film is not rated, but would likely be PG-13 (elsewhere in the world it has 13/14/15 year ratings. There is no nudity. Some slightly strong language. There are some sensual situations, Jenny and Placid end up in the stationery room together, and Placid and Gemma discuss sex. There is no violence, although Placid does get beaten up every day at school (it's shown artistically and not in some mean spirited fashion).What a fantastic little movie that sort of came out of nowhere. It's fantastic that Film Movements picked this up. Sorry that it didn't get much wider distribution, it's a wonderful film.Presented as a part of the Film Movement series of independent films from around the world. This brand always means the film will not be mainstream. It will likely be somewhat edgy or pushing the envelope somewhat. Frequently the films are by first time directors. And they are very rarely American films. It's a fantastic film series worth checking out.",5,"To Conform or Not To Conform, that is the question",1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,2775,"['What', 'gorgeous', 'little', 'film', 'Australia', 'so', 'fabulous', 'when', 'film', 'particular', 'quirky', 'style', 'style', 'way', 'end', 'When', 'character', 'different', 'outlook', 'life', 'film', ""n't"", 'degrade', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'Ah', 'just', 'love', 'good', 'films', 'one.The', 'film', 'Placid', 'Lake', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'grown', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'Placid', 'many', 'difficulties', 'life', 'band', 'boys', 'beat', 'up', 'daily', 'school', 'pair', 'parents', 'are', '100', '%', 'completely', 'stuck', '60', 'saving', 'grace', 'gorgeous', 'intelligent', 'brave', 'female', 'friend', 'Gemma', 'played', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Damages', 'television', 'series', '.This', 'film', 'reminded', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'only', 'passing', 'Oddly', 'Wild', 'Thornberries', 'Wild', 'Thornberrys', 'Movie', 'was', 'one', 'mostly', 'quirky', 'parents', 'narrator', 'intelligent', 'odd', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'totally', 'understand', 'felt', 'bit', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Infinite', 'Playlist', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Infinite', 'Playlist', '[', 'UMD', 'PSP', ']', 'probably', 'relationship', 'Placid', 'Gemma', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'music', 'Placid', 'Lake', 'was', 'excellent', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'outstanding', 'Nick', 'Nora.The', 'performances', 'were', 'outstanding', 'character', 'was', 'believeable', 'well', 'acted', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'Jenny', 'tightly', 'wound', 'corporate', 'climber', 'Anton', 'equally', 'tightly', 'wound', 'corporate', 'climber', 'were', 'well', 'played', 'sound', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'recorded', 'dialog', 'was', 'crystal', 'clear', 'music', 'supported', 'film', 'nicely', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'special', 'sound', 'effects', 'Editing', 'was', 'tight', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'felt', 'exactly', 'right', 'length', 'Production', 'was', 'good', 'setting', 'felt', 'very', 'real.For', 'first', 'time', 'directing', 'marvelously', 'well', 'done', 'film.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'PG-13', 'elsewhere', 'world', '13/14/15', 'year', 'ratings', 'nudity', 'slightly', 'strong', 'language', 'are', 'sensual', 'situations', 'Jenny', 'Placid', 'end', 'up', 'stationery', 'room', 'together', 'Placid', 'Gemma', 'discuss', 'sex', 'violence', 'Placid', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'day', 'school', 'shown', 'artistically', 'not', 'mean', 'spirited', 'fashion', 'fantastic', 'little', 'movie', 'sort', 'came', 'nowhere', 'fantastic', 'Film', 'Movements', 'picked', 'up', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'wider', 'distribution', 'wonderful', 'film.Presented', 'part', 'Film', 'Movement', 'series', 'independent', 'films', 'world', 'brand', 'always', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'mainstream', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'somewhat', 'edgy', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'somewhat', 'Frequently', 'films', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'directors', 'are', 'very', 'rarely', 'American', 'films', 'fantastic', 'film', 'series', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

876894,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B00075WB3W,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[7, 7]","This is a goofy, lightweight Australian comedy about a teenaged genius named Placid Lake who forsakes his hippie upbringing after suffering continual physical abuse at the hands of school classmates. So, he dresses like George W. Bush and joins an insurance firm. Of course, things don't turn out quite as planned.I don't watch THE OFFICE (British or American versions) but I imagine the quirky comedy in those must be something like this. If it weren't for the brazenly sexual moments (sans nudity), this would make a television sitcom... or it might still make a television sitcom.The movie has dreams of being a profound message film but the result is so lacking in depth that it winds up half-hearted -- spinning mixed messages on the issues of parental expectations, conformity and non-conformity, and a not-so-mixed message on vengeance. So, pick your interpretation. Or better yet, don't bother. Just enjoy the pastel visuals (this was obviously not an American production), the charming actors and just-funning attitude.Two of my favorites are here. Britisher Miranda Richardson and Aussi Rose Byrne (looking like the prettiest girl-geek ever). Coincidently, when I first saw Rose (THE GODDESS OF 1967), I kept thinking of other actresses she reminded of -- Jessica Alba, Shannon Doherty, and Miranda Richardson.

876895,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00075WB3W,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 9]","Ben Lee, as he is known in his 6 CD releases, or Benny Lee as he is billed in this film, stars as Placid Lake, a kid brought up by quintessential new age parents who are overly permissive.  To equip him with a different perspective, they send him to elementary school in a dress.  Garry McDonald who played the Doctor in ""Moulin Rouge"" plays daddy Doug Lake, a bit controlled by his better half.  Miranda Richardson plays his mother Sylvia who wants to study native life in Tuuvalu while also experimenting with same gender physical satisfaction.  The two-time Oscar nominee Richardson plays the role vividly on a similar scale to her Rita Skeeter inHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Widescreen Edition).  Placid's best friend is Gemma Taylor, a brainiac who also doesn't fit in.  Gemma is played by Rose Byrne who won the Best Actress Volpi Cup award in 2000 from the Venice International Film Festival forGoddess of 1967.  She has also played in ""Troy,"" ""Wicker Park,"" and ""Two Hands"" with Heath Ledger.  She & Lee generate an offbeat chemistry.  Placid's rebellion leads him to pattern his dress and hair after American president George W. Bush.  This leads him to being hired into an insurance firm and fast tracked with Jane played by Saskia Smith who likes to take pleasure breaks in the stationery closet.  Placid fends off three attackers and persuades one dimwitted student to chain himself without clothes to Gemma's table leg by a dog collar in order to win her affections.  Australian playwright Tony McNamara adapted the screenplay from his stage play ""The Cafe Latte Kid.""  Film Movement has presented another unusual international film that is well worth seeing.

876896,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B00075WB3W,Margaux Paschke,"[0, 0]","This movie is a quirky delight.  The romantic lead is an odd young man on the verge of graduating high school and although he does not possess Hollywood good looks, he is endearing all the same.  He has been tortured by the social elite of his school all his life but his ""new age"" hipster parents might have a LOT to answer for, say for instance, making him start school in a dress so they could address their issues with gender discrimination.The main character is aptly named - Placid Lake - as it foreshadows.  He exhibits calmness, no matter the storm around him, with an unfathomable depth.  Everything in this movie has something to say -  starting with the title, the reworking of his winning film project, and Placid thinking he could fly and then working at Icarius Insurance - but the scariest truths are those that are said in asides.  Placid's mentor at work was a chilling mix of platitudes and honesty.  The dialogue is a polished jewel and I am impressed with the acting, the first time direction (Tony McNamara) and all the rest.This movie addresses so many issues and confronts them with humor, dark and light.  There are no neatly packaged solutions provided but a nice summation of embracing yourself in all your flawed glory.

876897,A1D3XQC2DIT,B00075WB3W,Peter Shermeta,"[6, 6]","The Rage in Placid Lake is another gem to which my eyes were opened by the power of recommendation. It is that same recommendation that I now gladly distribute.You may or may not have ever heard of Australian Indie Rocker Ben Lee. I cannot say that I am familiar with his catalog of music, but I can say that he was very entertaining as Placid Lake, our young protagonist who struggles to see how, or even if, his pure-bred individuality fits into today's conformist society.Placid Lake is a rebel without a cause born of wildly outlandish parents who seem not to have their feet firmly planted anywhere near reality. His parents promote every activity for Placid to develop his own identity and to buck the system. After an accident, Placid wakes up in the hospital with a new-found drive to legitimize himself in the eyes of society; he wants to get a job selling insurance. The sharp contrast between his upbringing and his epiphany added cozy comic-relief to an intelligent story about the importance of ""self.""The role models in Placid's life were polar extremes. He has his pacifist parents, who spend a little too much time disrobed around the home, and he has his manager at work, who is lost in middle management and has seemingly lost his ability to produce emotion.The conversations that Placid has with his manager were my favorite aspect of the movie. Yes, his perspectives were narrow and extreme, but the points he made were poignant.I also enjoyed Placid's best friend, Gemma. Gemma is a beautiful and intelligent young lady who is pushed urgently by her father to stay on track to someday make incredible breakthroughs in modern science. I like how she was written into the story in a way that Placid was able to do soul searching on behalf of them both. She was a first-hand witness to his journey into corporate monotony, from which they both learned valuable lessons about the direction of their lives.Go ahead; see The Rage in Placid Lake.
