When she has a serious health problem arises, the movie uses flashbacks to tell her story.

The doctors, nurses, police and townspeople have their issues but are good decent folk and will find their way to doing the right thing. Perhaps this version of 1950s small town America never did exist except in the imagination or on film but even if it didn't - one wishes it really had rather than the versions of Sinclair Lewis's small town America described in his novels ""Babbitt"" and ""Main Street"". But in ""Good Morning Miss Dove"" the town and its residents are the unbilled stars of the film !!The movie story line is simple. Ms. Dove {Jennifer Jones} the schools long serving, severe spinster teacher suddenly takes ill and faces a serious life threating operation. As the word spreads - the whole town realizes how many of them she has helped, influenced and molded for the better in her own serious and uncompromising way. As Ms Dove lays in her hospital bed, steely willed and dry eyed she reflects on her life, the choices she made and in flashback scenes we see the good she has done for her students and town by her personnel integrity and willingness to sacrifice self in interest of the commom good. And the townsfolk respond to her illness in a way that is as improbale as it is uplifting - that Ms Dove is revered and beloved but they are just then realizing this !!In 2014, a storyline of this nature may be considered to be impossible and implausible and YET when you view this movie IT WORKS !!  If you ask me how or why , my best answer is that it succeeds thru the emotions it engendered within the its simple scenario that is so honestly portrayed that will truly tug at your heartstrings. Director Henry Koster wrings every last drop of emotion and entertainment value - he is a very underrated director and he positions his camera perfectly for all the films big and intimate individual set piece scenes.Robert Stack , Robert Douglas and a young, awkward {pre TV ""Rifleman"" and 'Branded""} Chuck Connors lend stalward support but this is Ms. Jones film ""Lock, stock and Barrell""! Her restrained performance dominates the film by  every word, body language, clipped / nuanced speach and gesture - she infuses Ms. Dove with warmth and humanity despite the outward personna as cold and severe.To some, this movie may seem to be dated Hokum and overly sentimental but I found it to be a marvelous trip in the ""Way Back Machine"" to a time /era /place less complicated, simpler than today that probaly never really existed any more than Andy Griffiths ""Mayberry"" could have. But that doesn't matter in regards to my recommendation of this movie as an engrossing and rewarding viewing experience espiscally as entertainment for the family and I give it a 5 star rating.",5,An Idealistic 1950s American Tale that will Wrench your Heart Strings !!,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,2784,"['town', 'bathed', 'sunlight', 'imposssibly', 'clean', 'shining', 'populated', 'good', 'people', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'police', 'townspeople', 'have', 'issues', 'are', 'good', 'decent', 'folk', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Perhaps', 'version', '1950s', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'never', 'did', 'exist', 'imagination', 'film', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'really', 'had', 'rather', 'versions', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'described', 'novels', 'Babbitt', 'Main', 'Street', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Miss', 'Dove', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'unbilled', 'stars', 'film', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'Ms.', 'Dove', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'schools', 'long', 'serving', 'severe', 'spinster', 'teacher', 'suddenly', 'ill', 'serious', 'life', 'threating', 'operation', 'word', 'whole', 'town', 'how', 'many', 'helped', 'influenced', 'molded', 'better', 'own', 'serious', 'uncompromising', 'way', 'Ms', 'Dove', 'hospital', 'bed', 'steely', 'willed', 'dry', 'eyed', 'life', 'choices', 'made', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'see', 'good', 'done', 'students', 'town', 'personnel', 'integrity', 'willingness', 'sacrifice', 'self', 'interest', 'commom', 'good', 'townsfolk', 'respond', 'illness', 'way', 'as', 'improbale', 'uplifting', 'Ms', 'Dove', 'revered', 'beloved', 'are', 'just', 'then', 'realizing', '2014', 'storyline', 'nature', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'impossible', 'implausible', 'YET', 'when', 'view', 'movie', 'IT', 'WORKS', 'ask', 'how', 'why', 'best', 'answer', 'emotions', 'engendered', 'simple', 'scenario', 'so', 'honestly', 'portrayed', 'will', 'truly', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'Director', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'last', 'drop', 'emotion', 'entertainment', 'value', 'very', 'underrated', 'director', 'positions', 'camera', 'perfectly', 'films', 'big', 'intimate', 'individual', 'set', 'piece', 'scenes.Robert', 'Stack', 'Robert', 'Douglas', 'young', 'awkward', 'pre', 'TV', 'Rifleman', ""'Branded"", 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'lend', 'stalward', 'support', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'film', 'Lock', 'stock', 'Barrell', 'restrained', 'performance', 'film', 'word', 'body', 'language', 'clipped', '/', 'nuanced', 'speach', 'gesture', 'Ms.', 'Dove', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'outward', 'personna', 'cold', 'severe.To', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'dated', 'Hokum', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'found', 'be', 'marvelous', 'trip', 'Way', 'Back', 'Machine', 'time', '/era', '/place', 'less', 'complicated', 'simpler', 'today', 'never', 'really', 'existed', 'more', 'Andy', 'Griffiths', 'Mayberry', 'could', 'have', ""n't"", 'matter', 'regards', 'recommendation', 'movie', 'engrossing', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience', 'espiscally', 'entertainment', 'family', 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating']","Good Morning, Miss Dove"
