753686,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00009IB18,Byron Kolln,"[3, 4]","This largely unappreciated 80's comedy gem deals with the subject of dating and sex during the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  The humour is derived from the experiences of two very different single girls and what happens to their lives after an eventful summer vacation.Free-spirited Stacy (Lea Thompson) and her timid best friend Melissa (Victoria Jackson) each know the unique joys of casual sex--""This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I remember when it was actually fun to say, ""WOW, that really felt great! What's your name again?"".But when Stacy starts reading stories about the growing fear of AIDS, she ponders the loose way in which she has governed her sex-life.  She and Melissa pack up and head to an exclusive health resort where they start exploring the idea of settling down with the perfect Mr. Right.Based on the book by Wendy Goldman and Judy Toll, CASUAL SEX? is one of those classic 80's comedies where everyone seems to remember the movie poster, but not the film itself.  That's a real shame, because the film still offers valuable opinions and ideas about dating and sex in a world where those activities hold very real dangers.  That said, the movie is still hilariously funny, with Thompson and Jackson both incredibly-talented actresses who totally engage the audience with their thoughtful performances.Co-starring Andrew 'Dice' Clay, Stephen Shellen, Mary Gross and Jerry Levine, CASUAL SEX? is a must for 80's movie lovers and those wanting to see a very intelligent romantic comedy about sexual mores in the decade where innocence was truly lost forever.The DVD is stacked with a few worthwhile extras, like deleted scenes and an alternate ending.

753689,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00009IB18,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 2]","80s teen-movie queen Lea Thompson and Saturday Night Live star Victoria Jackson star in this quaintly nostalgic film which addresses the efficacy of casual sex.  The film is based on a play by the same name, and it came at an interesting juncture in history;  the mid-80s saw the sexual revolution winding down & people were becoming more & more aware of the really nasty STDs being spread around - including the ""brand new"" one known as AIDS.  This caused many people to do a lot of re-thinking about their nocturnal habits, and this is the focus of the present film.Lea Thompson plays a promiscuous woman who finds herself examing her dangerous practices.  She and her much-less sexually experienced friend (Jackson) take off to spend time at a health spa (another staple of the mid-80s!) to ensure that any men they happen to sleep with will be safe.While there, they come across an ego maniac from Jersey (played by the venerable Andrew Dice Clay) who believes he knows what women want.  Interestingly, all three characters go through some poignant transformations during the film.The special features contain an alternate ending.  I'm glad they didn't use it as it was very deus ex machina.  That said, it's still worth viewing as Thompson is a knockout while wearing a wedding dress!Some may argue that the regular ending is a bit contrived, but I would disagree.  For me, it factored into the whole premise of the plot, which was that the mid-80s was a time in which people needed to look past sex & start thinking more about relationships.  For me, the movie is actually trenchant in its portrayal of how life doesn't always turn out the way we think it will.  People change, and occasionally they even improve upon what they were previously.As Lea Thompson's #1 fan, I find it my duty to extol all of her movies.  That said, this is a great 80s flick whether you're a big fan of her's or not.  The fact that we get a few shots of both girls' posteriors is an added bonus, although the film shied away from having a whole lot of skin in it (despite several opportunities!).

Each woman has a different story, with Melissa being slightly repressed and only having slept with 2 guys in her life, and Stacey being a formerly promiscuous girl who is trying to change her lifestyle.Because of its title, the picture on the box cover, the obscure description on the back of the box, and the inclusion of the infamous Andrew Dice Clay, you might expect this movie to be filled with formulaic sexual hi-jinks and crude humor.  Furthermore, because of the time period in which the movie was released, you might also expect it to be somewhat dated.This movie turns out to be quite a nice suprise, dealing with some issues that are contemporary (such as AIDS) and some that are timeless (such as rushing into committments) in a fairly tactful way.  Aside from some brief nudity, the movie, I think is appropriate and informative for teenagers who are about to venture out into the dating world.Thompson's character is especially interesting in that she is afraid of the AIDS-risk that comes with casual sex and, accordingly, wants a long term relationship.  But, due to her apprehensions, she rushes headfirst into a committment with a guy who turns out to be a very handsome, but unrealistic slacker.  She takes a step toward maturity and shows strength in breaking the committment before it goes too far.  Jackson's character is less interesting.In sum, I would not recommend this movie as a romantic comedy, and its definitely not a Spring Break flick.  The acting isn't that great either.
