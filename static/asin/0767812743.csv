I can't give it 5 stars by any means because it stretches the  boundaries of reality just a tad too far (Garcia would have spent a  verrrrry long time locked up somewhere for the junk he pulled in this  movie), but it was still very good.

I believe that I saw it once before, right after it first released back in 1998; you'd think that I would have learned my lesson the first time.What. . . a. . . crock.  And that crock ain't full of butter.  This has to be one of the most contrived scenarios ever in film.  What?  You've got a cop named Frank -- Andy Garcia -- who has a son Matt -- Joseph Cross -- where that son needs a bone marrow transplant, and the only person in the whole wide world is a psychopathic killer -- Michael Keaton -- who's a match.  Sure.  So we know that both the psycho and the son will have surgery, and you know things will go terribly wrong, and you know that Mr. Keaton's gonna go all Silence-of-the-Lambs (SOTL) all over everybody.  &#34;Clarice, and what did you think about while watching this film?  How b-a-a-a-a-d it was?  Perhaps you should have slaughtered it yourself and saved everyone the misery.&#34;  Har har.Talking about SOTL. . . .  Obviously, the writer and director &#34;borrowed&#34; from that far superior film here, what with some of the stupid stuff with the Keaton character being a Hannibal Lecter-like dude.  But really, if you're going to &#34;borrow&#34; something, why don't you take the best parts while borrowing, not the worst parts?  I was laughing out loud in a couple of scenes where I was supposed to be hiding under a blanket, I think.Well, I think that 1998 was about the same time where Mr. Keaton -- who was in some really funny movies way back when, remember?  Like &#34;Night Shift&#34; and the whole &#34;let's feed mayonnaise to the tuna fish!&#34; line? -- and his career decided to take a swan dive.  And this film does a horrible belly flop of its own, right into the tank.If a doctor came to me and said, &#34;You need a bone marrow transplant to save your life, but to get that transplant, you'll have to watch 'Desperate Measures' first.&#34;  I think I'd respond, &#34;Get me my lawyer.

It was probably classed as ""Restricted"" because of some scenes where the criminal threatens the child.I watched this film on TV with my 11-year-old daughter, and we both really enjoyed it.  I thought the actors' performances were fantastic.  The reason my daughter enjoyed the film was because it was about a child's situation.  I had to explain a few details to her, as we watched, but she was caught up in the story of the child who needed a bone-marrow transplant, and all that happened leading up to it. Andy Garcia plays a very loving father, who will do ANYTHING to help his son, thus overshawding the violence in the film.  This is not a film kids under 15 should watch by themselves, but with parents, it would be quite OK.Michael Keaton turns in a really masterful performance as a serial murderer with a super-high IQ, who manages to turn his supposed aquiescene to the bone-marrow donation into a masterful escape plan.

We avoid the easy tear forcing unreal situations like when the child is confronted to the escaping criminal who had taken him hostage, but we are not far from it with a child of 9 slightly too mature for his breeches. The female doctor, or rather surgeon is quite valiant and faces danger with elegance and courage. But in spite of all it is nothing but an adventure film more than a thriller because we know the transplant will take place, hence we know the end and we also know that the killer is going to try to escape again and the last scene is outrageously amateurish on the side of the security forces.

The plot might have holes large enough to sail a barge through, and yes, it is quite implausable, but it's hard to completely diss a movie with performances and direction as good as this.Michael Keaton is eerily menacing as Peter McCabe in this film.  He's smart, dangerous, and unpredictable, just like the character requires.  Keaton easily does his best work yet as a serious actor.  Andy Garcia proves once again that THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD was not a fluke, and that he really is capable of turning in one fine performance after another.  While a couple of the supporting performances aren't up to the level they should be, it doesn't pull down the film.The direction by Barbet Schroeder is brilliant.  THe noir style that the film was shot in works extremely well for the type of film this is.  His odd camera angles and dark, brooding shots work perfectly with the dark story.  The look of the smoke and fire is perfectly shot, and he should commend his cinematographer.The suspense, however, is what keeps this film kicking.  Even though the lack plot tends to drag down a little bit of the film, it's still a guessing game most of the time, and Schroeder knows how to play this up.  It's a shame that critics like Leonard Maltin couldn't look past the implausability at the truly excellent moments of the film.  After all, they give truly implausable movies like CON AIR good reviews, and this film is FAR more realistic.DESPERATE MEASURES is a greatly underrated film that deserves a look.

It really reminded me of Speed in some stark way. Michael Keaton acts great, trying to be Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal. He pulls it of well. Andy Garcia does an OK job but his acting wasn't spectacular. For some inane reason I wanted Keaton's evil character to win through in the end. Wasn't he abused or something as a child? Again that's reverse psychology - the viewer going for the bad guy aka Hannibal. The Australian DVD version has about 30 extra minutes of interviews & behind the scenes footage. That is something you Americans it looks like, don't appear to have. But we missed out - we didn't have any closed captions or subtitles. That would've been handy considering some of the dialogue was incomprehensible. Overall I think this movie was too fast for it's own good. It should have slowed down a bit so the viewer isn't overloaded with too much pace. The aftertaste of the movie was one where you won't want to watch it again.

The writers of ""Desperate Measures"" apparently thought an interesting and coherent storyline would get them a seat in the death house because they avoided anything even remotely connected to reality in this movie.First, there's the eminently annoying Andy Garcia. His usual tics are in full bloom - this guy has more twitches than Clint Eastwood on speed. His son needs a bone marrow transplant, and the only human being on the entire earth who is a match is psycho killer Michael Keaton.The movie is about how Garcia tries to keep the nutcase alive after he torches the hospital personnel and shoots all the cops in his escape attempt. The boy who plays the son is adorable; one of the few kids who actually ACTS like a kid. And Michael Keaton really has a knack for psycho parts (although I still miss his ""Batman"" hero performances.) Both Keaton and the kid are the only reason it even merits two stars.But it's the idea that no matter what this guy does, who he kills, he MUST live so Garcia's kid can get a transplant. After one of the many slaughter scenes in the movie, the police captain says to Garcia, ""How many cops have to die so your son can live?""Good freaking question!",2,Annoying snore...,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,1264,"[""'m"", 'wondering', 'when', 'became', 'federal', 'crime', 'have', 'PLOT', 'movie', 'anymore', 'writers', 'Desperate', 'Measures', 'apparently', 'thought', 'interesting', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'would', 'get', 'seat', 'death', 'house', 'avoided', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'connected', 'reality', 'movie.First', 'eminently', 'annoying', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'usual', 'tics', 'are', 'full', 'bloom', 'guy', 'more', 'twitches', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'speed', 'son', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', 'only', 'human', 'being', 'entire', 'earth', 'who', 'match', 'psycho', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Keaton.The', 'movie', 'how', 'Garcia', 'keep', 'nutcase', 'alive', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'shoots', 'cops', 'escape', 'attempt', 'boy', 'who', 'son', 'adorable', 'one', 'few', 'kids', 'who', 'actually', 'ACTS', 'kid', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'really', 'knack', 'psycho', 'parts', 'still', 'miss', 'Batman', 'hero', 'performances', 'Keaton', 'kid', 'are', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'two', 'stars.But', 'idea', 'matter', 'what', 'guy', 'who', 'MUST', 'live', 'so', 'Garcia', 'kid', 'can', 'get', 'transplant', 'one', 'many', 'slaughter', 'scenes', 'movie', 'police', 'captain', 'Garcia', 'How', 'many', 'cops', 'have', 'die', 'so', 'son', 'can', 'live', 'Good', 'freaking', 'question']",N/A

I could actually believe him as a sociopath. Andy Garcia delivers a good performance as a father who will stop at nothing to save his sons life. But his acting does not come up to the same standard as Mr. Keaton's in this movie.The movie is about a father who is trying to save his son's life. His son is dying of cancer and needs a bone marrow transplant. But we learn at the begining of the movie that there are no donor's that match. Garcia, as a police officer, and the boys father illegally breaks into the FBI's computer in order to use their resoures to find a compatible donor. And he does, in the form of an inmate played by Keaton.Keaton's character has the right blood type to give the boy the required bone marrow. He finally agrees to help the boy. We see him prepare for what he hopes will be his escape to freedom from the hospital. Will he escape or decide to take his one chance at redemption by helping this boy. And if this would have been played out as a story of redemption, it would have easily gotten a five star rating.But it seems a suspense thriller was wanted instead of a great drama. So Keaton escapes. And we have the time critical chase. The police just want him caught dead or alive. Of course Garcia's character needs him alive, in order to save his boy. Would any of this happen in real life....no chance. But it does make for a fast pace thriller. You will be caught up in the great direction and wounderful cinematography.

11665,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0767812743,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","Desperate Measures (Barbet Schroeder, 1998)I'm never sure whether I'm going to like a Barbet Schroeder flick when I sit down to watch it. Half the time he pulls off amazing feats of grace under pressure (Barfly, Reversal of Fortune), and the other half of the time he crafts enjoyable if mindless fluff that stands one viewing well, two viewings passably, and pales by the third (Single White Female, Kiss of Death). Five minutes into Desperate Measures, I was convinced it was the latter; a day after watching it, I'm still not convinced it's the former, but I'm farther along the road than I was at that point.Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton) is a highly intelligent psychopath, a less likable Hannibal Lecter, whose bone marrow happens to be a match for the dying son of Frank Conner (Andy Garcia). All Conner has to do is convince McCabe to be a donor to save his son, and keep McCabe from escaping somewhere between going out of his cell and going back into his cell. Needless to say, that doesn't work, or it would be a very, very short film.Much of the movie's appeal rests solely on the head of Andy Garcia, one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, and one of the most underrated as well. He's not as engaging here as he is in his best roles (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Black Rain, Dead Again, etc.), but his acting ability is enough to make the film watchable. Keaton seems constricted by his role, but one gets the impression that has more to do with the director than the actor himself. A number of decent minor roles also show up in the film (Marcia Gay Harden is especially pleasing as the doctor slated to perform the operation, who gets caught up in the whole mess).If plot's more important to you than acting, however, don't bother with this one. Each &quot;twist&quot; can be seen coming a mile off, and if the ending doesn't make you want to seek Schroeder out and smack him personally, I'll eat my review.

Take one empathetic hero (Andy Garcia), and add a strong motivation in the form of a dying child. Match him with a hateful villain (Michael Keaton) with an equal and opposite motivation - he's a jailed sociopath with one chance at freedom. Force them into visually spectacular conflict (lots of shooting and explosions) in a confined arena (the hospital). Add plot holes freely to escape from logical dead ends (cutting chains with surgical lasers; running with a wounded leg; fantastically inept cops). Increase the pace towards a life-or-death climax (the car chase and the bridge) in which the hero triumphs and the villain dies (or escapes to make way for a sequel). Roll credits. Admittedly, it kind of works here, but nowhere near enough. The essential problem is one of tone: the terminal illness of a child and the possible redemption of a cooperative criminal is simply an unsuitable basis for an action-thriller. It makes the filmmakers seem not only flippant, but transparently incompetent at manipulating our emotions. There is, potentially, a good story about a criminal's redemption to be told from this film's point of departure - a powerful drama with the tone of ""Dead Man Walking"" rather than ""Lethal Weapon"" - and especially with this cast. Michael Keaton has enough moral ambiguity for us to believe him as a killer who might choose to do something good.
