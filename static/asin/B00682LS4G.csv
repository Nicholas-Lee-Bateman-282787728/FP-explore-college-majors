1512911,AAZRWLML88IZK,B00682LS4G,A kids review,"[6, 10]","Let's be fair here: some inspirational cinema may be a bit obtuse and unsophisticated, but there are plenty of worse films that don't preach any particular spiritual message. Case in point: Abduction, which stars Twilight heartthrob Taylor Lautner as Nathan Harper, a teen who, while researching for a school project on missing children, discovers that his true identity has been kept hidden from him all his life. As Nathan uncovers more about his past, he and his friend Karen are plunged into the dangerous world of his biological father, a former CIA agent embroiled in an espionage war. Apart from Lautner, who has yet to establish himself as an actor of some range, the cast is surprisingly solid: Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello, and even the original Dragon Tattoo star, Michael Nyqvist are all on board here. I say ""surprisingly"" because, despite this pedigree, Abduction is one of the worst films I saw in 2011. The film is soulless and incompetent.

A CIA operative (those aren't supposed to work inside the US) who is supposed to be guarding this kid while pretending to be his mother for the last 14 years or so, beats down one bad buy and doesn't pick his gun up. Doesn't go for her own either. Predictably she promptly gets shot with a small caliber silenced weapon and drops stone dead. The second fake family member gets killed with equal ease while telling the dumb as a fence post kid to run. Kid stands and waits for bad guys to come and shoot him too, then finally runs off straight down the middle of the well lit street.Then he remembers he has abandoned his neighbor's teen daughter and goes back for her, then vanquishes the remaining assassin who has killed his 'parents' but leaves him lying next to his gun and runs out of the house. Somehow a bomb has materialized in the kitchen oven so the house blows up. Neither bad guy ever had a chance to put it there.Fleeing he calls the cops and instead gets put directly through to the CIA. Somehow the European bad guys have also tapped the entire US phone system and hear everything.At some point there is a CIA briefing where they explain that the idiot kid's father has stolen a list of dishonest CIA folks from someone in Europe. Ten days ago. But hang on, this all started about 14 years ago, what has 10 days ago got to do with anything? It's the idiot kid trying to find his real self that has triggered this. How do the bad guys know that his real father has anything to do with him? Did it just so happen that ten days and ten years got mixed up?Later the kids find their way to a safe house. So, knowing the CIA is all over the phone system what do they do? They try to call someone and immediately blow their safe house. IQ in single digits?Everyone is instantly on their trail, almost like they had the script to refer to.Later they arrange a meeting with the CIA, the Europeans take down all the CIA security team without being spotted. If the CIA are this bad we need to fire them all.This is a teen fantasy film apparently written by a 13 year old.

1512980,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00682LS4G,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","ABDUCTION (Dir. John Singleton, 2011, 106 minutes) is a good enough popcorn/rainy-week-end actioner although I find it a bit mistitled. Though obviously geared toward teens, in my opinion, it seems to offer a seamless entry into the more sophisticated world of cinema for any budding film buffs and critics out there.Taylor Lautner (as if you needed reminding this is Jake the Werewolf Indian from TWILIGHT) plays Nathan Harper, a dopey drunkard high school senior in what I think is supposed to be Pittsburgh. The beginning of this film showing Nathan and his two stupid friends is enough to put you off it - but do not give up too easily. The real action is about to begin.And yes, as parodied and as promised, he does have a nicely revealing shirtless scene which I suspect he'll have in every one of his films. The camera does love this boy, but then Hollywood has a rule about beefcake: ""show it every time"".While hovering around a sickly-looking girl he's not too certain how to handle, Nathan and the girl find his photo on a website of missing children. Of course the irony of this awful discovery is that it is a genuine enough site, and Nathan really isn't the son of his parents - but the site is also a plant by an ""intelligence broker"" who is looking for Nathan's real father.So he figures ""one of his websites"" (to quote the CIA) will catch Nathan one day and lead him to Nathan's father. Nathan's father, a CIA black-ops hero, has a list of American spies selling secrets to any buyer, and the evil intelligence broker Nikola Kozlow (the likeable Michael Nyqvist) will stop at nothing to get back what he sees as his intelligence property.A genuine surprise here is the star power Lautner was handed: Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs and Alfred Molina. Everyone hands in good performances, and the stars are just as they should be. This film reminds me you don't really need excessive violence, sex, mad vehicle chases or a script that is 88% swearing to have a compelling film. By today's standards, this may seem a bit Old School, but that's my school and it is a good one.ABDUCTION is a satisfactory tribute to the magic brought by the right kind of star power. Alfred Molina is a CIA bigwig in charge of guarding Nathan. Jason Isaacs is brilliant as Nathan's adopted father who raises him to be CIA material in case anyone ever pursues him. The only problem here is Lautner, who is learning to act, I admit, but as of now is really just young beefcake and little else. In fact aside from his handsome looks, the thing I like most about him could be his downfall: his extremely gay-sounding voice. Hey, I love it but I think ... sooner or later, talk's going to begin and some has already begun.If anything is missing from this film, it is a genuine gung-ho spirit. I can see why a fun vacation for the British is to come over here and make a couple of films, when they're not doing British theater. And from what I have read about the backstory of this film, well, let's say they produced a pretty good work for a slapdash storyline.

While the film is not without flaws in the plot and overdoes it a bit in the killing arena, it still manages to present a story that has more than one direction to follow.Nathan (Taylor Lautner) is a likable high school teenager whose friends Gilly (Denzel Whitaker) and Billy (Allen Williamson) share a rather dangerous lust for life.  Nathan's parents (Maria Bello and Ken Arnold) are supportive: the father teaches Nathan martial arts, the mother runs a strict household.  Nathan gets drunk at a party, is grounded, and when given an assignment in Sociology with his across the street neighbor Karen (Lily Collins) the two discover a website for missing children: Nathan's picture appears there and that begins the trek to discover who his real parents are.  In the process his adoptive parents are killed by a Russian group and Nathan and Karen are on the run.  The CIA chief (Alfred Molina) informs the runaways that they are in danger and must hide.  Nathan realizes he holds a code to an encrypted number system and must retain that at all costs.  The plots gets a bit confused when we discover that Nathan's psychiatrist (Sigourney Weaver) is also with the CIA and that Nathan is to pass the code in a certain convoluted manner, all the while Nathan is looking for his biological father and for some meaning to his lifeLautner and Collins have a credible screen chemistry and it appears that Lautner is doing the majority of the stunts himself. This is a tense hunt and chase thriller, and while there are some holes in the story that need better definition and a huge cast of hunters for the code being killed right and left and never seem to be diminished in additional help (!), the pace is breakneck and the ending is satisfactory.  This marks a fine debut of Taylor Lautner as a lead man - and he is supported by a very fine and very large cast of actors.

I actually thought this movie would be a rendition of Jason Bourne except only for little kids. But I was wrong. This movie is exciting and okay at the same time thats why I gave it four stars. Taylor Lautner does a brilliant performance as Nathan Price a boy who has everything, good friends, good grades, smarts and looks but there is always something missing in his life. He wonders if his parents are really his parents and he keeps having the same dream of a woman being killed every day. He goes to a shrink, which is not normal. One day when two men come knocking on his door, asking for him. They kill his parents who earlier reveal to him that they are not his parents. And next thing you know he is on a quest for the truth, his house gets blown up, his neighbor who is also the girl he has feelings for Karen Murphy goes on the run with him as well. His shrink which is actually one of the CIA agents helps him elude capture by ""seemingly"" killing herself. There are scenes that make you want to hold your breath and then there are scenes that make you say ""Okay."" The girl that plays Karen Murphy with him, does an excellent job as his love interest.And being the one person that he trusts. And there is make out scene is nothing short of very hot and steamy, thats a scene where it makes you want to hold your breath. This movie is great, and it is like a Jason Bourne, but a shorter, final version. A mystery. Perfect for teenagers. Adults, eehhh, you may not look this movie too much. But I'm pretty sure adults will like it. Taylor Lautners acting could have been a little more better, but he did a borderline job of awesome and okay.

There's also a good amount of overdone music to go along with the movie, with lots of one-dimensional cardbord cutout characters.However it does sport a good cast, Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly) and Jason Issacs (The Patriot) play Nathan's parents, Alfred Molina is typical as a high ranking CIA official and Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Galaxy Quest) is his therapist who wants to help him find out the truth behind what's going on. There's the usual girlfriend played by Lily Collins (Mirror Mirror, The Blind Side) who is an extremely beautiful girl but isn't given much more to do than run and look scared.Most films like this need to be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe a whole shaker and ""Adbuction"" is no exception. But it does breeze by and even with all the cliches it stays a good clip and again the cast does help. Lautner does have a good screen presence outside of the Twlight franchise and does well in this action/spy flick. While not a great movie it is acceptable and decent. ** out of 4 stars.",3,"I've seen worse, far worse than this",1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,1785,"['4', 'soon', 'be', '5', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Jacob', 'Nathan', 'typical', 'young', 'teenage', 'good', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'rage', 'issues', 'also', 'strange', 'dreams', 'involving', 'woman', 'being', 'attacked', 'guy', 'mask', 'strange', 'feeling', 'life', 'not', 'what', 'what', 'are', 'chances', 'right', 'Well', 'stumbling', 'missing', 'children', 'website', 'discovering', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'abducted', 'may', 'have', 'possibly', 'just', 'possibly', 'lead', 'title', 'film', 'who', 'Well', 'knew', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'need', 'anything', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'rest', 'film', 'usual', 'cliches', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'fake', 'then', 'action', 'where', 'must', 'course', 'supsend', 'disbelief', 'also', 'good', 'amount', 'overdone', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'movie', 'lots', 'one-dimensional', 'cardbord', 'cutout', 'characters.However', 'sport', 'good', 'cast', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'Jason', 'Issacs', 'Patriot', 'play', 'Nathan', 'parents', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'typical', 'high', 'ranking', 'CIA', 'official', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Alien', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'therapist', 'who', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'what', 'going', 'usual', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Blind', 'Side', 'who', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'girl', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'run', 'look', 'scared.Most', 'films', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'maybe', 'whole', 'shaker', 'Adbuction', 'exception', 'breeze', 'even', 'cliches', 'good', 'clip', 'again', 'cast', 'help', 'Lautner', 'have', 'good', 'screen', 'presence', 'Twlight', 'franchise', 'well', 'action/spy', 'flick', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'decent', '**', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Personally I really enjoyed this movie. I do think that this movie was geared to high school kids but there is enough action in it to keep any movie fan entertained. There is some really cheesy lines in this movie but I don't find either of the actors to be bad. Taylor Lautner is really improving with each movie and let's face it the guy is likeable he has the charisma, the charm, and the ability to do his stunts. I hope we will actually be seeing a lot more of him in movies because I think he will only continue to improve and impress audiences. This movie I am glad to own it is not necessarily something I will watch every day but I don't think it is as bad as people claim it is just because of their hatred for the actor or his previous work.

1513032,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B00682LS4G,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[2, 3]","Here I am reviewing Abduction a mediocre action flick. I have been doing most of my reviews on my new account I have been reviewing movies from 2002 & 1992 there & other stuff. Now I heard this movie was the worst of all time it'sp  i  s  s poor but it's not horrible cause I knew it was going to be bad going in I have seen movies that are worse than Abduction believe me. To me a disappointing movie like Predators a couple of years ago is worse than a movie that you know is going to be bad. Abduction was directed by John Singleton he directed Boyz N The Hood, Poetic Justice, Shaft & 2 Fast 2 Furious & I can say that all those movies he directed are better than Abduction. It stars Taylor Lautner as Nathan, Lily Collins as Karen Murphy, Sigourney Weaver as Dr Jeri Bennett & Alferd. That's pretty much the cast. The movie starts off like a bad ABC Family original movie. Our ""hero"" Nathan & this girl Karen find out about he's some missing kid these guys from The Govenment go after they kill his parents & in 1 of the most laughable things ever Taylor Lautner beats up this big bald. He tells them that there is a bomb in the house so they run out of there like there Chuck Norris. I guess I don't need to see Chuck Norris do that anymore casue we got a bad a  s  s like Taylor Lautner to do it now. LOL! He takes his girl to the hostpital he tries to call the cops & it's those guys who are after him his Psychiatrist Dr Geri Bennett helps him & Karen escape she tells them to go to Arlington Virgina. He goes to this apartment he finds out where his mothers grave is at. Skipping ahead Karen finds fresh flowers on his mother's grave & they find out they are delivered from New Braska they have this friend that makes fake ID's & they get some trian tickets. So they board this train Karen gets them something to eat they have this guy following them he takes the girl ties her up somewhere & then you have another awful fight with Taylor Lautner he kills this dude & throws him from the train. The train comes to a stop they run off some CIA agents stop them & tell them that there on their. He finds out that this cell phone that he took from the safe house has a list of agents that will be endangered if this Russian dude gets it.l You have these group of men take down Agent Burton's men a really forgettable shoot out Nathan & Karen escape. He's going to meet with that Russian guy & give him the list. Their friend sets them up with baseball tickets so he meets that guy at a baseball game of all places in front ofG  o  d & everybody he even brings a gun to use on The Russian. Until the bad guy gets the gun & he runs off. His real Dad calls him & leads him outside. Where is real Dad uses a sniper rifle & kills the villain & that's pretty much the movie. I mean I have seen better types of movies where The Government knows everything about you like The Adjustment Bureau or even Land Of The Free The Government is chasing after Jeff Speakman & his family in the movie. I can't say it's the worst movie ever made cause I have seen worse. But I have seen it done better with a stronger lead. Taylor Lautner was a weak lead he was the problem I don't buy him as an action star. Lily Collins was suprisingly good though. Sigourney Weaver wasn't given much to do. Alfred Molina was just there nothing to write home about at all.

Although it started just a wee bit slow, it quickly got hot and carried a lot of action all through the movie.  It was basically CIA spy stuff and running from the bad guys.The movie begins with 3 guy friends on a joy ride somewhere in the hills around (what I believe is) Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  The guy on the hood is Nathan Price (Taylor Lautner--the American Indian boy/werewolf) from the Twilight movie series).  They head over to a party, drink, and have a good time.  Nathan wakes up the next morning, passed out on the lawn.  His father comes to get him, followed by a slug-it-out on the lawn learn-how-to-take-care-of-yourself very physical ""discussion"".  Mom pretty much stands by and watches for awhile until she finally breaks it up, which seems a little odd for a mother, since these are some pretty good punches.We next see Nathan in the office of his therapist.  Dr. Jerry Bennet (Sigorney Weaver) has been seeing Nathan for quite some time.  He has some anger issues (where it sounds like he blows his cork) and repetitive dreams of a woman being killed.  First, the pretty woman is singing to him, and then she is attacked and killed by a man dressed in black.All and all, things are relatively fine. He loves his parents; they seem to enjoy each other and Nathan seems like a pretty normal teenager.  He also seems to like the girl across the street, Karen (Lily Collins).When the Sociology teacher pairs Nathan and Karen together on a 10-page report and they begin researching ""Missing Children"" on the web, Nathan discovers his own photo.  He even has the shirt in the photo.  When he contacts someone on the website to find out more, the xxxx hits the fan.  The contact in New York, reaches out to someone in London.  To say that things ""heat up,"" fast becomes an understatement and the CIA is also involved.Again, this is an action/chase/spy type film and quite good.  I was between a 4 and 5 star on it, so I rounded up.  As a few reviewers mentioned, there really was no chemistry between Nathan and Karen.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[0, 0]","When I went to see this movie, a group of young girls up the back, tittered during the love scenes, and remained quiet during the action scenes.I have seen all the Twilight movies, even though I am not the demographic. I'm on Team Vulturi.The movie starts at a party where our hero drinks too much, and shares long lingering looks with the girl next door, and nearly gets in a fight with her toolish  boyfriend, who on an unconscious level realises there must be some attraction between these two.On a more unconscious level our hero wakes up on the lawn the following morning while the girls remove litter from the lawn.  He is shirtless.  Titters of recognition from the back. When he returns home the man he knows as his father engages him in a fight  repeatedly hitting him.  This seems like parental abuse as the woman he knows as his mother looks on unconcerned. He has mad karate skills.Later working on the school project, with the aforementioned girl next door who we now notice has rather large eyebrows, they see an age enhanced photo of a missing child who looks like him.  What he does next drives the narrative of the entire movie, with a series of stunning action events forcing him to question his entire existence, and no one is who or  what they appear to be, apart from eyebrow girl.He and eyebrow girl flee for their lives, and now he must go back to a past he never knew he had to discover who he really is, what really happened, and why both the CIA and an international crime syndicate wants to capture him now.Eyebrow girl is played by Lily Collins, daughter of musician Phil. You may recognise her as the sister from The Blind Side. And apparently she is going to be Snow White in Snow White.  Those eyebrows are going places.I found the movie quite engaging. Lautner has great Karate skills, and the action scenes were well done.  The fact that he has won several gold medals on the World stage, and done Karate from an early age gave him a certain authority and believability in these scenes.Some people claim there was not enough chemistry between the two stars.  I did not find this to be the case, and apparently she and Taylor Lautner dated in real life for a while, so there was some attraction. Perhaps some of the young ladies thought they could do a better job in those scenes.  By the way, there is only one scene where it gets steamy and that gets interrupted.I think Taylor Lautner is most likely of the Twilight stars to be a big boxoffice star after the Twilight series is over.

But sadly, once that role has finished its run, there's nothing left. They don't have the ability or reach of more talented performers. It's not a personal knock against Lautner - many artists fit this description. Unfortunately, depending on their current Q Score/hype, most fans can't or won't acknowledge it. (i.e. Daniel Radcliffe)There's a saying: Better to have played one game in the majors - rather than ten years in the minors. You can make an okay living playing in the minors, but the point isn't to get a regular paycheck. The goal is the Big Show.So Taylor can always look back and say that he was once on top of this world of eight billion souls. Not something many people can honestly claim.In this decently-scripted and well-worn film, Lautner plays Nathan, a young high school student who never quite fits in. He's popular enough, certainly handsome enough. But there's a lingering vagueness about his life, an unexpressed fear that has haunted him since he was a small child. His parents have tried to help with years of therapy, and for the most part, they've succeeded. Still, like all kids with caring parents, they insinuate themselves into his life - they worry.However, unlike most families, instead of groundings and chores, his dad forces Nathan to fight - really fight. Washing the car is replaced with hand-to-hand combat MMA style, whenever and wherever, both as punishment and mental/physical preparedness. It's an odd life, but one he's used to.Then by pure happenstance, he's assigned a school project that deals with missing children. A random chance click on the internet brings him face-to-face with: Himself. An age-enhanced image of a child that went missing about the time of his first recollections. The memory that he's been struggling with in therapy - a woman being murdered.Suddenly, the anonymous kid in the 'burbs finds himself in the crosshairs, both figuratively and literally. Determined contractors with serious firearms are hunting him down. His parents are killed and he's on the run.Lautner certainly looks and moves great, but a wide range of emoting is a skillset he doesn't possess. It's one he may never get. Not for lack of trying I'm certain. But he's wooden and stiff, with little to offer an audience. I think he's a fine young man, and I certainly wish him only success. But the reality is: Fans should enjoy him today because I don't think there are a lot of tomorrows to come.Likeable action/thriller that could've been better served with a more versatile lead.Personal Note: Loved that you never quite see Nathan's biological father played by one of my favorite character actors, Dermot Mulroney. Kept wishing the guys from the tv series '24' would've picked him up, but sadly, it never happened. Unfortunate.

Lily Collins, the female lead, was even worse.Speaking of Ms. Collins, she and Lautner had absolutely zilch for chemistry. The kissing/panting/hugging scenes were cringe-worthy, they were so bad. The relationships between the other actors and actresses were only slightly more believable. And I do mean slightly. The story was excessively slow and boring.

1513117,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B00682LS4G,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[10, 16]","Update December 29, 2011: I just saw an interview with Taylor Lautner, and he explained that John Singleton told them to ""keep going"" with the kissing scene. Now I get why it so awkward. To them, it probably looked ""hot and steamy,"" but to the audience it just looked weird. I'll have to give him a little more credit now that I know it wasn't planned.Original review September 25, 2011: I'm a little conflicted about this film. On one hand I want to say anything and everything Taylor Lautner does is great because I'm a huge Team Jacob fan, think Taylor Lautner is a good actor and I admire his agility when doing physical acting scenes. However, there were definitely some flaws (some trivial and others huge) in this film.Cons: 1) I realize this is going to sound catty, but Lily Collins' eyebrows are distracting. I really wish she'd arch them. I think she's a pretty girl, but I spent entirely too much time fixated on those hairy eyebrows. I'm not trying to be funny or insult her, but they were almost a unibrow and it was bugging me to no end.2) I did not see any chemistry between Taylor Lautner's character Nathan and Lily's character Karen. I kept trying to make myself see it, but it just wasn't happening. I thought he and Kristen Stewart had all kinds of chemistry and even with Taylor Swift in ""Valentine's Day."" I even liked him with Taylor Dooley in ""The Adventures Of Shark Boy & Lava Girl,"" but I was not convinced about Nathan and Karen. The sexy scene on the train, including when she had her legs wrapped around him, did not come off sexy. Is he attractive? Absolutely. But the two together weren't convincing, and I'm not quite sure whether it was him or her but it came across as two people way too inexperienced to pull off passion.3) Somebody correct me on this, but if Nathan was supposed to be 15, then what was up with the line at the end about ""four years""? That made me wonder if he was supposed to be 17. He told his father he had 15 years to be in his life. Did I miss something there? Please let me know if I misunderstood that timeline.4) For the CIA to be so incredibly observant of everything Nathan did, I thought it was incredibly unrealistic that a brotha, Gilly, (played by Denzel Whitaker) completely went undetected through the whole film. He's driving up in flashy cars and wearing bright yellow and selling fake IDs but the CIA totally ignores him. As much as I enjoyed his character and understood why his role kept coming into play, everybody who watched that film knows his character should've been arrested in 2.5 seconds after the CIA got involved. And he consistently kept coming by. So what? The CIA can monitor everything else, but those two can constantly get in touch? If that's the case, just hide out with Gilly. Problem solved.5) Too many actors seemed way too calm in the worst circumstances. People were finding out terrible news and talking in the same tone you'd ask, ""So do you want a banana with your sandwich?"" Pretty much every scene with the CIA should've been far more aggressive. But then there was a bit of overacting during the ""sensitive"" scenes. Nobody wow'd me and made me think, ""I'm TOTALLY convinced. This person may as well be the real character.""And now for the pros:1) I loved how the film incorporated humor in spots that I would've never thought it would work...and it did! (Ex. The joke about not understanding sports but loving popcorn tickled a lot of people in the movie theater I was in.)2) Denzel Whitaker's entire performance--> I like him as an actor. He impressed me in ""The Great Debaters"" and he impressed me in this film. He's really good at acting without trying to be. I'm enjoying watching him grow up.3) Taylor Lautner's action scenes--> I'm getting kinda tired of that jaw biting thing he does whenever he's supposed to be nervous or upset, but he always makes up for it during any action scene. In the ""Twilight"" series, he didn't get to show it off because he was always a werewolf. However, in this film he was CONSTANTLY showing how agile he is and where his strength lies. Every single time the film went into fight mode or escape mode, I perked up in my seat, which is really odd because I don't care for action films. But he's REALLY good at them. I think he could've pulled off this entire film on his own without a love interest, and usually action films need a woman of interest to be good. Not this one though. He could've played a ""Bourne Identity"" style role and been just fine. (And yes, I know there were women in ""Bourne Identity"" but Matt's character wasn't slowed down by them.)4) I really did not understand why the mother wouldn't break up the fight scene in the backyard. I kept thinking, ""What mother would just tolerate this?"" but when I found out why, I thought, ""This was such a smart move. I love that!"" Clever.5) I liked that Nathan made a few dumb choices. I don't think the film would've worked at all if he was on the mark every time. I think it was important that people remembered he's still a teenager and may think he's badder than he really is; sometimes he was able to outsmart people and other times he wasn't. Smart move.So with all of this said, did I like the film? It was OK. I didn't hate it, didn't love it, but I'm still very much a Taylor Lautner fan. I just felt like there needed to be less awkwardness between a couple characters and a discussion group to flesh out the CIA inconsistency.",3,Taylor finally got his action shine but rest was

Taylor & Lily did an okay job; I thought Lily did an excellent job showing a shell-shocked person after witnessing the murders.  The action was pretty good, and I loved Taylor's various fight scenes.  They were all the more impressive to me, after I read about his martial arts training - his kicks were awesome to watch.The story moved somewhat slowly, but once we got into action scenes, it began to move better.  When Taylor had a couple of shirtless scenes I had to chuckle, as the Americanized voice of Rob Pattinson dryly questioned in my mind, &#34;Doesn't he own a shirt?&#34;  Hence, my Team Jacob title for this post.Was the movie great?  No, not really.  Was the movie a total waste, as some have said?  Not by a long shot.  This movie will never be considered a classic, but the action/fight scenes made it definitely worth a watch.  Some said Lily & Taylor had no chemistry, I thought they looked like two teens who had grown up together and were tentatively taking a chance on the childhood friendship blossoming into a love interest.

I couldn't stand him for 5 minutes in this terribly predictable story. Come on? Did you think you would sell the movie off of offering him as a sex symbol? It starts with the main character getting into an ""almost confrontation"" with a guy at a typical rich kid party that just happens to have 200 kids at a house where the parents aren't home. Come on. Haven't we seen this like a million times already! His friends, no wait, a girl (that he supposedly has some history with) keeps him from getting into a confrontation. Of course she was the typical beauty (I guess?). Then his friends help him to forget about the guy and the girl by offering to get him drunk. Yes, because this is what young people do, right? He takes a drink from a red cup that is so obviously empty and all of sudden wakes up passed out on the lawn with no shirt on, revealing his muscular body. OK, stop right there! No wait, there's more... his father pulls up out of no where, gets him in the car and takes him home to train him in boxing. His mother comes out to ground him for a week for staying out. Then he ends up in therapy because he of course has anger issues. The counseling session was so horrible! Not worth the time. Predictable and lame with no substance at all.

Nathan's character is outgoing (party boy) reckless (rides on top of a car at 65 mph without anything to hold him) seemingly a bad boy (drives a motorcycle and goes to a therapist for anger management). Yet he's a complete softie (""What mom, you don't trust me because I stayed out late and forgot to check-in first?"") that cries multiple times in the movie with no expression on his face while water drips from his eyes.*Lacks a strong connection between characters and audience- There are some movies that you are so wrapped up in the story that you cringe or gasp when bad things happen to the leading actor or actress but in Abduction I really could not have cared less if the Nate or his girl were killed. I think the only people I felt sorry for were the parents who raised Nathan that were shot. That's about it. And they had some of the smaller roles in this movie.*Romance- I normally have no issues with on screen loves but this one annoyed me when the writers kept including cheesy scenarios and dialogue like, ""Nathan, are we going to die?"" Then Nathan slowly walks up to her and grabs her pulling her close. ""No. I won't let that happen."" That is one of a few. The way it was purposely made so dramatic just really bothered me.*No surprises- I don't know if it's just because I have watched too many action movies but there wasn't anything that made me think ""oh wow I wasn't expecting that!"" It wasn't predictable but I didn't think it was very inventive either. I think the most surprise I had was *SPOILER ALERT* when Nathan's biological father shot to bad guy in the end.

1513142,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00682LS4G,trebe,"[0, 0]","Farfetched and formulaic, the action/adventure Abduction (2011) seems to be primarily focused upon entertaining a teenage audience, as the film attempts to capitalize on the popularity of Taylor Lautner, hot from his recent appearances in the Twilight films.  Some spoilers follow.While doing research for a school project with his friend Karen Murphy (Lily Collins), Nathan Harper (Lautner)  discovers evidence that his parents may not be his biological parents.  When Nathan contacts a website for missing kids, his location is traced, black ops terrorist Nikola Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist) is alerted, and a pair of hitmen are deployed to the Harper residence.  Nathan's father (Jason Isaacs) and mother (Maria Bello) are both killed, and their home destroyed, leaving Nathan and an injured Karen in shock.At a hospital, Nathan calls the police, but he gets connected to CIA operative Frank Burton (Albert Molina), who tells him what he already knows, that someone is after him.  With the help of Geri Bennett (Sigourney Weaver), Nathan's psychiatrist, the young couple manage to escape.  Bennett says she works for the CIA, and that Nathan's real father Martin, was also a CIA agent.The pair is soon on their own, following clues that have them on a train bound for Nebraska, with both the CIA and the Kozlow's terrorists tracking them.  Eventually, after surviving several attempts on his life, Harper is contacted by Koslow, and they arrange to meet at a Pittsburg Pirates game.Abducted, actually has no abduction, but is jam packed with clich&eacute;d elements.  It may be unfair to judge the movie by ""adult"" standards, as intended mostly for teens, it has a different set of priorities.  The romance element slows the pace a bit, and probably makes the film longer than it needs to be.  Fortunately Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins (The Blind Side,Mirror Mirror) have very good chemistry, as their characters spend most of the film joined at the hip.  A few years from now, it would not be at all surprising, if the bewitching Collins has the more distinguished career.Lautner handles the action and fight sequences competently enough, but the story lacks credibility, as the screenplay is dialed down so that Nathan Harper can appear to be on equal footing with both the CIA, and a ruthless terrorist.  Those expecting a taught action thriller will probably be disappointed, but Abduction isn't quite as bad as some have said.  Keeping in mind the kind of movie it is, it's a decent watch, particularly while it is available to Prime members.",3,intrigue and romance intended for the Twilight crowd...,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,2548,"['Farfetched', 'formulaic', 'action/adventure', 'Abduction', '2011', 'be', 'primarily', 'focused', 'entertaining', 'teenage', 'audience', 'film', 'attempts', 'capitalize', 'popularity', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'hot', 'recent', 'appearances', 'Twilight', 'films', 'spoilers', 'follow.While', 'doing', 'research', 'school', 'project', 'friend', 'Karen', 'Murphy', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Nathan', 'Harper', 'Lautner', 'evidence', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'biological', 'parents', 'When', 'Nathan', 'website', 'missing', 'kids', 'location', 'traced', 'black', 'ops', 'terrorist', 'Nikola', 'Kozlow', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'alerted', 'pair', 'hitmen', 'are', 'deployed', 'Harper', 'residence', 'Nathan', 'father', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'are', 'killed', 'home', 'destroyed', 'leaving', 'Nathan', 'injured', 'Karen', 'shock.At', 'hospital', 'Nathan', 'police', 'connected', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Frank', 'Burton', 'Albert', 'Molina', 'who', 'what', 'already', 'someone', 'help', 'Geri', 'Bennett', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Nathan', 'psychiatrist', 'young', 'couple', 'manage', 'escape', 'Bennett', 'CIA', 'Nathan', 'real', 'father', 'Martin', 'was', 'also', 'CIA', 'agent.The', 'pair', 'soon', 'own', 'following', 'clues', 'have', 'train', 'bound', 'Nebraska', 'CIA', 'Kozlow', 'terrorists', 'tracking', 'Eventually', 'surviving', 'several', 'attempts', 'life', 'Harper', 'contacted', 'Koslow', 'arrange', 'meet', 'Pittsburg', 'Pirates', 'game.Abducted', 'actually', 'abduction', 'jam', 'packed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'elements', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'judge', 'movie', 'adult', 'standards', 'intended', 'mostly', 'teens', 'different', 'set', 'priorities', 'romance', 'element', 'pace', 'bit', 'probably', 'film', 'longer', 'be', 'Fortunately', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'film', 'joined', 'hip', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'bewitching', 'Collins', 'more', 'distinguished', 'career.Lautner', 'action', 'fight', 'sequences', 'competently', 'enough', 'story', 'credibility', 'screenplay', 'dialed', 'down', 'so', 'Nathan', 'Harper', 'can', 'appear', 'be', 'equal', 'footing', 'CIA', 'ruthless', 'terrorist', 'expecting', 'taught', 'action', 'thriller', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Abduction', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'have', 'said', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'kind', 'movie', 'decent', 'watch', 'particularly', 'available', 'Prime', 'members']",N/A

1513144,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00682LS4G,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","""Abduction"" (directed by John Singleton, his first feature film in six years) looks like a Jason Bourne film without Jason Bourne. You don't have Matt Damon here. What you get in this generic thriller is ""Twilight"" star Taylor Lautner as uninteresting hero, a few veteran actors who look terribly bored, as characters (""good"" and ""bad"" alike) that you really don't care, and a storyline that doesn't make sense. As to the film's action set-pieces, they are not bad, except that they are too few and far between.While doing homework with his childhood friend Karen (Lily Collins) living across the street, an ordinary high school boy Nathan (Taylor Lautner) finds an old photo of himself as a little boy on a missing persons' website. Next moment he is chased by not just one, but two groups of operatives, one led by Michael Nyqvist and the other by Alfred Molina. Nathan sets out to discover the truths about his parents, fending off the chasers.Despite the first-rate supporting cast including Maria Bello, Jason Isaacs and Sigourney Weaver, ""Abduction"" fails to be really involving throughout, with a poorly-written script that does not give us any reason to care what is going on. Things work out too conveniently. Characters' motives are often impossible.I know this is a thriller and I am willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy it. Sadly there is not much that we can enjoy here. The contrived story and implausible setting are fine as long as the film has a natural flow of storytelling and a healthy dose of action, mystery or humor, none of which ""Abduction"" has.",2,Generic Thriller Even Veteran Players Cannot Save,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1571,"['Abduction', 'directed', 'John', 'Singleton', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'six', 'years', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'film', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'here', 'What', 'get', 'generic', 'thriller', 'Twilight', 'star', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'uninteresting', 'hero', 'few', 'veteran', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'terribly', 'bored', 'characters', 'good', 'bad', 'alike', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'between.While', 'doing', 'homework', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Karen', 'Lily', 'Collins', 'living', 'street', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'Nathan', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'old', 'photo', 'little', 'boy', 'missing', 'persons', 'website', 'Next', 'moment', 'chased', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'groups', 'operatives', 'one', 'led', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'other', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Nathan', 'out', 'discover', 'truths', 'parents', 'fending', 'off', 'chasers.Despite', 'first-rate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Abduction', 'fails', 'be', 'really', 'involving', 'poorly-written', 'script', 'not', 'give', 'reason', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'Things', 'work', 'out', 'too', 'conveniently', 'Characters', 'motives', 'are', 'often', 'impossible.I', 'know', 'thriller', 'am', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'Sadly', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'enjoy', 'here', 'contrived', 'story', 'implausible', 'setting', 'are', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'film', 'natural', 'flow', 'storytelling', 'healthy', 'dose', 'action', 'mystery', 'humor', 'none', 'Abduction']",N/A

The premise is somewhat weak; but I hung in there to see what Taylor Lautner would do with this role.
