851345,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002YLCFQ,A. Burchfield,"[3, 4]","I have no idea how historically accurate this movie is but it does have an interesting take on the old legends.The level of detail was interesting, the plot wasn't to bad either- just took upwards of half the movie to really get going.If the movie is historically accurate Arthur's knights were a people called Sarmatians but the look of their recruitment scenes (drafting?)and the use of the term ""Rus"", made me think of what is today Russia. That's quite a change from the usual idea of being from what is now Britain.I noticed several men wearing what I'd call a buzz haircut, kind of a long stubblecut- I don't think that can be accurate given the haircutting tools they'd have had.The story is interesting , Arthur & his men have fulfilled their enlistment agreement and on the day they were due to go free they get one last mission. They are sent north of Hadrians's Wall (that is an impressive set) to rescue a Roman family from the advancing enemy ( I think it was the Woads- Celtic Britons, not the Saxons who are also invading Britian). Arthur and his men aren't at all impressed with the family but they do their duty and bring them south, along with their worker's families and some captive Woads (Guinevere is one of these)which Arthur has freed.Back at the base Arthur decides to remain behind in Britain due to his disgust with what Rome has become (the depiction of the supposedly Christian Romans may offend some but the actions shown are similar to what some early types really did do). Having already defeated the advancing Saxons in one battle in the run to the south Arthur and the Woad people get ready for another battle, this time at Hadrian's Wall. Arthur's men return in time to help out, this is where the movie really gets going- something over an hour into running time. It's a big battle, look at the DVD extra stuff on it, and Arthur is of course victorious.I liked the look of the sets, and of most costuming, the battles looked very well done, I even liked the way many details of the Arthurian legend were worked into the plot ( just differently enough to be something believably and gradually changed over time).I found it hard to accept that Arthur and his men did not wear anything on their heads until the big battle, no matter how hard they fought or how cold it was. I also didn't like their camping out in some freezing woods without any real weather protection. The Woad women going into battle, no problem except for the tops they wore, I think those people would likely have gone into battle bare chested -men or women.I found it interesting that there was no swearing, surprisingly little blood or flying body parts ( was that to help the rating and film budget?).The movie is all right, just slow going, I may skip most of the first half the next time I watch it.",4,"Interesting telling of the tale, slow to get going.",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,2809,"['have', 'idea', 'how', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', 'have', 'interesting', 'take', 'old', 'legends.The', 'level', 'detail', 'was', 'interesting', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either-', 'just', 'took', 'upwards', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'going.If', 'movie', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'were', 'people', 'called', 'Sarmatians', 'look', 'recruitment', 'scenes', 'drafting', 'use', 'term', 'Rus', 'made', 'think', 'what', 'today', 'Russia', 'quite', 'change', 'usual', 'idea', 'being', 'what', 'now', 'Britain.I', 'noticed', 'several', 'men', 'wearing', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'buzz', 'haircut', 'kind', 'long', 'stubblecut-', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'accurate', 'given', 'haircutting', ""'d"", 'have', 'had.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'Arthur', 'men', 'have', 'fulfilled', 'enlistment', 'agreement', 'day', 'were', 'due', 'go', 'free', 'get', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'are', 'sent', 'north', 'Hadrians', 'Wall', 'impressive', 'set', 'rescue', 'Roman', 'family', 'advancing', 'enemy', 'think', 'was', 'Woads-', 'Celtic', 'Britons', 'not', 'Saxons', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'invading', 'Britian', 'Arthur', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'family', 'do', 'duty', 'bring', 'south', 'worker', 'families', 'captive', 'Woads', 'Guinevere', 'one', 'Arthur', 'freed.Back', 'base', 'Arthur', 'remain', 'Britain', 'due', 'disgust', 'what', 'Rome', 'become', 'depiction', 'supposedly', 'Christian', 'Romans', 'may', 'offend', 'actions', 'shown', 'are', 'similar', 'what', 'early', 'types', 'really', 'did', 'do', 'Having', 'already', 'defeated', 'advancing', 'Saxons', 'one', 'battle', 'run', 'south', 'Arthur', 'Woad', 'people', 'get', 'ready', 'battle', 'time', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Arthur', 'men', 'return', 'time', 'help', 'out', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'going-', 'something', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'big', 'battle', 'look', 'DVD', 'extra', 'stuff', 'Arthur', 'course', 'victorious.I', 'liked', 'look', 'sets', 'most', 'costuming', 'battles', 'looked', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'liked', 'way', 'many', 'details', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'were', 'worked', 'plot', 'just', 'differently', 'enough', 'be', 'something', 'believably', 'gradually', 'changed', 'time', '.I', 'found', 'hard', 'accept', 'Arthur', 'men', 'did', 'not', 'wear', 'anything', 'heads', 'big', 'battle', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'fought', 'how', 'cold', 'was', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'camping', 'out', 'freezing', 'woods', 'real', 'weather', 'protection', 'Woad', 'women', 'going', 'battle', 'problem', 'tops', 'wore', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'gone', 'battle', 'bare', 'chested', '-men', 'women.I', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'swearing', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'blood', 'flying', 'body', 'parts', 'was', 'help', 'rating', 'film', 'budget', '.The', 'movie', 'right', 'just', 'slow', 'going', 'may', 'skip', 'most', 'first', 'next', 'time', 'watch']",King Arthur

851347,A2ELNJI3RSGP6D,B0002YLCFQ,A Common Man,"[10, 21]","Unlike previous King Arthur movies this version attempts to uncover the historical Arthur. The most widely known stories about King Arthur were written over seven hundred years after the death of the historical Arthur. Many legends had sprung up regarding King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The stories were written to depict the ideals of the times. Europe had been in the so-called Dark Ages and now at the dawn of the Renascence writers used the existing legends as a base for creating tales that illustrated the newly embraced concept of chivalry. Previous movies were based on these chivalrous tales instead of historical research.In this movie King Arthur is a Roman. Although there are various theories and the actual history will never be known conclusively, recent research suggests that King Arthur was a Roman nobleman in a position of power in the Roman province of Britannia, now modern England. When the Roman Empire was crumbling in the fifth century AD, Arthur was forced to defend Britannia from Saxon invasions.This movie also traces the origin of the knights. The Roman army used mercenaries from around the empire. The Sarmatian mercenaries of the movie might have been the actual knights that were employed by Arthur. Other research suggests that they might have been from Scythia which bordered Sarmatia.The movie ""King Arthur"", written by D.H. Franzoni, is based on the historical Arthur and this is a refreshing approach. However where the movie completely fails is in the depiction of the culture and society of the times. The characters are mercilessly vulgarized for no apparent reason. It adds nothing to the story or to the dimension of the characters.An example of this demeaning vulgarization is Sir Bors discussing his huge penis size. He claims that he ""can't piss straight. I could never piss straight. Too much of myself to handle down there."" His fellow knights describe his penis as ""A baby's arm holdin' an apple"".Later Sir Bors talks about his ""bastards"" and that he only named one of his ""bastards"" because naming the rest ""was too much trouble, so we gave the rest of them numbers"".Sir Lancelot brags that he will commit adultery with Sir Gawain's wife and that he is also the father of one of the ""bastards"" of Sir Bors.D.H. Franzoni states, in an earlier Amazon.com review, that ""A great deal of research went into the preparation of this script, as much if not more than I spent on Gladiator"". I doubt that the sources of this vulgarization of the characters are historical documents.Later ages selected Sir Bors as one of the three knights that earned the right to find the Grail Castle based on his purity of heart. Although this is mythology, I can not see the point in now depicting Sir Bors as a penis egomaniac. The movie could have been an excellent historical drama without the vulgar portrayal of the characters involved. This review is a warning to viewers who find such dialogue, when used for no apparent reason, repulsive and without merit.",1,"Knights bragging of penis size, adultry, and vulgarizations.",1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,3010,"['previous', 'King', 'Arthur', 'movies', 'version', 'uncover', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'most', 'widely', 'known', 'stories', 'King', 'Arthur', 'were', 'written', 'over', 'seven', 'hundred', 'years', 'death', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'Many', 'legends', 'had', 'sprung', 'up', 'regarding', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'depict', 'ideals', 'times', 'Europe', 'had', 'been', 'so-called', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'now', 'dawn', 'Renascence', 'writers', 'used', 'existing', 'legends', 'base', 'creating', 'tales', 'illustrated', 'newly', 'embraced', 'concept', 'chivalry', 'Previous', 'movies', 'were', 'based', 'chivalrous', 'tales', 'instead', 'historical', 'research.In', 'movie', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Roman', 'are', 'various', 'theories', 'actual', 'history', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'conclusively', 'recent', 'research', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'Roman', 'nobleman', 'position', 'power', 'Roman', 'province', 'Britannia', 'now', 'modern', 'England', 'When', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'was', 'crumbling', 'fifth', 'century', 'AD', 'Arthur', 'was', 'forced', 'defend', 'Britannia', 'Saxon', 'invasions.This', 'movie', 'also', 'origin', 'knights', 'Roman', 'army', 'used', 'mercenaries', 'empire', 'Sarmatian', 'mercenaries', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'knights', 'were', 'employed', 'Arthur', 'Other', 'research', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Scythia', 'bordered', 'Sarmatia.The', 'movie', 'King', 'Arthur', 'written', 'D.H.', 'Franzoni', 'based', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'However', 'where', 'movie', 'completely', 'depiction', 'culture', 'society', 'times', 'characters', 'are', 'mercilessly', 'vulgarized', 'apparent', 'reason', 'nothing', 'story', 'dimension', 'characters.An', 'example', 'demeaning', 'vulgarization', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'discussing', 'huge', 'penis', 'size', 'ca', ""n't"", 'piss', 'straight', 'could', 'never', 'piss', 'straight', 'Too', 'much', 'handle', 'down', 'there', 'fellow', 'knights', 'describe', 'penis', 'A', 'baby', 'arm', 'holdin', 'apple', '.Later', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'talks', 'bastards', 'only', 'named', 'one', 'bastards', 'naming', 'rest', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'gave', 'rest', 'numbers', '.Sir', 'Lancelot', 'brags', 'will', 'commit', 'adultery', 'Sir', 'Gawain', 'wife', 'also', 'father', 'one', 'bastards', 'Sir', 'Bors.D.H', 'Franzoni', 'states', 'earlier', 'Amazon.com', 'review', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'research', 'went', 'preparation', 'script', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'spent', 'Gladiator', 'doubt', 'sources', 'vulgarization', 'characters', 'are', 'historical', 'documents.Later', 'ages', 'selected', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'one', 'three', 'knights', 'earned', 'right', 'find', 'Grail', 'Castle', 'based', 'purity', 'heart', 'mythology', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'point', 'now', 'depicting', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'penis', 'egomaniac', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'historical', 'drama', 'vulgar', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'involved', 'review', 'warning', 'viewers', 'who', 'find', 'such', 'dialogue', 'when', 'used', 'apparent', 'reason', 'repulsive', 'merit']",King Arthur

Now, I've never seen the the PG-13 version so I don't know if the violence was toned down (I expect it would have had to been less to get a PG-13), but the violence in this film is a bit much at times and with the blue-painted Celts it was like a British version of Braveheart.  At one point there is even a big speech reminiscent of Mel Gibson's freedom speech in Braveheart.  If Clive Owen had uttered ""For Freedom!"" I would not have been surprised.

851353,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0002YLCFQ,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[5, 5]","I'll start by saying I enjoyed this movie, a lot - and it's refreshing to see a new approach to the mythical story than simply rechurning old material as others have done. If you are a fan of the excellent ""Excalibur"" or have even read Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, then your first reaction to this movie will be ""What the ?"". That said, I have admiration for a director who dares tread unbroken ground in such a way, and tries to express that stories of old, handed down over the years were probably based on some kind of actual events initially, and this is the premise here. Clive Owen, is a little too workmanlike for my taste as the Revered Knight ""Arturious"" nee Arthur of the title, born to mixed parents, half English, Half Roman who has spent the last fifteen years of his adult life, roaming England, and fighting heathens in the name of the holy church of Rome. On the eve of his release from Religious servitude, he and his band of hardened knights are sent on a pseudo suicide mission North, to rescue a young boy who may become the next Holy Pope. During his journey, he is awakened to the corruption of the Church, a revelation that rocks the very foundation of all he has held dear all his life. He begins to see his own countrymen (formerly his enemies) as kindred spirits almost, and unites them ultimately to ward off a huge army of Saxon invaders. It's a nice idea, and a nice twist with some inventive back story along the way. Launcelot is here, Gawain, Galahad, Guinevere, and even Merlin as a mystic Celtic style witch doctor, all adding meat to the bones of the legend. The trouble is, the movie tries to encapsulate the legend of the mighty Arthur, and really only serves up a slice or two in an almost episodic retelling. The historical timing and influences of the Roman prescence in the England depicted are credible, and the battle scenes are graphic and impressive, but something always seems missing as you watch. My favorite character was the Saxon King Cerdic played with a battle weary but ruthless malevolence by Stellan Skarsgrd, who adds more than just balance to the whole picture, and will make you hiss every time he appears almost. Overall not bad, it's worth getting this unrated Directors cut however, as the additional footage makes for a better movie, and the alternate ending is the one that should have been used, instead of the schmaltzy Hollywood one shown. Very enjoyable movie that is almost believable in places, but one wonders if it would have been better as a stand alone story, instead of trying to be the Story behind the story of the legend of Arthur.",3,Too Many Loose Ends Untied - 3.5 Stars,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,2621,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'refreshing', 'see', 'new', 'approach', 'mythical', 'story', 'simply', 'rechurning', 'old', 'material', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'are', 'fan', 'excellent', 'Excalibur', 'have', 'even', 'read', 'Le', 'Morte', ""d'Arthur"", 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Mallory', 'then', 'first', 'reaction', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'What', 'said', 'have', 'admiration', 'director', 'who', 'tread', 'unbroken', 'ground', 'such', 'way', 'tries', 'express', 'stories', 'old', 'handed', 'down', 'years', 'were', 'probably', 'based', 'kind', 'actual', 'events', 'initially', 'premise', 'here', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'little', 'too', 'taste', 'Revered', 'Knight', 'Arturious', 'nee', 'Arthur', 'title', 'born', 'mixed', 'parents', 'half', 'English', 'Half', 'Roman', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'adult', 'life', 'roaming', 'England', 'fighting', 'heathens', 'name', 'holy', 'church', 'Rome', 'eve', 'release', 'Religious', 'servitude', 'band', 'hardened', 'knights', 'are', 'sent', 'pseudo', 'suicide', 'mission', 'North', 'rescue', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'may', 'become', 'next', 'Holy', 'Pope', 'journey', 'awakened', 'corruption', 'Church', 'revelation', 'very', 'foundation', 'held', 'dear', 'life', 'see', 'own', 'countrymen', 'formerly', 'enemies', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'almost', 'ultimately', 'ward', 'off', 'huge', 'army', 'Saxon', 'invaders', 'nice', 'idea', 'nice', 'twist', 'inventive', 'back', 'story', 'way', 'Launcelot', 'here', 'Gawain', 'Galahad', 'Guinevere', 'even', 'Merlin', 'mystic', 'Celtic', 'style', 'witch', 'doctor', 'adding', 'meat', 'bones', 'legend', 'trouble', 'movie', 'encapsulate', 'legend', 'mighty', 'Arthur', 'really', 'only', 'up', 'slice', 'two', 'almost', 'episodic', 'retelling', 'historical', 'timing', 'influences', 'Roman', 'prescence', 'England', 'depicted', 'are', 'credible', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'impressive', 'something', 'always', 'missing', 'watch', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Saxon', 'King', 'Cerdic', 'played', 'battle', 'weary', 'ruthless', 'malevolence', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'who', 'more', 'just', 'balance', 'whole', 'picture', 'will', 'make', 'hiss', 'time', 'almost', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'worth', 'getting', 'unrated', 'Directors', 'cut', 'however', 'additional', 'footage', 'better', 'movie', 'alternate', 'ending', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'instead', 'schmaltzy', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'shown', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'almost', 'believable', 'places', 'one', 'wonders', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'stand', 'alone', 'story', 'instead', 'trying', 'be', 'Story', 'story', 'legend', 'Arthur']",King Arthur

All that the best medieval scholars really know is that someone named Arturius led the Britons to victory against the Saxons at the battle of Baden Hill sometime around 450 A.D.  They have no way of knowing whether this person in fact bears any resemblance to the King Arthur of legend, or whether any of the other characters (Lancelot, Genevere, etc,) ever really existed.Marketing gimmics aside, this is quite an enjoyable movie.  The fight scenes were well choregraphed, and they're much better in the unrated version.  The performances were all very good, and the story kept me interested.  I may be mistaken, but I believe this is the first time the ancient Picts of Scottland were ever potrayed in a film.Another reson to see it is Keira Knightly.

The scene of the battle in the ice is certainly one of the most exciting scenes shown in movies during that year. As for the actors, most of them lack charisma in their roles, except for Keira Knightley as an improbable celtic warrior. Clive Owen, specially, is totally devoid of charisma in the lead role (though he has proven he is a fine actor in other movies). OK, now let's turn to history. This movie was promoted when it was released as the true historical portrait of King Arthur (someone who, most likely, never existed), so it's fair to question this aspect of the movie. According to this film, Arthur was a Roman general who, by the time of the withdrawal of the Roman troops from the British Isles in the 5th century, decided to join the Celtic locals against the Germanic invaders and eventually become their king. Well, where one can start? With Arthur's warriors shown as improbable proto Russians? With its anachronic portrayal of the Catholic Church, already more powerful than the Roman empire and engaging in the inquisition (an invention from the late middle ages)?. With its laughable references to historical figures like Bishop Germanius and the heretic writer Pelagius?

This movie does a good job in portraying a ""possible"" Arthurian take, but as with anything that takes a favorite story and changes it, will be met by mix reviews.For one thing, this movie takes out the fantasy aspect of Arthur, such as obvious magic, and replaces it instead with mysticism inherent in cultures at that time.  For one thing, Merlin is not really a magician (or at least we are not shown) but they do add the rumor that he is; of course, in those medieval times, legends about magic tended to be believed to exist.  They also took out the magic behind Excalibur.  Playing a particular large role in Arthurian legends, the sword takes an almost non-existent role; the only time the sword is even mentioned is once, but it's obvious they made it be just your average sword, that happened to be named by Arturius as excalibur.The famous Gwyenevere(sp?)and Lancelot betrayal of Arthur is pretty much nipped in the butt since Lancelot dies.  Although, the movie did make it obvious that Lancelot fancied Gwyenevere (maybe it's in the extended cut?).I do approve of the way they portrayed Gwyenevere, mainly because the Celts, I believe, had women warriors and it makes sense that a small rebel force figthing against a greater force (Rome) would have to recruit women to fight as well.Arthur himself is portrayed somewhat well, by actor Clive Owen. He makes the character's moral sets believable, mainly due to the idea that he was taught by a Roman philosopher that believed every man was created equal.Lancelot, the character, was ok.  He wasn't really anything close to the what the Arthurian legends say he was.  There was no indication he was ""the best"" of Arthur's knights.  In the stories, if I remember correctly, he was also from France; this is completely changed, since they make him be a Samatiann(sp?).Overall, this is a good movie.  Worth watching if you want to be entertained for 125 minutes.  If you are an Arthurian purist, I'm not sure if you will like it, but I do suggest you give it a try.Currently, I placed this movie as the second best Arthurian legend derived movie.

This is the best the film has ever looked but it does not stand out. I was shocked considering Disney usually produces the finest products. Understand that the film's color tones are yellow and blue which is an obvious choice by the director. It clearly looks sharpened up on Blu-Ray but it isn't a demo disc. Nothing stands out.

Right from the beginning, anachronisms and neopagan fantasies pervade the film.  The writers pick and choose which aspects of the Arthurian legends fit their particular bigoted view of history.  This is all well and good for a fantasy, but the creators of ""King Arthur"" are clearly pushing the idea that their version is accurate.The work is overtly derivative of Braveheart - Arthur & his Knights use the word ""Freedom"" like they were speechwriters for George Bush.  But the movie lacks Braveheart's appeal of being an interesting story, well acted, and hyperbolic from a basis in reality.It was fascinating to see the bigotry of the authors displayed through their absurd, hamhanded and unrelenting attacks on Christianity.  They extrapolate an enlightenment-era secular sensibility back onto the Sarmatian barbarians, and then feel that it's necessary to paint post-Constantinian Christianity as equivilent to the Inquisition.For all the writers' handwaving about correcting the Arthurian legend back from a Christianized medieval fiction, their ""improvement"" is an Arthur who would be much more plausible in 1990's San Francisco.But the above statements are just minor observations.  The real problem with the movie is that it is simply goofy.

851362,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0002YLCFQ,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[7, 11]","This movie was yet another retelling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  It had an unusual angle to the familiar story, and a lot of potential that I believe it just didn't live up to.  But wait, isn't this a kind of foolproof, proven winner?  Well...What I liked:it was a grittier, more historically plausible interpretation of the King Arthur legend than anything filmed before.  The chaos of the battle scenes was nicely done.  There was nothing mystical or magical mixed up in there.  The main characters were very flawed humans with their own stories:  Merlin was a prominent leader, perhaps a Druid, but not a wizard; Arthur was a conflicted half-British, half-Roman noble who learned egalitarian values and cared deeply for his pagan comrades; and all the knights of the Round Table were foreign men eager to leave the service of the Roman Empire once their 15 year tour of duty was up.  I was able to appreciate the care that went into researching the likely historical setup for the tale of these renowned ""heroes"".What I disliked:First, there were logistical flaws like wimpy people pulling bows that had 120 lb draw weights, weapons from inconsistent historical periods and countries, the overly done ""tough Amazon warrior princess"" typing done with Guinevere (it was laughably implausible).  That's enough to bother some people, but I can get over that sort of thing if the rest of a movie is pulled off well.Sadly, King Arthur wasn't pulled off that well overall, and I think it was a problem with the basic story being a bit underwhelming.  The biggest (meaning, what took up most of the screenplay) task that these men faced involved not the fate of the nation nor the defeat of great evil, but protecting a small village from a band of marauding Saxons.  I just had a hard time caring.  You know a film is in trouble when the director has to rely so heavily on the music to convince the audience that there's deep emotion to a scene.  Yes, that score was swelling heavily and often, but somehow, I just didn't connect on the visceral level with the dilemmas of Arthur and his knights, or the plight of the oppressed common folk that they were shepherding to Hadrian's Wall. The Arthur/Guinivere/Lancelot romance was halfhearted.  Even the ""sad"" parts involving deaths of good guys didn't grab me, and I normally choke up.  I kept wondering, what's missing -- why can't I lose myself in this story?So this is a valuable lesson to all future filmmakers that may wish to tackle this subject.

The only trouble with taking the magic and myth out of these stories is the magic and myth is what makes them so appealing! However, KING ARTHUR does a much better ""real"" portrayal than TROY ever did.A good way to put the film KING ARTHUR in perspective is with another period film, GLADIATOR. Many people are familiar with this epic film and the stunning opening scene where the Roman army, led by Russel Crowe, wages war on Germanic tribes. Fiery arrows fly. Mud soaked savages battle Roman legions. Well, KING ARTHUR is an entire movie of that; it's a movie of that opening scene from GLADIATOR. But with hot chicks.Now, this isn't a slight at KING ARTHUR at all. That opening scene of GLADIATOR was truly great. However, KING ARTHUR tries to be truly great, but falls a bit short. For one there are no ""big stars"" like Russel Crowe in KING ARTHUR. Lancelot and Arthur are unknowns and these key rolls lack that extra umph better known actors could have brought to such well known characters. In fact, as any one who has seen the movie posters already knows, the only ""star"" in the movie is Guinevere, played by up-and-coming ingenue Kiera Knightley.Knightley steals the movie as Guinevere. In fact, you think KING ARTHUR's uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer probably would've changed the name of the movie to GUINEVERE if he could have.Bottom line is KING ARTHUR is a pretty good period action movie. It's an interesting interpretation of who King Arthur might've ""really"" been. But lackluster casting, no real character development, and straying from what makes the Arthurian legends, well, legend, keep KING ARTHUR from being a great movie like Braveheart or Gladiator.

851366,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0002YLCFQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 4]","I wince whenever I see a film described as a ""TRUE"" story, especially when it involves the existence of 'King Arthur' and his knights, over 1500 years ago. While there are a wealth of theories that 'Arthur' was, as the film implies, a Roman military commander who remained after the legions departed, equally 'valid' claims can be made that he was a Welsh, Scot, or Briton chieftain, a Celtic warlord, or, most likely, an amalgamation of several powerful early warrior/generals, combined by French troubadours of the 11th - 13th centuries into a single 'King of England' to promote the concept of Chivalry, and thus link together a collection of popular heroic ballads. As the characters of Guinevere, Lancelot, and a majority of the famed knights and deeds of Arturian folklore were inventions of this later period, the only 'fact' that can be proved is that Britain, after the Romans departed, was a bloody battleground between Britons and the swarming Saxons, as well as Vikings, Picts, and other tribes from the north and across the English Channel.Within this 'battleground' concept, ""King Arthur"" still might have worked...except that the director insisted on using the 'classic' names for the story's characters, with Guinevere portrayed as a Celtic girl with a habit of fighting nearly naked, Merlin as a Celt chieftain with engineering talents equal to the Romans, and Lancelot, Tristan, Gawain, Galahad, and the other 'Knights of the Round Table' portrayed as Eastern European 'indentured soldiers' of Rome. With the possible exceptions of long-time folk heroes Merlin and Tristan (whose legendary doomed love of Isolde was, likely, an inspiration for the tragedy of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot), not even the NAMES were in common usage prior the the eleventh century!Dropping the 'Names' and 'Is it True, or is it Bruckheimer?' complaints, there are some good points to the film; Ireland, substituting for England, has a raw beauty in keeping with the time period; Stellan Skarsgrd (complete with an American accent!) plays the Saxon 'king' with a bloodthirstyyet stoic quality that certainly captures your attention; the battle scenes (in the Director's Cut) are brutal and believable; and the conflict on the ice (with a resolution familiar to anyone who has seen the Russian classic, ""Aleksandr Nevsky"") provides a tension often lacking through much of the rest of the film.As for the leads...Clive Owen makes a strong, sincere Arthur (although, by the sixth century, even the Romans had taken up wearing beards; being beardless was seen, mostly, in clerics); Ioan Gruffudd, as Lancelot, does his best with a role that begins promisingly, as a 'Devil's Advocate' advisor to Arthur, then fades into little more than a series of complaints and knowing 'looks' (without the legendary dalliance with the Queen, I guess the writers ran out of ideas); Keira Knightley (Guinevere), at 18, is developing into quite an actress, showing great enthusiasm in action sequences, and great promise in her romantic scenes with Owen. Ultimately, Ray Winstone, as the surly but likable Sir Bors, steals the film, providing most of the humor, and spirit, on screen.I know that many will find my criticism of ""King Arthur"" far too picky, but if you love a medieval battlefield epic, ""Braveheart"" is still the movie to see...and if you love Chivalry, and the King Arthur of lore, buy ""Excalibur"", and cherish the legends!Sadly, ""King Arthur"" is a pale shadow of both!",3,Much Ado About Nothing...,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,3464,"['wince', 'whenever', 'see', 'film', 'described', 'TRUE', 'story', 'especially', 'when', 'existence', ""'King"", 'Arthur', 'knights', '1500', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'wealth', 'theories', ""'Arthur"", 'was', 'film', 'implies', 'Roman', 'military', 'commander', 'who', 'remained', 'legions', 'departed', 'equally', 'claims', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'Welsh', 'Scot', 'Briton', 'chieftain', 'Celtic', 'warlord', 'most', 'likely', 'amalgamation', 'several', 'powerful', 'early', 'warrior/generals', 'combined', 'French', 'troubadours', '11th', '13th', 'centuries', 'single', ""'King"", 'England', 'promote', 'concept', 'Chivalry', 'thus', 'link', 'together', 'collection', 'popular', 'heroic', 'ballads', 'characters', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'majority', 'famed', 'knights', 'deeds', 'Arturian', 'folklore', 'were', 'inventions', 'later', 'period', 'only', ""'fact"", 'can', 'be', 'proved', 'Britain', 'Romans', 'departed', 'was', 'bloody', 'battleground', 'Britons', 'swarming', 'Saxons', 'as', 'well', 'Vikings', 'Picts', 'other', 'tribes', 'north', 'English', 'Channel.Within', ""'battleground"", 'concept', 'King', 'Arthur', 'still', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'director', 'insisted', 'using', ""'classic"", 'names', 'story', 'characters', 'Guinevere', 'portrayed', 'Celtic', 'girl', 'habit', 'fighting', 'nearly', 'naked', 'Merlin', 'Celt', 'chieftain', 'engineering', 'talents', 'equal', 'Romans', 'Lancelot', 'Tristan', 'Gawain', 'Galahad', 'other', ""'Knights"", 'Round', 'Table', 'portrayed', 'Eastern', 'European', ""'indentured"", 'soldiers', 'Rome', 'possible', 'exceptions', 'long-time', 'folk', 'heroes', 'Merlin', 'Tristan', 'legendary', 'doomed', 'love', 'Isolde', 'was', 'likely', 'inspiration', 'tragedy', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'not', 'even', 'NAMES', 'were', 'common', 'usage', 'prior', 'eleventh', 'century', 'Dropping', ""'Names"", ""'Is"", 'True', 'Bruckheimer', 'complaints', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'Ireland', 'substituting', 'England', 'raw', 'beauty', 'keeping', 'time', 'period', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'complete', 'American', 'accent', 'Saxon', ""'king"", 'bloodthirstyyet', 'stoic', 'quality', 'certainly', 'attention', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Cut', 'are', 'brutal', 'believable', 'conflict', 'ice', 'resolution', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Russian', 'classic', 'Aleksandr', 'Nevsky', 'tension', 'often', 'lacking', 'much', 'rest', 'film.As', 'leads', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'strong', 'sincere', 'Arthur', 'sixth', 'century', 'even', 'Romans', 'had', 'taken', 'up', 'wearing', 'beards', 'being', 'beardless', 'was', 'seen', 'mostly', 'clerics', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Lancelot', 'best', 'role', 'promisingly', ""'Devil"", 'Advocate', 'advisor', 'Arthur', 'then', 'little', 'more', 'series', 'complaints', 'knowing', ""'looks"", 'legendary', 'dalliance', 'Queen', 'guess', 'writers', 'ran', 'ideas', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Guinevere', '18', 'developing', 'actress', 'showing', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'promise', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Owen', 'Ultimately', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'surly', 'likable', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'film', 'providing', 'most', 'humor', 'spirit', 'screen.I', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'criticism', 'King', 'Arthur', 'far', 'too', 'picky', 'love', 'medieval', 'battlefield', 'epic', 'Braveheart', 'still', 'movie', 'see', 'love', 'Chivalry', 'King', 'Arthur', 'lore', 'buy', 'Excalibur', 'cherish', 'legends', 'Sadly', 'King', 'Arthur', 'pale', 'shadow']",King Arthur

When I saw the trailer to this movie, I had high expectations, and maybe that was my problem.The idea of protraying the historic root of the King Arthur legend was a grand idea to make a move about - how many other late Roman Empire movies have we seen set in Britain? Not many that I can think of. However, this movie simply did not deliver.For one thing, character development was seriously lacking. Arthur, his knights, and gweneviere's characters are not deep enough. We see hints of things that could have been developed further - lancelot's ""slavery"" into the army, arthur's divided loyalties, the motivation behind the barbaric British tribe against the Celts, but none of this is fully explored. This is the depth this movie needed.The actions scenes are okay - but the PG-13 rating hurt this film. Much of the ""realism"" we saw in gladiator, which really adds the extra spice, was edited. In this case, that extra spice may have helped this painfully scripted movie.The middle half hour or so was also very slow and the movie dragged.Finally, the ending was simply rushed, but by this time, the movie was so fragmented and confusing that it hardly mattered.I thought the acting was good, but it just seemed too much like a hashed out Disney movie with no depth nor plot.

Forget everything you've ever heard about Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, as this is a completely different story.  Half-Roman, half-British Arturius, or Arthur, leads a band of young men who have been promised by their fathers to serve the Roman empire for 15 years.  On what was to be the last day of their servitude, a Roman bishop sends them on one final, possibly doomed quest to rescue the pope's favorite Godson while holding back an entire army of Saxons.  Will the ""knights"" continue to stand with Arthur?  Will they prevail?As Arthur, Clive Owen is morose and distant, failing to crack a smile the entire movie.  The most famous knight, Lancelot, is vaguely spotlighted at times, but overall, his role is minimal.  In fact, although most of the actors give decent performances--most notably Stellan Skarsgrd as the villainous leader of the Saxons--this movie is about neither the characters nor the plot.  No, the main feature of the film is the gruesome, bloody battle scenes.  Courtesy of the ""director's cut,"" the battles are replete with beheadings, amputations, and plenty of blood flying.  Although at times reminiscent of Braveheart, these scenes unfortunately seem to go on forever, with a level of violence that feels complete unnecessary.  Only in two instances--a unique battle waged on ice mid-movie and the early moments of the final conflict between the British and the Saxons at the very end--are the fight scenes more subtle and effective.Fans of the traditional Arthur legend, beware:  this is not the movie for you.

This grittier, nastier, supposedly ""more real"" King Arthur is the one presented in this film.  And no amount of good acting, special effects and exciting battles can make up for that difference.  Your enjoyment of this film will greatly depend on which version of the classic story excites you most.Regardless, there is much to be appreciated here.  There is a very exciting action sequence on a frozen river in the mountains where you can practically feel the cold and tension.  Numerous shots stand out and draw you into the word the filmmakers have created.  The amount of detail in costumes and sets is quite stunning.  But what the film really needs are characters that we can care about.  I always felt an arms distance from everyone in this film.  Rarely did I care what happened to anyone.  I place blame on the script more than the actors who all turn in very strong performances with what they are given to work with.  Clive Owen in particular makes Arhtur a very believable anti-hero.This Director's Cut adds about 13 minutes to the theatrical version.  I'm assuming all the added scenes are battle scenes since the battles do tend to go on and on.  Watching the battle scenes was exciting at first and then I just got worn out by them.  I found myself thinking of The Lord of the Rings films and how engaging those battles were.  King Arthur tries very hard to hit the same highs but it falls short.While there is some great work on display here it comes off feeling hollow.

That produces an overload of expectations. The real subject of the film would seem to be the conflicts present in late Roman Britain. The movie would seem to cover these with a considerable amount of detail. Adding the Arthur legend names does not contribute to our understanding or enjoyment of the film.

851382,A282A0P69UT137,B0002YLCFQ,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[8, 13]","I really loved this film on so many levels.  First, I for one am glad that the filmmakers decided to get past most of the romanticized chivalry related crap that has been tacked onto Arthurian legend over the centuries, in order to get to the roots of the story of Arthur (well, mostly).  For those who found this confusing, its probably because they are used to the glittery, knightly, courtly stuff they see in most Arthurian related films like First Knight, Excalibur, etc.  But scholars who study Arthur in order to find who the real man might have been would say that most of that was added on by later bards and storytellers to bring Arthur to more relevance in their own time.  Now, granted, the filmmakers who made this movie do the same thing.  King Arthur does try to appeal to modern audiences with wisecracking heroes and Braveheart like action.But at the center of the film is the core story of who Arthur probably was.  Most Arthurian scholars now believe that King Arthur was a Roman general, possibly of Britanic heritage, who commanded forces in Roman Britain around the time of the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.  When the Romans began to pull out of Britain to defend their own home city from Barbarian invasions, the Saxons (a group from another part of Europe) invaded.  Arthur and those forces who remained loyal to him joined forces with the Britons to drive off the Saxon invasion.  Arthur became King, and a time of peace and prosperity came to Britain.  That's the core story.Now, what about the round table and Camelot and Lancelot and Guinevere?  Most scholars think most of these characters were added by later storytellers, along with Merlin the wizard and Excalibur and the mists of avalon.  Its like telling a fish story.  The fish gets bigger and bigger every time you tell the tale.What is so brilliant about this film is that it correctly places Arthur in terms of time and place, but at the same time preserves some of the characters and situations of later Athurian myth in such a way that it makes a nice mesh of historical facts (as far as can be determined) and folklore.  This creates a wonderful texture of a time and place in our distant past, and one that is filled with fictional characters that are very interesting and exciting.  The fictional characters themselves are created in such a way that they also belong in that time and place.  Arthur's knights in the film, for example, are Samanian warriors from another part of Europe conquered by the Romans.  They were drafted into the Roman Army for a certain term of service in Rome's provinicial forces, in this case their Britain garrison.  This conscription really did occur in the later Roman imperial period.

The acting was a real strong point of this movie and no ones lines were over dramatic or made you say 'give me a break.'The battle scenes and environments in the movie were great too. The snow scenes were especially beautiful and well shot.But there were a few things that made this a 4, and not a 5 star movie. The first was that this movie tried to be a serious epic like Lord of the Rings or Gladiator and it was not. King Arthur was much more of a popcorn Hollywood flick and it seemed to take itself a little too seriously at some points.Another thing was the music. The score was great but it seemed like the same song was played over and over throughout. It got annoying after a while.And whats with the weather? Most people, including the females, were walking around in short sleeves in the snow than the next scene had more appropriate furs on. Then the next day would be sunny and green and everyone would be back to short sleeves.

The art direction, costumes, scenery, and photography are top of the line but the plot is highly predicable and unbelievable. I found that Clive Owen and Ian Gruffudd did an excellent job of acting but the lines they had to say were so predictable and formulaic that I found myself feeling sorry for the actors having to make these overly emotive statements about abstractions that are barely relevant to the plot. I actually did not have as much of a problem with historical accuracy as many of the other reviewers since there was a period in which Christianized Romans gradually retreated from England, leaving the island to warring Angles, Saxons, Celts, and other native Brittan's. The concept that the Knights of the Round Table were Sarmatians integrated into the Roman army was also an interesting hypothesis. Most traditions have Lancelot as a native of Gaul or modern day France. The character of Guinevere seemed the most implausible. A Celtic woman warrior seemed to be the boldest interpretation so far of the character and position of Guinevere. The Knights of the Round Table, unfortunately, all got mixed together so that it was difficult to distinguish one from another. Merlin is a Celtic wise man and warrior in this interpretation rather than an established part of the court.

Antoine Fuqua has delivered it before, and I really do think hisTraining Dayis one of the best gritty cop movies out there. He got some good performances out of good actors in what was potentially a confusing plot.Too bad Fuqua hasn't made anything else of that caliber. I would even suggest King Arthur is his worst. At leastThe Replacement Killerswas fun, andTears of the Sun (Special Edition)was overwrought but intriguing. King Arthur has nothing going for it except some extended battle scenes that are quite well done.I admit that the overall idea is really cool. I like the reimagining of King Arthur that we see here, and I don't mind that Guinevere is a warrior maiden. But the acting here--from Clive Owen, of all people!--is simply atrocious. I have loved Clive Owen sinceCroupier, and most of his movies are decent, or at least he is decent in them. But King Arthur has some of the worst dialogue that even Owen couldn't save it.There are lots of other problems here, too (such as the fact that I didn't mind when Lancelot died), but I will leave the review with the simple statement that this is a bad movie with some good action.

851389,AB34G6VKP28L,B0002YLCFQ,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","King Arthur is definitely an action film.  An action film with a bit of romance, a smattering of comedy, and a whole lot of drama, yes, but an action film nonetheless. I wasn't quite expecting that, but came out liking it: from the moment the movie starts until the credit rolls, there is barely a break in the battle scenes or the intense moments where characters are running or fighting for their lives and their respective countries. Reminiscent of Braveheart in many ways, this film is worth the watch if only to consider the story of King Arthur from a new angle: with a realistic slant rather than as a mystical fairy tale legend.In the early Dark Ages, a band of Sarmatian knights led by half British, half Roman Lucius Artorius Castus or Arthur (Clive Owen) meet with Roman Bishop Germanius to receive their release papers after 15 years of forced service in the Roman army. They are (understandably) upset to discover that they must forego their freedom awhile longer: Rome has decided to pull out of defeating/defending the island, leaving the country and its natives vulnerable to an invasion by the Saxons. Arthur and his knights are sent on one last most dangerous of all suicide mission: to rescue a Roman family from the bloodthirsty Saxons by crossing through the perilous Woads territory (enemy natives led by mystical woodsman Merlin) and bringing them back to safety. Only when they succeed in this trial will Arthur and his knights be given their papers and allowed to return home as free men.The honorable Arthur must do a little convincing to get his knights to agree to this last most perilous mission: after all, this band of real men is weary of fighting and ready to return home. Soon his loyal yet rough-and-tumble knights agree, and Arthur and his band (including Lancelot played by Ioan Gruffud and Galahad played by Hugh Dancy) begin their perilous journey across Britain. Along the way they encounter Merlin and his crew, who for some unknown reason let them live and pass through the haunted forest alive. After rescuing the Roman family (along with some natives in dire need), Arthur and his knights are forced to turn and fight the Saxons (who outnumber them by the handful!).They are helped by a native warrior woman Guinevere (Kiera Knightley), who ends up forcing a confrontation between Merlin and Arthur. Arthur is finally faced with the choice to return to Rome or stay and fight for Britain alongside Merlin and the lovely Guinevere.The overall tone and feel of this film is dark, with lots of smoke and fog used in the battle scenes: although this film centers around battles and fight scenes, there is an underlying storyline that makes it entrancing and interesting.The knights are not larger-than-life heroes, chivalrous and pure legend not reality: they are real men. You cant help but cheer for Arthur and his knights as they fight against the odds to defeat the enemies of Britain and gain their own release: but when the time comes for this band of men to go home, will they go or will they stay?For me, the new setting for the King Arthur story and the realism made for a great story. Clive Owen did a phenomenal job as King Arthur and has gained respect in my eyes: Kiera Knightley was great, as always, as the Britain-warrior-woman Guinevere (although a completely different aspect of this legendary character, it never was so over the top as to annoy me), and Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Hugh Dancy as Galahad were wonderful as well: in fact, I think all the actors did a good job. If you like the story of King Arthur, you will like this: from the beginning to the end, you are taken on a real-life adventure with King Arthur and the knights of the round table.",4,a realistic take on the legend,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3716,"['King', 'Arthur', 'definitely', 'action', 'film', 'action', 'film', 'bit', 'romance', 'smattering', 'comedy', 'whole', 'lot', 'drama', 'yes', 'action', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'expecting', 'came', 'out', 'liking', 'moment', 'movie', 'credit', 'rolls', 'barely', 'break', 'battle', 'intense', 'moments', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'running', 'fighting', 'lives', 'respective', 'countries', 'Reminiscent', 'Braveheart', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'watch', 'only', 'consider', 'story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'new', 'angle', 'realistic', 'slant', 'rather', 'mystical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'legend.In', 'early', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'band', 'Sarmatian', 'knights', 'led', 'British', 'half', 'Roman', 'Lucius', 'Artorius', 'Castus', 'Arthur', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'meet', 'Roman', 'Bishop', 'Germanius', 'receive', 'release', 'papers', '15', 'years', 'forced', 'service', 'Roman', 'army', 'are', 'understandably', 'upset', 'discover', 'must', 'forego', 'freedom', 'longer', 'Rome', 'decided', 'pull', 'defeating/defending', 'island', 'leaving', 'country', 'natives', 'vulnerable', 'invasion', 'Saxons', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'are', 'sent', 'one', 'last', 'most', 'dangerous', 'suicide', 'mission', 'rescue', 'Roman', 'family', 'bloodthirsty', 'Saxons', 'crossing', 'perilous', 'Woads', 'territory', 'enemy', 'natives', 'led', 'mystical', 'woodsman', 'Merlin', 'bringing', 'back', 'safety', 'Only', 'when', 'succeed', 'trial', 'will', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'be', 'given', 'papers', 'allowed', 'return', 'home', 'free', 'men.The', 'honorable', 'Arthur', 'must', 'do', 'little', 'convincing', 'get', 'knights', 'agree', 'last', 'most', 'perilous', 'mission', 'band', 'real', 'men', 'weary', 'fighting', 'ready', 'return', 'home', 'Soon', 'loyal', 'yet', 'rough-and-tumble', 'knights', 'agree', 'Arthur', 'band', 'including', 'Lancelot', 'played', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud', 'Galahad', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'begin', 'perilous', 'journey', 'Britain', 'way', 'encounter', 'Merlin', 'crew', 'who', 'unknown', 'reason', 'let', 'live', 'pass', 'haunted', 'forest', 'alive', 'rescuing', 'Roman', 'family', 'natives', 'dire', 'need', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'are', 'forced', 'turn', 'fight', 'Saxons', 'who', 'outnumber', 'handful', '.They', 'are', 'helped', 'native', 'warrior', 'woman', 'Guinevere', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'who', 'up', 'forcing', 'confrontation', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'Arthur', 'finally', 'faced', 'choice', 'return', 'Rome', 'stay', 'fight', 'Britain', 'alongside', 'Merlin', 'lovely', 'Guinevere.The', 'overall', 'tone', 'feel', 'film', 'dark', 'lots', 'smoke', 'fog', 'used', 'battle', 'scenes', 'film', 'centers', 'battles', 'fight', 'scenes', 'underlying', 'storyline', 'entrancing', 'interesting.The', 'knights', 'are', 'not', 'larger-than-life', 'heroes', 'chivalrous', 'pure', 'legend', 'not', 'reality', 'are', 'real', 'men', 'cant', 'help', 'cheer', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'fight', 'odds', 'defeat', 'enemies', 'Britain', 'gain', 'own', 'release', 'when', 'time', 'band', 'men', 'go', 'home', 'will', 'go', 'will', 'stay', 'new', 'setting', 'King', 'Arthur', 'story', 'realism', 'made', 'great', 'story', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'King', 'Arthur', 'gained', 'respect', 'eyes', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'was', 'great', 'always', 'Britain-warrior-woman', 'Guinevere', 'completely', 'different', 'aspect', 'legendary', 'character', 'never', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'annoy', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud', 'Lancelot', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Galahad', 'were', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'like', 'story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'will', 'like', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'taken', 'real-life', 'adventure', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'round', 'table']",King Arthur

If you have a really good understanding of Arthurian history/conjecture, this movie has just enough to keep you going. If you are new to the genre, don't bother. The details will fly by and it just becomes a really long movie.Characters: Clive Owen as Artorius (Arthur) was pretty good in a role where he was stuck between a serious rock and a hard place. Guinevere played by Kiera Knightly was a character that begged for more detail and depth but never got it. The other members of the round table all kind of blended together and it takes some serious effort to tell them apart. The exception was Bors who was by far the best character in the movie.Cinematography: Editing was well done, especially since the huge battle scenes take so much angle cutting to make them believable. The scenery and setting was pretty well done except for the over-use of smoke and fog. I understand they were going for mood and ambience but it just got tiring after a while trying to peer through the smoke.This movie never reached its full potential, plain and simple.

851392,AU78WGAXA3IY1,B0002YLCFQ,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[1, 2]","Was it really King Arthur that fascinated so? His charisma, born from a purity and goodness of spirit seldom seen, and his loyalty to both friend and cause was admirable. But, perhaps, too perfect as to be unreasonable? In this adaptation of Arthur and his Knights, that is certainly so. Because you feel nothing for him and all for his Knights.It usually does not bode well for a film when the title character can't carry his role. Clive Owen seemed vaguely familiar to me in the trailers, but I couldn't place where I had ever seen him before. Knowing the legend since a very young age and growing up with an ideal of Arthur, I must say that Owen did not fulfill any of my criteria for the great King. The charisma mentioned above was lacking. I was struck by the frequency with which Owen displayed a blank face. He was being told that his Knights, men who had fought for a nation in which they did not believe for 15 long years, would not earn their freedom until they risked one further impossible mission, and he sat there, staring off into space. It was like he was rather dull or, I hate to say it, dumb. There was no spark. Not even when Guinevere, her dress slipping from her shoulder, offered herself to him. King Arthur was an emotional being, but there was very little in Owen's bearing to show that. The most compelling characters for me were Lancelot and Tristan. I was thrilled to see Ioan Gruffud's name brought up when this project was filming and I was even happier to note that he had been given a central role. Wonderfully expressive, Gruffud's Lancelot brought the emotion and depth in his character to the fore. And the charisma that was lacking in Arthur was evident in the quiet Tristan who, from the moment he steps down from his horse in the first of the battles, catches your attention.Perhaps what got under my skin the most was that those responsible for the film and script took it for granted that you would know the legend and therefore not care about what they no doubt considered exposition. Snippets of Arthur's history are woven into the narrative and shown briefly in flashback. It's a far more realistic take on his origin and, though appreciated, it isn't nearly enough. And what's worse, we are to understand the strength and breadth of the friendship and brotherhood that was forged between the Knights on face value alone. How awful. A bond such as theirs deserves so much more. I am fully aware of the legend, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to see it, that it isn't just as moving the hundredth time it's told or shown. Every time Arthur said to Lancelot, ""You who knows me best,"" I couldn't help but sigh in frustration. The audience could barely get to know any of them on any kind of level, so how could we buy that they knew each other so well? Aside from the humor shared between the men, where was the evidence? It really gyps someone who isn't as knowledgeable and who wasn't raised on the story. Another very minor complaint I had was in regards to the presentation of history. If someone, like my companion, didn't have a fairly solid grip on history or a sense of place as it was years upon years ago, the Saxons, Romans and Merlin's men may start to blur together. By no means do they need to hold the audience's hand, and, to a point, they deserve some credit for not believing us stupid, but still. There were a lot of younger viewers there and it would have been nice to put a bit more history in with the battle. (And battles abounded. They took up nearly all of the movie. In fact, they seemed to favor action over historical politics and the subtleties of human interaction and emotion.)I suppose after all that it would seem as though I didn't enjoy the movie. But that's far from the truth. Though I am sure that I could have felt much more involved in the story if other elements had been involved, the time passed by quickly and I left smiling. I would recommend it, but tack on an advisement: Don't expect too much, especially if you're a fan of the legend in any form.",4,Enjoyable if emotionless,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,4044,"['really', 'King', 'Arthur', 'fascinated', 'so', 'charisma', 'born', 'purity', 'goodness', 'spirit', 'seldom', 'seen', 'loyalty', 'friend', 'cause', 'was', 'admirable', 'perhaps', 'too', 'perfect', 'be', 'unreasonable', 'adaptation', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'certainly', 'so', 'feel', 'nothing', 'Knights.It', 'usually', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'film', 'when', 'title', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'role', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'seemed', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'trailers', 'could', ""n't"", 'place', 'where', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Knowing', 'legend', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'growing', 'up', 'ideal', 'Arthur', 'must', 'say', 'Owen', 'did', 'not', 'fulfill', 'criteria', 'great', 'King', 'charisma', 'mentioned', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'struck', 'frequency', 'Owen', 'displayed', 'blank', 'face', 'was', 'being', 'told', 'Knights', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'nation', 'did', 'not', 'believe', '15', 'long', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'earn', 'freedom', 'risked', 'one', 'further', 'impossible', 'mission', 'sat', 'there', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'was', 'was', 'rather', 'dull', 'hate', 'say', 'was', 'spark', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'Guinevere', 'dress', 'slipping', 'shoulder', 'offered', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'emotional', 'being', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'Owen', 'bearing', 'show', 'most', 'compelling', 'characters', 'were', 'Lancelot', 'Tristan', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud', 'name', 'brought', 'up', 'when', 'project', 'was', 'filming', 'was', 'even', 'happier', 'note', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'central', 'role', 'Wonderfully', 'expressive', 'Gruffud', 'Lancelot', 'brought', 'emotion', 'depth', 'character', 'fore', 'charisma', 'was', 'lacking', 'Arthur', 'was', 'evident', 'quiet', 'Tristan', 'who', 'moment', 'down', 'horse', 'first', 'battles', 'catches', 'attention.Perhaps', 'what', 'got', 'skin', 'most', 'was', 'responsible', 'film', 'script', 'took', 'granted', 'would', 'know', 'legend', 'therefore', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'doubt', 'considered', 'exposition', 'Snippets', 'Arthur', 'history', 'are', 'woven', 'narrative', 'shown', 'briefly', 'flashback', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'take', 'origin', 'though', 'appreciated', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'enough', 'what', 'worse', 'are', 'understand', 'strength', 'breadth', 'friendship', 'brotherhood', 'was', 'forged', 'Knights', 'face', 'value', 'alone', 'How', 'awful', 'bond', 'such', 'theirs', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'legend', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', ""n't"", 'just', 'moving', 'hundredth', 'time', 'told', 'shown', 'time', 'Arthur', 'said', 'Lancelot', 'who', 'best', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'sigh', 'frustration', 'audience', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'know', 'kind', 'level', 'how', 'could', 'buy', 'knew', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'Aside', 'humor', 'shared', 'men', 'where', 'was', 'evidence', 'really', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'knowledgeable', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'raised', 'story', 'very', 'minor', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'regards', 'presentation', 'history', 'someone', 'companion', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fairly', 'solid', 'grip', 'history', 'sense', 'place', 'was', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'Saxons', 'Romans', 'Merlin', 'men', 'may', 'start', 'blur', 'together', 'means', 'do', 'need', 'hold', 'audience', 'hand', 'point', 'deserve', 'credit', 'not', 'believing', 'stupid', 'still', 'were', 'lot', 'younger', 'viewers', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'put', 'bit', 'more', 'history', 'battle', 'abounded', 'took', 'up', 'nearly', 'movie', 'fact', 'seemed', 'favor', 'action', 'historical', 'politics', 'subtleties', 'human', 'interaction', 'emotion', 'suppose', 'would', 'seem', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'far', 'truth', 'am', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'story', 'other', 'elements', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'time', 'passed', 'quickly', 'left', 'smiling', 'would', 'recommend', 'tack', 'advisement', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'legend', 'form']",King Arthur

If you don't like the legend, name your characters something else and don't use the name of King Arthur to sell your movie. Another issue is the movie is rife with inaccuracies from historical facts to weaponry and armor to battle tactics. Is it too much to ask that they get something right? The third issue is the atrocious dialog you come to expect from a Bruckheimer production.Once I was able to let these things go and relax, I enjoyed the movie.

'King Arthur' is analogous in this respect because it is a liberal interpretation of a legend that is wildly popular around the world and has shaped the entire world culture in many ways, throughout the centuries until present day. As the saying goes, all myths are based on a grain of truth, so there's obviously something to it, but how accurate is the knowledge that we have, nobody can say for sure, but at least this version is more plausible than previous, fantastical versions. That aside, what matters is that movie is truly entertaining in more ways than one.The Romans were accurately portrayed and seemed rather decadent and conspiritorial as they were infamous for.As far as I could tell, judging by historial references, the Saxons were fairly represented. Their battle prowess was not in question, nor was their bravado. Without a doubt they were portrayed as being formidable foes, but obviously they were not going to succeed in defeating the ultra-talented knights of the round table and King Arthur himself.I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone, especially those who appreciate a great war film with some romance and comedy thrown in for good measure. It is definitely one of the better films I've seen, and what can I say, I'm a big fan of the period, not to mention the myth behind the legends.This film is a perfect example of how a film does not need world renowned film stars to be a quality product. Too many films are sold simply on the fame associated with a name, but in this case the outstanding professionalism that went into all aspects of the film production sells itself to audiences world wide. Kudos to Jerry Bruckheimer for having the guts to take a chance with a relatively unknown cast and forging ahead with a rather ambitious project that turned out to be surprisingly good, far more so than the mediocre 'Troy' and the abysmal 'Alexander'.The director's cut is definitely gory, but not gratuitously so.

851398,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0002YLCFQ,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 3]","You too can direct a big budget disaster based upon the myths. Of course, Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day, seems eager to show that the idea that a person can direct only what they know is true- he's a black American homeboy, and his grasp of the legends is not even slender- is true. In truth, the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are for more entertaining and grand than the d&eacute;class&eacute; tripe of The Lord Of The Rings saga, but you would not know it in this version. Instead of romance, intrigue, honor, and magic we get `realism'- or so the director spouts over and again in his film commentary, and in the assorted extras on the DVD. But, please note the ` ' that I used around the word realism. That's because there's not a hint of it in this disaster. First off, the blood and guts fighting is laughably unreal. Ever since Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in 1998, filmmakers have been trying to be `real' in their violence onscreen. This `realistic' movie, however, eschews that. Yet, the Knights curse and spit, especially a Cockney Sir Bors (Ray Winstone). They also are not British, nor even French. Instead, they are from Sarmatia- a region that never produced knights in the early 5th Century, when this film is set, nor were they ever at war with the Roman Empire, as claimed. In the tales, King Arthur and his Knights are devout Christians, and Rome is little seen. In the film, Arthur is a Roman Christian in service to the Pope, Lancelot is a heathen, and Merlin (Stephen Dillane) the head of a band of forest people called Wodes who, in this `realistic' film, never existed. In short, the film centers around Arthur's Knights' rescue of a would-be child church bishop north of Hadrian's Wall before the terrible Saxons sweep in from the North. Unfortunately, the Saxons never occupied northern Britain, they were defenders of the Isle from Scots, Picts, and Celts, and they were not marauding barbarians in the mold of the Vikings a half an eon later- all, again, in this `realistic' movie.Gwynevere (played by the lovelier than words Keira Knightley -or is it Natalie Portman with an accent?) is a wild warrior woman in the Xena mold- possibly a Wode, although this is never definitively made clear- which she and Fuqua claim is historically accurate, although it's not, but allows the brief notion that the glimpses of her taut, lithe, nacreous bod (and nacreous is a word destined to describe Ms. Knightley's skin) in skimpy leather, in winter- mind you, will soon give way to a great romantic love scene with Arthur (the petrified Clive Owen). But, alas, the one brief romantic scene is lame, Keira stays far too clothed, and Lancelot (Ioan Gruffydd) is a total pussy who seems utterly impotent in the face of Gwyn's charms.... Now, none of these failings would matter in the least were the tale a damned good one, but the only way this script could have been passable on celluloid were someone like a Roger Corman brought in to camp it up. But, humor and camp are totally absent in this hermetically dry waste of time. So, the claims of `realism' and historical accuracy' are the only thing this monstrosity had going for it- along with the anticipated delight of Keira Knightly in and out of leather, yet it fails miserably on both scores. And the editing is atrocious- with at least three major discontinuities in scenes where snow is seen on the ground, them mysteriously replaced by green grass a second later.

851402,A17VWXPA3ENXWC,B0002YLCFQ,cymraess,"[14, 28]","I truly love the King Arthur legends, and different takes on them do not really bother me...they're legends after all, they're supposed to be interpreted.  I've always pictured the Aurthur legends set in the dark ages (perhaps from reading Mary Stwart and The Mists of Avalon) and it seems more likely that if such a person as Arthur existed, it would have been then.  Loose interpretation of a myth, however, does not excuse this movie.Good heavans, where do I start?  The plot is jumbled, apparently the knights whose names, at least, are recognizable, come from Samaria and follow a half Briton named Arthur, whose status as a half-Briton seems to be added about two thirds of the way through the movie as an afterthought.  The film opens with a lot of reading about how this movie is historically accurate and them some voice overs and then some lovely shots of knights riding, one of the few things that is well done about this movie.  Apparently Arthur and his knights need to escort some Bishop to Hadrian's Wall (don't ask me why)who sends them on one last mision.  Of course, no one bothers to explain why this Roman aristocrat that they're sent to escort to safety is living beyond Hadrian's wall in so called Woad territory.Have I forgot to mention the Woads?  Apparently the woads are the British natives, lead by Merlin, a blond hippie with a dirty blue face who has about thirty seconds of screen time.  Every so often they attack good Arthur for no reason, and later try to guilt trip him into saving them from the Saxons who for some reason are invading from the North.  Along the way, we find out that Rome is corrupt, Christians suck, and that the Saxon leader played by Stellan Skarsgard is really having a good time whispering cheesy badguy lines like ""Burn everything...kill everybody.""Oh yeah, and Arthur finds Guinevere.  Why is it that whenever Hollywood wants to make a 'strong female character' they turn her into a man?  While Arthur is muttering his hollow, twentieth century Braveheart lines about 'freedom' Guinevere is berating him because her people (the Woads) need a leader and he who is half Briton himself fights against them.  The two have utterly no chemistry and for some reason they decided to utterly ditch the love triangle, one of the most important themes of the story...there's no possibility for it either, if you watch the movie you'll see why...but back to Guinevere...if her being an obnoxious shrew isn't enough, they have to turn her into a 'warrior' as well.  And give her some Hollywood feminist lines that wind up completaly out of tune with the supposedly period movie.  And don't even get me started on her final battle costume...my only question is...what would happen if she...well...popped out?I enjoyed the interactions between the knights, and unlike many, I did not find them particularly interchangable.  Arthur, however, was another matter.  He was dull, boring, and so completaly lacking charisma that it was simply impossible to understand why, exactly, everyone was so devoted to him.  I especially liked the scene where he hollored up at the sky to god...or the director...""Why?  It was supposed to be me!""  At which point one is thinking...""good heavans, I wish it were...""

First of all, King Arthur is apart of British history and we as American's should not be taking their legends, fables and myths as our own and distorting them so atrociously. The British don't take the Civil War or our great heros such as Washington as their own and make 'true' versions out of what happened.King Arthur, although having pretty cool landscapes is nothing more than a show of brutality and stupidity. The Roman's here are portrayed as being afraid of the Saxons when Rome at that time had one of the largest armies and was so bent on conquering the known world they didn't have time to be afraid. Face it, they wheren't even scared of Attila.While I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, there was just to much untrue representation going on that it was hard to truly enjoy it at its level. And whats up with Merlin? He's completely hard to believe as the infinitely filthy gang/rebel leader of some backwoods army. Would such a person ever recieve the name Merlin. Most likely not, its rather a noble name. Such as Guinevere (*sigh*) so much for daughter of a great king. Who did she belong to anyhow in the movie?On the whole, as one reviewer said, if they hadn't tried to use the names king Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin or Galahad it might have been more believable, and more enjoyable.How also did King Arthur get Excaliber? And if it wasn't such a magical sword given to him, then why was it so famous and named thus? Roman's didn't usually go around naming their swords for the heck of it. And what about the wall covering Britain from Italy? Who destroyed that so completely that it was never discovered until now? The Saxons? Angry at Arthur that they took it out on the wall? Please.One the whole this movie tried to introduce a new idea, but falls completely flat.

851407,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B0002YLCFQ,"Dan ""Longsword""","[3, 5]","There are a lot of reasons to dislike this film. Its obvious comparisons to the Mel Gibson epics ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"", the radical departure from mystical elements of the legend and the film's lack of the infamous subplot of sexual betrayal between Lancelot and Guinevere.But if you liked ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" possibly you can embrace this version of Arthur and see it in that context. I love the whole Arthur myth and its epic scale of story-telling which in a lot of ways bugged me when I watched this new version but when I was able to separate the two as different entities I began to see what the filmmakers were trying to make.What you get is a steadfast leading performance by the much under-rated British import Clive Owen as a struggling leader who in constant conflict between his moral code and what is right. He is a flawed leader and Owen is brilliant as this legendary but flawed man.I also really loved the performance from Ioan Gruffudd, who starred in those brilliant Horatio Hornblower films on A&E.; Gruffudd's Lancelot seems to be cocky and gallant on the outside but lost in the inside. It is a brilliant performance because we see a lot more in this man than the script allows.Arthur's supporting knights including Hugh Dancy of ""Ella Enchanted"" and Ray Winstone of ""Cold Mountain"" who each have their own moments in the film. Winstone's Bors is hilarious, tender and boisterous all in the same moment which makes him a fan favorite.Some of the problems I had with the film, without the obvious ones pertaining to the change in the subject matter, come from the performances of Keira Knightley and Stellan Skarsgard.Knightley's gung ho warrior princess works in certain situations but lacks in others. I never once for a moment believed in her connection with Arthur. In part you probably can partially blame the filmmakers since their love scene is pretty pathetic as love scenes go. I also found that her character lacked the necessary depth and fleshing out to be effective with all these other beautifully flawed performances. I won't even get into her warrior wardrobe.I was also disappointed with Skarsgard as Cerdic, the overtly hairy leader of the Saxons. I felt that he wasn't menacing enough or roguish enough to lead such a vast army. He almost came off as a clown. I felt that the portrayal of his son, Cynric (Til Schweiger) was more effective. You could tell that the filmmakers wanted the Saxon leader to be ruthless and sadistic but it never reached its blood-thirsty fruition.

851408,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B0002YLCFQ,Danno,"[2, 3]","""King Arthur"" is handsomely filmed, possesses an impressive pedigree, features a rousing soundtrack, is well worth your time - and yet failed at the US Box Office. I can think of two reasons why, both of which were out of the filmmakers' control. Neither of these reasons should prevent you from seeing ""King Arthur"" if you are the type who enjoys an old-fashioned costume spectacle geared to adults.First is timing, pure and simple. Director Antoine Fuqua has the misfortune of following in Peter Jackson's footsteps. Fuqua's no Jackson, and ""Arthur"" is no ""Lord of the Rings."" It isn't a substandard film by any means - but suffers by comparison to the Middle Earth classic. The second, related reason is the decision to make ""Arthur"" as historically plausible as it could be. I doubt that the American public is familiar enough with Arthurian legend to make such deconstruction necessary. For the record, I am far from familiar with the details of King Arthur's legends but I was surprised to see that many elements of the legend such as the Holy Grail, Morganna Le Fay, the Green Knight, and Merlin's role as Arthur's wizardly mentor were either absent or altered. This probably alienated much of ""Arthur""'s potential audience, who had seen and enjoyed ""Excalibur"" or ""Camelot."" It also probably drove away a younger audience hoping for tongue-in-cheek hijinks; when I saw the film in theaters, the audience was primarily over 40.The DVD restores some gore clipped from the theatrical release, a couple of minor character-driven scenes and - thankfully - a series of restrained extras. I find that most DVD releases tell me more than I want to know about the film I've just seen, and most are endlessly self-congratulatory. ""Arthur""'s extras seem just right to me, giving us a glimpse of behind-the-scenes action without wearing us out.As long as you don't approach this film expecting it to outdo the sweeping vistas of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you're likely to walk away both entertained and curious to learn more about who the real King Arthur might have been.",4,Deconstructing King Arthur,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,2087,"['King', 'Arthur', 'handsomely', 'filmed', 'impressive', 'pedigree', 'rousing', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'time', 'yet', 'failed', 'US', 'Box', 'Office', 'can', 'think', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'were', 'filmmakers', 'control', 'reasons', 'should', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'King', 'Arthur', 'are', 'type', 'who', 'old-fashioned', 'costume', 'spectacle', 'geared', 'adults.First', 'timing', 'pure', 'simple', 'Director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'misfortune', 'following', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'footsteps', 'Fuqua', 'Jackson', 'Arthur', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""n't"", 'substandard', 'film', 'means', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'classic', 'second', 'related', 'reason', 'decision', 'make', 'Arthur', 'historically', 'plausible', 'could', 'be', 'doubt', 'American', 'public', 'familiar', 'enough', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'make', 'such', 'deconstruction', 'necessary', 'record', 'am', 'far', 'familiar', 'details', 'King', 'Arthur', 'legends', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'many', 'elements', 'legend', 'such', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Morganna', 'Le', 'Fay', 'Green', 'Knight', 'Merlin', 'role', 'Arthur', 'wizardly', 'mentor', 'were', 'absent', 'altered', 'probably', 'alienated', 'much', 'Arthur', 'potential', 'audience', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'Excalibur', 'Camelot', 'also', 'probably', 'drove', 'away', 'younger', 'audience', 'hoping', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'hijinks', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'audience', 'was', 'primarily', '40.The', 'DVD', 'gore', 'clipped', 'theatrical', 'release', 'couple', 'minor', 'character-driven', 'scenes', 'thankfully', 'series', 'restrained', 'extras', 'find', 'most', 'DVD', 'tell', 'more', 'want', 'know', 'film', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'most', 'are', 'endlessly', 'self-congratulatory', 'Arthur', 'extras', 'seem', 'just', 'right', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'behind-the-scenes', 'action', 'wearing', 'out.As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'film', 'expecting', 'outdo', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', ""'re"", 'likely', 'walk', 'away', 'entertained', 'curious', 'learn', 'more', 'who', 'real', 'King', 'Arthur', 'might', 'have', 'been']",King Arthur

Having watched the extended directors cut last night I am kicking myself for not making it to the local multiplex to catch this grand scale epic on the big screen.I really cannot understand all the negative press this movie has received. Historical evidence (as presented in a quite excellent History channel documentary recently) proves that King Arthur was most likely a Roman general who did band together with the native Britons in fighting off the invading Saxons.The traditional story that Hollywood has brainwashed the movie-going public into believing is total drivel. Arthur was not a figure of the middle ages, he was not an Anglo-Saxon and there was no magical sword in the stone. For years I have felt disdain for the manner in which the English have claimed King Arthur as their own - here at last is a movie that goes some way to setting the record straight. One really should not forget that the warriors from Brittany who sailed with Norman the Conqueror sang and celebrated King Arthur as their hero, someone who had fought to protect the Britons from the invading Saxon hordes.Another criticism leveled at this movie is the presentation of Guinevere as a warrior woman. However this is also historically accurate as explained by actress Keira Knightley in both the ""Making of..."" documentary  and the roundtable discussion (included as part of this impressive DVD set). Women often were quite capable warriors and it was not until about five centuries later that they faded into historical obscurity. Was it not after all a Briton warrior queen who caused Rome so much concern in the earlier centuries of the first millennium?What we have here is a thoroughly entertaining, informative and dramatic recounting of the inspiration for the Arthur legend. Arthur himself is a half Briton, half Roman who takes command of a group of Samatian (sp?) cavalrymen guarding Hadrians Wall (historical evidence also points to this being an accurate account). With news of an invasion to the north by the Saxons Arthur and his men are sent to retrieve a Roman family and transport them back to safety. What follows is an epic struggle to survive and a growing awareness by Arthur as to his Briton heritage.I really enjoyed this movie and I also think the DVD is exceptionally well done. The highlight of the special features in my opinion is the roundtable discussion which includes the major actors as well as the writer, director and producer. They discuss the historical accuracy of the movie as well as the challenges in bringing it to the screen. There is also a (rather fluffy) making of documentary, an audio commentary and a (rather lame) trivia track. Overall though this movie is an impressive achievement.NOTE TO MR. GEORGE: Most of the evidence quoted comes from the aforementioned History Channel documentary on King Arthur as well as material covered in the DVD for which this is a review.  I am also at a loss to understand where your assertion that I have a disdain for the English comes from - since I am part English myself.",5,Setting the record straight - finally,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,3136,"['had', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'theater', 'last', 'summer', 'never', 'quite', 'made', 'Having', 'watched', 'extended', 'directors', 'cut', 'last', 'night', 'am', 'kicking', 'not', 'making', 'local', 'multiplex', 'catch', 'grand', 'scale', 'epic', 'big', 'screen.I', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'negative', 'press', 'movie', 'received', 'Historical', 'evidence', 'presented', 'quite', 'excellent', 'History', 'channel', 'documentary', 'recently', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'Roman', 'general', 'who', 'did', 'band', 'together', 'native', 'Britons', 'fighting', 'off', 'invading', 'Saxons.The', 'traditional', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'brainwashed', 'movie-going', 'public', 'believing', 'total', 'drivel', 'Arthur', 'was', 'not', 'figure', 'middle', 'ages', 'was', 'not', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'was', 'magical', 'sword', 'stone', 'years', 'have', 'felt', 'disdain', 'manner', 'English', 'have', 'claimed', 'King', 'Arthur', 'own', 'here', 'last', 'movie', 'way', 'setting', 'record', 'straight', 'One', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'warriors', 'Brittany', 'who', 'sailed', 'Norman', 'Conqueror', 'sang', 'celebrated', 'King', 'Arthur', 'hero', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'protect', 'Britons', 'invading', 'Saxon', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'movie', 'presentation', 'Guinevere', 'warrior', 'woman', 'However', 'also', 'historically', 'accurate', 'explained', 'actress', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Making', 'documentary', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'included', 'part', 'impressive', 'DVD', 'set', 'Women', 'often', 'were', 'quite', 'capable', 'warriors', 'was', 'not', 'five', 'centuries', 'later', 'faded', 'historical', 'obscurity', 'Was', 'not', 'Briton', 'warrior', 'queen', 'who', 'caused', 'Rome', 'so', 'much', 'concern', 'earlier', 'centuries', 'first', 'millennium', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'dramatic', 'recounting', 'inspiration', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'Arthur', 'half', 'Briton', 'half', 'Roman', 'who', 'command', 'group', 'Samatian', 'sp', 'cavalrymen', 'guarding', 'Hadrians', 'Wall', 'historical', 'evidence', 'also', 'being', 'accurate', 'account', 'news', 'invasion', 'north', 'Saxons', 'Arthur', 'men', 'are', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'Roman', 'family', 'transport', 'back', 'safety', 'What', 'epic', 'struggle', 'survive', 'growing', 'awareness', 'Arthur', 'Briton', 'heritage.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'also', 'think', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'highlight', 'special', 'features', 'opinion', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'major', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'discuss', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'challenges', 'bringing', 'screen', 'also', 'rather', 'fluffy', 'making', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentary', 'rather', 'lame', 'trivia', 'track', 'movie', 'impressive', 'achievement.NOTE', 'TO', 'MR.', 'GEORGE', 'Most', 'evidence', 'quoted', 'aforementioned', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'King', 'Arthur', 'as', 'well', 'material', 'covered', 'DVD', 'review', 'am', 'also', 'loss', 'understand', 'where', 'assertion', 'have', 'disdain', 'English', 'am', 'part', 'English']",King Arthur
851410,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0002YLCFQ,DarthRad,"[7, 9]","The movie aspires to be a re-telling of one of the many possible origins for the King Arthur legend.  I give it two stars for this effort.  The role of the Roman Empire in Britain is one that is rarely visited by Hollywood, even though the influence of the Romans on English culture lives on today.""King Arthur"" is a mildly entertaining movie, but highly flawed.  Lots of reviews have commented on the historical flaws, but I'll give the movie a pass on this one.  The legend of King Arthur has such murky origins that nobody could possibly mistake this movie for a historical documentary.The biggest problem with this movie, IMHO, is the casting.  The movie employs lots of actors who have done fine work elsewhere, but they just don't fit the characters that they play in this movie.  Let's go through the list:Clive Owen - with his tired and raspy voice, cynical but earnest attitude, droopy eyelids, and sad hound-dog look, Clive Owen has NOIR written all over his face.  His looks and style most closely resemble Humphrey Bogart and he was perfect for his anti-hero roles in ""Sin City"" and ""Inside Man"".  But as King Arthur?  Throughout this movie, I could never see in him the power, the grace, nor the machismo that could inspire a legend that would pass down through the centuries.  King Arthur was a role that someone of the stature of Russell Crowe would have handled easily, but he must have been beyond the budget of this movie.Keira Knightly - it is really weird how a semi-savage Woad/Pict princess can enunciate so clearly in grammar school perfect Received Pronunciation English.  I can hear every consonant in every word that Keira Knightly speaks!  Yes, Keira is somewhat pretty, but her teeth are huge, she has an underbite, her features are too sharp, and her mannerisms too much that of a modern day spoiled, proper suburban English princess for her to be believable as Guinevere, whether played as a Woad/Pict of ancient Britain or as the traditional unfaithful Queen of King Arthur.  Keira was perfect for her roles in ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but not as Guinevere.Ioan Gruffudd - I couldn't figure out why Lancelot was so skinny and wimpy looking and whined so much like a girl until I looked at the credits and realized that this was really Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, hiding behind a hairy black beard, and speaking in perfect R.P. English.  'Nuff said, Ioan was great as the wimpy, nerdy Mr. Fantastic.  But, as with King Arthur, you need someone of STATURE to play the role of Lancelot.  The young Liam Neeson once played this role perfectly in ""Excalibur"".Stellan Skarsgard - this guy actually does have a somewhat funky Swedish lilt to his speech on top of his American accent when he is allowed to speak in complete sentences (e.g., when he appears in the ""Making Of"" featurette), but, playing the role of a Saxon barbarian chief, he is only given a few choice words to grunt out; only his very modern sounding American accent comes through in these grunts.  Since most of Skarsgard's dialogue in this movie is with an actor with a proper German accent (playing the son of the Saxon chief), this mixing and matching of accents is really strange.Joel Edgerton - the young Uncle Owen Lars from Star Wars!  So baby faced, and gentle appearing, definitely not the imperfect, powerful Gawain of legend.Mads Mikkelsen - this guy has seriously hooded eyelids.  He was perfect as the evil Le Chiffre in ""Casino Royale"".  In this movie, hidden behind a heavy black beard, and given few lines to speak, his character Tristan is reduced to a disposable prop, much along the lines of the security guy who always dies in each Star Trek episode.  Tristan was not a minor figure in the Arthurian legends, he was a legend with his own story arc and origins.In summary, this is a rather oddball movie that aspires to greatness, but is undone by poor casting choices and bad dialogue.  It did get me interested in learning more of the real history underlying the plot, things such as the Saxon invasion of Britain, the role of Pelagius in the early Christian Church, and the role of the Romans in ancient Britain.",2,"Interesting take on the history of ancient Britain, undone by poor casting choices and bad dialogue",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,4165,"['movie', 'be', 're-telling', 'one', 'many', 'possible', 'origins', 'King', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'effort', 'role', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Britain', 'one', 'rarely', 'visited', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'influence', 'Romans', 'English', 'culture', 'today', 'King', 'Arthur', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'highly', 'flawed', 'Lots', 'reviews', 'have', 'commented', 'historical', 'flaws', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'pass', 'one', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'such', 'murky', 'origins', 'nobody', 'could', 'possibly', 'mistake', 'movie', 'historical', 'documentary.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'IMHO', 'casting', 'movie', 'lots', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'characters', 'play', 'movie', 'Let', 'go', 'list', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'tired', 'raspy', 'voice', 'cynical', 'earnest', 'attitude', 'droopy', 'eyelids', 'sad', 'hound-dog', 'look', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'NOIR', 'written', 'face', 'looks', 'style', 'most', 'closely', 'resemble', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'was', 'perfect', 'anti-hero', 'roles', 'Sin', 'City', 'Inside', 'Man', 'King', 'Arthur', 'movie', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'power', 'grace', 'machismo', 'could', 'inspire', 'legend', 'would', 'pass', 'down', 'centuries', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'role', 'someone', 'stature', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'easily', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'budget', 'movie.Keira', 'Knightly', 'really', 'weird', 'how', 'semi-savage', 'Woad/Pict', 'princess', 'can', 'enunciate', 'so', 'clearly', 'grammar', 'school', 'perfect', 'Received', 'Pronunciation', 'English', 'can', 'hear', 'consonant', 'word', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Yes', 'Keira', 'somewhat', 'pretty', 'teeth', 'are', 'huge', 'underbite', 'features', 'are', 'too', 'sharp', 'mannerisms', 'too', 'much', 'modern', 'day', 'spoiled', 'proper', 'suburban', 'English', 'princess', 'be', 'believable', 'Guinevere', 'played', 'Woad/Pict', 'ancient', 'Britain', 'traditional', 'unfaithful', 'Queen', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Keira', 'was', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'not', 'Guinevere.Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Lancelot', 'was', 'so', 'skinny', 'wimpy', 'looking', 'whined', 'so', 'much', 'girl', 'looked', 'credits', 'realized', 'was', 'really', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'hiding', 'hairy', 'black', 'beard', 'speaking', 'perfect', 'R.P', 'English', ""'Nuff"", 'said', 'Ioan', 'was', 'great', 'wimpy', 'nerdy', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'King', 'Arthur', 'need', 'someone', 'STATURE', 'play', 'role', 'Lancelot', 'young', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'once', 'played', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Excalibur', '.Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'guy', 'actually', 'have', 'somewhat', 'funky', 'Swedish', 'lilt', 'speech', 'top', 'American', 'accent', 'when', 'allowed', 'speak', 'complete', 'sentences', 'e.g.', 'when', 'Making', 'featurette', 'playing', 'role', 'Saxon', 'barbarian', 'chief', 'only', 'given', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'grunt', 'out', 'only', 'very', 'modern', 'sounding', 'American', 'accent', 'grunts', 'most', 'Skarsgard', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'actor', 'proper', 'German', 'accent', 'playing', 'son', 'Saxon', 'chief', 'mixing', 'matching', 'accents', 'really', 'strange.Joel', 'Edgerton', 'young', 'Uncle', 'Owen', 'Lars', 'Star', 'Wars', 'So', 'baby', 'faced', 'gentle', 'appearing', 'definitely', 'not', 'imperfect', 'powerful', 'Gawain', 'legend.Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'guy', 'seriously', 'hooded', 'eyelids', 'was', 'perfect', 'evil', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'movie', 'hidden', 'heavy', 'black', 'beard', 'given', 'few', 'lines', 'speak', 'character', 'Tristan', 'reduced', 'disposable', 'prop', 'much', 'lines', 'security', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Tristan', 'was', 'not', 'minor', 'figure', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'was', 'legend', 'own', 'story', 'arc', 'origins.In', 'summary', 'rather', 'oddball', 'movie', 'greatness', 'undone', 'poor', 'casting', 'choices', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'did', 'get', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'real', 'history', 'underlying', 'plot', 'things', 'such', 'Saxon', 'invasion', 'Britain', 'role', 'Pelagius', 'early', 'Christian', 'Church', 'role', 'Romans', 'ancient', 'Britain']",King Arthur

Yes, there are historical accounts of a real Arthur, and they mention that he has Roman ties or of Roman lineage.  This movie is pure Hollywood....taking a concept, portraying it as ""the real take"" and then take the concept that could have been accurate and totally distort it out of all recognition.  Despite the innacuracies, I was glad to see a movie that showed Arthur in this light,  I have been an avid amateur Roman historian/reenactor for quite a long time now and it was nice to see something in a movie dealing with this great time of upheaval.One thing I was very surprised about was that Pelagius was brought up in the movie, now for me....someone who is interested in Roman and early Christian history it was exciting and very interesting too see this in a movie.  But for the average person they will know absolutely nothing about Pelagius and the ideas and concepts are not given in great enough depth to truly educate anyone about this very interesting person, they will just look around in confusion and ask what that nonsense was all about.  On the other hand, the stuff you would think they would focus on such as battles and the withdrawl of Rome from Britain is barely visible, one major battle and a few scenes of Romans marching away...come on.......As for wanting a better more in depth view of who the historical Arthur might really have been, and get a very real and believable explanation for many of the mystical aspects of the Arthurian legend I highly recommend the Camulod Chronicles by Jack Whyte.",3,Good but could have been Great,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,1649,"['Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'tidbits', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'already', 'been', 'beaten', 'death', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'Yes', 'are', 'historical', 'accounts', 'real', 'Arthur', 'mention', 'Roman', 'ties', 'Roman', 'lineage', 'movie', 'pure', 'Hollywood', '.taking', 'concept', 'portraying', 'real', 'take', 'then', 'take', 'concept', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accurate', 'totally', 'distort', 'recognition', 'innacuracies', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'movie', 'showed', 'Arthur', 'light', 'have', 'been', 'avid', 'amateur', 'Roman', 'historian/reenactor', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'movie', 'dealing', 'great', 'time', 'upheaval.One', 'thing', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'was', 'Pelagius', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'movie', 'now', '.someone', 'who', 'interested', 'Roman', 'early', 'Christian', 'history', 'was', 'exciting', 'very', 'interesting', 'too', 'see', 'movie', 'average', 'person', 'will', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Pelagius', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'great', 'enough', 'depth', 'truly', 'educate', 'anyone', 'very', 'interesting', 'person', 'will', 'just', 'look', 'around', 'confusion', 'ask', 'what', 'nonsense', 'was', 'about', 'other', 'hand', 'stuff', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'focus', 'such', 'battles', 'withdrawl', 'Rome', 'Britain', 'barely', 'visible', 'one', 'major', 'battle', 'few', 'scenes', 'Romans', 'marching', 'away', 'come', '.As', 'wanting', 'better', 'more', 'depth', 'view', 'who', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'get', 'very', 'real', 'believable', 'explanation', 'many', 'mystical', 'aspects', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Camulod', 'Chronicles', 'Jack', 'Whyte']",King Arthur
851412,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0002YLCFQ,David A. Wend,"[1, 3]","I did not see ""King Arthur"" when it was in theaters but I wish that I had seen it on a big screen.  To be truthful, having seen the trailers I was not sure about the casting or that the story would be interesting.  I was wrong on both counts.  What appeals to me about this story of King Arthur is that it goes against the romanticized stories of the Knights of the Round Table and the search for the Holy Grail.  This is the historic Arthur or Lucius Artorius Castus.  What is known about this legendary hero is that he defeated the Saxons and established control over a large part of England.  The story presented in the film has Arthur and his Sarmatian cavalry (recruited from the modern day area of Hungary) in the days before the fall of Rome as the only effective force that maintains law and order in what was once a Roman province.There is a round table in this Arthur, signifying the equality of the knights, which dismays Bishop when he sees he will not be given preferential treatment.  Guinevere, however, is not simply the object of Arthur's (and Lancelot's) affection but is a tribal warrior maiden; and Merlin in a tribal leader who is opposed to Arthur and the dwindling authority of Rome.  Keira Knightly, playing Guinevere, has come in for a good deal of mirth for her portrayal of a warrior rather than the traditional role of Arthur's Queen.  However, now that archaeological evidence has proved that there really were Amazons and we know that women fought as gladiators and, recently, even serving with the legions in Britain, it should not be so shocking a leap to have Guinevere as a warrior.  Although Ms. Knightly has scenes where she is the only woman fighting with men, there are also scenes in the final battle where she is one of several women.  It may seem odd that her body is painted blue (not just face-paint) but it is certainly true that tribal people did paint themselves.Clive Owen does a magnificent job playing Arthur and is well supported by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet).  I liked Keira Knightly and Stephen Dillane made Merlin an interesting opponent/ally.  My only complaint is that Hadrian's Wall looked a bit skimpy for it being the location of one of the forts.

851414,AECVYXIL9791R,B0002YLCFQ,David C. Read,"[2, 12]","This radical re-imagining of the Camelot/Arthur/Launcelot/Guinevere story is bound to leave most viewers mystified and shaking their heads.  This film doesn't work on any level; it begins and ends as a bloody hack-and-stab fest, and the middle consists of yet more violence.  The ""unrated"" version just adds an extra ten minutes of gratuitous and unedifying hacking and stabbing, as Rasputin-like characters refuse to succumb to butchery that would kill any ordinary person.I write because what little plot there is involves a famous theological dispute between two Christian thinkers of the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Pelagius and Augustine.  Augustine (354-430 A.D.) believed that as a result of Adam's Fall, human nature is hopelessly enslaved to sin, and we are incapable of making right decisions except through the grace of God.  Pelagius (354-418 A.D.), a British theologian, believed that although countless generations of sin had weakened the human character, each person is still essentially free to make right choices, and can live without sinning by the right exercise of the will.  The controversy has been a perennial one within Christianity, with the church generally being closer to Augustine than to Pelagius.  (Although it should be noted that most Protestants reject the extreme form of Augustine's doctrine of ""original sin,"" which holds that not only are we born sinful, i.e., prone to sin, but we are born into guilt, thus necessating the rite of infant baptism.)In the movie, Pelagius was Arthur's mentor in Christianity (which is plausible, since Pelagius was a Celtic monk who spent most of his career in Britain).  But, ridiculously, the movie changes the spiritual views of Pelagius and Augustine into political views.  Pelagius as seen as some sort of champion of political freedom and self-determination, while the other view is seen as promoting serfdom and slavery.  The anti-Pelagian Christians have built a special dungeon in which to imprison their political?/religious? opponents.  Of course, this is just silly.  The debate between Pelagius and Augustine had nothing to do with politics or social organization.  I suppose nothing better could be expected from such a stupid low-brow movie, but then why even mention the name Pelagius, never mind make it so prominent in the movie?What is worse, the movie seems to be a broadside attack on Christianity:  The pagan knights are honorable and self-sacrificing, whereas the villain of the piece is a Roman bishop.",2,Interesting theological reference,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,2502,"['radical', 're-imagining', 'Camelot/Arthur/Launcelot/Guinevere', 'story', 'bound', 'leave', 'most', 'viewers', 'mystified', 'shaking', 'heads', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'level', 'bloody', 'hack-and-stab', 'fest', 'middle', 'yet', 'more', 'violence', 'unrated', 'version', 'just', 'extra', 'ten', 'minutes', 'gratuitous', 'unedifying', 'hacking', 'stabbing', 'Rasputin-like', 'characters', 'refuse', 'succumb', 'butchery', 'would', 'kill', 'ordinary', 'person.I', 'write', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'famous', 'theological', 'dispute', 'two', 'Christian', 'thinkers', 'late', '4th', 'early', '5th', 'centuries', 'Pelagius', 'Augustine', 'Augustine', '354-430', 'A.D.', 'believed', 'result', 'Adam', 'Fall', 'human', 'nature', 'hopelessly', 'enslaved', 'sin', 'are', 'incapable', 'making', 'right', 'decisions', 'grace', 'God', 'Pelagius', '354-418', 'A.D.', 'British', 'theologian', 'believed', 'countless', 'generations', 'sin', 'had', 'weakened', 'human', 'character', 'person', 'still', 'essentially', 'free', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'can', 'live', 'sinning', 'right', 'exercise', 'will', 'controversy', 'been', 'perennial', 'one', 'Christianity', 'church', 'generally', 'being', 'closer', 'Augustine', 'Pelagius', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'most', 'Protestants', 'reject', 'extreme', 'form', 'Augustine', 'doctrine', 'original', 'sin', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'born', 'sinful', 'i.e.', 'prone', 'sin', 'are', 'born', 'guilt', 'thus', 'necessating', 'rite', 'infant', 'baptism', 'movie', 'Pelagius', 'was', 'Arthur', 'mentor', 'Christianity', 'plausible', 'Pelagius', 'was', 'Celtic', 'monk', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'Britain', 'ridiculously', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'views', 'Pelagius', 'Augustine', 'political', 'views', 'Pelagius', 'as', 'seen', 'sort', 'champion', 'political', 'freedom', 'self-determination', 'other', 'view', 'seen', 'promoting', 'serfdom', 'slavery', 'anti-Pelagian', 'Christians', 'have', 'built', 'special', 'dungeon', 'imprison', 'political', '/religious', 'opponents', 'course', 'just', 'silly', 'debate', 'Pelagius', 'Augustine', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'politics', 'social', 'organization', 'suppose', 'nothing', 'better', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'such', 'stupid', 'low-brow', 'movie', 'then', 'why', 'even', 'mention', 'name', 'Pelagius', 'never', 'mind', 'make', 'so', 'prominent', 'movie', 'What', 'worse', 'movie', 'be', 'broadside', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'pagan', 'knights', 'are', 'honorable', 'self-sacrificing', 'villain', 'piece', 'Roman', 'bishop']",King Arthur

Neither of the main actors for Arthur and Lancelot are household names.

Yes, they were quite good at conveying the emotions surrounding being indentured for years, ready for freedom, and then having that freedom snapped away.  Brilliant even.  But when there was no brooding on their freedom, something was just missing.  It's one of those situations where the actors either nail the characters dead on, or they don't.  Although truthfully, I cannot blame the actors entirely, as the script was pretty mediocre.The action was the saving grace of this film.  The action scenes were realistic, well-paced and in the case of the ice-floe fight, quite creative.  Sadly, when there was no fighting, things dragged just a bit.  Again, script issues.Many things were eliminated from the ""legends"".  No love triangle, no Merlin hurling spells, no plate armour or a Lady of the Lake with a magical sword, and no part fey villianess striving to have her son get the throne.  Truthfully, I didn't really miss it.  I would have liked to have seen the Merlin character fleshed out a bit more, but that's about all I can complain about in terms of the legend.  The beef is the script; we got a small piece of what could have been a month in the life of Arthur, but I got to the end of the film and said ""so what?""  I just didn't care about what happened in the film.There just wasn't enough meat to the film, and that's the problem.

Clive Owen is at his very worst here, with his patented flat vocal delivery - like a bored photocopier salesman demonstrating a clapped out machine with one eye on the clock for the pubs opening - working overtime here to suck the life out of every scene he's in. The part is pretty well written, but he's hopelessly out of his depth with dialogue. Particularly painful are his prayer and his rallying the troops, where he just looks bored stiff and doesn't even try. And what's with the look of utter contempt he gives Guinevere in the wedding scene? It's a terrible performance.Unfortunately it's matched by the dreaded Keira Knightley, who is equally bad but in different ways. Her Hollywood career is a bit of a mystery: there are much prettier lasses and better actresses out there and she has no screen presence. She struggles badly with the lines, delivering them in a flat Rodean (a posh English school) accent that is oh so very wrong for a Scottish warrior queen. And when she gets bloody in the battle scenes, she just looks ridiculous, like she'd tried putting her lipstick on in turbulence. The fact that she's so anorexic she looks like a small child could knock her down just by blowing softly on her just makes her action-gal act that much more of a bad joke.Together this terrible twosome sabotage the good work of director and supporting cast whenever they dominate the screen.

Well, it's average.  Clive Owen (Arthur) does the job, as does Keira Knightley (Guinevere) -- though the fact that she weighs about 90 pounds yet we're expected to believe, historically, that she's a fierce British warrior fighting alongside the men is very hard to swallow.The screenplay? Could have (nay, MUST have!) been written by a child.  There are constantly corny lines like: ""Burn all the villages, kill everyone"" that caused many in the movie theatre to laugh out loud.The only enjoyable aspect of the film is Stellan Skarsgard, a very underrated, Swedish-born actor who plays the Saxon chief.  However, the audience is distracted by the childish screenplay in which Saxons are the clear villains while the Britons are the good guys, with no gray in between.  Very elementary.  There is nothing in history attesting to Saxons being the ""bad"" guys but... seeing as how they are German and Hollywood NEVER passes up the chance to rip into Germans, it wasn't surprising that the audience is subjected to a ""Saxons are evil"" screenplay.The battle scenes are short, confusing and lack enough dramatic action, while the plot development is puzzling and the film ending abrupt.Another aspect of the movie that will bother many audience members is its shockingly anti-Christian theme.  This is particularly ironic in a movie that draws elements from the intensely-Christian Arthurian legends (legends where knights attend mass daily, carry crosses on their shields, and seek the Holy Grail).  Here are a few examples of anti-Christian scenes from the film:1) The first priest we encounter in the film is blatantly homosexual (looks and mannerisms), perpetuating the stereotype that all priests are; 2) The next 'man of the cloth' we meet is a bishop sent from Rome who is a cruel, cunning liar; 3) The only two other holy men in the film are murderers. We meet these two lovely lads in a scene where Arthur breaks down a sealed doorway at a Roman nobleman's home, only to discover several corpses of tortured men, women, and children who have been tortured by two priests for refusal to renounce their pagan beliefs;  4) The Roman nobleman defends the two holy men's actions, telling Arthur: ""You're a Christian!  You should understand!""  Again, people laughed out loud in the theatre at this line.  So now Christianity means torturing and starving to death children who don't convert?  Nice job, Hollywood.  Apparently, producers can't get enough of bashing Christianity;  5) Arthur is the only Christian of the knights (bizarre in a film that incorporates characters from the legends, like Lancelot, while omitting these characters' intensely Christian beliefs).  Even Arthur is wobbly on Christianity.  He later learns that his hero, Pelagius, a philosopher, ""has been burned in Rome as a heretic for preaching that all men are free.""  Now, Arthur's already-shaky beliefs in the Church are shattered.  What a joke.  Actually, a ""Pelagius"" did exist but he was never burned as a heretic by the Church nor did he ever preach men were born free.  In the end of the film, Arthur indirectly renounces Christianity and marries ""pagan"" Guinevere in a ""pagan"" ceremony.  (Sir Thomas Mallory must be rolling in his grave!);  6) Sir Bors -- the most ""likeable"" character because he serves as the film's comic relief -- grabs the priest's crucifix and mocks it in an opening scene.  He jokingly holds the crucifix, looks up to the sky, and asks for rain.  When none comes, he berates the priest, telling him that a crucifix means nothing.  Such mocking of ANY religion in a film MIGHT be acceptable if Sir Bors were to later retract his sentiments or the film somehow showed another side but, of course, this never happens.  The scene, a testament to Hollywood's prejudice against Christianity, stands on its own, unretracted.I do not recommend this film on any account.  Even if the anti-Christian propaganda and prejudice does not bother you, you will be gravely disappointed with the screenplay and plot development.  It is an utter waste of two hours.",1,blatantly anti-Christian AND historically inaccurate,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,4608,"['NOTE', 'movie', 'NOT', 'based', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'based', 'legends', 'watch', 'Excalibur', 'fairness', 'opening', 'credits', 'do', 'state', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'belief', 'rather', 'legends', 'who', 'Arthur', 'really', 'was', 'British', 'chieftain', 'who', 'lived', '500', 'A.D.', 'What', 'troubling', 'movie', 'based', 'history', 'why', 'then', 'movie', 'still', 'incorporate', 'characters', 'found', 'legends', 'Merlin', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'Tristan', 'Bors', 'even', 'Round', 'Table', 'acting', 'Well', 'average', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Arthur', 'job', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Guinevere', 'fact', '90', 'pounds', 'yet', ""'re"", 'expected', 'believe', 'historically', 'fierce', 'British', 'warrior', 'fighting', 'men', 'very', 'hard', 'swallow.The', 'screenplay', 'Could', 'have', 'nay', 'MUST', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'child', 'are', 'constantly', 'corny', 'lines', 'villages', 'kill', 'everyone', 'caused', 'many', 'movie', 'theatre', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud.The', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'film', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'very', 'underrated', 'Swedish-born', 'actor', 'who', 'Saxon', 'chief', 'However', 'audience', 'distracted', 'childish', 'screenplay', 'Saxons', 'are', 'clear', 'villains', 'Britons', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'gray', 'Very', 'elementary', 'nothing', 'history', 'attesting', 'Saxons', 'being', 'bad', 'guys', 'seeing', 'how', 'are', 'German', 'Hollywood', 'NEVER', 'up', 'chance', 'rip', 'Germans', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'audience', 'subjected', 'Saxons', 'are', 'evil', 'screenplay.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'short', 'confusing', 'lack', 'enough', 'dramatic', 'action', 'plot', 'development', 'puzzling', 'film', 'ending', 'abrupt.Another', 'aspect', 'movie', 'will', 'bother', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'shockingly', 'anti-Christian', 'theme', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'movie', 'elements', 'intensely-Christian', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'where', 'knights', 'attend', 'mass', 'daily', 'carry', 'crosses', 'shields', 'seek', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'anti-Christian', 'scenes', 'film:1', 'first', 'priest', 'encounter', 'film', 'blatantly', 'homosexual', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'perpetuating', 'stereotype', 'priests', 'are', '2', 'next', ""'man"", 'cloth', 'meet', 'bishop', 'sent', 'Rome', 'who', 'cruel', 'cunning', 'liar', '3', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'holy', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'murderers', 'meet', 'two', 'lovely', 'lads', 'scene', 'where', 'Arthur', 'down', 'sealed', 'doorway', 'Roman', 'nobleman', 'home', 'only', 'discover', 'several', 'corpses', 'tortured', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'tortured', 'two', 'priests', 'refusal', 'renounce', 'pagan', 'beliefs', '4', 'Roman', 'nobleman', 'two', 'holy', 'men', 'actions', 'telling', 'Arthur', ""'re"", 'Christian', 'should', 'understand', 'Again', 'people', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'theatre', 'line', 'So', 'now', 'Christianity', 'torturing', 'starving', 'death', 'children', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'convert', 'Nice', 'job', 'Hollywood', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'bashing', 'Christianity', '5', 'Arthur', 'only', 'Christian', 'knights', 'bizarre', 'film', 'characters', 'legends', 'Lancelot', 'omitting', 'characters', 'intensely', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'Even', 'Arthur', 'wobbly', 'Christianity', 'later', 'hero', 'Pelagius', 'philosopher', 'been', 'burned', 'Rome', 'heretic', 'preaching', 'men', 'are', 'free', 'Now', 'Arthur', 'already-shaky', 'beliefs', 'Church', 'are', 'shattered', 'What', 'joke', 'Actually', 'Pelagius', 'did', 'exist', 'was', 'never', 'burned', 'heretic', 'Church', 'did', 'ever', 'preach', 'men', 'were', 'born', 'free', 'end', 'film', 'Arthur', 'indirectly', 'Christianity', 'marries', 'pagan', 'Guinevere', 'pagan', 'ceremony', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Mallory', 'must', 'be', 'rolling', 'grave', '6', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'most', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'grabs', 'priest', 'crucifix', 'mocks', 'opening', 'scene', 'jokingly', 'crucifix', 'sky', 'asks', 'rain', 'When', 'none', 'priest', 'telling', 'crucifix', 'nothing', 'Such', 'mocking', 'ANY', 'religion', 'film', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'acceptable', 'Sir', 'Bors', 'were', 'later', 'retract', 'sentiments', 'film', 'somehow', 'showed', 'side', 'course', 'never', 'scene', 'testament', 'Hollywood', 'prejudice', 'Christianity', 'own', 'unretracted.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'account', 'Even', 'anti-Christian', 'propaganda', 'prejudice', 'not', 'bother', 'will', 'be', 'gravely', 'disappointed', 'screenplay', 'plot', 'development', 'utter', 'waste', 'two', 'hours']",King Arthur

The time period in which this movie takes place is not a ""Disney"", fantasy, make believe, magical time.  The period is one of the darkest in European history where plague wiped out entire cities and towns so the subject matter is hearty, believable and robust quite in keeping with the times.  A declining Roman empire streached to the limits and Britania and the area(s) to the west often ruled by cruel, merciless kings and tyrants.  The story is a difficult one to tell given the dire times of that age and I believe that Jerry Breckenhiemer and Antoine Fuqua took license here but so do our so called historians and archeologists in the telling of this tale.  This is not your grandmother's ""Excalibur"" which allthough entertaining and amusing, just is not reality.  Arthur is driven by demons and events from his past like men today are, no big deal because we all are just human and so was Lancelot and Geneviere.  The actors kept you involved without too much made up legend about who they were or could have been and the action was fantastic and gory at the same time.  After all, war is not a picnic but men, women and children die sometimes horrible and needless deaths for no better reason than they are there at the time.Enjoy ""King Arthur"" for what it was meant for a good tale of betrayal, regret, greed, love, mercy and conquest, which is an old tale that has been happening since the dawn of time.  Oh, and by the way Merlin was not a magician who pulled rabbits out of a hat, if he also existed just as Arthur and the others during this very dark and troubled time in history then he was either a pagan or a christian just like everyone else.Two hours and fifteen minutes of ""Gladiator"" style action and adventure!",5,"Heros, Legends, & Truth",1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1862,"['action', 'fans', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'direction', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Nothing', 'missed', 'stunts', 'are', 'great', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'place', 'not', 'Disney', 'fantasy', 'make', 'believe', 'magical', 'time', 'period', 'one', 'darkest', 'European', 'history', 'where', 'plague', 'wiped', 'out', 'entire', 'cities', 'towns', 'subject', 'matter', 'hearty', 'believable', 'robust', 'quite', 'keeping', 'times', 'declining', 'Roman', 'empire', 'streached', 'limits', 'Britania', 'area', 'west', 'often', 'ruled', 'cruel', 'merciless', 'kings', 'tyrants', 'story', 'difficult', 'one', 'tell', 'given', 'dire', 'times', 'age', 'believe', 'Jerry', 'Breckenhiemer', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'took', 'license', 'here', 'so', 'do', 'so', 'called', 'historians', 'archeologists', 'telling', 'tale', 'not', 'grandmother', 'Excalibur', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'just', 'not', 'reality', 'Arthur', 'driven', 'demons', 'events', 'past', 'men', 'today', 'are', 'big', 'deal', 'are', 'just', 'human', 'so', 'was', 'Lancelot', 'Geneviere', 'actors', 'kept', 'involved', 'too', 'much', 'made', 'up', 'legend', 'who', 'were', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'action', 'was', 'fantastic', 'gory', 'same', 'time', 'war', 'not', 'picnic', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'die', 'sometimes', 'horrible', 'needless', 'deaths', 'better', 'reason', 'are', 'there', 'time.Enjoy', 'King', 'Arthur', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'good', 'tale', 'betrayal', 'regret', 'greed', 'love', 'mercy', 'conquest', 'old', 'tale', 'been', 'happening', 'dawn', 'time', 'Oh', 'way', 'Merlin', 'was', 'not', 'magician', 'who', 'pulled', 'hat', 'also', 'existed', 'just', 'Arthur', 'others', 'very', 'dark', 'troubled', 'time', 'history', 'then', 'was', 'pagan', 'christian', 'just', 'everyone', 'else.Two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Gladiator', 'style', 'action', 'adventure']",King Arthur

I guess you have to be a huge fan of the arthur mythos to like all the different books and movies about it, with different take and different perspective and such.  I am and I also read horrible review for this movie.  But I love thios subject and hate reviewers and critics, so I went and saw it anways.  I loved this new version.  Arthur and his knights being forced to work with the romans.  Merlin being the leader of the Woads (the group of tribal outcast people) and whoever the actor was that lead the Saxon army was very well done.  The battle on the lake was really good and pretty intense, with the ice threatening to break with every step and the huge battle at the end with the alliance of the Romans and the Woads leaving a very confused and evenutally dead saxon army.  Plus Arthur's Marriage to a very young and attractive (especially in her war paint!) Guineverre.  This is actually the very first version of Arthur's legend where I don't despise Guinevere.  I loved her in this movie, although I thought Lancelot took her place as the nagging wimp.  But the other knights were great, especially Gawain.If you're a huge fan of these myths and want to welcome a change and a less myth-based version, see it.  If you are not a fan, don't bother.

851427,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0002YLCFQ,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","The story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table has seen countless screen adaptations.  There have been some retellings closer to the legendary fable such as 'First Knight,' and then you get ingenious spoofs such as 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'  What they all have in common is that they pay tribute to the elments of the legend in some respect:  the sword Excalibur, the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere, the kingdom of Camelot, the Round Table, etc.  Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of countless movies and TV shows (such as 'Pirates of the Carribean') offers a new twist on the familiar tale.  Under the direction of Antoine Fuqua, 'King Arthur' attempts to tell a story of Arthur without all the mysticism and mythology.Without ruining the movie, here is some basic plot information:  Arthur is the son of a Roman that married a Briton.  He has been put in command of a group of Knights that are transplants from Samatra, a kingdom far to the East in Europe that was conqured by Rome.  The Samatran Knights serve Rome in exchange for one day gaining their freedom.  Just when it looks like they are about to gain their freedom, the Saxons invade Northern Britain, and the Bishop from Rome has one last job for the Knights.Some of the elements of the classic Arthurian tale do still exist in this movie, including Excalibur (but it has no mystical powers), the round table, and most of Arthur's legendary knights.  Merlin even makes an appearance, but he is much less of an ally to Arthur than you might expect.  Keira Knightly plays a Guinevere that although starts off as a damsel in distress, is hardly the typical fair maiden waiting for the heroic knight to rescue her.While the movie purports to tell a story of Arthur that is truer to fact, it can't be taken as entirely true.  First, Lancelot appears to have been an invention of the French courts once the story of Arthur had crossed the English channel.  Yet, he still appears in the movie as Arthur's right hand man.  Ioan Gruffudd does and admirable job playing the straight forward sidekick to Clive Owen's Arthur.  Second, while the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church did suffer from a fair amount of corruption, the level displayed by each in this movie seems to be way over the top.  Third, while I commend the creators of the movie for not just dressing up Arthur's Knights in suits of shining armor, and attempting to give them a more periodic look for the Fifth Century, some of their look was just a little too modern for my taste.Despite its flaws, the movie does have its strengths.  The movie appears to have been well researched (although not all the things that must have turned up in that research made it into the movie).  Arthur uses Roman battle techniques against the Romans, including the use of a great deal of smoke.  While this makes it hard for the enemy to see, it frequently made it difficult for the viewer to comprehend what was happening.  To counteract this, the costume department created uniforms for the various peoples in the movies that made it fairly easy to tell who was who.  The Romans were clearly Romans decked out in their traditional roman garb and battle standards.  The Saxons had a very definite nordic look to them.  The Celts/Picts show up in lots of leather and skins and frequently paint themselves blue and grey.  The special effects work that was done to get the look of Arthur's England (out of Ireland no less) was quite impressive as well.The DVD contains a fair amount of extras.  There is a 'making of' featurette that I found quite interesting.  It runs about 18 minutes, but I'd like to have seen more.  The making of the movie was at least as interesting as the movie.  There is a ""round table"" discussion between some of the cast, director, producer, and writer of the movie.  While it does shed some insight into the movie, it seemed to fall prey to the usual pitfalls of such features:  too much of a lovefest, too much congratulatory back slapping.  The DVD also contains a diretor's commentary, a X-Box Demo for the game based on the movie, and some other features.Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  It was a bit long, and the spaces between battles tended to move too slowly.  While it may be more historically accurate than other Arthur movies, it simply isn't THE definitive tale because it just can't be.  The climatic battle scene starts off a bit confusingly and is often times difficult to tell what is happening.  All that being said, it was a refreshing look at the story.  I'd recommend it to anyone that likes Arthur, movies will large scale battles, and adventure movie fans.  I'd give the movie about 3.5 stars, but after viewing the DVD extras, I fell the DVD is worth about 4.5.",4,Remaking a Legend,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,4755,"['story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'seen', 'countless', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'have', 'been', 'retellings', 'closer', 'legendary', 'fable', 'such', ""'First"", 'Knight', 'then', 'get', 'ingenious', 'spoofs', 'such', ""'Monty"", 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'What', 'have', 'common', 'pay', 'tribute', 'elments', 'legend', 'respect', 'sword', 'Excalibur', 'love', 'triangle', 'Lancelot', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'kingdom', 'Camelot', 'Round', 'Table', 'etc', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'producer', 'countless', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', ""'Pirates"", 'Carribean', 'new', 'twist', 'familiar', 'tale', 'direction', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', ""'King"", 'Arthur', 'attempts', 'tell', 'story', 'Arthur', 'mysticism', 'mythology.Without', 'ruining', 'movie', 'here', 'basic', 'plot', 'information', 'Arthur', 'son', 'Roman', 'married', 'Briton', 'been', 'put', 'command', 'group', 'Knights', 'are', 'transplants', 'Samatra', 'kingdom', 'far', 'East', 'Europe', 'was', 'conqured', 'Rome', 'Samatran', 'Knights', 'serve', 'Rome', 'exchange', 'one', 'day', 'gaining', 'freedom', 'Just', 'when', 'are', 'gain', 'freedom', 'Saxons', 'invade', 'Northern', 'Britain', 'Bishop', 'Rome', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'Knights.Some', 'elements', 'classic', 'Arthurian', 'tale', 'do', 'still', 'exist', 'movie', 'including', 'Excalibur', 'mystical', 'powers', 'round', 'table', 'most', 'Arthur', 'legendary', 'knights', 'Merlin', 'even', 'appearance', 'much', 'less', 'ally', 'Arthur', 'might', 'expect', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Guinevere', 'off', 'damsel', 'distress', 'hardly', 'typical', 'fair', 'maiden', 'waiting', 'heroic', 'knight', 'rescue', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'Arthur', 'truer', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'entirely', 'true', 'First', 'Lancelot', 'have', 'been', 'invention', 'French', 'courts', 'story', 'Arthur', 'had', 'crossed', 'English', 'channel', 'still', 'movie', 'Arthur', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'admirable', 'job', 'playing', 'straight', 'forward', 'sidekick', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Arthur', 'Second', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'did', 'suffer', 'fair', 'amount', 'corruption', 'level', 'displayed', 'movie', 'be', 'way', 'top', 'Third', 'commend', 'creators', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'dressing', 'up', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'suits', 'shining', 'armor', 'attempting', 'give', 'more', 'periodic', 'look', 'Fifth', 'Century', 'look', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'modern', 'taste.Despite', 'flaws', 'movie', 'have', 'strengths', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'researched', 'not', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'turned', 'up', 'research', 'made', 'movie', 'Arthur', 'Roman', 'battle', 'techniques', 'Romans', 'including', 'use', 'great', 'deal', 'smoke', 'hard', 'enemy', 'see', 'frequently', 'made', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'comprehend', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'counteract', 'costume', 'department', 'created', 'uniforms', 'various', 'peoples', 'movies', 'made', 'fairly', 'easy', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'Romans', 'were', 'clearly', 'Romans', 'decked', 'out', 'traditional', 'roman', 'garb', 'battle', 'standards', 'Saxons', 'had', 'very', 'definite', 'nordic', 'look', 'Celts/Picts', 'show', 'up', 'lots', 'leather', 'skins', 'frequently', 'paint', 'blue', 'grey', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'get', 'look', 'Arthur', 'England', 'Ireland', 'less', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'fair', 'amount', 'extras', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', '18', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'as', 'interesting', 'movie', 'round', 'table', 'discussion', 'cast', 'director', 'producer', 'writer', 'movie', 'shed', 'insight', 'movie', 'seemed', 'fall', 'prey', 'usual', 'pitfalls', 'such', 'features', 'too', 'much', 'lovefest', 'too', 'much', 'congratulatory', 'back', 'slapping', 'DVD', 'also', 'diretor', 'commentary', 'X-Box', 'Demo', 'game', 'based', 'movie', 'other', 'features.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'spaces', 'battles', 'tended', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'other', 'Arthur', 'movies', 'simply', ""n't"", 'THE', 'definitive', 'tale', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'climatic', 'battle', 'scene', 'bit', 'confusingly', 'often', 'times', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'refreshing', 'look', 'story', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Arthur', 'movies', 'will', 'large', 'scale', 'battles', 'adventure', 'movie', 'fans', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'fell', 'DVD', 'worth', '4.5']",King Arthur

As another riff on the Matter of Britain, I have little quarrel with this movie.There was much in it to enjoy, Clive Owen, the director's stunning visuals and sense of place, the guy playing Bors whose name escapes me, Stellan Skargard's scary and utterly convincing Saxon badass, the battle on the ice...I could go on.Now about the history.  I should probably know better than to cavil with Mr. Franzoni's historical underpinnings for his script.  I did once before with Gladiator. I thought, ""Sheesh, no real Roman emperor would endanger himself by getting in the arena with a real gladiator.""  Oooops.Actually, I have no problem with the whole Sarmatian thing.  Nor do I object to the Arthur as Roman commander thing. Other authors, most notably, Rosemary Sutcliff in her wonderful book, Sword at Sunset, also place the Arthurian story in the same time period.  The premise that Arthur was a Roman or Romanized Celtic commander is not new or particularly radical.It's the Woads (or the Picts) that make me uneasy.  They are presented as the ""native Britons,"" a kind of guerilla force striking at their Roman conquerors.  Well not exactly.  The Picts and their lands were never conquered by the Romans.  In fact, the Roman emperor Hadrian built his wall to keep the Picts from raiding into Romanized Celtic Britain.It is a subtle but telling difference.  One thing it means is that the Picts probably would have identified themselves as Briton with the same eagerness that Koreans would identify themselves as Chinese.The other thing it means is the Britons who probably did face and fight the Saxons at Badon Hill were the very same Romanized Celts whose tribal ancestors had been conquered by the Romans centuries earlier.  They no longer painted themselves blue and their women probably did not take part in battle as their tribal ancestors did.And they were not happy at the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain.  Oh no.  Quite the contrary.  They were appalled and terrified.  They were facing the complete destruction of, for them, a very comfortable existance as part of the Roman empire.  They were, on the whole, happy with being part of the Roman empire, particularly when the alternative was being slaughtered and enslaved by hordes of Skarsgard-like Saxon badasses.Although the Picts did fight off Saxon incursions on their own lands, I am not quite sure why they were injected into this situation.  Unless the actual Romanized Britons didn't strike Mr. Franzoni as heroic or ""freedom loving"" enough for cinematic glory.After all, they were just your average schmoes (merchants, coppersmiths, cheesemakers, carpenters, peasants, bureaucrats, alewives, etc.) stuck in a really bad spot.  Yet they managed to find a leader and the wherewithal to turn back the tide of barbarism long enough to keep their hybrid culture from being completely eradicated.Come to think of it, that sounds like a pretty good premise for a movie script.  Maybe someday someone will write it like that.Finally, just one minor picky nit.  How likely is it that a Roman villa complete with soldiers and slaves existed at that time in the territory above Hadrian's wall?  But of course I thought a Roman emperor fighting a gladiator in the arena was unlikely too. Maybe Mr. Franzoni has another surprise for me.",4,I loved the movie.

Therefore I'm inclined to want a more historically accurate ""King Arthur"" and this was so very well done. While I am a big fan of the King Arthur myth, I feel that version of the story was more than adequately covered in ""Excalibur"" anyone who is disapointed with a Roman version of Arthur should stick with ""Excalibur"".I won't rehash the movie here, but I will add that I am much more impressed with the Director's cut, the added scenes are very key to the storyline, I also prefer the original ending, which just made more sense than ""Suddenly, a wedding occurred!"".My only beef is the death of Tristan, I have a hard time believing that a warrior of that magnitude would be such an easy kill for a rather slow-moving lump of a Saxon. The scene couldn't have been more offensive unless they had, had him trip and fall on his own battle-ax!Other than that, the casting was well done and wonderfully performed.

Probably not!Meanwhile, Hollywood will produce each depiction for the public to dissect. The ""King Arthur"" (2004) DVD follows Artorius (Clive Owen) as half Briton half Roman. His knights are made up Sarmatain fighters. The Romans conquered the Sarmatain Empire, so as a condition of survival all of their male offspring must serve the Roman Empire for fifteen years.  Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is the most recognized name in King Arthur's court. But in this movie he is just part of the knight round table. Ray Winstone's character Bors steals the show from all the other knights.The knight's last mission before their tour of duty ends is to rescue a Roman family that is about to be invaded by the Saxons. Merlin's Briton fighters do not fight for the Roman Empire, but fight for native Britons. Merlin knows Artorius is half Briton, so he decides his fight is not with him but the Saxons. Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is saved by Artorius but fights for Merlin. The battle ending is not for the faint of heart.I like this DVD for its action scenes and overall feel for time depiction. Ireland's location was perfect for filming the countryside shots. David Franzoni wrote the script.

It has a handsome, brooding hero, noble knightly cohorts, a stunning if oddly clothed heroine (and yes, the Celts did go into battle virtually naked and smeared with paint, unlike the armour-wearing Romans or Round-Table knights), beautiful cinematography, and a great score.  The battle scenes are amazing, whether Director's cut or not, and I, for one, was glad to see almost nothing of the Lancelot-Guenivere sub-plot.

To be sure, these motifs are straight out of the writings of Sir Thomas Mallory.  However, they are also anachronisms when juxtaposed with the original myth.This film gets back to the roots of the myth, which date back to right around the end of the Roman occupation.  It also picks up on Arthur and his knights being descendents of Samarian knights, which is a plausible theory.  In short, the epoch portrayed in this movie served as the genesis of the legend of Arthur.  Whether or not the fellow ever actually existed is still a matter of speculation - even amongst historians with doctorates.David Franzoni, the writer of GLADIATOR, once again displays his erudition as he mixes historical fact with fictional details.  There are some cool special features that entice one to admire the lengths they went to in making the sets and battle scenes / battle tactics as authentic as possible.  One leaves this movie feeling as though he or she was just in the middle of 5th century (CE) Britain.Clive Owen is terrific as the noble Arthur. Hans Zimmer delivers yet another top-notch soundtrack.  The direction is excellent. Unfortunately, the Unrated label does not = Keira Knightley taking her shirt off.  However, she still looks very sexy in Celtic warpaint!One of the most refreshing factors of the film is that it does not concentrate on the love-triangle.  That this is an important part of the myth is not in dispute.  However, some versions of the tale focus on the triangle to the detriment to the rest of the myth.  In this movie, things never get past some subtle flirting between Lancelot & Guinivere.For fans of the legend, this movie is a can't miss.

As the story begins, the Roman leagions are being withdrawn, just ahead of a fearsome invading Saxon tribe from Germany.  Arthur and his companions must also deal with the uncertain loyalties of the local Celtic tribes.In spite of the non-traditional take on the Arthurian legends, this ends up being a decent action film.  Clive Owen plays a stoic Arthur, assisted by Ioan Giffud as Lancelot, and Kiera Knightley as an unexpected and attractive ally.

Did the writers forget this was set in the 5th century?  What made the scenes worse was just how wooden they were delivered by Clive Owen. I have not seen this actor in any other movie so can not comment whether he just had bad material or he was out of his depth.The early battle scenes were mind numbing.  Arthur and his 5 knights defeat the 100+ strong Woad army. Archers are hitting their mark perfectly from over 100 yards and the Knights fire back into the forest whilst at the gallop, never missing.Overall, it was watch-able, but not enjoyable.",2,"Watch-able, but not enjoyable",1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1193,"['am', 'what', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'treating', 'movie', 'kind', 'historical', 'fact', 'Just', 'new', 'opinion', 'published', 'based', 'few', 'records', 'artifacts', 'not', 'make', 'story', 'fact', 'could', 'even', 'justify', 'comments', 'real', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Setting', 'record', 'straight', 'one', 'sure', 'movie', 'just', 'taking', 'different', 'viewpoint.Even', 'taking', 'out', 'historical', 'issue', 'moment', 'struggled', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'constant', 'speeches', 'Arthur', 'life', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'British', 'way', 'oh', 'where', 'Americans', 'got', 'were', 'so', 'place', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'Did', 'writers', 'forget', 'was', 'set', '5th', 'century', 'What', 'made', 'scenes', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'wooden', 'were', 'delivered', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'actor', 'other', 'movie', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'material', 'was', 'depth.The', 'early', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'mind', 'numbing', 'Arthur', '5', 'knights', 'defeat', '100+', 'strong', 'Woad', 'army', 'Archers', 'are', 'hitting', 'mark', 'perfectly', '100', 'yards', 'Knights', 'fire', 'back', 'forest', 'whilst', 'gallop', 'never', 'missing.Overall', 'was', 'watch-able', 'not', 'enjoyable']",King Arthur
851437,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0002YLCFQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Note to my ""fans"": this is my edited previously published review. It's just that it's so good I know you deserve to see it here:Lord, how I hate these THIS-IS-THE-GOL-DARNED-ABSOLUTE-TRUE-STORY type deals.This dreadful clunker directed by Antoine Fuqua, a Chicago native like me, prods itself along horribly. Beginning with narration by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot) telling us all about Rome's manifest destiny delusion, and how it wanted all of Britain to go along, we are treated to a dubious map of Europe, showing us Rome and the region of ""Sarmatia"". This is vital, because most of Arthur's ""knights"" are supposedly ""Sarmatian"" conscripts here. Of course there was at the time no such place, and few historians know anything about Sarmatians.After the introductory Roman army scenes, we go to a little community of huts somewhere in England. A boy named ""Arturius"" (Arthur, misnamed because the correct Latin is ""Arcturus"") is about to be conscripted. They take him, after he says his goodbyes to his mother and foster father, a priest named Pelagius (based on the real heretic Father Pelagius of Scotland, he of the Arian heresy). Though he's a child, Arthur is already strong, handsome and ready to go. Asking the Roman officer how long he will be gone, he is told, ""Fifteen years."" DUH!It is sometime around 452 A.D. We don't really know, because the date is flashed on the screen at a weird time. All grown up, with his ""Sarmatian knights"" hard alongside, Arthur (Clive Owen) and the knights are awaiting freedom from Roman army conscription. The goofy Bishop Germanius (deliciously over-acted by Ivano Marescotti, based on the real Bishop Septimus) arrives, in full Roman battle gear, ready to deliver the conscripts' freedom papers. The knights, like the bishop, are a sketch.The stalwart round table fellows consist of Lancelot ( Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelson), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson). For all the personality these fellows should have, the only interesting one is Tristan, only because he is wearing Mongolian armor and wields a samurai/scimitar like a... well, like a samurai.The king had a Japanese samurai on the Round Table?The knights are cornered by the bishop for one last assignment, handed down directly by the pope: go beyond Hadrian's Wall and fetch a wayward Roman family. We do not know who the Romans are or why they're up there in the North...but this Roman's handsome son is a ""personal favorite"" of the pope's. They have to get those Romans outta there before the evil, lip-smacking Saxons run over them and eat them alive.Bitching and grumbling, the knights obediently prepare for what they are sure will be their slaughter. They obey only because Arthur asks them. So the ""quest"" begins. Arthur and his semi-retarded knights are being followed by the creepy ""Wodes"", a fictional people who serve no purpose. Actually, the Wodes are a vehicle for Merlin: he is their leader. The Wodes have waged war for decades, and they seem to be a mish-mash of Picts and Celts, so no wonder.At the Roman's villa, Arthur rescues a Wode woman who turns out to be Guenevere. Aside from her vampiric gyrations, we are treated to some mysterious language that is supposed to be Old English. Everyone speaks with Eurotrash accents, but the ""Wodes"" speak a gobbledy-gook Saxon language requiring subtitles! At least the bishop sounds Italian, but then, Marescotti is Italian.Merlin appears, well past the halfway mark in this 140-minute borefest. This guy is a must-see: wild-eyed, scruffy-looking, like a cross between a Neanderthal homeless guy and refugee from ""Clan of the Cave Bear"". He begs Arthur to come back (later, of course) to lead the Wodes into a new British era. Nothing comes of any of this, and Merlin, who gets a few seconds' screen time altogether, plays no further part in the story.Another character speaks insanely about the coming of Excalibur to Britain. It's a tragic loss: we never are told what the hell ""Excalibur"" is! Arthur ends up with NADA. The goose egg, my friends, not even a decent Roman villa for his hassles. Much less does he wind up king of anything--except B-movie flops, perhaps.The film is ultimately hilarious, and not just because it has a few clever, snappy bits. The battle scenes are a joke, the story arc is a muddied mess, the acting is dreadful and the lines are silly. Somehow, it's all so bad that it really does seem ""the true story"".Trouble is, this director obviously flunked every class he ever took in his life.

851440,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0002YLCFQ,Emily Todd,"[3, 17]","Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" manages to suck all of the magic, valor, and mystery out of the much-loved Arthurian legends.  What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that ""King Arthur"" has touted itself as ""the untold true story that inspired the legend"", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?This ""true story"" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.Horton: God help us. What are they?Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.

I originally had the theatrical which came from FILM on DVD.  This Director's cut seems to come from the HD Edited Original as this is obviously NOT shot on film and on an HD aspect it looks a little video and not film.  You can see pixilation and contrast on long shots of people.  You can see mixed contrast in many shots, especially the lighting on people and things.  Even if this is from a 24 frame video it does not look like film.  It's half film and half video.  Personally I find video hard to look at.  It looks somehow phony.  I'm just pointing this out to you.  Video is a soap opera, game show or nightly news.  Film is prime time TV and movies.  This is still a great film but you can almost see the original video that was shot and if this was put to Blue Ray it would look like it was shot on VIDEO.  Video has less contrast than film.  Film swirls while video doesn't.  This is still a great film, but if you object to video artifacts you might want to seek out the FILM based original version in DVD, possibly even Blue Ray.  So far I haven't seen anything ""super additional"" in the Director's cut than was in the theatrical.

To me, Jerry Bruckheimer represents everything wrong with most big budgeted films in Hollywood, all action and no substance. I didn't have much interest in seeing ""King Arthur"" over the summer but when I had the opportunity to review the unedited version on dvd, I thought to give ""King Arthur"" a chance. I'm glad I did. I found myself loving the film from the moment I saw a young Lancelot to the last scene.I didn't go into this film expecting the the film to be the truth but to be entertained instead so I wasn't expecting a history lesson. I definitely was entertained. The film begins with a young Lancelot being recruited by the Roman empire to serve in its military for fifteen years which was a common practice for British men during the era (at least in the film). Speed ahead fifteen years, Arthur and his fellow knights are just about to complete their indentured servitude to the Roman empire when they are given one last mission to rescue a young man destined to be a pop from the invading Saxon army. This final mission (which was not by choice) causes minor conflict for Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. During the course of the mission, Arthur encounters Guinevere and her brother and rescuses them along with the Romans before the Saxons could reach the castle.I enjoyed the performances by all the actors involved but I really thought Clive Owen as Arthur and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere really stood out for me. I liked the fact that Guinevere was by no means your atypical damsel in distress. She was just as much as a warrior as she was as a young woman. The battle scenes with the Saxons were visually spectacular. The costumes were great, especially King Arthur's armor which reminded me of Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"". What really made this film enjoyable for me is Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score and the gorgeous vocals of Moira Brennan. I loved the music.My only fault I could find ""King Arthur"" is that this film reminded me too much of either ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator"". I felt that this film was trying to be the big, epic dramas those films were. I thought the speech Clive Owen gives before he and his fellow knights go into their final battle with the Saxons was cheesy and sounded too much like the cheesy speech that Mel Gibson gives in ""Braveheart"".

The director, Antoine Fuqua, has essentially remade his previous film Tears of the Sun and couched it within the Arthurian legend. Hear Clive Owen plays the Bruce Willis role.The Good Stuff: If there ever was a King Arthur this is more in line with what historians think they know about him. His half Roman, half British blood line. His being a commander in the Roman Army, etc.  You also have Hadrian's Wall, the Roman rule, The Sarmatian horsemen, the local tribes who paint themselves blue and a host of other things. This is also a very thrilling movie. There's bravery, valor, great battle scenes, all for one and one for all and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear. What else is there?!The Bad Stuff: Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky.But the movie is cool. They take some of what we've been told about the legend and use those same components in a more natural way. Excaliber and the drawing of it from the stone (here it's his father's grave) are less magical and more real. The magic here comes from the earth itself. The forests, mountains, rivers and forests are all shot to give the land a personality of its own. A mysticism of its own. And did I mention Keir Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear? What else is there?!Fuqua does a nice job directing here. He seems to have keyed in on the Ridley Scott school of film making as this movie has a very sweeping quality to it. It's a big movie with a great look, a good musical score and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear.If you've seen the waaayyyy silly Excaliber you should like this miles better.",4,Works for Me,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1785,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'are', 'already', '500', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'again', 'probably', '6', '8th', 'time', 'really', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'essentially', 'remade', 'previous', 'film', 'Tears', 'Sun', 'couched', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'Hear', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'role.The', 'Good', 'Stuff', 'ever', 'was', 'King', 'Arthur', 'more', 'line', 'what', 'historians', 'think', 'know', 'half', 'Roman', 'half', 'British', 'blood', 'line', 'being', 'commander', 'Roman', 'Army', 'etc', 'also', 'have', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Roman', 'rule', 'Sarmatian', 'horsemen', 'local', 'tribes', 'who', 'paint', 'blue', 'host', 'other', 'things', 'also', 'very', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'bravery', 'valor', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'one', 'one', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'blue', 'paint', 'leather', 'battle', 'gear', 'What', 'else', 'there', 'Bad', 'Stuff', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'movie', 'cool', 'take', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'legend', 'use', 'same', 'components', 'more', 'natural', 'way', 'Excaliber', 'drawing', 'stone', 'here', 'father', 'grave', 'are', 'less', 'magical', 'more', 'real', 'magic', 'here', 'earth', 'forests', 'mountains', 'rivers', 'forests', 'are', 'shot', 'give', 'land', 'personality', 'own', 'mysticism', 'own', 'did', 'mention', 'Keir', 'Knightley', 'blue', 'paint', 'leather', 'battle', 'gear', 'What', 'else', 'there', 'Fuqua', 'nice', 'job', 'directing', 'here', 'have', 'keyed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'school', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'very', 'sweeping', 'quality', 'big', 'movie', 'great', 'look', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'blue', 'paint', 'leather', 'battle', 'gear.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'waaayyyy', 'silly', 'Excaliber', 'should', 'like', 'miles', 'better']",King Arthur

851447,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002YLCFQ,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 10]","I really wanted to love this film.  I have always been a fan of the Arthurian legends and stories; I've been a Clive Owen fan for years, and I've enjoyed many Jerry Bruckheimer films.  So what's not to love?The film tries to be historical, but not really, sort of in the manner of 'Gladiator'.  But it isn't 'Gladiator'.  It tries to be 'Braveheart' in tone and message.  But it isn't 'Braveheart'.  It tries to be a triumphant tale of the king.  But it isn't 'The Return of the King'.  True, the viewer will see elements of each of these films in the plot, the characters, the cinematography, the choreography - but it falls short of each of these other films in significant ways.One film this is deliberately not trying to be is 'Excalibur'. This is a demystified Arthur.  There is a Merlin, but his character is a Druid leader, devoid of any real supernatural powers; he is a shamanic figure, called a Dark Magician, but there's no magic here beyond the blue paint and mysteries-hiding-in-the-forest ways.  Arthur is a half-breed, Roman and British; this corresponds with what historians believe about early possible Arthurian figures - that he was a Romano-British leader at the time of the collapse of the Empire.  The knights in this tale are a complete invention - supposed conscripts from the Asian plains transplanted into Britain, they are under the leadership of Arthur along Hadrian's Wall (the northern border of England).  Fault number one occurs here - in a film trying hard to establish its this-really-happened credentials, Arthur should not be in the north.  Nor should the Saxons be invading in the north.  Nor should a principle Roman family be located on the undefended side of the wall.  Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, but these are too many in a row.I would give this picture three-and-one-half stars, but as whole numbers are required here, I will bump it up to a four-star-out-of-five picture on the whole.  The plot was plodding at times, but picks up near the end; too much reliance on battle scenes and not enough character development is done, particularly as the characters deviate from standard legends so much.  We care for Arthur, Guinevere and his knights, but somehow are left wondering why we do.  There's something missing here, and that's too bad.The round table is effective but only vaguely explained.  The knights' relationship to each other and to Arthur is very clear from the outset, but apart from the most general of relationships with the legendary figures, they bear little resemblance in terms of actual deeds.  Arthur is an idealistic Roman Christian who becomes disillusioned by the failures of people far away - one should look up the historical figure of Pelagius prior to attending the film, as the early Christian heretical controversies play a rather unexpected role here.  The sword-in-the-stone legend is explained in a very innovative fashion.The battle scenes are interesting if not entirely original.  The effects would be quite at home in films such as 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart', right down to the armour and the blue paint.  The sword play is very good in some parts, although 'Troy' had better choreography in this regard.  The one very effective battle scene was the battle on the ice lake, which is quite ingenious, if not entirely believable.One thing that is believable here are the character developments - not all the good guys live to see the end; not all the bad guys die or get their come-uppence, much like real life.  There is a happy ending of sorts, but of course history dictates that the Saxons would not in the end be held back; indeed, various invasions would continue until the time of the Normans.  Arthur's ideal in the film is one people united, ostensibly for liberty; of course, Arthur is declare king - at a time when constitutional monarchies did not exist, so much for the hope of liberty...The juxtaposition of church and empire on the one side and the locals on the other is a bit of a problem - the Saxons are invading, so that is bad; the Romans and the church institution are foreign implants into the land also, and they are bad (neither live up to their ideals in practice).  The message here is a rather xenophobic one, not too thinly veiled.Clive Owen puts in a very solid performance here, one of his best. Stellan Skarsgrd as the Saxon king is a bit overdone, but appropriate to the character.  Guinevere, portrayed by Keira Knightley, is a unique character, a native (Woad) who becomes the conscience of Arthur.  The love interest/affair between Guinevere  and Lancelot (portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd) is given a new and interesting twist, taking place entirely before the marriage of Arthur and Guinevere, with Merlin as the officiant of the ceremony.  Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is a shadowy figure who fights the Romans until the Saxons become an even worse enemy - then, the enemy of my enemy...; Dillane carries this role out admirably, largely by his presence more than by performance.The film was set on location in Ireland for the most part - undisturbed rolling hills are seen everywhere; primeval forests that make one think of Druid/Celtic/mystic influences.One thing I did love was the sound - I think I was more aware of the sound in this film than any other for quite some time.  From the arrows flying through the air, the horses pounding the ground, the swords clanking and the ice cracking, the sound really stood out as full and crisp, moreso than in similar films.  The music by Hans Zimmer is appropriate, but also somewhat derivative of other films like 'Gladiator' - the songs by Moya Brennan are (not surprisingly) hauntingly Celtic in tone.",4,The once-only

851448,A3DJ00DT9MJNI6,B0002YLCFQ,"Fr. Robert Miskell ""fr-rlt-miskell""","[30, 39]","As a grad student in medieval history, let me first say that this movie's announced intention seemed intriguing.  Then I saw the film.  My hopes for a decent, responsible historical revision were smashed by its crass attempt at appearing revolutionary, innovative, and important.The majority opinion is that Arthur, if he existed at all, was likely a Romanized Briton who fought against the slowly rising tide of Angle, Saxon, and Jute immigrants (many of whom were actually hired as mercenaries by the resident Britons to defend against Picts, etc.  He would more likely have lived toward the end of the fifth century, or the beginning of the sixth; the Roman legions evacuated around the beginning of the fifth century.Regarding the choice of Sarmatia (against one far-off vassal of Rome was as good as another), it makes no sense that the Roman Army would send such a small contingent so far afield from their origin, especially considering their utility against the Parthians.  It would have been logistically irresponsible.  Plus, Sarmatians would have fallen under the control of Constantinople; the Eastern emperors would likely not have sent useful auxillaries to the Western fringe, to their own military detriment.Most horrendously, the film makes a gross mockery of the Church.  While some might enjoy this, it is almost completely inaccurate, historically.  (1) The bishop is shown in a most disrespectful and inaccurate manner; clearly the director/producer wanted to take a hit at the Catholic clergy with this movie.  (2) Also, the Church did not resort to forced conversions, at least in the manner demonstrated in the film.  The Church had only a century before come around to accepting the justifiability of warfare and capital punishment when carried out by Christian rulers.  Torture didn't enter into accepted ecclesiastical practice until several centuries later, and then only in extreme inquisitorial cases.  Furthermore, the inquisitorial procedure, we know it, was only initiated in pursuit of heresy under Innocent III, who reigned from the end of the 1100's to early 1200's.  (3) The armies of the Roman Empire in the West did not serve the pope.  There were no such things as ""papal armies"" at this time.  There were odd, rare occasions that popes would lead defensive measures in the vicinity of Rome itself, but the popes did not send out pontifical armies to squash resistance, either political or doctrinal.  This is terribly anachronistic.  (4) Just as the popes did not have armies to enforce their will throughout the western half of the Empire, nor did they have the authority to make liberal, nepotistic land grants throughout the breadth of the Empire, as the movie portrays.  This would be a dangerous act for any pope to take, considering both the reigning emperors in Rome itself (last was deposed in 476, long after troops were pulled from Britain), and the reigning emperors in the East, who lasted until 1453.

851450,ANMFFCVZ3KM81,B0002YLCFQ,"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[1, 1]","Well, where do I begin? After viewing this film, I know exactly what was going through Jerry Bruckheimer's mind while producing it. With the huge successes of Gladiator and Braveheart, Bruckheimer was trying to capitalize on the gladiator genre film as well. This film has all the graphic violence, and horrific battle scenes required for this type genre film to succeed, with one small problem. Bruckheimer named the film ""King Arthur"", and though this film is many things, it's definitely NOT the tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table; however, there are knights, and there is a round table. It was a calculated risk, which backfired miserably at the box office. However, I really believe if the film was called anything else and the main characters renamed, this film would have performed much better.The film is your typical Jerry Bruckheimer film, which is beautifully shot and exquisitely scored. It has everything going for it, except it was marketed as the tale of King Arthur, which it isn't. The film could have stood on its own merit, but the ""King Arthur"" moniker is always on the mind of the audience; and with each ensuing scene that follows, the more the audience is dismayed by what they are viewing. Whoever wrote the script should be tarred and feathered, then boiled in oil.Anyways, if you leave all that behind you, this film can be enjoyed by disregarding its title and the names of the principle characters. If you view this film with no preconceived notions or knowledge of Arthur and his Knights, the film can be engaging.This film stars Clive Owen (possibly the new James Bond) as Arthur, and Keira Knightley as Guinevere (Not to be confused with Lady Guinevere, because this woman is anything but a lady!) The story revolves around the aftermath of the rise of the Roman Empire. The boys of the defeated Sarmatian cavalry have to serve fifteen years reparation in the Roman Army for their father's spared life. The film opens with Arthur and his knights coming to the ends of their fifteen years of service; however, they are force to complete one final mission in order to gain their freedom. The Roman allegiance is pulling out of England, all the while; the Saxon army is slowly enveloping Britain. The Knights' mission is to save a Roman Noble family in Northern England before the Saxon army attacks.As the story progresses, the knights and the Saxon head towards the film's climax and the movie's final battle. In which there is massive bloodshed, many dismemberments, and the final sword fight between our two central characters.All in all, if you can view this film with an open mind, enjoy what is being presented as entertainment and not history; this movie just might surprise you.[...]",3,Wait for the Video,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,2740,"['Well', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'viewing', 'film', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'mind', 'producing', 'huge', 'successes', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Bruckheimer', 'was', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'gladiator', 'genre', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'graphic', 'violence', 'horrific', 'battle', 'scenes', 'required', 'type', 'genre', 'film', 'succeed', 'one', 'small', 'problem', 'Bruckheimer', 'named', 'film', 'King', 'Arthur', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'tale', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'however', 'are', 'knights', 'round', 'table', 'was', 'calculated', 'risk', 'backfired', 'miserably', 'box', 'office', 'However', 'really', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'anything', 'else', 'main', 'characters', 'renamed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'performed', 'much', 'better.The', 'film', 'typical', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'exquisitely', 'scored', 'everything', 'going', 'was', 'marketed', 'tale', 'King', 'Arthur', ""n't"", 'film', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'own', 'merit', 'King', 'Arthur', 'moniker', 'always', 'mind', 'audience', 'ensuing', 'scene', 'more', 'audience', 'dismayed', 'what', 'are', 'viewing', 'wrote', 'script', 'should', 'be', 'tarred', 'feathered', 'then', 'boiled', 'oil.Anyways', 'leave', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'disregarding', 'title', 'names', 'principle', 'characters', 'view', 'film', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'knowledge', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'engaging.This', 'film', 'stars', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'possibly', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Arthur', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Guinevere', 'Not', 'be', 'confused', 'Lady', 'Guinevere', 'woman', 'anything', 'lady', 'story', 'aftermath', 'rise', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'boys', 'defeated', 'Sarmatian', 'cavalry', 'have', 'serve', 'fifteen', 'years', 'reparation', 'Roman', 'Army', 'father', 'spared', 'life', 'film', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'coming', 'ends', 'fifteen', 'years', 'service', 'however', 'are', 'force', 'complete', 'one', 'final', 'mission', 'order', 'gain', 'freedom', 'Roman', 'allegiance', 'pulling', 'England', 'while', 'Saxon', 'army', 'slowly', 'enveloping', 'Britain', 'Knights', 'mission', 'save', 'Roman', 'Noble', 'family', 'Northern', 'England', 'Saxon', 'army', 'attacks.As', 'story', 'knights', 'Saxon', 'head', 'film', 'climax', 'movie', 'final', 'battle', 'massive', 'bloodshed', 'many', 'dismemberments', 'final', 'sword', 'fight', 'two', 'central', 'characters.All', 'can', 'view', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'entertainment', 'not', 'history', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'surprise', 'you.', '[', ']']",King Arthur

With all said and done it simply a different perspective, but fans of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table should be open to a different take on the story.There was some things I liked about this and some things that I did not. The original story of King Arthur was indeed set before the Saxon invaders from Germany and Denmark succeeded in conquering Great Britain, and the Celtic peoples inhabited the island. As such the knights in shining armor often portrayed in Arthuric legend came considerably later in history. So I liked the idea of the costumes and weapons being closer to the age under portrayal.I am not sure that I liked the idea of the Knights being `Samartians', men imported by the Romans as mercenaries from somewhere around the Ukraine.  I don't believe there is any evidence for King Arthur and his men as being anything other than indigenous to Britain. I did however like the idea of Guinevere being a Pictish Princess - played by the dark and gorgeous Kiera Knightley. Though I thought it was silly not to have Merlin at Arthur's side as his trusted friend and advisor, and to rather have him as a sort of enemy of Arthur's.The setting where brilliantly done, it came together well, and the caste was good. I think that Clive Owen added some force to the role of Arthur, and Iiked the casting of his knights especially Ray Winston as the rough and ready Bors.The movie is entertaining and thrilling and comes together well, even if I did not like all of the way the story was written.It was better than First Knight , in my opinion, but not as good as Excalibur or Merlin.",3,A different take on King Arthur,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,1709,"['very', 'different', 'portrayal', 'King', 'Arthur', 'be', 'true', 'historical', 'portrayal', 'said', 'done', 'simply', 'different', 'perspective', 'fans', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'should', 'be', 'open', 'different', 'take', 'story.There', 'was', 'things', 'liked', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'indeed', 'set', 'Saxon', 'invaders', 'Germany', 'Denmark', 'succeeded', 'conquering', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Celtic', 'peoples', 'inhabited', 'island', 'such', 'knights', 'shining', 'armor', 'often', 'portrayed', 'Arthuric', 'legend', 'came', 'considerably', 'later', 'history', 'liked', 'idea', 'costumes', 'weapons', 'being', 'closer', 'age', 'portrayal.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'idea', 'Knights', 'being', 'Samartians', 'men', 'imported', 'Romans', 'mercenaries', 'somewhere', 'Ukraine', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'evidence', 'King', 'Arthur', 'men', 'being', 'anything', 'other', 'indigenous', 'Britain', 'did', 'however', 'idea', 'Guinevere', 'being', 'Pictish', 'Princess', 'played', 'dark', 'gorgeous', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'thought', 'was', 'silly', 'not', 'have', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'side', 'trusted', 'friend', 'advisor', 'rather', 'have', 'sort', 'enemy', ""Arthur's.The"", 'setting', 'where', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'came', 'together', 'well', 'caste', 'was', 'good', 'think', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'added', 'force', 'role', 'Arthur', 'Iiked', 'casting', 'knights', 'especially', 'Ray', 'Winston', 'rough', 'ready', 'Bors.The', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thrilling', 'together', 'well', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'written.It', 'was', 'better', 'First', 'Knight', 'opinion', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Excalibur', 'Merlin']",King Arthur

J.""","[4, 18]","I already knew from the History Channel and some BBC documentary that King Arthur's legend originated from a Roman-trained Briton in the Dark Ages who united his people and fought against the Anglo-Saxons.  His legendary heroics were passed down through generations by word of mouth until his tales were finally written down in the Middle Ages in the more mythical version we're familiar with today.I was interested in Antoine Fuqua's Dark Ages take of the original Arthurian archetype.  You were almost expecting it to be nearly historically accurate and thought-provoking the way Braveheart was.  Not convincing at all. The script was complete crap.  Predictable soldier comraderie talk.  Predictable lover's lines.  Predictable idealistic speeches on freedom.  I thought I was watching a soap opera. What a waste of brilliant  talent.  Background facts were confusing:  is Arthur a Briton, a Roman, a Sarmatian...an anything? What were his knights supposed to be doing anyway? And weren't there supposed to be 12 knights?Guinevere gets introduced to the story in an interesting way.  How did Arthur know she was there?  What made him decide to automatically look in that spot?  The story is not very tight either. Arthur doesn't seem so wise and all-knowing as we know him to be. He doesn't stand out from the rest of the knights in anyway other than the fact the he is their commander.The Anglo Saxon leader played by Stellan Skaarsgard was the only character I liked.

The result is less a visit to the Camelot of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere of the 15th Century than it is a heyday for the violence that conquering Rome imposed on the 'colonies' of its empire.Given the odd transplant, Fuqua has created a film that is over two hours long and is basically a series of seemingly endless fighting on the bloody battlefields of Briton.  The settings are dark yet magnificent (Ireland at its greenest) and the film is carried by the strong performances of Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd (please change that name!) as Lancelot, Keira Knightly as Guinevere, Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic the evil Saxon, and the famous Knights as played by Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, and Mads Mikkelson (though trying to identify  any of these actors under all the hair and grime is a task!).So it is a battle film and for that genre it is very fine - a good  popcorn movie for the cold nights ahead.  The featurettes on the DVD are not too additive, but the 'alternative ending' shows that Fuqua could have had a tighter film had that been chosen over the sappy one in the released version.

It is dreary (It looks like someone smeared motor oil over the lense), boring, and completely uninvolving.  It Antoine Fuqua's effort to tell the gritty, ""true"" story of Arthur and his Knights he has single-handedly sucked the magic out of the story.  Every scene is either in rain, fog, or darkness.  Everyone looks absolutely dreadful.  If this is ""gritty"", I prefer magical.  There is hardly anyone in the film to care about.  Clive Owen does his best, but cannot save this dreadful telling.  I prefer ""First Knight,"" which, while controversal (understandably) to Arthurian purists and the much buzzed about casting of Richard Gere as Lancelot, the movie shined.  Camelot has never looked so magical and sumptuous.  It looked like a place you would want to visit.  Sean Connery as King Arthur is genius.  Julia Ormond made the loveliest of all Guineveres.  Richard gere, while miscast, does a great job.  His kiss with Julia Ormond is one of the great screen kisses, intense, erotic, and passionate.  I will take magic and romance over the ""true"" story which is a complete bore.

As has been previously mentioned, it is no retelling of the myth as per Tom Malory, but really a loose retelling of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai in an Arthurian setting. There are seven Sarmatian Knights (Arthur, Bors, Lancelot, Gawaine, Dagonet, Tristan and Galahad) sent on a dangerous mission to rescue a Roman family from the Saxons and later help defeat the Saxon army at Badon Hill. The names of the knights do not reflect their mythic counterparts, but there are nods to some of them. Galahad is the Christian knight, Lancelot likes sleeping with other men's wives, Arthur is the idealistic leader. There are also fun nods to the mythic elements of the story, such as the sword in the stone, Merlin, the round table, as well.The villains are fun as well. Cerdic, the Saxon leader, seems to be suffering from terrible ennui for most of the story until he meets Arthur dace to face. ""Ah, finally a man worth killing!""The film looks a treat and GENERALLY appears accurate, with a few deliberate anachronisms. The stirrup debate rages on, as well as the crossbow argument, but the most noticable inaccuracy is the fantasy armour that the knights wear in the final battle. Personally, I love their look, but you won't find it in any history book, blending as it does the dark ages and 15th century harness.

(Lancelot's death, there is not any reference to the Holly Grail) , it subsists the epic spirit that supported the noblesse of these Knights.There are words that definitively can not be used in this Legend because it would deform seriously the dramatic effect and the whole transcendence: loyalty and honor. You may substitute by commitment and love, understood this last term as the supreme effort far beyond the prize. Loyalty and honor have sense by themselves after the French Revolution, or when the necessity and the established codes of power structures claim for them the presence of these concepts to guarantee the completion of the duty . The point to remark is the Knights support an ideal not an ideology. They have fought so hard all along fifteen years to obtain the expected freedom and just the last day  a new mission has come for them: so the loyalty and the word's completion by the religious authorities may be conceived such as another fine stratagem just to reach their goal.The loyal fighters do not agree but Arthur ' s leadership imposes finally.There is a cunning homage to Alexander Nevsky in the battlefield over the ice.

That sounded like a movie that I would really be interested in as I had done some reading on this subject and new none of it was likely.  I would love to know what historical evidence supports this movie.First off the screenplay writer defends his research with works by Linda Malcor.  Linda Malcor is highly regarded as a historical crackpot.  The Arthur she cites almost certainly lived 200-300 years prior to this movie's time frame.  The Arthur presented in this film is not plausible at all.What research did he use to have the Saxons invade from the north.  It is a historical absolute that the Saxon invasions came from the south and the east.  Why on earth would they come from the north when the Celts would have decimated them at that time?More credible historians using actual history believe that Arthur was a Welt or Brit chieftain who put together a small kingdom.  In fact they believe they may have excavated his original home.As for the religious depiction of this film it is shaky at best.  Although the Catholic Church was very corrupt, hence the reformation, it is highly unlikely that the corruption started this early in time.  This is more of a depiction of the Spanish Inquisition.Here are a few questions:How can a woman starved nearly to death with a badly broken hand shoot arrows and fight better than men twice her size?Why do all of Arthur's knights have Germanic names not Samatian names?Why does Arthur talk so much about freedom and non slavery when those concepts did not exist at that time and would not for a long long time?Why does Arthur become so chivalrous when that too would certainly not exist for several hundred years?Why do barbarians recognize signs of truce and not kill the only person that could possibly oppose them?This movie was awful.

851468,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B0002YLCFQ,Ian,"[1, 2]","Wow, instead of noble King Arthur wearing a crown sitting in a white castle amongst green fields, we have a roman general fighting braveheart like warriors in Britan.  Interesting eh?I never saw King Arthur in theaters, and I was not really interested in seeing it anyway.  When it came out on DVD I decided to take a look.Early on I was quite suprised with the movie.  It had an interesting start, and the early battles were interesting (if a bit long).  The scenery was gorgeous and the story was moving along quite well.  All seemed good and true, but after the halfway mark had passed, I actually began to loose interest in the movie.  Not even huge battles could really get my interest back.I think that the main problem with King Arthur is that it kind of goes on too long.  This being an unrated directors cut, there are apparently several minutes of battles and gore put back into the movie that were apparently cut out for the theatrical release.  To be honest, the new battle scenes dont really add much.  They also make the battle scenes go on and on to the point where a battle that should last at the most, five minnutes soon stretches out to ten minutes of non-stop chopping, hacking and slicing.  Well, it may not be ten minutes, but it felt that way.  When the final battle came on, it just kept going and going and going.  By the end of it I was actually bored!  I kept thinking, ""Come on, get it over with.""  Not a good sign.  At that point, I didint care about the heroes or if they would win or not.So in my opinion, the biggest problem with the movie is that the battle scenes need to be trimmed down.  From my experience in film classes, you need to keep a battle as short as possible instead of dragging it out.  It would also have helped to have some overhead shots showing all the soldiers fighting by the thousands.  Those would have really helped make the battles more interesting.Oh wait, theres the rest of the movie to review?  OK.  The scenery, props and costuming department really shine in this movie.  The scenery of Britan is absaloutly gorgeous, to the point where I'd like to take a vacation to visit some of the locales.  The costumes feel really authentic (well, except for the much talked about leather brassiere) and make the movie more believable.  I also must mention the great ice battle sequence, which was a refreshingly origianal take on ""How can seven guys hold off seven hundred guys?"".  The acting was on the whole, mediocre.  The only charachter I was really interested in was the main bad guy (who is never named in the movie), who spends most of his time killing people and frowning.Personaly, I found the idea for the film being set in roman times with Arthur as a Roman general to be fascinating.

The film's view is that the legends of King Arthur are based on a real man who did not live during the middle ages, as the legends state, but in the middle of the fifth century; also he wasn't an Englishman, but a Roman. The film tells us that around 450, when Rome was in decline, and England, which the Romans had conquered was being overrun by Saxons, the Romans kidnapped youngsters and forced them to serve in their army for fifteen years. One of these youngsters was Arthurius, known to us as Arthur. Arthur became quite adept at fighting and led a small group of about a half dozen men, including Lancelot and Tristan, who were devoted to him and whom he called his knights. As a final fight before releasing the band at the conclusion of their fifteen years, the Romans insisted that he fight against the Saxons. Arthur has no choice but to agree, and his band joins him. They encounter a group of English led by a man called Merlin, and his soldier Genevieve, and need to decide if they will work with Merlin's army. The film is filled with battle scenes.

But he does not really improve the fable. He adds the Romans, the Roman Legion, Hadrian's Wall, and the ""Roman"" origin of Arthur and his knights. But it cannot reach the sublime music Purcell had wrapped the tale in. So the film can only concentrate on horror. The Roman horror of slavery and forced Christianization, under the menace of dying in some dungeon where you will be buried alive. The horror of the Saxons who do not colonize people but only conquer the land and empty it completely of their inhabitants. And even the horror of the native Britons who are pagan and fierce fighters. This reduces Merlin to some kind of spiritual if not only war leader. Arthur will decide to fight against the Saxons, hence to fight with the Britons and then to Christianize them by marrying the girl he had saved from the Roman dungeons. Of course this film has nothing to do with history and it has no real depth about the real conflict between liberty and the future, between freedom and peace, or should I say rather war?

Also, myths and legends are often based on historical fact, and it is interesting to speculate what the historical fact might be.  The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't know if it is reinventing the myth or discovering the historical fact and it fails miserably at both.  First, if the legend of Arthur is based on historical fact, it is probably based on someone who live some time after the Romans withdrew from Britain.  There would have been no Romans left to rescue.  And the notion that Arthur was a Sarmatian warrior?  Frankly it's just too absurd to take seriously.  Moreover, not only is there is no reason to concoct this stuff, there is every reason not to.  The notion of Arthur and his knights being foreigners whose one desire (after they rescue the Romans) was to go home undermines the most important aspect of the Arthur myth--the idea that Arthur was fighting to defend his country, to establish a just government for his people.  As for the movie's reinventing myth...what can I say?  I can only groan. I even tried to keep an open mind about what they did to Guenevere.  After all, Celtic women really did fight alongside their men.  But I doubt that they wore the movie actress' ridiculous Hollywood getup. Worse, I detected nothing going on between either Arthur and Guenevere or Guenevere and Lancelot.  There seemed to be no passion between any of them.

851476,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0002YLCFQ,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[6, 9]","I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant ""King Arthur"" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved ""Brave Heart,"" ""Rob Roy"" was a good movie too, as was ""Gladiator."" Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons.

851477,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B0002YLCFQ,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 1]","I did a list on my facebook a while back about finding God in secular films and films people normally wouldn't think about. This was one of the films on the list for a real good reason. It seems to devastate the overall thought of King Arthur and recreates with archaeological evidence to make him who he was, a warrior just trying to get his quota of years-in-service so he can be a free man and JUST GO HOME! Problem: he finds out he and his remaining men (started out as twelve, now it's about half that) have one more, very dangerous, mission to do for the Bishop then they can go home. So much for freedom. From the start, those who prefer to use their religious statuses get blasted by everyone, whether or not they have a faith. Even King Arthur, who's a Roman Catholic warrior, yet has much more humility than is expected, and is more personal about it than the religion calls for. Even Lancelot, who all but says he's an atheist has a few good lines to use against those of religion and using that religion as an excuse to be severely sickly sadistic against those who are not Christian. Yep, that was Old Time Religion, all right.

851479,A2ZWTA18X37QOZ,B0002YLCFQ,"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX""","[1, 3]","**Spoilers ahead**Let me start by saying that I am not very familiar with Arthurian legend. I know that there was a King named Arthur, a sword named Excalibur, a Queen named Guinevere, a round table where the knights sit, and the wizard Merlin. However I don't know too much beyond that. Still, I think that King Arthur could have benefited more from the ""magic"" of the legends because it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other movie epics.Clive Owen does an adequate job of portraying a dark, brooding Arthur, a former Roman soldier. He cares about his fellow knights, and deplores the fact that he has to take them on a final journey that could have them killed, because Rome had previously promised that they could go free. Bors is great comic relief in this movie, especially when he made comment about one of his children named ""number 3"". The costume designs were well done. I loved the look of Arthur's Roman armour. And, of course, the battles scenes were of grand, sweeping scale, with hundreds of soldiers duking it out in choreographed fight scenes.So what's my problem with King Arthur? First off Guinevere, played by Keira Knightley, is a fairly one-dimensional character. We learn next to nothing about her other than that she is good with a bow. In this movie Knightley is nothing more than eye candy (albeit very nice eye candy). The character of Merlin is also just another military leader, and not a wizard. And just like Guinevere, we get to know nothing much about Merlin himself.Also, despite the fact that this movie strives for ""authenticity"", the heroes are given seemingly superhuman abilities. For example, in a battle across a frozen lake when Arthur and his knights confront a Saxon army, the Saxons try and shoot arrows against the knights but are out of range. But of course the knights are never out of range, and kill dozens of Saxons. One knight is also able to crack the entire frozen lake with his axe, with the crack encompassing a large part of the lake, with most of the Saxons standing on it. Is that authentic? Give me a break.The Saxon leader Cerdic is unimpressive as a villain. He does not inspire any real sense of fear or dread. In one scene, he says to kill everyone him and his armies encounter. One would think that he could take prisoners and use them as slave labour, but nope, the movie has make him want to kill everybody, which is frankly a cheap ploy in the movie's plot to make the audience hate him.Lastly, King Arthur borrows much from previous epics. So much so that it's as if they were working of some sort of ""How to Make an Epic Movie Cookbook"". Let's see, take one part brooding hero, add in a cheap love story, big battle scenes, evil-for-no-purpose villain, and a final scene where the hero MUST kill the villain on the battlefield, and you got yourself movie.Overall, King Arthur is not a bad movie, just an average one. Had I've not seen movies like The Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Ran, etc., I might have been more impressed. But for a movie that strives for historical accuracy as a selling point (which is in itself stupid considering we have no hard evidence Arthur even existed), this movie falls flat.I give King Arthur 6 out of 10.",3,A generic epic,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,3245,"['**Spoilers', 'ahead**Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'know', 'was', 'King', 'named', 'Arthur', 'sword', 'named', 'Excalibur', 'Queen', 'named', 'Guinevere', 'round', 'table', 'where', 'knights', 'sit', 'wizard', 'Merlin', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Still', 'think', 'King', 'Arthur', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'magic', 'legends', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'movie', 'epics.Clive', 'Owen', 'adequate', 'job', 'portraying', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Arthur', 'former', 'Roman', 'soldier', 'fellow', 'knights', 'fact', 'take', 'final', 'journey', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'Rome', 'had', 'previously', 'promised', 'could', 'go', 'free', 'Bors', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'made', 'comment', 'one', 'children', 'named', 'number', '3', 'costume', 'designs', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'loved', 'look', 'Arthur', 'Roman', 'armour', 'course', 'battles', 'scenes', 'were', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'scale', 'hundreds', 'soldiers', 'duking', 'out', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes.So', 'what', 'problem', 'King', 'Arthur', 'First', 'Guinevere', 'played', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'learn', 'next', 'nothing', 'other', 'good', 'bow', 'movie', 'Knightley', 'nothing', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'albeit', 'very', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'character', 'Merlin', 'also', 'just', 'military', 'leader', 'not', 'wizard', 'just', 'Guinevere', 'get', 'know', 'nothing', 'much', 'Merlin', 'himself.Also', 'fact', 'movie', 'authenticity', 'heroes', 'are', 'given', 'seemingly', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'example', 'battle', 'frozen', 'lake', 'when', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'confront', 'Saxon', 'army', 'Saxons', 'try', 'shoot', 'arrows', 'knights', 'are', 'range', 'course', 'knights', 'are', 'never', 'range', 'kill', 'dozens', 'Saxons', 'One', 'knight', 'also', 'able', 'crack', 'entire', 'frozen', 'lake', 'axe', 'crack', 'encompassing', 'large', 'part', 'lake', 'most', 'Saxons', 'standing', 'authentic', 'Give', 'break.The', 'Saxon', 'leader', 'Cerdic', 'unimpressive', 'villain', 'not', 'inspire', 'real', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'one', 'scene', 'kill', 'everyone', 'armies', 'encounter', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'take', 'prisoners', 'use', 'slave', 'labour', 'nope', 'movie', 'make', 'want', 'kill', 'everybody', 'frankly', 'cheap', 'ploy', 'movie', 'plot', 'make', 'audience', 'hate', 'him.Lastly', 'King', 'Arthur', 'much', 'previous', 'epics', 'So', 'much', 'were', 'working', 'sort', 'How', 'Make', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'Cookbook', 'Let', 'see', 'take', 'one', 'part', 'brooding', 'hero', 'add', 'cheap', 'love', 'story', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'evil-for-no-purpose', 'villain', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'hero', 'MUST', 'kill', 'villain', 'battlefield', 'got', 'movie.Overall', 'King', 'Arthur', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'average', 'one', 'Had', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'movies', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Ran', 'etc.', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'impressed', 'movie', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'selling', 'point', 'stupid', 'considering', 'have', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Arthur', 'even', 'existed', 'movie', 'flat.I', 'give', 'King', 'Arthur', '6', '10']",King Arthur

And the legend of King Arthur is probably one of them. At any rate, I couldn't find much point in this reworking of the Arthurian legend into a down-and-dirty, almost squalor-laden thing. Was it aimed at having some redeeming feature, that would in the end redeem the legend while giving it a supposedly more realistic biting edge along the way? Well, I failed to find any such redemption. What started out as a pointless debunking of romance remained noting more or less that that for me. Nor was it the kind or irreverent spoof of the story like Monty Python would have made. Without going either for laughs or ultimate redemption, it seems more like what BAD SANTA would have been if developed as drama rather than comedy. I don't think there would be any positive purpose to such a serious dragging of the Santa Claus legend through the mud. And this film finds similarly little purpose for such a take on the legend of King Arthur. And if the intent was realism, what is with some of the scenery? At times the cast wanders into icefields that look like some place much closer to the North Pole than to Britain (without imparting anything of a Santa Claus feeling, believe me!). What is with that?

851483,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B0002YLCFQ,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[5, 15]","What an awful, gore-filled movie. The romance and mystery of the Authurian legend is replaced by the mystery of how Guinevere kept clothed during battle. She only wears a few well placed leather straps. How can they claim historical accuracy and redefine Guinivere in this way? When we first meet G., her fingers are all out of joint and Arthur painfully puts them back. In less than a few hours, she is Robin Hood. Killing evil  Roman Christians and Saxons with a bow and arrow. She is almost starved to death and dehydrated by the Romans, but in less than a few days she's gripping swords, out dueling opponents three times her size and running half naked to battle. She has pretty impressive recuperative powers.The acting of Clive Owen is the only decent thing about the movie. He plays King Arthur in a nice understated way.An undefined ""Freedom"" becomes the highest good. Freedom replaces truth, justice, chivalry, and duty of the Arthurian legends. The movie investigates the idea of freedom, but never really defines it. True freedom is no boundaries, I think. The movie steals from Braveheart, The Patriot and the Lord of the Rings. The battle scenes go on way too long. There are several scenes of Merlin with the wind blowing through his long hair. It is less than impressive.I could go on, but why bother.I would add 1/2 star. After I wrote this review I saw a special on Bouddicca. She led a charge in England against the Romans. So the warrior princess idea is well-founded in fact.

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[7, 9]","Although the historical accuracy of this movie can be debated, as with everything, it should be noted that this is a much more realistic look at the historical possibilities that could have built the legend we all know and love.  Gone are the magic, the folklore and the love triangle infidelity that came with the fantasy tale of Excalibur.Now don't get too upset and think this is a disrespectful `re-imagining' like the Sean Connery/Richard Gere debacle of the mid 90s, First Knight.  Although that was a decent movie, it tore apart the fabric of what made the story great.  In this movie, Merlin is a soothsayer, a madman of sorts with a large following of nature worshipers.  You can see how this could kind of person could be seen as some sort of Wizard or magician.  If he says he caused the fog to roll in and all his people back him up, most people will believe it, and the legend will grow into a tale of fantasy.As with the love triangle with Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot; in this film it's done as a side note.  No wedding, no infidelity, no romance.  Just an obvious attraction between her and the two knights, obviously finding each of them appealing for different reasons.  The battles are intense and realistic, the cinematography and visuals of the landscapes are spectacular.  And the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is pounding and alive, probably one of the best he's done in years.The performances by the three lead actors is solid.  Great interactions with Arthur and Guinevere, proving once again that Clive Owen is highly underrated and Keira Knightly is one of the most talented young actresses of the day.  Ian Groffold does a fine job as well displaying a personality in Lancelot we have never really seen.

Add to that the increasing awareness that women probably fought alongside the men and you have a pretty good base for a story.(3)The writers of this film took all of this, managed to liken King Arthur and his knights to an ancient Special Forces team, and added in the very contemporary ""girls kicking [...]"" mentality of popular entertainment in the mold of Buffy and Sydney Bristow from ""Alias"".They came up with a fun film.

They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere.The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances. The battles are fantastic too. They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just given us the same story we've seen many times before but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warrior guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail.

Had it been labeled as fantasy and names and places changed, it would have been much better. It didn't really follow an Arthurian story. Core elements such as Guinevere's betrayal, Arthur's sister Morgan le Fay and their son Mordred and other characters are absent. If you're looking for a ""true"" Arthurian story, watch Excalibur or Mists of Avalon instead.Christians were actually a minority in the 5th century and even ""Christianized"" Britons would have held onto many pagan customs. Christians NEVER would have tortured pagans simply because they were outnumbered. Saxons didn't have a concept of racial supremacy and their intermingling with the Celtic/Roman natives is what made the ""English"" people and language.

I never  saw Clive Owen in anything before this and I must say he was great as Arthur. He has a strong screen presence that I was surprised by. Kiera Knightly is also really good as Guinevere. Kiera Knightly is gonna be a huge star. I think she was even better here than she was in Pirates of the Carribean. She's believable in tough women roles where she doesn't take crap from anyone. She's also very sensual and sexy, the camera loves her and she can act too. So yes she's going places.Sure there has been lots of King Arthur films but most of them focused on the same story. They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere.The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. The battles are fantastic too.  They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just gave us the same story we've seen many times before  but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warririor guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail.

Arthur- the Pelagian heretic later turned pagan. Guinevere- the Woad-covered, tattooed Pictish warrior princess.

However, as is normally the case with Arthurian films, I was disappointed. Not that this one didn't have it's good points, it just lacked in so many other areas. I think the realm of Arthurian literature is too daunting of a task to be done well in a mere two hours.This one dealt with the new historical assumption that Arthur was actually Arturias (something Like that), a Roman legionnaire assigned to the defense of Britain against the Picts (Scots) to the north. Ultimately Rome collapses and Arturias is left with the decision of whether or not to go home to Germania, or stay with his fellow Legionnaires and defend Britain from an impending Saxon invasion. This might have some basis in historical fact, as there is a 7th century document that refers to Arturias, as well as some achealogical evidence. However, this in of itself does not give credence to the legendary figure of Arthur. Regardless, these inconsistencies are acceptable because it is Hollywood, and therefor expected to tweak things for entertainment purposes.What I can not accept, however, were the glaring holes within the script, as well as the plot and character development. While there are several Knights, only Lancelot and Bors were adequately developed, the other were elluded to, but left without much more. The script was inconsistent, and could have used a great deal of rewriting. There were parts that dragged, when they could have been simplified and given mroe time to other parts of the movie. Even the battle sequences were uninspired, as they attempted to do too much with the whole, rather than master the parts. I guess I'm spoiled by what we've seen in Braveheart and Gladiator when it comes to epic medieval violence.This was an entertaining movie, but it just wasn't a must see. It felt like they rushed the production, I can't explain it better than that.

851497,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0002YLCFQ,Joe Sherry,"[5, 7]","A film by Antoine FuquaWhile the myth and legend of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table have been around in one form or another for centuries, there is little solid historical evidence that there was an actual King named Arthur or what his exploits may or may not have been, or even what century he may or may not have lived in.  The title cards at the start of the movie makes a new claim of accuracy with historical basis, but from watching documentaries on the History Channel before ""King Arthur"" was released theatrically, it seems that this movie offers one of many possible interpretations on the Arthur Legend.  No retelling of the legend is going to be completely accurate, assuming there was an Arthur, so take this movie with a grain of salt and as entertainment.Many of the other movies about Arthur deal with a magic sword being pulled out of a stone, and powerful magic being wielded by Merlin (John Boorman's ""Exaclibur""), and there is even a musical ""Camelot"", not to mention the rather bad but strangely enjoyable ""First Knight"".  Forget every other Arthurian movie that you have seen thus far because ""King Arthur"" is nothing like those movies.  There is no magic, no knights bursting into song, and no Richard Gere.  This is a darker, more realistic movie from the director of ""Training Day"".""King Arthur"" is set in the fifth century.  Rome is the de facto ruler of Britain, though via proxy.  Roman Knights hold sway in Britain, enforcing the law for Citizens and keeping the ""barbarians"" away.  In this movie, the Knights that are in Britain were originally from Sarmatia, a tribe far to the East.  These Sarmatians, having lost their battle against Rome have accepted as a term of their surrender that all of their male children will serve in the Roman Army.  These men are serving under Lucius Artorius Castus, or Arthur (Clive Owen).  Along with Arthur are the other ""legendary"" knights and Sarmatians Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), and Bors (Ray Winstone).  Together, with other unnamed knights, the Sarmatians protect their corner of Britain and their tour of duty will be over with the arrival of the Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti).  The Bishop has other ideas.  He will only release the knights after they fulfill one more task.  They must ride north, into territory occupied by the Woads (native Britons) where there is a Saxon Army on the brink of invasion, and rescue a young man whom the Pope in Rome is grooming as his successor.  Only then with Arthur and his men be free to return to Sarmatia.  They argue, the grumble, the get angry, and they submit.On the way they encounter Merlin (Stephen Dillane), no longer a sorcerer, but a leader of a tribe of Woads.  Upon rescuing the boy, Arthur also rescues a young woman named Guinevere (Keira Knightley).  Guinevere is not the refined princess who's beauty ruined Camelot, but a Woad prisoner who is starving and abused.  She is freed by Arthur, befriended even though she is a barbarian, and through their discussions Arthur begins to question his place as a Roman.  Arthur is part Briton, part Sarmatian, so his world is not the same as that of Bors or Lancelot.  Guinevere also is a warrior, able to shoot her bow with great skill and once, late in the movie, she charges into battle with sword drawn (her scenes with the swords are the least convincing when she tries to match power and strength with men.  Keira Knightley is a small woman).The battle scenes are done more in the style of ""Braveheart"", though with a surprisingly lack of blood and visible brutality.  Clive Owen's Arthur is a solid leader, though one lacking in charisma.  He seems the leader who has earned the trust of his men over a long period of time by being a strong warrior, brave, intelligent, and always faithful, but not with this force of his personality.  That is good for a leader, bad for a leading man.  Owen was fantastic in ""Closer"", but his powerful personality is pushed to the side here.  Everybody else in the movie is acceptable and believable in their roles, and Keira Knightley was just fine as a different sort of Guinevere right up until the part where she parried a sword swung by a much larger man.  She was best when using the bow and when using her agility in battle.  She lost me when she used strength to win in battle.This Director's Cut Edition restored scenes that needed to be cut from the theatrical release and reportedly adds a bit more brutality to the battles.  This was evident near the end, but not so much early on in the movie.  Not having seen the theatrical release, I am not able to comment on the differences between the two versions of ""King Arthur"".This isn't a bad movie.

851502,ANRD10YW616JL,B0002YLCFQ,Joseph Guyer,"[2, 6]","Since high school I had been wishing for a film like this: a quasi-historical, Geoffrey of Monmouth-inspired King Arthur.  I was tired of films like the awful, embarassing First Knight. After seeing Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy (something else that's always been on my wish list), I was even more excited of the prosepct of an Arthur film that approached the centuries' worth of material seriously and intelligently, without falling back on old cliches. Call it a dork's fantasy.In some respects, King Arthur fulfills my needs. It has several esoteric references designed, I assume, specifically for die hard Arthur fans, like the replica of Stonehenge at the end. The prophet Merlin, according to Geoffery of Monmouth, was responsible for Stonehenge. He brought it back from what is now Ireland and erected it in the fields of Salisbury to commemorate the British who fell against the Saxons. I also enjoyed seeing the clashing of cultures among the Romans, Picts, and Saxons. This asked a lot from the audience, some of whom were likely to get confused: ""Now who're the bad guys? Those guys? Wait, who are those Braveheart guys, and why are they fighting the Gladiator guys? HELP!""Ultimately, however, the film is disappointing because of the lack of characterization, lack of suspense, poor acting, weak dialogue, and slow pacing.As far as characterization goes, these legendary and literary gods have been reduced to mere cookie cutter carbon copies. Not much distinction among the knights. The only memorable one was Sir Bors, which is a little confusing since the film opens on Lancelot as a child and then quickly abandons him. You never get to know any of them and therefore do not sympathize with them. None of them show fear or, for that matter, any other human-like emotions. Clive Owens' facial expressions range from frown #1 to frown #2, the only difference between them being the former is shot from his left profile and the latter from his right.The Saxon villian is a typical baddie who speaks in a method-y gruff tone of voice, and in case some audience members are still unsure who the main bad guy is, he is shot amidst atmospheric lighting, moody smoke, and muddy locales. His henchmen look like tatoo-parlor clientele, and the main Saxon and his son continually have these lame little moments of power struggle to build false suspense and false depth of character.The film tries to be suspenseful on several occasions but fails. The problem is that the film never establishes that the Saxons are truly a threat. There's lots of talk that they're dangerous, but we don't see it. They sack only two villages, one of which had nobody there to defend it. The two battles in which Arhur's knights confront them are lame and a poor excuse to show a little action. The skirmish on the ice has some clever underwater photography, I must admit.The film also tries to evoke the spirit of heroics and courage and selflessness but instead ends up lampooning itself. For example, the music swells, the brass belts out the Arthur theme, and the knights' swords shimmer in slow motion as someone roars out: ""RRRAAAAGGGGHHH!""Scene like this, and the movie as a whole, are intended to make the hair on your arms stand up. I love it when movies make my arm hair jump up as if in shock, but alas, during King Arthur, even my arm hair was bored.",3,"[Shrugs shoulders] ""Meh . . .

851503,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0002YLCFQ,Joseph Haschka,"[21, 23]","The King Arthur legend, burgeoning from Geoffrey of Monmouth's HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN (12th century) and Thomas Malory's LE MORT DE ARTHUR (15th century), has taken on a life of it own so embellished as to obscure the meager facts known about the 5th century Briton that made an enduring name for himself ostensibly battling the invasion of Germanic tribes. Historians don't even know what part of Britain Arthur hailed from, being variously assigned to Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland. And there's no contemporary historical evidence that he was a king at all. King Arthur has been, and will remain, a conveniently blank page on which Hollywood scriptwriters can pen just about any story they want so long as it includes lots of swordplay, male bonding between noble knights, and a Hot Babe (Guinevere).In this screen version, Clive Owen plays Arthur, a half-Roman, half-British cavalry commander stationed on Hadrian's Wall at the time the Big House back in Italy decides to abandon the province to the barbarians. The traditional knights of Arthur's Round Table - Lancelot, Bors, Gawain, et al - are Sarmatian warriors at the end of a 15-year conscription into the Roman occupation army. (Sarmatia was an ancient territory way over by the Caspian Sea.) Before gaining possession of their demob papers after years of fighting local Briton insurgents, the knights must accompany Arthur on one last mission, i.e., to rescue a patrician Roman family living north of the Wall whose villa is about to be overrun by an inconvenient horde of Saxon invaders.This KING ARTHUR is refreshing in that it abandons the silliness of the otherwise excellent EXCALIBUR (1981) which played along with the traditional misconceptions regarding elaborate castle architecture and personal fighting armor that actually didn't arrive in the British Isles for centuries. Here, Arthur isn't even a king, at least until the conclusion. And Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is a pagan Druid found chained-up by Arthur in the cellar torture chamber of the Roman aristocrat, a Christian, that Arthur is sent to rescue. The film's creators take this opportunity to take a swipe at the infant Roman (Catholic) Church by making Guinevere's jailers mad monks. Once released, Knightley's character is either muddy or daubed with Druidic war paint, and dressed in shoulder or midriff-baring costumes totally unsuitable for the cold, snowy weather. No frumpy animal skins for her!The generally cheesy dialogue and standard battle sequences make this a three-star film, but which I'm elevating to four in consideration of the costuming, however unrealistic, the gorgeous Irish exterior sets, and the occasionally engaging performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Ray Winstone as Lancelot and Bors respectively. Owen is suitably dark and rugged as the driven, charismatic Arthur. And he cuts a fine figure against the skyline mounted on his steed with breastplate, plumed helmet, and streaming cavalry standard. Keira's Guinevere isn't much more than eye candy, though she wields a mean bow and arrow.If I had to choose between KING ARTHUR and the previously mentioned EXCALIBUR, I'd have to go with the latter, a visually stunning piece of filmmaking up in the five-star category that features superb performances by Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicole Williamson as Merlin, and Helen Mirren as Morgana, plus a soundtrack to knock your socks off.",4,Guinevere risks frostbite,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,3399,"['King', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'burgeoning', 'Geoffrey', 'Monmouth', 'HISTORY', 'THE', 'KINGS', 'OF', 'BRITAIN', '12th', 'century', 'Thomas', 'Malory', 'LE', 'MORT', 'DE', 'ARTHUR', '15th', 'century', 'taken', 'life', 'own', 'so', 'embellished', 'obscure', 'meager', 'known', '5th', 'century', 'Briton', 'made', 'enduring', 'name', 'ostensibly', 'battling', 'invasion', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'Historians', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'part', 'Britain', 'Arthur', 'hailed', 'being', 'variously', 'assigned', 'Cornwall', 'Wales', 'Scotland', 'contemporary', 'historical', 'evidence', 'was', 'king', 'King', 'Arthur', 'been', 'will', 'remain', 'conveniently', 'blank', 'page', 'Hollywood', 'scriptwriters', 'can', 'pen', 'just', 'story', 'want', 'so', 'long', 'lots', 'swordplay', 'male', 'bonding', 'noble', 'knights', 'Hot', 'Babe', 'Guinevere', '.In', 'screen', 'version', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Arthur', 'half-Roman', 'half-British', 'cavalry', 'commander', 'stationed', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'time', 'Big', 'House', 'back', 'Italy', 'abandon', 'province', 'barbarians', 'traditional', 'knights', 'Arthur', 'Round', 'Table', 'Lancelot', 'Bors', 'Gawain', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'Sarmatian', 'warriors', 'end', '15-year', 'conscription', 'Roman', 'occupation', 'army', 'Sarmatia', 'was', 'ancient', 'territory', 'way', 'Caspian', 'Sea', 'gaining', 'possession', 'demob', 'papers', 'years', 'fighting', 'local', 'Briton', 'insurgents', 'knights', 'must', 'accompany', 'Arthur', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'i.e.', 'rescue', 'patrician', 'Roman', 'family', 'living', 'north', 'Wall', 'villa', 'be', 'overrun', 'inconvenient', 'horde', 'Saxon', 'invaders.This', 'KING', 'ARTHUR', 'refreshing', 'silliness', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'EXCALIBUR', '1981', 'played', 'traditional', 'misconceptions', 'regarding', 'elaborate', 'castle', 'architecture', 'personal', 'fighting', 'armor', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'British', 'Isles', 'centuries', 'Here', 'Arthur', ""n't"", 'even', 'king', 'least', 'conclusion', 'Guinevere', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'pagan', 'Druid', 'found', 'chained-up', 'Arthur', 'cellar', 'torture', 'chamber', 'Roman', 'aristocrat', 'Christian', 'Arthur', 'sent', 'rescue', 'film', 'creators', 'take', 'opportunity', 'take', 'swipe', 'infant', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'making', 'Guinevere', 'jailers', 'mad', 'monks', 'Once', 'released', 'Knightley', 'character', 'muddy', 'daubed', 'Druidic', 'war', 'paint', 'dressed', 'shoulder', 'midriff-baring', 'costumes', 'totally', 'unsuitable', 'cold', 'snowy', 'weather', 'frumpy', 'animal', 'skins', 'generally', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'standard', 'battle', 'sequences', 'make', 'three-star', 'film', ""'m"", 'elevating', 'four', 'consideration', 'costuming', 'however', 'unrealistic', 'gorgeous', 'Irish', 'exterior', 'sets', 'occasionally', 'engaging', 'performances', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Lancelot', 'Bors', 'respectively', 'Owen', 'suitably', 'dark', 'rugged', 'driven', 'charismatic', 'Arthur', 'fine', 'figure', 'skyline', 'mounted', 'steed', 'breastplate', 'plumed', 'helmet', 'streaming', 'cavalry', 'standard', 'Keira', 'Guinevere', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'mean', 'bow', 'arrow.If', 'had', 'choose', 'KING', 'ARTHUR', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'EXCALIBUR', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'latter', 'visually', 'stunning', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'up', 'five-star', 'category', 'superb', 'performances', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'Arthur', 'Nicole', 'Williamson', 'Merlin', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Morgana', 'soundtrack', 'knock', 'socks', 'off']",King Arthur

I remember when this movie came out, The History Channel did a tie-in documentary about the real-life candidates for the historical Arthur.  I highly recommend watching that documentary over this film.  Even though the producers of this film sponsored that documentary, they do not appear to have watched it.  The insulting thing is that the film begins with a title card telling us that ""archeological evidence"" tells us that this is what really happened.  Uh-uh.Why make this film?  They took everything that we love about the Arthur legend and discarded it and then they took everything we love about history and discarded it.  Well, you might say, that has nothing to do with anything - judge the film on its own merits.  Well, OK - it's ENDLESS.  The story they invented is boring, the dialogue is inane, and it exemplifies everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  This is just another film off the assembly-line.  The higher-ups at the studio probably wanted to cash in on Lord of the Rings and all the other historical epics that have come out recently so they made a cookie-cutter movie of their own.

This Arthur is no gentle scholar, but a skilled Roman soldier. The story begins with an explanation about how Rome required the young men from their conquered countries to spend fifteen years, in service, as a soldier in the Roman army. After that time, they were free to go where they pleased.In this film, Arthur is presented as a great knight and the leader of a band of very skilled soldiers.  His men, including Galahad and Lancelot, are all seasoned warriors and have fulfilled their duty to Rome. Just before they leave the army, they are advised that the Saxons are invading Roman territory and they are needed.  They are all battle weary, but forced to take up their weapons and go on one last mission.Guinever is of course beautiful, and in this story, a capable warrior. One part was pure Hollywood, where during a battle scene, King Arthur and his knights are completely covered in armor and Guinever goes into battle with them wearing body paint and skimpy clothes.

I am positive the latter was not. One would be harder pressed to find a more ahistorical, awkward, forced and unintentionally funny historical romp anywhere. And the fact the film takes itself so seriously simply adds to the already bountiful mirth.As any kid who has answered a test question based on watching Mel Gibson's The Patriot has certainly learned, movies and historical accuracy are not friends. Not friends at all. Yet King Arthur wears its 'we are being historical here that is why everything is so muddy' heart on its sleeve.As if to multiply the historical missteps, the Arthurian legend is often awkwardly forced into the story line at strange places. As a result you have Osama bin Merlin head of what I'm guessing is the Picts. (They are called the Woats but of course there is no such thing. They do wear blue battle paint, which is historically accurate if you are doing a film about Scottish warriors. Scottish warriors attending a football match in the 1970's mind you.) Guinevere is now a leather bikini-wearing archer, and Arthur is a Roman commander fighting the Blue Meanies (after-mentioned Woats) of the north.The Saxons show up out of nowhere and try to kill everybody. So now in that timeworn movie clich&eacute; the two former enemies (Arthur of the Romans and Merlin of the Blue Meanies) have to combine forces to defeat the new evil Saxons.A lot of clich&eacute;s are evident in King Arthur. The worst is the screeching about freedom in what seems to be every fourth sentence of the screenplay. It's irritatingly repetitive, ridiculous (Arthur doesn't become President Arthur after all or as Monty Python put it ""How did you become king anyway I didn't vote for you"") and it leads to one of the unintentionally funniest scenes ever in a major motion picture release. (As King Arthur gives an almost word for word homage to Mel Gibson's stirring Braveheart battle speech the camera pans back and instead of revealing an army of thousands it has five lone guys. They might as well have been holding coconuts.)Yet despite all this and an ending that reminds one of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, I actually enjoyed myself. The battle scenes were pretty well done despite the PG-13, the acting is okay and Kiera Knightly did prance around in a leather bikini for most of the film.Like the movie Troy, the flaws of this film add a humorous dimension to the proceedings.And don't forget we fight for FREEDOM from the unrepresentative Republic of which I am a commanding officer so we can create an absolute monarchy with a round table.I am telling you if this movie was called Bob the Roman guy it would have been a lot better.",3,King Arthur...

851513,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0002YLCFQ,Kaya Savas,"[1, 2]","MOVIE: A film that could have been a lot more interesting if the approach was better.  Here we have the true story of King Arthur who fought for Rome and Britian, a man who wanted nothing more than freedom for his men.  Sound familiar?  It should, because the whole freedom thing has been done too many times, but that's not what makes this potential epic a dud.  Also this claims to be thr true untold story of King Arthur, when in reality the historical accuracy is rather poor.  The movie doesn't go into detail about what the heck is going on during these such as Braveheart did. I found the acting and the set design to hurt this movie the most.  The battle scenes were incredible in my opinion, and I thought they were well done.  The ice scene is nice, and the ending battle through the smoke was incredible, but it was the acting and the sets that hurt the movie the most.  Clive Owen and Kiera Nightley did fine jobs, but the rest of the cast was horrible.  The acting was so stiff and wooden, it just felt too tense.  I found myself wanting the actors to stop trying to act and just let it flow, but that didn't happen.  Then comes the set design, everything looked so fake and that brought down the effect.  The armour looked like plastic, and some of the costumes looked like something out of a high school play.  Even the wall that was built to keep the woads and saxons out looked cheaply done.  The colors on some of the costumes were way too bright, and that was in contrast to the dreary, foggy, green landscape of the location.  By having these bright shiny knights riding through the foggy green fields it makes the costumes and landscape look fake.  Everything had the look of something brand new and not gritty, rusty, or blood soaked.  Otherwise this movie could have been amazing, but now it's just enjoyable.  If Hans Zimmer didn't compose the score I probably would have not found this movie so exciting, but his thrilling score is what makes it enjoyable.VIDEO: The unrated disc comes in a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and it is decent.  The colors come out nicely even though that is the downside of the movie.  But the snow scenes are a visual feast for HDTV owners.AUDIO:  The Dolby 5.1 mix is clear and crisp but rather weak in my opinion.  Nothing exceptional except for the ice battle and the smoke battle at the end.PACKAGING / EXTRAS:  The single unrated disc comes in an armary case with snap latches on the side identical to many Universal releases (We get rid of WB snapper cases, now we get these, ugh).  The case also has a cardboard slipcase, which has no purpose whatsoever except to attract attention of the consumer as they wander through the DVD aisles of their local stores. This unrated edition has 13 minutes of added footage, which basically makes the battle scenes more violent. The extras are pretty basic.  You get a 17 minute making of featurette, and I was happy to see that they gave Hans Zimmer a little screen time in discussing the score, unlike in Tears of the Sun, where he got none.  Then there is a 15 minute discussion that includes Bruckheimer, Fuqua, Owen, Knightley, and some other actors.  I thought it was pretty good, but it also seemed like fluff.  There is an alternate ending that was cut due it not being recieved with open arms from test screenings.  For XBOX owners you have a playable demo of the King Arthur game, and to top it off there is a feature that pops up fun facts of the production as you watch the movie.

I live in the San Francisco Bay area, and so it was a somewhat sophisticated audience that doesn't react that way very often.The film is not as dark as portrayed in the professional reviews that I have read--they all say that it's gloomy. Well, frankly, the latest Harry Potter movie was a lot more gloomy (and I am a HP fan). This film had some issues but within it's premise was fairly consistant...very few of those moments when things got so bad that I felt like saying something like, ""you've got to be kidding me!"" to the director and writers. That is seldom true for me these days in films. It did have a few moments with bad dialogue-- and unfortunately most of the time with Ms. Knightley's lines (and problems about her costumes!). But the characters and actors were engaging, you cared what happened to them, and I really liked the fact that all of the knights had their own distinct personalities. The battles were involving enough to sustain the story for me, and I am not a big action fan and can get bored with such things, so that was a surprise. I liked this movie, and unlike several (including Troy) that I have seen this summer, I didn't feel like a had just paid to waste 2 hours of my life.

Yes, it's rather smaller in scale than some of the bloated epics of late, but it has good production values, terrific action scenes, manages a unique spin on the legend (one that's supported by the current train of Arthurian scholarship), and affords Stellen Skarsgaard his best opportunity yet to give us his much-admired Marlon Brando impression as the hairy villain.

Sure, we can all haggle over history (or legend, as the case may be) but what this film boils down to is that it is an action yarn that's littered with historical and legendary tidbits about one of the greatest legends of our time, King Arthur.  Clive Owen takes up Excalibur as our hero this time, and he leads a group of Samatian knights against the Woads and then the Saxons to set his people free.  Galahad, Tristan, Gawain and others ride with Arthur and face death with not even the slightest bit of fear.  In this version, Guinevere and Lancelot only flirt for a minute, so don't expect the love triangle that was key to so many of the other versions of this great epic.The cast is excellent, including Ioann Gruffudd (Fantastic Four, Horatio Hornblower), Hugh Dancy (Ella Enchanted, Blood and Chocolate), Ray Stephenson (HBO's ""Rome""), Ray Winstone (Cold Mountain, Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgard (Deep Blue Sea, Amistad, Pirates of the Caribbean), and Til Schweiger (SLC Punk!, Joe and Max).  Fans of Jerry Bruckheimer productions will notice plenty of the actors involved in this film.  The music, by Hans Zimmer, is some of his most epic yet.Director Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job of melding plot and action in this tale.  Writer David Franzoni litters the story with just enough legend to remind you that Arthur may or may not have been just that.  Some of the characters, especially knights such as Tristan, Dagonet and Bors, are given lighter treatment than you'd expect, but maybe that's why this tale is called ""King Arthur"" and not ""Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.""The DVD is very nice.  It features two very informative mini-documentaries on the making of the film.  The first is ""Blood On The Land"" which gives you an inside look at the making of the film.  The other is ""Round Table,"" which features a literal round table with some of the cast and key members of the production.  There's also the optional ""Knight Vision,"" which offers all sorts of trivia about the actual time and place these events might have taken place in.Granted, historians and armchair historians will argue over this film's accuracy until the cows come home.  In the end, though, this film is nothing more than an epic along the lines of ""Gladiator.""  I highly recommend ""King Arthur"" as well as two other Arthurian films, those being ""Excalibur"" and the musical ""Camelot.""",4,When Legend And History Collide,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2418,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Sure', 'can', 'haggle', 'history', 'legend', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'film', 'down', 'action', 'yarn', 'littered', 'historical', 'legendary', 'tidbits', 'one', 'greatest', 'legends', 'time', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'up', 'Excalibur', 'hero', 'time', 'group', 'Samatian', 'knights', 'Woads', 'then', 'Saxons', 'set', 'people', 'free', 'Galahad', 'Tristan', 'Gawain', 'others', 'ride', 'Arthur', 'face', 'death', 'not', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'fear', 'version', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'only', 'minute', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'love', 'triangle', 'was', 'key', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'versions', 'great', 'epic.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'including', 'Ioann', 'Gruffudd', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', 'Ray', 'Stephenson', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Beowulf', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Amistad', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'Joe', 'Max', 'Fans', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'productions', 'will', 'notice', 'plenty', 'actors', 'involved', 'film', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'most', 'epic', 'yet.Director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'excellent', 'job', 'melding', 'plot', 'action', 'tale', 'Writer', 'David', 'Franzoni', 'story', 'just', 'enough', 'legend', 'remind', 'Arthur', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'characters', 'especially', 'knights', 'such', 'Tristan', 'Dagonet', 'Bors', 'are', 'given', 'lighter', 'treatment', ""'d"", 'expect', 'maybe', 'why', 'tale', 'called', 'King', 'Arthur', 'not', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'two', 'very', 'informative', 'mini-documentaries', 'making', 'film', 'first', 'Blood', 'Land', 'inside', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'other', 'Round', 'Table', 'literal', 'round', 'table', 'cast', 'key', 'members', 'production', 'also', 'optional', 'Knight', 'Vision', 'sorts', 'trivia', 'actual', 'time', 'place', 'events', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'in.Granted', 'historians', 'armchair', 'historians', 'will', 'argue', 'film', 'accuracy', 'cows', 'come', 'home', 'end', 'though', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'epic', 'lines', 'Gladiator', 'highly', 'recommend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'other', 'Arthurian', 'films', 'being', 'Excalibur', 'musical', 'Camelot']",King Arthur
851517,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002YLCFQ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 5]","King Arthur opens with a statement that declares that this is based on the truth behind the legendary myths surrounding the tales of King Arthur and his knights.  This is a bold statement, in fact, it is bold enough to bring the tale to its ruin before the film has even begun, as most people consider it folklore and fairy tales.  It seems as if the purpose is to draw the audience's attention to the story with a false statement and declare it to be the truth in an attempt to falsely advertise.  Those who are educated in the matters know better, but those who do not might not.  The falsehood of the tale is upsetting, as it could very well one day serve a similar purpose for some who want to change the view of history.Antoine Fuqua's version takes place moments before the Romans withdrew their troops from Great Britain as the Saxon's were invading from the north, and the Britons where raiding convoys.  The Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), who is not a wizard, but a tattooed leader of the poor Britons that fights a war with Guerilla warfare.  When the Saxon's approach from the north, Merlin decides that joining forces with Arthur against the Saxons is the best solution, as Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights are sent to rescue a couple of Roman's.Arthur arrives to the Roman camp and he discovers that the people have been unjustly treated and in anger he responds by freeing those who have been unjustly treated in the name of God.  It is, however, extremely strange that he has never seen any unjust treatment of people prior to his visit to the Roman camp.  Consequently, the escape away from the approaching Saxons begins, which is very similar to Fuqua's Tears of the Sun (2003) where a group of Navy Seals disobey order by helping local populations from genocide.  The story continues with brave warrior's fighting for just causes, as they fight for a higher cause -- freedom.The original tale of Sir Arthur and his knights brings the audience wisdom and valuable lessons, which would be seemingly fitting for the time when the story took place.  Nevertheless, King Arthur seems like a parody in the way the knights tackle political issues in a way only contemporary heroes do in films.  Despite the awkwardness in the film, King Arthur offers some valuable lessons in what could only be a self-righteous attempt in recreating a frequently told tale, which is displayed through the vibrant colors of Ireland and grand war scenes that only shadow Gibson's Braveheart (1995).  In the end, King Arthur offers an awkward cinematic experience with some lessons, but overall leaves the audience with a disappointing experience.",2,Does Not Deliver Bold Statement...,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,2655,"['King', 'Arthur', 'statement', 'based', 'truth', 'legendary', 'myths', 'surrounding', 'tales', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'bold', 'statement', 'fact', 'bold', 'enough', 'bring', 'tale', 'ruin', 'film', 'even', 'begun', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'folklore', 'fairy', 'tales', 'purpose', 'draw', 'audience', 'attention', 'story', 'false', 'statement', 'declare', 'be', 'truth', 'attempt', 'falsely', 'advertise', 'who', 'are', 'educated', 'matters', 'know', 'better', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'might', 'not', 'falsehood', 'tale', 'upsetting', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'day', 'serve', 'similar', 'purpose', 'who', 'want', 'change', 'view', 'history.Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'version', 'place', 'moments', 'Romans', 'withdrew', 'troops', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Saxon', 'were', 'invading', 'north', 'Britons', 'where', 'raiding', 'convoys', 'Britons', 'are', 'led', 'Merlin', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'who', 'not', 'wizard', 'tattooed', 'leader', 'poor', 'Britons', 'fights', 'war', 'Guerilla', 'warfare', 'When', 'Saxon', 'approach', 'north', 'Merlin', 'joining', 'forces', 'Arthur', 'Saxons', 'best', 'solution', 'Arthur', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'knights', 'are', 'sent', 'rescue', 'couple', ""Roman's.Arthur"", 'Roman', 'camp', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'unjustly', 'treated', 'anger', 'freeing', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'unjustly', 'treated', 'name', 'God', 'however', 'extremely', 'strange', 'never', 'seen', 'unjust', 'treatment', 'people', 'prior', 'visit', 'Roman', 'camp', 'Consequently', 'escape', 'away', 'approaching', 'Saxons', 'begins', 'very', 'similar', 'Fuqua', 'Tears', 'Sun', '2003', 'where', 'group', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'disobey', 'order', 'helping', 'local', 'populations', 'genocide', 'story', 'brave', 'warrior', 'fighting', 'just', 'causes', 'fight', 'higher', 'cause', 'freedom.The', 'original', 'tale', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'audience', 'wisdom', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'would', 'be', 'seemingly', 'fitting', 'time', 'when', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'Nevertheless', 'King', 'Arthur', 'parody', 'way', 'knights', 'tackle', 'political', 'issues', 'way', 'only', 'contemporary', 'heroes', 'do', 'films', 'awkwardness', 'film', 'King', 'Arthur', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'self-righteous', 'attempt', 'recreating', 'frequently', 'told', 'tale', 'displayed', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'Ireland', 'grand', 'war', 'scenes', 'only', 'Gibson', 'Braveheart', '1995', 'end', 'King', 'Arthur', 'awkward', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'lessons', 'overall', 'audience', 'disappointing', 'experience']",King Arthur

I thought the director did a good job of making these larger than life characters real.  I really only have a couple of complaints.  In their attempt to make the movie more historical, Arthur was a Roman (fine), his cavalry was called (knights) a bit harder to believe but ok, Arthur and his Knights were sent on a mission to the North of Hadrian's Wall to rescue a Roman family.  This I have a problem with.  No Roman lived beyond the Wall.  To do so was to committ suicide.  That is the one major problem I have this the movie.  No Roman in their right mind would ever go to live beyond Hadrians Wall.  In the extended dvd, I liked the emphasis on Pelagius, which did occurr as well as the more fleshed out characters.

Blake ""Super Reader""","[0, 0]","This darker , grittier look at the Arthurian legend is inspired by recent findings that there was a real Arthur- or rather a series of Kings named Arthur who were responsible for the early unification of Britain after the ROmans left. Written by the creator of Gladiator, directed in stunning scope by Antoine Fuqua and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- this is a different twist on the legend and it works.Merlin is depicted as leader of the picts- the mysterious primitive warriors who roamed the woods and refused to be haltered by the yoke of Roman Christianity.  Gueneviere is a pict warrior woman who Arthur rescues from the hands of a Roman who is keeping her prisoner in the name of his god.The battle here is as much about the struggle between the old pagan ways and the new path of following the papist God and how these beliefs clash with self-determination and the desire of men to live free.Arthur and his knights form a reluctant union with the picts for a glorious battle scene with the Saxons. Stellan Skarsgaard as the Saxon leader is as frightening on the battlefield as any bad guy I have seen in any film. Clive Owen is a courageous, smart, honorable man fighting to find his path and destiny. Lancelot is his trusty partner in arms and still pagan.The principles we all know and love about the honor and valor of the knights of the round table are here- but what we see is not a world of magic, but a world of dark betrayals, brutality and the struggle for freedom in dark ages of history.I missed the theatrical release and this unrated director's cut is great. I paid to see Troy and it's greatest redeeming feature was that you see Brad Pitt naked many times- Arthur has depth and story.

851521,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,B0002YLCFQ,K. Jump,"[20, 22]","King Arthur as Roman warlord?  It's possible, but as that plot device is handled in this movie, it doesn't necessarily make for the best story.  Gone are the courtly, courteous knights of Malory and Tennyson, replaced by a troop of surly, pagan horsemen with little to admire in them save their great fighting prowess and their unifying loyalty to Arthur.  Arthur himself is far and away the most charismatic figure, as it should be, and at least he is a Christian (though at times it seems he places as much faith in humanism as he does in God). Guinevere is introduced as a barbarian warrior-woman (and not a particularly likeable one either) and Merlin is reduced to a primitive shaman, but at least we still get Excalibur and the Round Table.  The chilly scenery and cinematography are breathtaking and the combat scenes are powerful, but this is not the legend's best version. Like MISTS OF AVALON and some other modern retellings, this movie succumbs to revisionist agendas that almost always fail (neo-paganism, feminism, etc) and while the result is by no means a failure, it is nonetheless highly disappointing.  Even the argument that this film's departures from legend are justified because this is *the way it really was* doesn't hold water because it's just not true.  For example, Lancelot is featured prominently in the movie (though there is no illicit romance between he and Guenevere) but Lancelot is one of the Arthurian characters who is not based on a real person--he is the fictional creation of French author Chretien de Troyes.  Be that as it may, the problem is not that changes in the legend are made (every storyteller will change the tale to reflect his own vision) but rather how those changes are handled.  Would it have been so hard to make the knights more likeable?  Or to portray Christians as something other than oppressive tyrants (except Arthur, who usually comes across very well)?  I don't think so.  In any event, the core of the legend remains more or less intact, and as an inspirational action movie about fighting for your freedom and never giving up on your ideals KING ARTHUR succeeds more often than it fails.  For Athurian fans I definitely think this film is worth seeing--just don't expect too much.

851523,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B0002YLCFQ,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[3, 4]","It seems that in recent time historians have decided to correct the tale of King Arthur and unfortunately turn it from a romantic, magical and heroic tale, into one of a 5th century soldier of Rome, serving Roman-Imperial England against the savage battle-driven Saxons with the aid of a warrior version of Guinevere. Although this version is supposedly more historically accurate of King Arthur and is backed up by archaeological proof, I personally prefer the glorified romantic version. That's not to say that this isn't a good movie, because it still is. It may have its faults, but it definitely has its good points as well.While many of the actors were believable in their roles, and while Clive Owen is a great actor, I didn't think that he had the screen presence to really make me believe that he could demand the loyalty and dedication of his followers that he supposedly did. I think he might be more suited to a non-leading role than the role of a `King' such as Arthur. Keira Knightly played Guinevere great considering the limitations of the script. My only gripe with her is actually unrelated to her acting, and once again script related. This version of Guinevere is a strong, battle-adept warrior of a woman initially fighting against the Romans, and yet she so easily succumbs to the charm of Arthur, someone wholly dedicated to what she hates with a passion. This weakness just wasn't in character even knowing that her cause took a back seat in light of the invading Saxons.Regardless of criticism of the film script, the detail to historical accuracy of the time and location with respect to the costumes and settings is extremely impressive. The surroundings and somber lighting really pull you into the Era and create a highly believable world. And although the battle scenes never really brought anything new to the table, the battle on the frozen river in the mountains gave of a realism that had me shivering with the chill of the surroundings and the anxiety of the battle.

Although Arthur (which wasn't his real name) confronted Saxon expansion, it was only after the West Saxons were entrenched in the southern shires of England, making it an exercise in futility.  Cornwall became one of the first Welsh/Briton strongholds to become fully a West Saxon dependency, showing the line of advance was from the south to the north NOT from Hadrian's Wall south.To increase the irony, because of the wrong direction of settlement, the movie changes the allies of the Welsh from their own tribesmen in the south, to a band of Picts in the north.  The Picts would have more likely slaughtered the Welsh if they encountered them, considering them too aligned with Roman customs and mannerisms (i.e., defacto Romans).  The fact that the Welsh and the Saxons both shared a common Roman acculturation is completely lost in the movie, which shows the muttering and barbaric Germans facing the articulate and educated Welsh.  In fact, both nationalities were trained in Roman customs in varying degrees, the Welsh having long-established trading relationships with the Roman empire and the Saxons having adopted Roman military methods and language (they probably even wore similar clothing!).  Not surprisingly, this resulted less in conflict but more in intermarriage, producing a hybrid race of barbarians that for the most part looked favorably on their shared Roman heritage.There is too much false conflict in the plot based on ethnic differences and not enough illustration of what may have really antagonized ""Arthur"", namely a decreasing area of farming and productive space that would interfere with kingly prerogatives, control and wealth.  Another great problem with the movie is the use of weaponry that is 5 or 6 or more centuries more advanced than would have been possible in the 5th century.  The double-edged battleaxe was not invented by the Vikings until the 10th century, the arrow was not used in great numbers in Europe until the 11th century, crossbows were a medieval invention to defeat armor and catapults were perfected for siege warfare against castles (there were no castles in  5th century England).  This is part of the problem in connecting ""knights"" and ""armor"" to the Arthurian legend, then one needs to bring in the weapons of the Late Middle Ages to justify the misleading terminology and mythology.  One error compounds another.All in all, a very poor rendition of history which lends no insight as to the real conflict between Saxon and Briton.  That the West Saxons were initially invited into England by some of the Welsh to defend against other invaders in the absence of Roman military authority is also not presented.",1,"Arrows, battleaxes, armor, crossbows and catapults in 452 A.D.

Still It had it's good points, and if you can put aside the terrible story line, lack of historical accuracy and lack of anything relating to the Arthur of legend it can be watchable. Or not. If you are just watching it for eye candy, the production values are quite good. And many of the supporting roles are amply cast and well played (such as Stellan Skarsgard, king of the Saxons). But the main characters were terribly cast. Knightley was probobly the best of the three main characters. I like Clive Owen and Ioan Gufford but neither of them are believable as tough guys, and these guys were supposed to have been among the toughest.That was enough to ruin it for me, but they also had help from a terrible script, ripe with repetative and cliche lines. Historically speaking, it seems to me that locating a guy named Articus, who was a Roman, and supposing this was the Arthur of legend is a good stretch at best. As for the legend, there is no resemlbance except for the names. We will forget the fact that if these 'wariors' were centurions they probobly would have spoken latin. To be fair, there are aspects of the film which are acurate, and others that are believable, but mostly just a muddled pile of scenes, that on the whole, is indeciferable as a coherent story.I guess the most bothersome of the verbal claptrap are the oft repeated cries for freedom. They are fighting for Rome's dominance over a conquered land that is slipping away. Yet they consistantly yell cries of freedom. Backwords to be sure. It is really beyond comprehesion how anyone with a modicum of sense can buy into this thing. I give one star because it is perfunctury and one star for the production values.

851529,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002YLCFQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","I am open to reinterpreting classic myths and legends in different settings.  For example, it their &quot;Elseworld&quot; stories DC comics has retold the familiar origins of Superman and Batman in different time periods: e.g., Superman arrives in the England of the Dark Ages or Batman in the London of Victorian England.  For that matter, &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; has Arthur and the knights of his roundtable reincarnated in the year 3000 in time to save England from an alien invasion.  So when &quot;King Arthur&quot; wants to locate the &quot;true story&quot; of Arthur in the last days of the Roman occupation of Brittania I find that to be an intriguing idea.The Romans had always found this last outpost of the Empire a problematic area: Hadrian's Wall essentially separates the north (Scotland) from the south (England), trying to keep the Woads (Huh?  We would get the wrong idea if you called these people the Celts?) on the other side of the barrier.  Adding to the incentive to abandon the land is the arrival of the Saxons on the scene who are set on killing everyone and pillaging everything.  In such a land, a man who could become a rallying point against the onslaught of barbarism would be worth remembering.In David Franzoni's script Arthur (Clive Owen) is the son of a Roman officer and a Briton woman.  Sent to Rome to be educated he returned as Arturius, commander of a garrison on Hadrian's well.  His knights, in a subplot that does come across as a bit forced, are from the land of Sarmatia, far to the west.  When their land was defeated the Romans spared their lives, but bound the knights and their male descendants to 15 years of military service.  Now that period is up and awaiting their honorable discharges (and safe passage throughout the empire) are the last six of the Sarmatia knights who ride with Arthur: Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson).  They just want to go home, but a bishop (Ivano Marescotti) shows up from Rome with one last mission.The knights go, but it is not for the bishop, because they are all pagans, or for Rome, because they care little for an empire that is abandoning the land their friends died defending, but for Arthur.  The only one who does not seem to know that he is a living legend is Arthur himself; or, if he knows, he neither cares nor believes in the stories.  But Merlin (Stephen Dillane), the holy man  of the Woads respects Arthur as the warrior who can lead men in battle, Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgrd) the leader of the Saxons hears Arthur's name everywhere he goes and finds him the rare man worth killing, and young Guinevere (Keira Knightley) has been raised on fairy tales about Arthur and his knights.  This film is not about King Arthur as much as it is about how Arthur became king in this reimagining of the tale.Given the context of this telling of the Arthur story it makes sense that the epic love triangle between Arthur, Guenivere and Lancelot is jettisoned.  In many ways that story, which remains the greatest love triangle since it is the husband's wife and best friend, has taken over the Arthurian legend.  Director Antoine Fuqua is really going back to the basics, although in a way that will make most Arthurian scholars cringe.  In this context I like not only turning Guenivere into a Celtic warrior but also that she advocates Arthur's destiny and is not merely a landed lady worthy of marriage.  Besides, there is the nice contrast between Knightley's stately beauty as she fires her arrows and her ferocity as she gets to race across a battle field and win a bunch of sword fights.  You get the feeling she was having the most fun of anyone in this film (I waited patiently for Ioan Gruffudd to do something really impressive with his two swords but they never really came up with anything).What is interesting given the idea that the Knights of the Round Table were the personification of Christian warriors is how the Church is blamed in the film for the downfall of Rome.  Arthur is a true believer who has taken the teachings of Christianity to the level of the equality of all human beings, while the only other Christians we see in the film are engaging in torture and slavery.  Arthur embodies the best of both Roman and Christian virtues, which makes him a most unique individual, but this film really does some serious retroactive Church bashing.Yes, there are some problematic elements in this film.  No Roman family, let along one with the Pope's favorite godson, is going to be living beyond Hadrian's Wall in Caledonia (Scotland), and I the ending of the sword fight between Arthur and Cerdic is so trite by this point in movie history it is rather insulting to the audience.  But on balance this is ambitious effort to tell the &quot;real&quot; story and there the situation is reasonably well thought out (plus working in bits from classic films like &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;).  Most importantly, the actors make it believable, even when they have to proclaim rather pretentious dialogue.  The climactic battle scene offers a nice blend of Roman technology and Celtic bravery (I thought the charge of the Woads was a nice representation of the speed of the Celtic attack since they do not bother with armor), and the result, while not a great film, is certainly interesting enough to warrant a look.",4,Imaging a new story for the &quot;real&quot; King Arthur,1090195200,"07 19,

Perhaps Arthur was in fact a Roman.  I wouldn't know, obviously, but I'm happy to take the word of someone who has looked into it, with the additional comment that I don't fully trust anyone on this issue.Judging the movie apart from its possible historical accuracy, I have to give it a definite thumbs down.  There is just too much wrong with it.There are many battle scenes.  They don't give me the feeling of battle.  They are Hollywood battle scenes, lots of closeups, lots of blood and gore, lots of heroism, and none of it looks the least bit real.  It is a bunch of nonsense.The dialogue is pretty bad as well.  There's nothing realistic in the characters.  I don't sense even one real person on the screen.  This isn't exactly Dustin Hoffman here.  This is a bunch of Hollywood nonsense.Guinevere as Wonder Woman.  Yeah, okay.  It's one thing to say that there were female warriors back then, and I have read about Boadicea.  But I bet if Boadicea did in fact participate in hand to hand fighting, she wasn't a slender beauty queen.Guinevere reminded me of the female warrior in Lord of the Rings.  It's nice to have a female role model to make the little girls in the theatre, in their karate classes, proud of themselves.  Why not?  It's all make believe for the guys as well.  It's like Rocky.  The real Rocky was a shlub who couldn't beat Muhammad Ali in his dreams.  The Bayonne Bleeder.  Guinevere is Miss Rocky, so good for her.This movie is a silly bloody fiction, and it isn't worth your time to watch, if your taste is like mine.  If you like silly bloody stories, you will like this one too.  The good guys come off quite well in it.  Don't put your money on the villain, no matter how favored he seems to be.  You want a real long shot, bet on a villain.One part of this movie reminds me of another famous fictional story, the one about Moses leading the Israelites through the sea, a sea which ends up swallowing the army of Egypt.  The same thing happens here, only the sea is composed of ice, temporarily.  Crackkkkkkkk.........I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the Egyptians, I mean the Saxons, were wearing swimsuits and inflated tubes.  Failing as a drama, it might have been funny as a comedy.To put my comments in perspective, I think that almost all of the adventure movies out today are absolute garbage.  It's not that I'm hard to please.  It's that most of the dramatic movies out now are worthless crap, unless you are into watching phony violence for the sake of enjoying the phony violence.  I'm not saying that this movie is any worse than the rest of the garbage out there.Here are a few of the things you learn from this movie.  First of all, Germans are bloodthirsty evil villains.  Second, Christians are stupid asses who enjoy torturing pagans.  Third, Romans were pretty awful themselves, except of course for Arthur.  Fourth, it is quite possible to shoot an arrow any number of yards, high into the air, and have it come down plunk right into a sensitive organ of a man hiding in a tree.",2,Typical Hollywood adventure garbage,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,3137,"['can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'Perhaps', 'Arthur', 'was', 'fact', 'Roman', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'obviously', ""'m"", 'happy', 'take', 'word', 'someone', 'who', 'looked', 'additional', 'comment', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'trust', 'anyone', 'issue.Judging', 'movie', 'apart', 'possible', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'have', 'give', 'definite', 'thumbs', 'down', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'wrong', 'are', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'feeling', 'battle', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'battle', 'scenes', 'lots', 'closeups', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'lots', 'heroism', 'none', 'least', 'bit', 'real', 'bunch', 'nonsense.The', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'bad', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'realistic', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'even', 'one', 'real', 'person', 'screen', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'here', 'bunch', 'Hollywood', 'nonsense.Guinevere', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Yeah', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'were', 'female', 'warriors', 'back', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'Boadicea', 'bet', 'Boadicea', 'did', 'fact', 'participate', 'hand', 'hand', 'fighting', 'was', ""n't"", 'slender', 'beauty', 'queen.Guinevere', 'reminded', 'female', 'warrior', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'nice', 'have', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'make', 'little', 'girls', 'theatre', 'karate', 'classes', 'proud', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'believe', 'guys', 'as', 'well', 'Rocky', 'real', 'Rocky', 'was', 'shlub', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'dreams', 'Bayonne', 'Bleeder', 'Guinevere', 'Miss', 'Rocky', 'so', 'good', 'her.This', 'movie', 'silly', 'bloody', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'watch', 'taste', 'mine', 'like', 'silly', 'bloody', 'stories', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'too', 'good', 'guys', 'come', 'quite', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'put', 'money', 'villain', 'matter', 'how', 'favored', 'be', 'want', 'real', 'long', 'shot', 'bet', 'villain.One', 'part', 'movie', 'famous', 'fictional', 'story', 'one', 'about', 'leading', 'Israelites', 'sea', 'sea', 'up', 'swallowing', 'army', 'Egypt', 'same', 'thing', 'here', 'only', 'sea', 'composed', 'ice', 'temporarily', 'Crackkkkkkkk', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'Egyptians', 'mean', 'Saxons', 'were', 'wearing', 'swimsuits', 'inflated', 'tubes', 'Failing', 'drama', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'comedy.To', 'put', 'comments', 'perspective', 'think', 'almost', 'adventure', 'movies', 'out', 'today', 'are', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'not', ""'m"", 'hard', 'please', 'most', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'out', 'now', 'are', 'worthless', 'crap', 'are', 'watching', 'phony', 'violence', 'sake', 'enjoying', 'phony', 'violence', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'worse', 'rest', 'garbage', 'there.Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'learn', 'movie', 'First', 'Germans', 'are', 'bloodthirsty', 'evil', 'villains', 'Second', 'Christians', 'are', 'stupid', 'asses', 'who', 'enjoy', 'torturing', 'pagans', 'Third', 'Romans', 'were', 'pretty', 'awful', 'course', 'Arthur', 'Fourth', 'quite', 'possible', 'shoot', 'arrow', 'number', 'yards', 'high', 'air', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'plunk', 'right', 'sensitive', 'organ', 'man', 'hiding', 'tree']",King Arthur

As the Romans prepare to leave, the Saxons invade and the native Britons are faced with a new threat/enemy.  Moreover, the Empire finds itself in the midst of the transformation from the old traditional Greco-Roman religion to the new Christian one.Overall, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is definitely original.The clash between Christendom and druidic paganism is as fascinating as the internal conflicts within the early Christian Church, and both presented very well in the film.The scene in the chapel/dungeon and battle on the lake are breathtaking to say the least.On the negative side the lead actor, Clive Owen, carries himself too much like Nicholas Cage (his voice-his appearance) as if that is who he is thinking of when reciting his lines.Moreover, it becomes rather tiring and annoying with the repetitive ""freedom"" theme, especially with the otherwise ""barbarian"" Guinevere (!!!) delivering modern-style lectures to Arthur.The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!Forts, Battles, and Swordfights are all about.In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!",4,RUS!,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1865,"['have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'out', 'very', 'pleasant', 'entertaining', 'movie.King', 'Arthur', 'screen', 'not', 'traditional', 'version', 'alternative', 'tale', 'legendary', 'king', 'Camelot', 'Lady', 'Guinevere', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'likes.In', 'version', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'are', 'Sarmatian', 'mercenaries', 'southern', 'Russia', 'brought', 'Britannia', 'bound', 'contract', 'serve', 'out', 'time', 'defence', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Northwestern', 'borders.Times', 'are', 'changing', 'Empire', 'pressure', 'advancing', 'barbarians', 'forced', 'abandon', 'farthermost', 'provinces', 'outposts', 'focus', 'defence', 'Italia', 'Rome', 'Romans', 'prepare', 'leave', 'Saxons', 'invade', 'native', 'Britons', 'are', 'faced', 'new', 'threat/enemy', 'Moreover', 'Empire', 'midst', 'transformation', 'old', 'traditional', 'Greco-Roman', 'religion', 'new', 'Christian', 'one.Overall', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'plot', 'definitely', 'original.The', 'clash', 'Christendom', 'druidic', 'paganism', 'as', 'fascinating', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'early', 'Christian', 'Church', 'presented', 'very', 'well', 'film.The', 'scene', 'chapel/dungeon', 'battle', 'lake', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'say', 'least.On', 'negative', 'side', 'lead', 'actor', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'too', 'much', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'voice-his', 'appearance', 'who', 'thinking', 'when', 'reciting', 'lines.Moreover', 'rather', 'tiring', 'annoying', 'repetitive', 'freedom', 'theme', 'especially', 'otherwise', 'barbarian', 'Guinevere', 'delivering', 'modern-style', 'lectures', 'Arthur.The', 'setting', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Forts', 'Battles', 'Swordfights', 'are', 'about.In', 'short', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'watching']",King Arthur

I have a particular interest in Scythians and Sarmatians--of whom we know too little and see even less of in popular culture.

And so, if you don't care about historical reality or Academy Award winning performances, this latest version of the King Arthur myth is a great couple of hours of pure entertainment.  It's set in the year 405 and tells a rather modern version of a courageous and wise Roman King Arthur, who leads a band of brave knights into a variety of battles.In a short prelude to the main action, the audience learns that these knights have been forced into involuntary servitude as young boys because they come from a tribe of great fighters whose lives the Romans spared because of their bravery.  Their names are familiar - Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Tristan, etc. and they are bonded in the way that men at war bond.  These are the years, however, of the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, which has Arthur questioning his own loyalty.  After all, his own mother was a Britton, one of the conquered subjects of Rome.  And he's also the kind of king who believes in freedom and justice for all even though its centuries before these concepts became popular.  But no matter, as played by Clive Owen, he sure does look good in his armor, as do all the knights, who seem to be able to move around quite freely in their seemingly restrictive garments.Enter Guinevere played by Keira Knightly, an 18-year old beauty, who is so pretty that she steals every scene she's in.  But this Guinevere, however, is no damsel in distress.  After she is rescued from a torture chamber by the good Arthur, we soon learn that she is a woman to be reckoned with.  Not only does she stand the snow in a low cut gown and shoot arrows at the enemy, she also has another costume which looks like a leather bikini with just a narrow leather strap over her chest to bring out her cleavage.  This is appropriate since she is supposed to be from a matriarchal pagan tribe and for this scene she wears body paint.  In this outfit she carries a sword and fights one-on-one with the Saxon bad guys as their red blood splashes on her in strategic places.I thought the casting was wonderful.  The prelude of the young boys taken away to fight grow up to look pretty much what we would expect them to look like as adults. Lancelot is dark with curly hair for example.  One of the young boys is chubby and he grows up to be a knight called Bors, who is a big lovable giant of man played by Ray Winstone who is cast as the loving father of a dozen children and is seen sometimes holding a baby who looks exactly like him.  I liked the idea that there were no super stars in this production.  This allowed me to see the people as characters, rather than the latest box office draw.The battle scenes were great.  This was because it was possible to follow certain characters which fleshed out the storyline.  Later, the extras on the DVD explained the difficulty of training all the extras to ride horses, fence and generally look authentic.  The main characters' fights were great also, mostly because they really looked like they were fighting, including the exhaustion that must come after a day of heavy swordplay. I applaud the director for this as well as the film editor, because in a film like this there is a lot of footage to choose from and decisions have to be made as to what to leave in and what lands on the cutting room floor.This is not a film that will grip my emotions and put tears in my eyes.  But it certainly did engage my attention.  That's why I recommend it.",5,This retelling of the King Arthur myth is pure entertainment,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3495,"['Enjoyment', 'film', 'expectations', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'historical', 'reality', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performances', 'latest', 'version', 'King', 'Arthur', 'myth', 'great', 'couple', 'hours', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'set', 'year', '405', 'tells', 'rather', 'modern', 'version', 'courageous', 'wise', 'Roman', 'King', 'Arthur', 'who', 'band', 'brave', 'knights', 'variety', 'battles.In', 'short', 'prelude', 'main', 'action', 'audience', 'knights', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'involuntary', 'servitude', 'young', 'boys', 'come', 'tribe', 'great', 'fighters', 'Romans', 'spared', 'bravery', 'names', 'are', 'familiar', 'Lancelot', 'Sir', 'Galahad', 'Tristan', 'etc', 'are', 'bonded', 'way', 'men', 'war', 'bond', 'are', 'years', 'however', 'beginning', 'decline', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Arthur', 'questioning', 'own', 'loyalty', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'Britton', 'one', 'conquered', 'subjects', 'Rome', 'also', 'kind', 'king', 'who', 'freedom', 'justice', 'even', 'centuries', 'concepts', 'became', 'popular', 'matter', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'sure', 'look', 'good', 'armor', 'do', 'knights', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'quite', 'freely', 'seemingly', 'restrictive', 'garments.Enter', 'Guinevere', 'played', 'Keira', 'Knightly', '18-year', 'old', 'beauty', 'who', 'so', 'pretty', 'scene', 'Guinevere', 'however', 'damsel', 'distress', 'rescued', 'torture', 'chamber', 'good', 'Arthur', 'soon', 'learn', 'woman', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Not', 'only', 'stand', 'snow', 'low', 'cut', 'gown', 'shoot', 'arrows', 'enemy', 'also', 'costume', 'leather', 'bikini', 'just', 'narrow', 'leather', 'strap', 'chest', 'bring', 'out', 'cleavage', 'appropriate', 'supposed', 'be', 'matriarchal', 'pagan', 'tribe', 'scene', 'body', 'paint', 'outfit', 'sword', 'fights', 'one-on-one', 'Saxon', 'bad', 'guys', 'red', 'blood', 'splashes', 'strategic', 'places.I', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'prelude', 'young', 'boys', 'taken', 'away', 'fight', 'grow', 'up', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'look', 'adults', 'Lancelot', 'dark', 'curly', 'hair', 'example', 'One', 'young', 'boys', 'chubby', 'up', 'be', 'knight', 'called', 'Bors', 'who', 'big', 'lovable', 'giant', 'man', 'played', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'cast', 'loving', 'father', 'dozen', 'children', 'seen', 'sometimes', 'holding', 'baby', 'who', 'exactly', 'liked', 'idea', 'were', 'super', 'stars', 'production', 'allowed', 'see', 'people', 'characters', 'rather', 'latest', 'box', 'office', 'draw.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'was', 'was', 'possible', 'follow', 'certain', 'characters', 'fleshed', 'out', 'storyline', 'Later', 'extras', 'DVD', 'explained', 'difficulty', 'training', 'extras', 'ride', 'horses', 'fence', 'generally', 'look', 'authentic', 'main', 'characters', 'fights', 'were', 'great', 'also', 'mostly', 'really', 'looked', 'were', 'fighting', 'including', 'exhaustion', 'must', 'come', 'day', 'heavy', 'swordplay', 'applaud', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'editor', 'film', 'lot', 'footage', 'choose', 'decisions', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'leave', 'what', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.This', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'grip', 'emotions', 'put', 'tears', 'eyes', 'certainly', 'did', 'engage', 'attention', 'why', 'recommend']",King Arthur

851540,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B0002YLCFQ,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[3, 9]","King Arthur is a movie that was built on sound concept but flawed in delivery and mediocre in quality. Trying to follow the lead of ""Troy"" King Arthur attempts to recreate the ""reality"" of a classic legend/myth. The plot for the movie follows along a story-line that doesnt have any wizards, dragons or magic of any sort. If you're looking for Lord of the Rings seek elsewhere. The story however is the strongest point of the movie.As the western Roman Empire in disintegrating and babarian tribes flood the frontiers everywhere, the decision is made for Rome to withdraw from it's most far flung province - the Island of Britain. A huge wall built by the Emperor Hadrian, seperated the southern roman controlled section of the island from the barbaric north - still controlled by various celtic tribes. As the roman legions pull out of Britania, an army of barbarian invaders from northern europe - the saxons - has landed in Northumbria, and is visciously conqueroring the natives moving towards the wall. The saxons wish to use the Roman pull out as an oppritunity to take over britain for their own gain.In all this turmoil a Roman commander on Hadrians wall rises to become the first real leader of non-roman britain. He and his knights are sent to rescue an aristocrat who is north of the wall. This is the stage for our adventure which culminates in Arthur's ultimate decision - does he go back to his homeland of Parthia which he barely remembers? or Does he stay in this new land he now calls home, and attempt to lead the people he has come to feel as ""his"" people through this dark chapter in history?It all sounds great doesnt it? The problem is this doesnt work well at all. The acting throughout the movie is acceptable at best, and sometimes quite bad. There is little effective humor in the movie except for one particularly likeable character. The action is not very well done at all and the battles are just poorly coreographed. The only exception is the climactic battle at the end of the movie with arthur leading the britons against the saxons. This battle is semi well done but falls way short of anything in braveheart, troy, or other such films.The characters are poorly developed and you never really care about any of them. This has exceptions but nothing in the movie feels dramatic and there are no scenes that are at all moving. The entire movie feels uninspired and generic - as though it were a very well done made-for-TV movie. Adding to this is the fact that it's a PG-13 movie, so brutal hand to hand combat actually comes off as pretty tame. Entire battles can be fought without bloodying a sword.Visually the movie is extreamly poorly done, the effects are terrible. The one little visual gimmick they come up with is following an arrow through the air - and they use it SEVERAL times in the movie! So played out! There is a scene where the saxon army falls into a frozen river which is kind of cool, but it doesnt make up for the terrible job on the rest of arthur. The scenery is dull and the movie makes it all too obvious they used fake snow!Uninspired and mediocre define this movie pretty well. Had I seen it on A&E; or USA I might have a different reaction. But I must say that ""Attila"" (which WAS a TV-Movie) was better than this, and this is a major release! There'sno dodging it - King Arthur was an all-around disapointment and could have been a truly great movie. The fact that the setting and geo-political plot had so much potential and was so intriguing is the only thing tipping the scales to get that 3rd star.",3,A dissapointment,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,3563,"['King', 'Arthur', 'movie', 'was', 'built', 'sound', 'concept', 'flawed', 'delivery', 'mediocre', 'quality', 'Trying', 'follow', 'lead', 'Troy', 'King', 'Arthur', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'reality', 'classic', 'legend/myth', 'plot', 'movie', 'along', 'story-line', 'have', 'wizards', 'dragons', 'magic', 'sort', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'seek', 'elsewhere', 'story', 'however', 'strongest', 'point', 'movie.As', 'western', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'disintegrating', 'babarian', 'tribes', 'flood', 'frontiers', 'everywhere', 'decision', 'made', 'Rome', 'withdraw', 'most', 'far', 'flung', 'province', 'Island', 'Britain', 'huge', 'wall', 'built', 'Emperor', 'Hadrian', 'seperated', 'southern', 'roman', 'controlled', 'section', 'island', 'barbaric', 'north', 'still', 'controlled', 'various', 'celtic', 'tribes', 'roman', 'pull', 'Britania', 'army', 'barbarian', 'invaders', 'northern', 'europe', 'saxons', 'landed', 'Northumbria', 'visciously', 'conqueroring', 'natives', 'moving', 'wall', 'saxons', 'wish', 'use', 'Roman', 'out', 'oppritunity', 'take', 'over', 'britain', 'own', 'gain.In', 'turmoil', 'Roman', 'commander', 'Hadrians', 'wall', 'become', 'first', 'real', 'leader', 'non-roman', 'britain', 'knights', 'are', 'sent', 'rescue', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'north', 'wall', 'stage', 'adventure', 'Arthur', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'go', 'back', 'homeland', 'Parthia', 'barely', 'stay', 'new', 'land', 'now', 'home', 'attempt', 'lead', 'people', 'come', 'feel', 'people', 'dark', 'chapter', 'history', 'great', 'doesnt', 'problem', 'doesnt', 'work', 'well', 'acting', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'best', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'bad', 'little', 'effective', 'humor', 'movie', 'one', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'character', 'action', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'battles', 'are', 'just', 'poorly', 'coreographed', 'only', 'exception', 'climactic', 'battle', 'end', 'movie', 'arthur', 'leading', 'britons', 'saxons', 'battle', 'semi', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'short', 'anything', 'braveheart', 'troy', 'other', 'such', 'films.The', 'characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'developed', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'exceptions', 'nothing', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'moving', 'entire', 'movie', 'feels', 'uninspired', 'generic', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Adding', 'fact', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'brutal', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'actually', 'off', 'pretty', 'tame', 'Entire', 'battles', 'can', 'be', 'fought', 'bloodying', 'sword.Visually', 'movie', 'extreamly', 'poorly', 'done', 'effects', 'are', 'terrible', 'one', 'little', 'visual', 'gimmick', 'come', 'up', 'following', 'arrow', 'air', 'use', 'SEVERAL', 'times', 'movie', 'So', 'played', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'saxon', 'army', 'frozen', 'river', 'kind', 'cool', 'doesnt', 'make', 'up', 'terrible', 'job', 'rest', 'arthur', 'scenery', 'dull', 'movie', 'too', 'obvious', 'used', 'fake', 'snow', 'Uninspired', 'mediocre', 'define', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'Had', 'seen', 'A', 'E', 'USA', 'might', 'have', 'different', 'reaction', 'must', 'say', 'Attila', 'TV-Movie', 'was', 'better', 'major', 'release', ""There'sno"", 'dodging', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'all-around', 'disapointment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'fact', 'setting', 'geo-political', 'plot', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'was', 'so', 'intriguing', 'only', 'thing', 'tipping', 'scales', 'get', '3rd', 'star']",King Arthur

The movie proves to be very entertaining, action packed and amazingly for a movie of this type, well acted. The pace is pretty even and there's a good story to the film, story of courage, loyalty and honor; three virtues on which this movie ultimately rest its soul on.The movie don't do well if you really have to think deep. The fine story wasn't supported by a fine script, that much must be made clear. Some of the other reviewers have already pointed out some of the major flaws of the movie, biggest one I thought was that dumbo Roman family in distress plot. What was Antoine Fuqua thinking when he okay this??But I thought the negatives were outweight by the positives. The actor who played that Saxon leader proves to be very good. I wish there were more scenes with him in it. Clive Owen held his own, Keira Knightley went from helpless girl in muck to Amazon bow-woman. Actually, she wasn't bad at all.  I think these ""Woad"" were nothing more then Picts of ancient Britain. Merlin seem to be more of a druid leader type but his role in this movie is very limited.If any of you out there who read this, be warn that there is no Camelot, no knights in shinning armor and no love triangle in this movie.

Good effort to add more ""facts"" to the script, particularly regarding the origin of knights, King Arthur and other characters of Arthurian legends, including Merlin, Lancelot or Guinevere (Percival is badly missing here though). Some of this ideas has been somehow treated more recently in movies such as ""The last legion"". I liked the excellent depiction of saxon invaders and the effort to fit the whole story with the historical anglo-saxon invasions to British Isles. Finally, the movie has a good pace, great battle scenes, good photography, and a nice soundtrack.The bad things include the acting of Clive Owen and too much ""freedom"" exclamations, the ""battle horse"" of nowadays arguments to justify invasions all over the planet..., but you can easily skip that garbage. Finally, stop the the movie at about 4 min before ending and view the alternate ending provided on the extras.

851543,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B0002YLCFQ,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[2, 8]","I thoroughly enjoyed this new version of ""King Arthur,"" a rousing adventure based on Arturius Castus whom most historians believe is the basis of the legendary King Arthur.  The film received mixed reviews from critics and yet I and the audience that I saw it with obviously enjoyed it.  I will think twice before giving critics' reviews my notice after they've showered an incredibly boring and torpid ""Lost in Translation"" with rave reviews and yet panned this enormously entertaining film.  It is definitely a much better film than the critics are giving it credit for.Don't expect to see this film and find a movie reminiscent of ""Mists of Avalon"" or ""Excalibur."" After all, this story doesn't take place in medieval times but instead the last days of the Roman rule of England (456 AD).  It is based more on the historical Arthur than the stuff of myth and legend.  This film has more in common with ""Gladiator"" and the rousing warfare and swordplay found in films like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Braveheart.""  If you leave the baggage of your Arthurian preconceptions at home (no Lady of the Lake, Avalon or sorcery) then you will find an entertaining film full of wit, grit, action and grandeur.The film has many highlights which is to say that it doesn't have some minor flaws.  The flaws - to me - have more to do with editing than anything else.  One gets a sense that some bits and pieces were cut to give this film a PG-13 rating and even director Antoine Fuqua has already mentioned that we will see more intense fighting on the dvd. And as much as I like Stellan Skarsgard (Cedric), he makes for a lukewarm villain.Any flaws, however, are overshadowed by the many highlights of this film: the fine and attractive cast, beautiful cinematography, gritty realism, fantastic action set pieces, intelligent and often witty dialogue and Hans Zimmer's haunting score.  Even though the actors are made to look like well-worn soldiers with longish hair and sometimes bearded faces, it is hard not to notice the good looks and charisma of actors like Croupier's Clive Owen (Arthur), Horatio Hornblower's Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Daniel Deronda's Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Stevenson (Dagonet) and Pirate of the Caribbean's Keira Knightley (Guinevere).  Add to this the fine performances and great swordsmanship and you are - whether male or female - in for a treat.  There are some lighthearted moments and clever wordplay courtesy of characters like Gawain (Joel Edgerton from ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"")and Bors (the prolific Ray Winstone), the most rough and tumble of the knights.  An audience favorite, Bors reminds me of LOTR's Gimli, a tough and cantankerous warrior with a warm heart and a killer sense of humor.  I had initial reservations about Clive Owen carrying such a high-profile role but he does his job wonderfully.  He is honorable and heroic, charismatic and noble.  Keira Knightley shines in yet another star-making role, proving once and for all that she is a gifted actress who succesfully blends femininity with physical strength.In short, ""King Arthur"" is a much better film than it is being given credit for.  The battle scenes are some of the best ever filmed and there are some light, funny moments and also moments that move you to tears.  If you enjoy the ""King Arthur"" legend, then leave your expectations at home, prepare to enjoy this film for what it is and you will be entertained.  If you enjoy films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart,""  then do not miss this film!  It is a gem that deserves to be seen.",5,A rousing and intelligent action film.

I also admire Arthur's sense of justice in cleaning out corrupt Roman overlords who were trying to exploit and enslave the locals.

851546,A3P738KVXL2YYM,B0002YLCFQ,Mary Chrapliwy,"[18, 19]","Here is yet another retelling of the King Arthur legend. It's not a romanticized version laced with magic. If that is what you seek then you would do best to watch the Mists of Avalon (also a thoroughly satisfying book then movie). This story is laced with gritty realism of what life may have been like back in the period of Roman occupation of Great Britain.I have read countless retellings of the King Arthur legend. This movie probably creates a more historically accurate portrayal of the story of King Arthur and the people who surrounded him ... if he actually existed.This story is told during the ancient history of the British Isles and their occupation by Roman forces. Arthur is the son of a Roman soldier and a British mother. He is torn by his duty to Rome as well as his duty to the occupants of Britain. He and his band of weary soldiers look forward to their release from their service to Rome after fifteen years of duty (forced upon them from childhood by Roman occupiers) but, instead of receiving their release papers, they are given one last quest. To do the final bidding of the Roman Empire is a nearly suicidal mission into the lands north of Hadrian's Wall. Those lands are primary occupied by Celtic tribes who value their freedom and fight fiercely against the Roman occupiers south of Hadrian's Wall. Told they will be ""hunted down like dogs"" if they don't go on this mission, Arthur has no choice but to go forward on the very dangerous quest.Meanwhile, from the north, the isle is being invaded by Saxons - fierce, murderous people who plan to kill everyone they find and burn every village. Squeezed between the Romans to the south and the invading Saxons to the north, the native Celts have no choice but to attempt to forge a bond between themselves and the powerful warrior Arthur and his band of warriors (not called knights in this story). Thus begins the classic battle between good and evil, right and wrong.Of a historical note, the women (including Guinevere) were portrayed as fierce warriors themselves - running into battle nearly naked and screaming - running into battle along with their Celtic warrior males. This was a fairly accurate portrayal of how things may have been according to historical texts. Women in ancient Celtic history were leaders and warriors along with the men of their tribes.

For all its historical inaccuracy, Gladiator was highly original for its time and, as its enduring impact proves, exceptionally well written, directed, and acted.

851551,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B0002YLCFQ,M. B. Trapp,"[3, 4]","I did not see the theatrical release of this movie so I don't have a reference point for the quality of the extended director's edition as opposed to the original. I know that most of the extra footage came during the battle scenes, making them so long as to almost become boring, and it takes a lot for a battle scene to bore me. Other than this, I found the story to be quite intriguing, being Hollywood's take on the ""real"" King Arthur, an attempt to demythologize the legend in the same way the filmmakers of Troy had done. The plot centers on Arthur, a half-British, half-Sarmatian soldier in the service of the Roman Empire in the waning days of her glory. He is the commander of the Roman outpost at Hadrian's Wall in Britain -a territory that Rome has decided to abandon - and events force him to decide whether he wants to stay in Britain amid the chaos that the Roman pullout will cause or to go another way, either to Rome itself or back to Sarmatia with the rest of his knights. It's a clever way of imagining how the historical Arthur - if he indeed was a real figure - might have grown into the legend that we know. Interestingly enough, the film does teach a bit of church history, as it has Pelagius being an influential figure in Arthur's early life. Thus the young soldier has a strong belief in free will, and resists any hint that he might have a destiny as the future ruler of Britain. Although I do not think it was the screenwriter's aim to correct Arthur's doctrine on this point, Arthur seems to get the picture, as he (obviously) embraces his destiny, a concept that he formerly did not believe in. Christian behavior and practice are also important concepts in the film, as Arthur the good Christian teaches some bad Christians a lesson about tolerance. Overall I would call the movie's portrayal of the Christian faith as more positive than negative. Arthur makes a strong statement about the value of faith in the face of ridicule by the pagan knights that follow him, particularly Lancelot. But Lancelot later admits to Guinevere that his lack of faith has made him a man of less character than Arthur. The believability factor throughout the film is fairly high until the end, where the director wants us to believe that a ninety pound waif like Keira Knightley is a ferocious warrior on the battlefield. Also, the number of ""hero fights"" in the last battle is ridiculous: Guinevere vs. the Saxon leader's son, Lancelot vs. the Saxon leader's son, Tristan vs. the Saxon leader, and finally Arthur vs. the Saxon leader. I like a good mano y mano swordfight between the hero and the villain as much as the next guy, but in this case it stretches credibility.

851554,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0002YLCFQ,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","I've been interested in the legend of King Arthur for a while, and although it doesn't quite come near my obsession with the Titanic, it still rouses my curiosity every so often. Hence the fact I've been dying to see this movie since it came out, but decided to wait for the director's cut DVD, so I could see the gorier version that wasn't shown in the cinemas. I got it for my Christmas, along with the book! Woohoo!I've seen a few of the Arthur movies made - Excalibur (which I barely made it through), Merlin (TV movie with Sam Niall), and Mists Of Avalon. The last two were excellent, and I must admit, I was hoping for something as magical as they were both. I was bitterly disappointed when this didn't come anywhere close to magical, and instead, seemed intent on ripping off both Braveheart & Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad - I still have no desire to see these movies).The characters are indistinguishable from each other in this - if I didn't like a certain Welshman Ioan Gruffud (can't pronounce his name however), playing Lancelot, then I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between him & Clive Owen, who played Arthur. The rest of the characters were barely given a proper introduction, and throughout most of the movie, I was lost as to why these people with long hair wanted Arthur's, and his men's, blood on their hands. Merlin barely made an appearance, he was referenced once, and that was it. Guinevere, played by a monotone and bored sounding Keira Knightley, didn't appear until halfway through the movie, and then barely appeared there after. Although they made sure they got shots of her in what can only be described, as a couple of bits of sticky tape for an outfit - at least she doesn't have enough to burst out of it. The `romance' between her & Lancelot was little more than a teaser, and not at all like the other movies, where she marries Arthur & then has an affair, or they have a threesome. And I did not think it was the done thing in those days for any physical contact outside of marriage. Slow down girl!Another thing I did NOT understand was the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer's name is splashed everywhere to do with this movie, which led me to think he actually directed it. But a guy called Antoine Fuqua, actually directed it. Bruckheimer just threw a pile of money at it, in order to get it made. I still don't see why his name is everything. Poor Fuqua isn't getting much recognition for his work. Michael Bay was originally supposed to direct, and with him, it was in development for five years. He left due to budget concerns. (I'll probably get an in-depth lecture about this entire paragraph on the ins & outs of directors, producers, and everyone inbetween that.)One section of the movie I did enjoy immensely was Arthur & his men pitted against the Saxons - at least I think that's who they were. They were about to fight on top of a frozen lake, which proceeded to crack beneath their combined weight, and the camera actually films beneath the ice - although it's probably very clever camera/computer trickery. This scene is quite close to being magical, but not enough.Most of the characters differ slightly to what I've seen them portrayed in other movies. Guinevere is normally a weak little girl, who'll kick off her knickers at any sign of a guy's attention, even if she bound in marriage to another guy, but in this, Keira Knightley played a snarling warrior, who's an expert archer. Clive Owen did not have the charisma to play Arthur, even though in other movies, he's basically a weakling, being pushed by the women around him or having to consult Merlin before he did anything. His eyes, although dark, were not in the least bit sexy, and were almost dead. And Lancelot seemed to be devoted to Arthur until the end - no running off with the girl there!Another quibble about the number of knights - didn't the legend state that there were twelve knights? There were only seven in this, and only four left by the end of the movie.At the start of this movie, it's described as being the `real' story of King Arthur, which was set many years before the fairytale/legend came about. Frankly, despite the fact I'll probably watch it again at some point, I'll be sticking to the fairytale/legend from now on. It's never a good thing when you see the `real' story, after you've been brought up on/told about the fairytale. Would you like to see the film version of Hansel & Gretel?

Finally someone realized that Arthur or Arturicus was contemporary to the Goths and not to ladies in castles and knights in shining armours. But the film developed has been a fiasco.The story developes in a strange mood. It is not epic, not funny, nor even interesting. The characters are simply too simple. And the small attempts to make them bi-dimensional failed. Let's take for instance Arthur. He has the same face all the film. He is always in this state of "" I am such a hero that I always act like if I were in a funeral"". I am not saying that the enviroment was exactly a picnic but, was he not tired of being always so proper? Clive Owen , ussualy an actor I like, acts like a stone, that is , with no emotion.And what about Merlin? To make his character like that better do not let him appear. Stephen Dillane, wonderful in Firelight and Mel Gibson's Hamlet seems that he was just passing by there.While I was watching the film I cannot stop thinking in Braveheart and Gladiator. I am not particularly fond of these two films but in comaprison they are two jewels. I am not sure if it was a problem with the direction.

851558,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0002YLCFQ,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 6]","The 2004 film ""King Arthur"" is not your standard retelling of the centuries-old tale about King Arthur and his knights of the round table.  For many years, archeologists and historians have attempted to explain the possible roots for the mythologies surrounding the fabled British king, and based upon the evidence and various theories that have been put forward, many believe that if King Arthur actually existed, it was at a time much earlier than most people tend to place the legend: at approximately the time when Rome still occupied ancient Britain (Gaul).  The producers and writers of the film ""King Arthur"" then constructed a fictional story about the legendary Arthur without the magic and grandeur of earlier films such as ""Camelot"" (1967) and ""Excalibur"" (1981), but with the realism of what may have occurred when Rome was preparing to abandon much of its empire.The film begins far to the east of Britain, in another part of the Roman Empire called Samatia. Here, Samatians, whom Romans had spared due to their fighting skills, were given an agreement by the Empire several generations earlier that a number of young Samatian boys would be taken by Rome, given military training, and serve the empire for the next 15 years as soldiers.  These Samatian knights, as they are referred to, would then be sent to a particular region of the empire to serve with the Roman army.  After their 15 years of service, they were then free to return to their Samatian homes. One of the groups of Samatian knights were sent to Britain to help defend Rome's occupation against the people's living north of Hadrian's Wall. Placed under the command of Artorious Castus, a.k.a. Arthur (Clive Owen), the Samatian knights include Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen); who are all anxious to obtain their freedom after having served the Roman Empire for a long 15 years.  Unfortunately, a bishop from Rome, Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti), orders them to instead rescue a Roman family living north of Hadrian's Wall before giving them their papers indicating that their military service was fulfilled.  Begrudgingly, they set out north of Hadrian's Wall for the first time in their lives.  After a small skirmish with local British, they arrive at the Roman estate where its Roman leader has used torture as a means of converting the local British Pagans into believing in Christianity.  Arthur rescues the tortured captives that include Guinevere (Keira Knightley), then proceeds to insist on evacuating everyone from the estate because of the approaching Saxon army that leaves no person alive in its wake.  The Saxons are lead by the sociopath & despot Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgrd) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger).  The result is a film filled with several intense battle scenes that were no doubt inspired by such films as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""Gladiator"" (2000), but without the ultra-shiny suits of armor and mysticism as in ""Excalibur"" and ""Camelot"".Because so many people are well familiar with the more popular & mystical stories about the legendary King Arthur, the far more realistic version of the story presented in the 2004 film ""King Arthur"" was not as well received by audiences as it could have been. However, by placing the possible historical Arthur within the context of the end of Rome's occupation of Britain, the film's writer (David Franzoni) and director (Antoine Fuqua) did a masterful job at attempting to create a plausible story from which the more popular legends could have developed.  Though parts of the story were a little rough at times, it was still entertaining and interesting.  Overall, I rate the 2004 ""King Arthur"" with 3.5 out of 5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.",4,An Interesting Interpretation of a Centuries Old Legend,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,3797,"['2004', 'film', 'King', 'Arthur', 'not', 'standard', 'retelling', 'centuries-old', 'tale', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'round', 'table', 'many', 'years', 'archeologists', 'historians', 'have', 'attempted', 'explain', 'possible', 'roots', 'mythologies', 'surrounding', 'fabled', 'British', 'king', 'based', 'evidence', 'various', 'theories', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'forward', 'many', 'believe', 'King', 'Arthur', 'actually', 'existed', 'was', 'time', 'much', 'earlier', 'most', 'people', 'tend', 'place', 'legend', 'approximately', 'time', 'when', 'Rome', 'still', 'occupied', 'ancient', 'Britain', 'Gaul', 'producers', 'writers', 'film', 'King', 'Arthur', 'then', 'constructed', 'fictional', 'story', 'legendary', 'Arthur', 'magic', 'grandeur', 'earlier', 'films', 'such', 'Camelot', '1967', 'Excalibur', '1981', 'realism', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'occurred', 'when', 'Rome', 'was', 'preparing', 'abandon', 'much', 'empire.The', 'film', 'far', 'east', 'Britain', 'part', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'called', 'Samatia', 'Here', 'Samatians', 'whom', 'Romans', 'had', 'spared', 'due', 'fighting', 'skills', 'were', 'given', 'agreement', 'Empire', 'several', 'generations', 'earlier', 'number', 'young', 'Samatian', 'boys', 'would', 'be', 'taken', 'Rome', 'given', 'military', 'training', 'serve', 'empire', 'next', '15', 'years', 'soldiers', 'Samatian', 'knights', 'are', 'referred', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'sent', 'particular', 'region', 'empire', 'serve', 'Roman', 'army', '15', 'years', 'service', 'were', 'then', 'free', 'return', 'Samatian', 'homes', 'One', 'groups', 'Samatian', 'knights', 'were', 'sent', 'Britain', 'help', 'defend', 'Rome', 'occupation', 'people', 'living', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Placed', 'command', 'Artorious', 'Castus', 'a.k.a', 'Arthur', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Samatian', 'knights', 'include', 'Lancelot', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Gawain', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Galahad', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Bors', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Tristan', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'are', 'anxious', 'obtain', 'freedom', 'having', 'served', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'long', '15', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'bishop', 'Rome', 'Bishop', 'Germanius', 'Ivano', 'Marescotti', 'orders', 'instead', 'rescue', 'Roman', 'family', 'living', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'giving', 'papers', 'indicating', 'military', 'service', 'was', 'fulfilled', 'Begrudgingly', 'set', 'out', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'first', 'time', 'lives', 'small', 'skirmish', 'local', 'British', 'arrive', 'Roman', 'estate', 'where', 'Roman', 'leader', 'used', 'torture', 'means', 'converting', 'local', 'British', 'Pagans', 'believing', 'Christianity', 'Arthur', 'tortured', 'captives', 'include', 'Guinevere', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'then', 'insist', 'evacuating', 'everyone', 'estate', 'approaching', 'Saxon', 'army', 'person', 'alive', 'wake', 'Saxons', 'are', 'lead', 'sociopath', 'despot', 'Cerdic', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'son', 'Cynric', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'result', 'film', 'filled', 'several', 'intense', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'such', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Gladiator', '2000', 'ultra-shiny', 'suits', 'armor', 'mysticism', 'Excalibur', 'Camelot', '.Because', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'well', 'familiar', 'more', 'popular', 'mystical', 'stories', 'legendary', 'King', 'Arthur', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'version', 'story', 'presented', '2004', 'film', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'received', 'audiences', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'However', 'placing', 'possible', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'context', 'end', 'Rome', 'occupation', 'Britain', 'film', 'writer', 'David', 'Franzoni', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'attempting', 'create', 'plausible', 'story', 'more', 'popular', 'legends', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'parts', 'story', 'were', 'little', 'rough', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'rate', '2004', 'King', 'Arthur', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '4', 'stars']",King Arthur

851564,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002YLCFQ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[8, 11]","After watching Troy, I figured King Arthur would be much of the same - a semi-historical retelling of a legend, minus the fantastical elements. I was half right.This is the King Arthur as historians imagine him to be. Not a thoroughly medieval knight, but a Roman military leader, struggling to retain control of Britain after the fall of Rome. Abandoned by his allies and surrounded on all sides by barbarians, Arthur must rally his infamous horsemen and apply Roman law to a lawless land.Well, at least that's what the History Channel told me. There's more to the plot. However, the plot was difficult to understand because of the extremely poor sound quality of the film. The audio crew obviously had some challenges, since the majority of the action takes place outdoors. Everyone mumbles every line, such that important points are lost.To wit, Artorius Castus (King Arthur, played by Clive Owen) is looking forward to releasing his Sarmatian foederati (his knights) from service after a long campaign of battling the natives. It's impossible to name who the natives are, because nobody ever pronounced their names clearly - research finally uncovered &quot;woads,&quot; but for a long time I thought it was &quot;vulgs&quot; or &quot;wolves&quot; or &quot;wrothes.&quot;In addition, the Saxons lurk north of a great wall that divides the civilized Roman world in Britain from the barbarian-types. The Saxons are ill defined, looking a bit like Norse Vikings but not actually called Vikings. Which is odd, given that every other character tied to the Arthurian legend IS given his &quot;proper&quot; name, even when it makes no sense for said character to have said name.Cerdric (Stellan Skarsgard) leads the Saxons, a Really Bad Guy &trade;. Or at least, he's supposed to be a bad guy. Instead, he settles for whispering every line in a gravelly voice that's supposed to convince us Cerdric, and indeed all the Saxons, are awful, wicked people who deserve to die.With the Saxons on the move and the Woads getting bolder every day, Artorius just wants to go home. If this plot sounds familiar, it's because every semi-historical movie has been trying to capture the success of Gladiator, including mimicking the plot. It doesn't work here.Unfortunately, a badly accented Italian bishop comes to deliver news that the knights have one more mission before they will be released back to Rome. It's a rescue mission to a governor's son, who is right in the path of the rampaging Saxons.The Saxons are such bad guys that even the Woads, led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), figure they have a better chance at uniting with the foreign occupation, so they decide to make peace with Arthur against a common enemy. It doesn't hurt that Guinevere (played by a wild-eyed Keira Knightley) improves Roman/Woad relations by sleeping with Arthur. Knightley plays Guinevere with wild-eyed abandon, a supposedly ferocious hellcat who can take out Saxons half-naked and with a thin sword. She simply doesn't have the physical presence to pull it off.After rescuing the boy, Arthur and his knights are faced with a difficult choice: leave the land they now call home for a homeland they can barely remember, or fight and probably die to defend their new home.There are so many knights who are all scruffy and dark-haired that they blur together. To help distinguish each character, they are given a fighting style and a weapon - none of which strive for even a smidgen of historical accuracy. One knight fights with spiked knuckles, another with two long swords, a third in a rapier style, another with a saber, one with a club, etc. None of this would be a problem if it weren't for the long text intro (and advertising) that proclaims this movie is based on historical fact.For reasons that only the writers can explain, Sir Bors (Ray Winstone) is by far the most charismatic character and has the most lines - even more than Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). Bors was a relatively minor character in Arthurian legend, but apparently his comic relief was sorely needed in a film that takes itself far too seriously.Lancelot exchanges glances with Guinevere and there's plenty of jokes implying he's a womanizer, but no romance. Bors talks a lot about his own prowess in bed, his family, and his home. Galahad (Hugh Dancy) and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) argue with each other a lot (and since they're brothers, it often seems like one actor arguing with himself).Throughout the story, we discover Arthur is a Christian and his knights are not. But even Arthur thinks a little differently - he follows the teachings of Pelagius, a Celtic monk who believed in free will. When Pelagius is banished excommunicated, Arthur seriously rethinks returning to Rome.There's a lot of talk about religion and ethics in the treatment of the Woads, of prisoners, and the knights, but none of it is portrayed with any real emotion. The combat scenes are disjointed, probably to keep the movie to a PG-13 rating. At least Troy had the guts to go for an R rating and show combat in all its gory detail.King Arthur has all the horrible attributes of First Knight, barely resembling the myth from which its characters are named. And yet it hides behind the accuracy of supposed historical research, which quickly falls apart upon examination (and watching the History Channel).In the end, the most exciting scene is a battle against the Saxons on an ice-covered lake. Good stuff, certainly enough to be entertaining. But it could have been so much more.King Arthur is like Troy without Brad Pitt. It has all the will and none of the acting ability, directorial talent, or plot to back it up.",3,Like Troy without Brad Pitt,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,5642,"['watching', 'Troy', 'figured',

Smith,"[4, 10]","This has got to be the most bizarre, the most unhistorical, and -- let's face it -- the silliest interpretation of the Arthur story that has ever groped its way to the screen. Arthur is so besotted with Rome that he dresses as a Roman cavalryman? (But with a legionary's infantry helmet.) The Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatians? Merlin is a Celt who paints himself blue? Guinevere is an Amazon? Rome is the protector of freedom? The Britons are all for ""liberty"" and ""free will""? And the Britons, Sarmatians, Romans, and Saxons all speak the same language? (They don't even bother to pretend otherwise.) Gimme a break. Not to mention that the Saxons, not being stupid, invaded England from the south and never did reach Hadrian's Wall. The plot jumps from a time when the Sarmatians first arrive as recruits in the north of England (though they never actually fight as Romans) and Arthur is just a boy, to a scene fifteen years later, when Arthur (who, for some reason, was promised command when he was young) is running the whole show. From what everyone says, all the exciting battles took place years earlier and killed off most of the knights, so this, apparently, is their swan song. Though by skipping over those years, the director also never gives us a reason why the survivors should be so loyal to Arthur. There are a couple of good battle sequences, though the fight on the ice is dramatically superior to the big climax -- in which the Britons are suddenly in possession of artillery engines. And Keira Knightly is nice to look at -- though she's far too skinny to be convincing as a sword-swinging warrior. The only halfway believable character, in fact, is Cerdic, the Saxon chief, played menacingly by Stellan Skarsgaard. All in all, though, this film is just pathetic.",2,A remarkably SILLY film,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1791,"['got', 'be', 'most', 'bizarre', 'most', 'unhistorical', 'let', 'face', 'silliest', 'interpretation', 'Arthur', 'story', 'ever', 'groped', 'way', 'screen', 'Arthur', 'so', 'besotted', 'Rome', 'Roman', 'cavalryman', 'legionary', 'infantry', 'helmet', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'are', 'Sarmatians', 'Merlin', 'Celt', 'who', 'blue', 'Guinevere', 'Amazon', 'Rome', 'protector', 'freedom', 'Britons', 'are', 'liberty', 'free', 'will', 'Britons', 'Sarmatians', 'Romans', 'Saxons', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'Gim', 'break', 'Not', 'mention', 'Saxons', 'not', 'being', 'stupid', 'invaded', 'England', 'south', 'never', 'did', 'reach', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'plot', 'jumps', 'time', 'when', 'Sarmatians', 'first', 'arrive', 'recruits', 'north', 'England', 'never', 'actually', 'fight', 'Romans', 'Arthur', 'just', 'boy', 'scene', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Arthur', 'who', 'reason', 'was', 'promised', 'command', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'running', 'whole', 'show', 'what', 'everyone', 'exciting', 'battles', 'took', 'place', 'years', 'earlier', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'knights', 'apparently', 'swan', 'song', 'skipping', 'years', 'director', 'also', 'never', 'reason', 'why', 'survivors', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'loyal', 'Arthur', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'battle', 'sequences', 'fight', 'ice', 'dramatically', 'superior', 'big', 'climax', 'Britons', 'are', 'suddenly', 'possession', 'artillery', 'engines', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'nice', 'look', 'far', 'too', 'skinny', 'be', 'convincing', 'sword-swinging', 'warrior', 'only', 'halfway', 'believable', 'character', 'fact', 'Cerdic', 'Saxon', 'chief', 'played', 'menacingly', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'though', 'film', 'just', 'pathetic']",King Arthur
851566,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B0002YLCFQ,Michael Zuffa,"[3, 6]","Coming off of last year's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", Disney's hopes had to be high for Jerry Bruckheimer's supposed factual retelling of the Arthur legend in ""King Arthur"".  Instead, they get something that is hit and miss, no doubt in part to a studio mandated editing that turned a n R-rated violent and bloody movie into a PG-13 family affair.Arthur (Owen), is presented as Arturius, a commander for the Roman empire.  On the brink of gaining freedom for himself and his knights, he rescues Guenivere (Knightley), turns on Rome, and alighns with the Guenivere's people, the Woads.  Eventually, this turn will lead to him becoming the ruler of all the Britons.This movie is filled with action and fighting, but as I mentioned earlier, it has been toned down and sometimes feels choppy.  Clive Owen does not have enough screen presence or noteriety to carry the role of Arthur.  Kiera Knightley is most likely the only recognizable name in the cast to Americans, and she does not show up until almost halfway through the film.  She also seems to be a little too small to be wielding the swords that she does, especially against some very large men.  I like the idea of Guenivere being a warrior, but perhaps they should have chosen someone that fits the part.Perhaps I nitpick too much, but this movie for the most part did little for me.  That fault does not lie on any one person's head, and perhaps I will have a different opinion when the R-rated version comes out on DVD, probably this fall.",3,King Arthur,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1498,"['Coming', 'off', 'last', 'year', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Disney', 'hopes', 'had', 'be', 'high', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'supposed', 'factual', 'retelling', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Instead', 'get', 'something', 'hit', 'doubt', 'part', 'studio', 'mandated', 'editing', 'turned', 'n', 'R-rated', 'violent', 'bloody', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'family', 'affair.Arthur', 'Owen', 'presented', 'Arturius', 'commander', 'Roman', 'empire', 'brink', 'gaining', 'freedom', 'knights', 'Guenivere', 'Knightley', 'Rome', 'alighns', 'Guenivere', 'people', 'Woads', 'Eventually', 'turn', 'will', 'lead', 'becoming', 'ruler', 'Britons.This', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'fighting', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'choppy', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'presence', 'noteriety', 'carry', 'role', 'Arthur', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'most', 'likely', 'only', 'recognizable', 'name', 'cast', 'Americans', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'almost', 'halfway', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'small', 'be', 'wielding', 'swords', 'especially', 'very', 'large', 'men', 'like', 'idea', 'Guenivere', 'being', 'warrior', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'someone', 'part.Perhaps', 'nitpick', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'little', 'fault', 'not', 'lie', 'one', 'person', 'head', 'perhaps', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'when', 'R-rated', 'version', 'out', 'DVD', 'probably', 'fall']",King Arthur
851567,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0002YLCFQ,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 3]","What would the summer season be without another action-packed adventure flick from Jerry Bruckheimer? Since Top Gun officially deemed him one of the leading producers in the summer of 1986 (though, to his credit, it was Beverly Hills Cop that really kicked his career into high gear), he has revved up the careers of such current super-stars as Tom Cruise (Top Gun and Days of Thunder), Will Smith (Bad Boys and Enemy of the State), Nicholas Cage (The Rock, Con-Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds), and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) as well as director Michael Bay, with whom he has worked with on five feature films over the years. And don?t think that time has had effect on his ability to keep turning out hits, not only in the theaters but television as well, or his ability to make stars of his films into leading actors and actresses. He hopes to add Clive Owen onto his already extensive list of accomplishments in Hollywood with the historical take on the Arthurian legend.The story for this telling of the adventures of King Arthur takes away the mythological aspect and place emphasis more on the historical roots that led to the creation of the legend centuries later. Arthur is the leader of a group of loyal knights in the service of the Roman Empire and one who only wishes to finally fulfill his obligation to the Empire and return to the city of Rome to live out the rest of his life in peace. But times have changed; the once great empire that was Rome has become dangerously corrupt and now faces the threat from Barbarian tribes like the Saxons who kill anything and anyone in their way. Those Saxon tribes now have their eyes set on Britannia and Arthur, along with his knights, are sent on one last mission for Rome, which is to bring the favorite godson of the Pope of the Catholic Church to safety. But while accomplishing his final task for the Romans, the realization that the once great center of civilization is gone sets in and Arthur comes to decision that he must take up arms with his former enemies in order to unite the people of Britannia and repel the Saxon force that has invaded their homeland. The story for King Arthur seems rather lifeless and bland when one compares it to the legend on which it is based but taking it for what it is, a historically tweaked version of the story, it is at least a noble effort, if not one that comes off more mediocre then the filmmakers would want. The problem is that Hollywood is devoting too much time and effort into grand historical epics, referring to the lack-luster Troy earlier this year, when they should be putting more thought into bringing the legends to life, not through historical context but through the full-realization of the myths themselves and what they stood for those who heard them.The feature?s lack of star power is not its primary draw-backs, in fact it?s one of the its better assets, but rather the blame can be transfixed on the script?s undeveloped and, at times, meaningless characters. Clive Owen takes his first leap onto the main stage as the historical equivalent to the legendary King Arthur, known as Arturius, and produces one of the film?s best performances. Despite an exhilarating performance given by Owen, the audience is often left confused as to the just end Arthur is seeking. At one point, he fights for the Romans, but with the empire crumbling and the realization that his utopia doesn?t exist, he shifts course ? if only the filmmakers informed us what that is. Obviously at the end, everything comes together and the goal Arthur was seeking becomes, but unfortunately it comes too late for us to put too much emotional investment in the film?s climatic battle sequence to care all that much. Keira Knightley?s role as Guinevere is another in which there is confusion placed on the movie-goers as to certain actions that are placed around her. For example, what is her exact relationship with the tribal leader Merlin? In one scene she leads Arthur into a clearing in which the tribal leaders comes out to speak to him about the invading Saxons ? Is she his daughter or just a loyal tribal follower? And what was the sole purpose of Ioan Gruffudd?s Lancelot? He?s suppose to be Arthur?s most devoted follower but often he comes off as whiny and too much of annoyance. And is the whole Lancelot glancing at Guinvere every now and again the best the filmmakers could do into incorporating the Guinvere and Lancelot adultery aspect of the myth into this story? It?s not romantic but rather creepy and flat.Overall, for those who had grown up reading about the legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the Jerry Bruckheimer spectacular may come as disappointment, not so much as to the point of echoing Warner Brothers? Troy, but rather for its less attractive approach to the legend. For the less informed individuals of this society not willing to venture to Spider-Man 2 for the twentieth time in a week, King Arthur at least offers itself as a reasonable, if not an inferior, alternative. When Jerry Bruckheimer originally envisioned the film, he had planned on a no-holds barred blood, sweat and tears aspect of the Arthurian legend but unfortunately producers must bend to the whims of their studio masters, in this case Disney (can someone just dump Eisner already?), and so the wonderfully choreographed battle sequences are toned down to the level of PG-13 audiences in order to reap in more box office coin. As one can probably guess, the film, namely its action sequences, suffer severely because of this ? perhaps if they had left out a ?love scene? between Guinvere and Arthur, which, considering their ages (Knightly ? 19, Owen ? 39), comes off as more disturbing then anything else, and the language had been toned down a bit, certain sequences could have been saved. Don?t get the idea that the film?s an utter mess; it?s actually quite decent if one understands the historical context in which the film is placed and isn?t expecting something on the level of Gladiator but more along the lines of the usual Bruckheimer diversion. It?s definitely a disappointment considering the amount of marketing blitz Arthur has been given and Bruckheimer?s 2003 summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, but if one goes in looking for a simple diversion for the summer, then you won?t come out demanding your money back at least.",3,The Moose Hole - Yet Another Legend Left in Ruin,1090454400,"07 22,

851569,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002YLCFQ,mirasreviews,"[7, 9]","""King Arthur"" is the first film to attempt to place the legend of King Arthur in its proper historical timeframe. Although King Arthur's legend gained popularity in the late Middle Ages, it refers to the exploits of an unknown warrior-king in Britain of late antiquity. In ""King Arthur"", screenwriter David Franzoni makes Arthur out to be a Roman-Briton Commander of a group of Sarmatian knights who act as a sort of special forces unit to protect Roman interests in 5th century Britain. As the Roman Empire plans to pull out of Britain, leaving the native population and invading Saxons to fight it out, the visiting Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) gives Arthur (Clive Owen) a final order. He and his 6 knights are to escort a Roman family to safety whose estate is in the path of the Saxon General Cerdic's (Stellan Skarsgard) ruthless advance. The Woads (normally called Picts), a Celtic people whose relentless attacks have Rome on the run, share Arthur's disdain for the Saxons. So politics makes strange bedfellows, then as it does now.Contrary to the film's hype, ""King Arthur"" isn't attempting to be historically accurate. Although it is generally accepted that the source of Arthurian legend was a king and/or military leader of late antiquity, the identity of this person is hotly disputed. To my knowledge, there are 3 major schools of thought on the subject and some minor ones. King Arthur is thought to have been either: Lucius Artorius Castus, a 2nd century Roman stationed at Hadrian's wall who commanded a group of Sarmatian cavalry, as King Arthur does in this movie. Or, Ambrosius Aurelianus, who led the pivotal defeat of the Saxons at Badon Hill circa 500 A.D., as Arthur does here. Or, Riothamus, a 5th century British king. King Arthur is an amalgamated legend, in the way that the legends of Robin Hood or Black Beard started with one person and were amended with the exploits of others as the centuries passed. The fact that Sarmatians were cavalry and their tradition of being buried with their swords at the head of the grave leads one to believe that these warriors were, indeed, the inspiration for much of the mythology surrounding knights of the realm. The legendary King Arthur won 12 battles, including the Battle of Badon Hill, as Ambrosius Aurelianus did. These 2 men, who lived 3 centuries apart, are both Arthur. But the story, itself, that is presented in ""King Arthur"" is fiction.As for the movie, ""King Arthur"" may be the murkiest film I have ever seen. Many scenes take place at night., but those in daylight aren't much brighter. I might have wondered how it is possible to make a snowscape dark, if I had not learned from the bonus features that it was done with CGI. It's unfortunate that so much detail is hidden in shadow, but it does create an oppressive effect. Britain looks very cold and very dark in every frame. The blue body dye that the Picts traditionally donned in battle is one of those little pieces of history that just begs to be filmed. But it would have had more visual impact had the lighting been more realistic. The Picts actually didn't wear clothes with their paint, and why they are called ""Woads"" in this film is a mystery to me.""King Arthur""'s performances are fine but unremarkable. The knights are probably the most interesting characters, but they are usually in the periphery. Acclaimed character actor Ray Winstone entertains with a nice over-the-top performance of Bors, the loudest knight. Some fine European actors were corralled for foreign roles, but they are given little to do. The fabulous Stellan Skarsgard is the Saxon General Cerdic. I've always thought that Skarsgard could make any character believable, and maybe he does as much with Cerdic's few lines as is possible. Somehow he gives the man weight by whispering all the time. But Cerdic still comes across as a one-dimensional villain -although a scary one.There is a lot of very modern talk of ""freedom"". As is common in period pieces, these are conspicuously contemporary characters in an ancient drama. So ""King Arthur"" is not intended to be a historical document. Its grittiness and modern ideals turn the shiny Arthurian legend on its end and attempt to create an interpretation of the myth that strikes a chord in the 21st century. I don't think it succeeds in that. The script just isn't very good, the characters poorly drawn, their actions incomprehensible, the situations implausible, and the whole thing is drab and overprocessed. But ""King Arthur"" is an  action film, even if it isn't anything more, and I enjoyed it at that level.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, a roundtable discussion with cast and crew, an alternate ending, an optional trivia track while viewing the film, a photo gallery, and an audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua. In ""Blood on the Land: Forging King Arthur"" (18 minutes) the cast, principle crew, director Antoine Fuqua, and a historical consultant comment on the origins of the King Arthur legend, the film's characters, and the sets. ""Cast & Filmmaker Roundtable"" (16 minutes) is a discussion of Arthurian legend, the movie, and filming by screenwriter David Fanzoni, Keira Knightley, Clive Owen, director Antoine Fuqua, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), and Hugh Dancy (Galahad). The ""Alternate Ending: Badon Hill"" (4 minutes) puts a slightly different philosophical spin on the death of the knights in battle. It's too contrived, even for a fairy tale. Skip it. ""Knight Vision"" allows you to enable an optional track of subtitles that provide production and historical trivia during the movie. The ""Producer's Photo Gallery"" includes color and black-and-white stills. If you insert th DVD into your XBox, you can view a ""King Arthur XBox Game Demo"". In the audio commentary, director Antoine Fuqua talks about making the film and the meaning that the story of King Arthur holds for him.",3,"Only Slightly Less Fictional than

The two main guy characters were just godawful, yet  you could tell they were good actors, they were just being told what to do wrongly.  I can't say that anyone was as glaring as these guys, but it is amazing how they stand out as being the leads and all, yet the supporting actors are really leaving you with the feeling of wanting to know more about them.So once again, not the greatest battle sequences, but then again that is when most of the actors shined through the most.So the retelling was done in an awfully quick manner, but it is still a pretty cool looking movie at least.Also i have the directors cut and haven't seen the regular version, but this one is certainly worth a watch.

We saw Glastonbury (where some monks dubiously claimed to have found the bones of u-no-who).  Amesbury, where Guinevere was exiled to a nunnery (no nunnery here, however, or other 6th c. ruins).  We saw Camelot - a flat-topped hill that was the site of a long-gone stone age fort.  It was a beautiful day, even sunny, a rarity for the area.  No trace of a castle though. I had read Morris' ""Age of Arthur"" and understood fully that Arthur was a dimly-documented 6th century figure that may have checked the Anglo-Saxon advance on the Romano-Britons, but not the silver-armoured knight of 14th century hagiography. And what was I thinking sitting on the hill at Camelot? All that I could hear going through my head was Richard Harris singing from that ridiculous Broadway tune, ""Camelot! Camelot! Where we write the legal laws!""  My mind was filled with media gunk!So I was ready for ""King Arthur"" which in ads promised to tell the real story of King Arthur as the savior of the Britons against the invading Saxons - getting the chronology rolled back to something close to the 6th c.(assuming the guy lived at all).  What do we get?  Some concession to history, but otherwise your typical bearskins and clubs Hollywood mush.  I'd like to beleive, really. But:1.  Assuming spotty 8th century records are accurate (a leap of faith), Arthur would have been somewhere in the late 5th to 6th century AD.  The movie has him as a Roman legionary or auxillary. Probably not. The Roman legions left the island for good around AD 410 to save what was left of the colapsing Empire and fight the incessant civil wars.  Whoever was left would have been worrying about the Saxon Shore and interior settlements, not Hadrian's Wall which was long abandoned.  This Arthur is depicted as a foreign auxilary from the Russian steppes, so, let's give a pass here.2.  The movie's reference to the Arian heresy is nice, but the victory of the Roman church did not result in an early Spanish inquisition agianst everyone else as indicated. There were too many other sects (e.g. Mithras) still around. I also don't think personal or nationalist freedom was a selling point for either Christian sect - this is about 14 centuries too soon.  Which leads to...3.  The idiot Roman villa NORTH of Hadrian's wall?? In the 5th century? And the owner has an Italian accent?4.  Guenevere is certainly a dish in her peak-a-boo leather warrior outfit. I saw somthing like it in a shop in San Francisco on Duboce.  Not exactly Sir Mallory here, that's for sure.Unfortunately, too much of the movie consists of crowded battle scenes between the Mad-Max/Conan attired Saxons (grunt, kill), Arthur's soldiers, and the ""Woads"" whom I suspect are Picts. These battles are noisy and nothing special, but take up way too much of the movie, drowning out the few attempts to establish an alternative history.This is realy quite harmless fun, as about as historically accurate as Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"", but it looks like Hollywood's  brainwashing a la Mallory will remain.  The most watchable Arthurian movie remains Boorman's ""Excalibur"", with a real Merlin instead of the nonentity in King Arthur.  And Venessa Redgrave will always be Guinevere to me.I do recommend Berkeley author Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""Mists of Avalon"" (not the silly made-for TV movie, but the book) for an  alternative take on the Arthur legend.",3,Camelot!

851586,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0002YLCFQ,Nicholas Carroll,"[3, 6]","I missed this film when it came to theaters, because it disappeared so quickly.  This was one of the summer releases in 2004 that I was most looking forward to see, because there hasn't been a major film that I'm aware of that covers the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Roundtable.  When it was released on DVD, I took a gamble in buying it, since I'd never seen it previously.  I thought no one could mess up a film like this, but I was wrong.  This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced watching a film, and its not like I had huge expectations before I watched it.  I was looking forward to seeing a big screen treatment of King Arthur that was equal to if not better than the film version of ""Robin Hood"" (the Kevin Costner film that unfortunately doesn't hold up well with the passage of time).  Like another film reviewer said, this one is not ""Gladiator"" or even ""Troy"".  I would even say that this isn't even ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" or ""A Knight's Tale"".The main problem I have with this film is probably all of the battle scenes.  The filmmakers probably didn't count on the audience fatigue of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, in which the battle scenes were exceptionally well done in all three films.  After that trilogy, epic films centered on battle scenes aren't going to captivate audiences, so that's probably the biggest flaw this film made.  Had they focused more on the interpersonal drama and storytelling through dialogue and human interactions, it would have made a much better film.Unfortunately, this film lacks warmth of any kind.  The scenes are dark and dreary, which is perfect for mood setting, but a whole film like that?  There is little sense of humor or funny dialogue that lightens the film, instead we get a treatment of Arthur that is entirely too serious.  It moves along slowly, and the entire plot rests on three key battle scenes...one in the opening, one in the middle and the big finale.  I would have preferred to see more of the intellect of King Arthur, how he related to people and why he became a legend...something beyond his display of courage and strength on the battlefields.  There's more to King Arthur than violence and killing of enemies, but we just don't see it.The reason I give it two stars is because I like Clive Owen and the flaws of this film are in no way attributed to him.  He is a perfect King Arthur, in an imperfect movie.  The second star goes to one of the best scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  The middle battle scene that takes place on a frozen lake is clever, original, and exceptionally well done.  Its the only thing worth seeing in this film, unfortunately, but it is something to watch with marvel.  Too bad they didn't spend more time making the rest of the film worth watching.  I guess someone should send a memo to Hollywood:  epic films with little more than battle scenes are box office bombs.  If you don't believe me...look at the disappointing returns of ""King Arthur"" and ""Alexander"".  ""Troy"" is marginally better because the story worked.  However, after the brillant success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I'd say that people are just battle-worn-out.  Let the genre rest a few years.  When you've seen one battle scene, you pretty much seen them all, and there's no reason why any movie should base its whole plot on three key battle scenes.  That tells you right there there isn't a story worth telling, so they should go back to the drawing board until they get a story that's worth telling that doesn't rely so much on battles as it does on the wits and conversations that carry better films.",2,Hugely disappointing,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,3642,"['missed', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'theaters', 'disappeared', 'so', 'quickly', 'was', 'one', 'summer', '2004', 'was', 'most', 'looking', 'forward', 'see', ""n't"", 'been', 'major', 'film', ""'m"", 'aware', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'Roundtable', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'took', 'gamble', 'buying', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'previously', 'thought', 'one', 'could', 'mess', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'wrong', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'had', 'huge', 'expectations', 'watched', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'equal', 'not', 'better', 'film', 'version', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'film', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'passage', 'time', 'film', 'reviewer', 'said', 'one', 'not', 'Gladiator', 'even', 'Troy', 'would', 'even', 'say', ""n't"", 'even', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'Knight', 'Tale', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'probably', 'battle', 'scenes', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'audience', 'fatigue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'three', 'films', 'trilogy', 'epic', 'films', 'centered', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'captivate', 'audiences', 'probably', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'made', 'Had', 'focused', 'more', 'interpersonal', 'drama', 'storytelling', 'dialogue', 'human', 'interactions', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'film.Unfortunately', 'film', 'warmth', 'kind', 'scenes', 'are', 'dark', 'dreary', 'perfect', 'mood', 'setting', 'whole', 'film', 'little', 'sense', 'humor', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'film', 'instead', 'get', 'treatment', 'Arthur', 'entirely', 'too', 'serious', 'along', 'slowly', 'entire', 'plot', 'rests', 'three', 'key', 'battle', 'scenes', 'one', 'opening', 'one', 'middle', 'big', 'finale', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'intellect', 'King', 'Arthur', 'how', 'related', 'people', 'why', 'became', 'legend', 'something', 'display', 'courage', 'strength', 'battlefields', 'more', 'King', 'Arthur', 'violence', 'killing', 'enemies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'it.The', 'reason', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'like', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'attributed', 'perfect', 'King', 'Arthur', 'imperfect', 'movie', 'second', 'star', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'middle', 'battle', 'scene', 'place', 'frozen', 'lake', 'clever', 'original', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'something', 'watch', 'marvel', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'making', 'rest', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'guess', 'someone', 'should', 'send', 'memo', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'films', 'little', 'more', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'box', 'office', 'bombs', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'look', 'disappointing', 'returns', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Alexander', 'Troy', 'marginally', 'better', 'story', 'worked', 'However', 'brillant', 'success', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', ""'d"", 'say', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'battle-worn-out', 'Let', 'genre', 'rest', 'few', 'years', 'When', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'battle', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'should', 'base', 'whole', 'plot', 'three', 'key', 'battle', 'scenes', 'right', ""n't"", 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'drawing', 'board', 'get', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', ""n't"", 'rely', 'so', 'much', 'battles', 'wits', 'conversations', 'carry', 'better', 'films']",King Arthur

851590,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B0002YLCFQ,No one of consequence,"[2, 2]","I watched this movie over the weekend and, although it brings a new and interesting perspective to the Arthurian legend, I found myself uninspired and unimpressed by the effort.  From the opening scenes of the movie, the viewer cannot help but be reminded of ""Braveheart"", with its portrayals of the harsh, primitive life of Britain during the dark ages.  ""King Arthur"" attempts to recreate the same panoramic, epic feel as Mel Gibson's hit movie, but aside from the foggy countryside and a somewhat gritty view of life, there's really very little resemblance between the two films.On the plus side, I enjoyed getting a new take on the same old story.  No Camelot or holy grail in this version.  Yes, the round table makes it's appearance in a few scenes, but not with the same grand pomp and heraldry that we have become accustomed to seeing.  Arthur (played by Clive Owen) is the commander of a dwindling group of Sarmatian knights who trace their lineage back several generations to the survivors of a battle against the Roman army.  The Sarmatians' lives were spared in return for their, and their sons', oath of service to Rome.  This group of knights, including familiar names like Lancelot, Galahad and Gawain, are the latest generation to fulfill their duties under this oath.Arthur and his men are not pictured initially as the classic group of noble warriors, but as a rough-and-tumble band who are counting down the days until the end of their 15-year service requirement.  On the day before their discharge, however, they receive orders for one last mission -- to rescue the family of a Roman nobleman from the wrong side of Hadrian's Wall, just as a large Saxon army is invading from that direction.During this mission, Arthur finds his loyalties divided between his oath to Rome and the drive of his heart to help all men realize and live out their God-given liberty.  In particular, he is asked to assume leadership of the savage Wold nation, now led by Merlin, in their defense against the coming Saxon invasion.  He also meets Gwenyvere, a rather tough and saucy Wold warrior maiden, not at all what the viewer would expect from the usual legends.Ultimately Arthur gains freedom for himself and his surviving knights, but he feels compelled to live for ""a higher purpose"" rather than for himself.  Thus his character is essentially modelled on Mel Gibson's William Wallace, as he leads the battle for liberation.  The general tenor of the story is one of heroism, sacrifice and nobility of spirit.Now for the negatives.  I thought the story was simply not very compelling, or very grand in its scale, as the entire plot revolves around only two events -- the mission beyond the wall, and a single battle to repel the Saxon invasion (the latter being most unrealistic).  Although the movie has the obligatory happy ending, I thought the story cut off rather abruptly.  Also, there was a little too much emotional sap in a number of the scenes for my taste, especially during Arthur's motivational speeches.  In these scenes, Clive Owen hams it up and frankly makes these scenes seem a bit corny.  The combat scenes were generally well done, with some blood but generally toned down violence -- i.e. no serious carnage as in ""Braveheart"".  While this makes the movie a little more kid-friendly, it steals away much of the sense of realism from an otherwise semi-believable story.Overall, this isn't a particularly bad movie but it certainly failed in its attempt to be a great movie.  It's worth watching once, I suppose, but once was enough for me.",3,"Tries to imitate ""Braveheart"" but comes up way short.",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,3564,"['watched', 'movie', 'weekend', 'new', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'found', 'uninspired', 'unimpressed', 'effort', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'Braveheart', 'portrayals', 'harsh', 'primitive', 'life', 'Britain', 'dark', 'ages', 'King', 'Arthur', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'same', 'panoramic', 'epic', 'feel', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'hit', 'movie', 'aside', 'foggy', 'countryside', 'somewhat', 'gritty', 'view', 'life', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'resemblance', 'two', 'films.On', 'plus', 'side', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'new', 'take', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'Camelot', 'holy', 'grail', 'version', 'Yes', 'round', 'table', 'appearance', 'few', 'scenes', 'not', 'same', 'grand', 'pomp', 'heraldry', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'Arthur', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'commander', 'dwindling', 'group', 'Sarmatian', 'knights', 'who', 'trace', 'lineage', 'back', 'several', 'generations', 'survivors', 'battle', 'Roman', 'army', 'Sarmatians', 'lives', 'were', 'spared', 'return', 'sons', 'oath', 'service', 'Rome', 'group', 'knights', 'including', 'familiar', 'names', 'Lancelot', 'Galahad', 'Gawain', 'are', 'latest', 'generation', 'fulfill', 'duties', 'oath.Arthur', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'pictured', 'initially', 'classic', 'group', 'noble', 'warriors', 'rough-and-tumble', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'counting', 'down', 'days', 'end', '15-year', 'service', 'requirement', 'day', 'discharge', 'however', 'receive', 'orders', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'rescue', 'family', 'Roman', 'nobleman', 'wrong', 'side', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'just', 'large', 'Saxon', 'army', 'invading', 'direction.During', 'mission', 'Arthur', 'loyalties', 'divided', 'oath', 'Rome', 'drive', 'heart', 'help', 'men', 'realize', 'live', 'out', 'God-given', 'liberty', 'particular', 'asked', 'assume', 'leadership', 'savage', 'Wold', 'nation', 'now', 'led', 'Merlin', 'defense', 'coming', 'Saxon', 'invasion', 'also', 'Gwenyvere', 'rather', 'tough', 'saucy', 'Wold', 'warrior', 'maiden', 'not', 'what', 'viewer', 'would', 'expect', 'usual', 'legends.Ultimately', 'Arthur', 'gains', 'freedom', 'surviving', 'knights', 'compelled', 'live', 'higher', 'purpose', 'rather', 'Thus', 'character', 'essentially', 'modelled', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'William', 'Wallace', 'battle', 'liberation', 'general', 'tenor', 'story', 'one', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'nobility', 'spirit.Now', 'negatives', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'very', 'grand', 'scale', 'entire', 'plot', 'revolves', 'only', 'two', 'events', 'mission', 'wall', 'single', 'battle', 'repel', 'Saxon', 'invasion', 'latter', 'being', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'obligatory', 'happy', 'ending', 'thought', 'story', 'cut', 'off', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'Also', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'sap', 'number', 'scenes', 'taste', 'especially', 'Arthur', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'scenes', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'hams', 'up', 'frankly', 'scenes', 'seem', 'bit', 'corny', 'combat', 'scenes', 'were', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'blood', 'generally', 'toned', 'down', 'violence', 'i.e', 'serious', 'carnage', 'Braveheart', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'kid-friendly', 'away', 'much', 'sense', 'realism', 'otherwise', 'semi-believable', 'story.Overall', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'bad', 'movie', 'certainly', 'failed', 'attempt', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'suppose', 'once', 'was', 'enough']",King Arthur

851592,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B0002YLCFQ,Octavius,"[8, 8]","A rather mediocre attempt at bringing to light the mythological origins of King Arthur undermined by a pathetic script and horrible screenplay. In addition, the history portrayed in the film is tentative at best and most historians studying the Arthurian myth wouldn't be so hasty to draw the conclusions presented in the film.First, in terms of the film itself, it was rather mediocre. The plot is a standard Hollywood formula of that is completely predictable in the first 5 minutes of the film. The script was simply indicative reciting the obvious in addition to gratuitous jingoisms where the characters yell 'freedom!', 'liberty!', 'our rights!', etc. I didn't know Arthur was Thomas Jefferson. Although the film quality was very good, the editing wasn't that great and rather generic: overly long scenes showing the Saxons marching like Nazis (just to remind you that they're the bad guys) with their chief whose just a Hitler-like character who wants to exterminate everything (just to remind you he's the arch-villain.) The actors didn't seem very thrilled about their script and just recited what was given to them on paper without much enthusiasm. I give credit to the battle scenes though, they were rather good: especially the one on the frozen lake. One final weak point is that one can clearly see this film's cheap attempts at capitalizing on Riddley Scott's superior 'Gladiator' with similar editing for the battle scenes and almost identical music: hardly a mark of creativity on the part of those who worked on/marketed this film.As for the historical theories proposed in the film, don't be deceived by D.H. Franzoni's commentary about the research involved in this film as the theories he relies on have many flaws that simply don't add up. In terms of historical accuracy, the film is correct in showing that, as most historians now believe, Arthur was a Celt-Roman leader in Britain who lived during the collapse of the Western Roman Empire c.450-475 A.D. and, that he led a military/political movement to fight off the increasing migrations of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, that were coming to Britain from modern-day Denmark and northern Germany. Contrary to D.H. Franzoni's claim, Lucius Artorius Castus is not a likely candidate as historical evidence places him under Marcus Aurelius/Commodus' reign c. 180 A.D.: 270 years before Arthur is commonly accepted as having existed. In addition to that improbability, the claim that the Holy Grail, The Lady of the Lake, etc. are undoubtedly the product of Sarmatian culture is false and a product of pure conjecture. The Holy Grail is a Christian symbol that had been around for 450 years in the Roman Empire and such symbols were introduced to Britain and Ireland by evangelists such as St. Patrick. Dragons, Merlin, The Lady of the Lake, and Excalibur, is stronger evidence of Celtic/Druidic rites than anything else; also, if members of Arthur's entourage were Sarmatian, why do they all have Celtic/Roman/Germanic names such as Artorius, Ulfius, Galahad, Tristan, Gawayne, Uther, Vortigen, Morgana, Mordred, etc., etc., etc. All of the characters in Arthurian myth have Celtic, Roman, or Germanic names: not Sarmatian ones. Legends of the Green Knight in Arthurian myth have little to do with Sarmatians and more to do with Celtic mythology. In addition, most of the battles, forts, and characters of Arthurian myths are recited as being in Wales and southern England which is where most of the myths come from, not Scotland where Hadrian's wall is located: presumably there's a reason for that. It is also important to note that most of the Celtic revival and geopolitical expansion at that time was focused in southern Britain and Brittany in northern France as evidenced by multiple Celtic settlements and forts: not Northern England as shown in the film.Again, this film is rather mediocre in terms of its screenplay and acting while its script is rather pathetic in terms of its generic dialogues. The film has some good battle scenes. This may be a good movie to rent but, in my opinion, it's not worth owning. The only good Arthurian film in my opinion is John Boorman's 'Excalibur' as it cleverly combines the Romantic tale with Celtic mythology to bring a strange image of surrealism that works quite well for this genre.  The films 'First Knight' and 'Merlin' are the finest examples of bad film making and you're better off with this film instead.  Finally, for a more cautious historical approach to the Arthurian myth I would recommend Geoffrey Ashe's book 'The Discovery of King Arthur' in addition to the writers recommeded by D.H. Franzoni to get a balanced view on the many theories as to who Arthur may have been.",2,The Real King Arthur?,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,4705,"['rather', 'mediocre', 'attempt', 'bringing', 'light',

851594,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B0002YLCFQ,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[3, 8]","When you think about it, what is the collective conception of the Arthurian legend?Well, it's a myth, for one thing, and an achingly Pre-Raphaelite one at that: a sword magically buried in the stone; the lady of the lake holding aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water; the ambivalent wiles of Merlin, a magician who has slept under a rock for a hundred years; a Merovingian Easter-egg hunt for the Holy Grail; the nasty skulduggery of Merlin's sister Morgana Le Fay; and finally the illictly, tragically requited love between Guinevere and Lancelot. All good, stirring stuff, if you like that kind of thing.Now imagine how it would play if you took all of that away and were told instead that Arthur was a stony-faced Roman Centurion, his knights a band of cockney-sounding eastern European slaves (shades of an anarcho-syndicalist commune, I couldn't help thinking), Merlin a hairy, daubed (literally!) savage, and Guinevere a sort of skimpily attired, malnourished, blue, Xena Warrior Princess?Doesn't sound much chop, does it?And nor is it. (Well, all right, the skimpy warrior princess bit isn't *all* bad). It's not helped by less-than-imaginative borrowing from Braveheart, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, Black Hawk Down, and the Lord of the Rings instalments, nor the wheeling in of yet another member of Clannad to sing the theme tune, nor the credulity-taxing back story involving Sarmatian knights who, with Ray Winstone in their midst, sound more East London than East Europe.Fundamentally, the Arthur story is only interesting as romantic myth. Thus, David Franzoni's justification of the film's historical accuracy on this site misses the point: La Morte d'Arthur is a great story; King Arthur: The Director's Cut is not. By purporting to take all the hocus pocus away, Franzoni has jettisoned anything of any real interest or point (unless you're prepared to see this as some sort of allegory for the Iraq War and, frankly, I'm not).King Arthur ultimately can't hold a candle to Excalibur, and even that reading must pay fealty to the greatest exploration of the Arthurian legend of them all. Graham Chapman's remains the definitive Arthur, with or without the violence inherent in the system.Next.Olly Buxton",2,"Not derived from a farcical aquatic ceremony after all, then",1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2228,"['When', 'think', 'what', 'collective', 'conception', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'Well', 'myth', 'one', 'thing', 'achingly', 'Pre-Raphaelite', 'one', 'sword', 'magically', 'buried', 'stone', 'lady', 'lake', 'holding', 'aloft', 'Excalibur', 'bosom', 'water', 'ambivalent', 'wiles', 'Merlin', 'magician', 'who', 'slept', 'rock', 'hundred', 'years', 'Merovingian', 'Easter-egg', 'hunt', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'nasty', 'skulduggery', 'Merlin', 'sister', 'Morgana', 'Le', 'Fay', 'finally', 'illictly', 'tragically', 'requited', 'love', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'good', 'stirring', 'stuff', 'like', 'kind', 'thing.Now', 'imagine', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'took', 'away', 'were', 'told', 'instead', 'Arthur', 'was', 'stony-faced', 'Roman', 'Centurion', 'knights', 'band', 'cockney-sounding', 'eastern', 'European', 'slaves', 'shades', 'anarcho-syndicalist', 'commune', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Merlin', 'hairy', 'daubed', 'literally', 'savage', 'Guinevere', 'sort', 'skimpily', 'attired', 'malnourished', 'blue', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'chop', 'Well', 'right', 'skimpy', 'warrior', 'princess', 'bit', ""n't"", '*all*', 'bad', 'not', 'helped', 'less-than-imaginative', 'borrowing', 'Braveheart', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'instalments', 'wheeling', 'yet', 'member', 'Clannad', 'sing', 'theme', 'tune', 'credulity-taxing', 'back', 'story', 'involving', 'Sarmatian', 'knights', 'who', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'midst', 'sound', 'more', 'East', 'London', 'East', 'Europe.Fundamentally', 'Arthur', 'story', 'only', 'interesting', 'romantic', 'myth', 'Thus', 'David', 'Franzoni', 'justification', 'film', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'site', 'point', 'La', 'Morte', ""d'Arthur"", 'great', 'story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Director', 'Cut', 'not', 'purporting', 'take', 'hocus', 'pocus', 'away', 'Franzoni', 'jettisoned', 'anything', 'real', 'interest', 'point', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'see', 'sort', 'allegory', 'Iraq', 'War', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'not', '.King', 'Arthur', 'ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Excalibur', 'even', 'reading', 'must', 'pay', 'fealty', 'greatest', 'exploration', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'Graham', 'Chapman', 'definitive', 'Arthur', 'violence', 'inherent', 'system.Next.Olly', 'Buxton']",King Arthur

My feeling is, it just doesn't matter and as far as I am concerned let him remain a legend and if he's half Roman half something else does it really make any difference? This Arthur is a long way from Tennyson's Arthur in ""Idylls of the King"" which I adored as a teenager and still do. But a legend can assume any shape or form, and this rendition of Arthur as an early fighter for freedom of the individual man should be accepted along with all the other renditions.Guinivere as an archer along side Arthur in the thick of battle, yelling war-cries like everybody else, friend or foe, in definitely out of the box and I loved her! There are touching moments-scenes that will grab at your heart, such as Bors' wife singing a ballad to their baby. One scene I would have made more of is the boy Arthur's pulling the sword Excalibur out of a stone. But by and large you as viewer will go with the flow and have no difficulty emerging yourself into the plot, you are there.The photography is so extraordinary one should see this film on that basis alone. The film was shot in Ireland. In the winter the snowflakes come down rather lazily but soon the ground is covered. You watch those snowflakes settle in the horses' manes, in the hair of the men. The Saxons and Arthur's tiny band approach eachother over a river of ice which splinters under their weight and sends up great gushes of frigid water. The special effects here are simply superb as the men and horses struggle to keep from being sucked into the water. There are many other marvelously crafted scenes in the film, such as catapults that send torches of fire into the enemy lines.Cerdic, the Saxon chieftan, played by Stellar Skarsgard, almost steals the show. The portrayal is close to being hammy but Stellar has a grand time looming large ahead of his army and given to expressive, emotional glances to his men as well as enemy Arthur. Of course, Guinivere in the thick of battle with no armor to protect her is a bit ridiculous, but it doesn't matter. ""King Arthur"" is intense, thrilling, heroic!

851605,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0002YLCFQ,P. Hardy,"[2, 4]","I've been itching to watch this movie ever since I've seen the ending a billion times (unintentionally) and my mother -- in spite of my disregard towards the film being ""lame""-- suggested I watch the movie to boot. Two years later and a few more ""ending"" viewings later, I finally swallowed my pride and watched the movie. That aside, I have to say that ""King Arthur: Director's Cut,"" isn't a horrible movie as I would believed it to be, it coming from Jerry Bruckhimer and all (their Disney joined movies ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Remember the Titans"" are two favorites of mine ironically). It certainly takes a different path as opposed to all his summer blockbuster films of previous and present carnations. Instead ""Arthur"" takes the recently traveled path of the ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" road if anything. However, unlike GLADIATOR and BRAVEHEART the storyline for the movie is seriously lost in the blur of ""Based on actual events"" and is simply played out through a series of events that don't add up to what their supposed to. (Funnily enough the story for the film is even written by the same writer for ""Gladiator""). Venturing to a local Internet encyclopedia, I discover it is true that, yeah, the movie is full of inconsistencies of the historical kind, but what did anyone expect from a movie like this? If you drop the accurate history expectance, you'll enjoy the movie far more better. The narration at the beginning of the movie, --via Lancelot's disembodied voice--, sets the mood and upcoming tone of the film in general. Thus explaining the conquest of the Roman Empire and the recruiting of Sarmatian army and their sons as part of a bargain. Fast forward several years later, Arthur and his remaining Knights of the round table are riding across the plains of Britain towards a carriage in need of their help. This fight scene in particular is probably the best out of the whole lot of few action scenes in the entire movie. Plenty of blood and violence in this one scene to make me happy. Upon their arrival to Hadrian's Wall, Arthur's friend the bishop denies his men of their freedom for one last task concerning a Roman family in need of safe passage from the Invading Saxons. From there more talking (which isn't bad) and watching the remaining Knights trudge through some of the best shots of scenery of Ireland I've seen since ""Lord of the Rings (New Zealand),"" takes place. Honestly the movie is far too long and riddled with scenery shots for time fillers. Most of the time you'll be watching the Knights and Arthur riding at top speed on their horses. As for the addition or subtraction of scenes in this version of the film? If anything there are some scenes I've noticed in the film as opposed to the regular theatrical version (a certain Knight's death scene and others for instance) that were indeed better off left out.Sometimes the editing of the scenes seemed a bit jarred or too quick to jump to the next scene at times. The latter action scenes were all right, but felt a bit forced into trying to make you feel like there were ""epic."" Moreso, the battles felt like something taken out of ""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" in which Xena was engaged in battle with Romans or Chinese soldiers, only with a bigger budget, better decapitation scenes, blood and other things required to make a battle dazzling on film. The sword fighting was a bit slow in my honest opinion. Sometimes the actors made me feel like they were teasing each other by smacking the tips of their blades with their sides. The actors themselves, thankfully were convincing in their roles of Arthur (Clive Owen), Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Tristian (Mads Mikkelsen), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Dagonet (Ray Stevenson) and Bors (Ray Winstone). Unlike other ""Arthur/Knights of the round table"" character carnations who always looked as though they had hot and cold running water in their dingy castles, these knights are hardened battle weary warriors, not so clean looking and tough to boot. And ironically I've seen at least several of these men in films at one point of my earlier and latter adolescent life. The seven actors perform in their roles as knights very well. However, there are times when Clive Owen feels less convincing as King Arthur in certain moments of the movie. One in particular being the end of the movie where he weeps over Lancelot. The delivery of his words were borderlining lame and unemotional. Kira Knightley as Lady Guinevere was a bit arbitrary and most of the time unconvincing. No, she does not make a convincing warrior woman of the Woadish kind, her battle costume was less than flatterning. This character was completely useless given there are seven male actors to occupy your mind. Guinevere is basically misused and her character is introduced far too late into the movie to do anything significant to warrant mention (unlike like Xena whom people politely compare her to).The entire the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot LOVE-TIRANGLE was NONEXISTENT to be blunt. There wasn't even any romance in the blessed film. The Lancelot/Guinevere scenes clearly implied that Gruffudd and Knightley had better chemistry together than Knightley and Owen did not to my indifference. The sex scene (which I promptly fast-forwarded) was another poor excuse for trying to make the audience feel there was an attraction between the two characters when there clearly was not. Plus in my opinion, sex scenes in general are a complete WASTE OF TIME in movies in all, espically in this one. Getting back on subject, the unofficial villains, the SAXONS (relatives of Vikings) were hardly ever shown throughout the film. And when they would pop up they did nothing but burn things or chant weakly during marches. The leader, Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) felt in appearance like an ideal 'bad guy' but never acted as one in my honest opinion when he opened his mouth. His showdown with Arthur was weak even. The son, Cynric (Til Schweiger) whose attire and braided goatee reminded me of a member of metalica, played an almost convincing 'bad guy', better than Skarsg?rd did anyway. The WOADS reminiscent of the Amazons of ""Xena,"" having been stuck with the ""dying nation"" shtick, were also misplaced in the storyline. Their presence along with the underused Merlin was perhaps, not unneeded persay, but never utilized properly. On a positive note the music composed by Hans Zimmer is absolutely a splendid joy to listen to. It does well replacing the usual BRUCKHIMER action theme to my delight. Another added plus was that I could really notice the tune used in the BATMAN BEGINS score. The song used at the end of the movie ""Tell Me Now (What You See)"" performed by Moya Brennan is very reminiscent of ""May it be"" by Enya, except it lacks in strength when the drums aren't beating through the chorus. On last action scene note: The frozen lake scene was done pretty good all things considered, the CGI was utilized and done well for the cracking of the ice. In closing, all in all, ""King Arthur"" is not a horrible movie by any means, but its not great either though. Its highly enjoyable when you get past the dry spots, forced chemistry, 'historical events' and lack of character development. Recommended action flick.

851606,A2P2BGQLQA85X0,B0002YLCFQ,Phillip,"[3, 3]","King Arthur is a great movie, and the extended edition is a great edition to the library of an Arthurian legend buff. But this isn't history, neither is Arthurian legend for that matter. This is closer to the true story than most versions. For anyone who cares, here's a cliff notes version of the Roman withdrawal from Britain.In the first century the Roman Empire conquered and subjugated all of southern Britain, but as they pushed north of modern day York they began to encounter unusually heavy resistance from a tribe known as the Picts. Every push north into Pictish territory met with heavy losses, which the Empire had difficulty sustaining so far from Rome. By the beginning of Hadrian's reign, the conquest of northern Britain had stalled into stalemate. The last straw was the destruction of the 9th legion, the most victorious legion in Rome's history. Ironically the 9th was sent north on a punitive/rescue mission after Pict raiders burned a frontier fort and the surrounding village, and took several Roman and Roman British hostages. Following the 9th's ""disappearance"", Hadrian order all aggressive action in Britain to halt, and ordered the legions in Britain to construct his wall, to keep the Picts out.Now fast forward to the late 4th century, just after the Visigoths sacked Rome, the first time a non-Roman force had done so in about a thousand years. The Western Empire is an extreme state of disrepair, the product of political corruption, poor leadership, and endless raids from barbarian tribes. As a matter of strategic necessity, Rome began to abandon it's outermost holdings. At the close of the 5th, the phased withdrawal from Britain was well underway. As the legions were being recalled, the heavily Romanized Britons were simply abandoned. Without the legions to hold them back, Pict and Irish raiders had a field day, attacking every chance they got.The Britons hadn't had to defend themselves in 400+ years, and decided on a very Roman solution, hiring barbarian mercenaries. Now enters a man whose name should be synonymous with blunder, Vortigern. He was king of Kent, and had the brilliant idea of inviting a formerly Roman employed tribe called the Saxons to fight off the Picts and Irish. At first the Saxons only brought a few hundred warriors, but the results were phenomenal. After only a few engagements, the Irish ceased aggressive action. As a reward, the Saxons demanded and received a considerable amount of gold and silver, and a portion of southern Kent. The next wave of Saxons counted in the thousands, and included women and children. By the time the Britains realized the their mercenaries were trying to settle, it was too late. After that, wave after wave after wave of Saxons landed, and there was no stopping them. Those Britons that could fled west, into what is now known as Wales. Welsh, as it turns out, is Saxon for ""stranger.""By the Battle of Badon Hill, the Romans were long gone.",5,"Great movie, but not history",1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2947,"['King', 'Arthur', 'great', 'movie', 'extended', 'edition', 'great', 'edition', 'library', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'buff', ""n't"", 'history', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'matter', 'closer', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'versions', 'anyone', 'who', 'here', 'cliff', 'version', 'Roman', 'withdrawal', 'Britain.In', 'first', 'century', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'conquered', 'subjugated', 'southern', 'Britain', 'pushed', 'north', 'modern', 'day', 'York', 'began', 'encounter', 'unusually', 'heavy', 'resistance', 'tribe', 'known', 'Picts', 'Every', 'push', 'north', 'Pictish', 'territory', 'met', 'heavy', 'losses', 'Empire', 'had', 'difficulty', 'sustaining', 'so', 'far', 'Rome', 'beginning', 'Hadrian', 'reign', 'conquest', 'northern', 'Britain', 'had', 'stalled', 'stalemate', 'last', 'straw', 'was', 'destruction', '9th', 'legion', 'most', 'victorious', 'legion', 'Rome', 'history', 'Ironically', '9th', 'was', 'sent', 'north', 'punitive/rescue', 'mission', 'Pict', 'raiders', 'burned', 'frontier', 'fort', 'surrounding', 'village', 'took', 'several', 'Roman', 'Roman', 'British', 'hostages', 'Following', '9th', 'disappearance', 'Hadrian', 'order', 'aggressive', 'action', 'Britain', 'halt', 'ordered', 'legions', 'Britain', 'construct', 'wall', 'keep', 'Picts', 'out.Now', 'fast', 'forward', 'late', '4th', 'century', 'just', 'Visigoths', 'sacked', 'Rome', 'first', 'time', 'non-Roman', 'force', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'thousand', 'years', 'Western', 'Empire', 'extreme', 'state', 'disrepair', 'product', 'political', 'corruption', 'poor', 'leadership', 'endless', 'raids', 'barbarian', 'tribes', 'matter', 'strategic', 'necessity', 'Rome', 'began', 'abandon', 'outermost', 'holdings', 'close', '5th', 'phased', 'withdrawal', 'Britain', 'was', 'well', 'underway', 'legions', 'were', 'being', 'recalled', 'heavily', 'Romanized', 'Britons', 'were', 'simply', 'abandoned', 'legions', 'hold', 'back', 'Pict', 'Irish', 'raiders', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'attacking', 'chance', 'got.The', 'Britons', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'defend', '400+', 'years', 'decided', 'very', 'Roman', 'solution', 'hiring', 'barbarian', 'mercenaries', 'Now', 'man', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'synonymous', 'blunder', 'Vortigern', 'was', 'king', 'Kent', 'had', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'inviting', 'formerly', 'Roman', 'employed', 'tribe', 'called', 'Saxons', 'fight', 'off', 'Picts', 'Irish', 'first', 'Saxons', 'only', 'brought', 'few', 'hundred', 'warriors', 'results', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'only', 'few', 'engagements', 'Irish', 'ceased', 'aggressive', 'action', 'reward', 'Saxons', 'demanded', 'received', 'considerable', 'amount', 'gold', 'silver', 'portion', 'southern', 'Kent', 'next', 'wave', 'Saxons', 'counted', 'thousands', 'included', 'women', 'children', 'time', 'Britains', 'realized', 'mercenaries', 'were', 'trying', 'settle', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'wave', 'wave', 'wave', 'Saxons', 'landed', 'was', 'stopping', 'Britons', 'could', 'fled', 'west', 'what', 'now', 'known', 'Wales', 'Welsh', 'out', 'Saxon', 'stranger', 'Battle', 'Badon', 'Hill', 'Romans', 'were', 'long', 'gone']",King Arthur

851609,AIDQV95MLCIDD,B0002YLCFQ,P. Luce,"[2, 19]","King Arthur - director's cut - Clive Owen, Keira Knightly, Ioan Gruffudd - Ok, we have all been dreading this day when I would watch this movie and then review it. I knew going into it that I would hate it. I hated watching it and now I am hating reviewing it. With that said, the movie could have been a lot worse - anyone remember the Richard Gere ""First Knight"" horror movie. The movie, from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day and Tears of the Sun), has a stupid plot supposedly lifted from history, if history was written by Monty Python, which deals with a Roman general Artuos and his rag tag band of ""knights"" defending a failing and retreating Roman empire from invading Saxons and the Woads (who are lead by Elmer Fudd and look like rejects from Braveheart). Along the way, Arthur (played by Owen) decides the Roman empire is evil (there's a shocker didn't he see Gladiator) and joins the Woads to stop the Saxons. Ok, I really can't go into the plot any more than that. It isn't that I don't want to give any secrets away, but if I try to say more of the plot my head could explode. Instead, I will just tell you of how the ""historic"" take on the Arthur legend screwed up the Arthur legend. It is easy to do because there is not one thing in the movie that is historic or true to legend.

851610,AX5DYX4L82DDG,B0002YLCFQ,"P. Murray ""Impavido""","[1, 1]","The big plus in this movie is the new perspective on the possible history that inspired the King Arthur myth.  The possibility Arthur was a Roman soldier who was a student of Greek and Roman philosophers is tantalizing and from what I've learned, might even be true.Another element of this story that I like is the conflict of religions in England at this time.  And for once early christians are not portrayed as the perfect ancient people they frequently are.  They are shown as violent and cruel towards the pagan faiths (Which in this story, many of Arthur's knights are believers of).  However Arthur himself is a follower of early Christianity and is the more idealized symbol of spiritual morality in the movie, as he should be.  The movie touches on the subject of religion without becomming to preachy or biased.  The ancient pagan faiths are shown with respect and admiration, not as evil savages as the church would want you to believe.However, despite some of the interesting perspectives on history...as a movie, I found it lacking.  Here are some of the reasons why:-For one, it's predictable.  And the leader of the Saxon invaders is the sterotypical ruthless war-lord.  Not a very inspired bad guy.-The only conflict between Lancelot and Arthur is regarding Arthurs decision to make a stand against the Saxons, so the melodrama of the love triangle that turns brother-against-brother in the classic story is not there.-The movie is not directed poorly. Antione Fuqua did an good job, but while watching it I couldn't help but feel that this movie had a sort of ""Me too"" attitude.  It wishes it was like Gladiator and Lord of the Rings plus a little Pirates of the Carribbean on the side.  It doesnt seem to be able to stand on it's own two legs compared to these movies.These gripes aside, I did enjoy watching the film.  The action and battle scenes fit the story and are entertaining.

The good parts of this movie are: The Medieval weaponry was meticulous and interesting. The battle scenes are epic but extremely gory. Blood sprays, heads fly. don't watch it before bed.The bad things...As I mentioned the battle scenes are pretty darn intense, unless you don't mind seeing peoples heads getting hacked off their spine. Although modern research suggests that if King Arthur really lived, he would have lived in the Roman era, I guess I like the Medieval picture. The knights (if you can even call them that,) look like barbarians. No sooner does the chivalrous Sir Bors come home, that his wife gives him a sharp slap on the face! The chivalry  of these knights is all but gone. Arthur lets Guenivere in the battle! This aspect takes away an entire star. She is dressed in an armored bikini; something that the real King Arthur would have thrown up at if he had seen it. Most of the movie takes place during a cold snow. None of the actors show one bit of cold discomfort. Guenevere had bare arms! The knights look there most Medieval when the knights go against the bloodthirsty Saxons. They have the gorgeous armored horses and have Medieval garb. During the climax two bad things happened. First when Arthur goes head to head with the Saxons commanders, as soon as Arthur's sword plunges into him, and he dies, the battle is instantly over. Huh? Not to realistic.

I am more capativated by Beowulf or The Odyssey, tales with epic scale and human cores. But with Arthur, I don't feel it as much, and to get a movie about it done so poorly lowers all hopes for it. As if to insult the intelligence of the audience, Keira Knightley's Guinevere is put on the cover of the posters and DVD, as if the audience could not see the fact that she has about 30 minutes of screen time, thereby making her not a major character. Using someone as gorgeous as her to make money as part of advertisment is insulting; there's no getting around this one. I thought Clive Owen made a good Arthur, but he could not save this atrocity.

851614,A3CI4SA5MCHOR,B0002YLCFQ,"raboof ""Lauren in Tokyo""","[3, 6]","This movie is an ambitious retelling of the Arthurian legend using historical texts rather than the typical and more well-known legends.As such, it sets Arthur as a Roman general sent to Britain to secure Rome's control over the island south of Hadrian's wall.  Lancelot and the other knights are explained to be captured peasants who are forced into 15 years of service in the Roman army.  It is around Arthur (Arturius to Romans) and these handful of knights that the movie revolves.The stage is set with the end of Rome's 15-year occupation of the British isle.  Well, the end of Rome's occupation of it and the end of the knights' term of servitude to Rome, it wasn't quite clear what was happening exactly.  On the eve of their freedom, the knights receive one last command to rescue a Roman family north of Hadrian's Wall.  At the same time, it is known that a large group of Saxons is steadily marching south destroying everything in their wake.In addition to the deadly Saxons, there is a group of blue-painted people who live in the forest and are led by Merlin.  They have fought against Arthur for years, but really all they wanted was their freedom and to make Britain a free land.  Luckily for Arthur, these blue people hate the Saxons more than the Romans, so they team up against the Saxons in an epic final battle at Hadrian's Wall.My opinion?  Honestly, it was pretty bad.  None of the characters were very interesting, and Merlin, the greatest wizard ever, was a blue tree person without anything to add to the story.If there is ever a world-wide shortage of blue lens filters, we can blame this movie.  Every scene is cast in blue light, I suppose to give it a time-worn feel, but it makes many things difficult to see as lots of details and faces are lost in the shadows.The character of Arthur is more a book of homilies than man.  If it isn't Man's innate Freedom he's blabbering on about, it's something about loyalty.  After 15 years of that kind of talk, I think most of the knights would be rolling their eyes rather than riding off into battle with Art.We have Lancelot who is the narrator (I think) of the story.  He's all smoky and smoldering and always hinting at his ""prowess"".  Too bad we never actually see him fight anything.Luckily, just so we don't lose our minds from boredom, we get treated to Bose (Bozz?  Boss?) who sticks around for grunting, He-man humor.On the Saxon side, we have Cedric who actually seems a little bit interesting.  He gets about 5 minutes of screen time because it's far too generous to let the audience enjoy this serious movie.In all, this movie looks okay, but it's not really worth spending 2 and a half hours trying to figure out what's going on.  The director did a poor job of tying everything together and the cinematographer's decision to make everything too dark to see makes for a snoozefest.A reluctant 3 stars for the ambition, but it falls way short of the sort of quality you'd expect from something so richly infused with legend.",3,Not the Arthurian legend you knew,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3007,"['movie', 'ambitious', 'retelling', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'using', 'historical', 'texts', 'rather', 'typical', 'more', 'well-known', 'legends.As', 'such', 'Arthur', 'Roman', 'general', 'sent', 'Britain', 'secure', 'Rome', 'control', 'island', 'south', 'Hadrian', 'wall', 'Lancelot', 'other', 'knights', 'are', 'explained', 'be', 'captured', 'peasants', 'who', 'are', 'forced', '15', 'years', 'service', 'Roman', 'army', 'Arthur', 'Arturius', 'Romans', 'handful', 'knights', 'movie', 'revolves.The', 'stage', 'set', 'end', 'Rome', '15-year', 'occupation', 'British', 'isle', 'Well', 'end', 'Rome', 'occupation', 'end', 'knights', 'term', 'servitude', 'Rome', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'exactly', 'eve', 'freedom', 'knights', 'receive', 'one', 'last', 'command', 'rescue', 'Roman', 'family', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'same', 'time', 'known', 'large', 'group', 'Saxons', 'steadily', 'marching', 'south', 'destroying', 'everything', 'wake.In', 'addition', 'deadly', 'Saxons', 'group', 'blue-painted', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'forest', 'are', 'led', 'Merlin', 'have', 'fought', 'Arthur', 'years', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'freedom', 'make', 'Britain', 'free', 'land', 'Luckily', 'Arthur', 'blue', 'people', 'hate', 'Saxons', 'more', 'Romans', 'team', 'up', 'Saxons', 'epic', 'final', 'battle', 'Hadrian', 'Wall.My', 'opinion', 'Honestly', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'None', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'Merlin', 'greatest', 'wizard', 'ever', 'was', 'blue', 'tree', 'person', 'anything', 'add', 'story.If', 'ever', 'world-wide', 'shortage', 'blue', 'lens', 'filters', 'can', 'blame', 'movie', 'scene', 'cast', 'blue', 'light', 'suppose', 'give', 'time-worn', 'feel', 'many', 'things', 'difficult', 'see', 'lots', 'details', 'are', 'lost', 'shadows.The', 'character', 'Arthur', 'more', 'book', 'homilies', 'man', ""n't"", 'Man', 'innate', 'Freedom', 'blabbering', 'something', 'loyalty', '15', 'years', 'kind', 'talk', 'think', 'most', 'knights', 'would', 'be', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'rather', 'riding', 'off', 'battle', 'Art.We', 'have', 'Lancelot', 'who', 'narrator', 'think', 'story', 'smoky', 'smoldering', 'always', 'hinting', 'prowess', 'Too', 'bad', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'fight', 'anything.Luckily', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'minds', 'boredom', 'get', 'treated', 'Bose', 'Bozz', 'Boss', 'who', 'sticks', 'grunting', 'He-man', 'Saxon', 'side', 'have', 'Cedric', 'who', 'actually', 'little', 'bit', 'interesting', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'far', 'too', 'generous', 'let', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'movie.In', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'spending', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'director', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'tying', 'everything', 'together', 'cinematographer', 'decision', 'make', 'everything', 'too', 'dark', 'see', 'snoozefest.A', 'reluctant', '3', 'stars', 'ambition', 'way', 'short', 'sort', 'quality', ""'d"", 'expect', 'something', 'so', 'richly', 'infused', 'legend']",King Arthur

851617,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B0002YLCFQ,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[6, 9]","King Arthur is definitely an action film.  An action film with a bit of romance, a smattering of comedy, and a whole lot of drama, yes, but an action film nonetheless.  I wasn't quite expecting that, but came out liking it: from the moment the movie starts until the credit rolls, there is barely a break in the battle scenes or the intense moments where characters are running or fighting for their lives and their ""respective"" countries.  Reminiscent of Braveheart in many ways, this film is worth the watch, if only to consider the story of King Arthur from a new angle: with a realistic slant, rather than as a mystical ""fairy tale"" legend.In the early Dark Ages, a band of Sarmatian knights led by half British, half Roman Lucius Artorius Castus or ""Arthur"" (Clive Owen) meet with Roman Bishop Germanius to receive their release papers after 15 years of forced service in the Roman army.  They are (understandably) upset to discover that they must forego their freedom awhile longer: Rome has decided to pull out of defeating/defending the island, leaving the country and its natives vulnerable to an invasion by the Saxons.  Arthur and his knights are sent on one last ""most dangerous of all"" suicide mission: to rescue a Roman family from the bloodthirsty Saxons by crossing through the perilous Woad's territory (enemy natives led by mystical woodsman Merlin) and bringing them back to safety.  Only when they succeed in this trial, will Arthur and his knights be given their papers and allowed to return home as free men.The honorable Arthur must do a little convincing to get his knights to agree to this last most perilous mission: after all this band of real men is weary of fighting and ready to return home.  Soon his loyal yet rough-and-tumble knights agree, and Arthur and his band (including Lancelot played by Ioan Gruffud and Galahad played by Hugh Dancy) begin their perilous journey across Britain.  Along the way they encounter Merlin and his crew, who for some unknown reason, let them live and pass through the ""haunted"" forest alive.  After rescuing the Roman family (along with some natives who were in dire need), Arthur and his knights are forced to turn and fight the Saxons (who outnumber them by the handful!).  They are helped by a native warrior woman Guinevere  (Kiera Knightley), who ends up forcing a confrontation between Merlin and Arthur.  And when Arthur is finally faced with the choice to return to Rome or stay and fight for Britain alongside Merlin and the lovely Guinevere...The overall tone and feel of this film is dark, with lots of smoke and fog used in the battle scenes: although this film centers around battles and fight scenes, there is an underlying storyline that makes this film entrancing and interesting. The knights are not ""larger-than-life"" heroes, chivalrous and pure legend not reality: these knights are real men. You can't help but cheer for Arthur and his men as they fight against the odds to defeat the enemies of Britain and gain their own release: but when the time comes for this band of men to go home, will they go or will they stay? For those of you thinking of taking young children, I'd say don't.  Although the storyline is well done and there is little language, he entire film is basically one big bloody battlefield: a few years ago, this film may have acquired an ""R"" rating, but with some editing of the worst fight scenes, the studio managed a PG-13 rating.There is a lot of violence (what do you expect from a film about war?), very little language (I recall about 2 d*mn's, a few uses of bastard, and a few references to God, although most of those done either in a discussion or by calling out to Him); there is a coarse joke about a man's penis, and an instance of a man trying to rape a woman (he is stopped only after throwing her to the ground and falling on top of her). One character is portrayed as having a bunch of children outside of wedlock. There's also one scene where a man and woman end up having premarital sex (foreplay is intimated with a fair amount of skin, but no clear nudity that I can recall, before the camera pans out). There is one point at the beginning where prayer is mocked a bit, and ""the Roman church"" and its leaders are doubted some throughout, but Arthur does have a strong faith in God, which comes across very well, although his knights are mostly portrayed as atheists.Regardless of what any of the critics say, if you are ok with a PG-13 rating for ""intense battle sequences, a scene of sensuality and some language,"" then you probably will really like this film: I did!  In fact, I will probably go to see it again in the theatre: the new setting for the King Arthur story and the realism made for a great story. Clive Owen did a phenomenal job as King Arthur and has gained respect in my eyes: Kiera Knightley was great, as always, as the ""Britain-warrior-woman"" Guinevere (although a completely different aspect of this legendary character, it never was so over the top as to annoy me), and Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Hugh Dancy as Galahad were wonderful as well: in fact, I think all the actors did a good job in this film.  If you like the story of King Arthur, you will like this film: from the beginning to the end, you are taken on a real-life adventure with ""King"" Arthur and the knights of the round

851618,A1HWIMNX1N9CF2,B0002YLCFQ,Raz,"[2, 7]","Ok, so the movie was a bit far-fetched at times and glorified as a Saturday afternoon-kids-will-buy-this-story type of movie, but let's look at what was decent about this.The whole Roman touch... thank you for actually putting onto film what has been neglected by so many.  Historically the actual King Arthur did NOT go around in suits of chrome armor with huge jousting lances and a bevy of fair maidens.  All that would not come into history until a 1,000 years later when Briton was already unified.  The jousting knights were a long, long way off in history still when Arthur became king.This movie tries to show how Arthur probably did come about, right at the end of the Roman occupation of Briton, when it was nothing more than unorganized tribes and warlords.  Well done!Ok... that being said, the rest of the movie is eh... so-so at best.

851619,A34S9T4BAFBNSF,B0002YLCFQ,"R. B. Davis ""Bob""","[3, 3]","The latest retelling of the ""King Arthur"" legend directed by Antoine Fuqua is the first major film production that puts Arthur into his appropriate time-frame and costume. The 1981 film ""Excalibur"" has the Arthurian knights in 14th Century plate armor. The wardrobe people for ""Excalibur"" only missed by 1,000 years. But the knights in ""Excalibur"" looked really neat. What is a thousand years among average movie goers? If Arthur existed at all, he likely ruled shortly after the Romans left the British Isles in the 5th century A.D. In ""King Arthur"" the characters are dressed in costumes and armament that closely resemble those in use during this period. Some accommodation must be given to the swords and bows the characters use in this film. The weakness in the historical context is yet another filmmaker's addiction to Eastern ""martial arts"" weapons and fighting style.Another accolade for the filmmaker-""King Arthur"" does not attempt the chew up and swallow the whole Arthurian legend in a 90 minute movie. Short flashbacks are used to present the ""sword in the stone"" and other Arthurian myths. The film's main story-line encompasses a period of a few weeks and not Arthur's lifetime. The earliest reference to King Arthur is a recounting of the Battle of Mount Badon by the Welch monk Gildas about 550 A.D. If you want to see this battle, you will have to go to the alternative ending of ""King Arthur.""There are no dragons or omnipotent wizards in ""King Arthur."" Be prepared for a radically unique Guinevere well acted by Keira Knightley. Merlin's wizardry is only briefly mentioned as this character is portrayed (Ioan Gruffudd) as a leader of the peoples north of Hadrian's Wall.  Lancelot is a minor character and narrator. The legendary love affair between he and Guinevere is not broached in this film.Be prepared for several brutal combat scenes. Combat was gory when you bludgeoned or hacked your opponent to death at close range. The special effects are very good and the film shows excellent scenes of how Roman forts might have existed along Hadrian's Wall.To date, this is the best Arthurian movie and worth the money.",4,King Arthur--A Once and Future Film,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2139,"['latest', 'retelling', 'King', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'production', 'Arthur', 'appropriate', 'time-frame', 'costume', '1981', 'film', 'Excalibur', 'Arthurian', 'knights', '14th', 'Century', 'plate', 'armor', 'wardrobe', 'people', 'Excalibur', 'only', 'missed', '1,000', 'years', 'knights', 'Excalibur', 'looked', 'really', 'neat', 'What', 'thousand', 'years', 'average', 'movie', 'goers', 'Arthur', 'existed', 'likely', 'ruled', 'shortly', 'Romans', 'left', 'British', 'Isles', '5th', 'century', 'A.D', 'King', 'Arthur', 'characters', 'are', 'dressed', 'costumes', 'armament', 'closely', 'resemble', 'use', 'period', 'accommodation', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'swords', 'characters', 'use', 'film', 'weakness', 'historical', 'context', 'yet', 'filmmaker', 'addiction', 'Eastern', 'martial', 'arts', 'weapons', 'fighting', 'style.Another', 'accolade', 'filmmaker-', 'King', 'Arthur', 'not', 'attempt', 'chew', 'up', 'swallow', 'whole', 'Arthurian', 'legend', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Short', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'used', 'present', 'sword', 'stone', 'other', 'Arthurian', 'myths', 'film', 'main', 'story-line', 'period', 'few', 'weeks', 'not', 'Arthur', 'lifetime', 'earliest', 'reference', 'King', 'Arthur', 'recounting', 'Battle', 'Mount', 'Badon', 'Welch', 'monk', 'Gildas', '550', 'A.D', 'want', 'see', 'battle', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'alternative', 'ending', 'King', 'Arthur', 'are', 'dragons', 'omnipotent', 'wizards', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Be', 'prepared', 'radically', 'unique', 'Guinevere', 'well', 'acted', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Merlin', 'wizardry', 'only', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'leader', 'peoples', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Lancelot', 'minor', 'character', 'narrator', 'legendary', 'love', 'affair', 'Guinevere', 'not', 'broached', 'film.Be', 'prepared', 'several', 'brutal', 'combat', 'scenes', 'Combat', 'was', 'gory', 'when', 'bludgeoned', 'hacked', 'opponent', 'death', 'close', 'range', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'how', 'Roman', 'might', 'have', 'existed', 'Hadrian', 'Wall.To', 'date', 'best', 'Arthurian', 'movie', 'money']",King Arthur
851620,A2XOV3ZKGDK55G,B0002YLCFQ,"RBSProds ""rbsprods""","[3, 4]","Five Big Stars!! I really enjoyed this epic tale of 'Knights of Old(er)'. These are older, bolder Roman Knights doing their deeds in the Dark Ages on the British frontier, not the merry 'younger' England of in-bred kings and queens. Don't get wrapped up in historical accuracy, there isn't any Arthurian history by which we can make a judgement. This is a wonderfully made, superbly acted action adventure that goes in a different direction than Camelot. And it 'goes' into my private DVD collection of 'movies to see again and again'.Producer Bruckheimer and Director Fuqua conjure up a whale of a fantastically enjoyable tale that has familiar Arthurian characters popping up in unfamiliar places doing heroic things of consequence.  Arthur is a Roman Knight, who is pressed into an urgent mission before returning to defend a threatened Rome. The movie is a fast-paced thriller with some remarkable battle scenes and one encounter in the snow and ice that has to be seen to be believed and it will slow your breathing.Clive Owen's Arthur is invigorarting and engrossing. The usual Arthur is a King with all of the trappings. Not so here, Arthur is a frontier knight without so much as an aide to help him and Owen captures the 'lone wolf' moralistic aspects of this character superbly. He's absolutely spellbinding. Stellan Skarsgard, with long hair, is a terrific bad guy closing in on the Knights and generally pillaging and plundering everything in sight. And this Lancelot, played by the wonderful Ioan Gruffudd, is a brooding double-sworded knight of action and loyalty.Keira Knightley, however, as Guinevere, almost steals the entire movie. She makes an unusual dramatic entrance and manages to hold the camera in her every scene along the way. No mean feat for an 18 year old (that's right, 18) with one previous major role under her belt. She is probably the major action female of 2004 aceing out the likes of Uma Thurman of ""Kill Bill2"", Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi of ""Hero"", all of whom were aided by 'wire-fu' and scene-cutting trickery. Most of the stunts in ""King Arthur"" were done by the actors themselves, including some dicey swordplay and tricky horse maneuvers. BTW, the horses in this movie are fabulous. In particular, the scene where Owen (on a horse) and Skarsgard (on the ground) are having a pre-battle 'chat'. Yikes, what a  fantastic horse!The writer/producers used historical scraps to get to this intriguing possibility of what may have happened. But just enjoy it as a very diverting/highly enjoyable tale of high adventure wrapped around some historical accuracies: there were Romans in Britain at that time, religious leaders Pelagius and Augustine were having a spat over religiouis beliefs and Augustine won the argument, Augustine gave into the use of physical intimidation and coersion to convert non-Christians, and Rome was eventually sacked by outsiders at a later date. Forgaddaboutit!! Pop some popcorn, eat some Tropical Dots and Enjoy !!! Five Big Stars!!!!!Afterthoughts:* Don't miss the ""roundtable discussion with the production crew"" in the Extras section.* Also, contrary to some thoughts, ""King Arthur"" was a financial success. Director Fugua scored his first $200 million dollar movie success and Bruckheimer continues his string of boxoffice winners. While US sales were tepid ($52M), the international boxoffice was $150 Million alone, giving it profits of $40 to $80 Million. This is prior to Rentals, DVD sales, and the endless profits of HBO-like channels, network debuts, and revolving, eternal cable channel showings.  Wow, all of this and no cursing, nudity, or severed body parts flying around the scenery (in this PG-13 version at least. The Director's Cut is gruesome).

851621,A3YWKDKT6UAMY,B0002YLCFQ,Readalots,"[1, 3]","This 2004 rendition of ""King Arthur"" reflects the old English version of his legends.  The DVD certainly offers an action packed interpretation for the king, his knights, and the history of late Roman Britain.Setting aside Mallory's later French influence the movie makers introduce the Sarmatian legends blending them into Arthur's story.  This mix gives the movie an exciting note of uncertainty (because Sarmatian beliefs are not generally known and one doesn't know how Arthur and his band will end up).Owen (Artorius) and Knightly (Guinevere) give great performances.  Artorius is a loyal Roman torn between his duty to serve Rome and his desire to save Britain from invasion.  Guinevere is an arrow-shooting warrior with a firm will to convince Arthur that Britain is worth more to him than Rome. In the end they marry out-of love for country and each other.  Gruffudd plays a more likeable Lancelot (much like his earlier Hornblower work) than the knight's bigger-than-life Franco version.The screen play is refreshing, without the usual French overlay.  Guinevere and Lancelot are not lovers.  Gawain is a leading knightly presence. And a host of new knights (not named in the original English legends) take their place at the Round Table.  Thankfully, Morgan le Fey and Mordrid do not appear in this picture and the Battle of Mt. Baden is the beginning (not the end) of Arthur's reign.  I did miss the old English legend Percival character.The movie history appropriately follows the late 4th C. time frame.  (Arthur was not a medieval character.)  Its use of the known weaponry, uniforms, Roman & Celtic culture, and a few idiom  from the era are striking.  The fighting Celts, led by Merlin, are accurately painted blue.  Arthur's men use the gladius (sword).  The snowy elements play a noticeable role (I shivered with the actors as they fought Saxons atop an iced-over river) in winning the battle.  English Roman towns are given high walls and luxurious baths.  The knights of the Round Table travel atop rocky Roman roads. And Artorius wears Roman armor while riding an armored war stallion into battle.This movie is recommendable to any history buff, historical video library, or King Arthur connoisseur.

In this version by director Antoine Fuqua, those that do not know the story will be confused and those who do know the story will be confused and angered.The first flaw in this poorly pieced together film is how each character is given a foundation and introduced with unique characteristics, but they never pan out. Specifically Lancelot whose prominent introduction seems like it will relate to some event later in the film, but alas it leaves loose ends. Many things are unclear including: who were the people of Merlin's and Guinevere's tribe and if Arthur's round table was supposed to be at Camelot, why was it located in a compound the seemed to be a part of Hadrian's Wall?There are several aspects and scenes of the film which appear to be taken from Mel Gibson's `Braveheart' including Arthur's message that the knights' cause is the freedom of the people.The battle scenes were entertaining...for a time, until my mind began to wander and I began to think about how my backside was aching from sitting through this 130 minute escapade. The acting was wooden except when there was the occasional chivalrous deed performed by Arthur (Clive Owen) or a heated outburst from Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd).

It is a story about Arthur and his knights defending its English colony against the invading Saxons and awaiting their freedom from Rome. 'The true story that inspired the legend'.The characters were interesting, particularly the Saxon leader (Skarsgard) who was cruel and sadistic. Keira Knightley as Guinevere reminded me a lot of Natalie Portman although I never really noticed the resemblance before. I would've liked to see more character development on Lancelot though, as well as Merlin and Arthur.The dialog at the beginning of the movie is important to your understanding of what is going on.

But then there are some like ""King Arthur"" helmer Antoine Fuqua who should stick to their turf. His ""realistic"" re-telling of the King Arthur myth is a jumbled, dragging mess that features some stunning cinematography and atmospheric music but never feels focused or intense. If we are to believe this movie, then Arthur and his knights emerged from Samaria during the Roman era and served the empire as a sort of ancient wild bunch. The screenplay by David Franzoni (one of the writers on the superior ""Gladiator"") tries to give us a myth, human story, history lesson and action adventure all rolled into one. Which isn't bad, it's the way the movie is executed that sucks. Fuqua made his name with gritty crime pictures like ""The Replacement Killers"" and the superb ""Training Day"" which showed great promise. Here Fuqua suffers from bad scripting and lack of passion. The movie has some wonderful images and rich photography, the use of mountains, green fields and snow creates mood and sometimes you're tempted to forgive the movie because it LOOKS so good. But eventually it feels too long and empty because the characters are not fleshed-out, the story is simplistic as well as the dialogue (which makes ""Alexander"" sound like a classic work of theater) and the story doesn't have a lot of meat. We like what we are seeing in terms of visuals and colors, but we don't care much for anything that's actually happening with these people. Hans Zimmer should be commended for doing a good job with the movie's score with has a touch of ancient European lore in it's etheral vocals and moody strings. But even the music doesn't help a movie that just feels cold, you almost get the sense Fuqua wasn't having fun making this film. Indeed, the original theatrical version was a PG-13 cut that was reportedly argued by Fuqua who wanted an R version and here gets his wish with the DVD release of the ""Director's Cut."" Anyone expecting an improvement won't find it. The movie essentially feels the same, all that is added is more blood and a few more slices and kicks during action sequences which is meaningless because more blood and gore doesn't exactly advance what is a weak storyline. ""King Arthur"" chugs along trying to tell the ""real story"" behind a legend that feels more entertaining in movies like ""Excalibur"" and the masterful TV miniseries ""Merlin."" Fuqua is a gifted director who knows how to make movies, but this is not his best area of expertise and it's a shame his next movie, an epic crime drama titled ""American Gangster"" has been cancelled.

851630,A1JIPFV4OL520T,B0002YLCFQ,Robert Wynkoop,"[8, 11]","I was hoping for better than this.  Set in the fifth century as the Romans were withdrawing from England, Antoine Fugua attempts to set the Arthurian legend in historical context showing Arthur as a Roman knight who fights to save the native Britons from the invading Saxons.But in doing do, Fugua abandons the powerful archetypes that made King Arthur great and the characters become shallow and the great drama of the Arthurian tale with the love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot is only vaguely hinted at.  But most of all, the tale of King Arthur is the story of the triumph of Christianity (as represented by Arthur) over paganism (as represented by Merlin).  In Fuguas Arthur, we find the opposite.  Although Arthur is represented as a conscientious Christian, every other Christian in the movie is presented as a raving lunatic.  And to add insult to injury, Fugua seems to show the triumph of paganism over Christianity, as Arthur and Guinevere are married in a pagan ceremony.As a history buff, I have a few bones to pick with the movie.  The native Britons are shown as wild savages with blue painted faces.  The fact is that the native Britons had been civilized and Christianized by nearly 400 years of Roman occupation.  The Arthurian legend probably has its genesis in the fact that when Rome withdrew from Britain, they left the native population unarmed and untrained for war.  History seems to point out that perhaps a Roman officer helped these native Britons stem the invading Saxon advance for a short time.  The blue-faced wild men were in fact the Scottish Pics for whom the Roman Emperor Hadrian built his famous wall to prevent them from raiding Roman territory.I kept wondering why, in the winter battle scenes (by the way, the battle on the frozen lake was pretty good), that the men dressed in full battle armor while Guinevere barely wore anything at all.  By the way, how does a 110 lb woman fight and kill so many 200 lb Saxon warriors?  The obligatory sex scene was over done.  I would be embarrassed to take teenage kids to watch the movie for me.

When I saw ""King Arthur"" on the big screen, I was expecting a movie filled with myth, mystery, magic and mayhem.  In the director's cut, at least the mayhem has been considerably enhanced and it appears other moments and elements have been added that create a more satisfying movie experience.Publicity for ""King Arthur"" said it's the untold story of the real man who became the Arthur of legend. But in fact this is merely screenwriter David Franzoni's politically correct take on snippets of loosely interpreted fifth century history.Clive Owen is a forceful screen presence as Arturus and Stellen Skarsgrd is very effective as his Saxon nemesis Cedric.  A game Keira Knightly goes ballistic as warrior Guinevere in her skimpy leather battle gear and face paint.But even with a terrific set piece battle on a frozen lake and the extended, bloody confrontation at Badon Hill, this film does not do justice to the extreme religious and political forces -- primitive Christianity, paganism, Roman occupation and of course Pict, Saxon and Celtic concerns and claims -- that warred for control and in some cases survival in fifth century Briton.The extras include an all too brief round table discussion with cast and crew.  It's interesting to see and hear producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Antoine Fuqua, stars Clive Owen and Keira Knightly share their insights and anecdotes about the film-making process and their characters.

I myself thought it was nothing special from all the other King Arthur movies made. They tried I guess to make the movie different this time by hacking out a lot of the old story that has repeatedly been done on so many other movies and they thought this would make it better. Honestly it really didn't. It just made King Arthur fans like I disappointed and somewhat bitter. I can understand they wanted to make it a little different but it didn't seem right all the things they changed.A lot of it seemed unreal and totally barren. Like Merlin, why is it you see him so little, when in the other Arthur films he is the main star? And Arthur hated him in this film, instead of considering him a true friend like in the other films? One of the largest reasons I liked the King Arthur story was because of Merlin. You do not see him though hardly ever in this film though so don't expect him to be. And Guniverye (I can never spell that name right) she was very unrealistic in this film for many reasons. I know they wanted a strong female image but back then women, especially half- starved women with a wounded hand did not fight alongside men. That was very unrealistic. Then the whole essence of passion in the love triangle of Lancelot and Arthur with G. was so vague in this film, when it was supposed to be one of the biggest problems in the whole story. They hacked a lot out of this story definitely, a lot of the stuff that made the story of King Arthur so popular in the first place. So yes, the movie loses major points on this. And the other thing is again, even with all those changes I may have enjoyed the movie nonetheless if the changes were interesting, which they weren't. They were changes that made once a fascinating, mystical legend just to me another historic movie with a few battle scenes, a few words of honor, and then the credits. And since I do enjoy historic movies, I thought this one was all right, it isn't terrible, but it was nothing worth watching again.There has been better historic movies, and definitely better King Arthur films so I advise watching this movie once, and take your decision of it. Then watch an original story of King Arthur in film. Then you decide which is better. The modern tale, or the original tale.

851633,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002YLCFQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","The sadly underrated ""King Arthur"" provides a rip-roaring and original take on the classic Medieval legend.  The film is set in the brutal world of the 5th Century AD, right at the moment when the crumbling Roman Empire is turning inward and withdrawing its forces from far-flung outposts such as Briton, where barbarians from the north, sensing Rome's weakness, are beginning to make incursions into the regions south of Hadrian`s Wall.  In this version, Arthur's famous Knights of the Round Table are a compendium of conscripted tribesmen who have faithfully and courageously served the cause of Rome for the past 15 years.  Now, just at the moment when they are about to be granted their hard-earned freedom and are eager to return home, they are sent on a final dangerous mission deep into Saxon territory to rescue a boy who may be a possible successor to the Pope in Rome.""King Arthur"" focuses more on the geopolitical aspects of the tale than the customary romance and magic - although neither of those has been completely slighted in this telling.  The film opts for a darker, more realistic treatment of the story - there's no talk of Camelot here - one in which, Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the rest undergo internal conflicts and moral struggles often overlooked in earlier versions of the story.  Arthur, in particular, the product of a Roman father and a Saxon mother, is torn between his loyalty to Rome and to the island he calls home.  But, above all, he is faithful to the men who have served under his command and, with whom, he has been able to forge a chivalric code of ethics - one whose very cornerstone is individual rights and freedoms - that seems like an anachronism in a world dedicated to enslavement, brutality and destruction.  The violence in the film is grim, graphic and gory but appropriate to the times in which the movie is set.David Franzoni has written an intelligent, dramatic screenplay, and Antoine Fuqua has directed the movie with flair and style.  The action scenes are vivid and intense, and the film features the best ice floe battle sequence since ""Alexander Nevsky.""  The acting - by Clive Owen as Arthur, Keira Knightley as Guinevere and Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot - is no great shakes, but at least it's unobjectionable.For the most part, the movie's attempts at de-romanticizing the legend work well - although turning Guinevere into a halter top-wearing, bow-wielding combatant on the order of a Boudicca or even Xena-Princess Warrior, does seem a bit much.  However, since the film is less a retelling of the Arthurian legends and more a chronicle of the ""real"" people on whom the characters were allegedly based, such re-imaginings are more forgivable than they might otherwise have been.  And like most actions films these days that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, ""King Arthur"" is saddled with a saggy third act whose repetitive battle scenes drain some of the life out of the story.All in all, though, ""King Arthur"" emerges as a handsomely produced, thrilling tale of love, hope and freedom that should satisfy the schoolboy adventurer in all of us.",4,unorthodox take on the famous legend,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3129,"['sadly', 'underrated', 'King', 'Arthur', 'rip-roaring', 'original', 'take', 'classic', 'Medieval', 'legend', 'film', 'set', 'brutal', 'world', '5th', 'Century', 'AD', 'right', 'moment', 'when', 'crumbling', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'turning', 'inward', 'withdrawing', 'forces', 'far-flung', 'outposts', 'such', 'Briton', 'where', 'barbarians', 'north', 'sensing', 'Rome', 'weakness', 'are', 'beginning', 'make', 'incursions', 'regions', 'south', 'Hadrian', 's', 'Wall', 'version', 'Arthur', 'famous', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'are', 'compendium', 'conscripted', 'tribesmen', 'who', 'have', 'faithfully', 'courageously', 'served', 'cause', 'Rome', 'past', '15', 'years', 'Now', 'just', 'moment', 'when', 'are', 'be', 'granted', 'hard-earned', 'freedom', 'are', 'eager', 'return', 'home', 'are', 'sent', 'final', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'deep', 'Saxon', 'territory', 'rescue', 'boy', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'successor', 'Pope', 'Rome', 'King', 'Arthur', 'more', 'geopolitical', 'aspects', 'tale', 'customary', 'romance', 'magic', 'been', 'completely', 'slighted', 'telling', 'film', 'opts', 'darker', 'more', 'realistic', 'treatment', 'story', 'talk', 'Camelot', 'here', 'one', 'Arthur', 'Lancelot', 'Guinevere', 'rest', 'undergo', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'moral', 'struggles', 'often', 'overlooked', 'earlier', 'versions', 'story', 'Arthur', 'particular', 'product', 'Roman', 'father', 'Saxon', 'mother', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'Rome', 'island', 'home', 'faithful', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'served', 'command', 'whom', 'been', 'able', 'forge', 'chivalric', 'code', 'ethics', 'one', 'very', 'cornerstone', 'individual', 'rights', 'freedoms', 'anachronism', 'world', 'dedicated', 'enslavement', 'brutality', 'destruction', 'violence', 'film', 'grim', 'graphic', 'gory', 'appropriate', 'times', 'movie', 'set.David', 'Franzoni', 'written', 'intelligent', 'dramatic', 'screenplay', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'directed', 'movie', 'flair', 'style', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'vivid', 'intense', 'film', 'best', 'ice', 'floe', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Alexander', 'Nevsky', 'acting', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Arthur', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Guinevere', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Lancelot', 'great', 'shakes', 'least', 'unobjectionable.For', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'attempts', 'de-romanticizing', 'legend', 'work', 'well', 'turning', 'Guinevere', 'halter', 'top-wearing', 'bow-wielding', 'combatant', 'order', 'Boudicca', 'even', 'Xena-Princess', 'Warrior', 'seem', 'bit', 'much', 'However', 'film', 'less', 'retelling', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'more', 'chronicle', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'characters', 'were', 'allegedly', 'based', 'such', 're-imaginings', 'are', 'more', 'forgivable', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'actions', 'films', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'when', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'King', 'Arthur', 'saddled', 'saggy', 'third', 'act', 'repetitive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'drain', 'life', 'story.All', 'though', 'King', 'Arthur', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'thrilling', 'tale', 'love', 'hope', 'freedom', 'should', 'satisfy', 'schoolboy', 'adventurer']",King Arthur
851634,AL5BWQ7N6MLQK,B0002YLCFQ,"Ronin Dave ""Far be it for Logic to Stand in t...","[3, 6]","I wasn't exactly expecting ""King Arthur"" (2004) to be a great film, but I was hoping for some dumb fun. Unfortunately producer Jerry Bruckheimer was there to ham it up with cheesy melodramatics. I know he wasn't the director -- that honor goes to Antoine Fuqua -- but his presence was everywhere.The problem with the self-important melodramatic moments of the film is that in this movie there is not enough character development for the audience to give much of a toss for the characters during these moments that are meant to be heart-stirring.What irked me in addition is that they advertise this film as the ""true story"" of Arthur. Any Hollywood marketing director who puts this lame line on the press release for any Hollywood film should be shot on general principle.I guess having Arthur set in late Roman times is suppose to be a shock for audiences. Has Jerry been down to a Barnes and Nobles recently? Any history or fiction section dealing with Arthur in the last 50 years or so has had Arthur set in the 5th-6th century fighting the Saxons. Even as far back as the 11th century, the first major mass publication of Arthur in the ""History of the Kings of Briton"" by Geoffery of Monmouth had Arthur fighting the Saxons during the Dark Ages.The difference between the legends and the movie time-wise is about a century or so. The legends have Arthur emerging long after the Romans had left Briton at the beginning of the 5th century. Arthur's time is often thought to be in the late 5th Century to the early 6th Century.In the film Arthur is not a king but a half-Roman, half-British Roman Cavalry Commander of a group of Sarmartian auxiliaries serving along the Hadrian Wall. The Sarmartian knights in the film oddly all have medieval French names like Lancelot, Galahad and Tristan. I wasn't aware Sarmartians spoke French or gave their children French names.Now in the movie's defense, it wasn't a ""First Knight"" (1995) debacle. The actors are generally good and there's not much in the way of modern slang that creeps in. The problem is the movie is a mish-mash of Arthurian legends put into a typical Bruckheimer film.After a hammy melodramatic beginning of a kid riding off to join the Roman army, our story begins when the knights of Arthur have been fighting for 15 years and doing some amazing things that you have to take the movie's word for that they were amazing. The knights are fiercely loyal to Arthur because he has been a great leader which again you have to take the movie's word for it since we don't see any of this.Instead of having the story detail Arthur's accomplishments, the film focuses on just a few days. You have the elite force of Arthur's knights one day from retirement (stop me if you've heard this before) but they are asked to go on one more assignment -- the toughest they've ever had -- to rescue an important family north of Hadrian's Wall.This family apparently has never been wiped out by the Woads -- the native guerrilla force that Arthur and his men have been fighting all these years. Now the Saxons are coming so they have to get there before the Saxons and rescue them.Overall I'd give the film 2.5 stars. As I said, the actors are good. Some of the historical tidbits are good. The lame formula of the ""last dangerous mission before retirement"" storyline and the cheesy melodramatic moments that don't fly because there isn't enough character development are what keep the film from being enjoyable.It's a shame really. With the actors, sets, and costume and props it could have been a better film if not for the silly story.",3,Bring the head of Jerry Bruckheimer,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,3582,"['was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'expecting', 'King', 'Arthur', '2004', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'dumb', 'fun', 'Unfortunately', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'was', 'there', 'ham', 'up', 'cheesy', 'melodramatics', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'director', 'honor', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'presence', 'was', 'everywhere.The', 'problem', 'self-important', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'film', 'movie', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'audience', 'give', 'much', 'toss', 'characters', 'moments', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'heart-stirring.What', 'irked', 'addition', 'advertise', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'Arthur', 'Hollywood', 'marketing', 'director', 'who', 'lame', 'line', 'press', 'release', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'general', 'principle.I', 'guess', 'having', 'Arthur', 'set', 'late', 'Roman', 'times', 'suppose', 'be', 'shock', 'audiences', 'Has', 'Jerry', 'been', 'down', 'Barnes', 'Nobles', 'recently', 'Any', 'history', 'fiction', 'section', 'dealing', 'Arthur', 'last', '50', 'years', 'so', 'had', 'Arthur', 'set', '5th-6th', 'century', 'fighting', 'Saxons', 'Even', 'far', 'back', '11th', 'century', 'first', 'major', 'mass', 'publication', 'Arthur', 'History', 'Kings', 'Briton', 'Geoffery', 'Monmouth', 'had', 'Arthur', 'fighting', 'Saxons', 'Dark', 'Ages.The', 'difference', 'legends', 'movie', 'time-wise', 'century', 'so', 'legends', 'have', 'Arthur', 'emerging', 'long', 'Romans', 'had', 'left', 'Briton', 'beginning', '5th', 'century', 'Arthur', 'time', 'often', 'thought', 'be', 'late', '5th', 'Century', 'early', '6th', 'Century.In', 'film', 'Arthur', 'not', 'king', 'half-Roman', 'half-British', 'Roman', 'Cavalry', 'Commander', 'group', 'Sarmartian', 'auxiliaries', 'serving', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Sarmartian', 'knights', 'film', 'oddly', 'have', 'medieval', 'French', 'names', 'Lancelot', 'Galahad', 'Tristan', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Sarmartians', 'spoke', 'French', 'gave', 'children', 'French', 'names.Now', 'movie', 'defense', 'was', ""n't"", 'First', 'Knight', '1995', 'debacle', 'actors', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'modern', 'slang', 'problem', 'movie', 'mish-mash', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'put', 'typical', 'Bruckheimer', 'film.After', 'hammy', 'melodramatic', 'beginning', 'kid', 'riding', 'off', 'join', 'Roman', 'army', 'story', 'when', 'knights', 'Arthur', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', '15', 'years', 'doing', 'amazing', 'things', 'have', 'take', 'movie', 'word', 'were', 'amazing', 'knights', 'are', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'Arthur', 'been', 'great', 'leader', 'again', 'have', 'take', 'movie', 'word', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'this.Instead', 'having', 'story', 'detail', 'Arthur', 'accomplishments', 'film', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'have', 'elite', 'force', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'one', 'day', 'retirement', 'stop', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'are', 'asked', 'go', 'one', 'more', 'assignment', 'toughest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'rescue', 'important', 'family', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall.This', 'family', 'apparently', 'never', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'Woads', 'native', 'guerrilla', 'force', 'Arthur', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', 'years', 'Now', 'Saxons', 'are', 'coming', 'so', 'have', 'get', 'there', 'Saxons', 'rescue', 'them.Overall', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '2.5', 'stars', 'said', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'historical', 'tidbits', 'are', 'good', 'lame', 'formula', 'last', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'retirement', 'storyline', 'cheesy', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'fly', ""n't"", 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'what', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'enjoyable.It', 'shame', 'really', 'actors', 'sets', 'costume', 'props', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'not', 'silly', 'story']",King Arthur

The director is an underrated genius in his craft and I can't help but wonder if the troubles he faces from studios when it comes to presenting his vision stems not from actual feasability, but from the color of his skin.That an African-American could present such a bold and exciting account of the Arthurian legend, side stepping the Hollywood perpetuation of impossible myth and instead seeking a more historically believable telling of the tale must have stuck in many a studio executive's craw.The PG-13 theatrical release rating almost assuredly was an attempt to ruin Fuqua's box office credibility, when all it did was lend credence to the idea of disbanding the MPAA.Now by no means is this a perfect film, and the overused(although resounding) motif of freedom gets redundant and eventually, annoying.  However, much can be forgiven when each and every battle scene is more jaw dropping than the last.  If you're a fan of film violence presented in a realistic fashion, that's all the more reason to see this version of the film.This was one of the best films of 2004, too bad it never made it to theaters.

Arthur, or Artorius Castus, (played expertly by Clive Owen) and his six Knights have carved a name for themselves in the Roman armies, a legend of being an unbeaten force.At the end of their 15 years of service, they are summoned by Bishop Germanius (played by talented Ivano Marescotti) to receive their freedom from service.  But the Bishop tells them they are not to be freed until performing one last task for Rome, freeing a loyal Roman family from invasion by the Saxon's to the north, in particular, the son of the family, Alecto.Arthur and his six Knights, Gawain, Lancelot, Tristin, Galahad, Bors, and Dagonet set off for the north, grumbling at Rome's betrayal.  They must travel through the lands that the Woads occupy, strange barbaric foes led by a wise man named Merlin.  Once past the Woads, Arthur finds the Roman family taking the power of their God and Country and using it to create serfs and slaves, torturing those who they deem heretics.  One of the heretics Arthur frees from the prisons is Guinevere, a Woad.With the Roman family unwilling to go submissively with them, and Saxon drums beating on their heels, the seven Knights flee into the mountains in a desperate attempt to fulfill their last obligation to the empire and gain their freedom.Does this movie follow any Arthurian legend?  Not remotely.  Does this movie have any historical value?  None whatsoever.  Is this a good movie?  Yes, indeed!  Put down those history books and King Arthur fantasies and get ready for a stunningly filmed epic, a medieval battle movie far superior to any of the bad ""Arthur"" movies (except Excalibur).  This is a medieval fantasy, and a very grand one at that.  The photography is spectacular, the acting is superior to many of the ""bigger names"".  The dialogue is interesting, funny, and intriguing, capturing a closer bond to the feelings of the Knights of their time with the humped up society of today.These are not the shiny Knights of Boorman's `Excalibur', but a rough and dirty bunch, still keeping nobility about them and Honor above all else.  Special mention goes to Ray Winstone, who plays Bors, Joel Edgerton who plays Gawain, Ioan Gruffuddand who plays Lancelot, and Keira Knightly who plays Guinevere, along with Clive Owen, who I can see as the next Mel Gibson.  Owen fits the part to a Tee, and Knightly plays Guinevere the way she should have been played, both soft and tough.  Knightly was good in Pirates Of The Caribbean, but she is great as Guinevere.Still, the real attraction to this movie is the striking photography of the battles.  Take particular notice of the fight on the ice, the way the arrows fly through the air, and tip your hat to the costume designer for some spectacular outfits and gear that truly bring this epic to life.  This movie is pure eye candy for those who love a good medieval fight, tossed with realistic characters and a touch of romance.My only negative thought would be that it needed a little more blood, but since King Arthur was headed towards the PG-13 crowd like LOTR, some decapitation scenes didn't occur that I thought may have enhanced the battles.  All in all, a very lovely piece of tasty filmmaking that should not be ignored simply because it didn't follow someone else's rules.

851642,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B0002YLCFQ,S.E. Poza,"[7, 10]","I appreciate D.H. Franzoni's (a writer for this movie)review which seeks to enlighten us about the history used to construct this movie. I also applaud the moviemakers attempt to create a new perspective on a story that's been told many times.With that in mind, I wanted to approach this movie with an open mind rather than judge it with one eye on the story we all know so well. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make me conclude this was a good movie.First of all, the basic premise, that the legend of King Arthur was based on a roman with a similar name, was an interesting one. However, if the moviemakers are going to use history so faithfully, they shouldn't try to pepper the movie with modern day dialogue and personalities. The banter between the ""knights"" and especially Guinevere's behavior (particularly soon after a rather terrible ordeal that she was rescued from) seemed out of place. If the writers were so devoted to accuracy, why didn't they research how people related to one another and the true behavior of peasants of the era?The dialogue sounding too modern and quippy at times serves to spoil the mood of the period which the moviemakers seemed to be trying so hard to be faithful to. Also, I just could not buy Guinevere being so forward all the time. Somehow I doubt most peasant women waltzed up to knights and questioned whether they believed in anything or that they made jokes about rape. Also, Guinevere's prowess with a bow soon after having her fingers (which were previous pushed out of joint for at least awhile during torture) was absurd. Additionally, if she were so kick ass, I doubt she'd have been captured and tortured in the first place. It seriously smacked of an attempt to create a more feminist version of the character which, again, seemed out of place.Undermining the credibility of a desire for an accurate historical perspective wasn't enough to make the movie unenjoyable though it did make one feel there was some pandering to certain a certain demographic going on. The real problem is the movie moves too slowly and seems to linger lovingly on certain scenes for no reason.It's not that the scenes should have been shorter but some of them seemed unnecessary to the story's progress.The only ""good"" thing about the movie was that it took elements of the mystical Arthurian legend and gave them a basis in potentially realistic occurences and that was interesting but not nearly enough to carry the movie. I guess that some might question whether or not such an attempt really holds any value for a classic tale steeped in magic and mysticism but I'm willing to give credit for the desire to do so even if the implementation on the whole didn't work very well.",2,"Interesting historical take, so-so movie",1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2717,"['appreciate', 'D.H.', 'Franzoni', 'writer', 'movie', 'review', 'enlighten', 'history', 'used', 'construct', 'movie', 'also', 'applaud', 'moviemakers', 'attempt', 'create', 'new', 'perspective', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times.With', 'mind', 'wanted', 'approach', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'rather', 'judge', 'one', 'eye', 'story', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'conclude', 'was', 'good', 'movie.First', 'basic', 'premise', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'was', 'based', 'roman', 'similar', 'name', 'was', 'interesting', 'one', 'However', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'going', 'use', 'history', 'so', 'faithfully', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'pepper', 'movie', 'modern', 'day', 'dialogue', 'personalities', 'banter', 'knights', 'especially', 'Guinevere', 'behavior', 'particularly', 'soon', 'rather', 'terrible', 'ordeal', 'was', 'rescued', 'seemed', 'place', 'writers', 'were', 'so', 'devoted', 'accuracy', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'research', 'how', 'people', 'related', 'one', 'true', 'behavior', 'peasants', 'era', 'dialogue', 'sounding', 'too', 'modern', 'quippy', 'times', 'serves', 'spoil', 'mood', 'period', 'moviemakers', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'faithful', 'Also', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'buy', 'Guinevere', 'being', 'so', 'forward', 'time', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'most', 'peasant', 'women', 'waltzed', 'up', 'knights', 'questioned', 'believed', 'anything', 'made', 'jokes', 'rape', 'Also', 'Guinevere', 'prowess', 'bow', 'soon', 'having', 'fingers', 'were', 'previous', 'pushed', 'joint', 'least', 'awhile', 'torture', 'was', 'absurd', 'Additionally', 'were', 'so', 'kick', 'ass', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'tortured', 'first', 'place', 'seriously', 'smacked', 'attempt', 'create', 'more', 'feminist', 'version', 'character', 'again', 'seemed', 'place.Undermining', 'credibility', 'desire', 'accurate', 'historical', 'perspective', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'unenjoyable', 'did', 'make', 'one', 'feel', 'was', 'pandering', 'certain', 'certain', 'demographic', 'going', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'too', 'slowly', 'linger', 'lovingly', 'certain', 'scenes', 'reason.It', 'not', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shorter', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'progress.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'took', 'elements', 'mystical', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'gave', 'basis', 'potentially', 'realistic', 'occurences', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'guess', 'might', 'question', 'not', 'such', 'attempt', 'really', 'value', 'classic', 'tale', 'steeped', 'magic', 'mysticism', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'credit', 'desire', 'do', 'so', 'even', 'implementation', 'whole', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well']",King Arthur
851643,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,B0002YLCFQ,Sera69,"[1, 1]","I'm slightly surprised at the disdain this movie has received from some reviewers. Much like The Coens' The Ladykillers, the only thing it really gets wrong is the title. If this had been called The Last Legion or Eagle in the North it would surely have garnered more positive reviews.As it is, probably for purely commercial reasons, it's been saddled with tinges of Arthurian legend which does take a bit of wind out of the sails. Like finding out John Wayne is called Marion. Step aside from that however and it's a great man on a mission movie; full of camaraderie, macho dialogue and gritty fights and some pretty good set pieces. The emergent dominance of Christianity is handled well with both sides of belief represented surprisingly adroitly and no disdain levelled at Merlin and his Pagans.The story itself is quite gripping, too. Not original, but still well told. The last remnants of Britannia's indentured cavalry have their freedom revoked for one last mission, to rescue a child of the Emperor boarding in the far North and under threat from invading Saxon hordes. The sense of an Empire fast on its way to ruin, of stout men for whom duty comes first and of a people caught between changing worlds is captured vividly. This is a dark and dirty world and the film echoes that: The Knights on a suicide mission in a bleak winter land of very little beauty or hope at all.Yes, it is overtly Hollywood: the ending is hateful and the voiceover just proves how dumb a studio can be (and how stupid they must assume their audiences to be.) Clive Owen is still a glowering, wooden lead devoid of empathy and character but here he is ably supported by an excellent cast, Ray Winstone particularly seeming to revel in being cast in his heroic role rather than as yet another gangster wide-boy. Much has also been made of Keira Knightley's battle fatigues but they are more dyed-in-the-woad than Xena Warrior princess. Certainly, you'd have to be pretty easily shocked to find them sexual and, as an ex-slave with nothing to her name and a fierce desire to fight, she is hardly going to have the epic battle dress and armour of the Legionnaires.Overall, the Arthurian bumpf stifles an otherwise stirring sword and sandals tale that stands as better than The Eagle, Troy and Alexander combined. Overlook its faults and you have a fun way to spend 90 minutes that surprises, stirs and entertains.

Arthur feels loyalty Rome, but there's been quite a bit of fiddling going on during Arthur's 15 years of servitude, and Rome is not the same city he left behind. The rest of the knights, including Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Bors (Ray Winstone), just want to get the heck out of Britain and go home.The action of KING ARTHUR occurs just at the handover, if you will, as Romans prepare to vacate Britain. The Saxons (led by Stellan Skarsgard) are invading from the North, with a sort of destroy-this-country-in-order-to-save-it philosophy of warfare. The native Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane, underused) and Guinevere (a strident Keira Knightley) -- they live in the forest, have lots of cool weapons, great skin, and really enjoy the music of Phish. The Brits are Arthur's enemies at first, but they soon ally against the Saxons in a overlong and bloody final battle. There's one great action scene on a frozen lake, but much of this movie is very heavy going, with lots of debates about religion, duty, nationalism, etc.As for the acting, Owen can't defeat dull writing, Knightley is appealing although humorless, Skarsgard looks bored, and the rest of the overqualified cast is underused.

This was the first account of King Arthur...a King Arthur who at that time had no (full) alliegence to Christianity, since 15th Century re-writing of the legend incorporated Christianity, despite Arthur's alliegence to Rome in the 5th CenturyWith that all said and done, I can see where the film is coming from. The film does not have anything to do with the very culturally familiar fiction of &quot;Sword And The Stone&quot; or &quot;Merlin&quot; feating Sam Niell, which would cause most of us to scold the film...when we were probably told in our childhood something fictitous and he hold that as the fact. King Arthur has no fiction, no magic, no nothing...it's all the raw legend of the 5th Century...the ORIGINAL story (stilghtly adapted to 21st Century in terms of dialogue et al), since each century had their own version of the story.This film centers on a period of time when King Arthur, being born in Britian yet showing allegience to Rome, paves the path for his future, and what is now the legend; standing up for what he beleives despite ridicule. The events in the film just happen to be about this one point specifically, and not a whole epic life story as would be expected by the vague title King Arthur.The music, performed by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, saves some points of the movie I still have issues with. The vivid use of color, lighting, and scene staging helps as well. I still enjoy Keira Kinghtley's acting, and am growing onto Clive Owen a little more, however he still seemed a bit stale for my liking, however it could be all in the part if one considers Arthur is somewhat in dismay and doesn't have true confidence throughout most of the film.All in all, weighing everything again, I was able to get more out of the film and appreciate it much more and like it much better now that I know the context of the story. However, I suggest that all people in my situation at first watch the MSN Video interview with Jerry Bruckheimer since it helps sort things out and actually brings more to the film which ended up being quite good, however it has a bumpy path toward getting great reviews from people unless they do some research into the film's origins.",4,Quite decent upon re-review,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,2649,"['said', 'would', 'do', 'due', 'negative', 'feedback', 'past', 'review', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'listened', 'soundtrack', 'am', 'reading', 'novelization', 'also', 'happened', 'catch', 'MSN', 'Video', 'interview', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'regard', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'now', 'fully', 'understand', 'context', 'film', 'researching', 'actual', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'used', '5th', 'Century', 'first-account', 'legend', 'monk', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'now', 'was', 'first', 'account', 'King', 'Arthur', 'King', 'Arthur', 'who', 'time', 'had', 'full', 'alliegence', 'Christianity', '15th', 'Century', 're-writing', 'legend', 'incorporated', 'Christianity', 'Arthur', 'alliegence', 'Rome', '5th', 'CenturyWith', 'said', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'film', 'coming', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'very', 'culturally', 'familiar', 'fiction', 'quot', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'quot', 'quot', 'Merlin', 'quot', 'feating', 'Sam', 'Niell', 'would', 'cause', 'most', 'scold', 'film', 'when', 'were', 'probably', 'told', 'childhood', 'something', 'fictitous', 'hold', 'fact', 'King', 'Arthur', 'fiction', 'magic', 'nothing', 'raw', 'legend', '5th', 'Century', 'ORIGINAL', 'story', 'stilghtly', 'adapted', '21st', 'Century', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'et', 'al', 'century', 'had', 'own', 'version', 'story.This', 'film', 'centers', 'period', 'time', 'when', 'King', 'Arthur', 'being', 'born', 'Britian', 'yet', 'showing', 'allegience', 'Rome', 'path', 'future', 'what', 'now', 'legend', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'ridicule', 'events', 'film', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'one', 'point', 'specifically', 'not', 'whole', 'epic', 'life', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'vague', 'title', 'King', 'Arthur.The', 'music', 'performed', 'brilliant', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'points', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'issues', 'vivid', 'use', 'color', 'lighting', 'scene', 'staging', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Keira', 'Kinghtley', 'acting', 'am', 'growing', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'little', 'more', 'however', 'still', 'seemed', 'bit', 'stale', 'liking', 'however', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'one', 'considers', 'Arthur', 'somewhat', 'dismay', ""n't"", 'have', 'true', 'confidence', 'most', 'film.All', 'weighing', 'everything', 'again', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'more', 'film', 'appreciate', 'much', 'more', 'much', 'better', 'now', 'know', 'context', 'story', 'However', 'suggest', 'people', 'situation', 'first', 'watch', 'MSN', 'Video', 'interview', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'actually', 'more', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'good', 'however', 'bumpy', 'path', 'getting', 'great', 'reviews', 'people', 'do', 'research', 'film', 'origins']",King Arthur
851653,AZ4BQ7PFK8BEK,B0002YLCFQ,"Stephen Boyer ""Student of History""","[12, 16]","As a student of Classical History (Greece & Rome) this movie inspired me to learn more about the people north of Hadrons Wall. In other words the people that the film was portraying that Guinevere & Merlin came from.  These people were the Pictish people of 5th century Scotland, or the area North of Hadrons Wall.What the film inspired me to learn was that Pictland, as the Pictish homeland was called, was made up of a large area of what is now modern day Scotland, mainly in the low-lying coastal areas of Eastern Scotland where they sustained themselves through fishing and farming. The Picts weren't any one particular race or culture per se, but a military alliance which was formed around 100 AD to defend against the Roman invaders. The name Pict itself is believed to be derived from the Latin word Picti, ""the painted men"". In fact, the Pictish nation out-lasted the would-be conquerors and predated the formal organization of both the Scots and Irish. Historical and archaeological records also show that they were also quite fierce warriors, judging by accounts of those (like the Scots and the Irish) whom they defeated in battle. They were the dominant military power in that area for almost 500 years.The language which they spoke is believed to have been similar to the modern day Welsh language, fitting into a category which linguists call the P Celtic Languages while modern Gaelic and Irish are considered ""Q-Celtic"". Not much is actually known about their dialect because the Picts didn't keep written records, but even today many Pictish place names still exist in Scotland.Almost all of what is now known about them is from accounts of others and the few artifacts the Picts themselves left behind. Chief among these were ornate carved stones which represent some of the high points of Celtic art. There are inscriptions on the stones written in an alphabet called Ogham, variations of which were also used by the Scots and Irish. Although the inscriptions of their Celtic counterparts have been translated, there has yet to be any successful translation of the Pictish Ogham.Despite their lack of written records, the Picts were quite advanced culturally and artistically. Between the 5th and 7th centuries AD most of them were converted to Christianity and this was reflected in the sculptures of the period. Their art retained most of its traditional elements, but they also began to add crosses and other Christian symbolism.The Picts shared much in common with their fellow Celts, such as geography, similar language, and similar art, among other things. There were some differences however, the main one being that descent for the Picts was defined in terms of the mother rather than the father ie. matrilineal rather than patrilineal. Historical records suggest that this is what led to their disappearance, or rather their assimilation by the Scots. Because of the way in which Picts handled descent, the Scots were able to gradually absorb them through marriage. After some time, it is believed, all distinction between them had become so blurred that they were essentially indistinguishable.Although it is generally accepted by historians and archaeologists that the Picts merged with the Scots, exact details aren't known. And with the exception of second hand accounts, there is almost no information about the Picts themselves. Because of their unique social and historical characteristics, the Picts have continued to be one of history's most intriguing mysteries.Make more films that inspire people to learn more.",4,Inspiration to Learn More,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,3551,"['student', 'Classical', 'History', 'Greece', 'Rome', 'movie', 'inspired', 'learn', 'more', 'people', 'north', 'Hadrons', 'Wall', 'other', 'words', 'people', 'film', 'was', 'portraying', 'Guinevere', 'Merlin', 'came', 'people', 'were', 'Pictish', 'people', '5th', 'century', 'Scotland', 'area', 'North', 'Hadrons', 'Wall.What', 'film', 'inspired', 'learn', 'was', 'Pictland', 'Pictish', 'homeland', 'was', 'called', 'was', 'made', 'large', 'area', 'what', 'now', 'modern', 'day', 'Scotland', 'mainly', 'low-lying', 'coastal', 'areas', 'Eastern', 'Scotland', 'where', 'sustained', 'fishing', 'farming', 'Picts', 'were', ""n't"", 'one', 'particular', 'race', 'culture', 'se', 'military', 'alliance', 'was', 'formed', '100', 'AD', 'defend', 'Roman', 'invaders', 'name', 'Pict', 'believed', 'be', 'derived', 'Latin', 'word', 'Picti', 'painted', 'men', 'fact', 'Pictish', 'nation', 'out-lasted', 'would-be', 'conquerors', 'predated', 'formal', 'organization', 'Scots', 'Irish', 'Historical', 'archaeological', 'records', 'also', 'show', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'fierce', 'warriors', 'judging', 'accounts', 'Scots', 'Irish', 'whom', 'defeated', 'battle', 'were', 'dominant', 'military', 'power', 'area', 'almost', '500', 'years.The', 'language', 'spoke', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'similar', 'modern', 'day', 'Welsh', 'language', 'fitting', 'category', 'call', 'P', 'Celtic', 'Languages', 'modern', 'Gaelic', 'Irish', 'are', 'considered', 'Q-Celtic', 'Not', 'much', 'actually', 'known', 'dialect', 'Picts', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'written', 'records', 'even', 'today', 'many', 'Pictish', 'place', 'names', 'still', 'exist', 'Scotland.Almost', 'what', 'now', 'known', 'accounts', 'others', 'few', 'Picts', 'left', 'behind', 'Chief', 'were', 'ornate', 'carved', 'stones', 'represent', 'high', 'points', 'Celtic', 'art', 'are', 'inscriptions', 'stones', 'written', 'alphabet', 'called', 'Ogham', 'variations', 'were', 'also', 'used', 'Scots', 'Irish', 'inscriptions', 'Celtic', 'counterparts', 'have', 'been', 'translated', 'yet', 'be', 'successful', 'translation', 'Pictish', 'Ogham.Despite', 'lack', 'written', 'records', 'Picts', 'were', 'quite', 'advanced', 'culturally', 'artistically', 'Between', '5th', '7th', 'centuries', 'AD', 'most', 'were', 'converted', 'Christianity', 'was', 'reflected', 'sculptures', 'period', 'art', 'retained', 'most', 'traditional', 'elements', 'also', 'began', 'add', 'crosses', 'other', 'Christian', 'symbolism.The', 'Picts', 'shared', 'much', 'common', 'fellow', 'Celts', 'such', 'geography', 'similar', 'language', 'similar', 'art', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'differences', 'however', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'descent', 'Picts', 'was', 'defined', 'terms', 'mother', 'rather', 'father', 'ie', 'matrilineal', 'rather', 'patrilineal', 'Historical', 'records', 'suggest', 'led', 'disappearance', 'rather', 'assimilation', 'Scots', 'way', 'Picts', 'handled', 'descent', 'Scots', 'were', 'able', 'gradually', 'absorb', 'marriage', 'time', 'believed', 'distinction', 'had', 'become', 'so', 'blurred', 'were', 'essentially', 'indistinguishable.Although', 'generally', 'accepted', 'historians', 'archaeologists', 'Picts', 'merged', 'Scots', 'exact', 'details', 'are', ""n't"", 'known', 'exception', 'second', 'hand', 'accounts', 'almost', 'information', 'Picts', 'unique', 'social', 'historical', 'characteristics', 'Picts', 'have', 'continued', 'be', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'intriguing', 'mysteries.Make', 'more', 'films', 'inspire', 'people', 'learn', 'more']",King Arthur

I'm happy to say I liked this movie quite a bit.  Can't answer for its accuracy, but I can't attack it either.  A lot has changed from the Tennyson/Malory heroes of old.  No search for the Holy Grail (in fact all the knights are pagans, although Arthur is a Christian.)  No steamy romance between Lancelot and Guinevere.  Merlin isn't a wizard; rather, he's a leader of a large tribe of half-naked, tattooed and skin-painted-blue Woad warriors.I guess gritty realism is the way to describe it, and I was caught up in it from beginning to end.  The knights here seem closer to a gang of bikers from the wrong part of town than the finer stuff of legend.  Still, director Antoine Fuqua, and the actors, imbue them with a great deal of interesting individuality. From Mads Mikkelsen's stringy haired, hawk carrying, quasi-samurai Tristran to Ray Winstone's earthy and bullet-headed Bors, the characters felt like real people.The dvd contains the director's cut, which contains all the blood and gore they had to leave out for the PG-13 release.

I love a good epic, on film or in print, the closer to the way things really might have been, the better. And I think this version of King Arthur fulfills that criterion quite nicely. The real Arthur remains an historical mystery but, as others have commented here, his origins may fairly be found in the history of Romanized Britain as the Romans were withdrawing to leave their mixed Celtic and Roman subjects to the mercy of the barbarian Germanic invaders who were being pushed westward by other barbarians (like the Huns) or by the forces of nature (the erosion of their coastal lands in what is today's northern Germany and southern Scandinavia). Indeed, the Germanic Saxons who are the heavies of this film came, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain and the later Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, as mercenaries to serve in the late Romano-British armies maintained by the leaders who remained after the Roman legions had formally withdrawn.Initially the Saxons aided the local rulers to withstand raids from the Irish Scots and the Picts from what is today Scotland and from nearby Ireland. But these Saxons (and their cousin tribes, the Angles and the Jutes) were land hungry and liked what they saw when they came to serve in the British kings' hosts. As they came to realize their strength relative to their native employers they began to demand more and more land and autonomy for themselves and even to marry one of their daughters to the main British monarch, Vortigern (who is generally condemned by Geoffrey for importing the Saxons in the first place).Cerdic, the Saxon leader, and his cohorts eventually conceived the idea of bringing over their families and fellow tribesmen and soon fell out with Vortigern over the land. Thus began a multi-generational tug of war for possession of the Isle of Britain. It's against this backdrop that the Arthurian legends grew up. Arthur, whether a Roman military commander or a local king or a commander who became a king, seems to have struggled to hold back the Germanic tide but, in the end, the effort he began was fated to fail as the Britons were driven into the western highlands of the island, to become today's Welsh, while the Angles, Saxons and Jutes expanded, warred and eventually consolidated as the Anglo-Saxons in time to face a new invader from their old haunts, the Danish and Norse vikings. By the time of the Norman invasion by William the Conqueror, the Anglo-Saxons were known as the Anglish or the English, a largely Germanic group of people who had intermarried with many of the Britons they had absorbed and come to rule.The notion that the tales of Arthur were founded on a Roman dux (war leader, the modern variant of which is our ""duke"") who led Sarmatian cavalry is intriguing. The Sarmatians came from the steppes of what is today southern Russia and the idea that they were proto-Russians, as manifested in their war cry of ""Rus,"" is certainly interesting, if not based on historical fact. In truth the eytemology of the term ""Rus"" is unknown, but the Russian Primary Chronicle, not so different from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in England, ascribes it not to the southern steppe tribes but to the Varangians who invaded the land that was to one day be called Russia from the north. Notably, these Varangians were Scandinavians, just like the Vikings in the west and, perhaps, not unlike the Angles, Saxons and Jutes who had invaded Britain in a slightly earlier period.I liked the fast pace and tight scripting of this film (it kept me on the edge of my seat much of the time) though it had a certain artificiality to it, essential, perhaps, to achieve its dramatic effect. But there is nothing in the record to suggest that the legends of Arthur are all based on a relatively brief excursion to a Roman outpost north of the Wall. Nor is there any reason to suppose there would have even been such an outpost among the barbarous Picts (called Woads in the film) above the Wall, beyond the safety of the legions at that period. Why indeed bother to build and man a wall to keep the Picts and Scots out if you are going to establish settlements in the region beyond the reach of the legions at the Wall?Moreover, my own reading suggests that much of the action in the Arthurian tales occurred in the south, not in the north near Hadrian's Wall, and that Cerdic and Cynric, his son, established themselves as successive leaders of their people for a time. Indeed, I don't recall them both dying in a single battle, such as the one this film presents, before the Roman Wall. Beyond that, I thought the presentation of Cerdic as a kind of Ur-Nazi fuehrer, and the Saxons as storm trooper automatons in bearskins and armor, a little over the top. While the portrayal of Cerdic in the film was sufficiently nuanced to make him an interesting foe, it's highly unlikely that he would have been as thoughtless for his men as he is presented, sending one troop in to die with barely a thought for their welfare or countenancing the killing of the one man who returns as though he were a worthless beast.Not only would any leader who treated his men like that have a hard time keeping them with him, but among the Germanic peoples of the north such a leader would have been quickly bereft of followers for these people were amazingly disputatious and free-spirited, only following the war leaders who could command their loyalty. The brutal, almost inhuman, killer this film makes Cerdic out to be would have been without an army behind him rather quickly. Still as written and portrayed in the film, he was a pleasure to watch, a dark and world weary villain who, if not historically accurate, at least added dramatic dimension to the tale.A related concern I had was the way Cerdic forbids raping the women to avoid miscegenation. This has racist overtones more appropriate to latter day Europe than to the era of barbarian migrations, nor does it accord with the historical habits of the Germanic warriors of the period, or of most warriors for that matter, since rape was part of the reward these barbarians expected. But even if they were going to kill all the conquered people, which Cerdic would not have bothered to do until he had already established his tribe in the land (which is not suggested in this film at all), there's no reason for him to have prevented his men from raping the women first and then killing them. There is just no logic to it.And the battle scenes, while nicely handled, gave us an almost endless heroic slaughter that seemed a bit unbelievable as warriors with spears through their backs go on to fight like unscathed heroes, while others yank arrows from their chests in order to plunge back into the fray. Only the Saxon host seems genuinely mortal until, at last, the Sarmations finally begin to die off, after numerous plucked arrows, speared backs and slashed torsos and legs. I rather expected them to be out of the fight much sooner which, since this is presented as the anti-legend of Arthur, ought to have been how it was handled in my opinion.So the film gets mixed reviews on story logic and historical accuracy from me. But as a tightly told historical epic, it was a lot of fun and intriguing to see how the Arthurian legend might be portrayed, shorn at last of its layers of Welsh, French and later English medieval narrative paraphernalia.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga",4,Nicely Done Historical Take on the Real Arthur,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,7503,"['missed', 'movies', 'so', 'waited', 'eagerly',

One good thing about this is that it makes you care about the characters more, where as in Troy I didn't care what happened to the characters.

By the 450's Roman troops had already evacuated the island, they were fighting for their lives trying to defeat Atilla's rampaging hordes. The Pope didn't issue military orders and the Bishop Germanus character was an out and out prop for the anti-Christian, pagan revisionist lala philosophies of Bruckheimer & that hack Manfredi. It is especially an injustice because the character is based on the bishop of the same name (known today as St. Germaine) who went to Britain around that time and it was he who rallied the Britons & Romano-Britons to fight off a combined attack of the Picts (they weren't called Woads like this imbecile screenwriter calls them. ""Woad"" was the bluish dye they tattooed and painted themselves with...if they can't get something that's common knowledge like the Picts right, what else is wrong?) and Saxons.

851674,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B0002YLCFQ,Timothy Michael Resh,"[3, 5]","What's to like about this drab retelling of the Arthurian legend?  The filming is uninspired, owing a large debt to the techniques Ridley Scott used to much better dramatic effect in Gladiator.  The plot is as skimpy as the outfit Keira Knightley wears for the final showdown between Arthur's knights and the Saxons.  Knightley's eye candy Guenivere provides one of the few bright spots in a film that is otherwise difficult to watch.  Arthur and most of his knights seem grossly miscast, and Clive Owen simply cannot carry off the role as this larger than life hero.  Stellan Skarsgard pulls off a moderately good performance as the leader of the Saxons, but inexplicably speaks with a distinctly American accent.I rented the director's cut, which presumably represents the artist's vision of the final movie.  This film is exemplary of why studios often make dramatic changes to a director's work.  The film is grossly overlong, somehow deluding itself into believeing that a long run-time somehow equates to an epic film event--and the film's almost nonexistent plot seems only to serve as a device to get the combatants to their next battle sequence.Thoroughly uninspired, this film does little to expound upon the mystery of the Arthurian legend as its opening titles promise.  Instead, it winds up being a loosely confederated group of battle sequences, which, while occasionally eye-catching, are often gruesome and gratuitous, and usually fail to advance the story, which is what this film is most in need of.  All in all, a huge waste of time for a person who does not have time to waste.

851676,A2RN2LIRWA60GG,B0002YLCFQ,T. Kopf,"[2, 3]","I would have to say I enjoyed this movie and historical version of an Arthur we don't know.  Let's face it, although the original version of Arthur is a good one it seems more like a tale of fantasy than historical acuracy.  This version to me at least exept for Guinevere in the leather strap warrior bikini, seems more likely to have some accuracy.  They did leave in the part about pulling the sword out, except it was out of a grave and not a stone.  But I think it is more possible that Arthur was indeed just a captain appointed by the Roman Empire on a far outpost, the knights were more like a band of warrior brothers conscripted from the lands and were a little rougher on the edge than the clean cut knights of arthurian tales.As for the whole Christian bashing thing people need to just chill.  Arthur did not give up on his christian beliefs to become a pagan, he did give up on believing in a Rome that was just an idea and not a reality.  Can you honestly say that what history points out about ancient Rome being a little sinister, greedy, a little inhumane maybe is wrong?  Did they not set out to conquer the world.  Did they not use religion as a tool?  Does the Roman Catholic church have a few blemishes on its record?So overall realize that the story of Arthur or Arturius Castus in this movie is not the Arthur you know.  But according to some recent findings and in my mind a ""whats most likely"" reasoning I think this movie can prove to by more accurate.

851678,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B0002YLCFQ,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[2, 4]","SPOILERS BELOW!I've commented on this movie before: the cinematic PG-13 version. This is what I wrote in Auagust 2004:Saw it twice. Liked it even better the second time around. I know a lot of folks had their problems with it, especially those who wanted either a rehash of exisiting 'Arthur' tales, or alternatively expected a 'historically accurate' account.Get a life, people. It's a MOVIE. A STORY. And it's well-told, with the mystical mumbo-jumbo removed and the French soap opera elements rinsed away, so that just the names are recognizable. Despite that-and that's one of the things I really liked about it-the movie managed to retain the flair of (demythologized) 'legend'. It was an uabashed story about a hero, and there's nothing wrong with that.Another nice tweak: Arthur making the transition from trying to serve a 'higher purpose' to humanization, when he realizes that the 'higher purpose' is probably well and truly corrupted, and that if any purpose in life is to be found it lies in the service of one's people. A good and noble soldier's creed. The stuff indeed, of heroic legend, well told, and with a kick-ass cast.---- Now, finally, I got the DVD, so here goes... ----There's been a lot of complaining about the de-mythologizing of the legend. Mostly that means the removal of the French soap-opera component and the pretense that anybody really believes in magical swords, witches and spirits living in lakes. Is that a loss? I suppose it depends on who's talking. A review in the Guardian (complete with the inevitable political anti-American end-commentary) moans that 'Britain's national myth has suffered its own catastrophe' and that KA is 'one of the worst historical, or history-esque, films ever made'. Complaints also abound about its historical inaccuracies, and Keira Knightley's battle dress continues to draw major vitriol. Well, if you look at the latest research by people like John Matthews and Linda Malcor you may find that the inaccuracies may not be and that Keira, like her male comrades, should have been fighting in the buff, their bodies painted head-to-toe. That would have been a sight, would it not?Of course, there's an argument for 'preserving' legends, and I think KA did that well. It just twisted it into a different direction. The DVD also contains an alternate, darker ending, without the PG-13 feel-good wedding. This had been Fuqua's choice, but apparently the money-men walked over him and Bruckheimer and what was intended to be an R-rated movie became a PG-13 nice-kiddy flick in the editing room: sanitized and dumbed down.Fuqua's commentary is very revealing and shows up not only his disenchantment with studio politics, but also reveals his personal philosophy, which I've always liked, ever since listening to him comment on Tears of the Sun. Above all, he makes the interesting observation (one I happen to completely agree with) that, in particular, the adultery soap-opera element in the traditional  versions of the legend actually makes no sense. It may be perfectly in line with what we expect from daily TV soap fare and Reality TV, but between comrades-in-arms there is a kind of ethics that folks living within the comfortable and boring confines of refined civilization may well find incomprehensible.To those who wish to advance the virtues of the 'noble' and 'clean' traditional versions: it occurs to me that the very _ignoble_ soap-operatic characters, whose 'courtly' nobility appears to be more one of declaration and general pomposity, can only cower in shame before the much less sophisticated but honest nobility of the Arthur and knights depicted in this movie. Surely, if we look for heros of the Campbellian kind, this is where we find them, not in the classical bedroom dramas centering around the betrayal of Arthur by Guinevere and Lancelo, or people's  obsession with that ultimate of social taboos, incest.Watching KA again after listening to Fuqua's commentary gives the movie additional depth and reveals dimensions one might easily have missed before. All in all a worthy and important addition to the cinema release version. So many things I initially missed suddenly became clear, such the obvious parallels to such classics as 'Seven Samurai' and 'Magnificent Seven', and the even closer kinship between this movie and 'Tears of the Sun', another classic Campbellian hero tale.Another nice touch (I keep discovering things about this movie!) was pointed out to me by a lady who truly loves horses. When the knights, together with the Roman garrison and a bunch of refugees, leave Hadrian's Wall and the Saxon drums of war start rolling, the horses bolt, prompting the knights to reflect on their decisions to leave. I thought it was a good scene, but it becomes even better when we remember that, as we're told early on in the movie, slain warriors return as horses. So it wasn't just that the knights had a sudden and not easily understood change of heart: it was their horses, the souls of the dead warriors, that reminded them who they were, and who refused to continue avoiding their destiny-albeit a destiny which, as Arthur reminded his knights later, they chose as free men, rather than indentured soldiers for the Romans.Till NoeverAuthor: KEAEN,

This movie didn't do too well for one simple reason: it was easier for movie reviewers to portray a version of King Arthur based on TRUTH as un-fun.  After all, are you someone who likes magic swords and explosions and legend and romance, or someone who likes the History Channel???  Um.  Well, I like fantasy, but I love the History Channel, too.  This was a GREAT story based in truth.  Most historians agree that ""King Arthur"" was an amalgamation of several warriors and kings, but history shows that that something just like this movie actually occurred.  Whether the guy's NAME was ""King Arthur"" is debatable, but the basic plot of the movie did happen.Someone reviewed this movie, saying there's no plot.  It's the rise of post-Roman Western civilization!!  Wake up!  It's interesting and dramatic!  So many people have no conception that Britain was once a Roman province inhabited by Romans, Celts, and a handful of tribes competing for dominance on the island.The movie also cleverly shows how the ""myth"" of Arthur could have sprung from the truth of his life, exaggerated to the Nth degree.  (Lancelot is a ladies man, Merlin is a mysterious druid rather than a magician, Arthur did pull have to work to pull a sword out of a burial mound, etc.)Have fun!

851684,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B0002YLCFQ,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[8, 21]","I found this movie to be very confusing, as it mis-named or mis-represented races, (the Picts, a well-documented, very early race of people who inhabited the British Isles, living mostly in the north, were called ""Woads"" in this movie--I can only imagine this was because ""woad"" was the name of the vegetable dye they tattooed themselves blue with; the Saxons came from the South, not the North, being Germanic), and if movie-makers can't even get such a simple things correct, it's hard to trust them on anything else. The idea that Arthur was Roman goes against everything we've ever learnt about this possibly real, possibly mythical man. The beloved myth of ""The Once and Future King"" is one that has many important themes in it from which we're supposed to learn deep truths about honor, loyalty, love, irony, fate, etc., (as Joseph Campbell discusses in depth), and these themes remain, whether told in Malory or T.H. White, or in the Mary Stewart ""Merlin"" trilogy. None of those themes are present in this muddled movie, leaving one unsure of what is going on. We should have very clear ideas of who people are and why they're fighting whomever it is they're fighting, why the Round Table was so significant, all the more so because this is being advertised as the ""real"" historical Aruthur. If one is purporting to be making an historical, rather than mythical, version of this story, then getting things like dates and place names correct would seem self-evidently important. For instance, Arthur, were he a Roman soldier, would be named Artos; his men would not have Celtic-derived names such as Gawain, Galahad, Tristan, nor the French Lance-let (Lancelot). And the only Emperor of Rome who truly subdued Britannia was Maximus, 383-388, who came, conquered, fell in love with the land, stayed, ruled, then fought at Rome's doorstep to keep them off the island. He was killed, and as a result, the Empire removed finally to Constantinopolos. There is no apparent reason for making all these people into the mythological characters so beloved if you're going to change every single thing about their stories. Why not write an original script? With original names? And it should be accepted by the movie makers that no one can tell such ancient history ""for real."" Even the myths have changed over time, as Lancelot didn't enter the myth until Arthur had been long-established. His presence was a romantic addition that came centuries later. Mary Stewart's research (which she documents well in her books) therefore takes the ""lover"" who brings down the Kingdom via Mordred (Arthur's illegitimate son), and makes him not Lancelot, but rather Arthur's best friend from childhood, Bedwyr. My point is, that when dealing with what can only be one's own take on a story, a consistent point of view is necessary, and this just doesn't exist in ""King Arthur."" Never mind calling it ""historical""; just be consistent, would be my request. But many historical things are known, such as the existence of the Picts and the Saxon invasion from the South. To get those wrong in a ""true story"" is sort of like saying that early English settlers came to the New World and discovered Australian Aboriginals. Whatever story you write about those who landed, you should at least get right the names of the Natives who were here when your characters landed.The Romans were supposedly driven out (by Bodicea--spelling?), and were done so long before any version of Arthur existed but in all the versions of his story, he is portrayed as having been the first truly British King, uniting Britain for the first time since the Romans left, bringing peace and an end to tribal fighting, rather than another Roman General in charge of this farthest bit of the Empire, as Clive Owen plays here (at least that what he seems to be, as I said, who he is, exactly, is very confusing). Whether he was a war-lord or the mystically created Artos for whom Merlin exerted all his efforts to bring into being specifically for England, any movie about him should take a specific point of view and make it clear. In this one, Merlin is there, but not as Arthur's ""magician"" and advisor. I'm not sure who he is in this movie, actually, or what his function is, but it seems to be anti-Arthur, which just is crazy-making. In all versions of this story, Arthur is born of the Duchess of Cornwall by Uther Pendragon, while she is married, and so deep is this belief that her castle, where Arthur was supposedly conceived, Tintagel, is still one of the most visited sites in Cornwall. Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon, King of England, was considered to have been the last ""Roman-trained"" king, but even he was never called Roman.Central to all tellings of the story is Guinivere and the love triangle between her and her husband the King, and her lover and his best friend, Lancelot or Bedwyr. All of this is gone, but we don't get a meaningful replacement for the drama of that situation. And to have the girl running around barely clad and a warrior is straight out of Xena, where the Amazons wore bras and miniskirts and could have been killed with a pocket knife. This choice is especially bewildering--more so even than the choice of making Guinevere a fighter in the first place. The least they could have done is put in her into warm clothes; while the men are in fur to their eyeballs on an icy plain, she fights in a see-through, sleeveless dress, without even wearing goosebumps. It's ridiculous.Clive Owen is quite a good actor--he's a very compelling presence--but he seems unsure of himself here, as though even he's not certain who he is or what his own point of view is. Owen can make up for a certain amount of poor storytelling, in ""Beyond Borders"" for example, where the movie is not up to the weight of its subject matter, but here he just can't seem to lift the film up out of the ever-present mud.I was left wondering why King Arthur had been dragged into this story at all. If you want to make a movie about Roman soldiers fighting--well-pick a group, there were plenty to choose from--then make one. The Arthurian legend is not called a ""legend"" for no reason. It's a precious one to the English; the mythology is deeply embedded in the country's consciousness, and is actually part of why the idea of the monarchy never quite goes away. The idea that he will come again, Arthur, the truest British King who ever lived, is a myth that still hasn't died.If a movie-makers want to explore the realities that went into building that myth, who can blame them? It's a fascinating puzzle. But this hodge-podge of out-of-context fact and traditionally inspirational fiction isn't much of success, on any level. And sadly, it's a waste of good acting talent and what was obviously genuine devotion to the project.",1,Found it all very confusing,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,6794,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'very',

The latter are definitely the biggest problem, with Antoine Fuqua proving more often than not truly hopeless at directing actors. Indeed, KA boasts some of, if not THE worst performances ever seen in a major studio picture. Clive Owen may look the part, but he delivers the lines like a dyslexic reading off idiot boards while fighting a hangover while Keira Knightley's Guinevere is just as pitiful: she's supposed to be a Celtic warrior queen but despite the fact that her people seem to speak Sioux for some reason she sounds like she's been to a rather expensive English finishing school where they teach you to mispronounce words like `cuhnntwee' (country) and `Roahm' (Rome). That wouldn't be so bad if she had even the remotest shred of talent, but none is to be found. Not since Helen of Troy have their been two leads so desperately in need of dubbing by more talented artists. Throw in Ken Stott doing an outta-ray-juss Ay-Taly-Eano accent, Ray Winstone overdosing on the bish-bash-bosh routine he does instead of acting these days and a couple of frighteningly inept child actors and it's a miracle that the film manages to be as much fun as it is.

851688,A2J9COKR9JAZUQ,B0002YLCFQ,"Trey David Wood ""The Sleeper Must Awaken""","[1, 1]","This particular version of the King Arthur story is rather different than previous ones, in as much as it boasts a historical basis derived from current archaeology (or would that be anthropology?)  In any case, it's a cool concept but ultimately it ends up being a bit of a gimmick, considering how the only historic aspect is the theoretical notion that the legend of King Arthur may have been inspired by a Roman citizen in what was then known as Britannia. All the other tropes of the legends--the round table, the knights (in particular their names), Guinevere and Merlin--are just thrown in for the sake of entertainment and recognition.  Of course, the movie steers clear of any supernatural elements from the old stories, which helps maintain consistency in the overall tone.The noteworthy differences make for an interesting departure, though.  The script is a little unoriginal at times and the antagonistic Saxons are portrayed in a one-dimensional manner, but there is some really strong dialogue peppering the movie throughout and the talented cast really helps bolster some of the weaker scenes so that the viewer is painlessly conveyed to the better ones afterward.  The fight scenes are really well done, which is a major plus in any war movie.  The camera work during the battles manages to be hectic and shaky yet the action is still discernable.  For the faint of heart, it should be known that the scenes are very bloody but no more so than, say, Braveheart or Troy.I think if anyone enjoyed the aforementioned movies then they would most likely be at least marginally pleased with King Arthur.  If you want the legendary King Arthur with magic and the sword in the stone, check out Roger Boorman's classic Excalibur.  It's coming out on blu-ray soon and it's an awesome movie.The picture:  overall the blu-ray is fairly good and obviously better looking than the DVD, but it's not really reference quality.",4,"Still more legend than history, but entertaining.",1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,1927,"['particular', 'version', 'King', 'Arthur', 'story', 'rather', 'different', 'previous', 'ones', 'as', 'much', 'historical', 'basis', 'derived', 'current', 'archaeology', 'would', 'be', 'anthropology', 'case', 'cool', 'concept', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'gimmick', 'considering', 'how', 'only', 'historic', 'aspect', 'theoretical', 'notion', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'Roman', 'citizen', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'known', 'Britannia', 'other', 'tropes', 'legends', 'round', 'table', 'knights', 'particular', 'names', 'Guinevere', 'Merlin', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'sake', 'entertainment', 'recognition', 'course', 'movie', 'steers', 'clear', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'old', 'stories', 'maintain', 'consistency', 'overall', 'tone.The', 'noteworthy', 'differences', 'make', 'interesting', 'departure', 'though', 'script', 'little', 'unoriginal', 'times', 'antagonistic', 'Saxons', 'are', 'portrayed', 'one-dimensional', 'manner', 'really', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'peppering', 'movie', 'talented', 'cast', 'really', 'bolster', 'weaker', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'painlessly', 'conveyed', 'better', 'ones', 'afterward', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'major', 'plus', 'war', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'battles', 'be', 'hectic', 'shaky', 'yet', 'action', 'still', 'discernable', 'faint', 'heart', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'bloody', 'more', 'so', 'say', 'Braveheart', 'Troy.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'enjoyed', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'then', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'least', 'marginally', 'pleased', 'King', 'Arthur', 'want', 'legendary', 'King', 'Arthur', 'magic', 'sword', 'stone', 'check', 'out', 'Roger', 'Boorman', 'classic', 'Excalibur', 'coming', 'out', 'blu-ray', 'soon', 'awesome', 'movie.The', 'picture', 'overall', 'blu-ray', 'fairly', 'good', 'obviously', 'better', 'looking', 'DVD', 'not', 'really', 'reference', 'quality']",King Arthur

851690,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002YLCFQ,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 12]","As it is the film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who gave us Armageddon, Con Air, and Pearl Harbor, you know what you see in King Arther. Historical accuracy? Not a chance. The Round Table? Excalibur? You see them, but not in the way you read or heard. For it is based on a newer, revised idea, which means you get lots of actions, sword fighting, and love. In short, just another over-the-top blockbuster film, and as such King Arther is not bad.Now, the surprisingly non-Ameircan cast include Olive Owen as Arther; Keira Knightley as Guinevere; Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot; Stephen Dillane as Merlin; Stellan Skarsgaard as baddie Cerdic; Ray Winstone as Bors; Hugh Dancy as Galahad; Joel Edgerton as Gawain; Mads Mikkelson as Tristan; and Ray Stevenson as Dagonet.The story is nothing you ever have heard in many versions of King Arthur legends. The new story is set against the background of the Roman occupation of Britain in 415 AD. King Arthur is under the command of a Roman priest, who gives Arthur and other knights another and last order to bring back a Roman aristocrartic family safe back from the enemy territory, where the Saxons led by cold-blooded Cerdic are invading.Of course, it's a suicide mission, but it sounds a bit familiar, isn't it? Well, the director of this film is Antoine Faqua, who did Tears of the Sun last year, and that's no wonder. Oh, and by the way, the screenwriter of King Auther happens to be David Franzoni, one of the co-writers of Gladiator of which huge success, critically or commercially, must have spawned the new craze for the Ben-Hur type big-scale epic actions, including Troy and a forthcoming one about Alexander.To be fair, the actions are done with enough power and convincing fight scenes, without splashing too much blood. At the same time, after watching Gladiator this one may look very tame. And some of the actions cannot help making us feel like, I have seen it before, and if its doesn't, well, you haven't seen Braveheart or Rob Roy.I do not complain of the historical things -- anyway, it's legend -- but King Arther challenges our concept about this famous story so gratingly that you may be offended with it. You see no Camelot; Merlin does not use magic; and Guenevere takes us a weapon and shoots arrows, at times with her skins painted blue like one character in X-Men. Some say it's campy, and with good reasons. And as the illicit love with Lancelot is totally gone (hey, it's a family picture), so Gruffudd soon starts to look just like a shadow following her and Arthur.If you are not surprised to see the newness of the story, you will be entertained with the actions, or the fights between the good and the evil. But as you know. you can see John Boorman-directed Excalibur which would be a better choice for some.",3,"It's Hollywood and Bruckheimer, and You Should Have Known it",1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,2787,"['film', 'produced', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'who', 'gave', 'Armageddon', 'Con', 'Air', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'know', 'what', 'see', 'King', 'Arther', 'Historical', 'accuracy', 'Not', 'chance', 'Round', 'Table', 'Excalibur', 'see', 'not', 'way', 'read', 'heard', 'based', 'newer', 'revised', 'idea', 'get', 'lots', 'actions', 'sword', 'fighting', 'love', 'short', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'such', 'King', 'Arther', 'not', 'bad.Now', 'surprisingly', 'non-Ameircan', 'cast', 'include', 'Olive', 'Owen', 'Arther', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Guinevere', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Lancelot', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Merlin', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'baddie', 'Cerdic', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Bors', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Galahad', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Gawain', 'Mads', 'Mikkelson', 'Tristan', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Dagonet.The', 'story', 'nothing', 'ever', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'versions', 'King', 'Arthur', 'new', 'story', 'set', 'background', 'Roman', 'occupation', 'Britain', '415', 'AD', 'King', 'Arthur', 'command', 'Roman', 'priest', 'who', 'Arthur', 'other', 'knights', 'last', 'order', 'bring', 'back', 'Roman', 'aristocrartic', 'family', 'safe', 'back', 'enemy', 'territory', 'where', 'Saxons', 'led', 'cold-blooded', 'Cerdic', 'are', 'invading.Of', 'course', 'suicide', 'mission', 'bit', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'Well', 'director', 'film', 'Antoine', 'Faqua', 'who', 'did', 'Tears', 'Sun', 'last', 'year', 'wonder', 'Oh', 'way', 'screenwriter', 'King', 'Auther', 'be', 'David', 'Franzoni', 'one', 'co-writers', 'Gladiator', 'huge', 'success', 'critically', 'commercially', 'must', 'have', 'spawned', 'new', 'craze', 'Ben-Hur', 'type', 'big-scale', 'epic', 'actions', 'including', 'Troy', 'forthcoming', 'one', 'Alexander.To', 'be', 'fair', 'actions', 'are', 'done', 'enough', 'power', 'convincing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'splashing', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'same', 'time', 'watching', 'Gladiator', 'one', 'may', 'look', 'very', 'tame', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'making', 'feel', 'have', 'seen', ""n't"", 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Braveheart', 'Rob', 'Roy.I', 'do', 'not', 'complain', 'historical', 'things', 'anyway', 'legend', 'King', 'Arther', 'concept', 'famous', 'story', 'so', 'gratingly', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'see', 'Camelot', 'Merlin', 'not', 'use', 'magic', 'Guenevere', 'weapon', 'shoots', 'arrows', 'times', 'skins', 'painted', 'one', 'character', 'X-Men', 'say', 'campy', 'good', 'reasons', 'illicit', 'love', 'Lancelot', 'totally', 'gone', 'hey', 'family', 'picture', 'so', 'Gruffudd', 'soon', 'look', 'just', 'shadow', 'following', 'Arthur.If', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'newness', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'actions', 'fights', 'good', 'evil', 'know', 'can', 'see', 'John', 'Boorman-directed', 'Excalibur', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'choice']",King Arthur
851691,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0002YLCFQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","KING ARTHUR attempts to do what very few Arthur movies have done before.  The movie attempts to take the legend out of the Arthur story and place in within a semi-historical context.  The story the movie tells takes place towards the end of the Roman Empire (in fact, just about 25 years prior to Rome's actual fall) and just prior to the beginning of the Dark Ages that will sweep over most of Europe. Artorious Castus (Clive Owen), otherwise known as Arthur, is the leader of a special group of knights taken from their homeland by Rome and sent to the Empire's farthest realm, Brittain to defend the border along Hadrian's Wall for 15 years.Arthur has become a living legend in Brittain over the past 15 years and tales of his deeds have been told to the Pope in Rome. Arthur espouses a spirit of democracy, giving all a chance to speak, making plans together sitting around a round table. His methods are unorthodox, but successful and his men will follow him anywhere.  Lancelot, Galahad, Tristan, Gawain, and Bors are all that remain of the many who first sat at the table 15 years before.On the eve that Arthur and his knights are to be discharged, the Bishop gives them one last assignment.  Rome is abandoning Brittain to the Saxons. However, the Pope's favorite ""son"" and assumed heir, Alecto, are in danger of being killed by the invading Saxons. Arthur and his men are ordered to rescue the boy and his family and deliver them safe through Hadrian's Wall. It's a dangerous journey. Not only are the Saxon's a problem, but so are the natives--people Arthur have been fighting and killing for the past 15 years. But the times are changing and the land and people yearn to be united and to be free.KING ARTHUR has several things going for it.  First there is the acting. Clive Owen gives a great performance as Arthur, presented the legendary hero in a way not seen on screen before. There are several other good secondary performances (including Ray Winstone as Bors), but Keira Knightley is particularly interesting to watch as the pagan princess Guinevere.  The battles in the movie are quite action packed and enjoyable to watch. There's also a lot of great scenery. Then there's the concept, placing the Arthur story in a real historical context is something that really hasn't been done before.However, with all that KING ARTHUR has going for it, it suffers terribly from the one thing that ruins otherwise great movies more than any other, a bad script. The mission Arthur and his knights go on isn't all that cheesy and seems realistic.  The great battle literally on ice is a wonderful idea that was used to it's potential. However, it's all ruined by cheesy dialogue and copy-catism.  The last 20 minutes of KING ARTHUR (not including the final wedding scene) is a cheap rip-off right out of BRAVEHEART. Almost everything from Arthur's speech, to a sword in the ground, to the swelling score, and certain battle formations are copies that look almost identical to scenes from BRAVEHEART. Except, in KING ARTHUR the scenes come off as being comical (instead of a teeming army of poor Scotsman, Arthur delivers a passionate speech about not taking away our freedom to 4 knights). So much effort, wasted on one major scene and a few bad lines of dialogue and instead of getting a moving masterpiece on the possible historical King Arthur, we're left with an average movie that gives us an aftertaste of having seen this before in a much better way.This special edition of the DVD includes several features including an alternate ending, several featurettes, the usual director commentary, a knight trivia game, photo galleries, and an X-Box game demo.

But no, they had to chicken out by not distributing Michael Moore's controversial ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" rely on ""Home On the Range,"" and skip out on a cool several million bucks. Because of those actions (maybe more), Fuqua was ordered to hurry up and finish ""King Arthur"" to be released in the summer of 2004 and become botched down to a PG-13 rating, rather than the fall/winter release with the original R rating. Yep, Disney didn't have the summer blockbuster hits like the summer of 2003 had (them movies with the scurvy pirates and a lost fish), so ""King Arthur"" was their last hope. Behold, it wasn't as great in the box-office as one had expected it to be.""King Arthur"" tells the tale of Arthur and his knights, but in a different story. No sword-in-stone fantasy, but rather a tale set centuries before the ""fantasy King Arthur"" took place. It is an era called the Dark Ages, with Romans wandering around. Arthur (played by Clive Owen) leads his small group of knights, all of whom worked for Rome. Their time comes when they will be set free from doing such dangerous deeds, only to fulfill one last duty before becoming emancipated.A touchy subject becomes interjected minorly into the storyline: Christianity. Arthur and his knights seem to not have ""faith."" Well, just the knights, but Arthur retains a little faith. The knights are known as pagens... weird, eh? They denounce everything that deals with God and religion. And judging by the movie, it seems to say that religion in general is ""bad."" A few ""monks"" punish sinners in a sealed off section in a remote town. They basically stay down in a hole and starve those who commit, what seems to them, an act of sin. *shudders* Just think, some people are like that... and of course, the knights become the heroes by denouncing religion and saving the few survivors, including one named Guinevere (played by the beautiful Keira Knightley).Then things heat up when an army of ""Saxon"" (some Viking/Barbarian-type group of folk with a leader that looks like Rob Zombie with blonde hair) wreak havoc and threaten Roman inhabitants. Well... don't wanna give too much away, but I'll say that the action is quite impressive. Blood and limbs fly around (in the ""Director's Cut"" version, that is), but nothing too excessive as was seen in past movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart.""All the while as I watched this, I knew Antoine Fuqua would've made the film much better than what he has hastily presented here. It feels rushed and underdeveloped. We don't really get to know the ""other"" King Arthur in this movie. The storyline somewhat resembles ""Braveheart"" (fighting for freedom). Some of the acting is cringe-worthy.But nonetheless, ""King Arthur"" is a pure Hollywood movie. It does what it's supposed to do: entertain. I was well entertained. I mean, it has such impressive action scenes, CGI or not. Plenty of times where you'll go ""Oh!"" or ""Ugh!"" And notice I said only ""some of the acting is cringe-worthy."" I said ""some."" Clive Owen plays a brilliant Arthur. I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. Keira Knightley as always is brilliant. It's amazing what she was able to do in the action scenes. As for the other actors whose names I cannot remember: all did fine jobs, despite overacting (that includes our two main protagonists).For all you scholars and historical buffs, skip this movie and/or spare us your excessive knowledge of who King Arthur might have been.

851695,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B0002YLCFQ,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 3]","Anybody who knows anything about the history of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in the cinema knows that English director John Boorman staged the best version of the Arthurian myth in 1981 in his classic sword & sorcery saga ""Excalibur."" Before ""Excalibur"" set the gold standard, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced as their first widescreen film ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953) in blazing Technicolor with Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner. The 1967 musical ""Camelot"" featured Richard Harris as Arthur and Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere and the serviceable 1995 Sean Connery/Richard Gere swashbuckler ""First Knight"" both deserve honorable mention. Any of these four, however, would eclipse the latest rehash of the Arthur legend. Not only do ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua, ""Gladiator"" scripter David Franzoni and ""Pearl Harbor"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer strip the luster off the legend in their new movie ""King Arthur"" (** out of ****), but also they forego full-blown fantasy for half-baked fact. Based on 'recent archaeological findings,' Fuqua, Franzoni and Bruckheimer have revised the fable, so they can tell 'the untold true story that inspired the legend' in their tedious, long-winded, grimy, 130-minute mishmash of British mythology. Romance takes a back seat to the shoddily choreographed action sequences, and to preserve a PG-13 rating the filmmakers could only show blood on the combatant's swords. This time around Merlin appears as a wise elder with zero magical powers, while Guinevere emerges as a feisty battle maiden dressed up as a dominatrix packing a sword or a bow in either hand. Despite its mostly-Brit cast led by actor Clive Owen in a sterling performance as Arthur and ""Black Hawk Down"" lenser Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography, ""King Arthur"" does everything wrong in its misguided effort to create a new, different, and more realistic Arthur.""King Arthur"" concerns itself with the roots of the Round Table. In this handsomely produced but hackneyed hokum, we learn that the mythical Arthur owes everything to a real person who lived back in the Dark Ages during the Fifth Century. This Arthur (Clive Owen of ""Beyond Borders"") is a Roman officer in command of an elite cavalry unit consisting of guys from Sarmatia (somewhere near the modern Republic of Georgia in Europe) who made a pact with Marcus Aurelius to serve in his army for fifteen years. Imagine a gritty, down-to-earth ""Magnificent Seven"" as knights on horseback, and you'll have an idea what to expect. As the story unfolds, our heroes await their walking papers as Arthur discusses terms with Roman Bishop Germanius (Ivan Marescotti of ""Hannibal""). The Bishop cooks up a last-minute suicide mission for Arthur and his knights that requires them to cross Hadrian's Wall and liberate a Roman family living on a farm in the middle of enemy country. The savage Saxon hordes, like the Apaches in a western, are descending from every quarter, and the Romans are pulling out, so the Bishop needs somebody expendable. After Arthur and his knights reach the farm, they discover the slimy Roman has natives holed up in a dungeon where he tortures them in the name of the Vatican. A wizened shaman named Merlin advises these rebellious Woads, and Guinevere (Keira Knightley of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") is one of them, locked up and tormented until Arthur sets her free. Now, our heroes must escort this motley crew through treacherous territory with the murderous Saxons breathing down their necks every inch of the way.The chief problem with ""King Arthur"" lies in David Franzoni's dreadful screenplay. The rescue mission on which Arthur and the knights embark resembles an uninspired 1950's era cavalry western. Interestingly, the rescue recalls Fuqua's lackluster last opus ""Tears of the Sun"" with Bruce Willis. In ""King Arthur,"" Franzoni and Fuqua make the fatal mistake of taking themselves far, far too seriously. Not even actor Ray Winstone's churlish character Bors can redeem ""King Arthur."" As a chivalrous Round Table Knight, Bors is a poorly dressed shaven-headed lout with several illegitimate children who threatens to marry their mother. Fuqua and company play Bors largely for laughs. Using crude contemporary slang, Bors becomes the first on-screen knight to carp about the need to urinate. Hans Zimmer's dirge-like orchestral music hangs tragically over the ponderous action. Fuqua should stick to helming urban thrillers like ""The Replacement Killers"" and ""Training Day,"" because he cannot orchestrate epic battle sequences. The larger-than-life battle between our heroes and the villainous Saxons on an iced-over lake lacks dramatic intensity, though the underwater shots bolster the suspense. Watching Keira Knightley triumph over opponents twice her size in combat stretches credibility to the breaking point. Meanwhile, the underwritten characters of Gawain, Tristan and Galahad spend most of their time on the periphery of the action, while the heavy-handed historical exposition bogs down the action. Stellan Skarsgard doesn't make much of an impression as the villain through his bearded face and whispered dialogue. Franzoni pulls a surprise that cannot be revealed without spoiling the plot. Believe me, when it happens, you will feel cheated. As for the love triangle involving Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot, ""King Arthur"" leaves it out! In their quest for a more historically accurate interpretation of the Arthurian legend, the people who made ""King Arthur"" strive to live down the legend.

But were they real?  Did Arthur really become King of Britain with knights, was there a Round table, did Excalibur exist as did Guenivere and Merlin?  This movie says that they did but not in the way we all remember.The story here is that Arthur is a Roman Knight who is defending Britain from the Celts.  His knights consist of only five men, most from a country to the East.  The knights have never been defeated in battle and their 15 years of serving the Roman Empire are almost up.  However Rome wants them to complete a nearly suicidal task in going into the Northern Britain (where the Celts rule) and rescuing this rich Roman Family before they are killed.  Arthur and his men have no choice but to obey or be labled deserters and face death.  They leave for this quest and in the process witness the atrocities that the Romans can do as well as face a new threat of the Spartans.This movie is supposed to be a Historical retelling of the legend but many aspects that most people know of are not even touched or ignored all together, such as the Love Triangle between Arthur, Gueinver, and Lancalot.  Also the battle sequences, while good, end up copying from other movies such as Braveheart and the Patriot.  In the end though this is an entertaining movie, and is worth checking out.

851697,ABJPGGF29R7LE,B0002YLCFQ,V. Nunez,"[24, 49]","I was excited to see this movie originally.  I wanted it to be a darker and more complex version of the intriguing myth of Arthur and his knights.  After Camelot the musical, King Arthur and his story needed a bit of darkness and complexity.  But this movie feeds off that want to merely give a sketch of something that could have been unique.The script doesn't allow its characters to do much of anything other than fight with one another and their enemies.  The main point of the movie is lost because the audience has no real reason to care for these men.  We all know the main story of Arthur and Camelot, but if you're trying to give a new feeling/edge to an old story you should start by redescribing your characters to the audience, which is what the writers try to do but ultimately fail.  And in this film all we're left to see is a ragtag team of soldiers who only talk to going home.  If only the writers could have taken a little more time to explore who these characters are the film may have meant more.I feel bad for the excellent actors who were used in this film.  Clive Owen is a great actor of independent films, who should be famous by now.  Ioan Gruffudd is wonderful in Horatio Hornblower.  And Keira Knightley has shown her blooming talent in Bruckheimer's Pirates of the Carribbean.  They all try to lift this film to a higher level but the script leaves very little for them to do other than show their spectacularly staged fighting skills. Even the love triangle, one of the most famous aspects of the legend, feels strained, overly simplified, and not that interesting.",2,Rent Pirates of the Caribbean  or Gladiator instead,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,1596,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'originally', 'wanted', 'be', 'darker', 'more', 'complex', 'version', 'intriguing', 'myth', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'Camelot', 'musical', 'King', 'Arthur', 'story', 'needed', 'bit', 'darkness', 'complexity', 'movie', 'off', 'want', 'merely', 'give', 'sketch', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'unique.The', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'characters', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'other', 'fight', 'one', 'enemies', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'lost', 'audience', 'real', 'reason', 'care', 'men', 'know', 'main', 'story', 'Arthur', 'Camelot', ""'re"", 'trying', 'give', 'new', 'feeling/edge', 'old', 'story', 'should', 'start', 'redescribing', 'characters', 'audience', 'what', 'writers', 'try', 'do', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'film', ""'re"", 'left', 'see', 'ragtag', 'team', 'soldiers', 'who', 'only', 'talk', 'going', 'home', 'only', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'explore', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'meant', 'more.I', 'feel', 'bad', 'excellent', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'great', 'actor', 'independent', 'films', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'famous', 'now', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'wonderful', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'shown', 'blooming', 'talent', 'Bruckheimer', 'Pirates', 'Carribbean', 'try', 'lift', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'script', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'show', 'spectacularly', 'staged', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Even', 'love', 'triangle', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'aspects', 'legend', 'feels', 'strained', 'overly', 'simplified', 'not', 'interesting']",King Arthur
851698,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B0002YLCFQ,Wanda B. Red,"[3, 9]","This film is about as historically accurate as any Arthur movie, which is to say -- not very.It's not ""your grandmother's"" King Arthur, to be sure, because it's not based on Thomas Malory as reread and recast by Tennyson, T. H. White, and the movie ""Camelot."" But it is not the ""real"" King Arthur either, whatever credentials a History Channel documentary may have given it. Consider only that the ""Sarmatian"" theory of the origin of Arthur's knights (followed here) traces them back to the second century, but this film clearly takes place 300 years later. Enough of history.The movie therefore needs to be judged on its artistic merits, just like other films of King Arthur. There the record is mixed. Clive Owen makes a good King Arthur. He possesses the requisite mixture of gravitas and sex appeal. Keira Knightley is a little too sprightly to be believable as the warrior queen Guinevere, but she is not lacking in charm. Ioan Gruffudd is sexy enough to be Lancelot, but too little is made here of the love triangle. Stellan Skarsgard is admirably scary as the Saxon King Cerdic, with his growly voice and matted blonde locks. My candidate for worst contribution to the Arthurian story, however, must be Ray Winstone as Bors, whose meatiness and labored humor represents this film at its worst. This is ""Comic Relief"" with a capital C and a capital R. All that is missing is the laugh track.

Fortunately, the stylish direction, sharp performances and flavor of the time saves this film from falling into &quot;TV movie&quot; territory. In this retelling of the Arthur legend, we're given a more &quot;realistic&quot; take on Arthur. Based on evidence that Arthur may have been a Roman soldier serving in Britian, we meet a man who values honor, democracy and always remains true to his knights.Arthur and his knights are indentured servants forced to serve in the military for Rome. They've done their time and expect the new Bishop to provide them with papers giving them their freedom. The Bishop has other plans, however, and asks Arthur and his knights to go on what amounts to a suicide mission. They're charged with saving a Roman family surrounded by invading Saxons. To do this Arthur must travel through hostile territory where native Brits led by Merlin ambush and attack the Romans with regularity.Arthur agrees because of his duty to Rome but also so he can see Lancelot, Gwain and the rest of his surviving knights (there are only six now)return to the homes they gave up when forced to serve Rome.Well directed by Antoine Fuque, &quot;King Arthur&quot; follows in the wake of John Boorman's early 80's retelling &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Beyond the basic characters, there's little in common between the two films. That's to the former films advantage. The splendid action sequences and beautiful cinematography as well as the strong performances save &quot;King Arthur&quot; from becoming &quot;Robin Hood Price of Thieves&quot;. &quot;King Arthur&quot; compares well with other films looking at the same themes although the characters are sketchy at best and we're never given any background on any character except for Arthur and Lancelot. The other knights kind of melt into the background because of this.&quot;King Arthur&quot; provides an enjoyable evening of entertainment but it isn't without some severe flaws. Luckily, the talent of the director, cast and the production values overcome any shortcomings in the bold, imaginative but underwritten script.",4,Stylish with action to spare but weak on characterization,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2145,"['quot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'quot', 'be', 'things', 'people', 'Fortunately', 'stylish', 'direction', 'sharp', 'performances', 'flavor', 'time', 'film', 'falling', 'quot', 'TV', 'movie', 'quot', 'territory', 'retelling', 'Arthur', 'legend', ""'re"", 'given', 'more', 'quot', 'realistic', 'quot', 'take', 'Arthur', 'Based', 'evidence', 'Arthur', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Roman', 'soldier', 'serving', 'Britian', 'meet', 'man', 'who', 'honor', 'democracy', 'always', 'true', 'knights.Arthur', 'knights', 'are', 'indentured', 'servants', 'forced', 'serve', 'military', 'Rome', ""'ve"", 'done', 'time', 'expect', 'new', 'Bishop', 'provide', 'papers', 'giving', 'freedom', 'Bishop', 'other', 'plans', 'however', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'go', 'amounts', 'suicide', 'mission', ""'re"", 'charged', 'saving', 'Roman', 'family', 'surrounded', 'invading', 'Saxons', 'do', 'Arthur', 'must', 'travel', 'hostile', 'territory', 'where', 'native', 'Brits', 'led', 'Merlin', 'ambush', 'attack', 'Romans', 'regularity.Arthur', 'agrees', 'duty', 'Rome', 'also', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'Lancelot', 'Gwain', 'rest', 'surviving', 'knights', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'now', 'return', 'homes', 'gave', 'up', 'when', 'forced', 'serve', 'Rome.Well', 'directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuque', 'quot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'quot', 'wake', 'John', 'Boorman', 'early', '80', 'retelling', 'quot', 'Excalibur', 'quot', 'basic', 'characters', 'little', 'common', 'two', 'films', 'former', 'films', 'advantage', 'splendid', 'action', 'sequences', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'performances', 'save', 'quot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'quot', 'becoming', 'quot', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Price', 'Thieves', 'quot', 'quot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'quot', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'looking', 'same', 'themes', 'characters', 'are', 'sketchy', 'best', ""'re"", 'never', 'given', 'background', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Lancelot', 'other', 'knights', 'kind', 'melt', 'background', 'this.', 'quot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'severe', 'flaws', 'Luckily', 'talent', 'director', 'cast', 'production', 'overcome', 'shortcomings', 'bold', 'imaginative', 'underwritten', 'script']",King Arthur

If you have even the remotest notion of what the Arthurian legends are about, please dismiss them before watching this movie, because you will otherwise spend the entire time saying things like ""No WAY!"" and ""Wha?"" and other rude things.Let's get to the point: There is no Excalibur, no Morgan Le Fey, no Camelot. Arthur, who is broodingly played by Clive Owen, eminently forgettable in the role, has no visible means of income, but has a Round Table that could be the pride of any hip New York decorator. The Knights reminded me of nothing so much as Robin Hood's Merry Men, from their looks to their ribald jousting--I kept forgetting what movie I was watching.And then there is Guinevere. I adore Keira Knightley, and she did look so pretty, and so very fierce--but excuse me: She fights in battle beside her man (a nod to modern-day political correctness, one assumes), even when no other woman fights. While her comrades in arms dress appropriately for battle in animal skins and armor and heavy protective garb, she fights in two strategically placed straps over her (ahem) chest. And while nobody else is painted blue, she has taken the time in the forest before this pivotal battle to paint blue and interesting symbols all over herself (drawing attention to key assets).The leader of the Saxons looks exactly like Willie Nelson, complete with gray braided hair, and his son, who inexplicably has a brush cut (but did braid his beard), looks like Beckham.OK, go see if it you must. The battle scenes, especially the one on the cracking ice, are great. The acting is strangely uninspired, to match the brooding monochromatic camerawork.

851704,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0002YLCFQ,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[3, 4]","This is a very good swashbuckler, with a bit more reality than the typical Arthur. To tell the truth, I like seeing a bit less magic and a bit more that makes sense. For example, this movie retells the ""sword in the stone."" That retelling loses the hocus-pocus and prophecy, but gains a lot in personal, human meaning. The movie demotes Merlin from some mystical being to a pagan priest/leader. On the other hand, he is also promoted to powerful political figure, prepared to weigh the relative threats of different enemies and shift alliances as needed.The battle scenes show some real creativity. The fight on the iced lake, even when you know the outcome well in advance, still builds well. The excitement of the final battle was not just due to the sheer mass of its mayhem, it also had a tempo and some scripting to keep the viewer watching.Of course, Knightley's Guinevere kept people watching, too. The babe appeal was there, especially in that combat uniform. If you haven't seen it yet - well, there are some outfits that really require a figure as slim as hers. More than that, though, I enjoyed the role of Guinevere as battle-maid and woman who gets what she wants. Oh, and the ""sword upheld"" at the end was a nice touch, too.This movie offers a lot, just not the King Arthur of myth. If you want the chivalry, questing, and pining of the standard story, you just won't find what you want. This movie really has to be taken as a mideval action flick of its own, not a retelling of the familiar story.

Runtime: 142 minutes.""King Arthur"" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films ""Braveheart,"" ""Rob Roy"" and ""First Knight,"" as well as 2006's totally underrated ""Tristan and Isolde (Widescreen Edition),"" which I feel is the best of the batch.""King Arthur"" is my second favorite, followed by the underated ""Centurion"" from 2010. ""King Arthur"" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsgrd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a ""Woad"").The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of ""home"" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes. This reminds me of this story of a Texas minister who wanted to move to a place with small lakes & springs, etc. and the LORD told him it was ALREADY there on his property, he just had to use his imagination and create it. So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or ""home"") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes!FINAL WORD: I put off seeing ""King Arthur"" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like ""First Knight"" or ""Excalibur"" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but ""King Arthur"" is totally different.

Stationed in the north of Britain, near Hadrian's Wall,  they defend the land from the Saxon Threat and marauding bands of blue-painted natives, or ""Woads,"" under tribal leader Merlin.As a fantasy movie, _King Arthur_ was really pretty enjoyable.  The hero is struggling with the usual fantasy choice between loyalty to a country and loyalty to his inner sense of what is right, discovering along the way that the country he serves is not what he thought and the ""savages"" he's been fighting so long are more noble than some of his own people. Although this means that every time Clive Owen opens his mouth he's delivering some variation on Henry V's ""Saint Crispin Day"" speech, it makes for a good enough plot device. The sets and costumes are well done;  there are some exciting battle sequences and lovely visual imagery.  Even as Arthurian interpretation, this movie wasn't bad.  There's plenty of historical evidence that Arthur was, in fact, a legion commander under just such circumstances.  And I really liked the portrayal of Merlin and Guinevere as Picts--although I thought the movie could have made much better use of both of them.However.  If you're going to present something as history, revisionist or otherwise, you really need to get your details straight, and there was so much wrong with _King Arthur_ in this department that I spent a good part of the film groaning.  For example:  in the fifth century, the crossbow hadn't yet been invented.  Even if they had, the Saxons wouldn't have used them, because they considered anything but hand-to-hand combat cowardly.  The Saxons didn't raid to the north--the Wall was to keep the Picts at bay, not Raiders--and they didn't raid in winter.  Nor did they come in large organized armies bent on conquest.  A Roman villa would never have been built north of the Wall, which marked the boundary of the Empire.  And why would a band of Indentured Sarmatian knights have names from 15th century French Romances?I'm firmly of the opinion that much folklore and legend has root in historical events.  The Matter of Britain is a complex tale and probably had complex roots.  _King Arthur_ oversimplified them and eliminated any reference to possible causes except the names.  By the end of the movie I was left wondering how such a moving story could have come from such banal source material.I'd like to see a historical Arthur done well some day, with the attention to detail and character that it deserves.  This wasn't it, but it's an okay movie as long as you can ignore the names.",2,"As Fantasy, Okay--As History:  NOT!",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2797,"['_King', 'Arthur_', 'purports', 'set', 'historical', 'record', 'straight', 'making', 'Arthur', 'Artorius', 'Romano-British', 'Legion', 'Commander', 'charge', 'band', 'knights', 'warriors', 'conquered', 'middle-eastern', 'tribe', 'Sarmatians', 'renowned', 'heir', 'horsemanship', 'Stationed', 'north', 'Britain', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'defend', 'land', 'Saxon', 'Threat', 'marauding', 'bands', 'blue-painted', 'natives', 'Woads', 'tribal', 'leader', 'Merlin.As', 'fantasy', 'movie', '_King', 'Arthur_', 'was', 'really', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'hero', 'struggling', 'usual', 'fantasy', 'choice', 'loyalty', 'country', 'loyalty', 'inner', 'sense', 'what', 'right', 'discovering', 'way', 'country', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'savages', 'been', 'fighting', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'more', 'noble', 'own', 'people', 'time', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'mouth', 'delivering', 'variation', 'Henry', 'V', 'Saint', 'Crispin', 'Day', 'speech', 'good', 'enough', 'plot', 'device', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'exciting', 'battle', 'sequences', 'lovely', 'visual', 'imagery', 'Even', 'Arthurian', 'interpretation', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'plenty', 'historical', 'evidence', 'Arthur', 'was', 'fact', 'legion', 'commander', 'just', 'such', 'circumstances', 'really', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'Merlin', 'Guinevere', 'Picts', 'thought', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'them.However', ""'re"", 'going', 'present', 'something', 'history', 'revisionist', 'otherwise', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'details', 'straight', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', '_King', 'Arthur_', 'department', 'spent', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'groaning', 'example', 'fifth', 'century', 'crossbow', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'invented', 'Even', 'had', 'Saxons', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'considered', 'anything', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'cowardly', 'Saxons', 'did', ""n't"", 'raid', 'north', 'Wall', 'was', 'keep', 'Picts', 'bay', 'not', 'Raiders', 'did', ""n't"", 'raid', 'winter', 'did', 'come', 'large', 'organized', 'armies', 'bent', 'conquest', 'Roman', 'villa', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'north', 'Wall', 'marked', 'boundary', 'Empire', 'why', 'would', 'band', 'Indentured', 'Sarmatian', 'knights', 'have', 'names', '15th', 'century', 'French', 'Romances', ""'m"", 'firmly', 'opinion', 'much', 'folklore', 'legend', 'root', 'historical', 'events', 'Matter', 'Britain', 'complex', 'tale', 'probably', 'had', 'complex', 'roots', '_King', 'Arthur_', 'oversimplified', 'eliminated', 'reference', 'possible', 'causes', 'names', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'such', 'moving', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'such', 'banal', 'source', 'material.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'historical', 'Arthur', 'done', 'well', 'day', 'attention', 'detail', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'okay', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'ignore', 'names']",King Arthur

Just because a story is allegedly more fact-based doesn't make it more entertaining; on the contrary, it's been proven time and time again that the opposite is true. So exactly why director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer chose to ""de-myth"" the tale of King Arthur is a mystery-one that I don't care enough to solve, in light of the disappointing results.The film showcases what may be the most uncharismatic King Arthur in cinema history (played by the usually reliable Clive Owen). Does it matter that Arthur is presented as a 5th-century British-born Roman general, in accordance with the limited historical data available? Likewise, the familiar characters of Sir Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Lady Guinevere (Keira Knightley) are deglamorized to the point of being shallow and unsympathetic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we supposed to be rooting for them?If we are to take it on face value that this is a more accurate depiction of the era than we've ever witnessed before, then they must have had one hell of a dental program back in the 5th-century, judging from the pearly-white smiles of the lead players. And how about that bare-midriff action-hero outfit Guinevere wears during the final battle sequence? Based on historical record, no doubt.In addition to its confused plotting and excessive noise level, KING ARTHUR is one of the grimmest and grimiest-looking major studio productions since Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. And yet the distributor had the nerve to use the tag line ""From the producer of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" in the marketing campaign. The colorful and engagingly offbeat PIRATES was lively fun for the entire family, and to have used its success to promote a movie as dull and unpleasant as KING ARTHUR was a great disservice to unsuspecting parents and children.",2,"Give me the legend, spare me the facts",1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1903,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'revisionist', 'attempts', 'telling', 'familiar', 'legends', 'Just', 'story', 'allegedly', 'more', 'fact-based', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'contrary', 'been', 'proven', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'opposite', 'true', 'So', 'exactly', 'why', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'TRAINING', 'DAY', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'chose', 'de-myth', 'tale', 'King', 'Arthur', 'mystery-one', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'solve', 'light', 'disappointing', 'results.The', 'film', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'uncharismatic', 'King', 'Arthur', 'cinema', 'history', 'played', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'matter', 'Arthur', 'presented', '5th-century', 'British-born', 'Roman', 'general', 'accordance', 'limited', 'historical', 'data', 'available', 'Likewise', 'familiar', 'characters', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Lady', 'Guinevere', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'are', 'deglamorized', 'point', 'being', 'shallow', 'unsympathetic', 'Correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'are', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'more', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'era', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'before', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'hell', 'dental', 'program', 'back', '5th-century', 'judging', 'pearly-white', 'smiles', 'lead', 'players', 'how', 'bare-midriff', 'action-hero', 'outfit', 'Guinevere', 'final', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Based', 'historical', 'record', 'doubt.In', 'addition', 'confused', 'plotting', 'excessive', 'noise', 'level', 'KING', 'ARTHUR', 'one', 'grimmest', 'grimiest-looking', 'major', 'studio', 'productions', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'BATMAN', 'RETURNS', 'yet', 'distributor', 'had', 'nerve', 'use', 'tag', 'line', 'producer', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'colorful', 'engagingly', 'offbeat', 'PIRATES', 'was', 'lively', 'fun', 'entire', 'family', 'have', 'used', 'success', 'promote', 'movie', 'dull', 'unpleasant', 'KING', 'ARTHUR', 'was', 'great', 'disservice', 'unsuspecting', 'parents', 'children']",King Arthur
