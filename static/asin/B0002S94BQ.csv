844523,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002S94BQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 8]","I thought that I had a better review for this mini-series, but it looks like I may have shut it away in the trash vault.  So, for just this one I am going to give you the short, short version of what I witnessed.  5ive Days to Midnight was one of those classic mini-series that probably did very well while on television in keeping the suspense high and the anticipation even higher, but when it transferred onto DVD it didn't succeed as well.  When one has the opportunity to watch this series from beginning to end within the course of one day, the excitement and momentum slowly decreases.  Let me be more exact.The first three episodes were great.  It was this beautifully mixed bag of drama and sci-fi that I know the Sci-Fi channel has a firm grip on.  It kept me guessing and wondering what would happen next.  I couldn't quite figure out exactly how all the pieces were going to fit together and it was enjoyable, then you put the second disc in and watch the final two episodes and everything going for this film goes down the toilet.  The final two episodes are nothing but filler and the ironically planned confusing ending.  I felt that these final two episodes just did not react well with the first three, there seemed to be something genuinely missing from all of this.  It was as if the creators had the horse running at full speed at first, then allowed it to gallop into the final lap.  It lost momentum, speed, and thrill when the second disc hit my DVD player.The acting was decent with Quaid proving why the ""TV"" niche is his best friend.  Hutton could have done a bit better, portraying this struggling victim to this predestined crime, but instead I think he realized this was ""television"" and went with some sub-par skills.  While the acting was just average all around, I was o.k. with that, it was the story that I was hoping to get most of my strength from.  Sadly, the story was good, but not great.  There were huge, gaping plot holes that just were never covered or corrected.  When you are doing a time traveling film like this, you need this to make a coherent statement.  It is like writing a paper without using any punctuation, you don't know where to stop or end and it ends up a jumbled mess.  That is what happened with the final two episodes, the jumbled mess caught up to the creators and there was only one way to stop it ... clich&eacute;s and unoriginality.Overall, I was impressed to begin this series, but by the end, I had lost it completely.  The fourth day is nothing but filler, and that set the mood well off for the final day.  What began as this very interesting time travel drama/murder/mystery eventually turned into a regular program that you could find on any station. Something happened, and as we the viewers may never know, those involved do.  I suggest to everyone checking out the first disc while leaving the second behind.  If you need to know how it ends, forget about it.  The first three days will leave a better taste in your mouth than the final two days, and overall you will feel better (even if you don't know how it ends!)Grade: *** out of *****",3,By the 5ifth day I was bored...,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,3117,"['thought', 'had', 'better', 'review', 'mini-series', 'may', 'have', 'shut', 'away', 'trash', 'vault', 'So', 'just', 'one', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'short', 'short', 'version', 'what', 'witnessed', '5ive', 'Days', 'Midnight', 'was', 'one', 'classic', 'mini-series', 'probably', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'television', 'keeping', 'suspense', 'high', 'anticipation', 'even', 'higher', 'when', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'one', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'series', 'beginning', 'end', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'excitement', 'momentum', 'slowly', 'Let', 'be', 'more', 'exact.The', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'were', 'great', 'was', 'beautifully', 'mixed', 'bag', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'know', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'firm', 'grip', 'kept', 'guessing', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'pieces', 'were', 'going', 'fit', 'together', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'then', 'put', 'second', 'disc', 'watch', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'everything', 'going', 'film', 'down', 'toilet', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'nothing', 'filler', 'ironically', 'planned', 'confusing', 'ending', 'felt', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'react', 'well', 'first', 'three', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'genuinely', 'missing', 'was', 'creators', 'had', 'horse', 'running', 'full', 'speed', 'first', 'then', 'allowed', 'gallop', 'final', 'lap', 'lost', 'momentum', 'speed', 'thrill', 'when', 'second', 'disc', 'hit', 'DVD', 'player.The', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'Quaid', 'proving', 'why', 'TV', 'niche', 'best', 'friend', 'Hutton', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'portraying', 'struggling', 'victim', 'predestined', 'crime', 'instead', 'think', 'realized', 'was', 'television', 'went', 'sub-par', 'skills', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'was', 'o.k', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'most', 'strength', 'Sadly', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'were', 'huge', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'just', 'were', 'never', 'covered', 'corrected', 'When', 'are', 'doing', 'time', 'traveling', 'film', 'need', 'make', 'coherent', 'statement', 'writing', 'paper', 'using', 'punctuation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'stop', 'end', 'up', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'what', 'happened', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'caught', 'up', 'creators', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'stop', 'clich', 'eacute', 'unoriginality.Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'begin', 'series', 'end', 'had', 'lost', 'completely', 'fourth', 'day', 'nothing', 'filler', 'set', 'mood', 'well', 'final', 'day', 'What', 'began', 'very', 'interesting', 'time', 'travel', 'drama/murder/mystery', 'eventually', 'turned', 'regular', 'program', 'could', 'find', 'station', 'Something', 'happened', 'viewers', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'involved', 'do', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'checking', 'out', 'first', 'disc', 'leaving', 'second', 'behind', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'forget', 'first', 'three', 'days', 'will', 'leave', 'better', 'taste', 'mouth', 'final', 'two', 'days', 'overall', 'will', 'feel', 'better', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Grade', '***', '*****']",5ive Days To Midnight

844538,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0002S94BQ,Kevin Killian,"[7, 11]","5IVE DAYS TO MIDNIGHT is one of my favorite TV miniseries.  Like ROOTS or HOLOCAUST it is best seen on TV, with the days spread apart, so that you can build up some excitement about seeing the next part, but on DVD you can kind of glom everything together; indeed you don't even have to watch the show in order--*though I would highly advise it.*  If you don't, the story is too confusing.On SciFi you'd be watching ""Monday's"" episode on a Monday; it was cleverly done and you couldn't wait till Tuesday!  Tim Hutton isn't my favorite actor, but he did a fine job in this as the doomed professor.  And fun to see him with Kari Matchett as the two co-stars of NERO WOLFE are matchless together.  Watching Hutton break into the briefcase and find his obituary was chilling and you wanted to think that there must be some mistake, some loophole, some way in which he could survive the next five days.  I was thinking, well, he has the same name as his daughter (I mean the same initials, her name is Jesse) maybe the daughter is the one who is going to die?  She was only ten or so, but because the story is all about time travel it was easy to think, maybe she grew up and became a professor like her dad?  And that is whom the briefcase was addressed to!  The one in the car from PULP FICTION!  The show also references the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, which also occurred ten years prior to the events of 5IVE DAYS TO MIDNIGHT, making you think a little bit, your restless brain searching for some solution, some tie up, of history's loose threads.In a way the briefcase reminded me of the famous attache case in PULP FICTION, said to contain someone's soul-remember that?  Ten years ago, so right around the birth of little Jesse?  Lovely Nicole De Boer is in the movie too, from CUBE, and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, she's a regular SciFi channel regular.  You may not know who she is from her name, but once you see her face it's an assurance that the quality science fiction product you are watching was filmed in Canada.Randy Quaid is pretty good, although I found myself wondering why the producers couldn't have found someone who mumbled less.  I could barely make out what he was saying half the time as ""Irwin"" launched into one topic after another.

As he investigates further, Neumeyer enlists the help of the homicide detective (Randy Quaid) who investigated (will investigate) his murder.

Good thing...I probably would never pay much for this if I knew ahead what it was.  It's a fairly good story overall, but gets tedious at times and predictable as to what plot device they're going to use next.  You are rather kept guessing as to who did it...though my initial hunch was spot-on, as what I figured was going to be the ending as well.  There were some annoying sequences of the main characters being spied on, and some typical bait and switch tactics as well, and a bit more of unrealistic mafia boss acting thrown in as well. Not really a spoiler, but if he did what he did to me, and not our hero...I'd have capped him right then and there...you'll know what I mean.The acting was fairly well done throughout and what special effects there were seemed good enough considering it was made-for-TV.  I couldn't believe just how fat Randy Quaid got...wow...that's the biggest surprise...and his acting skills are more fitted for Vacation movies and odd-ball stuff.  No need to rehash plot...everybody else did that already.  I'd suggest writing down your first hunch...see if you got it right.The only really face-smackingly obvious thing is what motivates the killer, and the all-too unrealistic *SPOILER* attitude that Hutton's character has in not taking full advantage of knowledge of the future and the predictable set-up he causes by not sharing or taking advantage of the wealth that could be made from it. I hate when people don't act realistic when it comes to money. Really...would you turn down fore-knowledge of technology that could make you a bazillion dollars? If you said yes, then I'll take that winning lotto ticket off your hands. It should have been OBVIOUS that this was the driving factor in motivating his death...which rates this movie lower on the believability scale for him not even remotely figuring that out and acting to change that.I think I enjoyed this a bit only because it reminded me a lot of Lost and the ""What Happened Happened"" theme throughout...and the characters' struggles knowing what happens to see what they can do to change it.  If you liked Lost for this, you will find this worth watching. Seriously, I wouldn't pay much...since you'll probably not want to watch it again...which is why I went to see if my library had it.

The only actors truly wasted are Giancarlo Esposito and Nicole de Boer. This TV mini-series seemed to stretch things out a bit too long. It would have worked much better as a two hour or two and a half hour TV movie. Director Michael W. Watkins uses a number of annoyingly over used techinques to create additional suspense (such as slow motion and shooting scenes at a higher speed or eliminating frames to make the motion appear choppy).A solid TV mini-series that would have worked better if it was cut down to two hours vs. nearly four, ""5ive Days to Midnight"" is still worthwhile.
