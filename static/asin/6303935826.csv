390722,A5IPEZBOFCV5Q,6303935826,James R. Morrella,"[0, 0]",I had the privilege to meet Mr. Rogers when I was 7 years old in 1956. He taught me what class really is. My father brought me to Madison Square Garden to see the rodeo. He knew the stage manager and took me into the rear of the Garden where Mr. Rogers dressing room was. He was not supposed to be bothered and I could see he was understandingly annoyed. The Stage Manager told him about my having polio (I wore a brace for 12 years). Roy immediately came over to me and put his arm around me. Took a picture (which I still have). If you watch this you will find out that Roy was quite a man. We need more like Roy today.,5,BIOGRAPHY - ROY ROGERS,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,621,"['had', 'privilege', 'meet', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'when', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', '1956', 'taught', 'what', 'class', 'really', 'father', 'brought', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'see', 'rodeo', 'knew', 'stage', 'manager', 'took', 'rear', 'Garden', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'dressing', 'room', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'bothered', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'understandingly', 'annoyed', 'Stage', 'Manager', 'told', 'having', 'polio', 'wore', 'brace', '12', 'years', 'Roy', 'immediately', 'came', 'put', 'arm', 'Took', 'picture', 'still', 'have', 'watch', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'Roy', 'was', 'quite', 'man', 'need', 'more', 'Roy', 'today']",Biography - Roy Rogers: American Legend VHS
