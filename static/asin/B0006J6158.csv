Even after watching it for 100 of times on each episode it is still interesting and funny as always. It is a wonder it was classified as No. 1 classic series in signication.Although first 2 series in Black and White it is clear on this DVD series.A must for all Gilligan Fans,5,Still funny as Gilligan can be,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,361,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'series', 'continued', 'watching', 'classic', 'life', 'Even', 'watching', '100', 'times', 'episode', 'still', 'interesting', 'funny', 'always', 'wonder', 'was', 'classified', 'No', '1', 'classic', 'series', 'signication.Although', 'first', '2', 'series', 'Black', 'White', 'clear', 'DVD', 'series.A', 'must', 'Gilligan', 'Fans']",N/A

Morgan ""Light Coach""","[0, 12]","The professor can make a nuclear reactor with a coconut and a banana peel, but can't somehow fix a two foot hole on the boat that marooned these goof balls?This show was completely dumb...not just a little bit dumb...completely dumb. I totally believe in Karma and these characters must've done some pretty heavy duty stuff to stay on that island. Some speculate that the characters on ABC's Lost are in purgatory even though that theory has been dismissed, but the characters on Gilligan's Island are totally and completely in hell...it really is a good thing they're stuck on this island with each other because they are too dumb to share the world with other people.First of all, no matter what happens, Gilligan's to blame. Somebody eats too much coconut cream pie and has the poops, its Gilligan's fault; somebody stole Ginger's underwear...never mind that it's in Mr. Howell's room... horny 'ol Gilligan must've stolen it; the Skipper has an ongoing case of gonorreah from his Navy Tour and screams like a crazy man every time he urinates, it's Gilligan's fault...maybe it really was his fault...the issue was never explored. The point is that Gilligan is the scapegoat for each and every episode and that gets just a little annoying.This show stinks and yet it's now regarded as a classic. Ew[...] A thousand years from now after we're all dead and buried, a future generation is going to unearth the Smithsonian under the rubble and find Gilligan's hat. They'll just shake their heads in sad disbelief, ""Well, no wonder...""There were a few moments of metaphysical brilliance, however. Gilligan, made a pair of wings out of some large palm frawns. He's falapping his arms and actually gets some air, he's flying in the air and the Skipper looks at him and screams out, ""Gilligan, you can't fly..."" Gilligan believing that the Skipper knows more than he does questions his ability to fly and quickly falls to the ground.Classic stuff.However those moments are too far and in between. I would rather look at the crud between my toes than watch Gilligan's Island. It's just so, so sad...I feel bad that after the show had its run, the actors who played these one dimensional characters now had shipwrecked careers and the only person who is making money on this show now is good 'ol Sherwood Schwartz...the same genius that gave us the Brady Bunch...P.S. It's not that bad...I was just messin' with you...I give it two coconuts...",2,Why Is It That....,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,2434,"['professor', 'can', 'make', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'coconut', 'banana', 'peel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'somehow', 'fix', 'two', 'foot', 'hole', 'boat', 'marooned', 'goof', 'balls', 'show', 'was', 'completely', 'dumb', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'dumb', 'completely', 'dumb', 'totally', 'believe', 'Karma', 'characters', 'must', ""'ve"", 'done', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'duty', 'stuff', 'stay', 'island', 'speculate', 'characters', 'ABC', 'Lost', 'are', 'purgatory', 'even', 'theory', 'been', 'dismissed', 'characters', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'are', 'totally', 'completely', 'hell', 'really', 'good', 'thing', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'island', 'other', 'are', 'too', 'dumb', 'share', 'world', 'other', 'people.First', 'matter', 'what', 'Gilligan', 'blame', 'Somebody', 'too', 'much', 'coconut', 'cream', 'pie', 'poops', 'Gilligan', 'fault', 'somebody', 'stole', 'Ginger', 'underwear', 'never', 'mind', 'Mr.', 'Howell', 'room', 'horny', 'Gilligan', 'must', ""'ve"", 'stolen', 'Skipper', 'ongoing', 'case', 'gonorreah', 'Navy', 'Tour', 'screams', 'crazy', 'man', 'time', 'Gilligan', 'fault', 'maybe', 'really', 'was', 'fault', 'issue', 'was', 'never', 'explored', 'point', 'Gilligan', 'scapegoat', 'episode', 'just', 'little', 'annoying.This', 'show', 'stinks', 'yet', 'now', 'regarded', 'classic', 'Ew', '[', 'thousand', 'years', 'now', ""'re"", 'dead', 'buried', 'future', 'generation', 'going', 'unearth', 'Smithsonian', 'rubble', 'find', 'Gilligan', 'hat', ""'ll"", 'just', 'shake', 'heads', 'sad', 'disbelief', 'Well', 'wonder', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'metaphysical', 'brilliance', 'however', 'Gilligan', 'made', 'pair', 'wings', 'large', 'palm', 'frawns', 'falapping', 'arms', 'actually', 'air', 'flying', 'air', 'Skipper', 'screams', 'out', 'Gilligan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'Gilligan', 'believing', 'Skipper', 'more', 'questions', 'ability', 'fly', 'quickly', 'ground.Classic', 'stuff.However', 'moments', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'would', 'rather', 'look', 'crud', 'toes', 'watch', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'feel', 'bad', 'show', 'had', 'run', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'now', 'had', 'shipwrecked', 'careers', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'making', 'money', 'show', 'now', 'good', ""'ol"", 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz', 'same', 'genius', 'gave', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'P.S', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'messin', 'give', 'two', 'coconuts']",N/A

This set would get zero stars for packaging.  First of all, someone really needs to outlaw double sided DVDs.  Double sided DVDs would be tolerable but the case design makes it worse.  Each time I try to get one of the disks out of the case I'm afraid I'm going to break the disk.  The release mechanism doesn't release the disks.  One has to wiggle and maneuver them to get them out.  There are four indentations for the purpose of grabbing the disks but their's a ridge around the bottom two making them unusable.",5,"Wonderful show, horrible packaging",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,628,"['rating', 'gave', 'item', 'solely', 'show', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'would', 'let', 'one', 'rate', 'packaging', 'separately', 'set', 'would', 'get', 'zero', 'stars', 'packaging', 'First', 'all', 'someone', 'really', 'outlaw', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'Double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'tolerable', 'case', 'design', 'worse', 'time', 'try', 'get', 'one', 'disks', 'case', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'m"", 'going', 'break', 'disk', 'release', 'mechanism', ""n't"", 'release', 'disks', 'One', 'wiggle', 'maneuver', 'get', 'out', 'are', 'four', 'indentations', 'purpose', 'grabbing', 'disks', 'ridge', 'bottom', 'two', 'making', 'unusable']",N/A

Although I could find nothing to indicate that they've been remastered, the quality is quite possibly too good.  Small details that were invisible on the small screens of years past are quite evident with today's technology; especially the make-up.  I'd never really noticed it before, but we're talking full-throttle ""drag queen"" make-up here.
