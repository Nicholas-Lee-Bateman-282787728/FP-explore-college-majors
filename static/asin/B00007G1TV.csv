727950,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00007G1TV,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 0]","As I predicted would happen in my review of volume four, the volumes continue to get better and better. And in this volume, at the very end, we finally see the demon that we see in the very first episode on volume one.In volume five, Guts finally has his independence from the Band of the Hawk, independence earned with some difficulty, as he had to lose his friendship with Griffith and ultimately turn his back on the other members of the the Band. What he doesn't know, however, is the damage he has done to the band at his departure. He's gone for a year, training himself at a small cottage in the woods owned by a blacksmith and his granddaughter, when rumor comes of a group of bandits in the nearby area who were said to have played in role in ending the 100-Year War of a year back. Guts, hearing that the bandits are being led by a woman, seeks them out and is finally reunited with old comrades, all but one. Griffith has been captured, and suffers terrible tortures. Guts, after hearing of this, decides to rejoin the Band long enough to free Griffith from his prison, and by the end of the fifth volume, the Band is on their way to do just that.If not for the ending of this volume, I would have been sure that the series would never had reached that promise they made with the first episode. I've since learned that this series will never exactly reach that point since it is only the first season, but I'm happy that at least they are taking the steps in that direction. This volume is key to the series, as it contains some of the most important story elements yet. I wouldn't miss it if you've already started collecting the series.",5,Dark Fantasy Part 5,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1649,"['predicted', 'would', 'happen', 'review', 'volume', 'four', 'volumes', 'continue', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'volume', 'very', 'end', 'finally', 'see', 'demon', 'see', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'volume', 'one.In', 'volume', 'five', 'Guts', 'finally', 'independence', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'independence', 'earned', 'difficulty', 'had', 'lose', 'friendship', 'Griffith', 'ultimately', 'turn', 'back', 'other', 'members', 'Band', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'however', 'damage', 'done', 'band', 'departure', 'gone', 'year', 'training', 'small', 'cottage', 'woods', 'owned', 'blacksmith', 'granddaughter', 'when', 'rumor', 'group', 'bandits', 'nearby', 'area', 'who', 'were', 'said', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'ending', '100-Year', 'War', 'year', 'back', 'Guts', 'hearing', 'bandits', 'are', 'being', 'led', 'woman', 'out', 'finally', 'reunited', 'old', 'comrades', 'one', 'Griffith', 'been', 'captured', 'suffers', 'terrible', 'tortures', 'Guts', 'hearing', 'rejoin', 'Band', 'long', 'enough', 'free', 'Griffith', 'prison', 'end', 'fifth', 'volume', 'Band', 'way', 'do', 'just', 'that.If', 'not', 'ending', 'volume', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sure', 'series', 'would', 'never', 'had', 'reached', 'promise', 'made', 'first', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'exactly', 'reach', 'point', 'only', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'happy', 'least', 'are', 'taking', 'steps', 'direction', 'volume', 'key', 'series', 'most', 'important', 'story', 'elements', 'yet', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', ""'ve"", 'already', 'started', 'collecting', 'series']",N/A
727951,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00007G1TV,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[4, 5]","&quot;Berserk&quot; presents the reviewer with an interesting dilemma.  One would have to be in complete denial to miss the fact that it is unabashed exploitative violence.  In a fascinating interview, Producer Toshio Nakatani makes it clear that the series was intentionally created for a late night TV slot where they felt they could draw its targeted 16+ audience.  The real question is if it is just exploitative violence or if the creative staff has managed to make it much more than that.This set of episodes, set in the 'quiet' before the storm are very much the proof of &quot;Berserk's&quot; real depth.  We see sides of many of the characters, main and supporting, that we have only glimpses before, and the sudden turns in the relationship between Caska and Guts are highlights of the series.  While we are never far from bloodshed, it becomes evident that it is there for more than simple fan service.The key to these episodes is the completion of Griffith's twisted defense against those who plotted to stop his rise to power.  Guts, in aiding Griffith this time, realizes that he needs to move on and seek is own purpose, putting his sword in no one else's service.  This precipitates a confrontation with Griffith that has far-reaching impact.  A year later, Guts is living with a sword smith, perfecting his skills, when he finds out that Griffith has been arrested for high treason, and the Hawks are in flight will Caska as leader.  Guts returns to help, and the result is quite surprising.The artwork in this set of episodes seems to do the best job of recalling the original manga work, with the illustrators deliberately shifting from anime style to something more painterly when the moment seems proper. The music, strong, and sometimes grating, underlines the nervous state of the characters, as they move into their places for the final drama.This is a harsh series, suiting its medieval setting, and the individual viewers will have to decide if it is what they seek.  For those that can deal with the violence without prejudice, there are many rewards for following the story.  Whatever you might think of it, it is certainly an outstanding example of its kind.",5,Blood and Roses,1053475200,"05 21, 2003",2003,2187,"['quot', 'Berserk', 'quot', 'reviewer', 'interesting', 'dilemma', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'complete', 'denial', 'miss', 'fact', 'unabashed', 'exploitative', 'violence', 'fascinating', 'interview', 'Producer', 'Toshio', 'Nakatani', 'clear', 'series', 'was', 'intentionally', 'created', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'slot', 'where', 'felt', 'could', 'draw', 'targeted', '16+', 'audience', 'real', 'question', 'just', 'exploitative', 'violence', 'creative', 'staff', 'managed', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'that.This', 'set', 'episodes', 'set', ""'quiet"", 'storm', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'proof', 'quot', 'Berserk', 'quot', 'real', 'depth', 'see', 'sides', 'many', 'characters', 'main', 'supporting', 'have', 'only', 'glimpses', 'sudden', 'turns', 'relationship', 'Caska', 'Guts', 'are', 'highlights', 'series', 'are', 'never', 'far', 'bloodshed', 'evident', 'there', 'more', 'simple', 'fan', 'service.The', 'key', 'episodes', 'completion', 'Griffith', 'twisted', 'defense', 'who', 'plotted', 'stop', 'rise', 'power', 'Guts', 'aiding', 'Griffith', 'time', 'move', 'seek', 'own', 'purpose', 'putting', 'sword', 'one', 'else', 'service', 'confrontation', 'Griffith', 'far-reaching', 'impact', 'year', 'later', 'Guts', 'living', 'sword', 'smith', 'perfecting', 'skills', 'when', 'out', 'Griffith', 'been', 'arrested', 'high', 'treason', 'Hawks', 'are', 'flight', 'will', 'Caska', 'leader', 'Guts', 'help', 'result', 'quite', 'surprising.The', 'artwork', 'set', 'episodes', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'recalling', 'original', 'manga', 'work', 'illustrators', 'deliberately', 'shifting', 'anime', 'style', 'something', 'more', 'painterly', 'when', 'moment', 'proper', 'music', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'grating', 'nervous', 'state', 'characters', 'move', 'places', 'final', 'drama.This', 'harsh', 'series', 'suiting', 'medieval', 'setting', 'individual', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'seek', 'can', 'deal', 'violence', 'prejudice', 'are', 'many', 'rewards', 'following', 'story', 'might', 'think', 'certainly', 'outstanding', 'example', 'kind']",N/A
727952,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00007G1TV,Michael Crane,"[1, 1]","The exciting series of &quot;Berserk&quot; never seems to lose its spark or appeal.  Just when you think that it can't possibly get any better, it does.  &quot;Berserk 5: Requited Desires&quot; is no exception as it successfully continues this ongoing action/fantasy epic of warriors and gods.  There are things that begin to move in motion that cannot be undone in these four revealing episodes.When an unsuccessful attempt to end Griffith's life by high-class people who despise him, an unstoppable chain-of-events is unleashed.  Staying until the perpetrators of the horrible act are severely punished, Guts decides it is his time to take leave and find out his true destiny and his purpose.  However, Griffith is none too pleased with the decision and is prepared to fight Guts for his freedom one last time, as it was years ago.  No matter what happens, Guts is determined to find out who he really is, even if it means fighting his long-time friend for his freedom.  Whatever the end result, things are set into motion that cannot be undone.This volume isn't filled with non-stop action like the past volumes, but the character development is what makes these episodes unique and intense.  These four episodes are crucial turning points for Guts, Caska, and Griffith.  It is clear that the last remaining episodes will lead into an uncertain darkness that could consume them all.  It's still not very clear of how things will end, but the foreshadowing of death and destruction is unquestionable.  Guts is a big part of these four episodes as he changes in a way he never thought possible; he finds what he cares about the most and discovers who he really is.I know I've stated this in the past reviews of the other volumes, but it must be stressed that this is no animated feature for children.  These episodes contain strong and brutal violence, extreme blood and gore, a scene of torture, nudity, mature situations, language, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  Extras included  are outtakes, trailers and a video interview with the producer of the series, Toshio Nakatani.&quot;Berserk 5: Requited Desires&quot; is a powerful chapter in this anime saga that continues to grow.  It's sad that the end is coming near to the series, but it's a journey that I look forward into taking.  With only a few more episodes to go, these 21 episodes have been exciting and thrilling.  &quot;Berserk&quot; is a fantastic saga that is about to be concluded with the final volume.",5,Finding One's True Path in Life...,1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,2484,"['exciting', 'series', 'quot', 'Berserk', 'quot', 'never', 'lose', 'spark', 'appeal', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'better', 'quot', '5', 'Requited', 'Desires', 'quot', 'exception', 'successfully', 'ongoing', 'action/fantasy', 'epic', 'warriors', 'gods', 'are', 'things', 'begin', 'move', 'motion', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'undone', 'four', 'revealing', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'end', 'Griffith', 'life', 'high-class', 'people', 'who', 'despise', 'unstoppable', 'chain-of-events', 'unleashed', 'Staying', 'perpetrators', 'horrible', 'act', 'are', 'severely', 'punished', 'Guts', 'time', 'take', 'leave', 'find', 'out', 'true', 'destiny', 'purpose', 'However', 'Griffith', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'decision', 'prepared', 'fight', 'Guts', 'freedom', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'years', 'ago', 'matter', 'what', 'Guts', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'even', 'fighting', 'long-time', 'friend', 'freedom', 'end', 'result', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'undone.This', 'volume', ""n't"", 'filled', 'non-stop', 'action', 'past', 'volumes', 'character', 'development', 'what', 'episodes', 'unique', 'intense', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'crucial', 'turning', 'points', 'Guts', 'Caska', 'Griffith', 'clear', 'last', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'will', 'lead', 'uncertain', 'darkness', 'could', 'consume', 'still', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'how', 'things', 'will', 'end', 'foreshadowing', 'death', 'destruction', 'unquestionable', 'Guts', 'big', 'part', 'four', 'episodes', 'way', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'what', 'most', 'discovers', 'who', 'really', 'is.I', 'know', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'past', 'reviews', 'other', 'volumes', 'must', 'be', 'stressed', 'animated', 'feature', 'children', 'episodes', 'contain', 'strong', 'brutal', 'violence', 'extreme', 'blood', 'gore', 'scene', 'torture', 'nudity', 'mature', 'situations', 'language', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'themes', 'imagery', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'outtakes', 'trailers', 'video', 'interview', 'producer', 'series', 'Toshio', 'Nakatani.', 'quot', '5', 'Requited', 'Desires', 'quot', 'powerful', 'chapter', 'anime', 'saga', 'grow', 'sad', 'end', 'coming', 'series', 'journey', 'look', 'forward', 'taking', 'only', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'go', '21', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'quot', 'Berserk', 'quot', 'fantastic', 'saga', 'be', 'concluded', 'final', 'volume']",N/A
727953,A1KX0865MSEMUG,B00007G1TV,Moshella,"[3, 3]","I was hooked to this show from the start, and I have to say, with each volume it only continues to amaze, intrigue, and just get better and better.Is this volume ever the emotional rollercoaster!  These characters we've come to know up until this point take some drastic turns (for the better and for the worse, depending on how you look at it, I suppose).  And this is precisely what makes ""Berserk"" a stand-out anime series.  The characters are multidimensional and realistic, and this show is not afraid to make you go from loving a character to hating one.In this volume, the structure has changed; Guts leaves the Band of the Hawk, only to return a year later and find that Griffith has been arrested for the rape of the Princess, and Casca has taken over leadership of the Band of the Hawk.  The Band's operative is to rescue Griffith, but there is the sense of some reservations on Guts's part.  Should this man, whose done so many terrible things to get where he is, really be rescued?  Was it entirely his fault?  And how could they possibly do it?If you've stuck with the series this far, this disc WILL NOT disappoint!

727955,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00007G1TV,Sebastian Fernandez,"[2, 2]","Throughout the last few episodes, Guts has been toying with the idea of leaving the Band of Hawks. It is amazing how well the creators have developed this character; from a kid that only wanted to fight, to a grown-up following somebody else's dream, to a disillusioned man that lost all desire, to a mature warrior that realizes he should follow his own path. Of course, this all leads to one conclusion, Guts has to abandon his friends and take command of his destiny.In the meantime, Griffith has learned how to play the politics and conspiracy games, and has outsmarted the queen and her partners in crime. Not only did Griffith prevent the queen's ploy to assassinate him, but he also devised a stratagem of his own to kill her and her cohorts when they were celebrating what they supposed was the success of their mission.Caska, the third main character in this series, is having trouble with her mixed feelings between Griffith and Guts. The love triangle that was suggested in the first episodes finally becomes a closer reality. Caska has been opening up to Guts lately, and now she has to face the fact that he is leaving them. What should she do? Follow the man who gave her hope at an early age, but now is wooing the princess, or follow her new glimpse at hope? Not only Caska is having trouble with Guts's decision, most of the members of the Band of the Hawks see this as something personal against them, instead of what it is, a quest for something more important.The tension and expectative are building rapidly and now that the end is near I wish that this series would last for a dozen more episodes, instead of just four.
