806964,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0001I55RO,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","A western comedy as well as a vehicle for actor, singer, songwriter Jim Dale, who plays three characters in this movie.  Fortunately, it's Don Knotts (as Sheriff Denver Kid) and Jack Elam as his arch nemesis, who easily steal the movie from Jim Dale (three characters notwithstanding).  Their many thwarted attempts at a showdown are both ludicrous and hilarious and serve as the best running gag in this feature.  Too bad their storyline wasn't the main event because the rest of the shenanigans were contrived to say the least, a string of gags and gimmicks that didn't really pay off in the end.  While this may have been a stunt man's dream, most of the time there was just utter chaos onscreen in the form of street brawls, an aborted lynching, multiple gunfights, pratfalls galore, and ""just another Indian sacrifice.""  Sadly, this left poor Karen Valentine on the fringe of the action, half the time forgotten, as was Darren McGavin who only appeared occasionally as the villain of the piece.  Most of the lazy plot was there primarily to showcase Dale talents as an old geezer (hidden under a ton of shoddy makeup), a ""sissy"" missionary, and a vicious gunslinger.  When he wasn't falling off roofs, getting blown up, or turning instantly drunk on cue, he was given to unconvincing theatrical histrionics.

I have really grown to appreciate the subtle brilliance masked in this straightforward family comedy.Amidst the silliness there is the pervasive sense of a real and powerful goodness, boarding in my opinion on the mystical. The songs, embarrassingly catchy, are simple and deceptively meaningful; despite their apparent triteness.Jim Dale is truly awesome in his ability to play three different characters so fully, each with visceral distinctness. His ""good"" character, Eli, is almost evocative of Dostoevsky's Alyosha from ""The Brothers Karamazov"" mixed with his protagonist from ""The Idiot,"" Prince Lyov Nikolayevich Myshkin.Each character of Dale's, as well as the rest of the cast, portray such a strong sense of universality that it almost borders on a meditation on Joseph Campbell's or Carl Jung's sense of the archetype. Frankly, I do not know how they did it, nor do I think it could ever be done again.If a person can peer beneath the Disney veneer I think they will find a truly triumphant story; of ignorance being transformed by innocence, love conquering violence, the inherent spirituality of the family, the self-imploding nature of evil, and the holy adventurousness of a childlike commitment to simple virtue.I wish I could do it more justice.",5,Understated Brilliance,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,1463,"['movie', 'actually', 'helped', 'shape', 'childhood', 'thus', 'adulthood', 'irreplaceable', 'longing', 'mix', 'innocence', 'purity', 'love', 'good', 'hope', 'transformation', 'lost', 'have', 'really', 'grown', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'masked', 'straightforward', 'family', 'silliness', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'real', 'powerful', 'goodness', 'boarding', 'opinion', 'mystical', 'songs', 'embarrassingly', 'catchy', 'are', 'simple', 'deceptively', 'meaningful', 'apparent', 'triteness.Jim', 'Dale', 'truly', 'awesome', 'ability', 'play', 'three', 'different', 'characters', 'so', 'fully', 'visceral', 'distinctness', 'good', 'character', 'Eli', 'almost', 'evocative', 'Dostoevsky', 'Alyosha', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'mixed', 'protagonist', 'Idiot', 'Prince', 'Lyov', 'Nikolayevich', 'Myshkin.Each', 'character', 'Dale', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'portray', 'strong', 'sense', 'universality', 'almost', 'borders', 'meditation', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'sense', 'archetype', 'Frankly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'did', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'done', 'person', 'can', 'peer', 'Disney', 'veneer', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'truly', 'triumphant', 'story', 'ignorance', 'being', 'transformed', 'innocence', 'love', 'conquering', 'violence', 'inherent', 'spirituality', 'family', 'self-imploding', 'nature', 'evil', 'holy', 'adventurousness', 'childlike', 'commitment', 'simple', 'virtue.I', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'justice']",N/A
806981,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0001I55RO,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[45, 46]","Pioneering old man Jasper Bloodshy presumably - strong emphasis on the word `presumably' - leaps off a cliff to his death.  His will is read and, to the surprise of all, it mentions a second son.  The old man's fortune will go to either gunslinging son Wild Billy or his Philadelphia sibling, `tambourine thumping' missionary Eli, depending on who wins a frontier version of an iron man race.HOT LEAD AND COLD FEET is a featherweight comedy/western produced by the Disney factory in 1978.  The three Bloodshys are all played by British actor Jim Dale.  Wild Billy is impossibly bad, Eli impossibly good, and old man Jasper takes an awful lot of pratfalls.  Come to think of it, everyone takes at least one pratfall here, but Jasper seems to do it most often and from higher places.  In any event, Eli (with two young orphaned children in tow, natch) travels west from Philly to the wild and rambunctious town of Bloodshy to compete in the race, become determined to clean up the town, and falls in love with the town's new school teacher, Karen Valentine.  The movie is a series of slapstick routines, with some serious, unstressed undertones - the kids want a father, Eli wants to bring civilization to a lawless town.  The slapstick and roughhousing is of the gentlest variety.  Every five feet or so there's either a fistfight or a rowdy firing off his six-shooter, but no blood is ever spilt, no bullets ever find flesh.  All things considered, this is about as gentle as they come.The supporting cast is pretty strong.  Although Don Knotts seems to be prominently featured in most of the posters and dvd jackets, his role is fairly small.  He's the nervous sheriff of Bloodshy, and his biggest scenes come when he squares off against Rattlesnake (Jack Elam).  They growl, grumble, and glare at each other, but something always seems to happen after they've separated themselves from each other by ten paces, counted to three and reached for their guns.  Why they want to blast each other to oblivion is never explained, but their scenes together are entertaining enough.HOT LEAD AND COLD FEET is about as family-friendly as they get.  Like most Disney movies of this type it'll be best appreciated by the pre-teens in the family, and adults who don't need to be challenged by a movie.  Teen-agers and young adults will probably find this one insufferably corny.
