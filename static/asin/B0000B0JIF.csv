769732,ABXORSEQ40D0T,B0000B0JIF,"BBD ""budbd""","[0, 2]","I just watched this movie, no, not on the individual dvd for sale, but a fairly decently viewable copy in the 50 movie set of ""Nightmare Worlds"", probably no better or worse than for sale individually.  I was impressed with the premise of time travel, and what they did with a likely low budget.  Wow, I was impressed with how they made those likely new cars look so grundged with dirt and dust, very impressive.  The story seemed passable for a sci fi movie, and the affects of someone disappearing were stunning for a movie I've never heard of before.  I'd bet this would have been a more popular movie with a different ending that wasn't an eco message aimed at our dependence on fossil fuels, and THAT must have been what ""catastrophe"" must have befell the human race by 56 years into the future according to the story.But grabbing other humans by the side of the road and throwing them into the trunk like space in the back of that vehicle, I am guessing for fuel(?), how stupid was that...., now that was likely demised this film as a regular re-run, the reason I have never seen it previously, and I am near my mid fourties in age.Anyway, I have just recently purchased nightmare worlds 50 movie collection, so I am sure anyone can still view a copy of it in there. Other than that, it was a pretty decent movie for a b movie, its too bad the ending was a eco joke, I mean I couldn't figure it out after watching the ending twice what just happened, and only had an assumption till I read others opinions here.  Thanks goodness the end was short in length, and ya know, I think a better ending would have been meet up with elderly former acquaintances who had found out from records that she reset herself to reappear in a certain time far ahead, and they were there to greet her, or she really did appear in time to stop the crazy girl from killing the other two, or at least the one she slept with, and he could have told her she really was able to get pregnant and probably was, and that they were not really all sterile like he was thinking.  Instead, she turned out to be a nifty trunk, errr, ""tank"", of gas.Endings to t.v. shows, even movies still haven't progressed all these years later, and they still fudge them up regularly, like sopranos, like lost, like the newer battlestar galactica where the survivors went back to nature and no technology koombya-ing with the cylons, among many that fudged the endings.  Hey, I know, how about in the future(not too distant future?), that when someone in the entertainment industry fudges the ending to a good show or movie, that they get thrown into a trunk as a good trunk of, errrr, ""tank"" of gas!  Now, THAT will end our dependence on foreign oil!",4,Good movie considering its time and motive,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2709,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'not', 'individual', 'dvd', 'sale', 'fairly', 'decently', 'viewable', 'copy', '50', 'movie', 'set', 'Nightmare', 'Worlds', 'probably', 'better', 'worse', 'sale', 'individually', 'was', 'impressed', 'premise', 'time', 'travel', 'what', 'did', 'likely', 'low', 'budget', 'Wow', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'made', 'likely', 'new', 'cars', 'look', 'so', 'grundged', 'dirt', 'dust', 'very', 'impressive', 'story', 'seemed', 'passable', 'sci', 'fi', 'movie', 'affects', 'someone', 'disappearing', 'were', 'stunning', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', ""'d"", 'bet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'popular', 'movie', 'different', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'eco', 'message', 'aimed', 'dependence', 'fossil', 'fuels', 'THAT', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'catastrophe', 'must', 'have', 'befell', 'human', 'race', '56', 'years', 'future', 'according', 'story.But', 'grabbing', 'other', 'humans', 'side', 'road', 'throwing', 'trunk', 'space', 'back', 'vehicle', 'am', 'guessing', 'fuel', 'how', 'stupid', 'was', 'now', 'was', 'likely', 'demised', 'film', 'regular', 're-run', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'previously', 'am', 'mid', 'fourties', 'age.Anyway', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 'purchased', 'nightmare', '50', 'movie', 'collection', 'am', 'sure', 'anyone', 'can', 'still', 'view', 'copy', 'there', 'Other', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'b', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'ending', 'was', 'eco', 'joke', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'watching', 'ending', 'twice', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'only', 'had', 'assumption', 'till', 'read', 'others', 'opinions', 'here', 'Thanks', 'goodness', 'end', 'was', 'short', 'length', 'ya', 'know', 'think', 'better', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'meet', 'up', 'elderly', 'former', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'had', 'found', 'out', 'records', 'reset', 'reappear', 'certain', 'time', 'far', 'ahead', 'were', 'there', 'greet', 'really', 'did', 'appear', 'time', 'stop', 'crazy', 'girl', 'killing', 'other', 'two', 'least', 'one', 'slept', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'pregnant', 'probably', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'sterile', 'was', 'thinking', 'Instead', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'nifty', 'trunk', 'errr', 'tank', 'gas.Endings', 't.v', 'shows', 'even', 'movies', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'progressed', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'fudge', 'up', 'regularly', 'sopranos', 'lost', 'newer', 'battlestar', 'galactica', 'where', 'survivors', 'went', 'back', 'nature', 'technology', 'koombya-ing', 'cylons', 'many', 'fudged', 'endings', 'Hey', 'know', 'how', 'about', 'future', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'when', 'someone', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'ending', 'good', 'show', 'movie', 'get', 'thrown', 'trunk', 'good', 'trunk', 'errrr', 'tank', 'gas', 'Now', 'THAT', 'will', 'end', 'dependence', 'foreign', 'oil']",Idaho Transfer

Houck,"[0, 0]","I saw part of this in the theater (the folks I rode with left early given their dim view of movies).And interesting story of the earth in trouble and time travel. Interesting if some what amaturish acting but still I love this poor move for some reason.A very early performance by Keith Carradine as Arthur. The film was produced by Peter Fonda's Pando Company in 1973.If a sci-fi dystopia fan  this one is for you ...Teenager Karen Braden (Kelley Bohanon) is a troubled mental hospital outpatient who is taken by her father George and sister Isa to a government facility near the Craters of the Moon lava fields in Idaho. The project there was commissioned to develop matter transference, but made a different discovery: time travel. They also discovered that a mysterious ecological catastrophe will soon wipe out civilization.The time travel process has negative health effects, though. Adults &#34;not much older than 20&#34; are unable to survive for long, as their kidneys hemorrhage shortly after the experience. So the scientists decide to only send young people 56 years into the future so they can build a new civilization.After the government takes over the project, the transfer machines are turned off, trapping a large number of project members in the future. Now trapped, they begin exploring the future world.",5,Interesting if thin movie,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1325,"['saw', 'part', 'theater', 'folks', 'rode', 'left', 'early', 'given', 'dim', 'view', 'movies', '.And', 'interesting', 'story', 'earth', 'trouble', 'time', 'travel', 'Interesting', 'what', 'amaturish', 'acting', 'still', 'love', 'poor', 'move', 'reason.A', 'very', 'early', 'performance', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Arthur', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Pando', 'Company', '1973.If', 'sci-fi', 'dystopia', 'fan', 'one', 'Teenager', 'Karen', 'Braden', 'Kelley', 'Bohanon', 'troubled', 'mental', 'hospital', 'outpatient', 'who', 'taken', 'father', 'George', 'sister', 'Isa', 'government', 'facility', 'Craters', 'Moon', 'lava', 'fields', 'Idaho', 'project', 'was', 'commissioned', 'develop', 'matter', 'transference', 'made', 'different', 'discovery', 'time', 'travel', 'also', 'discovered', 'mysterious', 'ecological', 'catastrophe', 'will', 'soon', 'wipe', 'out', 'civilization.The', 'time', 'travel', 'process', 'negative', 'health', 'effects', 'though', 'Adults', '34', 'not', 'much', 'older', '20', '34', 'are', 'unable', 'survive', 'long', 'kidneys', 'hemorrhage', 'shortly', 'experience', 'scientists', 'decide', 'only', 'send', 'young', 'people', '56', 'years', 'future', 'can', 'build', 'new', 'civilization.After', 'government', 'project', 'transfer', 'machines', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'trapping', 'large', 'number', 'project', 'members', 'future', 'Now', 'trapped', 'begin', 'exploring', 'future', 'world']",Idaho Transfer
769735,A1FV6SJ6Z27O1E,B0000B0JIF,"C. White ""Chazzz""","[2, 7]","This was a deeply disappointing video in so many ways!(1) Poor transfer quality - The DVD looks like a videotape.(2) Plot was disconnected and rambling with a complete plot failure at the ending.(3) No special effects budget and it shows!(4) The plot was full of holes.(5) Amateurish acting - Varying from wooden and stiff to over-emoting some of the scenes.I appreciated the obligatory panty shots of the starlets, but that's not enough to save this movie. The real shame was that some of the holes in the plot were so raw and gaping that I couldn't connect with the movie at all.Here are some of the most dreadful plot holes:(1) Why in the hell did they put the future transfer station in the middle of barren ancient lava fields in Idaho? If the whole point was to ""save the human race"" by sending some young people forward past the ""catastrophe"" why not locate the transfer station near a place with water and soil instead of rocks. They don't even pretend the future transfer station is located at the same geographic place as the lab - So that's not the reason or the limitation.(2) I can accept the dark irony of these young people being sterilized by the transfer so they cannot ""save the human race"". The whole premise of the movie is some near future cataclysm wiped out most people (apparently turned them to dust?) and left the survivors severely mentally retarded. And these young people are supposed to repopulate the earth. But couldn't the writer come up with some explanation of what that catastrophe was? - It's just the central premise of the movie!(3) The ending just plain blew chunks! What was the writer or director trying to convey in the final scene? Are they trying to say that the survivors in the farther future are picking up people who just happen to wander by and are using them for fuel for their car? Give me a break - The matrix this is not! This future family out for a drive didn't hunt or lay a trap. They just picked up a gal that dragged herself near the road and couldn't go on. Yeah, you can count on that happening every day or two - NOT!(4) The tagline on the case ""Can the ideals of the past save the future?"" Is some publicist's wet dream? It doesn't match the movie at all! Which ""Ideals of the past"" are we talking about - Is it the gal who goes nuts and kills her companions when she stays at the future transfer station? Is it the bitchey gal who refuses to read her dad's letters from the past to find out what happened? Is it the traveling hippy pair we see early in the movie? - Say, maybe the idiot children are theirs?By the way, for some reason the female characters all seemed to favor each other to the point I had some trouble telling the characters apart. I'm guessing Mr. Peter Fonda liked girls that looked that way. Couldn't we have had a little variety?

Since I remember the energy crisis back in the '70s, when this film was done, I picked up on a number of cultural references of the time. Not to mention we again have the same sort of problems going on today with high fuel costs.And since I'm an English major, this allowed me to dissect the story line and pick on several references that explain the end.  The frightening final use for the transfer system for instance.  The people found in the rail cars and the deaf girl the group found, are all clues to the final scene.What I did find annoying was no clear reference to what happened to create such a world nor the fate of what happened to the rest of the group heading for the coast.Finally, the film was an interesting experiment and could be used as an exercise in story telling for classes.

769737,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B0000B0JIF,Gary,"[19, 22]","The 1 star is for the DVD which is appalling. It appears little more than video quality transposed to DVD which defeats the point. Surely someone can find the negative or a 35 or 16m print somewhere?The film itself is of it's time, but probably brilliant. It's environmental warning is as pertinent as ever and it shows that there was plenty of early scepticism amongst the forever young/free love generation. The film is populated by barely clothed, nubile, erotic dollybirds (Isa's protruding tongue and peeling of a banana got me all of a quiver) and strapping young men. I thought there might be some other agenda behind the hiring of these unknowns but it's right for the story. The young scientists are emotionally immature and easily distracted (Karen with her ring) and their free love idealism soon receives a painful rebuke. Their lack of foresight over the possibilities of lingering contamination, especially in the light of their 'discovery', is puzzling. Idaho Transfer is a strangely serene and relaxing experience, a spell that even the introduction of aggression and inevitable tragedy cannot dissipate. It's disturbing ending, described in a review I read as 'ridiculous', is actually to my liking, brilliantly banal in the way life tends to be. The pessimistic metaphor is the skimming rock earlier in the film. We can only go so far in the natural order is the message.

Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks, but I had to this time cause this one pissed me off so. I've seen many B-movie Sci-fi's but this one takes the cake. Of all the movies waiting to be transfered to DVD what Exec. Booted this one into production? Must be another groopie friend of Peter Fonda. I thought with Fonda's name attached to it, it couldn't be half bad.

Only people under 20 can time travel as it is fatal to older people. (Did Peter Fonda direct this or what?) In order to transfer all metal must be removed from the body which means the girls are in their panties half the time. In the future they discover that there are no people, apparently wiped out by some ""eco"" disaster.Much of the film centers around the moody Karen (Kelly Bohanon) a late comer to the group of hippie scientists. She nonchalantly describes losing her virginity as being raped by a fellow researcher, perhaps meant to be an insight into her character.The special effects are minimal. Time travel is accomplished through a controller that looks like a stereo receiver. The dialouge was cardboard as were the stock hippie characters. The surprise ending has that ""A Boy and His Dog"" feel to it, but the road getting there is laced with boredom, mediocre acting and directing, as well as death by editing.Parental Guide: No f-bombs or sex.
