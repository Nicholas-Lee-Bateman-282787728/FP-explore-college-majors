Also strange were the &#34;extras&#34; who appeared so unaffected by what had so recently happened to them. And, no flags anywhere? The producers must've looked far and wide to find a place, anywhere in the city, where there weren't any.",3,Just okay,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,665,"['Even', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'awkward', 'inject', '9/11', 'first', 'episode', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'aired', 'sometime', 'late', 'October', 'early', 'November', 'almost', 'two', 'months', 'tragic', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'were', 'already', 'completed', 'season', 'premiere', 'still', 'seemed', 'rather', 'strange', 'see', 'show', 'took', 'place', 'midst', 'city', 'most', 'directly', 'affected', 'event', 'Also', 'strange', 'were', '34', '34', 'who', 'appeared', 'so', 'unaffected', 'what', 'had', 'so', 'recently', 'happened', 'flags', 'anywhere', 'producers', 'must', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'far', 'wide', 'find', 'place', 'anywhere', 'city', 'where', 'were', ""n't""]",N/A

Another good show from J.J. Abrams (along with Matt Reeves). The show was so convincing that it was hard to watch Keri Russell (Felicity) in a complete turn-around role, years later, as the cold-blooded Elizabeth Jennings in The Americans. Goes to show how talented and versatile an actor she is. Good ensemble cast with the cast chemistry needed to make any show work. This one worked. Well.",5,Found this show,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,597,"['bumped', 'show', 'many', 'years', 'went', 'air', 'reason', 'grabbed', 'me.A', 'good', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'nice', 'continuity', 'plot', 'four', 'years', 'college', 'same', 'cast', 'brings', 'good', 'show', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Felicity', 'complete', 'turn-around', 'role', 'years', 'later', 'cold-blooded', 'Elizabeth', 'Jennings', 'Americans', 'Goes', 'show', 'how', 'talented', 'actor', 'Good', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'needed', 'make', 'show', 'work', 'one', 'worked', 'Well']",N/A

It follows a young woman named Felicity as she goes journey's through the next chapter of her life which is adulthood and college. As we know life is full of ups and downs and winding roads, Felicity's experience was no different however, she met people on campus who became her second family and they tried their best to help each other navigate life.It's a series about enduring change, finding your way and friendship. Though it was a drama series it was very calm and very balanced, it dealt with serious and realistic issues and it also had some hollywood made up issues that would not have happened at least not in those days.  It was a great show that will be missed by those of us who grew up watching it. Hopefully those of you who are new to this series will love it just as much as the original fans.",5,Great Show,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,955,"['Felicity', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'starred', 'Kerri', 'Russell', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'teen', 'stars', 'day', 'why', 'watched', 'first', 'place', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Felicity', 'journey', 'next', 'chapter', 'life', 'adulthood', 'college', 'know', 'life', 'full', 'ups', 'downs', 'winding', 'roads', 'Felicity', 'experience', 'was', 'different', 'however', 'met', 'people', 'campus', 'who', 'became', 'second', 'family', 'tried', 'best', 'help', 'other', 'navigate', 'life.It', 'series', 'enduring', 'change', 'finding', 'way', 'friendship', 'was', 'drama', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'calm', 'very', 'balanced', 'serious', 'realistic', 'issues', 'also', 'had', 'hollywood', 'made', 'up', 'issues', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'least', 'not', 'days', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Hopefully', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'fans']",N/A
