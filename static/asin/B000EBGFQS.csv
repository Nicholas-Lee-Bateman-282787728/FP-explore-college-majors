It's a basic story showing the perspective of soldiers from the German, Italian, and American Army. If you are a serious WW2 buff, its worth the purchase. The uniforms were spot on and I even recognized some of the German actors from German made WW films. I have a huge DVD war library and being also a U.S. Army veteran, the basics of the movie such as uniforms, equipment etc has to be genuine.

After 50 minutes or so, I had to turn it off.  The music was out of place and corny.  The acting was sub par.  Was there a plot?  If so, it wasn't evident.  Very disappointing.  I kept waiting for something more, but it never came (and I didn't want to waste any more of my time).  Is it a comedy?  Is it a parody?  It's hard to take this movie seriously.Before renting, be sure to watch the trailer(s).  To search for the trailer, look for ""the fallen 2004 trailer"".

971594,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,B000EBGFQS,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[16, 16]","the Fallen is a film I never thought could be made, a WW 2 independent film.  A small budget period war movie?  Exactly, but this one had high hopes and was very ambitious without trying to be an action driven film. The problems with this film wasn't the production or the look of the film.  The Idea was pretty cool, a story told from three different perspectives.  One told from the Germans, one told from the American side and one told from the Italian side, and you can add another side which was the Italians that fought on the side of the Germans.I liked the concept and how the actors spoke in their native tongue.  All these things would have worked better if the characters were a bit more fleshed out.  In any war film you know someone is going to get shot, blown up before it's all said and done.  When you don't really care or feel connected to any of the characters than your really not going to get the full war movie experience.  The story was paced slow with brief moments of action which I'm sure had to do with the small budget.  With a war film you really want it hardcore, gritty, and real; this one was none of the above. Nothing real resonated in this film and you knew you were watching a film and actors the entire time.There were some nice shots and directing, the uniforms and setting was spot on for the Italian countryside and everything looked like it came from that era.  The film makers did a wonderful job in that aspect.  The movie was trying to say something and give all the sides but didn't focus enough on the real meat of any of these stories for me to get emotional invested in this film.  It's a nice film for a small independent feature and did well at some film festivals.  Looking at this on a broader scale it just won't hold up to many, many other well made war films.  I salute the director for his ambitious attempt at something different, i wish i would have like it more.",3,Very ambtious indy film,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,1920,"['Fallen', 'film', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'WW', '2', 'independent', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'period', 'war', 'movie', 'Exactly', 'one', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'very', 'ambitious', 'trying', 'be', 'action', 'driven', 'film', 'problems', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'production', 'look', 'film', 'Idea', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'story', 'told', 'three', 'different', 'perspectives', 'One', 'told', 'Germans', 'one', 'told', 'American', 'side', 'one', 'told', 'Italian', 'side', 'can', 'add', 'side', 'was', 'Italians', 'fought', 'side', 'Germans.I', 'liked', 'concept', 'how', 'actors', 'spoke', 'native', 'tongue', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'war', 'film', 'know', 'someone', 'going', 'get', 'shot', 'blown', 'up', 'said', 'done', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'feel', 'connected', 'characters', 'really', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'full', 'war', 'movie', 'experience', 'story', 'was', 'paced', 'slow', 'brief', 'moments', 'action', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'do', 'small', 'budget', 'war', 'film', 'really', 'want', 'hardcore', 'gritty', 'real', 'one', 'was', 'none', 'above', 'Nothing', 'real', 'resonated', 'film', 'knew', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'actors', 'entire', 'time.There', 'were', 'nice', 'shots', 'directing', 'uniforms', 'setting', 'was', 'spot', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'everything', 'looked', 'came', 'era', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'give', 'sides', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'enough', 'real', 'meat', 'stories', 'get', 'emotional', 'invested', 'film', 'nice', 'film', 'small', 'independent', 'feature', 'did', 'well', 'film', 'festivals', 'Looking', 'broader', 'scale', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'well', 'made', 'war', 'films', 'salute', 'director', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'something', 'different', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'more']",The Fallen

Looking at their other reviews, it looks like many of them are younger guys who ususally buy sci-fi flicks or electronics.  If you're into stuff like Halo 3, I can see where you might find this movie boring.I'm a WWII reenactor and collector of military vehicles.  I have relatives who were in the Luftwaffe during the war, so the era of the Third Reich has always been a big field of study for me.  I've collected militaria, primarily WWII uniforms and weapons, for thirty-five years, so that's who I am.  Now, on to the movie.Yes, this is a low budget movie and it reflects that.  The story line could definitely have been better, the soundtrack could have been MUCH better, and the special effects are not overly impressive - as one person stated, the small charges they used to simulate bullet hits are downright explosive!  However, if you go into this movie realizing it's a low budget ITALIAN movie (it definitely has a foreign flavor) AND you are a serious WWII movie guy, then this movie's worth the buy.  Here's why.To me, it was worth the purchase price just to see an unusual topic approached with a good deal of historical accuracy.  The actions may not be 100% correct throughout, but the equipment, uniforms, and vehicles are very nice.  Here's some interesting stuff I liked: the main Feldwebel has a unique jacket made of zeltbahn material, the Italian uniforms and field gear are spot-on perfect, the mixture of German uniforms is great, the Americans are wearing a mix of M43 and M41 jackets, some have leggings, some have double buckle boots - all very typical of late 1944 northern Italy.  There's a lot of nice weapondry - a scoped G43 rifle, Carcano carbines, an MG42, an MG34, MP40s, a working MP44, Thompsons, BARs, Garands, Mausers, M1 carbines, double barrel shotguns (partisans) and even a water cooled Browning .30.  The military vehicles are a bit too clean, but I suspect these are owned by European reenactors and they just didn't want to get them too messy.  On the plus side, there's some decent footage of a replica German 8-wheeled recon panzer, which is something I've not seen in any other flick.To sum it up, yes, it could've been better.  But, it's not a bad little movie.  For the money, I would seriously recommend this one if you're interested in the war in Europe.",3,"It's not that bad.
