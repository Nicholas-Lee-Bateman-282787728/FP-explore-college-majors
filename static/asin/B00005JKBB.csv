584340,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00005JKBB,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 1]","""It's Muir's last day before retiring (clich&eacute; alert!)"" says Amazon review. Lol. That is true. Why they gotta do that? SPY GAME is a good movie though. It's got good acting, was directed well, tells a good story and I always appreciate seeing lots of Europe in a movie. It doesn't paint dark enough a picture of the CIA, an organization that has done enough harm in the world that socially responsible filmmakers should never miss the opportunity to really let those creeps have it, imo. But of course sending a message is not even close to being the whole point of telling a story or making a movie. I'd say, just don't make 'em look good. And SPY GAME does sort of come close, what with none other than Brad Pitt and Robert Redford together on screen. Two of Hollywood's best looking and most charismatic actors. They're cool together. Basically as a young soldier Pitt is recruited by Redford to the Company. They do some work over the years (the hot spots: eastern europe, the middle east)and eventually Pitt becomes disillusioned with spy games and all the shenanigans and murder. Pitt falls in love with a woman. Pitt and Redford go their seperate ways, but before they do Redford has made clear his belief that one should  never stick their neck out. Pitt then gets caught by Chinese authorities trying to save his woman. I'll leave the rest for you to enjoy.

The plot is improbable, the dialogue a little overdetermined, many of the characters [typical].  Yet, despite its faults, I find it to be quite a bit better than the average spy flick.  The set-up in itself is interesting: Robert Redford's character becomes something of a spy within the CIA; the line between good guy and bad guy is not so easily drawn here.  The script is merely serviceable, but the film creates an adrenaline-soaked atmosphere through its jumpy camera-work and unexpected ... twists.  Unlike most action movies, it gives you something to think about, a ... situation to consider and question.  Plus, how many big Hollywood flicks have a juicy, sly Charlotte Rampling cameo?

584343,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKBB,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I must admit, Tony Scott is one of the greatest action directors the film world has to offer.  He not only has the ability to push his actors, but also create these amazing visuals that transport us deep into the setting of the film.  He has mastered the cinematography of nearly every picture he has done, giving us these beautiful shots of the world that we may never see in our lifetime.  Several of his films enhance my DVD collection like Crimson Tide and True Romance, but sadly Spy Game will not.  While Scott does wonders with the actors, scenes, and camera angles, it is the story that is ultimately flaws this film.  The lack of coherence, consistency, and structure take this Tony Scott film and transform it into just your average Hollywood spy film.  It had the potential to reach new levels, and there were several scenes that I loved, but I just couldn't believe the story.  Let me explain.My biggest issue with this film was the lack of aging from our two main characters.  This film spans a timeframe of about sixteen years, and throughout the course of that time neither Pitt nor Redford age.  Director Scott chose not to use CGI or younger actors for the parts when they were in Vietnam, so as the time progressed in the film, our main actors did not.  This was a huge hurdle to overcome since I wanted to enjoy this film.  I did not see the mission where the discovered the fountain of youth, so I can only assume that this was some bad judgment on Scott's part.  Redford and Pitt should have aged more than what they did in this film allowing us to see the emotion and sheer force behind their eyes.Outside of this point it was your average Hollywood action film.  Large explosions and violence countered with a sneaky Sneakers-esque style subplot overshadowed the plot.  Pitt was nothing more than the muscle of the operation, and Scott gave us nothing to build more upon his character.  I fault the writer of this film.  I believe that the homework was done correctly, just not structured correctly.  Perhaps it was just me, but I had trouble following some of the missions.  I realize they were necessary, and possibly not rocket science, but the scene with Charlotte Rampling made no sense.  Maybe I missed a part that was crucial in some way, but overall it just seemed like there was more jumping and fighting than actual plot.  I felt as if the love interest was randomly placed through the film.  I realize that Pitt was not one to follow simple commands, but I felt early on in this film that he would have the ability to walk away from a woman if needed.  Spy Game suddenly went from smart espionage film to ""master has to fix newbie's mistake"".  This felt strange to me because throughout the film Redford continued to speak about having the upper hand, and not straying from the point.  Yet, when Redford was faced to save his friend, he did just that.  Was he learning from his pupil?  If so, it was not very well spelled out and a very weak point.Outside of the story, director Tony Scott gives yet another beautiful film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  I loved the way that he kept us, the audience, in suspense as to what time it was and how much time they had to save Pitt's character.  The black and white flashes followed by the time were inventive and it seemed to work.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  Scott controlled this film and it was a pleasure to see that.  There is no doubt in my mind that he is the master of the action genre and that more scripts should be coming his way.  I hope they are more inventive than this outing and have at least a bit more meat on their bones.Overall, I thought this was an average film.  I am disappointed because there are better than average films that Tony Scott has released, I am ashamed to ask why this film was not one of them.  Pitt was solely used for the purpose of his strength (and to capture the attention of a younger female audience) while Redford was used mainly for his dashing good looks (and to capture the attention of the older female audience).  Once you realize this point than this film will fall into place.  I don't think it deserves more than one viewing, but the cinematography alone was powerful enough to watch once.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Hell of an ad for the Boy Scouts.,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,4262,"['must', 'admit', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'one', 'greatest', 'action', 'directors', 'film', 'world', 'offer', 'not', 'only', 'ability', 'push', 'actors', 'also', 'create', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'transport', 'deep', 'setting', 'film', 'mastered', 'cinematography', 'nearly', 'picture', 'done', 'giving', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'world', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'lifetime', 'Several', 'films', 'enhance', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'True', 'Romance', 'sadly', 'Spy', 'Game', 'will', 'not', 'Scott', 'wonders', 'actors', 'scenes', 'camera', 'angles', 'story', 'ultimately', 'flaws', 'film', 'lack', 'coherence', 'consistency', 'structure', 'take', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'film', 'transform', 'just', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'spy', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'reach', 'new', 'levels', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'loved', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'story', 'Let', 'explain.My', 'biggest', 'issue', 'film', 'was', 'lack', 'aging', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'timeframe', 'sixteen', 'years', 'course', 'time', 'Pitt', 'Redford', 'age', 'Director', 'Scott', 'chose', 'not', 'use', 'CGI', 'younger', 'actors', 'parts', 'when', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'so', 'time', 'progressed', 'film', 'main', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'huge', 'hurdle', 'overcome', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'mission', 'where', 'discovered', 'fountain', 'youth', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'bad', 'judgment', 'Scott', 'part', 'Redford', 'Pitt', 'should', 'have', 'aged', 'more', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'allowing', 'see', 'emotion', 'sheer', 'force', 'eyes.Outside', 'point', 'was', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'film', 'Large', 'explosions', 'violence', 'countered', 'sneaky', 'Sneakers-esque', 'style', 'subplot', 'overshadowed', 'plot', 'Pitt', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'muscle', 'operation', 'Scott', 'gave', 'nothing', 'build', 'more', 'character', 'fault', 'writer', 'film', 'believe', 'homework', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'just', 'not', 'structured', 'correctly', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'missions', 'realize', 'were', 'necessary', 'possibly', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'scene', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'made', 'sense', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'part', 'was', 'crucial', 'way', 'overall', 'just', 'seemed', 'was', 'more', 'jumping', 'fighting', 'actual', 'plot', 'felt', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'randomly', 'placed', 'film', 'realize', 'Pitt', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'follow', 'simple', 'commands', 'felt', 'early', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'ability', 'walk', 'away', 'woman', 'needed', 'Spy', 'Game', 'suddenly', 'went', 'smart', 'espionage', 'film', 'master', 'fix', 'newbie', 'mistake', 'felt', 'strange', 'film', 'Redford', 'continued', 'speak', 'having', 'upper', 'hand', 'not', 'straying', 'point', 'when', 'Redford', 'was', 'faced', 'save', 'friend', 'did', 'just', 'Was', 'learning', 'pupil', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'spelled', 'out', 'very', 'weak', 'point.Outside', 'story', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'film', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'loved', 'way', 'kept', 'audience', 'suspense', 'what', 'time', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'had', 'save', 'Pitt', 'character', 'black', 'white', 'flashes', 'followed', 'time', 'were', 'inventive', 'seemed', 'work', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'Scott', 'controlled', 'film', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'doubt', 'mind', 'master', 'action', 'genre', 'more', 'scripts', 'should', 'be', 'coming', 'way', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'inventive', 'outing', 'have', 'least', 'bit', 'more', 'meat', 'bones.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'average', 'film', 'am', 'disappointed', 'are', 'better', 'average', 'films', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'released', 'am', 'ashamed', 'ask', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Pitt', 'was', 'solely', 'used', 'purpose', 'strength', 'capture', 'attention', 'younger', 'female', 'audience', 'Redford', 'was', 'used', 'mainly', 'dashing', 'good', 'looks', 'capture', 'attention', 'older', 'female', 'audience', 'realize', 'point', 'film', 'will', 'fall', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'watch', 'once.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

584351,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00005JKBB,audrey,"[1, 1]","Spy Game is a good-looking movie, in the sense that the settings are interesting and that it's fun to watch Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  naturally, the film works best when Muir (Redford) and Bishop (Pitt) are in the same scenes, as when Muir indoctrinates Bishop into the world of a CIA operative or later during their falling out when Muir thinks Bishop has compromised his position by falling in love with an unsuitable woman.  Unfortunately, the film didn't make the case for love and the character of the woman is extremely underwritten.  Also, Redford tells a lot of the story in flashbacks as he's sitting in a conference room with his sinister CIA bosses, but I thought this muddied the drama and confused the action without adding much.Two commentary tracks are available with the dvd -- one by the director and one by the producers.  Reading between the lines of various comments, it seems obvious they had two high maintenance actors on their hands!  ('Brad wanted to reshoot this scene,'  'Robert wanted to do this.' etc etc)  Must have been a lot of fun!  Still, these are two charismatic actors and it's fun to watch them work.  (Do you suppose Pitt had something to say about the slo-mo shots of him framing the pivotal scene of carnage and destruction?  -- 'Yes, people are hurt and there are explosions, but let's slow it down here so we can see that Brad is really emotionally distraught -- and his hair is blowing so nicely in the wind!')Extra features also include icons that appear and allow you to access trivia or comments while the film plays; a trailer; a list of CIA requirements; a three minute script-to-storyboard featurette; 5 deleted scenes; and 4 alternate scenes, including an alternate ending.  These are fun to watch, but also should act as a warning that there was not a coherent vision of how this film should play out.  In addition, all three commentators spend a fair bit of time explaining the plot -- not a good sign either!  Though I have to say that I enjoyed the film more after listening to the commentary tracks, ultimately it was not worth the effort.

584353,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKBB,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[10, 11]","I recently viewed the new Robert Redford movie ""Spy Game"", and really enjoyed the experience. As someone who worked within the federal bureaucracy for decades, I can readily verify that those aspects depicting the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency are certainly accurate and on point in this new film with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  Pitt plays an agent who possibly has gone rogue, and who has been taken prisoner by the Chinese. Redford plays his former handler, now re-engaged to decipher Pitt's action on the day of his own retirement, who smells something foul in the skunk works at the last moment of his own incumbency, and starts playing double-dare internal spy games with other CIA officers within the facility who seem to have some hidden ulterior motive for wanting to throw Pitt's character to the wolves.Of course, one does well to recognize Redford's masterful hand in all this activity, since he has a well-earned reputation for questioning the nature of our intelligence agencies, their inbred culture of gamesmanship, and the way they work. Like spy thriller author John LeCarre (The Constant Gardener), Redford seems most interested in exploring the darker side of the so-called invisible government and its corrosive effect on the character of the men who populate it, and in the first hour or so, the film builds the tension between someone who wants to do right thing by an agent in the field and an agency looking to protect its own political agendas. As a result, Redford starts going out onto that precarious limb he had long ago advised Pitt never to venture onto, and learns some things about himself in the process.The truth is revealed in layers of deceit and games, and one has to keep his wits about him in understanding why Redford takes some of the actions he does and what the agency is doing in the meantime. Yet at the conclusion all is clear, and the standoff ends with Redford driving his older Porsche off into the sunset of his own career and a much different future than he had imagined just a day or so before. Pitt plays his own part quite well as an iconoclastic recruit who learns enough about himself and the spy-game to understand there has to be a better and more purposeful way to live. This for me is the real strength of the movie, and the understated message Redford wants us to get; Our intelligence agencies work in service to goals often so twisted and altered from their original purpose as to be preposterous monsters, yet such conduct is all too common within the framework of how they operate. This is a cautionary tale told with purpose; to convince us the game is out of control.",4,Intriguing Look At The CIA!,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2659,"['recently', 'viewed', 'new', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'movie', 'Spy', 'Game', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'federal', 'bureaucracy', 'decades', 'can', 'readily', 'verify', 'aspects', 'depicting', 'inner', 'workings', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'are', 'certainly', 'accurate', 'point', 'new', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Pitt', 'agent', 'who', 'possibly', 'gone', 'rogue', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Chinese', 'Redford', 'former', 'handler', 'now', 're-engaged', 'decipher', 'Pitt', 'action', 'day', 'own', 'retirement', 'who', 'something', 'foul', 'skunk', 'last', 'moment', 'own', 'incumbency', 'playing', 'double-dare', 'internal', 'spy', 'games', 'other', 'CIA', 'officers', 'facility', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'hidden', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'wanting', 'throw', 'Pitt', 'character', 'wolves.Of', 'course', 'one', 'well', 'recognize', 'Redford', 'masterful', 'hand', 'activity', 'well-earned', 'reputation', 'questioning', 'nature', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'inbred', 'culture', 'gamesmanship', 'way', 'work', 'spy', 'thriller', 'author', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'Redford', 'most', 'interested', 'exploring', 'darker', 'side', 'so-called', 'invisible', 'government', 'corrosive', 'effect', 'character', 'men', 'who', 'populate', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'tension', 'someone', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'agent', 'field', 'agency', 'looking', 'protect', 'own', 'political', 'agendas', 'result', 'Redford', 'going', 'out', 'precarious', 'limb', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'advised', 'Pitt', 'never', 'venture', 'things', 'process.The', 'truth', 'revealed', 'layers', 'deceit', 'games', 'one', 'keep', 'wits', 'understanding', 'why', 'Redford', 'actions', 'what', 'agency', 'doing', 'meantime', 'conclusion', 'clear', 'standoff', 'Redford', 'driving', 'older', 'Porsche', 'sunset', 'own', 'career', 'much', 'different', 'future', 'had', 'imagined', 'just', 'day', 'so', 'before', 'Pitt', 'own', 'part', 'quite', 'well', 'iconoclastic', 'recruit', 'who', 'enough', 'spy-game', 'understand', 'there', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'purposeful', 'way', 'live', 'real', 'strength', 'movie', 'understated', 'message', 'Redford', 'get', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'work', 'service', 'goals', 'often', 'so', 'twisted', 'altered', 'original', 'purpose', 'be', 'preposterous', 'monsters', 'yet', 'such', 'conduct', 'too', 'common', 'framework', 'how', 'operate', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'told', 'purpose', 'convince', 'game', 'control']",N/A

Browne ""cbbrowne""","[1, 1]","It's Nathan Muir's (Redford) last day at the CIA, and his former protege, Tom Bishop (Pitt), has gotten himself caught by the Chinese trying to break someone out of prison.So begins this interesting movie that goes through the history of Muir teaching Bishop the ""rules"" of how to live through a career running operations at the CIA.Unlike the typical ""spy flick,"" this one doesn't involve Muir fighting off a succession of sexy chicks in order to triumph over some chortling villain.  He never leaves the office until the very end.It is entirely entertaining to watch Muir explain his ""rules,"" only to, on his last day, break them, one by one.Even more entertaining, in a rewatch, is to try to figure out just how many times he speaks bald-faced lies, and, better still, how often the people lied to choose to accept the lies, even when they know better.  There are numerous occasions where his rescue attempt could have unravelled if someone found it in their interests to poke holes in his lies.It's a bit of a period piece; Muir is one of the bloody-handed ""operational guys"" from the days when the CIA was pretty clear about their need to act on the world stage.  His successors are nowhere near as clearly bloody-minded, as the CIA has since moved  into more of an ""analytical"" model.  Of course, a Bishop, dead in a Chinese prison, is as dead whichever group leaves him to die...Also interesting is that Muir presents a pretty strong apologia for doing bloody deeds.  His character believes that, nasty or not, they are doing needful things.  It is by no means clear that the successors have any better ethics than he had.The stories about ex-wives keep popping out of the woodwork, supplying considerable humorous material.  The REAL story emerges only at the very end, leaving no time to reflect on Muir's REAL character.  He behaves throughout as one who well deserves to have wives leaving him, in droves.  Reality is that all anyone sees, most of the time, is the facade that Muir wanted them to see, and it's worth reflecting on how different his internal reality is from the impressions you start with.At the end, the story is a pack of lies, with a few flashes, here and there, of Muir's REAL character.  In a sense, he is a failure, since he only rarely gets to express his real beliefs.  This is a little like the ""About Schmidt"" character, who, after years of hiding his true desires, completely fails to express the things he believes truly important.But unlike Schmidt, Muir does have enough courage to act on his convictions to actually make some difference.",4,Actually something of a spy story,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,2579,"['Nathan', 'Muir', 'Redford', 'last', 'day', 'CIA', 'former', 'protege', 'Tom', 'Bishop', 'Pitt', 'gotten', 'caught', 'Chinese', 'trying', 'break', 'someone', 'prison.So', 'interesting', 'movie', 'history', 'Muir', 'teaching', 'Bishop', 'rules', 'how', 'live', 'career', 'running', 'operations', 'CIA.Unlike', 'typical', 'spy', 'flick', 'one', ""n't"", 'involve', 'Muir', 'fighting', 'off', 'succession', 'sexy', 'chicks', 'order', 'triumph', 'chortling', 'villain', 'never', 'office', 'very', 'end.It', 'entirely', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Muir', 'explain', 'rules', 'only', 'last', 'day', 'break', 'one', 'one.Even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'rewatch', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'bald-faced', 'lies', 'better', 'still', 'how', 'often', 'people', 'lied', 'choose', 'accept', 'lies', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'better', 'are', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'where', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'could', 'have', 'unravelled', 'someone', 'found', 'interests', 'poke', 'holes', 'lies.It', 'bit', 'period', 'piece', 'Muir', 'one', 'bloody-handed', 'operational', 'guys', 'days', 'when', 'CIA', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'need', 'act', 'world', 'stage', 'successors', 'are', 'nowhere', 'clearly', 'bloody-minded', 'CIA', 'moved', 'more', 'analytical', 'model', 'course', 'Bishop', 'dead', 'Chinese', 'prison', 'dead', 'whichever', 'group', 'die', 'Also', 'interesting', 'Muir', 'pretty', 'strong', 'apologia', 'doing', 'bloody', 'deeds', 'character', 'not', 'are', 'doing', 'needful', 'things', 'means', 'clear', 'successors', 'have', 'better', 'ethics', 'had.The', 'stories', 'ex-wives', 'keep', 'popping', 'woodwork', 'supplying', 'considerable', 'humorous', 'material', 'REAL', 'story', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'leaving', 'time', 'reflect', 'Muir', 'REAL', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'deserves', 'have', 'wives', 'leaving', 'droves', 'Reality', 'anyone', 'most', 'time', 'facade', 'Muir', 'wanted', 'see', 'worth', 'reflecting', 'how', 'different', 'internal', 'reality', 'impressions', 'start', 'with.At', 'end', 'story', 'pack', 'lies', 'few', 'flashes', 'here', 'there', 'Muir', 'REAL', 'character', 'sense', 'failure', 'only', 'rarely', 'express', 'real', 'beliefs', 'little', 'Schmidt', 'character', 'who', 'years', 'hiding', 'true', 'desires', 'completely', 'express', 'things', 'truly', 'important.But', 'Schmidt', 'Muir', 'have', 'enough', 'courage', 'act', 'convictions', 'actually', 'make', 'difference']",N/A

Seems Pitt has gotten into some trouble with the Chinese government, and now the CIA is trying to justify their actions in not trying to rescue Bishop by picking Muirs' brain, looking for anything they can use against Bishop.  Muir, who recruited and trained Bishop, recounts missions with Bishop, while working surreptitiously against the agency for a more favorable outcome to the situation.The movie, which takes place in 1991, goes through a number of flashbacks, starting from 1975 Vietnam, to the 80's in Beirut, to the present, 1991, equalling a span of 16 years.

I had a hard time placing Brad Pitt in Vietnam, but whatever.  Once you accept this, and focus on the story, it becomes more enjoyable.  The development of the friendship between Bishop and Muir seems a little on the light side, especially based on the importance this relationship plays at the end of the movie.  Also, some of the more techno music seemed out of place, or maybe it was the frequency in which it was used, and I have heard some people say that this movie needed more action, but I would disagree.  I found the inner workings of the CIA to be fascinating, especially when Muir was going behind his peer's backs to get the information he needed.  It was really interesting to see him use little tricks of the trade and such to maneuver around, between, over, and under his peers and always stay two steps ahead.  And Redford played this aspect of his role so naturally, you honestly believed he was someone who spent years honing these skills.While I think Brad Pitt did alright in his role as Bishop, the real reason to watch this movie is to see Robert Redford in action.  He's truly a master of his craft, and he doesn't let down here.  The story is a little weak, and the ending is a cop out, but Redford brings this movie up from a mediocre thriller to one that's worth renting, at the very least.",4,It's not how you play the game.

Mok,"[5, 6]","Robert Redford wasn't able to quite elevate The Last Castle from its limp, oversimplistic depths, but he certainly succeeds in Spy Game, a thriller constantly threatening to sink under its own weight but ultimately succeeding on old-fashioned star power.The role of Nathan Muir allows Redford to resurrect the irreverent, witty persona that had launched him into superstardom in the first place, in classics such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. The best scenes in Spy Games are hands-down the ones where Muir spars verbally with Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), and the centerpiece -- a montage where Muir instructs Bishop on the tools of spying -- is terrific, also forming the theatrical trailer which had tempted me into watching this film in the first place.It's too bad this movie moves forward in lurches and spurts. Bogged down by too much flashback, the central problem of rescuing Bishop becomes entirely moot. I can't say the flashbacks were all uninteresting; I just wish they had been more economical. Bishop's love interest (Catherine McCormack, stuck with a very vague role) enters the movie way past the halfway point, resulting in a seriously off-balance narrative. MTV-style overcutting also hurt. Veteran action director Tony Scott has generated much more excitement with much less empty flair in the past, in films like Top Gun, The Last Boy Scout and Enemy of the State. At times, the camera and editing trickery simply serve to drag down the performances, the multiple locations and schizophrenic music also coming together jarringly.But thankfully, just when things get too grandiose for their own good, we come back to Redford's scenes. It's simply a lot of fun watching Muir manipulate everybody around him. The idea of a high-ranking CIA director messing with national security is a pretty disturbing one if you think about it, but after all, Spy Games is popcorn entertainment and shouldn't be taken too seriously.",3,Redford rescues the bad structure and hyperactive editing.,1018742400,"04 14, 2002",2002,1952,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'quite', 'elevate', 'Last', 'Castle', 'limp', 'oversimplistic', 'depths', 'certainly', 'Spy', 'Game', 'thriller', 'constantly', 'threatening', 'sink', 'own', 'weight', 'ultimately', 'succeeding', 'old-fashioned', 'star', 'power.The', 'role', 'Nathan', 'Muir', 'Redford', 'resurrect', 'irreverent', 'witty', 'persona', 'had', 'launched', 'superstardom', 'first', 'place', 'classics', 'such', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Sting', 'best', 'scenes', 'Spy', 'Games', 'are', 'hands-down', 'ones', 'where', 'Muir', 'verbally', 'Tom', 'Bishop', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'centerpiece', 'montage', 'where', 'Muir', 'Bishop', 'tools', 'spying', 'terrific', 'also', 'forming', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'had', 'tempted', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'place.It', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'forward', 'lurches', 'spurts', 'Bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'flashback', 'central', 'problem', 'rescuing', 'Bishop', 'entirely', 'moot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'uninteresting', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'economical', 'Bishop', 'love', 'interest', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'stuck', 'very', 'vague', 'role', 'movie', 'way', 'halfway', 'point', 'resulting', 'seriously', 'off-balance', 'narrative', 'MTV-style', 'overcutting', 'also', 'hurt', 'Veteran', 'action', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'generated', 'much', 'more', 'excitement', 'much', 'less', 'empty', 'flair', 'past', 'films', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Last', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Enemy', 'State', 'times', 'camera', 'editing', 'trickery', 'simply', 'serve', 'drag', 'down', 'performances', 'multiple', 'locations', 'schizophrenic', 'music', 'also', 'coming', 'together', 'jarringly.But', 'thankfully', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'grandiose', 'own', 'good', 'come', 'back', 'Redford', 'scenes', 'simply', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'Muir', 'manipulate', 'everybody', 'idea', 'high-ranking', 'CIA', 'director', 'messing', 'national', 'security', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'one', 'think', 'Spy', 'Games', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

584375,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00005JKBB,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[2, 4]","Though I like both major actors, I avoided this movie for awhile, mostly because the the prominence of the mugs of two of the biggest movie pretty boys of all time posititioned prominently on the cover.  And the start of the movie didn't help, either.  You've got Younger Hunk waltzing into a Chinese prison, allegedly as a doctor giving out cholera shots to the prisoners.  Just like the start of a James Bond film, you're expecting Younger Hunk to escape the prison using some new-fangled gadget like flying shoes while a hot babe is ready with his cold drink as soon as he's out of immediate danger.Well, surprises on top of surprises, the movie doesn't head that way.  Instead, Younger Hunk gets captured, and spends 99% of the rest of the movie in the slammer, getting his hunk face messed up quite a bit, probably by guards whose girlfriends like Brad Pitt way to much to suit them.But don't worry girls (and some guys).  We get to see him in his glory through most of the movie, as Older Hunk steps in to see what he can do to rescue Younger Hunk.  Problem is, Older Hunk is on his last day at the CIA, most of his security is gone, and a lot of his co-workers wish he would just go away.  So O.H. has to explain his connection to Y. H. to these people, which gives us a lot of scenes with OH showing Y.H. the tricks of the spy game.I liked several things about the movie.  While the whole point of the movie is for O.H. to spring Y.H., and the final scene to do this does involve force, it's not your usual action picture where everything is settled at gunpoint.  It's the planning of the operation, where O.H. has to dig in his past, and cash in some major favors with people to get it done, while keeping certain CIA managers in the dark.  How he does it is probably very unlikely, but at least brains, and not brawn drive the movie.I also like where several times during the movie, both Hunks need to pause to question how down and dirty they are willing to get to get a mission done.

The story is intelligent, the action is brisk and the suspense taut.Tony Scott orchestrates the project well, perhaps overdoing the musical element a bit, but pacing well and creating an effective weave between flashbacks and current day events.  Yet, there are a couple of areas that bothered me.  First, Muir (Robert Redford) was consistently developed throughout the film to be a hardened leader, always looking at the big picture and following the imperative regardless of the human cost.  So, his rogue operation to save Bishop is completely out of character.  Not only is it difficult to believe that the CIA would have been fooled by some of his deceptions, it is hard to swallow the fact that he would have risked everything to pursue a rescue that was antithetical to his training, beliefs and personality.It is also difficult to understand how Bishop was allowed to stay in the field, given his penchant for disobeying orders and his continual development of emotional attachments to his various human assets.  Such recklessness would never have been tolerated, because it would have endangered him, the assets, and would have potentially compromised whatever mission he was working on.  However, I suppose I need to cut the writers a little slack or otherwise there would have been no story.Robert Redford turns in an excellent performance, giving Muir a very hard edge and cunning mind.  Brad Pitt proves to be an effective action hero.  This is the kind of role in which Pitt shines, playing the dark, rebellious character that lives by his own code and gives in to no one.  Catherine McCormack also delivers a credible performance as the humanitarian aid worker playing both sides of the street to get supplies for the disadvantaged.Action lovers will enjoy this film as will those who like a mentally challenging story.

SPY GAME as written by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata and directed with distinction by Tony Scott reminds us how thrilling films of this ilk can be without the need for computer generated aliens, or vampires, or werewolves, or zombies or outrageous extraterrestrial effects, etc. The dialogue is smart, balanced with humor when appropriate, and played with a fine assemblage of actors who know how to terrify us simply by telling a visual story.CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is on the brink of retirement when he finds out that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been arrested in China for espionage. No stranger to the machinations of the CIA's top echelon, Muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free Bishop. As he embarks on his mission to free Bishop, Muir recalls how he recruited and trained the young rookie, at that time a sergeant in Vietnam, their turbulent times together as operatives and the woman who threatened their friendship. There is of course the requisite female agent (Catherine McCormack), a top member of the CIA (Stephen Dillane) who allows us to see how corrupt that organization can be, and the ever grounded secretary (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) to remind us that the people involved in this world wide intrigue are really just human beings - even if they misbehave in their jobs.Made in 2001 this film remains a skillful winner - just the ticket for watching in the stifling heat of summer time.

And for that reason, they can't understand why Redford would risk everything he has - life savings, career, et.al. - to save him.  Wasn't Redford's character right the first time?Ask yourself this: if the British terrorist had not been played by the beautiful, soft skinned Catherine McCormack but rather by Roseanne Barr, would you sincerely believe that she was worth breaking out of prison?  Call that remark cruel if you like, but remember that it's Tony Scott who's truly insulted the viewers by suggesting that murderous, terrorist tactics are not so bad so long as the girl supporting them looks good and says things like, ""and I have to live with that.""Still, the scene at the end with Redford racing the vintage Porsche off the CIA grounds is pretty cool.

Riddled with cliches, SPY GAME benefits only from the solid performances by Redford and Pitt.  The plot is somewhat intricate though never very compelling.An espionage thriller must at least be grounded in plausibility to be truly involving for the viewer, and this one never quite gets there.I may be nitpicking here, but for me the movie lost some credibility in the first reel:  Rogue CIA agent Pitt enters a Chinese prison under the guise of a relief worker giving medical aid, and from there he orchestrates a prisoner rescue.  In searching the prison for his target, he spies a prisoner huddled in a corner and gives him a piece of chewing gum.  Soon after, Pitt's cover is blown when that prisoner is seen walking around blowing bubbles with the gum.  It was CHEWING gum, not BUBBLE gum.  I didn't look for a reason to nitpick -- this one just jumped out at me.Most of the film is told through flashback while Redford sits in a CIA boardroom with his superiors.  But if it weren't for director Tony Scott repeatedly showing us a countdown clock to Pitt's impending execution, there would be very little sense of urgency to the proceedings.  As with many cliche-ridden plotlines, things get wrapped up a bit too conveniently and in the nick of time.I don't recommend this one for purchase.

He's tipped off by outside sources that something has gone wrong with his protoge Tom Bishop, played by Brad Pitt, whom is a another CIA field operative whom has been recruited and trained by Nathan Muir. Muir arrives at work on his last day of work to figure out what exactly is going on.During the next 24 hours, Nathan Muir pieces together that Tom Bishop has be captured by the Chinese for espionage and will be executed within 24 hours if the USA doesn't claim him. The upper tier of management at the CIA isn't going to claim/rescue Tom Bishop. Instead, letting him be executed by the Chinese because the U.S. President is about to visit China the following week regarding future trade between the U.S. & China.... It is the CIA's take that claiming Bishop will look badly on the US and ruin any future trade with China. To make matters worse, Bishop wasn't on any official assignment to China on behalf of the CIA and the US has no idea why he has broken into a Chinese Prison.... So the real question being asked is by the CIA: Is Tom Bishop a rogue agent OR not?Throughout the rest of the movie we see Nathan Muir using his skills as a field operative within the CIA's headquarters to find out what is going on with Tom Bishop.

Muir only tells them as much as they need to know as he plans to rescue Bishop from China before the 24 hour time period once he finds out from upper management where Tom Bishop is being held.The twists and turns throughout this movie show us how Nathan Muir rescues Tom Bishop and what/why Tom Bishop was doing in China in the first place.

584406,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00005JKBB,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[4, 4]","It is refreshing to watch an older Robert Redford pitting his acting skills against a younger Brad Pitt in this spy thriller movie. Both of them acted very well despite the sketchy plot.To me, the storyline is pretty straight-forward: A retiring CIA operative, Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) learned that his protege, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), had been arrested in China as a result of a botched rescue attempt of his girl-friend. He was due to be executed shortly. Because of vested interests, CIA refused to mount a rescue. Out of friendship, Muir engineered a successful but unauthorised rescue.The entire movie is beautifully choreographed through black & white flash-backs & pure dialogue, during which Muir recalled his personal encounter & close friendship with his protege. That relationsip spanned across a timeline of about twenty years, from the Vietnam War in the 70's, to the end of the cold war in Berlin during the 80's & then to the mean streets of Beirut in the 90's.The movie moves on to show how Muir had taught Bishop all the skills (or dirty tricks?) of spycraft...how to case a restaurant, fix a radio,...to be callous, look at the big picture...to stay remote...to sell out people if that's of use...to kill.There is no typical high-octane action sequences in this spy thriller movie, except for a heart-pounding escape scene in a China prison.Throughout the movie, one can see how Muir had to use his wits & all the skills (or dirty tricks?) he had learned while working for the CIA to out-smart the CIA's top echelon as well as his fellow CIA operatives to mount a personally-financed rescue mission.I really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie. I just loved the part where he juxtaposed CIA satellite images to fool his bosses. He even forged the signature of the CIA Director. At the end of it, all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening & had happened.On the whole, I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller. It is also comforting to know that an accomplished  Singaporean actor, Adrian Pang, had a small role in the movie.

And that's great because the projects he made with Jerry Bruckheimer were below average.  &quot;Spy Game&quot; also marks the return of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt after &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, in which Redford directed Pitt.&quot;Spy Game&quot; tells the story of a retiring CIA agent (Redford) who trains a rookie (Pitt) in the art of espionage.  The relation between the two is the strongest point in the movie because, as a teacher myself, I felt attracted to the fact that a mentor cannot turn his back on his proteg&eacute;, no matter what the circumstances are.  All the way from Washington, D.C., Redford has to make plans to rescue Pitt, who is captured and detained in a Chinese prison while trying to rescue a mysterious pacifist woman (&quot;Braveheart&quot;'s Catherine MacCormack).

584412,A1XX37HBK45UG8,B00005JKBB,L. Wallach,"[6, 11]","Spy Game is a movie that is so slickly made, it's hard to come to an immediate impression about the film. Sure it looks and sounds great, but is there any substance? Going through the commentary tracks, we learn that of course there was a lot of thinking about what was going on behind the scenes. Unfortunately without the commentary tracks, the glossy feel, constant fast cuts, and other devices that director Tony Scott uses, takes away from the viewer's ability to get into the minds or emotions of the characters and even to understand everything that it transpiring.Spy Games is a thriller set in 1991 right after the cold war has ended. Robert Redford, playing Nathan Muir, an old-school CIA agent about to retire, learns that Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), a much younger agent who he had trained years ago, has ""gone rogue"" and has been captured in an attempt to rescue a prisoner in a Chinese prison. The Chinese are threatening to execute him as a common criminal in 24 hours and Muir has been brought in to shed some light on who Bishop is. From here the story unfolds as a series of flashbacks covering the past encounters between Bishop and Muir, how Bishop was trained, various missions in Berlin and Lebanon, etc. Intermixed between these flashbacks Scott refocuses onto the present (which is 1991 in the film) and Muir's struggle to get to the bottom of what his superiors want to do with Bishop's situation and trying to launch his own independent plans to circumvent the Agency's.Perhaps it is because they are all spies, but the characters don't seem to be fully developed. We see their actions and some heated dialogue, but I was left with not really knowing how much was the ""game"" that they had to play in order to use people. As I mentioned, there is a lot of fast cutting, stills, and other camera tricks in this film, and this makes it similar to other Scott efforts like Enemy of the State. To some extent you almost feel like you are in an MTV video - everything's so stylized. Perhaps this distracts us enough to where it makes it difficult for the viewer to understand the players beyond the obvious and superficial, but it does admittedly add lots of texture and energy to the film as well.Spy Game is presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, anamorphically enhanced for 16x9 TV's. The transfer is very clean and sharp, and shows off well the different coloring schemes that Scott utilizes throughout the movie (he uses different tones and saturation levels to depict various places and times within the story). The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track is very lively - Scott is as slick when it comes to sound as he is with video, and this is definitely a film that one can use to show off one's audio system. There is also a DD 5.1 French track as well as a DTS 5.1 English track.The disc has a pretty sizeable set of special features, adding a lot of value, and without which the film would probably seem very incomplete. There are nine ""deleted scenes"" and ""alternate versions of existing scenes"" available both with and without the director's commentary. These clips uncover alternate storylines that could have added a lot more depth both to the characters and to their relationships with one another, shedding a whole new light on the film itself. So these are very helpful in understanding the film beyond its slick exterior. The commentary tracks are, of course, very helpful as well. There's a commentary by Scott, which runs the gamut from talking about the actors and the making of the film to more of the background information that puts the story into much greater perspective. The second track is with Producers Mark Abraham and Douglas Wick and is expectedly more focused on the making of the film and all the technical and logistical aspects surrounding that. Both tracks are fairly interesting and insightful, but I would not rate them among the best commentaries I've listened to. Next comes ""Clandestine Ops"" which is billed as ""A unique viewing experience that puts you in control. Go behind-the-scenes and gain access to classified information simultaneously while watching the film."" What this boils down to is that you have to watch the entire film over again and watch for a graphical cue that tells you to hit a button that will bring up a kind of mini ""making-of"" clip relating to something you just saw in the movie. Although an interesting method of getting info, after watching the 2+ hour film and much of the commentary tracks and deleted scenes, I would have much rather had a simple making-of featurette which encapsulated all of the ones in ""Clandestine Ops."" Hey, they could even have provided both and left it up to the viewer to choose which method he would like to view these making-of clips! There's a small textual piece, which shows the requirements for getting into the CIA, which was interesting. There was also a short piece that included some recounting by Scott (and examples) of how he creates storyboards and gets his filming ideas from them - he was originally a painter before getting into film. Finally there is DVD-ROM material which I did not view as I dd not have one at my disposal.Spy Games is a good bet for those who are into spy thrillers and slick action flicks. Even for those who are not necessarily into these genres but like the challenge of watching something that appears mostly superficial and yet actually has a lot going on behind the scenes, there's a lot on this disc to sink one's teeth into. If you are looking for lots of character and relationship development, you'd probably best be served with another film.",3,Slick thriller with lots of special features.,1017792000,"04 3,

Brad Pitt is an American-as-apple-pie CIA operative who unaccountably falls in love with a limey leftist terrorist whose only crime, apart from being not-so-loosely affiliated with Hezbollah, was bombing a Chinese embassy.  ""It was supposed to be empty, but it wasn't.  And I have to live with that.""  Wait, let me get out my handkerchief: this babe's got it rough.  Apparently her murderous terrorism didn't clear her brain of her leftism any, because here she is collaborating with terrorists in Beirut.  But the whole thing of the movie is that she eventually is nabbed by the Chinese authorities - and rightly so - and is rotting in some Chinese prison - and rightly so.  However, the human rights groups may be having some effect on the place, because she, despite her confinement, is softly lit, seems to have some art up on the walls and is burning a copious supply of incense.  Anyway, Pitt gets wind of all this and he flips his wig, goes in there on his own recognizance to bust her out don't you know.  And naturally he gets busted - and rightly so - and so his old boss Redford commits massive fraud all over the CIA to commandeer a US spec ops strike team to bust the two of them out of the Chinese pokey.  In reality this would involve American and Chinese casualties incurred in the act of wrongly liberating these two dingbats and would lead to a probably very serious diplomatic problem between two nuclear powers but Hollywood prefers not to think about that.

584415,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B00005JKBB,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[5, 5]","I liked this movie more after watching it multiple times. It's not the kind of movie you necessarily enjoy watching over and over, but it is nice to watch after you've already unraveled the sometimes-confusing plot so that you can enjoy the show.The movie follows two storylines, the first a flashback involving the relationship of CIA Field Manager Redford and his recruit-turned-prot&eacute;g&eacute; Pitt. The current storyline involves Redford's efforts to save Pitt from the depths of a Chinese prison while the rest of the CIA is working to bury him.Redford's character is pretty cool, with the street-smarts of a Harry Bosch combined with a slick comfort in the presence of administrators that Bosch could never muster. He is basically trying to redeem himself for a lifetime of morally ambiguous CIA dealings by putting his career and even freedom on the line on Pitt's behalf.The camera cuts are gritty and fast-paced, without being so MTV'ed out that they distract from the story. The story is simple and intriguing, with the most pleasure coming from Redford's little tricks that, on the one hand, are so old fashioned that they wouldn't seem out of place in a quaint gumshoe noir, but on the other hand are just clever enough to be believable in foiling the CIA.The movie bogs down in some of the flashbacks in my opinion, and the cuts from present to past and back again get slightly confusing if you're not paying close attention.",4,Redford as foxy old dog fun to see,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1444,"['liked', 'movie', 'more', 'watching', 'multiple', 'times', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'nice', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'already', 'unraveled', 'sometimes-confusing', 'plot', 'can', 'enjoy', 'show.The', 'movie', 'two', 'storylines', 'first', 'flashback', 'involving', 'relationship', 'CIA', 'Field', 'Manager', 'Redford', 'recruit-turned-prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Pitt', 'current', 'storyline', 'Redford', 'efforts', 'save', 'Pitt', 'depths', 'Chinese', 'prison', 'rest', 'CIA', 'working', 'bury', 'him.Redford', 'character', 'pretty', 'cool', 'street-smarts', 'Harry', 'Bosch', 'combined', 'slick', 'comfort', 'presence', 'administrators', 'Bosch', 'could', 'never', 'muster', 'basically', 'trying', 'redeem', 'lifetime', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'CIA', 'dealings', 'putting', 'career', 'even', 'freedom', 'line', 'Pitt', 'behalf.The', 'camera', 'cuts', 'are', 'gritty', 'fast-paced', 'being', 'so', ""MTV'ed"", 'out', 'distract', 'story', 'story', 'simple', 'intriguing', 'most', 'pleasure', 'coming', 'Redford', 'little', 'tricks', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'so', 'old', 'fashioned', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'place', 'quaint', 'gumshoe', 'noir', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'just', 'clever', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'foiling', 'CIA.The', 'movie', 'bogs', 'down', 'flashbacks', 'opinion', 'cuts', 'present', 'past', 'back', 'again', 'get', 'slightly', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', 'close', 'attention']",N/A
584416,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKBB,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","""Spy Game"" brings back the espionage thriller in a big way. It also brings back Robert Redford, who has been largely absent in the last decade due to his commitments to the Sundance Film Institute. The spy genre is still viable, and certainly so is Mr. Redford.Redford plays Nathan Muir, a CIA agent who, on the day he is supposed to retire, finds out that he has one more job left. His boss asks him to fill the agency in on Tom Bishop [Brad Pitt], a spy who has been caught trying to break a woman named Elizabeth [Catherine McCormack] out of a Chinese prison. Bishop is to be executed in 24 hours, and the CIA has decided not to interfere in order not to jeopardize a trade agreement the US and China are about to sign.The movie uses flashbacks to show the relationship between the three characters. Muir first meets Bishop in the 1960s in Vietnam. Later, in Berlin, the two meet again, and Muir begins a successful campaign to recruit Bishop into the CIA. During the training process, Muir teaches the younger man many tricks. He also explains to him that spies often have to stand idly by as basically decent people get hurt in order to achieve some greater goal. This is difficult for Bishop to accept because he is basically an all-American kid who just wants to get the bad guys, but as time goes on, he seems to accept this aspect of the job. He also meets and falls in love with Elizabeth in Beirut. The affair ends, partly because of Bishop's work. Now, years later, Muir must decide if he can overcome his own corrupt moral code, as well as an indifferent CIA, in order to save his star pupil.Some critics have said that Redford and Pitt are too blandly good-looking to be believable as secret agents, but I disagree. These two could charm their way into any situation, and this seems to me to be a great assets for any spy.Director Tony Scott uses stylish, MTV-like camera techniques. While they make the movie visually brilliant to look at, they sometimes distract from what is basically a character study. Fortunately, Redford and Pitt's acting abilities, as well as the very decent script, override this problem.""Spy Game"" came out two months after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, and it shows how quickly attitudes can change. Before 9-11, many of us would have agreed that the CIA's tactics are often unscrupulous and embarrassing. Now, though, Muir's Machiavellian point of view seems almost well reasoned and somewhat just. Note, however, that the film shows what a devastating effect such a philosophy can have on those who practice it.",4,Good spy thriller is also interesting character study,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,2553,"['Spy', 'Game', 'back', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'big', 'way', 'also', 'back', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'been', 'largely', 'absent', 'last', 'decade', 'due', 'commitments', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Institute', 'spy', 'genre', 'still', 'viable', 'certainly', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Redford.Redford', 'Nathan', 'Muir', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'day', 'supposed', 'retire', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'job', 'left', 'boss', 'fill', 'agency', 'Tom', 'Bishop', '[', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ']', 'spy', 'who', 'been', 'caught', 'trying', 'break', 'woman', 'named', 'Elizabeth', '[', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'Chinese', 'prison', 'Bishop', 'be', 'executed', '24', 'hours', 'CIA', 'decided', 'not', 'interfere', 'order', 'not', 'jeopardize', 'trade', 'agreement', 'US', 'China', 'are', 'sign.The', 'movie', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'relationship', 'three', 'characters', 'Muir', 'first', 'meets', 'Bishop', '1960s', 'Vietnam', 'Later', 'Berlin', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'Muir', 'successful', 'campaign', 'recruit', 'Bishop', 'CIA', 'training', 'process', 'Muir', 'younger', 'man', 'many', 'tricks', 'also', 'spies', 'often', 'have', 'stand', 'idly', 'basically', 'decent', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'order', 'achieve', 'greater', 'goal', 'difficult', 'Bishop', 'accept', 'basically', 'all-American', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'bad', 'guys', 'time', 'accept', 'aspect', 'job', 'also', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'Beirut', 'affair', 'partly', 'Bishop', 'work', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'Muir', 'must', 'decide', 'can', 'overcome', 'own', 'corrupt', 'moral', 'code', 'as', 'well', 'indifferent', 'CIA', 'order', 'save', 'star', 'pupil.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'Redford', 'Pitt', 'are', 'too', 'blandly', 'good-looking', 'be', 'believable', 'secret', 'agents', 'disagree', 'two', 'could', 'charm', 'way', 'situation', 'be', 'great', 'assets', 'spy.Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'stylish', 'MTV-like', 'camera', 'techniques', 'make', 'movie', 'visually', 'brilliant', 'look', 'sometimes', 'distract', 'what', 'basically', 'character', 'study', 'Fortunately', 'Redford', 'Pitt', 'acting', 'abilities', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'decent', 'script', 'problem', 'Spy', 'Game', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'months', '9-11', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'how', 'quickly', 'attitudes', 'can', 'change', '9-11', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'agreed', 'CIA', 'tactics', 'are', 'often', 'unscrupulous', 'embarrassing', 'Now', 'Muir', 'Machiavellian', 'point', 'view', 'almost', 'well', 'reasoned', 'somewhat', 'just', 'Note', 'however', 'film', 'what', 'devastating', 'effect', 'philosophy', 'can', 'have', 'who', 'practice']",N/A

584423,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,B00005JKBB,"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[16, 17]","Director Tony Scott should take the main bow for SPY GAME, an intellectual spy flick and primarily a director's film. With locations shot in Beirut, Lebanon, Berlin, Budapest, Casablanca, England,  Haifa, Hong Kong, and Prague, a certain color and realism is guaranteed. And, sure enough, the photography and direction are in capable hands as is the script, which seems flawless. You gals out there might note that BOTH Robert Redford and Brad Pitt star in this slick tale of the CIA spy game. (Yummy!) Some reviewers seem concerned about an emotional flatness between Pitt and Redford but, hey, these guys are trained killers or at least serious craftsmen in the field. You feel too much as a CIA agent, you forfeit your life, my friend. So let's get real, okay? And very real is SPY GAME. The plot is intricate and layered as a wedding cake. CIA veteran Nathan Muir (Redford) is retiring and on his last day at his CIA job (what a waste of talent!) and his impulsive younger protege Tom Bishop (Pitt) is being held in a Chinese prison about to be executed for a botched rogue operation. How Muir saves the day for Bishop from long distance, being watched and questioned by his superiors in Washington who would rather see Bishop be executed by the Chicoms, is the crux of the story.

584424,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKBB,Mike,"[2, 6]","&quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001)I really hate to break it to you, but Spy Game is frankly a big disappointment. I was expecting a lot of this movie because it has the two of my favourite actors, Brad Pitt and Robert Redford. The trailer for this movie also looked excellent, and I was intrigued by the pairing of these 2 actors, who look so much alike and perform in the same style. This movie could've and should've worked given the talent working on the film. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, Spy Game is an exercise in boredom.Fortunately, there are some good points, but I'll start with why I didn't like this movie. The main reason is because in some aspects the filmmakers have taken their audiences for dummies. I mean, come on, you could at least put a little makeup on Robert Redford. He looks exactly the same in the current part of the film as he did, what, like 30 years back? Brad Pitt also looks identical. The movie also moves along at a very slow pace, and the last half-hour was very boring and I didn't really care about the outcome of the film. The flashback sequences are the only really entertaining parts of the movie, the meetings and continuous talk in Washington started to really get to me, because a) I wasn't sure if Redford's colleagues were on his side, and b) there was just way too much blabber and not enough action.I was also disappointed with the ""spy"" aspect of the film. This movie mostly just makes out a spy as a person who goes to different countries, sees different things and takes a heck of a lot of photos. I mean, the movie demonstrated the aspects of spying and going behind people's back better than Harriet the Spy, but I would've liked a deeper insight.All that said, I loved the style of the movie. The zoom-all-around-the-place shots were very well done and I enjoyed how the movie did put in a mysterious atmosphere, whether it just used steam or smoke, or just a whole bunch of cool, different sort of shots. That's basically what this movie is - cool. Not in sense of story at all, but just in the way it looks. And that's what kept me in my seat.Apart from of course the superb chemistry between Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, which manages to be a saving grace. I especially enjoyed the scenes were Redford was training Pitt's character to be a spy. Unfortunately that all ends too son. Anyway, Redford is not bad at all, and I don't usually like his acting. He proves to us he is not getting old fast, and he can still play a good action man. He isn't topped by the excellent Pitt, who comes across as charming, strong and interesting. I also enjoyed a little cameo by Charlotte Rampling.There are good aspects of this movie, but they are overrun by the pace and timing of the movie. I wasn't really interested in the movie as a whole and it was a disappointment. Even worse, they had to throw in a horrid love story clich&eacute;. I can confirm overall that this isn't a game I'll want to be playing again anytime soon.MY GRADE: C",2,Boring!,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,2986,"['quot', 'Spy', 'Game', 'quot', '2001', 'really', 'hate', 'break', 'Spy', 'Game', 'frankly', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'movie', 'two', 'favourite', 'actors', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'trailer', 'movie', 'also', 'looked', 'excellent', 'was', 'intrigued', 'pairing', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'perform', 'same', 'style', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'should', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'given', 'talent', 'working', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Spy', 'Game', 'exercise', 'boredom.Fortunately', 'are', 'good', 'points', ""'ll"", 'start', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'main', 'reason', 'aspects', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'taken', 'audiences', 'dummies', 'mean', 'come', 'could', 'least', 'put', 'little', 'makeup', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'exactly', 'same', 'current', 'part', 'film', 'did', 'what', '30', 'years', 'back', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'also', 'identical', 'movie', 'also', 'along', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'last', 'half-hour', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'outcome', 'film', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'are', 'only', 'really', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'movie', 'meetings', 'continuous', 'talk', 'Washington', 'started', 'really', 'get', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Redford', 'colleagues', 'were', 'side', 'b', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'blabber', 'not', 'enough', 'action.I', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'spy', 'aspect', 'film', 'movie', 'mostly', 'just', 'out', 'spy', 'person', 'who', 'different', 'countries', 'sees', 'different', 'things', 'heck', 'lot', 'photos', 'mean', 'movie', 'demonstrated', 'aspects', 'spying', 'going', 'people', 'back', 'better', 'Harriet', 'Spy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'deeper', 'insight.All', 'said', 'loved', 'style', 'movie', 'zoom-all-around-the-place', 'shots', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'did', 'put', 'mysterious', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'used', 'steam', 'smoke', 'just', 'whole', 'bunch', 'cool', 'different', 'sort', 'shots', 'basically', 'what', 'movie', 'cool', 'Not', 'sense', 'story', 'just', 'way', 'what', 'kept', 'seat.Apart', 'course', 'superb', 'chemistry', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'be', 'saving', 'grace', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'were', 'Redford', 'was', 'training', 'Pitt', 'character', 'be', 'spy', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'son', 'Anyway', 'Redford', 'not', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'acting', 'not', 'getting', 'old', 'fast', 'can', 'still', 'play', 'good', 'action', 'man', ""n't"", 'topped', 'excellent', 'Pitt', 'who', 'charming', 'strong', 'interesting', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'cameo', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling.There', 'are', 'good', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'overrun', 'pace', 'timing', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Even', 'worse', 'had', 'throw', 'horrid', 'love', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'confirm', 'overall', ""n't"", 'game', ""'ll"", 'want', 'be', 'playing', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon.MY', 'GRADE', 'C']",N/A

584430,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JKBB,Patrick L. Randall,"[1, 1]","""Spy Game"" is a movie that has a wonderful back story about a cagey CIA veteran's recruitment and development of a top Marine sniper for undercover work and the evolution of the their friendship.  It gets bogged down by trying to slap a current day operation over the telling of the back story.  This story is expertly developed as it shows CIA vet, Nathan Muir's (Robert Redford), introduction to a brash, young Marine, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) during Vietnam.  Muir recruits Bishop to go on a very risky sniper mission to take out a top Vietnamese general.  Bishop overcomes some tremendous obstacles (including an attack helicopter) and succeeds in his mission.  An impressed Muir makes a mental note that he thinks Bishop would make a good agent and slowly begins working the machinery to make him a viable candidate (i.e. making it so he duty posts keep in Europe and away from people he knows, thereby cutting off his ties to others).  Muir reappears in Bishop's life at a key moment where he feels Bishop will be most suggestible to CIA work.  After putting Bishop through a couple of quick tests, Muir concludes that he will make an excellent operative and thus begins a relationship of more than 15 years (which this movie covers) in which the mentor continues to development and enhancement of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in the world of espionage.Of course, if that alone was the movie, ""Spy Game"" would have come across as a compelling look at the challenges this men take on and the sacrifices they make in the name of service to the country.  Unfortunately, there is a whole separate act to this movie running parallel to this back story.  In involves a current day operation (which, in this movie, is 1991) where Bishop, acting independently, poses as a public health worker to infiltrate a Chinese prison and free some unknown hostage.  The mission gets compromised and Bishop gets scheduled for execution.  When Muir's superiors at the CIA get wind of this, they essentially interrogate him about his relationship with Bishop while also trying to distance themselves from this action, lest an international incident occurs with China while trade talks are in the balance.  In between Q&A; sessions, Muir works hard behind the scenes to try and free Bishop (for he feels partly responsible for his predicament, even though he had no direct knowledge of it).  During these sequences, the whole back story of Muir and Bishop is explained.  The problem is, the present day situation isn't very compelling or interesting.  When the movie ends, you realize that you got about 90 minutes of back story and only about 10 minutes of actual plot.  That leads to inevitable feelings of disappointment when one realizes that this movie could have been so much more.  Interestingly, had it been less, it would have been more.  As it has been said, the back story of the relationship between Muir and Bishop is very well done and quite compelling.  Left as that, this movie would have been enough.  The tacked-on modern storyline just bogs down the rest of the picture and doesn't add much of anything to the entire package.  ""Spy Game"" is still a good watch.

It turned out to be a good film, all because of Robert Redford.Robert Redford, plays Nathan Muir, as a CIA spy.  we see him in the last 24 hours of his last day at work.  Brad Pitt, plays Tom Bishop, as a young recruit. Catherine McCormack, plays Hadley, a love interest of Bishop. She was sent to China on a top secret mission, and when trouble developed, Bishop was sent to save her. All of this in a 25 year time span, and we see the past in flash backs, partly while Muir is being questioned by the CIA hierarchy.  All the while Muir has been acting to get both Bishop and Hadley back, against the CIA's orders. As his last day takes place, we see how this develops and how his leaders really know nothing about him. All they think they know is wrong.This is an action film, but much of it is head games.

584441,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JKBB,"""qmlhcb""","[2, 2]","Spy Game is a clever action flick with a cool soundtrack and a few fun ideas that resists becoming too gimmicky for their own good.Beginning in the early 90's, Robert Redford plays operative Nathan Muir in his last day on the job when he is brought in for questioning about agent Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) he enlisted and trained but is now held prisoner in China for espionage. The film then goes back and forth between the drama of the present as CIA officials decide Pitt's fate, and the action of the past as Redford incorporates Pitt into the CIA.The film manages to avoid falling back on over-used and often annoying devices of most flashback movies, and creates a fresh approach using fun, zooming camera shots with an upbeat music track. There's nothing deep here, just fun action done well in a time when many action films are becoming stale retreads of one another.Much of this is thanks to action-director-extraordinare Tony Scott, who made one of my favorite films, True Romance, as well as Top Gun. He knows how to make a fun, entertaining action flick without relying too much on over-used ideas. The acting is all around decent too. The main characters have three dimensions, a plus in action flicks.This is just a fun action flick definitely worth a few viewings.

584442,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00005JKBB,R.A. McKenzie,"[21, 22]","When this movie came out in November 2001, my big brothers took me to see a movie that had Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  ""Hmm,"" I thought, ""I'm not sure about this, but it's a free ticket, so what the hell?""  Believe me when I say that this movie is so much more complex, intense, and entertaining than it looks.  The trailer gives the totally wrong impression of what SPY GAME is about.  This is not --- I repeat 'NOT' --- an ""action"" movie.  Instead, SPY GAME takes a thinking-person's knack for clever storytelling, and juices it up with the flashy and quick style seen in many of today's movies.  Again, don't let the trailer allow you to judge this film.Tony Scott's movies have always had that quick-cut, fast-paced, full-force style to them.  His brother Ridley Scott is a much better filmmaker; why is that?  Because Ridley (THELMA & LOUISE, BLACK HAWK DOWN, ALIEN) has better control of the action and knows when to tone things down.  In SPY GAME, Tony Scott finally finds his niche in great filmmaking, where style is complimented by good characters and a terrific story.Nathan Muir (wonderfully played by Robert Redford)is a CIA operative, who on January 1991, is on his last day before retirement.  However, his protege Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt in one of his better roles) is captured in Su Chou Prison in China, while the U.S. and the Chinese are negotiating trade talks.When Muir learns of Bishop's capture, he races against time to save him from execution.  Unfortunately, some CIA investiagtors and bureaucrats aren't as eager because of the aforementioned trade talks.  What's fascinating about this setup is that Muir is always one step ahead of the game than those who want to abandon the rogue agent.  Instead of this being the ""Muir/CIA Showdown"" (which we do get some clever exchanges), there is actually a character study underneath it all.  As Muir is surrounded in a conference surrounded by his adversaries, pretending to play ball with them, he gives them details about Bishop's past, training, and work ethic.  The storytelling is slightly faulty, because there are a few moments where Muir seems to be talking to the audience instead of the characters.  But this is where Tony Scott's energy saves these awkward moments, because Scott knew this much dialogue needs good camerawork & actors to keep us interested.  Scott invested enough time in the characters as well as the audience's thirst for high-stakes thrills.Robert Redford hasn't really changed his acting that much since BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, but that's because he's smart enough to know his limitations.  He isn't a chameleon who creates characters; Redford just uses his natural gifts to embody the role with his own mannerisms.Brad Pitt also doesn't do anything groundbreaking, but is also in the right frame of mind that Redford is.  Pitt possesses the charm of a gifted agent but the brash ego of a rookie.  The supporting cast is also simply acting the way we expect reliable character actors to perform --- they don't try to steal the show and trust the filmmakers.  This approach allows Scott's filmmaking style to drive the thriller at its best pace.Pitt and Redford have a chemistry that makes us believe that Muir actually takes pride in Bishop's skills, while needing to maintain discipline and control over his new job.  Pitt's counter-reactions to Muir's mind-games give both men a texture not often seen in espionage flicks.  SPY GAME involves the morality of the two men, rather than preach about more universal themes.I hate flashback sequences, but these are impressive and never slow down; much credit belongs to Redford because his narrative voice keeps things going.  The present-time Muir/CIA games are very much like a poker game.  Without giving away too much, the tactics involve simple tools like pagers, ambiguous dialogue, and keen eyes.  There's no violence, or anything that forces us to suspend disbelief.  Some neat moments include Muir quickly glancing at key data, and somehow getting information with the vaguest of words.  Another is the CIA digging up his office, when Muir has no reasonable excuse for getting out of the interrogation.  This movie is never a bore, and is very exciting considering most of it centers around a conference room.In addition to the strong acting & directing, one of my favorite aspects of this movie is Harry Gregson-Williams's music.  His score includes some cool beats during the spy montages, and some powerful chords during those dramatic moments of betrayal and reflection.  Of all of the music I've heard from him (he's most famous for Michael Bay pictures ARMAGEDDON and THE ROCK), I easily call this his best work.I really dig this movie!  It's not perfect, and maybe it does borrow some aspects that other thrillers (and maybe Bruckheimer pictures) have done before.  But this is a top-notch film with a strong presentation that keeps it moving.  Because SPY GAME is energetic and focused at the same time, it's an exceptional film that warrants a purhcase!FINAL NOTE - The DVD features are all good.  There are some behind-the-scenes features that are worth checking out, and the Deleted Scenes (w/ or w/out Commentary) are actually good.  I usually don't like Deleted Scenes, because it's obvious why they shouldn't be there.  But these actually quite good, and would've added another layer that would've enhanced the story.

How a person could switch back and forth between making atmospheric, sexy thrillers (The Hunger, Beat the Devil, and I have the highest hopes for the upcoming Emma's War) to making intelligent action-suspense drama (Revenge, Enemy of the State, I have even higher hopes for his upcoming remake of Man on Fire) to putting out some of Hollywood's shallowest piles of reeking, unbearable crap (Top Gun, Days of Thunder, 48 Hours II) is beyond me. But he hits the mark enough to keep me coming back to see what he's going to do with any given movie.Spy Game, thankfully, falls into the ""intelligent"" section rather than the ""reeking"" section. (One wonders if this has to do with Scott finally throwing over Tom Cruise and wooing Brad Pitt as his eye candy.)  It was also entirely different than I expected it to be from the previews, usually a good thing.Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is on his last day with the CIA. He gets a tip from a friend in Hong Kong before going to work that one of his ex-operatives, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), has been arrested in China. For what, no one seems to know. Or so they say. As soon as he gets to work, he's pulled into a meeting about Bishop, China, and a whole lot of other things that make him wonder what's going on.All this, however, is a framework for Redford to sit in the meeting and spin tales, both to everyone else there and in his mind, going back over his ten-year relationship with Bishop, from the time they met in Vietnam to their last work together in Beirut, where the two of them split over Bishop meeting and falling in love with a woman (Catherine McCormack [Dancing at Lughnasa/Shadow of the Vampire]). It also offers us a look into Muir's conscience, as he, who has always counseled Bishop that once someone's caught, they should be left to hang, decides whether or not he's going to try and find a way to help Bishop out of the mess.Well-crafted, well-executed, but a bit jarring in places. One assumes a directors' cut would probably help with the continuity, as it does with so many films. What finally got released, though, is certainly worth a rental.

Here's a title on a contemporary moral theme and heroism under fire that, with extras, might be worth a second consideration.Brad Pitt and Robert Redford, the generationally separated Hollywood pretty boy look-a-likes, star in the great looking, mostly entertaining espionage action adventure ""SPY GAME"" directed by Tony Scott, Ridley's talented brother.  The commentary by Scott is especially entertaining as he talks about the two leads' diverse acting styles.  It seems Redford locks in his character early on and Pitt is looser and much more open to improvisation.

He has spent his life working for the CIA as a top-secret spy and has trained many of the young spies currently working for the CIA.  He has never let any of them get to him - until Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt).  Nathan and Tom parted on less than amicable terms, but when Nathan hears that Tom has been captured in China and is scheduled to be executed the next day for espionage, he knows he has to do something.  Nathan manages to maneuver himself into the group investigating Tom's capture and Nathan discovers that Tom was not on a CIA mission when he was captured - he went rogue.  While the committee pumps Nathan for information regarding Tom and their relationship, Nathan realizes that the CIA has no intention of claiming Tom and are planning on sacrificing him for a better relationship with China.  Nathan strings the committee on as long as he can to try and decide what he can do to help Tom because he knows exactly why Tom was in China - and Nathan is the one who gave her to them...Spy Game was a very suspenseful film that caught my attention from the first moment and didn't let go.  I thought that Robert Redford's portrayal of Nathan Muir was riveting and quite interesting in terms of his CIA involvement.  Brad Pitt was also very able in his role as Tom Bishop, a young spy struggling to maintain his distance from those people that he was spying on.  The supporting cast was also very good and they really fit into the parts well.  Director Tony Scott did a wonderful job in using flashbacks to show Nathan and Tom's relationship all the way from their beginnings in Vietnam to their falling out in the Near East.  Many directors who use flashbacks just end up disrupting the film and you feel like they don't really fit, but every flashback was used to illustrate a character trait in both Nathan and Tom so that, by the end, you knew exactly what motivated both characters and why they were doing what they did.  I also really liked the short time frame that the movie dealt with - one day!  I was really on pins and needles by the end to see what, if anything, was going to happen.

584463,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,B00005JKBB,Themis-Athena,"[14, 15]","I am not a great action movie fan - but I will watch almost anything associated with Robert Redford, whose ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""All the President's Men"" are among my all-time favorites; as is ""A River Runs Through It,"" his first collaboration with Brad Pitt. So, I figured, with these two in co-starring roles I couldn't really go wrong with ""Spy Game""; and I certainly wasn't disappointed.Told from a 1991 perspective - two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the CIA changed from an agency run by operatives with field experience to one run by ""suits"" - ""Spy Game"" flashes back to the cold war, when American politics' overriding goal was to outmaneuver the Russian-controlled communist block; although Middle Eastern politics eventually did add more complexity. (Shot before, but released after September 11, 2001, as director Tony Scott and producers Douglas Wick and Marc Abraham note on the DVD's commentary tracks, the WTC attack had some effect on the editing process). The story begins with CIA operative Tom Bishop (Pitt)'s capture during an unauthorized rescue attempt in a Chinese prison, resulting in his former supervisor Nathan Muir (Redford)'s summons, on his last day in office, to a meeting of the agency's top brass, for an account of their operations between 1975 (their first meeting in Vietnam) and 1985 (their last operation in Beirut). However, already tipped off to Bishop's capture by an old confidant in the U.S. embassy in Hong Kong, as Muir gives his report his suspicion is quickly confirmed that his information won't be used to save Bishop but to construe a reason to let the Chinese execute him. So it is left to Muir, several thousand miles away, to come to his former protege's aid; and in so doing, break all his rules of survival: Put away some money to retire in a warm spot, never touch that money for anyone, never risk your life or career for an outsider, and if an agent goes ""off the reservation"" (engages in an unauthorized operation), don't go after him trying to pull him out.Of course, most of this has been done before; in the aforementioned Redford movies, countless other celluloid tales of the past 50 years and the novels of writers who have built entire careers on this kind of material, from John le Carre to Tom Clancy and Frederick Forsyth. But ""Spy Game"" was directed by Tony Scott, who, like his brother Ridley, has already left his mark on the genre (see ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Crimson Tide"") and, with his arts and advertising background, understands that action movies are about visuals at least as much as about plot and character development: weak editing and camerawork will sink an action thriller as assuredly as weak acting. And Scott's direction is spot-on, in his choice of camera angles, movement and even coloring (providing every chapter with a unique color scheme), as well as his editing, so fast-paced that there are several details you only pick up on in your second or third viewing. Even in the largely static scenes in the CIA conference room, thanks to numerous small tricks, great dialogue and a cast of outstanding actors - including Stephen Dillane as Muir's intra-agency opponent Harker and Larry Bryggman as CIA vice-director Folger - Scott never loses the viewer's interest.I do have a few issues with ""Spy Game"" - leaving aside that, as in most spy flicks, there are some sequences where I have to suspend just a bit too much of my disbelief (like the East Berlin sequences of the operation used to set up American mole Anne Cathcart [Charlotte Rampling] and parts of Muir's rescue operation for Bishop), I think it is a pity that a director/producer team otherwise so focused on authenticity didn't realize how many people would remember Robert Redford's looks in films like the above-mentioned ones, i.e. from the mid-1970s, coinciding with this movie's Vietnam and Berlin episodes; for although Redford has definitely gained in class and authority with his growing number of facial lines, which well behoove Tom Bishop's mentor, arguably there should have been at least some visible age difference between Muir's 1975 and 1991 looks. And just as an aside, from a native Berliner: Guys, much as I applaud your choice to substitute nightly Budapest streets for those of cold-war East Berlin, you shouldn't also have filmed the rooftop scene there, because neither the city's overall look nor its topography pans out to those who actually knew Berlin then. (Not to mention the ""vopos""' obvious Hungarian accents and a few other details I won't go into here.)But overall this movie is certainly a cut above the rest of its class, due to great directorial work as much as that of Redford, Pitt and Catherine McCormack as Elizabeth Hadley, the woman who finally comes between them in Beirut: Redford as the inscrutable, controlling master spy - whose past is, unlike in the original screenplay, kept suitably ambiguous -, Pitt as the young gun, aptly codenamed ""Boy Scout,"" who is not above exploiting ""assets"" for an operation's sake but does fall in love with the wrong woman at last, and McCormack as the tough, no-frills activist whose feelings for Bishop ultimately endanger not only him but also herself. - Last but not least, Harry Gregson-Williams's soundtrack deserves special mention: With an excellent blend of classic rock tunes (Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way"" and Dire Straits' ""Brothers in Arms"" ... where are these on the soundtrack CD???) and a score alternating between middle eastern and Asian melodies, a boy soprano (Bishop & Hadley's love theme) and techno grooves, it is always in tune with the action and provides a perfect frame for the movie's voyage from Langley to Vietnam, Berlin, Beirut and China. This may not be one of film history's all-time greatest moments - but it is a well-crafted thriller and definitely worth watching if you're looking for some action.Also recommended:Three Days of the

However the Agency is considering writing the rogue agent off so as not to upset a delicate trade negotiation between the US and Red China.However to discover just what it is going on, the Agent is questioned by his superiors going over the rogue's career with vignettes in Vietnam, Berlin and Beirut while, at the same time, the agent ponders ways to save him in spite of CIA policy...........Nothing much to say. There may some Liberal/commie prop here (It IS Tony Scott) but since it IS Tony Scott that means the film is really just one very long very shallow music video with fast forwards, quick cutting and sweeping pans. The film is actually a spy video anthology with the Vietnam video then the Berlin video and the Beirut video with the Langley, Virginia video acting as the link. The dialogue is that empty sound bite variety in which no one really says anything and there is no content. The film looks great but has the echo of an empty dumpster.

Every scene has some form of annoying music which changes in an ad hoc fashion. There is no need for it and in the end cheapens the movie - I could not wait for it to end - it irritated me so much Such a pity - two good actor messed up by the sound effects people. I felt so relieved in the few parts that had no artificial background noise.,2,Could have be good but cheapened by pervasive and unnecessary and childish background music,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,502,"['Not', 'much', 'add', 'other', 'reviews', 'effects', 'good', 'acting', 'were', 'totally', 'spoilt', 'ever', 'present', 'irritating', 'music', 'background', 'scene', 'form', 'annoying', 'music', 'ad', 'hoc', 'fashion', 'need', 'end', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'end', 'irritated', 'so', 'much', 'pity', 'two', 'good', 'actor', 'messed', 'up', 'sound', 'effects', 'people', 'felt', 'so', 'relieved', 'few', 'parts', 'had', 'artificial', 'background', 'noise']",N/A
