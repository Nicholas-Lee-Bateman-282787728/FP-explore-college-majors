Do not watch this and just discount what happens as unattainable for all believers. God has work for all of us to do and Heidi Baker tells us just what we can do. I bought her book for myself and my daughters. We all need to be challenged to love like Jesus.,5,"Mama Heidi , the power and love of God",1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,371,"['documentary', 'really', 'challenged', 'faith', 'raised', 'expectations', 'power', 'God', 'love', 'earth', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'just', 'discount', 'what', 'unattainable', 'believers', 'God', 'work', 'do', 'Heidi', 'Baker', 'just', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'bought', 'book', 'myself', 'daughters', 'need', 'be', 'challenged', 'love', 'Jesus']",N/A
837256,A3IHRX17E6S4I2,B0002JAP54,Shane,"[32, 32]","This fantastic documentary follows the ministry of Heidi and Roland Baker, missionaries in war torn Mozambique. This is a fantastic visual to the book by the Baker's entitled Always Enough: God's Miraculous Provision Among the Poorest Children on Earth.This video introduces the viewer to the tough reality of life in Mozambique and the struggles that the people and especially children face there every day. It follows them in their local medical facilities and out onto the streets, taking care of children by feeding, clothing and educating them so that today's orphans will be tomorrows leaders. It also tells the story of Rolland and Heidi, how they came to Mozambique and what they do there. Heidi says in the video that it would be too overwhelming for her to do what God has called her to do in that country, so God told her to ""just love the one in front of you"" and He would do the rest.Not only is God's faithfulness glorified in this video, but it also inspires the viewer to compassion and Christ likeness. I really enjoyed this video and have shown it to many individuals and church groups. Iris ministries (The Baker's ministry name) continues to show the love of God in Mozambique to this day, maybe this video will inspire you and your church to visit or get involved in helping the poor and needy.",5,Loving the One in Front of You,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,1315,"['fantastic', 'documentary', 'ministry', 'Heidi', 'Roland', 'Baker', 'missionaries', 'war', 'torn', 'Mozambique', 'fantastic', 'visual', 'book', 'Baker', 'entitled', 'Always', 'Enough', 'God', 'Miraculous', 'Provision', 'Poorest', 'Children', 'Earth.This', 'video', 'viewer', 'tough', 'reality', 'life', 'Mozambique', 'struggles', 'people', 'especially', 'children', 'face', 'day', 'local', 'medical', 'facilities', 'streets', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'feeding', 'clothing', 'educating', 'today', 'orphans', 'will', 'be', 'tomorrows', 'leaders', 'also', 'story', 'Rolland', 'Heidi', 'how', 'came', 'Mozambique', 'what', 'do', 'there', 'Heidi', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'called', 'do', 'country', 'God', 'told', 'just', 'love', 'one', 'front', 'would', 'do', 'rest.Not', 'only', 'God', 'faithfulness', 'glorified', 'video', 'also', 'viewer', 'compassion', 'Christ', 'likeness', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'have', 'shown', 'many', 'individuals', 'church', 'groups', 'Iris', 'ministries', 'Baker', 'ministry', 'name', 'show', 'love', 'God', 'Mozambique', 'day', 'maybe', 'video', 'will', 'inspire', 'church', 'visit', 'get', 'involved', 'helping', 'poor', 'needy']",N/A
