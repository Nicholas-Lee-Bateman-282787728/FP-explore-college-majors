It stands up to one of Burt Reynold's best performances involving a crucial football game where all the inmates are heroes and all the guards are the villains.Paul Crew (Reynolds) is a retired pro football player.  He spends his time with wealthy women who shower all the amenities he may want in post-season life.  When he refuses to please his current girlfriend, he doesn't live up to her giggolo standards, so she isn't exactly accomodating when he wants to ""borrow"" her luxury sports car.  She sends the police, for which he sends on a chase, while guzzling a drink in the driver's seat.  Once apprehended, he must enter prison, for, above all things, assaulting two officers and resisting arrest.  There, he meets the warden (Albert) who gives him an offer he can't refuse:  To escape beatings and other maltreatment, he must assemble an inmate football team that will give the guard team a run for its money.  The motives aren't clear at first, but Albert plays well his patronizing swindler role.What makes 'The Longest Yard' so effective is the comraderie.  We get big lugs who are just big babies and a team that has color and heart.  Like 'Cool Hand Luke,' another classic, this prison film has us rooting for some pretty underhanded people, but the villainy of the status quo presented has us cheering for the bad guys.  With some excellent plot development as well as fine football scenes, 'The Longest Yard' is still a winner.",4,The Biggest Game,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,1480,"['Longest', 'Yard', 'movie', 'classic', 'up', 'one', 'Burt', 'Reynold', 'best', 'performances', 'involving', 'crucial', 'football', 'game', 'where', 'inmates', 'are', 'heroes', 'guards', 'are', 'villains.Paul', 'Crew', 'Reynolds', 'retired', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'time', 'wealthy', 'women', 'who', 'shower', 'amenities', 'may', 'want', 'post-season', 'life', 'When', 'please', 'current', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'giggolo', 'standards', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'accomodating', 'when', 'borrow', 'luxury', 'sports', 'car', 'police', 'chase', 'guzzling', 'drink', 'driver', 'seat', 'Once', 'apprehended', 'must', 'enter', 'prison', 'things', 'assaulting', 'two', 'officers', 'resisting', 'arrest', 'warden', 'Albert', 'who', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'escape', 'beatings', 'other', 'maltreatment', 'must', 'assemble', 'inmate', 'football', 'team', 'will', 'give', 'guard', 'team', 'run', 'money', 'motives', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'first', 'Albert', 'well', 'patronizing', 'swindler', 'role.What', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'so', 'effective', 'comraderie', 'get', 'big', 'lugs', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'big', 'babies', 'team', 'color', 'heart', ""'Cool"", 'Hand', 'Luke', 'classic', 'prison', 'film', 'rooting', 'pretty', 'underhanded', 'people', 'villainy', 'status', 'quo', 'presented', 'cheering', 'bad', 'guys', 'excellent', 'plot', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'football', 'scenes', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'still', 'winner']",N/A
222001,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,630021656X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","Beginnings prove once again a good place to start.  After watching the UK's ""Mean Machine"", I was upset that I never watched this original film before the other.  I wanted to see the roots, where Vinnie Jones got his inspiration, and how a film about soccer can relate to that about football. I was going in blind, so quickly I gobbled up this original, and I must say, Sandler didn't do Crewe justice.  ""The Longest Yard"", released in 1974, is a film full of gambling, racism, and dedicated stereotypes, but director Robert Aldrich takes a simple concept and really brings together a film that time may have forgotten about, but will remain a pinnacle sports film.  One of the issues that most of us have (and by most of us I mean ""me"") with sports film is that they are afraid to pull the bigger punches.  There are highly paid actors afraid of getting hurt, so a stunt double is brought in to take the heavy hits or to fall face-first into the mud.  That is not the case with this film, which I was happy continued with the Sandler debacle.  A tradition, it seems, starting with ""The Longest Yard"" is to use real professional athletes to play the parts of the inmates and the guards.  For me, this was a change of pace from your a-typical sports films, and for me, I welcomed the change with open arms.A film of this nature typically would start with me saying, ""I hate sports films"", but those words will not escape me this time.  I still feel the same about sports films, but in this instance, Reynolds coupled with James Hampton (giving the best performance of Caretaker), and the sinister Captain Knauer (played by Ed Lauter) just meshed extremely well that even the most pessimistic of sports cinema viewers can enjoy this golden nugget from a creative era of film.  I liked the confident Reynolds that had already come to grips with his inner-demons that nothing seemed to matter to him in his main life, so going to prison helped him find himself.  I loved this dynamic because in most films it is the polar opposite.  Getting out of prison means you discover yourself, not the other way.  Also, I never felt trapped.  This is tough to do with a prison film because the walls are constantly reminding you where you are, but in fact, Aldrich and his cast brought the prison to life, giving it a character all of its own.  Reynolds was perfect for this role.  He embodied the lightness of the scenes, while bringing a professional level of acting to the role.  He was funny, but not juvenile funny, but sophisticated funny.  He controlled his scenes, giving those around him a chance to create moments of their own.  Not to go too off topic, but Sandler made his version a ""Sandler movie"", while with the original - it was obviously an ensemble piece.  Everyone fell into their roles with ease, such as Eddie Albert as Warden Hazen, who demonstrated a level of power while revealing his weaknesses.  He was evil, but didn't need the slicked hair or looming lights.  We knew what he could do, what he had done, and what he was willing to do to win.  The final scene will didn't need music to intensify, Albert brought it all himself.  The same, as stated before, can be said for Lauter who embodies evil with Knauer.  Without drooling too heavily on myself, everyone was phenomenal in this film - the actors were assembled with a delicate stick which allowed each to build this cult film.Again, typically I would be yelling about how long the game actually took to complete at the end.  When sports films take 47 minutes for the game itself, one worries that character development goes to the wayside.  This is not the case here.  Robert Aldrich gives us plenty of moments of fresh air prior to the epic football game to build up to the sad moments and the climactic moments.  It is pure cane-sugar watching him take us from character to character, giving us just small inch after small inch, until the final moments.  See - I am drooling quite a bit.  Absolutely, there were some dull moments to this film - the game was lengthy, but without complaining I would say that it was essential to the story.  While I loved the the major players, when it came to the game, I did get lost on whom was whom during the heated battle.  Maybe it was just me, but I needed stronger characters during the game.  I wanted to make sure that I could identify who was who by some characteristic - but I think this was just because of the time difference.  Sandler's version you knew who was who because it was modern players - my knowledge of sports is weak, so I had trouble following the big names in the game.  That isn't to say that it detracted too much from the film, but for me it was a bit annoying.The only aspect that I have to criticize is the way the game was filmed.  The editing was sharp, hey - it won an Oscar, but when the editor uses boxes to make the game seem more exciting, I was just distracted further from the game.  I could see the reason to bring some style to the game, but the boxes, different pans, and multi-angles just felt clich&eacute; and randomly inserted to keep the attention of the viewers.  The game was strong enough, it didn't need this snappy ""special effects"" to strengthen it.  It made me anxious to watch it, kinda epileptic if further questions need to be asked.  It just didn't fit.  It felt like someone else took control and created the environment where the beginning didn't match the ending.  If that style of filmmaking was used during all the practices, than maybe it would have been considered annoying, but it would have been consistent.  Choppy consistency - maybe that is my point here.  Either way, it wasn't a big compliant, just an area I had trouble connecting myself to.Overall, I surprise myself when saying this, but I liked ""The Longest Yard"".  It is the foundation for the ""Mean Machine"" and (grumble), the Sandler remake.  I am impressed by the power of the characters and how well Reynolds took this role and played with it.  The opening sequence solidified his character, and up until the ending he never let me go.  Who couldn't enjoy Reynolds demolishing a car than going to get a drink afterwards.  Hysterical.  Aldrich was a perfect fit for this film, and it surprised me that the producer of the ""Godfather"" would choose this as his next project - but seeing the final product, it doesn't surprise me.  It was a well balanced film of both comedy and a slice of drama.  It wasn't childish humor, but something that one could laugh at a second time.  He controlled what could have been a chaotic film by allowing each to grow on their own to define themselves.  The unique perspective of using athletes and actors was creative for its time, giving us the realism of the game before our eyes.  Aside from the choppy editing near the end, I thought this was a perfect balance between sports and comedy.Mean Machine!

222003,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630021656X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","If you're like me, you saw the Adam Sandler remake long before you saw this original 1974 film.  I rather dislike sports and so this movie never appealed to me, but I did see the Sandler remake for some odd reason and actually kind of enjoyed it to an extent (less crude than his usual fare and plenty of landed gags) so I decided to give this Reynolds film a go.  Sadly, this doesn't entirely work and winds up being a moderate success that could have been better.I know that many won't agree with me, but it is my opinion you are reading, so take that with however many grains of salt you deem necessary.I wouldn't say that I didn't like this film or that Sandler's remake was better, since they both are lacking in certain areas, but it is safe to say that they are very different animals altogether.  This film is far darker and less comedic than the remake.  I actually thought this was supposed to be a comedy (that is how it is billed and it is how it was nominated at the Globes back in `74) but I honestly didn't find it too funny, and when it tried to be humorous it kind of failed there.  I also found that the actual football game was rather dull to be honest.  It just didn't burst with excitement and kind of felt lazy.  Reynolds doesn't really give his performance any true heft, and most of the characters come across like mere caricatures, even Eddie Albert, who somehow managed a Golden Globe nomination for his stereotypical performance (which isn't bad but isn't anything remotely special).  I didn't find any real character development, and to be honest they all kind of merged into one giant unlikable character that's whole purpose was to be mean and hurt others.  Even Reynolds character is far from likable (he is arrested for beating up his girlfriend and wrecking her car), and he's the guy we are supposed to root for.At the end of the day this is a fun romp at times but nothing remarkable.  It has it's rabid fans, as does any B-Movie with a big name star, but at the end of the day this is nothing more than a popcorn muncher that misses about as many times as it hits.And LOL at Bernadette Peters going full Frankenstein's wife for this role.",2,I guess you could call this a fumble?,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,2174,"[""'re"", 'saw', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'remake', 'long', 'saw', 'original', '1974', 'film', 'rather', 'dislike', 'sports', 'so', 'movie', 'never', 'appealed', 'did', 'see', 'Sandler', 'remake', 'odd', 'reason', 'actually', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'extent', 'less', 'crude', 'usual', 'fare', 'plenty', 'landed', 'gags', 'decided', 'give', 'Reynolds', 'film', 'go', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'work', 'up', 'being', 'moderate', 'success', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.I', 'know', 'many', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'opinion', 'are', 'reading', 'so', 'take', 'however', 'many', 'grains', 'salt', 'deem', 'necessary.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'Sandler', 'remake', 'was', 'better', 'are', 'lacking', 'certain', 'areas', 'safe', 'say', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'animals', 'altogether', 'film', 'far', 'darker', 'less', 'comedic', 'remake', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'how', 'billed', 'how', 'was', 'nominated', 'Globes', 'back', '74', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'funny', 'when', 'tried', 'be', 'humorous', 'kind', 'failed', 'also', 'found', 'actual', 'football', 'game', 'was', 'rather', 'dull', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'burst', 'excitement', 'kind', 'felt', 'lazy', 'Reynolds', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'performance', 'true', 'heft', 'most', 'characters', 'come', 'mere', 'caricatures', 'even', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'stereotypical', 'performance', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'anything', 'remotely', 'special', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'be', 'honest', 'kind', 'merged', 'one', 'giant', 'unlikable', 'character', 'whole', 'purpose', 'was', 'be', 'mean', 'hurt', 'others', 'Even', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'far', 'likable', 'arrested', 'beating', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'wrecking', 'car', 'guy', 'are', 'supposed', 'root', 'for.At', 'end', 'day', 'fun', 'romp', 'times', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'rabid', 'fans', 'B-Movie', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'end', 'day', 'nothing', 'more', 'popcorn', 'muncher', 'as', 'many', 'times', 'LOL', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'going', 'full', 'Frankenstein', 'wife', 'role']",N/A

222007,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,630021656X,David E. Levine,"[3, 4]","I am reviewing this dvd a few days after both co-star Eddie Albert died and the remake, staring Adam Sandler, opened in theaters. This movie is basically a bunch of formulas, strung together, which seem to work. There is the ""Bad News Bears"" underdog element. There is the bad guy (in the guise of a sadisitic prison guard captain) who turns out to be not so bad after all. There is the star (Burt Reynolds) who at the beginning of the movie is totally unlikable but who ends up as the hero we root heartily for. In spite of the predictability, the movie works and is entertaining.The movie starts with Paul Crewe (Reynolds character) getting arrested and he ceratinly deserved to be, having abused a woman who was his lover, stolen her car, gone on a high speed chase and resisted arrest. Anyone watching would be rooting against him at that point. Crewe is a washed up former quarterback who left football in disgrace, having shaved points in an NFL game. The warden of the prison, played by Eddie Albert, wants Crewe to coach the prison's semi pro football team composed of prison guards. Meanwhile, if he doesn't, life will get very uncomfortable for him (hmmm, another formula). He is squeezed on the other end since the mean captain happens to be the present coach and will make life tough if Crewe , in fact, agrees to coach. Ultimately, Crewe talks the warden in letting him put together a team of inmates so that the semi pro team can have a tuneup before facing their real competition.In putting together the team, all sorts of characters and misfits are recruited, adding to the Bad News Bears underdog element. Crewe is the quarterback and as the game unfolds, the inmates are putting on a surprisingly good showing, much to the consternation of the warden who tries to interfere. Anyway, being formulaic, you can guess how the movie ends. All in all, the movie is fun and over the years, has become something of a classic of its genre.",4,All the formulas work,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1948,"['am', 'reviewing', 'dvd', 'few', 'days', 'co-star', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'died', 'remake', 'staring', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'opened', 'theaters', 'movie', 'basically', 'bunch', 'formulas', 'strung', 'together', 'seem', 'work', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'underdog', 'element', 'bad', 'guy', 'guise', 'sadisitic', 'prison', 'guard', 'captain', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'star', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'beginning', 'movie', 'totally', 'unlikable', 'who', 'up', 'hero', 'root', 'heartily', 'spite', 'predictability', 'movie', 'works', 'entertaining.The', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'getting', 'arrested', 'ceratinly', 'deserved', 'be', 'having', 'abused', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'lover', 'stolen', 'car', 'gone', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'resisted', 'arrest', 'Anyone', 'watching', 'would', 'be', 'rooting', 'point', 'Crewe', 'washed', 'up', 'former', 'quarterback', 'who', 'left', 'football', 'disgrace', 'having', 'shaved', 'points', 'NFL', 'game', 'warden', 'prison', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Crewe', 'coach', 'prison', 'semi', 'pro', 'football', 'team', 'composed', 'prison', 'guards', 'Meanwhile', ""n't"", 'life', 'will', 'get', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'hmmm', 'formula', 'squeezed', 'other', 'end', 'mean', 'captain', 'be', 'present', 'coach', 'will', 'make', 'life', 'tough', 'Crewe', 'fact', 'coach', 'Ultimately', 'Crewe', 'warden', 'letting', 'put', 'together', 'team', 'inmates', 'semi', 'pro', 'team', 'can', 'have', 'tuneup', 'facing', 'real', 'competition.In', 'putting', 'together', 'team', 'sorts', 'characters', 'misfits', 'are', 'recruited', 'adding', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'underdog', 'element', 'Crewe', 'quarterback', 'game', 'inmates', 'are', 'putting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'showing', 'much', 'consternation', 'warden', 'who', 'interfere', 'Anyway', 'being', 'formulaic', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'movie', 'movie', 'fun', 'years', 'become', 'something', 'classic', 'genre']",N/A

I liked the film a lot more four decades ago, maybe because its appeal was aimed at teen-agers. This time around, some scenes held my attention but too many  others bored me.The domestic violence in THE LONGEST YARD's opening disturbs me. What is the point?

222025,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,630021656X,Joe Sherry,"[10, 15]","Often billed as a football comedy, I'm not sure The Longest Yard really is one. Starring a young Burt Reynolds, The Longest Yard is, simply, a good movie. Reynolds is Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe, a former NFL star quarterback who has been out of the game for eight years. He's not a very good man. He is selfish, treats a woman poorly (who is also treating him poorly when we meet her), drives drunk, wrecks her car, assaults a police officer, and doesn't really take anything seriously. Crewe is sentenced to prison where the warden (Eddie Albert) wants Crewe to help coach his semi-pro football team and help with the championship.To make a long story short Crewe declines, gets put on a nasty work detail and in the end has to put together a football team made up of inmates to give the warden's team a proper warm-up game before their season starts. Crewe has ideas on what exactly he should be doing and how to best protect himself and proceeds to put together a team of the nastiest, toughest inmates in the prison. The joke will be on the warden because some of the guards are on the warden's team and the inmates are out to hurt them.There are moments of humor as Crewe cracks wise as often as he can and there is some situational comedy with the football, but this is not a terribly funny movie. It's just a well told, well acted story. The backstory of Crewe having shaved points off of a football game comes into play several times in the movie and everyone here does an excellent job making the characters real and raw, and the action believable yet entertaining. It is easy to see why Hollywood wanted to remake this movie, but that is another topic best left for another time.Despite being a person who loves to watch movies, my experience with Burt Reynolds is rather limited. I loved his performance in Boogie Nights, but otherwise I only know him from The Cannonball Run and Smokey and the Bandit. This is unfortunate because Reynolds certainly can be a good actor and he is quite good here in The Longest Yard. Fans of movies and football movies need to see this one.

Since Reynolds, who is an  ex-quarterback in the pros, lets Albert enlist his help to get his team of  correctional officers--referred to throughout the movie, of course, as  &quot;guards&quot;--a championship.Of course the inmates end up  playing the officers, who are depicted as brutes, as they always are by  Hollywood, and after losing, and then regaining the convicts' trust,  Reynolds, with great skill and courage, and despite Albert's threat to  &quot;throw away the key,&quot; beats the prison officers and thereby makes  everyone happy except Eddie Albert and the vicious, brutish  &quot;guards.&quot;The movie works well as entertainment, and will  please everyone.

222030,A1OBJ2263JCK5,630021656X,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[13, 14]","In the 1970's, there was a small genre of movies, that the studios released, that could best be termed, football comedies. These were a series of films that sort of aped the spirit of Jim Bouton's best selling baseball book, ""Ball Four"" about the rowdy and scatalogical antics of modern day pro-athletes. Most movie fans consider three films to be the best of this genre. They include ""North Dallas Fourty"", ""Semi-Tough"" and of course ""The Longest Yard"". When it comes to ""North Dallas Fourty"", I have to be truthful and admit that I've never seen it. I really can't make an informed opinion about it. But,""Semi-Tough really is a very funny film comedy. But let's face it...it's not really about football. It's more of a satire of the 'self-help/feel good' movements (such as E.S.T.) that were all the rage in the 1970's. That leaves, what I like to think of as the gold standard of football movie comedies, ""The Longest Yard"". This hilarious film is basically M*A*S*H* on steroids. A group of people trapped in a situation trying to relieve their boredom & frustrations through off-color jokes, rowdy antics and a love for football (for those who have never seen it, the film, M*A*S*H* ends in a humourously rowdy, football game). ""The Longest Yard"" is about Paul Crewe (Burt Reynolds) a former superstar, pro quarterback, who is living life as a disgraced, has-been. After a drunken fight with his wealthy girlfriend and a wild police chase in a stolen Mazardi, he finds himself looking at eighteen months of hard time in a Florida correctional facility. But this isn't just any prison. Apparently both the guards, the inmates and especially the nefarious Warden (Eddie Albert) take their football, waaaayyyy to seriously! The Warden hatches a plan for Crewe to put together and play with a team of felons in a tune-up game against his own semi-pro team made up of the brutally, sadistic guards. What starts out as a supposedly, friendly (and very funny) game soon devolves into a brutal, grudge match in which the Warden attempts to humiliate the Cons and send a message to the rest of the prison population. It's up to Crewe to keep this from happening. This is a great film with a plot (and hard hitting, realistic game), that gets the viewer really involved. I mean what film do you know, where the good guys are unrepented hard core felons (refered to by the hypocritical guards as ""scum of the Earth"") and we want to root for them? The film is helmed by an excellent cast playing interesting characters. Burt Reynolds plays a man, who when under presure finally learns, that there is more to life than just thinking about himself. This is probably Reynold's best acting job in any of his film comedies (he only breaks himself up once). His only better work has been in dramas such as ""Deliverance"" & ""Boogie Nights"". Eddie Albert is also great as the evil Warden, who on one hand, publicly spouts speeches about the ""All-American"" values and virtues of the game of football, but is privately more than willing to vindictively lie and cheat, all in the name of winning. Other standouts in the cast include Robert Tessier as Shockner, a silent, Karate chopping, psychopath and 7'2"" Richard Kiel (in a pre James Bond role) as a giant, violent prisoner, who hilariously dosn't seem to know his own strength. Also look for Bernadette Peters in a brief, sexy cameo (and a huge B-52 hairdo) as the Warden's amorous secretary. If you like football movies or just plain gut-busting, funny movie comedies (or both) than get ""The Longest Yard""! Great movie! Highly recommended!",5,"""Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

222034,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630021656X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 17]","I want to make the argument that ""The Longest Yard"" is an important film in the history of the movies because this 1974 comedy represents the point in cinematic history where a guy getting hit between the legs was funny for the last time. To be specific it was the moment in the film where it happened for the second time, which was even funnier than the first time it had happened, which was just a minute earlier in the movie. Ever since then I have not found these scenes to be anywhere near as funny because all such efforts are just pale imitations of what happens here.""The Longest Yard"" is solid B-movie material from start to finish. Burt Reynolds is Paul Crewe, a former pro quarterback who was banned from the sport for shaving points and ended up in prison for having some fun with the cops joy riding. In a nice example of casting against type Eddie Albert is the sadistic warden who is quite proud of the football team he has put together from the prison guards. So he decides that Crewe should put together a team from the prisoners for a friendly little game of football. Crewe is inclined not to be accommodating, but the warden, no doubt sensing a failure to communicate, persuades the ex-jock to get with the game plan.We have to go through some rather trite and tired routines as Crewe puts together his team just so we can get to the fun part of the movie, which is the big football game. Obviously the cons are playing for self-respect and if the warden is stupid enough to give them the opportunity to pay back the guards for their brutal treatment under the guise of a football game, then we should just enjoy the fun. The set up might be stupid, but the game itself is one of the better staged pigskin competitions we have seen in a movie to date. Besides, the Mean Machine uses the drop kick, which I have always wanted to see ever since I read about it in ""Gil Thorp"" way back when. Certainly director Robert Aldrich takes the time to play the came and he makes excellent use of the split-screen to avoid having to constantly cut between the action on the field and the drama on the sidelines.Reynolds is certainly the star of the film (he tells his team, ""The most important thing to remember is: to protect your quarterback. ME!""), and the ex-Florida State football player certainly makes for a believable jock on the field (hey, the guy was drafted by the Baltimore Colts), while Albert clearly relishes the chance to forget all about Eva Gabor and have fun with the dark side. ""Iron"" Mike Conrad, before he became a cult figure as Sgt. Esterhaus on ""Hill Street Blues,"" has a memorable turn as Nate Scarboro, one of the cons whose knees are not as strong as his heart so he has to settle for being the coach of the Mean Machine. Ed Lauter is Captain Knauer, the head of the guards, who manages not to be a total jerk about what is going on in the end as the film goes for one last over the top moment at the end.Not to be mistaken for high art, ""The Longest Yard"" is a party film, perfect when you are in the mood for a little football. It was actually up for an Oscar for Best Film Editing (Michael Luciano), undoubtedly for that split screen work, and even won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical/Comedy (beating out ""The Front Page,"" ""Harry and Tonto,"" ""The Little Prince"" and ""The Three Musketeers""). Having already been made as a soccer (the other ""football"" movie, ""Mean Machine""), ""The Longest Yard"" is about to be released with Adam Sandler and James Cromwell squaring off (Burt Reynolds is along for the ride as Coach Nate Scarboro). I wonder if Brian Bosworth played ""Kill the Star"" with Sandler the way Ray Nitschke did with Reynolds in the original. There could be some very interesting outtakes on that DVD down the road.",4,Quick!

Scanning all the video stores and shops in Cape Town to try and find a copy. Unfortunately to no avail.

Lets be honest, you are not going to get ""Matrix"" style footage, no overly impressive slow-mo's or thumping music - but take it for what Robert Aldrich had hoped we would. A cleverly made action-comedy that offers a great way to escape for 2 hours. The film has under-tones of the Dirty Dozen coming through - recruiting a bunch of misfits for an all out spectacular mission. In this case, turning the tables on the guards and delivering some of the punishment that has been inflicted on them for the full duration of their sentences. All in all - still a magnificent film. 31 years ago - it must have been an epic. And Burt - well he's always been great to watch!!!

222051,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,630021656X,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","Well on the eve of the remake being released it's time to look back at one of the classic movies of the 1970's, The Longest Yard.  Burt Reynolds was at his peak in the mid-1970's with a string of hits and reigned as Hollywood's box-office king.  This movie had a stellar supporting cast which helped make it one of the great sports movies of all time.Reynolds is Paul ""wrecking"" Crewe, a former pro quarterback who is sent to a Georgia prison after leading police on a drunken car chase.  Crewe finds himself ostracized from his fellow inmates because of his ""star"" status but eventually befriends Caretaker (James Hampton of F-Troop) and an elderly inmate named Pop.  Eddie Albert (of Green Acres fame) is Warden Hazen, a typical evil prison warden who has a semi-pro football team made up of the prison guards that he is very proud of.The Warden forces Crewe to put together a football team of inmates to play his guards in a scrimmage game.  Crewe is reluctant and just wants to do his time but when the Warden threatens to make his time very tough, Crewe relents and he and Caretaker begin trying to find players.  At first Crewe is stuck with a bunch of stiffs, partly because the black inmates refuse to play until one named Granville breaks the ice and decides to play.  Crewe then enlists the services of several ""specialists"" including 7' 2"" tall Richard Kiel playing a weightlifter named Samson, and the baddest guy in the joint, Connie Shokner, played by one of the great screen heavies of the 1970's, Robert Tessier.  One note is that the Indian inmate was played by Sonny Sixkiller who was a well known QB at the University of Washington in the early 1970's and still holds several passing records.With Caretaker's help they manage to steal the guard's personal medical records to find out which have had previous injuries to take advantage of and also steal game uniforms.  The guard team is led by Guard Captain Knauer (Ed Lauter) and former NFL great Ray Nitschke playing a guard named Bodanski.  This all culminates in the big game where Crewe is forced to make a VERY big decision about how well he wants to play in the game.The remake of The Longest Yard is going to have some very big shoes to fill.  They appear to have done a great job on the supporting cast which includes wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bill Goldberg and kevin Nash along with 7' tall Indian power lifter Dalip Singh, and Bob Sapp to go along with actual actors Chris Rock, James Cromwell and David Patrick Kelly who people may remember as the crazy gang leader in the cult film ""The Warriors"".This special edition DVD was a welcome additon with it's Burt Reynolds commentary as well as the making of featurettes.

In 21st Century U.S.A., I think we've forgotten how tough and horrible prisons used to be.  Prisoners back then didn't have the amenities and luxuries that most prisoners have nowadays.  In the 1970s people didn't want to go to prison, especially those who had already been there.  Remembering the historical setting, helps put the original THE LONGEST YARD into perspective.Burt Reynolds stars in the film as Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe a former NFL star quarterback who was banned from the game for life after he was caught shaving points.  Crewe is not a high-quality individual and he would not have made a good role model.  He's a very selfish person who views women solely as objects for his personal desires and to sponge money out of.  After a drunken argument with his girlfriend, Crewe goes on a driving rampage where that ends with him assaulting a police officer and wrecking his girlfriend's car, a Mazardi.  He's sentenced to prison where the warden (Eddie Albert) wants Crewe to coach his semi-pro guard football team and help them win the championship.  But Crewe has never been one to keep in line and refuses, besides the guards were going to kill him if he took the job.  Eventually Crewe is put in charge of putting together a group of inmates that are going to play the warden's team in an exhibition game.  The warden's team is expected to slaughter the inmates Mean Machine, but for the inmates all they want to do is play a great game and maybe knock some of the guards around.  As for Crewe, the game becomes a crisis of conscience for him: he's offered parole if he throws the game, but he's gotten to like his teammates and he knows how much it means to them.The movie has a good plot and is well acted.  Reynolds and Albert give fine performances and Bernadette Peters has a small role as a sizzling secretary that freely gives Crewe some favors.As mentioned before, THE LONGEST YARD is often billed as a comedy, but it's not.  It's a serious drama with comical elements laced throughout.  People get beat up and even killed.  Prison, like life, can be a really tough place.  Yet, there's always hope because on the football field, everyone's an equal.",4,"Prison, Football, and Life.",1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,2337,"['LONGEST', 'YARD', 'usually', 'billed', 'football', 'comedy', 'movie', 'actually', 'drama', 'filled', 'comic', 'moments', 'centered', 'very', 'unique', 'football', 'game', '21st', 'Century', 'U.S.A.', 'think', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'tough', 'horrible', 'prisons', 'used', 'be', 'Prisoners', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'amenities', 'luxuries', 'most', 'prisoners', 'have', 'nowadays', '1970s', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'prison', 'especially', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'there', 'Remembering', 'historical', 'setting', 'put', 'original', 'THE', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'perspective.Burt', 'Reynolds', 'stars', 'film', 'Paul', 'Wrecking', 'Crewe', 'former', 'NFL', 'star', 'quarterback', 'who', 'was', 'banned', 'game', 'life', 'was', 'caught', 'shaving', 'points', 'Crewe', 'not', 'high-quality', 'individual', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'very', 'selfish', 'person', 'who', 'women', 'solely', 'objects', 'personal', 'desires', 'sponge', 'money', 'drunken', 'argument', 'girlfriend', 'Crewe', 'driving', 'rampage', 'where', 'assaulting', 'police', 'officer', 'wrecking', 'girlfriend', 'car', 'Mazardi', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'where', 'warden', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Crewe', 'coach', 'semi-pro', 'guard', 'football', 'team', 'help', 'win', 'championship', 'Crewe', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'keep', 'line', 'refuses', 'guards', 'were', 'going', 'kill', 'took', 'job', 'Eventually', 'Crewe', 'put', 'charge', 'putting', 'together', 'group', 'inmates', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'warden', 'team', 'exhibition', 'game', 'warden', 'team', 'expected', 'slaughter', 'inmates', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'inmates', 'want', 'do', 'play', 'great', 'game', 'maybe', 'knock', 'guards', 'around', 'Crewe', 'game', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'offered', 'parole', 'game', 'gotten', 'like', 'teammates', 'how', 'much', 'them.The', 'movie', 'good', 'plot', 'well', 'acted', 'Reynolds', 'Albert', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'small', 'role', 'sizzling', 'secretary', 'freely', 'Crewe', 'favors.As', 'mentioned', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'often', 'billed', 'comedy', 'not', 'serious', 'drama', 'comical', 'elements', 'laced', 'People', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'even', 'killed', 'Prison', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'tough', 'place', 'always', 'hope', 'football', 'field', 'everyone', 'equal']",N/A
222053,AQP1VPK16SVWM,630021656X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[23, 25]","Robert Aldrich's greatest gift as a film director was his ability to show bad boys and nonconformists in such a sympathetic light. ""The Longest Yard"" features Reynolds before he traded on his bad boyish charm in all his film roles. Paul Crewe (Burt Reynolds) is a former bad boy football player who ends up in prison for ""stealing"" his girlfriend's car. His life has fallen apart since he was banned from the game for shaving points.Crewe is pressured by the Warden (Eddie Albert)to coach the guards' semi-pro team to earn a national title. When he refuses (out of preservation for his own skin) Crewe must lead the team of prisoners (called ""The Mean Machine"") against the guards in an exhibition game where the prisoners are expected to lose. Crewe has a couple of surprises in store for the Warden. The good news about this remake is that it prompted the studio to re-release this classic film. I have no idea if the remake is any good as of yet but we do have the classic original in top form.An exceptionally nice transfer from Paramount, ""The Longest Yard"" has some minor issues with grain (that's not a flaw in the transfer I might add but it can be minimized during the transfer or made much, much worse) but that's probably due to the type of film and its age. The image quality is exceptionally good with such robust colors you can almost feel the humidity. The mono sound is a bit flat but with clear dialogue.Three featurettes are highlights of this re-release. ""Doing Time"" features Reynolds and Ruddy discussing the making of the movie. The fact that Reynolds played college ball was an advantage for him in the role. Sports Illustrated writer Michael Silver discusses how nasty Paul Crewe is yet we forgive him because he's so funny and charming. The sports writers interviewed for the disc point out that watching Reynolds on the field its clear that he played college ball. ""Unleashing The Mean Machine"" we hear from a variety of pro players and sports writers discussing what makes ""The Longest Yard"" the best football movie ever made. Ruddy points out how he managed to convince Jimmy Carter (governor at the time of Georgia). Reynolds comments on his first meeting with Carter. The soon-to-be President of the United States told Reynolds that if Reynolds was taken prisoner, ""if they take you hostage I will take your place gladly."" Aldrich turned to Reynolds after and told him, ""this man will be President some day. He's lying through his teeth beautifully"".A new and fun commentary track with producer Albert S. Ruddy (""The Godfather"") and star Burt Reynolds discussing the making of the movie is a highlight of this classic 1974 film. Shot on location Reynolds in the South, Reynolds comments frequently about the difficult working conditions shooting in the swamp. He never knew when and if they might have a cottonmouth show up. Reynolds and many of the actors actually stayed at the former prison where they shot the film. Reynolds points out the various former pro and college football players that appear in the film. They discuss the prep for shooting the big game and how they pulled the illusion together for this film.A classic film gets a classy presentation on DVD. An excellent commentary track by Reynolds and Ruddy are a highlight of this terrific reissue on DVD. Two very good featurettes on the making of the movie and one where pros and writers comment on reality of what you see in the film.",5,The Mean Machine is meaner than ever,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,3433,"['Robert', 'Aldrich', 'greatest', 'gift', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'ability', 'show', 'bad', 'boys', 'nonconformists', 'such', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Reynolds', 'traded', 'bad', 'boyish', 'charm', 'film', 'roles', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'former', 'bad', 'boy', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'up', 'prison', 'stealing', 'girlfriend', 'car', 'life', 'fallen', 'apart', 'was', 'banned', 'game', 'shaving', 'points.Crewe', 'pressured', 'Warden', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'coach', 'guards', 'semi-pro', 'team', 'earn', 'national', 'title', 'When', 'preservation', 'own', 'skin', 'Crewe', 'must', 'lead', 'team', 'prisoners', 'called', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'guards', 'exhibition', 'game', 'where', 'prisoners', 'are', 'expected', 'lose', 'Crewe', 'couple', 'surprises', 'store', 'Warden', 'good', 'news', 'remake', 'prompted', 'studio', 're-release', 'classic', 'film', 'have', 'idea', 'remake', 'good', 'yet', 'do', 'have', 'classic', 'original', 'top', 'form.An', 'exceptionally', 'nice', 'transfer', 'Paramount', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'minor', 'issues', 'grain', 'not', 'flaw', 'transfer', 'might', 'add', 'can', 'be', 'minimized', 'transfer', 'made', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'probably', 'due', 'type', 'film', 'age', 'image', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'such', 'robust', 'colors', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'humidity', 'mono', 'sound', 'bit', 'flat', 'clear', 'dialogue.Three', 'featurettes', 'are', 'highlights', 're-release', 'Doing', 'Time', 'features', 'Reynolds', 'Ruddy', 'discussing', 'making', 'movie', 'fact', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'college', 'ball', 'was', 'advantage', 'role', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Silver', 'how', 'nasty', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'yet', 'forgive', 'so', 'funny', 'charming', 'sports', 'writers', 'interviewed', 'disc', 'point', 'out', 'watching', 'Reynolds', 'field', 'clear', 'played', 'college', 'ball', 'Unleashing', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'hear', 'variety', 'pro', 'players', 'sports', 'writers', 'discussing', 'what', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'best', 'football', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Ruddy', 'out', 'how', 'managed', 'convince', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'governor', 'time', 'Georgia', 'Reynolds', 'comments', 'first', 'meeting', 'Carter', 'soon-to-be', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'told', 'Reynolds', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'take', 'hostage', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'gladly', 'Aldrich', 'turned', 'Reynolds', 'told', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'President', 'day', 'lying', 'teeth', 'beautifully', '.A', 'new', 'fun', 'commentary', 'track', 'producer', 'Albert', 'S.', 'Ruddy', 'Godfather', 'star', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'discussing', 'making', 'movie', 'highlight', 'classic', '1974', 'film', 'Shot', 'location', 'Reynolds', 'South', 'Reynolds', 'comments', 'frequently', 'difficult', 'working', 'conditions', 'shooting', 'swamp', 'never', 'knew', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'cottonmouth', 'show', 'up', 'Reynolds', 'many', 'actors', 'actually', 'stayed', 'former', 'prison', 'where', 'shot', 'film', 'Reynolds', 'out', 'various', 'former', 'pro', 'college', 'football', 'players', 'appear', 'film', 'discuss', 'prep', 'shooting', 'big', 'game', 'how', 'pulled', 'illusion', 'together', 'film.A', 'classic', 'film', 'classy', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track', 'Reynolds', 'Ruddy', 'are', 'highlight', 'terrific', 'reissue', 'DVD', 'Two', 'very', 'good', 'featurettes', 'making', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'pros', 'writers', 'comment', 'reality', 'what', 'see', 'film']",N/A

His arrest catches the eye of a warden at one of the state pens. He could use a consultant for his semi-pro guards football team.  So in arrives Crew, and the warden reviels his plans for him. He doesn't play ball at first, but eventually reconsiders after some hard swamp labor. Instead of being a consultant, he offers an alternative plan, a warm up game, guards vrs prisoners...and the warden takes it.  And the movie goes off from their. Decent humor, seems toned down as compared to todays movies, but on par with the era. One thing I noticed, their really is no soundtrack of music playing over the movie, and its amazing how much adding a song or melody can enhance the emotion or moments.
