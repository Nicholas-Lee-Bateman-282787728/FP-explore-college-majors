1097213,A35I219IASBGKV,B000UX6TIY,"Edward ""Beatleddie""","[9, 11]","Of course this is a great show, but my comment is more about DVD releases and Amazon. I've figured out along with others, it is best to wait until these complete box sets comes out and skip buying individual seasons. I also had Dr. Katz Season 1 and 2, and sold them sealed over the summer, along with my sealed Seinfelds, Andy Griffiths, King of Queens and Frasier, which all had Complete Series Sets come out in 2007. Most of the time the sets are cheaper than buying them individually. I bought the Dr. Katz Complete Series a month ago from Amazon when it was offered for $52.00. Since that time it increased to $84.00, and now it is $118.00. Amazon bounces the price around quite a bit on their DVDs so keep checking back. I saw Andy Griffith Series go from $140.00 to $205.00 then back to $140.00. I assume it is an availablility thing. I have learned to relax a bit when DVDs come out...it's easy to get excited and buy everything as it is released, like I did. Patience is the key...I'm sure Dr. Katz would agree.",5,Glad I Waited!!,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,1020,"['course', 'great', 'show', 'comment', 'more', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Amazon', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'others', 'best', 'wait', 'complete', 'box', 'sets', 'out', 'skip', 'buying', 'individual', 'seasons', 'also', 'had', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Season', '1', '2', 'sold', 'sealed', 'summer', 'sealed', 'Seinfelds', 'Andy', 'Griffiths', 'King', 'Queens', 'Frasier', 'had', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Sets', 'come', 'out', '2007', 'Most', 'time', 'sets', 'are', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'individually', 'bought', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Complete', 'Series', 'month', 'ago', 'Amazon', 'when', 'was', 'offered', '52.00', 'time', 'increased', '84.00', 'now', '118.00', 'Amazon', 'price', 'quite', 'bit', 'DVDs', 'so', 'keep', 'checking', 'back', 'saw', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Series', 'go', '140.00', '205.00', 'then', 'back', '140.00', 'assume', 'availablility', 'thing', 'have', 'learned', 'relax', 'bit', 'when', 'DVDs', 'come', 'out', 'easy', 'get', 'excited', 'buy', 'everything', 'released', 'did', 'Patience', 'key', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'would', 'agree']",Dr. Katz Professional Therapist - The Complete Series

1097215,AZ1ANK7Q0CVQV,B000UX6TIY,JBinDC,"[8, 8]","This DVD set is well designed.  All the disks are stored in a single case that's easy to flip through.  Each season is split into 2 DVDs of 6-7 episodes each and the seasons have matching colors. The complete series DVDs don't have the obnoxious advertisements that you had to skip through before the menu in the previously released DVDs.The menus are fairly easy to navigate and provide the names of the comedians and air date of each episode.  The video looks good in either widescreen or 4x3 aspects (to me anyway) and none of the image is cut off in either aspect.  I can't tell if that's due to the original format or anamorphic formatting on the DVD, but it seems to work.The only nit I have to pick, and it's a small one, is that they may have purposefully split each season to two disks to jack up the price but it's not enough of a drawback to drop a star.Regarding the show itself, it had been a while since I'd seen the last episodes and I was pleased that the show was pretty consistent from season-to-season.  Some additional background music and transition scenes are mixed in around the 4th-5th seasons and some color creeps into the original b&w; backgrounds, but the style of dialogue remains about the same which is impressive over so many seasons.",5,"Well packaged DVD set,  no commercials",1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1266,"['DVD', 'set', 'well', 'designed', 'disks', 'are', 'stored', 'single', 'case', 'easy', 'flip', 'season', 'split', '2', 'DVDs', '6-7', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'have', 'matching', 'colors', 'complete', 'series', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'obnoxious', 'advertisements', 'had', 'skip', 'menu', 'previously', 'released', 'DVDs.The', 'menus', 'are', 'fairly', 'easy', 'navigate', 'provide', 'names', 'comedians', 'air', 'date', 'episode', 'video', 'good', 'widescreen', '4x3', 'aspects', 'anyway', 'none', 'image', 'cut', 'off', 'aspect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'due', 'original', 'format', 'anamorphic', 'formatting', 'DVD', 'work.The', 'only', 'nit', 'have', 'pick', 'small', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'purposefully', 'split', 'season', 'two', 'disks', 'jack', 'up', 'price', 'not', 'enough', 'drawback', 'drop', 'star.Regarding', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'while', ""'d"", 'seen', 'last', 'episodes', 'was', 'pleased', 'show', 'was', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'season-to-season', 'additional', 'background', 'music', 'transition', 'scenes', 'are', 'mixed', '4th-5th', 'seasons', 'color', 'creeps', 'original', 'b', 'w', 'backgrounds', 'style', 'dialogue', 'same', 'impressive', 'so', 'many', 'seasons']",Dr. Katz Professional Therapist - The Complete Series

(OK, Home Movies is in the same class, but it's made by the same production company.) It's mostly about witty dialog that you can't believe no one ever thought of before, just when you thought that the Simpsons and Seinfeld had done it all.The weak part of the show is the hit or miss stand-up performed by various comedians (as Dr Katz' patients), but it's easy enough to skip over the not-so-funny. Regulars like Ray Romano and Dom Irrera provide lots of great material.Yes, they released the complete series after releasing the first two seasons. And it doesn't appear that they added any additional commentary in seasons 3 and beyond. One great extra is a one-hour live version of the show the cast performed live in 2007. Not as funny as the regular show, but still better than most stuff you'll see on tv. Unfortunately, Katz' guest patients wouldn't shut up long enough for him to interject anything funny.

1097219,A30IUH4AC21ISL,B000UX6TIY,"Parrish A. Highley ""the_projectron""","[2, 2]","Because I never cared for the ""squigglevision"" animation, I avoided this show literally for years.  It was only from seeing various clips of the series featuring Steven Wright and Emo Philips that I decided to give the show a second look.  I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed the core material and central characters, especially Laura Silverman.  The single best episode in terms of the central characters and their quirky dysfunctions was ""Mask"" where, halfway through the show Dr. Katz's deadbeat son Ben finally remembers the nightmare he had a day or two before.  Oh my God, I could not believe the conversation that ensued!  You won't find that episode anywhere but here on the complete series of the show.One of the weaknesses, however, is that too many of the guest comedians simply used Dr. Katz's couch as a platform for their shtick.  The comedians that approached this concept in the manner it deserved not only made their respective episode(s) great, they won over audience that they might not have won over otherwise.  The best guest comedians were Emo Philips, Steven Wright, and the incredible Dom Irrera!  The latter made more appearances than any other comedian and, yet, I never tired of his contributions because he did not treat the couch as just another gig.  I suppose it also doesn't help much that I absolutely, positively loath Ray Romano.  Thank God he finally stop showing up for his appointments because, quite frankly, there is no helping him!All in all, this is a very good purchase.  At times it's mixed bag, but when it is on it is really on.

If I have a complaint about this, it would be that the (very cool) packaging is very difficult to replace if broken. I know this should be a given, but be very gentle with this. My box set slid off of something about 3 ft high and landed on carpet (carpet!) and split the discs right at the 6 and 7. That was the only casualty though, so I am grateful.
