400034,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,630408336X,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","While not as feverishly fun as The Mark of Zorro (1920), Don Q still showcases Douglas Fairbanks's talent for swashbuckling silliness. He plays Don Cesar son of Don Diego aka Zorro. (the Don Q reference in the title is rather obscure, I can't imagine why they just didn't leave it at Son of Zorro) Don Cesar is in Spain for his education and having a whale of a time showing off his skill with the whip, partying with a foreign prince and romancing the lovely Dolores played by a young Mary Astor who is probably best known for her fatal woman role opposite Bogart in the Maltese Falcon some fifteen years later.Donald Crisp (who also directed) plays the chief bad guy Don Sebastian and rival for Dolores's hand in marriage. As it becomes more and more clear that Don Cesar will win her, Don Sebastian murders the foreign prince and frames Don Cesar.The movie is a bit overlong and drags in spots but it is still quite good and makes a good double feature with the original Mark of Zorro. The grand finale featuring father and son (both played by Fairbnanks) is entertaining and Mary Astor makes a nice understated heroine who doesn't faint too much.In the supporting cast is Lottie Pickford, sister of Mary Pickford, as Don Cesar's maid and spy. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were married at this time. Also, Charles Stevens plays Cesar's manservant. He was grandson of Geronimo whom Fairbanks put in almost all of his movies since he considered him lucky.A final note, this movie, like The Mark of Zorro, is silent and the old fashioned methods of acting take a while to get used to but it is worth the effort.",4,Worthy sequel,1007164800,"12 1, 2001",2001,1618,"['not', 'feverishly', 'fun', 'Mark', 'Zorro', '1920', 'Don', 'Q', 'still', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'talent', 'swashbuckling', 'silliness', 'Don', 'Cesar', 'son', 'Don', 'Diego', 'aka', 'Zorro', 'Don', 'Q', 'reference', 'title', 'rather', 'obscure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Son', 'Zorro', 'Don', 'Cesar', 'Spain', 'education', 'having', 'whale', 'time', 'showing', 'off', 'skill', 'whip', 'partying', 'foreign', 'prince', 'romancing', 'lovely', 'Dolores', 'played', 'young', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'fatal', 'woman', 'role', 'opposite', 'Bogart', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later.Donald', 'Crisp', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'chief', 'bad', 'guy', 'Don', 'Sebastian', 'rival', 'Dolores', 'hand', 'marriage', 'more', 'more', 'clear', 'Don', 'Cesar', 'will', 'win', 'Don', 'Sebastian', 'foreign', 'prince', 'frames', 'Don', 'Cesar.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'overlong', 'drags', 'spots', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'good', 'double', 'feature', 'original', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'grand', 'finale', 'featuring', 'father', 'son', 'played', 'Fairbnanks', 'entertaining', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'nice', 'understated', 'heroine', 'who', ""n't"", 'faint', 'too', 'much.In', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lottie', 'Pickford', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'Don', 'Cesar', 'maid', 'spy', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'were', 'married', 'time', 'Also', 'Charles', 'Stevens', 'Cesar', 'manservant', 'was', 'grandson', 'Geronimo', 'whom', 'Fairbanks', 'put', 'almost', 'movies', 'considered', 'lucky.A', 'final', 'note', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'silent', 'old', 'fashioned', 'methods', 'acting', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'effort']",N/A
400035,A62G4QX6XQVLP,630408336X,Anyechka,"[7, 7]","As always, Kino has put out a marvelous DVD, this time featuring not just one but two classics.  First up is 'The Mark of Zorro' (1920), the very first screen version of this famous oft-told tale of the masked bandit who fights injustice and the oppressors of the people in 19th century Spanish California.  This film is special to me because it was the first Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., film I ever saw, though while it did make me want to see more of him, it didn't instantly make him into one of my favorite actors.  However, he is very good in his dual role as both the athletic brash romantic brave Zorro and the shy Don Diego, who is a disgrace to his father because ever since he got back from school in Spain he spends more time doing tricks with handkerchiefs and idling around than trying to find a wife or solidify his place in society.  As Zorro, he is capable of fighting the bad guys and romancing Lolita Pulido, the young lady his father wants him to marry, as though putting on the mask empowers him to do things that he wouldn't dream of doing as Don Diego.  And as much as I normally dislike that old convention of the damsel in distress having to be saved by a man, even considering the era, what hotblooded heterosexual woman wouldn't want to be rescued by a nice drink of water like Doug?  The ending is also really cute.  As good as this film is, however, it does seem a bit chatty for a silent (not really necessary because of all of the great action sequences!), and it is a bit slow-moving at times, although one must consider that 1920 was sort of a transitional time for films.  They were in the process of moving away from the conventions of the Teens and into the more subtle acting and more-developed plots that had come into prominence by about 1922 or so.The second film, 'Don Q, Son of Zorro' (1925), while a sequel, is one of those sequels that can really stand on its own and make perfect sense without having seen the first installment.  It's entirely its own story with its own new plot; the only recurring character is old Zorro, 30 years after the first film ended, though even he isn't the main character in this and doesn't have that much screen time.  There's one flashback to the original film and that's about it in the way of relevant backstory.  Once more he plays a dual role, as both Don Diego and his son (much like the dual role played by Rudy Valentino in 'The Son of the Sheik').  This film seems better-crafted and technically superior to the first, not least because the budget appears to have been bigger.  The sets and costumes are gorgeous, and the plot is more complex, with more twists and turns.  Doug's sister-in-law Lottie Pickford also has a fairly substantial role as Lola, one of his two faithful servants.  Like his father before him, now Don Cesar de Vega too is away at school in Spain, and has gained quite some renown for his skill with the whip.  This skill brings him to the attention of the queen, who invites him to a party at the palace, where he also makes the acquaintance of the queen's visiting cousin Archduke Paul of Austria.  Cesar finds himself the target of Sebastian, one of the royal guards, because they both love the same woman, the lovely Dolores.  The evil Sebastian succeeds in framing Cesar for murder, and the only person who knows Sebastian's secret, Don Fabrique Borusta, is threatened into silence.  Cesar fakes his own death and goes into hiding at the ruins of his family's ancestral castle, where, together with his servants Lola and Robledo, he plots his revenge and concocts a plan to expose Sebastian for who he really is and to get the vital piece of evidence that will prove his innocence.  Along the way, his father finds out about what's going on and sets out for Spain to help, reprising his role as Zorro.  There's even more action and adventure in this picture than in the original, and the ending also hearkens back to the ending in the original.  This was the film that really solidified Fairbanks as one of my favorite male actors.The extras are a brief clip from the newsreel 'Fairbanks vs. Dempsey,' a home movie shot near his offices at United Artists, three entire chapters from a book he wrote in 1918, 'Making Life Worthwhile,' and an introduction to 'The Mark of Zorro' by Orson Welles.  This lattermost extra includes clips from some of Doug's earlier films, with the special bonus of including a clip from his 1930 talkie 'Reaching for the Moon.'  This was a real treat for me because I'd never heard his voice before.  I would have expected a deeper voice, but he had a pleasant speaking voice regardless.Overall, it's a great set, with two fantastic costume action-adventure pictures.  They're but two great examples of how Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., was swashbuckling personified.  This man was constantly in motion, barely staying still for a second, and doing these stunts with such ease and agility.  Purists will complain that the print for 'Don Q' is a bit scratchy, but it's not like it's anywhere near unwatchable or distracting.  Anyone who loves such old films should frankly be used to not always having pristine prints, instead of elevating the matter to such great importance, as though one's main concern is that the print actually shows its age and isn't as crystal-clear as other silent DVDs are, not how awesome the film is and how lucky we are that just about all of Doug's films are still with us, in comparison to the poor survival rate for many other silents.  The scores for both films are also wonderful; I ordinarily prefer a score that has more than just a piano, but the instrument is used very well here and doesn't sound boring or monotonous.",5,An

Fairbanks plays the thief, in love with the princess.  He must infiltrate the palace and impress her more with a bit of magic and trickery.  Out to stop him is a young May Wong, who wants her Chinese countryman to marry the princess.  This is a really cool special effects movie.  It has a genie, a flying carpet, lots of fake smoke and exotic costumes.  (I saw the Kino VHS and picture quality was good.)The Mark of Zorro - Fairbanks made this movie around 1920 when he was just starting out.  He did all his own stunts, and knowing this made it that much cooler watching him go go go.  This has the blend of action and humor that you will be familiar with from more modern Zorro movies.  It is very watchable now and the stunts were frequent and impressive.Robin Hood - A fabulous swashbuckler.  The sets for this were huge and very expensive - they built a middeval castle right in the middle of then undeveloped Hollywood.  At one point Fairbanks slides down a two story curtain in a long fantastic sword fight.  This is good action and stunt filled adventure movie and similar to The Thief of Bagdad in terms of who will like it.The Black Pirate - This is the oldest surviving three color film.  That is film the stuff in the camera I am talking about.  So the reason it gets published now is for historical interest in film methods.  The story is OK, but the image quality is not so hot.  This isn't Kino's fault - the film was in poor condition with many scratches.  Fairbanks and crew of pirates do nifty stunts, including an underwater attack on a ship.  However this movie is unlikely to appeal to most.  Watch it for historical value or pass on it.I haven't seen the other films included in this set.  I think all of these are silent movies, just so you know.  All except The Black Pirate have strong appeal today and are easy to watch.  Silent movies that I have watched from Kino have color tinting and toning.  (This is not colorization and these films could have had these colors when originally released.  Silent film scripts provide notes on how to tint a scene for effect.)  Kino does a great job with the silent movies so this is a safe investment.Fans of Fairbanks should like this.  University libraries should consider it also.  Kino does consistent restorations of older films and at least three of these films are the sort of thing film students might want to have access to.",5,Action - adventure - romance,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,2544,"['OK', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies', 'here', 'info', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Thief', 'Bagdad', 'very', 'nice', 'adventure', 'movie', 'Fairbanks', 'thief', 'love', 'princess', 'must', 'infiltrate', 'palace', 'impress', 'more', 'bit', 'magic', 'trickery', 'stop', 'young', 'May', 'Wong', 'who', 'Chinese', 'countryman', 'marry', 'princess', 'really', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'genie', 'flying', 'carpet', 'lots', 'fake', 'smoke', 'exotic', 'costumes', 'saw', 'Kino', 'VHS', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'Fairbanks', 'made', 'movie', '1920', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'did', 'all', 'own', 'stunts', 'knowing', 'made', 'much', 'cooler', 'watching', 'go', 'go', 'go', 'blend', 'action', 'humor', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'more', 'modern', 'Zorro', 'movies', 'very', 'watchable', 'now', 'stunts', 'were', 'frequent', 'impressive.Robin', 'Hood', 'fabulous', 'swashbuckler', 'sets', 'were', 'huge', 'very', 'expensive', 'built', 'middeval', 'castle', 'right', 'middle', 'then', 'undeveloped', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'point', 'Fairbanks', 'down', 'two', 'story', 'curtain', 'long', 'fantastic', 'sword', 'fight', 'good', 'action', 'stunt', 'filled', 'adventure', 'movie', 'similar', 'Thief', 'Bagdad', 'terms', 'who', 'will', 'like', 'it.The', 'Black', 'Pirate', 'oldest', 'surviving', 'three', 'color', 'film', 'film', 'stuff', 'camera', 'am', 'talking', 'reason', 'published', 'now', 'historical', 'interest', 'film', 'methods', 'story', 'OK', 'image', 'quality', 'not', 'so', 'hot', ""n't"", 'Kino', 'fault', 'film', 'was', 'poor', 'condition', 'many', 'scratches', 'Fairbanks', 'crew', 'pirates', 'do', 'nifty', 'stunts', 'including', 'underwater', 'attack', 'ship', 'However', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'appeal', 'most', 'Watch', 'historical', 'value', 'pass', 'it.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'included', 'set', 'think', 'are', 'silent', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'know', 'Black', 'Pirate', 'have', 'strong', 'appeal', 'today', 'are', 'easy', 'watch', 'Silent', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'Kino', 'have', 'color', 'tinting', 'toning', 'not', 'colorization', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'colors', 'when', 'originally', 'released', 'Silent', 'film', 'scripts', 'provide', 'notes', 'how', 'tint', 'scene', 'effect', 'Kino', 'great', 'job', 'silent', 'movies', 'safe', 'investment.Fans', 'Fairbanks', 'should', 'like', 'University', 'libraries', 'should', 'consider', 'also', 'Kino', 'consistent', 'restorations', 'older', 'films', 'least', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'sort', 'thing', 'film', 'students', 'might', 'want', 'have', 'access']",N/A

400041,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,630408336X,M. Dog,"[25, 26]","If anyone doubts the temporal quality of fame, just think of Douglas Fairbanks to bring the point home. In his day, Douglas Fairbanks' fame was unprecedented. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, were thought of as America's royal family. Today, his marvelous action films are not watched save by film enthusiasts, and his face and name are lost to the youngest generation (if Jay Leno's ""man on the street"" interviews are any indication, our youngest Americans seem proud not to know the name of the Vice President, much less a silent screen actor like Fairbanks).That Douglas Fairbanks should fade from memory is tremendously sad. ""The Mark of Zorro"" is a good example of the kind of film Fairbanks specialized in toward the end of the silent era, and were hugely popular because of the dynamic presence of its star.There really has been nothing to compare with Fairbanks since his departure from films. No action star since can come close to his grace and power in an action film. If you doubt me, buy this DVD and see for yourself. Watch Fairbanks leap over tables, vault over chest-high walls to mount a horse, leap from a table top to a cornice near a ceiling, etc.  And it was not just that he was able to do these feats, it is that he did them effortlessly. The sheer grace of the man was truly thrilling. He never seemed to strain for anything. I realized this while watching the Mark of Zorro during one scene when Fairbanks swings a leg up and dismounts a running horse, in full gallop, to land on his feet as easily as though he were stepping off the ladder. He made it look so easy, I went back and watched the scene again to make sure I had seen what I thought I saw. Yep, he had done it - smooth as silk.Then there is his acting. In this film, Fairbanks plays a duel role: Don Diego, a foppish young noble, and his masked counterpart, Zorro. His portrayal of Don Diego is subtle and effective. His body seems shapeless and soft. His manner is distracted and indecisive and vaguely lost. He detests swordplay and is constantly wiping his face due to his great ""fatigue."" When his love interest declares ""He is not a man - he is a fish!"" she hits the nail on the head. Yet when he dons the mask, his body and manner are reborn. His body looks lithe and full of movement, and his smile, that tremendous, beaming smile that radiated pure happiness, is almost as devastating as his blade.Finally, there is the art design and sets of this film. Fairbanks loved these period pieces, and he spared no expense on research and detail. His care, financial investment, and dedication to craft really show. Everything has a beautiful, ""deep"" feel.As a side note, this review is based on the Kino DVD release of this film, and as with all the Kino releases, this edition looks simply great. God Bless Kino for being one of the best companies preserving and marketing silent films.If you have bothered to read this review, please buy this film. If you do, Douglas Fairbanks will be popular and famous again, at least in your heart.-Mykal Banta",5,Fairbanks - King of the Action Stars,1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,3038,"['anyone', 'temporal', 'quality', 'fame', 'just', 'think', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'bring', 'point', 'home', 'day', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'fame', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'were', 'thought', 'America', 'royal', 'family', 'Today', 'marvelous', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'watched', 'save', 'film', 'enthusiasts', 'face', 'name', 'are', 'lost', 'youngest', 'generation', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'man', 'street', 'interviews', 'are', 'indication', 'youngest', 'Americans', 'seem', 'proud', 'not', 'know', 'name', 'Vice', 'President', 'much', 'less', 'silent', 'screen', 'actor', 'Fairbanks', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'should', 'fade', 'memory', 'tremendously', 'sad', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'good', 'example', 'kind', 'film', 'Fairbanks', 'specialized', 'end', 'silent', 'era', 'were', 'hugely', 'popular', 'dynamic', 'presence', 'star.There', 'really', 'been', 'nothing', 'compare', 'Fairbanks', 'departure', 'films', 'action', 'star', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'grace', 'power', 'action', 'film', 'doubt', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see', 'Watch', 'Fairbanks', 'leap', 'tables', 'vault', 'chest-high', 'walls', 'mount', 'horse', 'leap', 'table', 'top', 'cornice', 'ceiling', 'etc', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'feats', 'did', 'effortlessly', 'sheer', 'grace', 'man', 'was', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'never', 'seemed', 'strain', 'anything', 'realized', 'watching', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Fairbanks', 'swings', 'leg', 'up', 'running', 'horse', 'full', 'gallop', 'land', 'feet', 'as', 'easily', 'were', 'stepping', 'off', 'ladder', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'scene', 'again', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'seen', 'what', 'thought', 'saw', 'Yep', 'had', 'done', 'silk.Then', 'acting', 'film', 'Fairbanks', 'duel', 'role', 'Don', 'Diego', 'foppish', 'young', 'noble', 'masked', 'counterpart', 'Zorro', 'portrayal', 'Don', 'Diego', 'subtle', 'effective', 'body', 'shapeless', 'soft', 'manner', 'distracted', 'indecisive', 'vaguely', 'lost', 'swordplay', 'constantly', 'wiping', 'face', 'due', 'great', 'fatigue', 'When', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'man', 'fish', 'nail', 'head', 'when', 'mask', 'body', 'manner', 'are', 'reborn', 'body', 'lithe', 'full', 'movement', 'smile', 'tremendous', 'beaming', 'smile', 'radiated', 'pure', 'happiness', 'almost', 'as', 'devastating', 'blade.Finally', 'art', 'design', 'sets', 'film', 'Fairbanks', 'loved', 'period', 'pieces', 'spared', 'expense', 'research', 'detail', 'care', 'financial', 'investment', 'dedication', 'craft', 'really', 'show', 'Everything', 'beautiful', 'deep', 'side', 'note', 'review', 'based', 'Kino', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'Kino', 'edition', 'simply', 'great', 'God', 'Bless', 'Kino', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'companies', 'preserving', 'marketing', 'silent', 'films.If', 'have', 'bothered', 'read', 'review', 'please', 'buy', 'film', 'do', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'will', 'be', 'popular', 'famous', 'again', 'least', 'heart.-Mykal', 'Banta']",N/A

A few months ago I heard my ten-year-old daughter laughing at something she was watching. I found she had slipped one of my laser discs on the player and was watching Charlie Chaplain's antics in The Gold Rush. I can't tell you how much pleasure it gave me to find my little girl enjoying one of my silent films, and without knowing the historical significance of Chaplain. I watched the rest of it with her. I discovered she most enjoyed Chaplain, Keaton, and Douglas Fairbank's The Mark Of Zorro.Fairbanks made several great films after he stepped away from the comdedy roles he was doing, but The Mark Of Zorro remains the best one to introduce people to his silent films.The transfer is very good as is the second film: Don Q Son Of Zorro. In Don Q Fairbanks plays Zorro and his son in a return to the legend five years after the release of The Mark Of Zorro and introduced the use of the whip. Watch how Doug flips that cigarette into his mouth. I don't believe I have to say much about the stories as most people know Zorro from the many incarnations over the years. Suffice to say these both have their share of Fairbank's famous acrobatics and both films are worth your time.If you are interested in silent films this is a good place to start; if you are an aficionato of silent films you will not be disappointed.

Fells ""Mr. Arliss's Official Biogra...","[10, 10]","Although Kino makes no boast about print quality on the box, its print of MARK OF ZORRO seems to be from an excellent 35 mm source.  This film is the first, and many say the best, of Doug Fairbanks' swashbucklers that he personally financed and produced during the 1920s.  His subsequent films were more elaborate - he seemed to rival DeMille in epic production quality - but ZORRO is the most consistently energetic.  Fairbanks remains in a class by himself as a superstar and he became a multi-millionaire by acting out his daydreams in films.  That's nice work if you can get it!DON Q, SON OF ZORRO is almost as good but bogs down here and there in story complications.  The print quality and contrast is not as good as ZORRO and I suspect that DON Q comes from a 16 mm. print.  The five years between the two films show Fairbanks' reputation as a producer having grown:  DON Q looks as though it costs four times what MARK OF ZORRO cost. Jon Mirsalis' piano score is very qood and he captures everything that silent film accompaniment should be: melodic and never intrusive.The bonus material is interesting but I wonder why KINO didn't include the five minutes or so of outtakes from DON Q that has been in circulation for years.  The unidentified sound film excerpt of Fairbanks included with Orson Welles' introduction is from the 1931 talkie, REACHING FOR THE MOON.  Even in the excerpt, Fairbanks seems rather constrained by the dialogue chores.  When he enters a room by vaulting through the window, he lands with a &quot;thump,&quot; showing why sound films would rob Fairbanks of the illusion of effortless agility so wonderfully masked in his silent films.  Three chapters from his 1918 motivational book, Making Life Worthwhile, are included.  Some say the book and others published during that time were ghostwritten for Fairbanks. In any event, I've wondered why he had nothing to say to the public during the years of the Great Depression in the 1930s when people really needed a boost.I highly recommend this dvd as a superb example of energetic silent filmmaking and for the joy of experiencing the inimitable Doug Fairbanks personality.",5,Fairbanks in Fine Form,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,2156,"['Kino', 'boast', 'print', 'quality', 'box', 'print', 'MARK', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'be', 'excellent', '35', 'mm', 'source', 'film', 'first', 'many', 'say', 'best', 'Doug', 'Fairbanks', 'swashbucklers', 'personally', 'financed', 'produced', '1920s', 'subsequent', 'films', 'were', 'more', 'elaborate', 'seemed', 'rival', 'DeMille', 'epic', 'production', 'quality', 'ZORRO', 'most', 'consistently', 'energetic', 'Fairbanks', 'class', 'superstar', 'became', 'multi-millionaire', 'acting', 'out', 'daydreams', 'films', 'nice', 'work', 'can', 'get', 'DON', 'Q', 'SON', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'almost', 'good', 'bogs', 'down', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'complications', 'print', 'quality', 'contrast', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'ZORRO', 'suspect', 'DON', 'Q', '16', 'mm', 'print', 'five', 'years', 'two', 'films', 'show', 'Fairbanks', 'reputation', 'producer', 'having', 'grown', 'DON', 'Q', 'four', 'times', 'what', 'MARK', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'cost', 'Jon', 'Mirsalis', 'piano', 'score', 'very', 'qood', 'everything', 'silent', 'film', 'accompaniment', 'should', 'be', 'melodic', 'never', 'intrusive.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'interesting', 'wonder', 'why', 'KINO', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'outtakes', 'DON', 'Q', 'been', 'circulation', 'years', 'unidentified', 'sound', 'film', 'excerpt', 'Fairbanks', 'included', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'introduction', '1931', 'talkie', 'REACHING', 'FOR', 'THE', 'MOON', 'Even', 'excerpt', 'Fairbanks', 'rather', 'constrained', 'dialogue', 'chores', 'When', 'room', 'vaulting', 'window', 'quot', 'thump', 'quot', 'showing', 'why', 'sound', 'films', 'would', 'rob', 'Fairbanks', 'illusion', 'effortless', 'agility', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'masked', 'silent', 'films', 'Three', 'chapters', '1918', 'motivational', 'book', 'Making', 'Life', 'Worthwhile', 'are', 'included', 'say', 'book', 'others', 'published', 'time', 'were', 'ghostwritten', 'Fairbanks', 'event', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'why', 'had', 'nothing', 'say', 'public', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930s', 'when', 'people', 'really', 'needed', 'boost.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'superb', 'example', 'energetic', 'silent', 'filmmaking', 'joy', 'experiencing', 'inimitable', 'Doug', 'Fairbanks', 'personality']",N/A
