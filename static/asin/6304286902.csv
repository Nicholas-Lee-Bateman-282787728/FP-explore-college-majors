I got to tell you, this movie is more hilarious than I ever remembered it ever being. I, literally, laughed the whole way through. To the point where those watching it with me were annoyed by my laughter. Once you get past its' dark but wacky plot(in which two clerks at an insurance agency uncover a $2 million fraud and report it to their boss who happens to be behind the fraud. Bernie invites them to his home for the weekend with the intentions of getting them killed by the mob but the mob has plans to have him killed. Once the task is done, the clerks arrive and find Bernie dead. At first they panic and start to call the police, but when a party of islanders sweeps in, Richard and Larry discover that the local residents are so self-absorbed they don't notice that Bernie is dead. If they can just convince everyone that Bernie is still alive for they weekend, they can have a splendid time. Unfortunately, they also convince the mob hitman, who keeps trying to take Bernie out and that's where the hilarity ensues), you'll see alot to like about Weekend at Bernies. Thing is, if you're the type that takes this movie a lil more seriously than you should- you're just not going to get it. Just accept it for the wacky film that it is and you'll have a blast.What gets me the most is how Terry Kiser can keep such a straight face during the whole thing. I think that is what made me laugh more than anything. If I were him doing the acting, I would've been cracking up the whole time.At any rate, Weekend at Bernie's is good(albeit dark)fun.",5,Weekend at Bernie's......,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1732,"['remembered', 'seeing', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'buy', 'local', 'Wally-World', 'Wal-Mart', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'got', 'tell', 'movie', 'more', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'remembered', 'ever', 'being', 'literally', 'laughed', 'whole', 'way', 'point', 'where', 'watching', 'were', 'annoyed', 'laughter', 'Once', 'get', 'dark', 'wacky', 'plot', 'two', 'clerks', 'insurance', 'agency', '2', 'million', 'fraud', 'report', 'boss', 'who', 'be', 'fraud', 'Bernie', 'home', 'weekend', 'intentions', 'getting', 'killed', 'mob', 'mob', 'plans', 'have', 'killed', 'task', 'done', 'clerks', 'arrive', 'find', 'Bernie', 'dead', 'first', 'panic', 'start', 'call', 'police', 'when', 'party', 'islanders', 'sweeps', 'Richard', 'Larry', 'discover', 'local', 'residents', 'are', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Bernie', 'dead', 'can', 'just', 'convince', 'everyone', 'Bernie', 'still', 'alive', 'weekend', 'can', 'have', 'splendid', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'convince', 'mob', 'hitman', 'who', 'trying', 'take', 'Bernie', 'out', 'where', 'hilarity', 'ensues', ""'ll"", 'see', 'alot', 'like', 'Weekend', 'Bernies', 'Thing', ""'re"", 'type', 'movie', 'lil', 'more', 'seriously', 'should-', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'Just', 'wacky', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast.What', 'most', 'how', 'Terry', 'Kiser', 'can', 'keep', 'such', 'straight', 'face', 'whole', 'thing', 'think', 'what', 'made', 'more', 'anything', 'were', 'doing', 'acting', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cracking', 'up', 'whole', 'time.At', 'rate', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'good', 'dark', 'fun']",N/A
412097,A32T860CJ0V74I,6304286902,"""bogart_fan""","[8, 11]","...at Bernie's.There comes a time in every cinema aficionado's film-watching that he comes upon a film that's such an astonishing work of art and reminds us why we love films. To even attempt to describe my utter appreciation and amazement for this masterpiece would do a great dis-service to Goddard's directorial vision. Such a film, is Jean Luc Goddard's challenging magnum opus WEEKEND at Bernie's. 'Bernie's' is a cinematic tour-de-force. I must express my gratitude to Amazon.com for recommending such an astounding exemplar of imaginative filmmaking.On a supplemental level, WEEKEND at Bernie's plays feast for the eyes and ears. Bountiful colors shine vibrantly while the characters try to get themselves out of some various zany situations. WEEKEND at Bernie's is the best dark comedy since Charles Chaplin's 1947 work of genius Monsieur Verdoux, which Orson Welles co-wrote. On a fundamental level, we a treated to a film that plays as a wonderful homage to the masters (Alfred Hitchcock, of course) film, The Trouble with Harry. The composition framing of WEEKEND at Bernies is dazzling, and has been imitated, but never duplicated. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular. The milieu of the luxurious island is a highlight of the film. But my favorite part of WEEKEND at Bernie's is the stunning character development. The screenplay executed as a precise balance between farce and sadness has been constructed by the great Ted Kotchef. WEEKEND at Bernie's is a luminous commentary on life and death.The word masterpiece as been thrown around haphazardly among so-called film critics to express their love and admiration for a movie...Including in my current assessment of WEEKEND at Bernies...Rarely has a film truly embodied everything that the word &quot;masterpiece&quot; stands for...When we go to the movies, we expect to laugh, to cry, to be scared, and to be entertained.... But for the first time, I felt something new... I felt humbled to have had the honor and privledge to experience Godard's stunning vision. I say the word masterpiece not to sound &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;knowledgable,&quot; but because it's appropriate...WEEKEND at Bernie's...you ARE that word...WEEKEND at Bernie's- ***** (of *****)",5,My experience with Jean Luc Goddard's WEEKEND...,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,2249,"[""Bernie's.There"", 'time', 'cinema', 'aficionado', 'film-watching', 'film', 'astonishing', 'work', 'art', 'why', 'love', 'films', 'even', 'attempt', 'describe', 'utter', 'appreciation', 'amazement', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'do', 'great', 'dis-service', 'Goddard', 'directorial', 'vision', 'film', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Goddard', 'challenging', 'magnum', 'opus', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'cinematic', 'tour-de-force', 'must', 'express', 'gratitude', 'Amazon.com', 'recommending', 'astounding', 'exemplar', 'imaginative', 'filmmaking.On', 'supplemental', 'level', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'plays', 'feast', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Bountiful', 'colors', 'shine', 'vibrantly', 'characters', 'try', 'get', 'various', 'zany', 'situations', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'best', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', '1947', 'work', 'genius', 'Monsieur', 'Verdoux', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'co-wrote', 'fundamental', 'level', 'treated', 'film', 'wonderful', 'homage', 'masters', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'course', 'film', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'composition', 'framing', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernies', 'dazzling', 'been', 'imitated', 'never', 'duplicated', 'cinematography', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'milieu', 'luxurious', 'island', 'highlight', 'film', 'favorite', 'part', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'stunning', 'character', 'development', 'screenplay', 'executed', 'precise', 'balance', 'farce', 'sadness', 'been', 'constructed', 'great', 'Ted', 'Kotchef', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'luminous', 'commentary', 'life', 'death.The', 'word', 'masterpiece', 'been', 'thrown', 'haphazardly', 'so-called', 'film', 'critics', 'express', 'love', 'admiration', 'movie', 'Including', 'current', 'assessment', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernies', 'Rarely', 'film', 'truly', 'embodied', 'everything', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'go', 'movies', 'expect', 'laugh', 'cry', 'be', 'scared', 'be', 'entertained', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'something', 'new', 'felt', 'humbled', 'have', 'had', 'honor', 'privledge', 'experience', 'Godard', 'stunning', 'vision', 'say', 'word', 'not', 'sound', 'quot', 'pretentious', 'quot', 'quot', 'knowledgable', 'quot', 'appropriate', 'WEEKEND', 'Bernie', 'ARE', 'word', 'WEEKEND', ""Bernie's-"", '*****', '*****']",N/A

It just has that perfect 80s-ness to it.Weekend At Bernie's came out in 1989, the tail end of the 1980s. Starring Jonathon Silverman and Andrew McCarthy, WAB is a movie about two accountants, Richard and Larry respectively, who work at a very successful insurance firm in New York City. Their boss and company CEO Bernie Lomax, played by Terry Kiser, has ties to a local organized crime crew and is embezzling from the company. At the beginning, Richard and Larry discover someone is ripping the company off. Alerting their boss, unknowing that it's Bernie himself stealing from the company. Bernie then arranges for not only them to come to his beach house over the weekend, but for his mob connections to have the two friends taken care of. However, it backfires when the mob boss has Bernie killed instead.During a case of mixed connections, Richard and Larry find out about the deal (but not the fact the killer was never after them to begin with), get worried, and come up with a plan that basically is no one else knows Bernie is dead, so they'll keep the charade up that he's alive until they're able to get off the island.Despite however morbid it sounds, it's far from it and is actually a light-hearted comedy. This is one of those movies I love watching and can watch this constantly when I want to. There's just something about the movie that I love and often has a cheering up effect on me. Andrew McCarthy, Jonathon Silverman, and Terry Kiser work very well in their performances.Is the movie worth checking out? I would say yes.",5,"Hey, I Have An Idea.

Watching the movie recently with my roommate, I couldn't help but thinking about the sort of Los Angeles society that could have a raucous cocktail party and never notice the dead body on the couch - that a giant group of people could cavort and network, occasionally even talk with/ get groped by the corpse and still find conversations about car prices important enough that even the dead can't steal their attention from themselves.  For a while, I saw Weekend At Bernie's as perhaps a little wiser than I'd given it credit for as a kid - maybe in modern LA, it IS possible that two corporate dweebs could siphon an identity from a dead sleazebag.  But there's no way to keep it from falling victim to Eighties Movie Syndrome - a romance that seems free of actual interaction briefly sidelined by criminals that seem free of any ability.  And, like so many movies of our youth, the jokes seem now to be dismal even when we can pick them out - a dead body being dragged by a boat now seems impossible to be mistaken for waterskiing, even if I used to think it was hilarious.

I remember watching this at a prepubescent age over and over, at a time when the mere sight of someone getting hit by something was funny (so I guess there's the EPIC MOVIE and the like's audience... finally found it). Now, at a college age, I still can enjoy this movie for what it is: a moronic, implausible, yet strangely compellingly funny movie (double adverb, impressive).The plot, as many may know, involves Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman), two young up-and-coming insurance guys at a prestigious firm run by Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), so rich his car is bigger than Larry's apartment. So Larry and Richard are overjoyed when they discover someone has been stealing from the company and bring this to Bernie's attention. He seems appreciative and invites the boys to his beach home for the weekend. They of course agree, and we cut to Bernie asking mobster Vito (Louis Giambalvo... had to look him up as well) to have the boys murdered. Yes, Bernie has been doing the stealing and needs the only 2 guys on his trail snuffed out. Vito decides Bernie is the one he needs out of the way and hires crony Paulie (the reliably funny Don Calfa) to dispose of ol' Bern. So Larry and Richard arrive to a beautiful beach house, beautiful women, a full stock of alcohol, and a party on the way. Oh yeah, and their dead boss, who has been all set up to appear like he has overdosed. Of course they want to call 911 (more Richard than Larry, as Larry's a bit more upset that Bernie couldn't have waited until Monday to kill himself), but then the party starts, and no one seems to notice that Bernie's dead (here's where the critics really start puffing on their 'oh, how ludicrous' pipes), so Larry suggests they just pretend (for a bit) that he's not dead and have a little fun. This plan goes from waiting 10 minutes to waiting until the next day, when they discover Bernie's plan and also that Paulie is on their tail to finish them and Bernie (who he believes is still alive as the boys are doing a pretty nice job of keeping him seemingly animated) off. Add in the girl of Richard's dreams Gwen (Catherine Mary Stewart) to act surprised at every plot turn as Larry and Richard dodge bullets and neighbors, and you have yourself a comedy.Yes, it's all handled quite ridiculously, but come on, writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotcheff are not aiming for Shakespeare here. What the film sets out to do is make people laugh, and I cannot deny it that. Most of the laughs are due to the amazing performance by Kiser, who looks and appears dead the whole way through. Whether flying off the back of boats, over railings, and down ramps or walking with Larry and Richard around town happily, Kiser actually convinces us that he is out of the picture. McCarthy and Silverman are also very funny with their contrasting personalities, Richard the voice of reason and Larry the horndog that has more bad ideas than good ones. So don't expect a comedy classic here, but I would be hard-pressed to find someone who appreciates dumb comedy when it is done well that doesn't at least smile throughout the film.",4,Why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

When I eventually rented the VHS tape a few months later it really appealed to my dark sense of humor and I ended up watching it a zillion times. In the 25 years since its release it has become very dated. It's not dated BADLY, but it has aged more than other films of the period.Corporate slackers Richard and Larry (Ted Mosby prototype Jonathan Silverman and 80s person Andrew McCarthy) discover a $4,000,000 fraud hidden away in the cooked books. Their attempt to impress their boss Bernie Lomax (a lovably smug Terry Kiser) with their find leads to an invitation to his Hampton Island home for a summer weekend of babes, booze, and boats. The duo don't realize that they've stumbled on Bernie's embezzlement scam and that he intends to have them quietly killed by the Mob (the organized crime connections are never fully detailed or understood). Mob Boss Vito instead arranges for Bernie to be killed, thus washing his hands of him.Upon arriving at Bernie's lavish home Richard and Larry discover that he ain't quite breathing and most definitely has ceased living. For a variety of reasons they plot to create the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which proves to be easier done than said as his vacuous, drunken neighbors are more interested in drinking his champagne and mooching parties from him than actually being friends.Despite the dark subject matter Weekend at Bernie's plays it safe for the most part, never pushing past its PG-13 boundaries. The physicality of Kiser's performance is impressive as well as funny. You really do believe he is dead and he's brilliant at keeping a straight face (or a smirking one as he dies during a brief moment of pleasure) while being tossed and thrown around. You wouldn't think that playing a dead body would be hard but Kiser's comic timing and skill really pay off.The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears.What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family-friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Skip the sequel. Enjoy this movie for what it is, though it could have been better if it were a few shades darker. And lookout for a hilarious cameo from the director as Richard's dad/butler.The Blu-ray looks great in 1.85:1 1080p, the best the film has ever looked on home video by a longshot. The DTS HD-MA 2.0 sound really does make the constant ADR even more obvious. The menu has the nerve to list &#34;extras&#34; (plural) but offers only a single trailer.There also appears to be many other cuts and edits to this movie on the Blu-ray to make it less raunchy that might irritate some fans. I distinctly remember the film being more adult than this (but I am used to the UK 15-rated version not the US PG-13 version featured on this disc).",3,The movie has been cut and altered on this US Blu-ray,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3423,"['remember', 'seeing', 'TV', 'spots', 'movie', 'Florida', '1989', 'thinking', 'made', 'great', 'concept', 'When', 'eventually', 'rented', 'VHS', 'tape', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'really', 'appealed', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'zillion', 'times', '25', 'years', 'release', 'become', 'very', 'dated', 'not', 'dated', 'BADLY', 'aged', 'more', 'other', 'films', 'period.Corporate', 'slackers', 'Richard', 'Larry', 'Ted', 'Mosby', 'prototype', 'Jonathan', 'Silverman', '80s', 'person', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'discover', '4,000,000', 'fraud', 'hidden', 'away', 'cooked', 'books', 'attempt', 'impress', 'boss', 'Bernie', 'Lomax', 'lovably', 'smug', 'Terry', 'Kiser', 'find', 'invitation', 'Hampton', 'Island', 'home', 'summer', 'weekend', 'babes', 'booze', 'boats', 'duo', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'ve"", 'stumbled', 'Bernie', 'embezzlement', 'scam', 'have', 'quietly', 'killed', 'Mob', 'organized', 'crime', 'connections', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'detailed', 'understood', 'Mob', 'Boss', 'Vito', 'instead', 'Bernie', 'be', 'killed', 'thus', 'washing', 'hands', 'him.Upon', 'arriving', 'Bernie', 'lavish', 'home', 'Richard', 'Larry', 'discover', 'ai', ""n't"", 'quite', 'breathing', 'most', 'definitely', 'ceased', 'living', 'variety', 'reasons', 'plot', 'create', 'illusion', 'Bernie', 'still', 'alive', 'be', 'easier', 'done', 'said', 'vacuous', 'drunken', 'neighbors', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'drinking', 'champagne', 'mooching', 'parties', 'actually', 'being', 'friends.Despite', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'plays', 'safe', 'most', 'part', 'never', 'pushing', 'PG-13', 'boundaries', 'physicality', 'Kiser', 'performance', 'impressive', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'really', 'do', 'believe', 'dead', 'brilliant', 'keeping', 'straight', 'face', 'smirking', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'pleasure', 'being', 'tossed', 'thrown', 'around', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'playing', 'dead', 'body', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'Kiser', 'comic', 'timing', 'skill', 'really', 'pay', 'off.The', 'production', 'design', 'flat', 'photography', 'are', 'what', 'date', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Ted', 'Kotcheff', 'had', 'Wake', 'Fright', 'First', 'Blood', 'resume', 'point', 'very', 'little', 'visual', 'flair', 'film', 'very', 'TV-ish', 'poor', 'score', 'Andy', 'Summers', 'never', 'work', 'scene', 'have', 'feeling', 'friend', 'Stewart', 'Copeland', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'soundtrack', 'choices', 'grate', 'ears.What', 'most', 'about', '90', '%', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'ADR', 'assume', 'sound', 'guy', 'forgot', 'switch', 'mic', 'something', 'can', 'accept', 'when', 'dubbing', 'over', 'several', 'F-bombs', 'keep', 'movie', 'family-friendly', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'often', 'words', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'lips.Skip', 'sequel', 'Enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'were', 'few', 'shades', 'darker', 'lookout', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'director', 'Richard', 'dad/butler.The', 'Blu-ray', 'looks', 'great', '1.85:1', '1080p', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'looked', 'home', 'video', 'longshot', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', '2.0', 'sound', 'really', 'make', 'constant', 'ADR', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'menu', 'nerve', 'list', '34', '34', 'plural', 'only', 'single', 'trailer.There', 'also', 'be', 'many', 'other', 'cuts', 'edits', 'movie', 'Blu-ray', 'make', 'less', 'might', 'irritate', 'fans', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'adult', 'am', 'used', 'UK', '15-rated', 'version', 'not', 'US', 'PG-13', 'version', 'featured', 'disc']",N/A

Hell I could toss it one star easily too because I see everything that is bad about it. But I still can't help but to see it as great fun ayway. It stars Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy as 2 bafoons who wanna work for a rich businessman named Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). They know something about his business that they don't realize he wants to kill them for knowing.He invites them for a weekend at his beach home but he gets killed before they get there. They slowly realize that he's dead and people on the island are slower than them because they just don't see that he's dead. So they fake him being alive just so they can live it up and enjoy his place to themselves. They soon have to save themselves from the guy who killed Bernie. The result is a really really stupid movie with pretty awful acting but will you enjoy the movie anyway ? Hell yes! Terry Kiser actually is hilarious and gives a fun performance as...a dead body. It's silly that no one can even tell that Bernie is dead and try to carry conversations with him. Hell his g/f has sex with him and doesn't even know she had sex with a dead body.Of course those are good reasons critics gave it one star but to me those are good reasons to enjoy how stupid this movie is.

The movie is also kind of dumb but is still funny and it works despite the dumbness of the plot.  Here's the set up: Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathon Silverman) are two employees that are rather low on the corporate ladder at an insurance firm.  They notice a discrepancy that shows that one claim paid out four different checks for one person's death.  They bring it up with their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser) and when he sees that it is a scam, he rewards them with a weekend at his house/summer home.  Here's the kicker: Bernie is really in on the scam and along with his associates, he puts out a hit on Larry and Richard.  Instead, Bernie's associate has Bernie killed (Bernie was sleeping with the guy's wife/mistress).This is when Larry and Richard arrive on the island.  They discover that Bernie is dead, but are a little confused about how to proceed.  Do they call the cops?  What do they say?  They are still freaked out by it when Bernie's neighbors start arriving for a party.  Since Bernie looks pretty much alive (and wearing the sunglasses, he can be sleeping or looking around), they prop him up on the couch.  Nobody catches on to the fact that Bernie is dead and it almost seems that Bernie is the life of the party (pun intended).  For the rest of the weekend Larry and Richard pass off Bernie as being alive (even carrying him around between them).Despite the premise of the movie, Weekend at Bernie's works.  It is funnier than I expected it to be.  Yes, it's a dumb movie, but it's also decently funny at the same time.  A highlight of the movie is the guy who plays Bernie.  Sure, he's dead for most of the movie, but Bernie also makes the movie, just how he looks and gets to react (it'll make sense if you see it).  Bernie is a riot.  I can't strongly recommend the movie, but give it a shot, you might be surprised.",3,"dumb, but funny.

Chances are, if you're reading this far, you know the premise. Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser, in the role of a lifetime) is dead... but in order to save themselves from the same hitmen that whacked out Bernie, his bumbling employees at a New York insurance firm have to keep up a charade and pretend Bernie is alive. Which leads to scenes of Bernie being dragged around, falling down, waterskiing (including the CLONGGGG sound of his head hitting a buoy), having his toupee stapled back on, being dropped some more, etc.The film is pretty dumb. But I wouldn't expect, nor would I probably accept, anything else. It's a one-joke flick, sure, but if you love tasteless humor and a good guilty pleasure of a laugh, you will get some quality chuckles from this one.On the (rare) occasion that I see Terry Kiser in another film, I can't help but think of...Bernie. This is pretty much the highlight of his career (unless you consider his preceeding role as a whacky psychiatrist in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood to be superior).Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman are pretty good as the bumbling (and alive) comedy team here.
