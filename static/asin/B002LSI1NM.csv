Otherwise, you should enjoy yourself. I'm a PCD fan--their songs regularly make the rotation on my gym playlist so that's why I picked it up. I wasn't disappointed. The burlesque routine is a little over the top, but you can still do the moves without the feather boa. All the dances are great cardio. The ""Dontcha"" routine primarily works your lower body, while ""Buttons"" works your legs & abs. The burlesque routine is basically filler in my opinion, but it will keep your heart rate up. All in all, this is a relatively painless way to get in your daily dose of exercise and get in touch with your sensual side at the same time.

1277175,A7U9GG09POJ02,B002LSI1NM,Erin,"[13, 15]","I'm amazed that people making 'dance' dvds touted as workouts are still making this grave mistake: the routines need to be longer than 34 seconds long.The chorography for the routines are a good mix between easy-to-learn and interesting. But in the end, working out to three 30-second routines barely justifies learning it in the first place. It gets boring as hell and you wonder: why didn't they teach us a whole song instead of just a too-easy, too-short chorus repeated ad nauseum that insults an average person's intelligence and stamina.The routines also tend to favor one side of the body (lifting the leg, arm on only one side, which feels lopsided and leaves you wanting to some how reverse it to get your other side worked out). I just can't get over how short this 'workout' is, exactly where Carmen Electra's 'dance' dvds failed as well. If you're a PCD fan, of course, it's going to be fun just to (shortly) get into a bit of their groove. If you're a dancer, like me, you'll buy it just because you can't resist seeing for yourself. But if you want to dance and sweat hard go for 'Dance with Julianne' which is probably the best dance dvd in last 5 years.At the end of the day this isn't a dvd anyone is going to go back to. It is just too lightweight and doesn't take the physical challange seriously enough by either making it longer or simply making more of it.

1277176,A2XHZEEJ0RCCC9,B002LSI1NM,Gigi Powell,"[2, 2]","OK. I debated buying this for a looonng time. First of all, I have never liked dance. My mother forced me to take tap and ballet as a child and I was fat and a klutz to boot. It was traumatic. LOL..As an adult I have always avoided dance floors because I am so uncoordinated and have zero rhythm. I am nearly 47 years old, quite overweight (though I have lost 66 lbs so far in 6 months and I am going to keep on going). The reason I finally broke down and bought this is because I have been in a Tae Bo rut for quite some time. Don't get me wrong, I adore Billy Blanks, but I needed a change. I used to do Tae Kwon Do and Kickboxing and I find his workouts enjoyable due to this training. I got the PCD workout to challenge myself with something, get out of my comfort zone, and have a change of pace. I can honestly say, I LOVED THIS WORKOUT!!!! It was really easy to follow--even for an uncoordinated lady like me--and a lot of fun....I loved getting to do ""naughty"" moves I would never ordinarily do. The girls are sickeningly gorgeous and have perfect bodies (If one could die from envy, I would literally be dead right now over the envy I feel over their looks..LOL). Although God did not bless me with lack of weight issues, He dDID bless me with a fantastic imagination and I was able to picture myself on that stage as a PCD myself and looking like them while doing this workout....Then I had to come back to reality (bummer). On a completely serious note, I think this is a SUPER workout when you want something lighter if you usually are a hard core exerciser like myself (2 hour workouts most days...but I am in a hurry to get to a normal weight....feels like I am literally running..or punching or kicking...for my life)....I found Ms. Antin to be absolutely charming as well as the girls themselves. I felt confident vicariously through their confidence that shines through.

1277179,AL63PFK6S156O,B002LSI1NM,"K.H. :) ""Enjoying the Journey""","[115, 120]","So, this workout was fun and sexy so I gave it three stars; however, there were many drawbacks that prevent this from being a truly awesome workout. I'll tell you some details of the workout and then explain what I saw as deficiencies.Pussycat Dolls (PCD) Workout DVD is led by Robin Antin, the creator of the group. She is joined by Christina from the group, Girlicious, and 3 ladies from her burlesque show in Vegas. Nicole Scherzinger only shows up in the performance section of the Buttons routine. All of the participants look fabulous and if their physiques don't inspire you to exercise- nothing will. They are trying a bit too hard to be sexy-but what do you expect from PCD.The workout is split into 3 different 30-second dance routines: Don't Cha, Burlesque and Buttons. Robin takes about 10-15 minutes to teach you each routine, and then there are 3-4 minute performances of each routine. During the performance sections you perform the short routines multiple times with some freestyle dancing in between.Robin is used to teaching seasoned dancers and it shows- she does not break down moves that other instructors would. However, she performs each move multiple times so that you would have no problem learning it. The dances are not taken strictly from the PCD routines, but are modified so that most people would be able to pick them up quickly. A word of warning- this routine may not be appropriate to perform around children (ie, this is the only workout my boyfriend can't wait for me to do). The women are very scantily clad and you will frequently be asked to grind it, pop it and slap your booty- among other maneuvers. The only equipment required to perform the routine is a feather boa, scarf or necktie for the Burlesque section.Cons: The routines are very short at 30 seconds each, and not so difficult that you couldn't learn them on the first try.  This means that you could easily grow bored with this workout. Also it is annoying that Robin frequently repeats, ""You should do this workout everyday"" (if you did you would be bored to tears) or ""We do this move in PCD all the time"" (marketing- much?). Most importantly, if you are anything but a very beginner at exercise-the DVD will be too easy for you. I think that Robin should make the routines longer so that you get a better workout and stop trying to ride the PCD train for everything it's worth.",3,Unleash your inner Pussycat Doll~,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2383,"['So', 'workout', 'was', 'fun', 'sexy', 'so', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'however', 'were', 'many', 'drawbacks', 'prevent', 'being', 'truly', 'awesome', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'details', 'workout', 'then', 'explain', 'what', 'saw', 'deficiencies.Pussycat', 'Dolls', 'PCD', 'DVD', 'led', 'Robin', 'Antin', 'creator', 'group', 'joined', 'Christina', 'group', 'Girlicious', '3', 'ladies', 'burlesque', 'show', 'Vegas', 'Nicole', 'Scherzinger', 'only', 'up', 'performance', 'section', 'Buttons', 'routine', 'participants', 'look', 'fabulous', 'physiques', 'do', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'exercise-', 'nothing', 'will', 'are', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'sexy-but', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'PCD.The', 'workout', 'split', '3', 'different', '30-second', 'dance', 'routines', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cha', 'Burlesque', 'Buttons', 'Robin', '10-15', 'minutes', 'teach', 'routine', 'then', 'are', '3-4', 'minute', 'performances', 'routine', 'performance', 'sections', 'perform', 'short', 'routines', 'multiple', 'times', 'freestyle', 'dancing', 'between.Robin', 'used', 'teaching', 'seasoned', 'dancers', 'shows-', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'moves', 'other', 'instructors', 'would', 'However', 'move', 'multiple', 'times', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'learning', 'dances', 'are', 'not', 'taken', 'strictly', 'PCD', 'routines', 'are', 'modified', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'quickly', 'word', 'warning-', 'routine', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'perform', 'around', 'children', 'ie', 'only', 'workout', 'boyfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'women', 'are', 'very', 'scantily', 'clad', 'will', 'frequently', 'be', 'asked', 'grind', 'slap', 'booty-', 'other', 'maneuvers', 'only', 'equipment', 'required', 'perform', 'routine', 'feather', 'boa', 'scarf', 'necktie', 'Burlesque', 'section.Cons', 'routines', 'are', 'very', 'short', '30', 'seconds', 'not', 'so', 'difficult', 'could', ""n't"", 'learn', 'first', 'try', 'could', 'easily', 'grow', 'bored', 'workout', 'Also', 'annoying', 'Robin', 'frequently', 'should', 'do', 'workout', 'everyday', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'do', 'move', 'PCD', 'time', 'marketing-', 'much', 'Most', 'importantly', 'are', 'anything', 'very', 'beginner', 'exercise-the', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'think', 'Robin', 'should', 'make', 'routines', 'longer', 'so', 'get', 'better', 'workout', 'stop', 'trying', 'ride', 'PCD', 'train', 'everything', 'worth']",N/A

1277183,A2EIEFWC5RRFH7,B002LSI1NM,NotThatGirl,"[71, 77]","This was kinda of an impulse buy. I was looking for something that would help provide a good cardio workout at home for when I am too lazy to drive to the gym. I am a big fan of workout dvds and am relatively picky with what I put in my collection. I do like this dvd, but I have to say right at the start that it is a little cheesy. I get really annoyed by things like that but it wasn't  in excess so I got over it. I bought this at the same time as Julianne Hough's new dvd, and while she is a much better instructor, Robin Antin does a pretty good job too. She isn't as sweet as Julianne, but she does repeat the moves she teaches you enough times that you can pick it up pretty quickly and I have no prior dance experience at ALL! The breakdown of the moves is pretty good too, she doesn't throw so many new things into each set that you forget what moves your doing. I think the reason why you get some cardio from this is because you are repeating the same sets of moves over and over again, with a short break inbetween. While this is great for practicing getting the moves down and mastering those, it could also get VERY repetative if this was in your dvd rotation more then a couple time a week. Robin says 'you should do this everyday' to some of the moves and while that may be true, it would get really boring to do so. I do like that in some places there is at least one girl in the background doing a slight modification and I find that nice when I either don't know what I am doing or am too lazy to go all out on a workout. I don't think I will use this as much as Julianne's but it is still a good way to get a workout done at home.

1277185,A2V6FUZ0D2H8GU,B002LSI1NM,sooz,"[0, 0]","After being completely out of shape for close to twenty years, I've started working out a couple of months ago.  I really hate working out but I love dancing, which is why this kind of video is perfect for someone like me.  When I first started out, I used to do Carmen Electra's aerobic striptease, which was at the time extremely challenging and now I find it ridiculously easy.  It makes me feel good to be able measure my progress that way.I have a bunch of other workout DVDs as well, belly dance, hip hop, bollywood, brazilian, you name it.  A lot of them are fun but incredibly difficult for where I am in my fitness development.  Pussycat Dolls Workout video is just the right amount of challenging for me - it's not so difficult that I feel frustrated, but it's difficult enough that I feel like I'm getting a workout and learning new moves.  I did the video for the first time today and I worked up a good sweat.  I will definitely be sore tomorrow.I am ridiculously uncoordinated, so the patient repetition and breakdown of the moves were extremely helpful for me.  I think Robin Antin is a great instructor and all the ladies in the video are fit and sexy and really look like they're having a great time.  Some people may pick up on the moves very quickly, but I am not one of those people.Thank you PCD for making a fun and sexy workout video.  Being as out of shape as I am, it's hard to do moves that make a gal feel sexy, but I feel like this video helps me achieve that.  Surely I will reach a level, like I did with Carmen Electra, where the moves are too easy and I'll be glad to move on to something else.  But I'm glad this video was here along the way.  Doing workout videos at home is a nice way to get in shape without having to feel embarrassed about other people watching you.  I have both PCD workout videos, I have watched them both in full and the choreography is great.For those of you who feel you're getting a lopsided workout, since the moves they teach you are not repeated for both sides of the body, try learning the routines first by mirroring, which means moving your left when the instructor is moving her right.  The video footage is reversed to facilitate mirroring, so when she says ""Go to the right"", she actually means your right, even though it looks like she's moving to her left.Once you have mirroring down, then you can try shadowing, which basically reverses the moves so that you're doing with your left what the instructor is doing with her left.  (If you're facing the television and your moves are matching, that is mirroring.  With shadowing it looks like you're going in the opposite direction if you're facing the instructor, but if you had your back to the television and were facing away from the instructor, or in other words you and the instructor are facing in the same direction, then you can see why it's called shadowing, because then the movement directions match.  Hope that makes sense.)  So anyway, if you get bored with it quickly or feel like you're getting a lopsided workout, try switching from mirroring to shadowing to even things out and to extend the use for the video.",5,Fun and sexy workout for beginners,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,3147,"['being', 'completely', 'shape', 'close', 'twenty', 'years', ""'ve"", 'started', 'working', 'out', 'couple', 'months', 'really', 'hate', 'working', 'love', 'dancing', 'why', 'kind', 'video', 'perfect', 'someone', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'used', 'do', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'aerobic', 'striptease', 'was', 'time', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'now', 'find', 'ridiculously', 'easy', 'feel', 'good', 'be', 'able', 'measure', 'progress', 'way.I', 'have', 'bunch', 'other', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'belly', 'dance', 'hip', 'hop', 'bollywood', 'brazilian', 'name', 'lot', 'are', 'fun', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'where', 'am', 'fitness', 'development', 'Pussycat', 'Dolls', 'Workout', 'video', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'challenging', 'not', 'so', 'difficult', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'difficult', 'enough', 'feel', ""'m"", 'getting', 'workout', 'learning', 'new', 'moves', 'did', 'video', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'worked', 'up', 'good', 'sweat', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'sore', 'tomorrow.I', 'am', 'ridiculously', 'uncoordinated', 'patient', 'repetition', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'were', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'think', 'Robin', 'Antin', 'great', 'instructor', 'ladies', 'video', 'are', 'fit', 'sexy', 'really', 'look', ""'re"", 'having', 'great', 'time', 'people', 'may', 'pick', 'up', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'PCD', 'making', 'fun', 'sexy', 'workout', 'video', 'Being', 'shape', 'am', 'hard', 'do', 'moves', 'make', 'gal', 'feel', 'sexy', 'feel', 'video', 'achieve', 'Surely', 'will', 'reach', 'level', 'did', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'where', 'moves', 'are', 'too', 'easy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'move', 'something', 'else', ""'m"", 'glad', 'video', 'was', 'here', 'way', 'Doing', 'videos', 'home', 'nice', 'way', 'get', 'shape', 'having', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'other', 'people', 'watching', 'have', 'PCD', 'workout', 'videos', 'have', 'watched', 'full', 'choreography', 'great.For', 'who', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'lopsided', 'workout', 'moves', 'teach', 'are', 'not', 'repeated', 'sides', 'body', 'try', 'learning', 'routines', 'first', 'mirroring', 'moving', 'left', 'when', 'instructor', 'moving', 'right', 'video', 'footage', 'reversed', 'facilitate', 'mirroring', 'so', 'when', 'Go', 'right', 'actually', 'right', 'even', 'moving', 'left.Once', 'have', 'mirroring', 'down', 'then', 'can', 'try', 'shadowing', 'basically', 'moves', 'so', ""'re"", 'doing', 'left', 'what', 'instructor', 'doing', 'left', ""'re"", 'facing', 'television', 'moves', 'are', 'matching', 'mirroring', 'shadowing', ""'re"", 'going', 'opposite', 'direction', ""'re"", 'facing', 'instructor', 'had', 'back', 'television', 'were', 'facing', 'away', 'instructor', 'other', 'words', 'instructor', 'are', 'facing', 'same', 'direction', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'called', 'shadowing', 'then', 'movement', 'directions', 'match', 'Hope', 'sense', 'So', 'anyway', 'get', 'bored', 'quickly', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'lopsided', 'workout', 'try', 'switching', 'mirroring', 'shadowing', 'even', 'things', 'out', 'extend', 'use', 'video']",N/A
