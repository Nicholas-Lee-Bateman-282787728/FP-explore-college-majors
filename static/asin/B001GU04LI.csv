The full set did not make it onto the DVD which is a shame. There is also very little bonus content. There are some minor lyric changes, but not a big deal. Still, this is a must have for any Live fan. The footage of the show is why you would buy it and they did a great job capturing the Live experience. The audio is great as well. I want to give it 5 out of 5 because the important things are here, but it doesn't quite deserve a perfect score.",4,Live finally live!,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,565,"['finally', 'get', 'live', 'DVD', 'Live', 'performance', 'was', 'wait', 'sadly', 'DVD', 'little', 'bit', 'short', 'full', 'set', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'DVD', 'shame', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'bonus', 'content', 'are', 'minor', 'lyric', 'changes', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'Still', 'must', 'have', 'Live', 'fan', 'footage', 'show', 'why', 'would', 'buy', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'Live', 'experience', 'audio', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'want', 'give', '5', '5', 'important', 'things', 'are', 'here', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deserve', 'perfect', 'score']",N/A

I gather the band is continuing without Eddie now (but to me that's like Van Halen without David Lee Roth)so this will be about the best you'll get from a really good band.Excellent band,interesting,very intimate venue, & an audience that's really into it make this a really good show. Video editing can be a little frenetic at times, but that's a pretty common complaint. I thought it was a little strange that Ed's brother played guitar with them throughout the whole show but because he's not an official member he was totally ignored during the editing. You just kept getting glimpses of someone up there playing with them. You had to read the credits at the end to make sense of it.Just a little wierd.On the whole, two thumbs up",5,Good Show,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,827,"['took', 'while', 'stumble', 'gem', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'search', ""'live"", '-good', 'luck', 'gather', 'band', 'continuing', 'Eddie', 'now', 'Van', 'Halen', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'best', ""'ll"", 'get', 'really', 'good', 'band.Excellent', 'band', 'interesting', 'very', 'intimate', 'venue', 'audience', 'really', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'Video', 'editing', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'frenetic', 'times', 'pretty', 'common', 'complaint', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'strange', 'Ed', 'brother', 'played', 'guitar', 'whole', 'show', 'not', 'official', 'member', 'was', 'totally', 'ignored', 'editing', 'just', 'kept', 'getting', 'glimpses', 'someone', 'there', 'playing', 'had', 'read', 'credits', 'end', 'make', 'sense', 'it.Just', 'little', 'wierd.On', 'whole', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A

I've been a fan of Live for fifteen years, so I was pretty excited to finally see a live DVD come out. After watching it several times, the only complaint I have is the quick-paced editing is a little too hectic at times. Also, it would have been nice to see ""Mystery"", ""Run To The Water"" and some other songs in the setlist. Other than that, it's a great DVD!
