The script was also written by Rick Schroder.""Black Cloud(2005)"" is about the personal struggles and triumphs of Navajo boxer Black Cloud. (Full name) Black Cloud (Eddie Spears) faces racism from the local residents and city police near the Navajo rez. Local Sheriff Powers (McGraw) knows about the personal struggles of the Navajo Nation people. And he sees Black Cloud as a survivor, so he gives Black Cloud the benefit of the doubt when he gets in trouble. The only outlet Black Cloud has is boxing. Boxing keeps Black Cloud out of trouble when it is so easy to find on the rez. When an Olympic scout (Peter Greene) sees Black Cloud fight on the boxing under-card of an arrogant Olympic hopeful Rocket Ray Tracey (Pooch Hall), he sees Black Cloud making the Olympic boxing team. But will Black Cloud's personal demons get the best of him? Black Cloud's father is an alcoholic. He has constant parties at his house and has no time for his son. So, Black Cloud seeks out his coach and mentor, Bud. (Russell Means)Black Cloud's girlfriend Sammi (Julia Jones) has a son by rodeo circuit, white bull rider Eddie. (Schroder) When Eddie tries to reunite with his ex, Sammie, Black Cloud's anger gets the best of him and he opens a can of whip ass on Eddie. Will this put an end to his Olympic shot?The character relationship and dialogue could have been developed more. The background, relationships and why Black Cloud does not trust the white man were not explained thoroughly. A lot of the stereotypical Native association is utilized like alcoholism, trust, mysticism and poverty. But this is the first time I've seen Native Hip Hop in a film. The typical hard partying and attitude came along with it. Native Hip Hop has been actually infiltrating and influencing the younger generation on the rez for many years. Whether that is good or bad can still be debated.The film shows the beauty of the Navajo Nation rez located at the four corners. Rick Schroder utilizes boxing coach Jimmy Gambin (Rocky, The Champ) to train the boxers. The boxing elements in the film are action packed and realistic.Recognizable Native actors include; Nathaniel Arcand (Jimmy), Saginaw Grant (Grandpa) and Branscombe Richmond (Peter). ""Seinfeld's"" Wayne Knight makes a special appearance as the special favor, white power monger Mr. Tipping.Rick Schroder (Little Ricky in Silver Spoons) utilizes his experiences from acting and growing up in the entertainment industry to help with filming. The DVD shows his potential as a director, but his script writing on this film could have been more polished.

The cinematography of the beautiful Canyon de Chelly is spectacular.  One has the feeling of a John Ford/John Wayne western at times.  Another plus is the wonderful company of indigenous actors.  Russell Means is a standout as the boxing coach.  Julia Jones is impressive as the single Mom who is in love with a troubled young man played by Eddie Spears. Spears does a good job as a mixed blood Indian youth in the midst of an identity crisis. Tim McGraw's music is an added plus to the film, and it works well. Although McGraw made his acting debut in the film, he seems very natural in the role of the sheriff.  The boxing scenes are very well done, thanks to an adviser who worked on Rocky, The Champ, and a lot of other films of that genre.

So when I made up my mind to order it, I had to rent it to see if I'd made the right choice. I'm glad I did, because this film touched me.Here's this young twenty-something year old Black Cloud who is trying to live a good life. He's a up and coming boxer who has this great girl and tries to make a honest and meaningful perspective on his life. Then he finds out that his veins flow the blood of white men who, from his point view, are the bain of existence because of what his people have suffered under the white man's reign. That's where self-destruction takes Black Cloud on an emotional rollercoaster, and he begins to make decisions that he'll eventually regret.Losing himself in what he has learned to be his doomed heritage, Black Cloud turns his back on everything that he once stood for. He quits boxing, breaks up with the love of his life, Sammie, and hangs with the crowd that were once losers in his eyes.With a drunk for a father, and noone else to turn to, he finally seeks advice about his mixed blood heritage from his grandfather who spiritually and emotionally guides him to the truth.As Black Cloud comes to terms with who he really is and accepts it, he begins to slowly pull his life back together.It definitelely wasn't what I expected. This film is much more to the eye when really studied. You'd definitely have to watch it more than once to get where its coming from. For a film that had a budget of just under a million dollars, I thought it was brilliant. The cinematography just made me want to be in the film myself. It was capturing and cast a new light on Native American acting.Good job, Mr. Schroeder!P.S. I'm hoping there will be a Black Cloud 2. I would like to know more about how Black Cloud copes with obstacles in the boxing world and what effects it may have on his relationship with Sammie.

899061,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0008FXSSS,Miles D. Moore,"[11, 12]","I'm a big fan of Rick Schroder's acting in such programs as ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" so I really wanted to like ""Black Cloud,"" his debut as a director/screenwriter, a lot more than I did. The film's not terrible, but it is something of a disappointment. To begin with, Schroder did himself no favors by making a boxing movie at the same time that two other actors-turned-directors, Clint Eastwood and Ron Howard, released veritable masterpieces of that genre. And then, though Schroder the director shows confidence and visual flair, Schroder the screenwriter doesn't seem quite sure of the story he wants to tell. Does he want a rousing boxing flick in which the underdog triumphs a' la ""Rocky,"" or a searing indictment of the racism and dead-end prospects young Native Americans face? Frankly, I found the second story by far the more effective of the two, particularly as acted by Eddie Spears as the titular character, a young Navajo boxer consumed by frustration and hatred of the white man's world. (His hatred, at least in the context of the movie, is thoroughly justified; every major white character except one in this movie is an irredeemable monster.) When he sticks to Black Cloud and his plight, Schroder works strongly and sharply, and he elicits excellent performances not only from Spears as Black Cloud, but also from Julia Jones as Black Cloud's girlfriend Sammi and Nathaniel Arcand as his best pal Jimmy. (Schroder also contributes a sharp performance as Eddie, Sammi's vindictive ex-boyfriend and the father of her child.) But these scenes never really mesh with the boxing portions of the movie, so that the entire film in the end seems soft and diffuse. Schroder's directing of his actors is uneven; Russell Means is a little shaky as Black Cloud's boxing coach, and Tim McGraw is downright bad as the bigoted local sheriff. Also, Schroder makes the mistake of segueing into Navajo mysticism, which produces some embarrassingly awkward screen moments, particularly toward the end.

Schroeder is to be commended for his efforts.  The low budget is evident throughout, but the acting is solid and the message an important one.  Even if it is a bit overwrought, one of the greatest issues for American Indians today is struggling with their identity and where they fit in this world.  What some may see here as melodramatic racism is actually a very real stigma that many ""mixed-bloods"" have to face.  In the end, this facet of the film makes it an important one, and a decent addition to the woefully inadequate genre of Native American film.Eddie Spears is excellent - I hope to see him get more work.

899067,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,B0008FXSSS,Wolfe Moffat,"[0, 0]","Who would've thought that Rick Shroder from ""Silver Spoons"" would come out with a film of his own? That deserves a lot of credit. He's all grown up now! And to boot, he stars a little in his own film. You take boxing, a troubled Navajo Indian with a chip on his shoulder, and ""Black Cloud"" is what this is all about. With Tim McGraw added to the cast, it really isn't half-bad. The boxing action was decent. But to me it was rather predictable.You have Black Cloud, a great boxer who is given a chance to try out for the Olympic Boxing Team. But Black Cloud is just that, and he has the inner demons to prove it. His insecurity is something that rings a bell early on. And along with the demons come adversity. Black Cloud faces it, and at times he gets into trouble. But along with his troubled soul, he has great potential. The question is, will he persevere? Will he be the warrior he knows he can be? Responsibility is to be taken, and somebody has to step up at some point.Some might want to refer to this as, ""The American Indian Rocky!"" Come on! You might have the same results, granted. And while this is good, it is overly predictable. Being directed by Rick Shroder, talk about your silver spoons! The ending wasn't that original, and it was indeed too perfect. My wife and I looked at each other at one point during a certain fight. Then we said, ""If his eyes rolled back like that in a professional fight, let alone an amateur fight, that fight would be stopped!"" We had a good laugh at that one. But it was a good show. Not altogether a throw away. If it is possible for Rick Shroder to take that SILVER SPOON out of his mouth, he might make some great films one day.
