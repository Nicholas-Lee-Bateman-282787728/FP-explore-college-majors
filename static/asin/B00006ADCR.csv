Though it doesn't turn out the way she wants it to, it could have ended much worse. The next episodes involve some of the wierdest scenes in the anime. Seta, Naru's old tutor, returns to Japan and Kitsune does everything in her power to keep the two from meeting, with hilarious results. Keitaro, meanwhile, has been employed by Seta as an assistant, and has to deal with Seta's bratty daughter Sara McDougal. In the next episode, Sara is forced to stay at the Hinata Apartments while Seta's woking on an archaeological dig, and gets into all sorts of trouble. I won't say anything other than an army of robot turtles is involved somehow.The final episode is the best one. It's summer, and the residents of the Apartments go to the beach to work at the Hinata Seaside Teahouse. They perform the play ""Journey to the West"" (the play that Dragon Ball was loosely based on, by the way) and end up destroying the teahouse. Seta finds them a new place to perform the play if he can be in it, and Seta and Motoko end up having an eye-blurring fight that is awesome to watch.Despite the fact that my favorite character only appears in a flashback of sorts in this volume, it's still awfully good.",5,A trip to the beach,1041552000,"01 3, 2003",2003,1305,"['volume', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'bizarre', 'parts', 'manga', 'Shinobu', 'wanting', 'get', 'first', 'kiss', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'much', 'worse', 'next', 'episodes', 'involve', 'wierdest', 'scenes', 'anime', 'Seta', 'Naru', 'old', 'tutor', 'returns', 'Japan', 'Kitsune', 'everything', 'power', 'keep', 'two', 'meeting', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Keitaro', 'meanwhile', 'been', 'employed', 'Seta', 'assistant', 'deal', 'Seta', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'McDougal', 'next', 'episode', 'Sara', 'forced', 'stay', 'Hinata', 'Apartments', 'Seta', 'woking', 'archaeological', 'dig', 'sorts', 'trouble', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'other', 'army', 'robot', 'turtles', 'involved', 'somehow.The', 'final', 'episode', 'best', 'one', 'summer', 'residents', 'Apartments', 'go', 'beach', 'work', 'Hinata', 'Seaside', 'Teahouse', 'perform', 'play', 'Journey', 'West', 'play', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'destroying', 'teahouse', 'Seta', 'new', 'place', 'perform', 'play', 'can', 'be', 'Seta', 'Motoko', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'eye-blurring', 'fight', 'awesome', 'watch.Despite', 'fact', 'favorite', 'character', 'only', 'flashback', 'sorts', 'volume', 'still', 'awfully', 'good']",N/A
708334,A28RFOF6EY42F4,B00006ADCR,"""asu-san""","[3, 4]","Number four in the Love Hina series continues the antics from the previous issues, I'm happy to say.In this release, Shinobu's curiosity and Su's technological creations combine in a kiss fest that ends in the birth of a friendship. Mr. Seta, Naru's old tutor/crush, appears with a young girl who calls him ""dad"", and Kitsune attempts to keep Naru from learning about his return.  (Sara, the girl with Seta, treats Keitaro like a punching bag most of the time.)  As you would expect, Naru and Seta are reunited, and Keitaro faces another hurdle between he and Naru.  He, of course, makes the best of it by revealing that Naru loves Mr. Seta?  This leads to a dramatic confrontation between the rivals during a Urashima family stage production.  In the end, the hero (Keitaro) doesn't save the girl (Naru). She escapes and clobbers him, which is as it should be. Afterall, they are in love right?Another wonderfully funny installment with more silly escapades and crazy situations tempered by the relationships between the characters.

It starts with Shinobu wondering what a kiss would be like. Turns out the first person she kisses isn't exact the person she wanted. They intoduce another character into the series. Seta was Naru's old tutor in high school and she had a major crush on him. The problem is watching her act around her professor and around Keitaro. The last episode has got to be one of the most hillarious episodes on the dvd. When Keitaro and Naru do a play lets just say that Keitaro(being the klutz that he is) does something and ends up getting knocked out for it.

Seta is a weird character and adds friction between Keitero and Naru plus gets on Kitsune's nerves. In this volume, there are 4 hilarious episodes. The first one is some-what based on the manga story where Shinobu explores the deadly and confusing world of kissing with hilarious results. (The whole episode basically spoofs Japanese teeny-bopper movies) The other episodes are basically Kitsune trying to hide the fact that Seta is in town but Naru finds out anyways.
