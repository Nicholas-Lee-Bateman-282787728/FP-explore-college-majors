Coincidentally, this moronic behaviour is a genetic ""gift"" that runs in his family.Masters of Disguise have been in the Disguisey family bloodline for years, but Pistachio has been kept ignorant about it for a quarter century (no explaination is given)- but one day his Grandpa breaks the news that he is a ""disguiser"" and he becomes an apprentice Master Of Disguise, Level 1 (out of 1000 levels). Wow.As happens in movies like this, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by the predictably villainous megalomaniac Devlin Bowman (ST:TNG's Brent Spiner), who always breaks wind after giving his predictably villainous laugh. But kidnapping isn't challenging enough; so Bowman is also out to steal the ""World's most secret treasures"" including the U.S Constitution, which aren't so secret because anyone with half a brain (!MEEEE!) will have heard of them.MASTER OF DISGUISE is an obvious attempt to give Carvey his own AUSTIN POWERS type franchise. Could he be jealous of Mike Myer's success? Just check out Carvey's SHREK impersonation.  As subtle as a sledgehammer. He's just not funny. Ditto his Dubya- his George Senior in OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS was pretty funny, but that was then; this is now.MASTER OF DISGUISE ought to appeal to kids under 10 (or people with an IQ 10 or under), who may appreciate the dopiness- several gags are stolen directly from BILL AND TED and ACE VENTURA. There are also unfunny digs at THE EXORCIST and JAWS.There are better ways to kill 80 minutes: like picking lint out of your navel, tweezing your nose hairs or subjecting youself to a marathon screening of MASH re-runs. However, if you consider John Leguizamo's THE PEST to be the pinnacle of comedic brilliance then this movie is for you. If you absolutely MUST watch MOD, then look out for cameos from Bo Derek and Jesse Ventura.Extras include commentary by the Director and Carvey, alternate & deleted scenes (They'd have been better off deleting the entire movie) introduced by Carvey in Disguisey's stupid Turtle Guy role, 3 featurettes: one an ego piece where one of the co-players describes MOD as ""WIZARD OF OZ meets ALICE IN WONDERLAND"", plus the cast and crew kissing up to Carvey and saying how brilliant he is, and finally a music video by a band you've probably never heard of, and won't care about anyway.

The sad part is the running fart joke is funnier than anything Carvey or anyone else does in this movie.  I was actually looking forward to the ""Turtleclub"" scene, but after hearing Carvey say ""turtle"" about 12 times and then a cheap CGI effect where he actually ""snaps"" a club member's nose off and then spits it back onto his face had me going ""huh?""

The script is written by Carvey & Harris Goldberg (the guy who wrote Deuce Bigalow, which is actually funny).

This movie co-stars Austin Wolff, Kenan Thompson,  Gabriel Pimentel, Jesse Ventura, Michael Johnson, Bo Derek, Jessica Simpson, Buddy Bolton, Edie McClurg, Vincent Riverside, Michael Bailey Smith, Maria Canals, Mark Devine and Jay Johnston. This movie is LMFAO hilarious. Dana Carvey has attempted to create a vehicle for his career. Just like how Mike Myers did with AUSTIN POWERS and Jim Carrey with ACE VENTURA. This vehicle epic failed to capture true film critics. This movie shows Dana Carvey's talent of impersonating celebrities and movie characters. The best disguises include Turtle Man, Terry Suave, Quint, Al Pacino, Constable Mueller, Mayor Maynot and Prince Lalijama of the Ringidingi Heights near Bombay, Calcutta, and New Delhi, India, India, India, India. The movie is one of my favorites but critics and movie goers did not care for its immature sense of humor. Some of my favorite scenes include a Disguisey ancestor dressed as President Abe Lincoln dancing to I LIKE TO MOVE IT, the SHREK immitation (especially if you listen to it in French) and I will leave it at that in order to see for yourselves. This is an article on THE MASTER OF DISGUISE from Wikipedia:Many critics considered the plot sophomoric, compounding the fact that there were several ""disguises"" that would clearly not be recognized by youngsters (Tony Montana from SCARFACE, for example). In March 2007, aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes ranked the movie as the 18th worst-reviewed movie of the 00's decade, with a 2% fresh rating.

729556,A2GYX971VETQBV,B00007JMEA,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[14, 20]","Despite the fact that MASTER OF DISGUISE has an 80 minute run-time, it is actually quite less if you cut out all of the ""extra"" garbage they give you during the credits.  Yet, despite the fact that the actual film is something like 65 minutes, I barely managed to get through it.  It is a strange phenomenon: all that a film has to do is entertain me (reasonably) for an hour.  Yet, MASTER OF DISGUISE fails miserably.  I mean, I have managed to keep myself entertained watching the Discovery channel and such.  But, during this film, I kept looking for a reason to go get some more popcorn.  Thus, as my title explains, I think that this movie is a close approximation to what burning for eternity will be like in the eternal fires of Dante's Inferno: non-stop showings of MASTER OF DISGUISE in which I can't leave the theater or fall asleep.There is nothing to like about this movie.  It is dumb on a stick.  Of course, I did enjoy a couple of Carvey's impersonations, but I would have rather seen them developed a bit more in a stand-up act.  Why anyone ever thought they could turn this shell of a movie into a film is beyond me.Perhaps the funniest scene comes at the end when Carvey looks at us, dead-center, and asks us why we're still watching the film (after the credits).  Okay...it's been done before.  But before I reached for the remote, I found myself uttering: ""good point, Dana.""  Now, why couldn't everyone have put me out my misery earlier by having this clip pop up ""before"" the film.  That would have saved me some time.Don't watch MASTER OF DISGUISE.  Don't buy it.

729559,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00007JMEA,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[1, 5]","&quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; is a terrible, terrible, movie. I don't see how this movie can appeal to anybody, including children to whom this movie is aimed at. I hated it. There was no point for it to be released in the movies, and it could have been a direct to video movie, and it wouldn't have ever made a difference. it is only about 65 minutes long, with a good 15 minutes worth of credits that just have outtakes and deleted scenes. Without the credits, this could be one of the shortest movies ever made, the lenght of the silent movies back in 1910. The biggest problem with &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; is that it doesn't work on any level. The story is just plain dumb, the acting is horrible, and the movie is filled with A list actors, none of them which would make me want to put them back on the A list. I used to think Dana Carvey was funny before this movie came out. I have only given four other movies one star. &quot;The Sum of All Fears,&quot; &quot;Bridjet Jone's Diary,&quot; &quot;A Mighty Wind,&quot; and &quot;House of the Dead.&quot; For this to be among those movies must be badd. I probably laughed twice during this movie, and even those jokes were things that I wouldn't laugh at again.The story is about Pistachio Disguisey who is a young man who works as a waiter at his parents Italian resturant. He lives with his father Frabbrizio and his mother, who he one days wishes to marry a women just like her. That women is Sophia, who reminds him just of her. What Pistachio doesn't know is that his father and his grandfather and all of his ancesters are masters of disguises. They could transform into anything they want to. His father foiled the plans of Devlin Bowman years ago, and now he's back from prision for revenge. He kidnaps Pistachio's parents, and uses the father to disguise himself as famous people to steal famous things, and he uses the mother to cook. Pistachio becomes scared because he doesn't know what to do, and he gets a visit from his grandfather who begins to train him to become a master of disguise. Grandpa tells Pistachio that he needs a person to help him, and he uses Jennifer, who needs the work. Jennifer and Pistachio go to rescue his parents from Devlin Bowman, which forces him to use many different disguises to do so.Yes, I know, the plot could sound appealing for people, including kids, but the movie is nothing but boring. It was just a terrible movie. There was one scene, in the commericals part of it is shown, where Pistachio is dressed up as a turtle. The kids in the theatre knew the scene from the commericals, but nobody laughed at it. It may have sounded funny in the commerical, but in the moving itself, it just didn't work. It was a stupid reason to show a joke like that, and the scene contains him biting off a person's nose. That was just plain stupid. Nobody laughed at that either. &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; is a good movie to watch if you want to be bored, and you want to cut your arm off so you can have something to throw around as something to do.

I wanted to like this film a lot, and I tried to, but it didn't quite get there.Mild mannered foreign waiter Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) doesn't know that for hundreds of years his family have been Masters of Disguise. It is a little suspicious that he got urges to mock and imitate people growing up, but his father, a retired spy, brushes it off. There's no way that Pistachio is going to lead the dangerous life of a spy, so his secret powers must remain secret. One night, Pistachio's father is kidnapped by a master thief (Brent Spiner), who forces him to use his powers of disguise to steal famous artefacts from history (the American constitution, the two ruby slippers from Wizard of Oz, etc). To save Pistachio's Dad, Granfather Disguisey comes to Pistachio, teaching him the secrets to being a Master of Disguise. Soon, Pisatachio is a level 1 apprentice, and can be all sorts of people. Will this be enough to rescue his dad?It seemed like a really good idea for a movie, get Dana Carvey to dress up as all sorts of people and things. The film does play a lot of its own cheesiness for laughs, and I appreciate that, but a lot of the impersonations and jokes kind of fall flat. It was a bit weird that Pistachio's ""default setting"" was a man with an accent, who was a bit odd to begin with. There basically is no normal character Dana plays, and I would have liked to see him play himself, just to see the contrast between him and his characters.My favorite disguise of Dana/Pistachio's is probably the Turtle Man, who's this bald headed man in a big round suit like a turtle shell, with a pointy upper lip, and a habit of saying ""Turtle"" in a Kermit the Frog kind of voice. In a fight scene, he bites off a persons nose, leaving bare skin on the enemies face, which was so silly I had to laugh.Special features include some making of features, with interviews with the cast, crew as well as Dana Carvey himself, and a music video.Not the best comedy film in the world, but there's enough goofiness in it to keep it together.

As an adult movie, 'Master of Disguise' has no disguise; this movie ranks with 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' as one of the worst movies ever.  The jokes are weak and childish.  The plot is a stinker.  Even the movie's weak attempts at insider jokes and satire are weak, at best.  There is a brief scene that's supposed to be homage to 'The Exorcist,' and yet there is no humor in it.  The 'Jaws' homage is likely the homage that works the best, and even it is weak.  Adults will find this movie tedious and boring, and often obnoxious.Children, on the other hand, seem to love this movie.  Apparently there is something about the humor that they get, and we do not.  While I was bored with the turtle scene, as an example, children seem to find it hilarious.  I admit, I've tried to understand the humor in this scene, and still do not understand it, but children seem to find it very funny.  Let your child between the ages of about 4 or 5 years old and about 10 watch this movie and compare their reaction to yours.While I did not care for this movie, there were two actors that I thought performed well.  Harold Gould as Grandfather Disguisey played the part just as I thought he should, and did the part well.  Jennifer Esposito was excellent as Jennifer Baker, and several of her lines at least made me smile rather than groan.  In many cases the puzzled, sometimes tolerant expression on her face matched my own.  I believe Jennifer was able to rise above her role and the circumstances to provide the one shining point in this movie, at least for us adults.For adults, I rate this movie 2 stars.  For children, I rate this movie 4 stars.

Not since &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; have I yearned for coherency and flow so much. The film's humor isn't offensive, but it may as well be. &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; is so devoid of laughs that it hurts trying to pretend it's a comedy. For the record, Dana Carvey is funny. There are even parts in this film where he is funny, but these are in short spurts and come off as only hints to just how much of a laugh riot he can be. In other words, his talent is wasted. I can't really describe the plot, because it was too simple and insipid to really understand. No two scenes make any sense or have any continuity with each other. Many of them have Carvey speaking in a ridiculously annoying voice. The main character in this film makes Jar Jar Binks look like Hamlet by comparison. Brent Spiner looks embarrassed to be the bad guy in this film. I hope he was paid a lot, because this role was the worst possible character he could have ever played. I wish they got someone else to do it, because Spiner's reputation is tarnished with this movie. I know a few children that like this movie, but I just don't understand why. Sure it has a PG rating, but this is because the film's &quot;obsene&quot; humor never rises above fart jokes. Speaking of which, never before in any movie has a fart noise seemed so unfunny and so desperate for a laugh. Seriously, bathroom humor is easy to make funny. This movie goes out of its way to make it unfunny. I'm probably wasting my time here, but it's just because I can't bear the thought of one more person seeing this movie.

This movie is so mind-numbingly, incongruously bad and contained so many jokes that lumbered off the screen and tanked pitifully that it has become, for me, the worst film I've ever seen.""Hey! I like Dana Carvey! It can't be THAT bad!"" I hear you ask. So what's wrong with it?First of all, the opening credits drone on for about five minutes, possibly because there wasn't enough movie to fill 80 minutes. If this is a children's movie, certainly the golden rule would be to grab their attention from the get-go. I can't imagine young kids being riveted to the screen watching credits drone on and on. Even myself, an adult, had already lost interest by the time the movie started.Second, the impersonations and characters Carvey does, which are the crux of the comedy of the movie, are pointless. He's written the film around things he can play, rather than writing and story and finding ways of putting characters in. So we're left to watch things like his Al Pacino 'Scarface' impersonation (is this a children's movie??) or his 'Turtle Man'. The latter is an inexorable five minute turkey where Carvey dresses up as a Turtle and walks around saying ""turtle"". Sound hilarious enough for you? As a finish to the Turtle scene, Carvey bites the nose off a rude party guest (the nose simply disappears from the man's face), spits it back on (it reattaches itself somehow) and then proceeds to have some sort of paroxysm or embolism on the floor (???[]?). His impersonations simply consist of inhabiting a character and then spewing whatever dialogue you would expect. For example, what do you think Al Pacino says? ""Say hello to my little friend!"" What do you think a dapper British gent says? ""What what, old chum... (insert other stereotypical British colloquialisms)."" And then there's a ludicrous poolside George Bush Jnr impersonation. Why is it in the movie? Most probably because Dana Carvey is good at impersonating him, and not for any other reason.The dialogue is terrible. The acting is abysmal. The jokes are tired and predictable. For example, the bad guy, played by Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek) flatulates whenever he breaks into a maniacal laugh. That may be funny once. But twice? No. Three times? FOUR times? FIVE? then SIX, SEVEN AND EIGHT TIMES????? It could have at least been left out on one occasion just to stump the audience.I can't see how children would enjoy this movie. Perhaps they would. Maybe really, really little kids. There's so many other movies out there they would prefer, like Hook, The Iron Giant, Toy Story... just about every children's movie ever made. I like those movies as well.

The dichotomy of the extreme earnestness and ridiculous behaviour coming from Carver's character is similar to Tom Green's performance in Freddy Got Fingered. The use of such a non-contemporary concept is another vital part of the film's appeal. The historical fantasy of the family history adds an enchanting backdrop to the ridiculous preceedings. ""He thinks your name is pistachios"". ""That is my name"". It doesn't have a strong narrative, but I don't think that's something that detracts from what the movie is.

Zwick,"[1, 4]","""The Master of Disguise"" raises - and indeed answers - the question of whether or not it is possible for a movie that bills itself as a ""comedy"" to run from beginning to end without offering a single funny moment.  (The answer, by the way, is, yes, it can be done).  Thus, while his ""Wayne's World"" partner, Mike Myers, is out there making both a fortune and an indelible impression on pop culture with his ""Austin Powers"" franchise, poor Dana Carvey is reduced to appearing in disastrous vehicles like this one.  Now don't get me wrong.  I love Carvey's work on ""Saturday Night Live,"" especially his impersonations of many of the major political figures of our time.  However, Carvey's manic, over-the-top style is, apparently, a whole lot easier to take in small doses.  Watching him mug, cavort and pratfall his way through a laughless script for the better part of an hour and a half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing to watch.Stealing much of its concept from ""The Mask,"" ""The Master of Disguise"" involves Carvey in some nonsense about a family of crime fighters who are able to magically don all sorts of disguises at a moment's notice.  This allows the filmmakers to enlist the aid of a number of real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances, in the misguided belief, most likely, that this was going to be a fun, entertaining movie comedy.  Boy, were they misled.  Actually, I have rarely seen a film in which the jokes, ""bits"" and setups fall as consistently flat as they do here.  To get a general notion of the level of humor in this film, please note that the running gag involves one character's tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence.  It isn't funny the first time it happens and, believe me, it is even less funny the fourth, fifth (or is it sixth?) time around.In addition to the celebrity walk-ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here.  So is Carvey when you come right down to it.  But then Carvey wrote the screenplay, so he HAS to be a good sport about it.  After all, he handed HIMSELF this material.  I hope the other actors trapped in this mess at least got paid well for their endeavors.The only good news is that, in the closing credits, we get to see many of the scenes, lines and characters that were, apparently, filmed, then dropped from the final product.

729593,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007JMEA,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","&quot;Master of Disguise&quot; features ex-Waynes World and SNL member Dana Carvey as an Italian waiter Pistachio Disguisey, whose families have long been protected the world from evil using the art of disguise.  Pistachio himself is not aware of this family secret until one day his father and mother are kidnapped by a megalomaniac villain Devlin Bowman.The story above is nothing but an excuse for showcasing the impersonations by Dana Carvey.  He disguises himself as George W Bush, Al Pacino (Latin version), and a cherry pie.  Surely some of them are funny at first, but many adult fans soon find him irritating or even pathetic.The reason is that you cannot make movies in this way.  The film is only 80 minuites, and that includes very extended end credits including deleted scenes and outtakes.  This fact betrays that the film is too thin in contents, but they should have known that from the first.Of course, kids might think it is funny (and it is notable that the film collected more than $40 million in USA alone, which is a considerable figure).  But think this way.  The opening scene of the film has Bo Derek (yes, that's her!) as a cameo.  I don't think that kids would get it (not many of them recognize her).  SO, for whom is this film made?Carvey impersonating Robert Shaw (from &quot;Jaws&quot;) is certainly funny, and he is good at it even though the gag would fly over the head of the kids, who would rather prefer &quot;Turtle Guy.&quot;  And many adults in turn would find it very ... boring.The film is based on a misguided idea -- impersonation, which means playing someone else.  Dana Carvey should have found his own voice first.  Like Mike Meyers who found in Austin Powers; like Harrison Ford in Solo and Indie; like Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels and dangling hair-gel.  Without a good character you cannot sustain the whole 80 minutes and the audiences' attention.  Impersonation is alright as long as you do it in your own way.  Now see TV shows, and many non-professionals do pretty good impersonations.  But Mike Meyers created Austin and Dr.Evil which none of them could not produce.You see supporting cast such as Brent Spiner (Data of &quot;Star Trek&quot;) and Jennifer Esposito.  They are sadly wasted, both in a very embarrassingly underwritten role.  And the cameos like Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, and Jessica Simpson do not help at all.I know Dana Carvey underwent several surgeries in the past several years before making this film.  I know my review would sound harsh, but you cannot send a wrong message, saying that this is very funny.  It is not.  His fans should see his earlier film &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; he made about ten years ago, instead.  That is not a masterpice, but far better and enjoyable.",2,Painful To Watch; See &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; Instead,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,2764,"['quot', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'quot', 'ex-Waynes', 'World', 'SNL', 'member', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'Italian', 'waiter', 'Pistachio', 'Disguisey', 'families', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'protected', 'world', 'evil', 'using', 'art', 'disguise', 'Pistachio', 'not', 'aware', 'family', 'secret', 'one', 'day', 'father', 'mother', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'megalomaniac', 'villain', 'Devlin', 'Bowman.The', 'story', 'above', 'nothing', 'excuse', 'showcasing', 'impersonations', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Latin', 'version', 'cherry', 'pie', 'Surely', 'are', 'funny', 'first', 'many', 'adult', 'fans', 'soon', 'find', 'irritating', 'even', 'pathetic.The', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'movies', 'way', 'film', 'only', '80', 'minuites', 'very', 'extended', 'end', 'credits', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'fact', 'film', 'too', 'thin', 'contents', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'first.Of', 'course', 'kids', 'might', 'think', 'funny', 'notable', 'film', 'collected', 'more', '40', 'million', 'USA', 'alone', 'considerable', 'figure', 'think', 'way', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'yes', 'cameo', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'would', 'get', 'not', 'many', 'recognize', 'SO', 'whom', 'film', 'made', 'Carvey', 'impersonating', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'quot', 'Jaws', 'quot', 'certainly', 'funny', 'good', 'even', 'gag', 'would', 'fly', 'head', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'prefer', 'quot', 'Turtle', 'Guy.', 'quot', 'many', 'adults', 'turn', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'boring.The', 'film', 'based', 'misguided', 'idea', 'impersonation', 'playing', 'someone', 'else', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'own', 'voice', 'first', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'who', 'found', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Solo', 'Indie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'dangling', 'hair-gel', 'good', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'sustain', 'whole', '80', 'minutes', 'audiences', 'attention', 'Impersonation', 'alright', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'own', 'way', 'Now', 'see', 'TV', 'shows', 'many', 'non-professionals', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'impersonations', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'created', 'Austin', 'Dr.Evil', 'none', 'could', 'not', 'produce.You', 'see', 'supporting', 'cast', 'such', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Data', 'quot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'quot', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'are', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'very', 'embarrassingly', 'underwritten', 'role', 'cameos', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'Paula', 'Abdul', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'all.I', 'know', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'underwent', 'several', 'surgeries', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'making', 'film', 'know', 'review', 'would', 'sound', 'harsh', 'can', 'not', 'send', 'wrong', 'message', 'saying', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'fans', 'should', 'see', 'earlier', 'film', 'quot', 'Opportunity', 'Knocks', 'quot', 'made', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'instead', 'not', 'masterpice', 'far', 'better', 'enjoyable']",The Master of Disguise VHS

After all, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE is not a great movie. In fact from a cynical, adult perspect many would say that it is a terrible movie. However, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE wasn't made for cynical adults. It was made for the youth of America. Sure there are references that only those over 18 will get (e.g. the allusions to The Sopranos), but those were thrown in to appease parents who would be watching this film with their children. Therefore, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE is brilliant work.Brilliant? Brilliant? Yes, brilliant. Dana Carvey has made a movie that has made him an icon for a whole new generation of Americans. The popularity of this movie among youth is astounding; I haven't heard so much buzz with the youth of America since HOLES (the book, not the movie) came out. Kids all across the country are quoting this movie. Even though many adults have not allowed themselves to enjoy the movie, lines from THE MASTER OF DISGUISE will become a permanent part of the American lexicon. Even though the movie didn't do very well at the box office, based off the success of the video and how popular the movie is with youth I wouldn't doubt if a sequel will soon be in the works.Based upon the usual technical aspects of filmmaking and the things that make a good movie, I wouldn't rate this movie above 3 stars.
