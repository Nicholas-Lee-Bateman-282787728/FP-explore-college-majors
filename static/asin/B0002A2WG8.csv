829161,A74CIFZOL7QEF,B0002A2WG8,"A. Hamilton ""Ace Hamilton""","[16, 24]","The real problem with these new Stooges releases is that Columbia has used the excuse of the colorization to present only four shorts, some of which have been released on other DVDs previously. Furthermore these retail for 24.99 while most others containing more shorts retail for 19.99 so we are asked to pay more for less. I bought both of them used for under $10 each and suggest you look for them used if you must have them. I have already seen many used copies in stores, probably because there are many disappointed buyers. Advantages of buying used: you'll pay less and Columbia won't make any money off the sale. The sad fact is that if these sell well enough this is all we can expect in the future.As for the colorization: it may be the best I've seen, which is still pretty awful. Very unrealistic hues, jarring color combinations, unpleasant pastels. If you know anything about film you'll know that if the filmmakers had made these in color they would not have looked anything like this. What is the point of researching what the actual color of a prop was on Ebay (see the self-congratulatory featurette)? The props and costumes were chosen for how they would photograph in black and white. They would have done better to just try and make everything look as natural as possible.I can't help thinking the choice of the stooges for launching this new colorization line is an odd one. If there is any B&W; material that seems almost immune to the objections of people who won't watch black and white it's the stooges. My five-year-old daughter loves the stooges in black and white and so do many people who refuse to watch B&W; movies.In summary because of the colorization we get less entertainment.But if you find color more important than laughs, this disc is for you.",1,Fewer shorts for more money,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1783,"['real', 'problem', 'new', 'Stooges', 'Columbia', 'used', 'excuse', 'colorization', 'present', 'only', 'four', 'shorts', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'other', 'DVDs', 'previously', 'retail', '24.99', 'most', 'others', 'containing', 'more', 'shorts', 'retail', '19.99', 'are', 'asked', 'pay', 'more', 'less', 'bought', 'used', '10', 'suggest', 'look', 'used', 'must', 'have', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'many', 'used', 'copies', 'stores', 'probably', 'are', 'many', 'disappointed', 'buyers', 'Advantages', 'buying', 'used', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'less', 'Columbia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'sale', 'sad', 'fact', 'sell', 'well', 'enough', 'can', 'expect', 'future.As', 'colorization', 'may', 'be', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Very', 'unrealistic', 'hues', 'jarring', 'color', 'combinations', 'unpleasant', 'pastels', 'know', 'anything', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'made', 'color', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'looked', 'anything', 'What', 'point', 'researching', 'what', 'actual', 'color', 'prop', 'was', 'Ebay', 'see', 'self-congratulatory', 'featurette', 'props', 'costumes', 'were', 'chosen', 'how', 'would', 'photograph', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'try', 'make', 'everything', 'look', 'as', 'natural', 'possible.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'choice', 'stooges', 'launching', 'new', 'colorization', 'line', 'odd', 'one', 'B', 'W', 'material', 'almost', 'immune', 'objections', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'stooges', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'stooges', 'black', 'white', 'so', 'do', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'refuse', 'watch', 'B', 'W', 'summary', 'colorization', 'get', 'less', 'entertainment.But', 'find', 'color', 'more', 'important', 'laughs', 'disc']",N/A

829163,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0002A2WG8,Anyechka,"[2, 3]","Leaving aside the issue of colorisation for a moment, it is great to see the classics 'You Nazty Spy!' and 'An Ache in Every Stake' finally on DVD.  It's also great to see the second-tier classic 'No Census, No Feeling' also represented here.  However, the joy over that is quickly put into perspective by the fact that there are only 4 shorts on this disc (with one of them a repeat) and that there are colorised versions also available.  Although at least the B&W; originals are also available (and are in beautifully restored prints), together with a ""Play All"" button, a feature that was nonexistent on all but a handful of the previous discs in this series.  The shorts themselves:'Violent Is the Word for Curly' (1938) is a classic, though I do understand why some people feel it's a bit overrated.  It does sort of have the feel of being more like a series of loosely connected sketches than one smoothly flowing whole.  However, all of the individual scenes themselves are great, and it's generally felt that this was the best of the shorts the great Charley Chase directed for the boys.  Although as great as this short is, it makes no sense for it to have been selected for inclusion here, seeing as it was already on 'All the World's a Stooge.''No Census, No Feeling' (1940) might not perhaps be one of their topmost classics, but it is very strong and funny regardless, perhaps one of their second-tier classics.  There's not a dull or wasted scene or moment, with everything flowing so perfectly from start to finish.  It's also a joy to see (and hear!) the wonderful oft-forgotten silent comedian Max Davidson in a bit role, as the shopkeeper.  However, there are some dated jokes and references in this one; I don't think that most people under a certain age, unless they're already very into the Golden Age of Hollywood and classic films, with more than just a casual passing interest, will know who Will Hays was (the head of the Production Code and an infamous censor), and there's also a joke about the changing date of Thanksgiving (in 1939 its observance was set for Thursdays).'You Nazty Spy!' (1940) is an absolute bona-fide classic, without a doubt one of the best they ever did.  Even though 'The Great Dictator' was already in production when this was made, it was released before Chaplin's masterpiece, a fact that a lot of people don't seem to be aware of.  This was the first Hollywood film to spoof and ridicule the Nazis, and seeing as the three stars of the short, in addition to the director, were all Jewish, this was personal.  It took a lot of guts to make such a film when America was still in the grip of isolationism and didn't really fully look upon Hitler as a full-out enemy or threat just yet.  It's a brilliant satire and also absolutely hilarious, a dead-on spoof of not just the Nazis but all fascists and dictators in general.  I also love how much Yiddish was used during this film (most people probably thought it was just gibberish or pretend German, not some rather funny and witty wordplay in a real language).'An Ache in Every Stake' (1941) is also routinely held up as one of their most classic.  This one also flows perfectly from start to finish, not a dull or wasted moment, with too many great scenes and moments to count (such as the shaving of the ice, the attempted delivery of the ice up that massive flight of stairs, and Vernon Dent's misadventures with the birthday cake).  It seems like a lot of fans have this one in their personal Top 10 lists.  However, it is a little lame how some of the ""ice blocks"" in the wagon are so obviously solid boxes (which have somehow magickally transformed themselves into actual ice by the time they reach the top of the stairs).  That's just as lazy as the numerous times when the faces of stunt doubles were clearly exposed!Overall, the material is great, but the execution isn't.  It makes no sense for one of the shorts to be a repeat (if they were going to repeat anything, it should have been the full-length 'Three Little Beers'), and for there to be only 4 shorts.  That's asking the consumer to pay much more for much less.  And the colorisation may look more realistic than the stuff that was done in the Eighties, but that's still not saying much.  The self-congratulatory featurette misses the point.  Doing all of the research in the world into what colors might have been used still doesn't change the fact that seeing a B&W; classic with Chroma Color dubbed in looks fake and artificial, and even wrong.  There are just some people you can only ever imagine in B&W;, who exist in B&W; for all time, and to just imagine them in color seems wrong.  These colorised discs sold predictably poorly not because people weren't interested in the material, but because they knew what a rip-off it was, and didn't want colorisation.  (I had no problems with any toggle icon; it seems as though that's an issue with specific DVD players or the control menu, not something that automatically appears on every screen and won't go away.)  Overall, this is great material that deserved so much better.  It's not right that the two classics on this disc should FINALLY make their DVD debut, only to be rammed onto a misfire like this.",3,A miscalculated misfire,1156204800,"08 22,

829167,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B0002A2WG8,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[9, 10]","Regardless of the questionable quality as well as quantity of what's on here, I really wanted to praise this DVD for it's inclusion of the brilliantly done short called ""You Nazty Spy"" which does a spine-splittingly hilarious job of spoofing Nazi Germany during the end of the 1930s and early 1940s. In fact, it was the first of any kind of film that actually spoofed Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Here Moe Howard plays a fascist bumbling dictator named Moe Hailstone who is installed after the country of Moronica's kind is deposed and sent into exile. Moe's imitation of Hitler's speeches is scary at times but the way he barks in his version of German is so funny you may end up shedding tears from laughing so hard.While nowhere near ""You Nazty Spy"", the other three shorts included are also entertaining but ""An ache in Every Stake"" is my second favorite. Moe Larry and Curly star as icemen who deliver ice to customers during a severe heatwave but during that time destroy two birthday cakes that were meant for a police chief's birthday party. As they escaped from losing their icebox which actually crashes into the chief at the bottom of the stairs, the boys wind up as cooks after the original chef quits. The chef actually was assigned to make the birthday for the police chief who when he meets the new cooks is unaware that it's the same guys who ruined two of his previous birthday cakes.While I'll give credit for the colorizing job on the DVD, I'll always prefer the black & white version because it always feels more true to the spirit of the Three Stooges.

829172,A1NP925Y4J4MYQ,B0002A2WG8,John O'Keefe,"[0, 0]","As many have said in previous posts, the early colorization process back in the 1980's was more of a novelty than anything else and after a few minutes of viewing a colorized black and white classic, it became too distracting to watch. The colors bled into one another, especially with the fast motion of the colorized subject and more importantly, it just didn't look natural. Even eye color had a flesh tone to it.This is NOT the case with the new Three Stooges DVD release ""Stooged and Confused."" I just finished watching this DVD and was pleasantly surprised not only by the sharpness of the prints themselves, but also with the new colorization process. Apparently, the staff at Columbia Pictures researched original stooges scripts, props and other historical documents in order to come up with the most likely colors that were used in the Stooges films. The result is an impressive and realistic looking finished product. It isn't perfect,(the flesh tones tend to be a little too enhanced at times) but it looks for the most part like these stooges comedies were originally filmed in color. I wasn't distracted one bit by watching these colorized versions, something I couldn't have said when viewing earlier colorization. This new colorization process ""ChromaChoice"" actually seems to add depth to the picture you're watching.Some purists will say that these films are best viewed as they were originally presented, in glorious black and white.

But, even if you disagree with my opinion, that does not mean that my review in not helpful, even if it leads you NOT to purchase this product!  We can agree to disagree.And...as far as profit motive is concerned...Have you ever heard of anyone involved in a commercial enterprise producing an item NOT to sell?  Here, at least an earnest effort was exerted to create something that is, at the very least, technologically stunning.  So, I ask you to be fair and open-minded, even if you are a purist.  And yes, they could have included more episodes per disc.  But, then again, the price is not exactly exorbitant.  And...the cost to produce these episodes in color, I suspect, was significant.So, in MY opinion...MAJOR KUDOS are in order for the producers and technicians of this series.  Painstaking effort was obviously applied to get results that are extremely natural-looking, and to treat both the product and legacy with love and respect.  The ""new"" color is quite exciting, especially for a big Stooges fan who has viewed these episodes dozens of times.  The results are so good that, indeed, it appears as if these eposodes were originally filmed in color.In this collection, 3 very, very good episodes and 1 so-so one are featured.  All of these shorts feature Moe, Larry and Curly in their youthful, energetic prime.""An Ache In Every Stake,"" is definitely one of the best Stooge shorts.  In it, the guys play ice delivery workers turned makeshift cooks at a birthday party.  Some of the all-time best gags are included.  I love Curly's ""conversation"" with the block of ice he is charged with ""shaving.""  And his turkey-stuffing routine is too classic.In ""Violent Is The Word...,"" we have another case of mistaken identity, where the guys try to make the most of their ""good fortune.""  In this case, they are gas station workers (providing ""Super Service"") who end up as ""professors"" at an all-girls college.  There is merry music making as the Stooges do ""Swinging The Alphabet"" [super silly!].""You Nazsty Spy"" features Moe's classic Hitler impersonation, Curly doing a brief Mussolini bit, clever word play, and plenty of wonderful gags.""No Census, No Feeling"" isn't the cleverest episode, and seems to get lost in midstream.OVERALL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the quality of the episodes, for the excellent results on the ""new"" color, and for the opportunity to see something new in the old!!!",4,COLOR IS COOL!,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,2516,"['know', 'lot', 'folks', 'will', 'disagree', 'review', 'are', 'purist', 'great', 'respect', 'even', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'not', 'mean', 'review', 'not', 'helpful', 'even', 'NOT', 'purchase', 'product', 'can', 'agree', 'disagree.And', 'as', 'far', 'profit', 'motive', 'concerned', 'Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'anyone', 'involved', 'commercial', 'enterprise', 'producing', 'item', 'NOT', 'sell', 'Here', 'least', 'earnest', 'effort', 'was', 'exerted', 'create', 'something', 'very', 'least', 'technologically', 'stunning', 'So', 'ask', 'be', 'fair', 'open-minded', 'even', 'are', 'purist', 'yes', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'episodes', 'disc', 'then', 'again', 'price', 'not', 'exactly', 'exorbitant', 'cost', 'produce', 'episodes', 'color', 'suspect', 'was', 'significant.So', 'MY', 'opinion', 'MAJOR', 'KUDOS', 'are', 'order', 'producers', 'technicians', 'series', 'Painstaking', 'effort', 'was', 'obviously', 'applied', 'get', 'results', 'are', 'extremely', 'natural-looking', 'treat', 'product', 'legacy', 'love', 'respect', 'new', 'color', 'quite', 'exciting', 'especially', 'big', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'who', 'viewed', 'episodes', 'dozens', 'times', 'results', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'indeed', 'eposodes', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', 'color.In', 'collection', '3', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', '1', 'so-so', 'one', 'are', 'featured', 'shorts', 'feature', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'youthful', 'energetic', 'prime', 'Ache', 'Every', 'Stake', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'Stooge', 'shorts', 'guys', 'play', 'ice', 'delivery', 'workers', 'turned', 'makeshift', 'cooks', 'birthday', 'party', 'all-time', 'best', 'gags', 'are', 'included', 'love', 'Curly', 'conversation', 'block', 'ice', 'charged', 'shaving', 'turkey-stuffing', 'routine', 'too', 'classic.In', 'Violent', 'Word', 'have', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'where', 'guys', 'try', 'make', 'most', 'good', 'fortune', 'case', 'are', 'gas', 'station', 'workers', 'providing', 'Super', 'Service', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'professors', 'all-girls', 'college', 'merry', 'music', 'making', 'Stooges', 'do', 'Swinging', 'Alphabet', 'super', 'silly', ']', 'Nazsty', 'Spy', 'Moe', 'classic', 'Hitler', 'impersonation', 'Curly', 'doing', 'brief', 'Mussolini', 'bit', 'clever', 'word', 'play', 'plenty', 'wonderful', 'gags', 'Census', 'No', 'Feeling', ""n't"", 'cleverest', 'episode', 'get', 'lost', 'midstream.OVERALL', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'quality', 'episodes', 'excellent', 'results', 'new', 'color', 'opportunity', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'old']",N/A
