997246,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000FZETIE,Dorrie Wheeler,"[9, 12]","No modern day comedian has struck a chord with the young, urban hip-hop comedienne as Dave Chapelle.  His Comedy Central television series Chapelle's Show garnered Comedy Central high ratings and DVD sales of the shows first two seasons broke records. When news broke that Dave Chapelle had signed a $50 million plus contract to continue the series, it seemed clear to fans that Chapelle' Show was here to stay.  Then in nearly 2005, Dave left the show and never returned.  It seemed like Chapelle's Show was history.Cashing in might be an unfair way to label Comedy Central's decision to release Chapelle's Show The Lost Episodes, but based on watching the episodes it's pretty clear that they were just trying to get the last little hoorah out of Chapelle's Show.Chapelle's Show, The Lost Episodes features three episodes of Chapelle's Show comprised of completed skits.  The shows are hosted by Charlie Murphy and another Chapelle Show regular cast member.The first episode on the DVD is the funniest.  Skits in this feature focus on what Dave's life is like after the big $50 million dollar announcement.  In the first skit he is grossly over charged for normal things like hair cuts and car washes.  In another skit in this first episode he re-visits an ex-girlfriend and convinces her to leave her husband. In one of the funnier skits Dave re-enacts what it's like when a new Tupac song comes on in the club.As the episodes proceed, the skits become less and less funny.  In one skit Chapelle mocks Howard Dean. Who's that? You may recall Howard Dean ran for president several years ago.  This skit seems quite dated.  The single disc release also includes the controversial ""pixie"" episode Dave referred to in several interviews.Dave reprises his popular Lil Jon character and spoofs P. Diddy in one skit.  Dave also spoofs the MTV series Cribs. Celebrity cameos include Marla Gibbs, Melle Mel, MTV's La La, Susan Sarandon, Q'uestlove,  Russell Simmons and Spike Lee.  Musical guests include Dead Prez and John Legend.Overall, Chapelle Show The Lost Episodes is worth it if you just want to complete your Chapelle's Show collection.

997256,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000FZETIE,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[96, 106]","When Dave Chappelle shocked the world by turning his back on Comedy Central and his smash hit Chappelle's Show, rumors of completed skits, or in this case ""lost episodes"" were rampant.  Now, in 2006, Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes are here, and upon viewing, it's apparent why Chappelle had grown so disatisfied with the direction the show was taking.  Since Dave is no where to be found, Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings host and present the sketches, which range from Dave imitating Howard Dean, to once again imitating P. Diddy and Lil' Jon.  The saddest part of this DVD isn't that Dave is gone, it's how painful some of the skits are to watch.  The Howard Dead and Gary Coleman spoofs go nowhere, as does ""The Monsters"" in which Dave, Charlie, and Donnell are a werewolf, Frankenstein's monster, and a mummy respectively are discriminated against, and the much heard about pixie sketch is funny at first, but it only furthers the notion that Chappelle stated in interviews about it only furthering racial stereotypes instead of spoofing them.  The MTV Cribs skit begins slowly, but by the time Dave whips out some T-Rex eggs, it gets surprisingly funny.  The biggest gem of the sketches is Dave in a club that spoofs the post-humous releases by Tupac.  Other than that, there's hardly anything else here worth mentioning, which is incredibly disappointing.  The second season of Chappelle's Show was a step beyond the first season as Chappelle pushed the limits of comedy and racial issues, but you'd never know it once you give this a look.  It's worth a look for fans of the show who have been mourning it's demise, but don't expect much out of it.  Instead, check out Dave Chappelle's Block Party or his standup DVD's; they are much more worth your time and cash.",2,Should have stayed lost,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,1779,"['When', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'shocked', 'world', 'turning', 'back', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'smash', 'hit', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'rumors', 'completed', 'skits', 'case', 'lost', 'episodes', 'were', 'rampant', 'Now', '2006', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'Lost', 'Episodes', 'are', 'here', 'viewing', 'apparent', 'why', 'Chappelle', 'had', 'grown', 'so', 'disatisfied', 'direction', 'show', 'was', 'taking', 'Dave', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Donnell', 'Rawlings', 'host', 'present', 'sketches', 'range', 'Dave', 'imitating', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'once', 'again', 'imitating', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'saddest', 'part', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'Dave', 'gone', 'how', 'painful', 'skits', 'are', 'watch', 'Howard', 'Dead', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'spoofs', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Monsters', 'Dave', 'Charlie', 'Donnell', 'are', 'werewolf', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'mummy', 'respectively', 'are', 'discriminated', 'much', 'heard', 'pixie', 'sketch', 'funny', 'first', 'only', 'notion', 'Chappelle', 'stated', 'interviews', 'only', 'furthering', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'instead', 'spoofing', 'MTV', 'Cribs', 'skit', 'slowly', 'time', 'Dave', 'out', 'T-Rex', 'eggs', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'biggest', 'gem', 'sketches', 'Dave', 'club', 'post-humous', 'releases', 'Tupac', 'Other', 'hardly', 'anything', 'else', 'here', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'incredibly', 'disappointing', 'second', 'season', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'was', 'step', 'first', 'season', 'Chappelle', 'pushed', 'limits', 'comedy', 'racial', 'issues', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'once', 'give', 'look', 'look', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'mourning', 'demise', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Instead', 'check', 'out', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'Block', 'Party', 'standup', 'DVD', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'worth', 'time', 'cash']",N/A
997257,A175TPTHMNS7S4,B000FZETIE,"Norfeest ""Yes Yes Y'all""","[22, 27]","I waited a year to see these skits and, well, I feel a bit letdown.  Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes probably should've stayed lost.  I only bought it to complete my Chappelle's Show collection.  I can think of maybe two skits that were laugh out loud funny -- the very first skit where Dave is getting a haircut and the club skit where they talk about Tupac. There are a few honorable mention skits like the Daddy Day Care 2 and the MTV Cribs skit.  Revenge Is Best Served Cold and Say What You Mean skits are cool, but like most of the material on the disc, it won't generate anything more than a chuckle.  I did enjoy the audience participation on Episode 2 though.Sadly though, the drawbacks are plenty.  First and foremost, Dave Chappele is missing, so naturally the show will feel different.  Secondly, Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings simply aren't very good hosts.....especially Rawlings.  They seemed uncomfortable and sometimes unable out there while they were hosting.  Another problem I found were the number of thrown in skits that didn't even have Dave in them (like the ""I'm Broke B*tch"" throw in) and the Howard Dean skit isn't funny at all.  I thought the rehashing of Lil' Jon was corny (especially since his buzz is dying), the Chuck Taylor Newsbreaks weren't funny, and don't even get me started on the awful Pixie skit.  Also, you should probably pass on about 80% of the bonus features, they're pretty weak.  Basically, the first episode is the best one....then you can kind of jump from scene to scene throughout the rest of the disc to save yourself some time.My guess is that Dave was losing steam and wanted to seperate himself from any mediocrity associated with this disc (and trust me, there's plenty).  I'd only recommend this DVD to die hard Dave Chappelle fans.  Though most of this stuff is forgettable, there are still tidbits here and there that are really funny.  I actually respect Dave a little more now for not wanting to have this released and letting people know that before the DVD hit store shelves.

Well Dave is now a muslim/Islamic which is synonomous with no sense of humor. Or the lack of humor with in the Islamic culture. This puts all of his previously veiwed humor in a different light. It shows with the conflicts he has had between his humor and the lack there of after becoming Islamic. His humor has been on the decline and these lost episodes are only worthy of watching on reruns on comedy central;The Lost Episodes are not worthy of purchase I do own the other two seasons.

However, that episode is pretty much where the laughter stopped for me. The entire season didn't have me rolling on the floor pounding my fist.

The Tupac, Pixie, and Puff Daddy sketches were hilarious. The funniest part of this DVD are the extras. There is a hilarious unaired sketch of Daddy Day Care 2 with Charlie Murphy. Donnell ""Ashy Larry"" Rawlings and Charlie give hilarious commentary on every episode. There is a ""Making of Season 3"" featurette that is very funny where they debate the Pixie sketch. Also on this DVD, the banjo player in the Pixie sketch (played by Mos Def) is edited out. The musical performances are John Legend ""Ordinary People"" and Dead Prez ""Hip Hop"".
