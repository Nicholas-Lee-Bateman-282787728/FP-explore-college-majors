This movie is a little different from the others in that after graduating from black medical school he tried to get a position in a hospital in a black community but is turned away because he looked white.He was stuck between a rock and a hard place because when he applied at white hospitals he was rejected because he admitted he was black.He saves the life of a small town doctor who is ready to retire and offers him the opportunity to take over his practice.  When he tells the older doctor that he is black the doctor tells him that they can keep that fact between themselves.I won't give the rest of the story away but it is interesting.,4,Interesting Twist on a Storyline Many Times Told,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,716,"['movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'white', 'movie', 'little', 'different', 'others', 'graduating', 'black', 'medical', 'school', 'tried', 'get', 'position', 'hospital', 'black', 'community', 'turned', 'away', 'looked', 'white.He', 'was', 'stuck', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'when', 'applied', 'white', 'hospitals', 'was', 'rejected', 'admitted', 'was', 'black.He', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'doctor', 'who', 'ready', 'retire', 'opportunity', 'take', 'over', 'practice', 'When', 'older', 'doctor', 'black', 'doctor', 'can', 'keep', 'fact', 'themselves.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'rest', 'story', 'away', 'interesting']",Lost Boundaries VHS
389352,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6303922244,Kevin Killian,"[16, 18]","The movie reeks of a certain kind of social realism that would later, in the 1950s, bloom into such ""classics"" as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, THE WILD ONE, etc, but LOST BOUNDARIES fascinates because of its race theme and the way n which it employs white actors to pass as black, even while the characters are black passing for white.  Alfred Werker, the director, brings a Hawthornean sense of pain and desolation to the New England scenes, which are scary precisely because they're all set in Greek Revival style churches and private houses, very upper middle class, and yet they look like whitened sepulchres, for everything's white without a drop of color, as though some Puritan or Shaker influence from hundreds of years past had interdicted even the slightest shade of color.  Mel Ferrer and Beatrice Pearson are splendid in the parts of the older Carters, Scott and Marcia, the ones who decide to marry because (amng other things) each has exactly the same quotient of black and white blood, although in the secondhalf of the movie, when they are supposed to be grown up with teen children of their own, it's a little ridiculous, and Beatrice Pearson in particular still looks around 14, though bravely the actress agreed to wear what must have been some heavy padding around her hips and waist to make her seem ""matronly.""Susan Douglas, as her teen daughter Shelley, has a sad face even when she's happy, and when she's sad, misery has no word for it!  The scene where Carleton Carpenter, as her white boyfriend ""Andy,"" stops her as she walks across the bridge where he's fishing, is astonishing: both actors play it with immense conviction, and at the end, when Carpenter can't understand why Douglas won't be going to the dance with him any more, it's heartbreaking: he's so sweet you'd think he was retarded.  (Maybe he's supposed to be?)  It seemed to me that in all the town of Keenham, there was one soul who didn't have a racist bone in his body--thus the town was saved, a la Sodom and Gomorrah?Richard Hylton, who plays the teen son who comes to find that his family's been living a lie, is also good.  He's like a Dean Stockwell type totally enchanted with his own image (we see him narcissistically examining himself in a mirror, then the mirror turns dark around the edges as he realizes that the beauty he has so admired is that of a ""Negro"").  He runs off to New York, to what looks like some fascinating actual location footage of Harlem, and there gets mixed up in a gun battle between two rival guys who are trying to kill each other.  Happily, Canada Lee is on the case--the great Canada Lee, perhaps the finest actor of the entire piece.Some of the dialogue is overwritten, some of it seems to be missing, as though the actors were given blank pages and the directions, ""Act with your eyes,"" but the daring of the movie is still very much tangible after nearly 60 years.  You could sink your teeth and bite into it.  I can't imagine how Hollywood could actually have made this movie.

If you lived through the times where the color of your skin or ancestry is of African origin and it kept you from improving your life in the United States and you were able to Pass (looking White but called a Negro), then this movie should be a reminder of the cruelty that ignorant bigots practiced . Imagine that, bigots have been brained washed from childhood and can't understand why they must hate others even after they have fallen in love, had sex, wanted to marry and have babies with you and not knowing you're a mixture of Black and White or of African decent . These unfortunate, misinformed  creatures can't  decide if color or ancestry is an issue to hate, even if you looked White . Thank God these poor creatures are fading away and being replaced by level headed, educated humans who are marrying out side of their whiteness and having their own mixed children or adopting other brown , black and mixed children .This movie can be indexed in American History as a parallel to the troubles of the Dark Ages in Europe.Other Movies Collected ""Pinky, I Passed For White , Imitation of Life , Skin , Home of the Brave,Black White (With help from Hollywood makeup tricks, this FX Networks reality series examines race and racism by having two families -- one white, one black -- trade ethnicities to experience life from the other's perspective.

389355,ADJBUPS8SJHTC,6303922244,"thesavvybamalady ""swblkdiamond""","[2, 2]","I think it is truly sad that for our country to have had boundaries to not let you have a job simply due to the color of your skin. To me, that should have NEVER happened in the land of the free and the brave. just my take, just my opinion. with that said, I discovered this movie just about a year ago. for some reason TCM did a day dealing with movies dealing with color. I believe it was Martin Luther King's birthday, and I discovered this movie as well as Odds Against Tomorrow. Now to it's credit, TCM used to have a Black History Month segment where they showed all the movies dealing with the African American or Black diaspora experience. But in lieu of the Oscars, they now show 30 Days of Oscar exclusively in February since that is now when the Oscars is now shown live on TV. used to be March. I do hope though, they give us something or we show our own. with that said, this movie is a gem that I never heard of until the day I saw it and it blew me away. Mel Ferrer and Beatrice Pearson plays this couple. He tried to get a doctor's appointment with African Americans but they are blown away by the fact that he looks darn near white, and then he has to stick to getting jobs wherever he could. So, for economic reasons and at the advice of his family and mentor, he takes a position as the local doctor in a New Hampshire town as a WHITE doctor and stayed there for over 20 years. It was to be only a year but one year turned into 20 and to be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that he wanted to serve his country in World War 2 and the investigators found out his ethnicity that the secret began come out. Now, personally,on theory, I am for you being who you are, but what choice had you in the days when they shunned you for being black? I cannot judge those for passing for better economic opportunities back in the day. If this country was more tolerant,these things would have never happened. I plan to get a copy of this movie myself and show it. this is a true gem. Oh, sorry to use this as an afterthought, but the late great Canada Lee, who played a sympathetic policeman to the son who ended up in Harlem after running away from his family when the truth came out deserves major kudos for his small role in the film.",5,great movie on a terrible problem,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,2243,"['think', 'truly', 'sad', 'country', 'have', 'had', 'boundaries', 'not', 'let', 'have', 'job', 'simply', 'due', 'color', 'skin', 'should', 'have', 'NEVER', 'happened', 'land', 'free', 'brave', 'just', 'take', 'just', 'opinion', 'said', 'discovered', 'movie', 'just', 'year', 'ago', 'reason', 'TCM', 'did', 'day', 'dealing', 'movies', 'dealing', 'color', 'believe', 'was', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'birthday', 'discovered', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Odds', 'Against', 'Tomorrow', 'Now', 'credit', 'TCM', 'used', 'have', 'Black', 'History', 'Month', 'segment', 'where', 'showed', 'movies', 'dealing', 'African', 'American', 'Black', 'diaspora', 'experience', 'lieu', 'Oscars', 'now', 'show', '30', 'Days', 'Oscar', 'exclusively', 'February', 'now', 'when', 'Oscars', 'now', 'shown', 'live', 'TV', 'used', 'be', 'March', 'do', 'hope', 'give', 'something', 'show', 'own', 'said', 'movie', 'gem', 'never', 'heard', 'day', 'saw', 'blew', 'away', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'Beatrice', 'Pearson', 'couple', 'tried', 'get', 'doctor', 'appointment', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'blown', 'away', 'fact', 'darn', 'white', 'then', 'stick', 'getting', 'jobs', 'could', 'So', 'economic', 'reasons', 'advice', 'family', 'mentor', 'position', 'local', 'doctor', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'town', 'WHITE', 'doctor', 'stayed', '20', 'years', 'was', 'be', 'only', 'year', 'one', 'year', 'turned', '20', 'be', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'wanted', 'serve', 'country', 'World', 'War', '2', 'investigators', 'found', 'out', 'ethnicity', 'secret', 'began', 'come', 'out', 'Now', 'personally', 'theory', 'am', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'choice', 'had', 'days', 'when', 'shunned', 'being', 'black', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'passing', 'better', 'economic', 'opportunities', 'back', 'day', 'country', 'was', 'more', 'tolerant', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'happened', 'plan', 'get', 'copy', 'movie', 'show', 'true', 'gem', 'Oh', 'sorry', 'use', 'afterthought', 'late', 'great', 'Canada', 'Lee', 'who', 'played', 'sympathetic', 'policeman', 'son', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'Harlem', 'running', 'away', 'family', 'when', 'truth', 'came', 'out', 'deserves', 'major', 'kudos', 'small', 'role', 'film']",Lost Boundaries VHS
