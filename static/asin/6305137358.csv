We had already born witness to the huge travesty that was The Addams Family Halloween reunion special four years earlier in 1977, so there weren't high expectations for this one. While the film is by no means a classic or what one would of hoped, it isn't all that bad at all. It's quite enjoyable and very watchable and makes you just about forget The Addams Family mistake. Well, almost. By now, we all know the story already. The Munsters was an ABC show that ran for only two seasons(1964-1966)and consisted of 70 episodes. There was the man of the house, Herman Munster(Fred Gwynne), his wife Lily(Yvonne DeCarlo), her father Grandpa(Al Lewis), son Eddie(Butch Patrick), and beautiful niece Marilyn(Originally Beverly Owen, then Pat Priest). They resided at 1313 Mockinbird Lane. This 1981 reunion brings back the 3 main players, Gwynne, DeCarlo, and Lewis, while newcomers played Eddie and Marilyn. Comedy legend Sid Caesar plays a crook who has his wax dummies at the wax museum come to life and pull off robberies. Two such wax dummies are dead ringers for Herman and Grandpa. Naturally, our favorite gruesome twosome are charged with the robberies and it's up to Herman and Grandpa to clear their names and stop the madman. The depiction of Herman and Grandpa as a slapsticky comedy team is fun. What is really special about this goodhearted reunion is that the 3 main actors are all in fine form. It was as tho not a day had passed since their final episode in 1966. Gwynne, who was 54 at the time, was as usual, perfection. He knows Herman inside and out and there is not a single difference in his look or performance as Herman. He was fantastic and never got the credit he deserved. Al Lewis is Grandpa and like Gwynne, it was as if nothing had changed. There was definitley noticeability in age with DeCarlo however. Still, she was Lily. There was nothing to write home about the new actors who played Marilyn and Eddie. Obviously the original actors would of been too old to play these roles now. Points also go to the set of the famous Munster abode. It is pretty much the way it was on the series. It was nice to see the house, what we saw of it, in color. The first Munster movie, ""Munster, Go Home!"" in 1966, was nice, but I liked and enjoyed this one better. Like I said before, it could of easily of been a horrible disaster, but with the fantastically in top form Gwynne and Lewis, the house, and the endearing charm of the film and the series' legacy, it wasn't all that bad. Now, how about a big screen update?.",3,Here Be Munsters,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,2580,"['had', 'makings', 'huge', 'disaster', 'had', 'already', 'born', 'witness', 'huge', 'travesty', 'was', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Halloween', 'reunion', 'special', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', '1977', 'were', ""n't"", 'high', 'expectations', 'one', 'film', 'means', 'classic', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'hoped', ""n't"", 'bad', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'watchable', 'just', 'forget', 'Addams', 'Family', 'mistake', 'Well', 'almost', 'now', 'know', 'story', 'already', 'Munsters', 'was', 'ABC', 'show', 'ran', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', '1964-1966', 'consisted', '70', 'episodes', 'was', 'man', 'house', 'Herman', 'Munster', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'wife', 'Lily', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'father', 'Grandpa', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'son', 'Eddie', 'Butch', 'Patrick', 'beautiful', 'niece', 'Marilyn', 'Originally', 'Beverly', 'Owen', 'then', 'Pat', 'Priest', 'resided', '1313', 'Mockinbird', 'Lane', '1981', 'reunion', 'back', '3', 'main', 'players', 'Gwynne', 'DeCarlo', 'Lewis', 'newcomers', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Marilyn', 'Comedy', 'legend', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'crook', 'who', 'wax', 'dummies', 'wax', 'museum', 'come', 'life', 'pull', 'off', 'robberies', 'Two', 'such', 'wax', 'dummies', 'are', 'dead', 'ringers', 'Herman', 'Grandpa', 'Naturally', 'favorite', 'gruesome', 'twosome', 'are', 'charged', 'robberies', 'up', 'Herman', 'Grandpa', 'clear', 'names', 'stop', 'madman', 'depiction', 'Herman', 'Grandpa', 'slapsticky', 'comedy', 'team', 'fun', 'What', 'really', 'special', 'goodhearted', 'reunion', '3', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'was', 'tho', 'not', 'day', 'had', 'passed', 'final', 'episode', '1966', 'Gwynne', 'who', 'was', '54', 'time', 'was', 'usual', 'perfection', 'Herman', 'inside', 'out', 'not', 'single', 'difference', 'look', 'performance', 'Herman', 'was', 'fantastic', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'deserved', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'Grandpa', 'Gwynne', 'was', 'nothing', 'had', 'changed', 'was', 'definitley', 'noticeability', 'age', 'DeCarlo', 'however', 'Still', 'was', 'Lily', 'was', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'new', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Marilyn', 'Eddie', 'Obviously', 'original', 'actors', 'would', 'been', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'roles', 'now', 'Points', 'also', 'go', 'set', 'famous', 'Munster', 'abode', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'house', 'what', 'saw', 'color', 'first', 'Munster', 'movie', 'Munster', 'Go', 'Home', '1966', 'was', 'nice', 'liked', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'better', 'said', 'could', 'easily', 'been', 'horrible', 'disaster', 'fantastically', 'top', 'form', 'Gwynne', 'Lewis', 'house', 'endearing', 'charm', 'film', 'series', 'legacy', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Now', 'how', 'big', 'screen', 'update']",N/A

Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis look mostly unchanged and the pair have lost none of their camraderie, and even a noticeably older Yvonne DeCarlo holds up well.  Kudos also go to the set designers, who seem to have assembled as many of the original props as could be found for the interior set of the Munster home which fans know so well.  [Note, however, that exterior shots of the house are taken from &quot;Munster, Go Home!,&quot; with &quot;England or Bust&quot; painted on the family car.  By the time &quot;The Munsters' Revenge&quot; was produced, the original house facade at Universal had gone through several unfortunate alterations and must have been too costly to restore and re-dress.]  Call this one &quot;for fans only.&quot;",3,"Weak overall, but still irresistible",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,944,"['who', 'are', 'lifelong', 'fans', 'quot', 'Munsters', 'quot', 'made-for-TV', 'reunion', 'weak', 'storyline', 'least', 'life', 'original', 'series', 'sadly', 'cut', 'short', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'look', 'mostly', 'unchanged', 'pair', 'have', 'lost', 'none', 'camraderie', 'even', 'noticeably', 'older', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'up', 'well', 'Kudos', 'also', 'go', 'set', 'designers', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'assembled', 'many', 'original', 'props', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'interior', 'set', 'Munster', 'home', 'fans', 'know', 'so', 'well', '[', 'Note', 'however', 'exterior', 'shots', 'house', 'are', 'taken', 'quot', 'Munster', 'Go', 'Home', 'quot', 'quot', 'England', 'Bust', 'quot', 'painted', 'family', 'car', 'time', 'quot', 'Munsters', 'Revenge', 'quot', 'was', 'produced', 'original', 'house', 'facade', 'Universal', 'had', 'gone', 'several', 'unfortunate', 'alterations', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'costly', 'restore', 're-dress', ']', 'one', 'quot', 'fans', 'only.', 'quot']",N/A

Wurzelbacher,"[0, 0]","Although it was entertaining to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis portray Herman and Grampa for a final hurrah, this movie had terrible writing, which is typical of the reunion movies of the time. Unfortunately the producers of these films seemed only interested in getting an original cast together. Once they had the cast, THEN they wrote a story around it. The result was nearly always a disappointing mess. ""Munsters Revenge"" was no exception. Many critics felt that Butch Patrick and Pat Priest should have been cast as Eddie and Marilyn. I agree. Since their roles were minor anyway, it would have been great to see them again. It's a wonder why they bothered to get Yvonne DeCarlo since she had an extremely minor role. And the GREAT Sid Caesar was reduced to another terrible waste of talent. The writers had no respect for the performers but also it seems to me that the aging performers were simply out to make a buck in this movie without any worries about the terrible script.I understand that Fred Gwynne asked for an ""astronomical sum"" to reprise his role as Herman. I'd really like to know exactly what that sum was, just out of curiosity. How much did NBC pay him to reprise his role? Considering how poorly this movie was made, it's a wonder how they got by with spending any serious sum of money to produce it.This movie was not a completely dismal failure, although close to it. I did enjoy seeing Fred and Al together. But, as with all these reunions, if they spent just a fraction of the time writing a good story as they spent reuniting the cast, it could have been a great finale for the cast. Instead, it was just plain terrible. This film was easily worse than ANY poor episode of the original series. Unfortunately, the only reunion movie I ever saw that not only brought together an original cast but was also a decent story was the Andy Griffith show reunion. Oh, well. As bad as it is, I suppose I have to say that it's better than no reunion at all. It certainly is better than the 1980s remake of the show.",2,Bittersweet,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2032,"['was', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'portray', 'Herman', 'Grampa', 'final', 'hurrah', 'movie', 'had', 'terrible', 'writing', 'typical', 'reunion', 'movies', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'producers', 'films', 'seemed', 'only', 'interested', 'getting', 'original', 'cast', 'together', 'had', 'cast', 'THEN', 'wrote', 'story', 'result', 'was', 'nearly', 'always', 'disappointing', 'mess', 'Munsters', 'Revenge', 'was', 'exception', 'Many', 'critics', 'felt', 'Butch', 'Patrick', 'Pat', 'Priest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Eddie', 'Marilyn', 'agree', 'roles', 'were', 'minor', 'anyway', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'again', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'get', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'had', 'extremely', 'minor', 'role', 'GREAT', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'was', 'reduced', 'terrible', 'waste', 'talent', 'writers', 'had', 'respect', 'performers', 'also', 'aging', 'performers', 'were', 'simply', 'make', 'buck', 'movie', 'worries', 'terrible', 'script.I', 'understand', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'asked', 'astronomical', 'sum', 'reprise', 'role', 'Herman', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'sum', 'was', 'just', 'curiosity', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'NBC', 'pay', 'reprise', 'role', 'Considering', 'how', 'poorly', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'spending', 'serious', 'sum', 'money', 'produce', 'it.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'dismal', 'failure', 'close', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Fred', 'Al', 'together', 'reunions', 'spent', 'just', 'fraction', 'time', 'writing', 'good', 'story', 'spent', 'reuniting', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'finale', 'cast', 'Instead', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'film', 'was', 'easily', 'worse', 'ANY', 'poor', 'episode', 'original', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'reunion', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'not', 'only', 'brought', 'together', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'decent', 'story', 'was', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'show', 'reunion', 'Oh', 'well', 'As', 'bad', 'suppose', 'have', 'say', 'better', 'reunion', 'certainly', 'better', '1980s', 'remake', 'show']",N/A
