1262043,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002C68WNM,Andy Orrock,"[9, 9]","I had the good fortune of seeing writer/director Paul Saltzman's outstanding documentary 'Prom Night in Mississippi' at the 2009 Dallas AFI Film Festival. Saltzman gave an excellent Q&A; after the film.  It won the award for Best Documentary in Dallas and sold-out the theater.  It doesn't appear that the film actually made it into commercial release (it's not listed in Box Office Mojo), which is a shame.  You can make up for this injustice by renting or buying the DVD.  It's well worth your time and money.The story is instigated by Morgan Freeman's attempts to end the long-standing practice of separate proms (white, black) in his hometown of Charleston, Mississippi.  However, Mr. Freeman plays a relatively minor role in Saltzman's film.  Instead, the filmmaker turns his cameras on the students, educators, administrators and parents.  It's fascinating to listen to the interviewees discuss the history of the town, its events and how things came to be.What struck me most about Saltzman's movie is this: by training his camera on a few selected protagonists, he unveils insight and nuanced, complex thinking from unlikely quarters.  That he gets it from some of the students is one thing.  There are some smart, thoughtful kids at this school.  But that it comes from a self-described 'redneck' kitted out in camouflage is something else entirely.  I'm referring to parent Glen Sumner - his attempts to articulate parental attitudes and the reasons behind their baked-in biases is brilliant, emotional and brave.  During the Q&A; in Dallas, when one of the questioners asked Saltzman to carry word back to Mr. Sumner of her admiration of his courage, she got an ovation from the audience.  It's the type of film that elicits that type of enthusiasm and emotion.",5,Shame there wasn't commerical release of this great documentary; the DVD is well worth your time,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,1772,"['had', 'good', 'fortune', 'seeing', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Saltzman', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'Night', 'Mississippi', '2009', 'Dallas', 'AFI', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Saltzman', 'gave', 'excellent', 'Q', 'A', 'film', 'won', 'award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Dallas', 'sold-out', 'theater', ""n't"", 'appear', 'film', 'actually', 'made', 'commercial', 'release', 'not', 'listed', 'Box', 'Office', 'Mojo', 'shame', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'injustice', 'renting', 'buying', 'DVD', 'well', 'time', 'money.The', 'story', 'instigated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'attempts', 'end', 'long-standing', 'practice', 'separate', 'proms', 'white', 'black', 'hometown', 'Charleston', 'Mississippi', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role', 'Saltzman', 'film', 'Instead', 'filmmaker', 'cameras', 'students', 'educators', 'administrators', 'parents', 'fascinating', 'listen', 'interviewees', 'discuss', 'history', 'town', 'events', 'how', 'things', 'came', 'be.What', 'struck', 'most', 'Saltzman', 'movie', 'training', 'camera', 'few', 'selected', 'protagonists', 'insight', 'nuanced', 'complex', 'thinking', 'unlikely', 'quarters', 'students', 'one', 'thing', 'are', 'smart', 'thoughtful', 'kids', 'school', 'self-described', ""'redneck"", 'kitted', 'out', 'camouflage', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', ""'m"", 'referring', 'parent', 'Glen', 'Sumner', 'attempts', 'articulate', 'parental', 'attitudes', 'reasons', 'baked-in', 'biases', 'brilliant', 'emotional', 'brave', 'Q', 'A', 'Dallas', 'when', 'one', 'questioners', 'asked', 'Saltzman', 'carry', 'word', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Sumner', 'admiration', 'courage', 'got', 'ovation', 'audience', 'type', 'film', 'type', 'enthusiasm', 'emotion']",Prom Night in Mississippi

After a long career in film, he returned to the same area to film the separate proms, white and black, and to catalyze a former offer by MOrgan Freeman to integrate the prom.In order to maintain a separate white prom, the parents ran it privately, off school grounds, but in the state armory, which should be open to all.THe most touching facet of this multi-facetted story may be the integrated couple and their attachment on to te other through it all, and their entrance at the prom, and the heart wrenching admissions of the father.PLease see this important film which perhaps bears greatest meaning to those of us who lie this director though not so intimately lived through those hard  times to find this resolution. Hopefully it lasts.It is also interesting to see school practices, the discipline imposed, the separation and the crossings and the rejections of those who cross. THe cops and their selective treatment of the students, and so much more I am forgetting to ask you to watch for.

1262046,A31L2PK9MLQ7WG,B002C68WNM,echoes of empires,"[5, 5]","I came to this movie with great interest, having attending the first integrated prom in a small MS town in 1984. Freeman did some talking and interaction with students and school officials in the opening part of the movie, but it really documented the kids' attitudes, as well as some of the adults. The filmmakers tried to be as honest-candid as possible, and folks were quite open, the kids most of all, though given the intensely touchy nature of blatant racism, much was left unsaid, especially the more strident racist views - which continue to exist today. The movie walks you through Freeman making the proposition to the school council and then the senior class, all the way through to the prom - kids getting ready, lots of interviews with individuals and friends and couples - black and white, kids and adults. There were no shattering insights about why racism continues to exist, but what people did say was very meaningful to hear, touching on how it affects nearly every aspect of their daily lives. I was rapt throughout. And I'm certainly very grateful to Mr. Morgan for taking the steps that he did. With any luck - and hard work - this change in folks' attitudes will stick, and grow.

This isn't the retelling of an old story though, the prom is in 2008.In 1997, the actor Morgan Freeman offered to pay for the first integrated prom.  The school declined his offer.  In 2008, when he offered again, the school and students accepted.  The film follows students as they react to this wonderful opportunity.  Their community is still influenced heavily by racism.  Many of the student's parents (and some students) are racist and that has affected relationships among the students in school.  Some parents are angry about the integrated prom and they hold a white-only prom for their students.  Ultimately, the integrated prom goes on.  Students of all colors come together and have a wonderful time.This is an inspiring film.  It forces me to ask myself, what can I do to make the change I hope to see in the world?

1262050,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B002C68WNM,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","Something about the film didn't really spark for me. I commended the students for wanting to have an ""integrated"" prom, but the idea of having a ""mixed"" prom in 2008 just made me roll my eyes halfway across the world. I think the biggest problem with the film to me was that it even had to be made. I watched it with my 88-year-old grandfather who I thought was going to make me feel appreciative about it, but we spent so much time shaking our head.Cons: 1) My head was swimming every time Jessica said the n-word so matter-of-fact. I understand that she was being asked questions, but it was just flying out of her mouth way too comfortably and bothering me. 2) There was some filler material that really didn't add to the film, like the kids doing the ""Cha Cha"" slide and some rap/dance routine outside and then at probm. I honestly wanted to see heavier material during those parts. I'm guessing the idea was to show kids being kids, but it probably would've worked better for me if kids from other groups were standing outside with them. To me, it just looked like a bunch of kids standing outside. The rap was okay. 3) The parents from the other side wouldn't be videotaped. I think that was my biggest problem with the film. They didn't want to be labeled as ""racist,"" but since the biggest problem was them and they wouldn't go on camera (not even behind that funny screen that that one kid did, who absolutely didn't serve much of a purpose since he wouldn't say it publicly in front of everyone) then a big gap of the film was missing for me.Pros: I'm relieved that the prom actually happened without any drama. Although it was unfortunate that there was still a ""white prom"" even though there was a ""mixed"" prom, I was content to find out about the girl who said the white students seemed to be talking to the black students more often. In a school that was primarily black, I thought it was odd to NOT speak to the black students much anyway. Wasn't the percentage 70 to 30? It takes great effort to ignore THAT much of a school.My grandfather and I pointed out whose outfits we liked the best (the brown-skinned girl with the orange/yellow dress was too cute and I liked Jessica's dress quite a bit outside of me cringing when she kept throwing out the n-word). Although I was interested in the interracial couple who was brave enough to go to the dance together, I was actually more interested in what the daughter's father had to say. Although I didn't agree with a word of what he was saying, it was the one time when we actually got to hear from someone who pretty much had the strange mindset of blacks being separate from whites. I just wanted to hear from both sides, and the film was one-sided.Oh, keep in mind the smarter side got plenty of camera time, but my only problem with the film is that I don't believe anybody really learned anything from it. I got the impression that the white students who went to the white prom already DID NOT have a problem with black people. I think it's pitiful that Morgan Freeman had to get involved when there were plenty of capable grown-ups who should've done it long before he even mentioned it. Like, why did he have to hold the school faculty's hand to do something they clearly knew was wrong to begin with?The movie was cool though. I respect them for making history, although I feel like this is something that should've happened in the '60s or '70s, not 2008.
