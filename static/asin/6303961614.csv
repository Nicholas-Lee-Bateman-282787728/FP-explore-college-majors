Burchfield,"[2, 4]","I haven't seen this set yet so I can't really judge the extra's except to say that if past history is any example they will be worth watching/ listening to.While it may be right that the season took a dark overall tone so many episodes stand out to me as being good television.I kind of liked 2001, it's sort of a sequel to season 4's 2010 in that Stargate Command obeyed O'Neill's warning to stay away from a certain world coordinate and then inadvertently run into the Aschen anyway on another world. The biggest flaw in this story is that the primitive locals once had a written language, Welsh, which I don't think really existed until the 1870's or so. One of the high points was when SG-1 used the Stargate to turn the Aschen's own weappon against them.Other good stories include Red Sky, Proving Ground (will any of the young recruits be in the new series Stargate Atlantis?),Summit, where Daniel Jackson runs into Osiris again, and Fail Safe. Fail Safe is sort of a take off on Armageddon or Deep Impact in that a huge asteroid is headed towards Earth and only SG-1 can stop it. They fly out in their Goa'uld cargo ship to blow the thing up but Carter discovers just in time that the thing is booby trapped by the Goa'uld in such a way as to escape detection by the Asgard, she out smarts them of course.Wormhole X-treme! was intended to be a fun episode and pokes a lot of fun at the show and everyone &amp; thing involved with it.

I must say that overall, I am pleased.While the storyline is engrossing and the stargate makes for possibilities limited only by one' imagination, this series was not up to the usual standard.The truth is that the first 3 or 4 episodes do not hold one's attention. They are in fact outright boring. Mind you there are some really nice episodes in this season and the sound is fantastic with great picture quality.This series overall, was not as attention holding as the last one. The opening episode, which concluded the previous cliffhanger, was a disappointment. Much could have been done instead it seems to have been rushed to a conclusion.Then we have the SG team bringing back a robot to SGC to almost cause doom. Really now. Why couldn't it have been studied somewhere else? Mysteriously, the Asgard [our Ally] who are usually at our heroes beck and call, were nowhere to be found.  I found this episode particularly illogical and irritating. The ultimate insult was Daniel Jackson's reaction at the end. Tears? I was disturbed to hear Dr. Daniel Jackson call Colonel O'Neill [ TWO l's] a SOB. Hey, I watch this show with my 5 year old who enjoys it immensely, the whole family does! This is supposed to be television! No need to sink to this level. Sad.I suggest that whoever is writing the episodes, if they are out of ideas, do what Startrek did; ask the fans to submit ideas for the shows!AT least the ending episode in this series was exciting with the possibilities.Having said the TRUTH, the show is overall still very good. It is just that this season was not up to the usual HIGH standard that I have come to expect.I look forward to the release of season 6!",3,The TRUTH hurts...,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1778,"['was', 'hooked', 'very', 'first', 'Stargate', 'movie', 'have', 'have', 'collected', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'must', 'say', 'overall', 'am', 'storyline', 'engrossing', 'stargate', 'possibilities', 'limited', 'only', 'one', 'imagination', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'usual', 'standard.The', 'truth', 'first', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'one', 'attention', 'are', 'fact', 'boring', 'Mind', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'episodes', 'season', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'great', 'picture', 'quality.This', 'series', 'overall', 'was', 'not', 'attention', 'holding', 'last', 'one', 'opening', 'episode', 'concluded', 'previous', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'instead', 'have', 'been', 'rushed', 'conclusion.Then', 'have', 'SG', 'team', 'bringing', 'back', 'robot', 'SGC', 'almost', 'cause', 'doom', 'Really', 'now', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'studied', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Mysteriously', 'Asgard', '[', 'Ally', ']', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'heroes', 'beck', 'call', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'found', 'episode', 'particularly', 'illogical', 'irritating', 'ultimate', 'insult', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'reaction', 'end', 'Tears', 'was', 'disturbed', 'hear', 'Dr.', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'call', 'Colonel', ""O'Neill"", '[', 'TWO', 'l', ']', 'SOB', 'Hey', 'watch', 'show', '5', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'immensely', 'whole', 'family', 'supposed', 'be', 'television', 'No', 'need', 'sink', 'level', 'Sad.I', 'suggest', 'whoever', 'writing', 'episodes', 'are', 'ideas', 'do', 'what', 'Startrek', 'did', 'ask', 'fans', 'submit', 'ideas', 'shows', 'AT', 'least', 'ending', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'exciting', 'possibilities.Having', 'said', 'TRUTH', 'show', 'overall', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'usual', 'HIGH', 'standard', 'have', 'come', 'expect.I', 'look', 'forward', 'release', 'season', '6']",N/A

392740,ABSX5TGEGRH76,6303961614,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[17, 21]","Sadly, the fifth season of Stargate: SG-1 broke the streak of progressively better seasons that had been going on ever since the first season.  The year began with a cool premiere, &quot;Enemies&quot;, but the next couple episodes sucked.  For example, the episode &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;, which deals with Daniel Jackson's (Michael Shanks) Unas friend, Chaka, was terrible.  Personally, I also hated the episode &quot;The First Ones&quot; from last year which began the Chaka thread.  I mean, I haven't seen episodes this bad since Season 1 (many of the Season 1 episodes, while good, are far inferior to the episodes of Seasons 2-4).  Once you reach the third disc, beginning with the episode &quot;Between Two Fires&quot;, the episodes become good again.  However, the bad episodes weren't the only problems that this season faced.  Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) seemed to regress a little bit because he seemed a lot less tolerent of Daniel than he had been in the last two years (he does, however, reveal his true feelings about Jackson in the episode &quot;Meridian&quot;).  Teal'c (Christopher Judge) and Dr. Janet Frasier (Teryl Rothery) were underused, as were the Asgard, who seem to have put politics ahead of real problems.However, when this season was good, it was REALLY good.  There were some amazing story developments this year, beginning with the final demise of Apophis (Peter Williams), the Goa'uld System Lord who has been making life difficult for the SGC ever since the first season.  Next, the Tollan, an extremely advanced race of humans who are allied with Earth, begin acting suspiciously, the SGC begins recruiting new officers, the motives of the Aschen from last season are revealed, the Tok'Ra are nearly destroyed, and the Jaffa rebellion begins to truly become a problem for the System Lords.  And then, Daniel is brought to a System Lord summit where he has the chance to wipe out the Goa'uld threat forever, that is until he learns of the return of Anubis, an ancient System Lord who was banished for his horrific crimes.  Also, we finally learn the origins of the Replicators.  Finally, SG-1 must endure a change that they never thought would happen in the episode &quot;Meridian&quot;, and then, Anubis and Osirus (Anna-Louise Plowman) reveal plans to attack the Asgard.  But the most pivotal plot twist involves the new series-within-a-series, WORMHOLE X-TREME!!!  Just kidding.This is a very important season, so despite its poor opening, I still reccomend it.  Just be ready to be underwhelmed by the first few episodes.  But after you get past those, enjoy!  Some good episodes include: &quot;Enemies&quot;, &quot;Threshold&quot;, &quot;Between Two Fires&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Wormhole X-Treme&quot;, &quot;Proving Ground&quot;, &quot;Summit&quot;, &quot;Last Stand&quot;, &quot;The Warrior&quot;, &quot;Menace&quot;, &quot;Meridian&quot;, and &quot;Revelations&quot;.",4,Relapse,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,2929,"['Sadly', 'fifth', 'season', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'broke', 'streak', 'progressively', 'better', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'ever', 'first', 'season', 'year', 'began', 'cool', 'premiere', 'quot', 'Enemies', 'quot', 'next', 'couple', 'episodes', 'sucked', 'example', 'episode', 'quot', 'Beast', 'Burden', 'quot', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Unas', 'friend', 'Chaka', 'was', 'terrible', 'Personally', 'also', 'hated', 'episode', 'quot', 'First', 'Ones', 'quot', 'last', 'year', 'began', 'Chaka', 'thread', 'mean', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'bad', 'Season', '1', 'many', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'good', 'are', 'far', 'inferior', 'episodes', 'Seasons', '2-4', 'reach', 'third', 'disc', 'beginning', 'episode', 'quot', 'Between', 'Two', 'Fires', 'quot', 'episodes', 'become', 'good', 'again', 'However', 'bad', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'problems', 'season', 'faced', 'Jack', ""O'Neill"", 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'seemed', 'regress', 'little', 'bit', 'seemed', 'lot', 'less', 'tolerent', 'Daniel', 'had', 'been', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'however', 'reveal', 'true', 'feelings', 'Jackson', 'episode', 'quot', 'Meridian', 'quot', 'Teal', 'c', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'Dr.', 'Janet', 'Frasier', 'Teryl', 'Rothery', 'were', 'underused', 'were', 'Asgard', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'put', 'politics', 'ahead', 'real', 'problems.However', 'when', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'REALLY', 'good', 'were', 'amazing', 'story', 'developments', 'year', 'beginning', 'final', 'demise', 'Apophis', 'Peter', 'Williams', ""Goa'uld"", 'System', 'Lord', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'life', 'difficult', 'SGC', 'ever', 'first', 'season', 'Next', 'Tollan', 'extremely', 'advanced', 'race', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'allied', 'Earth', 'begin', 'acting', 'suspiciously', 'SGC', 'recruiting', 'new', 'officers', 'motives', 'Aschen', 'last', 'season', 'are', 'revealed', ""Tok'Ra"", 'are', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'Jaffa', 'rebellion', 'truly', 'become', 'problem', 'System', 'Lords', 'then', 'Daniel', 'brought', 'System', 'Lord', 'summit', 'where', 'chance', 'wipe', 'out', ""Goa'uld"", 'threat', 'forever', 'return', 'Anubis', 'ancient', 'System', 'Lord', 'who', 'was', 'banished', 'horrific', 'crimes', 'Also', 'finally', 'learn', 'origins', 'Replicators', 'Finally', 'SG-1', 'must', 'endure', 'change', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'happen', 'episode', 'quot', 'Meridian', 'quot', 'then', 'Anubis', 'Osirus', 'Anna-Louise', 'Plowman', 'reveal', 'plans', 'attack', 'Asgard', 'most', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'twist', 'new', 'series-within-a-series', 'WORMHOLE', 'X-TREME', 'Just', 'kidding.This', 'very', 'important', 'season', 'so', 'poor', 'opening', 'still', 'reccomend', 'Just', 'be', 'ready', 'be', 'underwhelmed', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'past', 'enjoy', 'good', 'episodes', 'include', 'quot', 'Enemies', 'quot', 'quot', 'Threshold', 'quot', 'quot', 'Between', 'Two', 'Fires', 'quot', 'quot', '2001', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wormhole', 'X-Treme', 'quot', 'quot', 'Proving', 'Ground', 'quot', 'quot', 'Summit', 'quot', 'quot', 'Last', 'Stand', 'quot', 'quot', 'Warrior', 'quot', 'quot', 'Menace', 'quot', 'quot', 'Meridian', 'quot', 'quot', 'Revelations', 'quot']",N/A

Imagine a stargate buried under 28 levels in a highly fortified Cheyenne Mountain. Imagine stepping into the gate and going to any one of hundreds of planets where everyone happens to speak perfect 21st Century English. Talk about a universal language! (And some people wanted me to take Spanish!) Good writers could have used some creativity to get around this, but though all the aliens speak English, their written language is markedly different. On one planet the residents even had lapels and their jackets and those little holes on the left side (never knew what they were for).But once you jump that yawning chasm of suspension of disbelief, SG-1's exploits are well written, though like most sci-fi episodes written around children, you have to take the lumps.The price is right on this series and watching the beautiful Amanda Tapping alone is worth the price of admission.

I'm going to see the series through to the end.Episode synopses follow:Enemies - Last season ended with a bang when the SG1 crew with a captured Ghoul ship blew up a star in an attempt to destroy Apothis and his fleet. They did blow up the star and the fleet but all is not well. The team was entering hyperspace as the star blew up and they were blown a LONG way away. Just to keep things interesting, Apothis and his personal ship were blown to the same destination. Apothis has Teal'c as a prisoner and is about to destroy the humans when ""help"" shows up. The new ship engages the ghoul mother ship but they turn out to be worse than Apothis. It is a replicator ship. That is the situation. The SG1 team has a set of simple tasks: Get home, keep the replicators from threatening home, escape from Apothis, and contend with a brainwashed Teal'c who is now loyal to Apothis. It's not going to be easy.Threshold - The SG1 team managed to make it back alive from the mission of the previous episode but there is still a big problem. Teal'c's brainwashing is still in effect and he still considers Apothis to be his god. The prognosis is not good and Teal'c's old mentor, Braytac, comes up with the only possible cure. It is an ancient Jaffa right which involves removing the symbiote and letting the patient remember past experiences. Most patients do not survive the procedure but it is the only hope. Teal'c proves as stubborn in illness as he is in life. There are a few flashbacks to earlier episodes but most of the flashbacks concern his days before the coming of the Earth people. It is an interesting piece of character development for the big guy.Ascension - The team is investigating a new planet which shows signs of high development and signs of destruction. They also find what appears to be a gigantic weapon. While she is investigating it, Maj. Carter is knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she seems to be fine but a little snippy. After going home, she encounters a strange man who keeps popping up. It seems that Maj. Carter has a stalker. He has the hots for her but there is something more. He is an alien who is only visible when he wants to be. He only wants to be visible for her. After a while, he becomes so enthralled with her that he permanently takes human form. Without others of his kind, he cannot return to his ethereal state. All of this takes place as the Pentagon is further investigating the weapon found on the planet. It is a BIG one. It turns out, the alien is the one originally responsible for building it. It destroyed the civilization of the planet and he was left behind as punishment. Now, he will do anything to stop it from being activated again.The Fifth Man - The SG1 team makes it through the Stargate in the middle of a firefight. Daniel, Maj. Clark and Teal'c get through to earth but O'Neill is left behind with the new lieutenant who had been wounded in the firefight. The rest of the team promises to return quickly with reinforcements. Those reinforcements will be a long time in coming. Nobody back at SGC has any idea who the mystery lieutenant is. They have never heard of him. They rightly fear that the SG1 team has come under the influence of alien mind control. They have, in a manner of speaking but it is not the alien who is the really dangerous one. The real rat is a government investigator with a political motive.Red Sky - The SG1 team visits a new planet. It is not quite primitive but it is several centuries behind earth's level. The people there are worshippers of the Asgard. Freyer is their particular deity. They enjoy protection from the ghouls and everything seems fine until the team's visit. The SGC Stargate apparently bypasses a few safeguards. In this instance, their wormhole passed through the local sun, transporting some heavy elements that are destabilizing the star, thus dooming the locals. When they realize this, the SG1 team wants to help. They contact the Asgard only to find that Thor is unavailable, Freyer is not as likeably and that a treaty clause prevents them from helping. It is up to the SG1 team to save the planet. Unfortunately, they are hundreds, if not thousands, of years behind the technology curve to do so.Rite of Passage - Puberty is never easy. It is especially tough when you are the last member of your race and the ghouls once tried to blow up the earth by planting a bomb inside you. When you are also the result of a genetic experiment designed to make a better host for ghouls things just go from bad to worse. Cassandra was the young girl in whom a bomb was planted several seasons ago. Since that time, she has lived as the adopted daughter of Doc Frasier. She's becoming a young woman now and her body is changing. Its changing in even more ways that your average, hormone drenched teenager. There was a strange rite of passage for girls of her age back on her planet. When girls became fevered, they would go into the woods where they would be zapped into a ghoul lab for examination. They come back cured. Now, Cassandra can't get to the woods. She is dying. The only one who can help is a ghoul prisoner. It's a deal with a devil.Beast of Burden - ""It is our custom to welcome visitors with a drink,"" says the alien. ""It is our custom to drink,"" says Col. O'Neill. It's a hilarious line when it takes place but, unfortunately, there is little else that is truly enjoyable about this episode. Last season, the SG1 team visited the Unas home world where Daniel managed to make friends with an Unas that was planning on eating him. Since that time, Daniel has been studying the primordial Unas world by means of hidden video cameras. When reviewing the tapes, he is shocked to find that human visitors from another world have conducted a raid and have kidnapped Daniel's friend, Chaka. When they go to investigate, they find that he has been taken by slavers who use the Unas as beasts of burden on a planet that has all of the worst qualities of the American south. The slavery is ugly but the solutions are not as simple as one would hope. It's a good episode but it is not very much fun.The Tomb - The SG1 team investigate a new planet and this one has a few new twists. It has a Babylonian mythos instead of an Egyptian one. They also find a package of Russian cigarettes. This is troubling. It seems that while the Russians had a working gate for a few weeks, a team went missing. They were not an ""authorized"" team. They were up to some political skullduggery in the same manner that such things happen with all too much frequency to the American crew. A joint mission is sent out to rescue them. This seems to please nobody. Russians and Americans do not exactly have a good track record of working together. Things are made worse when they get locked inside the ziggurat (Babylonian pyramid) and find themselves stuck with a ghoul infesting an alien bug. Things probably could work better if there were not so many hidden agendas.Between Two Fires - The Tollans, an advanced race who have show a disdain towards earth, are showing signs of changing their policy of not trading technology to inferiors. In fact, they are willing to exchange a large number of ion cannons capable of destroying ghoul mother ships. Things are not as simple as they seem, however. There are vague warnings that the Tollan's offers will lead to the destruction of earth. There are competing factions at work within the Tollan government. Some of them seem to be in league with the really bad guys. The threats against Earth might be official Tollan government policy.2001 - The episode opens with the SG1 team coming home through the Stargate with good news. They have found an advanced race which wants to share technology with earth. In return, they want access to the Stargate system. They have a gate but not a dialing device. It seems to be a deal which is too good to be true. Nobody is really suspicious except for Col. O'Neill. An embassy is sent to arrange a treaty. While the officials are doing the negotiating, Daniel and Teal'c do some background snooping. They learn that the race they are dealing with is the same one that was so dangerous that, an alternate reality version of O'Neill sent a warning back from the year 2010 to warn them. This raises the suspicion level. Unfortunately, the politicians get involved and mess things up for political gain. The aliens are out for conquest and a US senator is determined to help them to ensure his own election to the presidency.Desperate Measures - Major Carter is kidnapped and it happens right here on earth. Within the first few minutes of the episode, almost all of the old earth standard bad guys put in an appearance. So does a Jaffa, on earth. It is not Teal'c. It so happens that while the Russians had an active program, they captured a live ghoul in a jaffa. The ghoul has since matured and needs a new host. A rich American has arranged the kidnapping of Carter so that his private scientists can figure out how her ghoul was successfully extracted. The rich guy is dying and hopes to infest himself with a ghoul in order to get healed and then have the alien removed. Things do not go according to plan. Everyone has his own agenda. Very few of them are on the side of goodness and light.Wormhole X-treme - In an extremely fun episode last season, the team encountered a dweeb who thought he was an alien stranded on earth and who seemed to know way too much about the Stargate program. It turns out that he was right. He was an alien. He was part of a crew which deserted their own forces just before their final defeat and was hiding out on earth. His crewmates were not quite in the same league of dweebishness and neither were they taking part in his memories. The episode ended with the dweeb realizing who he really is and the others disappearing. This time they're back. The dweeb is now the technical advisor on a cable TV show that is WAY too similar to the Stargate program. Meanwhile, an alien ship is heading towards earth and it is identified as being made by the same race as the dweeb. SGC wants to know what is going on and the SG1 team is dispatched to find out. The problem is, the dweeb doesn't remember anything. He thinks he is just a TV writer. His former crewmates are lurking in the background, however, and it is certain that something is going on. It has its serious moments but, mostly, it is a comedy. Its great tongue in cheek stuff!Proving Ground - The SG1 team is assigned to train and evaluate a group of candidates for the Stargate program. The testing is brutal and Col. O'Neill is not will to cut any slack. He is just about to flunk his group of candidates when he gets a terrible message. The SGC has been overrun by aliens. Worse, he is wounded by some SG personnel who have been taken over. Now, he has to take back the facility with a bunch of trainees he was getting ready to flunk. A lot is riding on this one and things are not what they seem.48 Hours - While beating a hasty retreat from a ghoul controlled planet, Teal'c takes one last shot at the ghoul ship piloted by Tanith. The shot is good but the ship crashes into the gate just after Teal'c steps through. The rest of the team has already made it home safely but Teal'c is still in transit when the connection is cut. Everyone fears that he is lost for good. Maj. Carter realizes, though, that the Earth gate has received the transmission. They just need the machine to put him back together again. Meanwhile, any activation of the gate will empty the buffer containing Teal'c. Everyone works on a solution. One team tries to negotiate with the Russians for a gate control device. An NID idiot tries to blackmail Gen. Hammond and offers the needed information in exchange for some ghoul devices. Maj. Carter tries to work out a technical solution while being impeded by a self righteous idiot. It is Col. O'Neill who saves the day, however. He lacks the finesse or style of the others but he has his own way of getting things done.Summit - The Ghoul system lords are in disarray as they struggle for supremacy amongst themselves. In an effort to divert their efforts into something more beneficial for themselves, they hold a summit meeting to try and divvy up the galaxy. This can be frightening but it yields opportunities as well. The Tok'ra conceive a plan to kill all the major players of the system Lords. They plan to infiltrate Daniel Jackson as a servant of one of them and let him release a poison that will kill them all. It's a workable plan but the plans do not survive contact with the enemy. There is a ghoul puppet master behind the scenes, Anubis, who has his own plot to wipe out the Tok'ra and take control of the System Lords. Having Daniel encounter his former lover as the host for one of the System Lords was not in the script either. It's a cliffhanger.Last Stand - The ghoul summit is not going as well as it could. They don't trust each other. They are further thrown into confusion by the appearance of Osiris who is serving as the proxy of Anubis. Anubis was so evil that even the System Lords would not deal with him. A deal has been offered to get back into their good graces, however. He offers to destroy the Tok'ra and take on Earth. The Tok'ra have pretty much been destroyed. Just a part of SG1 is left alive. Daniel, who is posing as the servant of one of the system lords, comes up with a plan to capture Osiris (who possesses his former girlfriend) and use her to find Anubis. Rescuing SG1 and what is left of the Tok'ra information base also seems like a good idea. It's hard to picture Daniel doing all this covert op stuff but he seems to be doing well at it.Fail Safe - This one seems to be strictly a local episode. An astronomer discovers a huge asteroid on a collision course with earth. It is big enough to extinguish all life and there are very few options for dealing with it. The Asgard won't help because of treaty considerations. The Tollans have been wiped out. The Tok'Ra are on the run after the last few episodes. Its looks like the Earth is doomed. Maj. Carter comes up with a plan to use a ghoul ship shot down on a distant planet to get a bomb to the asteroid. This will require getting to the planet, fixing the ship, getting it back to the solar system and placing the bomb. None of these steps is simple. Things get even more complicated when they learn some of the strange properties of the asteroid. Blowing it up might just make things worse.The Warrior - Teal'c and his old mentor, Bray'tac hear of an army of rebel Jaffa. They go to check things out and it is almost too good to be true. The army does exist and it is led by a First Prime who killed his own master, Imhotep. This guy is a charmer and has a way with words. Listening to him inspires all those who hear. He is preparing an army of rebel Jaffa. The SG1 team is sent to meet with this newcomer and see if an alliance can be reached. They offer food and weapons but the rebels are strangely disdainful of them. They prefer their own ways even though they border on suicidal. Col. O'Neill begins to trust the rebel leader less and less. He thinks that the guy is just trying to amass a personal power base. He is going to recommend against an alliance. Teal'c, though, is sucked in. He wants to believe. He is set to leave the SG1 team until he learns a terrible secret.Menace - The SG1 team finds a new planet that was at one time highly advanced but is now destroyed. The only thing of worth they find is an inactive android. It is lying on top of a slab in a ""laboratory"". They take it (her) back to SGC and manage to revive her. They want to learn what happened to her world. When the android is revived, she is incredibly human but shows the emotional maturity of a small child. Even so, she is still incredibly advanced. She also has an incredible ability. She can build replicators. She thinks of them as toys and she will defend her toys. Her toys will also defend her whenever she gets hacked off. She gets hacked off easily and throws tantrums like any small child.The Sentinel - Back when the NID was running its own renegade Stargate program, they visited a world which had an advanced ghoul defense system. The renegades wanted to investigate the system but the locals refused because it would violate religious taboos. They go to investigate it anyway. They think the left everything exactly like it was before but something has gone wrong. The Sentinel device is not working. The ghouls have invaded and are trying to get access to the same equipment. So far, a force field has stymied everyone but the planet and its people are being destroyed. The SG1 team is sent back to try to repair the matter. They take with them one of the renegades who is now sitting on death row. It is a race to see who can decipher the system first.Meridian - The team comes back from visiting a new world and Daniel is in trouble. The world they visited is at about the level of the US in the 1940s and they have just found their Stargate and a bunch of other neat stuff. Included in this stuff is a completely new element that makes what the gate is made of look weak in comparison. They are trying to make a bomb. The SG1 team has misgivings over this. They fear that they can destroy their entire planet. Still, the locals persist and the reaction goes out of control. Daniel saved the day, prevented the destruction of the planet and got himself a fatal does of radiation in the process. Most of the episode involves conversations between Daniel and the strange light being met several seasons ago. The discussions are about his future and whether he will live or transcend to something else.Revelations - The SG1 team is still in disarray over the loss of Daniel Jackson. Part of the trouble is that nobody is sure if he is dead or really gone on to something better. While the team is trying to come to grips with the loss, the Asgard finally put in an appearance after being incommunicado for several episodes where their help would have been invaluable. Thor has been captured by the ghouls. A renegade group of ghouls led by the shadowy Anubis and aided by Osiris have attacked an Asgard research outpost. The future of the Asgard depends on preventing the information contained there from falling into enemy hands. The SG1 team is enlisted to help gather the research and escape. Then they learn from Heimdall that Thor is still alive. A major rescue mission is mounted and, of course, nothing goes according to plan. The season ends on a different note, however, since this episode is not a cliffhanger.",4,Big Changes,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,18947,"['Season', 'five', 'sees', 'major', 'changes', 'New',

There are very few series that can risk so many changes (especially in one season) and keep the track of things without disappointments.This season sees the departure of a mayor character, the death (final death... mmm, 99.9% sure...) of the mayor big baddie of previous seasons, the annihilation of a powerful ally, politics and shades of grey, the rising of the new big bad nemesis of the series (in a very intelligent way), a lot of character development, conclusions to several story arcs of the past, interesting revelations and more...Perhaps what I most like about this season are the grate scripts (Brad Wright, Robert C. Cooper, Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie were awesome that year). After the grate cliff-hanger of Season 4, ""Enemies"" came to be one of the best season premieres I have ever had the pleasure to watch.The directing style improved greatly (more visual language, more depth in the approach and very good storytelling). Episodes like ""The Tomb"" (grate suspense), ""Threshold"" (one of Tealc's best), ""Between Two Fires"", the awesome, huge and perhaps best two parter of the series ""Summit"" and ""Last Stand"", and the amazing Season Finalie ""Revelations"" (script, directing, acting... everything at its best) which was the first season finalie of the series with no cliff-hanger, make of this season one of Sci-Fi and Television's best.I loved Anna-Louise Plowman (Osiris) in ""Revelations"", the introduction of Anubis, the way the System Lords were finally approached as a group, and the intelligent twists the season gave to the series.",5,The Season of Huge Changes,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,1602,"['Wow', 'Stargate', 'Season', 'really', 'got', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'series', 'can', 'risk', 'so', 'many', 'changes', 'especially', 'one', 'season', 'keep', 'track', 'things', 'disappointments.This', 'season', 'departure', 'mayor', 'character', 'death', 'final', 'death', 'mmm', '99.9', '%', 'sure', 'mayor', 'big', 'baddie', 'previous', 'seasons', 'annihilation', 'powerful', 'ally', 'politics', 'shades', 'grey', 'rising', 'new', 'big', 'bad', 'nemesis', 'series', 'very', 'intelligent', 'way', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'conclusions', 'several', 'story', 'arcs', 'past', 'interesting', 'revelations', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'season', 'are', 'grate', 'scripts', 'Brad', 'Wright', 'Robert', 'C.', 'Cooper', 'Joseph', 'Mallozzi', 'Paul', 'Mullie', 'were', 'awesome', 'year', 'grate', 'cliff-hanger', 'Season', '4', 'Enemies', 'came', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'premieres', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watch.The', 'directing', 'style', 'improved', 'greatly', 'more', 'visual', 'language', 'more', 'depth', 'approach', 'very', 'good', 'storytelling', 'Episodes', 'Tomb', 'grate', 'suspense', 'Threshold', 'one', 'Tealc', 'best', 'Between', 'Two', 'Fires', 'awesome', 'huge', 'perhaps', 'best', 'two', 'parter', 'series', 'Summit', 'Last', 'Stand', 'amazing', 'Season', 'Finalie', 'Revelations', 'script', 'directing', 'acting', 'everything', 'best', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'finalie', 'series', 'cliff-hanger', 'make', 'season', 'one', 'Sci-Fi', 'Television', 'best.I', 'loved', 'Anna-Louise', 'Plowman', 'Osiris', 'Revelations', 'introduction', 'Anubis', 'way', 'System', 'Lords', 'were', 'finally', 'approached', 'group', 'intelligent', 'season', 'gave', 'series']",N/A

It doesn't quite end up being one big soap opera like The Ten  Commandments sometimes seems.  A simple, yet powerful story of a man  falsely accused, wrongly convicted and who has one thing on his mind,  getting revenge on the &quot;friend&quot; who wrongfully imprisoned his  family.  Judah Ben-Hur gets the revenge he desired, but he doesn't gain a  sense of fullfillment.  His victory leaves him feeling &quot;empty&quot;  and hollow.  What's amazing about this movie is that Christ is only  featured in a few scenes and has no dialog, but his mere presence has an  immense impact on the life of Judah Ben-Hur.  From a simple act of giving  him a drink of water (which gives him the desire to live) to the time of  the crucifixtion when the act is done in reverse.Now that Warner  Brothers has acquired the rights to a good many of MGM's films, I wonder  when they'll get around to releasing a new digitally remastered version on  DVD.

392815,A16QODENBJVUI1,6303961614,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","I have an extremely conflicted relationship with STARGATE SG-1.  On the one hand, I think it one of the most consistently entertaining shows on TV, almost always featuring very strong individual episodes with remarkably few truly awful episodes.  Although THE X-FILES was a much greater series than STARGATE SG-1, it probably had far more truly weak episodes (although it also had many more truly great ones).  STARGATE SG-1's greatest virtue is its amazing consistency.  Given that it is now heading into its tenth season, its track record for steadily solid episodes is almost without precedent.  On the other hand, there was after Seasons Two and Three an opportunity to do something extraordinary, the potential for true greatness.  In those two seasons it appeared that the show was going to embrace the long story arc format with one episode after another spilling into the next.  Unfortunately, that did not occur.  Luckily the show does possess a memory, and frequently builds new episodes on previous episodes.  But in the end its narrative is more like STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION instead of FARSCAPE or FIREFLY.  When I reflect on how good the individual episodes are, I inevitably wonder just how good the show could have been if in Seasons Four and Five they had fully embraced the long narrative format.Why didn't STARGATE embrace the long narrative format after seemingly flirting with it in the second and third seasons?  My suspicion is that the network put pressure on them to stress stand alone episodes.  Networks are leery of long narrative shows because the assumption is that it makes it more difficult to attract new viewers.  There is undoubtedly some truth to this.  It would have been very hard for a new viewer to pick up BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in the middle of Season Five while someone trying to start right now with LOST would have a great deal of difficulty, just as someone trying to start 24 with the 13th hour would be very much at a loss.  But there is also no question that the long narrative format is vastly superior as entertainment and as art for the viewers.  There is simply no greater experience on television than becoming deeply immersed in a series as it tells a rapidly developing and evolving story.Another mark of the long narrative format is character development.  Think of how much Aeryn Sun grew and changed over four seasons of FARSCAPE or Cordelia or Willow in BUFFY.  One of the marks of the best shows is how characters change and grow over the course of a series.  In this regard, STARGATE was by the end of Season Five quite a disappointment.  Even factoring in Daniel Jackson's ascension at the end of the season, none of the main characters had changed or grown since the show began.  Compare this to any of the main characters on BUFFY, where all of the characters had changed dramatically.  Another contrast with BUFFY:  each season of BUFFY was strikingly different from any other season.  The show never was content with simply doing the same thing each year.  Unfortunately, by Season Five of STARGATE it was pretty clear that the series had fallen into a formula.  It had become a ""safe"" show, one that was not going to play with its core formula or truly shake things up.  At the end of Season Five the ascension of Daniel Jackson seemed to show promise for altering the formula, but that was a hope that would prove short lived.So the show had at the end of Season Five become enormously dependable.  Each episode was almost certainly going to be a good one, but it was also going to be one in which nothing new was truly going to happen.  It had become a show whose each episode I would very much look forward to, but one that never caused the viewer to say, ""Oh my God!  What's going to happen next!?""  That is a question that I always asked with BUFFY or ANGEL or LOST or FARSCAPE or even SMALLVILLE, but that I never wanted to ask with STARGATE.I find all of this tragic.  One of my regrets about STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION is that it ran before shows like THE X-FILES and BUFFY made it possible for Sci-fi or supernatural shows to embrace the long narrative format.  I find it perplexing that STARGATE did not choose to do so.  It did, however, by continuously referring to previous episodes give some of the feeling of the long narrative format.  But I would have so much more enjoyed the series if each week left many of the central plot elements unresolved.  I would have liked to see an episode effect a character so deeply that they couldn't forget what had happened for weeks to come.Still, all in all this remained an extremely fine Sci-fi series.  And even as we head into Season Ten it remains a show that I enjoy very much indeed.",5,Another fine set of episodes for one of TV's most consistent shows,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,4724,"['have',

Having said that, I had already grown fond of Jonas Quinn (Corin Nemec) in the role of Jackson's replacement on the SG-1 team by the middle of season 5.Without giving away too much for those who haven't yet seen season 5, I would like to say that I think fans will like season 5 for the development of new metaphysical themes and the emergence of a major new bad guy to fill the vacuum left by Apophis.The DVD set also comes with some pretty nice featurettes, including cast diaries, photo galleries, audio commentaries for each episode, and a ""tribute"", of sorts, for Daniel Jackson (which may turn out to be a little premature).My copy of the DVD set also came with a complimentary copy of the premiere episode of  ""Jeremiah"", an apocalyptic sci-fi TV series, which appears to have just finished one or two seasons on cable.  I have yet to view it, but the price is right.  There was another neat little flier enclosed in the DVD case granting the owner to ""SG-1 bucks"" that may be redeemed at the online SG-1 store.
