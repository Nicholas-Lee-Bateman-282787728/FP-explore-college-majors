The lesbian sex (primarily with the Marina character and a flaky bi-airhead named Jenny) was non-threatening to any male viewing the show.  And in truth and boyfriend Tim have more sex between them than all the lesbians on the show combined.  I not looking for porn, but just as much passion and lust, and frequency, between the women.  The way the physical relations are between the women, make me think that this show is out to draw a lot of men.I didn't expect to see stereotype 350lbs. dykes on bikes, but did every lead character have to be fashion model thin.The stories were weak.  I read a review comparing this show to a soap opera, I think that's an insult to soaps.  This show walks a straight path of mediocrity.I have HBO and watched The Wire, I also watched Six Feet Under for a while.

841416,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B0002MPQRS,A reader,"[12, 14]","I often find myself bucking the tide, and here I go again.  I avoided The L Word for a long time because I feared it would be unrealistic in its depiction of lesbians.  Although I know there are lesbians in the real world who look totally straight, are extremely feminine, have tons of money and very mainstream values, I'd have to say that yes, my fears were realized.  I've been out for 35 years and I know zero lesbians who match the profile of any of the women on this show.  So then I had to decide if I could simply sit back and enjoy the show for what it is:  cheesy entertainment.  First I had to overcome my almost immediate hatred for the leading couple on the show, Bette and Tina, who spend the pilot episode trying to locate the appropriate sperm to make a baby via artifical insemination.  Have these highbrow, professional ladies never heard of the sperm bank?  Rather than doing it the scientific way, carefully choosing an anonymous donor from a reputable sperm bank, they interview their male friends and acquaintances, none of whom is just right.  And then at the last minute, these two very choosy lesbians decide to have unprotected sex with a strange guy they pick up at a lecture!  The stupidity and cluelessness of these two characters made my jaw drop.  And over time, my interest in this couple never grew.  Tina is vapid, dull and depressed; Bette is more dynamic, but humorless and dry.  These women never seem to be having a good time!  Making them the central characters is a serious weakness of this series.Other reviewers have mentioned the problems with the character of Jenny, so I won't bore the reader with repetitious criticisms, except to say that anytime Jenny is on the screen is a good time to take a bathroom break or get a beer from the fridge.But after watching the entire first season, I figured out what the strong suit of The L Word is:  satire.  When it's funny, it's really funny.  Viewed as a satiric take on our up-to-the-moment political and cultural trends and fads, The L Word really shines.  From Alice's ""male lesbian"" boy/girlfriend, Lisa, to the group therapy sessions for expectant parents, to Rosanna Arquette's kinky sexual predator, to Snoop Dogg's sleaze-ball hiphop impresario -- well, let's just say that I laughed out loud more than I expected to, and those moments were a real pleasure.In addition, the casting of Helen Shaver in the role of Bette's right-wing Christian fanatic nemesis was a stroke of genius.  Shaver is loved by millions of middle-aged lesbians for her ultra-romantic turn as an uptight English professor brought to her lesbian senses in ""Desert Hearts,"" and here she is cast as an activist, homophobic bigot with considerable skeletons in her own closet.  Brilliant!Bottom line, The L Word turns out to be fairly entertaining if you don't look too deep or expect too much realism from these plastic, shiny, sleazy and flaky players.Oh, and one last thing - there seems to be more hot and loving sex depicted between heterosexuals than between the lesbians.

I went to the library and rented the entire first season and spent a Friday afternoon watching the first disc.  And that, fair maidens, is as far as it's going to go.Now, I knew before I ever saw this show that it was created as an afterthought behind the success of Sex and the City.  But gay, straight, or completely confused, there is no way that the writing in the L Word even approaches the wit, humor, and poignancy of S&TC.;  Of course, the women are just as self-absorbed in LA as they are in NYC.  But for this viewer, the L Word is just absurd.We've got two power lesbians who keep saying, ""let's make a baby.""  Two women cannot ""make"" a baby.  This notion is ridiculous.  Next, we've got a near-anorexic hairdresser who is nothing more than a womanizing-rock star type who happens to be a female.  This casting is completely transparent.

In the beginning, during the first few episodes, I didn't think I was going to particularly care for the series, but as I progressed further into each episode I began to care more and more about each character.The series revolves around a group of lesbians (and one or two bisexuals) whose lives are intertwined in one way or another.  On the whole, the issues touched upon in this first season are the kind one would find in every day ordinary life, namely love, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, etc.  It is fun to watch this group interact with one another.  You'll also find several episodes dedicated to larger societal issues, such as censorship and gay parenting.On the whole, however, you will not be bogged down with excessive political agenda-setting maneuvering, and I appreciated that this series didn't attempt to resolve all the world's problems in one fell swoop in its first season.  You won't find any over-the-top Rosie O'Donnell-type obnoxiousness, and I suspect the series wouldn't be as successful as it has been if this had been the case. There is a nice balance in this first season, and those who aren't inclined towards misandry, misanthropy, or the chronic malcontent mindset will surely find something to like somewhere along the way.One thing I didn't particularly care for, and which is not exclusive to this show in particular, was the fact that almost all the characters are beautiful, slim and trim, and have very interesting careers and lives.  Come on.  We all know better.  But then again, I doubt very many people would want to watch the daily machinations and inner workings of this subculture's most obnoxious and undesireable.All in all, I really enjoyed the first season of The L Word.",4,"Entertaining, but a tad unrealistic.....",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1777,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'L', 'Word', 'beginning', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'particularly', 'care', 'series', 'progressed', 'further', 'episode', 'began', 'care', 'more', 'more', 'character.The', 'series', 'group', 'lesbians', 'one', 'two', 'bisexuals', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'one', 'way', 'whole', 'issues', 'touched', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'kind', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'day', 'ordinary', 'life', 'namely', 'love', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'jealousy', 'etc', 'fun', 'watch', 'group', 'interact', 'one', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'several', 'episodes', 'dedicated', 'larger', 'societal', 'issues', 'such', 'censorship', 'gay', 'parenting.On', 'whole', 'however', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bogged', 'down', 'excessive', 'political', 'agenda-setting', 'maneuvering', 'appreciated', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'resolve', 'world', 'problems', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'first', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'over-the-top', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell-type"", 'obnoxiousness', 'suspect', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'case', 'nice', 'balance', 'first', 'season', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'inclined', 'towards', 'misandry', 'misanthropy', 'chronic', 'malcontent', 'mindset', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'somewhere', 'way.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'not', 'exclusive', 'show', 'particular', 'was', 'fact', 'almost', 'characters', 'are', 'beautiful', 'slim', 'trim', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'careers', 'lives', 'Come', 'know', 'better', 'then', 'again', 'doubt', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'daily', 'machinations', 'inner', 'workings', 'subculture', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'undesireable.All', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'L', 'Word']",The L Word: Season 1

Is this supposed to be controversial television? Pretty much change the lesbian tension to heterosexual tension and you would have any nighttime soap on television.I am a big fan of Queer as Folk and the comparisons are pointless. Queer as Folk is a better show, with better writing, better acting and characters that make you feel something and even, if you watch long enough, make you feel as if you know them. While watching the L Word; I was just begging for these women to shut up. I mean, it was pretty much bed-hopping, complaining and then sitting around drinking lattes and complaining some more. Deadly boring in my point-of-view but would it have hurt to insert some humor, some light-heartedness?Also, I keep reading in these reviews that finally a show that represents lesbians? I do congratulate them for moving beyond the butch stereotype but they traded it for another stereotype, the femme one.

However, as a gay man who faces some of the same issues the QAF characters face, I prefer to not be reminded of what is to come or what I have overcome.  Not to say I do not and have not enjoyed gay TV or QAF.  So when the L-word was introduced, I was MAJORLY intriqued. Since I missed the entire first season when it aired, I rented it!  I was hooked after episode 1 and watched the whole season in a weekend.  I'm not sure which plot I liked the most, the Marina and Jenny affair, Dana coming out to her parents, or Bette and Tina's up and downs.  The only thing I was disappointed about was Marina not being a part of season 2.  Upsides: everything else.  I think the young lady cast as Jenny gets my vote for best actor not to say they are not all good.

This series explores the everyday lives of a powerful group of Los Angeles based lesbians.  They all seem polished, professional and fit (not a plus size girl in site or someone with just a regular ole life).  The show is basically revolved around Jennifer Beals and her girlfriend of seven years.  Jennifer is all into her career while her girlfriend seems much more interested in starting a family than she is.  This show is cool for people who are interested on just how the other side might be living.  The lesbian in crown deals with a lot of the same issues that heterosexual couples do.  When the girls meet to talk at the cafe they hang out at, I can't help to think of the show as a lesbian Sex and The City, but this drama is really good, but doesn't have a high re-watch value, so if you love the show buy it, if youa re just curious you might want to rent it or borrow it before you buy it.

They look comfortable and convincing playing the ""stable committed"" couple  amongst the trendy, thin, beautiful, typical,  Los Angeles gay women on the first season of HBO's  ""The L World.""  At least that's the impression I gotRemember  that  boring English assignment back in middle school, ""write an essay explaining what a peanut butter jelly sandwich is to a martian who just arrived on earth.""  Well, if you are living in the suburbs and isn't really familiar with gay life in Los Angeles, or much less about gay life,  this tv show might be that essay.  Or is it?But enough with the social anthropology, back to the opinion page.  I think Jennifer Beals is just gorgeous to look at, when she smiles , her whole face smiles.  She is very sincere as the Alpha female in this relationship and when she's with Laurel, they really seem like they are a couple struggling with a saggy, seven year relationship.  The writers of the show put a lot of effort in mapping out the various characters and how they fit with each other but it's great that they put a lot of considerations in the Beals and Holloman characters.  There are a lot of eye cathcing scenes like the one where Bette (Beals) though that she was still struggling with the advances of an attractive female and whispers ""I'm sorry I can't,""  but walla, it's Tina (Holloman) giving her a bear hug from behind.  The first episode ended with Bette and Tina in an intense, intimate embrace and that's also how the season ended although the love making was done after a violent confrontation.  Beals and Chaiken did an audio commentary on the first disc and pointed out that the first love scene was difficult to shoot and had to be choeographed meticulously, it would have been nice if the two did the same on the last disc.  I was interested to know how much effort it took to shoot that last scene.  It was a very effective scene  but  Beals and Holloman must have had some misgivings  or at least some difficulties  in filming this scene.  Well, if you already own the DVD or plan on watching it, you will know what I mean..  It  was kinda hard to watch, but this kind of thing, I think happens to a lot of straight couples as well.  I will agree that the DVD didn't have enough stuff in it, but I do advice that you might want to rent it first before buying.

Nothing is original or worth watching. Unfortunately all the more interesting shows are on premium cable channels that costs more than I care to pay for. One of those shows I have always wanted to check out is ""The L Word"". I finally got around to renting the series on dvd. It did not take me very long to become addicted to this provocative series on a group of lesbians and their life in Los Angeles.The backbone of the series I think is Bette (the immortal Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman). This is one of the most realistic portrayals of a long-term lesbian relationship that I have ever seen on a mainstream show but then again most mainstream shows wouldn't touch this subject with a ten foot pole without offending Big Brother (i.e the Parents Television Council). Like any heterosexual couple, Bette and Tina have their fair share of ups and downs in their relationship. They are as human as the next person. Bette has an older sister named Kit (Pam Grier) on the show.Their neighbors is Tim (Eric Mabius) and Jenny (Mia Kirshner). Jenny just moved in with Tim from Chicago. What she didn't expect was her world to be completely turned upside down by Marina (the smoking hot Karina Lombard) who owns the local coffee shop The Planet.Rounding out the cast is ex-Murmurs Leisha Haily as the bisexual Alice, Erin Daniels as Dana (a closeted tennis player), and Katherine Moennig as the playboy (or playgirl) of the group Shane.What I like about ""The L Word"" is that the writing is sharp, witty, and the portrayal of lesbians is more real than what I would see on network tv and in mainstream movies. Still the show is not without its flaws. Lesbians comes in all shapes and sizes from butches to drag kings. On the other hand the lesbians on the show is not your atypical porn star that you would see on a Vivid picture. Other than the lack of diversity, I enjoyed the series.

The end result of the L Word, however, casts a large net by telling compelling, interesting stories of compelling, interesting women.Set in in the great sin city, Los Angeles, the L Word tells the story of several women who are friends. Bette and Tina, the show's ""power couple"", start the series trying to concieve a child and suffer the problems of finding an adequate sperm donor. Tennis player Dana is just starting to come to terms with her orientation and the demands of a burgeoning successful career. Writer Alice, the group's bisexual, plays sweet while dealing with a kooky mother and a male ""self-professed lesbian"". Shane, who starts out as the show's loose cannon, grows into her character as the episodes progress to a complex woman actually dealing with strong feelings. And then there's Tim and Jenny, who test the bounds of their relationship when Jenny starts an affair with coffee shop owner, sultry Marina. Each of these women are self-realized and very real.Kudos goes to the women who play these characters honestly, and realistically. You can see each of them grow into their performances as they get comfortable in their characters skins, especially with Jennifer Beals portrayal of Type-A Bette. Also, kudos to Mia Kirshner, who gives Jenny's struggle through the first season real heart and intrigue. She is everyone who has ever struggled with their sexual identity, and Mia nails the struggle on the head.However, it's one Pam Grier, who plays Bette's straight sister Kit, who will run away with your heart as she wrestles with the demons of her alcoholic past. Pam is absolutely luminous in her role; somehow managing to play each scene with dignity and sorrow. If one should be turned off by the content of the show, one should watch it if only for Grier's beautiful performance.And the content of the show is definitely not for everyone. Easily offensive to those people who prefer one closed-minded version of the world, the L Word may not be for them.

It didn't take that long to figure that a lot has been borrowed from Sex in the City & Queer as Folk. That is by no means a knock. Indeed it is a positive. ""Sex""  & ""Queer"" are two of the three best cable shows ever. We all know who the 800 lb gorilla of cable is. Girlfriends gathering together ala ""Sex"", at a coffee shop, albeit more uptown than ""Queer"". They are all talking about sex & the politics of sex. Four Hot straight women, Five (or more) hot gay guys & now six (or more) hot, gay chicks. The first two episodes: Jenny, a naif, from Chicago comes to L.A. to live with her boyfriend, Tim, & start a new life as a writer. She meets next door neighbors, Bette & Tina who have been together as a couple for seven years. They are seeking a sperm donor so they can start a family. They invite Tim & Jenny to some of their parties which introduces Jenny to a  life- style she never knew existed. It interests & frightens her... a little. She meets Marina, who is very attracted to her. Poor little Jenny. By the end of the secnd episode she is so confused. She really does love Tim & he her. But soon she is in a relationship with Marina. A great supporting cast adds color & humor. The second season has already been on dvd for a while.

841438,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0002MPQRS,kaduzy,"[19, 39]","I heard so many good things about this show that I went ahead and checked out the whole season from the library to see what all the hype was about.Now that I've watched every episode, I think the hype has mainly to do with the fact that these women are honest to goodness lesbians.  It's not just some women coyly making kissy-face for the benefit of heterosexual men's arousal, it's about the actual relationships these women go through, and all the ups and downs.  I like that, and I was very hopeful about the show not only being true to that but also giving me an inside look into a community I don't know very much about.  I was looking forward to being not only entertained, but informed.Unfortunately, all I found when I got to this show was stiff acting, mediocre writing, and a closet full of material knocked off of other shows.  Basically, this show is ""Sex and the City"" except it takes place in Los Angeles and everyone is gay.  That's it!  There's not much new here.Some of the things characters say are either grating in their unrealistic cheesiness, or downright unbelievable.  In the very first episode, the token straight female character (who likely won't remain straight for long in this world of shifting sexual identity) makes a speech about how the characters need to stick together and really love one another and be a family or something like that.  It's the kind of speech you find tucked into movies when people need motivating.  The problem is that after one episode, I am not invested in these people enough to really believe what she's saying, and it sounds fake.  This character is played by Pam Grier, a wonderful actress who has put on a lot of weight recently.  I found myself actually worrying more about her health than about her character!The two main people seem to be Bette and Tina.  Bette is a biracial art gallery director played by Jennifer Beals (yes, the girl from ""Flashdance"") and she is the one getting top billing for this show, so much of the story revolves around her.  She and her partner of seven years, Tina (Laurel Holloman -- yes, the girl from ""Angel"") are trying to have a baby and the first episode tracks them as they try to get some sperm.  At one point, Bette is asked by the doctor to go down on Tina to ""relax"" her while they're in the office.  This is the most exploitative, unrealistic thing I've ever seen.  What's the point?  We KNOW it's a show about lesbians, thanks Showtime.  The episode is full of lines like, ""[This cup of sperm looks so] disgusting!  I can't believe I used to swallow that stuff.""  Is the show trying to make a statement about sexuality?  The only person on the show who seems to have been actually ""born"" a lesbian is the tennis player character, Dana.  But not a single episode explores the causes of sexuality, it just makes side comments about them, and the comment seems to be that evey gay woman has a straight girl inside her somewhere.  This is the myth that straight men like to perpetuate -- as if every gay woman just needs a good man to ""snap her out of it.""  I call it the Ben Affleck syndrome, and I am so disappointed that it's being perpetuated on this show.The show isn't really that funny, and the characters are too broadly drawn to really hit home.  Beals has a few good moments when she's fighting for artisic freedom at her gallery against a group of cardboard-cut-out conservatives, but her character is done an extreme diservice in the worst episode by far, which is ""Locked Up.""  In this episode, Bette is thrown into jail for fighting with protestors, along with the lesbian who's doing her gallery construction for the controversial exhibit.  Her attraction to this woman and her decision to cheat on Tina don't seem true to her character, and this episode features the two of them in a jail cell.  The scene is laughable, not only for its unrealistic depiction of what ACTUALLY happens when you're arrested (and yes, I know something about that) but because it looks like something straight out of a porn movie designed to arouse straight men.  What a cop-out!  It's sweaty and cheesy and such a diservice to these actors and these characters.Another irksome thing is the show's tendancy to open every episode with some kind of flashback.  Most of these are totally pointless, only tangential to the story in that episode, and very poorly done.  It reminds me of the first few seasons of ""Sex and the City"" when they used to have ""real"" New Yorkers commenting on the topic Carrie was writing about.  The difference is that those were funny, and fun to watch.  The openings of this show are emphatically not.  Also annoying as hell is the ""music"" that plays over the opening credits.  It sounds like the kind of computerized schlock that people come up with when they first figure out how to use their MIDI player.  Are there any professionals in the house?  Come ON, guys.  Get with it.The best character/actress on this show is Shane, played by Katherine Moennig.  Wow!  I've never heard of her before, but she's amazing.  She's gorgeous, and her character has the most interesting arc, and the most interesting history.  Either she's practically the only actress capable of carrying off the bad writing, or she just gets all the best lines.  Either way, she's a joy to watch and definitely on the list of women who are the answer to that question, ""If you had to switch teams for anyone, who would it be?""  Well now Shane/Katherine's up there with Angelina Jolie!The worst character is Jenny (Mia Kirshner).  Aside from the actress being so skinny and pale that she's often painful to look at, her character is touted as being this fantastic writer -- yet the samples we are given of her work sound like a 7th grader's diary.  Her character starts off as a straight girl living with her boyfriend cum fiancee Tim (the delicious, delicious Eric Mabius, who was often the only reason I stopped myself from skipping the crappier episodes).  We are supposed to believe that she'd stray from this cushy set-up (rent free in LA!) and this gorgeous man so that she can go be a lesbian for awhile.  Her character is grating, annoying, lying, conniving and so stupid that I kept hoping she'd be hit by a bus or otherwise removed from the proceedings.  One can only hope her role will be cut down severely in the next season.But I won't know, because I won't be watching.  This show is just not that great.  I guess it's nice that gay women finally have a show of their own like gay men do (Actually gay men have a bunch -- all of them better done than this one!) but I think the lesbian community deserves better and can do better than this program.  I don't think it represents them very well.  After all, there's no way they're ALL fashion-model-thin thirty-somethings with plenty of money and free time!  And to be quite frank, the world presented here is quite dull, and I don't believe the real lesbian community (in LA or ANY city) is this devoid of spark.So I'm sorry ladies, but I can't support you with this one -- I'll be busy watching something else.",2,"""L"" is for Lack of Imagination",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,7074,"['heard', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'went', 'ahead',

It has the quality of the early Sopranos shows.  I find it annoying to see someone else's review, limiting this magnificent series to only four stars because something about the DVD package displeased them.  Nonsense.  The hell with the DVD package.  Watch the show and if you have any taste at all you must give it five stars because it is the finest work out there.  If you don't appreciate this, you can't tell a diamond from glass.For me so far, the most compelling character is Jenny, the bisexual girl engaged to a man but seduced by a woman.  She is usually beautiful, when the director isn't making her look haggard and tired.  She has the appeal of a Susanna Hoffs, and Susanna is, in my eyes, the image of feminine perfection.  But Jenny is a bit of a flake, unable to level with her fiancee.  The sexual predator who has seduced her has singled out the vulnerable calf in the herd and eaten it.  And yet there is something likeable about her too, about Marina, though she is devious and overrates herself and her lifestyle.Parts of these shows have me laughing loud.  There are some subtle moments that just get me rolling.  It is sometimes so subtle that once you explain it, it doesn't sound funny.  Here's an example.Shane, Alice and Dana are conducting an ""intervention"" to stop Bette and Tina from being boring.  Shane and Alice wrap up the intervention by telling Bette and Tina that they love them, and Dana says ""ditto"", and Alice jabs her with her elbow to let her know that ""ditto"" really isn't enough.  It's just the expressions on the faces, Alice's attitude, Dana's reaction, that cracks me up.Alice is hysterical, Shane is awfully appealing, Dana is best when she is giving one of her subtle looks, Tina is Miss Saint, Jenny is sensitive perfection in a flaky biscuit, Bette is a great actress, Marina is Miss Exotic, so self possessed.For those of you who believe in eternal souls, and that an eternal soul can have a gender different from the body's gender, an issue particularly appropriate to a series about lesbians, I'd say that if our souls can have opposite genders to our bodies, the prime candidates for boy soul in female body would be Marina, Shane and Bette.  Tina and Jenny are girly girls to the core.In a sense, this series shows people not always on their best behavior.  But I don't think it really comes too close to the depths we all sink to on a fairly regular basis.  It still shows attractive characters behaving in a way that is usually enjoyable to watch, unlike reality, which often disgusts us.  I have yet to see a really realistic show about anything.",5,Perhaps the finest tv series ever done,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2746,"['have', 'only', 'seen', 'pilot', '8', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'running', 'greatest', 'tv', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'quality', 'early', 'Sopranos', 'shows', 'find', 'annoying', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'review', 'limiting', 'magnificent', 'series', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'something', 'DVD', 'package', 'displeased', 'Nonsense', 'hell', 'DVD', 'package', 'Watch', 'show', 'have', 'taste', 'must', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'finest', 'work', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'diamond', 'glass.For', 'so', 'far', 'most', 'compelling', 'character', 'Jenny', 'bisexual', 'girl', 'engaged', 'man', 'seduced', 'woman', 'usually', 'beautiful', 'when', 'director', ""n't"", 'making', 'look', 'haggard', 'tired', 'appeal', 'Susanna', 'Hoffs', 'Susanna', 'eyes', 'image', 'feminine', 'perfection', 'Jenny', 'bit', 'flake', 'unable', 'level', 'fiancee', 'sexual', 'predator', 'who', 'seduced', 'singled', 'out', 'vulnerable', 'calf', 'herd', 'eaten', 'yet', 'something', 'likeable', 'too', 'Marina', 'devious', 'lifestyle.Parts', 'shows', 'have', 'laughing', 'loud', 'are', 'subtle', 'moments', 'just', 'get', 'rolling', 'sometimes', 'so', 'subtle', 'once', 'explain', ""n't"", 'sound', 'funny', 'Here', 'example.Shane', 'Alice', 'Dana', 'are', 'conducting', 'intervention', 'stop', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'being', 'boring', 'Shane', 'Alice', 'wrap', 'up', 'intervention', 'telling', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'love', 'Dana', 'ditto', 'Alice', 'jabs', 'elbow', 'let', 'know', 'ditto', 'really', ""n't"", 'enough', 'just', 'expressions', 'Alice', 'attitude', 'Dana', 'reaction', 'cracks', 'up.Alice', 'hysterical', 'Shane', 'awfully', 'appealing', 'Dana', 'best', 'when', 'giving', 'one', 'subtle', 'looks', 'Tina', 'Miss', 'Saint', 'Jenny', 'sensitive', 'perfection', 'flaky', 'biscuit', 'Bette', 'great', 'actress', 'Marina', 'Miss', 'Exotic', 'so', 'self', 'possessed.For', 'who', 'believe', 'eternal', 'souls', 'eternal', 'soul', 'can', 'have', 'gender', 'different', 'body', 'gender', 'issue', 'particularly', 'appropriate', 'series', 'lesbians', ""'d"", 'say', 'souls', 'can', 'have', 'opposite', 'genders', 'bodies', 'prime', 'candidates', 'boy', 'soul', 'female', 'body', 'would', 'be', 'Marina', 'Shane', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'Jenny', 'are', 'girly', 'girls', 'core.In', 'sense', 'series', 'people', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'too', 'close', 'depths', 'sink', 'fairly', 'regular', 'basis', 'still', 'attractive', 'characters', 'behaving', 'way', 'usually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'reality', 'often', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'really', 'realistic', 'show', 'anything']",The L Word: Season 1

Looking like the average bloke enhanced the empathy factor, or made us laugh harder, because we knew that could be us or mirrored our lives. Today television is populated by boring, self-congratulating pretty people, which is why I rarely stray from the likes of the History Channel, CNN and ESPN. Still, some people prefer to live in a world of make-believe, and this is no different with the producers and actors in ""The `L' Word."" I hate to break it to those people, but lesbians tend to dress like men, act like men--and look like men. The ""hot babe"" is about as foreign to the lesbian demographic as ""Mexicans"" are to the nativist crowd these days.Of course, if television actually portrayed the ""L"" word folks as they really are, that would be a ratings loser, since it would cause some sensitive-stomached viewers to lose their lunch (and supper, too).  We might even find ample examples of misandry and discrimination; Minneapolis Fire Chief Bonnie Bleskachek was recently demoted (rather than fired) for discriminating against men and women who were not gay, and giving preferential treatment to lesbians and those who associated with them.

I found it incredibly well done and not trying to suggest that it was a representative sample.  This is not research, it has to bow to the God of ratings and corporate sponsorship.  Sex sells.  And many of the sex scenes are very well done.  The ones that bore me I fast forward through.  Mostly, their sex is an extension of these women's lives, which is how most folk I know live.It sports snatches of ""Sex in the City"" cafe check-ins and is the next generation, the female generation after ""Queer as Folk""...the latter of which I could never get into.

Barclay ""Sapphyre""","[3, 3]","One of the main reasons I purchased the first season of The L Word was because I came into the series late, at the beginning of Season 3.  So of course I wanted to know how it all came about.Season One finds Jenny Scheckter moving in with her fiancee Tim in sunny LA.  Soon, she finds out her neighbors are something else again.  After witnessing Shane and her girlfriend making out in the pool, Jenny becomes fascinated with the lesbian lifestyle.  As she gets out and begins meeting people, her curiosity soars.  When she meets Marina at a party ... fascination becomes infatuation.  Then the drama really begins.Unable to resist Marina's attentions, she and Jenny enter into an affair.  Tim one day finds them out and after a brief reconciliation the marriage ends in an annulment.Season one introduced some of the most interesting characters, only to let them slowly slip into oblivion by mid Season Two.  The most sorely missed to me is the character of Ivan ... a drag king who became deeply smitten with Kit.  I thought this character lent a lighthearted romantic tag to the series and I'd love to see her written back in.The most tense moment was in the end when Tina caught on to Bette and the carpenter (sorry the character's name escapes me at the moment) and Tina leaves.  The heartwrenching struggle Dana had to endure coming out, not only to the public but to her parents lent good drama to the series as well, and was handled, I thought, in an appropriate manner, although I'd like to have seen her mother come around a little sooner.Overall, I adore this series, I'll be purchasing Season Two so I have the whole thing to watch over and over again.

They are about to do an incredibly major thing...Into this mix comes Shane, a girl with short black hair who doesn't get involved with anybody; Alice, the bisexual writer who has one conviction that we're all connected through love, through loneliness, through one tiny, lamentable lapse in judgment; Dana who refuses to accept that whether you're gay, or you're straight, or you're bisexual, you just go with the flow; Jenny who has her world turned upside down when she met, at a party, the most stunning woman she had ever seen; Marina the owner of the little caf&eacute; who doesn't think she has done something wrong; and Kit, the lady with the flashing eyes, who has always wanted to have a place where musicians could come and jam and get much love...As Bette, Jennifer Beals is a very well-rounded individual... She keeps replaying it over and over again in her head, just trying to figure out the exact moment when she could have stopped herself...As Tina, Laurel Holloman gets the feeling from Bette that she's so proud to be with her, and she makes her feel really safe and loved...As Shane, Katherine Moennig is amazing... She is an unattainable beauty who practices sex with no emotional entanglements...As Alice, Leisha Hailey is constantly complaining about feeling sluggish... She ends up with the most complicated interpretation of sexual identity she's ever encountered...Mia Kirshner gives the picture of togetherness and sanity to Jenny... She's beautiful and that compensates for a multitude of sins... While she is truly in love with Tim her increasing fascination with Marina permits her life to be wrecked with supposition...Karina Lombard is definitely beautiful, sophisticated and hot as Marina... The really thing about her character is when she focuses on Jenny we truly feel that Jenny is the only human being that exists for her...Erin Daniels knows that she is gay but is indecisive to reveal it...Lolita Davidovitch is not exactly an innocent bystander... She tries to make others jealous in order to find the others desirable...Rosanna Arquette never felt more alive than she has in the last 20 years of her life... But would she leave her husband, her child, her houses, her trips to Paris, her black-tie galas to run to some rank little love nest with a nice assistant hairdresser who barely has her foot in the door?Much could be said about every character... Each actress takes on controversial subject while still injecting true different feelings...",4,'There's only one thing that cuts across all our realities... It's love.

841454,A27XLRTG0ZIDNO,B0002MPQRS,"Roy ""mmm_chicken""","[12, 13]","When I first heard the premise for The L Word, I was pretty skeptical. A show centering around a group of lesbians seemed very gimmicky. Still, I decided to take a chance on it and give it a try because it seemed like something different from what is usually offered on television.It's a good thing I did. The L Word is probably the smartest, most thought-provoking, sexiest, and, most importantly, incredibly entertaining show to premiere on TV in years. By the end of the first episode, I was already caught up in the lives of these great characters. What struck me most was that I found myself forgetting these were lesbians. I came to think of them simply as people trying to live their lives the best way they could, which is what the writers were trying to go for.The acting is just terrific. Jennifer Beals is so good, she makes you forget she is the girl from Flashdance very quickly. Her best scene is when she is facing off against Faye Buckley on a TV show and is hit with an incredibly hateful critique. In my opinion, Mia Kirshner had the trickiest part as Jenny, the wide-eyed straight girl who almost instantly begins a same sex relationship with the very beautiful Marina. Many times I was rolling my eyes at what this girl was doing because she just seemed so aggravating, but she always seemed like a regular person caught up in an emotional whirlwind, which is a testament to Kirshner's skills. Really, though, the entire cast is great. By the end of the season, I couldn't find a weak link at all. Everyone cared about their character and it shows on screen.The writers also need to be commended. There were plenty of times when I didn't know why a character was doing what they did, but a few episodes later their reasoning would subtly be revealed, making it seem reasonable. Every character went through an emotional turning point by the end of the season, giving us an entire cast of well-developed characters, another rarity in television.I highly recommend this show. It is incredible and when the sad final scene is finished on the season finale, you will be left wanting more.

841455,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B0002MPQRS,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[2, 8]","In my humble opinion, the L Word leaves much to be desired. First of all, the lesbians here are all very sleek-looking, and always dressed to-the-nines. Where are all the plainly dressed, overweight, average-looking, or senior citizen lesbians in this series? I mean c'mon! I realize that there are plenty of feminine, lip-stick lesbian sisters out there. And, I say that they should fully exercise their right to dress and act however they wish. But, the L Word is SATURATED with mainly high-femme lesbians with long, dark hair, and stunning out-fits. I know that they have Shane in this show, but she seems to be just a token butch. And Max is the show's token transman.If the L Word truly wants to be representative of the lesbian community, then they should include more lesbians that are on the butch side, working-class, punk, poor, struggling entertainers and artists, etc. I know that LA is the glam-chic capital of the US. But it's also a major metropolis, with a rich variety of lesbians-NOT just up-scale high-femmes.Another thing that bothers me about this show, is that they use too much gratuitous profanity. I know that most people do use some profanity in real life, but most of these characters use too much gutter language to be believable. It's as if the producers want to show how 'cool' this show is, by having the characters constantly spewing four-letter words.They also have too many cheap, tawdry sex-scenes on this show. Yes, plenty of cheap, tawdry sex probably happens in the lesbian community. It's a long-standing myth, that most lesbians don't value plain old raw sex. Many (if not most) can, and do. But sex is definitely over-emphasized in the show. It's thrown in your face, in a manner so blatant, that it's obviously done only for shock-value. It doesn't enhance the plot-lines, and seems tacky and contrived.We need a show on the air about lesbians from all segments of the community. And the L Word just isn't presenting that. This show is so lacking in depth, realistic characters, and taste, that it's mediocre at best.",2,Mediocre at best.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2059,"['humble', 'opinion', 'L', 'Word', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'First', 'all', 'lesbians', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'sleek-looking', 'always', 'dressed', 'to-the-nines', 'Where', 'are', 'plainly', 'dressed', 'overweight', 'average-looking', 'senior', 'citizen', 'lesbians', 'series', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'realize', 'are', 'plenty', 'feminine', 'lip-stick', 'lesbian', 'sisters', 'out', 'there', 'say', 'should', 'fully', 'exercise', 'right', 'dress', 'act', 'however', 'wish', 'L', 'Word', 'SATURATED', 'mainly', 'high-femme', 'lesbians', 'long', 'dark', 'hair', 'stunning', 'out-fits', 'know', 'have', 'Shane', 'show', 'be', 'just', 'token', 'butch', 'Max', 'show', 'token', 'transman.If', 'L', 'Word', 'truly', 'be', 'representative', 'lesbian', 'community', 'then', 'should', 'include', 'more', 'lesbians', 'are', 'butch', 'side', 'working-class', 'punk', 'poor', 'struggling', 'entertainers', 'artists', 'etc', 'know', 'LA', 'glam-chic', 'capital', 'US', 'also', 'major', 'metropolis', 'rich', 'variety', 'lesbians-NOT', 'just', 'up-scale', 'high-femmes.Another', 'thing', 'bothers', 'show', 'use', 'too', 'much', 'gratuitous', 'profanity', 'know', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'use', 'profanity', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'characters', 'use', 'too', 'much', 'gutter', 'language', 'be', 'believable', 'producers', 'want', 'show', 'how', ""'cool"", 'show', 'having', 'characters', 'constantly', 'spewing', 'four-letter', 'words.They', 'also', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'sex-scenes', 'show', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'sex', 'probably', 'lesbian', 'community', 'long-standing', 'myth', 'most', 'lesbians', 'do', ""n't"", 'value', 'plain', 'old', 'raw', 'sex', 'Many', 'not', 'most', 'can', 'do', 'sex', 'definitely', 'over-emphasized', 'show', 'thrown', 'face', 'manner', 'so', 'blatant', 'obviously', 'done', 'only', 'shock-value', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'plot-lines', 'tacky', 'contrived.We', 'need', 'show', 'air', 'lesbians', 'segments', 'community', 'L', 'Word', 'just', ""n't"", 'presenting', 'show', 'so', 'lacking', 'depth', 'realistic', 'characters', 'taste', 'mediocre', 'best']",The L Word: Season 1

And while fans of the show are undoubtedly thrilled, as a DVD buff, I was less than thrilled with the lack of extras on the set.  Any fan of Star Trek or Xena knows box sets covering those TV  classics are chock full of extras such as bloopers, deleted scenes,  behind-the-scenes interviews with the stars, commentaries, and more. Early reports said this box set would have some such content, but it evidently didn't make it into this season's offering.While the box set does have an extra disc dedicated  to special features, most of these features have either been seen  on Showtime or available in print-form on the Web. For example, ""the  L Word Defined"" is a special that Showtime aired several months  ago while promoting TLW, and while it's always nice to watch reruns, once is normally enough. There are some behind-the-scenes featurettes  about the fashion designers, and we get to see a little bit of  what goes into dressing the character of Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels),  and the process dressing each of the characters. We get cast bios, some selected fan mail, and a Season 2 preview (which is also currently  running on Showtime).The most original, and probably the funniest, piece on the set  is a puppet show created by the cast. A spoof based on Marina and  Jenny's first meeting, it will crack you up laughing. Evidently,  these ladies have entirely too much time on their hands or have  a damn good time hanging out together. Either way, it's pretty darn funny. Kudos to the creators!Even though it's not as packed full of goodies as we'd like, it's  still nice to have all the episodes of the L word on DVD without worrying about someone erasing the TIVO!

While I think Queer As Folk is one of the best series ever made, this pales drastically in comparison. I'm a gay guy with a lot of lesbian friends and none of them are like the characters on this show.  Whereas QAF is somewhat realistic and depicts a wide range of gay male types, every single character on the L word is a ""lipstick lesbian"" and totally feminine.  This is not real life. They should have cast a few really butch women, a few soft butch women and a couple of really femme girls, THAT would have been realistic. None of these characters ever seem to be at work, they are always at restaurants and coffeehouses. The stories are dull and ineffective, and the acting is terrible.  Most of the actresses seem to not want to kiss each other and to not be very comfortable with it. They don't seem like people who have been in long relationships.  And why isn't there even one gay male character on the show? A buddy? Something? On QAF, they at least have a lesbian couple.  And a few older people. On the L Word, everyone is a slick, hot twentysomething. Again, not very true to life. Well, except for the awesome Pam Grier, who is wasted in a nothing role in this. And don't get me started on Mia Kirschner. She looks like she has an eating disorder, because she's so sickly thin.  I just wanted to sit her down and make her eat some pancakes.

There's a lot written about the plot, characters and cast, so I thought I'd take some time to review the Bonus Disk in this set.Disk 5 - in the same case as Disk 4 - contains Bonus Features. All of which are explained below :Fashion Extras - This is a behind the scenes feature with the fashion consultants for the show. It shows them shopping for each characters wardrobe and includes a fitting session with Erin Daniels (Dana).Puppet Movie - This is actually worth the price of the set. It's a terrifically funny ""mouth puppet"" presentation by some of the cast. It includes a recap of several scenes and show an appreciation of a cast that does not take itself too seriously. My particular favorite part is towards the end, where we see their trailers. I laughed out loud. This is a keeper.The L Word Defined - Basically the extended promo that appeared on Showtime. There's a lot here about how the L Word is NOT the Lesbian Queer As Folk. To quote Guin Turner, the L Word has ""a lot less drugs and a lot less dancing"". You have to love her for that. We'll excuse the fact that QAF does feature two pretty fabulous lesbians.Wardrobe Closet - This is just a still photo gallery with information on each character that also directs you to a website for more information. Do we need more information on their clothes? Um, anyone? Painfully, there is no background soundtrack on this feature.Season 2 Sneak Peak - Just that, a montage of snippets from upcoming Season 2 episodes. Lots of teasers and glimpses of guest stars.Power-Up Panel - This is a moderator lead panel discussion featuring some of the cast, producers and Showtime execs talking about the show. Power-Up is a professional organization for lesbians and women in the Entertainment, Arts and Media fields. You can check out their website. This is an interesting feature, though the camera work is shakey.Fan Mail - Well, its basically... fan mail. Yes, you read that right, this is still pictures of women who wrote in praising the show, and typed out versions of their letters. Again, painfully, there is no background sound track. I guess it's cool for the women featured, but otherwise, I was sort of bored.Biographies - Again with the still picture (would putting in clips have been so difficult) and a type written bio on each featured actress/actor. Again no background music or soundtrack. You can get this information anywhere, and incase you didn't know... Jennifer Beals was in a quiet little film called ""Flashdance"" before starring in The L Word.Photo Gallery - Finally, some music! This is stills from the show, cast and crew, edited to music. Some you've probably seen already, from the Showtime website.Previews - No, not of the L-Word but of other Showtime programs: ""Fat Actress"" and ""Queer As Folk"" (dvds).Promotions - Well, at least they tell you what you're getting.

ALl The Characters are great and the acting is superb too.Everything About The Series is great and i loved watching every episode , So when i bought this boxset of Amazon i was really happy but when i got it at my house , I saw the horrable Packaging ! The 5 DVD Boxset was in sperate DVD cases and the bonus features were dreadfull and a discrase to the excellent Tv Series. THE L WORD should have got the upper class treatment like the first Three boxsets of Queer as Folk . But all in all who cares Finally a great new show on Showtime Which i was ready to cancel for the lack of good programming. Make sure you pick up this Boxset and the new release 2nd Season The L Word is GREAT !",4,Great SHO Original !

841462,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B0002MPQRS,V.C.,"[4, 13]","This series, the L word, is interesting. The positive commentry I have over it is the fact that for once there is a show about the personal and intimate lives of lesbians, which is something you don't see on television or DVD everyday. However, that seems to be the only thing about this show that makes it interesting and slightly different. It's interesting to kind of have a glimpse of the lesbian world behind closed doors and in bars on television. BUT, the criticism i have over this show is just that...the stories are kind of flat. At times the stories are hard to follow, or they are simply too boring. Also, there is nothing much about this show that shows originality, except for the fact that the episodes revolve around these lesbians. I think there should be more to a show than just knowing the sexual preference of the characters. Half of these characters don't seem to have much personality, they're all too comfortable in their cliche, some are quite annoying, and there is barely anything in these characters that you can actually relate to, or actually love. And i wish that they could have made things more natural. It seems as if every single person on the show is a lesbian, except for the sexually confused Jenny and her fiance/bf tim. As i said before, the show lacks originality and excitement in these episodes. They seem to just go nowhere, and i notice at times that one day they can be at the bar, then the next scene can be at some other place and its the next day already. I wish they could specify when something is happening and where. I know this is a lot of criticism for a freshman debut of a new series, but i just think that this show is getting a bit overrated and overlooked because of the lesbian factor of it. Don't get me wrong, it's great that this show revolves around lesbians, and its great that there are a few lesbian sex scenes (not enough though...so don't expect this to be porn) but i just think there should be more to this show than just the fact that these characters are lesbians. They need to put more depth and personality in these characters, and make them more unique, sometimes i feel as if they're so comfortable with each other that they don't even have their own unique personality. Anyway, i give it 3 stars for at least making an effort to create a show based on the love lives of lesbians. I give it 0 stars for originality, there still needs to be some development on this show, so hopefully the creators will put more character and story development by the second season. I recommend for you to rent it and make your own judgements before you actually buy it.",3,"Hm, It's Okay",1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2630,"['series', 'L', 'word', 'interesting', 'positive', 'commentry', 'have', 'fact', 'once', 'show', 'personal', 'intimate', 'lives', 'lesbians', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'television', 'DVD', 'everyday', 'However', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'interesting', 'slightly', 'different', 'interesting', 'kind', 'have', 'glimpse', 'lesbian', 'world', 'closed', 'doors', 'bars', 'television', 'BUT', 'criticism', 'i', 'have', 'show', 'just', 'stories', 'are', 'kind', 'flat', 'times', 'stories', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'boring', 'Also', 'nothing', 'much', 'show', 'originality', 'fact', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'lesbians', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'show', 'just', 'knowing', 'sexual', 'preference', 'characters', 'Half', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'personality', ""'re"", 'too', 'comfortable', 'cliche', 'are', 'quite', 'annoying', 'barely', 'anything', 'characters', 'can', 'actually', 'relate', 'actually', 'love', 'i', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'more', 'natural', 'single', 'person', 'show', 'lesbian', 'sexually', 'confused', 'Jenny', 'fiance/bf', 'tim', 'i', 'said', 'show', 'originality', 'excitement', 'episodes', 'seem', 'just', 'go', 'nowhere', 'i', 'notice', 'times', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'bar', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'place', 'next', 'day', 'already', 'wish', 'could', 'specify', 'when', 'something', 'happening', 'where', 'know', 'lot', 'criticism', 'freshman', 'debut', 'new', 'series', 'i', 'just', 'think', 'show', 'getting', 'bit', 'overrated', 'overlooked', 'lesbian', 'factor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'great', 'show', 'lesbians', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'enough', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'porn', 'i', 'just', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'show', 'just', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'lesbians', 'need', 'put', 'more', 'depth', 'personality', 'characters', 'make', 'more', 'unique', 'sometimes', 'i', 'feel', ""'re"", 'so', 'comfortable', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'Anyway', 'i', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'least', 'making', 'effort', 'create', 'show', 'based', 'love', 'lesbians', 'give', '0', 'stars', 'originality', 'still', 'be', 'development', 'show', 'so', 'hopefully', 'creators', 'will', 'put', 'more', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'second', 'season', 'recommend', 'rent', 'make', 'own', 'judgements', 'actually', 'buy']",The L Word: Season 1

Okay, this is a TV show so I'll pretend I'm okay with the beauty factor. The show was well-made, very pleasing to the eye for the most part and I enjoyed seeing the seedier neighborhoods of LA. On the other hand, both Jenny and Marina (especially Jenny though) got on my nerves quite a bit and I wanted to slap Tina around frequently. I agree with the reviewer who said Pam Grier's talents were wasted. Jennifer Beals plays an annoying character (Bette) but it is mostly realistic and she is so beautiful you want to watch her all day long. Dana and Alice are type-cast as providing the lighter side and the comic relief. As for Shane, I am not quite sure what to think. All in all, it had me sitting in front of the TV for a long time so it's worth giving a try.",3,Beautiful people indeed,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,870,"['never', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'gorgeous', 'lesbians', 'lifetime', 'not', 'unattractive', 'one', 'whole', 'lot', 'Okay', 'TV', 'show', ""'ll"", 'pretend', ""'m"", 'okay', 'beauty', 'factor', 'show', 'was', 'well-made', 'very', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'seedier', 'neighborhoods', 'LA', 'other', 'hand', 'Jenny', 'Marina', 'especially', 'Jenny', 'got', 'nerves', 'quite', 'bit', 'wanted', 'slap', 'Tina', 'frequently', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'talents', 'were', 'wasted', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'annoying', 'character', 'Bette', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'so', 'beautiful', 'want', 'watch', 'day', 'long', 'Dana', 'Alice', 'are', 'type-cast', 'providing', 'lighter', 'side', 'comic', 'relief', 'Shane', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'had', 'sitting', 'front', 'TV', 'long', 'time', 'worth', 'giving', 'try']",The L Word: Season 1
