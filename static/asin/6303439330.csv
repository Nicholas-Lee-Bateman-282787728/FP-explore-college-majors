374465,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,6303439330,a,"[1, 1]","After my infant daughter so enjoyed the ""Disneyland Fun"" DVD, I decided to get this one for her.  While she enjoys seeing the costumed Disney characters and the lively songs, she did not enjoy this one as much and neither did I.  Filmed on location at Walt Disney World in 1995, this video features a group of very hyper children dancing and singing alongside the characters.Grown-ups familiar with the Disney parks will enjoy spotting the different Florida locations as backdrop.  Scenes were filmed outside the Grand Floridian and Polynesian resorts, near Fort Wilderness, in World Showcase lagoon at Epcot, and even at the backlot of the MGM Studios (doubling unconvincingly for the childrens' own homes and neighborhood).I was disappointed to see that, unlike the ""Disneyland Fun"" DVD, this one did not offer a second bonus program in a different language. ""Disneyland Fun"" offers an entirely different second program shot at Disneyland Paris which doubles the running time of that DVD to one hour.  My advice is to purchase that one instead, but if you want two or more singalong DVDs, this one is a pretty good second choice.",4,"Not as Fun as ""Disneyland Fun,"" But...",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1131,"['infant', 'daughter', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'DVD', 'decided', 'get', 'one', 'seeing', 'costumed', 'Disney', 'characters', 'lively', 'songs', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'one', 'much', 'did', 'I.', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'World', '1995', 'video', 'group', 'very', 'hyper', 'children', 'dancing', 'singing', 'characters.Grown-ups', 'familiar', 'Disney', 'parks', 'will', 'enjoy', 'spotting', 'different', 'Florida', 'locations', 'backdrop', 'Scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'Grand', 'Floridian', 'Polynesian', 'resorts', 'Fort', 'Wilderness', 'World', 'Showcase', 'lagoon', 'Epcot', 'even', 'backlot', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'doubling', 'unconvincingly', 'childrens', 'own', 'homes', 'neighborhood', '.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'DVD', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'second', 'bonus', 'program', 'different', 'language', 'Disneyland', 'Fun', 'entirely', 'different', 'second', 'program', 'shot', 'Disneyland', 'Paris', 'running', 'time', 'DVD', 'one', 'hour', 'advice', 'purchase', 'one', 'instead', 'want', 'two', 'more', 'singalong', 'DVDs', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'second', 'choice']",Disney's Sing Along Songs - Beach Party at Walt Disney World VHS
374466,AH93HX89KVQG2,6303439330,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[1, 1]","Our 22-month old is OBSESSED with this video. Like, if there was a Mickeyholics Anonymous she'd be going there. At first I thought it's because she hasn't watched TV until recently. But she doesn't care about any other film -- she just wants this one. ALL THE TIME. As soon as we get home, she says ""Mockey?"" once a second. Of course we don't let her watch it all the time, so quite a few conflicts arise there.So on the one hand, this video is GREAT at doing what it's supposed to do: entertain children. If you want your child rooted in place so you're free to do other things, this video is great for that! Our 4-year old neighbor next door was also fixated by this video when she was visiting, so the target age range is pretty wide.On the other hand, it can potentially drive parents crazy (we have all the songs from this BURNED into our brains) and turn children into crazed Mickeyholics! I am a huge Disney movies and resorts fan, but even I can't sit through this whole video and remain sane. I can watch little bits here and there. It's definitely targeted at kids under 10.Oh, by the way, if you're a fan of Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" like I am, you'll be interested to know that Jodi Benson, who provided the voice of Ariel for the movie, makes an appearance as Ariel for this video in the ""Part of Your World"" segment.UPDATE, 1 month later... She has expanded her tastes to include Barney, Sesame Street and Dora. And she actually prefers them over this sometimes. So I guess the obsession was not long-lived, thankfully!UPDATE - 7/2/10 - She finally got tired of watching this. I rentedSing Along Songs - Campout at Walt Disney Worldand she loves it just as much. She also really likesSing Along Songs - Flik's Musical Adventure. She did not likeSing Along Songs - Disneyland Funand neither did I (I wrote a review on it if you want to know why).",5,This video is good...

The show must have taken years to film because either the kids grew up or there are different kids towards the end. It does not look like Mika Boorem in the segment ""Hot, Hot, Hot"", In the segment ""Set Your Name Free""the lead-in looks different than the song itself as far as Caitlin Wachs, in the song she resembles Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen. Also in the same segment one minute Brenden Clark has sunglasses on his head, then no sunglasses, then sunglasses, then no sunglasses. There must have been some editing. Actually to me it looks like Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen is also in the next segment ""Surfin' Safari"". In the segment ""Set Your Name Free"" Brenden Clark looks taller than Mika Boorem, but in the lead-in segment to ""Three Littles Fishies"" where they are taking the pictures Mika looks taller than Brenden, but in the last segments Brenden looks taller than Mika again.

Ariel from The Little Mermaid even makes an appearance.  Several of the songs will already be somewhat familiar to kids, but in case  they aren't, the words are at the bottom of the screen (assuming the kids  can read.)  What's also cool is that two of the kids in the video are  actresses Mika Boorem (&quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;Mighty Joe  Young&quot;) and Caitlin Wachs (&quot;The Profiler&quot;, &quot;My Dog  Skip&quot;), so that's cool.
