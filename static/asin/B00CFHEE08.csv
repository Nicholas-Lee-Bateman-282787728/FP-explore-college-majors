He wins and then loses thousands of dollars and goes back home empty handed.  But did meet and fall in love with the Belle of the Coast Ann Dvorak.  Returning to San Francisco he sets out to win her by becoming a major player in the city.  You know she is going to end up with The Duke (who's character is called Duke), but they do a good job of making you wonder with the competition of Joseph Schildkraut (he does a great job) the good bad guy of the film.
