1093118,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000U0FZ0K,atisheh,"[21, 22]","I bought this DVD and its companion for the lower back shortly after having a debilitating back spasm that put me out of commission for several weeks. I went to physiotherapy, and although it did help, I find the exercises excruciatingly boring, which of course means I don't do them as often as I should.So, what was the result? These DVDs are quite simply a godsend. (I'm only writing a review of this one now because I haven't yet used all three segments of the lower back DVD.) Kraftsow says in his introduction that doing the yoga exercises should be like brushing your teeth, and I find that the program is designed to make it just as easy to keep the stretching going as brushing teeth would be! Knowing that I have a choice between segments of different lengths, and that I can do just 20 minutes in the morning (before I get too hungry!) and still be doing something for my back, makes it so much more realistic to keep up a yoga program.That, and the fact that the exercises work. I am sometimes so tense that the neck & shoulders movements don't relax me completely, but they do help, and I generally feel the difference the following morning: they can be better described as preventing future, worse pain than easing current pain. I might add that several of the exercises are similar to what I learned in physiotherapy, which gave me some confidence in the system.I spent more on these DVDs than I usually do on exercise videos, but I also use them several times a week, much more than I use anything else. They offer variety in type of exercise and duration of program, and they're set up so that I can do a light program when I'm suffering from pain and a harder one when I want to build strength. I've also noticed a difference in my core abdominal strength from using the two videos. Finally, I should add that the DVDs also include mp3 files of the practices, in case you just want to work out with the sound and don't need the video any more.",5,Could not recommend this more enthusiastically.,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1961,"['bought', 'DVD', 'companion', 'lower', 'back', 'shortly', 'having', 'debilitating', 'back', 'spasm', 'put', 'commission', 'several', 'weeks', 'went', 'physiotherapy', 'did', 'help', 'find', 'exercises', 'excruciatingly', 'boring', 'course', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'often', 'should.So', 'what', 'was', 'result', 'DVDs', 'are', 'quite', 'simply', 'godsend', ""'m"", 'only', 'writing', 'review', 'one', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'used', 'three', 'segments', 'lower', 'back', 'DVD', 'Kraftsow', 'introduction', 'doing', 'yoga', 'exercises', 'should', 'be', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'find', 'program', 'designed', 'make', 'just', 'easy', 'keep', 'stretching', 'going', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'would', 'be', 'Knowing', 'have', 'choice', 'segments', 'different', 'lengths', 'can', 'do', 'just', '20', 'minutes', 'morning', 'get', 'too', 'hungry', 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'back', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'keep', 'up', 'yoga', 'program.That', 'fact', 'exercises', 'work', 'am', 'sometimes', 'so', 'tense', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'relax', 'completely', 'do', 'help', 'generally', 'feel', 'difference', 'following', 'morning', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'described', 'preventing', 'future', 'worse', 'pain', 'easing', 'current', 'pain', 'might', 'add', 'several', 'exercises', 'are', 'similar', 'what', 'learned', 'physiotherapy', 'gave', 'confidence', 'system.I', 'spent', 'more', 'DVDs', 'usually', 'do', 'exercise', 'videos', 'also', 'use', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'much', 'more', 'use', 'anything', 'else', 'offer', 'variety', 'type', 'exercise', 'duration', 'program', ""'re"", 'set', 'up', 'can', 'do', 'light', 'program', 'when', ""'m"", 'suffering', 'pain', 'harder', 'one', 'when', 'want', 'build', 'strength', ""'ve"", 'also', 'noticed', 'difference', 'core', 'abdominal', 'strength', 'using', 'two', 'videos', 'Finally', 'should', 'add', 'DVDs', 'also', 'include', 'mp3', 'files', 'practices', 'case', 'just', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'video', 'more']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Upper Back, Neck & Shoulders with Gary Kraftsow"
1093119,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000U0FZ0K,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[141, 144]","This DVD focuses on issues of the upper body, specifically the upper back, neck, and shoulders (the other DVD in this series focuses on the lower body).  It differs from other yoga DVDs in that it contains a strong educational component in addition to the practice element.  Also, the practices on the DVD are designed for rehabilitation and strengthening, and thus they are more similar in feel to a physical therapy session than to a yoga class.The main menu of this DVD consists of four separate segments:  1) Understanding Back Pain, 2) Technique Workshop, 3) Therapeutic Practices, and 4) Special Features.  The Technique Workshop provides the opportunity to study individual postures in greater depth.  The Viniyoga Therapeutic Practices offer three complete practice segments tailored to meet different needs as described below.  (Note: the DVD also provides bonus MP3 audio versions of each practice.)1. Upper Back and Neck Therapy (22 minutes).  This is the most gentle of the three practices, and it is designed to address misalignment or instability by strengthening and mobilizing the upper back and neck.  In consists mainly of movements which serve to lengthen the upper spine.2. Neck and Shoulder Therapy (32 minutes).  This practice is more specifically geared to releasing pain or restricted movement in the neck and shoulders via stretching, aligning, and balancing work.  Many of the postures here involve moving one arm as you twist your neck to the opposite side.3. Strength and Stability (41 minutes).  This longer practice is intend to build sustained, long-term health in the upper back, neck, and shoulders.  It is a bit more intense than the previous two, containing many of the same posture sequences but adding some stronger work as well.The practices feature a single student working on a mat against a rather sparse white set, with Gary providing instruction via voiceover.  Most people are likely to find the practices rather dry--Gary's voice is a big monotone and repetitive, and there's little ""fun factor"" here.  However, these are therapeutic in nature, and as such, they are quite effective.  I found the twisting motions from the Neck and Shoulder Therapy practice in particular to be extremely beneficial for my nagging neck soreness and frequently tight upper back and shoulders.  This DVD would be useful for virtually anyone who is at risk for upper back issues, from those who work at a desk daily to those with more chronic conditions.  I definitely recommend Viniyoga Therapy for Upper Back, Neck, and Shoulders as an excellent tool for alleviating pain and promoting health in the upper back, neck, and shoulders.",5,"Excellent yoga video for increasing mobility in the upper back, neck, and shoulders",1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2659,"['DVD', 'issues', 'upper', 'body', 'specifically', 'upper', 'back', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'other', 'DVD', 'series', 'lower', 'body', 'other', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'strong', 'educational', 'component', 'addition', 'practice', 'element', 'Also', 'practices', 'DVD', 'are', 'designed', 'rehabilitation', 'strengthening', 'thus', 'are', 'more', 'similar', 'feel', 'physical', 'therapy', 'session', 'yoga', 'class.The', 'main', 'menu', 'DVD', 'four', 'separate', 'segments', '1', 'Understanding', 'Back', 'Pain', '2', 'Technique', 'Workshop', '3', 'Therapeutic', 'Practices', '4', 'Special', 'Features', 'Technique', 'Workshop', 'opportunity', 'study', 'individual', 'postures', 'greater', 'depth', 'Viniyoga', 'Therapeutic', 'Practices', 'offer', 'three', 'complete', 'practice', 'segments', 'tailored', 'meet', 'different', 'needs', 'described', 'Note', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'MP3', 'audio', 'versions', 'practice.', '1', 'Upper', 'Back', 'Neck', 'Therapy', '22', 'minutes', 'most', 'gentle', 'three', 'practices', 'designed', 'address', 'misalignment', 'instability', 'strengthening', 'mobilizing', 'upper', 'back', 'neck', 'mainly', 'movements', 'serve', 'lengthen', 'upper', 'spine.2', 'Neck', 'Shoulder', 'Therapy', '32', 'minutes', 'practice', 'more', 'specifically', 'geared', 'releasing', 'pain', 'restricted', 'movement', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'stretching', 'aligning', 'balancing', 'work', 'Many', 'postures', 'here', 'involve', 'moving', 'one', 'arm', 'twist', 'neck', 'opposite', 'side.3', 'Strength', 'Stability', '41', 'minutes', 'longer', 'practice', 'intend', 'build', 'sustained', 'long-term', 'health', 'upper', 'back', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'previous', 'two', 'containing', 'many', 'same', 'posture', 'sequences', 'adding', 'stronger', 'work', 'well.The', 'practices', 'feature', 'single', 'student', 'working', 'mat', 'rather', 'sparse', 'white', 'set', 'Gary', 'providing', 'instruction', 'voiceover', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'practices', 'rather', 'dry', 'Gary', 'voice', 'big', 'monotone', 'repetitive', 'little', 'fun', 'factor', 'here', 'However', 'are', 'therapeutic', 'nature', 'such', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'found', 'twisting', 'motions', 'Neck', 'Shoulder', 'Therapy', 'practice', 'particular', 'be', 'extremely', 'beneficial', 'nagging', 'neck', 'soreness', 'frequently', 'tight', 'upper', 'back', 'shoulders', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'who', 'risk', 'upper', 'back', 'issues', 'who', 'work', 'desk', 'daily', 'more', 'chronic', 'conditions', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Viniyoga', 'Therapy', 'Upper', 'Back', 'Neck', 'Shoulders', 'excellent', 'tool', 'alleviating', 'pain', 'promoting', 'health', 'upper', 'back', 'neck', 'shoulders']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Upper Back, Neck & Shoulders with Gary Kraftsow"

Hutter ""v_rh""","[9, 12]","For the past few months I have been experiencing tingling sensations on the side of my neck, upper chest, upper back on the left side of my body when in various positions lying down, sitting or standing and pain when turning my head to the right as far as it will go.  I checked with my primary care physician and he told me the problems were with my C-2, and between my C-6 and C-7 vertebrae and said I would probably need physical therapy to restore full range of motion and stop the tingling and pain.At amazon.com I searched for DVDs to help relieve neck and back pain that would demonstrate the correct way to do the exercises.  Several yoga DVDs came up. I read the reviews by customers and this was one of the DVDs that was rated highly by customers who stated the exercises were simple (some said too simple and boring) and gave it rave reviews.  As a consequence of the customer reviews and the description of the viniyoga therapy method and one other ""simple"" yoga DVD I ordered both DVDs from amazon.When this DVD arrived I watched it all the way through and was totally dismayed.  Gary Kraftsow used pictures from an anatomical chart to identify which muscles would be worked using each of his viniyoga exercises but did not address the causes of neck and back pain nor did the DVD give modifications that could be done if you could not do the exercises as they were demonstrated.  He was also insistent that the sequencing of the exercises was very important in getting results in building the particular muscles as well as the importance of a focus on breathing.I am a senior who is fit but have never practiced any type of yoga before and believed the statements that beginners would be able to do these exercises (the same claim is made for other ""yoga for beginners"" books and DVDs).  I wanted to know how  specifically a particular ""position"" or ""stretch"" was going to help alleviate my tingling, pain and loss of range of motion on one side of my neck and spine.This DVD uses two excellent students of viniyoga, a senior woman and middle-aged man, both of whom were flexible and could do the positions with Kraftow's being seated on the floor next to them doing minor tweaking of their movements/positions which would be impossible for me to do at home alone.Additionally, there is no way that I can:  get onto the floor; get off the floor if I did manage to get down; can lie on my stomach turning my head to the side; focus on my breathing while holding the stretch; or would ever consider doing these exercises.In my opinion this DVD is for very flexible people or people who have done yoga before. I have resold both of the two yoga DVDs I purchased.A physical therapist recommended a book on amazon.com written by two Ph.D. physical therapists which is exactly what I was looking for: ""Age-defying Fitness"" by Moffat and Lewis.  The book has assessment guides to let you know which exercises would be helpful for you to do as well as pictures of people demonstrating the correct way to do the exercises.  The book shows people using an elastic band exerciser as well as those not using the band for the exercises.

I sincerely hope the review helps other seniors or people in the same quandry as to what exercises will help alleviate pain in their necks and backs.",1,Caution for people who have never practiced yoga,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3704,"['past', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'been', 'experiencing', 'tingling', 'sensations', 'side', 'neck', 'upper', 'chest', 'upper', 'back', 'left', 'side', 'body', 'when', 'various', 'positions', 'lying', 'down', 'sitting', 'standing', 'pain', 'when', 'turning', 'head', 'right', 'as', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'checked', 'primary', 'care', 'physician', 'told', 'problems', 'were', 'C-2', 'C-6', 'C-7', 'vertebrae', 'said', 'would', 'probably', 'need', 'physical', 'therapy', 'restore', 'full', 'range', 'motion', 'stop', 'tingling', 'pain.At', 'amazon.com', 'searched', 'DVDs', 'help', 'relieve', 'neck', 'back', 'pain', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'correct', 'way', 'do', 'exercises', 'Several', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'came', 'up', 'read', 'reviews', 'customers', 'was', 'one', 'DVDs', 'was', 'rated', 'highly', 'customers', 'who', 'stated', 'exercises', 'were', 'simple', 'said', 'too', 'simple', 'boring', 'gave', 'rave', 'reviews', 'consequence', 'customer', 'reviews', 'description', 'viniyoga', 'therapy', 'method', 'one', 'other', 'simple', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'ordered', 'DVDs', 'amazon.When', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'watched', 'way', 'was', 'totally', 'dismayed', 'Gary', 'Kraftsow', 'used', 'pictures', 'anatomical', 'chart', 'identify', 'muscles', 'would', 'be', 'worked', 'using', 'viniyoga', 'exercises', 'did', 'not', 'address', 'causes', 'neck', 'back', 'pain', 'did', 'DVD', 'give', 'modifications', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'exercises', 'were', 'demonstrated', 'was', 'also', 'insistent', 'sequencing', 'exercises', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'getting', 'results', 'building', 'particular', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'importance', 'focus', 'breathing.I', 'am', 'senior', 'who', 'fit', 'have', 'never', 'practiced', 'type', 'yoga', 'believed', 'statements', 'beginners', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'exercises', 'same', 'claim', 'made', 'other', 'yoga', 'beginners', 'books', 'DVDs', 'wanted', 'know', 'how', 'specifically', 'particular', 'position', 'stretch', 'was', 'going', 'help', 'alleviate', 'tingling', 'pain', 'loss', 'range', 'motion', 'one', 'side', 'neck', 'spine.This', 'DVD', 'two', 'excellent', 'students', 'viniyoga', 'senior', 'woman', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'whom', 'were', 'flexible', 'could', 'do', 'positions', 'Kraftow', 'being', 'seated', 'floor', 'next', 'doing', 'minor', 'tweaking', 'movements/positions', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'home', 'alone.Additionally', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'floor', 'get', 'floor', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'down', 'can', 'lie', 'stomach', 'turning', 'head', 'side', 'focus', 'breathing', 'holding', 'stretch', 'would', 'ever', 'consider', 'doing', 'exercises.In', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'very', 'flexible', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'yoga', 'have', 'resold', 'two', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'purchased.A', 'physical', 'therapist', 'recommended', 'book', 'amazon.com', 'written', 'two', 'Ph.D.', 'physical', 'therapists', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'Age-defying', 'Fitness', 'Moffat', 'Lewis', 'book', 'assessment', 'guides', 'let', 'know', 'exercises', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'pictures', 'people', 'demonstrating', 'correct', 'way', 'do', 'exercises', 'book', 'people', 'using', 'elastic', 'band', 'exerciser', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'using', 'band', 'exercises', 'Moffat', 'Lewis', 'cover', 'posture', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'endurance', '-things', 'others', 'certainly', 'need', 'age.I', 'realize', 'review', 'will', 'infuriate', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'students', 'teachers', 'will', 'vehemently', 'disagree', 'review', 'review', 'judgment', 'practice', 'specific', 'yoga', 'positions', 'alleviate', 'neck', 'upper', 'back', 'pain', 'seniors', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'practiced', 'yoga', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'review', 'other', 'seniors', 'people', 'same', 'quandry', 'what', 'exercises', 'will', 'help', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'necks', 'backs']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Upper Back, Neck & Shoulders with Gary Kraftsow"
